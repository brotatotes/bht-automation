<p><strong> 14</strong> .] Many Commentators (Luth., Calv., Grot., Calov., Le Clerc, Beng., Pelt, Winer, al.) have joined <strong> διὰ τῆς ἐπιστολῆς</strong> with what follows, and explained it (usually, see below), ‘ <em> note that man by an Epistle</em> ( <em> to me</em> ).’ But <strong> τῆς</strong> is decidedly against this rendering, unless we suppose that it signifies ‘your’ answer to this. (Bengel and Pelt, taking τῆς ἐπ . for this Epistle, would render, ‘notate nota censoria, hanc Epist., ejus admonendi causa, adhibentes eique incultantes’ (Beng.), ‘Eum hac epistola freti severius tractate’ (Pelt): but both these require σημειοῦσθε to be diverted from its simple meaning.) The great objection to the above connexion is that St. Paul has already pointed out the manner of treating such an one, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</span> , and is not likely to enjoin a further reference to himself on the subject. It is far better therefore, with Chrys. (there seems no reason for qualifying this by <em> apparently</em> , as Ellic), Est., Corn.-a-lap., Beza, Hamm., Whitby, Schott, Olsh., De W., Baum.-Crus., Lün., Ellic., all., to join διὰ τῆς ἐπ . with the preceding τῷ λόγ . ἡμ ., and render it <strong> our word by this Epistle</strong> , as ἡ ἐπιστολή is undoubtedly used in reff., and the <em> word</em> is that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:12">2 Thessalonians 3:12</span> .
