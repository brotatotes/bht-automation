 14 .] Many Commentators (Luth., Calv., Grot., Calov., Le Clerc, Beng., Pelt, Winer, al.) have joined  διὰ τῆς ἐπιστολῆς with what follows, and explained it (usually, see below), ‘  note that man by an Epistle (  to me ).’ But  τῆς is decidedly against this rendering, unless we suppose that it signifies ‘your’ answer to this. (Bengel and Pelt, taking τῆς ἐπ . for this Epistle, would render, ‘notate nota censoria, hanc Epist., ejus admonendi causa, adhibentes eique incultantes’ (Beng.), ‘Eum hac epistola freti severius tractate’ (Pelt): but both these require σημειοῦσθε to be diverted from its simple meaning.) The great objection to the above connexion is that St. Paul has already pointed out the manner of treating such an one, 2 Thessalonians 3:6 , and is not likely to enjoin a further reference to himself on the subject. It is far better therefore, with Chrys. (there seems no reason for qualifying this by  apparently , as Ellic), Est., Corn.-a-lap., Beza, Hamm., Whitby, Schott, Olsh., De W., Baum.-Crus., Lün., Ellic., all., to join διὰ τῆς ἐπ . with the preceding τῷ λόγ . ἡμ ., and render it  our word by this Epistle , as ἡ ἐπιστολή is undoubtedly used in reff., and the  word is that in 2 Thessalonians 3:12 .
	 σημειοῦσθε ]  mark , see ref. Polyb.: the ordinary meaning of the word: put a σημεῖον on him, by noticing him for the sake of avoidance. On what is called the dynamic middle, see Krüger, Sprachlehre, § 52. 8. 4.
