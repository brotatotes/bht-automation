<p><strong> 17</strong> .] <em> Autographic salutation</em> . The Epistle, as it follows from this, was not written with the Apostle’s own hand, but dictated. So with other Epistles; see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:22">Romans 16:22</span> :<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</span> .

<p><strong> ὅ</strong> ] <strong> which circumstance:</strong> not attraction for ὅς . The whole of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17-18">2 Thessalonians 3:17-18</span> , not merely the benediction, are included. By the words <strong> οὕτως γράφω</strong> , we must not conceive that any thing was <em> added</em> , such as his signature, or as Œc., οἷον τὸ ἀσπάζομαι ὑμᾶς , ἢ τὸ ἔῤῥωσθε , ἤ τι τοιοῦτον : they are said of that which he is writing at the time. His reason for this caution evidently was, the <strong> ἐπιστολὴ ὡς δι</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἡμῶν</strong> , spoken of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span> . And the words <strong> ἐν πάσῃ ἐπιστολῇ</strong> must not, with Lün., be limited to any future Epistles which he might send to the Thessalonians, but understood of a caution which he intended to practise in future with all his Epistles: or at least with such as required, from circumstances, this identification. Thus we have (1 Thess. being manifestly an exception, as written before the rule was established) Gal. written with his own hand (see note on Gal 6:11 ); 1 Cor. authenticated ( 1Co 16:21 ); 2 Cor. sent by Titus and therefore perhaps not needing it (but it may have existed in 2Co 13:12-13 without being specified); Rom. not requiring it as not insisting on his personal authority (but here again the concluding doxology may have been autographic): Col. authenticated ( Col 4:18 ); Eph. apparently without it (but possibly Eph 6:24 may have been autographic): Phil. from its character and its bearer Epaphroditus not requiring it (but here again Eph 4:23 may be autographic): and the Epistles to individuals would not require such authentication, not to mention that they are probably all autographic that to Philemon certainly is, see Phm 1:19 there. (So for the most part De Wette.)</p>
