 2 .] And in order for that to be the case, that we may be free to preach it. On  ἄτοπος , Lünem. says, “it is properly used of that which is not in its right place. When of  persons , it designates one who does or says that which is inappropriate under the circumstances. Thus it answers to  ineptus in Latin (Cic. de Orat. ii. 4). From ‘aptitude,’ it passes to its wider ethical meaning, and is used of men who act contrary to divine or human laws. Thus it gets the general signification of  bad or  ungodly . See examples in Kypke, Obss. ii. p. 145, in Lösner and Wetst.” Who are these men? It is obvious that the key to the answer will be found in Acts 18:0 . They were the Jews at Corinth, who were at that time the especial adversaries of the Apostle and his preaching. And this is confirmed by the clause which he has added to account for their ἀτοπία and πονηρία :
	 οὐ γὰρ πάντων ἡ πίστις  for to all men the (Christian)  faith does not belong all men do not receive it have no receptivity for it obviously pointing at Jews by this description. It is more natural to understand the article here as definite,  the faith , than as abstract: for  faith , as such, would not bear much meaning here.
