 5 .] There does not appear to be any distrust of the Thessalonians implied by this repeated wish for them, as De W. supposes. Rather is it an  enlargement , taken up by the δέ (not only so, but)  of the ἃ παραγγέλλομεν κ . ποιεῖτε κ . ποιήσετε .
	 ὁ κύρ  . is  our Lord , as before.
	 ἡ ἀγάπη τ  .   θεοῦ here, from the fact of his wishing that their hearts may be  directed into it , must be subjective,  the love of man to God . The objective meaning,  God’s love , is out of the question. The other subjective meanings,  the love which God works (Pelt), …  which God commands (LeClerc), are far-fetched. ἡ ὑπομονὴ τ . χριστοῦ has very generally been understood as in E. V., ‘  the patient waiting for Christ .’ So Œc., Ambr., Erasm., Corn.-a-lap., Beza, all. But  ὑπομονή will not bear this meaning. It occurs thirty-four times in the N. T., and always in the sense of  endurance, patience . Nor again can the expression mean ‘  endurance for Christ’s sake ,’ which the simple genitive will not convey: but it must be, as Chrys. (1) ἵνα ὑπομένωμεν , ὡς ἐκεῖνος ὑπέμεινεν , the  patience  of Christ (gen. possess.),  which Christ shewed .
