<b> 5.</b>] There does not appear to be any distrust of the Thessalonians implied by this repeated wish for them, as De Wette supposes. Rather is it an<i> enlargement</i>, taken up by the<b> but</b> (not only so, but), of<i> the assurance</i> just expressed.<br><br><b> the Lord</b>—<i>Christ</i>, as before.<br><br><b> the love of God</b> here, from the fact of his wishing that their hearts may be<i> directed into it</i>, must be subjective,<i> the love of man to God</i>.<br><br><b> the patience of Christ</b> has very generally been understood, as in A.V., ‘<i>the patient waiting</i><i> for Christ</i>.’ But the substantive will not bear this meaning. It occurs thirty-four times in the New Test., and always in the sense of<b> endurance,—patience</b>. Nor again can the expression mean ‘<i>endurance</i><i> for Christ’s sake</i>,’ which the simple genitive will not convey: but it must be, as Chrysostom says, “that we may endure as He endured:”<i> the patience</i><b> of Christ</b> (genitive possessive),—<b>which Christ shewed</b>.
