 6 .]  παραγγέλλομεν δέ takes up the assurance of 2 Thessalonians 3:4 , and tests its general form by a special command.
	 ἐν ὀνόμ . κ . τ . λ . strengthens the παραγγ ., and does not belong to the following.
	 στέλλεσθαι ] lit. ‘to take in, or shorten sail:’ ἱστία μὲν στείλαντο , θέσαν δ ʼ ἐν νηῒ μελαίνῃ , Il. α . 433: hence, to draw in or shorten, generally: πότερά σοι παῤῥησίᾳ | φράσω τὰ κεῖθεν , ἢ λόγον στειλώμεθα , Eur. Bacch. 625; to conceal: ἐβουλεύετο μὲν στέλλεσθαι , οὐ μὴν ἠδύνατό γε κρύπτειν τὸ γεγονός , Polyb. Frag. hist. 39 (from Suidas, voc. στείλασθαι ), οὐ δυναμένων τὴν ἐκ τῆς συνηθείας καταξίωσιν στέλλεσθαι (‘cohibere consuetam reverentiam’), ib. viii. 22. 4. So here, ‘cohibere vos’  to keep yourselves from : see reff.: obviously without allusion as yet to any formal excommunication, but implying merely avoidance in intercourse and fellowship. The accusative is repeated before the infinitive, probably because the clause ἐν ὀνόμ ., &c., intervenes.
	The παράδοσις refers to the oral instruction which the Apostle had given them when he was present, and subsequently confirmed by writing ( 1Th 4:11-12 ).
	 παρελάβοσαν ] plural, as belonging to the πάντες implied in παντός ; so in ἔβαν οἶκόνδε ἕκαστος .
	On the form -  οσαν , which is said to have been originally Macedonian, and thence is found in the Alexandrian ( ἐσχάζοσαν , Lycophr. 21), Lobeck remarks (Phryn. p. 349), “ex modorum et temporum metaplasmis, quos conjunctim tractare solent dialectorum scriptores, nullus diutius viguit eo quo tertiæ aoristi secundi personæ plurales ad similitudinem verborum in μι traducuntur, εἴδοσαν Niceph., ἐφεύροσαν Anna Comnena, μετήλθοσαν Nicet. (and παρήλθοσαν ).” We have ἤλθοσαν ἔθνη , Psalms 78:1 ; see other examples from LXX in Winer, edn. 6, § 13. 2. f.
