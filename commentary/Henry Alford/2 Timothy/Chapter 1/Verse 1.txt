Thdrt. explains it well, ὥστε με τὴν ἐπαγγελθεῖσαν αἰώνιον ζωὴν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις κηρύξαι . Chrysostom sees, in this mention of the promise of life in Christ, a consolation to Timotheus under present troubles: ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς ποιεῖται τὴν παραμυθίαν εἰ ἐπαγγελία ἐστί , μὴ ζήτει αὐτὴν ἐνταῦθα · ἐλπὶς γὰρ βλεπομένη οὐκ ἔστιν ἐλπίς . And this idea seems to be borne out by the strain of the subsequent portion of the Epistle, which is throughout one of confirmation and encouragement.
