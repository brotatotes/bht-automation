<b> 13.</b>] The utmost care is required, in interpreting this verse, to ascertain the probable meaning of the words in reference to the context. On the right appreciation of this depends the question whether they are to be taken in their strict meaning, and simple grammatical sense, or to be forced to some possible but far-fetched rendering. The consideration depends very much on the collocation and meaning of the words in the original, and can hardly be represented to the English reader. I have argued in my Greek Testament that the ordinary rendering as in A.V., “<i>Hold fast the form of sound words</i>,” is absolutely untenable. The verb does not mean “<i>hold fast</i>,’ but is simply “<b>have</b>,” or “<b>take</b>,” and it is not “<i>the</i> form,” but ‘<b>a form</b>,” or “<b>a sample</b>.” This being so, we shall have the rendering so far,—<b>Have</b> (take)<b> an example of</b> (the)<b> sound words, which thou heardest of me in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</b> Then two questions arise for us: to what (1) does<b> take an example</b> refer? I answer,—to the saying immediately preceding, “<i>I know whom I have trusted</i>,”<i>&c</i>. This was one of those<i> faithful</i> or<i> wholesome sayings</i>, of which we hear so often in these Epistles; one which in his timidity, Timothy was perhaps in danger of forgetting, and of which therefore the Apostle reminds him, and bids him take it as a specimen or pattern of those sound words which had been committed to him by his father in the faith. To what (2) do the words<b> in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus</b> refer? Certainly not to the words “<i>from me</i>,” meaning “those sound words which I spake to thee concerning, versed in, faith and love,”&c.: not, again, to the command “<i>here</i>,” or “<i>take</i>,” to which in our understanding of it, such a qualification would be altogether inapplicable: but to<b> thou heardest</b>, reminding Timothy of the readiness of belief, and warmth of affection, with which he had at first received the wholesome words from the mouth of the Apostle, and thus tacitly reproaching him for his present want of growth in that faith and love; as if it had been said, Let me in thus speaking, ‘I know whom I have believed, &c.,’ call to thy mind, by one example, those faithful sayings, those words of spiritual health, which thou once heardest with such receptivity and ardour as a Christian believer. Then, as following on this single example, the whole glorious deposit is solemnly committed to his care:—being a servant of One who will keep that. which we have entrusted to HIM, do thou in thy turn keep that which HE, by my means, has entrusted<i> to thee</i>:
