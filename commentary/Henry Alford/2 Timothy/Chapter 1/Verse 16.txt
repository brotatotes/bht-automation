<p><strong> 16</strong> .] <strong> May the Lord give mercy</strong> (an expression not found elsewhere in N. T.) <strong> to the house of Onesiphorus</strong> (from this expression, here and in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:19">2 Timothy 4:19</span> , and from what follows, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:18">2 Timothy 1:18</span> , it has been not improbably supposed, that Onesiphorus himself was no longer living at this time. Some indeed, as Thdrt. ( οὐ μόνον αὐτῷ ἀλλὰ καὶ παντὶ τῷ οἴκῳ τὸν θεῖον ἀντέδωκεν ἔλεον ), Calv. (“ob eum toti familiæ bene precatur. Unde colligimus Dei benedictionem non tantum super caput justi sed super totam domum residero”), al., take it as merely all extension of the gratitude of the Apostle from Onesiphorus to his household: but ch. 2Ti 4:19 is against this. Thdrt. indeed (as also Chrys.) understands that Onesiphorus was <em> with him</em> at this time: but the aorists here (cf. γενόμενος ) will hardly allow that), <strong> because on many occasions he refreshed me</strong> (from ψύχω , not from ψυχή . Any kind of refreshing, of body or mind, may be implied), <strong> and was not ashamed of</strong> ( 2Ti 1:8 ) <strong> my chain</strong> (reff.): <strong> but when he was in Rome, sought me out with extraordinary diligence</strong> (literally: with more diligence than could have been looked for. Or perhaps, <strong> the more diligently</strong> : scil. because I was in chains. <em> They</em> all ἀπεστράφησάν με : <em> he</em> not only did not this, but earnestly sought me) <strong> and found me</strong> .</p>
