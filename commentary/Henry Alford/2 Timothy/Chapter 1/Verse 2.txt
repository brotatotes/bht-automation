<b> 2</b>.]<b> my beloved child</b>] “Can it he accidental,” says Mack, “that instead of ‘my<i> true</i> child, as Timothy is called in the 1st Epistle, i. 2, and Titus i. 4,—here we have ‘my beloved child?’ Or may a reason for the change be found in this, that it now behoved Timothy to stir up afresh the faith and the grace in him, before he could again be worthy of the name<i> true</i> (genuine) in its full sense?” This may be too much pressed: but certainly there is throughout this Epistle an altered tone with regard to Timothy—more of mere love, and less of confidence, than in the former: and this would naturally shew itself even in passing words of address. To find in the word “<i>beloved</i>”<i> more</i> confidence, as some do, can hardly be correct: the expression of feeling is<i> different</i> in kind, not comparable in degree: suiting an Epistle of warm affection and somewhat saddened reminding, rather than one of rising hope and confidence. I regret to be, on this point, at issue throughout this second Epistle, with my friend Bishop Ellicott, who seems to me too anxious to rescue the character of Timothy from the slightest imputation of weakness: thereby marring the delicate texture of many of St. Paul’s characteristic periods, in which tender reproof, vigorous reassurance, and fervent affection are exquisitely intermingled.
