<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (q. d., ‘and there is reason for my thus exhorting thee, seeing that thou hast shewn a spirit inconsistent with the character of that χάρισμα .’ The particle is passed over by Ellicott) <strong> God did not give</strong> (when we were admitted to the ministry: not ‘ <em> has not given</em> ’ ( δέδωκεν )) <strong> us the Spirit</strong> (q. d., ‘the spirit which He gave us was not:’ see Rom 8:15 and note. The usage of πνεῦμα without the art. in the sense of the spirit of man dwelt in by the Spirit of God, and as the Spirit of God working in the spirit of man, as e.g. continually in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:0">Romans 7:0</span> . (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:4-5">2 Timothy 1:4-5</span> ; 2Ti 1:9 bis, 13, 14), in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span> ; cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:17">1 Corinthians 6:17</span> , forbids our rendering <strong> πνεῦμα</strong> ‘ <em> a spirit</em> ’ (subjective), as Conyb. al.) <strong> of cowardice</strong> (the coincidence in sound with the πνεῦμα δουλείας of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span> , is remarkable, and the most decisive of all testimonies against De Wette’s unworthy and preposterous idea that this passage is an imitation from that. Rather I should account the circumstance a fine and deep indication of genuineness: the habitual assertion of the one axiom having made even its sound and chime so familiar to the Apostle’s ear, that he selects, when enouncing another like it, a word almost reproducing that other. There is also doubtless a touch of severity in this δειλίας , putting before Timotheus his timidity in such a light as to shame him: οὐχ ἵνα δειλιῶμεν τοὺς ὑπὲρ τῆς εὐσεβίας κινδύνους , Thdrt.), <strong> but</strong> (the spirit) <strong> of power</strong> (as opposed to the weakness implied in δειλία ), <strong> and love</strong> (as opposed to that false compliance with men, which shrinks from bold rebuke: that lofty self-abandonment of love for others, which will even sacrifice repute, and security, and all that belongs to self, in the noble struggle to do men good), <strong> and correction</strong> (the original meaning of <strong> σωφρονισμός</strong> , ‘ <em> admonition of others that they may become</em> <strong> σωφρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ,’ τὸ σωφρονίζειν τινά , cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:4">Titus 2:4</span> , must be retained, as necessary both on account of that usage of the verb, and on account of the context. It is this bearing bold testimony before others, from which Timotheus appears to have shrunk: cf. μὴ οὖν ἑπαισχυνθῇς τὸ μαρτύριον , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:8">2 Timothy 1:8</span> . It also suits the construction of the other two genitives (against Huther), which both express <em> that which the Spirit inspires a man with</em> . For the meaning itself, cf. Palm and Rost’s Lex. We have examples of it in Hippodamus (Stob. 43. 93, p, 250), τοὶ μὲν νέοι δέονται σωφρονισμῶ καὶ καταρτύσις : Plut. Cat. maj. 5, ἐπὶ διορθώσει καὶ σωφρονισμῷ τῶν ἄλλων : Appian, de rebus Punicis viii. 65, εἰσὶ γὰρ οἳ καὶ τόδε νομίζουσιν , αὐτὸν ἐς Ῥωμαίων σωφρονισμὸν ἐθελῆσαι γείτονα καὶ ἀντίπαλον αὐτοῖς φόβον ἐς ἀεὶ καταλιπεῖν . The word in after times became a common one for <em> discipline</em> or <em> ecclesiastical correction</em> : see examples under σωφρονίζω and - ισμός in Suicer. Some, retaining this proper meaning, understand by it that the Spirit σωφρονίζει ἡμᾶς : so (alt.) Chrys., Thl. ( ἢ ἵνα σωφρονισμὸν ἔχωμεν τὸ πνεῦμα ); but this does not suit the construction of the other genitives, in which it is not power over us, or love towards us, that is meant, but power and love <em> wrought in us</em> as towards others, and opposed to cowardice and fear of man. Thl. gives as another alternative the right meaning ἢ ἵνα καὶ ἄλλοις ὦμεν σωφρονισταὶ καὶ παιδευταί . The making σωφρονισμός = σωφροσύνη , as E. V. and many Commentators, is surely not allowable, though Chrys. puts it doubtfully as an alternative. The only way in which it can come virtually to that, is by supposing the σωφρονισμός to be exercised <em> by ourselves over ourselves</em> , as Thdrt.: ἵνα σωφρονίσωμεν τῶν ἐν ἡμῖν κινουμένων παθημάτων τὴν ἀταξίαν . But this does not seem to me to suit the context so well as the meaning given above).</p>
