<b> 7.</b>]<b> For</b> ( ‘and there is reason for my thus exhorting thee, seeing that thou hast shewn a spirit inconsistent with the character of that<i> gift</i>.’ The particle is passed over by Ellicott)<b> God did not give</b> (when we were admitted to the ministry: not, ‘<i>hath not given</i>,’ as A.V., which loses the reference) us the spirit (not “<i>a spirit</i>:” see my Greek Test.) of cowardice (there is doubtless a touch of severity in the use of this word, putting before Timothy his timidity in such a light as to shame him);<b> but</b> (the spirit)<b> of power</b> (as opposed to the weakness implicd in cowardice),<b> and love</b> (as opposed to that false compliance with men, which shrinks from bold rebuke:—that lofty self-abandonment of love for others, which will even sacrifice repute, and security, and all that belongs to self, in the noble struggle to do men good),<b> and correction</b> (the original meaning of the word ‘admonition of others that they may become<b> sound-minded</b>,—must be retained, as necessary both on ac-count of usage, and on account of the context. It is this bearing bold testimony before others, from which Timothy appears to have shrunk: compare ver. 8. The word in after times became a common one for<i> discipline</i> or<i> ecclesiastical correction</i>. The making the word mean<i> a sound mind</i>, as A.V. and many Commentators, is surely not allowable, though Chrysostom puts it doubtfully as an alternative. The only way in which it can come virtually to that, is by supposing the<i> correction</i> to be exercised<i> by ourselves over ourselves</i>. But this does not seem to me to suit the context so well as the meaning given above).
