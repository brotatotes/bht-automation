The caution would not of necessity imply that Timothy had already shewn such a feeling: but it would be just in keeping with the delicate tact of the Apostle, to use such form of admonition, when in fact the blame had been already partly incurred. See note on ver. 1)<b> the testimony of our Lord</b> (i. e. the testimony which thou art to give concerning our Lord, genitive objective: not ‘<i>the testimony which He bore</i>,’ genitive subjective. The<b> our</b> in “<i>our Lord</i>” is inserted because being about to introduce<i> himself,</i> he binds by this word Timothy and himself together),<b> nor of me His prisoner</b> (I would hardly say, with some Commentators, that this refers only to the services which the Apostle expected from Timothy in coming to him at Rome: such thought may have been in his mind, and may have mingled with his motive in making the exhortation; but I believe the main reference to be to his duty as upholding St. Paul and his teaching in the face of personal danger and persecution. It is impossible to deny that the above personal reference does enter again and but I cannot believe it to be more than secondary. On the expression “<i>His prisoner</i>,” see Eph. iii. 1 note: the genitive implies not possession, but the reason for which he was imprisoned, compare Philem. 13, “<i>the bonds of the Gospel</i>”):<b> but suffer hardship with me for the Gospel</b> (this extends the sphere of his fellow-suffering with the Apostle beyond his mere visiting Rome)<b> according to the power of God</b> (<i>what</i> power? that which God has manifested in our salvation, as described below [gen. subj.], or that which God imparts to us [gen. obj.],—<i>God’s power,</i> or<i> the power which we get from God?</i> On all grounds, the former seems to me the juster and worthier sense: the former, as implying indeed the latter<i> a fortiori</i>—that God, who by His strong hand and mighty arm has done all this for us, will help us through all trouble incurred for Him);<b> who saved us</b> (all believers: there is no reason for limiting this<b> us</b> to Paul and Timothy. What follows is in the strictest coherence. ‘Be not cowardly nor ashamed of the Gospel, but join me in endurance on its behalf, according to God’s power, who has given such proofs of that power and of its exercise towards us, in saving us,—calling us in Christ,—destroying death— &c., of which endurance I am an example [11–13]—which example do thou follow’ [13, 14)),<b> and called us</b> (this, as indeed the whole context, shews that it is the Father who is spoken of: see note on Gal. i. 6),<b> with an holy</b> (the word<b> calling</b> expressing the<i> state</i>, rather than merely the summon-ing into it [as does<i> ‘vocation’</i> also], and<b> holy</b> is its quality)<b> calling</b> (see Eph. iv. 1; i, 18: Rom. viii. 23–30, and notes),<b> not according to</b> (after the measure of, in accordance with)<b> our works, but according to</b> (after the measure of, in pursuance of)<b> his own purpose</b> (i. e., “none compelling Him, none counselling with Him, but of His own purpose; moving from His own will, out of His goodness.” Chrysostom),<b> and</b> (according to)<b> the grace which was given to us</b> (this expression, which properly belongs only to an<i> actual imparting</i>, is used, because that which God determines in Eternity, is as good as already accomplished in time. No weakening of<i> given</i> into<i> predestined</i> must be thought of)<b> in Christ Jesus</b> (as its element and condition, see Eph. i. 4; iii. 11)<b> before eternal times</b> ( “that is, from eternity.” Chrysostom, It is hardly possible in the presence of Scripture analogy to take this expression as meaning<i> ‘during</i> the Jewish dispensation:’ still less, that ‘the scheme of redemption was arranged by God immediately after the fall, before any ages or dispensations.’ Even Calvin’s interpretation, “<i>the perpetual series of years since the foundation of the world</i>,” fails in reaching the full meaning. In the parallel, Rom. xvi. 25, the mystery of redemption is described as having been “<i>kept silent during eternal times</i>”—which obviously includes ages previous to the<i> foundation of the world</i>, as well as after its—see Eph. iii. 11, compared with i. 4: 1 Cor. ii. 7),<b> but</b> (contrast to the concealment from eternity in the manifestation in time)<b> manifested now</b> (see Col. i. 26; Tit. i. 3)<b> by the appearing</b> (in the flesh. The original word,<i> epiphaneia</i>, is here only used thus: still it does not refer to the birth only, but to the whole manifestation)<b> of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who abolished</b> [indeed]<b> death</b> (compare especially 1 Cor. xv. 26. By the death of Christ, Death has lost his sting, and is henceforth of no more account: consequently the mere act of natural death is evermore treated by the Lord Himself and His Apostles as of no account: see John xi. 26; Rom. viii. 2, 38; 1 Cor. xv. 55; Heb. ii. 14: and its actual and total abolition foretold, Rev. xxi. 4.<b> Death</b> must be kept here to its literal sense, and its spiritual only so far understood, as involved. in the other. The delivering from the<i> fear of death</i> is manifestly not to the purpose),<b> but</b> (contrast to the gloom involved in<i> death</i>)<b> brought to light</b> (threw light upon, and thus made visible what was before hidden)<b> life</b> (i. e. the new and glorious life of the Spirit, begun here below and enduring for ever: the only life worthy of being so called), a<b> nd incorruptibility</b> (immortality—of the new life, not merely of the risen body: that is not in question here, but is, though a glorious yet only a secondary consequence of this<i> incorruptibility</i>; see Rom. viii. 11)<b> hy means of the</b> (preaching of the)<b> Gospel</b> (which makes these glorious things known to men. These words are better taken as belonging only to “<i>brought life and incorruption to light</i>,” not to “<i>abolished death</i>.” For this former, the abolition of death, is an absolute act of Christ, the latter a manifestation to those who see it):<b> for which</b> (viz. the<i> Gospel</i>, the publication of this good news to men)<b> I was appointed an herald, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles</b> (see the same expression, and note, in 1 Tim. ii. 7. The connexion in which he here introduces himself is noticed above, on ver. 8. It is to bring in his own example and endurance in sufferings, and grounds of trust, for a pattern to Timothy):<b> on which account</b> (viz. because I<i> was appointed</i>, as above)<b> I also</b> (besides doing the active work of such a mission)<b> am suffering these things</b> (viz. the things implied in the term “<i>His prisoner</i>,” ver. 8, and further specified by way of explanation and encouragement to Timothy below, ver. 15):<b> but I am not ashamed</b> (compare the command “<i>Be not ashamed</i>,” ver. 8):<b> for I know whom I have trusted</b> (hardly to be formally expressed so strongly as De Wette, ‘<i>in whom I have put my trust</i>,’ though the meaning, in the spiritual explanation, is virtually the same: the metaphor here is that of a pledge deposited, and the depositor<i> trusting</i> the depositary: and it is best to keep to the figure. The reference is to God, as Tit. iii. 8; Acts xxvii. 25?),<b> and am persuaded that He is able to keep my deposit</b> (so literally. But how are the words to be taken,—and what is meant by them? Does<b> my</b> import, the deposit which<i> He</i> has entrusted to<i> me</i>, or the deposit which<i> I</i> have entrusted to<i> Him</i>? Let us consider the latter first. What is there which the Apostle can be said to have entrusted to God? Some say, (a) his<i> eternal reward</i>, the crown laid up for him, ch. iv, 8: but then we should have this reward represented as a matter not of God’s free grace, but of his own, delivered to God to keep: (b) his<i> soul</i>, as in 1 Pet. iv. 19: Luke xxiii, 46 [see this treated below]: (c) his<i> salvation</i> [see below]: (d) the believers who had been converted by his means, which hardly needs refutation, as altogether unsupported by the context. Then, under the<i> former</i> head, which would make<i> my</i> possessive,—that which<i> He</i> has committed to<i> me</i>, and which is<i> my</i> deposit to be guarded by me,—we have the following meanings assigned:— (e)<i> the Holy Spirit</i>. So Theodoret: (f)<i> the faith and its proclamation to the world</i>. So Chrysostom, as an alternative: (g) the<i> apostolic office</i> which the Apostle regarded as a thing entrusted to him, a stewardship, 1 Cor. ix. V7 (h) the<i> faithful</i> who had been converted by him in the view of their having been<i> committed to him by Christ</i>: (i) his<i> own soul</i>, as entrusted to him by God. On all these, and this view of the<i> deposit</i> generally, I may remark that we may fairly be guided by the same words “<i>the trust which was committed to thee, keep</i>” in ver. 14 as to their sense here. As, in ver. 14, these words are said of the subject of the sentence, viz. Timothy, keeping a deposit entrusted to him,—so here they must he said of the subject of the sentence, viz. God, keeping a deposit entrusted to Him. Otherwise, while keeping the mere word<b> deposit</b> to the same formal meaning in both places, we shall, most harshly and unnaturally, be requiring the phrase to bear, in two almost consecutive verses, two totally different meanings. The analogy therefore of ver. 14, makes the second group of meanings entirely against it, and in fact necessitates the adoption of the first alternative, viz. the objective genitive,—and the<i> deposit committed by the Apostle to God</i>. And when we enquire what this deposit was, we have the reply, I conceive, in the previous words<b> whom I have trusted</b>. He had entrusted HIMSELF, body, soul, and spirit, to the keeping of his heavenly Father, and lay safe in his hands, confident of His abiding and effectual care. A strong confirmation of this view is gained from 1 Thess. v. 23. In an English<i> version</i>, it is necessary to adopt one or other of the alternatives, for the sake of perspicuity. I have therefore retained the words of the A.V.)<b> against</b> (in a temporal sense: not simply<i> ‘until’</i>)<b> that day</b> (viz. the day of Christ’s appearing; see especially ch. iv. 8).
