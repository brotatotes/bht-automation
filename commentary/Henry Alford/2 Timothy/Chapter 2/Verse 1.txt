<b> 1</b>.]<b> Thou therefore</b> (the command follows, primarily on his own example just propounded, and secondarily on that of Onesiphorus, in contrast to those who had been ashamed of and deserted him),<b> my child, be strengthened</b> (the original indicates an abiding state, not a mere insulated act,<i> go on gaining strength</i>)<b> in the grace which is in Christ Jesus</b> (more than “<i>by</i> the grace<i> of</i> Christ Jesus:” the grace which is laid up in Christ, the empowering influence in the Christian life, being necessary for its whole course and progress, is regarded as the<i> element in</i> which it is lived: to<i> grow</i>, 2 Pet. ult.<b> Grace</b> must not be taken, with some Commentators, for his<i> ministerial office</i>).<b> And the things which thou heardest from me with many witnesses</b> (i. e. with the intervention or attestation of many witnesses. These witnesses are not, as Chrysostom and others hold, the congregations whom Timothy had heard the Apostle teaching, nor are they testimonies from the law and prophets: nor the other Apostles: much less the Christian martyrs: but<i> the presbyters and others present at his ordination</i>, compare 1 Tim. iv. 14; vi. 12; and ch. i. 6),<b> these deliver in trust</b> (see above ch. i. 14)<b> to faithful men</b> (i. e. not merely ‘believers,’ but ‘trustworthy men,’ men who will “<i>keep the goodly trust committed to them</i>”),<b> such as shall be</b> (not merely ‘are,’ but ‘shall be’—give every hope of turning out)<b> able to teach them to others also</b> (also carries the mind on to a further step of the same process—imply-ing ‘in their turn.’ These “<i>others</i>” would be<i> other trustworthy men</i> like themselves).—The connexion of this verse with the foregoing and the following has been questioned. I believe it to be this: ‘The true keeping of the deposit entrusted to thee will involve thy handing it on unimpaired to others, who may in their turn hand it on again. But in order to this, thou must be strong in grace—thou must be a fellow-sufferer with me in hardships—thou must strive lawfully—thou must not be entangled with this life’s matters.’ So that ver. 2 serves to prepare him to hear of the necessity of endurance and faithful adhesion to his duty as a Christian soldier, considering that he has his deposit not only to keep, but to deliver down unimpaired.—It is obviously a perversion of the sense to regard this verse as referring merely to his journey to Rome—that<i> during that time</i> he should, &c.: the future,<i> shall be able</i>, and the very contemplation of a similar step on the part of these men at a future time, are against such a supposition—Mack constructs 2 long argument out of this verse to shew that there are<i> two sources</i> of Christian instruction in the Church, written teaching and oral, and ends with affirming that those who neglect the latter for the former, have always shewn that they in reality set up their own opinion above all teaching. But he forgets that these two methods of teaching are in fact but one and the same.<i> Scripture</i> has been<i> God’s way of fixing tradition</i>, and rendering it trustworthy at any distance of time; of obviating the very danger which in this Epistle we see so imminent, viz. of one of those teachers, who were links in this chain of transmission, becoming inefficient and transmitting it inadequately. This very Epistle is therefore a warning to us not to trust oral tradition, seeing that it was so dependent on men, and to accept no way of conserving it but that which God’s providence has pointed out to us in the canonical books of Scripture.
