<b> 10</b>.]<b> For this reason</b> (what reason? “Because while I am bound the Gospel runneth,” says Bengel, and with this others agree. But neither 1) is this sound logic, nor 2) is it in accordance with the Apostle’s usage of the expression “<i>for this cause that</i>.” 1) The fact, that the word of God is not bound, is clearly not the reason why he suffers these things for the elect: nor can we say with Huther, that the<i> consciousness</i> of this fact is that in which he endures all. De Wette takes the predominant idea to be, the dispersion and success of God’s word, in and by which the Apostle is encouraged to suffer. But this would render the connexion very loose. 2) In 1 Tim. i. 16, and Philem. 15, the reference of “<i>for this cause</i>” is evidently to<i> what follows</i>: compare also Rom. iv. 16, 2 Cor. xiii. 10. I would therefore refer the words to the following, and consider them, as in the above instances, as a marked way of indicating the reason presently to be given: ‘for this purpose,... that;’ so Chrysostom and others)<b> I endure all things</b> (not merely suffer [objective]: but readiness and persistence [subjective] are implied in the word, and the universal<i> all things</i> belongs to this subjective meaning— ‘I am enduring, ready to bear, all things’)<b> for the sake of the elect</b> (see especially Tit. i. 1. The Apostle does not refer merely to those elect of God who are not yet converted, but generally to the whole category, both those who are already turned to him, and those who are yet to be turned: compare the parallel declaration in Col. i. 24),<b> that they also</b> (as well as ourselves with reference to what is to follow, the certainty that we, who suffer with Him, shall reign with Him)<b> may obtain the salvation which is in</b> (as its element and condition of ex-istence)<b> Christ Jesus with eternal glory</b> (salvation here, in its spiritual presence and power— “<i>by grace ye have been saved</i>,” Eph. ii. 6: and glory hereafter, the full development and expansion of salvation, Rom. viii. 21).<b> Faithful is the saying</b> (another of those current Christian sayings, probably the utterances originally of the Spirit by those who spoke<i> prophecies</i> in the Church—and, as in 1 Tim. iii. 16, bearing with it so much of balance and rhythmical arrangement, as to seem to be a portion of some hymn):<b> For</b> (Chrysostom and others regard this<b> for</b> as rendering a reason why the<i> saying is faithful</i>, understanding<i> faithful is the saying</i> of what has<i> gone before</i>, viz. the certainty that<i> he who obtains salvation shall also win eternal glory</i>. But this is most unnatural. The<b> for</b> is not merely explicative, but as in 1 Tim. iv. 9, renders a reason for the assertion that the<i> saying is faithful</i>,—in the declaration of the fact in well-known words: for the fact is so, that if&c.)<b> if we died with Him</b> (pointing to<i> some one definite event</i>: the reference must be to that participation in Christ’s death which takes place<i> at baptism</i> in all those who are His, and which those who follow Him in sufferings emphatically shew that they then did really take on them: see Rom. vi. 3, 4, 8: Col. ii. 12, Certainly if the past tense stood alone, it might be taken as<i> anticipatory</i>, looking back on life from that future day in which the<i> living with</i><i> him</i> will be realized: but coupled as it is with the<i> present</i>, “<i>we endure</i>,” and the future, “<i>we shall deny</i>,” we can hardly take it otherwise than literally as to time, of an event already past, and if so, strictly as in the parallel Rom. vi. 8, where the reference is clear),<b> we shall also live with Him</b> (hereafter in glory):<b> if we endure</b> (with Him: see Rom. viii. 17),<b> we shall also reign with Him</b> (see Rom. vv. 17; viii. 17. In the former pair, death and life are opposed: in this, subjection [implied in<i> endurance</i>] and dominion):<b> if we shall deny</b> (Him),<b> He also will deny us</b> (see Matt. x. 33):<b> if we disbelieve</b> (not, His Resurrection, nor His Divinity, but Him generally),<b> He remains faithful</b> (to His own word cited above):<b> for He cannot deny Himself</b> (i. e. if we desert faith in<i> Him</i>,<i> He</i> will not break faith with<i> us</i>; He having declared that whosoever denies Him shall be denied by Him, and we have pledged ourselves to confess Him,—we may become unbelieving, and break our pledge, but He will not break His: as He has said, it shall surely be. See Rom. iii. 3).
