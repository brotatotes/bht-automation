Very various interpretations have been given. Some explain it the<i> fundamental doctrine of the Resurrec-tion</i>: others,<i> the promises of God</i>: others, the<i> immovable faith of God</i>: others,<i> Christ</i>, 1 Cor. iii. 11: some,<i> the Christian religion</i>: others, again,<i> God’s election.</i> Rather is it the congregation of the faithful, considered as a foundation of a building placed by God,—the<i> house</i> spoken of in the next verse.
