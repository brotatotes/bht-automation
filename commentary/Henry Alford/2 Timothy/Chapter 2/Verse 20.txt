<p><strong> 20</strong> .] Those who are truly the Lord’s are known to Him and depart from iniquity: but in the visible church there are many unworthy members. This is illustrated by the following similitude. <strong> But</strong> (contrast to the preceding definition of the Lord’s people) <strong> in a great house</strong> (= ἐν τῇ οἰκουμένῃ πάσῃ , Chrys., who strenuously upholds that view; so also Thdrt. and the Greek Commentators, Grot., al.: but far better understood of the church, for the reason given by Calv.: “contextus quidem huc potius nos ducit, ut de ecclesia intelligamus: neque enim de extraneis disputat Paulus, sed de ipsa Dei familia:” so also Cypr., Aug., Ambr., all. The idea then is much the same as that in the parable of the drag-net, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:47-49">Matthew 13:47-49</span> ; not in the parable of the tares of the field, as De W.: for there it is expressly said, ὁ ἀγρὸς ἐστὶν ὁ κόσμος ) <strong> there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware; and some for honour, some for dishonour</strong> (viz. in the use of the vessels themselves: not, as Mack, al., to bring honour or dishonour on the house or its inhabitants. Estius, anxious to avoid the idea of heretics being in the church, would understand the two classes in each sentence as those distinguished by gifts, and those not so distinguished: and so Corn.-a-lap., al.: but this seems alien from the context: cf. especially the next verse. On the comparison, see Ellic.’s references).</p>
