 21 .] Here the thing signified is mingled with the similitude: the voluntary act described belonging, not to the vessels, but to the members of the church who are designated by them.  If then (  οὖν deduces a consequence from the similitude: q. d. ‘his positis’)  any man (member of the church)  shall have purified himself (not as Chrys., παντελῶς καθάρῃ : but as Bengel, ‘purgando sese  ex ierit de numero horum:’ the ἐκ corresponds to the ἀπο below, and I have attempted to give that in the following)  from among these (viz. the latter mentioned vessels in each parallel; but more especially the σκεύη εἰς ἀτιμίαν , from what follows),  he shall be a vessel for honour (Chrys. remarks: ὁρᾷς ὅτι οὐ φύσεως οὐδὲ ὑλικῆς ἀνάγκης ἐστὶ τὸ εἶναι χρυσοῦν ἢ ὀστράκινον . ἀλλὰ τῆς ἡμετέρας προαιρέσεως (?); ἐκεῖ μὲν γὰρ τὸ ὀστράκινον οὐκ ἂν γένηται χρυσοῦν , οὐδὲ τοῦτο εἰς τὴν ἐκείνου καταπεσεῖν εὐτέλειαν δυνήσεται · ἐνταῦθα δὲ πολλὴ μεταβολὴ καὶ μετάστασις . σκεῦος ὀστράκινον ἦν ὁ Παῦλος , ἀλλ ʼ ἐγένετο χρυσοῦν . σκεῦος χρυσοῦν ἦν (?) ὁ Ἰούδας , ἀλλ ʼ ἐγένετο ὀστράκινον ),  hallowed (not to be joined, as Calv. and Lachmann, who expunges the comma after τιμήν , with εἰς τιμήν , seeing that εἰς τιμήν stands absolutely in the former verse.  ἡγιασμένος (reff.) is a favourite word with our Apostle to describe the saints of God),  useful (see instances of the meaning of this epithet in the two N. T. reff.)  for the master (of the house),  prepared for every good work ( κἂν μὴ πράττῃ , ἀλλ ʼ ὅμως ἐπιτήδειόν ἐστι , δεκτικόν . δεῖ οὖν πρὸς πάντα παρεσκευάσθαι , κἂν πρὸς θάνατον , κἂν πρὸς μαρτύριον · κἂν πρὸς παρθενίαν , κἂν πρὸς ταῦτα πάντα .
