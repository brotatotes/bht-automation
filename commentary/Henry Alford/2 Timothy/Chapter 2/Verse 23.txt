But</b> (contrast to the fact of<i> strife</i>)<b> the</b> (better than<i> a</i>. The meaning being much the same, the definite article in rendering gives the emphasis, and points out the individual servant, better than the indefinite)<b> servant of the Lord</b> (Jesus; see 1 Cor. vii. 22. It is evident from what follows, that the servant of the Lord here, in the Apostle’s view, is not so much every true Christian,—however applicable such a maxim may be to him also,—but the minister of Christ, as Timothy was: compare “<i>apt to teach</i>, &c.” below)<b> must not strive</b> (this maxim takes for granted, that the servant<i> must be like his Lord</i>, and argues from that);<b> but be gentle towards all, apt to teach</b> (so A.V. well: for, as Bengel, “the word signifies not only solidity and facility in teaching, but especially patience and assiduity.” In fact these latter must be, on account of the contrast which the Apostle is bringing out, regarded as prominent here),<b> patient of wrong</b> (so Conybeare; and perhaps we can hardly find a better expression, though ‘wrong’ does not by any means cover the whole meaning),<b> in meekness correcting</b> (not, as A.V.,<i> ‘instructing’</i>)<b> those who oppose themselves; if at any time</b> (literally, ‘<i>lest at any time</i>’)<b> God may give them repentance</b> (because their consciences were im-pure [see above on ver, 22] and lives evil)<b> in order to the knowledge of [the] truth</b> (see note, 1 Tim. ii. 4);<b> and they may return to soberness</b> (a similar word is used in 1 Cor. xv. 34: from their moral and spiritual intoxication)<b> out of the snare of the devil</b> (gen. subj., ‘the snare which the devil laid for them.’ There is properly no confusion of metaphor, the idea being that these persons have in a state of intoxication been entrapped, and are enabled, at their awaking sober, to escape),<b> having been</b> (during their spiritual intoxication)<b> taken captive by him in pursuance of God’s will</b> (the literal rendering is: “having been taken captive by him towards the will of that other.” And<i> that other</i> is God, who has already been mentioned in ver. 25. In the former editions of my Greek Test. I took another view, but have now changed my opinion. It is God who overrules the workings of God’s enemy, and who hath made all things for Himself—even the wicked for the day of evil. On the varieties of rendering, see the note in my Greek Test.).
