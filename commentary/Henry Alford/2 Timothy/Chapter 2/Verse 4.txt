 4.]<b> No soldier when on service is</b> (suffers himself to be: ‘is,’ as his normal state)<b> entangled in the businesses of life; that he may please him who called him to be a soldier</b> (who originally enrolled him as a soldier: the word signifies<i> to levy soldiers</i>, or<i> raise a troop</i>, and “<i>he who chose him to be a soldier</i>,” designates the commander of such troop.—The taking of these precepts according to the letter, to signify that no minister of Christ may have a secular occupation, is quite beside the purpose: for 1) it is not ministers, but all soldiers of Christ who are spoken of: 2) the position of the verb shews that it is not the fact of the<i> existence</i> of such occupation, but the being<i> entangled</i> in it, which is before the Apostle’s mind: 3) the Apostle’s own example sufficiently confutes such an idea. Only then does it become unlawful, when such occupation, from its engrossing the man, becomes a hindrance to the work of the ministry,—or from its nature is incompatible with it).
