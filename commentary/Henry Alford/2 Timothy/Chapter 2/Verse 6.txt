<p><strong> 6</strong> .] Another comparison shewing the necessity of active labour as an antecedent to reward. <strong> The husbandman who is engaged in labour</strong> (who is actually employed in gathering in the fruit: not κοπιάσαντα ) <strong> must first partake of the fruits</strong> (which he is gathering in: the whole result of his ministry, not here further specified. The saying is akin to βοῦν ἀλοῶντα μὴ φιμώσεις the right of first participation in the harvest belongs to him who is labouring in the field: do not thou therefore, by relaxing this labour, forfeit that right. By this rendering, keeping strictly to the sense of the <em> present</em> part., all difficulty as to the position of πρῶτον is removed. Many Commentators (Calv., E. V. marg., al., Grot., al., take πρῶτον for ‘ <em> ita demum</em> ’) not observing this have supposed, in the sense, a transposition of πρῶτον , and given it as if it were τὸν γεωργὸν δεῖ , κοπιῶντα πρῶτον , τῶν καρπῶν μεταλ ., or as Wahl and Winer (so in older editions of his grammar, e.g. edn. 3, p. 458: but now, edn. 6, § 61. 5, he merely states the two renderings, without giving an opinion), τὸν γ . τὸν θέλοντα τῶν κ . μεταλ ., δεῖ πρῶτον κοπιᾷν : but in both cases κοπιάσαντα would seem to be, if not absolutely required, yet more natural. Thdrt. and Œc. understand πρῶτον of the preference which the teacher has over the taught, πρὸ γὰρ τῶν κεκτημένων οἱ γηπόνοι μεταλαγχάνουσι τῶν καρπῶν . Ambr., Pel., Mosh. believe the bodily support of ministers to be imported by τῶν κ . μεταλ .: but Chrys. answers this well, οὐκ ἔχει λόγον · πῶς γὰρ οὐχ ἁπλῶς γεωργὸν εἶπεν , ἀλλὰ τὸν κοπιῶντα ; but his own idea hardly seems to be contained in the words, πρὸς τὴν μέλλησιν ἵνα μηδεὶς δυσχεραίνῃ , ἤδη , φησίν , ἀπολαμβάνεις , ἢ ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ κόπῳ ἡ ἀντίδοσις : and certainly there is no allusion to that of Athanasius (in De W.), that it is the duty of a teacher first to apply to himself that which he teaches to others: nor to that of Bengel, ‘Paulus Timothei animam excoluit, c. i. 6, ergo fructus ei imprimis ex Timotheo debentur’).</p>
