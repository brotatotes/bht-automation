That day and hour being hidden from all men, and even from the Son Himself, Mark xiii, 32,—the Spirit of prophecy, which is the Spirit of the Son, did not reveal to the Apostles its place in the ages of time. They, like the subsequent generations of the Church, were kept waiting for it, and for the most part wrote and spoke of it as soon to appear; not however without many and sufficient hints furnished by the Spirit, of an interval, and that no short one, first to elapse. In this place, these last days are set before Timothy as being on their way, and indeed their premonitory symptoms already appearing. The discovery which the lapse of centuries and the ways of Providence have made to us,— “<i>my Lord delayeth His coming</i>,”—misleads none but unfaithful servants: while the only modification in the understanding of the premonitory symptoms, is, that<i> for us</i>, He with whom a thousand years are as one day has spread them, without changing their substance or their trath, over many consecutive ages.
