The period referred to here is, from all N. T. analogy (cf. 2 Peter 3:3 ; Jud 1:18 ), that immediately preceding the coming of the Lord. That day and hour being hidden from all men, and even from the Son Himself, Mark 13:32 , the Spirit of prophecy, which is the Spirit of the Son, did not reveal to the Apostles its place in the ages of time. They, like the subsequent generations of the Church, were kept waiting for it, and for the most part wrote and spoke of it as soon to appear; not however without many and sufficient hints furnished by the Spirit, of an interval, and that no short one, first to elapse. In this place, these last days are set before Timotheus as being on their way, and indeed their premonitory symptoms already appearing. The discovery which the lapse of centuries and the ways of providence have made to us, χρονίζει ὁ κύριός μου ἐλθεῖν , misleads none but unfaithful servants: while the only modification in the understanding of the premonitory symptoms, is, that  for us , He with whom a thousand years are as one day has spread them, without changing their substance or their truth, over many consecutive ages.

See note on 2Th 2:2 ):
