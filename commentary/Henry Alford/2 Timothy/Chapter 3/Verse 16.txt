<b> 16</b>.] The immense value to Timothy of this early instruction is shewn by a declaration of the profit of Scripture in furthering the spiritual life. There is considerable doubt about the construction of the first clause in this verse, the grounds of which it is hardly possible to bring before an English reader. Is it to be taken, (1)<b> every scripture</b> (subject) (is)<b> inspired by God</b> (predicate),<b> and profitable</b>: or (2)<b> every scripture inspired by God</b> (subject)<b> is also profitable</b> (predicate)? The former is followed by Chrysostom, Gregory of Nyssa, Athanasius, Estius, Calvin, &c., and by the A.V. The latter by Origen, Theodoret, by Grotius, Erasmus, &c., and the ancient Syriac version, the Latin Vulgate, and Luther. In deciding between these two, the following considerations must be weighed by the English reader, exclusive of those which require a knowledge of the arrangement and requirement of the Greek: (a) the requirement of the context. The object of the present verse plainly is to set before ‘Timothy the value of his early instruction, as a motive to his remaining faithful to it. It is then very possible, that the Apostle might, wish to exalt the dignity of the Scripture by asserting of it that it was<i> inspired by God</i>, and then out of this lofty predicate might unfold that it<i> was also profitable</i>, &c.;—its various uses in the spiritual life. On the other hand it may be urged, that, thus the two epithets do not hang naturally together, the first consisting of the one word<i> God-inspired</i>, and the other being expanded into a whole sentence: especially as in order at all to give symmetry to the whole, the end stated in ver. 17 must be understood as the purposed result of the<i> inspiration</i> as well as of the<i> profit</i> of the Scriptures, which is hardly natural: (b) the requirements of the grammatical construction: see in my Greek Test.—I own on the whole the balance seems to me to incline on the side of (2), unobjectionable as it is in construction, and of the two, better suited to the context. I therefore follow it, hesitatingly, I confess, but feeling that: it is not to be lightly overthrown.<b> Every Scripture</b> (not ‘every writing:’ the word never occurs in the New Test. except in the sense of ‘Scripture.’ It may mean, perhaps, all Scripture: but, in the presence of such an expression as “another Scripture saith,” John xix. 37, it is safer to keep to the meaning, unobjectionable both gram-matically and contextually, ‘every Scripture’—i. e, ‘every part of Scripture’)<b> given by inspiration of God</b> (this word<i> inspired</i>, like that in the Greek, is an expression and idea connected with<i> breath</i>, the power of the divine Spirit being conceived of as a breath of life: the word thus amounts to ‘breathed through,’ ‘full of the Spirit” It (the idea) is common to Jews, Greeks, and Romans. Josephus speaks of the prophets as having learnt according to the<i> afflatus</i> (breathing into them) from God. Plato and Plutarch speak of<i> inspired wisdom and inspired dreams</i>; Cicero says, “No one ever was a great man without some divine afflatus.” “Inspired” is first found as a predicate of persons: compare Matt. xxii. 43; 2 Pet. i, 21: then it was also applied to things. On the meaning of the word as applied to the Scriptures, see Introd. to Vol. I. ‘On the inspiration of the Gospels.’ As applied to the prophets, the sense would not materially differ, except “that we ever regard one speaking<i> prophecy</i>, strictly so called, as more immediately and thoroughly the mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit, seeing that the future is wholly hidden from men, and God does not in this case use or inspire<i> human testimony to facts</i>, but suggests<i> the whole substance</i> of what is said,<i> direct</i> from Himself)<b> is also</b> (besides this its quality of inspiration: on the construction, see above)<b> profitable for</b> (towards)<b> teaching</b> (this, the<i> teaching of the person</i> reading the Scriptures, not the<i> making him a teacher</i>, is evidently the meaning. It is not Timothy’s ability as a teacher, but his stability as a Christian, which is here in question),<b> for conviction</b> ( “for it convicts our sinful life,” Theodoret. The above remark applies here also),<b> for correction</b> ( “for it exhorts wanderers to return into the right way,” Theodoret),<b> for discipline</b> (see Eph. vi. 4, and note)<b> which is in righteousness</b> (which is versed in, as its element and condition, righteousness, and so disciplines a man to be holy, just, and true):<b> that</b> (result of the profitableness of Scripture: reasons why God has, having Himself inspired it, endowed it with this profitableness)<b> the man of God</b> (1 Tim. vi. 11 and note)<b> may be complete</b> (perfect at every point),<b> thoroughly made ready to every good work</b> (rather to be generally understood than officially: the man of God is not only a teacher, but any spiritual man: and the whole of the present passage regards the universal spiritual life. In ch. iv. 1 ff. he returns to the official duties of Timothy: but here he is on that which is the common basis of all duty).
