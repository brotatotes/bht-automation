<b> 2.</b>]<b> For</b> (reason for the epithet “<i>grievous</i>”)<b> men shall be lovers of their own selves, lovers of money, empty boasters, haughty, evil speakers</b> (not<br><br><i> ‘blasphemous</i>,’ though the Greek word is “<i>blasphemoi</i>;” it has not the reference to things sacred unless the context necessarily leads to that meaning just at this point: the sins mentioned are more against men than against God),<b> disobedient to parents</b> ( “the character of the times is much to be gathered from the manners of youth,” says Bengel),<b> ungrateful, unholy, without natural affection, implacable</b> (it does not appear that the word ever means “<i>truce-breakers</i>,’ but rather, ‘<i>that will make</i>’ or ‘<i>admit no truce</i>:’ i.e. implacable),<b> slanderers, incontinent, inhuman</b> (or,<b> fierce</b>),<b> no lovers of good</b> (so literally),<b> traitors, headlong</b> (either in action, or in passion [temper], which would in fact amount to the same),<b> besotted by pride</b> (see note, 1 Tim. iii. 6),<b> lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; having a</b> (or,<b> the?</b>)<b> form</b> (outward embodiment: the same meaning as in Rom. ii. 26, but here confined, by the contrast following, to the mere outward semblance; whereas there, no contrast occurring, the outward embodiment is the real representation)<b> of godliness, but having denied</b> (not present, ‘denying, as A.V.,—<i> ‘renouncing</i>,’ as Conybeare; their condemnation is, that they are living in the semblance of God’s fear, but<i> have repudiated</i> its reality)<b> the power of it</b> (its living and renewing in-fluence over the heart and life).—Compare throughout this description, Rom. i. 30, 31. Huther remarks, “We can hardly trace any formal rule of arrangement through these predicates. Here and there, it is true, a few cognate ideas are grouped together: the two first are connected by the prefix, ‘<i>lovers of</i>? then follow three words betokening high-mindedness: ‘<i>dis-obedient to parents</i>’ is followed by ‘<i>unthankful</i>’ this word opens a long series of negative epithets, but interrupted by ‘<i>slanderers</i>:’ the following seem some of them to be connected in the original by likeness of sound: others by connexion of meaning, as<i> ‘headlong</i>,’ and ‘<i>besotted with pride</i>’ But this very interpenetration serves to depict more vividly the whole manifoldness of the manifestation of evil”):<b> from these also</b> (as well as from those things and persons of whom he was before warned, ch. ii. 16, 21, 28) turn away (compare 1 Tim. vi. 20. This command shews that the Apostle treats the symptoms of the last times as not future exclusively, but in some respects present: see note above, ver. 1).
