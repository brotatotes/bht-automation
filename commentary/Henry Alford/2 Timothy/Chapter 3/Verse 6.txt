<b> 6.</b>]<b> For</b> (reason of the foregoing command, seeing that they are already among you)<b> among the number cf these are they who creep</b> ( “see how he points at the shamelessness of their conduct by this word,—their dishononrableness, their craft, their trickery.” Chrysostom) into [men’s] houses, and take captive (as it were prisoners; a word admirably describing the influence acquired by sneaking proselytizers over those presently described: attach to themselves entirely, so that they follow them as if dragged about by them)<b> silly women</b> (in the Greek, a diminutive of the word signifying women, denoting con-tempt)<b> laden with sins</b> (De Wette alone seems to have given the true reason of the insertion of this particular. The stress is on<i> laden</i>: they are burdened, their con- sciences oppressed, with sins, and in this morbid state they lie open to the insidious attacks of these proselytizers who promise them ease of conscience if they will follow them),<b> led about by lusts of all kinds</b> (I should rather imagine, from the context, that the reference here is not so much to ‘fleshly lusts’ properly so called,—though from what we know of such feminine spiritual attachments, ancient [see below] and modern, such must by no means be excluded,—as to the ever-shifting passion for change in doctrine and manner of teaching, which is the eminent characteristic of these captives to designing spiritual teachers,—the running after popular and fashionable men and popular and fashionable tenets, which draw them in flocks in the most opposite and inconsistent directions. Who has not seen this exemplified in the growth of Irvingism, Methodism, Evangelicalism, High-Church-ism, and all the other-isms?),<b> evermore</b><b> learning</b> (always with some new point absorbing them, which seems to them the most important, to the depreciation of what they held and seemed to know before),<b> and never yet</b> (with all their learning)<b> able to come to the thorough knowledge</b> (the decisive and stable apprehension, in which they might be grounded and settled against further novelties)<b> of the truth</b> (this again is referred by Chrysostom and others, to moral deadening of their apprehension by profligate lives. It may be so, in the deeper ground of the psychological reason for this their fickle and imperfect condition: but I should rather think that the Apostle here indicates their character as connected with the fact of their captivity to these teachers.—With regard to the fact itself, we have abundant testimony that the Gnostic heresy in its progress, as indeed all new and strange systems, laid hold chiefly of the female sex: see the instances quoted in my Greek Test. De Wette remarks, “This is an admirable characterization of zealous soul-hunters (who have been principally found, and are still found, among the Roman Catholics) and their victims. We must not however divide the different traits among different classes or individuals: it is their combination only which is characteristic.’” “One would say,” says Calvin, “that Paul was here designedly painting the portraiture of the life of the cloister”).
