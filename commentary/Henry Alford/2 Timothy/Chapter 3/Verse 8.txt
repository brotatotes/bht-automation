<b> 8.</b>]<b> But</b> (i. e. it is no wonder that there should be now such opponents to the truth, for their prototypes existed also in ancient times)<b> as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses</b> (these are believed to be traditional names of the Egyptian magicians mentioned in Exod. vii. 11, 22. Origen says, “That which we read in St. Paul, ‘Jannes and Mambres withstood Moses,’ is not found in the public Scriptures, but in a secret book inscribed ‘Jannes and Mambres,’ but Theodoret’s account is more probable, that St. Paul learnt their names, not out of the Holy Scriptures, but from the unwritten teaching of the Jews,” especially as the names are found in the Targum of Jonathan on Exod. vii. 11; xxii. 22. The traditional history of Jannes and Jambres, collected out of the rabbinical books, is as follows: They were the sons of Balaam—prophesied to Pharaoh the birth of Moses, in consequence of which he gave the order for the destruction of the Jewish children,—and thenceforward appear as the counsellors of much of the evil,—in Egypt, and in the desert, after the Exodus,—which happened to Israel. They were variously reported to have perished in the Red Sea, or to have been killed in the tumult consequent on the making the golden calf, which they had advised),<b> thus these also withstand the truth: being men corrupted in mind, worthless</b> (not abiding the test, reprobate)<b> concerning the faith</b> (in respect of the faith).
