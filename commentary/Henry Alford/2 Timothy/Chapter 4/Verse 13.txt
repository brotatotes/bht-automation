<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> The cloak</strong> ( φελόνης is said to be a corrupted form of φαινόλης , lat. <em> pænula</em> , a thick outer cloak: but as early as Chrys., there has been a doubt whether this is the meaning here. He says, φελόνην ἐνταῦθα τὸ ἱμάτιον λέγει , τινὲς δέ φασι τὸ γλωσσόκομον (bag or case, Joh 13:29 ) ἔνθα τὰ βιβλία ἔκειτο : and so Syr. and all.: but it is against this idea, as indeed Bengel remarks, that the books should be <em> afterwards mentioned</em> . It would be unnatural, in case a bag of books had been left behind, to ask a friend to bring the bag, <em> also the books</em> , and <em> especially the parchments</em> : ‘the bag of books and parchments which I left’ would be its most obvious designation. A long discussion of the meanings of φελόνης , and of the question whether it is rightly supposed to be a corruption from φαινόλης , may be found in Wolf ad loc.: see also Ellic. The Jews also had the word פליון for a cloak) <strong> which I left</strong> (behind me: οἱ δι ʼ ἀσθένειαν ἀπολειφθέντες , Xen. Mem. iv. 1. 32: for what reason, is not clear: but in St. Paul’s life of perils, it may well be conceived that he may have been obliged to leave such things behind, against his intention) <strong> in Troas</strong> (respecting his having been at Troas lately, see Prolegg. to Past. Epp. § ii. 16, 30, 31) <strong> with</strong> (‘chez’) <strong> Karpus when thou art coming</strong> (setting out to come) <strong> bring, and the books</strong> (i.e. papyrus rolls: on these, and on μεμβράνας , see Dict. of Antiquities, art. Liber. τί δὲ αὐτῷ βιβλίων ἔδει μέλλοντι ἀποδημεῖν πρὸς τὸν θεόν ; καὶ μάλιστα ἔδει , ὥστε αὐτὰ τοῖς πιστοῖς παραθέσθαι , καὶ ἀντὶ τῆς αὐτοῦ διδασκαλίας ἔχειν αὐτά . Chrys. This may have been so: but there is nothing inconsistent with his near prospect of death, in a desire to have his cloak and books during the approaching winter), <strong> especially the parchments</strong> (which as more costly, probably contained the more valuable writings: perhaps the sacred books themselves. On a possible allusion to these books, &amp;c., which the Apostle had with him in his imprisonment at Cæsarea, see note, Act 26:24 ).</p>
