<b> 16</b>.]<b> In my first defence</b> (open self-defence, before a court of justice. For a discussion of this whole matter, see the Introduction. I will only remark here, that any other defence than one made at Rome, in the latter years of the Apostle’s life, is out of the question)<b> no one came forward with me</b> (as<i> patronus</i> or friend, to support him by his presence, or pleading),<b> but all men deserted me: may it not be laid to their charge</b> (by God: “it was not their malice but their cowardice which kept them away,” says Theodoret).<b> But the Lord</b> (Jesus)<b> stood by me, and strengthened</b> ( ‘<i>put strength in</i>.’ a word especially used of and by our Apostle)<b> me; that by my means the proclamation</b> (of the Gospel)<b> might be delivered in full measure</b> (see on ver. 5),<b> and all the Gentiles might hear</b> (one is tempted, with Theodoret, to interpret this of his preservation for further missionary journeys [Theodoret thinks this defence happened<i> during</i> his journey to Spain]: but the spirit of the whole context seems to forbid this, and to compel us to confine this<i> delivering in full</i> measure to the effect of the single occasion referred to,—his acquittal before the crowd of people, in whose presence the trials took place: so Bengel— “one occasion is often of the greatest moment: the<i> Gentiles</i>—of whom Rome was the capital”):<b> and I was delivered from the mouth of the lion</b> (the Fathers mostly understood this of<i> Nero</i>. And Esth. [apocryphal] xiv. 13, A.V., is quoted, “where Esther says concerning Artaxerxes, Put a word into my mouth<i> before the lion</i>.’ Whitby:—or, seeing that according to the chronology adopted by some, Nero was not in Rome at the time [see Introd. to Pastoral Epistles,§ii. 33], of his<i> locum tenens</i>,<i> Ælius Cæsareanus</i>,—or of the<i> Jewish accuser</i>. But these are hardly probable: nor again is it, that the Apostle was literally in danger of being thrown to wild beasts, and established his right as a Roman citizen to be exempted from that punishment: nor again is the idea, that the expression is figurative for<i> great danger,—the jaws of death</i>, or the like: for the Apostle<i> did not fear</i> death, but: looked forward to it as the end of his course, and certainly would not have spoken of it under this image. The<i> context</i> seems to me to demand another and very different interpretation. None stood with him—all forsook him: but the Lord stood by him and strengthened him:<i> for what</i>? that he might<i> witness a good confession</i>, and that the<i> preaching</i> might be expanded to the utmost. The result of this strengthening was, that he was delivered<i> from the mouth of the lion</i>: he was strengthened, w<i> itnessed a good confession, in spite of desertion and discouragement.</i> Then let us pass on to his confidence for the future, the expression of which is bound on to this sentence by the same verb,<b> shall deliver me</b>, indicating the identity of God’s deliverance,—and “<b>from every</b> evil work,” indicating the<i> generalization of the danger of which this was a particular case</i>. And how is the danger generally described? as “every<b> evil work</b>:” and it is implied that the falling into such danger would preclude him from enduring to Christ’s heavenly kingdom. It was then an<i> evil work</i> from which he was on this occasion delivered. What<i> evil work</i>?<i> The falling into the power of the tempter</i>; the giving way, in his own weakness and the desertion of all, and betraying the Gospel for which he was. sent as a witness. The<i> lion</i> then is the<i> devil</i>; “who goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,” 1 Pet. v. 8).
