<b> 18</b>.]<b> The cloak</b> (some, as early as Chrysostom, who mentions the view, thought this word signified a bag, in which the books were: so the Syriac Version renders it: but it is against this idea, as indeed Bengel remarks, that the books should be<i> afterwards mentioned.</i> It would be unnatural, in case a bag of books had been left behind, to ask a friend to bring the bag,<i> also the books</i>, and<i> especially the parchments</i>: ‘the bag of books and parchments which I left’ would be its most obvious designation)<b> which I left</b> (behind me: for what reason, is not clear: but in St. Paul’s life of perils, it may well be conceived that he may have been obliged to leave such things behind, against his intention)<b> in Troas</b> (respecting his having been at Troas lately, see Introd. to Pastoral Epistles,§ii. 16, 30, 31) with ( ‘chez’)<b> Carpus, when thou art coming</b> (setting out tocome),<b> bring, and the books</b> (i. e. papyrus rolls. ‘What did he want with books,” says Chrysostom, “when he was about to depart to God? He wanted them much, to give them to the faithful, that they might possess them instead of his teaching.’ This may have been so: but there is nothing inconsistent with his near prospect of death, in a desire to have his cloak and books during the approaching winter),<b> especially the parchments</b> (which as more costly, probably contained the more valuable writings: perhaps the sacred books themselves. On a possible allusion to these books, &c., which the Apostle had with him in his imprisonment at Casarea, see note, Acts xxvi. 24).<br><br><b> 18.</b>]<b> The Lord</b> (Jesus)<b> shall deliver me from every evil work</b> (see above: from every danger of faint-heartedness, and apostasy. The meaning adopted by some, that the<i> evil works</i> are the<i> works of his adversaries</i> plotting against him, is totally beside the purpose: he had no such confidence (ver. 6), nor would his conservation to Christ’s heavenly kingdom depend in the least upon such deliverance. Besides which, the correspondence of this declaration of confidence to the concluding petition of the Lord’s Prayer cannot surely be fortuitous, and then<i> evil</i>, here joined to<i> work</i> as neuter, must be subjective, evil resulting from our<i> falling</i> into temptation, not evil happening to us from without),<b> and shall preserve me safe</b> (shall<b> save</b><i> me</i>: but in its not uncommon, pregnant sense of ‘bring safe’)<b> unto his kingdom in heaven</b> (though it may be conceded to De Wette that this expression is not otherwise found in St. Paul, it is one to which his existing expressions easily lead on: e.g. Phil. i. 23, compared with iii. 20):<b> to whom be the glory unto the ages of ages. Amen</b> (it is again objected, that in St. Paul we never find doxologies ascribing glory to Christ, but always to God. This however is not strictly true: compare Rom. ix. 5. And even if it were, the whole train of thought here leading naturally on to the ascription of such doxology, why should it not occur for the first and only time? It would seem to be an axiom with some critics, that a writer can never use an expression once only. If the expression be entirely out of keeping with his usual thoughts and diction, this may be a sound inference: but this is certainly not the case in the present, instance. Besides, the petition of the Lord’s Prayer having been transferred to our Lord as its fulfiller [compare John xiv. 13, 14], the doxology, which seems to have come into liturgical use almost as soon as the prayer itself, would naturally suggest a corresponding doxology here).
