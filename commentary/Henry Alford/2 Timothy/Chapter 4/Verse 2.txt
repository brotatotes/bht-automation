I cannot forbear also transcribing a very beautiful passage from the same Father: “But if men continue in the same courses—even after our exhortation, not even then must we abstain from counselling them. For fountains flow, even if no one draw from them: and rivers run, though no one drinks. So too the preacher ought, even if no one attend to him, to fulfil all his own duty; for our rule, who have taken in hand the ministry of the word, is laid down by God the lover of men, that his part is never to slacken, nor to be silent, whether men hear, or pass by.” This latter passage gives the more correct reference,—not so much to<i> his</i> opportunities, as the former, but to theirs);<b> convict, rebuke, exhort; in</b> (not<i> ‘with</i>,’ it is not the<i> accompaniment</i> of the actions, but the clement, the temper in which they are to be performed)<b> all</b> (possible)<b> longsuffering and doctrine</b> (not subjective ‘<i>perseverance in teaching</i>,’ as Conybeare; but<i> ‘doctrine’</i> itself: it [objective] is to be the clement in which these acts take place, as well as<i> longsuffering</i> [subjective].
