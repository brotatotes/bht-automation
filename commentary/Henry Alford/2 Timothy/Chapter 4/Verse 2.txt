<b> 2</b>.]<b> proclaim the word</b> (of God);<b> be urgent</b> (this is generally referred to the last clause— ‘be diligent in preaching?’ but the commandment most probably refers, not to preaching only, but in the whole work of the ministry)<b> in season, out of season</b> ( “have no defined season, let all time be thy season; not only in peace; not only in security; nor yet when sitting in the church only; even if thou be in perils, even if in prison, even if bound with a chain, even if being led out to die, at every such opportunity, convict, and shrink not from rebuking: for then it is that rebuke is in season, when the conviction goes forward, and the fact is demonstrated.” Chrysostom. I cannot forbear also transcribing a very beautiful passage from the same Father: “But if men continue in the same courses—even after our exhortation, not even then must we abstain from counselling them. For fountains flow, even if no one draw from them: and rivers run, though no one drinks. So too the preacher ought, even if no one attend to him, to fulfil all his own duty; for our rule, who have taken in hand the ministry of the word, is laid down by God the lover of men, that his part is never to slacken, nor to be silent, whether men hear, or pass by.” This latter passage gives the more correct reference,—not so much to<i> his</i> opportunities, as the former, but to theirs);<b> convict, rebuke, exhort; in</b> (not<i> ‘with</i>,’ it is not the<i> accompaniment</i> of the actions, but the clement, the temper in which they are to be performed)<b> all</b> (possible)<b> longsuffering and doctrine</b> (not subjective ‘<i>perseverance in teaching</i>,’ as Conybeare; but<i> ‘doctrine’</i> itself: it [objective] is to be the clement in which these acts take place, as well as<i> longsuffering</i> [subjective]. The junction is harsh, but not therefore to be avoided).
