There seems no reason why any one of these should be chosen to the exclusion of the rest: we may well combine (1) and (4), at the same time bearing (2) and (3) in mind:— ‘I am no longer here to withstand these things: be thou a worthy successor of me, no longer depending on, but carrying out for thyself my directions: follow my steps, inherit their result, and the honour of their end.’<br><br><b> 5</b>.]<b> But</b> (as contrasted with the description preceding)<b> do thou</b> (emphatic)<b> be sober</b> (or,<b> watch</b>: it is difficult to give the full meaning of the word in a version.
