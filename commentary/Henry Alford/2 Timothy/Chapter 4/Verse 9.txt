<b> 9 ff]</b><b> Do thine endeavour</b> (so also Tit. iii. 12)<b> to come to me quickly</b> (this desire that Timothy should come to him, appears in ch. i. 4, 8: its reason is now speecified):<b> for</b> (I am almost alone)<b> Demas</b> (mentioned Col. iv. 14 with Luke, as saluting the Colossians, and Philem. 24, also with Luke (feat others], as one of the Apostle’s<i> fellow-workmen</i>)<b> deserted me, loving</b> (i. e. ‘<i>through love of</i>’)<b> this pre-sent world</b> ( “fond of ease, safety, and security, he chose rather to luxuriate at home, than to suffer hardship with me, and help me to bear my present perils.” Chrysostom),<b> and went to Thessalonica</b> ( ‘his birthplace’ says De Wette: so it would seem thought Chrysostom, above: but how ascertained? He may have gone there for the sake of traffic, which idea the mention of his<i> love of this world</i> would seem to support);<b> Crescens</b> (not named elsewhere. He is said traditionally to have preached the Gospel in Galatia, and more recently, to have founded the church at Vienne in Gaul: this latter interpretation of Galatia Theodoret also adopts. All this traditional fabric is probably raised by conjecture on this passage)<b> to Galatia</b> (see Introd, to Gal.§ii. 1),<b> Titus</b> (Introd. to Titus,§i.)<b> to Dalmatia</b> (part of the Roman province of Illyricum, on the coast of the Adriatic, south of Liburnia.—Theodoret: says, referring to the words “<i>loving this present world</i>,” “These last [Crescens and Titus] are free from this charge; for they were sent by him to preach.” But this hardly agrees with the necessity of supply-ing “<i>departed</i>” from the former sentence, which verb must be understood with both names: see also the contrast in ver. 12. They had certainly left the Apostle of their own accord: why, does not appear).<b> Luke</b> (see Introd. to Luke’s Gospel,§i.)<b> is alone with me</b> (De Wette’s question, ‘where then was Aristarchus [Acts xxvii. 2. Col. iv. 10. Philem. 24]?’ is one which we have no means of answering: but we may venture this remark: a forger, such as De Wette supposes the writer of this Epistle to be, would have taken good care to ac-count for him).<b> Mark</b> (Col. iy. 10, note: Philem. 24. John Mark, Acts xv. 38)<b> take up</b> (on thy way),<b> and bring with thee: for he is to me useful for the ministry</b> (for help to me in my apostolic labours). But (apparently a slight contrast is intended to those above, who departed of their own accord)<b> Tychicus</b> (see Eph. vi. 21 note)<b> I sent to Ephesus</b> (on the various attempts to give an account of this jour-ney, and its bearing on the question, whether Timothy was at Ephesus at this time, see Introd. to this Epistle,§i. 5).
