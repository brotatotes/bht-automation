There is no meaning of ‘heap upon themselves,’ ‘to their own cost,’ as Luth., ‘ <em> werden sie ihnen selbst Lehrer aufladen</em> :’so Heydenr. also) <strong> teachers, having itching ears</strong> ( ζητοῦντές τι ἀκοῦσαι καθ ʼ ἡδονήν , Hesych.: ‘sermones quærunt vitia sua titillantes,’ Grot. This in fact amounts to the same as Chryrs.’s, τῆς ἡδονῆς χάριν λέγοντας καὶ τέρποντας τὴν ἀκοὴν ἐπιζητοῦντες , though De W. draws a distinction between them. Plut. de superst, p. 167 b (Wetst.), μουσικὴν φησὶν ὁ Πλάτων … ἀνθρώποις οὐ τρυφῆς ἕνεκα καὶ κνήσεως ὤτων δοθῆναι : see more examples in Wetst.), <strong> and shall avert their ears from the truth, and be turned aside</strong> (ref. and note) <strong> to fables</strong> (the art. seems to imply that they would be at least <em> like</em> the fables already believed: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span> , and cf. Ellic. here).</p>
