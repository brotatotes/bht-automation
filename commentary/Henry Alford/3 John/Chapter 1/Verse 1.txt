 ΙΩΑΝΝΟΥ Γ
	 1 .] ADDRESS.  The elder (see prolegg. to the two Epistles)  to Caius the beloved (on Caius, see prolegg. The epithet  τῷ ἀγαπητῷ seems to be used this first time in a general sense: cf. ἐγώ below),  whom I (for my own part: Caius was generally beloved, and the Apostle declares that he personally joins in the affection for him)  love in (  the )  truth (see 2 John 1:1 , note. Ἐν ἀληθείᾳ ἀγαπᾷ ὁ κατὰ κύριον ἀγαπῶν ἐνδιαθέτῳ ἀγάπῃ , Œc.).
