<b>We</b> wants no explanation, such as our commands, our Epistles, or the like: in rejecting the Apostleâ€™s person, he rejected all his influence). On this account, if I should come, I will bring to mind (i. e. as Bede, to the knowledge of all, by plainly stating them)<b> his works which he doeth</b> (what they were, is explained by the participle following),<b> prating against us</b> (this is the best rendering, which conveys not only that he used reproaches, but also that the reproaches were mere tattle, worth nothing, irrelevant. See 1 Tim. v. 13)<b> with wicked speeches: and not satisfied with this</b> (his conduct and words),<b> neither doth he himself receive the brethren</b> (here<b> receive</b> seems best: taken in its literal sense, of entertaining hospitably, see 2 John 10,<b> The brethren</b> are probably the same as in ver. 5, the travelling missionaries),<b> and hinders</b> (by forbidding: see 1 Thess. ii, 16)<b> those that would</b> (receive them),<b> and casts them</b> (those that would receive the brethren: not, the travelling brethren. themselves)<b> out of the church</b> (manifestly, hy excommunication, which owing to his influence among them he had the power to inflict. There is no difficulty, nor any occasion to take the word as pointing at that which Diotrephes was<i> attempting</i> to do or<i> threatening</i> to do, and so as spoken in irony: the present tense indicates his habit, as above. He was evidently one in high power, and able to forbid, and to. punish, the reception of the travelling brethren. See Introduction).
