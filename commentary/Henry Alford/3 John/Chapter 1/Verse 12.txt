<b> 12.</b>]<i> The praise of Demetrius.</i><b> Testimony hath been borne to Demetrius by all</b> (namely, who know him, and have brought report concerning him),<b> and by the truth itself</b> (it is not very easy to explain this expression. We may understand it that the reality of facts themselves supports the testimony of all. But there are two reasons against this view: 1) that it does not correspond to the objective fact asserted in the statement, nor to the parallelizing of this testimony with that of<i> all and that of the Apostle</i>: and 2) that thus the Christian and divine sense of the truth, which St. John seems always to put forward, would be entirely sunk. Some would understand that Demetrius had done much for the truth, and his deeds were his witness: but this is hardly a witness of<i> the truth</i> to him. Others take refuge in the extraordinary supposition, that the Holy Spirit had revealed to the Apostle the truth respecting Demetrius. Huther regards the testimony borne by the truth to be that furnished by<b> all</b>, whose evidence was decisive, not from their credit as men. but because they all spoke of and from the truth of Christ dwelling in them. This would reduce this new testimony to the former, and would in fact besides include the following in it likewise. The best interpretation is that of Düsterdieck. The objective Truth of God, which is the divine rule of the walk of all believers, gives a good testimony to him who really walks in the truth. This witness lies in the accordance of his walk with the requirement of God’s Truth. It was the mirror in which the walk of Demetrius was reflected: and his form, thus seen in the mirror of God’s Truth, in which the perfect form of Christ is held up to us [1 John ii. 6, iii. 3, 16), appeared in the likeness of Christ; so that, the mirror itself seemed to place in a clear light his Christian virtue and uprightness, and thus to bear witness to him):<b> yea, we too</b> (besides the two testimonies foregoing)<b> bear testimony; and thou knowest that our testimony is true.</b>
