<b> 14.</b>]<b> but I hope immediately to see thee, and</b> (then)<b> we shall speak mouth to mouth</b> (see 2 John 12).<b> Peace be to thee</b> (beautifully paraphrased by Lyra, “The internal peace of the conscience, the fraternal peace of friendship, the supernal peace of glory.” Remember our Lord’s legacy, John xiv. 27, and His greeting after the Resurrection, John xx. 19. 26).<b> The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name</b> (as if I had written their names here). ‘The reason why St. John mentions<b> friends</b> [see John xi. 11, xv. 15, Acts xxvii. 3], and not<i> brethren</i> [1 Cor. xvi. 20, Phil. iv, 21, Eph. vi. 23], is probably to be found in the personal character of the Epistle, not addressed as from an Apostle to a church, but as from a friend to his friend, in which mutual friends on both sides would be the senders and receivers of salutation.
