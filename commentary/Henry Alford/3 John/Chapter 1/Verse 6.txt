<b> 6.</b>]<b> who</b> (the above-named strange brethren)<b> bore testimony to thy love in the presence of the church</b> (viz. where St. John at the time of writing. They were Evangelists, ver. 7: and thus would naturally give the church an account of their missionary journey, during which they were so hospitably treated by Caius):<b> whom thou wilt do well if thou forward on their way worthily of God</b> (in a manner worthy of Him whose messengers they are and whose servant thou art):<b> for on behalf of the Name</b> (o<i> f Christ</i>: see Acts. v. 41; ix. 16; xv. 28)<b> they went forth</b> (on their missionary journey),<b> taking nothing</b> receiving nothing by way of benefaction or hire: even as St. Paul in Achaia, 1 Cor. ix. 18; 2 Cor. xi. 7 ff.’ 1 Thess. ii, 9 ff.: against Huther, who denies the applicability of the comparison, seeing that in St. Paul’s case they were<i> Christian churches</i>: but so must these have been before they would contribute to the support of their missionaries. The peculiar word used for<b> nothing</b> implies that it was their own deliberate purpose; refusing to take any thing)<b> from the Heathens. We therefore (contrast to the heathens: therefore</b>, because they<i> take nothing</i> from the heathens)<b> ought to support</b> (the word does not seem to signify “receive hospitably,” as some have explained it)<b> such persons, that we may become fellow-workers</b> [<b>with them</b>]<b> for the truth.</b>
