 13 15 .]  Close of the Epistle .  I had (not, as Huther, for εἶχον ἄν : it is a pure imperfect, describing that which has not come to pass, but might have done so under certain conditions: cf. Acts 25:22 ; Romans 9:3 , also alleged by Düsterd. is not quite a case in point. He gives the meaning here well: “I had indeed much to write: that I have not written it is owing to this, that I wish not, &c.”)  many things to write to thee, howbeit I will not to write (present, not only “to write them,” which would be aorist, but to write at all, to write any more)  by means of ink and reed (see on 2Jn 1:12 ):  but (on the other hand)  I hope immediately to see thee, and (then)  we shall speak mouth to mouth (see 2Jn 1:12 ).  Peace be to thee (beautifully paraphrased by Lyra, “interna conscientiæ, pax fraterna amicitiæ, pax superna gloriæ.” Remember our Lord’s legacy, John 14:27 , and His greeting after the Resurrection, εἰρήνη ὑμῖν , John 20:19 ; Joh 20:26 ).  The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name (“non secus ac si nomina eorum præscripta essent.” Bengel). The reason why St. John mentions φίλοι (see John 11:11 ; John 15:15 ; Act 27:3 ), and not ἀδελφοί (1 Corinthians 16:20 ; Philippians 4:21 ; Eph 6:23 ), is probably to be found in the personal character of the Epistle, not addressed as from an Apostle to a church, but as from a friend to his friend, in which mutual friends on both sides would be the senders and receivers of salutation.
