 1.   τὸν μὲν πρ  .   λ  . ] The latter member of this sentence, τανῦν δέ , … is wanting (see Winer, § 63, I. 2, e. γ ), and the author proceeds at once to his narration, binding this second history to the first by recapitulating and enlarging the account given in the conclusion of the Gospel.
	 πάντων ] Whatever latitude may be given to this word, it must at all events exclude the notion that Luke had at this time seen the Gospels of Matt. or Mark, in which many things which Jesus did and taught are contained, which he had  not related in his πρῶτος λόγος . On Theophilus, see notes, Luke 1:3 .
	 ὧν ἤρξατο Ἰησ .] I cannot think ἤρξατο here to be merely pleonastic. Its position here shews that it is  emphatic , and the parallel cases (see reff.) all point to a distinct and appropriate meaning for the word. That meaning here seems to be, that the Gospel contained the ἀρχάς , the  outset , of all the doings and teachings of our Lord, as distinguished from this second treatise, which was to relate their sequel and results. Meyer understands it  which Jesus first of all men did , &c. But this introduces a meaning irrelevant to the context, besides  not giving the emphasis to ἤρξατο , but to Ἰησοῦς . The position of emphasis given to the verb shews, that the  beginning of the doing and teaching of Jesus must be contrasted with the  continuance of the  same , now about to be related.
