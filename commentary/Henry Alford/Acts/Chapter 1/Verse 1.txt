<b> 1. The former treatise....</b>] The latter member of this sentence,<b> but the present one</b>.... is wanting, and the Author proceeds at once to his narration, binding this second history to the first by recapitulating and enlarging the account given in the conclusion of the Gospel.<br><br><b> of all that Jesus....</b>] Whatever latitude may be given to the word<b> all</b>, it must at all events serve to refute the notion that St. Luke had at this time seen the Gospels of Matthew or Mark, in which many things which Jesus did and taught are contained, which he had<i> not</i> related in his former treatise. On Theophilus, see notes, Luke i. 3.<br><br><b> that Jesus began both to do and teach</b>] I cannot think<b> began</b> here to be merely superfluous. Its position here shews that it is<i> emphatic</i>, and the parallel cases (Matt. iv. 17: Mark i. 45: Luke xiii. 25; xxiii. 5) all point to a distinct and appropriate meaning for the word. That meaning here seems to be, that the Gospel contained the<i> beginnings</i>, the<i> outset</i>, of all the doings and teachings of our Lord, as distinguished from this second treatise, which was to relate their sequel and results. Meyer understands itâ€”<i>which Jesus first of all men did</i>, &c. But this introduces a meaning irrelevant to the context, besides<i> not giving</i> the emphasis to the word<b> began</b>, which it must have by the arrangement of the original, but to the word<b> Jesus</b>. The position of emphasis given to the verb shews, that the<i> beginning</i> of the doing and teaching of Jesus must be contrasted with the<i> continuance</i> of the<i> same</i>, now about to be related.
