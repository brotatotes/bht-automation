<b> 12.</b>] In so careful a writer (see Luke i. 3), there must be some reason why this minute specification of distance should be here inserted, when no such appears in the Gospel. And I believe this will be found, by combining the hint dropped by Chrysostom,— “It seems to me that these things must have happened on a Sabbath: for the Evangelist would not have thus stated the distance... except they had had their journey limited by its being the Sabbath day,”—with the declaration in the Gospel (xxiv. 50) that he led them out<i> as far as to Bethany</i>. This latter was (John xi. 18)<i> fifteen stadia</i> from Jerusalem, which is more than twice the Sabbath day’s journey (2000 cubits = about six furlongs). Now if the Ascension happened on the Sabbath, it is very possible that offence may have arisen at the statement in the Gospel: and that therefore the Evangelist gave here the more exact notice, that the spot, although forming part of the district of Bethany, was yet on that part of the Mount of Olives which fell within the limits of the Sabbath day’s journey. This of course must be a mere conjecture; but it will not be impugned by the fact of the Ascension being kept by the Church in after ages on a Thursday. This formed no hindrance to Chrysostom in making the above supposition: although the festival was certainly observed in his time.<i> Forty days</i> from the Resurrection is an expression which would suit as well the Saturday of the seventh week as the Thursday.—The distance of the Mount of Olives from Jerusalem is stated by Josephus at five stadia, in one passage,—at six stadia, in another; different points being taken as the limit. The present church of the Ascension rather exceeds the distance of six stadia from the city.
