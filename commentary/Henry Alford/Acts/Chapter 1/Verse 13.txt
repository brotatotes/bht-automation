<b> 13. when they were come in</b>] viz. ‘into the city.’<br><br><b> the upper chamber</b>] The idea that this was a chamber in<i> the Temple</i> has originated in low literal-harmonistic views, St. Luke having stated (Luke xxiv. 53) that they were “<i>continually in the temple</i>.” As if such an expression could be literally understood, or taken to mean more than that they were there at all appointed times (see ch. iii. 1). It is in the highest degree improbable that the disciples would be found<i> assembled</i> in<i> any public</i> place at this time. The upper chamber was<i> perhaps</i> that in which the last Supper had been taken;<i> probably</i> that in which they had been since then assembled (John xx. 19, 26), but<i> certainly</i> one in a<i> private house</i>. Lightfoot shews that it was the practice of the Jews to retire into a large chamber under the flat roof for purposes of deliberation or prayer. Epiphanius relates that “when Hadrian came to Jerusalem, he found the whole city levelled with the ground, and the temple of God trodden down, with the exception of a few houses, and the church of God, which was but small, where the disciples, on their return, after the Saviour had been received up from the Mount of Olives, went up into the upper chamber. For there it was built, that is, in the region Zion; which survived the desolation.... even to the time of Bishop Maximus, and the Emperor Constantine: like a cottage in a vineyard, as it is written.” And Nicephorus says that the Empress Helena enclosed in her larger church the room where took place the descent of the Holy Spirit in the upper chamber.<br><br><b> where they were sojourning</b>] not to be taken, as in A.V. ‘<i>where abode both Peter</i>,’&c.; which gives the idea that Peter, &c. were<i> already in the chamber</i>, and the rest<i> joined them there</i>:—but<b> on entering the city, they went up into the upper chamber, where they</b> (usually)<b> sojourned</b> (not ‘<i>dwelt</i>:’ they did not all dwell in one house; see John xix. 27, note),<b> namely, Peter</b>, &c.—On the catalogue of the Apostles, see Matt. x. 2, note.
