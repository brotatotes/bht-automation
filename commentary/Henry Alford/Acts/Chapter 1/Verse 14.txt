<b> 14. with the women</b>] viz. those spoken of by St. Luke himself, Luke viii. 2, 3,—where, besides those named, he mentions<i> many others</i>. Some have proposed to render the phrase “<i>with their wives:”</i> but many of these were certainly<i> not wives of the Apostles</i>; and that those women who were ‘last at the Cross and earliest at the tomb’ should not have been assembled with the company now, is very improbable.<br><br><b> and Mary the mother of Jesus</b>] The<b> and</b> gives eminence to<i> one</i> among those previously mentioned. This is the last mention of her in the N.T. The traditions, which describe her as (1) dying at the age of fifty-nine, in the fifth year of Claudius, or (2) accompanying St. John to Ephesus, and being buried there, are untrustworthy. Other accounts, with the authorities, may be seen in Butler’s Lives of the Saints, Aug. 15. The fable of the<i> Assumption</i> has<i> no foundation even in tradition</i>.<br><br><b> and his brethren</b>] This clearly shews, as does John vii. 5 compared with vi. 67, 70, that<i> none of the brethren of our Lord were of the number of the Twelve</i>. When they were converted, is quite uncertain. See the whole subject discussed in note on Matt. xiii. 55, and in the Introduction to the Epistle of James.
