 17. ]  ὅτι , not ‘  although ’ (Kuinoel), but  because : it gives the reason of the previous assertion, viz. that Judas held, and had betrayed, that place of high trust of which the prophecy spoke. Thus the  ὅτι has reference to the  substance of the prophecy , already in Peter’s mind, and serves to explain ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ and ἡ ἐπισκοπὴ αὐτοῦ .
	 ἔλαχεν τὸν κλῆρον ] not literally, but inasmuch as the  lot of every man is regarded as being cast and appointed by God.
	κλῆρος , first, the  lot itself; then,  that apportioned by lot ; then,  any species of apportionment , whether  possession , or  office , as here.
