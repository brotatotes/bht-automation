<b> 18.</b>] This verse<i> cannot be regarded as inserted by St. Luke</i>; for, 1. the place of its insertion would be most unnatural for an historical notice: 2. the form of its introduction in the original forbids the supposition: 3. the whole style of the verse is rhetorical, and not narrative, e.g. “<i>this man</i>,” “<i>the reward of iniquity</i>.”—The statement, that he<i> bought a field</i>, does not appear to agree with the account in Matt. xxvii, 6–8; nor, consistently with common honesty, can they be reconciled,<i> unless we knew more of the facts than we do</i>. If we compare the two, that of St. Matthew is the more particular, and more likely to give rise to this one,<i> as a general inference</i><i> from the buying of the field</i>, than<i> vice versâ</i>. Whether Judas, as Bengel supposes, began the purchase, and so gave occasion for its being completed by the Chief Priests, we cannot say: such a thing is of course<i> possible</i>, but is certainly not contemplated by St. Matthew’s account, where the priests settle to buy the field, on deliberation, what they should do with the money. At all events we hence clearly see that<i> St. Luke could not have been acquainted with the Gospel of St. Matthew at this time</i>, or surely this apparent discrepancy would not have been found. The various attempts to reconcile the two narratives, which may be seen in most of our English commentaries, are among the saddest examples of the shifts to which otherwise high-minded men are driven by an unworthy system. A notable example occurs in a solution lately proposed, that as the<i> Jews</i> are said to have crucified our Lord when they were only the occasion of his being crucified, so Judas may be said to have bought the field when he only gave occasion to its being bought by the Chief Priests. I need hardly say to any intelligent and ingenuous reader, that this is entirely precluded here by the words<b> with the reward of his iniquity</b>, which plainly bind on the purchase to Judas as his personal act.<br><br><b> and falling headlong</b>] The connexion of this with the former clause would seem to point to the death of Judas having taken place<i> in</i> the field which he bought. See also ver. 19.<br><br><b> falling headlong</b> will hardly bear the meaning assigned to it by those who wish to harmonize the two accounts,—viz. that, having hanged himself, he fell by the breaking of the rope. It would rather point, as the word used is explained, to a sudden fall forward on the face by a stroke from God, or by an accident. Nor again is it at all probable that the Apostle would recount what was a<i> mere accident accompanying his death</i>, when that death itself was the accursed one of<i> hanging</i>. What then are we to decide respecting the two accounts? That there should have been a double account actually current of the death of Judas at this early period, is<i> in the highest degree improbable</i>, and will only be assumed by those who take a very low view of the accuracy of the Evangelists. Dismissing then this solution, let us compare accounts themselves. In this case,<i> that</i> in Matt. xxvii. is<i> general</i>,—ours<i> particular</i>.<i> That</i> depends entirely on the exact sense to be assigned to the word which we render “<i>hanged himself</i>:” whereas<i> this</i><i> directly assigns the manner</i> of his death, without stating any cause for the falling on his face. It is obvious that, while the general term used by Matthew points mainly at<i> self-murder</i>, the account given here does not preclude the catastrophe related having happened, in some way, as a divine judgment,<i> during the suicidal attempt</i>. Further than this, with our present knowledge, we cannot go.<i> An accurate acquaintance with the actual circumstances</i> would account for the discrepancy, but<i> nothing else</i>.—Another kind of death is assigned to Judas by Œcumenius, quoting from Papias: “Papias, the disciple of the Apostle John, relates, that Judas, as he walked about, was a great example of God’s judgments on impiety in this world; for that he swelled up to a fearful size, and once on attempting to pass through (a gateway) at the same time with a waggon which left ample space, he was crushed by the waggon, so that his bowels gushed out.” This tradition may be in accordance with, and may have arisen from an exaggerated amplification of, our text. See more in the note in my Greek Test.<br><br><b> he burst asunder</b>: the word implies bursting with a noise. It is quite possible that this catastrophe happening in the field, as our narrative implies, may have suggested its employment as a burial-place for strangers, as being defiled.
