<b> 19.</b>] It is principally from this verse that it has been inferred that the two verses 18, 19 are<i> inserted by St. Luke</i>. But it is impossible to separate it from ver. 18; and I am disposed to regard both as belonging to Peter’s speech, but freely given by St. Luke, inserting<i> into the speech itself</i> the explanations, “<i>in their proper tongue</i>,” and “<i>that is to say, the field of blood</i>,” as if the speech had been spoken in Greek originally. This is much more natural, than to parenthesize these clauses; it is, in fact, what must be more or less done by all who report in a language different from that actually used by the speaker. The words and idioms of a mother tongue contain allusions and national peculiarities which never could have been in the mind of one speaking in a different language; but the ear tolerates these, or easily separates them, if critically exercised.<br><br><b> it was known....</b>] See Luke xxiv. 18.<br><br><b> The field of blood</b>] In Matt. xxvii. 8, the name ‘the field of blood’ is referred to the fact of its having been<i> bought with the price of blood</i>: here, to the fact of<i> Judas</i> having there<i> met with a signal and bloody death</i>. On the whole, I believe the result to which I have above inclined will be found the best to suit the phænomena of the two passages,—viz. that, with regard to the<i> purchase of the field</i>, the more circumstantial account in Matthew is to be adopted; with regard to the<i> death of Judas</i>, the more circumstantial account of Luke. The<i> clue which joins these has been lost to us</i>: and in this, only those will find any stumbling-block, whose faith in the veracity of the Evangelists is very weak indeed.<br><br> The field originally belonged to a potter, and was probably a piece of land which had been exhausted of its clay fit for his purposes, and so was useless. Jerome relates that it was still shewn on the South side of Mount Sion, in which neighbourhood there is even now a bed of white clay.
