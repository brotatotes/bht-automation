<b> 19.</b>] It is principally from this verse that it has been inferred that the two verses 18, 19 are<i> inserted by St. Luke</i>. But it is impossible to separate it from ver. 18; and I am disposed to regard both as belonging to Peter’s speech, but freely given by St. Luke, inserting<i> into the speech itself</i> the explanations, “<i>in their proper tongue</i>,” and “<i>that is to say, the field of blood</i>,” as if the speech had been spoken in Greek originally. This is much more natural, than to parenthesize these clauses; it is, in fact, what must be more or less done by all who report in a language different from that actually used by the speaker. The words and idioms of a mother tongue contain allusions and national peculiarities which never could have been in the mind of one speaking in a different language; but the ear tolerates these, or easily separates them, if critically exercised.
