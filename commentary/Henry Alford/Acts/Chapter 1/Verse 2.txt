<b> 2. he was taken up</b>] The use of the verb in this abbreviated form, without the addition of “<i>into heaven</i>,” testifies to the familiarity of the apostolic church with the Ascension as a formal and recognized event in our Lord’s course.<br><br><b> had given commandments unto the apostles</b>] See Luke xxiv. 48 ff., and ver. 4 below.<br><br> The words<b> through the Holy Ghost</b> may, in the original, be joined either with<b> had given commandments</b>, or with<b> had chosen</b>. There are ancient authorities both ways. In the<i> former</i> case, our Lord is said to have given His commands te the Apostles through, or in the power of, the Holy Ghost. Similarly He is said, Heb. ix. 14, “<i>through the Eternal Spirit</i> to have offered Himself without spot to God.” In the<i> latter</i>, He is said to have chosen the Apostles by the power of the Holy Ghost. Similarly, in ch. xx. 28, Paul tells the Ephesian elders, that the Holy Ghost had made them bishops in the Church of God. The former construction however appears much the best, as expressing not, as might at first seem, a mere commonplace, but the propriety of the fact,—that His last commands were given<b> in the power of</b> (see John xx. 22)<b> the Holy Ghost.</b>
