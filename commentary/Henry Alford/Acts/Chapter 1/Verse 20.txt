Psalms 69:0 is eminently a Messianic psalm, spoken in the first place of David and his kingdom and its enemies, and so, according to the universal canon of O. T. interpretation, of Him in whom that kingdom found its true fulfilment, and of His enemies. And Judas being the first and most notable of these, the Apostle applies eminently to him the words which in the Psalm are spoken in the plural of all such enemies. The same is true of Psalms 109:0 , and there  one adversary is even more pointedly marked out. See also Psalms 55:0 .
