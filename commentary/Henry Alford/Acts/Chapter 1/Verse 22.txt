 22.   βαπτ  .   Ἰωάν .] Not ‘  His being baptized by John ’ (as Wolf, Kuin., &c.); but  the baptism of John , as a well-known date, including of course the opening event of our Lord’s ministry,  His own baptism. That John continued to baptize for some time after that, can be no possible objection to the assignment of ‘John’s baptism’ generally, as the date of the commencement of the apostolic testimony (against De Wette). We may notice, that from this point the testimony of the Evangelists themselves in their Gospels properly begins, Matthew 3:1 , Mark 1:1 , Luke 3:1 , John 1:6 .
	 μάρτ  .   τῆς ἀναστ .] This one event was the passage-point between the Lord’s life of humiliation and His life of glory, the completion of His work below and beginning of His work above. And to ‘give witness with power’ of the Resurrection (ch. Act 4:33 ), would be to discourse of it  as being all this ; in order to which, the whole ministry of Jesus must be within the cycle of the Apostle’s experience.
	It is remarkable that Peter here lays down  experience of matters of fact , not eminence in any subjective grace or quality, as the condition of Apostleship. Still, the testimony was not to be  mere ordinary allegation of matters of fact: any who had seen the Lord since His resurrection were equal to this; but belonged to  a distinct office (see John 14:26 ; also ch. Acts 5:31 , note),  requiring the especial selection and grace of God .
