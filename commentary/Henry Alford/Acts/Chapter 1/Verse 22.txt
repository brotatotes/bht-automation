<p><strong> 22. </strong> <strong> βαπτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰωάν</strong> .] Not ‘ <em> His being baptized by John</em> ’ (as Wolf, Kuin., &amp;c.); but <strong> the baptism of John</strong> , as a well-known date, including of course the opening event of our Lord’s ministry, <em> His own</em> baptism. That John continued to baptize for some time after that, can be no possible objection to the assignment of ‘John’s baptism’ generally, as the date of the commencement of the apostolic testimony (against De Wette). We may notice, that from this point the testimony of the Evangelists themselves in their Gospels properly begins, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:1">Matthew 3:1</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:1">Mark 1:1</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:1">Luke 3:1</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:6">John 1:6</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> μάρτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῆς ἀναστ</strong> .] This one event was the passage-point between the Lord’s life of humiliation and His life of glory, the completion of His work below and beginning of His work above. And to ‘give witness with power’ of the Resurrection (ch. Act 4:33 ), would be to discourse of it <em> as being all this</em> ; in order to which, the whole ministry of Jesus must be within the cycle of the Apostle’s experience.
	</p>
<p>It is remarkable that Peter here lays down <em> experience of matters of fact</em> , not eminence in any subjective grace or quality, as the condition of Apostleship. Still, the testimony was not to be <em> mere</em> ordinary allegation of matters of fact: any who had seen the Lord since His resurrection were equal to this; but belonged to <em> a distinct office</em> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span> ; also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span> , note), <em> requiring the especial selection and grace of God</em> .</p>
