<b> 24.</b>] It is a question,<i> to Whom this prayer was directed</i>. I think all probability is in favour of the Apostle (for Peter certainly was the spokesman) having addressed<i> his glorified Lord</i>. And with this the language of the prayer agrees. No stress can, it is true, be laid on the word<b> Lord</b> being used: see ch. iv. 29, where unquestionably the Father is so addressed: but the expression,<b> thou hast chosen</b>, compared with<b> Did I not choose you twelve?</b> John vi. 70, seems to me almost decisive. See also ver. 2; Luke vi. 13; John xiii. 18, xv. 16, 19. The instance cited on the other side by Meyer, “<i>God made choice</i>”...., ch. xv. 7, is not to the point, as not relating to the matter here in hand; nor are the passages cited by De Wette, 2 Cor. i. 1; Eph. i. 1; 2 Tim. i. 1, where Paul refers his apostleship to<i> God</i>, since obviously all such appointment must be referred ultimately to<i> God</i>:—but the question for us is,—In these words,<i> did the disciples pray as they would have prayed before the Ascension, or had they Christ in their view?</i> The expression,<b> which knowest the hearts of all men</b> (used by Peter himself of<i> God</i>, ch. xv. 8), forms no objection: see John xxi. 17, also in the mouth of Peter himself. We are sure, from the words,<i> they worshipped Him</i>, Luke xxiv. 52, that even at this time, before the descent of the Spirit, the<i> highest kind of worship was paid to the ascended Redeemer</i>. Still I do not regard it as by any means<i> certain</i> that they addressed Christ, nor can the passage be alleged as convincing, in controversy with the Socinian.<br><br> The words are not, as in E.V., ‘<i>shew whether of these two Thou hast chosen</i>,’ but<b> appoint one of these two</b> [<b>him</b>]<b> whom Thou hast chosen</b>. The difference is of some import: they did not pray for a sign merely, to shew whether of the two was chosen, but that the Lord would, by means of their lot,<i> Himself appoint</i> the one of His choice.
