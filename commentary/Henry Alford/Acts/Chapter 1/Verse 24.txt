 24. ] It is a question,  to Whom this prayer was directed . I think all probability is in favour of the Apostle (for Peter certainly was the spokesman) having addressed  his glorified Lord . And with this the language of the prayer agrees. No stress can, it is true, be laid on  κύριε : see ch. Acts 4:29 , where unquestionably  the Father is so addressed: but the  ἐξελέξω , compared with οὐκ ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς τοὺς δώδεκα  ἐξελεξάμην , John 6:70 , seems to me almost decisive. See also Acts 1:2 ; Luke 6:13 ; John 13:18 ; John 15:16 ; John 15:19 . The instance cited on the other side by Meyer, ἐξελέξατο ὁ θεὸς διὰ τοῦ στόματός μου ἀκοῦσαι τὰ ἔθνη κ . τ . λ ., is not to the point, as not relating to the matter here in hand; nor are the passages cited by De Wette, 2 Corinthians 1:1 ; Ephesians 1:1 ; 2 Timothy 1:1 , where Paul refers his apostleship to  God , since obviously all such appointment must be referred ultimately to  God : but the question for us is, In these words,  did the disciples pray as they would have prayed before the Ascension , or  had they Christ in their view? The expression  καρδιογνῶστα (used by Peter himself of  God , ch. Act 15:8 ) forms no objection: see John 21:17 , also in the mouth of Peter himself. We are sure, from the προσκυνήσαντες αὐτόν of Luke 24:52 , that even at this time, before the descent of the Spirit, the  highest kind of worship was paid to the ascended Redeemer . Still, I do not regard it as by any means  certain that they addressed Christ, nor can the passage be alleged as convincing in controversy with the Socinian.
	 ἀνάδειξ . κ . τ . λ .] Not, as in E. V., ‘  shew whether of these two Thou hast chosen ,’  but appoint (see reff.)  one of these two (him) whom Thou hast chosen . The difference is of some import: they did not pray for a sign merely, to shew whether of the two was chosen, but that the Lord would, by means of their lot,  Himself appoint the one of His choice.
