<b> 25.</b>]<b> the place</b>, instead of<b> part</b>, is from internal evidence, as well as MS. authority, the preferable reading. It has been altered to suit ver. 17.<br><br><b> ministry</b>, implying the active duties;<b> apostleship</b>, the official dignity, of the office.<br><br><b> that he might go to his own place</b>] With the reading<b> place</b> in the former part of the verse, I think these words may be interpreted two ways: 1. that Judas<i> deserted this our</i><b> place</b>, our office and ministry,<i> to go to his own</i><b> place</b>, that part which he had chosen for himself, viz. the office and character of a traitor and enemy of God; 2. regarding the former word<b> place</b> as being selected to correspond to the more proper and dreadful use of the word<i> here</i>, that Judas<i> deserted</i> his appointed place, here among us, that he might go to<i> his own appointed place elsewhere</i>, viz.<i> among the dead in the place of torment</i>. Of these two interpretations, I very much prefer the second, on all accounts; as being more according to the likely usage of the word, and as more befitting the solemnity of such a prayer. At the same time, no<i> absolute sentence</i> is pronounced on the traitor, but that dark surmise expressed by the phrase<b> his own place</b>, which none can help feeling with regard to him. To understand “he” of Judas’s successor,—<i>that he</i> (the new Apostle)<i> might enter on his own place of dignity destined for him by God</i>, (1) is contrary to the form of the sentence in the original; (2) is inconsistent with the words, which are unexampled in this sense; (3) would divest a sentence, evidently solemn and pregnant, of all point and meaning, and reduce it to a mere tautology. It appears to have been very early understood as above; for Clement of Rome says of Peter, “Thus having borne a martyr’s testimony, he went to his appointed place of glory,” an expression evidently borrowed from our text. Lightfoot quotes from a Rabbinical work on Numb. xxv. 25, “<i>Balaam went to his own place</i>,” i.e. “<i>to hell</i>.”
