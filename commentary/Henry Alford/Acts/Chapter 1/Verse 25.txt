<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] <strong> τόπον</strong> is from internal evidence, as well us manuscript authority, the preferable reading. It has been altered to κλῆρον to suit <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:17">Acts 1:17</span> .

<p><strong> διακονίας</strong> , implying the active duties; <strong> ἀποστολῆς</strong> , the official dignity of the office: no figure of ἓν διὰ δυοῖν .

<p><strong> τὸν τόπον τὸν ἴδιον</strong> ] With the reading τόπον before, I think these words may be interpreted two ways: 1. that Judas <em> deserted this our</em> τόπος , our office and ministry, <em> to go to his own</em> τόπος , that part which he had chosen for himself, viz. the office and character of a traitor and enemy of God; 2. regarding the former word τόπος as being selected to correspond to the more proper and dreadful use of the word <em> here</em> , that Judas <em> deserted his</em> τόπος , his appointed place, here among us, that he might go to <em> his own appointed</em> τόπος <em> elsewhere</em> , viz. <em> among the dead in the place of torment</em> . Of these two interpretations, I very much prefer the second, on all accounts; as being more according to the likely usage of the word, and as more befitting the solemnity of such a prayer. At the same time, no <em> absolute sentence</em> is pronounced on the traitor, but that dark surmise expressed by the euphemism τὸν τόπον τ . ἴδ ., which none can help feeling with regard to him. To refer the words πορ . εἰς τ . τόπ . τ . ἴδ ., to the <em> successor</em> of Judas (Knatchbull, Hammond, al.), ‘ <em> ut occupet locum ipsi a Deo destinatum</em> ,’ (1) is contrary to the form of the sentence, which would require καὶ πορευθῆναι ; (2) is inconsistent with the words πορ . κ . τ . λ ., which are unexampled in this sense; (3) would divest a sentence, evidently solemn and pregnant, of all point and meaning, and reduce it to a mere tautology. It appears to have been very early understood as above; for Clement of Rome says of Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:0">1 Corinthians 5:0</span> ), οὕτω μαρτυρήσας ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὸν ὀφειλόμενον τόπον τῆς δόξης , an expression evidently borrowed from our text. Lightf., Hor. Hebr. in loc., quotes from the Rabbinical work Baal turim on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:25">Numbers 24:25</span> , ‘Balaam ivit in locum suum, i.e. in Gehennam.’</p>
