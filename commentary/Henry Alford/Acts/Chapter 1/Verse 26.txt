<b> 26. they cast lots for them</b>] These lots were probably tablets, with the names of the persons written on them, and shaken in a vessel, or in the lap of a robe (Prov. xvi. 33); he whose lot first leaped out being the person designated.<br><br><b> was voted in amongst the eleven apostles</b>] The<i> lot</i> being regarded as the divine choice, the suffrages of the assembly were unanimously given (not in<i> form</i>, but by cheerful acquiescence) to the candidate thus chosen, and he ‘voted in’ among the eleven Apostles, i.e. as a<i> twelfth</i>. That St. Luke does not absolutely<i> say so</i>, and never afterwards speaks of the<i> twelve</i> Apostles, is<b> surely no safe</b> ground en which to doubt this.—Stier was disposed to question whether this step of electing a twelfth Apostle was altogether suitable to the then waiting position of the Church, and whether Paul was not in reality the twelfth, chosen by the Lord Himself. But I do not see that any of his seven queries touch the matter. We have the precedent, of all others most applicable, of the twelve tribes, to shew that the number, though ever<i> nominally kept</i>, was<i> really exceeded</i>. And this incident would not occupy a prominent place in a book where St. Paul himself has so conspicuous a part, unless it were by himself considered as being what it professed to be, the filling up of the vacant Apostleship.
