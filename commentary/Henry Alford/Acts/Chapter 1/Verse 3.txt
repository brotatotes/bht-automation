<b> 3. by infallible proofs</b>] See Luke xxiv. 31, 39, 43.<br><br><b> being seen of them forty days</b>] It is hardly possible to give in English the exact force of the original, which implies that He was occasionally seen by them during a period of forty days. “He was not always with them as before the Resurrection,” says Chrysostom: for the “Evangelist does not say He was seen<i> for forty days</i>, but [<i>at times</i>]<i> during forty days</i>.” This is the only place where the duration of the interval between the Resurrection and the Ascension is specified.<br><br><b> the things pertaining to the kingdom of God</b>] What things these were, we are not told. Certainly, not future events in their detail,—as the next portion of the narrative shews us. I should rather believe them to have concerned the future founding and government of the Church: though even here the greatest Apostles were apparently left to the unfolding of the teaching of the Holy Spirit as years went on.
