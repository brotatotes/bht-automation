<b> 5.</b>] The Lord cites these words from the mouth of John himself, Luke iii. 16 and parallels;—and thus announces to them that, as John’s mission was accomplished in baptizing<i> with water</i>, so now the great end of His own mission, the<i> Baptism with the Holy Ghost</i>, was on the point of being accomplished. Calvin remarks, that He speaks of the Pentecostal effusion as<i> being</i> the Baptism with the Holy Ghost, because it was a great representation, on the whole Church, of the subsequent continued work of regeneration on individuals: and was as it were a common baptism of the whole Church. I may add, also because it was the<i> beginning</i> of a new period of spiritual influence, totally unlike any which had preceded. See ch. ii. 17.<br><br><b> not many days hence</b>] literally,<b> after these not many days</b>. This expression serves to bind on the time which should elapse to the day then current; as we say, ‘one of these days.’ Bengel observes, that the time was not precisely defined, for a trial of their faith.
