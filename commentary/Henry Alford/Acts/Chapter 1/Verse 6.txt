<b> 6.</b>] This<b> coming together</b> does not belong to another assembling, different from the former; but takes up again the “<i>assembling</i>” of ver. 4.<br><br><b> Lord, wilt thon restore</b>] literally,<b> dost thou restore?</b> The stress of the question is in the words, which in the original are prefixed for emphasis,<b> at this time</b>. That the Kingdom was,<i> in some sense</i>, and<i> at some time</i>, to be restored to Israel, was plain; nor does the Lord deny this implication (see on ver. 8). Their fault was, a too curious enquiry on a point reserved among the secrets of God. Lightfoot’s idea, that the disciples wondered at the Kingdom being about to be restored to the ungrateful Jews,<i> at this time</i>, now that they had crucified Him, &c., would make our Lord's answer irrelevant.—See Micah iv. 8.—Meyer would refer<b> at</b>, or<b> in this time</b>, to the interval designated by “<i>not many days hence</i>,” “during this time;” “wilt thou, during this time, restore?” But this does not seem natural. I should rather understand it,<b> at this present</b>,<b> period,—now</b>. The<i> present</i> tense,<b> dost thou restore</b> (see above), is often used in speaking with reference to matters of prophecy, importing fixed determination. So that we must not understand it, “Art thou restoring?” but “<i>wilt</i>,” or “<i>dost</i> thou restore?”
