 6 .] This συνελθόντες does not belong to another assembling, different from the former; but takes up again the συναλιζόμενος of Acts 1:4 . Olsh. has mistaken the sense of the μὲν οὖν , which refers, not to another  incident , but to other actors;  they , as distinguished from Him who had been speaking.

That the Kingdom was,  in some sense , and  at some time , to be restored to Israel, was plain; nor does the Lord deny this implication (see on Act 1:8 ). Their fault was, a too curious enquiry on a point reserved among the arcana of God. Lightfoot’s idea, that the disciples wondered at the Kingdom being about to be restored to the ungrateful Jews,  at this time , now that they had crucified Him, &c., would make our Lord’s answer irrelevant.
	See Micah 4:8 , LXX.
	Meyer would refer ἐν τῷ χρ . τού . to the interval designated by οὐ μετὰ πολλ . ταύ . ἡμ ., ‘during this time.’ But this does not seem natural: I should rather understand it,  at this present period, now . The pres.  ἀποκαθιστάνεις , is that so often used in speaking with reference to matters of prophecy, importing fixed determination: as in ὁ ἐρχόμενος (ref. Mt.) and the like. So that we must not render, “Art thou restoring?” but “  wilt ” or “  dost thou restore?” As to the word itself, καθιστάνω (= στημι ) is to establish or set up, and ἀπό gives the sense of completeness, or the cognate one of entire restitution.
