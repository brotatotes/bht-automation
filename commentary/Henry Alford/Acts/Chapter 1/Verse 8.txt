<b> 8.</b>] “As the best means of bridling their curiosity, Christ recalls them both to God’s promise and to His command.” Calvin.<br><br><b> Howbeit</b> “marks the contrast between that which did belong to the disciples and that which did not: as also between that which was to happen at that time, and that which was reserved for the future.” Bengel.<br><br><b> ye shall receive power</b>]<i> that</i> power,<i> especially</i>, spoken of ch. iv. 33, connected with their office of witnessing to the resurrection; but also all other spiritual power. See. Luke xxiv. 49.<br><br><b> ye shall be my witnesses</b>] So they say of themselves, ch. v. 32, “<i>We are His witnesses of these things</i>.” This was the peculiar work of the Apostles.

The Kingdom was to be one founded on<i> testimony</i>, and therefore reigning in the convictions of men’s hearts; and not confined to Judæa, but coextensive with the world.—The Apostles understood this command only of<i> Jews</i> scattered through the world, see ch. xi. 19.—De Wette observes, that these words contain<i> the whole plan of the Acts</i>:<b> Ye shall receive power by the Holy Ghost coming upon you</b>, ch. ii. 1 to end;<b> the witnesses in Jerusalem</b>, ch. iii. 1—vi. 7; then the martyrdom of Stephen dispersed them<i> through Judæa</i>, vi. 8—viii. 3; they preach<i> in Samaria</i>, viii. 4–40; and, from that point, the conversion of the Apostle of the<i> Gentiles</i>, the vision of Peter, the preaching and journeys of Paul. In their former mission, Matt. x. 5, 6, they had been expressly forbidden from preaching either to Samaritans or Gentiles.
