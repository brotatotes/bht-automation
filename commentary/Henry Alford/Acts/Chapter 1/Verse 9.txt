<b> 9.</b>] This appears (see Introduction, ch. iv.§4, paragraph 2) to be an account of the Ascension furnished to St. Luke<i> subsequently to the publication of his Gospel</i>, more particular in detail than that found in<i> it</i>. He has not repeated here details found there; see Luke xxiv. 50–52. On the Ascension in general, see note on Luke, as above.<br><br><b> he was lifted up</b>] We may understand this of the commencing ascent, when He was first lifted from the ground where they were standing: the next clause, a<b> cloud received him out of their sight</b>, describes the close of the scene, as far as it was visible to the spectators. There was a manifest propriety in the last withdrawal of the Lord, while ascending, not consisting in a<i> disappearance</i> of His Body, as on former occasions since the Resurrection; for thus might His abiding Humanity have been called in question. As it was, He went up, past the visible boundary of Heaven, the cloud,—<i>in human form</i>, and so we think of and pray to Him.
