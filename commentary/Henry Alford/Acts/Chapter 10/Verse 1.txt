<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> Καισαρείᾳ</strong> ] As this town bears an important part in early Christian history, it will be well to give here a full account of it. CÆSAREA (Palestinæ, Καισάρεια τῆς Παλαιστίνης , called παράλιος , Jos. B. J. iii. 9. 1; vii. 2. 2; Antt. xiii. 11. 2, or ἡ ἐπὶ θαλάττῃ K., Jos. B. J. vii. 1. 3; 2. 1, or Stratonis (see below), distinguished from Cæsarea. Philippi, see note Mat 16:13 ) is between Joppa and Dora, 68 Rom. miles from Jerusalem according to the Jerus. Itinerary, 75 according to Josephus (i.e. 600 stadia, Antt. xiii. 11. 2. B. J. i. 3. 5), 36. miles (Abulfeda) from Ptolemais (a day’s journey, ch. Act 21:8 ), 30 from Joppa (Edrisi); one of the largest towns in Palestine (Jos. B. J. iii. 9. 1), with an excellent haven (Jos. Antt. xvii. 5. 1, Σεβαστὸς λιμήν , ὅν κατασκευάσας Ἡρώδης πολλῶν χρημάτων ἐπὶ τιμῇ τῇ Καίσαρος καλεῖ Σεβαστόν . It was, even before the destruction of Jerusalem, the seat of the Roman Procurators (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:23">Acts 23:23</span> ff.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:27">Acts 24:27</span> ; Act 25:1 ), and called by Tacitus (Hist. ii. 79) ‘Judææ caput.’ It was chiefly inhabited by Gentiles (Jos. B. J. iii. 9. 1; ii. 14.4), but there were also many thousand Jewish inhabitants (Jos. B. J. ii. 18. 1; Antt. xx. 8.7; Life, 11). It was built by Herod the Great (Amm [56] Marcell [57] xiv. 8; p. 29, Bipont. Beforetime there was only a fort there, called Στράτωνος πύργος , Jos. Antt. xv. 9. 6 al.; Strabo, xvi. 758; Plin. v.14) fortified, provided with a haven (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30">Acts 9:30</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:22">Acts 18:22</span> ; Joseph. above), and in honour of Cæsar Augustus named Cæsarea (at length Καισάρεια Σεβαστή , Jos. Antt. xvi. 5. 1). Vespasian made it a Roman colony (Plin. Act 10:13 ). Abulfeda (Syr. p. 80) speaks of it as in ruins in his time (A.D. 1300). At present there are a few ruins only, and some fishers’ huts. (From Winer, Realw.)

<p><strong> σπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> καλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰταλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <em> A cohort</em> ( σπ .) <em> levied in Italy, not in Syria</em> . Mr. Humphry quotes from Gruter, Inscr. i. p. 434, ‘Cohors militum Italicorum voluntaria, quæ est in Syria.’ Biscoe (Hist. of the Acts, pp. 217 221) maintains that this was an independent cohort, not one attached to a legion. The <em> legio Italica</em> (Tacit. Hist. i. 59, 64; ii. 100; iii. 22) was not raised till Nero’s time.</p>
