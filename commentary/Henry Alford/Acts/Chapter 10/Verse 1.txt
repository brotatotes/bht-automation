<b> 1. Cæsarea</b>] As this town bears an important part in early Christian history, it will be well to give here a full account of it. CÆSAREA ( “<i>of Palestine</i>,” called “<i>by the sea</i>” [as we say, “<i>super mare</i>”) in several places in Josephus, or<i> Stratonis</i> [see below],—distinguished from Cæsarea<i> Philippi</i>, see note Matt. xvi. 13) is between Joppa and Dora, 68 Roman miles from Jerusalem according to the Jerusalem Itinerary, 75 according to Josephus,—36 miles from Ptolemais (a day’s journey, Acts xxi. 8),—30 from Joppa;—one of the largest towns in Palestine, with an excellent haven, built by Herod the Great, and called Sebastos (Augustus) in honour of Cæsar. It was, even before the destruction of Jerusalem, the seat of the Roman Procurators (see ch. xxiii. 23 ff.; xxiv. 27; xxv. 1), and is called by Tacitus the<i> capital of Judæa</i>. It was chiefly inhabited by Gentiles, but there were also many thousand Jewish inhabitants. It was built by Herod the Great. Beforetime there was only a fort there, called the tower of Strato. It was fortified, provided with a haven (see ch. ix. 30; xviii. 22), and in honour of Cæsar Augustus named Cæsarea, more fully Cæsarea Sebasté. Vespasian made it a Roman colony. Abulfeda speaks of it as in ruins in his time (A. D. 1300). At present there are a few ruins only, and some fishers’ huts.
