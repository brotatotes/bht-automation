<b> 10. he fell into a trance</b>] literally,<b> a trance fell upon him.</b> The distinction of this appearance from the “<i>vision</i>” above (though the usage is not always strictly observed) is, that in this case that which was seen was a revelation<i> shewn</i> to the eye of the beholder when rapt into a supernatural state, having, as is the case in a dream,<i> no objective reality:</i> whereas, in the other case, the thing seen<i> actually happened</i>, and was beheld by the person as an ordinary spectator, in the possession of his natural senses.
