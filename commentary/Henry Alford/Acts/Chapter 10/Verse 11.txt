<p><strong> 11. </strong> <strong> τέσς</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀρχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] not, ‘ <em> by the four corners</em> ,’ which would certainly require the article, as in reff., but <strong> by four rope-ends</strong> . This meaning of ἀρχή justified by Diod. Sic. i. p. 104, who, speaking of harpooning the hippopotamus, says, εἶθ ʼ ἑνὶ τῶν ἐμπαγέντων ἐνάπτοντες ἀρχὰς στυπίνας ἀφίασι μέχρις ἂν παραλυθῇ . The <em> ends of the ropes</em> were attached to the sheet, and, in the vision, <em> they only were seen</em> .

<p>At all events, as Neander observes (Pfl. u. L. p. 126, note), these four ἀρχαί (whether ends of ropes attached to the corners, or those corners themselves) are not without meaning, directed as they are to the four parts of heaven, and intimating that men from the North, South, East, and West, now were accounted clean before God, and were called to a share in his kingdom: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:29">Luke 13:29</span> . The symbolism is, as usual, fancifully exaggerated by Wordsw. in his note. The four ἀρχαί are the four gospels, because the word ἀρχή occurs somewhere near the beginning of each, &amp;c., &amp;c. Who can wonder, after this, at the distrust of all Scripture symbolism by intelligent, but unspiritual minds?

<p>I have retained the words δεδ . καί doubtfully, because it seems difficult to account for their insertion, but they may have been omitted to assimilate our text to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:5">Acts 11:5</span> .</p>
