 15. ] These weighty words have more than one application. They reveal what was needed for the occasion, in a figure: God letting down from heaven clean and unclean alike, Jew and Gentile, represented that He had made of one blood all nations to dwell on the face of all the earth: God having  purified these, signified that the distinction was now abolished which was ‘added because of transgressions’ ( Gal 3:19 ), and all  regarded in his eyes as pure for the sake of His dear Son . But the  literal truth of the representation was also implied; that the same distinctions between the animals intended for use as food were now done away, and free range allowed to men, as their lawful wants and desires invite them, over the whole creation of God: that creation itself having been  purified and rendered clean for use by the satisfaction of Christ . The same truth which is asserted by the heavenly voice in Peter’s vision, is declared Ephesians 1:10 ; Col 1:20 ; 1 Timothy 4:4-5 . Only we must be careful not to confound this restitution with the ἀποκατάστασις πάντων of ch. Acts 3:21 ; see notes there.
