<p><strong> 17.</strong> Valcknaer and Stier understand ἐν ἑαυτῷ , as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:11">Acts 12:11</span> , where γενόμενος is expressed (see D in var. readd. here), ‘when he came to himself,’ but without γενόμενος this is very harsh, and it surely is better not to force from its obvious meaning so natural a conjunction of words as ἐν ἑαυτῷ διηπόρει .</p>
