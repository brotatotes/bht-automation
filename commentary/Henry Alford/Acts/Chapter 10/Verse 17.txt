 17. Valcknaer and Stier understand ἐν ἑαυτῷ , as ch. Acts 12:11 , where γενόμενος is expressed (see D in var. readd. here), ‘when he came to himself,’ but without γενόμενος this is very harsh, and it surely is better not to force from its obvious meaning so natural a conjunction of words as ἐν ἑαυτῷ διηπόρει .
