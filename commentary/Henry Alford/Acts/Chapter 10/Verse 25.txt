 25.   τοῦ εἰσελθ  . ] This, the most difficult and best supported reading, is a harshness of construction hardly explicable (see Winer, edn. 6, § 44. 4) on any principles. It probably arose from taking the so frequent τοῦ with the infin. almost as  one word , and equivalent to the infin. itself.
	 τοὺς πόδας ] viz. those of Peter. Kuinoel’s rendering ‘in  genua provolutus’ is clearly inadmissible.
	 προσεκύν  . ] “Adoravit; non addidit Lucas, ‘  eum .’ Euphmia.” (Bengel.)
	May not the same reason have occasioned the omission of αὐτοῦ after πόδας ? the one αὐτ . would almost require the other. It was natural for Cornelius to think that one so pointed out by an angel must be deserving of the highest respect; and this respect he shewed in a way which proves him not to have altogether lost the heathen training of his childhood. He must have witnessed the rise of the custom of paying divine honours first to those who were clothed with the delegated power of the senate (Suet., Octav.52, mentions, “templa etiam proconsulibus decerni solere”), and then κατ ʼ ἐξοχήν to him in whom the imperial majesty centered.
