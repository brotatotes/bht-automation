<p><strong> 26. </strong> <strong> καὶ ἐγὼ αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἄνθρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἰμι</strong> ] This was the lesson which Peter’s vision had taught him, and he now begins to practise it: the <em> common honour and equality of all mankind in God’s sight</em> .
	</p>
<p>Those who claim to have succeeded Peter, have not imitated this part of his conduct. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+22:8">Revelation 22:8</span> , in both which cases it is ἔμπροσθ . <strong> τῶν ποδῶν</strong> τοῦ ἀγγ ., supporting the above rendering of ἐπὶ τ . πόδας . (See the gloss in D, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:25">Acts 10:25</span> , digest.)</p>
