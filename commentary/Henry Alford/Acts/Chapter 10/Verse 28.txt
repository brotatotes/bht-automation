 28.   ὑμεῖς  , you, of all men, (best) know: being those immediately concerned in the obstruction to intercourse which the rule occasioned.
	 ὡς ἀθέμιτον  … ]  that it is unlawful , … or ‘how unlawful it is:’ better the former, because in the order of the words, ἀθέμιτον has the stress on it: the other rendering would more naturally represent ὡς ἔστιν ἀθέμιτον . In both the reff. the ambiguity is the same.
	There is some difficulty about this unlawfulness of consorting with those ἀλλόφυλοι who, like Cornelius, worshipped the true God. It rests upon no legal prohibition, and seems, at first sight, hardly consistent with the zeal to gain proselytes predicated of the Pharisees, Matthew 23:15 , with Jos. Antt. xx. 2. 3 ( Ἰουδαῖός τις ἔμπορος , Ἀνανίας ὄνομα , πρὸς τὰς γυναῖκας εἰσιὼν τοῦ βασιλέως (Monobazus, of Adiabene) ἐδίδασκεν αὐτὰς τὸν θεὸν εὐσεβεῖν ), and with the Rabbinical comment Schemoth Rabba on Exodus 12:4 , “Hoc idem est quod scriptum dicit Jes. Leviticus 3:0 . Et non dicet filius advenæ qui adhæsit Domino, dicendo: separando separavit me Dominus a populo suo.” But whatever  exceptions there may have been, it was unquestionably the  general practice of the Jews to separate themselves in common life from uncircumcised persons. We have Juvenal testifying to this at Rome, Sat. xiv. 103, ‘non monstrare vias, eadem nisi sacra colenti: Quæsitum ad fontem solos deducere verpos.’ And Tacitus, Hist.

	 κἀμοί ], not, ‘  but God hath shewed me,’ as E. V.:  καί can never have this meaning, and in all cases where it is so rendered we may trace the significance of the simple copula if we examine. Here, for instance: the two parties concerned are ὑμεῖς , κἀγώ . ‘  Ye , though ye see me here, know, how strong the prejudice is which would have kept me away:  and I , though entertaining fully this prejudice myself, yet have been taught &c.’
