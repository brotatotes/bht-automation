 30.   ἀπὸ τετ  .   ἡμ  . ] The rendering of Meyer and others, ‘From the fourth day (reckoned back) down to this hour have I been fasting,’ is ungrammatical; for (1) this would require  τῆσδε τῆς ὥρας , and (2) ἤμην cannot possibly reach to the  present time , but is the historical past:  I was fasting . This being so, ἀπὸ τετάρτης ἡμέρας must indicate the time denoted by ἤμην ‘quarto abhinc die’  four days ago ; see reff. (2), which fully justify this rendering. De Wette’s and Neander’s rendering, ‘For four (whole) days was I (i.e. had I been) fasting up to this hour (i.e. the hour in which he saw the vision),’ does not satisfy  ταύτης τῆς ὥρας , which must in that case be ἐκείνης , if indeed such an expression could be at all used of ‘the time when the following incident took place.’ The only legitimate meaning of ταύτ . τ . ὥρ . I take to be  this hour of the day : and this meaning is further established by the omission of ὥραν after ἐνάτην .
