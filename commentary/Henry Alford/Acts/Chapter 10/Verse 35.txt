 35. ]  ἀλλά gives the explanation, what it is that Peter now fully apprehends: but as opposed to προσωπολήμπτης in its now apparent sense.
	 ἐν παντὶ ἔθνει κ.τ.λ. ] It is very important that we should hold the right clue to guide us in understanding this saying. The question which recent events had solved in Peter’s mind, was that of the admissibility of men of all nations into the church of Christ.  In this tense only , had he received any information as to the  acceptableness of men of all nations before God. He saw, that in every nation, men who seek after God, who receive His witness of Himself without which He has left no man, and humbly follow His will as far as they know it, these have no  extraneous hindrance , such as uncircumcision,  placed in their way to Christ, but are capable of being admitted into God’s church  though Gentiles, and  as Gentiles. That only  such are spoken of, is agreeable to the nature of the case; for men who do not fear God, and work unrighteousness, are out of the question, not being likely to seek such admission. It is clearly unreasonable to suppose Peter to have meant, that  each heathen’s natural light and moral purity would render him acceptable in the sight of God : for, if so, why should he have proceeded to preach Christ to Cornelius, or indeed  any more at all ? And it is equally unreasonable to find any verbal or doctrinal difficulty in ἐργ . δικαιοσύνην , or to suppose that δικ . must be taken in its forensic sense, and therefore that he alludes to the state of men  after becoming believers. He speaks  popularly , and certainly not without reference to the  character he had heard of Cornelius, which consisted of these very two parts, that he  feared God , and  abounded in good works .
	The deeper truth, that the preparation of the heart itself in such men  comes from God’s preventing grace , is not in question here, nor touched upon.
