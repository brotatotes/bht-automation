<b> 35.</b>]<b> but</b> gives the explanation,—what it is that Peter now fully apprehends:<b> but</b>, as opposed to God being a respecter of persons in its now apparent sense.<br><br><b> in every nation</b>, &c.] It is very important that we should hold the right clue to guide us in understanding this saying. The question which recent events had solved in Peter’s mind, was that of the admissibility of men of all nations into the church of Christ.<i> In this sense only</i>, had he received any information as to the<i> acceptableness</i> of men of all nations before God. He saw, that in every nation, men who seek after God, who receive His witness of Himself without which He has left no man, and humbly follow His will as far as they know it,—these have no<i> extraneous hindrance</i>, such as uncircumcision,<i> placed in their way</i> to Christ, but are capable of being admitted into God’s church<i> though</i> Gentiles, and<i> as</i> Gentiles. That only<i> such</i> are spoken of, is agreeable to the nature of the case; for men who do not fear God, and work unrighteousness, are out of the question, not being likely to seek such admission. It is clearly unreasonable to suppose Peter to have meant, that<i> each heathen’s natural light and moral purity would render him acceptable in the sight of God</i>:—for, if so, why should he have proceeded to preach Christ to Cornelius, or indeed<i> any more at all</i>? And it is equally unreasonable to find any verbal or doctrinal difficulty in the expression<b> worketh righteousness</b>, or to suppose that<b> righteousness</b> must be taken in its technical and imputed sense, and therefore that he alludes to the state of men<i> after becoming</i> believers. He speaks<i> popularly</i>, and certainly not without reference to the<i> character he had heard</i> of Cornelius, which consisted of these very two parts, that he<i> feared God</i>, and<i> abounded in good works</i>.—The deeper truth, that the preparation of the heart itself in such men<i> comes from God’s preventing grace</i>, is not in question here, nor touched upon.
