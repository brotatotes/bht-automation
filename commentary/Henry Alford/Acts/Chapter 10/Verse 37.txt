<p><strong> 37. </strong> <strong> τὸ ῥῆμα</strong> ] <strong> the matter</strong> : not the <em> thing</em> , here or any where else: but the <em> thing said</em> , the ‘materies’ of the proclamation, in this case perhaps best ‘ <em> the history</em> .’
	</p>
<p><strong> γενόμενον</strong> ] Not ‘ <em> which took place</em> ,’ but, <strong> which was spoken</strong> , ‘published,’ as E. V. See reff. This meaning, which ῥῆμα itself renders necessary, is further supported by καθ ʼ ὅλης τ . Ἰουδ ., which can only be properly said, and is used by Luke (only, see reff.) of a <em> publication</em> , or spreading of a rumour, not of the happening of an event or series of events relating to one person.

<p><strong> ἀρξ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Γαλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] It was from Galilee first that the fame of Jesus went abroad, as Luke himself relates, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:14">Luke 4:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:37">Luke 4:37</span> (44 v. r.); <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:17">Acts 7:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:6">Acts 9:6</span> ( Act 23:5 ). Galilee also was the nearest to Cæsarea, and may have been for this reason expressly mentioned. ἀρξάμενος is an unexpected transference of the case and gender into that of the prime agent, a construction common enough in the Apocalypse ( Act 4:1 reff.), but surprising in St. Luke.

<p><strong> μετὰ τὸ βάπτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] So also Peter dates the ministry of our Lord in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span> . (See note there.)</p>
