<b> 38. Jesus of Nazareth</b>] The<i> personal subject</i> of the matter which was published: ‘Ye know the subject which was preached..... viz. Jesus of Nazareth.’<br><br><b> how that God anointed him</b>] Not as A.V., “<i>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth:</i>’ see the last note.—The fact of the anointing with the Holy Spirit, in His baptism by John, was the historical opening of the ministry of Jesus: this anointing however was not His<i> first</i> unction with the Spirit, but only symbolic of that which He had in His incarnation: which unction abode upon Him, John i. 32, 33, and is alleged here as the continuing anointing which was upon Him from God.—Stier well remarks, how entirely all personal address to the hearers and all doctrinal announcements are thrown into the background in this speech, and the<i> Person and Work and Office of Christ</i> put forward as the sole subject of apostolic preaching.<br><br><b> oppressed</b>] literally,<i> subdued</i>, so that he is their master,—and his power is used for their oppression. Here, it alludes to physical oppression by disease (see Luke xiii. 16) and possession: in 2 Tim. ii. 26, a very similar description is given of those who are<i> spiritually</i> bound by the devil.<br><br><b> God was with him</b>] So Nicodemus had spoken, John iii. 2; and probably Peter here used the words as well known and indicative of the presence of divine power and co-operation (see Judg. vi. 16): beginning as he does with the outer and lower circle of the things regarding Christ, as they would be matter of observation and inference to his<i> hearers</i>, and gradually ascending to those higher truths regarding His Person and Office, which were matter of<i> apostolic testimony</i> and demonstration from Scripture,—His resurrection (ver. 40), His being appointed Judge of living and dead (ver. 42), and the predestined Author of salvation to all who believe on Him (ver, 43).
