<p><strong> ὃν καὶ ἀνεῖλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> Whom also they killed</strong> . καί is not ‘ <em> yet</em> ,’ as Kuinoel, but merely introduces, in this case passing over it without emphasis, a new fact in this history. He even omits all mention of the <em> actors</em> in the murder, speaking as he did to Gentiles: a striking contrast to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:10">Acts 4:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:30">Acts 5:30</span> , when he was working conviction in the minds of <em> those actors themselves</em> .
