But this is most improbable from the construction of the sentence, besides that the fact of their having eaten and drunk with Him<i> after</i> His Resurrection gives most important testimony to the reality and identity of His risen Body. And there is no real difficulty in it: Luke xxiv. 41, 43 and John xxi. 12 give us instances; and, even if the drinking with Him, is to be pressed, it is no contradiction to Luke xxii. 18, which only refers to one particular kind of drinking.
