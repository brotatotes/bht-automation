<b> 42. unto the people</b>] Here, as elsewhere (ver. 2; John xi. 50 al. fr.), the<i> Jewish people:</i> that was all which in the apostolic mind, up to this time, the command had absolutely enjoined. The further unfoldings of the Gospel had all been brought about over and above this first injunction. Ch. i. 8 is no obstacle to this interpretation; for although literally fulfilled by the leadings of Providence, as related in this book, they did not so understand it when spoken.<br><br><b> which is ordained of God</b>] Had not Peter in his mind the Lord’s own solemn words, John xvii. 6?<br><br><b> Judge of quick and dead</b>] See also St. Paul, ch. xvii. 31, preaching to Gentiles, brings forward the appointment of a Judge over all men as the central point of his teaching. This expression gives at once a universality to the office and mission of Christ, which prepares the way for the great truth declared in the next verse.—It is impossible that the<i> living and dead</i> here can mean (as the Augsburg Catechism, and Olshausen) the<i> righteous and sinners:</i>—a canon of interpretation which should constantly be borne in mind is,<i> that a figurative sense of words is never admissible</i>, EXCEPT WHEN REQUIRED BY THE CONTEXT. Thus, in the passage of John v. 25 (where see notes), the sense of “<i>the dead</i>” is determined to be figurative by the addition of “<i>and now is</i>” after the<i> hour</i> being mentioned, no such addition occurring in ver. 28, where the literally dead, “<i>all that are in the graves,</i>” are mentioned.
