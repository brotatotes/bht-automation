 42.   τῷ λαῷ ] Here as elsewhere (Acts 10:2 ; Joh 11:50 al. fr.), the  Jewish people : that was all which, in the apostolic mind, up to this time, the command had absolutely enjoined. The further unfolding of the Gospel had all been brought about over and above this first injunction. Ch. Act 1:8 is no obstacle to this interpretation; for although literally fulfilled by the leadings of Providence, as related in this book, they did not so understand it when spoken.
	 κριτ  .   ζ  .   κ  .   νεκρ  . ] So also Paul, ch. Acts 17:31 , preaching to Gentiles, brings forward the appointment of a Judge over all men as the central point of his teaching. This expression gives at once a universality to the office and mission of Christ, which prepares the way for the great truth declared in the next verse.
	It is impossible that the  living and dead here can mean (as the Augsburg Catechism, and Olshausen) the  righteous and sinners : a canon of interpretation which should constantly be borne in mind is,  that a figurative sense of words is never admissible , EXCEPT WHEN REQUIRED BY THE CONTEXT. Thus, in the passage of John 5:25 (where see notes), the sense of νεκροί is determined to be figurative by the addition of καὶ νῦν ἐστιν after ὥρα , no such addition occurring in Acts 10:28 , where the literally dead, οἱ ἐν τοῖς μνημείοις , are mentioned.
