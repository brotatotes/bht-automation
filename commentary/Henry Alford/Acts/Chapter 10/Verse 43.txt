 43.   πάντες οἱ προφ  . ] All the prophets, generically: not that  every one positively asserted this, but that the whole bulk of prophetic testimony announced it. To press such expressions to literal exactness is mere trifling. See ch. Acts 3:21 ; Acts 3:24 .
	 ἄφ  .   ἁμ  .   λαβ  . κ . τ . λ .] The  legal sacrifices , as well as the declarations of the prophets, all pointed to the remission of sins by faith in Him. And the  universality of this proclamation, πάντα τὸν πιστ ., is set forth by the prophets in many places, and was recognized even by the Jews themselves, in their expositions of Scripture, though not in their practice.
