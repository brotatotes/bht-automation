 19.   μὲν οὖν ] A resumption of what had been dropt before, see ch. Acts 8:4 , continued from Acts 11:2 ; not however without reference to some narrative about to follow which is brought out by a δέ , answering to the μέν , see ch. Acts 8:5 , also ch. Acts 9:31-32 ; Acts 28:5-6 , and implying, whether by way of  distinction or  exception , a contrast to that μέν .
	 ἐπὶ Στ  . ]  on account of Stephen ; see reff. Wolf, Kuin., Olsh., &c. render it ‘  after St. :’ the Vulg.  sub Stephano , reading  ἐπὶ Στεφάνου .
	 διῆλθον ] so ch. Acts 8:4 ; Acts 8:40 ; Acts 9:32 .
	 Φοινίκης ] properly, the strip of coast, about 120 miles long, extending from the river Eleutherus (near Aradus), to a little south of Tyre, and belonging at this time to the province of Syria: see ch. Acts 15:3 ; Acts 21:2 . Its principal cities were Tripolis, Byblos, Sidon, Tyre, and Berytos. It is a fertile territory, beginning with the uplands at the foot of Lebanon, and sloping to the sea, and held a distinguished position for commerce from the very earliest times. See Winer, Realw.
	 Κύπρου ] Cyprus was intimately connected by commerce with Phœnice, and contained many Jews ( οὐ μόνον αἱ ἤπειροι μεσταὶ τῶν Ἰουδαϊκῶν ἀποικιῶν εἰσιν , ἀλλὰ καὶ νήσων αἱ δοκιμώταται , Εὔβοια ,  Κύπρος , Κρήτη . Philo, Leg. ad Caium, § 36, vol. ii. p. 587. See also Jos. Antt. xiii. 10. 4). See on its state at this time, note on ch. Acts 13:7 .
	 Ἀντιοχείας ] A city in the history of Christianity only second in importance to Jerusalem. It was situated on the river Orontes, in a large, fruitful, and well-watered plain, 120 stadia from the sea and its port Seleucia. It was founded by Seleucus Nicator, who called it after his father Antiochus. It soon became a great and populous city ( Ἀντ . ἡ μεγάλη , Philostr. Apoll. i. 16), and was the residence of the Seleucid kings of Syria ( 1Ma 3:37 ; 1Ma 7:2 ; 1Ma 11:13 ; 1Ma 11:44 ; 2Ma 5:21 ), and (as an ‘urbs libera,’ Pliny, Act 11:18 ) of the Roman proconsuls of Syria. Josephus (B. J. iii. 2. 4) calls it μεγέθους τε ἑνεκα καὶ τῆς ἄλλης εὐδαιμονίας τρίτον ἀδηρίτως ἐπὶ τῆν ὑπὸ Ῥωμαίοις οἰκουμένης ἔχουσα τόπον . Seleucus the founder had settled there many Jews (Jos. Antt. xii. 3. 1. See also xiv. 12. 6; B.J. ii. 18. 5; vii. 3. 3 and contra Apion. ii. 4, αὐτῶν γὰρ ἡμῶν οἱ τὴν Ἀντιόχειαν κατοικοῦντες , Ἀντιοχεῖς ὀνομάζονται · τὴν γὰρ πολιτείαν αὐτοῖς ἔδωκεν ὁ κτίστης Σέλευκος ), who had their own Ethnarch. The intimate connexion of Antioch with the history of the church will be seen as we proceed. A reference to the principal passages will here be enough: see Acts 11:22 ; Acts 11:26-27 ; ch. Acts 13:1 ; Acts 15:23 ; Acts 15:35 ff.; Acts 18:22 . It became afterwards one of the five great centres of the Christian church, with Jerusalem, Rome, Alexandria, and Constantinople. Of its present state (Antakia, a town not one-third of its ancient size) a view is given in C. and H., where also, edn. 2, vol. i. pp. 149 ff., is a minute and interesting description of the city and its history, ancient and modern. See also Mr. Lewin’s Life and Epistles of St. Paul, vol. i. p. 108 ff. (Principally from Winer, Realw.)
