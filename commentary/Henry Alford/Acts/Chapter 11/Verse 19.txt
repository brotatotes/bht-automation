<b> 19. So then</b>] A resumption of what had been dropt before, see ch. viii. 4, continued from ver. 2: not however without reference to some narrative about to follow which is brought out by a<b> But</b>—see ch. viii. 5, also ch. ix. 31, 32; xxviii. 5, 6,—and implying, whether by way of<i> distinction</i> or<i> exception</i>, a contrast to what is stated in this verse.<br><br><b> Phenicé</b>] properly, the strip of coast, about 120 miles Jong, extending from the river Eleutherus (near Aradus), to a little south of Tyre, and belonging at this time to the province of Syria: see ch. xv. 3; xxi. 2. Its principal cities were Tripolis, Byblos, Sidon, Tyre, and Berytos. It is a fertile territory, beginning with the uplands at the foot of Lebanon, and sloping to the sea, and held a distinguished position for commerce from the very earliest times.<br><br><b> Cyprus</b>] Cyprus was intimately connected by commerce with Phœnice, and contained many Jews. See on its state at this time, note on ch. xiii. 7.<br><br><b> Antioch</b>] A city in the history of Christianity only second in importance to Jerusalem. It was situated on the river Orontes, in a large, fruitful, and well-watered plain, 120 stadia from the sea and its port Seleucia. It was founded by Seleucus Nicator, who called it after his father Antiochus. It soon became a great and populous city, and was the residence of the Seleucid kings of Syria (1 Macc. iii. 37; vii. 2; xi. 13, 44; 2 Macc. v. 21), and of the Roman proconsuls of Syria. Josephus (B. J. iii. 2, 4) says that, for greatness and prosperity, it was the third city of the Roman world. Seleucus the founder had settled there many Jews who had their own governor, or Ethnarch. The intimate connexion of Antioch with the history of the church will be seen as we proceed. reference to the principal passages will here be enough: see vv. 22, 26, 27; ch. xiii. 1; xv. 23, 35 ff; xviii. 22. It became afterwards one of the five great centres of the Christian church, with Jerusalem, Rome, Alexandria and Constantinople. Of its present state (Antakia, a town not one-third of its ancient size) a view is given in Conybeare and Howson, where also, edn. 2. vol. i. pp. 149 ff., is a minute and interesting description of the city and its history, ancient and modern. See also Mr. Lewin’s Life and Epistles of St. Paul, vol. i.p. 108 ff.
