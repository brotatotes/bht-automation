It appears mainly to have arisen from a mistaken view that the baptism of Cornelius must necessarily have preceded the conversion of all other Gentiles. But that reading gives, in this place, no assignable sense whatever: for (1) the<i> Hellenists</i> were<i> long ago a recognized part</i> of the Christian church— (2) among these who were scattered abroad themselves in all probability there were many Hellenists,—and (3) the term<b> Jews</b><i> includes</i> the Hellenists,—the distinctive appellation of pure Jews being not<i> Jews</i> but<b> Hebrews</b>, ch. vi. 1. Nothing to my mind can be plainer, from what follows respecting Barnabas, than that these<b> Grecians</b> were GENTILES,<i> uncircumcised</i>; and that their conversion took place<i> before any tidings had reached Jerusalem of the divine sanction given in the case of Cornelius</i>.
