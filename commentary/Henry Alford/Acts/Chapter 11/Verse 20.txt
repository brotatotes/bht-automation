	 Ἕλληνας ] The retaining and advocacy of the reading Ἑλληνιστάς has mainly arisen from a mistaken view that the baptism of Cornelius must necessarily have preceded the conversion of all other Gentiles. But that reading gives, in this place, no assignable sense whatever: for (1) the  Hellenists were  long ago a recognized part of the Christian church, (2) among these διασπαρέντες themselves in all probability there were many Hellenists, and (3) the term Ἰουδαῖοι  includes the Hellenists, the distinctive appellation of pure Jews being not Ἰουδαῖοι , but Ἑβραῖοι , ch. Acts 6:1 . Nothing to my mind can be plainer, from what follows respecting Barnabas, than that these Ἕλληνες were GENTILES,  uncircumcised ; and that their conversion took place  before any tidings had reached Jerusalem of the divine sanction given in the case of Cornelius .
