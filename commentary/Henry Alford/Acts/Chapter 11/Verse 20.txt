<p><strong> 20. </strong> <strong> ἐξ αὐτῶν</strong> ] not, of these, <em> last mentioned Jews</em> : but, <em> of the</em> <strong> διασπαρέντες</strong> <strong> .</strong> This both the sense and the form of the sentence ( μὲν οὖν .… δέ ) require.

<p><strong> Κυρηναῖοι</strong> ] of whom Lucius mentioned ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span> , as being in the church at Antioch, must have been one. Symeon called <em> Niger</em> , also mentioned there, may have been a Cyrenean proselyte.

<p><strong> Ἕλληνας</strong> ] The retaining and advocacy of the reading Ἑλληνιστάς has mainly arisen from a mistaken view that the baptism of Cornelius must necessarily have preceded the conversion of all other Gentiles. But that reading gives, in this place, no assignable sense whatever: for (1) the <em> Hellenists</em> were <em> long ago a recognized part</em> of the Christian church, (2) among these διασπαρέντες themselves in all probability there were many Hellenists, and (3) the term Ἰουδαῖοι <em> includes</em> the Hellenists, the distinctive appellation of pure Jews being not Ἰουδαῖοι , but Ἑβραῖοι , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1">Acts 6:1</span> . Nothing to my mind can be plainer, from what follows respecting Barnabas, than that these Ἕλληνες were GENTILES, <em> uncircumcised</em> ; and that their conversion took place <em> before any tidings had reached Jerusalem of the divine sanction given in the case of Cornelius</em> . See below: and Excursus ii. at the end of Prolegg. to Acts.</p>
