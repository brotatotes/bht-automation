<b> 26. Christians</b>] This name is never used by Christians of themselves in the N.T. (but “<i>the disciples,</i>” “<i>the faithful,</i>” “<i>the believers,</i>” “<i>the brethren,</i>” “<i>the saints,</i>” “<i>they of this</i> [or<i> the</i>]<i> way</i>”), only (see ch. xxvi. 28; 1 Pet. iv. 16) as<i> spoken by</i>, or<i> coming from</i>, those without the church. And<i> of</i> those, it cannot have arisen with the Jews, who would never have given a name<i> derived from the Messiah</i> to a hated and despised sect. Ly the Jews they were called<i> Nazarenes</i>, ch. xxiv. 5, and<i> Galilæans</i>: and the Emperor Julian (the Apostate), who wished to deprive them of a name in which they gloried (see below), and to favour the Jews, ordered that they should not be called Christians, but Galilæans. The name soon became matter of glorying among its bearers: see 1 Pet. iv. 16. In the epistle of the churches of Lyons and Vienne, given by Eusebius, we read, that when the governor asked Epagathus whether he too were a Christian, he confessed it with a loud voice: and again that Sanctus, to every question, replied in Latin, “I am a Christian.” And in the Clementine Liturgy we have these words, “We give thanks to Thee that the name of thy Christ is named upon us, and that we are called Thine.” Before this, while the believers had been<i> included among Jews</i>, no distinctive name for them was needed: but now that a body of men, compounded of<i> Jews and Gentiles</i>, arose, distinct in belief and habits from both, some new appellation was required.—It may he observed, that the inhabitants of Antioch were famous for their propensity to jeer and cal] names; see instances in Conybeare and Howson, i.p. 148, note 2.
