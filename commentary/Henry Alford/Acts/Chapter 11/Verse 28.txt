<p><strong> 28. </strong> <strong> Ἄγαβος</strong> ] The same who prophesied Paul’s imprisonment in Jerusalem, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:10">Acts 21:10</span> , ff. From the form of his announcement <em> there</em> , we may infer the manner in which he ἐσήμανεν διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος <em> here</em> . It was <strong> τάδε λὲγει τὸ πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὸ ἅγιον</strong> .

<p>The fem. usage of <strong> λιμός</strong> prevailed among the Dorians (cf. Aristoph. Acharn. 708) and later Greeks: see Meyer, edn. 2, and Lobeck on Phryn. p. 188. We find it sometimes also in Ionic poets, e.g. in Hom. Hymn to Demeter, 311, λιμοῦ ὑπ ʼ ἀργαλέης : see other examples in Palm and Rost, sub voce.

<p><strong> ὅλην τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οἰκουμένην</strong> ] not, ‘ <em> all Judæa</em> ,’ though in fact it was so: the expression is a hyperbolical one in ordinary use, and not to be pressed as strictly implying that to which its literal meaning would extend. That it occurs in a <em> prophecy</em> (Meyer) is no objection to this: the scope and not the wording of the prophecy is given. But see below.

<p><strong> ἐπὶ Κλαυδίου</strong> ] In the <em> fourth</em> year of Claudius, A.D. 44, there was a famine in Judæa and the neighbouring countries (Jos. Antt. xx. 2. 5). And three others are mentioned during his reign: one in Greece (Eus [60] Chron. i. 79), and two in Rome (Dio Cassius, lx. 11. Tacitus, Ann. xii. 43), so that <em> scarcity</em> ἐπὶ Κλαυδίου <em> did extend through the greater part of the ‘orbis terrarum</em> ,’ if it be thought necessary to press the words of the prophecy. The queen Helena of Adiabene and her son Izates helped the Jews with subsidies on the occasion (Jos. ibid., see also xx. 5. 2, where he calls it τὸν μέγαν λιμόν ), both of corn and money.

<p>I do not believe that the words ἐπὶ Κλ . imply that the <em> events just related were not also in the reign of Claudius</em> : but they are inserted to particularize the famine as being that well-known one, and only imply that the author was not <em> writing</em> under Claudius.</p>
