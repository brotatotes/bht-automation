<b> 28. Agabus</b>] The same who prophesied Paul’s imprisonment in Jerusalem, ch. xxi. 10 ff. From the form of his announcement<i> there</i>, we may infer the manner in which he<b> signified by the Spirit</b><i> here</i>. It was, “<i>Thus saith the Holy Ghost.</i>”<br><br><b> throughout all the world</b>] not, ‘<i>all Judæa,</i>’ though in fact it was so: the expression is probably a hyperbolical one in ordinary use, and not to be pressed as strictly implying that to which its literal meaning would extend. That it occurs in a<i> prophecy</i> is no objection to this: the scope, and not the wording of the prophecy is given. But see below.<br><br><b> in the days of Claudius Cæsar</b>] In the fourth year of Claudius, A.D. 44, there was a famine in Judæa and the neighbouring countries. And three others are mentioned during his reign: one in Greece, and two in Rome, so that<i> scarcity</i> in the days of Claudius Cæsar<i> did extend through the greater part of the Roman world</i>, if it be thought necessary to press the words of the prophecy. The queen Helena of Adiabene and her son Izates helped the Jews with subsidies on the occasion (in relating which, Josephus calls it “<i>the great famine</i>”), both of corn and money.—I do not believe that the words ‘<i>in the days of Claudius Cæsar</i>” imply that the<i> events just related were not also in the reign of Claudius:</i> but they are inserted to particularize the famine as being that well-known one, and only imply that the author was not<i> writing</i> under Claudius.
