<b> 29.</b>] There is no need to suppose that the prophecy of Agabus preceded by any long time the outbreak of the famine: nor would it be any derogation from its prophetic character to suppose it even coincident with its first beginnings; it was the<i> greatness</i> and<i> extent</i> of the famine which was particularly revealed, and which determined the Christians of Antioch to send the relief. Baumgarten, in tracing the gradual transition of the apostolic narrative from Jewish to Gentile Christianity, calls this contribution, sent from Antioch to Jerusalem, the first stretching out of the hand by the Gentile world across the ancient gulf which separated it from Israel.<br><br> The church at Jerusalem was poor, probably in connexion with the community of goods, which would soon have this effect; see ch. ii. 44, note.
