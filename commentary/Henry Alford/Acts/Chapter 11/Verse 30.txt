<b> 30. the elders</b>] These were the<i> overseers</i> or<i> presidents</i> of the congregation,—an office borrowed from the synagogues, and established by the Apostles in the churches generally, see ch. xiv. 23. They are in the N.T. identical with<i> bishops</i>, see ch. xx. 17, 28; Titus i. 5, 7; 1 Pet. v. 1, 2. So Theodoret on Phil. i. 1, “He calls the elders,<i> bishops:</i> for at that time they had both names.” The title “<i>episcopus</i>,” as applied to one person superior to the<i> elders</i>, and answering to our ‘<i>bishop</i>,’ appears to have been unknown in the apostolic times.—Respecting the chronology of this journey to Jerusalem, see note on ch. xii. 25, and the table in the Introduction.
