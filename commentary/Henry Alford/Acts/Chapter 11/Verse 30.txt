 30.   πρεσβυτέρους ] These were the  overseers or  presidents of the congregation, an office borrowed from the synagogues, and established by the Apostles in the churches generally, see ch. Acts 14:23 . They are in the N. T. identical with ἐπίσκοποι , see ch. Acts 20:17 ; Acts 20:28 ; Titus 1:5 ; Titus 1:7 ; 1 Peter 5:1-2 . So Theodoret on Philippians 1:1 , ἐπισκόπους τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους καλεῖ · ἀμφότερα γὰρ εἶχον κατ ʼ ἐκεῖνον τὸν καιρὸν τὰ ὀνόματα . The title ἐπίσκοπος , as applied to one person superior to the πρεσβύτεροι , and answering to our ‘bishop,’ appears to have been unknown in the apostolic times. Respecting the chronology of this journey to Jerusalem, see note on ch. Acts 12:25 , and the table in the Prolegomena.
