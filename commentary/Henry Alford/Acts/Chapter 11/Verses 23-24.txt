 23, 24 .] It is on these verses principally that I depend as determining the character of the whole narrative. It certainly is implied in them that the effect produced on Barnabas was  something different from what might have been expected : that to sympathize with the work was  not the intent of his mission, but a result brought about in the heart of a good man, full of the Holy Ghost and of faith, by witnessing the effects of Divine grace ( τ . χάρ . τὴν τοῦ θεοῦ , not merely, ‘  the grace of God ,’ but  the grace which (evidently) was that of God [which he recognized as that of God]: the expression is deliberately used). And this is further confirmed to my mind by finding that he immediately  went and sought Saul . He had been Saul’s friend at Jerusalem: he had doubtless heard of the commission which had been given to him to preach to the  Gentiles : but the church was waiting the will of God, to know  how this was to be accomplished.  Here was an evident door open for the ministry of Saul, and, in consequence, as soon as Barnabas perceives it, he goes to fetch him to begin his work in Antioch. And it was  here , more properly, and not in Cæsarea, that the real commencement of the  Gentile church took place, although simultaneously, for the convincing of the Jewish believers at Jerusalem, and of Peter, and for the more solemn and authorized standing of the Gentile church, the important events at Cæsarea and Joppa were brought about. Wordsw.’s argument, that, as even Ἕλληνας may include Jews, we need not suppose this to have been a preaching to Gentiles, is best answered by the context, in which the μηδενὶ εἰ μὴ μόνον Ἰουδαίοις is clearly contrasted with ἦσαν δὲ .… καὶ πρὸς τοὺς Ἕλληνας , which contrast cannot be maintained without excluding Jews from this latter term.
