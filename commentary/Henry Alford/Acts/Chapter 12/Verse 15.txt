 15.   ἄγγελός ἐστ  .   αὐτοῦ ] No other rendering but  his angel will suit the sense: and with a few exceptions (Camero, Basnage, Hammond, and one or two more) all Commentators, ancient and modern, have recognized this meaning. Our Lord  plainly asserts the doctrine of guardian angels in ref. Matt. (see note there): and from this we further learn in what sense His words were understood by the early church. From His words taken with the context ( μὴ καταφρονήσητε  ἑνὸς τῶν μικρῶν τούτων ) we infer that  each one has his guardian angel: from this passage we find not only that such was believed to be the case, but that it was supposed that such angel  occasionally appeared in the semblance (seeing that he spoke with the voice)  of the person himself . We do not, it is true, know who the speakers were: nor is the peculiar form in which they viewed the doctrine binding upon us: it may have been erroneous, and savouring of superstition. But of the  doctrine itself this may not be said,  as the Lord Himself has asserted it . See Wordsw.’s interesting note here.
	For what  purpose they supposed this angel to have come, does not appear in the narrative.
