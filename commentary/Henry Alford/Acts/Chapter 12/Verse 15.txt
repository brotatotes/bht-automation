<p><strong> 15. </strong> <strong> ἄγγελός ἐστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> ] No other rendering but <strong> his angel</strong> will suit the sense: and with a few exceptions (Camero, Basnage, Hammond, and one or two more) all Commentators, ancient and modern, have recognized this meaning. Our Lord <em> plainly asserts the doctrine of guardian angels</em> in ref. Matt. (see note there): and from this we further learn in what sense His words were understood by the early church. From His words taken with the context ( μὴ καταφρονήσητε <strong> ἑνὸς</strong> τῶν μικρῶν τούτων ) we infer that <em> each one</em> has his guardian angel: from this passage we find not only that such was believed to be the case, but that it was supposed that such angel <em> occasionally appeared in the semblance</em> (seeing that he spoke with the voice) <em> of the person himself</em> . We do not, it is true, know who the speakers were: nor is the peculiar form in which they viewed the doctrine binding upon us: it may have been erroneous, and savouring of superstition. But of the <em> doctrine itself</em> this may not be said, <em> as the Lord Himself has asserted it</em> . See Wordsw.’s interesting note here.

<p>For what <em> purpose</em> they supposed this angel to have come, does not appear in the narrative.</p>
