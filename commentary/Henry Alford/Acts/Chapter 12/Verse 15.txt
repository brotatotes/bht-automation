<b> 15. It is his angel</b>] No other rendering but<b> his angel</b> will suit the sense: and with a few exceptions all Commentators, ancient and modern, have recognized this meaning. Our Lord<i> plainly asserts the doctrine of guardian angels</i> in Matt. xviii. 10 (see note there): and from this we further learn in what sense His words were understood by the early church. From His words, “<i>take heed that ye despise not</i><b> one</b><i> of these little ones,</i>” taken with the context, we infer that<i> each one</i> has his guardian angel: from this passage we find not only that such was believed to be the case, but that it was supposed that such angel<i> occasionally appeared in the semblance</i> (seeing that he spoke with the voice)<i> of the person himself.</i> We do not, it is true, know who the speakers were; nor is the peculiar form in which they viewed the doctrine binding upon us: it may have been erroneous, and savouring of superstition. But of the<i> doctrine itself</i> this may not be said,<i> as the Lord Himself has asserted it</i>. For what<i> purpose</i> they suppose this angel to have come, does not appear in the narrative.
