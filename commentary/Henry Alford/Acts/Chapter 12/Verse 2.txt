 2.   Ἰάκωβον ] Of him we know nothing besides what is related in the Gospels. He was the son of Zebedee, called ( Mat 4:21 ) together with John his brother: was one of the favoured Three admitted to the death-chamber of Jairus’s daughter ( Mar 5:37 ), to the mount of transfiguration ( Mat 17:1 ), and to the agony in the garden ( Mat 26:37 ). He, together with John his brother (named by our Lord ‘Boanerges,’ ‘sons of thunder’), wished to call down fire on the inhospitable Samaritans ( Luk 9:54 ), and prayed that his brother and himself might sit, one on the right hand and the other on the left, in the Lord’s kingdom ( Mat 20:20-24 ). It was then that He foretold to them their drinking of the cup of suffering and being baptized with the baptism which He was baptized with: a prophecy which James was the first to fulfil.
	 This is the only Apostle of whose death we have any certain record . With regard to all the rest, tradition varies, more or less, as to the place, or the manner, or the time of their deaths.

E. ii. 9, relates, from the Hypotyposes of Clemens, who had received it ἐκ παραδόσεως τῶν πρὸ αὐτοῦ , that the accuser of James, struck by his confession, became a Christian, and was led away with him to martyrdom, συναπήχθησαν οὖν ἄμφω , φησί , καὶ κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἠξίωσεν ἀφεθῆναι αὐτῷ ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἰακώβου . ὁ δὲ ὀλίγον σκεψάμενος , εἰρήνη σοι , εἶπε , καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτόν . καὶ οὕτως ἀμφότεροι ὁμοῦ ἐκαρατομήθησαν .
