<b> 2. James the brother of John</b>] Of him we know nothing besides what is related in the Gospels. He was the son of Zebedee, called (Matt. iv. 21) together with John his brother: was one of the favoured Three admitted to the death-chamber of Jairus’s daughter (Mark v. 37), to the mount of transfiguration (Matt. xvii. 1), and to the agony in the garden (Matt. xxvi. 37). He, together with John his brother (named by our Lord ‘Boanerges,’ ‘sons of thunder’), wished to call down fire on the inhospitable Samaritans (Luke ix. 54),—and prayed that his brother and himself’ might sit, one on the right hand and the other on the left, in the Lord’s kingdom (Matt. xx. 20–24). It was then that He foretold to them their drinking of the cup of suffering and being baptized with the baptism which He was baptized with: a prophecy which James was the first to fulfil.—<i>This is the only Apostle of whose death we have any certain record.</i> With regard to all the rest, tradition varies, more or less, as to the place, or the manner, or the time of their deaths.—Eusebius relates, from a work of Clemens, who had received it by tradition of those before him, that the accuser of Jamesm struck by his confession, became a Christian, and was led away with him to martyrdom. As they went to execution, he asked the Apostle’s forgiveness. After a moment's thought, he replied “Peace be to thee,” and kissed him: and so both were beheaded together.
