<b> 21.</b>] The account in Josephus is remarkably illustrative of the sacred text: “The third year of his reign over all Judæa was now fulfilled, and he came to the city of Cæsarea.... and gave spectacles in honour of Cæsar.... and all the rank and wealth of the province was assembled at them. And on the second day of the spectacles, he put on a vesture all wrought of silver, so that the texture was wondrous to behold, and came into the theatre at the rising of the sun, Then the silver, struck with the first glitter of the solar rays, cast a splendid reflection, dazzling the eyes of the beholders, and struck fear into them. And immediately his flatterers called out, in words unpropitious to him or any one, from all parts of the assembly hailing him as God, Be gracious to us; if we have hitherto feared thee as a man, henceforth we confess thee more than mortal. The king did not rebuke them, nor even reject this impious flattery. Looking up however shortly after, he saw an owl over his head, sitting on a rope, and straightway felt that it was a presage of mischief.” Josephus goes on to relate that he was immediately seized with a violent pain in his bowels, of which he died after five days’ agony. On the fraud committed by Eusebius in citing this account of Josephus’s, see my Greek Test.—The circumstance related in our text, of the<i> answer to the Sidonian embassy</i>, of which Josephus seems not to have been aware,<i> having been one object</i> of Herod on the occasion, shews an accuracy of detail which well accords with the view of the material of this part of the Acts having been collected at Cæsarea, where the event happened (see Introd. to Acts,§2. 11).
