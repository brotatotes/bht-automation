<b> 3.</b>] See the character of Agrippa above.<br><br><b> the days of unleavened bread</b>] Wieseler regards the whole of the following narrative as having happened on one and the same day and night, viz. that of the 14th of Nisan (April 1), A.D. 44. He takes the words in the strict meaning: that it was the<i> very day</i> of the passover, and that “<i>after the passover</i>” means, after the eating of the passover on the evening of the 14th of Nisan, and that Herod was intending to bring Peter forth on the next morning. He finds support for this in the four quaternions of soldiers, the guard for one night (see below), and maintains that the expression<b> the Passover</b> cannot apply to the whole festal period, which would have been “<i>the feast</i>” or “<i>those days.</i>” But Bleek calls this view most arbitrary and even unnatural; and I own, with all respect for Wieseler’s general acumen, I am disposed to agree with this criticism. The whole cast of the narrative,—the use of<b> days</b>, not “<i>day</i>,” as in St. Luke’s own expression in his Gospel, xxii. 7,—the intimation of<i> enduring custody</i> in the delivering him to the soldiers to keep him, the delay implied in the word<b> intending</b>,—the specification of<b> that same night</b> presupposing more nights preceding,—all this would be unaccountable in the precise historical diction of St. Luke, unless he had intended to convey an impression that<i> some days elapsed</i>. But still more decisive is his own definition of<i> the Passover</i> Luke xxii. 1, “<i>the feast of unleavened bread which is called the Passover.</i>” So that “<i>after the Passover</i>” may well be equivalent to “<i>after the feast of unleavened</i> bread.” The argument from the four quaternions of soldiers proves nothing: the same sixteen (see below) may have had him in<i> permanent</i> charge, that number being appointed as adequate to the duties required.
