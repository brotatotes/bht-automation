	 αἱ ἡμ  .   τ  .   ἀζ  . ] Wieseler (Chronol. der Apost. Zeit. pp. 215 220) regards the whole of the following narrative as having happened on one and the same day and night, viz. that of the 14th of Nisan (April 1), A.D. 44. He takes τὸ πάσχα in the strict meaning, ‘  the passover ,’ i.e. the eating of the passover on the evening of the 14th of Nisan, and thinks that Herod was intending to bring Peter forth on the next morning. He finds support for this in the four quaternions of soldiers, the guard for one night (see below), and maintains that the expression τὸ πάσ ̇ χα cannot apply to the whole festal period, which would have been τὴν ἑορτήν , or ταύτας τὰς ἡμέρας . But Bleek (Beiträge zur Ev.-kritik, p. 144) calls this view most arbitrary and even unnatural; and I own, with all respect for Wieseler’s general acumen, I am disposed to agree with this criticism. The whole cast of the narrative, the ἦσαν  αἱ ἡμέ  ραι , not ἦν  ἡ ἡμέρ  α τῶν ἀζ ., Luke’s own expression in his Gospel, Luke 22:7 , the intimation of  enduring custody in the παραδοὺς … φυλάσσειν αὐτ ., the delay implied in the βουλόμενος , in the imperfects ἐτηρεῖτο , ἦν γινομένη (not ἐγένετο ), the specification of τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ as presupposing (notwithstanding what wieseler says to the contrary) more nights preceding, all this would be unaccountable in the precise historical diction of Luke, unless he had intended to convey an impression that  some days elapsed . But still more decisive is his own definition of πάσχα , Luke 22:1 ,  ἡ ἑορτὴ τῶν ἀζύμων ,  ἡ λεγομένη πάσχα  . So that μετὰ τὸ πάσχα may well = μετὰ τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων . The argument from the four quaternions of soldiers proves nothing: the same sixteen (see below) may have had him in  permanent charge, that number being appointed as adequate to the duties required.
