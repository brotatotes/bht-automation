<b> CHAP. XIII. 1–XIV. 28.</b>] FIRST MISSIONARY JOURNEY OF PAUL AND BARNABAS.<i> Henceforward the history follows Saul</i> (or Paul, as he is now [ver. 9] and froin this time denominated)<i>, his ministry, and the events of his life, to the exclusion</i> (with the sole exception of the council in ch. xv.)<i> of all the other Apostles.</i><br><br><b> prophets</b>] See on ch. xi. 27.<br><br><b> teachers</b>] Those who had the<i> gift of teaching</i>, see 1 Cor. xii. 28; Eph. iv. 11. They were probably less immediately the organs of the Holy Spirit than the<i> prophets</i>, but under His continual guidance in the gradual and progressive work of<i> teaching the Word</i>.<br><br><b> Symeon that was called Niger</b>] Nothing is known of him. From his appellation of Niger, he may have been an African proselyte.<br><br><b> Lucius</b>] A Lucius, probably the same person, is mentioned Rom. xvi. 21 as a “<i>kinsman</i>” of Paul. There is no reason to suppose him the same with Luke (Lucas, or Lucanus),—but the contrary; for why should Paul in this case use<i> two different names?</i> See Col. iv. 14; 2 Tim. iv. 11; Philem. 24.<br><br><b> Manaen</b>] The same name with<i> Menahem</i> the king of Israel, 2 Kings xv. 14. A certain Essene, of this name, foretold to Herod the Great, when a boy going to school, that he should be king of the Jews. And in consequence, when he came to the throne, he honoured Manaen, and, on his account, all the Essenes. It is then not improbable, that this Manaen may have been a son of that one: but see below. The Herod here meant was Antipas, who with his brother Archelaus (both sons of Herod the Great by Malthace a Samaritan woman, see Matt. xiv. 1, note) were brought up in a private family at Rome. Both were at this time exiles, Antipas at Lyons, Archelaus at Vienne. This Manaen had probably been Herod’s<b> foster-brother</b>; not, ‘<i>brought up with him,</i>’ for, if he had been<i> brought up</i> with Antipas, he would<i> also have been with</i><i> Archelaus:</i> see above.—In this case, his mother may have called her infant by the name of the person who had brought the Essenes into favour with Herod, and no<i> relationship</i> with that person need have existed.<br><br><b> Saul</b>] mentioned last, perhaps because the<i> prophets</i> are placed first, and he was<i> not one</i>, but a teacher: or it may be, that he himself furnished the account. This circumstance, which has been objected to by some as invalidating the accuracy of the account, is in fact an interesting confirmation of it, as being eminently characteristic of him who spoke as in 1 Cor. xv. 9; 2 Cor. xii. 6; Eph. iii. 8.
