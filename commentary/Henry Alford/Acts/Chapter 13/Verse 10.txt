<p><strong> 10. </strong> <strong> υἱὲ διαβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Meyer supposes an indignant allusion to the name Bar-jesus. This is possible, though hardly probable (see below). <strong> διαβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , which usually has the article, is elsewhere found without it only in ( 1Pe 5:8 ) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span> , 22. See Moulton’s Winer, p. 155, note 1.

<p><strong> διαστρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> κ . τ . λ .] The οὐ παύσῃ evidently makes this apply, not to Elymas’s conduct on this occasion merely, but to his whole life of imposture and perversion of others.

<p><strong> κυρίου</strong> , here and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</span> , is Jehovah. If, as some suppose, the reading of the name Bar-jesus is Bar-jehu, the repetition may be allusive: as in the other case might the ἐχθρὲ πάς . δικαιοσύνης to the name Jesus. But Meyer supposes the various readings in the forms of the name (Barsuma, Barjesuban) to have arisen from a desire to reverence the Name <em> Jesus</em> .
