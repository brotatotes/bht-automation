<b> 13. Paul and his company</b>] Is there not a trace of the narrator being among them, in this expression?—Henceforward<i> Paul is the principal person</i>, and Barnabas is thrown into the background.<br><br><b> Perga in Pamphylia</b>] Perga lies on the Cestrus, which flows into the bay of Attaleia. It is sixty stadia (74 miles) from the mouth, “between and upon the sides of two hills, with an extensive valley in front, watered by the river Cestrus, and backed by the mountains of the Taurus.” (Conybeare and Howson, vol. i.p. 195, from Sir C. Fellows’s Asia Minor.) Tke remains are almost entirely Greek, with few traces of later inhabitants. The inhabitants of Pamphylia were nearly allied in character to those of Cilicia: and it may have been Paul’s design, having already preached in his own province, to extend the Gospel of Christ to this neighbouring people.<br><br> John probably took the opportunity of some ship sailing from Perga. His reason for returning does not appear, but may be presumed, from ch. xv. 38, to have been, unsteadiness of character, and unwillingness to face the dangers abounding in this rough district (see below). He afterwards, having been the subject of dissension between Paul and Barnabas, ch. xv. 37–40, accompanied the latter again to Cyprus; and we find him at a much later period spoken of by Paul, together with Aristarchus, and Jesus called Justus, as<i> having been a comfort to him</i> (Col. iv. 10, 11): and again in 2 Tim. iv. 11,<i> as profitable to him for the ministry.</i>
