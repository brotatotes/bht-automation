 14.   διελθόντες ] It is not improbable that during this journey Paul may have encountered some of the ‘perils by robbers’ of which he speaks, 2 Corinthians 11:26 . The tribes inhabiting the mountains which separate the table-land of Asia Minor from the coast, were notorious for their lawless and marauding habits. Strabo says of Isauria, λῃστῶν ἅπασαι κατοικίαι (xii. 6), and of the Pisidians, καθάπερ οἱ Κίλικες , λῃστρικῶς ἤσκηνται , xii. 7. He gives a similar character of the Pamphylians.
	 Ἀντιόχεια ἡ Πισιδία or πρὸς Πισιδίᾳ , Strabo, xii. 8, was founded originally (Strabo, ib.) by the Magnetes on the Meander, and subsequently by Seleucus Nicator, and became, under Augustus, a Roman colony ( ἔχουσα ἐποικίαν Ῥωμαίων , Strabo, ib.: ‘Pisidarum colonia Cæsarea, eadem Antiocheia.’ Plin. Acts 13:24 .
	‘In Pisidia juris Italici est colonia Antiochensium,’ Paulus, Digest. i. 15).
