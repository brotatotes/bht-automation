<b> 14.</b>] It is not improbable that during this journey Paul may have encountered some of the ‘perils by robbers’ of which he speaks, 2 Cor. xi. 26. The tribes inhabiting the mountains which separate the table-land of Asia Minor from the coast, were notorious for their lawless and marauding habits. Strabo says of Isauria, that its inhabitants were all robbers, and of the Pisidians, that, like the Cilicians, they have great practice in plundering. He gives a similar character of the Pamphylians. ANTIOCH IN PISIDIA was founded originally by the Magnetes on the Meander, and subsequently by Seleucus Nicator; and became, under Augustus, a Roman colony. Its position is described by Strabo as being on a hill, and was unknown or wrongly placed till Mr. Arundell found its ruins at a place now called Yalobatch, answering to Strabo’s description; where since an inscription has been found with the letters ANTIOCHEAE CAESARE.
