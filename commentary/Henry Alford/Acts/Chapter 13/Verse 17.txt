<p><strong> 17. </strong> <strong> τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου</strong> ] ‘Hoc dicit Pisidis, Judæos digito monstrans’ (Grot.). Or rather, perhaps by the τούτου indicating, <em> without gesture</em> , the people <em> in whose synagogue they were assembled</em> .

<p><strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πατ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμῶν</strong> ] It is evident that the doctrine so much insisted on afterwards by Paul, that all believers in Christ were the true children of Abraham, was fully matured already: by the τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου he alludes to the time when God was the God of the Jews only: by this ἡμῶν he unites all present in the now extended inheritance of the promises made to the fathers.

<p><strong> ὕψωσεν</strong> ] Evidently an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:2">Isaiah 1:2</span> , where the word is also used in the sense of ‘bringing up,’ nourishing to manhood. This was done by increasing them in Egypt so that they became a great nation: see ref. Gen. There is no reference to any <em> exaltation</em> of the people during their stay in Egypt: whether by their deliverance (Calv., Heinr., Elsner), or by the miracles of Moses (Meyer), or by Joseph’s preferment to honour (Beza, Grot.).</p>
