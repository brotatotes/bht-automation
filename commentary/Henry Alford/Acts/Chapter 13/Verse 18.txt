<p><strong> 18. </strong> <strong> ἐτροφοφόρησεν</strong> ] That this is the right reading, is rendered highly probable by manuscript authority here and still more in the LXX of ref. Deut., and, I conceive, <em> decided</em> by the Heb. of that passage, and by the expansion of the same image in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:12">Numbers 11:12</span> . The compound verb (from ὁ , not ἡ , τροφός , as the similitude is that of a <em> man</em> ( אִישׁ ) bearing his son) implies carrying and caring for, as a nurse: see ref. Macc.</p>
