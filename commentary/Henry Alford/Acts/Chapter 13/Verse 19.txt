<p>The unusual transitive sense of κατεκληρονόμησεν , justified by reff. LXX, has not been understood by the copyists, and has led to the rec. reading.

<p>From the occurrence of manifest references, in these opening verses of the speech, to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+1:0">Deuteronomy 1:0</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+1:0">Isaiah 1:0</span> , combined with the fact that these two chapters form the present lessons in the synagogues on one and the same sabbath, Bengel and Stier conclude that they had been then read. It may have been so: but see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:15">Acts 13:15</span> .</p>
