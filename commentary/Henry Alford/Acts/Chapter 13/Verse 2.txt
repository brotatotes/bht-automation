<b> 2. As they ministered</b>] The word in the original is that generally used to express the priestly service among the Jews, to which now had succeeded that of the<i> prophets and teachers</i> in the Christian church:<b> ministering</b> is therefore the only word adequate to render it, as A.V. More closely to define it is not only impracticable, but is narrowing an expression purposely left general.<br><br><b> the Holy Ghost said</b>] viz. by one of the prophets present, probably Symeon or Lucius: see above. The announcement being<i> to the church</i>, and several persons being mentioned, we can hardly suppose it to have been an inner command merely to some one person, as in the case of Philip, ch. viii. 29. There is in the original words of the injunction of the Spirit, a precision and force implying that it was for a special purpose, and to be obeyed at the time.<br><br><b> the work</b>] Certainly, by ver. 4, we may infer that there had been, or was simultaneously with this command, a divine intimation made to Barnabas and Saul of the nature and direction of this work.<i> In general,</i> it had already been pointed out in the case of Saul, ch. ix. 15; xxii. 21; xxvi. 17. It consisted in preaching to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, Eph. iii. 8. In virtue of the foundation of the Gentile churches being entrusted to them, Saul and Barnabas become after this Apostles, not<i> vice versa;</i> nor is there the least ground for the inference that this was a formal extension of the apostolic office, the pledge of its continuance through the episcopacy to the end of time. The apostolic office terminated with the apostolic times, and by its very nature, admitted not of continuance: the episcopal office, in its ordinary sense, sprung up after the apostolic times: and the two are entirely distinct. The confusion of the two belongs to that unsafe and slippery ground in church matters, the only logical refuge from which is in the traditional system of Rome. Jerome says, “Let bishops remember that they are greater than presbyters not so much by the strictness of divine appointment, as by custom, and that the two orders ought together to rule the church.”
