<b> 20.</b>] Taking the words as they stand,<i> no other sense</i> can be given to them, than that the time of the judges lasted 450 years. And we have<i> exactly the same chronological arrangement</i> in Josephus; who reckons 592 years from the Exodus to the building of Solomon’s temple,—arranging the period thus: (1) forty years in the wilderness: (2) twenty-five years under Joshua: (3) Judges (below): (4) forty years under Saul, see on ver. 21: (5) forty years under David, 1 Kings ii. 11: (6) four years of Solomon's own reign. This gives 592<i> minus</i> 149, i.e. 443 years (<i>about</i> 450) for the judges, including Samuel. That this chronology differs widely from 1 Kings vi. 1, is most evident,—where we read that Solomon began his temple in the four hundred and eightieth (LXX, four hundred and fortieth) after the Exodus. All attempts to reconcile the two are arbitrary and forced. See some such recounted in my Greck Test. It seems then that St. Paul followed a chronology current among the Jews, and agreeing with the book of Judges itself (the spaces of time in which, added together, come exactly to 450), and that adopted by Josephus, but not with that of our present Hebrew text of 1 Kings vi. 1.<br><br><b> Samuel</b>] mentioned as the<i> terminus</i> of the period of the Judges, also as having been so nearly concerned in the setting up over them of Saul and David.
