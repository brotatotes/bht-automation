 21.   Σαοὺλ  …   ἄνδρα ἐκ φ  .   Β  . ] It may be not altogether irrelevant to notice that a  Saul, a man of the tribe of Benjamin , was speaking; and to trace in this minute specification something characteristic and natural.
	 ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα ] So also Josephus: ἐβασίλευσε Σαοὺλ Σαμουήλου ζῶντος ἔτη ὀκτὼ πρὸς τοῖς δέκα · τελευτήσαντος δὲ δύο καὶ εἴκοσι , Antt. vi. 14. 9. In the O. T. the length of Saul’s reign is not specified; 1Sa 7:2 gives no reason, as Bengel thinks, why Saul’s reign should have been  less than twenty years , as the twenty years there mentioned do not extend to the bringing up of the ark by David, but only to the circumstances mentioned in the following verses. Biscoe has well shewn (p. 399), that as Saul was a young man when anointed king, and Ishbosheth his  youngest son ( 1Ch 8:33 ) was forty years old at his death ( 2Sa 2:10 ), his reign cannot have been much short of that period. It is clearly against the construction to suppose Samuel’s time as well as Saul’s included in the forty years, following as they do upon the ἔδωκεν . Yet this has been done by the majority of Commentators.
