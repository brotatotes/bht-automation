<b> 29.</b>] De Wette rightly remarks, that St. Paul, in this compendious narrative, makes no distinction between friend and foe in what was done to our Lord, but regards both as fulfilling God’s purpose regarding Him. I may add that there is also a contrast between what men did to Him, and<i> God's</i> raising Him, ver. 30.—Joseph and Nicodemus, be it observed, were both<i> rulers</i>. Paul touches but lightly on the cross of Christ, and hastens on to the great point, the Resurrection, as the fulfilment of prophecy and seal of the Messiahship of Jesus.
