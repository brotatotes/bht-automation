 32.   ἡμεῖς ὑμᾶς ] He and Barnabas were not of the number of the συναναβάντες , Acts 13:31 , nor was their mission to the Jewish people. ‘  They are at this moment witnessing to the people,  we , preaching to you.’ Stier observes (Red. d. Apost. p. 367) how entirely Paul sinks  himself , his history and commission from Christ, in the great object of his preaching.
	 ἀναστήσας ] The meaning  having raised Him from the dead is absolutely required by the context: both because the word is repeated with ἐκ νεκρῶν ( Act 13:34 ), and because the Apostle’s emphasis throughout the passage is on the  Resurrection ( Act 13:30 ) as the  final fulfilment ( ἐκπεπλήρωκεν )  of God’s promises regarding Jesus . This is maintained by Luther, Hammond, Le Clerc, Meyer, &c.: the other meaning, ‘  having raised up ,’ as in ch. Acts 7:37 , προφήτην ὑμῖν ἀναστήσει ὁ κύριος , by Calvin, Beza, Calov., Wolf, Michaelis, Rosenm., Heinrichs, Kuinoel, Olsh., and by Mr. Humphry. Meyer well remarks, that this meaning would hardly in our passage have been thought of or defended, had it not been that the subjoined citation from Psalms 2:0 has been thought necessarily to apply to our Lord’s  mission upon earth .
