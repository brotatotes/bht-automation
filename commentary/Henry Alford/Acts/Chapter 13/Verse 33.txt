<b> 33. in that he hath raised up Jesus</b>] The term<b> raised up</b> is ambiguous: but here the meaning,<b> from the dead</b>, is absolutely required by the context; both because the word is repeated with that addition (ver. 34), and because the Apostle’s emphasis throughout the passage is on the<i> Resurrection</i> (ver. 30) as the<i> final fulfilment of God’s promises regarding Jesus</i>. The other meaning, ‘<i>having raised up</i>,’ as in ch. vii. 37, is however maintained by several Commentators. Meyer well remarks, that this meaning would hardly in our passage have been thought of or defended, had it not been that the subjoined citation from Ps. ii. has been thought necessarily to apply to our Lord’s<i> mission upon earth</i>.<br><br> The reading of some of our ancient authorities here,<i> in the</i><b> first</b><i> psalm</i>, is to be accounted for by the fact that anciently our second Psalm was the first,<i> our</i> first being reckoned as prefatory. St. Paul<br><br> refers the prophecy in its full completion to the<i> Resurrection</i> of our Lord: similarly in Rom. i. 4, “<i>declared to be the Son of God with power.... by the resurrection from the dead.</i>”
