 34.   μηκέτι μέλλ  . ] Compare Romans 6:9 , χριστὸς ἐγερθεὶς ἐκ νεκρῶν οὐκέτι ἀποθνήσκει · θἁνατος αὐτοῦ οὐκέτι κυριεύει . It is interesting to trace the same shades of thought in the speeches and epistles of Paul; and abundant opportunity of doing so will occur as we proceed.
	But here the ὑποστρ . εἰς διαφθ . does not merely imply  death , so that Jesus should have once undergone it, and no more hereafter, as the E. V. seems to imply: but we must supply ‘to die, and in consequence to’ before the words, understanding them as the  result of death, if it had dominion over him : thus the clause answers even more remarkably to Romans 6:9 .
	 τὰ ὅσια is the LXX rendering of חַסְדֵי , ref. Isa., which in 2 Chronicles 6:42 , they have translated τὰ ἐλέη . The word ‘holy’ should have been preserved in the E. V., as answering to τὸν ὅσιόν σου below;  the mercies of David, holy and sure : or  my holy promises which I made sore unto David.
