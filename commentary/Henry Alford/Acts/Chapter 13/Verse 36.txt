 36 .] The psalm, though spoken by David, cannot have its fulfilment  in David .
	 ἰδίᾳ γενεᾷ ] The dative  commodi , not ‘sua generatione,’ which is flat in the extreme. David ministered only to  the generation in which he lived : but διὰ  τούτου , remission of sins is preached ὑμῖν , and to  all who believe on Him .
	 τῇ τοῦ θ  .   βουλῇ is best taken with ὑπηρετήσας , not with ἐκοιμήθη : as E. V.,  after he had served his own generation by the will (i.e. according to the appointment)  of God . His whole course was marked out and fixed by God he fulfilled it, and fell asleep. I prefer this, because joining τῇ τοῦ θ . β . with ἐκοιμήθη seems to diminish the importance of that verb in the sentence. (See, on the whole, 2 Samuel 7:12 ; 1 Kings 2:10 .)
	 προσετ  . κ . τ . λ .] An expression arising from the practice of burying families together: see reff. and passim in O. T.
