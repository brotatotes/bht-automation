<b> 38.</b>] Paul speaks here of justification only in its<i> lowest</i> sense, as negative, and synonymous with remission of sins; he does not unfold here that higher sense of<i> justifying</i>, the<i> accounting righteous</i>, which those who have from God are<i> just by faith</i>. It is the first office of the Spirit by which he spoke, to convict concerning sin, before He convicts concerning righteousness: therefore he dwells on the<i> remission of sins</i>, merely just giving a glimpse of the great doctrine of justification, of which he had such wonderful things to write and to say.
