<b> 39.</b>] And from<b> all things</b> (sin), from which ye<b> could not in</b> (under)<b> the law of Moses be justified in Him</b> (as in the expression,<i> in Christ, in the Lord,</i> frequently),<b> every believer is</b> (habitual present tense)<b> justified</b>.... but not implying that in the law of Moses there might be justification from<i> some</i> sins;—under the law there is<i> no</i> justification (Gal. iii. 11):—but it means<b> Christ shall do for you all that the law</b><b> could not do</b>: leaving it for inference, or for further teaching, that this was absolutely ALL: that the law could do<i> nothing.</i> The same thought is expanded Rom. viii. 3. This interpretation will be the more clearly established, when we remember that<i> to justify from sin</i> was not in any sense, and could not be the office of the law, by which came the knowledge of sin. The expression “<i>to justify from</i>” is only once used again by St. Paul (Rom. vi. 7, marginal rendering: the A.V. has “<i>freed from sin</i>,” but wrongly), and that where he is arguing against the continuing in sin.<b> every one that believeth</b> is not to be joined with<b> in him</b>, which (see above) is contrasted with<b> in the law of Moses</b>.—It is quite in St. Paul’s manner to use<i> every one that believeth</i> thus absolutely: see Rom. i. 16; iii. 22; x. 4 (Gal. iii. 22).
