 39. ]  [And] from all things, from which ye could not in (under)  the law of Moses be justified, in Him (as ἐν χριστῷ , ἐν κυρίῳ passim)  every believer is (habitual pres.)  justified .  ἀπὸ πάντων ( ἀφ ʼ)  ὧν  , from all things (sins),  from which .… but not implying that in the law of Moses there might be justification from  some sins; under the law there is  no justification ( ἐν νόμῳ οὐδεὶς δικαιοῦται παρὰ τῷ θεῷ , Gal 3:11 ): but =  Christ shall do for you all that the law could not do : leaving it for inference, or for further teaching, that this was absolutely ALL: that the law could do  nothing . The same thought is expanded Romans 8:3-4 , τὸ γὰρ ἀδύνατον τοῦ νόμου , ἐν ᾧ ἠσθένει διὰ τῆς σαρκός , ὁ θεὸς κ . τ . λ .… ἵνα τὸ δικαίωμα τ . νόμου πληρωθῇ ἐν ἡμῖν . This interpretation will be the more clearly established, when we remember that δικαιοῦν ἀπὸ ἁμαρτίας was not in any sense, and could not be, the office of the law, by which came the knowledge of sin. The expression δικαιοῦν ἀπὸ is only once used again by Paul (ref.), and that where he is arguing against the continuing in sin. ὁ πιστεύων is not to be joined with ἐν τούτῳ , which (see above) is contrasted with ἐν νόμῳ Μ . It is quite in Paul’s manner to use πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων thus absolutely: see Romans 1:16 ; Romans 3:22 ; Romans 10:4 ( Gal 3:22 ). Still less, with Luther, can we take as far as δικαιωθῆναι with Acts 13:38 , and make ἐν τούτῳ .… δικαιοῦται a separate sentence.
