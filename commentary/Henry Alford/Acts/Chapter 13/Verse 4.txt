<b> 4. being sent forth</b>] Under the guidance of the Spirit, who directed their course.<br><br><b> Seleucia</b>] A very strong fortified city (supposed impregnable) fifteen miles from Antioch,—on the Orontes, and five miles from its mouth. It was founded and fortified by Seleucus Nicator, who was buried there. It was called<i> Seleucia ad Mare,</i>—and<i> Pieria</i>, from Mount Pierius, on which it was built, to distinguish it from other Syrian towns of the same name. Polybius mentions, that it has but one approach from the sea, steep, and excavated by hand, with frequent flights of stairs. This excavated way is to this day conspicuous amongst the ruins of the city. It was under the Seleucid kings the capital of a district Seleucis,—and, since Pompey’s time, a<i> free city</i>.<br><br><b> they sailed to Cyprus</b>] The lofty outline of Cyprus is visible from the mouth of the Orontes. See below, ver. 7. It was the native country of Barnabas,—and, as John Mark was his kinsman, they were likely to find more acceptance there than in other parts.
