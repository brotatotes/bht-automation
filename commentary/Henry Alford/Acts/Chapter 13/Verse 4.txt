 4.   ἐκπεμφ  . ] Under the guidance of the Spirit, who directed their course.
	 Σελεύκειαν ] A very strong fortified city (supposed impregnable, Strabo, xvi. p. 751), fifteen miles from Antioch, on the Orontes, and five miles from its month. It was founded and fortified by Seleucus Nicator (Strabo, xvi. 749), who was buried there (Appian, Syr. 63). It was called  seleucia ad mare , and  Pieria , or ἡ ἐν Πιερίᾳ , from Mount Pierius, on which it was built, to distinguish it from other Syrian towns of the same name. This mountain is called Coryphæus, Polyb. v. 59, where is a minute description of the town and its site. Among other particulars he mentions, πρόσβασιν δὲ μίαν ἔχει κατὰ τὴν ἀπὸ θαλάττης πλευρὰν κλιμακωτὴν καὶ χειροποίητον , ἐγκλίμασι καὶ σκαλώμασι πυκνοῖς καὶ συνεχέσι διειλημένην . This excavated way is to this day conspicuous amongst the ruins of the city. It was under the Seleucid kings the capital of a district Selencis, and, since Pompey’s time, a  free city , Strabo, xvi. 751. Plin. Acts 13:21 (Winer, Realw.; and Mr. Lewin, Life of St. Paul, from an art, by Col. Chesney in the Geogr. Society’s Transactions.)
	 εἰς Κύπρον ] The lofty outline of Cyprus is visible from the mouth of the Orontes (C. and H., edn. 2, i. p. 164). see below, Acts 13:7 . It was the native country of Barnabas, and, as John Mark was his kinsman, they were likely to find more acceptance there than in other parts.
