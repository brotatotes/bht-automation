<b> 41. ye despisers</b>] So the LXX render the Hebrew word, signifying ‘<i>among the heathen</i>,’ so in A.V., for which they seem to have read some other word resembling it.—The prophecy was spoken of the judgment to be inflicted by means of the Chaldæans: but neither this nor any other prophecy is confined in its application to the occasion of which it was once spoken, but gathers up under it all analogous procedures of God’s providence: such repeated fulfilments increasing in weight, and approaching nearer and nearer to that last and great fulfilment of all the promises of grace and all the threats of wrath, by which every prophetic word shall be exhausted.
