<p><strong> 42.</strong> ] The insertions in the rec. have been made (see var. readd.) partly perhaps to remove the ambiguity in αὐτῶν , and to supply a subject to παρεκάλουν . But they confuse the sense.

<p><strong> ἐξιόντων αὐτ</strong> <strong> ., As they</strong> (the congregation) <strong> were going out, they</strong> (the same) <strong> besought</strong> .

<p>On the N.T. construction, <strong> παρεκάλουν λαληθῆναι</strong> , i.e. the passive inf. after verbs of commanding, exhorting, &amp;c., see Buttmann, Grammatik des N. T.-lichen Sprachgebrauchs, § 141. 5, p. 236. He traces it to the influence of the Latin <em> jubere</em> and the like. See, among his many examples, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:43">Mark 5:43</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:27">Mark 6:27</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:21">Acts 5:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:24">Acts 22:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:21">Acts 25:21</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τὸ μεταξὺ σάβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> appears, by the usage of Luke, to mean <strong> the next sabbath-day</strong> , not ‘ <em> the following week</em> .’ This last rendering would hardly suit εἰς , which fixes a definite occasion, nor <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:44">Acts 13:44</span> , which gives the result. The ref. to Josephus abundantly justifies this use of μεταξύ .</p>
