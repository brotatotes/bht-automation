<b> 48. as many as were disposed to eternal life</b>] ‘The meaning of this word<b> disposed</b> must be determined by the context. The Jews had<i> judged themselves unworthy of eternal life:</i> the Gentiles, as many as were disposed to eternal life, believed.<i> By whom</i> so disposed, is not<i> here</i> declared: nor need the word be in this place further particularized.<i> We know, that it is</i> GOD<i> who worketh in us the will to believe</i>, and that the preparation of the heart is of Him: but to find in<i> this text</i> pre-ordination to life asserted, is to force both the word and the context to a meaning which they do not contain. The word in the original is the same as in 1 Cor. xvi. 15, where it is said that the house of Stephanas “<b>have addicted themselves</b><i> to the ministry of the saints</i>,” and in Rom. xvii. 1, where it is said that “<i>the powers that be are</i><b> ordained</b><i> of God:</i>” in both of which places the<i> agents</i> are expressed, whereas here the word is used absolutely, without an agent expressed. Calvin, &c., find here<i> predestination in the strongest sense:</i> “This ordaining can be referred only to the eternal decree of God... It is a ridiculous cavil to refer it to the<i> mind of those who believed</i>, as if they received the Gospel who were properly disposed in their minds.” So the Vulgate translates the word “<i>pre-ordained;</i>” and Augustine, “<i>destined</i>.” here are several other renderings, which see in my Greek Test. Dr. Wordsworth well observes, that it would be interesting to enquire what influence such renderings as this of “<i>pre-ordained</i>” in the Vulgate version had on the minds of men like St. Augustine and his followers in the Western Church, in treating the great questions of free will, election, reprobation, and final perseverance; and on some writers in the reformed churches who, though rejecting the authority of that version, were yet swayed by it away from the sense of the original, here and in ch. ii. 47. The tendency of the Eastern Fathers, who read the original Greek, was, he remarks, in a different direction from that of the Western School.
