<b> 9. who also is called Paul</b>] This notice marks the transition from the former part of his history, where he is uniformly called Saul, to the latter and larger portion, where he is without exception known as Paul. I do not regard it as indicative of any change of name at the time of this incident, or<i> from</i> that time: the evidence which I deduce from it is of a different kind, and not without interest to enquirers into the character and authorship of our history. Hitherto, our Evangelist has been describing events, the truth of which he had ascertained by research and from the narratives of others. But henceforward there is reason to think that the joint memoirs of himself and the great Apostle furnish the material of the book. In those memoirs the Apostle is universally known by the name PAUL, which superseded the other. If this was the first incident at which Luke was present, or the first memoir derived from Paul himself, or, which is plain, however doubtful may be the other alternatives, the commencement of that part of the history which is to narrate the teaching and travels of the Apostle Paul,—it would be natural that a note should be made, identifying the two names as belonging to the same person.—The<b> also</b> must not be understood as having any reference to<i> Sergius Paulus</i>, or as meaning that the Apostle<i> ‘also</i> (as well as Sergius) was called Paul.’ It signifies that Paulus was a<i> second name</i> borne by Saul, in conformity with a Jewish practice as old as the captivity (or even as Joseph, see Gen. xli. 45), of adopting a Gentile name. Mr. Howson traces it through the Persian period (see Dan. i. 7; Esth. ii. 7), the Greek (1 Macc. xii. 16; xvi. 11; 2 Macc. iv. 29), and the Roman (ch. i. 23; xiii. 1; xviii. 8, &c.), and the middle ages, down to modern times. Jerome has conjectured that the name was adopted by Saul<i> in memory of this event</i>; the subjugation of Sergius Paulus to Christ, as the first fruits of his preaching—in the same way as Scipio after the conquest of Africa was called Africanus, and Metellus was called Creticus after the conquest of Crete. It is strange that any one could be found capable of so utterly mistaking the character of St. Paul, or of producing so unfortunate an analogy to justify the mistake. It is yet stranger that Augustine should, in his Confessions, adopt the same view: “He who was the least of Thine Apostles,... loved to be called Paul, instead of Saul, as before, to commemorate so great a victory.” So also Olshausen. A more probable way of accounting for the additional name is pointed out by observing that such new names were often alliterative of or allusive to the original Jewish name:—he who was Jesus as a Jew, was called Jason or Justus, Col. iv. 11: see other examples in my Greek Test.
