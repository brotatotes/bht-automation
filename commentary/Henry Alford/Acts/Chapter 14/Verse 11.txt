 11.   Λυκαονιστί ] The nature of this dialect is uncertain: its existence is further mentioned by Steph. Byzant., cf. τῇ τῶν Λυκαόνων φωνῇ , in note on Acts 14:20 . The notice is inserted to shew that the Apostles  had no knowledge of the inference drawn by the crowd , till they saw the bulls being brought to their doors, Acts 14:13 . So Chrysostom: οὐκ ἦν τοῦτο οὐδέπω δῆλον τῇ γὰρ οἰκείᾳ φωνῇ ἐφθέγγοντο , λέγοντες κ . τ . λ . διὰ τοῦτο οὐδὲν αὐτοῖς ἔλεγον (meaning, “for this reason they, the Lycaonians, spoke unintelligibly to the Apostles:” ἔλεγον taking up the λέγοντες . Wordsw. has, in his ardour to vindicate Chrysostom from heterodoxy, fallen into the mistake of rendering, “therefore the Apostles said nothing to them”)· ἐπειδὴ δὲ εἶδον τὰ στέμματα , τότε ἐξελθόντες κ . τ . λ . Hom. xxx., p. 235 f.
	See, on the real nature of the gift of tongues, and the bearing of notices of this kind on its consideration, the note on ch. Acts 2:4 .
	These ἐπιφάνειαι of the gods are frequent subjects of heathen poetry and mythology. Hom. Od.  ρ . 484, says, καί τε θεοὶ ξείνοισιν ἐοικότες ἀλλοδαποῖσι Παντοῖοι τελέθοντες ἐπιστρωφῶσι πόληας . It was in the neighbouring country of Phrygia that Jupiter and Mercury were said to have wandered, and to have been entertained by Baucis and Philemon: ‘Jupiter huc, specie mortali, cumque parente Venit Atlantiades positis caducifer alis.’ (Ov. Met. viii. 626, f.) Dio Chrysostom (Orat. xxxiii. p. 408) says, φασὶ τοὺς οἰκιστὰς ἥρωας ἢ θεοὺς πολλάκις ἐπιστρέφεσθαι τὰς αὑτῶν πόλεις . (From Mr. Humphry’s note.)
