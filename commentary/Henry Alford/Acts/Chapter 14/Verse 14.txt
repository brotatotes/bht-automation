<b> 14. the apostles</b>] This is the first place where Paul and Barnabas are so called. St. Paul constantly claims for himself the title in his Epistles: see Rom. i. 1; 1 Cor. i. 1; ix. 1; xv. 9; 2 Cor. i. 1; Gal. i. 1; Col. i. 1; 1 Tim. i. 1; 2 Tim. i. 1; Tit. i. 1. It seems to have been borne in this higher sense also by James the Lordâ€™s brother: see Gal. i. 19, and note, and the Introduction to the Epistle of James: and by Barnabas, here and in 1 Cor. ix. 5, 6: see also Gal. ii. 9. So that there were, widening the word beyond the Twelve, fifteen Apostles, usually so called. The word was also used in a still wider sense: see Rom. xvi. 7; 2 Cor. viii. 23 (marginal rendering); 1 Thess. ii. 6: in which latter place Silvanus and Timotheus seem to be included in it. The Apostles were<i> within:</i> on being told, they<b> rushed forth</b> into the crowd.
