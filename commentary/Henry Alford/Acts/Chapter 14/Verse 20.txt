	 ἀναστάς ] The  prima facie , and I think the right impression is, that this recovery was  supernatural . It is not indeed so strongly implied, as to leave no doubt: especially as a blow from a stone would be likely to stun and occasion the appearance of death.
	 Δέρβην ] See above, on Acts 14:6 . Strabo, xii. 6, says of it, τῆς δ ʼ Ἰσαυρικῆς ἐστιν ἐν πλευραῖς ἡ Δέρβη , μάλιστα τῇ Καππαδοκίᾳ ἐπιπεφυκός , τὸ τοῦ Ἀντιπάτρου τυραννεῖον τοῦ Δερβήτου (cf. Cicero, Epp. xiii. 73, ‘Cum Antipatro Derbete mihi non solum hospitium verum etiam summa familiaritas intercedit’) … ἐφ ʼ ἡμῶν δὲ καὶ τὰ Ἴσαυρα κ . τὴν Δέρβην Ἀμύντας εἶχεν , ἐπιθέμενος τῷ Δερβήτῃ , κ . ἀνελὼν αὐτόν . And Stephanus Byzantinus, Δέρβη φρούριον Ἰσαυρίας καὶ λιμήν (for this, evidently an error, the French translators of Strabo propose to read λίμνη . There is a large lake, now called Ak Göl, near the presumed site of Derbe, see C. and H. i. 239).… τινὲς δὲ Δέλβειαν , ὅ ἐστι τῇ τῶν Λυκαόνων φωνῇ ἄρκευθος . (Wetst.) From this variety of the name, Δέλβεια , Mr. Hamilton thought the modern Divlé might be Derbe. Mr. Lewin (i. 167) objects, that there is no lake near Divlé: but this objection only affects the conjectural emendation mentioned above. From Derbe not being enumerated, 2 Timothy 3:11 , with Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, as the scene of any of Paul’s sufferings, we may perhaps infer that none befell him there.
	They may have fled to Derbe, as being in a different jurisdiction from Lystra; the latter being comprised in the Roman province of Galatia, whereas Derbe seems to have belonged at this time to Antiochus, king of Commagene. See Lewin, i. p. 168; Strabo, xiv. 5; Dio, lix. 8; lx. 8; Jos. Antt. xix. 5. 1.
