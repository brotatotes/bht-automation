<b> 23. when they had elected them elders</b>] The verb means,<i> appointed by suffrage:</i> and probably, by the analogy of ch. vi. 2–6 (see 2 Cor. viii. 19), the strict meaning is here to be retained. The word will not bear Jerome’s and Chrysostom’s sense of ‘<i>laying on</i> of hands,’ adopted by Roman Catholic expositors. Nor is there any reason here for departing from the usual meaning of electing by shew of hands. The Apostles may have admitted by ordination those<i> presbyters whom the churches elected.</i>
