<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] So Virg. Æn. ii. 39, ‘Scinditur incertum studia in contraria vulgus.’ Such a split into two factions was a common occurrence, on far less important occasions, in these cities of Oriental Greeks. (C. and H. i. p. 223.)

<p><strong> τοῖς ἀποστόλοις</strong> ] This is the first place where Paul and Barnabas are so called. St. Paul constantly vindicates the title in his Epistles: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:1">Romans 1:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span> ; Col 1:1 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:1">1 Timothy 1:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:1">2 Timothy 1:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1">Titus 1:1</span> . It seems to have been borne in this higher sense also by James the Lord’s brother: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:19">Galatians 1:19</span> , and note, and the prolegg. to the Epistle of James: and by Barnabas, here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5-6">1 Corinthians 9:5-6</span> ; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span> . So that there were, widening the word beyond the Twelve, fifteen Apostles, usually so called. The word was also used in a still wider sense: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</span> ; in which latter place Silvanus and Timotheus seem to be included in it.</p>
