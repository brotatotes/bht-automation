Romans 1:1 ; 1 Corinthians 1:1 ; 1 Corinthians 9:1 ; 1 Corinthians 15:9 ; 2 Corinthians 1:1 ; Galatians 1:1 ; Col 1:1 ; 1 Timothy 1:1 ; 2 Timothy 1:1 ; Titus 1:1 . It seems to have been borne in this higher sense also by James the Lord’s brother: see Galatians 1:19 , and note, and the prolegg. to the Epistle of James: and by Barnabas, here and in 1 Corinthians 9:5-6 ; see also Galatians 2:9 . So that there were, widening the word beyond the Twelve, fifteen Apostles, usually so called. The word was also used in a still wider sense: see Romans 16:7 ; 2 Corinthians 8:23 ; 1 Thessalonians 2:6 ; in which latter place Silvanus and Timotheus seem to be included in it.
