<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] <strong> ὁρμή</strong> is not a <em> rush</em> (‘impetus,’ Vulg.: ‘assault,’ E. V.), but as Hesych [76] βουλή , ἐπιθυμία , as is manifest from συνιδόντες , rightly rendered in <strong> E. V. they were ware of it</strong> ; which it would be strange if they were not, if an <em> assault</em> had been made on them.
