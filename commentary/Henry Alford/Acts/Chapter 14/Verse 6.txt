<b> 6. Lystra</b>] This, as well as Derbe (of both which very little further is known), was probably a small town at the foot of the singular mountain-mass known as the Kara-dagh, or black mountain, Lystra being S., and Derbe S.E. from Iconium. The sites are very uncertain. There are the ruins of about forty Christian churches on the north side of the Kara-dagh, at a place called by the Turks Binbir-Kilisseh (the 1001 churches), which the most recent travellers believe may be Lystra. In one of these places (probably at Lystra, see note, ch. xvi. 1) Paul found and took up Timothy on his second journey; and from the expression “<i>my beloved child</i>” in 1 Cor. iv. 17, compared with the use of “<i>father</i>” in the same chapter, as defined ver. 15, we are justified in concluding that he had been converted<i> by the Apostle</i>; and, if so, during<i> this visit</i>.—There appear to have been few Jews in the district: we hear of no synagogue.<b> Lycaonia]</b> Strabo describes Lycaonia as a hilly plain among the mountain-spurs of Taurus, very ill watered, cold and bare, but exceedingly adapted for sheep-pasture and the growth of wool.
