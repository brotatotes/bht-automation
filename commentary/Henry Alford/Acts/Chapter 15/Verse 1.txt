<b> 1. certain men</b>] Called in Gal. ii. 4 “<i>false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus.</i>” Some of our later MSS. read, “certain men of the sect of the Pharisees which believed,” as in ver. 5. Doubtless it was so. In spite of the special revelations which had accompanied the reception of the first Gentiles into the church, the strong Judaizing party adhered to their old prejudices respecting the necessity of conformity to the law of Moses. With this party Paul was in conflict all his life; and even long after, we find it raising its head again in the sects of the Ebionites and the Nazarenes.—Neander notices the account in Josephus, where Izates, K. of Adiabene, is converted to Judaism by a certain Ananias, who, for fear of a commotion among his people allows him to remain uncircumcised—when a certain Eleazar, who had the reputation of being very strict about his national observances, prevails on him to perform the rite, for that without it he could not be a Jew.
