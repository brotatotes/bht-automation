<p><strong> ζυγόν</strong> ] See ref. Gal. Peter could not be so much referring to the mere outward observance of ceremonies, which he himself and the Jewish converts thought it expedient to retain, but to the imposition of the law, as a condition of salvation, on the consciences of the disciples. So Neander (Pfl. u. L. p. 214). This being so, οὔτε … βαστάσαι will refer, not to the <em> burdensomeness</em> of ceremonies, but to the far more grievous burden of legal death, of which Paul cries out so bitterly in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span> , and says, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:3">Galatians 5:3</span> , μαρτύρομαι … παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ περιτεμνομένῳ , ὅτι <strong> ὀφειλέτης ἐστὶν ὅλον τὸν νόμον ποιῆσαι</strong> .</p>
