Act 14:4 ), not one of the twelve. If we may presume to judge from the character of his Epistle, to say nothing of the particulars which tradition has handed down concerning him, his decision would come with remarkable weight on this occasion. For he is, among all the sacred writers of the N. T., the representative of the strictest adherence to and loftiest appreciation of the <em> pure standard of legal morality</em> . All that the law was, from its intrinsic holiness, justice, and goodness ( Rom 7:12 ), capable of being to Christians, <em> he</em> would be sure to attribute to it. And therefore when <em> his judgment</em> , as well as that of Peter, is given in favour of the freedom of the Gentiles, the disputers, even of the Pharisaic party, are silenced. There does not seem to be in the following speech any decision <em> ex cathedra</em> , either in the ἀκούσατέ μου , or in the ἐγὼ κρίνω ( Act 15:19 ): the decision lay in the weightiness, partly no doubt of the person speaking, but principally of the matter spoken by him.</p>
