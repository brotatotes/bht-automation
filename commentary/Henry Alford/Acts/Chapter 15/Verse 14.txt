<b> 14. Symeon</b>] James characteristically uses this Jewish form of the name: so also Peter himself, 2 Pet. i. 1 (original; and margin, A.V.). The name occurs Gen. xxix. 33, LXX; Luke ii. 25; iii. 30; ch. xiii. 1; Rev. vii. 7: the name Simon, elsewhere used in the N.T. for Peter, is found (Shimon) in 1 Chron. iv. 20.
