<b> 18.</b>] The variation of reading here is remarkable. The text which I have given is in all probability the original, and the words inserted in the common text have been intended as a help out of the difficulty. Not only are they wanting in several ancient MSS., but they bear the sure mark of spuriousness,—manifold variations in the MSS. where they do occur. The sense, and account of the text seem to be this: the Apostle paraphrases the words<b> who maketh</b> [all]<b> these things</b> of the LXX, adding<b> known from the beginning of the world</b>, and intending to express ‘saith the Lord, who from the beginning revealed these things,’ viz. by the prophet just cited. The addition has been made to fill up the apparently elliptical “<i>known from the beginning of the world,</i>” which not being found in the passage of Amos, was regarded as a sentence by itself. These last words may perhaps be an allusion to the mystery of the admission of the Gentiles into the church, which was now being revealed practically, and had been from of old announced by the prophets: compare Rom. xvi. 25, 26; Eph. iii. 5, 6, &c.
