<b> 2.</b>] Compare Gal. ii. 5.<br><br><b> should go up to Jerusalem</b>] I assume here what seems to me to be almost beyond the possibility of question, that this journey was the same as that mentioned Gal. ii, 1–10. In that case, Paul there (ver. 2) says that he went up “<i>by revelation</i>.” In this expression I cannot see it necessarily implied that the revelation was made to<i> himself</i>, but that there was some intimation of the Holy Ghost, similar perhaps to that in ch. xiii. 2, in accordance with which the church at Antioch sent him and Barnabas;—there being<i> prophets</i> there, by whom the Spirit spoke His will.<br><br><b> certain other of them</b>] Titus was one, Gal. ii. 1, 3, and that, in all probability, in order to<i> give an example of a Gentile convert of the uncircumcision endowed with gifts of the Holy Spirit.</i> Titus is<i> not mentioned in the Acts;</i> but only in 2 Cor., Gal., 2 Tim,, and the epistle addressed to him.
