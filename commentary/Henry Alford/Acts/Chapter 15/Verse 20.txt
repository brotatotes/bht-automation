<b> 20.</b>] The<b> pollutions of idols</b> are the things polluted by being offered to idols, about which there was munch doubt and contention in the early church:-see Exod. xxxiv. 15, and 1 Cor. viii. and x. 19.<br><br><b> fornication</b>] It may seem strange that a<i> positive sin</i> should be made the subject of these enactments which mostly regard things in themselves indifferent, but rendered otherwise by expediency and charity to others. In consequence we have the following attempts to evade the simple rendering of the word: (1) Some explain it of<i> spiritual fornication</i> in eating things offered to idols: (2) others, of the committal of actual fornication at the<i> rites in idol temples</i>, &c. See further in my Greek Test. But the solution will best be found in the fact, that<i> fornication</i> was universally in the Gentile world regarded on the same footing with the other things mentioned, as<i> indifferent</i>, and is classed here as Gentiles would be accustomed to hear of it, among those things which they allowed themselves, but which the Jews regarded as forbidden. The moral abomination of the practice is not here in question, but is abundantly set forth by our Lord and his Apostles in other places.<br><br><b> things strangled</b>]<i> as containing the blood</i>,â€”see Levit. xvii. 13, 14.<br><br><b> blood</b>] in any shape: see Gen. ix. 4; Levit. xvii. 13, 14; Deut. xii. 23, 24. Some of the fathers, and others, interpret the word of<i> homicide</i>, which is refuted by the context.
