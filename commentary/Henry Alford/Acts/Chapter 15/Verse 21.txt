Other meanings have been proposed: as ‘that it was superfluous to command these things to the Jews, for they would hear them in the synagogues’ (so an ancient Schol., Lyra, and Neander), whereas no question whatever was raised about Jewish converts: ‘neque est metuendum, ut Moses propterea antiquetur,’ Erasmus, al.: ‘Pudori vobis foret et ignominiæ, si vos, homines Christiani … hac in re inferiores a Judæis deprehenderemini, quod vos communione cum epulis sacrificialibus polytheismo favere videremini, quum illi Judæi … monotheismo adhæreant tenacissime, eumque quavis septimana sibi inculcatum audiant,’ Heinrichs.

On the reading of the law, &c., in the synagogues, see ch. Acts 13:15 , note.
