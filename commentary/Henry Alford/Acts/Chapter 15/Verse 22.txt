<b> 22. Barsabas</b>] In most of our old authorities,<b> Barsabbas.</b> Of this Judas nothing further is known than that (ver. 32) he was a ‘prophet’ (see ch. xiii. 1). Wolf and Grotius hold him to have been the brother of Joseph Barsabas, ch. i. 23.<br><br><b> Silas</b>] otherwise Silvanus: the former name is found in the Acts, the latter in the Epp. of Paul. He also was a ‘prophet’ (ver. 32). He accompanied Paul on his second missionary journey through Asia Minor and Macedonia (ver. 40–ch. xvii. 10),—remained behind in Berea (xvii. 14), and joined Paul again in Corinth (xviii. 5; 1 Thess. i. 1; 2 Thess. i. 1), where he preached with Paul and Timotheus (2 Cor. i. 19). Whether the Silvanus (1 Pet. v. 12), by whom the first Epistle of Peter was carried to the churches of Asia Minor, was the same person, is altogether uncertain. Tradition distinguishes Silas from Silvanus, making the former bishop of Corinth, the latter of Thessalonica. On the hypothesis which identifies Silas with Luke, and makes him the author of the Acts, see Introduction to Acts,§1. 11. b, c. I may repeat here, that in my mind the description of Silas here as one ot the “<i>chief men among the brethren</i>,” of itself, especially when contrasted with the preface to Luke’s gospel, would suffice to refute the notion. It has been also supposed that Silas (because it may signify<i> third</i> in Hebrew) is the same name with<i> Tertius</i> who<i> wrote</i> the Ep. to the Romans, Rom. xvi. 22: but without reason.
