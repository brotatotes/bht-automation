<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] <strong> ἐκλεξαμένους</strong> must not (with Kuin., al.) be taken for ἐκλεχθέντας ; the 1 aor. middle can <em> never</em> have a passive signification: see Lobeck’s note on Phrynichus, p. 319: where he gives a collection of seeming instances of such usage and explains them.

<p>Such irregularities of <em> case</em> in words in apposition as we have here ( ἀποστόλοις .… ἐκλεξαμένους .… γράψαντες .…) will not surprise any one versed in Hellenistic Greek. See e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:73-74">Luke 1:73-74</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:27">Acts 25:27</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span> ; also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span> , ἐγένετο δέ μοι ὑπο στρέψαντι … κ . προσευχομένου μου .… γενέσθαι με ἐν ἐκστάσει .… and ref.

<p><strong> Βαρσαββᾶν</strong> ] Of this Judas nothing further is known than that ( Act 15:32 ) he was a ‘prophet’ (see ch. Act 13:1 ). Wolf and Grotius hold him to have been the brother of Joseph Barsabas, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:23">Acts 1:23</span> .

<p><strong> Σίλαν</strong> ] otherwise Silvanus ( Σιλουανός ): the former name [is found] in the Acts, the latter in the Epistles of Paul. He also was a ‘prophet’ ( Act 15:32 ). He accompanied Paul on his second missionary journey through Asia Minor and Macedonia ( Act 15:40 ch. Act 17:10 ), remained behind in Berœa ( Act 17:14 ), and joined Paul again in Corinth ( Act 18:5 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</span> ; 2Th 1:1 ), where he preached with Paul and Timotheus ( 2Co 1:19 ). The Silvanus ( 1Pe 5:12 ), by whom the first Epistle of Peter was carried to the churches of Asia Minor, seems to be the same person. Tradition however distinguishes Silas from Silvanus, making the former bishop of Corinth, the latter of Thessalonica. On the hypothesis which identifies Silas with Luke and makes him the author of the Acts, see Prolegg. to Acts, § i. 11. β , γ . I may repeat here, that in my mind the description of Silas here as one of the ἡγούμενοι ἐν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς , of itself, especially when contrasted with the preface to Luke’s gospel, would suffice to refute the notion. It has been also supposed (by Burmann) that Silas ( שְׁלִישׁי ) [ <em> third</em> ] is the same name with Tertius, who wrote the Epistle to the Romans, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:22">Romans 16:22</span> ; but without reason: see Winer, Realw., “Tertius,” and Michaelis, Introd. vol. iv. p. 89, Marsh’s transl.</p>
