<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] The omission of καὶ οὶ before ἀδελφοί , found (see var. read.) in all the first MSS., can (as Neander observes against De Wette) hardly have been occasioned by hierarchical considerations, seeing that it occurs as early as Irenæus, and that it would be equally against the strong hierarchical view to call the presbyters πρεσβ . ἀδελφοί , writing, as they were, to the ἀδελφοῖς . It seems very much more probable to me that the words καὶ οἱ were inserted to bring the decree into exact harmony with the beginning of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span> . In this, the first <em> official</em> mention of πρεσβυτεροι , it is very natural that the import of the term should be thus given by attaching ἀδελφοί to it. See, on the whole, Bp. Wordsw.’s note.

<p><strong> Κιλικίαν</strong> ] This mention of <em> churches in Cilicia</em> , coupled with the fact of Paul’s stay at Tarsus (ch. Act 9:30 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:25">Acts 11:25</span> ; see also Gal 1:21 ), makes it probable that Paul preached the gospel there, <em> and to Gentiles</em> , in accordance with the vision which he had in the temple (ch. Act 22:21 ).

<p><strong> χαίρειν</strong> ] Not a rendering by Luke of the Hebrew שלום , as Grotius; for the Epistle was certainly written in <em> Greek</em> , as intended for Gentiles. The only other place where this Greek form of salutation occurs in an apostolic document (we have it in the letter of the chief captain Lysias, ch. Act 23:26 ) is in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span> , which Bleek has remarked as a coincidence serving to shew his hand in the drawing up of this Epistle.</p>
