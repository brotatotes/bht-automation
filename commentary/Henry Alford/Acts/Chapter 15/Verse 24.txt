 24. ] Neander remarks (Pfl. u. L. p. 223, note) that έξ  ἡμῶν ἐξ . is a presumption in favour of the reading καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί above: for that these men could hardly have gone out from among the Apostles and elders. But such a supposition is not necessary: ἡμῶν implies the church, the ἀδελφοί of whom they were the πρεσβύτεροι , whether καὶ οἱ be inserted or not.

	The words λέγοντες περιτέμνεσθαι κ . τηρεῖν τὸν νόμον , inserted in rec. after ὑμῶν , are  manifestly , in my view, an interpolation, from the desire to specify in what particulars these persons had sought to unsettle the souls of the Gentile brethren. The defence of the clause set up by Meyer and De Wette, that if interpolated it must be from Acts 15:5 , not from Acts 15:1 , and that this is improbable, is best answered by observing that in E, one of the principal authorities for the insertion, the  δεῖ after περιτέμνεσθαι betrays in very fact that the interpolation  was from Acts 15:5 , as also, but in a less degree, does the λέγοντες . The reasons given by Meyer and De W. why the words should have been  omitted , the similarity of ending in ὑ - ΜΩΝ and νό - ΜΟΝ , or to square it with Acts 15:1 , seem to me nugatory. The former is very improbable, and the latter would have required the preservation of λέγ . περιτέμνεσθαι . The  variations also in the clause are strong presumptions against it. The persons to whom the epistle was addressed would very well know  what it was that had disturbed their minds, and the omission of formal mention of it would be natural, to avoid prominent cause of offence to the Jewish converts by an apparent depreciation of circumcision and the observance of the law.
