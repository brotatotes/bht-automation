<b> 24. subverting</b>] The word implies<i> turning up the foundations.</i> The words “<i>saying ye must be circumcised and keep the law</i>,” inserted in the common text, are manifestly, in my view, an interpolation, from the desire to specify in what particulars these persons had sought to unsettle the souls of the Gentile brethren. The persons to whom the epistle was addressed would very well know<i> what</i> it was that had disturbed their minds, and the omission of formal mention of it would be natural, to avoid prominent cause of offence to the Jewish converts by an apparent depreciation of circumcision and the observance of the law.
