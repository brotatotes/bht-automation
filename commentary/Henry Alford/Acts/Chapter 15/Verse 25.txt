<b> 25. Barnabas and Paul</b>] Paul has generally been mentioned<i> first</i>, since ch. xiii. 43. (The exception, ch. xiv. 14, appears to arise from the people calling Barnabas Jupiter, and thus giving him the precedence in ver. 12, after which the next mention of them follows the same order.) But here, as at ver. 12, we have naturally the old order of precedence in the Jerusalem congregation preserved.
