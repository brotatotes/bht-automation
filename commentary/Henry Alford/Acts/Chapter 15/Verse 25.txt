<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] <strong> γεν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁμοθυμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> may mean either ‘ <em> assembled with one accord</em> ,’ as (perhaps) ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:14">Acts 1:14</span> ; or ‘ <em> having agreed with one consent</em> ’ as Meyer. I prefer the former meaning. So we have adverbs as predicates after verbs substantive, e.g., εἶναι διαφερόντως , Plato Legg. x. p. 892 c, κατύπερθε γίνεσθαι , Herod., &amp;c See Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 337.

<p><strong> Βαρν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Παύλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Paul has generally been mentioned first since ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:43">Acts 13:43</span> . (The exception, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:14">Acts 14:14</span> , appears to arise from the people calling Barnabas Jupiter, and thus giving him the precedence in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:12">Acts 15:12</span> , after which the next mention of them follows the same order.) But here, as at <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:12">Acts 15:12</span> , we have naturally the old order of precedence in the Jerusalem congregation preserved.</p>
