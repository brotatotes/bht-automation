<b> 26. men that have delivered up their lives</b>] The sacrifice of their lives was made<i> by them</i>: they were martyrs in will, though their lives had not as yet been laid down in point of fact.—This is mentioned to shew that Paul and Barnabas could have no other motive than that of serving the Lord Jesus Christ, and to awaken trust in the minds of the churches. But, although this was so, the Apostles and Elders did not think proper to send only Paul and Barnabas, who were already so deeply committed by their acts to the same side of the question as the letter which they bore,—but as direct authorities from themselves, Judas and Silas also, who might by word confirm the contents of the Epistle.
