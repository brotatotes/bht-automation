<p><strong> 28. </strong> <strong> τῷ ἁγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> καὶ ἡμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Not = τῷ ἁγ . πν . ἐν ἡμ . (as Olsh.), but as, in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:32">Acts 5:32</span> , the Holy Spirit, given to the Apostles and testifying by His divine power, is <em> coupled with</em> their own human testimony, so here the <em> decision of the Holy Spirit</em> , given them as leaders of the Church, is laid down as the <em> primary and decisive determination</em> on the matter, and <em> their own formal ecclesiastical decision</em> follows, as giving utterance and scope to His will and command. The other interpretation weakens this accuracy of expression, and destroys the propriety of the sentence. Neander, in his last edn. of the Pfl. u. L. (p. 224, note), has given up the rendering of his former ones, ἔδοξεν γὰρ ( τῷ ἁγίῳ πνεύματι ) καὶ ἡμῖν ,’ <em> It seemed good (by the Holy Ghost) to us also</em> ,’ i.e. as well as to Paul and Barnabas. It was plausible, but quite untenable. Such ambiguity, in such a document, would surely be out of the question.
