<b> 34. omitted</b>] On every account it is probable that the words forming this verse in the common text are an interpolation, to account for Silas being found again at Antioch in ver. 40. On this his subsequent presence at Antioch, see note, ver. 40.—We learn from Gal. ii. 10, that<i> a condition</i> was attached to the cordiality with which the Gentile mission of Paul and Barnabas was recognized by the chief Apostles;—that they should<i> remember the poor</i>, i.e. the poor<i> at Jerusalem:</i>—that the wants of the mother church should not be forgotten by those converts, whose Judaical bond to her was thus cast loose. This was an object which Paul was ever most anxious to subserve. See Gal. 1. c. and note.
