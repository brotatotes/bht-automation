<b> 39.</b>] “Paul sought justice, Barnabas courtesy,” Chrysostom: who also remarks on their separate journeys,— “It seems to me that their parting was by agreement, and that they said to one another, ‘Since you will it, and I do not, that we be not at strife, let us divide our courses.’ So that they did this out of a yielding spirit to one another.” Yet it seems as if there were a considerable difference in the<i> character of their setting out</i>. Barnabas appears to have gone with his nephew without any special sympathy or approval; whereas Paul was commended to the grace of God by the assembled church.—We find Mark afterwards received into favour by Paul, see Col. iv. 10; 2 Tim. iv. 11; and in the former of those places it would seem as if he was dependent for his reception on Paul’s special commendation.
