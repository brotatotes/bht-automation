<b> 4.</b>] On their arrival at Jerusalem, there seems to have taken place an official reception of them and their message,<i> in public</i>. There they<i> related</i>—as a most important element for the determination of the question—<i>God’s dealings with them</i> (see on ch. xiv. 27), and recounted the places where churches of believing Gentiles had been founded. This having taken place, a<i> protest</i> was entered on the part of the Pharisee believers—in no way doubting the truth of these conversions, nor in any way disparaging the ministry of Paul and Barnabas,—that it was necessary to circumcise<i> them</i>, i.e.<i> those of whom they had spoken</i>, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.—It may be objected, that this view would not be consistent with Paul’s statement, Gal. ii. 2,<i> I communicated unto them that Gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation</i>. But I cannot see any inconsistency, if the words used in both cases be accurately weighed. To the<i> church and apostles and elders</i>, Paul and Barnabas gave a simple<i> recital</i> of how God had dealt with them among the Gentiles: but Paul did not lay before the whole assembly the<i> Gospel which he preached among the Gentiles</i>, viz. the indifference of the Mosaic law to their salvation (Gal. i. 7–9), for fear of its being hastily disparaged or repudiated, and so his work being hindered: “<i>lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain</i>,” Gal. ii. 2. But, in private interviews with the chief Apostles, James, Peter, and John (Gal. ii. 9), he<i> did unfold the whole freeness of this Gospel</i>, and so effectually, us to prepare the way for their full and public accordance with him at the council.
