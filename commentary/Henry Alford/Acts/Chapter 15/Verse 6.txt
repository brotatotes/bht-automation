<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] <em> The Apostles and elders only</em> are mentioned as having assembled: in which case πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος ( Act 15:12 ) must mean τῶν πρεσβυτέρων , and the decision of Act 15:22 must have been arrived at <em> in a larger assembly</em> . But most probably the deliberation of the Apostles and elders implied the presence of the brethren also, who are intended by πᾶν τὸ πλ ., and there was <em> but one assembly</em> . The objection, <em> that no one place could have held them</em> , is nugatory: the <em> official presence of all</em> is assumed continually in such cases, where the assembly is <em> open to all</em> .
