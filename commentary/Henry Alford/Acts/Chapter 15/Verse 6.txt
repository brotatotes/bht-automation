<b> 6.</b>]<i> The Apostles and elders only</i> are mentioned as having assembled: in which case “<i>all the multitude</i>” (ver. 12) must mean that of the elders, and the decision of ver. 22 must have been arrived at<i> in a</i><i> larger assembl</i> y. But most probably the deliberation of the Apostles and elders implied the presence of the brethren also, who are intended by “<i>all the multitude</i>”—and there was<i> but one assembly</i>. The objection,<i> that no one place could have held them</i>, is nugatory: the<i> official presence of all</i> is assumed continually in such cases, where the assembly is<i> open to all</i>.
