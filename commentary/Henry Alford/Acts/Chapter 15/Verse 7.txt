<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] A promiscuous debate, not perhaps without some angry feeling, ensued on their first coming together, and among the <em> multitude</em> , as is implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:12">Acts 15:12</span> , man disputing with man.
	</p>
<p><strong> Πέτρος</strong> ] Partly on account of the universal deference paid to him, but principally because of his peculiar fitness to open the apostolic decisions on the subject, from having been made the instrument of the <em> first public and approved reception of the Gentiles</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὑμεῖς ἐπίστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] In Peter’s speeches in ch. 10, this phrase occurs at the beginning of a sentence, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:28">Acts 15:28</span> , and ὑμεῖς οἴδατε , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:37">Acts 15:37</span> ; and we have traces of the same way of expressing the personal pronoun in his speeches, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:15">Acts 2:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:14">Acts 3:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:25">Acts 3:25</span> . Such notices are important, as shewing that these reports are not only according to the <em> sense</em> of what was said, but the words spoken, <em> verbatim</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀφ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀρχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] In regard to the whole time of the Gospel up to that day (about 20 years), the date of the conversion of Cornelius, <em> at least fifteen years before</em> this (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span> , and notes to chron. table in Prolegg.), would very properly be so specified. The length of time elapsed is placed by Peter <em> in the strongest light</em> , to shew that the question had in fact been settled by divine interference <em> long since</em> . Notice (in reff.) the idioms, &amp;c., <em> peculiar</em> to Peter: ἐξελέξ . with inf., διὰ τ . στόμ ., καρδιογν . (most probably); or <em> characteristic</em> of him, πειράζ . τ . θεόν , ( καθ ) ὼς καὶ ἡμῖν (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:47">Acts 10:47</span> ; so ὥσπερ καί , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:17">Acts 3:17</span> ; Act 11:15 ), ἀρχαίων <em> now</em> , compared with ἐν ἀρχῇ ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:15">Acts 11:15</span> . Compare also with πειράζ τ . θεόν , κωλῦσαι τ . θεόν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:17">Acts 11:17</span> .

<p><strong> ἐν ὑμῖν</strong> ] <strong> among you. If</strong> ἡμῖν be read, then ‘ <em> among us (Apostles</em> ):’ see var. read.
	</p>
<p>There is no ellipsis of ‘me’ after ἐξελ .: the E. V. expresses the construction rightly.</p>
