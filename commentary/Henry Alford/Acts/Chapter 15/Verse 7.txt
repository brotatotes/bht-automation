 7. ] A promiscuous debate, not perhaps without some angry feeling, ensued on their first coming together, and among the  multitude , as is implied in Acts 15:12 , man disputing with man.
	 Πέτρος ] Partly on account of the universal deference paid to him, but principally because of his peculiar fitness to open the apostolic decisions on the subject, from having been made the instrument of the  first public and approved reception of the Gentiles .
	 ὑμεῖς ἐπίστ  . ] In Peter’s speeches in ch. 10, this phrase occurs at the beginning of a sentence, Acts 15:28 , and ὑμεῖς οἴδατε , Acts 15:37 ; and we have traces of the same way of expressing the personal pronoun in his speeches, ch. Acts 2:15 ; Acts 3:14 ; Acts 3:25 . Such notices are important, as shewing that these reports are not only according to the  sense of what was said, but the words spoken,  verbatim .
	 ἀφ  ʼ   ἡμ  .   ἀρχ  . ] In regard to the whole time of the Gospel up to that day (about 20 years), the date of the conversion of Cornelius,  at least fifteen years before this (cf. Galatians 2:1 , and notes to chron. table in Prolegg.), would very properly be so specified. The length of time elapsed is placed by Peter  in the strongest light , to shew that the question had in fact been settled by divine interference  long since . Notice (in reff.) the idioms, &c.,  peculiar to Peter: ἐξελέξ . with inf., διὰ τ . στόμ ., καρδιογν . (most probably); or  characteristic of him, πειράζ . τ . θεόν , ( καθ ) ὼς καὶ ἡμῖν (ch. Acts 10:47 ; so ὥσπερ καί , ch. Acts 3:17 ; Act 11:15 ), ἀρχαίων  now , compared with ἐν ἀρχῇ ch. Acts 11:15 . Compare also with πειράζ τ . θεόν , κωλῦσαι τ . θεόν , ch. Acts 11:17 .
	 ἐν ὑμῖν ]  among you. If ἡμῖν be read, then ‘  among us (Apostles ):’ see var. read.
	There is no ellipsis of ‘me’ after ἐξελ .: the E. V. expresses the construction rightly.
