God, who saw deeper than the mere fleshly distinction between Jew and Gentile, who knows that the hearts of<i> all</i> are unclean, and that the same all-sufficient sacrifice can cleanse them<i> all</i>, if applied by faith (compare the remarkable parallel, 1 Pet. i. 18â€“22 incl.), put no difference between us and them, but has been pleased to render them spiritually clean.
