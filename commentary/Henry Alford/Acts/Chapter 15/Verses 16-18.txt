<p><strong> 16 18.</strong> ] The citation from Amos is made freely from the LXX: differing widely in the latter part from our present Hebrew text, which see in loc. E. V. In all probability the LXX had another reading before them, substituting perhaps יִדְרִשׁוּ אֹתי for יִירְשׁוּ אֶת־ and אָדָם for אֱדוֹם . The existing Hebrew MSS. contain several minor variations, for which see Kennicott and De Rossi in loc. Of this we may at least be sure, that James, even if (as I believe) he <em> spoke in Greek</em> , and quoted as here given, would not himself (nor would the Pharisees present have allowed it) have quoted any rendering, especially where the stress of his argument lay in it, <em> at variance with the original Hebrew</em> .

<p>The prophecy regards that glorious restitution of the kingdom to (the Son of) David, which should be begun by the incarnation of the Lord, and perfected by His reign over all nations. During the process of this restitution those nations, as the effect of the rebuilding, should seek the Lord, to whomsoever the gospel should be preached. There is here neither assertion nor negation of the national restoration of the <strong> Jews</strong> . Be this as it may (and I firmly believe in the literal accomplishment of all the prophecies respecting them as a nation), it is obvious, on any deep view of prophetic interpretation, that the glorious things which shall have <em> a</em> fulfilment in the literal Israel, must have <em> their complete and more worthy fulfilment</em> in the spiritual theocracy, of which the Son of David is the Head.</p>
