Paul probably travelled by the ordinary road through the ‘Cilician gates,’ a rent or fissure in the mountain-chain of Taurus, extending from north to south through a distance of eighty miles. See various interesting particulars in C. and H. i. p. 301 ff. and notes.
	 ἐκεῖ ] At  Lystra : which, and not Derbe, was in all probability the birth-place of Timotheus: see on ch. Acts 20:4 . This view is confirmed by Acts 16:2 .

His mother was Eunice, his grandmother Lois, both women of well-known piety, 2 Timothy 1:5 . Whether his father was a proselyte of the gate or not, is uncertain: he certainly was  uncircumcised . He would be, besides his personal aptness for the work, singularly fitted to be the coadjutor to Paul, by his  mixed extraction forming a link between Jews and Greeks.
