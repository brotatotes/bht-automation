Paul probably travelled by the ordinary road through the ‘Cilician gates,’ a rent or fissure in the mouutain-chain of Taurus, extending from north to south through a distance of eighty miles.

This view is confirmed by ver. 2.—He had probably been converted by Paul during his former visit, as he calls him his<i> son in the Lord</i>, 1 Cor. iv. 17; 1 Tim. i. 2; 2 Tim. i. 2; perhaps at Antioch in Pisidia, see 2 Tim. iii. 10, 11. His mother was Eunice, his grandmother, Lois,—both women of well-known piety, 2 Tim. i. 5. Whether his father was a proselyte of the gate or not, is uncertain: he certainly was<i> uncircumcised</i>. He would be, besides his personal aptness for the work, singularly fitted to be the coadjutor to Paul, by his<i> mixed extraction</i> forming a link between Jews and Greeks.
