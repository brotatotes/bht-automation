<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] We have Derbe first, as lying nearest to the pass from Cilicia into Lycaonia and Cappadocia. Paul probably travelled by the ordinary road through the ‘Cilician gates,’ a rent or fissure in the mountain-chain of Taurus, extending from north to south through a distance of eighty miles. See various interesting particulars in C. and H. i. p. 301 ff. and notes.

<p><strong> ἐκεῖ</strong> ] At <em> Lystra</em> : which, and not Derbe, was in all probability the birth-place of Timotheus: see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span> .

His mother was Eunice, his grandmother Lois, both women of well-known piety, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span> . Whether his father was a proselyte of the gate or not, is uncertain: he certainly was <em> uncircumcised</em> . He would be, besides his personal aptness for the work, singularly fitted to be the coadjutor to Paul, by his <em> mixed extraction</em> forming a link between Jews and Greeks.</p>
