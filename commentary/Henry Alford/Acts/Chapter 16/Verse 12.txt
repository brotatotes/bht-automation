<b> 12. Philippi</b>] Philippi was built as a military position on the site of the village Krenides, by Philip the Great of Macedon. The plain between the Gangites, on which the town is situate, and the Strymon, was the field of the celebrated battle of Antony and Octavius against Brutus and Cassius: see more below. There is now an insignificant place on its site retaining the name Filiba (or Philippigi?).<br><br><b> the first Macedonian city of the district</b>] It was the first Macedonian city to which Paul and his companions came in that district,—Neapolis properly belonging to Thrace. And this epithet of<b> first</b> would belong to it not only as regarded the journey of Paul and Silas, but as lying<i> furthest eastward</i>, for which reason also the<i> district</i> was called Macedonia<i> prima</i>, though furthest from Rome. The other explanations are, (1) ‘<i>chief city</i>,’ as A.V. But this it was not: Thessalonica being the chief city of the whole province, and Amphipolis of the division (if it then subsisted) of<i> Macedonia prima:</i>— (2)<b> first</b> is taken as a title of honour, as we find in the coins of Pergamus and Smyrna (but not in the case of any city out of Asia Minor): (3) ‘<i>the first city which was a colony.</i>’ But there could be no reason for stating this: whereas there would be every reason to particularize the fact that they tarried and preached in the very first city to which they came,<i> in Macedonia</i>, the territory to which they were sent.<br><br><b> a colony</b>] Philippi was made a<i> colonia</i> by Augustus, as a memorial of his victory over Brutus and Cassius, and as a frontier garrison against Thrace. Its full name on the coins of the city was Colonia Augusta Julia Philippensis. A Roman colony was in fact a portion of Rome itself transplanted to the provinces (Aulus Gellius calls the<i> colonies</i> “little effigies and images of the Roman people”). The colonists consisted of veteran soldiers and freedmen, who went forth, and determined and marked out their situation, with all religious and military ceremonies. The inhabitants of the<i> colonies</i> were<i> Roman citizens</i>, and were still<i> enrolled in one or other of the tribes</i>, and possessed the privilege of voting at Rome. In them the Roman law was strictly observed, and the Latin language was used on their coins and inscriptions. They were governed by their own senate and magistrates (<i>Duumviri</i>, two in number, as the consuls at Rome: see below, ver. 20), and not by the governor of the province. The land on which they stood was tributary, as being provincial, unless liberated from tribute by the special favour of the<i> Italian right</i>, or ownership of the soil. This Philippi possessed, in common with many other coloniæ and favoured provincial towns. The population of such places came in process of time to be of a mixed character: but only the descendants of the original colonists by Roman wives, or women of a people possessing the citizenship, were Roman citizens. Hence new supplies of colonists were often necessary.<br><br><b> in that city,</b>—as distinguished from the suburban place of prayer, to which they afterwards, on the Sabbath, went out of the gate.
