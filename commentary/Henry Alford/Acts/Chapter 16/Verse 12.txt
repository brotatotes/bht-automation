<b> 12. Philippi</b>] Philippi was built as a military position on the site of the village Krenides, by Philip the Great of Macedon. The plain between the Gangites, on which the town is situate, and the Strymon, was the field of the celebrated battle of Antony and Octavius against Brutus and Cassius: see more below. There is now an insignificant place on its site retaining the name Filiba (or Philippigi?).
