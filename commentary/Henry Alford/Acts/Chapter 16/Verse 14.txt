 14.   πορφυρόπωλις ] The guild of dyers ( οἱ βαφεῖς ) at Thyatira have left inscriptions, still existing, shewing the accuracy of our narrative. The celebrity of the purple dyeing of the neighbourhood is as old as Homer: ὡς δ ʼ ὅτε τίς τ ʼ ἐλέφαντα γυνὴ φοίνικι μιήνῃ Μῃονὶς ἠὲ Κάειρα , παρήϊον ἔμμεναι ἵππων , Il. δ . 141. So also Claudian, de Raptu Proserp. i. 270: ‘non sic decus ardet eburnum  Lydia Sidonio quod  fœmina tinxerit ostro’ (Lewin, i. 242). Thyatira was a city of the province of Asia. Thus, although forbidden to preach the word in  Asia , their first convert at Philippi is an  Asiatic . Lydia is a  proper name , not ‘ita dicta a solo natali,’ as Grot.: though its origin may have been that. It was a common female name. See Hor. Od. i. 8; iii. 9.

	 τ  .   λαλουμένοις ] It appears rather to have been a  conversation ( ἐλαλοῦμεν ,  we spoke and not τὸν λόγον ) than a set discourse:  the things which Paul was saying.
