<p><strong> 14. </strong> <strong> πορφυρόπωλις</strong> ] The guild of dyers ( οἱ βαφεῖς ) at Thyatira have left inscriptions, still existing, shewing the accuracy of our narrative. The celebrity of the purple dyeing of the neighbourhood is as old as Homer: ὡς δ ʼ ὅτε τίς τ ʼ ἐλέφαντα γυνὴ φοίνικι μιήνῃ Μῃονὶς ἠὲ Κάειρα , παρήϊον ἔμμεναι ἵππων , Il. δ . 141. So also Claudian, de Raptu Proserp. i. 270: ‘non sic decus ardet eburnum <em> Lydia</em> Sidonio quod <em> fœmina</em> tinxerit ostro’ (Lewin, i. 242). Thyatira was a city of the province of Asia. Thus, although forbidden to preach the word in <em> Asia</em> , their first convert at Philippi is an <em> Asiatic</em> . Lydia is a <em> proper name</em> , not ‘ita dicta a solo natali,’ as Grot.: though its origin may have been that. It was a common female name. See Hor. Od. i. 8; iii. 9.

<p><strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λαλουμένοις</strong> ] It appears rather to have been a <em> conversation</em> ( ἐλαλοῦμεν , <em> we</em> spoke and not τὸν λόγον ) than a set discourse: <strong> the things which Paul was saying.</strong></p>
