<b> 15. she was baptized, and her household</b>] It<i> may be</i> that no inference for infant-baptism is hence deducible. The practice, however, does not rest on<i> inference</i>, but on the<i> continuity and identity of the covenant of grace to Jew and Christian</i>, the<i> sign only</i> of admission being altered. The Apostles,<i> as Jews</i>, would have proposed to administer baptism to the children, and Jewish or proselyte converts would,<i> as matter of course</i>, have acceded to the proposal; and that the practice thus by universal consent, tacitly (because at first unquestioned) pervaded the universal church, can hardly with any reason be doubted. The preposterous views of the modern Baptists would have been received with astonishment and reprobation in the apostolic Church. See note on 1 Cor. vii. 14.
