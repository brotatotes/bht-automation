In ver. 15 is implied their taking up their abode with Lydia:—in this ver., that they<i> habitually resorted</i> to this place of prayer to teach, and that what follows happened on such occasions.—It may be remarked that the A.V. of this passage, ‘<i>as we went to prayer</i>,’ has given rise to a curious abuse of the expression ‘<i>going to prayer</i>,’ in the sense of ‘<i>beginning to pray</i>,’ among the lower classes in England.<br><br><b> possessed with a spirit of divination</b>] On the whole subject of dæmoniacal possession, see note on Matt. viii. 32.

All attempt to explain away such a narrative as this by the subterfuges of rationalism, is more than ever futile. The fact of the<i> spirit leaving</i> the girl, and the masters<i> finding the hope of their gains gone</i>, is<i> fatal</i>: and we may see, notwithstanding all his attempts to account for it psychologically, that Meyer feels it to be so.
