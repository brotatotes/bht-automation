 18.   διαπονηθείς ] Not  mere annoyance is expressed by this word, but rather holy indignation and sorrow at what he saw and heard; the Christian soldier was goaded to the attack, but the mere satisfaction of anger was not the object, any more than the result, of the stroke. It is doubtful here, in mere grammar, whether the dat.  τῷ πνεύματι is to be constructed with ἐπιστρέψας or with εἶπεν . But considering 1) that the  spirit could hardly be the object of a bodily movement on the part of the Apostle, except as represented by the possessed damsel, and 2) that ἐπιστρέφω is never elsewhere found with a dative, but always with a preposition, εἰς or πρός or ἐπί , it is much the best to take τῷ πνεύματι with εἶπεν , and believe it to be thrown forward before its verb for the sake of emphasis.
