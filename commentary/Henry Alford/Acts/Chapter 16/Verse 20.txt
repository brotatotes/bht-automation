 20.   στρατηγοῖς ] The Duumviri of the colony, of whom at Capua Cicero says, ‘cum in cæteris coloniis  Duumviri appellentur, hi se Prætores ( στρατηγούς ) appellari volebant.’ De Leg. Agr. c. 34. ‘Messinenses,’ says Wetstein, ‘etiam nunc (cir. 1750) Prætorem sive Præfectum urbis  Stradigo appellant.’ The name, as a rendering of Prætor, had come from the Greek title of similar magistrates: so Aristotle, Politic. vii. 3, ἐν ταῖς μικραῖς πόλεσι μία περὶ πάντων ( ἀρχή )· καλοῦσι δὲ στρατηγοὺς καὶ πολεμάρχους .
	 Ἰουδ  .   ὑπάρχοντες  .…   Ῥωμ  .   οὖσιν ] The distinction between ὑπάρχων and ὤν seems to be, that the former is used of something which the speaker or narrator wishes to put forward into notice, either as unknown to his reader or hearer, or in some way to be marked by him for praise or blame: whereas the latter refers to facts known and recognized, and taken for granted by both. Thus, we may notice that, when the fact of  Paul and Silas being Romans is announced to the jailor, it is not ἀνθ . Ῥωμαίους  ὄντας , but  ὑπάρχοντας ; whereas here, both parties, the speakers and the addressed, being indisputably Romans, we have Ῥωμαίοις  οὖσιν . The account of this may be, that ὑπάρχω is predicated of something of which the speaker informs the hearer, some  prior knowledge which he possessed and now imparts, εἰμί being predicated of the bare matter of fact. See ch. Acts 17:27 ; Acts 17:29 ; Acts 21:20 (for both); Acts 22:3 ; Gal 2:14 al., for ὑπάρχων : and for ὤν , John 3:4 ; Joh 4:9 bis; Rom 5:10 al.
	‘Versute composita fait hæc criminatio ad gravandos Christi servos: nam ab una parte obtendunt Romanum nomen, quo nihil erat magis favorabile; rursum ex nomine Judaico, quod tunc infame erat (especially if the decree of Claudius, expelling them from Rome, ch. Acts 18:2 , had at this time been enacted) conflant illis invidiam: nam, quantum ad religionem, plus habebant Romani affinitatis cum aliis quibuslibet, quam cum gente Judaica.’ Calvin.
