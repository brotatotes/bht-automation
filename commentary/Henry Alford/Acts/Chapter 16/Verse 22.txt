Acts 19:28 ; Acts 19:34 ; Acts 21:30 ; Act 22:22-23 ), and the duumviri, without giving them a trial ( ἀκατακρίτους , Act 16:37 ), rent off their clothes, scil. by the lictors ( τοῖς ῥαβδούχοις ἐκέλευσαν τὴν ἐσθῆτά τε περικαταῤῥῆξαι καὶ ταῖς ῥάβδοις τὸ σῶμα ξαίνειν , Dion [80] . Hal. ix. 39). The form was, ‘Summove, lictor, despolia, verbera,’ Seneca (C. and H. i. 357). See also Livy, ii. 8; Valer. Max [81] ii. 28, in Wetst. Erasmus fancied that the duumviri rent  their own clothes from indignation: but, to say nothing of the improbability of such a proceeding on the part of a Roman magistrate, a man could not very well  περι ῤῥῆξαι his own garments
