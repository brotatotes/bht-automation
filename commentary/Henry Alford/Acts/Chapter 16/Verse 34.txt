<p><strong> 34.</strong> ] ἀνα <strong> γ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , see reff. and note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:30">Acts 16:30</span> .

<p><strong> πεπιστευκώς</strong> ] Winer renders ‘as one who has placed his trust in God:’ but, as De W. observes, πεπιστευκώς must give the <em> ground</em> of his rejoicing (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:18">1 Corinthians 14:18</span> (rec.), εὐχαριστῶ … λαλῶν , ‘I give thanks … that I speak’). Thus the meaning will be, <strong> rejoiced that he with all his house had been led to believe</strong> (and thus as a necessary consequence to believe <em> in</em> ) <strong> God</strong> .
	</p>
<p>The expression πεπιστ . <strong> τῷ θεῷ</strong> could only be used of a converted <em> heathen</em> , not of a <em> Jew</em> : in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:8">Acts 18:8</span> , of a Jew, we have ἐπίστευσεν τῷ κυρίῳ .</p>
