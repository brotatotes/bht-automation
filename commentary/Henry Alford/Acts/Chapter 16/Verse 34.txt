 34. ] ἀνα  γ  . , see reff. and note on Acts 16:30 .
	 πεπιστευκώς ] Winer renders ‘as one who has placed his trust in God:’ but, as De W. observes, πεπιστευκώς must give the  ground of his rejoicing (see 1 Corinthians 14:18 (rec.), εὐχαριστῶ … λαλῶν , ‘I give thanks … that I speak’). Thus the meaning will be,  rejoiced that he with all his house had been led to believe (and thus as a necessary consequence to believe  in )  God .
	The expression πεπιστ .  τῷ θεῷ could only be used of a converted  heathen , not of a  Jew : in ch. Acts 18:8 , of a Jew, we have ἐπίστευσεν τῷ κυρίῳ .
