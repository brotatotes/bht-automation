<p><strong> 37.</strong> ] <strong> δημοσίᾳ</strong> and <strong> λάθρα</strong> are opposed: the <em> injury</em> had been <em> public</em> : the <em> reparation</em> , not to Paul and Silas merely, but to the Gospel of which they were the heralds, must be <em> public also</em> .

<p><strong> ἀνθρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ῥωμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑπάρχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] By the Lex Valeria, passed A.U.C. 254, and the Lex Porcia, A.U.C. 506, Roman citizens were exempted from stripes and torture: by the former, till an appeal to the people was decided, by the latter, absolutely. The following passages of Cicero illustrate our text: ‘Porcia lex virgas ab omnium civium Romanorum corpore amovit.’ Pro Rabirio, c. 3. ‘Cædebatur virgis in medio foro Messanæ civis Romanus, judices: cum interea nullus gemitus, nulla vox alia istius miseri, inter dolorem crepitumque virgarum audiebatur, nisi hæc: Civis Romanus sum.’ In Verrem, lib. v. 62, 63. ‘Facinus est vinciri civem Romanum; scelus verberari; prope parricidium, necari.’ Ibid. 66. Many others are given by Kuinoel, Biscoe, &amp;c.

<p>On the question, <em> how Paul came to be born a Roman citizen</em> , see note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:28">Acts 22:28</span> ; and on ὑπάρχ ., note, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:20">Acts 16:20</span> .
	</p>
<p>Another irregularity had been committed by the duumviri, in scourging them <em> uncondemned</em> : ‘causa cognita multi possunt absolvi: incognita quidem condemnari nemo potest.’ Cic. in Verr. i. 9. ‘Inauditi et indefensi tanquam innocenter perierant.’ Tac. Hist. ii. 10.

<p><strong> ἑκβάλλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> are they thrusting us out?</strong> It does not follow, because ἐκβάλλω has no such sense in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:40">Acts 9:40</span> , &amp;c., that therefore it has not here. The circumstances must determine; which here seem to require this sense: the <strong> ἐκβάλλειν λάθρα</strong> having a tinge of degradation in it, as if said of casting out that of which one is ashamed.

<p><strong> οὐ γάρ</strong> ] An elliptical answer to a question or position, the negative of which is self-evident: see Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. p. 48: Kühner, Gramm. § 741. 6: Hermann on Viger, p. 462. When it occurs with ἀλλά , it is best written without a stop between: cf. Aristoph. Ran. 58: μὴ σκῶπτέ μ ʼ, ὦ ʼ δέλφ ʼ· οὐ γὰρ ἀλλ ʼ ἔχω κακῶς : ib. 193: μὰ τὸν Δί ʼ οὐ γὰρ (scil. νεναυμάχηκα ) ἀλλ ʼ ἔτυχον ὀφθαλμιῶν , and 499, φέρε δὴ ταχέως αὔτ ʼ· οὐ γὰρ ἀλλὰ πειστέον .

<p>Mr. Humphry remarks, ‘St. Paul submitted to be scourged by his own countrymen (five times, 2Co 11:24 ): for, though he might have pleaded his privilege as a Roman, to the Jews he “became as a Jew,” observing their ceremonies, and submitting to their law.’</p>
