<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] Here (or rather perhaps at ἐξῆλθον , in the preceding verse) we have the first person again dropped, implying apparently that the narrator did not accompany Paul and Silas. I should be inclined to think that Timotheus <em> went with them</em> from Philippi, not, as is usually supposed, joined them at Berœa: see below on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:10">Acts 17:10</span> .

<p><strong> διοδεύσαντες</strong> ] The ὁδός , on which they travelled from Philippi to Thessalonica, was the Via Egnatia, the Macedoman continuation of the Via Appia, and so named from Egnatia (‘Gnatia lymphis iratis exstructa,’ Hor. Sat. i. 5), in the neighbourhood of which the latter meets the Adriatic. It extended from Dyrrha chium in Epirus to the Hebrus in Thrace, a distance of 500 miles. The stages here mentioned are thus particularized in the itineraries: Philippi to Amphipolis, 33 miles: Amphipolis to Apollonia, 30 miles: Apollonia to Thessalonica, 37 miles. See more particulars in C. and H., i. pp. 368 ff.

<p><strong> Ἀμφίπολιν</strong> ] Anciently called ἐννέα ὁδοί , Thucyd. i. 100. Herod. vii. 114, lying in a most important position, at the end of the lake Cercinitis, formed by the Strymon, commanding the only easy pass from the coast of the Strymonic gulf into Macedonia. (‘Amphipoleos, quæ objecta claudit omnes ab oriente sole in Macedoniam aditus,’ Liv. xlv. 30.) In consequence of this, the Athenians colonized the place, calling it Amphipolis, ἐπ ʼ ἀμφότερα περιῤῥέοντος τοῦ Στρυμόνος , Thuc. iv. 102. It was the spot where Brasidas was killed, and for previously failing to succour which Thucydides was exiled: see Thucyd. iv. and v., and Grote’s Hist. of Greece, vol. vi. p. 625 ff., where there is a plan of Amphipolis. After this it was a point of contention between the Athenians and Philip, and subsequently became the capital of Macedonia Prima, see Livy, xlv. 30, where Paulus Æmilius proclaims, at Amphipolis, the freedom and territorial arrangements of Macedonia. It is now called Emboli.

<p><strong> Ἀπολλωνίαν</strong> ] Its situation is unknown, but was evidently (see the distances above given) inland, not quite half-way from Amphipolis to Thessalonica, where the road crosses from the Strymonic to the Thermaic gulf. Leake saw some ruins at about the right spot, but did not visit them: and Cousinéry mentions seeing, on an opposite hill, the village of Polina. Pliny mentions it (N. H. iv. 10), ‘regio Mygdoniæ subjacens, in qua recedentes a mare Apollonia, Arethusa.’ It must not be confounded with a better known Apollonia near Dyrrhachium, on the western coast, also on the Via Egnatia. See C. and H. i. pp. 376 f.

<p><strong> θεσσαλονίκην</strong> ] At this time the capital of the province Macedonia, and the residence of the proconsul (Macedonia had been an <em> imperial</em> , but was now a <em> senatorial province</em> ). Its former names were Emathia, Halia, and Therma: it received its name of Thessalonica from Cassander, on his rebuilding and embellishing it, in honour of his wife Thessalonica, sister of Alexander the Great. So Strabo, lib. vii. excerpt. 10: who, ib. excerpt. 3, calls it Θεσσαλονικεία . It was made a <em> free city</em> after the battle of Philippi: and every thing in this narrative is consistent with the privileges and state of an <em> urbs libera</em> . We read of its δῆμος <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:5">Acts 17:5</span> , and its πολιτάρχαι <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span> ; not, as at the Roman colony of Philippi, of ῥαβδοῦχοι (lictors), and στρατηγοί (duumviri), ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:20">Acts 16:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:35">Acts 16:35</span> . It has ever been an important and populous city, and still continues such (pop. 70,000), being the second city in European Turkey, under the slightly corrupted name of Saloniki. For a notice of the church there, see Prolegg. to first Ep. to the Thessalonians, § ii.

<p>[ <strong> ἡ</strong> ] <strong> συναγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The article is in all probability genuine: implying that there was no other synagogue for the towns lately traversed: and shewing the same minute acquaintance with the peculiarities of this district as our narrative has shewn since the arrival at Neapolis.</p>
