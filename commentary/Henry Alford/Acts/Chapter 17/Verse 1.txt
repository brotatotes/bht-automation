<b> CHAP. XVII. 1.</b>] Here (or rather perhaps at “<i>they exhorted them and departed</i>,” in the preceding verse) we have the first person again dropped,—implying apparently that the narrator did not accompany Paul and Silas. I should be inclined to think that Timotheus<i> went with them</i> from Philippi,—not, as is usually supposed, joined them at Berœa: see below on ver. 10.<br><br><b> when they had passed through</b>] The road, on which they travelled from Philippi to Thessalonica, was the Via Egnatia, the Macedonian continuation of the Via Appia, and so named from Egnatia, in the neighbourhood of which the latter meets the Adriatic. It extended from Dyrrhachium in Epirus to the Hebrus in Thrace, a distance of 500 miles. The stages here mentioned are thus particularized in the itineraries; Philippi to Amphipolis, 33 miles: Amphipolis to Apollonia, 30 miles: Apollonia to Thessalonica, 37 miles. See more particulars in Conybeare and Howson, i. pp. 368 ff.<br><br><b> Amphipolis</b>] Anciently called Nine Ways, lying in a most important position, at the end of the lake Cercinitis, formed by the Strymon, commanding the only easy pass from the coast of the Strymonic gulf into Macedonia. In consequence of this, the Athenians colonized the place, calling it Amphipolis. It was the spot where Brasidas was killed, and for previously failing to succor which, Thucydides was exiled: see Grote’s Hist. of Greece, vol. vi. p. 625 ff., where there is a plan of Amphipolis. After this it was a point of contention between the Athenians and Philip, and subsequently became the capital of Macedonia Prima.—It is now called Emboli.<br><br><b> Apollonia</b>] Its situation is unknown, but was evidently (see the distances above given) inland, not quite half-way from Amphipolis to Thessalonica, where the road crosses from the Strymonic to the Thermaic gulf. Leake saw some ruins at about the right spot, but did not visit them: and Cousinéry mentions seeing, on an opposite bill, the village of Polina. It must not be confounded with a better known Apollonia near Dyrrhachium, on the western coast, also on the Via Egnatia. See Conybeare and Howson, i. pp. 376 f.<br><br><b> Thessalonica</b>] At this time the capital of the province Macedonia, and the residence of the proconsul (Macedonia had been an<i> imperial</i>, but was now a<i> senatorial province</i>). Its former names were Emathia, Halia, and Therma: it received its name of Thessalonica, from Cassander, on his rebuilding and embellishing it, in honour of his wife Thessaloniea, sister of Alexander the Great. It was made a<i> free city</i> after the battle of Philippi: and every thing in this narrative is consistent with its privileges and state as such. See in my Greek Test. It has ever been an important and populous city, and still continues such (the present population is 70, 000), being the second city in European Turkey, under the slightly corrupted name of Saloniki. For a notice of the church there, see Introduction to the first Ep. to the Thessalonians,§2.<br><br><b> the synagogue of the Jews</b>] The article implies that there was no other synagogue for the towns lately traversed: and shews the same minute acquaintance with the peculiarities of this district as our narrative has shewn since the arrival at Neapolis.
