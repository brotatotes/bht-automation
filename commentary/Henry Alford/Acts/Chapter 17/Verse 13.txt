<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] <strong> οἱ ἀπὸ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , as E. V., <strong> of Thessalonica</strong> . No inference that they came <em> from</em> Thess. can be drawn from this expression: but it is asserted below. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:24">Hebrews 13:24</span> .

<p><strong> ἦλθον κἀκεῖ σαλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Not, as E. V., ‘ <em> they came thither also, and stirred up</em> .…,’ which destroys the force of the sentence: but <strong> they came, and stirred up there also</strong> .…: no <em> journey</em> having been related of them <em> before</em> , but a precisely similar act of exciting the people. From the distance, some time must have elapsed before this could take place: and that some time <em> did</em> elapse, we may gather from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:18">1 Thessalonians 2:18</span> , where Paul relates that he made several attempts to revisit the Thessalonians (which could be only during his stay at Berœa, as he left the neighbourhood altogether when he left that town), but was hindered.</p>
