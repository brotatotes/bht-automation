<b> 15.</b>]<i> Who</i><b> they that conducted Paul</b><i> were</i> is not said.—The course of<i> Timotheus</i> appears to have been, as far as we can follow it from the slight notices given, as follows:—when Paul departed from Berœa, not having been able to revisit Thessalonica as he wished (1 Thess. ii. 18), he sent Timotheus (from Berœa, not from Athens) to exhort and confirm the Thessalonians, and determined to be left at Athens<i> alone</i> (1 Thess. iii. 1), Silas meanwhile remaining to carry on the work at Berœa. Paul, on his arrival at Athens, sends (by his conductors, who returned) this message to both, to come to him as soon as possible. They did so, and found him (ch. xviii. 5) at Corinth.
