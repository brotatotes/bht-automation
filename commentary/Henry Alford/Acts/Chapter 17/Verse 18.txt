<b> 18. Epicurean</b>] The Epicurean philosophy was antagonistic to the gospel, as holding the atomic theory in opposition to the creation of matter,—the disconnexion of the Divinity from the world and its affairs, in opposition to the idea of a ruling Providence,—and the indissoluble union, and annihilation together, of soul and body, as opposed to the hope of eternal life, and indeed to all spiritual religion whatever. The Epicureans were the materialists of the ancient world.—The common idea attached to Epicureanism must be discarded in our estimate of the persons mentioned in our text. The “<b>chief good</b>” of the real Epicureans, far from being a degraded and sensual pleasure, was<i> imperturbability</i> of mind, based upon<i> wisdom</i>—perhaps the best estimate of the highest good formed in the heathen world;—and their ethics were exceedingly strict. But the abuse to which such a doctrine was evidently liable, gave rise to a pseudo-Epicureanism, which has generally passed current for the real, and which amply illustrated the truth, that corruption of that which is best, is itself worst. For their chimerical<i> imperturbability</i>, Paul offered them<i> the peace which passeth all understanding</i>, Phil. iv. 7.<br><br><b> Stoick</b>] So named from the<i> Stoa</i>, or porch (see above),—founded by Zeno of Cittium in the fourth century B.C., but perhaps more properly by Cleanthes and Chrysippus in the third century B.C. Their philosophy, while it approached the truth in holding one supreme Governor of all, compromised it, in allowing of any and all ways of conceiving and worshipping Him (see below, vv. 24, 25),—and contravened it, in its pantheistic belief that all souls were emanations of Him. In<i> spirit</i> it was directly opposed to the gospel,—holding the independence of man on any being but himself, together with the subjection of God and man alike to the stern laws of an inevitable fate. On the existence of the soul after death their ideas were various: some holding that all souls endure to the conflagration of all things,—others confining this to the souls of good men,—and others believing all souls to be reabsorbed into the Divinity. By these tenets they would obviously be placed in antagonism to the doctrines of a Saviour of the world and the resurrection,—and to placing the summum bonum of man in abundance of that grace which<i> is made perfect in weakness</i>, 2 Cor. xii. 9.<br><br><b> some said... other some</b>] These are not to be taken as belonging the one to the Epicureans, the other to the Stoics,—but rather as describing two classes, common perhaps to both schools,—the one of which despised him and his sayings, and the other were disposed to take a more serious view of the matter, and charge him with bringing in new deities.<br><br><b> this babbler</b>] The word in the original signifies a kind of bird which picks up and devours seeds: whence the Athenians called by this name those who went about picking up trifles in converse and making it their business to retail them: in fact, the name imports<i> one who talks fluently to no purpose</i>, and hints also that his talk is<i> not his own</i>.<br><br><b> a setter forth of strange gods</b>] “<i>Socrates is guilty of bringing in new gods</i>,” was one of the charges on which Athens put to death her wisest son. The<i> strange gods</i> which they charged Paul with setting forth were,<i> the true God</i>, the God of the Jews, and<i> Jesus Christ</i> His Son: the Creator of the world (ver. 24), and the Man whom He hath appointed to judge it, ver. 31. Compare ver. 23, end: which is an express answer to this charge.
