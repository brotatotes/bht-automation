<b> 19. they took him</b>] No violence is implied.<br><br><b> to the hill of Mars</b>] There is no allusion here to the<i> court</i> of Areopagus, nor should the words have been so rendered in A.V.,—especially as the same expression below (ver. 22) is translated<i> ‘Mars’</i><i> hill</i>.’ We have in the narrative<i> no trace of any judicial proceeding</i>, but every thing to contradict such a supposition. Paul merely makes his speech, and, having satisfied the curiosity of the multitude who came together on Mars’ Hill, departs unhindered:—<b>they brought him up to the hill of Mars.</b> The following note is borrowed from Mr Humphry’s Commentary:— ‘It might be expected that on the hill of Mars the mind of the stranger would be impressed with the magnificence of the religion which he sought to overthrow. The temple of the Eumenides was immediately below him: opposite, at the distance of 200 yards, was the Acropolis, which, being entirely occupied with statues and temples, was, to use the phrase of an ancient writer, as one great offering to the gods. The Persians encamped on the Areopagus when they besieged the Acropolis (Herod. viii. 52): from the same place the Apostle makes his first public attack on Paganism, of which the Acropolis was the stronghold. Xerxes in his fanaticism burnt the temples of Greece. Christianity advanced more meekly and surely: and though the immediate effect of the Apostle’s sermon was not great, the Parthenon in time became a Christian church. Athens ceased to be a city<b> wholly given to idolatry</b>,—and the repugnance of the Greeks to images became so great, as to be a principal cause of the schism between the churches of the east and west in the eighth century.’—The hill of Mars was on tho west of the Acropolis. The Areopagus, the highest criminal court of Athens, held its sittings there. To give any account of it is beside the purpose, there being no allusion to it in the text. Full particulars may be found under the word<i> Areopagus</i> in Smith’s Dictionary of Gr. and Rom. Antiquities.<br><br><b> May we know</b>] A courteous method of address (not ironical).
