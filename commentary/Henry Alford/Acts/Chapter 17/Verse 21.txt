 21. ] A remark of the narrator (as I believe,  Paul himself , see Prolegg. to Acts, § ii. 14) as a comment on the καινή and ξενίζοντα of the verse before.
	 εὐκαιρῶ ,  vaco , Gloss. Vet. It is not a classic Attic word: εὐκαιρεῖν οὐδεὶς εἴρηκε τῶν παλαιῶν , Ἕλληνες δέ , Mœris. “ σχολὴν ἄγω ,” καὶ “ εὖ σχολῆς ἔχω ,” οὐ “ σχολάζω ·” τὸ δὲ “ εὐκαιρεῖν ” πάντη ἀδόκιμον , Thom. Mag.
	On this character of the Athenians, compare that given of them, Thucyd. iii. 38, μετὰ καινότητος μὲν λόγου ἀπατᾶσθαι ἄριστοι , where the scholiast evidently has our text in his mind; ταῦτα πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους αἰνίττεται , οὐδέν τι μελετῶντας πλὴν λέγειν τι καὶ ἀκούειν καινόν : Demosth. (Philippic. i. p. 43), ἢ βούλεσθε , εἰπέ μοι , περϊιόντες αὑτῶν πυθέσθαι κατὰ τὴν ἀγορὰν Λέγεταί τι καινόν ; γένοιτο γὰρ ἄν τι καινότερον ἢ Μακεδὼν ἀνὴρ κ . τ . λ . (so also in Philipp. Epist. pp. 156, 157.) The comparative, καινότερον , is used as here by Theophr. in giving the character of a loquacious person: οἷος ἐρωτῆσαι Ἔχεις περὶ τοῦδε εἰπεῖν καινόν ; καὶ ἐπιβαλὼν ἐρωτᾷν Μὴ λέγεταί τι καινότερον ; It implies, as we should say,  the very last news.
