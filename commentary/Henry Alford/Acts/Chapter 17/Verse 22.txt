<b> 22.</b>] The commentators vie with each other in admiration of this truly wonderful speech of the great Apostle. Chrysostom says: “This is what the Apostle elsewhere says, that he became to those not under the law as not under the law, that he might win those not under the law. For when addressing the Athenians, he grounds his argument not on the law or the prophets, but begins his persuasion from one of their altars, conquering them by their own maxims.” ‘The oration of Paul before this assembly is a living proof of his apostolic wisdom and eloquence: we see here how he, according to his own words, could become a Gentile to the Gentiles, to win the Gentiles to the Gospel.’ Neander. And Stier very properly remarks, ‘It was given to the Apostle in this hour, what he should speak; this is plainly to be seen in the following discourse, which we might weary ourselves with praising and admiring in various ways; but far better than all so-called praise from our poor tongues is the humble recognition, that the Holy Ghost, the spirit of Jesus, has here spoken by the Apostle, and therefore it is that we have in his discourse a masterpiece of apostolic wisdom.’ The same commentator gives the substance of the speech thus: ‘<i>He who is</i> (by your own involuntary confession)<i> unknown to you Athenians</i> (religious though you are),—<i>and yet</i> (again, by your own confession)<i> able to be known,</i>—<i>the all-sufficing Creator of the world, Preserver of all creatures, and Governor of mankind,—now commandeth all men</i> (by me His minister)<i> to repent, that they may know Him, and to believe in the Man whom He hath raised from the dead, that they may stand in the judgment, which He</i><i> hath committed to Him</i>.’<br><br><b> Ye men of Athens</b>] The regular and dignified appellation familiar to them as used by all their orators,—of whose works Paul could hardly be altogether ignorant.<br><br><b> very religious</b>]<b> Carrying your religious reverence very far:</b> an instance of which follows, in that they, not content with worshipping<i> named</i> and<i> known</i> gods, worshipped even an<i> unknown</i> one.<i> Blame</i> is neither expressed, nor even implied: but their<i> exceeding veneration</i> for religion laid hold of as a<i> fact</i>, on which Paul, with exquisite skill, engrafts his proof that he is introducing<i> no new</i> gods, but enlightening them with regard to an object of worship on which they were confessedly in the dark. So Chrysostom, “That is,<b> very pious:</b>... he says it as praising them, and not with any spirit of blame.” To understand this word as A.V., ‘<i>too superstitious</i>,’ is to miss the fine and delicate tact of the speech, by which he at once parries the charge against him, and in doing so introduces the great Truth which he came to preach.—The character thus given of the Athenians is confirmed by Greek writers. Pausanias says, “The Athenians are conspicuous above other people in their zeal in divine matters.” Josephus calls them “the most devout of the Greeks.”
