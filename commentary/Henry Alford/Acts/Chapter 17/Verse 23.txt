<p>That this was the veritable inscription on the altars (not as Jerome on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:12">Titus 1:12</span> , vol. vii. p. 707, ‘Inscriptio aræ non ita erat ut Paulus asseruit: <em> ignoto Deo</em> : sed ita: Diis Asiæ et Europæ et Africæ, Diis ignotis et peregrinis. Verum quia Paulus non pluribus Diis ignotis indigebat sed uno tantum ignoto Deo, singulari verbo usus est’), the words ᾧ ἐπεγέγραπτο , <strong> on which had been inscribed</strong> , are decisive. Meyer well remarks, that the historical fact would be abundantly established from this passage, being Paul’s testimony of what he <em> himself had seen</em> , and spoken <em> to</em> the Athenian people. But we have our narrative confirmed by the following: Paus. i. 1. 4, ἐνταῦθαι καὶ βωμοὶ θεῶν τε ὀνομαζομένων ἀγνώστων , καὶ ἡρώων καὶ παίδων τῶν Θήσεως καὶ Φαλήρου : Philostratus, Vita Apollon. vi. 3, σωφρονέστερον τὸ περὶ πάντων θεῶν εὖ λέγειν , καὶ ταῦτα Ἀθήνῃσιν , οὗ καὶ ἀγνώστων δαιμόνων βωμοὶ ἵδρυνται . On which Winer well says, that it by no means follows that each altar had the inscription in the plural, θεοῖς ἀγνώστοις , but more naturally that the plural has been used to suit βωμοί , and that the inscription on each was as here. The commonly cited passage of (Pseudo-) Lucian, Philopatr. 9, and 29, νὴ τὸν ἄγνωστον ἐν Ἀθήναις , is no testimony, the dialogue being spurious, and the reference to our text evident. The origin of such altars has been variously explained: Diog. Laert. (vita Epimenid.) says, that Epimenides, on occasion of a plague, advised the Athenians to let go white and black sheep from the Areiopagus, and on the spots where they lay down to erect altars <strong> τῷ προσήκοντι θεῷ</strong> <strong> :</strong> ὅθεν , he adds, ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐστιν εὑρεῖν κατὰ τοὺς δήμους τῶν Ἀθηναίων βωμοὺς ἀνωνύμους . Eichhorn conjectures that they may have been ancient altars erected before the use of writing, and thus inscribed in after-times. But I should rather suppose that the above anecdote furnishes the key to the practice: that on the occurrence of any remarkable calamity or deliverance not assignable to the conventionally-received agency of any of the recognized deities, <em> an unknown God</em> was reverenced as their author. That the <em> God of the Jews</em> was meant (as supposed by Calov., Wolf, al.) is very improbable.

<p>‘Quod ignotis Diis altare erexerant, signum erat nihil ipsos tenere certi: habebant quidem ingentem Deorum turbam … sed dum illis permiscent ignotos Deos, hoc ipso fatentur nihil de vera Divinitate se habere compertum … Inde apparet inquietudo, quod se nondum defunctos fatentur, ubi popularibus Diis litarunt,’ &amp;c. Calvin.

<p><strong> ὃ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> τοῦτο</strong> ] The ὅν and τοῦτον of the rec. have probably been alterations from reverential motives. The neuters give surely the deeper, and the more appropriate sense. For Paul does not <em> identify</em> the true God with the dedication of, or worship at, the altar mentioned: but speaks of <em> the Divinity</em> ( τὸ θεῖον ) of whom they, by this inscription, confessed themselves ignorant. (It may however be a warning of the uncertainty of <em> à priori</em> internal evidence for readings, that De Wette and Meyer suppose the masculines to have been altered <em> to produce this very sense</em> , and <em> to avoid the inference that Paul identified the unknown God with the Creator</em> .) But even a more serious objection lies against the masculines. The sentiment would thus be in direct contradiction to the assertion of Paul himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span> , ἃ θύουσιν , <strong> δαιμονίοις καὶ οὐ θεῷ θύουσιν</strong> . Compare also our Lord’s words, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:22">John 4:22</span> , ὑμεῖς προσκυνεῖτε ὃ οὐκ οἴδατε .
	</p>
<p>In <strong> εὐσεβεῖτε</strong> , we have another confirmation of the sense above insisted on for δεισιδαιμονεστέρους . He wishes to commend their reverential spirit, while he shews its misdirection. An important lesson for all who have controversies with Paganism and Romanism.
