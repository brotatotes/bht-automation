<b> 23. your objects of worship</b>] Not, as A.V., ‘<i>your devotions:</i>’ but even temples, altars, statues, &c.<br><br><b> also an altar</b>] Over and above the many altars to your own and foreign deities.<br><br><b> To an</b> (not,<i> the</i>)<b> unknown God</b>] That this was the veritable inscription on the altars, the words<b> with this inscription</b> (literally,<b> on which had been inscribed</b>) are decisive. Meyer well remarks, that the historical fact would be abundantly established from this passage, being Paul’s testimony of what he<i> himself had seen</i>,—and spoken to the Athenian people. But we have our narrative confirmed by other testimonies which I have cited in my Greek Test., shewing that there really were altars with this inscription at Athens.<br><br><b> What ye ignorantly worship, that declare I unto you]</b> The change to “<i>Whom</i>” and “<i>Him</i>” has probably been made from reverential motives. The neuters give surely the deeper, and the more appropriate sense. For Paul does not<i> identify</i> the true God with the dedication of, or worship at, the altar mentioned: but speaks of<i> the Divinity</i> of whom they, by this inscription, confessed themselves ignorant. But even a more serious objection lies against the masculines. The sentiment would thus be in direct contradiction to the assertion of Paul himself, 1 Cor. x. 20, “<i>The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God</i>.” Compare also our Lord’s words, John iv. 22, “<i>Ye worship that which ye know not</i>.”—In the word<b> worship</b> (<b>shew piety towards</b>) we have another confirmation of the sense above insisted on in ver. 22. He wishes to commend their<i> reverential</i> spirit, while he shews its misdirection. An important lesson for all who have controversies with Paganism and Romanism.
