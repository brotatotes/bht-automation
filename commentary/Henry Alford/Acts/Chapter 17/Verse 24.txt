<b> 24.</b>] ‘No wonder, that the devil, in order to diffuse idolatry, has blotted out among all heathen nations the recognition of<i> Creation</i>. The true doctrine of Creation is the proper refutation of all idolatry.’ Roos, cited by Stier, who remarks, ‘Only on the firm foundation of the Old Testament doctrine of Creation can we rightly build the New Testament doctrine of Redemption, and only he, who scripturally believes and apprehends by faith the earliest words of Revelation, concerning a Creator of all things, can also apprehend, know, and scripturally worship, THE MAN, in whom God’s word, down to its latest canonical Revelation, gathers together all things.’
