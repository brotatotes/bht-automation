<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] <strong> ἐξ ἑνὸς</strong> <strong> [</strong> <strong> αἵμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] was said, be it remembered, to a people who gave themselves out for αὐτόχθονες : but we must not imagine that to refute this was the <em> object</em> of the words: they aim far higher than this, and controvert the whole genius of polytheism, which attributed to the various nations <em> differing mythical origins</em> , and <em> separate guardian gods</em> . It is remarkable, that though of all people the Jews were the most distinguished in their covenant state from other nations of the earth, yet to them only was given the revelation of the true history of mankind, as all created of <em> one blood</em> : a doctrine kept as it were in store for the gospel to proclaim.

<p>Not, ‘hath made of one blood,’ &amp;c., as E. V., but <strong> caused every nation of men (sprung) of one [blood] to dwell</strong> , &amp;c. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:37">Mark 7:37</span> .

<p><strong> παντὸς προσώπου</strong> ] The omission of the art. may be accounted for by the words following ἐπί (see Middleton, vi. 1): or, perhaps, by the parallelism of πᾶν ἔθνος , παντὸς προσώπου : or perhaps, as πὰς οἶκος Ἰσραήλ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span> , because πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς is regarded as one appellative. See note on πᾶσα οἰκοδομή , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span> .

<p><strong> καιρ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> ὁροθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] He who was before ( Act 17:24 ) the <em> Creator</em> , then ( Act 17:25 ) the <em> Preserver</em> , is now the <em> Governor</em> of all men: prescribing to each nation its space to dwell in, and its time of endurance.
