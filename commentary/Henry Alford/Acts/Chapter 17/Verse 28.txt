<b> 28.</b>] There is no justification for<i> the pantheist</i> in this.—It is properly said only of the race of men, as being His offspring, bound to Him: proceeding from, and upheld by, and therefore living, moving, and being in Him:—but even in a wider sense<i> His Being</i>, though a separate objective Personality, involves and contains that of His creatures. See Eph. i. 10, where the same is said of Christ.<br><br><b> we live, and move, and have our being</b>] ‘A climax rising higher with each term,<i> out of</i> God we should have no<i> Life</i>, nor even<i> movement</i> (which some things without life have, plants, water, &c.), nay, not any<i> existence</i> at all (we should not have<i> been</i>),’ the intent being to shew the<i> absolute dependence for every thing</i> of man on God,—and thence the<i> absurdity of supposing the Godhead</i><i> like to the works of his</i> (man’s)<i> hands</i>.<br><br><b> certain of your own poets</b>] viz. Aratus, in the opening lines of the poem called “the Phenomena:”... Cleanthes also in his hymn to Zeus (Jupiter), has the same words. Aratus was a<i> native of Tarsus</i>, about 270 B.C., and wrote astronomical poems, of which two remain. Cleanthes was born at Assos, in Troas, about 300 B.C. The Apostle, by the plural, seems to have both poets in his mind.—The<b> his</b> refers to Zeus (Jupiter) in both cases, the admission being taken as a portion of truth regarding the Supreme God, which even heathen poets confessed.
