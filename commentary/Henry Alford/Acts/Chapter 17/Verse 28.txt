 28. ] There is no justification for  the pantheist in this.
	It is properly said only of the race of  men , as being His offspring, bound to Him: proceeding from, and upheld by, and therefore living, moving, and being  in Him: but even in a wider sense  His Being , though a separate objective Personality, involves and contains that of His creatures. See Ephesians 1:10 , where the same is said of Christ.  ἐν αὐτῷ must not be taken for ‘  by Him;’ the subsequent citation would in that case be irrelevant.

Storr’s explanation of ζῶμεν by ‘vivimus beate ac hilare,’ and Kuinoel and Olshausen’s of ἐσμέν by ‘  real being ,’ i.e. ‘  the spiritual life ,’ are evidently beside the purpose; the intent being to shew the  absolute dependence for every thing of man on God, and thence the  absurdity of supposing the Godhead like to the works of his (man’s)  hands .

Kleanthes also, Hymn. in Jov. 5, has ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ γένος ἐσμέν . Aratus was a  native of Tarsus , about 270 B.C., and wrote astronomical poems, of which two, the φαινόμενα and διοσημεία , remain. Kleanthes was born at Assos, in Troas, about 300 B.C. The Apostle, by the plural, seems to have both poets in his mind.
	The τοῦ refers to  Zeus in both cases, the admission being taken as a portion of truth regarding the Supreme God, which even heathen poets confessed. The καί has no connexion  here , but is (see above) part of the verse in Aratus.
