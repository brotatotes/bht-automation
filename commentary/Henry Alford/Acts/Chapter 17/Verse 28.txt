<p><strong> 28.</strong> ] There is no justification for <em> the pantheist</em> in this.
	</p>
<p>It is properly said only of the race of <em> men</em> , as being His offspring, bound to Him: proceeding from, and upheld by, and therefore living, moving, and being <em> in</em> Him: but even in a wider sense <em> His Being</em> , though a separate objective Personality, involves and contains that of His creatures. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span> , where the same is said of Christ. <strong> ἐν αὐτῷ</strong> must not be taken for ‘ <em> by</em> Him;’ the subsequent citation would in that case be irrelevant.

<p><strong> ζῶμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κιν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐσμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] ‘A climax: <em> out of</em> God we should have no <em> Life</em> , nor even <em> movement</em> (which some things without life have, plants, water, &amp;c.), nay, not any <em> existence</em> at all (we should not have <em> been</em> ).’ Meyer. Storr’s explanation of ζῶμεν by ‘vivimus beate ac hilare,’ and Kuinoel and Olshausen’s of ἐσμέν by ‘ <em> real being</em> ,’ i.e. ‘ <em> the spiritual life</em> ,’ are evidently beside the purpose; the intent being to shew the <em> absolute dependence for every thing</em> of man on God, and thence the <em> absurdity of supposing the Godhead like to the works of his</em> (man’s) <em> hands</em> .

<p><strong> τοῦ γὰρ κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐσμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Aratus, in the opening lines of the Phænomena.… πάντη δὲ Διὸς κεχρήμεθα πάντες· τοῦ γὰρ καὶ γένος ἐσμέν . Kleanthes also, Hymn. in Jov. 5, has ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ γένος ἐσμέν . Aratus was a <em> native of Tarsus</em> , about 270 B.C., and wrote astronomical poems, of which two, the φαινόμενα and διοσημεία , remain. Kleanthes was born at Assos, in Troas, about 300 B.C. The Apostle, by the plural, seems to have both poets in his mind.

<p>The τοῦ refers to <em> Zeus</em> in both cases, the admission being taken as a portion of truth regarding the Supreme God, which even heathen poets confessed. The καί has no connexion <em> here</em> , but is (see above) part of the verse in Aratus.</p>
