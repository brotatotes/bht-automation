 30.   ὑπεριδών ] In this word lie treasures of mercy for those who lived in the times of ignorance. God  overlooked them [the rendering of the E. V. bears the same meaning, but is to our ears in these days objectionable]: i.e. corrected not this  ignorance itself as a sin, but  the abuses even of this , by which the heathen sunk into deeper degradation. The same argument is treated more at length in Romans 12:0 . The πᾶσι of the rec. and ἵνα πάντες of D 1 have both been corrections occasioned by the apparent difficulty of τοῖς ἀνθρώποις πάντας . The genuine reading gives the emphatic πάντας πανταχοῦ , following on the foregoing assertion of Acts 17:25-26 , its proper place.
