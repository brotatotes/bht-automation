 31.   καθότι ] See var. read. and reff.: used by Luke and him only: ‘  seeing that ,’  inasmuch as .
	 ἐν δικαιος  . ] δικαιος . is the character of the judgment, the element, of which it shall consist.
	 ἐν ἀνδρί ] Not, ‘in (by)  a man,’ but  by (i.e. in the person of)  the  man : the art. is omitted after the preposition: see Midd. vi. 1. The  ἐν is not instrumental, properly speaking, here or any where else. Its judicial use is only a particular case of its usage of  investiture or  elementary condition: in the judge the judgment consists, is constituted; he is its vehicle and expression. See ref. 1 Cor. and note for examples of this use.
	 πίστ . κ . τ . λ . ‘Quia res erat vix credibilis, argumentum adfert eximium.’ Grotius.
