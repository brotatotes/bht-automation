<p><strong> 31. </strong> <strong> καθότι</strong> ] See var. read. and reff.: used by Luke and him only: ‘ <em> seeing that</em> ,’ <strong> inasmuch as</strong> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν δικαιος</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] δικαιος . is the character of the judgment, the element, of which it shall consist.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν ἀνδρί</strong> ] Not, ‘in (by) <em> a</em> man,’ but <strong> by</strong> (i.e. in the person of) <em> the</em> <strong> man</strong> : the art. is omitted after the preposition: see Midd. vi. 1. The <strong> ἐν</strong> is not instrumental, properly speaking, here or any where else. Its judicial use is only a particular case of its usage of <em> investiture</em> or <em> elementary condition: in</em> the judge the judgment consists, is constituted; he is its vehicle and expression. See ref. 1 Cor. and note for examples of this use.
