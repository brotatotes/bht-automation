<p><strong> 32. </strong> <strong> ἀνάστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> νεκρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Perhaps here, ‘ <em> when they heard of a resurrection of dead men</em> ,’ viz. of that of Christ, νεκρῶν being generic. But the same words are used in ref. 1 Cor. πῶς λέγουσιν ἐν ὑμῖν τινες ὅτι <strong> ἀνάστασις νεκρῶν</strong> οὐκ ἔστιν ; so that I would rather take them here to mean that they inferred the general possibility of the resurrection of the dead, as a tenet of Paul’s, from the one case which he mentioned.

<p><strong> οἱ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> οἱ δέ</strong> ] We must not allot these two parties as some have done, the former to the Epicureans, the latter to the Stoics: the description is general.

<p>The words <strong> ἀκουσόμεθα</strong> <strong> .…</strong> need not be taken as ironical. The hearing not having taken place is no proof that it was not intended at the time: and the distinction between these and the mockers seems to imply that they were in earnest.</p>
