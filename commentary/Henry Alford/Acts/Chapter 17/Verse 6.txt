The exact accuracy of the title as existing at Thessalonica, has been proved by an inscription found on the spot, in which it occurs: and in the same inscription curiously enough we have three of the names which occur here, or in the Epistles, as companions of Paul: viz. Sosipater (<i>of Ber≈ìa</i>, Rom. xvi. 21, see also Acts xx. 4): Secundus (<i>of Thessalonica</i>, ch. xx. 4); and Gaius (<i>the Macedonian</i>, note, ch. xix. 29).<br><br><b> These that have turned the world upside down</b>] The words presuppose some rumour of Christianity and its spread having before reached the inhabitants of Thessalonica.
