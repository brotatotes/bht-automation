A wider acquaintance is shewn, or at least assumed, with the belief of Christians, than extended merely to Jason and his friends.<br><br><b> saying that there is another king, one Jesus</b>] This false charge seems to have been founded on Paul’s preaching much at Thessalonica concerning the triumphant coming and kingdom of Christ. This appears again and again in his two Epistles: see 1 Thess. i. 10; ii. 19; iii. 13; iv. 13–18; v. 1, 2; 2 Thess. i. 5, 7–10; ii. 1–12: and particularly 2 Thess. ii. 5, where he refers to his having often told them of<i> these things</i>, viz. the course, and destruction of Antichrist, by whom these Jews might perhaps misrepresent Paul as designating Cæsar.
