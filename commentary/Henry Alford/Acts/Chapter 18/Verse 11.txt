<b> 11.</b>] The year and a half may extend either to his<i> departure</i>, or to the incident in ver. 12 ff. Meyer would confine it to the latter, taking the verb in the sense of ‘<i>remained in quiet:</i>’ but it will hardly bear such emphasis: and seeing that the incident in vv. 12 ff. was a notable fulfilment of the promise,—for though they set on him,<i> they could not hurt him</i>,—I should be disposed to take the other view, and regard that which is related ver. 12 to ver. 18, as having happened during this time.
