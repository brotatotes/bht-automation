<b> 12. Gallio</b>] His original name was Marcus Annæus Novatus: but, having been adopted into the family of the rhetorician Lucius Junius Gallio, he took the name of Junius Annæus Gallio. He was brother of Lucius Annæus Seneca, the philosopher, whose character of him is in exact accordance with that which we may infer from this narrative: “No man on earth is so pleasant to me, as this man is to all.” “Gallio, my brother, whom there is none that does not love a little, even those who have not the power of loving more.” He is called “<i>the pleasant Gallio</i>” by Statius. He appears to have given up the province of Achaia from ill health. He was spared after the execution of his brother: but Dio Cassius adds, that Seneca’s brothers were put to death afterwards, and Eusebius in his Chronicle, on A.D. 66, says that he put an end to himself after his brother’s death.
