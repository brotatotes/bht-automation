<b> 12. Gallio</b>] His original name was Marcus Annæus Novatus: but, having been adopted into the family of the rhetorician Lucius Junius Gallio, he took the name of Junius Annæus Gallio. He was brother of Lucius Annæus Seneca, the philosopher, whose character of him is in exact accordance with that which we may infer from this narrative: “No man on earth is so pleasant to me, as this man is to all.” “Gallio, my brother, whom there is none that does not love a little, even those who have not the power of loving more.” He is called “<i>the pleasant Gallio</i>” by Statius. He appears to have given up the province of Achaia from ill health. He was spared after the execution of his brother: but Dio Cassius adds, that Seneca’s brothers were put to death afterwards, and Eusebius in his Chronicle, on A.D. 66, says that he put an end to himself after his brother’s death.<br><br><b> the deputy</b>] See note on ch. xiii. 7. Achaia was originally a senatorial province, but was temporarily made an imperial one by Tiberius.<br><br><b> of Achaia</b>] The Roman province of Achaia contained Hellas and the Peloponnesus, and, with Macedonia, embraced all their Grecian dominions.— “The<b> judgment seat</b> is mentioned three times in the course of this narrative (see vv. 16, 17). It was of two kinds: (1) fixed in some public and open place: (2) moveable, and taken by the Roman magistrates to be placed wherever they might sit in a judicial character. Probably here and in the case of Pilate (John xix. 13), the former kind of seat is intended. See Smith’s Dict. of Antiquities, under ‘Sella.’ See also some remarks on ‘the tribunal,—the indispensable symbol of the Roman judgment seat,’ in the Edinburgh Review for Jan. 1847, p. 151.” Conybeare and Howson, vol. i. 494.
