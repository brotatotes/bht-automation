 17.   πάντες ] Apparently, all the  mob , i.e. the Gentile population present. Sosthenes, as the ruler of the synagogue ( ἀρχ . = either the ruler, or  one of the rulers; perhaps he had succeeded Crispus), had been the chief of the complainant Jews, and therefore, on their cause being rejected, and themselves ignominiously dismissed, was roughly treated by the mob. From this, certainly the right explanation, has arisen the gloss οἱ Ἕλληνες . The other gloss, οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι , has sprung from the notion that this Sosthenes was the same person with the Sosthenes of 1 Corinthians 1:1 , a Christian and a companion of Paul. But, not to insist on the improbability of the party driven from the tribunal having beaten one of their antagonists in front of the tribunal,  why did they not beat Paul himself ? There is no ground for supposing the two persons to be the same, Sosthenes being no uncommon name. If they were, this man must have been converted afterwards; but he is not among those who accompanied Paul into Asia, either in Acts 18:18 , or ch. Acts 20:4 .
	The carelessness of Gallio about the matter clearly seems to be a further instance of his contempt for the Jews, and indisposition to favour them or their persecution of Paul. Had this been otherwise meant, certainly καί would not have been the copula. ‘So little did the information against Paul prosper, that the informers themselves were beaten without interference of the judge.’ Meyer.
