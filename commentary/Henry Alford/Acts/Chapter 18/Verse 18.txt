<b> 18.</b>] It has been considered doubtful whether the words<b> having shorn his head in Cenchrĕa</b> apply to<i> Paul</i>, the subject of the sentence, or to<i> Aquila</i>, the last subject. I agree with Neander that if we consider the matter carefully, there can be no doubt that they<i> can only apply to Paul</i>. For, although this vow differed from that of the Nazarite, who shaved his hair at the<i> end</i> of his votive period in the temple at Jerusalem, and burnt it with his peace-offering (Num. vi. 1–21), Josephus gives us a description of a somewhat similar one, where it appears that the hair was shaved thirty days before the sacrifice. At all events,<i> no sacrifice could be offered any where but at Jerusalem:</i> and every such vow would conclude with a sacrifice. Now we find, on comparing the subsequent course of Aquila with that of Paul,—that the former<i> did not go up to Jerusalem</i>, but remained at Ephesus (ver. 26): but that Paul<i> hastened by</i> Ephesus, and did go up to Jerusalem: see ver. 22. Again, it would be quite irrelevant to the purpose of St. Luke, to relate such a fact of<i> one of Paul's companions</i>. That he should do so apologetically, to shew that the Apostle still countenanced conformity with the law, is a view which I cannot find justified by any features of this book: and it surely would bea very far-fetched apology, and one likely to escape the notice of many readers, seeing that Aquila would not appear as being under Paul’s influence, and even his conversion to the Gospel has not been related, but is left to be implied from ver. 26. Again, Meyer’s ground for referring the action to Aquila,—that his name is here placed after that of his wife,—is untenable, seeing that, for some reason, probably the superior character or office in the church, of Priscilla, the same arrangement is found (in the best MSS. at ver. 26, and) at Rom. xvi. 3; 2 Tim. iv. 19. There need be no enquiry<i> what danger</i> can have prompted such a vow on his part, when we recollect the catalogue given by him in 2 Cor. xi. Besides, he had, since his last visit to Jerusalem, been suffering from sickness (see note on ch. xvi. 6, and Introd. to Gal.§1. 3): it is true, a considerable time ago, but this need not prevent our supposing that the vow may have been then made, to be paid on his next visit to Jerusalem. That he had not sooner paid it is accounted for by his having been since that time under continual pressure of preaching and founding churches, and having finally been detained by special command at Corinth. That he was now so anxious to pay it (ver. 21), consists well with the supposition of its having been long delayed.
