<b> 19. Ephesus</b>] Ephesus was the ancient capital of Ionia, and at this time, of the Roman proconsular province of Asia,—on the Caÿster, near the coast, between Smyrna and Miletus. It was famed for its commerce, but even more for its magnificent temple of Artemis (Diana: see ch. xix. 24, 27, and notes). See a full account of its situation and history, secular and Christian, in the Introduction to Eph.§2. 2–6; and an interesting description, with plan, in Mr. Lewin’s Life and Epistles of St. Paul, i. 344 ff.
