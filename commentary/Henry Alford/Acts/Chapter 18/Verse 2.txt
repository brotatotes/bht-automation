<b> 2. a certain Jew</b>] It appears that Aquila and Priscilla were<i> not Christians</i> at this time: it is the similarity of employment only which draws them to St. Paul, and their conversion is left to be inferred as taking place in consequence: see ver. 26.<br><br><b> born in Pontus</b>] literally,<b> a Pontian by race.</b> It is remarkable, that<i> Pontius Aquila</i> is a name found in the Pontian<i> gens</i> at Rome more than once in the days of the Republic, whence some have supposed that this may have been a freedman of a Pontius Aquila, and that the words “<i>a Pontian by race</i>” may have been an inference from his name. But besides that St. Luke’s acquaintance with the real origin of Aquila could hardly but have been accurate,—<i>Aquila</i>, the translator of the Old Test. into Greek,<i> was also a native of Pontius.</i> From the notices of Aquila and Priscilla in the Epistles, they appear to have travelled, fixing their abode by turns in different principal cities for the sake of their business. In ver. 19, we have them left at Ephesus (see also ver. 26): in 1 Cor. xvi. 19, still there; in Rom. xvi. 3 ff, again at Rome; in 2 Tim. iv. 19, again at Ephesus.<br><br><b> because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome...</b>] Suetonius says, “The Jews, who at the instigation of<i> Chrestus</i> were continually exciting tumults, he expelled from Rome,” but as he gives this without any fixed note of time, as the words “<i>at the instigation of Chrestus</i>” may be taken in three ways (as indicative either (1) of an actual leader of that name, or (2) of some tumult connected with the expectations of a Messiah, or (3) of some dispute about Christianity), Neander well observes that after all which has been said on it, no secure historical inference respecting the date of the event, or its connexion with any Christian church at Rome, can be drawn. It was<i> as a Jew</i> that Aquila was driven from Rome: and there is not a word of Christians here. See more in my Greek Test. ‘The edicts soon became invalid, or the prohibition was taken off: we find Aquila at Rome, Rom. xvi. 3, and many Jews resident there, ch. xxviii. 17 ff.
