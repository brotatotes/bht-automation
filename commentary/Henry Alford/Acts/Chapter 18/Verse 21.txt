<b> 21.</b>] The omission of the words here inserted in the common text, “<i>I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem</i>,” seems necessitated on the principle of being guided in doubtful cases by the testimony of our most ancient MSS. The text thus produced is the shortest and simplest, and the facts, of other glosses having been attempted on this verse, and of one MS. inserting the words without altering the construction to suit them, and of other variations, tend perhaps to throw discredit on the insertion. The gloss, if such it be, has probably been owing to an endeavour to conform the circumstances to those related in ch. xx. 16. If the words are to stand, and for those who read them, it may still be interesting to enquire at<i> what feast</i> they may be supposed to point. (1)<i> Not at the Passover:</i> for the ordinary duration of the winter<i> shutting up of the sea</i> was till the vernal equinox. And we are not at liberty to assume an exceptional case, such as sometimes occurred. Hence, if the voyage from Corinth at all approached the length of that from Philippi to Jerusalem in ch. xx., xxi., he would have set sail at a time when it would have been hardly possible. (2)<i> Not at the Feast of Tabernacles</i>. For if it were, he must have sailed from Corinth in August or September. Now, as he stayed there something more than a year and a half, his sea-voyage from Berœa to Athens would in this case have been made in the depth of winter; which (especially as a choice of land or water was open to him) is impossible. (3) It remains, then, that the feast should have been<i> Pentecost</i>; at which Paul also visited Jerusalem, ch. xx. 16. The Apostle’s promise of return was fulfilled ch. xix. 1 ff.
