 23. ] PAUL’S VISIT TO THE CHURCHES IN GALATIA AND PHRYGIA.
	Either (1) Galatia is here a general term including Lycaonia, and Paul went by Derbe, Lystra, Iconium, &c. as before in ch. 16, or (2) he did not visit Lycaonia this time, but went through Cappadocia: to which also the words διελθόντα τὰ ἀνωτερικὰ μέρη (ch. Act 19:1 ) seem to point, ἡ ἄνω Ἀσία being the country east of the Halys. We find Christian churches in Cappadocia, 1 Peter 1:1 . On this journey, as connected with the state of the Galatian churches, see Prolegg. to Gal. § iii. 1.
	 καθεξῆς implies taking the churches in order; regularly visiting them, each as they lay in his route.
	One work accomplished by him in this journey was the ordaining (but apparently not collecting) a contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem: see 1 Corinthians 16:1 .
	Timotheus and Erastus probably accompanied him, see ch. Act 19:22 ; 2 Corinthians 1:1 ; and Gaius and Aristarchus, ch. Acts 19:29 ; and perhaps Titus, 2Co 12:18 al. (and Sosthenes? ( 1Co 1:1 ), but see on Acts 18:17 .)
