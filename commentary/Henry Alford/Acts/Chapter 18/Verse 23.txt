<b> 23.</b>] PAUL’ S VISIT TO THE CHURCHES IN GALATIA AND PHRYGIA.—Either (1) Galatia is here a general term including Lycaonia, and St. Paul went by Derbe, Lystra, Iconium, &c. as before in ch. xvi., or (2) he did not visit Lycaonia this time, but went through Cappadocia: to which also the words “<i>having passed through the upper tracts</i>” (ch. xix. 1) seem to point, “upper Asia” being the country east of the Halys. We find Christian churches in Cappadocia, 1 Pet. i. 1. On this journey, as connected with the state of the Galatian churches, see Introduction to Gal.§3. 1.<br><br><b> in order</b> implies that he regularly visited the churches, each as they lay in his route.—One work accomplished by him in this journey was the ordaining (but apparently not collecting) a contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem: see 1 Cor. xvi. 1,—Timotheus and Erastus probably accompanied him, see ch. xix. 22; 2 Cor. i. 1; and Gaius and Aristarchus, ch. xix. 29; and perhaps Titus, 2 Cor. xii. 18 al. (and Sosthenes? 1 Cor. i. 1, but see on ver. 17).<br><br> The name<b> Apollos</b> is abbreviated from<b> Apollonius</b>, as Lucas from Lucanus, &c.<br><br><b> born at Alexandria</b>] literally,<b> an Alexandrian by race</b>. Alexandria was the great seat of the Hellenistic or later Greek language, learning, and philosophy (see ch. vi. 9). A large number of Jews had been planted there by its founder, Alexander the Great. The celebrated LXX version of the Old Test. was made there under the Ptolemies. There took place that remarkable fusion of Greek, Oriental, and Judaic elements of thought and belief, which was destined to enter so widely, for good and for evil, into the minds and writings of Christians. We see in the providential calling of Apollos to the ministry, an instance of adaptation of the workman to the work. A masterly exposition of the Scriptures by a learned Hellenist of Alexandria formed the most appropriate watering (1 Cor. iii. 6) for those who had been planted by the pupil of Gamaliel. The word rendered<b> eloquent</b> may mean<b> learned</b>. But the former meaning is most appropriate here, both because the peculiar kind of learning implied by it, acquaintance with stories and legends, would not be likely to be predicated of Apollos,—and because the subsequent words,<i> mighty in the Scriptures</i>, sufficiently indicate his<i> learning</i>, and in what it lay.
