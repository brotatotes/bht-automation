<b> 23.</b>] PAUL’ S VISIT TO THE CHURCHES IN GALATIA AND PHRYGIA.—Either (1) Galatia is here a general term including Lycaonia, and St. Paul went by Derbe, Lystra, Iconium, &c. as before in ch. xvi., or (2) he did not visit Lycaonia this time, but went through Cappadocia: to which also the words “<i>having passed through the upper tracts</i>” (ch. xix. 1) seem to point, “upper Asia” being the country east of the Halys. We find Christian churches in Cappadocia, 1 Pet. i. 1. On this journey, as connected with the state of the Galatian churches, see Introduction to Gal.§3. 1.
