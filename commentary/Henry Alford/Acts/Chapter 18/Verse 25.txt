<b> 25.</b>] Apollos had received (from his youth?) the true doctrine of the Messiahship of Jesus, as pointed out by John the Baptist: doubtless from some disciple of John; but more than this he knew not. The<i> doctrines</i> of the Cross,—the Resurrection,—the outpouring of the Spirit,—these were unknown to him: but more particularly (from the words “<i>knowing only the baptism of John</i>”) the<i> latter</i>, as connected with Christian baptism: see further on ch. xix. 2, 3.—The mistake of supposing that he<i> did not know Jesus to be the Messiah</i>, has arisen from the description of his subsequent work at Corinth, ver. 28, but by no means follows from it:<i> this he did before</i>, but not so completely. The same mistake has led to the alteration of Jesus into “<i>the Lord</i>” in the ordinary text, it having been well imagined that he could not teach<b> accurately the things concerning Jesus</b>, if he did not know him to be the Messiah: whereas by these words is imported that he knew and taught accurately the<i> facts</i> respecting Jesus, but of the<i> consequences</i> of that which he taught, of all which may be summed up in the doctrine of Christian baptism, he had no idea.<br><br><b> knowing only...</b>] Meyer well remarks, that it is not meant that he was absolutely ignorant of the fact of there<i> being such a thing</i> as Christian baptism, but ignorant of its being any thing different from that of John: he knew, or recognized in baptism only that which the baptism of John was: a sign of repentance.
