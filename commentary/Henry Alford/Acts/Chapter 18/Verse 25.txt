<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] Apollos had received (from his youth?) the true doctrine of the Messiahship of Jesus, as pointed out by John the Baptist: doubtless from some disciple of John: but more than this he knew not. The <em> doctrines</em> of the Cross, the Resurrection, the outpouring of the Spirit, these were unknown to him: but more particularly (from the words ἐπιστ . μόνον τὸ βάπτ . Ἰωάν .) the <em> latter</em> , as connected with Christian baptism: see further on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:2-3">Acts 19:2-3</span> .

<p>The mistake of supposing that he <em> did not know Jesus to be the Messiah</em> , has arisen from the description of his subsequent work at Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:28">Acts 18:28</span> , but by no means follows from it: <em> this he did before</em> , but not so completely. The same mistake has led to the alteration of Ἰησοῦ into the κυρίου of the rec., it having been well imagined that he could not teach ἀκριβῶς τὰ π . τοῦ Ἰησοῦ if he did not know him to be the Messiah: whereas by these words is imported that he knew and taught accurately the <em> facts</em> respecting Jesus, but of the <em> consequences</em> of that which he taught, of all which may be summed up in the doctrine of Christian baptism, he had no idea.

<p><strong> ἐπιστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> μόνον</strong> ] Meyer well remarks, that it is not meant that he was absolutely ignorant of the fact of there <em> being such a thing</em> as Christian baptism, but ignorant of its being any thing different from that of John: he knew, or recognized in baptism only that which the baptism of John was: a sign of repentance.</p>
