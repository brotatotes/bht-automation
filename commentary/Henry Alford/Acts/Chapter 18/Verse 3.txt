<b> 3. wrought</b>] “The Jewish Rabbis having no state pay, it was their practice to teach their children a trade. ‘What is commanded of a father towards his son?’ asks a Talmudic writer, ‘To circumcise him, to teach him the law, to teach him a trade.’ Rabbi Judah saith, ‘He that teacheth not his son a trade, doth the same as if he taught him to be a thief:’ and Rabban Gamaliel saith, ‘He that hath a trade in his hand, to what is he like? He is like a vineyard that is fenced.’” Conybeare and Howson, i.p. 58.—The places where St. Paul refers to his supporting himself by his own manual labour are,—ch. xx. 34 (Ephesus):—1 Cor. ix. 12 ff.; 2 Cor. vii. 2 (Corinth):—1 Thess. ii. 9; 2 Thess. iii. 8 (Thessalonica).—In 2 Cor. xi. 9, we learn that supplies were also brought to him at Corinth from Macedonia, i.e. Philippi: see Phil. iv. 15.
