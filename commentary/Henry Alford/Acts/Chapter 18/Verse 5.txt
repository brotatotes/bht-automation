	 συνείχετο τῷ λόγῳ ] ‘  When Silas and Timotheus arrived [see ch. Act 17:15 note]  from Macedonia, they found Paul anxiously occupied in discoursing to the Jews .’ This I believe to be the meaning: that they found him in a state of more than ordinary anxiety, more than usually absorbed in the work of testifying to the Jews (see reff.): a crisis in the work being imminent, which resulted in their rejection of the word of life. (On the whole character of his early preaching at Corinth, see notes, 1 Corinthians 2:1-5 .) Thus only, the δέ in Act 18:5 and that in Act 18:6 will both be satisfied:  he discoursed in the synagogue, &c.… but when Silas and Timotheus arrived, he was earnestly occupied in discoursing, &c. But, as they opposed themselves and blasphemed, &c . Wordsworth adopts the view that after the arrival of Silas and Timotheus with supplies from Macedonia, Paul gave up his tent-making and gave himself up ( συνείχετο ) to preaching. But surely this is ungrammatical. The aor. ( ὡς κατῆλθον ) and imperf. ( συνείχετο ) require the rendering ‘when they arrived, they found him συνεχόμενον .’
