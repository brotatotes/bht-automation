 1.   τὰ ἀνωτερικὰ μέρη ] By this name were known the eastern parts of Asia Minor, beyond the river Halys, or in comparison with Ephesus, in the direction of that river. So Herodotus, speaking as a Halicarnassian, calls even the neighbourhood of Sardis τὰ ἄνω τῆς Ἀσίας , i. 177; including in the term, however, many of the inland districts, Assyria, Babylonia, &c. So that the reading ἀνατολικά , which is found in three cursives and Theophyl-sif., is a good gloss.
	 τινας μαθητάς ] These seem to have been in the same situation as Apollos, see on ch. Acts 18:25 . They cannot have been mere disciples of John, on account of πιστεύσαντες , which can bear no meaning but that of believing  on the Lord Jesus : but they had received only John’s baptism, and had had no proof of the descent of the Holy Spirit, nor knowledge of His gifts.
