<b> 10. two years</b>] We cannot derive any certain estimate of the length of St. Paul’s stay in Ephesus from these words,—even if we add the three months of ver. 8,—for vv. 21, 22 admit of an<i> interval after the expiration of the two years and three months</i>. And his own expression, ch. xx. 31,<i> “three whole years</i>,” implies that it was longer than from this chapter would at first sight appear. He probably (compare his announced intention, 1 Cor. xvi. 8, with his expectation of meeting Titus at Troas, 2 Cor. ii. 12, 13, which shews that he was not far off the time previously arranged) left Ephesus about or soon after the third Pentecost after that which he kept in Jerusalem. See Introd. to 1 Cor.§6.<br><br><b> all they which dwelt in Asia</b>] Hyperbolical:—<i>all had the opportunity,</i> and probably some of every considerable town availed themselves of it. To this long teaching of St. Paul the seven churches of Asia owe their establishment.
