<b> 12.</b>]<i> Diseases,</i> and<i> possession by evil spirits</i>, are here plainly<i> distinguished</i> from each other. ‘The rationalists, and semi-rationalists, are much troubled to clear the fact related, that such handkerchiefs and aprons were<i> instrumental in working the cures</i>, from participation in what they are pleased to call a popular notion founded in superstition and error. But in this and similar narratives (see ch. vv. 15, note) Christian faith finds no difficulty whatever. All miraculous working is an exertion of the direct power of the All-powerful; a suspension<i> by Him</i> of His ordinary laws: and whether He will use any instrument in doing this, or what instrument, must depend altogether on His own purpose in the miracle—the effect to be produced on the recipients, beholders, or hearers. Without His special selection and enabling,<i> all instruments were vain;</i> with these,<i> all are capable</i>. In the present case, as before in ch. v. 15, it was His purpose to exalt His Apostle as the Herald of His gospel, and to lay in Ephesus the strong foundation of His church. And He therefore endues him with this extraordinary power. But to argue by analogy from such a case,—to suppose that because our Lord was able, and Peter, and Paul, and in Old Test. times Elisha, were enabled, to exert this peculiar power, therefore the same will be possessed by the body or relics of every real or supposed saint, is the height of folly and fanaticism. The true analogy tends directly the other way. In<i> no cases but these</i> do we find the power, even in the apostolic days: and the general cessation of all extraordinary gifts of the Spirit would lead us to the inference that<i> à fortiori</i><i> these</i>, which were even then the rarest, have ceased also.
