<b> 2.</b>] The indefinite past tense in the original should be faithfully rendered: not as A.V. ‘<i>Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?</i>’ but<b> Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye became believers?</b> i.e. ‘<i>on your becoming believers, had ye the gifts of the Spirit conferred on you?</i>’—as in ch. viii. 16, 17. This is both grammatically neccssary, and absolutely demanded by the sense; the enquiry being, not as to any reception of the Holy Ghost during the period since their baptism, but as to one simultaneous with their first reception into the church: and their<i> not</i> having<i> then</i> received Him is accounted for by the<i> deficiency of their baptism</i>.
