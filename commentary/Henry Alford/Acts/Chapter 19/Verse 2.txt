<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> ἐλάβ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πιστεύς</strong> .] The aorist should be faithfully rendered: not as E. V. ‘ <em> Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed</em> ?’ but <strong> Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye became</strong> (not, <em> when ye had become:</em> cf. προσευξάμενοι εἶπαν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:24">Acts 1:24</span> , and Winer, edn. 6, § 45. 6. b, also note on Act 19:29 ) <strong> believers</strong> ? i.e. ‘ <em> on your becoming believers, had ye the gifts of the Spirit conferred on you</em> ?’ as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:16-17">Acts 8:16-17</span> . This is both grammatically necessary (see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:11">Romans 13:11</span> , ἐγγύτερον ἡμῶν ἡ σωτηρία ἢ ὅτε ἐπιστεύσαμεν ), and absolutely demanded by the sense; the enquiry being, not as to any reception of the Holy Ghost during the period <em> since</em> their baptism, but as to one simultaneous with their first reception into the church: and their <em> not</em> having <em> then</em> received Him is accounted for by the <em> deficiency of their baptism</em> .

<p><strong> ἀλλ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> οὐδέ</strong> ] <strong> On the contrary, not even</strong> …
	</p>
<p><strong> ἠκούσαμεν</strong> ] Here again, not, ‘we <em> have not</em> heard,’ which would involve an absurdity: ‘nam neque Mosen neque Johannem Baptistam sequi potuissent, quin de Spiritu Sancto ipso audissent’ (Bengel); but <strong> we did not hear</strong> , at the time of our conversion: Our reception into the faith was unaccompanied by any preaching of the office or the gifts of the Spirit, our baptism was not followed by any imparting of His gifts: <strong> we did not so much as hear Him mentioned</strong> . <strong> ἐστιν</strong> cannot, from its position, be emphatic, nor does it mean “were to be had” (Wordsw.), as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span> . The stress of the sentence is on ἠκούσαμεν : so for from <em> receiving</em> the Holy Ghost, they did not even <em> hear</em> of His existence. Tiros only will find an objection to this rendering in ἐστίν (expecting ἦν ): the present is commonly used after the aorist of declarative verbs or verbs of sense, in the clause which contains the matter declared, seen, or heard: the action being transferred <em> pro tempore</em> to the time spoken of.
