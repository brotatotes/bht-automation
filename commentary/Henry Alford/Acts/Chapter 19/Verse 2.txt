<b> 2.</b>] The indefinite past tense in the original should be faithfully rendered: not as A.V. ‘<i>Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?</i>’ but<b> Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye became believers?</b> i.e. ‘<i>on your becoming believers, had ye the gifts of the Spirit conferred on you?</i>’—as in ch. viii. 16, 17. This is both grammatically neccssary, and absolutely demanded by the sense; the enquiry being, not as to any reception of the Holy Ghost during the period since their baptism, but as to one simultaneous with their first reception into the church: and their<i> not</i> having<i> then</i> received Him is accounted for by the<i> deficiency of their baptism</i>.<br><br><b> We did not so much as hear</b>] Literally,<b> on the contrary, not even...</b> Here again, not, ‘we<i> have not</i> heard,’ which would involve an absurdity: “for they could not be followers of Moses or of John the Baptist, without hearing of the Holy Ghost” (Bengel);—but<b> we did not hear</b>, at the time of our conversion:—Our reception into the faith was unaccompanied by any preaching of the office or the gifts of the Spirit,—our baptism was not followed by any imparting of His gifts:<b> we did not so much as hear Him mentioned</b>. The stress of the sentence is on<i> hearing</i>: so far from<i> receiving</i> the Holy Ghost, they did not even<i> hear</i> of His existence.
