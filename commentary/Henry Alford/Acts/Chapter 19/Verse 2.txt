 2.   ἐλάβ  .   πιστεύς .] The aorist should be faithfully rendered: not as E. V. ‘  Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed ?’ but  Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye became (not,  when ye had become: cf. προσευξάμενοι εἶπαν , ch. Acts 1:24 , and Winer, edn. 6, § 45. 6. b, also note on Act 19:29 )  believers ? i.e. ‘  on your becoming believers, had ye the gifts of the Spirit conferred on you ?’ as in ch. Acts 8:16-17 . This is both grammatically necessary (see also Romans 13:11 , ἐγγύτερον ἡμῶν ἡ σωτηρία ἢ ὅτε ἐπιστεύσαμεν ), and absolutely demanded by the sense; the enquiry being, not as to any reception of the Holy Ghost during the period  since their baptism, but as to one simultaneous with their first reception into the church: and their  not having  then received Him is accounted for by the  deficiency of their baptism .
	 ἀλλ  ʼ   οὐδέ ]  On the contrary, not even …
	 ἠκούσαμεν ] Here again, not, ‘we  have not heard,’ which would involve an absurdity: ‘nam neque Mosen neque Johannem Baptistam sequi potuissent, quin de Spiritu Sancto ipso audissent’ (Bengel); but  we did not hear , at the time of our conversion: Our reception into the faith was unaccompanied by any preaching of the office or the gifts of the Spirit, our baptism was not followed by any imparting of His gifts:  we did not so much as hear Him mentioned .  ἐστιν cannot, from its position, be emphatic, nor does it mean “were to be had” (Wordsw.), as John 7:39 . The stress of the sentence is on ἠκούσαμεν : so for from  receiving the Holy Ghost, they did not even  hear of His existence. Tiros only will find an objection to this rendering in ἐστίν (expecting ἦν ): the present is commonly used after the aorist of declarative verbs or verbs of sense, in the clause which contains the matter declared, seen, or heard: the action being transferred  pro tempore to the time spoken of.
