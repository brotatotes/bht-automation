 21.   ταῦτα ] The occurrences of Acts 19:19-20 .
	 ἐν τῷ πν .] An expression mostly used by Paul, see ref.
	 δεῖ ] As he was sent to the Gentiles, he saw that the great metropolis of the Gentile world was the legitimate centre of his apostolic working. Or perhaps he speaks under some divine intimation that  ultimately he should be brought to Rome. If so, his words were literally fulfilled. He  did see Rome after he had been at Jerusalem this next time: but after considerable delay, and as a prisoner. Cf. the same design expressed by him, Romans 1:15 ; Romans 15:23-28 ; and Paley’s remarks in the Horæ Paulinæ.
