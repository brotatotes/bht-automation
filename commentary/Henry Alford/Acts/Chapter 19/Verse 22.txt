This mission of Timothy is alluded to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:17">1 Corinthians 4:17</span> (see ib. 1Co 1:1 ); <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10">1 Corinthians 16:10</span> . The object of it was to bring these churches in Macedonia and Achaia into remembrance of the ways and teaching of Paul. It occurred shortly before the writing of 1 Cor. He was ( 1Co 16:11 ) soon to return: but considerable uncertainty hangs over this journey. We find him again with Paul in Macedonia, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span> ; but apparently he had not reached Corinth.

It gives the <em> direction</em> of the tarrying, as in the expressions ἐς δόμους μένειν , Soph. Ag. 80, and διεκαρτέρουν εἰς τὴν πατρίδα , Lycurg. cont. Leocr., p. 158. It is far better to take it thus, with Meyer, than with Winer, Gr., edn. 6, § 50.4. b, as importing ‘in favour of,’ ‘for the benefit of’) Ephesus: Asia is named by way of contrast with Macedonia, just before mentioned.
