<b> 22.</b>] He intended<i> himself to follow</i>, after Pentecost, 1 Cor. xvi. 8. This mission of Timothy is alluded to 1 Cor. iv. 17 (see also 1 Cor. i. 1); xvi. 10. The object of it was to bring these churches in Macedonia and Achaia into remembrance of the ways and teaching of Paul. It occurred shortly-before the writing of 1 Cor. He was (1 Cor. xvi. 11) soon to return:—but considerable uncertainty hangs over this journey. We find him again with Paul in Macedonia, 2 Cor. i. 1: but apparently he had not reached Corinth. See 1 Cor. xvi. as above: and 2 Cor. xii. 18, where he would probably have been mentioned, had he done so.—On the difficult question respecting a journey of Paul himself to Corinth during this period, see notes, 2 Cor. xii. 14; xiii. 1,—and Introduction to l Cor.§5.
