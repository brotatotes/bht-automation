 29.   εἰς τὸ θέατρον ] The resort of the populace on occasions of excitement, as Wetst. shews by many instances. So Tacit Hist. ii. 80, ‘Tum Antiochensium theatrum ingressus,  ubi illis consultare mos est .’ ‘Of the site of the theatre, the scene of the tumult raised by Demetrius, there can be no doubt, its ruins being a wreck of immense grandeur. I think it must have been larger than the one at Miletus; and that exceeds any I have elsewhere seen.… Its form alone can now be spoken of, for every seat is removed, and the proscenium is a heap of ruins.’ Fellows, Asia Minor, p. 274. ‘The theatre of Ephesus is said to be the largest known of any that have remained to us from antiquity.’ C. and H. ii. p. 83, note 3.
	 συναρπ .] It is not implied that they seized Gaius and Aristarchus  before they rushed into the theatre: compare προσευξάμενοι εἶπαν , ch. Acts 1:24 , also ch. Acts 18:27 , and Winer, edn. 6, § 45. 6. b.
	 Γάϊον ] A different person from the Gaius of ch. Acts 20:4 , who was of Derbe, and from the Gaius of Romans 16:23 , and 1 Corinthians 1:14 , who was evidently a Corinthian. Aristarchus is mentioned ch. Acts 20:4 ; Acts 27:2 ; Colossians 4:10 ; Philemon 1:24 . He was a native of Thessalonica.
