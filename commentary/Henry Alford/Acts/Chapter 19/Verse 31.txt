<b> 31. certain of the chief of Asia</b>] Literally,<b> of the Asiarchs.</b> These Asiarchs were officers elected by the cities of the province of Asia to preside over their games and religious festivals. Of these it would be natural that the one who for the time presided would bear the title of “<i>the Asiarch:</i>” but no more is known of such presidency. The Asiarch Philip at Smyrna is mentioned by Eusebius as presiding in the amphitheatre at the martyrdom of Polycarp. These Ephesian games in honour of Artemis took place in May, which whole month (another singular coincidence with the practices of idolatrous Christendom) was sacred to, and named<i> Artemisian after</i>, the goddess.
