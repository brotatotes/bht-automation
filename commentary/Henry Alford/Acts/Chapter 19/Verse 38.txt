<p><strong> 38. </strong> <strong> ἀγόραιοι</strong> ] <strong> court-days</strong> (the grammarians distinguish ἀγοραῖος , ‘circumforaneus,’ an idler in the market, and ἀγόραιος , as in our text: so Suidas: but Ammonius <em> vice versâ</em> : and the distinction is now believed to be mere pedantry): and <strong> ἄγονται</strong> implies that they were then actually going on. They were the periodical <em> assizes</em> of the district, held by the proconsul and his <em> assessors</em> (see below). The Latin phrase for ἀγοραίους ἄγειν was <em> conventus agere</em> , or <em> peragere</em> , or <em> convocare</em> ; cf. Cæs [102] B. G. i. 54; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:1">Acts 19:1</span> ; viii. 46. Hence the district itself was called <em> conventus</em> . See Smith’s Dict. of Antiquities, art. Conventus.

<p><strong> ἀνθύπατοι</strong> ] <strong> there are</strong> (such things as) <strong> proconsuls</strong> : the fit officers before whom to bring these causes: a categoric plural. So the Commentators generally. But may not the ‘consiliarii’ of the proconsul who were his assessors at the ‘conventus,’ held in the provinces, have themselves popularly borne the name? We find in Jos. B. J. ii. 16. 1, that Cestius, the ἡγεμών of Syria, on receiving an application respecting Florus’s conduct at Jerusalem, μετὰ ἡγεμόνων ἐβουλεύετο , which ἡγεμόνες were his <em> assessors</em> , or <em> consiliarii</em> . (See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:12">Acts 25:12</span> , and Smith’s Dict. of Antt., ut supra.)
