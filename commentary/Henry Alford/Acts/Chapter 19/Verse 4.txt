 4.   εἰς τ  .   ἐρχ  …   ἵνα π  . ] This peculiar inversion of words, see reff., seems to mark the hand of Paul.  ἵνα does not give (as Meyer) the mere purpose of his baptism (saying that  he baptized in order that …), but combines, as in similar uses of προσεύχομαι ἵνα and the like, the purport and purpose together: ‘He commanded them that they  should (purport) and he spoke to them, that they  might (purpose).’ See this discussed in note on 1 Corinthians 14:13 .
