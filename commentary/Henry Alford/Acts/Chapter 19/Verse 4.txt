<p><strong> 4. </strong> <strong> εἰς τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐρχ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ἵνα π</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This peculiar inversion of words, see reff., seems to mark the hand of Paul. <strong> ἵνα</strong> does not give (as Meyer) the mere purpose of his baptism (saying that <em> he baptized</em> in order that …), but combines, as in similar uses of προσεύχομαι ἵνα and the like, the purport and purpose together: ‘He commanded them that they <em> should</em> (purport) and he spoke to them, that they <em> might</em> (purpose).’ See this discussed in note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:13">1 Corinthians 14:13</span> .</p>
