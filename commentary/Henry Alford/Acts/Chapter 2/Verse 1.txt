<b> 1.</b>]<b> while the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled</b>: “during the progress of that particular day:” necessitated by the pres. tense. In<i> sense</i>, it amounts to ‘<i>when the day of Pentecost was fully come</i>,’ as A.V.<br><br><b> the day of Pentecost</b>] The<i> fiftieth</i><i> day</i> (inclusive) after the sixteenth of Nisan, the second day of the Passover (Levit. xxiii. 16),—called in Exodus xxiii. 16, ‘<i>the feast of harvest</i>,’—in Deut. xvi. 10, ‘<i>the feast of weeks:</i>’—one of the three great feasts, when all the males were required to appear at Jerusalem, Deut. xvi. 16. At this time, it was simply regarded as the feast of harvest: among the later Jews, it was considered as the anniversary of the giving of the law from Sinai. This inference was apparently grounded on a comparison of Exod. xii. 2 and xix. 1. Josephus and Philo know nothing of it, and it is at the best very uncertain. Chrysostom’s reason for the event happening when it did is probably the true one: “It was fitting that this should take place on the recurrence of a feast: that they who had been present at the cross of Christ might see this also.” The question,<i> on what day of the week</i> this day of Pentecost was, is beset with the difficulties attending the question of our Lord’s last passover; see notes on Matt. xxvi. 17, and John xviii. 28. It appears probable however that it was on the Sabbath,—i. e. if we reckon from<i> Saturday, the</i> 16<i> th of Nisan</i>. Wieseler supposes that the Western Church altered the celebration of it to the first day of the week, in conformity with her observance of Easter on that day. If we take the second day of the Passover as<i> Sunday</i>,<i> the</i> 17<i> th of Nisan</i>, which some have inferred from John xviii. 28, the day of Pentecost will fall on the<i> first day</i> of the week.<br><br><b> they were all together in one place</b>] Not the Apostles only, nor the hundred and twenty mentioned ch. i. 15; but<i> all the believers in Christ</i>, then congregated at the time of the feast in Jerusalem. The former is manifest from ver. 14, when Peter and the eleven stand forward and allude to the rest<b> as</b><b> these</b>: and the latter follows on the former being granted. Both are confirmed by the universality of the promise cited by Peter, ver. 17 ff. See Chrysostom below, on ver. 4.<br><br><b> together</b>: the other but not so well supported reading, “<i>with one accord</i>,” implies more, viz. that their<i> purpose</i>, as well as their locality, was the same.<br><br><b> in one place</b>]<i> Where?</i> evidently<i> not in the temple, or any part of it</i>. The improbability of such an assemblage, separate and yet so great, in any of the rooms attached to the temple,—the words “<i>all the house</i>”’ in ver. 2 (where see note),—the notice, that “<i>the multitude came together</i>,” ver. 6,—the absence ot any mention of the temple,—all these are against such a supposition. Obviously no<i> à priori</i> consideration such as Olshausen alleges, that “thus the solemn inauguration of the Church of Christ becomes more imposing by happening in the holy place of the Old Covenant,” can apply to the enquiry. Nor can the statement that they were “<i>continually in the temple</i>,” Luke xxiv. 53, apply here (see above on ch. i. 13); for even if it be assumed that the hour of prayer was come (which it hardly could have been, seeing that some time must have elapsed between the event and Peter’s speech), the disciples would not have been assembled separately, but would, as Peter and John, in ch. iii. 1, have gone up, mingled with the people.
