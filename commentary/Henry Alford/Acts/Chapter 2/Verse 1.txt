<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] <strong> While the day of P. was being fulfilled</strong> : ‘during the progress of that particular day:’ this is necessitated by the pres. tense. In <em> sense</em> , it amounts to ‘ <em> when the day of P. was fully come</em> ,’ as E. V.: <strong> but</strong> not in grammar. Professor Hitzig, in a letter to Ideler, “Ostern und Pflngsten, u.s.w.,” maintains that the meaning is, ‘ <em> As the day of P</em> . <em> drew on,’ ‘was approaching its fulfilment</em> :’ but this view is refuted by Neander, “Pflanzung u. Leitung, u.s.w.,” p. 10, note. Hitzig supports his view by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:5">Acts 2:5</span> , taking κατοικοῦντες to imply <em> constant residence</em> , not merely <em> sojourning on account of the feast</em> , which latter he says would have been specified if it were so. Neander replies, 1. that ἐν τ . συνπλ . τ . ἡ . τ . π . must necessarily mean that the day itself <em> had arrived</em> ; compare πλήρωμα τοῦ χρόνου or τῶν καιρῶν , Gal 4:4 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span> . In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span> , it is not said of <em> the day</em> , but of the <em> days</em> of His being received up, including the whole period introductory to that event: and, by the very same interpretation, <em> the day of</em> P. must in this case <em> have arrived</em> , (and was <em> being accomplished</em> , i.e. in process of passing.) And again, if only the <em> approach</em> of that day were indicated, why should the <em> day itself</em> have been mentioned, seeing that it would then be no way concerned in the narrative? On the propriety of the day itself as belonging to the narrative, see below. 2. It is true that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:5">Acts 2:5</span> , if we had that verse only before us, we should interpret κατοικ . of <em> dwelling</em> , permanently (no real difference being traceable between κατοικεῖν with an accus., and κατοικεῖν ἐν ); but if we compare it with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9">Acts 2:9</span> , we shall see, that the <em> same persons</em> would thus be κατοικοῦντες in Jerusalem and <em> several other localities</em> , which necessarily restricts the meaning, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:5">Acts 2:5</span> , to a <em> temporary sojourn</em> . And, granting that there may have been some <em> residents</em> in Jerusalem among these foreign Jews, the ἐπιδημοῦντες <strong> Ῥωμαῖοι</strong> certainly point to persons who were for some especial reason at Jerusalem at the time, as also the <em> proselytes</em> . And in Act 2:14 Peter distinguishes the ἄνδρες Ἰουδαῖοι , the residents, from οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἱερους . ἅπαντες , the sojourners.

<p><strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῆς π</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The <em> fiftieth day</em> (inclusive) after the sixteenth of Nisan, the second day of the Passover ( Lev 23:16 ), called in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:16">Exodus 23:16</span> , ‘ <em> the feast of harvest</em> ,’ in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+16:10">Deuteronomy 16:10</span> , ‘ <em> the feast of weeks</em> ;’ one of the three great feasts, when all the males were required to appear at Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+16:16">Deuteronomy 16:16</span> . No supplying of ἡμέρας , or ἑορτῆς , is required after πεντηκοστῆς : the word had passed into a proper name, see ref. Tobit, where it is in appos. with ἑορτῇ , and ref. 2 Macc.
	</p>
<p>At this time, it was simply regarded as the feast of harvest: among the later Jews, it was considered as the anniversary of the giving of the law from Sinai. This inference was apparently grounded on a comparison of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:2">Exodus 12:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:1">Exodus 19:1</span> . Josephus and Philo know nothing of it, and it is at the best very uncertain. Chrysostom’s reason for the event happening when it did is probably the true one: ἔδει γὰρ ἑορτῆς οὔσης πάλιν ταῦτα γενέσθαι · ἵνα οἱ παρόντες τῷ σταυρῷ τοῦ χριστοῦ , οὗτοι καὶ ταῦτα ἴδωσιν (in Catena). See a number of other reasons given by Wordsw., more suo. The question, <em> on what day of the week</em> this day of Pentecost was, is beset with the difficulties attending the question of our Lord’s last passover; see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:17">Matthew 26:17</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28">John 18:28</span> . It appears probable however that it was on the Sabbath, i.e. if we reckon from <em> Saturday, the</em> 16 <em> th of Nisan</em> . Wieseler (Chron. des Apostol. Zeitalters, p. 20) supposes that the Western Church altered the celebration of it to the first day of the week in conformity with her observance of Easter on that day. If we take the second day of the Passover as <em> Sunday, the</em> 17 <em> th of Nisan</em> , which some have inferred from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:28">John 18:28</span> , the day of Pentecost will fall on the <em> first day</em> of the week. The custom of the Karaites was, to keep Pentecost always <em> on the first day</em> of the week, reckoning not from the day after the great Passover-Sabbath, but from that <em> following the Sabbath</em> in Passover week understanding הַשַּׁבָּת in Lev 23:15 of the <em> ordinary</em> Sabbath; but this cannot be brought to bear on our enquiry, as it probably arose later.

<p><strong> πάντες</strong> ] Not the Apostles only, nor the hundred and twenty mentioned ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span> ; but <em> all the believers in Christ</em> , then congregated at the time of the feast in Jerusalem. The former is manifest from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:14">Acts 2:14</span> , when Peter and the eleven stand forward and allude to the rest as οὗτοι : and the latter follows on the former being granted. Both are confirmed by the universality of the promise cited by Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:17">Acts 2:17</span> ff. See Chrys. below, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁμοῦ</strong> ] <strong> together</strong> : the rec. ὁμοθυμαδόν implies more, viz. that their <em> purpose</em> , as well as their locality, was the same.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό</strong> ] <em> Where</em> ? evidently <em> not in the temple, or any part of it</em> . The improbability of such an assemblage, separate and yet so great, in any of the rooms attached to the temple, the words ὅλον τὸν οἶκον in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:2">Acts 2:2</span> (where see note), the συνῆλθεν τὸ πλῆθος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:6">Acts 2:6</span> , the absence of any mention of the temple, all these are against such a supposition. Obviously no <em> à priori</em> consideration such as Olshausen alleges (in loc.), that “thus the solemn inauguration of the Church of Christ becomes more imposing by happening in the holy place of the Old Covenant,” can apply to the enquiry. Nor can the statement that they were διὰ παντὸς ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:53">Luke 24:53</span> , apply here (see above on ch. Act 1:13 ); for even if it be assumed that the hour of prayer was come (which it hardly could have been, seeing that some time must have elapsed between the event and Peter’s speech), the disciples would not have been assembled separately, but would, as Peter and John, in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:1">Acts 3:1</span> , have gone up, mingled with the people. See more below.</p>
