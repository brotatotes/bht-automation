 10.  Φρυγίαν ] ἡ μεγάλη φρυγία of Strabo, xii. 8: Jos. Antt. xvi. 2. 2. It was at this time part of the Roman province of Asia.
	 Παμφυλίαν ] A small district, extending along the coast from Olbia (Strabo, xiv. 4), or Phaselis (Plin. Act 2:27 ), to Ptolemais (Strabo, l. c). It was a separate tributary district ( χωρὶς ὅπλων φορολογεῖται , Jos. B. J. ii. 16. 4): we find it classed with Galatia and ruled by the same person, Tac. Hist. ii. 9.
	 Αἴγυπτον ] Having enumerated the principal districts of Asia Minor, the catalogue passes (see above on the arrangement, Act 2:9 ) to Egypt, a well-known habitation of Jews. Two-fifths of the population of Alexandria consisted of them, see Philo, in Flacc. 8, vol. ii. p. 525, and they had an Ethnarch of their own, Jos. Antt. xiv. 7. 2; xix. 5. 2.
	 τὰ μ  .   τ  .   Λιβύης τ  .   κ  .   Κυρήνην ] By this expression is probably meant Pentapolis, where Josephus (Antt. xiv. 7. 2), quoting from Strabo, testifies to the existence of very many Jews, amounting in Cyrene to a fourth part of the whole population. The Cyrenian Jews were so numerous in Jerusalem, that they had a special synagogue (see ch. Act 6:9 ). Several were Christian converts: see ch. Acts 11:20 ; Acts 13:1 .
	 οἱ ἐπιδημοῦντες Ῥωμαῖοι ] ‘The Roman Jews dwelling (or then being) in Jerusalem,’ see ref. The comma after  Ῥωμαῖοι is better retained (against Wordsw.).
	 Ἰουδ  .   τ  .   κ  .   προσήλ .] This refers more naturally to the whole of the past catalogue, than merely to the Roman Jews. The τε καί shews that it does not take up a new designation, but expresses the classes or divisions of those which have gone before. See a similar construction in John 2:15 , where τά τε πρόβατα κ . τοὺς βόας is epexegetic of πάντας preceding.
