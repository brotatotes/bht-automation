<p><strong> 14.</strong> <strong> σὺν τοῖς ἕνδεκα</strong> ] Peter and the eleven come forward from the great body of believers. And he distinguishes (by the οὗτοι in Act 2:15 ) not <em> himself</em> from the <em> eleven</em> , but <em> himself and the eleven</em> from the rest. De Wette concludes from this, that the Apostles <em> had not themselves spoken with tongues</em> , as being an inferior gift (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:18">1 Corinthians 14:18</span> ff.); perhaps too rashly, for this view hardly accords with <strong> ἅπαντες</strong> , which is the subject of the whole of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span> .

<p><strong> ἄνδρες Ἰουδ</strong> .] the Jews, properly so called: native dwellers in Jerus.

<p><strong> οἱ κατ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἱερ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἅπ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , the sojourners ( Act 2:5 ) from other parts. <strong> ἐνωτίσασθε</strong> is a word unknown to good Greek, and belonging apparently to the Alexandrine dialect. Stier quotes ‘inaurire’ from Lactantius (R. der Ap. p. 32, not.).</p>
