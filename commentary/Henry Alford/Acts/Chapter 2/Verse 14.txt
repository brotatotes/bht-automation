<b> 14. with the eleven</b>] Peter and the eleven come forward from the great body of believers. And he distinguishes (by the word “<i>these</i>” in ver. 15) not<i> himself</i> from the<i> eleven</i>, but<i> himself and the eleven</i> from the rest. De Wette concludes from this, that the Apostles<i> had not themselves spoken with tongues</i>, as being an inferior gift (1 Cor. xiv. 18 ff.); perhaps too rashly, for this view hardly accords with the word<b> all</b> which is tho subject of the whole of ver. 4.<br><br><b> men of Judæa</b>] the Jews, properly so called: native dwellers in Jerusalem.<br><br><b> all ye that dwell at Jerusalem</b>] the sojourners (ver. 5) from. other parts.
