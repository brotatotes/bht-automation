 2.   ἦχ  .   ὥσπ  .   φερ  .   πνοῆς βιαίας ] could not be better rendered than in E. V.,  a sound at of a rushing mighty wind . The distinction between πνοῆς and πνεύματος , on which De Wette insists, can hardly be expressed in our language. It is possible that Luke may have used πνοῆς to avoid the concurrence of πνεύματος βιαίου and πνεύματος ἁγίου . It doubtless has its especial propriety; it is the  breathing or  blowing which we hear: it was the sound as of a violent blowing, borne onward, which accompanied the descent of the Holy Spirit. To treat this as a natural phænomenon, even supposing that phænomenon  miraculously produced , as the earthquake at the crucifixion, is contrary to the text, which does not describe it as ἦχος φερομένης πν . βι ., but ἦχος  ὥσπερ φ . πν . βι . It was the  chosen vehicle by which the Holy Spirit was  manifested to their sense of hearing, as by the tongues of fire to their sense of seeing .
	‘  φέρεσθαι ad violentum quo venti moventur impetum notandum adhiberi solet. Æl. Hist. An. vii. 24, ἐπειδὰν τὸ πνεῦμα βίαιον ἐκφέρηται : Diog. Laërt. x. 25. 104, διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος πολλοῦ φερομένου .’ Kypke.
	 οἶκον ] Certainly Luke would not have used this word of a  chamber in the Temple , or of  the Temple itself , without further explanation. Our Lord, it is true, calls the Temple ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν , Matthew 23:38 , and Josephus informs us that Solomon’s Temple was furnished τριάκοντα βραχέσιν οἴκοις , and again ἐπῳκοδόμηντο δὲ τούτοις ἄνωθεν ἕτεροι οἶκοι : but to suppose either usage here, seems to me very far-fetched and unnatural.
