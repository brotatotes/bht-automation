<b> 20.</b>] See Matt. 29.<br><br><b> the... day of the Lord</b>] Not<i> the first coming of Christ</i>,—which interpretation would run counter to the whole tenor of the Apostle’s application of the prophecy but clearly,<i> His second coming</i>: regarded in prophetic language as following close upon the outpouring of the Spirit, because it is the<i> next great event</i> in the divine arrangements.—The Apostles probably expected this coming very soon (see note on Rom. xiii. 11); but this did not at all affect the accuracy of their expressions respecting it. Their days witnessed the Pentecostal effusion, which was<i> the beginning of the signs of the end</i>: then follows the period, KNOWN TO THE FATHER ONLY, of waiting—the Church for her Lord,—the Lord Himself till all things shall haye been put under His feet,—and then<i> the signs shall be renewed</i>, and<i> the day of the Lord shall come</i>. Meantime, and in the midst of these signs, the covenant of the spiritual dispensation is, ver. 21— ‘<i>Whosoever</i> shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.’ The gates of God’s mercy are thrown open in Christ to all people:—no barrier is placed,—<i>no union with any external association or succession required</i>: the promise is to<i> individuals</i>, AS<i> individuals</i>:<b> whosoever</b>: which individual universality, though here, by the nature of the circumstances, spoken within the limits of the outward Israel, is afterwards as expressly asserted of Jew and Gentile, Rom. i. 17, where see note.
