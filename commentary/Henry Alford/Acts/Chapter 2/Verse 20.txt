 20 .] See Matthew 24:29 .
	 ἡμ  .   κυρ .] Not  the first coming of Christ , which interpretation would run counter to the whole tenor of the Apostle’s application of the prophecy: but clearly,  His second coming ; regarded in prophetic language as following close upon the outpouring of the Spirit, because it is the  next great event in the divine arrangements.
	The Apostles probably expected this coming very soon (see note on Rom 13:11 ); but this did not at all affect the accuracy of their expressions respecting it. Their days witnessed the Pentecostal effusion, which was  the beginning of the signs of the end : then follows the period, KNOWN TO THE FATHER ONLY, of waiting the Church for her Lord, the Lord Himself till all things shall have been put under His feet, and then  the signs shall be renewed , and  the day of the Lord shall come . Meantime, and in the midst of these signs, the covenant of the spiritual dispensation is, Acts 2:21 ‘  Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.’ The gates of God’s mercy are thrown open in Christ to all people: no barrier is placed,  no union with any external association or succession required : the promise is to  individuals , AS  individuals :  πᾶς ὃς ἐάν : which individual universality, though here by the nature of the circumstances spoken within the limits of the outward Israel, is afterwards as expressly asserted of Jew and Gentile, Romans 1:17 , where see note.
