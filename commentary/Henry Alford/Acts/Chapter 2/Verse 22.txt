<b> 22. Ye men of Israel</b>] This address binds all the hearers in<i> one term</i>, and that one reminds them of their covenant relation with God: comp. “<i>all the house of Israel</i>,” ver. 36.<br><br><b> of Nazareth</b>] This title does not here seem to be emphatically used by way of contrast to what follows, as some have thought, but only as the ordinary appellation of Jesus by the Jews, see John xviii. 5, 7; ch. xxii. 8; xxvi. 9.<br><br> The words<b> of (by) God</b>, belong to<b> approved</b>, and denote the source whence the proof came.<b> approved</b> must be taken in its fuller and stricter meaning: viz. as importing,—<b>shewn to be</b> that which He claimed to be. The connexion of the passage is, that the Man Jesus of Nazareth was<i> by God</i> demonstrated,<i> by God</i> wrought in among you,<i> by God’s counsel</i> delivered to death,<i> by God</i> raised up (which raising up is argued on till ver. 32, then taken up again),<i> by God</i> (ver. 36), finally, made Lord and Christ. This was the process of argument then with the Jews,—proceeding on the identity of a man whom they had seen and known,—and then mounting up from His works and His death and His resurrection, to<i> His glorification</i>,—all THE PURPOSE AND DOING OF GOD.<br><br><b> which God did by him</b>] This is not, as De Wette characterizes it,<i> a low view of the miracles wrought by Jesus</i>, nor is it inconsistent with John ii. 11; but it is in strict accordance with the progress of our Lord through humiliation to glory, and with His own words in that very Gospel (v. 19), which is devoted to the great subject,<i> the manifestation, by the Father, of the glory of the Son</i>. This side of the subject is here especially dwelt on in argument with these Jews, to exhibit (see above) the whole course of Jesus of Nazareth, as the<i> ordinance and doing of</i> THE GOD OF ISRAEL.
