 24 .] There is some difficulty in explaining the expression  ὠδῖνας in the connexion in which it is here found. The difficulty lies, not in the connexion of λύειν with ὠδῖνας , which is amply justified, see reff., but in the interpretation of ὠδῖνας  here . For ὠδῖνας θαν . must mean  the pains of death , i.e. the pains which precede and end in death; a meaning here inapplicable. (The explanation of Chrys., Theophyl., Œc [29] , ὁ θάνατος ὤδινε κατέχων αὐτόν , κ . τὰ δεινὰ ἔπασχε , will not be generally maintained at the present day. Stier does maintain it, Reden der Apostel, vol. i. p. 43 ff., but to me not convincingly: and, characteristically, Wordsw. also.) The fact may be, that Peter used the Hebrew word חֶבְלֵי , ref. Psa. ‘  nets , or  bands ,’ i.e. the nets in which death held the Lord captive; and that, in rendering the words into Greek, the LXX rendering of the word in that place and Psalms 114:3 , viz. ὠδῖνες , has been adopted. (But see Prolegg. to Vol. I. ch. ii. § ii. pp. 28, 29.) It has been attempted in vain by Olshausen and others to shew that ὠδῖνες sometimes in Hellenistic Greek signifies  bands . No one instance cited by Schleusner (Lex. V. T.) of that meaning is to the point. See Simonis Lex., חבל .
