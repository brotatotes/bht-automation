<b> 29. Brethren</b> (literally “<i>Men, brethren</i>”)] He implies, ‘I am your brother, an Israelite, and therefore would not speak with disrespect of David’ He prepares the way for the apologetic sentence which follows.<br><br> The title ‘Patriarch’ is<i> only here</i> applied to<i> David</i> as the progenitor of the kingly race:—Abraham and the sous of Jacob are so called in ch. vii. 8, 9, and in Heb. vii. 4. In the LXX, the word is used of chief men, and heads of families, with the exception of 2 Chron. xxiii. 20, where it represents “captains of hundreds.” We learn from 1 Kings ii. 10, and Neh. iii. 16, that David was buried at Jerusalem, in the city of David, i.e. the stronghold of Zion, 2 Sam. v. 7.—Josephus gives an account of the high priest, Hyreanus, when besieged by Antiochus Eusebes,—and afterwards King Herod, opening the tomb and taking treasure from it. Dio Cassius mentions, among the prodigies which preceded Hadrian’s war, that the tomb of Solomon (the same with that of David) fell down. Jerome mentions that the tomb of David was visited in his time; i.e. at the end of the fourth century.
