 29.  ἄνδρες ἀδελφοί ]  q. d. , ‘  I am your brother, an Israelite, and therefore would not speak with disrespect of David.’ He prepares the way for the apologetic sentence which follows.
	 ἐξόν ] supply, not ἔστω , but ἐστίν ,  I may , &c.
	The title ‘Patriarch’ is  only here applied to  David , as the progenitor of the kingly race: Abraham and the sons of Jacob are so called in the N. T. reff. In the LXX, the word is used of chief men, and heads of families, with the exception of 2 Chronicles 23:20 , where it represents “captains of hundreds.”
	 ὅτι ] not,  because ; but  that , contains the subject of εἰπεῖν , and is that for which the apology is made.
	We learn from 1 Kings 2:10 , and Nehemiah 3:16 , that David was buried at Jerusalem, in the city of David, i.e. the stronghold of Zion, 2 Samuel 5:7 .
	Josephus, Antt. vii. 15. 3, gives an account of the high priest Hyrcanus, when besieged by Antiochus Eusebes, and afterwards King Herod, opening the tomb and taking treasure from it. See also xiii. 8. 4; xvi. 7. 1; B. J. i. 2. 5. Dio Cassius (lxix. 14) mentions, among the prodigies which preceded Hadrian’s war, that the tomb of Solomon (the same with that of David, see Jos. Antt. xvi. 7. 1) fell down. Jerome mentions (Epist. xlvi. (xvii.) ad Marcellam, vol. i. p. 209) that the tomb of David was visited in his time (the end of the fourth century).
