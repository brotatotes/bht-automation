<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> ὤφθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτοῖς</strong> ] not, ‘ <em> there were seen on them</em> ,’ as Luther; but, as E. V., <strong> there appeared unto them</strong> .
	</p>
<p><strong> διαμεριζόμεναι</strong> ] not, ‘ <em> distributed</em> ,’ as μερισμοῖς in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span> ; from the construction, διαμ . must refer to something characteristic, not of the <em> manner of apportionment</em> , but of the <em> appearance itself</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὡσεὶ πυρός</strong> ] see reff. They were <em> not</em> πυρός , as not possessing the burning power of fire, but only <strong> ὡσεὶ</strong> πυρός , <em> in appearance like that element</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐκάθισεν</strong> ] viz. τὸ φαινόμενον : not τὸ πνεῦμα , nor ἡ γλῶσσα , but the <em> appearance</em> described in the preceding clause. I understand ἐκάθ . as usually interpreted, <strong> lighted on their heads</strong> . This also was no effect of natural cause, either ordinarily or extraordinarily employed: see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:2">Acts 2:2</span> .</p>
