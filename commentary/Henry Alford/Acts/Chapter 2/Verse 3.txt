 3.   ὤφθ  .   αὐτοῖς ] not, ‘  there were seen on them ,’ as Luther; but, as E. V.,  there appeared unto them .
	 διαμεριζόμεναι ] not, ‘  distributed ,’ as μερισμοῖς in Hebrews 2:4 ; from the construction, διαμ . must refer to something characteristic, not of the  manner of apportionment , but of the  appearance itself .
	 ὡσεὶ πυρός ] see reff. They were  not πυρός , as not possessing the burning power of fire, but only  ὡσεὶ πυρός ,  in appearance like that element .
	 ἐκάθισεν ] viz. τὸ φαινόμενον : not τὸ πνεῦμα , nor ἡ γλῶσσα , but the  appearance described in the preceding clause. I understand ἐκάθ . as usually interpreted,  lighted on their heads . This also was no effect of natural cause, either ordinarily or extraordinarily employed: see on Acts 2:2 .
