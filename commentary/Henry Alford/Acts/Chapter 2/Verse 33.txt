The very expression,<b> shed forth</b>, refers to “<i>I will pour out</i>” above, ver. 17 (in the original they are the same word).<br><br><b> this</b>: i.e. ‘this influence,’<b> this</b> merely; leaving to his hearers the inference that<i> this</i>, which they saw and heard, must be none other than the promised effusion of the Spirit.<br><br><b> which ye now see</b> need not imply, as Dr. Burton thinks, that “there was some visible appearance, which the people saw as well as the apostles:”—very much of the<i> effect</i> of the descent of the Spirit would be<i> visible</i>,—the enthusiasm and gestures of the speakers, for instance; not, however, the tongues of flame,—for then none could have spoken as in ver. 13.
