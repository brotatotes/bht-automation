<p><strong> 36</strong> .] THE CONCLUSION FROM ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID.
	</p>
<p><strong> πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσρ</strong> . = πᾶς ὁ οἶκ . Ἰσρ ., οἶκος being a familiar noun used anarthrously: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span> , note, and Winer, edn. 6, § 19, who however does not give οἶκος in his list: <strong> the whole house of Israel</strong> for all hitherto said has gone upon proofs and sayings belonging to <em> Israel</em> , and to <em> all</em> Israel.
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁ θεὸς ἐποίησεν</strong> , as before, is the ground-tone of the discourse.
	</p>
<p><strong> κύριον</strong> , from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:34">Acts 2:34</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> χριστόν</strong> , in the full and glorious sense in which that term was prophetically known. The same is expressed ch. Act 5:31 by ἀρχηγὸν κ . σωτῆρα ὕψωσεν .
	</p>
<p>The final clause sets in the strongest and plainest light the fact to which the discourse testifies ending with <strong> ὃν ὑμεῖς ἐσταυρώσατε</strong> , the remembrance most likely to carry compunction to their hearts. ‘In clausula orationis iterum illis exprobrat quod Eum crucifixerint, ut majori conscientiæ dolore tacti ad remedium aspirent.’ Calvin in loc. ‘Aculeus in fine.’ Bengel.</p>
