<b> 36.</b>] THE CONCLUSION FROM ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID. The Apostle says,<b> let all the house of Israel know</b>, because all hitherto said has gone upon proofs and sayings belonging to<i> Israel</i>, and to<i> all</i> Israel. In the words<b> God hath made</b>, we have as before, the ground-tone of the whole discourse.<br><br><b> Lord</b>, from ver. 34.<br><br><b> Christ</b>, in the full and glorious sense in which that, term was prophetically known. The same is expressed in ch. v. 31 by “<i>hath exalted</i> [<i>to be</i>]<i> a Prince and a Saviour</i>.”—The final clause sets in the strongest and plainest light the fact to which the discourse testifies—ending with<b> whom ye crucified</b>,—the remembrance most likely to carry compunction to their hearts. “In the close of his discourse, he again reproaches them with His crucifixion, that they may be touched with the greater compunction of conscience, and may be eager to seek the remedy for their sin.” Calvin. Bengel calls this “the sting at the end” of the discourse.
