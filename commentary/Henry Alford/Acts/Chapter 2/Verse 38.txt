 38. ]  μετανοήσατε , not, as in Matthew 3:2 ; Matthew 4:17 , μετανοεῖτε . The aorist denotes  speed , a definite, sudden act: the present, a habit, more gradual, as that first moral and legal change would necessarily be. The word imports  change of mind ; here, change from thinking Jesus an impostor, and scorning Him as one crucified, to being baptized in His name, and looking to Him for remission of sins, and the gift of the Spirit.
	The miserable absurdity of rendering μεταν ., or ‘pœnitentiam agite,’ by ‘  do penance ,’ or understanding it as referring to a  course of external rites , is well exposed by this passage in which the  internal change of heart and purpose is insisted on, to be testified by admission into the number of Christ’s followers. See Calvin’s note.
	 βαπτισθήτω ] Here, on the day of Pentecost, we have the first mention and administration of CHRISTIAN BAPTISM. Before, there had been the  baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, by John, Luke 3:3 ; but now we have the important addition ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόμ . Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ ,  on the Name i.e.  on the confession of that which the Name implies, and  into the benefits and blessings which the Name implies. The Apostles and first believers were  not thus baptized , because, ch. Acts 1:5 , they had received the BAPTISM BY THE HOLY GHOST, the  thing signified , which superseded that by water, the  outward and visible sign .
	The  result of the baptism to which he here exhorts them, preceded by repentance and accompanied by faith in the forgiveness of sins in Christ, would be, the  receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit .
