Repent</b>] The word imports<i> change of mind</i>: here, change from thinking Jesus an impostor, and scorning Him as ore crucified, to being baptized in His name, and looking to Him for remission of sins, and the gift of the Spirit.—The miserable absurdity of rendering this word by<i> ‘do penance</i>,’—so the Rheims (Roman-Catholic) Version,—or understanding it as referring to a<i> course of external rites</i>, is well exposed by this passage—in which the<i> internal change of heart and purpose</i> is insisted on, to be testified by admission into the nnmber of Christ’s followers.<br><br><b> be baptized every one of you</b>] Here, on the day of Pentecost, we have the first mention and administration of CHRISTIAN BAPTISM.
