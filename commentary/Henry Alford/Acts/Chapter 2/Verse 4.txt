<b> 4.</b>] On the word<b> all</b>, Chrysostom says, “The Evangelist would not have said<i> all</i>, the Apostles being there, had not the rest also been partakers.”<br><br><b> began to speak with other tongues</b>] There can be no question in any unprejudiced mind, that the fact which this narrative sets before us is, that the disciples began to<i> speak in</i> VARIOUS LANGUAGES, viz.<i> the languages of the nations below enumerated, and perhaps others</i>. All attempts to evade this are connected with some forcing of the text, or some far-fetched and indefensible explanation. This then being laid down, several important questions arise, and we are surrounded by various difficulties. (1) Was this speaking in various languages a<i> gift</i><i> bestowed</i> on the disciples<i> for their use afterwards</i>, or was it a<i> mere sign</i>, their utterance being only us they were mouth-pieces of the Holy Spirit?<i> The latter seems certainly to have been the case</i>. It appears on our narrative,<b> even as the Spirit gave them utterance</b>. But, it may be objected, in that case they would not themselves understand what they said. I answer, that we infer<i> this very fact</i> from 1 Cor. xiv.; that the speaking with tongues was often found,<i> where none could interpret what was said</i>. And besides, it would appear from Peter’s speech, that such, or something approaching to it, was the case in this instance. He makes no allusion to the<i> things said</i> by those who spoke with tongues; the<i> hearers alone</i> speak of their declaring<i> the wonderful works of God</i>. So that it would seem that here, as on other occasions (1 Cor. xiv. 22), tongues were for a sign, not to those that believe, but to those that believe not. If the first supposition be made, that the gift of speaking in various languages was bestowed on the disciples<i> for their after-use in preaching the Gospel</i>, we are, I think, running counter to the whole course of Scripture and the evidence of the early fathers on the subject. There is<i> no trace whatever</i> of such a power being po cd or exercised by the Apostles (see ch. xiv. 11, 14) or by those who followed them. I believe, therefore, the event related in our text to have been a<i> sudden and powerful inspiration of the Holy Spirit, by which the disciples uttered, not of their own minds, but as mouth-pieces of the Spirit, the praises of God in various languages, hitherto, and possibly at the time itself, unknown to them.</i> (2) How is this “<i>speaking with other tongues</i>” related to the “<i>speaking with tongues</i>” (or, “<i>with a tongue</i>”) afterwards spoken of by St. Paul? I answer, that they are<i> one and the same thing</i>. See this further proved in notes on 1 Cor. xiv. Meantime I may remark, that the two are inseparably connected by the following links,—ch. x. 46, xi. 15,—xix. 6,—in which last we have the same juxta-position of<i> speaking with tongues</i> and<i> prophesying</i> as afterwards in 1 Cor. xiv. 1–5 ff. (3)<i> Who were those that partook of this gift?</i> I answer, the<i> whole assembly</i> of believers, from Peter’s application of the prophecy, vv. 16 ff. It was precisely the case supposed in 1 Cor. xiv. 23. The unlearned and unbelievers of that passage were represented by the<b> others</b> of our ver. 13, who pronounced them to be drunken, (4) I would not conceal the difficulty which our minds find in conceiving a person supernaturally endowed with the power of speaking,<i> ordinarily and consciously</i>, a language which he has never learned. But there is to my mind<i> no such difficulty</i>, in conceiving a man to be moved to utterance of sounds<i> dictated by the Holy Spirit</i>. And the fact is clearly laid down by St. Paul, that the gift of<i> speaking</i> in tongues, and that of<i> interpreting</i>, were<i> wholly distinct</i>. So that the above difficulty finds no place here, nor even in the case of a person<i> both speaking and interpreting</i>: see 1 Cor. xiv. 13.—On the question whether the speaking was necessarily<i> always</i> in a foreign tongue, we have no data to guide us: it would seem that it<i> was</i>; but the conditions would not<i> absolutely</i> exclude rhapsodical and unintelligible utterance. Only there is this objection to it: clearly, languages<i> were spoken</i> on<i> this</i> occasion,—and we have no reason to believe that there were two distinct kinds of the gift. (5) It would be quite beyond the limits of a note to give any adequate history of the explanations of the passage. A very short summary must suffice. (<i>a</i>) The idea of a gift of<i> speaking in various languages</i> having been conferred<i> for the dissemination of the Gospel</i>, appears not to have originated, until the<i> gift of tongues</i> itself had some time disappeared from the Church. Chrysostom adopts it, and the great majority of the Fathers and expositors. (<i>b</i>) Some, both in ancient and in modern times, have supposed that the miracle consisted in the multitude<i> hearing</i><i> in various languages</i> that which the believers spoke in their native tongue: that<i> one language was spoken, but many were heard</i>. To this it may be replied, as is done by Gregory Nazianzen, that “thus the miracle would be wrought, not on the speakers, but on the hearers.” ‘This view, besides, would make a distinction between this instance of the gift and those subsequently related, which we have seen does not exist. On the courses taken by the modern German expositors, see note in my Greek Test.<br><br><b> even as</b> (i. e. ‘<i>in such measure and manner in each case as</i>’)<b> the Spirit granted to them to speak</b> (bestowed on them utterance)] The words rendered<b> gave them utterance</b> have been supposed here to imply that they uttered short ejaculatory sentences of praise. But this seems to be unfounded: and our word to<i> utter</i>, to<i> speak out</i>, seems exactly to render it. Their utterance was none of their own, but the simple gift and inspiration of the Holy Spirit: see above.
