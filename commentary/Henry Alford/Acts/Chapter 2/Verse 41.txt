<b> 41.</b>] This<i> first baptism of regeneration</i> is important on many accounts in the history of the Christian Church. It presents us with two remarkable features: (1) It was conferred,<i> on the profession of repentance, and faith in Jesus as the Christ</i>. There was<i> no instruction in doctrine</i> as yet. The infancy of the Church in this respect corresponded to the infancy of the individual mind; the simplicity of faith came first,â€”the ripeness of knowledge followed. Neander well observes that, among such a multitude, admitted by a confession which allowed of so wide an interpretation, were probably many persons who brought into the church the seeds of that Judaizing form of Christianity which afterwards proved so hostile to the true faith; while others, more deeply touched by the Holy Spirit, followed humbly the unfolding of that teaching by which He perfected the apostolic age in the doctrine of Christ. (2) Almost without doubt, this first baptism must have been administered, as that of the first Gentile converts was (see ch. x. 47, and note), by<i> affusion</i> or<i> sprinkling</i>,<i> not by immersion</i>. The immersion of 3000 persons, in a city so sparingly furnished with water as Jerusalem, is equally inconceivable with a procession beyond the walls to the Kedron, or to Siloam, for that purpose.
