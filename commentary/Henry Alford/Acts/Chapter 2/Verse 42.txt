<b> 42.] the apostles’ doctrine</b>: compare Matt. xxviii 20.<br><br><b> and in community]</b> The living together as one family, and having things in common. It is no objection to this meaning, that the fact is<i> repeated</i> below, in ver. 45: for so is the<i> breaking of bread</i> in ver. 46, and the continuing in prayers. The meaning given in the A.V., “<i>in the Apostles’ fellowship</i>,” is not objectionable in itself, but still I conceive bears no meaning defensible in construction. See further in my Greek Test.<br><br><b> breaking of bread]</b> or,<b> the breaking of the bread</b>. This has been very variously explained. Chrysostom, “In mentioning<b> bread</b> here he seems to me to signify<i> fasting</i>, and ascetic life: for they partook, not of luxuries, but simply of subsistence” And similarly Bengel: “The breaking of bread, that is, a frugal diet, common among them all.” But on ver. 46 he recognizes a covert allusion to the Eucharist.—The interpretation of the<b> breaking of bread</b> here as<i> the celebration of the Lord's supper</i> has been, both in ancient and modern times, the prevalent one. Chrysostom himself, in another place, interprets it, or at all events the whole phrase, of the Holy Communion. And the Romanist interpreters have gone so far as to ground an argument on the passage for the administration<i> in one kind only</i>. But,—referring for a fuller discussion of the whole matter to the notes on 1 Cor. x. xi,—barely to render<b> [the] breaking of [the] bread</b> to mean the breaking of bread in the Eucharist, as<i> now understood</i>, would be to violate historical truth. The Holy Communion was at first, and for some time, till abuses put an end to the practice,<i> inseparably connected with the agapæ</i>, or<i> love-feasts</i>, of the Christians, and<i> unknown as a separate ordinance</i>. To these agapæ, accompanied as they were at this time by the celebration of the Lord’s supper, the “<i>breaking of [the] bread</i>” refers,—from the custom of the master of the feast breaking bread in asking a blessing; see ch. xxvii. 35, where the Eucharist is out of the question.<br><br><b> in prayers] or, in the prayers:—the ap-pointed times of prayer</b>: see ver. 46. But it need not altogether exclude<i> prayer among themselves</i> as well, provided we do not assume any set times or forms of<i> Christian worship</i>, which certainly did not exist as yet.
