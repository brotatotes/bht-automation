<b> 44.]</b> If it surprise us that so large a number should be continually assembled together (for such is certainly the sense of<b> were together</b>, not that they were joined by brotherly love, as Calvin)—we must remember that#large portion of the three thousand were persons who had come up to Jerusalem for the feast, and would by this time have returned to their homes.<br><br><b> and had all things (in) common]</b> i.e.<i> no individual property, but one common stock:</i> see ch. iv. 32. That this was literally the case with the infant church at Jerusalem, is too plainly asserted in these passages to admit of a doubt. Some have supposed the expressions to indicate merely a partial community of goods: contrary to the express assertion of ch. iv. 32. In order, however, rightly to understand this community, we may remark:<br><br> (1)<i> it is only Sound in the church at Jerusalem</i>. No trace of its existence is discoverable any where else: on the contrary, St. Paul speaks constantly of the rich and the poor, see 1 Tim. vi. 17; Gal. ii. 10; 2 Cor. viii. 13, 15; ix. 6, 7; 1 Cor, xvi. 2: also St. James, ii, 1–5; iv. 18.—And from the practice having at first prevailed at Jerusalem, we may partly perhaps explain tho great and constant poverty of that church, Rom. xv. 25, 26; 1 Cor 1–3; 2 Cor. viii. also ch, xi. 30; xxiv. 17.—'The non-establishment of this<i> community</i> elsewhere may have arisen from the inconveniences which were found to attend it in Jerusalem: see ch. vi, 1.<br><br> (2) This community of goods was not, even in Jerusalem, enforced by<i> rule</i>, evident from ch. v. 4 (xii. 12), but, originating in free-will, became perhaps an understood custom, still however in the power of any individual not to comply with,<br><br> (3) It was not (as Grotins thought)<i> borrowed from the sect of the Essenes</i>, with whom the Apostles, who certainly must have sanctioned this community, do not appear historieally to have had any connexion.<br><br> But (4) it is much more probable that it arose from a<i> continuation</i>, and application to the now increased number of disciples,<i> of the community in which our Lord and His Apostles had lived</i> (see John xii, 6; xiii. 29)<i> before</i>.—The practice probably did not long continue even at Jerusalem; see Rom. xv. 26, note.
