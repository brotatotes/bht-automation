The words need not mean, though they <em> may</em> mean, that they were assembled in Solomon’s porch, as in ch.

<p><strong> κατ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> οἶκον</strong> ] <em> domi</em> , ‘privatim’ (Beng.), as contrasted with ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ . So also Wolf, Scal., Heinr., Olsh., Meyer, De Wette: not, <em> domatim</em> , ‘from house to house,’ as Erasm., Salmasius, Kuinoel, al.: the words <em> may</em> bear that meaning (see Luk 8:1 ), but we have no trace of such a practice, of holding the ἀγάπαι successively at different houses.

<p>The κλάσις τ . ἄρτου took place at their <em> house of meeting</em> , wherever that was: cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:12">Acts 12:12</span> ; and see Act 2:42 note.

<p><strong> ἀφελότητι</strong> ] In good Greek, ἀφέλεια : the adj. ἀφελής (see Palm and Rost) originally implying “free from stones or rocks” ( ἀ , φελλεύς , stony or rocky land), and thus <em> simple, even, pure</em> .</p>
