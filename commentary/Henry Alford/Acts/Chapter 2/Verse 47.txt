<b> 47.]</b> praising God does not seem only to refer to<i> giving thanks at their partaking of food</i>, but to their general manner of conversation, including the recurrence of special ejaculations and songs of praise by the influence of the Spirit.<br><br><b> more that were in the way of salvation</b>: compare the Apostle’s command, ver. 40;—<b>those who were being saved</b>. Nothing is implied by this word, to answer one way or the other the question, whether all these<i> were finally saved</i>. It is only asserted, that they were<i> in the way of salvation</i> when they were added to the Christian assembly. Doubtless, some of them might have been of the class alluded to Heb. x. 26–29: at least there is nothing in this word to preclude it.
