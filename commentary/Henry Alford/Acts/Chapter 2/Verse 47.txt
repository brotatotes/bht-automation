 47 .]  αἰνοῦντες τ  .   θ  . does not seem only to refer to  giving thanks at their partaking of food , but to their general manner of conversation, including the recurrence of special ejaculations and songs of praise by the influence of the Spirit.
	 τοὺς σωζομένους ]  those who were in the way of salvation: compare σώθητε , Acts 2:40 ;  those who were being saved . Nothing is implied by this word, to answer one way or the other the question, whether all these  were finally saved . It is only asserted, that they were  in the way of salvation when they were added to the Christian assembly. Doubtless, some of them might have been of the class alluded to Hebrews 10:26-29 ; at least there is nothing in this word to preclude it.
	Correct criticism, as well as external evidence, requires that the words ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ or τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ should be rejected, as having been an explanatory gloss, (‘est hæc Chrysostomi, ut videtur, glossa, per Syrum et alios propagata;’ Bengel,) and ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό brought back to its place and the meaning which it bears in this passage (see Act 2:44 ), viz.  together , in the sense of making up  one sum , one body assembled in one place. Meyer attributes the separation of ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό from Πέτρος to an ecclesiastical portion having begun ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις Π . κ . Ἰω . as D. De Wette asks,  why should those words have been inserted at the beginning of a portion? Perhaps in accordance with a not uncommon practice of opening an ecclesiastical lection with such a phrase. Or possibly, I might suggest, as a  mistaken interpretation of ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό , which was not understood. Then when ἐπ . τ . αὐ . became joined to Πέτρος , τῇ ἐκκλ . would naturally be supplied after προσετίθει .
