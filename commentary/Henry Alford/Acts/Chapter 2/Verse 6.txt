<b> 6.</b>] Whatever<b> this sound</b> (literally,<b> voice</b>) may mean, one thing is clear,—that it<i> cannot</i> mean, ‘<i>this rumour</i>’ ( ‘<i>when this was noised abroad</i>,’ A.V.): which would be unexampled. We have then to choose between two things to which the word<b> voice</b>, or<b> sound</b>, might refer:— (1) the “<i>sound as of a mighty rushing wind</i>” of ver. 2, which would hardly be used of a speaking which was<i> still going on</i> when the multitude assembled;—and (2)<i> the speaking with tongues</i> of ver. 4. To<i> this</i> reference, besides the objection just stated, there is also another, that the voices of a number of men, especially when diverse as in this case, would not be indicated by the singular number,<b> voice</b>, but by<i> voices</i>: comp. St. Luke’s own usage, even when the voices cried out<i> the same thing</i>, Luke xxiii. 23, “They were instant with loud<i> voices</i>, requiring that he might be crucified. And the<i> voices</i> of them and of the chief priests prevailed.” And when he uses the singular, he explains it, as in ch. xix. 34, “All with one voice... cried out.” So that we may safely decide for the<i> former reference</i>. The<i> noise of the rushing mighty wind</i> was heard over all the neighbourhood, probably over all Jerusalem.
