<p><strong> 6</strong> .] Whatever <strong> τῆς φωνῆς ταύτης</strong> may mean, one thing is clear, that it <em> cannot</em> mean, ‘ <em> this rumour’ (‘when this was noised abroad</em> ,’ E. V.: so also Erasm., Calv., Beza, Grotius, &amp;c.), which would be unexampled (the two passages cited for this sense from the LXX are no examples; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+45:16">Genesis 45:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+27:0">Jeremiah 27:0</span> :(50) 46). We have then to choose between two things to which φωνή might refer: (1) the ἦχος or <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:2">Acts 2:2</span> , to which it seems bound by the <em> past</em> part. <strong> γενομένης</strong> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:2">Acts 2:2</span> , ἐγένετο … ἦχος ), which would hardly be used of a speaking which was <em> still going on</em> when the multitude assembled: compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:8">John 3:8</span> ; and (2) <em> the speaking with tongues</em> of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span> . To <em> this</em> reference, besides the objection just stated, there is also another, that the voices of a number of men, especially when diverse as in this case, would not be indicated by φωνή , but by φωναί : compare Luke’s own usage, even when the voices cried out the same thing, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:23">Luke 23:23</span> , οἱ δὲ ἐπέκειντο <strong> φωναῖς μεγάλαις</strong> αἰτούμενοι αὐτόν σταυρωθῆναι , καὶ κατίσχυον <strong> αἱ φωναὶ</strong> αὐτῶν . And when he uses the sing., he explains it, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:34">Acts 19:34</span> , φωνὴ ἐγένετο μία ἐκ πάντων . So that we may safely decide for the <em> former reference</em> . The <em> noise of the rushing mighty wind</em> was heard over all the neighbourhood, probably over all Jerusalem.

On these latter words see above on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:4">Acts 2:4</span> . Each one heard λαλούντων αὐτῶν , i.e. either <em> various disciples speaking various tongues, each in some one only</em> : or <em> the same persons speaking now one now another tongue</em> . The former is more probable, although the latter seems to agree with some expressions in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:0">1 Corinthians 14:0</span> , e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:18">Acts 2:18</span> (in the rec. and perhaps even in the present text).
