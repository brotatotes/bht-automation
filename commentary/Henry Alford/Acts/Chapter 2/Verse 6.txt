 6 .] Whatever  τῆς φωνῆς ταύτης may mean, one thing is clear, that it  cannot mean, ‘  this rumour’ (‘when this was noised abroad ,’ E. V.: so also Erasm., Calv., Beza, Grotius, &c.), which would be unexampled (the two passages cited for this sense from the LXX are no examples; Genesis 45:16 ; Jeremiah 27:0 :(50) 46). We have then to choose between two things to which φωνή might refer: (1) the ἦχος or Acts 2:2 , to which it seems bound by the  past part.  γενομένης (compare Acts 2:2 , ἐγένετο … ἦχος ), which would hardly be used of a speaking which was  still going on when the multitude assembled: compare also John 3:8 ; and (2)  the speaking with tongues of Acts 2:4 . To  this reference, besides the objection just stated, there is also another, that the voices of a number of men, especially when diverse as in this case, would not be indicated by φωνή , but by φωναί : compare Luke’s own usage, even when the voices cried out the same thing, Luke 23:23 , οἱ δὲ ἐπέκειντο  φωναῖς μεγάλαις αἰτούμενοι αὐτόν σταυρωθῆναι , καὶ κατίσχυον  αἱ φωναὶ αὐτῶν . And when he uses the sing., he explains it, as in ch. Acts 19:34 , φωνὴ ἐγένετο μία ἐκ πάντων . So that we may safely decide for the  former reference . The  noise of the rushing mighty wind was heard over all the neighbourhood, probably over all Jerusalem.

On these latter words see above on Acts 2:4 . Each one heard λαλούντων αὐτῶν , i.e. either  various disciples speaking various tongues, each in some one only : or  the same persons speaking now one now another tongue . The former is more probable, although the latter seems to agree with some expressions in 1 Corinthians 14:0 , e.g. Acts 2:18 (in the rec. and perhaps even in the present text).
