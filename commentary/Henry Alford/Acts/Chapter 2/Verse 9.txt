<b> 9. Parthians</b>] The catalogue proceeds from the N.E. to the W. and S. Mede notices, that it follows the order of the three great dispersions of the Jews, the Chaldæan, Asyrian, and Egyptian.<br><br><b> Medes</b>] Media, W. of Parthia and Hyreania, S. of the Caspian sea, E. of Armenia, N. of Persia.<br><br><b> Elamites</b>] in pure Greek, Elymæans, inhabitants of Elam or Elymais, a Semitic people (Gen. x. 22). Elam is mentioned in connexion with Babylon, Gen. xiv. 1; with Media, Isa. xxi. 2; Jer. xxv. 25; with, or as part of, Assyria, Ezek. xxxii. 24; Isa. xxii. 6; as a province of Persia, Ezra iv. 9; as the province in which Susan was situated, Dan. viii. 2. According to Josephus, the Elamæans were the progenitors of the Persians. We find scattered hordes under this name far to the north, and even on the Orontes near the Caspian.<br><br><b> Mesopotamia</b>] the well-known district between the Euphrates and Tigris, so called merely as distinguishing its geographical position, between the rivers (so the word imports in Greek): it never formed a state. The name does not appear to be older than the Macedonian conquests. The word is used by the LXX and A.V. in Gen. xxiv. 10 to express the Hebrew “<i>Aram Naharaim</i>,”<i> Aram of the two rivers</i>.<br><br><b> Judæa</b>] I can see no difficulty in Judæa being here mentioned. ‘The catalogue does not proceed by<i> languages</i>, but by territorial division; and Judæa lies immediately S. of its path from Mesopotamia to Cappadocia. It is not Jews by birth and domicile, but<b> devout men</b> who are spoken of; the<b> dwellers in Judæa</b> settled in Judæa. And even if born Jews were meant, doubtless they also would find a place among those who heard in their mother tongue the wonderful works of God.<br><br><b> Cappadocia</b>] At this time (since the year of Rome 770) a Roman province embracing Cappadocia proper and Armenia minor.<br><br><b> Pontus</b>] the former kingdom of Mithridates, lying along the S. coast of the Euxine (whence its name, from the Pontus Euxinus, the Euxine Sea) from the river Halys to Colehis and Armenia, and separated by mountains from Cappadocia on the S. It was at this time divided into petty principalities under Roman protection, but subsequently became a province under Nero.<br><br><b> Asia</b>] i.e. here<i> Asia proper</i>, or rather the W. division of it, as described by Pliny, as bounded on the E. by Phrygia and Lycaonia, on the W. by the Ægean, on the S. by the Egyptian sea, on the N. by Paphlagonia. Ephesus was its chief city. See ch. xvi. 6, where the same appears to be intended.
