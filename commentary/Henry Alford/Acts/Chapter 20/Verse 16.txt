<b> 16. Paul had determined</b>] We see here that the ship was at Paulâ€™s disposal, and probably hired at Philippi, or rather at Neapolis, for the voyage to Patara (ch. xxi. 1), where he and his company embark in a merchant vessel, going to Tyre. The separation of Paul and Luke from the rest at the beginning of the voyage may have been in some way connected with the hiring or outfit of this vessel. The expression<b> he had determined</b> is too subjectively strong to allow of our supposing that the Apostle merely followed the previously determined course of a ship in which he took a passage.
