<b> 17.</b>] The distance from Miletus to Ephesus is about thirty miles. He probably, therefore, stayed three or four days altogether at Miletus.<br><br><b> the elders</b>] called, ver. 28,<b> bishops</b>. This circumstance began very early to contradict the growing views of the apostolic institution and necessity of prelatical episcopacy. Thus Irenæus (Cent. 2), “He called together at Miletus the<i> bishops and presbyters</i> (elders), who came from Ephesus and the rest of the churches near.” Here we see (1) the two,<i> bishops and presbyters</i>, distinguished, as if<i> both</i> were sent for, in order that the titles might not seem to belong to the same persons,—and (2) other neighbouring churches also brought in, in order that there might not seem to be<i> bishops</i> in one church only. That neither of these was the case, is clearly shewn by the plain words of this verse: “he sent<i> to Ephesus</i>, and summoned the<i> elders of the church</i>.” So early did interested and disingenuous interpretations begin to cloud the light which Scripture might have thrown on ecclesiastical questions. The A.V. has hardly dealt fairly in this case with the sacred text, in rendering the designation<i> episcopous</i>, ver. 28, ‘<i>overseers</i>:’ whereas it ought there, as in all other places, to have been bishops, that the fact of<i> elders and bishops having been originally and apostolically synonymous</i> might be apparent to the ordinary English reader, which now it is not.
