This circumstance began very early to contradict the growing views of the apostolic institution and necessity of prelatical episcopacy. Thus Irenæus, iii. 14. 2, p. 201: ‘In Mileto convocatis <em> episcopis et presbyteris</em> , qui erant ab Epheso <em> et a reliquis proximis civitatibus</em> .’ Here we see (1) the two, bishops and presbyters, distinguished, as if <em> both</em> were sent for, in order that the titles might not seem to belong to the same persons, and (2) other neighbouring churches also brought in, in order that there might not seem to be ἐπίσκοποι in one church only. That neither of these was the case, is clearly shewn by the plain words of this verse: he sent <em> to Ephesus</em> , and summoned <em> the elders of the church</em> (see below on διῆλθον , Act 20:25 ). So early did interested and disingenuous interpretations begin to cloud the light which Scripture might have thrown on ecclesiastical questions. The E. V. has hardly dealt fairly in this case with the sacred text, in rendering ἐπισκόπους , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span> , ‘ <em> overseers</em> ;’ whereas it ought there as in all other places to have been <strong> bishops</strong> , that the fact of <em> elders and bishops having been originally and apostolically synonymous</em> might be apparent to the ordinary English reader, which now it is not.</p>
