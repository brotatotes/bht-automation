It is a treasure-house of words, idioms, and sentiments, peculiarly belonging to the Apostle himself. See this shewn in my Greek Test. The contents of the speech may be thus given:<i> He reminds the elders of his conduct among them</i> (vv. 18–21):<i> announces to them his final separation from them</i> (vv. 22–25):<i> and commends earnestly to them the flock committed to their charge, for which he himself had by word and work disinterestedly laboured</i> (vv. 26–35).<br><br><b> from the first day</b>] These words hold a middle place, partly with “<i>ye know</i>,” partly with “<i>after what man-ner I was with you</i>.” The knowledge on their part was coextensive with his whole stay among them: so that we may take the words with<b> ye know</b>, at the same time carrying on their sense to what follows.<br><br><b> I was with you</b>] So 1 Thess. i. 5, ii. 10. See 1 Cor. ix. 20, 22.
