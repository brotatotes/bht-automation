 22.   δεδεμένος τῷ πνεύματι ]  bound in my spirit . This interpretation is most probable, both from the construction, and from the usage of the expression τὸ πνεῦμα repeatedly by and of Paul in the sense of  his own spirit . See ch. reff., where the principal instances are given. The dative, as here, is found Romans 12:11 , τῷ πν . ζέοντες , 1 Corinthians 5:3 , παρὼν τῷ πνεύμ . ( 1Co 14:15-16 ?), 2 Corinthians 2:13 , οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πν . μου , and al., see also ch. Acts 19:21 .  How he was bound  in the spirit is manifest, by comparing other passages, where the Holy Spirit of God is related to have shaped his apostolic course. He was bound, by the Spirit of God leading captive, constraining, his own spirit.
	As he went up to Jerusalem δεδεμένος  τῷ πνεύματι , so he left Judæa again δεδεμένος  τῇ σαρκί ,  a prisoner according to the flesh .
	He had no detailed knowledge of futurity nothing but what the Holy Spirit, in general forewarning, repeated at every point of his journey ( κατὰ πόλιν ; see ch. Acts 21:4 ; Acts 21:11 , for two such instances), announced, viz., imprisonment and tribulations. That  here no  inner voice of the Spirit is meant, is evident from the words κατὰ πόλιν . (Two of the three other places where this phrase occurs are from the mouth or pen of Paul.)
