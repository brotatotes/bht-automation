<b> 22. bound in my spirit</b>] This interpretation is most probable, both from the construction, and from the usage of the expression repeatedly by and of St. Paul in the sense of<i> his own spirit</i>. See ch. xvii. 16, where the principal instances are given. Compare Rom. xii. 11; 1 Cor. v. 3; 2 Cor. ii. 13, and ch. xix. 21.<i> How</i> he was bound<i> in the spirit</i>, is manifest, by comparing other passages, where the Holy Spirit of God is related to have shaped his apostolic course. He was bound, by the Spirit of God leading captive, constraining, his own spirit.—As he went up to Jerusalem,<i> bound in his spirit</i>, so he left Judæa again<i> bound in the flesh</i>,—<i>a prisoner according to the flesh</i>.—He had no detailed knowledge of futurity—nothing but what the Holy Spirit, in general forewarnings, repeated at every point of his journey (<i>city by city</i>; see ch. xxi. 4, 11, for two such instances), announced, viz. imprisonment and tribulations. That<i> here</i> no<i> inner voice</i> of the Spirit is meant, is evident from the words.
