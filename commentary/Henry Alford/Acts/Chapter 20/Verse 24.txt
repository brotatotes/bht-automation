<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] The reading in the text, amidst all the varieties, seems to be that out of which the others have all arisen, and whose difficulties they more or less explain. The first clause is a combination of two constructions, οὐδενὸς λόγου ποιοῦμαι τὴν ψυχὴν ἐμαυτοῦ , and οὐ ποιοῦμαι ( ἡγοῦμαι , Php 3:7-8 ) τὴν ψυχὴν τιμίαν ἐμαυτῷ . The best rendering in English would be, <strong> I hold my life of no account, nor precious to me</strong> . Then again the confused construction of the former clause shews itself in the ὡς of the latter, which is not ‘ <em> so that</em> ,’ but ‘ <em> as</em> ,’ q. d. before, ‘ <em> so</em> precious.’ ‘ <em> I do not value my life, in comparison with the finishing my course</em> .’ Render then the whole verse: <strong> But I hold my life of no account, nor is it so precious to me, as the finishing of my course.
