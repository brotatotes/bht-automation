<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] It has been argued from ἐν οἷς διῆλθον , that the elders of other churches besides that of Ephesus must have been present. But it might just as well have been argued, that <em> every one</em> to whom Paul had there preached must have been present, on account of the word πάντες . If he could regard the elders as the representatives of the various churches, of which there can be no doubt, why may not he similarly have regarded the <em> Ephesian</em> elders as representatives of the churches of proconsular Asia, and have addressed all in addressing them? Or may not these words have even a wider application, viz., to <em> all</em> who had been the subjects of his former personal ministry, in Asia and Europe, now addressed through the Ephesian elders? See the question, whether Paul <em> ever did see the Asiatic churches again</em> , discussed in the Prolegg. to the Pastoral Epistles, § ii. 18 ff. I may remark here, that the word οἶδα , in the mouth of Paul, does not necessarily imply that he spoke from divine and unerring knowledge, but expresses his own conviction of the certainty of what he is saying: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:27">Acts 26:27</span> , which is much to our point, as expressing his firm persuasion that king Agrippa <em> was</em> a believer in the prophets: but certainly no infallible knowledge of his heart: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:29">Romans 15:29</span> , where also a firm persuasion is expressed: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:19-20">Philippians 1:19-20</span> , where οἶδα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:19">Acts 20:19</span> , is explained to rest on ἀποκαραδοκία καὶ ἐλπίς in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:20">Acts 20:20</span> . So that he may here ground his expectation of never seeing them again, on the plan of making a journey into the west after seeing Rome, which he mentions <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:24">Romans 15:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:28">Romans 15:28</span> , and from which, with bonds and imprisonment and other dangers awaiting him, he might well expect never to return. So that what he here says need not fetter our judgment on the above question.</p>
