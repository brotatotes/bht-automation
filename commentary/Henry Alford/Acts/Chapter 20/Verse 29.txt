<p><strong> 29.</strong> ] <strong> ἄφιξις</strong> is here used in an unusual sense. An instance is found, Jos. Antt. iv. 8. 47, where Moses says, ἐπεὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἡμετέρους ἄπειμι προγόνους , καὶ θεὸς τήνδε μοι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς πρὸς ἐκείνους ἀφίξεως ὥρισε … which is somewhat analogous, but more easily explained. That in Herod. ix. 77 (init.) also seems analogous. In Demosth. de Pace, p. 58 (fin.), we have τὴν τότε ἄφιξιν εἰς τοὺς πολεμίους ἐποιήσατο , which is most like the usage here. Perhaps, absolutely put, it must signify ‘ <em> my death</em> ;’ see the above passage of Josephus.

<p><strong> λύκοι βαρεῖς</strong> ] not <em> persecutors</em> , but <em> false teachers</em> , from the words <strong> εἰσελ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἰς ὑμᾶς</strong> , by which it appears that they were to <em> come in among the flock</em> , i.e. to be baptized Christians. In fact Act 20:30 is explanatory of the metaphoric meaning of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:29">Acts 20:29</span> .

<p><strong> φείδομαι</strong> is only used by Paul, except <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4-5">2 Peter 2:4-5</span> .</p>
