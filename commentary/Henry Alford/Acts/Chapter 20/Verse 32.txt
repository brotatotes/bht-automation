<p><strong> 32. </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λόγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῆς χάρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> .] I should be inclined to attribute the occurrence of this expression in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:3">Acts 14:3</span> , to the narrative having come from Paul himself, or from one imbued with his words and habits of thought. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:24">Acts 20:24</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τῷ δυν</strong> .] Clearly spoken of <em> God</em> , not of the <em> word of His grace</em> , which cannot be said δοῦναι κληρον ., however it might οἰκοδομῆσαι .
	</p>
<p>The expression κληρον . ἐν τ . ἡγ . πᾶς . is strikingly similar to τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span> , addressed to this same church. See also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span> .</p>
