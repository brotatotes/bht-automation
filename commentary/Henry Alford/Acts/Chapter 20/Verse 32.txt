 32.   τ  .   λόγ  .   τῆς χάρ  .   αὐτ .] I should be inclined to attribute the occurrence of this expression in ch. Acts 14:3 , to the narrative having come from Paul himself, or from one imbued with his words and habits of thought. See Acts 20:24 .
	 τῷ δυν .] Clearly spoken of  God , not of the  word of His grace , which cannot be said δοῦναι κληρον ., however it might οἰκοδομῆσαι .
	The expression κληρον . ἐν τ . ἡγ . πᾶς . is strikingly similar to τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις , Ephesians 1:18 , addressed to this same church. See also ch. Acts 26:18 .
