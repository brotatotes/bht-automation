<b> 35. the weak</b>] Not here<i> the weak in faith</i> (Rom. xiv. 1; 1 Cor. viii. 9), as many think,—which the context both before and after will not allow:—but the poor.<br><br><b> It is more blessed to give than to re-ceive</b>] This saying of our Lord is one of the very few not recorded in the Gospels, which have come down to us. Many such must have been current in the apostolic times, and are possibly preserved unknown to us, in such epistles as those of James, Peter, and John. Bengel remarks, “The world’s opinion is different:” and cites from an old poet in Athenæus, “A fool the giver,—the receiver blest.” But we have some sayings the other way: not to quote authors who wrote after this date, and might have imbibed some of the spirit of Christianity, we find in Aristotle, “It is more becoming the liberal man to give just gifts, than to receive just receipts, or to abstain from receiving unjust ones. For it is more the part of ‘virtue to do, than to receive, good.”
