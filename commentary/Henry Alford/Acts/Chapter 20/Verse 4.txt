<b> 4. into</b> (as far as)<b> Asia</b>] It is not hereby implied that they went<i> no further</i> than to Asia: Trophimus (ch. xxi. 29) and Aristarchus (ch. xxvii. 2), and probably others, as the bearers of the alms from Macedonia and Corinth (1 Cor. xvi. 3, 4), accompanied him to Jerusalem.<br><br><b> Sopater [the son] of Pyrrhus, a Berean</b>] This mention of his father is perhaps made to distinguish him (?) from Sosipater, who was with Paul at Corinth (Rom. xvi. 21). The name Pyrrhus has in our copies been erased as that of an unknown person, and because the mention of the father is unusual in the N.T.:—no possible reason can be given for its<i> insertion</i> by copyists.<br><br><b> Aristarchus</b>] See ch. xix. 29; xxvii. 2; Col. iv. 10; Philem. 24.—Secundus is altogether unknown.—The Gaius here is not the Gaius of ch. xix. 29, who was a<i> Macedonian</i>. The epithet<b> of Derbe</b> is inserted for distinction’s sake. Timotheus was from<i> Lystra</i>, which probably gives occasion to his being mentioned here in close company with Gaius of Derbe. The name Caius (Gaius) was far too common to create any difficulty in there being two, or three (see note, ch. xix. 29) companions of Paul so called.<br><br><b> of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus</b>] Tychicus is mentioned Eph. vi. 21, as sent (to Ephesus from Rome) with that Epistle. He bore also that to the Colossians, Col. iv. 7, at the same time. See also 2 Tim. iv. 12; Tit. iii. 12.—Trophimus, an Ephesian, was in Jerusalem with Paul, ch. xxi. 29: and had been, shortly before 2 Tim. was written, left sick at Miletus.
