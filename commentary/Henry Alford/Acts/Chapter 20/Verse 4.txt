 4.   ἄρχι τ  .   Ἀσίας ] It is not hereby implied that they went  no further than to Asia: Trophimus (ch. Act 21:29 ) and Aristarchus (ch. Act 27:2 ), and probably others, as the bearers of the alms from Macedonia and Corinth ( 1Co 16:3-4 ), accompanied him to Jerusalem.
	 Σώπατρος Πύῤῥου Βεροιαῖος ] This mention of his father is perhaps made to distinguish him (?) from Sosipater, who was with Paul at Corinth ( Rom 16:21 ). The name Πύῤῥου has been erased as that of an unknown person, and because the mention of the father is unusual in the N. T.: no possible reason can be given for its  insertion by copyists.
	 Ἀρίσταρχος ] See ch. Acts 19:29 ; Acts 27:2 ; Colossians 4:10 ; Philemon 1:24 .
	Secundus is altogether unknown.
	The Gaius here is not the Gaius of ch. Acts 19:29 , who was a  Macedonian . The epithet Δερβαῖος is inserted for distinction’s sake. Timotheus was from  Lystra , which probably gives occasion to his being mentioned here in close company with Gaius of Derbe. All attempts to join Δερβαῖος with Τιμόθεος in the construction are futile. Timotheus was  not of Derbe , see ch. Acts 16:1-2 ; and the name Caius ( Γάϊος , Gr.) was far too common to create any difficulty in there being two, or three (see note, ch. Act 19:29 ) companions of Paul so called. With conjectural emendations of the text ( Δερβ . δὲ Τιμοθ ., Kuin., Valck.) we have no concern.
	 Ἀσιανοὶ Τ  .   κ  .   Τ  . ] Tycbicus is mentioned Ephesians 6:21 , as sent (to Ephesus from Rome) with that Epistle. He bore also that to the Colossians, Colossians 4:7 , at the same time. See also 2 Timothy 4:12 ; Titus 3:12 .
	Trophimus, an Ephesian, was in Jerusalem with Paul, ch. Acts 21:29 ; and had been, shortly before 2 Tim. was written, left sick at Miletus. (See Prolegg. to 2 Tim. § i. 5.)
