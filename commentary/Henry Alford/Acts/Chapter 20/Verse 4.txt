<p><strong> 4. </strong> <strong> ἄρχι τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἀσίας</strong> ] It is not hereby implied that they went <em> no further</em> than to Asia: Trophimus (ch. Act 21:29 ) and Aristarchus (ch. Act 27:2 ), and probably others, as the bearers of the alms from Macedonia and Corinth ( 1Co 16:3-4 ), accompanied him to Jerusalem.

<p><strong> Σώπατρος Πύῤῥου Βεροιαῖος</strong> ] This mention of his father is perhaps made to distinguish him (?) from Sosipater, who was with Paul at Corinth ( Rom 16:21 ). The name Πύῤῥου has been erased as that of an unknown person, and because the mention of the father is unusual in the N. T.: no possible reason can be given for its <em> insertion</em> by copyists.

<p><strong> Ἀρίσταρχος</strong> ] See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span> .

<p>Secundus is altogether unknown.

<p>The Gaius here is not the Gaius of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span> , who was a <em> Macedonian</em> . The epithet Δερβαῖος is inserted for distinction’s sake. Timotheus was from <em> Lystra</em> , which probably gives occasion to his being mentioned here in close company with Gaius of Derbe. All attempts to join Δερβαῖος with Τιμόθεος in the construction are futile. Timotheus was <em> not of Derbe</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1-2">Acts 16:1-2</span> ; and the name Caius ( Γάϊος , Gr.) was far too common to create any difficulty in there being two, or three (see note, ch. Act 19:29 ) companions of Paul so called. With conjectural emendations of the text ( Δερβ . δὲ Τιμοθ ., Kuin., Valck.) we have no concern.

<p><strong> Ἀσιανοὶ Τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Τ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Tycbicus is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:21">Ephesians 6:21</span> , as sent (to Ephesus from Rome) with that Epistle. He bore also that to the Colossians, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7">Colossians 4:7</span> , at the same time. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:12">2 Timothy 4:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:12">Titus 3:12</span> .

<p>Trophimus, an Ephesian, was in Jerusalem with Paul, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:29">Acts 21:29</span> ; and had been, shortly before 2 Tim. was written, left sick at Miletus. (See Prolegg. to 2 Tim. § i. 5.)</p>
