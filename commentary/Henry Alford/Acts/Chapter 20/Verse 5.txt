<b> 5. These</b>] The persons mentioned in ver. 4: not only Tychicus and Trophimus. The mention of Timotheus in this list, distinguished from those included under the word<b> us</b>, has created an insuperable difficulty to those who suppose Timotheus himself to be the narrator of what follows: which certainly cannot be got over (as De Wette) by supposing that Timotheus might have inserted himself in the list, and then tacitly excepted himself by the<b> us</b> afterwards. The truth is apparent here, as well as before, ch. xvi. 10 (where see note), that the anonymous narrator was in very intimate connexion with Paul; and on this occasion we find him remaining with him when the rest went forward.
