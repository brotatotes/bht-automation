<b> 5. These</b>] The persons mentioned in ver. 4: not only Tychicus and Trophimus. The mention of Timotheus in this list, distinguished from those included under the word<b> us</b>, has created an insuperable difficulty to those who suppose Timotheus himself to be the narrator of what follows: which certainly cannot be got over (as De Wette) by supposing that Timotheus might have inserted himself in the list, and then tacitly excepted himself by the<b> us</b> afterwards. The truth is apparent here, as well as before, ch. xvi. 10 (where see note), that the anonymous narrator was in very intimate connexion with Paul; and on this occasion we find him remaining with him when the rest went forward.<br><br><b> going before&c...</b>] For what reason, is not said: but we may well conceive, that if they bore the contributions of the churches, a better opportunity, or safer ship, may have determined Paul to send them on, he himself having work to do at Philippi; or perhaps, again, as Meyer suggests, Paul may have remained behind to keep the days of unleavened bread. But then why should not they have remained too? The same<i> motive</i> may not have operated with them: but in that case no reason can be given why they should have been<i> sent</i> on except as above. It is not impossible that both may have been combined: before the end of the days of unleavened bread, a favourable opportunity occurs of sailing to Troas, of which they, with their charge, avail themselves: Paul and Luke waiting till the end of the feast, and taking the risk of a less desirable conveyance. That the feast had<i> something</i> to do with it, the mention of<b> after the days of unleavened bread</b> seems to imply: such notices being not inserted ordinarily by Luke for the sake of<i> dates</i>. The assumption made by some that the rest of the company sailed at once for Troas from Corinth, while Paul and Luke went by land to Philippi, is inconsistent with the words used in the opening of ver. 4.—From the notice here, we learn that Paul’s stay in Europe on this occasion was about three-quarters of a year: from shortly after Pentecost, when he left Ephesus (see on ch. xix. 10), to the next Easter.
