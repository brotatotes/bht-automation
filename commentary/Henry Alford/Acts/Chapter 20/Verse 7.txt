<p><strong> 7.</strong> <strong> ἐν τῇ μιᾷ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σαββ</strong> .] We have here an intimation of the continuance of the practice, which seems to have begun immediately after the Resurrection (see Joh 20:26 ), of assembling on the first day of the week for religious purposes. (Justin Martyr, Apol. i. 67, p. 83, says, τῇ τοῦ ἡλίου λεγομένῃ ἡμέρᾳ πάντων κατὰ πόλεις ἢ ἀγροὺς μενόντων ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ συνέλευσις γίνεται .) Perhaps the greatest proof of all, that this day was thus observed, may be found in the early (see 1Co 16:2 ) and at length general prevalence, <em> in the Gentile world</em> , of the <em> Jewish seven-day period</em> as a <em> division of time</em> , which was entirely foreign to Gentile habits. It can only have been introduced as following on the practice of especial honour paid to this day. But we find in the Christian Scriptures no trace of any <em> sabbatical</em> observance of this or any day: nay, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span> (where see note), Paul shews the untenableness of any such view under the Christian dispensation. The idea of the <em> transference of the Jewish sabbath from the seventh day to the first</em> was an invention of later times.

The breaking of bread in the Holy Communion was at this time inseparable from the ἀγάπαι . It took place apparently in the evening (after the day’s work was ended), and at the end of the assembly, after the preaching of the word ( Act 20:11 ).

<p><strong> αὐτοῖς</strong> , in the third person, the discourse being addressed to the disciples at Troas: but the first person is used before and after, because all were assembled, and partook of the breaking of bread together. Not observing this, the copyists have altered ἡμῶν above into τῶν μαθητῶν , and ἦμεν , into ἦσαν to suit αὐτοῖς .</p>
