<b> 7. upon the first day of the week</b>] We have here an intimation of the continuance of the practice, which seems to have begun immediately after the Resurrection (see John xx. 26), of assembling on the first day of the week for religious purposes. Perhaps the greatest proof of all, that this day was thus observed, may be found in the early (see 1 Cor. xvi. 2) and at length general prevalence, in<i> the Gentile world</i>, of the<i> Jewish seven-day period</i> as a<i> division of time</i>,—which was entirely foreign to Gentile habits. It can only have been introduced as following on the practice of especial honour paid to this day. But we find in the Christian Scriptures no trace of any<i> sabbatical</i> observance of this or any day: nay, in Rom. xiv. 5 (where see note), St Paul shews the untenableness of any such view under the Christian dispensation. The idea of the<i> transference of the Jewish sabbath from the seventh day to the first</i> was an invention of later times.<br><br><b> to break bread</b>] See note on ch. ii. 42. The breaking of bread in the Holy Communion was at this time inseparable from the<i> agapæ</i> or<i> love-feasts</i>.
