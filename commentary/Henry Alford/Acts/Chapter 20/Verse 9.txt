<b> 9.</b>] Who Eutychus was is quite uncertain. The occurrence of the name as belonging to slaves and freedmen (as it appears from inscriptions) determines nothing.<br><br><b> on the window-seat</b>] The windows in the East were (and are) without glass, and with or without shutters.<br><br><b> being fallen into a deep sleep</b>] Literally,<b> borne down by a deep sleep</b>. I believe the word is used here and below<i> in the same sense</i>, not, as usually interpreted, here of the effect of sleep, and below of<i> the fall</i> caused by the sleep. It implies that relaxation of the system, and collapse of the muscular power, which is more or less indicated by our expressions ‘<i>falling asleep</i>,’ ‘<i>dropping asleep.</i>’ This effect is<i> being produced</i>, in this clause, but as Paul was going on long discoursing, took<i> complete possession of him</i>, and having been<b> overpowered</b>,—<b>entirely relaxed in consequence of the sleep</b>, he<i> fell</i>. In the words,<b> was taken up dead</b>, here there is a<i> direct assertion</i>, which can hardly be evaded by explaining it, ‘<i>was taken up for dead</i>,’ or by saying that it expresses the<i> judgment of those who took him up</i>, as Meyer. It seems to me, that the supposition of a mere suspended animation is as absurd here as in the miracle of Jairus’s daughter, Luke viii, 41–56. Let us take the narrative as it stands. The youth falls, and is taken up dead: so much is plainly asserted. Paul, not a physician, but an Apostle,—gifted, not with medical discernment, but with miraculous power, goes down to him, falls on him and embraces him,—a strange proceeding for one bent on discovering suspended animation, but not so for one who bore in mind the action of Elijah (1 Kings xvii. 21) and Elisha (2 Kings iv. 34), each time over a<i> dead body</i>,—and<i> having done this, not before</i>, bids them not to be troubled, for<i> his life was in him</i>. I would ask any unbiassed reader, taking these details into consideration, which of the two is the natural interpretation,—and whether there can be any reasonable doubt that<i> the intent of St. Luke is to relate a miracle of raising the dead</i>, and that he mentions the falling on and embracing him as the outward significant means taken by the Apostle to that end?
