<p><strong> καταφερόμενος ὕπν</strong> .] Wetstein gives many instances of the use of καταφέρομαι , either absolute, or with εἰς ὕπνον , signifying ‘ <em> to be oppressed with, borne down towards, sleep</em> ’. Thus Aristotle, de somn. et vig [103] iii. p. 466. b. 31, ed. Bekk.: τὰ ὑπνωτικὰ … πάντα … καρηβαρίαν … ποιεῖ … καὶ <strong> καταφερόμενοι</strong> καὶ νυστάζοντες τοῦτο δοκοῦσιν πάσχειν , καὶ ἀδυνατοῦσιν αἴρειν τὴν κεφαλὴν καὶ τὰ βλέφαρα : and Diod. Sic. iii. 57, <strong> κατενεχθεῖσαν</strong> εἰς ὕπνον ἰδεῖν ὄψιν .

<p>I believe the word is used here and below <em> in the same sense</em> , not, as usually interpreted, here of the effect of sleep, and below of <em> the fall</em> caused by the sleep. It implies that relaxation of the system, and collapse of the muscular power, which is more or less indicated by our expressions ‘ <em> falling</em> asleep,’ ‘ <em> dropping</em> asleep.’ This effect is <em> being produced</em> when the first participle is used, which is therefore <em> imperfect</em> , but as Paul was going on long discoursing, took <em> complete possession of him</em> , and, having been <strong> overpowered, entirely relaxed in consequence of the sleep</strong> , he <em> fell</em> .

<p>In the <strong> ἤρθη νεκρός</strong> here, there is a <em> direct assertion</em> , which can hardly be evaded by explaining it, ‘ <em> was taken up for dead</em> ,’ as De Wette, Olsh.; or by saying that it expresses the <em> judgment of those who took him up</em> , as Meyer. It seems to me, that the supposition of a mere suspended animation is as absurd here as in the miracle of Jairus’s daughter, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:41-56">Luke 8:41-56</span> . Let us take the narrative as it stands. The youth falls, and is taken up dead: so much is plainly asserted. (First, let it be remembered that Luke, a physician, was present, who could have at once pronounced on the fact.) Paul, not a physician, but as Apostle, gifted, not with medical discernment, but with miraculous power, goes down to him, falls on him and embraces him, a strange proceeding for one bent on discovering suspended animation, but not so for one who bore in mind the action of Elijah ( 1Ki 17:21 ) and Elisha ( 2Ki 4:34 ), each time over a <em> dead body</em> , and <em> having done this, not before</em> , bids them not to be troubled, for <em> his life was in him</em> . I would ask any unbiassed reader, taking these details into consideration, which of the two is the natural interpretation, and whether there can be any reasonable doubt that <em> the intent of Luke is to relate a miracle of raising the dead</em> , and that he mentions the falling on and embracing him as the outward significant means taken by the Apostle to that end?</p>
