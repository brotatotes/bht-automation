 16. ] Two renderings are given to the latter clause of this verse: (1) making Μνάσωνι , &c. depend on ἄγοντες , and agreeing by attr. with ᾧ , as E. V., ‘  and brought with them one Mnason, … with whom we should lodge ’ (so Beza, Calvin, Wolf, Schött., &c.): and (2) resolving the attraction into ἄγοντες παρὰ Μνάσωνα , παρ ʼ ᾧ ξ . ‘  bringing us to Mnason,’ &c. (So Grot., Valcknaer, Bengel, De Wette, Meyer, al.) Both are legitimate: and it is difficult to choose between them. The probability of Mnason being a resident at Jerusalem, and of the Cæsarean brethren going to introduce the company to him, seems to favour the  latter : as also does the fact that Luke much more frequently uses ἄγω with a person  followed by a preposition than absolutely. Of Mnason nothing further is known.
	 ἀρχαίῳ probably implies that he had been a disciple ἐξ ἀρχῆς , and had accompanied our Lord during His ministry. See ch. Acts 11:15 , where the term ἐξ ἀρχῆς is applied to the time of the Pentecostal effusion of the Spirit.
