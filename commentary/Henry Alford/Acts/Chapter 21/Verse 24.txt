The same expression occurs in the LXX, Num. vi. 3, in describing the Nazarite’s duties.<br><br><b> be at charges for them</b>] It was a custom of the Jews, and was considered a proof of great piety, that the richer Nazarites should pay the expenses of the sacrifices of the poorer. See Num. vi. 14 ff. Josephus, relating Agrippa’s thank-offerings at Jerusalem, says that he ordered very many Nazarites to be shaven.—On the shaving the head, see Num. vi. 18.—De Wette remarks: ‘James and the elders made this proposal, assuming that Paul could comply with it with a safe conscience, perhaps also as a proof, to assure themselves and others of his sentiments: and Paul accepted it with a safe conscience. But this he could only have done on one condition, that he was sure by it not to contribute in these four Nazarites to the error of<i> justification by the works of the law</i>. He might keep, and encourage the keeping of, the law,—but not with the purpose of thereby deserving the approbation of God.’
