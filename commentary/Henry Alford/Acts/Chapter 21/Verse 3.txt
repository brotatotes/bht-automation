 3.   ἀναφανέντες ] for the construction, see reff. and Winer, edn. 6, § 39. 1:  having been shewn Cyprus , literally. Wetst. cites from Theophanes, p. 392, περιεφέροντο ἐν τῷ πελάγει , ἀναφανέντων δὲ αὐτῶν τὴν γῆν , εἶδον αὐτοὺς οἱ στρατηγοί . ‘The graphic language of an eyewitness, and of one familiar with the phraseology of seamen, who, in their own language, appear to  raise the land in approaching it.’ Smith, Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul. But would not this remark rather apply to the  active participle? Compare ‘aerias Phæacum abscondimus arces,’ Æn. iii. 291.
	 εὐώνυμον ] sc. αὐτήν , i.e. to the E. This would be the straight course from Patara to Tyre.
	 ἐπλ  .   εἰς Σ  ., we held our course , steered,  for Syria.
	 κατήλθ  .] we came down to, the result of having borne down upon.
	 Τύρον ] This city, so well known for its commercial importance and pride, and so often mentioned in the O. T. prophets, was now a free town (Jos. Ant. xv. 41. Strabo, xvi. 2, οὐχ ὑπὸ τῶν βασιλέων δ ʼ ἐκρίθησαν αὐτόνομοι μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν Ῥωμαίων ) of the province of Syria.
	 ἐκεῖσε ] If this is an adv. of motion as generally, the reference may be to the carrying and depositing the cargo in the town (De Wette), or to the thitherward direction of the voyage (Meyer): but in the only other place where ἐκεῖσε occurs (ref. [see also ref. Job]) it simply = ἐκεῖ , so that perhaps no  motion is included.
	 ἀποφορτ .] The pres. part. indicates the intention, as διαπερῶν before.
