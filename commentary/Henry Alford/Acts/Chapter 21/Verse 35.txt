<b> 35. upon the stairs</b>] The steps leading up into the tower. The description of the tower or fort Antonia in Josephus, sets the scene vividly before us:— “It was, upon the whole, the resemblance of a tower, and encompassed with four other towers at equal distances one from another, and one from every corner: three of them fifty cubits in height, and the fourth, that looked to the S. and E., of seventy cubits: and from thence they had the view of the whole temple. From the place where the galleries joined, there were upon the right and left two pair of stairs, which served for a passage to the soldiers into the temple: for when the Romans were masters of Jerusalem, there were guards posted still upon that quarter to prevent seditions upon their public festivals and meetings. For as the temple commanded the city, so Antonia the temple.” (L’ Estrange.)
