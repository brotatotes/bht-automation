<b> 38. that Egyptian</b>] The inference of the tribune was not, as in Bengel, “He speaks Greek, therefore he is an Egyptian,” but the very contrary to this. His being able to speak Greek is a proof to Lysias that he is<i> not</i> that Egyptian.—This Egyptian is mentioned by Josephus, who says that he persuaded the people to follow him to the Mount of Olives, whence he would by a word throw down the walls of Jerusalem. This Felix heard of, and sent soldiers to stop his folly, who slew four hundred of his followers, and took two hundred alive. He himself, however, escaped. In another place, he says of the same person, that he collected about 30, 000 deluded persons, and brought them out of the wilderness to the Mount of Olives, and that a battle took place, in which most of his followers were killed or taken prisoners. It is obvious that the<i> numerical</i> accounts in Josephus are inconsistent with our text, and with<i> one another</i>. This latter being the case, we may well leave them out of the question. At different times of his rebellion, his number of followers would be variously estimated; and the tribune would naturally take it as he himself or his informant had known it, at some one period. That this is so, we may see, by noticing that our narrative speaks of his<i> leading out</i>,—whereas Josephus’s numbers are those whom he<i> brought back from</i> the wilderness against Jerusalem, by which time his band would have augmented considerably.
