<b> 4. But…</b>] Implying, ‘the crew indeed were busied with unlading the ship: but we, having sought out (by enquiry) the disciples.’..... ‘<i>Finding disciples</i>’ (A. V.) is quite wrong. It is not improbable that Paul may have preached at Tyre before, when he visited Syria and Cilicia (Gal. i. 21) after his conversion,—and again when he confirmed the churches (ch. xv. 41): “<i>the disciples</i>” seems to imply this.<br><br><b> seven days</b>] The time taken in unlading:—they apparently proceeded in the same ship, see ver, 6.—The notice here is very important, that these Tyrian disciples said to St. Paul<i> by the Spirit</i>, that he should not go to Jerusalem,—and<i> yet he went thither</i>, and, as he himself declares,<i> bound in spirit by the leading of God</i>. We thus have an instance of that which Paul asserts 1 Cor. xiv. 32, that the spirits of prophets are<i> subject to prophets</i>, i.e. that the revelation made by the Holy Spirit to each man’s spirit was under the influence of that man’s will and temperament, moulded by and taking the form of his own capacities and resolves. So here: these Tyrian<i> prophets</i> knew by the Spirit, which testified this in every city (ch. xx. 23), that bonds and imprisonment awaited Paul. This appears to have been announced by them, shaped and intensified by their own intense love and anxiety for him who was probably their Father in the faith (see on ver. 5). But he paid no regard to the prohibition, being himself under a leading of the same Spirit too plain for him to mistake it. See below on vv. 10 ff.
