 5.   ἐξαρτίσαι ] This is ordinarily a naval word, signifying to  fit out or  refit a ship (with or without πλοῖον , Passow). But this can hardly be the meaning here. Meyer would render ‘  when we had spent these days in refitting ,’ so that τ . ἡμ . would be the accusative of duration, ‘  when we had refitted during the days .’ But not to mention that τὰς ἡμ ., without ταύτας , would be harsh in such a connexion, is not the  aorist ἐξαρτίσαι fatal to the rendering? Would it not in this case be  present , if implying the continued action during the days,  perfect , if implying that that action was over (in which latter case ἡμ . would be dative)? The aorist, as almost invariably in dependent clauses, must refer to some  one act occurring at one time. So that if the meaning given by Theoph., Œc [141] πληρῶσαι (Hesych [142] τελειῶσαι ) be found no where else, it is almost necessary so to understand the word here. And it is doing no violence to its import: the same verb which indicates the completion of a ship’s readiness for a voyage, might well be applied to the completion of a period of time. Our own word ‘fulfil’ has undergone a similar change of meaning since its first composition: and πληρῶσαι is used both of manning a ship and of fulfilling a period of time.
