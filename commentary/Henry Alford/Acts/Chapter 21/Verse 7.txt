The A.V., ‘<i>when we had finished our course from Tyre</i>, is not so probable a rendering of the original. ‘With their landing at Ptolemais their voyage ended: the rest of the journey was made by land.’ (De Wette.)<br><br><b> Ptolemais</b>] Anciently Accho (Judg. i. 31,—in Greek and Roman writers Acé), called Ptolemáïs from (probably) Ptolemy Lathurus. It was a large town with a harbour. It was never (Judg. i. 31) fully possessed by the Jews, but belonged to the Phœnicians, who in after times were mixed with Greeks. But after the captivity a colony of Jews is found there. The emperor Claudius gave it the freedom of the city, whence it is called by Pliny ‘a colony of Claudius Cæsar,’ “Colonia Claudii Cæsaris.” It is now called St. Jean d’ Acre, and is the best harbour on the Syrian coast, though small. It lies at the end of the great road from Damascus to the sea. Population now about 10, 000.—The distance from Ptolemaïs to Cæsarea is forty-four miles. For Cmsarea, see on ch. x. 1.
