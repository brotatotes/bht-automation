 7.   τὸν πλοῦν διανύς .]  Having ended our voyage , viz.  the whole voyage , from Neapolis to Syria. The E.V., ‘  when we had finished our course from Tyre ,’ is allowable, but this would more probably have been τὸν ἀπὸ Τύρου . ‘With their landing at Ptolemais their voyage ended: the rest of the journey was made by land.’ (De Wette.) ἀπὸ Τύρου will thus be taken with κατηντήσαμεν .
	 Πτολεμαΐδα ] Anciently Accho ( Ἀκχώ , LXX, Judges 1:31 , in Gr. and Rom. writers Ἄκη , Ace), called Ptolemais from (probably) Ptolemy Lathurus (Jos. Antt. xiii. 12. 2 ff., see 1Ma 10:56 ff; 1Ma 11:22 ; 1Ma 11:24 ; 1Ma 12:45 ; 1Ma 12:48 ; 2Ma 13:24 ). It was a large town with a harbour (Jos. Antt. xviii. 6. 3). It was never ( Jdg 1:31 ) fully possessed by the Jews, but belonged to the Phœnicians, who in after times were mixed with Greeks. But after the captivity a colony of Jews is found there (Jos. B. J. ii. 18. 5). The emperor Claudius gave it the ‘civitas,’ whence it is called by Pliny, Acts 21:17 ; xxxvi. 65, ‘Colonia Claudii Cæsaris.’ It is now called St. Jean d’Acre, and is the best harbour on the Syrian coast, though small. It lies at the end of the great road from Damascus to the sea. Population now about 10,000.
	The distance from Ptolemais to Cæsarea is forty-four miles. For Cæsarea, see on ch. Acts 10:1 .
