 8.   Φιλ  .   τ  .   εὐαγγ .] It is possible that he may have had this appellation from his having been the first to travel about preaching the gospel: see ch. Acts 8:5 ff. The office of Evangelist, see reff., seems to have answered very much to our  missionary : Theodoret, on Ephesians 4:11 , says, ἐκεῖνοι περιΐόντες ἐκήρυττον : and Euseb. H. E. iii. 37, ἔργον ἐπετέλουν εὐαγγελιστῶν , τοῖς ἔτι πάμπαν ἀνηκόοις τοῦ τῆς πίστεως λόγου κηρύττειν τὸν χριστὸν φιλοτιμούμενοι , καὶ τὴν τῶν θείων εὐαγγελίων παραδιδόναι γραφήν . The latter could hardly have been part of their employment so early as this; nor had εὐαγγέλιον in these times the peculiar meaning of a  narrative of the life of Christ , but rather embraced the  whole good tidings of salvation by Him , as preached to the Jews and Heathens. See Neander, Pfl. u. L., pp. 258, 264.
	Euseb., iii. 31, apparently mistakes this Philip for  the Apostle : as did also (see Valesius’s note, Euseb. l. c.) Clement of Alexandria and Papias.
	 ὄντος ἐκ τ  .   ἑπτά ] See ch. Acts 6:5 , and note. Meyer and Winer (edn. 6, § 20. l. c.) well remark (see De Wette also), that the participle without the article implies that the reason why they abode with him was that he was one of the seven: ‘ut qui esset,’ &c. and in English  being (one)  of the seven . The fact of Philip being settled at Cæsarea, and known as ὁ εὐαγγελιστής , seems decisive against regarding the occurrence of ch. Acts 6:3 ff. as the establishment of any permanent order in the church.
