<b> 8. Philip the evangelist</b>] It is possible that he may have had this appellation from his having been the first to travel about preaching the gospel: see ch. viii. 5 ff. The office of Evangelist, see Eph. iv. 11, 2 Tim. iv. 5, seems to have answered very much to our<i> missionary</i>: Theodoret, on the former of these texts, says, “These went about preaching:” and Eusebius,— “They fulfilled the work of Evangelists, making it their business to preach Christ to those who had never yet heard the word of the faith, and to deliver to them the record of the Holy Gospels.” The latter could hardly have been part of their employment so early as this; nor had the word<i> Gospel</i> in these times the peculiar meaning of a<i> narrative of the life of Christ</i>, but rather embraced the<i> whole good tidings of salvation by Him</i>, as preached to the Jews and Heathens.—Eusebius apparently mistook this Philip for<i> the Apostle</i>: as did also Clement of Alexandria and Papias.
