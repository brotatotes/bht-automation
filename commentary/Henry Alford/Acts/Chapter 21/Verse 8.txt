<p><strong> 8. </strong> <strong> Φιλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εὐαγγ</strong> .] It is possible that he may have had this appellation from his having been the first to travel about preaching the gospel: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:5">Acts 8:5</span> ff. The office of Evangelist, see reff., seems to have answered very much to our <em> missionary</em> : Theodoret, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span> , says, ἐκεῖνοι περιΐόντες ἐκήρυττον : and Euseb. H. E. iii. 37, ἔργον ἐπετέλουν εὐαγγελιστῶν , τοῖς ἔτι πάμπαν ἀνηκόοις τοῦ τῆς πίστεως λόγου κηρύττειν τὸν χριστὸν φιλοτιμούμενοι , καὶ τὴν τῶν θείων εὐαγγελίων παραδιδόναι γραφήν . The latter could hardly have been part of their employment so early as this; nor had εὐαγγέλιον in these times the peculiar meaning of a <em> narrative of the life of Christ</em> , but rather embraced the <em> whole good tidings of salvation by Him</em> , as preached to the Jews and Heathens. See Neander, Pfl. u. L., pp. 258, 264.

<p>Euseb., iii. 31, apparently mistakes this Philip for <em> the Apostle</em> : as did also (see Valesius’s note, Euseb. l. c.) Clement of Alexandria and Papias.

<p><strong> ὄντος ἐκ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἑπτά</strong> ] See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</span> , and note. Meyer and Winer (edn. 6, § 20. l. c.) well remark (see De Wette also), that the participle without the article implies that the reason why they abode with him was that he was one of the seven: ‘ut qui esset,’ &amp;c. and in English <strong> being</strong> (one) <strong> of the seven</strong> . The fact of Philip being settled at Cæsarea, and known as ὁ εὐαγγελιστής , seems decisive against regarding the occurrence of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:3">Acts 6:3</span> ff. as the establishment of any permanent order in the church.</p>
