<b> 9.</b>] This notice is inserted apparently without any immediate reference to the history, but to bring so remarkable a circumstance to the knowledge of the readers. The four daughters had the gift of “<i>prophecy</i>:” see on ch. xi. 27. Eusebius (see, however, his mistake above) gives from Polycrates traditional accounts of them,—that two were buried at Hierapolis, and one at Ephesus. From that passage, and one cited from Clement of Alexandria it would appear that two were afterwards married, according to tradition.—To find an argument for the so-called ‘honour of virginity’ in this verse, only shews to what resources those will stoop, who have failed to apprehend the whole spirit and rule of the gospel in the matter. They are met however on their own ground by an argument built on another misapprehension (that of Philip being a deacon in the ecclesiastical sense): for if so, this would prove that it was lawful for deacons to marry.
