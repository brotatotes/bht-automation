 18. ]  περὶ ἐμοῦ is to be taken with μαρτυρίαν , not with the verb, as Meyer and Winer maintain. Their objection, that then it must be τὴν μαρτ .  τὴν περὶ ἐμοῦ is answered by remarking, (1) that Paul does not always observe accuracy in this usage of the article: e.g. Ephesians 6:5 , ὑπακούετε τοῖς κυρίοις κατὰ σάρκα , for τ . κυρ . τοῖς κατα σάρκα , or τοῖς κατὰ σάρκα κυρίοις , which he has written in the [146] , Col 3:22 , 1 Thessalonians 4:16 , οἱ νεκροὶ ἐν χριστῷ ἀναστήσονται πρῶτον . See also Romans 6:4 ; Colossians 2:14 , and notes: and (2) that there may have been a reason for the irregularity here, inasmuch as, if either the article had been expressed after μαρτ ., or τὴν π . ἐμ . μαρτ . had been used, σου would have appeared to be governed by παραδέξονται ‘they will not receive  from thee thy testimony concerning me,’ which is not precisely the meaning intended to be conveyed. (See Mr. Green’s Gram. of N. T. p. 163.)
	 [146] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
