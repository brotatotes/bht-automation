<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] <strong> περὶ ἐμοῦ</strong> is to be taken with μαρτυρίαν , not with the verb, as Meyer and Winer maintain. Their objection, that then it must be τὴν μαρτ . <strong> τὴν</strong> περὶ ἐμοῦ is answered by remarking, (1) that Paul does not always observe accuracy in this usage of the article: e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span> , ὑπακούετε τοῖς κυρίοις κατὰ σάρκα , for τ . κυρ . τοῖς κατα σάρκα , or τοῖς κατὰ σάρκα κυρίοις , which he has written in the [146] , Col 3:22 , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span> , οἱ νεκροὶ ἐν χριστῷ ἀναστήσονται πρῶτον . See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+2:14">Colossians 2:14</span> , and notes: and (2) that there may have been a reason for the irregularity here, inasmuch as, if either the article had been expressed after μαρτ ., or τὴν π . ἐμ . μαρτ . had been used, σου would have appeared to be governed by παραδέξονται ‘they will not receive <em> from thee</em> thy testimony concerning me,’ which is not precisely the meaning intended to be conveyed. (See Mr. Green’s Gram. of N. T. p. 163.)

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [146] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
