<p><strong> 20.</strong> <strong> μάρτυρός σου</strong> ] “E. V. ‘ <em> thy martyr</em> ,’ following Beza: Vulg., and Erasm, <em> testis tui</em> . The Apostle may have here used the (Hebrew, עֵד , as Wordsworth) word in its strict primary sense; for a view of Christ in His glory was vouchsafed to Stephen, and it was by <em> bearing witness</em> of that manifestation that he hastened his death (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:55">Acts 7:55</span> ff.). The present meaning of the word <em> martyr</em> did, however, become attached to it at a very early period, and is apparently of apostolic authority: e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+17:6">Revelation 17:6</span> , and Clem. Rom [147] <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:0">1 Corinthians 5:0</span> , p. 217 (cited in note on ch. Act 1:25 ).… The transition from the first to the secondary sense may be easily accounted for. Many who had only seen with the eye of faith, suffered persecution and death as a proof of their sincerity. For such constancy the Greek had no adequate term. It was necessary for the Christians to provide one. None was more appropriate than μάρτυρ , seeing what had been the fate of those whom Christ had appointed to be His <em> witnesses</em> (ch. Act 1:8 ). <em> They</em> almost all suffered: hence <em> to witness</em> became a synonym for to <em> suffer</em> ; while the suffering was in itself a kind of testimony.” (Mr. Humphry.) Bp. Wordsworth well designates this introduction of the name of Stephen “A noble endeavour to make public reparation for a public sin, by public confession in the same place where the sin was committed.”
