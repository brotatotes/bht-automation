<b> 20. thy martyr</b>] So A.V., following Beza: the Vulgate, and Erasmus, ‘<i>thy witness</i>,’ which is the primary meaning of the word<i> martyr</i> in Greek. “The Apostle may have here used the word (speaking in Hebrew) in its strict primary sense; for a view of Christ in His glory was vouchsafed to Stephen, and it was by<i> bearing witness</i> of that manifestation that he hastened his death (ch. vii. 55 ff). The present meaning of the word<i> martyr</i> did, however, become attached to it at a very early period, and is apparently of apostolic authority: e.g. Rev. xvii. 6, and Clement of Rome, 1 Cor. v. (cited in note on ch. i. 25).... The transition from the first to the secondary sense may be easily accounted for. Many who had only seen with the eye of faith, suffered persecution and death as a proof of their sincerity. For such constancy the Greek had no adequate term. It was necessary for the Christians to provide one. None was more appropriate than<i> ‘witness’</i> (<i>martyr</i>), seeing what had been the fate of those whom Christ had appointed to be His<i> witnesses</i> (ch. i. 8). They almost all suffered: hence to<i> witness</i> became a synonym for to<i> suffer</i>: while the suffering was in itself a kind of testimony.” (Mr. Humphry.) Dr. Wordsworth well designates this introduction of the name of Stephen “a noble endeavour to make public reparation for a public sin, by public confession in the same place where the sin was committed.”
