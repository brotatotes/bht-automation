 20.  μάρτυρός σου ] “E. V. ‘  thy martyr ,’ following Beza: Vulg., and Erasm,  testis tui . The Apostle may have here used the (Hebrew, עֵד , as Wordsworth) word in its strict primary sense; for a view of Christ in His glory was vouchsafed to Stephen, and it was by  bearing witness of that manifestation that he hastened his death (ch. Acts 7:55 ff.). The present meaning of the word  martyr did, however, become attached to it at a very early period, and is apparently of apostolic authority: e.g. Revelation 17:6 , and Clem. Rom [147] 1 Corinthians 5:0 , p. 217 (cited in note on ch. Act 1:25 ).… The transition from the first to the secondary sense may be easily accounted for. Many who had only seen with the eye of faith, suffered persecution and death as a proof of their sincerity. For such constancy the Greek had no adequate term. It was necessary for the Christians to provide one. None was more appropriate than μάρτυρ , seeing what had been the fate of those whom Christ had appointed to be His  witnesses (ch. Act 1:8 ).  They almost all suffered: hence  to witness became a synonym for to  suffer ; while the suffering was in itself a kind of testimony.” (Mr. Humphry.) Bp. Wordsworth well designates this introduction of the name of Stephen “A noble endeavour to make public reparation for a public sin, by public confession in the same place where the sin was committed.”
