<p><strong> 23. </strong> <strong> ῥιπτούντων</strong> ] Not ‘ <em> flinging off</em> their garments,’ as preparing to stone him, or even as <em> representing</em> the action of such preparation: the former would be futile, as he was in the custody of the tribune, the latter absurd, and not borne out by any known habit of the Jews: but <strong> shaking</strong> , <em> jactitantes</em> , <strong> their garments</strong> , as shaking off the dust, abominating such an expression and him who uttered it. The casting dust into the air was part of the same gesture. Chrys. explains it, ῥιπτάζοντες , ἐκτινάσσοντες .</p>
