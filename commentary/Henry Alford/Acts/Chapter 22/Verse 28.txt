<b> 28.</b>] Dio Cassius mentions that, in the reign of Claudius, Messalina used to sell the freedom of the city, and at very various prices at different times.<br><br><b> I was free born</b>] literally,<b> But I</b> (besides having the privilege like thee of being a Roman citizen)<b> was also born one</b>.<i> How was Paul a Roman citizen by birth?</i> Certainly not because he was of Tarsus: for (1) that city had no such privilege, but was only a<i> free city</i>, not a colony nor a municipal town: and (2) if this had been so, the mention of his being a man of Tarsus (ch. xxi. 39) would have of itself prevented his being scourged. It remains, therefore, that his father, or some ancestor, must have obtained the freedom of the city, either as a reward for service or by purchase. It has been suggested that the father of Saul may have been sold into slavery at Rome, when Cassius laid a heavy fine on the city of Tarsus for having espoused the cause of Octavius and Antony, and very many of the Tarsians were sold to pay it. He may have acquired his freedom and the citizenship afterwards. See Mr. Lewin, i.p. 4. But this is mere conjecture.
