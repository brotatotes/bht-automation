<b> 29. was afraid</b>] There is no inconsistency (as De Wette thinks) in the tribune’s being afraid because he had bound him, and then letting him remain thus bound. Meyer rightly explains it, that the tribune, having committed this error, is afraid of the possible consequences of it (for as Cicero says, it was an offence to bind a Roman citizen, and a crime to scourge him), and shews this by taking the first opportunity of either<i> undoing it</i>, or<i> justifying his further detention</i>, by<i> loosing him</i>, and<i> bringing him before the Sanhedrim</i>. His fear was on account of his<i> first false step;</i> but it was now too late to reverse it: and the same reason which leads him to continue it now, operates afterwards when the hearing was delayed. ‘The centurion<i> believed Paul’s word</i>, because a false claim of this nature, being easily exposed, and punishable with death, was almost an unprecedented thing.’ Hackett.
