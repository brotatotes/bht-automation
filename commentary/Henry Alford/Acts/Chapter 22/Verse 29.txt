<p><strong> ἐφοβ</strong> .] There is no inconsistency (as De W.) in the tribune’s being afraid because he had bound him, and then letting him remain thus bound. Meyer rightly explains it, that the tribune, having committed this error, is afraid of the possible consequences of it (‘facinus est vinciri civem R., scelus verberari,’ Cic. Verr. v. 66), and shews this by taking the first opportunity of either <em> undoing it</em> , or <em> justifying his further detention</em> , by <em> loosing him</em> , and <em> bringing him before the Sanhedrim</em> . His fear was on account of his <em> first false step</em> ; but it was now too late to reverse it: and the same reason which leads him to continue it now, operates afterwards ( ὁ δέσμιος Π ., ch. Act 23:18 ) when the hearing was delayed. That ἦν δεδεκώς cannot, as Bloomfield and Wordsworth suppose, refer only to the <em> binding before scourging</em> , its immediate juxtaposition with ἔλυσεν in the next verse sufficiently shews. Besides, the mere circumstance of a preparation for scourging having been begun in ignorance, and <em> left off as soon as the knowledge was received</em> , would rather have relieved, than occasioned, the fear of the tribune. A more cogent reason still is, that ἦν δεδεκώς can properly only apply to an action <em> still continuing</em> when the fear was felt: <strong> that he had put him into custody</strong> . ‘The centurion believed Paul’s word, because a false claim of this nature, being easily exposed, and punishable with death (Suet. Claud. 25), was almost an unprecedented thing.’ Hackett.</p>
