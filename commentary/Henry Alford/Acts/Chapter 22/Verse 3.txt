<b> 3.</b>] On<i> Gamaliel</i> see note, ch. v. 34.—The expression “<b>at the feet</b><i> of Gamaliel</i>” (see ch. iv. 35, note) indicates that the rabbi sat on an elevated seat and the scholars on the ground or on benches, literally<i> at his feet</i>.<br><br><b> according to the perfect manner</b> (the art. omitted aft. a prep.),<b> the strict acceptation, of the law of the fathers;</b> so in ch. xxvi. 5, i.e. “<i>the straitest sect of our religion;</i>”—i. e. as a Pharisee.<br><br><b> as ye all are this day</b>] Not meaning ‘<i>in the same way as</i> YE<i> all are this day</i>’ (but<i> now</i> in<i> another</i> way): but<b> as ye all are this day:</b> ‘I had the same zealous character (not excluding his still retaining it) which you all shew to-day.’ A conciliatory comparison.
