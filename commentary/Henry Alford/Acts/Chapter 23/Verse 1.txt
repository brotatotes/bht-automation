<b> XXIII. 1.</b>]<b> earnestly beholding</b> seems to describe that peculiar look, connected probably with infirmity of sight, with which Paul is described before as regarding those before him: and may perhaps account for his not knowing that the person who spoke to him was the high priest, ver. 5. See ch. xiii. 9, note.—The purport of Paul's assertion seems to be this: being charged with neglecting, and teaching others to neglect the law of Moses, he at once endeavours to disarm those who thus accused him, by asserting that up to that,<i> he had lived a true and loyal Jew</i>,—obeying, according to his conscience, the law of that divine polity of which he was a covenant member. Thus<b> I have lived before God</b> (literally,<b> have been a citizen before God</b>) will have its full and proper meaning: and the words are no vain-glorious ones, but an important assertion of his innocence.
