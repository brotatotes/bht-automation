<b> 11.</b>] By these few words, the Lord assured him (1) of a<i> safe issue from his present troubles;</i> (2) of an<i> accomplishment of his intention of visiting Rome:</i> (3) of the certainty that however he might be sent thither, he should<i> preach the gospel and bear testimony there</i>. So that they upheld and comforted him (1) in the<i> uncertainty of his life from the Jews:</i> (2) in the<i> uncertainty of his liberation from prison at Cesarea:</i> (3) in the<i> uncertainty of his surviving the storm in the Mediterranean:</i> (4) in the<i> uncertainty of his fate on arriving at Rome</i>. So may one crumb of divine grace and help be multiplied to feed five thousand wants and anxieties.
