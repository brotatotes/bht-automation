So that they upheld and comforted him (1) in the  uncertainty of his life from the Jews : (2) in the  uncertainty of his liberation from prison at Cæsarea : (3) in the  uncertainty of his surviving the storm in the Mediterranean : (4) in the  uncertainty of his fate on arriving at Rome . So may one crumb of divine grace and help be multiplied to feed five thousand wants and anxieties.
