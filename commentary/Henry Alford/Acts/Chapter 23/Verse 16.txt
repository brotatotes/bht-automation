<b> 16.</b>] It is quite uncertain whether Paul’s sister’s son lived in Jerusalem, or had accompanied him thither. The<i> us</i> of ch. xx. 5, will include more than merely Luke. But from his knowledge of the plot, which presupposes other acquaintances than he would have been likely to make if he had come with St. Paul, I should suppose him to have been domiciled at Jerusalem, possibly under instruction, as was formerly Paul himself, and thus likely, in the schools, to have heard the scheme spoken of.
