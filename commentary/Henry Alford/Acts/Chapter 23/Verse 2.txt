<b> 2. Ananias</b>] He was at this time the<i> actual high priest</i> (ver. 4). He was the son of Nebedæus—succeeded Joseph son of Camydus—and preceded Ismael, son of Phabi. He was nominated to the office by Herod, king of Chaleis, in A.D. 48; and sent to Rome by Quadratus, the prefect of Syria, to give an account to the emperor Claudius; he appears, however, not to have lost his office, but to have resumed it on his return. This has been regarded as not certain,—and the uncertainty has produced much confusion in the Pauline chronology. But as Wieseler has shewn, there can be no reasonable doubt that it was so, especially as Ananias came off victorious in the cause for which he went to Rome, viz. a quarrel with the Jewish procurator Cumanus,—who went with him, and was condemned to banishment. He was deposed from his office not long before the departure of Felix, but still had great power, which he used violently and lawlessly: he was assassinated by the<i> sicarii</i> (see ch. xxi. 38, note) at last.
