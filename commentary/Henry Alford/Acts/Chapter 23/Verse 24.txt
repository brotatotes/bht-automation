He was made sole procurator of Judæa after the deposition of Cumanus (having before been three years joint procurator with him) principally by the influence of the high priest Jonathan, whom he afterwards procured to be murdered. Of his character Tacitus says, “Antonius Felix wielded kingly power with the disposition of a slave, disgracing it by every kind of cruelty and lust.” His procuratorship was one series of disturbances, false messiahs, assassins, and robbers, and civil contests. He was eventually (A. D. 60) recalled, and accused by the Cæsarean Jews, but acquitted at the instance of his brother Pallas.
