<b> 3.</b>] It is perfectly allowable (even if the fervid rebuke of Paul be considered exempt from blame) to contrast with his conduct and reply that of Him Who, when similarly smitten, answered with perfect and superhuman meekness, 22, 23. Our blessed Saviour is to us, in all His words and acts,<i> the perfect pattern for all under all circumstances:</i> by aiming at whatever He did in each case, we shall do best: but even the greatest of his Apostles are so far our patterns only as they<i> followed</i> Him, which certainly in this case Paul<i> did not</i>. That Paul thus answered, might go far to excuse a like fervent reply in a Christian or a minister of the gospel,—but must never be used to<i> justify</i> it: it may serve for an<i> apology</i>, but never for an<i> example</i>.<br><br><b> God shall</b> (<b>is about to</b>, literally)<b> smite thee</b>] Some have seen a prophetic import in these words;—see above on the death of Ananias. But I would rather take them as an expression founded on a conviction that God’s just retribution would come on unjust and brutal acts.<br><br><b> thou whited wall</b>] Lightfoot’s interpretation, that St. Paul used this term because Ananias had only the semblance of the high priesthood and had lost the thing itself, is founded on the hypothesis (<i>for it is none other</i>) that the high priesthood was vacant at this time, and Ananias had thrust himself into it. The meaning is as in Matt. xxiii. 27; and in all probability Paul referred in thought to our Lord’s saying.<br><br><b> sittest thou to judge me</b>] This must not be taken as favouring the common interpretation of ver. 5 (see below): for the<i> whole Sanhedrim</i> were the judges, and sitting to judge him according to the law.
