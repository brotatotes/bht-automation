<b> 5.</b>] (1) The ordinary interpretation of these words since Lightfoot, is, that Ananias<i> had usurped the office during a vacancy</i>, and therefore was not recognized by Paul. They regard his being sent to Rome as a virtual setting aside from being high priest, and suppose that Jonathan, who was murdered by order of Felix, was appointed high priest in his absence. But (<i>a</i>) there is no ground whatever for believing that his office vacated. He won the cause for which he went to Rome, and returned to Jerusalem: it was only when a high priest was detained as hostage in Rome, that we read of another being appointed in his room: and (<i>b</i>) which is fatal to the hypothesis,<i> Jonathan himself the high priest was sent to Rome with Ananias</i>. Jonathan was called by the title merely as having been previously high priest. He succeeded Caiaphas, and he was not high priest again afterwards, having expressly declined to resume the office. Nor can<i> any other Jonathan</i> have been elevated to it,—for Josephus gives,<i> in every case</i>, the elevation of a new high priest, and his whole number of twenty-eight from Herod the Great to the destruction of Jerusalem agrees with the notices thus given. So that this interpretation is untenable. (2) Chrysostom and most of the ancient commentators supposed that Paul, having been long absent, was really<i> unacquainted with the person of</i> the high priest. But this can hardly have been; and even if it were, the position and official seat would have pointed out, to one who had been himself a member of the Sanhedrim, the president of the council. (3) Calvin and others take the words<i> ironically: ‘I could not be supposed to know that one who conducted himself so cruelly and illegally, could be the high priest’</i> This surely needs no refutation, as being altogether out of place and character. (4) Bengel and others understand the words as an acknowledgment of rash and insubordinate language, and render, ‘<i>I did not give it a thought</i>,’ ‘<i>I forgot:</i>’ and so Dr. Wordsworth. But this is never the meaning of the word here used in the original; and were any pregnant or unusual sense intended, the context (as at 1 Thess. v. 12) would suggest it. (5) On the whole then, I believe that the only rendering open to us, consistently with the simple meaning of the words, and the facts of history is,<b> I did not know that it</b> (or he)<b> was the high priest:</b> and that it is probable that the solution of his ignorance lies in the fact of his<i> imperfect sight</i>—he heard the insolent order given, but knew not from whom it proceeded. I own that I am not entirely satisfied with this, as being founded perhaps on too slight premises: but as far as I can see there is no<i> positive</i> objection to it, which there is to every other. The objection stated by Dr. Wordsworth, “If St. Paul could not discern that Ananias was high priest, how could he see that he sat there as his judge?” would of course he easily answered by supposing that Paul, who had himself been a member of the Sanhedrim, may have known Ananias by his voice: or indeed may not (as above) have known him at all personally. It is hardly worth while to notice the rendering given by some, ‘I knew not that<i> there was a high priest</i>.’ Had any such meaning been intended, it would have been further specified by the construction. Besides which, it renders Paul’s apology irrelevant, by eliminating from it the person who is necessarily its subject.<br><br><b> for it is written</b>] Implying in this, ‘<i>and the law is the rule of my life</i>.’ Even in this we see the consummate skill of St. Paul.
