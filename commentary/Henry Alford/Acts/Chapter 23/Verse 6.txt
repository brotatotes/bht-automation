That<i> they</i> looked for this resurrection by right of being the seed of Abraham, and denied it to all others,—whereas<i> he</i> looked for it through Jesus whom they hated, in whom<i> all</i> should be made alive who had died in Adam,—this was<i> nothing to the present point:</i> the belief was common—in the truest sense it was the<i> hope of Israel</i>—in the truest sense does Paul use and bring it forward to confound the adversaries of Christ.
