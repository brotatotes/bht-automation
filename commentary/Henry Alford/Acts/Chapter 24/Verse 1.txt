 1.  μετὰ πέντε ἡμ .] After five days or on the fifth day from Paul’s  departure for Cæsarea . This would be the natural  terminus a quo from which to date the proceedings of the High Priest, &c., who were  left in Jerusalem. That it is so, appears from Acts 24:11 . See note there.
	 πρεσβ  .   τινῶν ] The more ancient MSS. reading this, all we can say is that we have not sufficient authority to retain the reading of the rec. τῶν πρεσβυτέρων , though it appears more likely to be original, and to have given offence as seeming to import that the  whole Sanhedrim went down. This is one of the cases where, in the present state of our evidence, we are obliged to adopt readings which are not according to subjective canons of criticism.
	 ῥήτορος ] An  orator forensis or  causidicus , persons who abounded in Rome and the provinces; sometimes called συνήγοροι , or δικολόγοι . Kuin. says: ‘Multi adolescentes Romani qui se foro dederant, cum magistratibus in provincias se conferebant, ut caussis provincialium agendis se exercerent, et majoribus in urbe actionibus præpararent.’ So Cælius (see Cic. pro Cælio, c. 30), in Africa.
	 Τερτύλλου ] A diminutive from Tertius, as Lucullus from Lucius, Catullus from Catius. The name occurs Plin. Ephesians 5:15 ; and  Tertulla , Suet. Aug [149] 69 (Wetst.).
	 [149]  Augustine, Bp. of Hippo , 395 430
	 ἐνεφάνισαν ] (not, ‘  appeared ,’ ἑαυτούς , sub.; see reff.)  laid information ; and, as it seems, not by writing, but by word of mouth, since they appeared in person, and Paul was called to confront them.
