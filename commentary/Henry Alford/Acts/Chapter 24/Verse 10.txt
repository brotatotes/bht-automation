<b> 10. of many years</b>] Felix was now in the seventh year of his procuratorship, which began in the twelfth year of Claudius, D.D. 52.— ‘The contrast between Tertullus’s and Paul’s winning favour with the judge is remarkable. The former I have characterized above. But the Apostle, using no flattery, yet alleges the one point which could really win attention to him from Felix, viz. his confidence arising from speaking before one<i> well skilled by experience in the manners and customs of the Jews</i>.<br><br><b> ll. twelve days</b>] The point of this seems to be, that Felix having been so long time a judge among the Jews, must be well able to search into and adjudicate on an offence whose whole course was comprised within so short a period.—The twelve days may be thus made out: 1. his arrival in Jerusalem, ch. xxi. 15–17; 2. his interview with James, ib. 18 ff; 3. his taking on him the vow, ib. 26; 3–7. the time of the vow, interrupted by—7. his apprehension, ch. xxi. 27; 8. his appearance before the Sanhedrim, ch. xxii. 30 ff; 9. his departure from Jerusalem (at night); and so to the 13th, the day now current, which was the 5th inclusive from his leaving Jerusalem. This is far more natural than to suppose that the days which he had already spent at Cæsarea are<i> not to be counted</i>, because his raising disturbances while in custody was out of the question.
