<b> 14.</b>] The<b> But</b> here has its peculiar force, of taking off the attention from what has immediately preceded, and raising a new point as more worthy of notice.<b> But</b>, ( ‘<i>if thou wouldst truly know the reason why they accuse me</i>’), this is the whole grievance.<br><br><b> heresy</b>, in allusion to the same word used by Tertullus, ver. 5. The word is capable of an indifferent or of a bad sense. Tertullus had used it in the latter. Paul explains what it really was.<br><br><b> the god of my fathers</b>] literally,<b> my paternal God</b> (see below). Notice in the words the skill of Paul. The term was one well known to the Greeks and Romans, and which would carry with it its own justification. The abandonment of a man’s national worship and attaching himself to strange gods and modes of worship was regarded unfavourably by the Romans: and the Jews had had their worship of their fathers’ God with their ancient national rites, again and again secured to them by decrees of magistrates and of the senate. In his address<i> to the Jews</i> (ch. xxii. 14) the similar expression, “<i>the God of our fathers</i>,” brings out more clearly those individual fathers, in whom Felix had no interest further than the identification of<i> Paul’s religion with that of his ancestors</i> required.
