<b> 15. they themselves</b>] literally,<b> these very men</b>. It would appear from this, that the High Priest and the deputation<i> were not of the Sadducees</i>. But perhaps this inference is too hasty; Paul might regard them as representing the whole Jewish people, and speak<i> generally</i>, as he does of the same hope ch. xxvi. 7, where he assigns it to “<i>our twelve tribes</i>.” The words “<i>of the dead</i>,” inserted here in some MSS. to fill up the meaning, are not likely to have been spoken by the Apostle. The juxtaposition of those words, which excited mockery even when the Gospel was being<i> directly preached</i>, would hardly have been hazarded in this defence, where every expression is so carefully weighed.
