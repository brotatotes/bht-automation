<p><strong> 18</strong> .] De W. observes, that ἡγνισμ . can only refer to προσφ ., not to ἐλεημ .: thus <strong> αἷς</strong> may have been altered to οἷς , to give a general neuter sense, <em> amidst which occupations</em> : and the sense will be <strong> among</strong> or <strong> engaged in which offerings:</strong> it being in the temple. But this seems far-fetched and unlikely, and Meyer’s supposition, that οἷς has been altered to αἷς to suit προσφοράς , certainly has an air of probability. The use of a verb referring to two substantives, to only one of which it is applicable, is too common to require illustration. But, as so often in this book, we must follow the best MSS., our only fixed evidence, as against any questionable subjective considerations.

<p>The construction is irregular. A subject to εὗρον has to be supplied by a reference to some nominative case implied in οὐ μετὰ ὄχ . οὐδ . μ . θορ ., thus: <strong> amidst which they found me purified in the temple, none who detected me in the act of raising a tumult … but certain Asiatic Jews.…</strong> This would leave it to be inferred that no legal officers had apprehended him, but certain private individuals, illegally; who besides had not come forward to substantiate any charge against him. Bornemann would supply οὐχ οὗτοι μέν before τινες δέ ; but the objection to this is, that the negative οὐ μετὰ ὄχ … stands already as the proper opponent clause to τινες δέ , and we should thus have two negative clauses together.

<p>On this sense of δέ , see Viger, ed. Hermann, p. 16, note 24; and Hermann’s note, p. 702. 19. The latter remarks, “intelligitur in hac formula, <em> quam malum, stultum est</em> , vel simile quid.”</p>
