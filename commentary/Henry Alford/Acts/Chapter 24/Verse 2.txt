<b> 2.</b>] Grotius tells us that it is among the precepts of the rhetoricians, to win the favour of a judge by praising him. Certainly Tertullus fulfils and overacts the precept, for his exordium is full of the basest flattery. Contrast with his “<i>great quietness</i>” and “<i>worthy deeds</i>,” the description of Tacitus, where he says that Felix, and Ventidius Cumanus, who ruled in Galilee, emulated one another in crimes and enormities. They carried out their mutual enmity by employing bands of robbers to slay and plunder, who sometimes met in open battle, and brought back their spoils to the procurator. Contrast also Josephus’s account of the inhabitants of Cæsarea sending a deputation to Rome to complain of the oppressions and enormities of Felix. There was just enough foundation for the flattery, to make the falsehood of its general application to Felix more glaring. He had put down some rebels (see ch. xxi. 38, note) and assassins, but, as Wetstein remarks, was himself worse than them all.
