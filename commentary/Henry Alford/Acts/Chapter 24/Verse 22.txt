<b> 22. having more perfect knowledge about the way</b>] not, ‘<i>till he should obtain</i> more<i></i> accurate knowledge’ (ungrammatical): nor, ‘<i>since he had now obtained</i>’ (viz. by Paul’s speech, which the words will not bear). But this, the only right rendering, is variously understood. Chrysostom says: “He adjourned the case purposely, not because he wanted information, but because he wished to put off the Jews. He was not willing to acquit the prisoner, for fear of them.” And nearly so Luther and others. But these interpretations, as De Wette observes, overlook the circumstance, that such a reason for adjournment would be as unfavourable to<i> Paul</i> as to the<i> Jews</i>. Meyer explains it, that he adjourned the case, ‘<i>because</i>,’&c. But this would imply that he was favourably disposed to<i> Paul</i>. The simplest explanation is that given by De Wette: He put them off to another time, not as requiring any more information about ‘the way,’<i> for that matter he knew before</i>,—but waiting for the arrival of Lysias.—Whether Lysias was expected, or summoned, or ever came to be heard, is very doubtful. The<i> real</i> motive of the<i> deferring</i> appears in ver. 26. The comparative “<b>more perfect</b>” implies, “more accurate than to need additional information.”
