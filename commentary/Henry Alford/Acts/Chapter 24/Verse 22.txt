<p><strong> ἀκρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἰδὼς τὰ π</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁδ</strong> .] These words will bear only one philologically correct interpretation, <strong> having more accurate knowledge about the way:</strong> not, ‘ <em> till he should obtain</em> more accurate knowledge’ (ungrammatical): nor, ‘ <em> since he had now obtained</em> ’ (viz. by Paul’s speech: but εἰδώς cannot be rendered ‘certior factus’). But this, the only right rendering, is variously understood. Chrys. says: ἐπίτηδες ὑπερέθετο (he adjourned the case purposely), οὐ δεόμενος μαθεῖν , ἀλλὰ διακρούσασθαι βουλόμενος τοὺς Ἰουδαίους . ἀφεῖναι οὐκ ἤθελε δι ʼ ἐκείνους . Luther and Wolf: “distulit, … non quod sectæ ignarus esset, aut pleniorem sibi notitiam ejus comparare vellet, sed quia, cum satis illam jam cognitam haberet, Judæos amplius sibi molestos esse nolebat.” But these interpretations, as De W. observes, overlook the circumstance, that such a reason for adjournment would be as unfavourable to <em> Paul</em> , as to the <em> Jews</em> . Meyer explains it, that he adjourned the case, ‘ <em> because</em> ,’ &amp;c. But this (De W.) would imply that he was favourably disposed to <em> Paul</em> . The simplest explanation is that given by De W.: He put them off to another time, not as requiring any more information about ‘the way,’ <em> for that matter he knew before</em> , but waiting for the arrival of Lysias. Whether Lysias was expected, or summoned, or ever came to be heard, is very doubtful. The <em> real</em> motive of the ‘ampliatio’ appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:26">Acts 24:26</span> . The comparative implies, “more accurate than to need additional information.”
