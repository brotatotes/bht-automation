But this, the only right rendering, is variously understood. Chrys. says: ἐπίτηδες ὑπερέθετο (he adjourned the case purposely), οὐ δεόμενος μαθεῖν , ἀλλὰ διακρούσασθαι βουλόμενος τοὺς Ἰουδαίους . ἀφεῖναι οὐκ ἤθελε δι ʼ ἐκείνους . Luther and Wolf: “distulit, … non quod sectæ ignarus esset, aut pleniorem sibi notitiam ejus comparare vellet, sed quia, cum satis illam jam cognitam haberet, Judæos amplius sibi molestos esse nolebat.” But these interpretations, as De W. observes, overlook the circumstance, that such a reason for adjournment would be as unfavourable to  Paul , as to the  Jews . Meyer explains it, that he adjourned the case, ‘  because ,’ &c. But this (De W.) would imply that he was favourably disposed to  Paul . The simplest explanation is that given by De W.: He put them off to another time, not as requiring any more information about ‘the way,’  for that matter he knew before , but waiting for the arrival of Lysias. Whether Lysias was expected, or summoned, or ever came to be heard, is very doubtful. The  real motive of the ‘ampliatio’ appears in Acts 24:26 . The comparative implies, “more accurate than to need additional information.”
