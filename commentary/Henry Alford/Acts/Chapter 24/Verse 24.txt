<b> 24. when Felix came</b>] Into the hall or chamber where Paul was to speak.<br><br><b> Drusilla</b>] She was daughter of Herod Agrippa I. (see ch. xii.) and of Cypros,—and sister of Agrippa II. She was betrothed at six years old to Epiphanes son of Antiochus, king of Commagéné; but he declining the marriage, not wishing to be circumcised and become a Jew, she was married to the more obsequious Azizus, king of Emesa. Not long after, Felix, being enamoured of her beauty, persuaded her, by means of a certain Simon, a Cyprian magician (see note on ch. viii. 9), to leave her husband and live with him. She bore him a son, Agrippa: and both mother and son perished in an eruption of Vesuvius, in the reign of Titus.—The Drusilla mentioned by Tacitus, a granddaughter of Antony and Cleopatra, must have been<i> another wife</i> of Felix, who was<i> thrice</i> married, and each time to persons of royal birth; Suetonius calls him “<i>the husband of three queens.</i>”
