<b> 26.</b>] The Julian law enacted that no one should receive any consideration for throwing a man into prison, for putting him into bonds, or releasing him, or for a condemnation or an acquittal. Mr. Humphry observes, that Albinus, who succeeded Festus, so much encouraged this kind of bribery, that no malefactors remained in prison, except those who did not offer money for their liberation. St. Paul did not resort to this mode of shortening his tedious and unjust imprisonment, and Tertullian quotes his conduct in this respect against those who were disposed to purchase escape from persecution: a practice which prevailed and became great evil in the time of Cyprian.
