<b> 6.</b>] Considerable difficulty rests on the omission of the words here put in brackets. Their absence from the principal MSS., their many variations in those which contain them, are strongly against their genuineness; as also is the consideration that no probable reason for their omission can be suggested. Onthe other hand, as De Wette observes, it is hardly imaginable that so little should have been assigned to the speaker, as would be if these words were omitted. Besides this, the words<b> whom we took</b> seem to require some sequel, some reason, after his seizure, why he was there present and freed from Jewish durance. The phenomena are common enough in the Acts, of unaccountable<i> insertions</i>; but in this place it is the<i> omission</i> which is unaccountable, for no similarity of ending, no doctrinal consideration can have led to it.
