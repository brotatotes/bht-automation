 10. ] Paul’s refusal has a positive and a negative ground 1. ‘  Cœsar’s tribunal is my proper place of judgment : 2.  To the Jews I have done no harm, and they have therefore no claim to judge me ’ (De W.).
	 ἐπ  .   τ  .   β  .   Καίς  . ] Meyer quotes from Ulpian, “Quæ acta gestaque sunt a procuratore Cæsaris sic ab eo comprobantur, atque si a Cæsare ipso gesta sint.” In  οὗ με δεῖ κρίνεσθαι , Wordsworth has again fallen into the mistake of supposing  με (and again in Act 25:11 ) to be emphatic (see note, Mat 16:18 ), which it cannot possibly be under any circumstances. The form of the sentence which would express the sense built by him on this error, would be, οὗ δεῖ ἐμὲ κριθῆναι , or οὗ ἐμὲ δεῖ κριθῆναι . But the sense, when thus given, surely is wholly alien from the person speaking and from the situation: as is also the understanding δεῖ as alluding to divine intimation made to him. The δεῖ is simply of his right as a Roman citizen: the με simply enclitic, and of no rhetorical force at all.

Here, the ellipsis would be readily supplied from Festus’s own speech, which appeared to assume that there was some ground of trial before the Sanhedrim. κάλλιον will therefore mean,  better than thou choosest to confess . We have an ellipsis of the same kind in our phrase ‘  to know better .’ Or it may be in this case as in 2 Timothy 1:18 , ‘  better, than that I need say more on it :’ but I prefer the other interpretation.
