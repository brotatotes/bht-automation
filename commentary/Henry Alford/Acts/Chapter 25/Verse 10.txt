<b> 10.</b>] Paul’s refusal has a positive and a negative ground—l. ‘<i>Cæsar’s tribunal is my proper place of judgment:</i> 2.<i> To the Jews I have done no harm, and they have therefore no claim to judge me.</i>’<br><br><b> I stand at Cæsar’s judgment seat</b>] Meyer quotes from Ulpian, “What is done hy a procurator of Cæsar, is approved as if it were done by Cæsar himself.”<br><br><b> as thou very well knowest</b>] literally,<b> knowest better than thou choosest to confess</b>. We have an ellipsis of the same kind in our phrase ‘<i>to know better</i>.’ Or it may be in this case as in 2 Tim. i. 18, ‘<i>better, than that I need say more on</i><i> it:</i>’ but I prefer the other interpretation.
