<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] Both readings, εἰ μὲν <strong> γάρ</strong> , and εἰ μὲν <strong> οὖν</strong> , will suit the sense. In the former case, it is, ‘ <em> For if I am an offender</em> , …:’ in the latter, <strong> If, now, I am an offender</strong> …, taking up the supposition <em> generally</em> , after having denied the <em> particular</em> case of his having <em> offended the Jews</em> . Meyer and De Wette are at issue about the internal probability of these readings: I am disposed to agree with Meyer that a difficulty was felt in the οὖν (no expression is more frequently misunderstood and altered than μὲν οὖν ) and it was corrected into γάρ . This εἰ assumes the <em> conviction</em> after proof; as the following <strong> εἰ</strong> does the <em> acquittal</em> .

<p><strong> οὐ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> με δύν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Said of <em> legal</em> possibility: ‘non fas est aliquem.…’ The dilemma here put by Paul is, “ <em> If I am guilty, it is not by them, but by Cœsar, that I must be</em> ( <em> and am willing to be</em> ) <em> tried, sentenced, and punished. If I am innocent, and Cœsar acquits me, then clearly none will be empowered to give me up to them: therefore, at all events, guilty or innocent, I am not to be made their victim</em> .”

<p><strong> Καίς</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐπικαλ</strong> .] <strong> I call upon</strong> , i.e. <em> appeal to</em> (provoco ad) <strong> Cæsar</strong> . This power (of ‘provocatio ad <em> populum</em> ’) having existed in very early times (e.g. the case of Horatius, Livy i. 26), was ensured to Roman citizens by the Lex Valeria (see Livy ii. 8, U.C. 245), suspended by the Decemviri, but solemnly re-established after their deposition (Liv. iii. 55, U.C. 305), when it was decreed that it should be unlawful to make any magistrate from whom there did not lie an appeal. When the emperors absorbed the power of the populus and the tribunitial veto in themselves, the ‘provocatio ad populum’ and ‘appellatio ad tribunos’ were both made to the <em> princeps</em> . See Smith’s Dict. of Antt. art. Appellatio. In Pliny’s celebrated Epistle respecting the Bithynian Christians (x. 97), we read, “Fuerunt alii similis amentiæ: quos, quia cives Romani erant, adnotavi in urbem remittendos.”</p>
