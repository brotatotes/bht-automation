<b> 11. no man may</b> (literally,<b> can</b>)<b> deliver me</b>] Said of<i> legal</i> possibility: “it is not lawful for any man....” The dilemma here put by St. Paul is, “<i>If I am guilty, it is not by them, but by Cæsar, that I must be (and am willing to be) tried, sentenced, and punished. If I am innocent, and Cæsar acquits me, then clearly none will be empowered to give me up to them: therefore, at all events, guilty or innocent, I am not to be made their victim</i>.”<br><br><b> I appeal unto Cæsar</b>] lite-rally,<b> I call upon</b>, i.e.<i> appeal to</i><b> Cæsar</b>. This power (of appeal to the<i> people</i>) having existed in very early times was ensured to Roman citizens by the Lex Valeria in the year of Rome 245, suspended by the Decemviri, but solemnly re-established after their deposition A.U. C. 305, when it was decreed that it should be unlawful to make any magistrate from whom there did not lie an appeal. When the emperors absorbed the<i> power of the people</i> and the<i> tribunitial veto</i> in themselves, the appeals to the people and to the tribunes were both made to the emperor. In Pliny’s celebrated Epistle to the Emperor Trajan respecting the Bithynian Christians, we read, “Others shared in the like madness, whom, as they were Roman citizens, I noted to be sent to the metropolis.”<b> 12. the council</b>] The<i> convention</i>, or assembly of citizens in the provinces, assembled to try causes on the<i> court-days</i>, see ch. xix. 38. A certain number of these were chosen as jurymen, for the particular causes, by the proconsul, and these were called his ‘<i>councillors</i>,’ or ‘<i>assessors</i>.’ So in Josephus, Cestius, on receiving an application from Jerusalem respecting the conduct of Florus, took counsel with his<i> assessors</i>, or<i> council</i>. He consulted them, to decide whether the appeal was to be conceded, or if conceded, to be at once acted on. The law provided that if the matter did not admit of delay, the appeal was not allowed.<br><br> The sense is stronger and better without a question after the first clause of Festus’s answer.—Thus were the two—the design of Paul (ch. xix. 21), and the promise of our Lord to him (ch. xxiii. 11)—brought to their fulfilment, by a combination of providential circumstances. We can hardly say that these must have<i> influenced</i> Paul in making his appeal: that step is naturally accounted for, and was rendered necessary by the difficulties which now beset him: but we may be sure that the prospect at length, after his long and tedious imprisonment, of<i> seeing Rome</i>, must at this time have cheered him, and caused him to hear the decision of Festus, “To Cæsar shalt thou go,” with no small emotion.
