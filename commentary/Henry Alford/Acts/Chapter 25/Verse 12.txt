 12.  συμβουλίου ] The ‘  conventus ,’ or σύνοδος of citizens in the provinces, assembled to try causes on the ἀγοραῖοι ( ἡμέραι ), see ch. Acts 19:38 . A certain number of these were chosen as judices, for the particular causes, by the proconsul, and these were called his ‘  consiliarii ’ (Suet. Tib. 33), or ‘  assessores ’ ( πάρεδροι , Suet. Galba 19). So in Jos. (B. J. ii. 16. 1), Cestius, on receiving an application from Jerusalem respecting the conduct of Florus, μετὰ ἡγεμόνων ἐβουλεύετο , i.e. with his assessors, or συμβούλιον . He consulted them to decide whether the appeal was to be conceded, or if conceded, to be at once acted on. (Mr. Lewin cites from the Digests, xlix. 5. 7: ‘Si res dilationem non recipiat, non permittitur appellare.’)
	The sense is stronger and better without a question at ἐπικέκλησαι . Thus were the two the design of Paul (ch. Act 19:21 ), and the promise of our Lord to him (ch. Act 23:11 ) brought to their fulfilment, by a combination of providential circumstances. We can hardly say, with De W. and Meyer, that these must have  influenced Paul in making his appeal; that step is naturally accounted for, and was rendered necessary by the difficulties which now beset him; but we may be sure that the prospect at length, after his long and tedious imprisonment, of  seeing Rome , must at this time have cheered him, and caused him to hear the ἐπὶ Καίσαρα πορεύσῃ of Festus with no small emotion.
