<b> 13.</b>] HEROD AGRIPPA II., son of the Herod of ch. xii. (see note on ver. 1 there), was at Rome, and seventeen only, when his father died. Claudius was about to send him to succeed to the kingdom, but was dissuaded by his freedmen and favourites, and sent Cuspius Fadus as procurator instead. Soon after, Claudius gave him the principality of Chaleis, which had been held by his uncle Herod,—the presidency of the temple nt Jerusalem and of its treasures,—and the appointment of the High Priest. Some years after the same emperor added to his jurisdiction the former tetrarchy of Philip, and Batanæa, Trachonítis, and Abiléné, with the title of<i> King</i>. Nero afterwards annexed Tiberias, Tarichéa, Julias, and fourteen neighbouring villages to his kingdom. He built a large palace at Jerusalem; but offended the Jews by constructing it so as to overlook the temple, and by his capricious changes in the high priesthood,—and was not much esteemed by them. When the last war broke out, he attached himself throughout to the Romans. He died in the third year of Trajan, and fifty-first of his reign, aged about seventy.
