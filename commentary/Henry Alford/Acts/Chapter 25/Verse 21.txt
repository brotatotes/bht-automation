<b> 21. Augustus</b> (in the Greek,<b> Sebastos</b>)] This title was first conferred by the senate on Octavianus, and borne by all succeeding emperors. Dio Cassius says: “<b>Augustus</b> implies that he was something more than man: for all most revered and sacred things are called<i> august</i>. Whence also they called him<b> Sebastos</b>, after the Greek manner, as<i> one to be adored</i>, from<i> sebazomai</i>, to adore.”
