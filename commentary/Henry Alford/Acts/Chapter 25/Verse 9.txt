 9. ]  κριθῆναι , the aor., refers to the  one act , of  deciding finally concerning these charges. This not having been seen, the later MSS. have substituted κρίνεσθαι , which is more ‘  going to law,’ ‘being involved in a trial.’
	The question is asked of Paul as a Roman citizen, having a right to be tried by Roman law: and more is contained in it, than at first meets the eye. It  seems to propose only a change of  place ; but doubtless in the  ἐκεῖ κριθῆναι was contained by implication a sentence pronounced by the Sanhedrim.  ἐπ  ʼ   ἐμοῦ may mean no more than ἐπὶ σοῦ , ch. Acts 26:2 , viz., that the procurator would  be present and sanction the trial: so Grot., “visne a synedrio judicari me præsente?” Otherwise, a journey to Jerusalem would be superfluous. Festus may very probably have anticipated the rejection of this proposal by Paul, and have wished to make it appear that the obstacle in the way of Paul being tried by the Sanhedrim arose not from  him , but from the prisoner himself.
