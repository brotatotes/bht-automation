<b> 9.</b>] The question is asked of Paulas a Roman citizen, having a right to be tried by Roman law: and more is contained in it, than at first meets the eye. It<i> seems</i> to propose only a change of<i> place</i>; but doubtless in it was contained by implication a sentence pronounced by the Sanhedrim. The words<b> before me</b> may mean no more than that the procurator would be<i> present</i> and sanction the trial: Grotius interprets it “wilt thou be judged by the Sanhedrim in my presence?” Otherwise, a journey to Jerusalem would be superfluous. Festus may very probably have anticipated the rejection, of this proposal by Paul, and have wished to make it appear that the obstacle in the way of Paul being tried by the Sanhedrim arose not from<i> him</i>, but from the prisoner himself.
