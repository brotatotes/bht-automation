<p><strong> 14. </strong> <strong> τῇ Ἑβρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> διαλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] These words are expressed here only. In ch. 9 (see note) we have the <em> fact</em> remarkably preserved by the Hebrew form Σαούλ ; in ch. 22 he was speaking in Hebrew (Syro-Chald.), and the notice was not required. (Beware again of the supposed emphatic με of Wordsworth.)

<p><strong> σκληρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σοι πρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This is found here only; in ch. 9 the words are spurious, having been inserted from this place. The metaphor is derived from oxen at plough or drawing a burden, who, on being pricked with the goad, kick against it, and so cause it to pierce deeper. (See Schol. on Pind. I. c. below.) It is a Greek, and not (apparently) a Hebrew proverb; but this is no reason why it should not be used in Hebrew, just as it is in Latin. Instances of its use are Pind. Pyth. ii. 173: χρὴ δὲ πρὸς θεὸν οὐκ ἐρίζειν … φέρειν δ ʼ ἐλαφρῶς ἐπαυχένιον λαβόντα ζυγὸν ἀρήγει . ποτὶ κέντρον δέ τοι λακτιζέμεν τελέθει ὀλισθηρὸς οἶμος . Æschyl. Agam. 1633: πρὸς κέντρα μὴ λάκτιζε , μὴ πήσας μογῇς . Eurip. Bacch. 791: θυμούμενος πρὸς κέντρα λακτίζοιμι , θνητὸς ὢν θεῷ . See also Æsch. Prom. 323, and other examples in Wetst.; Plautus (Truc. iv. 2. 59); and Terence, Phorm. i. 2. 27: ‘Nam quæ inscitia est advorsum stimulum calces?’</p>
