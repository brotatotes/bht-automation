<b> 14. in the Hebrew tongue</b>] These words are expressed here only. In ch. ix. we have the<i> fact</i> remarkably preserved by the Hebrew form in the original; in ch. xxii. he was speaking in Hebrew, and the notice was not required.<br><br><b> it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks</b>] This is found here only; in ch. ix. the words are spurious, having been inserted from this place. The metaphor is derived from oxen at plough or drawing a burden, who, on being pricked with the goad, kick against it, and so cause it to pierce deeper. See instances, in my Greek Test., of the use of the proverb.
