 16. ]  εἰς τοῦτο refers to what follows, προχειρ . &c.,  γάρ gives the reason for ἀνάστηθι , &c. (Meyer.)
	 προχειρ .] See reff.
	 μάρτυρα ὧν τε εἶδες ] Stier remarks, that Paul was the witness of the  glory of Christ : whereas Peter, the first of the former twelve, describes himself ( 1Pe 5:1 ) as ‘a witness of the  sufferings of Christ, and a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.’ So true it was that this ἔκτρωμα among the Apostles, became, by divine grace,  more than they all ( 1Co 15:8-10 ). The expression ὑπηρέτην ὧν εἶδες may be compared with ὑπηρέται τοῦ λόγου , which Luke calls the αὐτόπται , Luke 1:2 .
	 ὧν τε ὀφθήσομαί σοι ] (1) ὀφθ . must be  passive , not (as Bornemann, Winer (not in edn. 6, § 39. 3, remark 1), Wahl, al.) causative (‘videre faciam’), but as E. V.,  I will appear  unto thee . (2) the gen. is exactly paralleled (Meyer) by Soph. Œd. Tyr. 788, ὧν μὲν ἱκόμην = τούτων (rather ἐκείνων ) δι ʼ ἃ ἱκόμην . So here ὧν = τούτων ( ἐκείνων ) δι ʼ ἃ ὀφθ .,  the things in (or  on account of) which I will appear to thee . That such visions did take place, we know, from ch. Acts 18:9 ; Acts 22:18 ; Acts 23:11 ; 2 Corinthians 12:1 ; Galatians 1:12 .
