<p><strong> μάρτυρα ὧν τε εἶδες</strong> ] Stier remarks, that Paul was the witness of the <em> glory of Christ</em> : whereas Peter, the first of the former twelve, describes himself ( 1Pe 5:1 ) as ‘a witness of the <em> sufferings</em> of Christ, and a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.’ So true it was that this ἔκτρωμα among the Apostles, became, by divine grace, <em> more than they all</em> ( 1Co 15:8-10 ). The expression ὑπηρέτην ὧν εἶδες may be compared with ὑπηρέται τοῦ λόγου , which Luke calls the αὐτόπται , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:2">Luke 1:2</span> .

<p><strong> ὧν τε ὀφθήσομαί σοι</strong> ] (1) ὀφθ . must be <em> passive</em> , not (as Bornemann, Winer (not in edn. 6, § 39. 3, remark 1), Wahl, al.) causative (‘videre faciam’), but as E. V., <strong> I will</strong> appear <strong> unto thee</strong> . (2) the gen. is exactly paralleled (Meyer) by Soph. Œd. Tyr. 788, ὧν μὲν ἱκόμην = τούτων (rather ἐκείνων ) δι ʼ ἃ ἱκόμην . So here ὧν = τούτων ( ἐκείνων ) δι ʼ ἃ ὀφθ ., <strong> the things in</strong> (or <strong> on account of) which I will appear to thee</strong> .
