<p><strong> 18. </strong> <strong> τοῦ ἐπιστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] not, as Beza, and E. V., ‘ <em> to turn them</em> :’ but, <strong> that they may turn</strong> ; see ἐπιστρέφειν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:20">Acts 26:20</span> .

<p>The general reference of οὕς becomes tacitly modified (not expressly, speaking as he was to the Jew Agrippa) by the expression σκότος and ἐξουσία τοῦ σατανᾶ , both, in the common language of the Jews, applicable only to the Gentiles. But in reality, and in Paul’s mind, they had their sense as applied to Jews, who were in spiritual darkness and under Satan’s power, however little they thought it. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:13">Colossians 1:13</span> .

<p><strong> τοῦ λαβ</strong> .] A <em> third step</em> : first the <em> opening of the eyes</em> next, <em> the turning to God</em> next, the <em> receiving remission of sins</em> and <em> a place among the sanctified</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:32">Acts 20:32</span> .

<p>Thus the great object of Paul’s preaching was to awaken and shew the necessity and efficacy of πίστις ἡ εἰς ἐμέ . And fully, long ere this, had he recognized and acted on this his great mission. The epistles to the Galatians and Romans are two noble monuments of the APOSTLE OF FAITH.</p>
