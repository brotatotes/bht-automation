But in reality, and in Paul’s mind, they had their sense as applied to Jews,—who were in spiritual darkness and under Satan’s power, however little they thought it. See Col. i. 13.<br><br><b> that they may receive</b>] A<i> third step:</i> first the<i> opening of the eyes</i>—next,<i> the turning to God</i>—next, the<i> receiving remission of sins and a place among the sanctified;</i> see ch. xx. 32.—This last reference determines the words<b> by faith that is in me</b> to belong, not to<b> sanctified</b>, but to<b> receive</b>.—Thus the great object of Paul's preaching was to awaken and shew the necessity and efficacy of<i> faith that is in Christ</i>. And fully, long ere this, had he recognized and acted on this his great mission. The epistles to the Galatians and Romans are two noble monuments of the APOSTLE OF FAITH.
