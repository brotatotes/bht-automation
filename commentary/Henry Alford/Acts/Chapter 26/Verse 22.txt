 22. ] The οὖν refers to the whole course of deliverances which he had had from God, not merely to the last. It serves to close the narrative, by shewing how it was that he was there that day, after such repeated persecutions, crowned by this last attempt to destroy him.
	 μαρτυρόμενος ] The mere love of paradox and difficulty, as it seems to me, has led De Wette and Meyer to prefer the ordinary reading - ρούμενος , although very weakly supported by MSS., and yielding hardly any appropriate sense. μαρτυρ  ού μενος  must be passive , and signify (see reff. below) ‘  testified to ,’ ‘  borne witness of :’ the datives μικρῷ and μεγάλῳ must be the agents, ‘  by small and great ’ (to which there is no objection grammatically, but every objection analogically, see ch. Acts 10:22 ; Acts 16:2 ; Acts 22:12 , in all which μαρτύρουμαι is followed by ὑπό ), and λέγων must be predicative, ‘  as saying :’ i.e., ‘  that I say .’ But this would be contrary to the fact: Paul was  not thus borne witness of by all , but on the contrary accused of being a despiser of the law by a great majority of his own countrymen. There can, I think, be no question either critically or exegetically of the correctness of the other reading μαρτυρόμενος ,  bearing witness , as directly appropriate to the office to which Paul was appointed, that of a  witness ( Act 26:16 ); and then μικρῷ τε καὶ μεγάλῳ ,  to small and great , so flat and meaningless on the other interpretation, admirably suits the occasion, standing as he was before an assembly of the greatest of the land.
