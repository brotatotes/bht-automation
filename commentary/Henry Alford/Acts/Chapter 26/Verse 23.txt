 23.   εἰ ] not for ὅτι but just as in Acts 26:8 ,  if  if at least : meaning, that the things following were patent facts to those who knew the prophets. See Hebrews 7:15 , where εἰ has the same sense.
	 παθητός ] not, as Beza, ‘  Christum fuisse passurum ’ (so E. V., ‘  should suffer ’): but as Vulg., ‘  si passibilis Christus .’ Paul does not refer to the prophetic announcement, or the historical reality, of the  fact of Christ’s suffering, but to the  idea of the Messiah as  passible and suffering being in accordance with the testimony of the prophets. That the fact of His having suffered on the cross was in the Apostle’s mind, can hardly be doubted: but that the words do not assert it, is evident from the change of construction in the next clause, where the fact of the bringing life and immortality to light by the resurrection is spoken of, εἰ παθητὸς ὁ χρ .,  εἰ  …   μέλλει καταγγέλλειν . In Justin Martyr, Trypho c. 89, p. 187, the following words are put into the month of Trypho the Jew: παθητὸν τὸν χριστόν , ὅτι αἱ γραφαί κηρύσσουσι , φανερόν ἐστι . See also the same, Trypho c. 36, p. 133, and c. 76, p. 173.
	 πρῶτος ἐξ ἀναστάσεως = πρῶτος ἀναστάς , or πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν , Colossians 1:18 , but implying that this light, to be preached to the Jews ( ὁ λαός ) and Gentiles, must arise  from the resurrection of the dead, and that Christ,  the first ἐξ ἀναστάσεως , was to announce it. See Isaiah 42:6 ; Isaiah 49:6 ; Isaiah 60:1-3 ; Luke 2:32 ; ch. Acts 13:47 .
