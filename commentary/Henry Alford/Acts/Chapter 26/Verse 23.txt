<b> 23. If</b> (not, “<i>that</i>,” as A.V.)] meaning, that the things following were patent facts to those who knew the prophets. See Heb. vii. 15 (marginal rendering), where<i> if</i> has the same sense.<br><br> The first thing which was thus patent was not, as Beza, and A.V., “<i>that Christ should suffer:</i>” but<b> that Christ was liable to suffering</b>. St. Paul does not refer to the prophetic announcement, or the historical reality, of the<i> fact</i> of Christ’s suffering, but to the<i> idea</i> of the Messiah, as<i> passible</i> and suffering, being in accordance with the testimony of the prophets. That the fact of His having suffered on the cross was in the Apostle’s mind, can hardly be doubted: but that the words do not assert it, is evident from the change of construction in the next clause, where the fact of the bringing life and immortality to light by the resurrection is spoken of.<br><br><b> first rising from the dead</b>] literally,<b> first from the resurrection of the dead:</b> implying that this light, to be preached to the Jews (<b>the people</b>) and Gentiles, must spring<i> from the resurrection</i> of the dead, and that Christ<i> the first from the resurrection</i>, was to announce it. See Isa. xlii. 6; xlix. 6; lx. 1, 2, 3; Luke ii. 32; ch. xiii. 47.
