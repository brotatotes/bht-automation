<b> 24.</b>] The words<b> as he thus spake for himself</b> must refer to the last words spoken by Paul: but it is not necessary to suppose that<i> these only</i> produced the effect described on Festus. Mr. Humphry remarks, “Festus was probably not so well acquainted as his predecessor (ch. xxiv. 10) with the character of the nation over which he had recently been called to preside. Hence he avails himself of Agrippa’s assistance (xxv. 26). Hence also he is unable to comprehend the earnestness of St. Paul, so unlike the indifference with which religious and moral subjects were regarded by the upper classes at Rome. His self-love suggests to him, that one who presents such a contrast to his own apathy, must be mad: the convenient hypothesis that much learning had produced this result, may have occurred to him on hearing Paul quote prophecies in proof of his assertions.”
