<b> 28.</b>] These words of Agrippa have been very variously explained. I have discussed the proposed renderings in the note in my Greek Test. From that it appears that the rendering of the A.V. is inadmissible, for want of any example of the original expression bearing this meaning: and that the rendering in the margin seems to suit best both the words and the context. It appears also that Agrippa is characterizing<i> no effect on himself</i>, but what Paul was fancying in his mind, reckoning on the<i> persuasion</i> which he had expressed above (ver. 26): and that he speaks of something<i> not</i> that he is<i> likely to become,</i> but that<i> contrasts strangely with his present worldly position and intentions.</i> I would therefore render the words thus:<b> Lightly</b> (with small trouble)<b> art thou persuading thyself that thou canst make me a Christian:</b> and understand them, in connexion with Paul’s having attempted to make Agrippa a witness on his side,— ‘<i>I am not so easily to be made a Christian of, as thou supposest.</i>’
