<b> 5. the strictest sect</b>] See ch. xxii. 3. Josephus calls the Pharisees “a sect of the Jews professing to be more devout than other men, and to observe the laws more strictly.” The use of the term finds another example in Eph. v. 15, which is literally, “<i>See ye walk</i><b> strictly</b>.” The word rendered<i> sect</i> is the same as that rendered in ch, xxiv. 5, 14 “heresy,” here used in an indifferent sense.
