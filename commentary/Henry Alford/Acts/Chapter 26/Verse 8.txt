<p><strong> 8.</strong> ] Having impressed on his hearers the injustice of this charge from the Jews, with reference to his holding that hope which they themselves held, he now leaves much to be filled up, not giving a confession of his own faith, but proceeding as if it were well understood. ‘You assume rightly, that I mean by <em> this hope</em> , in my own case, my believing it accomplished in the crucified and risen Jesus of Nazareth.’ Then, this being acknowledged, he goes on to shew how his own view became so changed with regard to Jesus; drawing, by the μὲν οὖν ( Act 26:9 ), a contrast in some respects between <em> himself</em> , who was supernaturally brought to the faith, and <em> them</em> , who yet could not refuse to believe that God could and might raise the dead. All this he mainly addresses to Agrippa ( Act 26:26 ), as being the best acquainted with the circumstances, and, from his position, best qualified to judge of them. It may be, as Stier suggests, that if not open, <em> yet practical</em> Sadduceism had tainted the Herodian family. Paul knew, at all events, how generally the highly cultivated, and those in power and wealth, despised and thought ἄπιστον the doctrine of the resurrection.

<p><strong> εἰ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ἐγείρει</strong> ] not, as commonly rendered, ‘ <em> that God should raise the dead</em> ’ (E. V.): but the question is far stronger than this, if the conjunction be taken in its literal meaning: <strong> why is it judged by you a thing past belief, if God raises the dead?</strong> i.e. ‘ <em> if God, in His exercise of power, sees fit to raise the dead</em> (the word implying that such a fact <em> has veritably taken place), is it for you to refuse to believe it</em> ?’ Compare the declaration of our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:31">Luke 16:31</span> ; οὐδ ʼ ἐάν τις ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῇ πεισθήσονται . We have many instances of this use of εἰ : Xen. Mem. i. 1. 13, ἐθαύμαζε δὲ εἰ μὴ φανερὸν αὐτοῖς ἐστίν : ib. 18, ὅσα δὲ πάντες ᾔδεσαν , θαυμαστὸν εἰ μὴ τούτων ἐνεθυμήθησαν : ib. i. 2. 13, ἐγὼ δ ʼ εἰ μέν τι κακὸν ἐκείνῳ τὴν πόλιν ἐποιησάτην οὐκ ἀπολογήσομαι : on which examples Hermann remarks, ad Viger. p. 504, “in his locis omnibus rem non dubiam et incertam indicat εἰ , sed plane certam et perspicuam.”</p>
