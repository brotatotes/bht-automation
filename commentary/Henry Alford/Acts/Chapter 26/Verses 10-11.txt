<p><strong> 10, 11.</strong> ] This is the διωγμὸς μέγας of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span> . We are surprised here by the unexpected word ἁγίων , which it might have been thought he would have rather in this presence avoided. But, as Stier remarks, it belongs to the more confident tone of this speech, which he delivers, not as a <em> prisoner defending himself</em> , but as one being heard before those who were his <em> audience, not his Judges</em> . <strong> κατήνεγκα ψῆφον</strong> can hardly be taken <em> figuratively</em> , as many Commentators, trying to escape from the inference that the νεανίας Saul was a member of the Sanhedrim; but must be understood as testifying to <em> this very fact</em> , however strange it may seem. He can hardly have been <em> less than</em> thirty when sent on his errand of persecution to Damascus. The genitive is supposed by Elsner and Kypke to be dependent on κατήνεγκα ; but this is harsh, and it is better to take (as most Commentators, and Meyer, and De W.) it as absolute, and κατήνεγκα as <em> local</em> , ‘ <em> detuli sententiam</em> :’ <strong> when their deaths were being compassed, I gave in my vote</strong> (scil, <em> against</em> them, as in ref.). On the fact, cf. συνευδοκῶν τῇ ἀναιρέσει αὐτοῦ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span> .</p>
