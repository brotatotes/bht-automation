Acts 9:15 ; see also ch. Acts 22:15-16 . Nor can this, on the strictest view, be considered any deviation from truth. It is what all must more or less do who are abridging a narrative, or giving the general sense of things said at various times. There were reasons for its being minute and particular in the  details of his conversion ; that once related, the commission which he thereupon received is not followed into  its details, but  summed up as committed to him by the Lord himself .

The message delivered by Ananias certainly furnished some of them; and the unmistakeable utterings of God’s Spirit ( τὸ πνεῦμα Ἰησοῦ , ch. Act 16:7 ) which supernaturally led him, may have furnished more, all within the limits of truth.
