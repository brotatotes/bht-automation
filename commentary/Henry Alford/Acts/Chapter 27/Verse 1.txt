<b> CHAP. XXVII. 1–XXVIII. 31</b>] PAUL’ S VOYAGE TO ROME AND SOJOURN THERE. I cannot but express the benefit I have derived in my commentary on this section, from Mr. Smith’s now well-known treatise on the voyage and shipwreck of St. Paul: as also from various letters which he has from time to time put into my hands, tending further to elucidate the subject. The substance of these will be found embodied in an Appendix following the chronological table in the Introduction to the Acts.<br><br><b> 1. that we should sail</b>] Here we have again the<i> first person</i>, the narrator having, in all probability, remained in Palestine, and in the neighbourhood of Paul, during the interval since ch. xxi. 18.<br><br><b> they delivered Paul</b>]<i> Who?</i> perhaps the assessors with whom Festus took counsel on the appeal, ch. xxv. 12: but more likely the plural is used indefinitely, the subject being ‘they,’ as ‘<i>on</i>’ in French, or ‘<i>man</i>’ in German.<br><br><b> of Augustus’ band</b>] There is some difficulty in determining what this cohort was. More than one of the<i> legions</i> at different times bore the honorary title ‘Augusta:’ but of a ‘<i>cohort</i> Augusta,’ or ‘Augustana,’ we never hear. It appears likely (see my Greek Test.) that there was a band of picked men called by this name and stationed at Rome for the special body-guard of the emperor. To this Julius seems to have belonged,—to have been sent on some service into Asia, and now to have been returning to Rome.
