<b> 12.</b>] See above on ver. 8. The anchorage was sheltered from the N.W., but not from<i> nearly half the compass</i>.<br><br><b> Phenicé</b>] or more properly<b> Phœnix</b>. Ptolemy calls the haven<i> Phœnicus</i>, and the city (lying some way inland)<i> Phœnix</i>. Strabo describes an isthmus about twelve miles wide, having on the north side a port called Amphimallia, and on the south, Phœnicé. This description, and the other data belonging to Phœnice, Smith (p. 48) has shewn to fit the modern<i> Lutro</i>, which, though not known now as an anchorage, probably from the silting up of the harbour, is so marked in the French admiralty chart of 1738, and “if then able to shelter the smallest craft, must have. been capable of receiving the largest ships seventeen centuries before.” Mr. Smith gives an inscription, making it highly probable that Alexandrian ships did winter at Lutro.<br><br><b> looking to the north east and the south east</b>]<b> looking</b> (literally)<b> down the S.W. and N.W. winds;</b> i.e.<i> in the direction</i> of these winds, viz. N.E. and S.E. For the S.W. and N.W. here mentioned in the original are<i> not quarters of the compass</i>, but<i> winds</i>; and<b> down</b>, used with a wind, denotes the direction of its blowing,—<b>down the wind</b>. This interpretation, which I was long ago persuaded was the, right one, I find now confirmed by the opinion of Mr. Smith. The harbour of Lutro satisfies these conditions: and is otherwise even more decisively pointed out as being the spot, by the mention in the Geographers of the island Clauda as connected with it. From these data and others mentioned in my Greek Test., it is almost demonstrated that the port of Phœnice is the present port of Lutro. Mr. Smith has kindly sent me the following extract from a letter containing additional confirmation of the view: ‘Loutro is an excellent harbour; you open it unexpectedly, the rocks stand apart and the town appears within. During the Greek war, when cruising with Lord Cochrane,...... chased a pirate schooner, as they thought, right upon the rocks; suddenly he disappeared, and when rounding in after him,—like a change of scenery, the little basin, its shipping, and the town of Loutro, revealed themselves.’
