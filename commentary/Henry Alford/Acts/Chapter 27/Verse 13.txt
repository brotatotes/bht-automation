<b> 13. blew softly</b>] The S. wind was favourable for them in sailing from Fair Havens to Phœnice.<br><br><b> supposing that they had</b> (as good as)<b> obtained their purpose;</b> i.e. that it would now be a very easy matter to reach Phœnice.<br><br><b> loosing thence</b>] The word may be understood either of<i> weighing anchor</i>, or of<i> setting sail.</i> They crept close along the land till they passed Cape Matala. “A ship which could not lie nearer to the wind than seven points, would just weather that point which bears W. by S. from the entrance of Fair Havens. We see therefore the propriety of the expression ‘they sailed<i> close</i> by Crete,’ which the author uses to describe the first part of their passage.” Smith, p. 56.<b> 14. there blew down from it</b>] The words in the Greek, of which this appears to be the right rendering, are not easy. I have discussed them in my Greek Test.: and there first proposed the sense thus given, viz. that the wind blew<b> down</b> (from)<b> Crete</b>, ‘<i>down the high lands forming the coast</i>.’ It is a common expression in lake and coasting navigation, that ‘a gust came down the valleys.’ And this would be exactly the direction of the wind in question, When they had doubled, or perhaps were now doubling, Cape Matala, the wind suddenly changed, and the typhoon<i> came down upon them from the high lands;</i>—at first, as long as they were sheltered, only by fits down the gullies, but as soon as they were in the open bay past the cape, with its full violence. This, the hurricane rushing down the high lands when first observed, and afterwards<i> catching the ship</i>, seems to me exactly to describe their changed circumstances in passing the cape. A confirmation of this interpretation may be found by St. Luke himself using the word “<i>came down</i>” to express the descending of a squall from the hills on the lake of Gennesareth, Luke viii. 23. The above is also Mr. Howson’s view, and has been adopted by Mr. Smith. See, in the Appendix appended to the Introduction to Acts, the confirmation of this view in what actually happened to the Rev. G. Brown's party.<br><br><b> a tempestuous</b> (literally,<b> typhonic</b>)<b> wind</b>] “The sudden change from a south wind to a violent northerly wind, is a common occurrence in these seas. (Captain J. Stewart, R.N., in his remarks on the Archipelago, observes, “It is always safe to anchor under the lee of an island with a northerly wind, as it dies gradually away; but it would be extremely dangerous<i> with southerly winds, as they almost invariably shift to a violent northerly wind</i>.”) The term ‘<i>typhonic</i>’ indicates that it was accompanied by some of the phænomena which might be expected in such a case, viz. the agitation and whirling motion of the clouds caused by the meeting of the opposite currents of air when the change took place, and probably also of the sea, raising it in columns of spray. Pliny, speaking of sudden gusts, says, they make an eddy which is called Typhon.” Smith, p. 60.<br><br><b> Euracylon</b>] pronounced<b> Earakylon</b>. This is the reading of the Alexandrian, Vatican, and Sinaitic MSS. It is a compound word, signifying North-Easterly. The direction of the wind is established by Mr. S., from what follows, to have been about<i> half a point N. of E.N. E.;</i> and the subsequent narrative shews that the wind<i> continued to blow from this point till they reached Malta</i>.
