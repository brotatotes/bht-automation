He goes on to explain, that<i> if they had struck sail</i>, they must have been driven<i> directly towards the Syrtis</i>. They therefore set what sail the violence of the gale would permit them to carry, turning the ship’s head off shore, she having already been brought to on the starboard tack (right side to the wind). The adoption of this course would enable them to run before the gale, and yet keep wide of the African coast, which we know they did. They lowered the gear, i.e. they sent down upon deck the gear connected with the fair-weather sails, such as the topsails. A modern ship sends down top-gallant, masts and yards, a cutter strikes her top-mast, when preparing for a gale. In this case it was perhaps the heavy yard which the ancient ships carried, with the sail attached to it, and the heavy ropes, which would by their top-weight produce uneasiness of motion as well as resistance to the wind.

Spratt, R.N., quoted in Conybeare and Howson, ii. p. 405, note 5.<br><br><b> so</b>] i.e. “not only with the ship undergirded, and made snug, but with storm-sails set, and on the starboard tack, which was the only course by which she could avoid falling into the Syrtis.” Smith.
