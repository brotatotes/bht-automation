 19.   τ  .   σκευὴν τ  .   πλ  .   ἔῤῥ  . ] ἡ σκευή is the  furniture of the ship beds, moveables of all kinds, cooking utensils, and the spare rigging.
	 αὐτόχειρες is used with ἔῤῥιψαν as shewing the urgency of the danger when the seamen would with their own hands, cast away what otherwise was needful to the ship and themselves. This not being seen, αὐτόχ . has been supposed to imply the  first person , and ἐῤῥίψαμεν . has crept in: see var. readd.
