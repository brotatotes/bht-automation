 2.   Ἀδραμυττηνῷ ] Adramyttium ( Ἀδραμύττιον , - ειον , or Ἀτραμύττιον , and in Plin. Acts 27:32 , Adramytteos) was a seaport with a harbour in Mysia, an Athenian colony. It is now a village called Eudramit. Grotius, Drusius, and others erroneously suppose  Adrumetum to be meant, on the north coast of Africa (Winer, Realw.).
	 πλεῖν [  εἰς ]  τοὺς  .… ] The bracketed εἰς is in all probability an insertion to help off the harshness of the construction. But the accusative is indicative of the direction. We have ἦλθε Πολυνείκης χθόνα , Eur. Phœniss. 110. See Winer, edn. 6, § 32. 1, on the accus. after neuter verbs, and Bernhardy, Syntax, pp. 114 ff., and other instances in Wetstein.
	 Ἀριστάρχ .] See ch. Acts 19:29 ; Acts 20:4 ; Colossians 4:10 ; Philemon 1:24 . In Colossians 4:10 , Paul calls him his συναιχμάλωτος , but perhaps only figuratively: the same term is applied to Epaphras, Philemon 1:23 , where follows Ἀρίσταρχος , Δημᾶς , Λουκᾶς , οἱ  σύνεργοί μου .
