<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> Ἀδραμυττηνῷ</strong> ] Adramyttium ( Ἀδραμύττιον , - ειον , or Ἀτραμύττιον , and in Plin. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:32">Acts 27:32</span> , Adramytteos) was a seaport with a harbour in Mysia, an Athenian colony. It is now a village called Eudramit. Grotius, Drusius, and others erroneously suppose <em> Adrumetum</em> to be meant, on the north coast of Africa (Winer, Realw.).

<p><strong> πλεῖν</strong> [ <strong> εἰς</strong> ] <strong> τοὺς</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] The bracketed εἰς is in all probability an insertion to help off the harshness of the construction. But the accusative is indicative of the direction. We have ἦλθε Πολυνείκης χθόνα , Eur. Phœniss. 110. See Winer, edn. 6, § 32. 1, on the accus. after neuter verbs, and Bernhardy, Syntax, pp. 114 ff., and other instances in Wetstein.

<p><strong> Ἀριστάρχ</strong> .] See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:4">Acts 20:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span> . In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span> , Paul calls him his συναιχμάλωτος , but perhaps only figuratively: the same term is applied to Epaphras, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:23">Philemon 1:23</span> , where follows Ἀρίσταρχος , Δημᾶς , Λουκᾶς , οἱ <strong> σύνεργοί</strong> μου .</p>
