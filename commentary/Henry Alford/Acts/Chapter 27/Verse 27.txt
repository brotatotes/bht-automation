<b> 27. the fourteenth night</b>] The reckoning of days counts from their leaving Fair Haven: see vv. 18, 19.<br><br><b> in Adria</b>] Adria, in the wider sense, embraces not only the Venetian Gulf, but the sea to the south of Greece:—so Ptolemy, “The Peloponnesus is bounded on the W. and S. by the Adriatic Sea: and again, Sicily is bounded on the N. by the Sea of Adria.” In fact, he bounds Italy on the S., Sicily on the E., Greece on the S. and W., and Crete on the W. by this Sea, which notices sufficiently indicate its dimensions. So also Pausanias, speaking of the straits of Messina, accounts for their tempestuous character by the meeting of the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic seas.<br><br><b> the shipmen deemed</b>] What gave rise to this suspicion? Probably the sound (or even the apparent sight) of breakers. “If we assume that St. Paul’s Bay, in Malta, is the actual scene of the shipwreck, we can have no difficulty in explaining what these indications must have been. No ship can enter it from the east without passing within a quarter of a mile of the point of Koura: but before reaching it, the land is too low and too far from the track of a ship driven from the eastward, to be seen in a dark night. When she does come within this distance, it is impossible to avoid observing the breakers: for with north-easterly gales, the sea breaks upon it with such violence, that Capt. Smyth, in his view of the headland, has made the breakers its distinctive character.” Smith, p. 79.—I recommend the reader to study the reasonings and calculations by which Mr. Smith (pp. 79–86) has established, I think satisfactorily, that this<b> land</b> could be no other than the point of Koura, east of St. Paul’s Bay, in Malta.
