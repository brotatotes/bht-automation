Plutarch speaking of the tumult during which Galba was murdered, τοῦ φορείου καθάπερ ἐν κλύδωνι δεῦρο κἀκεῖ διαφερομένου (probably from Tacitus, ‘Agebatur huc illuc Galba, <em> vario turbœ fluctuantis impulsu</em> ,’ Hist. i. 40); Philo, de Migr.

<p><strong> ἐν τῷ Ἀδρίᾳ</strong> ] Adria, in the wider sense, embraces net only the Venetian Gulf, but the sea to the south of Greece: so Ptolemy (iii. 16), ἡ δὲ Πελοπόννησος ὁρίζεται … ἀπὸ δυσμῶν καὶ μεσημβρίας τῷ Ἀδριατικῷ πελάγει . So also (iii. 4) ἡ δὲ Σικελία ὁρίζεται … ἀπὸ δὲ ἀνατολῶν ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἀδρίου πελάγους . In fact, he bounds Italy on the S., Sicily on the E., Greece on the S. and W., and Crete on the W. by this sea, which notices sufficiently indicate its dimensions. So also Pausanias ( Act 27:25 ), speaking of the straits of Messina, says that the sea there is θαλἀσσης χειμεριωτάτη πάσης . οἵ τε γὰρ ἄνεμοι ταράσσουσιν αὐτὴν ἀμφοτέρωθεν τὸ κῦμα ἐπάγοντες , <strong> ἐκ τοῦ Ἀδρίου</strong> , καὶ ἐξ ἑτέρου πελάγους ὃ καλεῖται Τυρσηνόν .

<p><strong> ὑπενόουν</strong> ] What gave rise to this suspicion? Probably the sound (or even the apparent sight) of breakers. “If we assume that St. Paul’s Bay, in Malta, is the actual scene of the shipwreck, we can have no difficulty in explaining what these indications must have been. No ship can enter it from the east without passing within a quarter of a mile of the point of Koura: but before reaching it, the land is too low and too far from the track of a ship driven from the eastward, to be seen in a dark night. When she does come within this distance, it is impossible to avoid observing the breakers: for with north-easterly gales, the sea breaks upon it with such violence, that Capt. Smyth, in his view of the headland, has made the breakers its distinctive character.” Smith, p. 79.

<p>I recommend the reader to study the reasonings and calculations by which Mr. Smith (pp. 79 86) has established, I think satisfactorily, that this χώραν could be no other than the point of Koura, east of St. Paul’s Bay, in Malta.
