 28.  βολίσαντες ] βολίζειν , ἤγουν βάθος θαλάσσης μετρεῖν μολυβδίνῃ καθέτῳ , ἢ τοιούτῳ τινί . Eustath [160] on Il. ε . p. 427 (Wetst.).

	 ὀργυιάς ] ὀργυιὰ σημαίνει τὴν ἔκτασιν τῶν χειρῶν σὺν τῷ πλάτει τοῦ στήθους (Etymol. Magn.) = therefore very nearly one fathom. Every particular here corresponds with the actual state of things. At twenty-five fathoms depth (as given in evidence at the court-martial on the officers of the Lively, wrecked on this point in 1810), the curl of the sea was seen on the rocks in the night, but no land. The twenty fathoms would occur somewhat past this: the fifteen fathoms, in a direction W. by N. from the former, after a time sufficient to prepare for the unusual measure of anchoring by the stern. And just so are the soundings (see Capt. Smyth’s chart, Smith, p. 88), and the shore is here full of τραχεῖς τόποι , mural precipices, upon which the sea must have been breaking with great violence.
