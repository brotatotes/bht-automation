<b> 28. fathoms</b>] The measure here rendered<i> fathom</i> is described as being the length of the outstretched arms, from finger to finger. It is therefore very nearly our fathom, which is six feet.—Every particular here corresponds with the actual state of things. At twenty-five fathoms’ depth (as given in evidence at the court-martial on the officers of the Lively, wrecked on this point in 1810), the curl of the sea was seen on the rocks in the night, but no land. The twenty fathoms would occur somewhat past this: the fifteen fathoms, in a direction W. by N. from the former, after a time sufficient to prepare for the unusual measure of anchoring by the stern, And just so are the soundings (see Capt. Smyth’s chart, Smith, p. 88), and the shore is here full of<b> rough places</b>, mural precipices, upon which the sea must have been breaking with great violence.
