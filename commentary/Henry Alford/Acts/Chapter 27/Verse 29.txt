<b> 29. out of the stern</b>] The usual way of anchoring in ancient as well as in modern navigation, was<i> by the bow</i>. But under certain circumstances, they anchored<i> by the stern</i>; and Mr. Smith has shewn from the figure of a ship which he has copied from the “Antichità de Ercolano,” that their ships had hawseholes aft, to fit them for anchoring by the stern. “That a vessel<i> can</i> anchor by the stern is sufficiently proved (if proof were needed) by the history of some of our own naval engagements. So it was at the battle of the Nile. And when ships are about to attack batteries, it is customary for them to go into action prepared to anchor in this way. This was the case at Algiers. There is still greater interest in quoting the instance of the battle of Copenhagen, not only from the accounts we have of the precision with which each ship let go her anchors astern as she arrived nearly opposite her appointed station, but because it is said that Nelson stated after the battle that he had that morning been reading Acts xxvii.” Conybeare and Howson, ii. p. 414. We have an instance in Cæsar’s commentaries where his ships were anchored by<i> four</i> anchors each, to provide against the violence of a storm. “The anchorage in St. Paul's Bay is thus described in the Sailing Directions: ‘The harbour of St. Paul is open to E. and N.E. winds. It is, notwithstanding, safe for small ships; the ground, generally, being very good: and while the cables hold, there is no danger,<i> as the anchors will never start</i>.’” Smith, p. 92.<br><br><b> wished for the day</b>] Uncertain, whether their ship might not<i> go down at her anchors</i>: and, even supposing her to ride out the night safely, uncertain whether the coast to leeward might not be iron-bound, affording no beach where they might land in safety. Hence also the ungenerous but natural attempt of the seamen to save their lives by taking to the boat. See Smith, p. 97.
