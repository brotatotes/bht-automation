<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> Σιδῶνα</strong> ] This celebrated city is generally joined in the N. T. with Tyre, from which it was distant 200 stadia (Strabo, xvi. 756 ff.), and of which it was probably the mother city. It was within the lot of the tribe of Asher ( Jos 19:28 ), but never conquered by the Israelites (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:31">Judges 1:31</span> ; Jdg 3:3 ). From the earliest times the Sidonians were renowned for their manufactures of glass (‘Sidon artifex vitri,’ Plin. Act 27:19 ), linen ( πέπλοι παμποίκιλοι ἔργα γυναικῶν Σιδονίων , Il. ζ . 290), silversmith’s work (Il. ψ . 743, and Od. ο . 115, &amp;c.), and for the hewing of timber (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+5:6">1 Kings 5:6</span> ; Ezr 3:7 ). In ancient times, Sidon seems to have been under Tyre, and to have furnished her with mariners (see Eze 27:8 ). It went over to Shalmaneser, king of Assyria (Jos. Antt. ix. 14. 2); but seems under him, and afterwards under the Chaldæans and Persians, to have had tributary kings of its own (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+25:22">Jeremiah 25:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+27:3">Jeremiah 27:3</span> ; Herod. viii. 67). The Sidonians furnished the best ships in Xerxes’ navy, Herod. vii. 96, 99. Under Artaxerxes Oehus Sidon freed itself, but was by him, after a severe siege, taken and destroyed (Diod. Sic. xvi. 43 ff.). It was rebuilt, and soon after went over to Alexander, keeping its own vassal kings. After his death it was alternately under Syrian and Egyptian rule, till it fell under the Romans. The present Saida is west of ancient Sidon, and is a port of some commerce, but insecure, from the sanding up of the harbour (Winer, Realw. See also Robinson, vol. iii. pp. 415 ff., who gives an account of the history of Sidon during the middle ages).

<p><strong> πορευθέντι</strong> ] This dat. looks very like a grammatical correction: the <strong> πορευθέντα</strong> of the rec. would be an instance of an acc. with inf. after a dat. preceding, as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:20">Acts 26:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span> . The φίλοι here mentioned were probably Christian brethren (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span> , where the Gospel is said to have been preached in Phœnicia; and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:3">Acts 21:3</span> , where we find brethren at <em> Tyre</em> ); but it is usual in that case for ἀδελφοί or μαθηταί to be specified: cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:4">Acts 21:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:7">Acts 21:7</span> . The ἐπιμελείας τυχεῖν was perhaps to obtain from them that outfit for the voyage which, on account of the official precision of his custody at Cæsarea, he could not there be provided with.</p>
