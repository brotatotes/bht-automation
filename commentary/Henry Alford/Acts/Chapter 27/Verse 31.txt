<b> 31.</b>] “It is surprising to find him saying that the others cannot be saved except the sailors abode in the ship: as if it had been in their power to frustrate God’s promise. I answer, that Paul is not here treating accurately of God’s power, distinct from human will and means. And of a surety God does not offer His help to the faithful that they may despise means of safety, and indulge torpor and sloth, where there is a plain way of caution..... But it does not therefore follow, that the hand of God is tied to means or assistances; but when God ordains this or that way of acting, He curbs the inclinations of men that they transgress not His appointed bounds.” Calvin.
