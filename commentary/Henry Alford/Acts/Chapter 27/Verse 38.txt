<p>This wheat was either the remainder of the cargo, part of which had been disposed of in Act 27:18 or was the <em> store for their sustenance</em> , the cargo having consisted of some other merchandise. And this latter is much the more likely, for two reasons: (1) that σῖτος is mentioned here and not in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:18">Acts 27:18</span> , which it would have been in all probability, had the material cast out there been the same as here; and (2) that the fact is related <em> immediately after</em> we are assured that they were <em> satisfied with food</em> : from whence we may infer almost with certainty that <strong> ὁ σῖτος</strong> is the <em> ship’s provision</em> , of part of which they had been partaking. It is a sufficient answer to Mr. Smith’s objection to this (“to suppose that they had remaining such a quantity as would lighten the ship is quite inconsistent with the previous abstinence,” p. 99), that the ship was provisioned for the voyage to Italy for 276 persons, and that <em> for the last fourteen days hardly any food had been touched</em> . This would leave surely enough to be of consequence in a ship ready to sink from hour to hour.</p>
