	This wheat was either the remainder of the cargo, part of which had been disposed of in Act 27:18 or was the  store for their sustenance , the cargo having consisted of some other merchandise. And this latter is much the more likely, for two reasons: (1) that σῖτος is mentioned here and not in Acts 27:18 , which it would have been in all probability, had the material cast out there been the same as here; and (2) that the fact is related  immediately after we are assured that they were  satisfied with food : from whence we may infer almost with certainty that  ὁ σῖτος is the  ship’s provision , of part of which they had been partaking. It is a sufficient answer to Mr. Smith’s objection to this (“to suppose that they had remaining such a quantity as would lighten the ship is quite inconsistent with the previous abstinence,” p. 99), that the ship was provisioned for the voyage to Italy for 276 persons, and that  for the last fourteen days hardly any food had been touched . This would leave surely enough to be of consequence in a ship ready to sink from hour to hour.
