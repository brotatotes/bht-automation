<b> 38. they lightened the ship</b>] See above on ver. 18.—This wheat was either the remainder of the cargo, part of which had been disposed of in ver. 18—or was the<i> store for their sustenance</i>, the cargo having consisted of some other merchandise. And this latter is much the more likely, for two reasons: (1) that<b> wheat</b> is mentioned here and not in ver. 18, which it would have been in all probability, had the material cast out there been the same as here; and (2) that the fact is related<i> immediately after</i> we are assured that they were<i> satisfied with food</i>: from whence we may infer almost with certainty that<b> the wheat</b> is the<i> ship's</i><i> provision</i>, of part of which they had been partaking. It is a sufficient answer to Mr. Smith’s objection to this ( “to suppose they had remaining such a quantity as would lighten the ship is quite inconsistent with the previous abstinence,” p. 99), that the ship was provisioned for the voyage to Italy for 276 persons, and that<i> for the last fourteen days hardly any food had been touched</i>. This would leave surely enough to be of consequence in a ship ready to sink from hour to hour.
