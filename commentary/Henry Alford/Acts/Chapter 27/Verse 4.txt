The κατὰ τὴν Ἀσίαν τόποι of Act 27:2 being to the  west of Pamphylia (which was not in Asia, ch. Act 2:10 ), the direct course thither would have been  S. of Cyprus ; but having the wind contrary, i.e. from the W. or N.W.

On the διαπλεύσαντες , &c., it may be well to quote (from Smith) the testimony of M. de Pagés, a French navigator, who, on his voyage from Syria to Marseilles, informs us that after making Cyprus, “the winds from the west, and consequently contrary, which prevail in these places during the summer,  forced us to run to the north . We made for the coast of Caramania (Cilicia), in order to meet the northerly winds,  which we found accordingly .”
