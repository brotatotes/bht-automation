<b> 4. we sailed under</b>] i.e. ‘<i>in the lee of</i>,’ Cyprus. “When a ship is forced out of her course by a contrary wind, so that an island is interposed between the wind and the ship, she is said to<i> sail under</i> the island.” Wetstein; who also says, “If the wind had been favourable, they would have put out to sea, and left Cyprus on the right, as in Acts xxi. 3, but now they are forced to coast along Cilicia, between Cyprus and Asia.” They kept under shelter of Cyprus, i.e. between Cyprus and Cilicia, so<b> having sailed the whole length</b> of the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, they came to Myra. See the account of the reverse voyage, ch. xxi. 3, where, the wind being nearly in the same quarter, the direct course was taken, and they left Cyprus at a distance on their left, in going to Tyre. On this it may be well to quote (from Smith) the testimony of M. de Pagés, a French navigator, who, on his voyage from Syria to Marseilles, informs us that after making Cyprus, “the winds from the west, and consequently contrary, which prevail in these places during the summer,<i> forced us to run to the north</i>. We made for the coast of Caramania (Cilicia), in order to meet the northerly winds,<i> which we found accordingly.</i>”<br><br><b> we sailed under</b> (see above on ver. 4)<b> Crete...</b>] “Unless she had put into that harbour (Cnidus), and waited for a fair wind, her only course was to run under the lee of Crete, in the direction of Salmone, which is the eastern extremity of that island.”—Salmone (Capo Salomon) is described by Strabo as a sharp headland looking toward Egypt and the Rhodian Archipelago. Pliny calls it Sammonium.
