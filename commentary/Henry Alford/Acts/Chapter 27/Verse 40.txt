<b> 40.</b>] (1) They<i> cut away</i> (or,<i> cut round</i>)<i> all four anchors</i> (the<b> round</b> may allude to the cutting round each cable in order to sever it, or to the going round and cutting all four), and left them in the sea (literally “<b>into</b> the sea,” i.e. ‘in the sea,<i> into</i> which they had been cast’). This they did to save time, and not to encumber the water-logged ship with their additional weight. (2) They let loose the ropes which tied up the rudders. “Ancient ships were steered by two large paddles, one on each quarter. When anchored by the stern in a gale, it would be necessary to lift them out of the water, and secure them by lashings or rudder bands, and to loose these bands when the ship was again got under way.” Smith, p. 101. (3) They raised their “<i>artĕmon</i>” to the wind. It would be impossible in the limits of a note to give any abstract of the long and careful reasoning by which Mr. Smith has made it appear that the ‘artĕmon’ was the<b> foresail</b> of the ancient ships. I will only notice from him, that the rendering<i> ‘mainsail’</i> in our A.V. was probably a mistaken translation from Bayfius or De Baif, the earliest of the modern writers on naval matters, and perhaps the only one extant when the translation was made: he says, “The<i> artemon</i> is the largest sail in the ship, as see Acts xxvii.... even now the Venetians retain the name.” These words, “the largest sail,” they rendered by<i> mainsail</i>; whereas the<i> largest sail</i> of the Venetian ships at the time was the<i> foresail</i>.—The French ‘artimon,’ even now in use, means the sail at the stern (mizen). But this is no clue to the ancient meaning, any more than is our word<i> mizen</i> to the meaning of the French<i> misaine</i>, which is the foresail.
