<p><strong> 41. </strong> <strong> τόπον διθάλασσον</strong> ] At the west end of St. Paul’s Bay is an <em> island</em> , Selmoon or Salmonetta, which <em> they could not have known to be such</em> from their place of an chorage. This island is separated from the mainland by a channel of about 100 yards wide, communicating with the outer sea. Just within this island, in all probability, was the place where the ship struck, in a <strong> place where two seas met.

<p><strong> ἐπέκειλαν</strong> ] ἐπικέλλειν is used by Homer (ref.) in the sense of ‘adpellere navem.’ Its commoner use is intransitive: see Hom. ib. v. 138, and Apollon. Rhod. ii. 352, 382; iii. 575. In Od. ε . 114, it is said of the ship itself, ἠπείρῳ ἐπέκελσε . The ἐποκέλλειν of the rec. is used several times by Thucydides, and has the same twofold usage: cf. Thucyd. iii. 12; iv. 28; viii. 102: <strong> they ran the ship a-ground</strong> .

<p>“The circumstance which follows, would, but for the peculiar nature of the bottom of St. Paul’s Bay, be difficult to account for. The rocks of Malta disintegrate into very minute particles of sand and clay, which when acted on by the currents, or by surface agitation, form a deposit of tenacious clay: but in still water, where these causes do not act, mud is found; but it is only in the creeks where there are no currents, and at such a depth as to be undisturbed by the waves, that mud occurs.… A ship therefore, impelled by the force of the gale into a creek with a bottom such as that laid down in the chart, would strike a bottom of mud, graduating into tenacious clay, into which the fore part would fix itself and be held fast, while the stern was exposed to the force of the waves.” Smith, p. 103.</p>
