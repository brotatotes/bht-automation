<b> 7. when we had sailed slowly</b>] It is evident that the ship was encountering an adverse wind. The distance from Myra to Cnidus is only 130 geogr. miles, which, with a fair wind, would not take more than one day. Mr. Smith shews that the wind was N.W., or within a few points of it. “We learn from the sailing directions for the Mediterranean, that, throughout the whole of that sea, but mostly in the eastern half, including the Adriatic and Archipelago, N.W. winds prevail in the summer months;... the summer trade winds come from the N.W. (p. 197); which agrees with Aristotle’s account of these winds. According to Pliny (ii. 47), they begin in August, and blow for forty days.”<br><br><b> with difficulty</b>] not as E.V., ‘<i>scarce</i>,’ which being also an adverb of<i> time</i>, gives the erroneous idea to the English reader that the ship had<i> scarcely reached</i> Cnidus when the wind became unfavourable.<br><br><b> Cnidus</b>] Cnidus is a peninsula at the entrance of the Ægean Sea, between the islands of Cos and Rhodes, having a lofty promontory and two harbours. “With N.W. winds the ship could work up from Myra to Cnidus; because, until she reached that point, she had the advantage of a weather shore, under the lee of which she would have smooth water, and as formerly mentioned, a westerly current; but it would be slowly and with difficulty. At Cnidus that advantage ceased.” Smith, p. 37.
