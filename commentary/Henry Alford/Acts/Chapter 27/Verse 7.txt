<b> 7. when we had sailed slowly</b>] It is evident that the ship was encountering an adverse wind. The distance from Myra to Cnidus is only 130 geogr. miles, which, with a fair wind, would not take more than one day. Mr. Smith shews that the wind was N.W., or within a few points of it. “We learn from the sailing directions for the Mediterranean, that, throughout the whole of that sea, but mostly in the eastern half, including the Adriatic and Archipelago, N.W. winds prevail in the summer months;... the summer trade winds come from the N.W. (p. 197); which agrees with Aristotle’s account of these winds. According to Pliny (ii. 47), they begin in August, and blow for forty days.”
