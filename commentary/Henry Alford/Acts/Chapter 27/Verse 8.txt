<b> 8. Sidon</b>] This celebrated city is generally joined in the New Test. with Tyre, from which it was distant twenty-five miles, and of which it was probably the mother city. It was within the lot of the tribe of Asher (Josh. xix. 28), but never conquered by the Israelites (Judg. i. 31; iii. 3). From the earliest times the Sidonians were renowned for their manufactures of glass, linen, silversmith’s work, and for the hewing of timber (1 Kings v. 6; Ezra iii. 7). In ancient times, Sidon seems to have been under Tyre, and to have furnished her with mariners (see Ezek. xxvii. 8). It went over to Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, but seems under him, and afterwards under the Chaldzeans and Persians, to have had tributary kings of its own (Jer. xxv. 22; xxvii. 3). The Sidonians furnished the best ships in Xerxes’ navy. Under Artaxerxes Ochus Sidon freed itself, but was by him, after a severe siege, taken and destroyed. It was rebuilt, and soon after went over to Alexander, keeping its own vassal kings. After his death it was alternately under Syrian and Egyptian rule, till it fell under the Romans. The present Saida is west of ancient Sidon, and is a port of some commerce, but insecure, from the sanding up of the harbour.<br><br><b> 8. hardly passing it</b>] “After passing this point (Salmone), the difficulty they experienced in navigating to the westward along the coasts of Asia, would recur; but as the south side of Crete is also a weather shore with N.W. winds, they would be able to work up as far as Cape Matala. Here the land trends suddenly to the N., and the advantages of a weather shore cease, and their only resource was to make for a harbour. Now Fair Havens is the harbour nearest to Cape Matala, the farthest point to which an ancient ship could have attained with N. W-ly winds.” Smith, as above.
