<b> 8. Sidon</b>] This celebrated city is generally joined in the New Test. with Tyre, from which it was distant twenty-five miles, and of which it was probably the mother city. It was within the lot of the tribe of Asher (Josh. xix. 28), but never conquered by the Israelites (Judg. i. 31; iii. 3). From the earliest times the Sidonians were renowned for their manufactures of glass, linen, silversmith’s work, and for the hewing of timber (1 Kings v. 6; Ezra iii. 7). In ancient times, Sidon seems to have been under Tyre, and to have furnished her with mariners (see Ezek. xxvii. 8). It went over to Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, but seems under him, and afterwards under the Chaldzeans and Persians, to have had tributary kings of its own (Jer. xxv. 22; xxvii. 3). The Sidonians furnished the best ships in Xerxes’ navy. Under Artaxerxes Ochus Sidon freed itself, but was by him, after a severe siege, taken and destroyed. It was rebuilt, and soon after went over to Alexander, keeping its own vassal kings. After his death it was alternately under Syrian and Egyptian rule, till it fell under the Romans. The present Saida is west of ancient Sidon, and is a port of some commerce, but insecure, from the sanding up of the harbour.<br><br><b> The friends</b> here mentioned were probably Christian brethren (see ch. xi. 12, where the Gospel is said to have been preached in Phœnicia; and ch, xxi. 3, where we find brethren at<i> Tyre</i>); but it is usual in that case for<i> brethren</i> or<i> disciples</i> to be specified: compare ch. xxi. 4, 7. The<b> refreshing himself</b> (literally,<b> getting attention paid him</b>) was perhaps to obtain from them that outfit for the voyage which, on account of the official precision of his custody at Cæsarea, he could not there be provided with.<br><br><b> 8. hardly passing it</b>] “After passing this point (Salmone), the difficulty they experienced in navigating to the westward along the coasts of Asia, would recur; but as the south side of Crete is also a weather shore with N.W. winds, they would be able to work up as far as Cape Matala. Here the land trends suddenly to the N., and the advantages of a weather shore cease, and their only resource was to make for a harbour. Now Fair Havens is the harbour nearest to Cape Matala, the farthest point to which an ancient ship could have attained with N. W-ly winds.” Smith, as above.<br><br><b> fair havens</b>] The situation of this anchorage was ascertained by Pococke, from the fact of the name still remaining. “In searching after Lebena farther to the west, I found out a place which I thought to be of greater consequence, because mentioned in Holy Scripture, and also honoured by the presence of St. Paul, that is, ‘the Fair Havens, near unto the city of Lasea;’ for there is another small bay about two leagues to the E. of Matala, which is now called by the Greeks good or fair havens.” Cited by Mr. Smith, who adds: “The most conclusive evidence that this is the Fair Havens of Scripture, is, that its position is precisely that where a ship circumstanced as St. Paul’s was must have put in. I have already shewn that the wind must have been about N.W.;—but with such a wind she could not pass Cape Matala: we must therefore look<i> near, but to the E. of</i> this promontory, for an anchorage well calculated to shelter a vessel in N.W. winds, but not<i> from all winds</i>, otherwise it would not have been, in the opinion of seamen (ver. 12), an unsafe winter harbour. Now here we have a harbour which not only fulfils every one of the conditions, but still retains the name given to it by St. Luke.” Smith, p. 45.<br><br><b> Laséa</b>] This place was, until recently, altogether unknown; and from the variety of readings, the very name was uncertain. Pliny mentions<i> Lasos</i> among the cities of Crete, but does not indicate its situation. There is a<i> Lisia</i> named in Crete in the Peutinger Table, which may be the same. [On the very interesting discovery of<i> Lasea</i> by the Rev. G. Brown in the beginning of the year 1856, see the Appendix at the end of the Introduction to Acts. The ruins are on the beach, about two hours eastward of Fair Havens.]
