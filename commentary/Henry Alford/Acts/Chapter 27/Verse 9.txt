<p><strong> 9. </strong> <strong> ἱκανοῦ χρ</strong> .] Not ‘ <em> since the beginning of our voyage</em> ,’ as Meyer: the time was spent <em> at the anchorage</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τοῦ πλοός</strong> ] Not ‘ <em> sailing</em> ,’ but <strong> the voyage</strong> , viz. to Rome, which henceforth was given up as hopeless for this autumn and winter. That this is the meaning of ὁ πλοῦς , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:7">Acts 21:7</span> . And by observing this, we avoid a difficulty which has been supposed to attend the words. <em> Sailing</em> was not unsafe so early as this (see below); but to undertake so long a voyage, was.

<p><strong> τὴν νηστείαν</strong> ] <strong> The fast</strong> , κατ ʼ ἐξοχήν , is the solemn fast of the day of expiation, the 10th of Tisri, the seventh month of the Jewish ecclesiastical year, and the first of the civil year. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+16:29">Leviticus 16:29</span> ff; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+23:26">Leviticus 23:26</span> ff. This would be about the time of the autumnal equinox. The <em> sailing season</em> did not close so early: ‘Ex die igitur tertio iduum Novembris, usque in diem sextum iduum Martiarum, maria clauduntur.’ Vegetius (Smith, p. 45, note) de Re Milit. iv. 39.</p>
