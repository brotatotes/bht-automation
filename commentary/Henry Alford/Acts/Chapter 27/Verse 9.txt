 9.   ἱκανοῦ χρ .] Not ‘  since the beginning of our voyage ,’ as Meyer: the time was spent  at the anchorage .
	 τοῦ πλοός ] Not ‘  sailing ,’ but  the voyage , viz. to Rome, which henceforth was given up as hopeless for this autumn and winter. That this is the meaning of ὁ πλοῦς , see ch. Acts 21:7 . And by observing this, we avoid a difficulty which has been supposed to attend the words.  Sailing was not unsafe so early as this (see below); but to undertake so long a voyage, was.
	 τὴν νηστείαν ]  The fast , κατ ʼ ἐξοχήν , is the solemn fast of the day of expiation, the 10th of Tisri, the seventh month of the Jewish ecclesiastical year, and the first of the civil year. See Leviticus 16:29 ff; Leviticus 23:26 ff. This would be about the time of the autumnal equinox. The  sailing season did not close so early: ‘Ex die igitur tertio iduum Novembris, usque in diem sextum iduum Martiarum, maria clauduntur.’ Vegetius (Smith, p. 45, note) de Re Milit. iv. 39.
