 1.   Μελίτη ] The whole course of the narrative has gone to shew that this  can be no other than MALTA. The idea that it is not MALTA, but  Meleda , an island off the Illyrian coast in the Gulf of Venice, seems to be first found in Constantine Porphyrogenitus, de Adminiculis Imperii, p. 36 νῆσος μεγάλη τὰ Μέλετα ἦτοι τὸ Μαλοζεᾶται , ἣν ἐν ταῖς πράξεσι τ . ἀποστ . ὁ ἅγιος Λουκᾶς μέμνηται , Μελίτην ταύτην προσαγορεύων . It has been adopted by our own countrymen, Bryant and Dr. Falconer, and abroad by Giorgi, Rhoer, and more recently Paulus. It rests principally on three mistakes: 1. the meaning of the name Adria (see above on ch. Act 27:27 ), 2. the fancy that there are no poisonous serpents in Malta ( Act 28:3 ), 3. the notion that the Maltese would not have been called βάρβαροι . The idea itself, when compared with the facts, is preposterous enough. Its supporters are obliged to place Fair Havens on the  north side of Crete , and to suppose the wind to have been the hot  Sirocco (compare Act 28:2 ).
	Further notices of this question, and of the state of Malta at the time, will be found in the notes on the following verses. Observe, their previous  state of ignorance of the island is expressed by the imperf. ἐπεγίνωσκον ; the  act of recognition by the aor. ἐπέγνωμεν [ch. Act 27:30 ].
