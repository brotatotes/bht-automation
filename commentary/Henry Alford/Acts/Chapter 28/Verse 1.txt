<b> XXVIII. 1. Melita</b>] The whole course of the narrative has gone to shew that this<i> can be no other than</i> MALTA. The idea that it is not MALTA, but<i> Meleda</i>, an island off the Illyrian coast in the Gulf of Venice, seems to be first found in Constantine Porphyrogenitus. It has been adopted by our own countrymen, Bryant and Dr. Falconer, and abroad by some commentators. It rests principally on three mistakes:—1. the meaning of the name Adria (see above on ch. xxvii. 27),—2. the fancy that there are no poisonous serpents in Malta (ver. 3),—3. the notion that the Maltese would not have been called Barbarians.—The idea itself, when compared with the facts, is preposterous enough. Its supporters are obliged to place Fair Havens on the<i> north side of Crete</i>,—and to suppose the wind to have been the hot<i> Sirocco</i> (comp. ver. 2).—Further notices of this question, and of the state of Malta at the time, will be found in the notes on the following verses.
