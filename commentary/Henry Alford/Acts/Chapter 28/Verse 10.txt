<p><strong> 10. </strong> <strong> τιμαῖς</strong> ] The ordinary interpretation of this as <em> rewards, gifts</em> , may be right, but is not necessary. In all the passages quoted to support it, ref. Sir., Cicero, ad Diversos, xvi. 9 (‘Curio misi ut medico honos haberetur’), the expression τιμή is <em> general</em> , and the <em> context</em> renders an inference probable as to <em> what sort of</em> τιμή is meant. See especially 1Ti 5:3 ; 1Ti 5:17 and notes. Here there is no such unavoidable indication, whereas the other meaning is rendered probable by the form of the sentence, which opposes to these τιμαί , bestowed on them during their whole stay, τὰ πρὸς τ . χρείας , with which they were loaded at their departure. Render it therefore <strong> honoured us with many honours</strong> (or ‘ <em> distinctions</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> attentions</em> ’).

<p>τὴν χρείαν has perhaps been an alteration after St. Paul’s ἅπαξ κ . δὶς εἰς τὴν χρείαν μοι ἐπέμψατε , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+4:16">Philippians 4:16</span> .</p>
