 10.   τιμαῖς ] The ordinary interpretation of this as  rewards, gifts , may be right, but is not necessary. In all the passages quoted to support it, ref. Sir., Cicero, ad Diversos, xvi. 9 (‘Curio misi ut medico honos haberetur’), the expression τιμή is  general , and the  context renders an inference probable as to  what sort of τιμή is meant. See especially 1Ti 5:3 ; 1Ti 5:17 and notes. Here there is no such unavoidable indication, whereas the other meaning is rendered probable by the form of the sentence, which opposes to these τιμαί , bestowed on them during their whole stay, τὰ πρὸς τ . χρείας , with which they were loaded at their departure. Render it therefore  honoured us with many honours (or ‘  distinctions ,’ or ‘  attentions ’).
	τὴν χρείαν has perhaps been an alteration after St. Paul’s ἅπαξ κ . δὶς εἰς τὴν χρείαν μοι ἐπέμψατε , Philippians 4:16 .
