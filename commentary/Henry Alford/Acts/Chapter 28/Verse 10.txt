<b> 10. with many honours</b>] The ordinary interpretation of this as<i> rewards, gifts</i>, may be right, but is not necessary. The other meaning, that these were really honours, is rendered probable by the form of the sentence, which opposes to these “<i>honours</i>,” bestowed on them during their whole stay,<b> such things as were necessary</b>, with which they were loaded at their departure. Render it therefore<b> honoured us with many honours</b> (or<i> ‘distinctions</i>,’ or<i> ‘attentions’</i>).
