Mr. Lewin’s account is, “As the wind was westerly, and they were under shelter of the high mountainous range of Etna on their left, they were obliged to stand out to sea in order to fill their sails, and so came to Rhegium by a circuitous sweep.” And he cites a case of a passage from Syracuse to Rhegium, in which a similar circuit was taken for a sim reason, p. 736. The at Rhegium, as perhaps the three at Syracuse before, was spent probably in waiting for the wind.
