 16. ] [The omission of the words ὁ ἑκατ … to στρατοπεδάρχῳ (- χῃ ) [though too strongly attested to allow us to retain them in the text] may have been originally caused by the transcriber’s eye passing from - αρχος to - αρχω , as in Syr.

	It does not follow,  from the singular being used , that there was  but one præfectus prætorio at this time, and  that one Burrus; though it may have been so.  The prefect mentioned might be  one of the two who preceded Burrus, or one of the two who followed him so that no chronological datum is here contained (against Wieseler, who builds upon it: Chron. der Apostg. p. 86). He attempts to meet the above argument by accounting it improbable that the prisoners would be  consigned to either of the prefects; this may have been so, but they certainly would be delivered to  one, not to both ; and the fact might well be thus related. Luke is not so precise in Roman civil and military matters, as that he necessarily should in this case have written ἑνὶ τῶν στρατοπεδάρχων .
	The ‘  præfectus prætorio ’ was the person officially put in charge with the prisoners sent from the provinces: so Plin. Epp. x. 65, “Vinctus mitti ad præfectos prætorii mei debet.”
	The prætorian camp was outside the Porta Viminalis, where it had been fixed and fortified by Sejanus: see Tacit. Ann. iv. 2. [It was incorporated in Aurelian’s walls, and now forms a square projection from their line.]  ]
