Acts 28:12 . ἐν δὲ Σικελὶᾳ ἔθνη  βάρβαρα τάδε ἐστίν , Ἐδυνοί , Σικανοί , Σικελοί ,  Φοίνικες , Τρῶες , Scylax, Periplus, p.4.

	 τὸν ἐφεστ  . ] not, ‘  which came on suddenly ’ (Meyer), but  which was on us : another instance of overlooking the  present sense of ἕστηκα .
	 ψῦχος ] This is decisive against the Sirocco, which is a hot and sultry wind even so late as the month of November, and moreover (Smith, p. 109) seldom lasts more than three days.
