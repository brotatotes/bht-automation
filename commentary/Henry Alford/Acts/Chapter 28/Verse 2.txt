<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> βάρβαροι</strong> ] A term implying very much what our word <strong> natives</strong> does, when speaking of any little-known or new place. They were not Greek colonists, therefore they were barbarians ( Rom 1:14 ). If it be necessary strictly to vindicate the term, the two following citations will do so: ἔστι δὲ ἡ νῆσος αὕτη (Malta) <strong> Φοινίκων</strong> ἄποικος , Diod. Sic. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:12">Acts 28:12</span> . ἐν δὲ Σικελὶᾳ ἔθνη <strong> βάρβαρα</strong> τάδε ἐστίν , Ἐδυνοί , Σικανοί , Σικελοί , <strong> Φοίνικες</strong> , Τρῶες , Scylax, Periplus, p.4.
	</p>
<p><strong> προσελάβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> received us</strong> , not <em> to their fire</em> (Meyer), but as in reff.
	</p>
<p><strong> ὑετόν</strong> ] ‘Post ingentes ventos solent imbres sequi.’ Grot.
	</p>
<p><strong> τὸν ἐφεστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] not, ‘ <em> which came on suddenly</em> ’ (Meyer), but <strong> which was on us</strong> : another instance of overlooking the <em> present</em> sense of ἕστηκα .
	</p>
<p><strong> ψῦχος</strong> ] This is decisive against the Sirocco, which is a hot and sultry wind even so late as the month of November, and moreover (Smith, p. 109) seldom lasts more than three days.</p>
