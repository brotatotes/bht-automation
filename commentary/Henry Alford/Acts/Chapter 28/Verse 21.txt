But, as Meyer well remarks, (1)  before his appeal, the Jews in Judæa had no definite reason to communicate with the Jews in Rome respecting him, having no expectation that Paul, then a prisoner in Judæa, and the object of their conspiracies there, would ever go to Rome, or come into connexion with their brethren there. And (2)  since his appeal, it would have been hardly possible for them to have sent messengers who should have arrived before him. For his voyage followed  soon after his appeal (ch. Acts 25:13 ; Act 27:1 ), and was  so late in the year , that for the former reason it is as unlikely that any deputation from them should have left  before him, as for the latter,  after him. Had any left within a few days, the same storm would have in all probability detained them over the winter, and they could not certainly have made a much quicker voyage than Paul’s ship to Puteoli. Still, as casual, non-official tidings might have reached them, Paul shewed this anxiety. It appears, however, that  none had come .
