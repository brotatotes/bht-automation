<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] It may seem strange that they had received no tidings concerning him. But, as Meyer well remarks, (1) <em> before</em> his appeal, the Jews in Judæa had no definite reason to communicate with the Jews in Rome respecting him, having no expectation that Paul, then a prisoner in Judæa, and the object of their conspiracies there, would ever go to Rome, or come into connexion with their brethren there. And (2) <em> since</em> his appeal, it would have been hardly possible for them to have sent messengers who should have arrived before him. For his voyage followed <em> soon after his appeal</em> (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:13">Acts 25:13</span> ; Act 27:1 ), and was <em> so late in the year</em> , that for the former reason it is as unlikely that any deputation from them should have left <em> before</em> him, as for the latter, <em> after</em> him. Had any left within a few days, the same storm would have in all probability detained them over the winter, and they could not certainly have made a much quicker voyage than Paul’s ship to Puteoli. Still, as casual, non-official tidings might have reached them, Paul shewed this anxiety. It appears, however, that <em> none had come</em> . Olshausen’s view, that the banishment of the Jews from Rome under Claudius had interrupted the relations between the Roman and Judæan Jews, is hardly probable: see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:17">Acts 28:17</span> .</p>
