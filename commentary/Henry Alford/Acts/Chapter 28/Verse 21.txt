<b> 21.</b>] It may seem strange that they had received no tidings concerning him. But, as Meyer well remarks, (1)<i> before</i> his appeal, the Jews in Judæa had no definite reason to communicate with the Jews in Rome respecting him, having no expectation that Paul, then a prisoner in Judæa, and the object of their conspiracies there, would ever go to Rome, or come into connexion with their brethren there. And (2)<i> since</i> his appeal, it would have been hardly possible for them to have sent messengers who should have arrived before him. For his voyage followed<i> soon after his appeal</i> (ch. xxv. 13; xxvii. 1), and was<i> so late in the year</i>, that for the former reason it is as unlikely that any deputation from them should have left<i> before</i> him, as for the latter,<i> after</i> him. Had any left within a few days, the same storm would have in all probability detained them over the winter, and they could not certainly have made a much quicker voyage than Paul’s ship to Puteoli. Still, as casual, non-official tidings might have reached them, Paul shewed this anxiety. It appears, however, that<i> none had come</i>. Olshausen’s view, that the banishment of the Jews from Rome under Claudius had interrupted the relations between the Roman and Judæan Jews, is hardly probable: see on ver. 17.
