<b> 3. when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks</b>] “We find the Apostle doing the office of a prisoner, serving the wants of others.” Bengel. From the circumstance of the concealed viper, these sticks were probably heaps of neglected wood gathered in the forest. The difficulty here is, that there are<i> now no venomous serpents</i> in Malta. But as Mr. Smith observes, “no person who has studied the changes which the operations of man have produced on the animals of any country, will be surprised that a particular species of reptiles should have disappeared from Malta. My friend the Rev. Mr. Landsborough, in his interesting excursions in Arran, has repeatedly noticed the gradual disappearance of the viper from the island since it has become more frequented. Perhaps there is nowhere a surface of equal extent in so artificial a state as that of Malta at the present day,—and nowhere has the aboriginal forest been more completely cleared. We need not therefore be surprised that, with the disappearance of the woods, the noxious reptiles which infested them should also have disappeared” (pp. 111, 112). St. Paul had placed the faggot on the fire, and was settling or arranging it in its place, when the viper glided out of the heat and fixed on his hand. The verb in the original implies that the serpent glided out<i> through</i> the sticks.
