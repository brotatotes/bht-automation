 12 .  ἀπεκρίνατο ] viz. to their expressions of astonishment implied in ἔκθαμβοι . See Matthew 11:25 .  ἀπεκρίνατο never signifies ‘  made an address ,’ as Bloomf.; but always ‘answered:’ cf. ch. Acts 5:8 , note. This second discourse of Peter may be thus divided:  This is no work of ours, but of God, for the glorifying of Jesus , Acts 3:12-13 :  whom ye denied and killed, but God hath raised up , Acts 3:13-15 :  through whose name this man is made whole , Acts 3:16 :  ye did it in ignorance, but God thereby fulfilled His counsel , Acts 3:17-18 .  Exhortation to repent, that ye may be forgiven, and saved by this Jesus Christ at His coming , Acts 3:19-21 ;  whose times have been the subject of prophecy from the first , Acts 3:21 .  Citations to prove this , Acts 3:22-24 ;  its immediate application to the hearers, as Jews , Acts 3:25-26 . There the discourse seems to be broken off, as ch. Act 4:1 relates.

	 δυνάμει ,  power , such as  magical craft , or any other supposed means of working miracles:  εὐσεβείᾳ  meritorious efficacy with God, so as to have obtained this from Him  on our own account . The distinction is important: ‘  holiness ,’ of the E. V., is not expressive of εὐσεβ ., which bears in it the idea of  operative, cultive piety, rather than of  inherent character .
