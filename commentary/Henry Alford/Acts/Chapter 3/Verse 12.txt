This second discourse of St. Peter may be thus divided:<i> This is no work of ours, but of God for the glorifying of Jesus</i>, vv. 12, 13:—<i>whom ye denied and killed, but God hath raised up</i>, vv. 13–15:—<i>through whose name this man is made whole</i>, ver. 16:—y<i> e did it in ignorance, but God thereby fulfilled His counsel</i>, vv. 17, 18.<i> Exhortation to repent, that ye may be forgiven, and saved by this Jesus Christ at His coming</i>, vv. 19–21:<i> whose times have been the subject of prophecy from the first</i>, ver. 21.<i> Citations to prove this</i>, vv. 22–24:<i> its immediate application to the hearers, as Jews</i>, vv. 25, 26. There the discourse seems to be broken off, as ch. iv. 1 relates.
