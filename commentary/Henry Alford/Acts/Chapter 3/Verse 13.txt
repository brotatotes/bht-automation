T., et illi periodo temporum conveniens.’ Bengel. ὅρα πῶς αὐτὸν ( τὸν θεὸν ) εἰσωθεῖ συνεχῶς εἰς τοὺς προγόνους · ἵνα μὴ δόξῃ καινόν τι εἰσάγειν δόγμα · καὶ ἐκεῖ (ch. 2) τοῦ πατριάρχου Δαβὶδ ἐμνημόνευσε ,  καὶ ἐνταῦθα τῶν περὶ τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ … (Chrys.).
	 ἐδόξασεν ] not, as E. V., ‘  hath glorified ,’ implying, by  thus honouring His Name : it is the historic aor.,  glorified , viz. by His exaltation through death see John 12:23 ; John 17:10 .
	 παῖδα ] not ‘  Son ,’ but  Servant :  servant , however, in that distinct and Messianic sense which the same expression bears in Isaiah 40-66 in the LXX.
	 υἱός is the word always used to desiguate Jesus as the SON of God. The above meaning is adopted by all the best modern Commentators, Pisc., Bengel, Olsh., Meyer, De W., Stier, some of whom refer to a paper of Nitzsch’s in the Stud. u. Krit. for 1828, Heft 2, p. 331 ff. Olsh. says, ‘After N.’s remarks on the subject, no one hereafter can suppose this expression equivalent to υἱὸς τ . θ .’ “In the next age,” says Wordsw., “the term παῖς θεοῦ was applied to Christ as a  Son . See Polycarp, Mart [36] § 14, p. 1040 (Migne); and S. Hippolyt. Philosoph. x. 33 (in Migne’s Origen, tom. vi. p. 540), and contra Noëtum, § 5, 7, 11, pp. 809 ff. (Migne), and the note of Fabricius, ii. p. 10.”

	 κατὰ πρόσωπον Π  . as E. V., ‘  in the presence of P. ,’ or better perhaps,  to the face of Pilate . The expression is no Hebraism.
