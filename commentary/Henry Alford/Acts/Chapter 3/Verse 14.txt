<b> 14. the Holy One and the Just]</b> Not only in the higher and divine sense present to St. Peter’s mind, but also by Pilate’s<i> own verdict</i>, and the testimony of the Jews’ consciences. ‘The sentence is fnll of antitheses: the “<i>Holy One and the Just</i>” contrasts with the<i> moral</i> impurity of “a murderer,”— “<i>the</i> Prince<i> of life</i>,” with the destruction<i> of life</i> implied in “<i>murderer</i>,”—while “<i>ye killed</i>” again stands in remarkable opposition to “<i>the Prince of</i> life”? This last title given to our Lord implics, as the Vulgate renders it, “<i>the Author of life</i>.”—It is<i> possible</i>, that the words “<i>Prince of life</i>” may contain an allusion to the great miracle which was the immediate cause of the enmity of their rulers to Jesus. But of course St. Peter had a higher view in the title than<i> merely</i> this.
