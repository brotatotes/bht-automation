<p><strong> 16</strong> .] <strong> ἐπὶ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πίστει</strong> … The E. V. is right; through, or better, <strong> on account of faith in His name</strong> . The meaning, <em> for the sake of</em> (i.e. of awakening, in you, and in the lame man himself) <em> faith in his name</em> (Rosenm., Heinrichs, Olsh., Stier), though grammatically justified, seems against the connexion with the μάρτυρές ἐσμεν just before. It is evident to my mind that the πίστις τοῦ ὀν . αὐτ . is the faith of these μάρτυρες . <strong> His name</strong> (the efficient cause), <strong> by means of</strong> , or on account of (our) <strong> faith in His name</strong> (the medium operandi), &amp;c.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐστερ</strong> <strong> .</strong> and <strong> ἔδωκ</strong> <strong> .</strong> again are historic aorists, <strong> confirmed</strong> and <strong> gave</strong> ; better than ‘ <em> hath confirmed</em> ’ and ‘ <em> hath given</em> .’
	</p>
<p><strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡ πίστις ἡ δι</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> <strong> and that faith which is wrought by Him</strong> not ‘faith in Him;’ which is an inadmissible rendering. Peter’s own words (ref. 1 Pet.) are remarkably parallel with, and the best interpreters of, this expression: ὑμᾶς τοὺς <strong> δι</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ πιστοὺς εἰς θεόν</strong> , τὸν ἐγείραντα αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν καὶ δόξαν αὐτῷ δόντα , ὥστε τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν καὶ ἐλπίδα εἶναι εἰς θεόν . Some of the Commentators are anxious to bring in <em> the faith of the lame man himself</em> in this verse. Certainly it is according to analogy to suppose that <em> he had such faith</em> , from and after the words of Peter: but, as certainly, there is <em> no allusion to it in this verse</em> , and the thread of Peter’s discourse would be broken by any such. It is the firm belief in His name <em> on the part of us His witnesses</em> , of which he is here speaking, as the medium whereby His name (= the Power of the great dignity to which He has been exalted, the ἀρχηγία τῆς ζωῆς ) had in this case worked.</p>
