 16 .]  ἐπὶ τ  .   πίστει … The E. V. is right; through, or better,  on account of faith in His name . The meaning,  for the sake of (i.e. of awakening, in you, and in the lame man himself)  faith in his name (Rosenm., Heinrichs, Olsh., Stier), though grammatically justified, seems against the connexion with the μάρτυρές ἐσμεν just before. It is evident to my mind that the πίστις τοῦ ὀν . αὐτ . is the faith of these μάρτυρες .  His name (the efficient cause),  by means of , or on account of (our)  faith in His name (the medium operandi), &c.
	 ἐστερ  . and  ἔδωκ  . again are historic aorists,  confirmed and  gave ; better than ‘  hath confirmed ’ and ‘  hath given .’
	 κ  .   ἡ πίστις ἡ δι  ʼ   αὐτοῦ  and that faith which is wrought by Him not ‘faith in Him;’ which is an inadmissible rendering. Peter’s own words (ref. 1 Pet.) are remarkably parallel with, and the best interpreters of, this expression: ὑμᾶς τοὺς  δι  ʼ   αὐτοῦ πιστοὺς εἰς θεόν , τὸν ἐγείραντα αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν καὶ δόξαν αὐτῷ δόντα , ὥστε τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν καὶ ἐλπίδα εἶναι εἰς θεόν . Some of the Commentators are anxious to bring in  the faith of the lame man himself in this verse. Certainly it is according to analogy to suppose that  he had such faith , from and after the words of Peter: but, as certainly, there is  no allusion to it in this verse , and the thread of Peter’s discourse would be broken by any such. It is the firm belief in His name  on the part of us His witnesses , of which he is here speaking, as the medium whereby His name (= the Power of the great dignity to which He has been exalted, the ἀρχηγία τῆς ζωῆς ) had in this case worked.
