<b> 16.]</b> The A.V. is right;<b> through</b>, or better,<b> on account of, faith in his name</b>. ‘The meaning,<i> for the sake of</i> (i. e. of awakening in you, and in the lame man himself)<i> faith in his name</i>, though grammatically justified, seems against the connexion with the Apostle’s profession, “<i>whereof we are witnesses</i>,” just before. It is evident to my mind, that the faith in His name, here spoken of, is the faith of these witnesses themselves.<b> His name</b> (the efficient cause),<b> by means of</b>, or<b> on account of</b> (our)<b> faith in his name</b> (the medium), &c.<br><br><b> yea, the faith which is [wrought] by him</b>—not ‘faith<i> in</i> Him;’ which is an inadmissible rendering. Peter’s own words (1 Pet. i. 21) are remarkably parallel with, and the best interpreters of, this expression: “<i>who by Him do believe in God that raised Him up from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.”</i> Some of the Commentators are anxious to bring in<i> the faith of the lame man himself</i> in this verse. Certainly it is according to analogy to suppose that<i> he had such faith</i>, from and after the words of Peter:—but, as certainly, there is<i> no allusion to it in this verse</i>, and the thread of Peter’s discourse would be broken by any such, It is the firm belief in His name<i> on the part of us His witnesses</i>, of which he is here speaking, as the medium whereby His name (the Power of the great dignity to which He has been exalted, the authorship of life) had in this case worked.
