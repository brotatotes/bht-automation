<p><strong> κατὰ ἄγνοιαν</strong> ] There need be no difficulty in the application of the ἄγνοια to even the rulers of the Jews. It admits of all degrees from the unlearned, who were implicitly led by others, and hated Him because others did, up to the most learned of the scribes, who knew and rightly interpreted the Messianic prophecies, but from moral blindness, or perverted expectations, did not recognize them in our Lord. Even Caiaphas himself, of whom apparently this could least be said, may be brought under it in some measure: <em> even he</em> could hardly have delivered over Jesus to Pilate with the <em> full</em> consciousness that He was the Messiah, and that he himself was accomplishing prophecy by so doing. <em> Some degree</em> of ἄγνοια there must have been in them all.

<p>The interpretation (Wolf) ‘ <em> ye did, as your rulers</em> ( <em> did</em> ),’ is of course inadmissible, being contrary to the usage of the words: πράσσειν ὥσπερ καί can never mean to imitate, but ἐπράξατε must refer to a definite act (understood), and ὥσπερ καί must take up another subject of ἐπράξατε .</p>
