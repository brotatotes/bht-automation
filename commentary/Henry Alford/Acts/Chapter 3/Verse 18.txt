<b> 18. of all the prophets]</b> See Luke xxiv. 27 and note. There is no hyperbole, nor adaptation to Jewish views. The assertion of the Rabbinical books, “All the prophets together prophesied not but of the days of the Messiah,” was<i> not merely a Jewish view, but the real truth</i>.—The prophets are here regarded as<i> one body</i>, actuated by<i> one Spirit</i>: and the sum of God’s purpose, shewn by their testimony, is, that HIS CHRIST<i> should suffer</i>.
