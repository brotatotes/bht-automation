<b> 19. that your sins may be blotted out]</b> The faith implied in the command, “Be converted,” has for its aim, is necessarily (by God’s covenant, see John iii. 15, 18) accompanied by, the wiping out of sin.<br><br><b> that the times of refreshing may come]</b> This passage has been variously rendered and explained. To deal first with the<i> rendering</i>,—that of the A.V.,— “<i>when the times... shall come</i>,”—is entirely unjustifiable, and alien from the meaning of the words. They can have but one sense,—that given in the marginal reading. This being so,<i> what are</i><b> the times</b> (for such is the right reading, and not “<i>times</i>” only)<b> of refreshment?</b> What is<b> refreshment?</b> Clearly, from the above rendering,<i> some refreshment, future,</i> and which<i> their conversion was to bring about</i>. But hardly, from what has been said, refreshment<i> in their own hearts</i>, arising from their conversion: besides other objections, the following words,<i> may come</i><b> from the presence of the Lord</b>, are not likely to have been used in that case. No other meaning, it seems to me, will suit the words, but that<b> of the times of refreshment</b>, the great season of joy and rest, which it was understood the coming of the Messiah in His glory was to bring with it. That this should be connected by the Apostle with the conversion of the Jewish people, was not only according to the plain inference from prophecy, but doubtless was one of those<i> things concerning the kingdom of God</i>, which he had been taught by his risen Master. The same connexion holds<i> even now</i>. If it be objected to this, that thus we have the conversion of the Jews regarded as<i> bringing about</i> the great times of refreshment, and those times consequently as<i> delayed by their non-conversion</i>, I answer, that, however true this may be in fact, the other is fully borne out by the manner of speaking in Scripture: the same objection might lie against the efficacy of<i> prayer</i>, See Gen. xix. 22; xxxii. 26; Mark vi. 5; 2 Thess. ii. 3; 2 Pet. iii. 12.<br><br><b> from the presence of the Lord</b> (<i>the Father</i>), who has reserved these<i> seasons</i> in His own power. When they arrive, it is by His decree, which goes forth from His presence. Compare the expression “<i>there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus</i>,” in Luke ii. 1.
