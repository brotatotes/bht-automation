Three entrances have been fixed on for the “<i>Beautiful Gate:</i>”<br><br> (1) The gate thus described by Josephus: “Nine of the gates were covered with gold and silver, as were also the posts and lintels. But one gate, that outside the temple itself, was of Corinthian brass, and far surpassed the silver and gilt gates in splendour.” This gate was also called<i> Nicanor’s gate</i>, and lay on the Eastern side of the Temple, towards the valley of Kedron. Josephus mentions it again, as “the Eastern gate of the inner enclosure, which is of brass,” and gives a remarkable account of its size and weight: adding, that when, before the siege, it was discovered supernaturally opened in the night, “this to unskilled persons seemed a most favourable omen: for they said, that God had opened to them the gate of prosperity.” But some find a difficulty in this. The lame man, they say, would not he likely to have been admitted so far into the Temple (but it appears that lepers used to stand at Nicanor’s gate): and besides, he would have taken up his station naturally at an<i> outer gate</i>, where he might ask alms of<i> all</i> who entered. These conditions suit better<br><br> (2) the gate<i> Susan;</i> as does also the circumstance mentioned ver. 11, that the people ran together to<i> Solomon's porch;</i> for this gate was op the east side of the court of the Gentiles, and close to Solomon’s porch. Another suitable circumstance was, that by this gate the market was held for sheep and cattle and other offerings, and therefore a greater crowd would be attracted.<br><br> (3) Others again refer the epithet “Beautiful” to two gates opening towards the city on the western side. So that the matter must remain in uncertainty.
