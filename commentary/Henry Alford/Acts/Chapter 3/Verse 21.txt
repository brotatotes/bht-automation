<b> 21. whom the heaven must receive]</b> The words thus translated admit of a double rendering: (1) ‘<i>Whom the heaven must receive.</i>’ (2) ‘<i>Who must possess the heaven</i>” Of these the former is in my view<i> decidedly preferable</i>, both as best suiting the sense, and as being the natural rendering, whereas the other is forced. The reason given by Bengel for rejecting the right rendering, “To be<i> received</i>, i.e.<i> contained, shut into</i>, the heaven, is a violent interpretation, and seems to imply, that the heaven is<i> greater than</i> Christ, and to detract from His exaltation above all heavens,” is best answered by himself, “Yet there is a sense, in which it may be said that the heaven<i> receives</i> Christ, viz. that it admits Him, as a throne its proper King;” only I would rather understand it<i> locally</i>, and recognize a parallel expression with that in ch. i., also<i> local</i>, “a cloud<i> received Him</i> out of their sight.” And so far from seeing in it any derogation from the Majesty of Christ, it seems to me admirably to set it forth: it behoves the<i> heaven</i> (which is<i> his</i>, obeying his will) to<i> receive Him</i> till the time appointed.
