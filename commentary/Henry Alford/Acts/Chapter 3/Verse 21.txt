<b> 21. whom the heaven must receive]</b> The words thus translated admit of a double rendering: (1) ‘<i>Whom the heaven must receive.</i>’ (2) ‘<i>Who must possess the heaven</i>” Of these the former is in my view<i> decidedly preferable</i>, both as best suiting the sense, and as being the natural rendering, whereas the other is forced. The reason given by Bengel for rejecting the right rendering, “To be<i> received</i>, i.e.<i> contained, shut into</i>, the heaven, is a violent interpretation, and seems to imply, that the heaven is<i> greater than</i> Christ, and to detract from His exaltation above all heavens,” is best answered by himself, “Yet there is a sense, in which it may be said that the heaven<i> receives</i> Christ, viz. that it admits Him, as a throne its proper King;” only I would rather understand it<i> locally</i>, and recognize a parallel expression with that in ch. i., also<i> local</i>, “a cloud<i> received Him</i> out of their sight.” And so far from seeing in it any derogation from the Majesty of Christ, it seems to me admirably to set it forth: it behoves the<i> heaven</i> (which is<i> his</i>, obeying his will) to<i> receive Him</i> till the time appointed.<br><br><b> until]</b> Not<i> during</i>, as the advocates of the<i> present spiritual sense</i> of the passage wish to render it, but<b> until</b>; see below. The key both to the construction and meaning here, is our Lord’s saying, Matt. xvii. 11, “<i>Elias truly first cometh, and shall</i><b> restore all things</b>.” From this we see that<b> the restoration of all things</b> stands alone: and that<b> which</b><i> does not belong</i> to “<i>all things</i>.” Next, what is this<b> restoration</b>? According to the usage of the word, it cannot be applied to the works of the Spirit in the hearts of men, but must be understood of the<i> glorious restoration of all things, the</i><b> regeneration</b> (Matt. xix. 28), which, as Peter here says, is the theme of all the prophets from the beginning.—No objection can be raised to this from the meaning of the word<b> times</b>: see ch, vii. 17, and St. Peter’s own language, 1 Pet. i. 20, “<i>in the last times</i>.”—On the testimony of the prophets, see ver. 18 note.
