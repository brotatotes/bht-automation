<p>The construction of the Vulg., defended by Casaubon and adopted by Valcknaer and Kuinoel, τῶν καθεξῆς ὅσοι ἐλάλ ., ‘et omnes prophetæ a Samuel, et deinceps qui locuti sunt,’ is not so good as the ordinary one in E. V. Cf. ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ Μωυσέως καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν προφ ., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:27">Luke 24:27</span> . Still less admissible is the rendering given in Dr. Burton’s note, as perhaps the literal one, ‘And to the same effect spoke) all the prophets from S. downwards, as many as spoke and predicted these days.’ <em> To what effect?</em> And would not the sentence thus amount to little more than saying, ‘As many prophets as predicted these days, predicted these days?’ Peter’s aim is to shew the unanimity of <em> all the prophets</em> in <em> speaking of these times</em> .

<p>Samuel is named, more as being the <em> first great prophet after Moses</em> , than as bearing any part in this testimony. The prophetic period of which David was the chief prophet, <em> began</em> <strong> in</strong> <em> Samuel</em> (Stier).

<p><strong> τὰς ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ταύτ</strong> .] <strong> These days</strong> , <em> now present</em> , not <em> the times of restoration</em> , as De Wette and others understand: which would require ἐκείνας . ‘ <em> These days</em> ’ are, in fact, <em> connected with</em> the times of restoration, as belonging to the same dispensation and leading on to them; and thus the Apostle identifies the <em> then time</em> with this preparation for ( ὅπως ἂν ἔλθ .) and expectation of ( ἄχρι ) those glories: but to make τὰς ἡμ . ταύτ . <em> identical</em> with the καιροὶ ἀναψ . and the χρόν . ἀποκατ ., is to make him contradict himself.</p>
