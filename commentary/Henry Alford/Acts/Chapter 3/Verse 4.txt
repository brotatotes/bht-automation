<b> 4. Look on us]</b> Calvin’s note is important: “Peter would not have thus spoken without being certain of the design of God; and his words command the man to look for some singular and unusual benefit. Yet we may enquire, whether the Apostles had the power of working miracles when it pleased them. I answer, that their ministration of divine influence: did not empower them to attempt any thing of their own will or motive, but the Lord wrought by them when He saw it expedient. Hence it arose, that they healed one, not all without distinction. So that in this, as in other things, they had God’s Spirit for their guide and direction. Therefore, Before Peter orders the lame man to rise, he cast and fixed his eyes on hin. That look was not without the express prompting of God's Spirit, And hence it was that he spoke with such certainty of the waning miracle, The Apostle suramonel the lame man by this command to receive the gift of God: be for his part looked for nothing but an alms.”
