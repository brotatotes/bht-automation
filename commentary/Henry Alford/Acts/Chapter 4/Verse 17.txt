 17.  διανεμηθῇ  ] be scattered or spread : lit., be distributed: so Plato, Minos, 317 D, τίς ἐπιστήμων διανεῖμαι ἐπὶ γῇ τὰ σπέρματα ; and afterwards, τίς δὲ τὴν τροφὴν ἐπὶ τὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων σώματα διανεῖμαι ἄριστος ;
	[  ἀπειλῇ ]  ἀπειλ  . ] for idiom, see reff.
	The construction of ἀπειλέω with an infin., stated by Dr. Bloomf. to be ‘so rare that even the best lexx. scarcely adduce an example.’ is its  ordinary construction: see Palm and Rost sub voce, and cf. II. α ʹ. 161; ν ʹ. 143; ο ʹ. 179, al. freq.: Od. λ ʹ. 313; Xen. Mem. iii. 5. 4; Hell. v. 4. 7; Eur. Med. 287. The use of the middle in the active sense is confined to later Greek.
