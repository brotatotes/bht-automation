 2. ]  ἐν τ  .   Ἰησ , not, as E. V., ‘  through Jesus,’ but in  the person (or example)  of Jesus , alleging Him as an example of that which the Sadducees denied: preaching by implication, inasmuch as one resurrection would imply that of all, the resurrection of the dead. The ἐν in reff. carries this somewhat further, but the usage is philologically the same. ‘The resurrection  through Jesus’ does not appear on the present occasion to have formed part of their preaching.
