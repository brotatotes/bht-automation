 32.  τῶν πιστευσάντων ] Much the same meaning as τῶν πιστευόντων , but with reference to their having  become converts , and specially to those mentioned in Acts 4:4 , though the description is general. ‘Ubi regnum habet fides, animos ita conciliat ut omnes idem velint et nolint. Hinc enim discordiæ, quod non regimur eodem Christi Spiritu.’ Calvin. On the community of goods, see note at ch. Acts 2:45 . We have the view there taken strikingly confirmed here by the expressions used.  No one called (reckoned)  any thing of his goods (which were still τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῷ , not alienated) (  to be) his own . (  ἔλεγεν ,  dicebat : hoc ipso præsupponitur  proprietatem possessionis non plane fuisse deletam. Bengel.)
