<b> 33.]</b> The Apostles were the specially appointed witnesses of the Resurrection, ch. i. 22: and this their testimony they gave<i> with power</i>, i.e. with a special gift of the Holy Spirit to enforce and illustrate, to persuade and dispute on, those facts of which their own experience (see ver. 20) informed them. That the Spirit did not inspire them with unbroken uniformity in<i> matters of fact</i>, our present Gospels, the remnants to us of this very testimony, sufficiently witness. Nor was this necessary: each man reported what he had heard and seen;—and it was in the<i> manner</i> of delivering this report that the great power of the Spirit was shewn. See, on the whole subject, Introduction, ch. i.§iii. 5 ff.<br><br><b> great grace</b>, i.e. from God: this is better than to understand it “<i>great favour</i>,” i.e. from the people, which would hardly be so absolutely designated.
