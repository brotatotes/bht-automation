 4. ]  ἐγενήθη This form is unknown in good Greek: but common in Hellenistic, see Colossians 4:11 ; 1 Thessalonians 2:14 ; Winer, § 15. It appears to have been originally a Doric form: and is commonly, though this cannot always be pressed (1 Thessalonians 1:5-6 ; 1 Thessalonians 2:5 , and notes there), used where a passive sense is admissible, and an agent understood: cf. e.g. Matthew 6:10 ; Matthew 8:13 ; Matthew 21:42 . Here the agent would be God: see ch. Acts 2:47 .
	 τῶν ἀνδρῶν ] It does not appear whether we are to take this strictly as masculine, or more loosely as if it were ἀνθρώπων : Meyer thinks the former: Olshausen, that as yet only  men attached themselves to the church (but see ch. Act 1:14 ): De Wette objects to the stricter view, that Luke does not so reckon, ch. Acts 2:41 (see however Luke 9:14 , and cf. [38] Mt.): but leaves it undecided. The laxer use of ἀνδρῶν occurs Luke 11:31 , and James 1:20 . In ch. Acts 5:14 ,  men and women both are mentioned as being added to the Lord.
	 [38] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
	Wordsw. sees in the 5000 ἄνδρες a fulfilment of the prophecy contained in the miracle of feeding the 5000. But how will the circumstances tally, seeing that these were but new converts, babes in grace, not yet fed to the full as were those others? And again, it is not quite certain whether this number was that of new converts on this occasion, or of the whole Church: but most probably the latter.
