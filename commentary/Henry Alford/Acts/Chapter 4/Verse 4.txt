<b> 4. the number of the men]</b> The Greek word for “<i>men</i>” here is that which signifies males as distinguished from females. But it does not appear whether we are to take this strictly as masculine, or more loosely, as if it were the more general term. Meyer thinks the former: Olshausen, that as yet only<i> men</i> attached themselves to the church (but see ch. i. 14): De Wette objects to the stricter that St. Luke does not so reckon, ch. ii, 4 (see however Luke ix. 14, and cf. the parallel place in Matthew): but leaves it undecided. The laxer use of this stricter term occurs Luke xi. 31, and James i. 20. In ch. v. 14,<i> men</i> and<i> women</i> both are mentioned as being added to the Lord.
