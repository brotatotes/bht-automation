 9. ]  εἰ ,  if , with an implication of the fact being so: see ch. Acts 11:17 .
	 ἐν τίνι , not ‘by (in)  whom ,’ this is not yet brought forward: but  wherein , in what, as the conditional element.

On the other hand,  ἐν τούτῳ , Acts 4:10 , may very well be masculine, as referring to Ἰησοῦς χρ . Himself, included in the previous words τῷ ὀν . Ἰ . χρ .: it may also be neuter, ‘in this Name:’ but the masc. is preferable, on account of οὗτος following so soon in Acts 4:11 .
