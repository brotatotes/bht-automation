It docs not follow from the word all referring to<i> all the believers</i> in ch. ii. 1 (see note there), that it necessarily refers to the same here also. The Apostles are<i> the subject of the paragraph:</i> and it is to set forth<i> their</i> unanimity and dignity that the description is given. They are represented as distinct from all others, believers and unbelievers (both which I take to be included under the term “<i>the rest</i>”): and the Jewish people itself magnified them.
