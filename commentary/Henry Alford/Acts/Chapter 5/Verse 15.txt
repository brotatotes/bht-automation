<b> 15.]</b> This verse now takes up afresh the main subject of vv. 12 and 13, the glorification of the apostolic office,<b> insomuch that...</b> It is connected not only with the multitude magnifying them, but also with ver. 12.<br><br><b> into the streets]</b> literally,<b> down [the] streets</b>, i.e.<i> in the line of the streets.</i><br><br><b> the shadow of Peter]</b> As the greatest, in pre-eminence and spiritual energizing, of the Apostles. Now especially was fulfilled to him the promise of Matt. xvi. 18 (see note there):—and even the shadow of the<i> Rock</i> (Isa. xxxii. 2, Heb., and E.V., spoken primarily of His divine Master) was sought for. We need find no stumbling-block in the fact of Peter’s<i> shadow</i> having been believed to be the medium (or, as is surely implied,<i> having been</i> the medium) of working miracles. Cannot the ‘Creator Spirit’ work with any instruments, or with none, as pleases Him? And what is a hand or a voice, more than a shadow, except that the analogy of the ordinary instrument is a greater help to faith in the recipient? Where faith, as apparently here, did not need this help, the less likely medium was adopted.—<b>See</b>, on the whole, ch. xix. 12, and note: and remark that only in the case of our Lord (Luke viii. 46 and parallel places) and His two great Apostles in the New Test.,—and of Elisha in the Old Test., have we instances of this<i> healing virtue in the mere contact with or accessories of the person.</i> But what a fertile harvest of superstition and imposture has been made to spring out of these scanty examples!
