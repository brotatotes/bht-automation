<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] <strong> τῆς ζωῆς ταύτης</strong> , an unusual expression, seems to refer to the peculiar nature of the enmity shewn towards them by the Saddueees, for preaching the ἀνάστασις ζωῆς ‘of <em> this</em> LIFE, which they call in question.’ Or perhaps τ . ζ . τ . may import the religion of Jesus having its issue in <em> life</em> . A similar expression, ὁ λόγος τῆς σωτηρίας ταύτης , occurs ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:26">Acts 13:26</span> . See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span> . But beware of assuming in either of these passages the use of the figure called by the grammarians hypallage, so that τὰ ῥ . τῆς ζ . ταύτης = τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα τῆς ζωῆς : for thus the sense is enervated, and the peculiar reference in each case lost. The indiscriminate application of these supposed figures of speech has been, and continues to be, one of the worst foes of sound exegesis.
