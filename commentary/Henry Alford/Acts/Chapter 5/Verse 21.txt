	 παραγενόμενος ] to the ordinary session chamber in the Temple, on the south side of it (Winer, Realw.): and therefore, if the Apostles were teaching  in Solomon’s porch ( Act 5:12 ), not in their immediate vicinity. Perhaps the παραγενόμενος … συνεκάλεσαν …, implying that the summons was not issued till  after the arrival of the H. P. and his friends , may point to a meeting of the Sanhedrim hurriedly and insufficiently called, for the purpose of ‘packing’ it against the Apostles. If so, they did not succeed, see Acts 5:40 ; perhaps on account of the arrival of some who had been listeners to the Apostles’ preaching.
	 πᾶσαν τ  .   γερουσίαν ] Probably the πρεσβύτεροι , including perhaps some who were not members of the Sanhedrim; the well-known foes of Jesus and his doctrine. The expression π . τ . γερους . τῶν υἱ . Ἰσραήλ , common in the LXX, is perhaps translated from the form of words in which they were summoned. γερουσία , being the ordinary word for the πρεσβύτεροι , would be the Hellenistic formal expression.
