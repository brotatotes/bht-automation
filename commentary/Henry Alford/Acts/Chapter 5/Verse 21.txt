<b> 21.] at the break of day</b>: see Luke xxiv. 1, margin.<br><br><b> The high priest came</b> to the ordinary session-chamber in the Temple, on the south side of it, and therefore if the Apostles were teaching in<i> Solomon’s porch</i> (ver. 12), not in their immediate vicinity. Perhaps the words, which imply that the summons was not issued till<i> after the arrival of the High Priest and his friends</i>, may point to a meeting of the Sanhedrim hurriedly and insufficiently called, for the purpose of ‘packing’ it against the Apostles. If so, they did not succeed, see ver. 40: perhaps on account of the arrival of some who had been listeners to the Apostles’ preaching.<br><br><b> all the senate]</b> Probably the<i> elders</i>, including perhaps some who were not members of the Sanhedrim: the well-known foes of Jesus and his doctrine The expression,<b> the senate of the children of Israel</b>, common in the LXX, is perhaps translated from the form of words in which they were summoned.
