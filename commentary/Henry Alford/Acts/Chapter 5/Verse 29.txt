<b> 29.] Peter</b>, by word of mouth;<b> the Apostles</b>, as a body, by<i> assent</i>, implied in<i> his own utterance</i> and<i> their silence</i>. There is no occasion to insert “<i>other</i>,” as done in the A.V.—This defence of Peter divides itself into the propositions of an ordinary syllogism— (1)<i> The statement of the general truth that we must obey God rather than men:</i> (2)<i> The reduction of the present circumstances under that general truth</i>, as being the work of the God of their Fathers—shewn in his having raised and glorified Jesus, for a definite purpose, to give, &c.— (3)<i> The</i> identification of themselves with the course<i> of action marked out by the duty of obeying God rather than men</i>... in that they were bearing witness to God’s work, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit given them as men obedient to God.—The whole is a<i> perfect model of concise and ready eloquence, and of unanswerable logical coherence;</i> and a notable fulfilment of the promise “it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak” (Matt. x. 19).
