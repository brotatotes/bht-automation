<b> 31.] with</b> (not<i> to</i>)<b> his right hand</b>, as in ch. ii. 33, where see note. The great aim here, as there, is to set forth God as the DOER of all this.<br><br><b> a Prince and a Saviour</b>, not, ‘<i>to be</i> a Prince and a Savior:” but the words are the predicate of<b> Him</b>—<b>as a Prince and a Saviour</b>.<br><br><b> a Prince]</b> as in ch. iii. 15, which see.<br><br><b> and a Saviour]</b> Jesus was to be King and Captain<b> of Israel</b>, and<i> also their Saviour</i>, The two offices, though inseparably connected in fact, had each its separate meaning in Peter’s speech:<i> a Prince</i>—to whom you owe obedience—<i>a Saviour</i>, by whom you must be saved from your sins.<br><br><b> for to give, in his</b><i> Kingly</i> prerogative;<b> repentance and remission of sins</b>, to lead to salvation hy him as a<i> Saviour</i>.—The key to this part of the speech is Luke xxiv. 47–49, where we have, in our Lord’s command to them, the same conjunction ‘of<i> repentance and re-mission of sins</i>,—and immediately follows, as here, “<i>ye are witnesses of these things</i>,” appointing them to that office which they were now discharging,—and, parallel with the mention of the Holy Ghost in our text, there follows there, “<i>and behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you</i>.” By conjoining the Holy Ghost, as a witness, with themselves,—they claim and assert the promise of John xv. 26, 27: see also the apostolic letter of ch. xv. 28. When we remember how much of the apostolic testimony was given in<i> writing</i>, as well as by word of mouth, this declaration of Peter becomes an important element for judging of the nature of that testimony also. See a very similar conjunction, 1 John v. 9.—<i>They</i> were God’s witnesses, in the things which they had seen and heard as men: the<i> Holy Ghost in them</i> was God’s Witness, in purifying and enlarging by His inspiration that their testimony to facts, and in unfolding, from (and as inseparable from) these witnessed facts,—<i>the things which eye hath not seen nor ear heard</i>. And<i> in the Scripture</i> THESE SAME TESTIMONIES are conjoined;<i> that of the Apostles</i>, holy men under the guidance and reminiscence of the Holy Spirit, faithfully and honestly reporting those things which fall under human observation: and<i> that of God the Spirit Himself</i>, testifying, through them, those loftier things which no human experience can assure, nor human imagination compass.
