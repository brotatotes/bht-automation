So that the sense of the whole is, ‘We are acting in obedience to God, and for the everlasting good of our common Israel: and otherwise we cannot do.’ And a soleinn invitation is implied ‘<i>Be ye obedient likewise</i>.’ It is remarkable that a similar word, “<i>were obedient to the faith</i>,” is used of the multitude of converted priests, ch. vi. 7.
