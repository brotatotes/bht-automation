<b> 34.] Gamaliel</b> (see Num. i. 10; ii, 20) is generally, and not without probability, assumed to be identical with the celebrated Rabban Gamaliel, also entitled “<i>the old man</i>,” one of the seven, to whom, among their Rabbis, the Jews give this title Rabban, a wise and enlightened Pharisee, the son of Rabban Symeon (traditionally the Symeon of Luke ii, 25) and grandson of the famous Hillel. His name often appears in the Talmud, as an utterer of sayings quoted as authorities. Ile died eighteen years before the destruction of the city. He was the preceptor of St. Paul (ch. xxii. 3). Ecclesiastical tradition makes him become a Christian, and be baptized by Peter and John, and in the Clementine Recognitions, he is stated to have been at this time a Christian, but secretly. The Jewish accounts do not agree, which make him die a Pharisee, with much more probability. Nor is the least trace of a Christian leaning to be found in his speech: see below on ver. 39. And considering that he was a Pharisee, opposing the prevalent faction of Sadduceism in a matter where the Resurrection was called in question,—and a wise and enlightened man opposing furious and unreasoning zealots,—considering also, that when the<i> anti-pharisaical</i> element of Christianity was brought out in the acts and sayings of Stephen, his pupil Saul was found the foremost persecutor,—we should, I think, be slow to suspect him of any favouring of the Apostles<i> as followers of Jesus</i>. (See particulars respecting Gamaliel collected in Conybeare and Howson’s St. Paul, edn. 2, vol. i.p. 69, f.) He does not here appear as the president of the Sanhedrim, but only as a member.
