<b> 36.]</b> A great chronological difficulty arises here. Josephus relates, that when Cuspius Fadus was Procurator of Judæa, an impostor named Theudas persuaded a very great multitude to break up their households and follow him to the Jordan, in expectation that he would divide the river for them to go over. He then relates how Fadus sent a squadron of horse against him, killing many of his followers, and taking many prisoners, and bringing his head to Jerusalem. But this was in the reign of Claudius, not before the year A. D, 44: and consequently at least _ twelve years after this speech of Gamaliel’s. On this difficulty I will remark, that we are plainly<i> in no position</i> (setting all other considerations aside) to charge St. Luke with having put into the mouth of Gamaliel words which he could not have uttered. For Josephus himself, speaking of a time which would accord very well with that referred to by Gamaliel, viz. the time when Archelaus went to Rome to be confirmed in the kingdom, says, “Meantime numerous seditional movements took place among the Jews, many men feeding their own ambition by the enmity of the Jews against the Romans, and breaking out in acts of war.” And among these there may well have been an impostor of this name. But all attempts to identify Theudas with any other leader of outbreaks mentioned by Josephus have failed to convince any one except their propounders. See them quoted in my Greek Test. The assumption of Josephus having<i> misplaced his Theudas</i> is perhaps improbable; but<i> by no means impossible</i>, in an historian<i> teeming with inaccuracies</i>. All we can say is, that such impostors were too frequent, for any one to be able to say that there was not one of this name, which was by no means uncommon, at the time specified. It is exceedingly improbable, considering the time and circumstances of the writing of the Acts, and the evident supervision of them by St. Paul, the pupil of Gamaliel, that a gross historical mistake should have been here put into his mouth.<br><br><b> about four hundred</b> hardly agrees with Josephus’s words above, “<i>a very great multitude</i>,” which may mean even more,<i> the greatest part of the multitude:</i> and this confirms the idea that different events are pointed at in the two accounts. But the Jewish historian speaks very widely about such matters: see note on ch. xxi. 38.
