<b> 4.] Whiles it remained, did it not remain</b> (so literally)<b> thine own?</b> i.e. was it not in thine absolute power?<b> and when sold, was it not</b> (i. e. the price of it)<b> in thine own power</b>, to do with it what seemed good to thee?<br><br><b> why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?</b> literally,<b> put this thing in thine heart</b>, Dan. i. 8; Mal. ii. 2. Satan suggested the lie, which Ananias ought to have repelled; instead of that,<i> he put it in his heart</i>,—placed it there where the springs of action are, and it passed out into an act.<br><br><b> thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God]</b> This mode of expression,<b> not... but...</b> is not always an absolute and exclusive negation and assertion, see Mark ix. 37; John xii. 44. But here it seems to be so, and to imply, ‘Thine attempt to deceive was not to deceive<i> us</i>, men; but to deceive the Holy Ghost,—God, abiding in His church, and in us its appointed superintendents.’ This verse is of weighty doctrinal import, as proving the Deity of the Holy Spirit; unless it be held, that the Holy Spirit whom (ver. 3) Ananias attempted to deceive, and God to whom he lied, are<i> different</i>. Bengel says, “This is the meaning: Ananias lied to God and His Spirit, not to men and Peter. Dare if thou canst, O Socinian, to say, he lied not to the Holy Ghost and to Peter, but to God.”
