<b> 6.]</b> Were these<b> young men</b> a class<i> in the congregation</i> accustomed to perform such services,—or merely the younger men, from whom they would naturally be expected? Some maintain the former: some the latter. We can hardly assume, as yet, any such official distinctions in the congregation as would mark off younger men from the<i> elders</i>, which latter are first officially mentioned ch. xi. 30. Besides which, we have no such ecclesiastical class as<i> these younger men</i>. And the use of a different word in the original, “<i>the youths</i>,” in ver. 10, as applying to these same persons, seems to decide that, they were<i> merely the younger members</i> of the church, acting perhaps in accordance with Jewish custom,—perhaps also on some hint given by Peter.
