Some maintain the former: some the latter. We can hardly assume, as yet, any such official distinctions in the congregation as would mark off younger men from the<i> elders</i>, which latter are first officially mentioned ch. xi. 30. Besides which, we have no such ecclesiastical class as<i> these younger men</i>. And the use of a different word in the original, “<i>the youths</i>,” in ver. 10, as applying to these same persons, seems to decide that, they were<i> merely the younger members</i> of the church, acting perhaps in accordance with Jewish custom,—perhaps also on some hint given by Peter.<br><br><b> wound him up]</b> So Ezek. xxix. 5; Tobit xii. 13; Ecclus. xxxviii. 16,<b> wrapped the body up</b>,—probably in their own mantles, taken off in preparing to carry him out.
