<p><strong> 6</strong> .] Were <strong> οἱ νεώτεροι</strong> a <em> class in the congregation</em> accustomed to perform such services, or merely the younger men, from whom they would naturally be expected? Meyer and Olshausen (also Mosh. and Kuin.) maintain the former; Neander and De W. the latter. We can hardly assume, as yet, any such official distinctions in the congregation as would mark off οἱ νεώτεροι from οἱ πρεσβύτεροι , which latter are first officially mentioned ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span> . Besides which, we have no such ecclesiastical class as οἱ νεώτεροι . And the use of οἱ <strong> νεανίσκοι</strong> in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:10">Acts 5:10</span> , as applying to these same persons, seems to decide that they were <em> merely the younger members</em> of the church, acting perhaps in accordance with Jewish custom, perhaps also on some hint given by Peter.

<p>The speedy burial of the dead, practised among the later Jews, was unknown in earlier times, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+23:0">Genesis 23:0</span> . It was grounded on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+19:11">Numbers 19:11</span> ff. The practice was to bury before sunset of the same day. The <em> immediate</em> burial in this case adds to the probability that the young men obeyed an intimation from the Apostle.</p>
