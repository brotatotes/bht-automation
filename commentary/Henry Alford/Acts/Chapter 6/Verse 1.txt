<b> 1.] But</b>, in contrast to the former entire unity of the church: introducing that great and important chapter in her history, of<i> Judaizing</i><i> divisions</i>, which from this time onward disquieted her.<br><br><b> in these days]</b> See ch. i. 15:—but not necessarily as there, ‘within a very few days:’ the expression is quite indefinite. Some time must have elapsed since ch, iv. 32.<br><br> The<b> Hellenists</b> were the<i> Grecian Jews:</i> not only those who were<i> themselves</i> proselytes, nor only those who<i> came of families</i> once proselytized,—but all who, on account of origin or habitation, spoke Greek as their ordinary language, and used ordinarily the LXX version.—The<i> Hebrews</i> were the<i> pure Jews</i>, not necessarily<i> resident in Palestine</i> (for example, St. Paul, who was “an Hebrew, descended from Hebrews,” Phil. iii. 5. See also 2 Cor. xi. 22),—nor necessarily of<i> unmixed Jewish descent</i>, else the words of St. Paul just cited would hardly have conveyed an additional distinction,—but rather distinguished by<i> language</i>, as speaking the Syro-Chaldaic, and using the Hebrew Scriptures.<br><br><b> were neglected]</b> literally,<b> overlooked</b>. The use of this appropriate word shews, I think, that Olshausen’s supposition, that the term,<b> their widows</b>, implies<i> all their poor</i>, is not correct. Those poor who could attend for themselves and represent their case, were served: but the<i> widows</i>, who required more searching out at their own houses, were overlooked. And this because the Apostles, who certainly before this had the charge of the duty of distribution, being already too much occupied in the ministry of the Word to attend personally to it, had entrusted it apparently to some deputies among the<i> Hebrews</i>, who had committed this oversight. It has been shewn by Biscoe, that the Hellenistic Jews were held in low estimation by the Hebrews.<br><br><b> in the daily ministration]</b> Some have argued from this, that there must have been ‘deacons’ before: and that those now elected (see below on their names) were only for the service of the Hellenistic Jews. But I should rather believe that the Apostles had as yet, by themselves or by non-official deputies, performed the duty. The<b> ministration</b> spoken of was the daily distribution of food: see on ver. 2.
