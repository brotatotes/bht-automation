<p><strong> 15</strong> .] It is a question with regard to this verse, Does it relate any <em> supernatural appearance, glorifying the face of Stephen</em> , or merely describe the calm and holy aspect with which he stood before the council? The majority of Commentators suppose the latter: and certainly the foregoing description of Stephen would lead us to infer, that there was something remarkably striking in his appearance and demeanour, which overawed his adversaries. But both from the plain language of our text, well understood among the Jews to signify supernatural brightness (see examples in Wetstein), and from the fact that in Luke’s own narrative we have supernatural brightness associated with angelic appearances more than once (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span> ; ch. Act 12:7 ), I should be inclined to think that the face of the martyr was <em> lighted up with a divine radiance</em> . That the effect on those present was not such as to prevent the examination proceeding, is no argument against this view: in the very mildness of the question of the H. P. which follows, I see the trace of some unusual incident exercising an influence over him. Chrysostom (who does not, however, seem to adopt the above interpretation, his τοῦτο καὶ ἡ δόξα Μωυσέω being apparently only rhetorical) explains well the effect on the council: ἐπίχαριν δὲ αὐτὸν δοκεῖ μοι ποιῆσαι τὸν θεόν , τάχα ἐπεὶ ἔμελλε τινὰ ἐρεῖν , καὶ ἵνα εὐθέως τῇ προσόψει καταπλήξῃ αὐτούς . ἔστι γάρ , ἔστι καὶ πρόσωπα χάριτος γέμοντα πνευματικῆς ἐπέραστα τοῖς ποθοῦσιν εἶναι , καὶ αἰδέσιμα τοῖς μισοῦσι καὶ φοβερά . ἢ καὶ ὡς αἰτίαν τοῦτο εἶπεν , δι ʼ ἥν ἠνέσχοντο τῆς δημηγορίας αὐτοῦ . τί δαὶ ὁ ἀρχιερεύς ; … ὁρᾷς πῶς μετὰ ἐπιεικείας ἡ ἐρώτησις καὶ οὐδὲν τέως φορτικὸν ἔχουσα ; In Act. Homil. xv. p. 120.</p>
