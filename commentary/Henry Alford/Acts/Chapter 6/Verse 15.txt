<b> 15.]</b> It is a question with regard to this verse, Does it relate any s<i> upernatural appearance, glorifying the face of Stephen</i>,—or merely describe the calm and holy aspect with which he stood before the council? The majority of commentators suppose the latter: and certainly the foregoing description of Stephen would lead us to infer, that there was something remarkably striking in his appearance and demeanour, which over-awed his adversaries. But both from the plain language of our text, well understood among the Jews to signify supernatural brightness, and from the fact that in St. Luke’s own narrative we have supernatural brightness associated with angelic appearances more than once (see Luke ii. 9; ch. xii. 7), I should be inclined to think that the face of the martyr was<i> lighted up with a divine radiance.</i> That the effect on those present was not such as to prevent the examination proceeding, is no argument against this view: in the very mildness of the question of the High Priest which follows, I see the trace of some unusual incident exercising an influence over him. Chrysostom explains well the effect on the council: “God seems to me to have made him beautiful to look at, perhaps to prepare the way for his speech, and that he might immediately strike them with his look. For there is, yea there is, in faces full of spiritual grace that which is lovely to those that love them, and strikes awe and fear into those that hate them. Or perhaps the Evangelist mentions it to account for their tolerating his speech. For what answer does the High Priest make? Do you see, how mildly and unreproachfully he puts his question?”
