<b> 2.] the multitude of the disciples,</b>—i. e. ‘the<i> whole number</i> of disciples in Jerusalem:’ summoning a general meeting of the church. How many they were in number at the time, is not said. Clearly the 120 names of ch. i. 15 cannot be meant.<br><br><b> It is not our pleasure]</b> Not,<i> it is not reasonable</i>, as Beza, Calvin, and the A.V. The meaning of the original word is always as above.<br><br><b> leave the word of God]</b> For to this it would come, if the Apostles were to enquire into, and do justice in, every case of asserted neglect.<br><br><b> serve tables]</b> It is a question, whether this expression import the service of distributing money—or that of apportioning the daily public meals. The latter seems to me most probable, both on account of. the word “<i>daily</i>” above, and of the usage of the word<i> ministration</i>. That both kinds of tables may be meant, is possible: but hardly probable.
