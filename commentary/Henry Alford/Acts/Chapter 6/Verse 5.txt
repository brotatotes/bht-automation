<b> 5.] full of faith</b>,—not in the lower sense of ‘truthfulness,’ but in the higher of<b> faith</b>, the root of all Christian virtues: see ch. xi. 24.—Of these seven, Stephen and Philip (ch. viii. 5, 26, 40; xxi. 8) only are elsewhere mentioned. On the idea of Nicolas having founded the heretical sect of the Nicolaitans, Rev. ii. 6, 15, see note there. From his being called<b> a proselyte of Antioch</b>, some have argued that<i> he only</i> was a proselyte, and none of the rest: some that<i> all</i> were proselytes,—but the rest, of Jerusalem. But neither inference seems justified: rather I should say that the addition simply imports that he became better known than the rest, from the very circumstance perhaps of Antioch having been afterwards so important a spot in the Christian history (ch. xi, 19, note).—These names are all Greek: but we cannot thence infer that the seven were all Hellenistic Jews: the Apostles Philip and Andrew bore Greek names, but were certainly not Hellenists. There does appear however, in the ease of these two Apostles, to have been a connexion with Greeks of some sort, see John xii, 20–22. Possibly, though<i> Hebrews</i>, they may not have been<i> descended from Hebrews</i> (see above on ver. 1), but sprung from intermarriage with Hellenists. And so these seven may have been partly Hebrews, though their names seem to indicate, and their office would appear to require, that they were connected with Hellenists, and not likely to overlook or disparage them. The title of ‘<i>deacons</i>’ is nowhere applied to these seven in Scripture, nor does the occur in the Acts at all. In 1 Tim. iii. 8 ff. there is no absolute identification of the duties of deacons with those allotted to these seven, but at the same time nothing to imply that they were different. The universal consent of all Christian writers in regarding this as the institution of the office of deacons should not be overlooked: but at the same time we must be careful not to imagine that we have here the institution of the<i> ecclesiastical order</i> so named. The distinctness of the two is stated by Chrysostom plainly, whose opinion is that these are not to be confounded with any ecclesiastical order, but were merely appointed for the purpose then in hand. So also Œcumenius. But that the subsequent office of deacon was founded upon this appointment, is very probable. The only one of these seven who appears in the subsequent history (ch. xxi. 8) is called “<i>Philip the Evangelist</i>,” probably from the success granted him as recorded in ch. viii. 12. In these early days titles sprung out of realities, and were not yet mere hierarchical classifications.
