	 πολὺς ὄχλ  .   τ  .   ἱερέων ] The number of priests who returned from Babylon, Ezra 2:36-39 , was 4289: and the number would probably have much increased since then. No evasion of the historian’s assertion is to be attempted. Casaubon, approved by Beza and Valcknaer, would read, πολύς τε ὄχλος , καὶ τῶν ἱερέων (sc. τινὲς ) ὑπ .; and Heinsius, Wolf, Kuinoel, and Eisner attempt a distinction between ὄχλος τῶν ἱερ ., ‘sacerdotes ex plebe,’ and the ‘sacerdotes docti.’ But, besides that the words will not bear this meaning, the distinction is one wholly unknown in the N. T.
	At this time was probably the  culminating point of popularity of the church at Jerusalem . As yet, all seemed going on prosperously for the conversion of Israel. The multitude honoured the Apostles: the advice of Gamaliel had moderated the opposition of the Sanhedrim: the priests were gradually being won over. But God’s designs were far different. At this period another great element in the testimony of the church is brought out, in the person of Stephen, its  protest against Pharisaism . This arrays against it that powerful and zealous sect, and henceforward it finds neither favour nor tolerance with either of the parties among the Jews, but increasing and bitter enmity from them both.
