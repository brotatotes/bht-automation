<b> 9.]</b> The word<b> Libertines</b> is rightly explained by Chrysostom to mean, the<i> freedmen</i> of the Romans. Philo speaks of a large district of Rome beyond the Tiber as inhabited by Jews, who were mostly freedmen that had originally been brought in captivity to Italy. Tacitus relates under A.D. 19, that a decree of the senate passed, to banish to Sardinia four thousand libertines or freedmen, who were inf Jewish and Egyptian superstitions, and the rest were ordered either to abjure their religion or to leave Italy. In this Josphus agrees, relating a story as one of is causes, in which Ida, a freedwoman, was the agent of the mischief. Here then we have abundant reason for numbers of these Jews of libertine race having come to Jerusalem, being among<i> the rest</i>, who were ordered to quit Italy: and what. place so likely a refuge for Jews as Jerusalem?—Those who find a difficulty in this interpretation suppose them to have been inhabitants of Libertum, a town in<i> proper</i> or<i> proconsular</i> Africa, from which we find a bishop of Libertum sitting in the synod of Carthage in 411. But none of their suppositions will bear examination, and the best interpretation is the usual one—that they were the descendants of Jewish freedmen at Rome, who had been expelled by Tiberius.—There is no difficulty in their having had a synagogue of their own: for there were 460 or 480 synagogues at Jeru-salem.
