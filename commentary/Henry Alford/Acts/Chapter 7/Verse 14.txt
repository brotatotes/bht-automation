<b> 14. threescore and fifteen souls</b>] In the Hebrew text, Gen. xlvi. 27; Exod. i. 5; Deut. x. 22,<i> seventy</i> souls are reckoned, viz. sixty-six born of Jacob, Jacob himself, Joseph, and his two sons born in Egypt. So also Josephus. But the LXX, whom Stephen follows, insert in Gen. xlvi. 20 an account of the children and grandchildren of Manasseh and Ephraim, five in number: and in ver. 27 read thus: “<i>And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in the land of Egypt, were nine souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, which entered with Jacob into Egypt, were seventy-five:</i>”—reckoning, as it appears, curiously enough, among the sons of Joseph,<i> Joseph himself</i>, and<i> his wife Asenath;</i> for these are required to make up the<i> nine</i>, according to their ver. 20. And similarly in Exod. i. 5, and in some copies in Deut. x. 22. With regard to the various attempts to solve the difficulty, see in my Greek Testament.
