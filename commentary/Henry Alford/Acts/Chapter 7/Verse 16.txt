<b> 16.</b>]<b> were carried over</b>, viz.<i> he and our fathers,</i> not the latter only,—as some commentators have suggested, to evade part of the difficulty of the verse.—The facts, as related in the Old Testament, were these: Jacob, dying in Egypt, was (Gen. i. 13) taken into the land of Canaan, and buried in the cave of Macpelah, before Mamre (on the rest of the verse see below): Joseph, dying also in Egypt, was taken in a coffin (Gen. l. 26) at the Exodus (Exod. xiii. 19), and finally buried (Josh. xxiv. 32) at Shechem. Of the burial of the other patriarchs the sacred text says nothing, but rather by the specification in Exod. xiii. 19, leaves it to be inferred that they were buried in Egypt. Josephus, Antt. ii. 8. 2, relates that they were taken and buried in<i> Hebron</i>, and adds, “of whom the graves are shewn even to my time in the fortress Hebron, of very beautiful marble, and sumptuously wrought.” The Rabbinical traditions report them to have been buried in<i> Sychem:</i> and Jerome, relating the pilgrimages of Paula to the sacred places, says, “She passed by Sychem, and turning aside there saw the sepulchre of the twelve patriarchs.” These traditions probably Stephen followed; and, in haste or inadvertence, classed<i> Jacob</i> with the rest.
