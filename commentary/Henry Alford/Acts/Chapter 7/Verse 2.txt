<b> 2. Brethren</b> (men who are brethren),<b> and fathers</b>] So Paul, ch. xxii. 1, before a mixed assembly of Jews. The<b> brethren</b> would embrace all: the<b> fathers</b> would be a title of respect to the members of the Sanhedrim, in<i> this case</i>, but hardly in ch. xxii. 1.<br><br><b> The God of glory</b>] Not equivalent to<i> the glorious God</i>,<b> but the God of</b> (i. e. who possesses and manifests Himself by)<b> glory</b>, viz. the Shechinah, or divine appearance, see Exod. xxiv. 16, 17, and ver. 55.—The words<b> our father</b> decide nothing as to Stephen’s genuine Hebrew extraction. Any Jew would thus speak.<br><br><b> before he dwelt in Charran</b>] This was the Jewish tradition, though not asserted in Genesis. Thus Philo, having paraphrased the divine command, says, “For this reason Abraham is said to have made his first move from the land of the Chaldæans to that of the Charræans.” But he accurately distinguishes between the<i> divine command</i>, which he obeyed in leaving Chaldæa, and the<i> vision</i> afterwards, adding a reason after his manner, why God could not be seen nor apprehended by him while he was yet a Chaldæan and an astrologer. The fact of his having left Ur by<i> some divine intimation</i> is plainly stated in Gen. xv. 7, and referred to in Neh. ix. 7. It was surely both natural and allowable to express this first command in the well-known words of the second.<br><br><b> Charran</b>] So the LXX for Haran, Gen. xi. 31, &c.; 4 Kings xix. 12; Ezek. xxvii. 23. It is in Mesopotamia, and is celebrated in Roman history as Carrhæ, where happened the defeat and slaughter of Crassus by the Parthians. It lay on an ancient road, in a large plain surrounded by mountains; it was still a great city in the days of the Arabian caliphs.<b> 4. when his father was dead</b>] In Gen. xi. 26, we read that Terah lived 70 years and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; in xi. 32, that Terah lived 205 years, and died in Haran; and in xii. 4, that Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran. Since then 70 added to 75 makes 145, Terah must have lived about 60 years in Haran after Abram’s departure.—It seems evident, that the Jewish chronology, which Stephen follows, was at fault here, owing to the circumstance of Terah’s death<i> being mentioned</i> Gen. xi. 32,<i> before</i> the command to Abram to leave Haran;—it not having been observed that the mention is<i> anticipatory</i>. And this is confirmed by Philo having fallen into the same mistake, and stated the removal of Abraham from Haran, in almost these same words, to have been<i> after his father’s death.</i> It is observable that the Samaritan Pentateuch, in Gen. xi. 32, for 205, reads 145, which has most probably been an alteration to remove the apparent inconsistency.—The subterfuge of understanding the<i> spiritual death</i> of Terah, who is, as a further hypothesis, supposed to have<i> relapsed into idolatry</i> at Haran, appears to have originated with the Rabbis, on discovering that their tradition was at variance with the sacred chronology. They have not been without followers in modern Christendom. See in my Greek Testament instances of unworthy treatment of the assertion in the text in order to evade the difficulty. The way in which it has been met by some commentators, viz. that we have no right to assume that Abram was born when Terah was 70, but may regard him as the<i> youngest</i> son, would leave us in this equally unsatisfactory position:—Terah,<i> in the course of nature</i>, begets his son Abram at 130 (205 minus 75): yet this very son Abram regards it as incredible that he himself should beget a son at 99 (Gen. xvii. 1, 17); and on the fact of the birth of Isaac being<i> out of the course of nature</i>, most important Scriptural arguments and consequences are founded; cf. iv. 17–21; Heb. xi. 11, 12. We may fairly leave these commentators with their new difficulty: only remarking for our instruction, how sure those are to plunge into hopeless confusion, who, from motives however good, once begin to handle the word of God deceitfully.<br><br><b> God removed him</b>] In these words Stephen clearly recognizes the<i> second command</i>, to migrate from Haran to Canaan; and as clearly therefore made no<i> mistake</i> in ver. 2, but applied the expressed words of the second command to the first injunction.<b> 5. gave him none inheritance in it</b>] There is no occasion here to wrest our text in order to produce accordance with the history. The field which Abraham bought for the burial of his dead surely did not come under the description of<i> an inheritance</i>, nor give him any standing as a possessor in the land.
