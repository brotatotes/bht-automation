<b> 22.</b>] The word “<i>learned</i>,” in our A.V. here, is used in its older meaning of “<i>taught</i>,” as in the Prayer-book version of the Ps. cxix. 66, “Learn me true understanding and knowledge.” This meaning having now become obsolete, the word here is misunderstood to mean<i> learnéd</i>, i.e.<i> erudite, accomplished</i>. It should therefore be altered into “<b>instructed</b>.” That Moses was instructed in the wisdom of the Egyptians, is not found in the Old Testament, but derived from tradition, and following as a matter of course from his adopted station as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. This<i> wisdom of the Egyptians</i>, celebrated by so many ancient writers, consisted mainly in natural philosophy, medicine, and mathematics,—and its teachers were the priests.<br><br><b> mighty in words</b>] So Josephus calls Moses<i> admirably persuasive in haranguing multitudes</i>, but late in his course, during the journey through the wilderness:—when the divine Spirit, as the book of Deuteronomy abundantly testifies, had turned his ‘slowness of speech’ into the most fervid eloquence. That he was so thus early, during his Egyptian course, was probably reported by tradition, but hardly seems to agree with Exod. iv. 10–16.
