<p><strong> 22</strong> .] That Moses was instructed in the wisdom of the Egyptians, is not found in the O. T., but derived from tradition, and following as a matter of course from his adopted station as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. This <em> wisdom of the Egyptians</em> , celebrated by so many ancient writers (see Wetst. ad loc), consisted mainly in natural philosophy, medicine, and mathematics, and its teachers were the priests. Philo de vita Mos. § 5, p. 84, enters into minute detail: ἀριθμοὺς μὲν οὖν κ . γεωμετρίαν , κ . τήν τε ῥυθμικὴν κ . ἁρμονικὴν κ . μετρικὴν θεωρίαν , κ . μουσικὴν τὴν σύμπασαν , διά τε χρήσεως ὀργάνων , κ . λόγων τῶν ἐν ταῖς τέχναις , κ . διεξόδοις τοπικωτέραις , Αἰγυπτίων οἱ λόγιοι παρέδοσαν . κ . προσέτι τὴν διὰ συμβόλων φιλοσοφίαν , ἣν ἐν τοῖς λεγομένοις ἱεροῖς γράμμασιν ἐπιδείκνυνται , κ . διὰ τῆς τῶν ζώων ἀποδοχῆς , ἃ καὶ θεῶν τιμαῖς γεραίρουσι . τὴν δὲ ἄλλην ἐγκύκλιον παιδείαν Ἕλληνες ἐδίδασκον · οἱ δ ʼ ἐκ τῶν πλησιοχώρων , τά τε Ἀσσυρίων γράμματα , κ . τὴν τῶν οὐρανίων Χαλδαϊκὴν ἐπιστήμην .

<p><strong> δυνατὸς ἐν λόγοις</strong> ] So Josephus calls Moses πλήθεσιν ὁμιλεῖν πιθανώτατος , but <em> late in his course</em> , during the journey through the wilderness; when the divine Spirit, as the book of Deuteronomy abundantly testifies, had turned his ‘slowness of speech’ into the most fervid eloquence. That he was so thus early, during his Egyptian course, was probably reported by tradition, but hardly seems to agree with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:10-16">Exodus 4:10-16</span> .</p>
