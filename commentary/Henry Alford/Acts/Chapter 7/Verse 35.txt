<b> 35.</b>] The words,<b> this Moses,</b> are repeated emphatically again and again, to impress on them God’s choice of one whom they rejected.<br><br><b> whom they refused,</b> ver 27. The rejecter of Moses there is regarded as the<i> representative of the nation:</i> see note on ver. 26. In this express mention of the rejection of Moses by the Jews, and his election and mission by God, the parallel of Jesus Christ is no doubt in Stephen’s mind, and the inference intended to be drawn, that<i> it does not follow that GOD REJECTS those whom</i> THEY REJECTED.—The difficulty of<b> hath God sent:</b> has caused it to be altered into the historic tense,<i> “did God send.”</i> But the perfect tense sets forth not only the fact of God’s sending Moses<i> then,</i> but the endurance of his mission till<b>—him hath God sent:</b> with a closer reference than before, to Him whom God had now exalted as the true<i> Ruler and Deliverer,</i> see ch. y. 31.
