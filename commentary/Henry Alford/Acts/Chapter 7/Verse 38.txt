 38. ] γίνομαι μετά is not a Hebraism, as Kuin.: see reff.
	That Moses conversed with both the Angel of the covenant and our fathers, implies that he was the  mediator between them , as indeed ὃς ἐδέξατ . λόγ . ζ . more plainly declares.
	 ἐκκλησίᾳ probably, the assembly held (Exodus 19:0 ) for the promulgation of the law at Mt. Sinai, not ‘  the Church ’ generally: but the article does not determine this: it would be expressed, whichever meaning we take. Wordsw. observes on the meaning which the words ἡ ἐκκλησία ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ carry for the student of Christian prophecy, Revelation 12:1-6 .
	 λόγια ζῶντα ] living, see reff., not = ζωοποιοῦντα (Grot., Kuin.), ‘  life-giving :’ still less to be understood ‘given  vivá voce ’ (Pisc. Alberti). So Soph. Gild [47] Tyr. 482, τὰ μεσόμφαλα γᾶς ἀπονοσφίζων | μαντεῖα · τὰ δ ʼ αἰεὶ | ζῶντα περιποτᾶται .
