<b> 42. God turned</b>] i.e. God, who had hitherto watched over them for good,<i> now provoked by their rebellion, changed,</i> and delivered them up to their own ways.<br><br> gave<b> them</b> up—not<i> ‘suffered them:’</i> all these explainings away of the strong expressions of Scripture belong to the rationalistic school of interpreters (which is not modern merely; even Chrysostom has here<i> “He permitted them”):</i> it was a<i> judicial delivering up,</i> not a mere letting alone, see Rom. i. 24, 26, 28.<br><br><b> to worship the host of heaven</b>] This fact is not mentioned in the Pentateuch, but may refer to the worship of Baal. In after-times we have frequent traces of star worship: see 2 Kings xvii. 16; xxi. 3, 5; xxiii. 4, 5; Jer. xix. 13; Zeph. i. 5. See also Deut. iv. 19; xvii. 3; Job xxxi. 26.<br><br><b> The book of the prophets</b>, regarded as a whole, contained this prophecy. The citation is from the LXX. I should take the question here as a<br><br> reproach, implying that God does not receive as offered to Him, sacrifices in which He has been made to share with idols:—<b>it is not true that ye offered to Me</b> (but no stress on Me)<b> sacrifices,</b>&c., ‘I regard it as never having happened.’
