 42.   ἔστρεψεν ] neuter,  changed, turned , as ἀναστρέψω , ch. Acts 15:16 . No word, as ἑαυτόν , or τὴν γνώμην , or τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ , need be supplied: nor must ἔστρ . κ . παρ . be rendered ‘  again delivered them ’ (Vitring., De Dieu, al.), a Hebraism which has no place in the N. T. (Mey.): nor must we understand αὐτούς (as C in var. readd.), God turned  them ; for, though philologically there is no objection to this, the sense requires that ἔστρεψεν should form an introduction to παρέδωκεν God, who had hitherto watched over them for good,  now provoked by their rebellion, turned , and delivered them up to their own ways.
	 παρέδωκεν not ‘  suffered them to fall into :’ all these explainings away of the strong expressions of Scripture belong to the rationalistic school of interpreters (which is not modern merely: even Chrysostom has here εἴασε ): it was a  judicial delivering up , not a mere letting alone, see reff.
	 τῇ στρ  .   τ  .   οὐρ .] This fact is not mentioned in the Pentateuch, but may refer to the worship of Baal. In aftertimes we have frequent traces of star-worship: see 2 Kings 17:16 ; 2Ki 21:3 ; 2 Kings 21:5 ; 2 Kings 23:4-5 ; Jeremiah 19:13 ; Zephaniah 1:5 . See also Deuteronomy 4:19 ; Deuteronomy 17:3 ; Job 31:26 .
	 βίβλ  .   τ  .   προφ .] The book of the prophets, regarded as a whole. The citation (ref.) is from the LXX.
	 μὴ σφάγ  .   κ  .   θ .] A question usually preceding a  negative answer, see Matthew 7:9 ; Romans 11:1 ; 1Co 9:8 al.: but not always: see Matthew 12:23 ( Act 26:22 ); John 4:29 ; John 8:22 . Winer, edn. 6, § 57. 3, b. There is no stress on μοί (‘Is it to  Me that ye offered, &c. (i.e. to me only?’) as Rosenm., Heinr., Olsh., Kuin., Stier: the position of μοί in the sentence will not allow of this). I should take the question here according to the usual construction, and understand it as a reproach, implying that God does not receive as offered to Him, sacrifices in which He has been made to share with idols:  it is not true that ye offered to Me (but no stress on Me)  sacrifices , &c. ‘I regard it as never having happened.’
