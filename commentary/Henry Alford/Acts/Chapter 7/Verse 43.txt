<b> 43.</b>] The answer by God himself:<b> Yea, ye took up,</b> j.e.<b> carried about with you,</b> (not<i> My</i> tabernacle as your sole or chief holy place, but)<b> the tabernacle</b> (literally the portable tent for the. image. We read of the<i> sacred tent</i> in the Carthaginian camp)<b> of Moloch</b>&c. Stephen was<i> not the sole</i> dishonourer, if a<i> dishonourer,</i> of the holy place—their fathers had done it before.<br><br><b> Moloch</b>] So the LXX: the Heb. has<b> Malchem,</b><i> ‘of your king’</i> Moloch was the Phœnician Saturn: his image was of brass with the head of an ox, and outstretched arms of a man, hollow; and human sacrifices (of children) were offered, by laying them in these arms and heating the image by fire kindled within. The rigid prohibitions of the worship of Moloch (Lev. xviii. 21; xx. 2–5) were openly transgressed by Ahaz, 2 Kings xvi. 3; by Manasseh, ib. xxi. 6; see also xxiii. 10; Jer. vii. 31; xxxii. 35. In the kingdom of Israel this abomination had been long practised, see 2 Kings xvii. 17; Ezek. xxiii. 37. We find traces of it at Carthage among the Phœnicians, among the Cretans and Rhodians, and the Assyrian colonists at Sepharvaim, 2 Kings xvii. 31.<br><br><b> the star of your god Remphan</b>] For this word, Rephan or Remphan the Hebrew has<i> “Chiun:”</i> but what the meaning of either this or Remphan (the word is very variously read in our MSS. Rempham, Rompha, Rofa. Reffa, Rephan, &c.) is, we have nothing but conjecture to inform us. The most likely opinion has been that of Kircher, who maintains it to be a Coptic word, signifying<i> the planet Saturn,</i> and answering to the Arabic ‘Kewan.’ The prophecy, both in the LXX and Hebrew, has<b> Damascus.</b> But the<i> fulfilment</i> of the prophecy would make it very natural to substitute that name which had become inseparably associated with the captivity.
