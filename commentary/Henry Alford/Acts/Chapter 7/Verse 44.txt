 44.   ἡ σκ  .   τ  .   μαρτ  . ] In opposition to the σκ . just mentioned: but also in pursuance of one of the great aims of the speech,  to shew that holiness is not confined to locality or building . This part of his subject Stephen now enters on more particularly. The words ἡ σκ . τ . μαρτ . are the LXX rendering of אֹהֶל מוֹעֵד ( Num 16:18-19 al.) ‘the tabernacle of the assembly’ (or ‘congregation,’ E. V.). They apparently derived the latter word from עוּד , ‘testatus est,’ instead of יָעַד , ‘constituit.’
	 τύπον ] (ref.): another contrast, cf. τύπους οὓς ἐποιήσατε , Acts 7:43 .
