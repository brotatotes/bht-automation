<p><strong> 44. </strong> <strong> ἡ σκ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> μαρτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] In opposition to the σκ . just mentioned: but also in pursuance of one of the great aims of the speech, <em> to shew that holiness is not confined to locality or building</em> . This part of his subject Stephen now enters on more particularly. The words ἡ σκ . τ . μαρτ . are the LXX rendering of אֹהֶל מוֹעֵד ( Num 16:18-19 al.) ‘the tabernacle of the assembly’ (or ‘congregation,’ E. V.). They apparently derived the latter word from עוּד , ‘testatus est,’ instead of יָעַד , ‘constituit.’
