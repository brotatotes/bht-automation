<b> 44. the tabernacle of witness</b>] In opposition to the<i> tabernacle</i> just mentioned: but also in pursuance of one of the great aims of the speech,<i> to shew that holiness is not confined to locality or building.</i> This part of his subject Stephen now enters on more particularly.—The words,<i> “the tabernacle of witness,”</i> are the LXX rendering of the word in Num. xvi. 18, 19&c., which the A.V. renders ‘the tabernacle of the assembly,’ or ‘congregation.’
