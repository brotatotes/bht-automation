	 ἐν τῇ κατασχέσει ]  at (or ‘in’)  their taking possession . The Vulg. rendering, ‘in possessionem gentium,’ is philologically inadmissible; ‘in terram a gentibus occupatam’ (Calvin, De Dieu, Grot., Kuin.) is still worse. The passage of the LXX, Numbers 32:5 , δοθήτω ἡ γῆ αὕτη τοῖς οἰκέταις σου ἐν κατασχέσει , brought forward to justify these renderings, is directly against them. The word is one of those examples of verbal nouns in - σις where the meaning hovers uncertainly between the act of doing and the thing done. Such is often the case with καύχησις in St. Paul. Cf. for a very near approach to the concrete meaning of this word, Numbers 27:4 ; Numbers 27:7 . But, abstract or concrete, it always, as might be expected from the very composition of the word, is used of that final and settled possession which Israel took of the land, not of that transitory possession from which the gentes were driven out. So that Wordsw.’s rendering, “the portion, or possession of the Gentiles,” is out of the question.
