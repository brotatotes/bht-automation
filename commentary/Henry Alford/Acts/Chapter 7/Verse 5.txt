<p><strong> 5. </strong> <strong> οὐκ ἔδωκεν</strong> ] There is no occasion here to wrest our text in order to produce accordance with the history. The field which Abraham bought for the burial of his dead surely did not come under the description of κληρονομία , nor give him any standing as a possessor in the land. To avoid this seeming inconsistency, Schöttgen and Bengel lay a stress on ἔδωκεν , ‘agrum illum … non ex donatione divina accepit Abraham, sed emit, ipsa emtione peregrinum eum esse docente’ (Bengel). Kuinoel and Olshausen take οὐκ for οὔπω .

<p><strong> καί</strong> before ἐπηγγ . is not ‘ <em> yet</em> ’ (Beza), nor is ἐπηγγ . to be construed <em> pluperfect</em> (id.); <strong> and he promised</strong> is the simple rendering of the words, and the right one. The following καί is by Kuin. rendered ‘ <em> nimirum</em> :’ but again it is only the simple copula, וּלְזַרְעֲךָ .</p>
