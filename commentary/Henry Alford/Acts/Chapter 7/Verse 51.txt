At each separate recital (vv. 9, 25, 35, 39 ff.) he has dwelt, with continually increasing fervour, on the<i> rebellions against and rejections of God by His people.</i> He has now brought down the history to the establishment of the temple worship. From Solomon’s time to his own, he saw but a succession of apostasies, idolatries, rejection of God’s a dark and loathsome catalogue, terminated by the betrayal and murder of the Just One Himself. It is not at all beyond probability, to believe that the zeal of his fervent spirit was, by the view of this, the filling up of the measure of their iniquities, kindled into a flame of inspired invective. I find that this is also Neander’s view, in opposition to the generality of Commentators, as also that of Prof. Hackett, in his commentary on the Acts: and I cannot but think it far the most probable. “Henceforward he is borne along by vehemence in his discourse. His approaching death gave him great boldness of speech: for of this I believe him to have been fully aware.” Chrysostom.<br><br><b> stiffnecked and uncircumcised</b>] Words and figures familiar to the prophets in speaking of the rebellious Israel: see besides the references, Deut. ix. 6, 13; Neh. ix. 16:—Dent. x. 16; xxx. 6.

Which of the prophets</b>] See Matt. xxiii. 34 ff.: 2 Chron. xxxvi. 16: where the same general expressions are used of their persecuting the prophets. Such sayings are not to be pressed to the letter, but represent the uniform attitude of disobedience and hostility which they assumed to the messengers of God.
