 51 .] I do not think there is any occasion to suppose an  interruption from the audience to have occasioned this outbreak of holy indignation. At each separate recital (Acts 7:9 ; Acts 7:25 ; Acts 7:35 ; Acts 7:39 ff.) he has dwelt, with continually increasing fervour, on the  rebellions against and rejections of God by His people . He has now brought down the history to the establishment of the temple worship. From Solomon’s time to his own, he saw but a succession of apostasies, idolatries, rejection of God’s prophets: a dark and loathsome catalogue, terminated by the betrayal and murder of the Just One Himself. It is not at all beyond probability, to believe that the zeal of his fervent spirit was by the view of this, the filling up of the measure of their iniquities, kindled into a flame of inspired invective. I find that this is also Neander’s view, in opposition to the generality of Commentators (P. u. L., p.92), as also that of Prof. Hackett, in his commentary on the Acts: and I cannot but think it far the most probable. ἐνταῦθα λοιπὸν καταφορικῶς τῷ λόγῳ κέχρηται . πολλὴ ἦν παῤῥησία μέλλοντος αὐτοῦ ἀποθνήσκειν · καὶ γὰρ καὶ τοῦτο οἶμαι αὐτὸν εἰδέναι , Chrysost.

	 ὠσίν ] I should hardly think of any allusion to Psalms 40:0 (39) 6, because the LXX have rendered ‘mine ears hast thou opened’ by σῶμα κατηρτίσω μοι .
	 τῷ πν  .   τ  .   ἁγ  .   ἀντ .] Apparently a reference to Isaiah 63:10 . The instances as yet had been confined to οἱ πατ . ὑμ .: now he has arrived at their own times. The  two are taken up again in the next verse.
