<p><strong> 51</strong> .] I do not think there is any occasion to suppose an <em> interruption from the audience</em> to have occasioned this outbreak of holy indignation. At each separate recital (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:9">Acts 7:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:25">Acts 7:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:35">Acts 7:35</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:39">Acts 7:39</span> ff.) he has dwelt, with continually increasing fervour, on the <em> rebellions against and rejections of God by His people</em> . He has now brought down the history to the establishment of the temple worship. From Solomon’s time to his own, he saw but a succession of apostasies, idolatries, rejection of God’s prophets: a dark and loathsome catalogue, terminated by the betrayal and murder of the Just One Himself. It is not at all beyond probability, to believe that the zeal of his fervent spirit was by the view of this, the filling up of the measure of their iniquities, kindled into a flame of inspired invective. I find that this is also Neander’s view, in opposition to the generality of Commentators (P. u. L., p.92), as also that of Prof. Hackett, in his commentary on the Acts: and I cannot but think it far the most probable. ἐνταῦθα λοιπὸν καταφορικῶς τῷ λόγῳ κέχρηται . πολλὴ ἦν παῤῥησία μέλλοντος αὐτοῦ ἀποθνήσκειν · καὶ γὰρ καὶ τοῦτο οἶμαι αὐτὸν εἰδέναι , Chrysost.
