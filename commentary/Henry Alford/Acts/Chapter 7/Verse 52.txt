 52.   τίνα τ  .   προφ  . ] See Mat 23:31 ff.: 2 Chronicles 36:16 ; where the same general expressions are used of their persecuting the prophets. Such sayings are not to be pressed to the letter, but represent the uniform attitude of disobedience and hostility which they assumed to the messengers of God. See also the parable, Matthew 21:35 .
	 τοὺς προκ .]  The office of all the prophets , see ch. Acts 3:18 . The assertion is repeated, to connect them, by this title, with Him, whom they announced.
	 τοῦ δικαίου ] Schöttg. vol. ii. p. 18, has shewn from the Rabbinical writings that this name was used by the Jews to designate the Messiah. See reff. and note on James 5:6 .
	 προδόται ] By Judas’s treachery, of which the Sanhedrists had been the accomplices; Matthew 26:14-16 :  φονεῖς , by the hands of the Romans; ch. Acts 2:23 , note.
	 ἐγένεσθε is preferable not only on account of its manuscript authority, but as being the  historical tense , like the rest. It was probably altered to the perfect, as suiting the  time then present , better than the aorist.
