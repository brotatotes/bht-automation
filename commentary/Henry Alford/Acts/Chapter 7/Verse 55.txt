<b> 55.</b>] Certainly, in so far as the vision of Stephen was<i> supernatural,</i> it was not<i> necessary</i> that the<i> material heavens should have been visible</i> to him: but from the words<i> looked up steadfastly</i><b> into [the] heaven,</b> it would seem that they<i> were.</i> We are not told<i> where</i> the Sanhedrim were assembled. It does not seem as if they were convened in the ordinary session room: it may have been in one of the courts of the temple, which would give room for more than the members of the Sanhedrin to be present, as seems to have been the case.<br><br><b> standing</b>] A reason why the glorified Saviour was seen<i> standing</i> and not<i> sitting,</i> has been pleasingly given by Chrysostom, “Why<i> standing</i> and not<i> sitting?</i> that He may shew His attitude of help to the martyr. For of the Father also it is said, ‘Arise, O God.’” See also the collect for St. Stephen’s day. But not perhaps correctly: for ‘help’ does not seem here to he the applicable idea, but the<i> confirmation of his faith</i> by the ecstatic vision of the Saviour’s glory at God’s right hand.—I should be rather disposed to think that there was reference in the vision to that in Zech. iii. 1, where Zechariah sees “<i>Joshua</i> [<i>Jesus</i>]<i> the High Priest standing before the angel of the Lord.</i>” Stephen, under accusation of blaspheming the<i> earthly temple,</i> is granted a sight of the<i> heavenly temple</i>; being cited before the<i> Sadducee High Priest,</i> who believed neither angel nor spirit, he is vouchsafed a vision of the<i> heavenly</i> HIGH PRIEST, standing and ministering at the Throne, amidst the angels and just men made perfect.
