<b> 58. cast him out of the city</b>] See Levit. xxiv. 14. The Rabbinical books say, “The place of stoning was outside the city: for all walled cities were considered to correspond to the camp of Israel.” Compare also Heb. xiii. 12, 13.<br><br><b> and stoned him</b>] An anticipation of the fact, the details of which follow. Stoning was the punishment of blaspheming, Levit. xxiv. 16. The question whether this was a legal proceeding on sentence, or a tumultuary one, is not easy to answer. It would appear from John xviii. 31, that the Jews had not legally the power of putting any man to death (see note there). Certainly, from the narrative before us, and from the fact of a bloody persecution having taken place soon after it, it seems that the Jews did, by connivance of, or in the absence of the Procurator, administer summary punishments of this kind. But here no sentence is recorded: and perhaps the very violence and fanatical character of the execution might constitute it, not an encroachment on the power of the Procurator, as it would have been if strictly in form of law, but a mere outbreak, and as such it might be allowed to pass unnoticed. That they observed the forms of<i> their own law</i>, in the place and manner of the stoning, is no objection to this view.<br><br><b> the witnesses</b>] See Deut. xvii. 7, where it is enacted that the hands of the witnesses were to be first on the criminal to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people.<br><br><b> they laid down their clothes</b>] They disencumbered themselves of their loose outer garments, that they might be light and unimpeded in the throwing of the stones. They laid them at Saul’s feet that he might keep them in safety. Such notices are deeply interesting, when we recollect by<i> whom</i> they were in all probability carefully inserted. See ch. xxii. 19, 20, and note on ch. xxvi. 10:—from which it appears that Saul can certainly not have been less than<i> thirty</i> at this time. He was a member of the Sanhedrim, and soon after was despatched on an important mission with their authority.
