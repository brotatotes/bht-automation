 60. ] The more accurate philological Commentators, De Wette and Meyer, deny that στήσῃς here can, as ordinarily explained, refer to  weighing (reff. Matt.; Jeremiah 39:0 (32) 10), since not the  sin , but the  punishment , would be the thing weighed out, and it would be harsh to take the one for the other, in a sentence of this kind. Meyer would understand ἱστάναι as opposed to ἀφιέναι , τὴν ἁμαρτίαν , ‘  Fix not this sin upon them :’ but De Wette, as seems to me more probably, renders it  Reckon not this sin to them (‘lay not this sin to their charge,’ E. V.), supporting this by Romans 10:3 .
	This again was somewhat similar (though not exactly, see note there) to our Lord’s prayer, Luke 23:34 .
	 ἐκοιμήθη ] Not a Christian expression only: Wetstein, on Matthew 27:52 , cites Jewish examples: and we have in the Anthology, iii. 1. 10, τῇδε Σάων ὁ Δίωνος Ἀκάνθιος ἱερὸν ὕπνον | κοιμᾶται · θνήσκειν μὴ λέγε τοὺς ἀγαθούς . But it became  the usual Christian  term for death. Its use here, when the circumstances, and the actors in them, are remembered, is singularly touching, from the contrast.
