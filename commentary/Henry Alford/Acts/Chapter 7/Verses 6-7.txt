<p><strong> 6, 7.</strong> ] A free citation from the LXX, with the words καὶ λατρ . μοι ἐν τ . τόπ . τούτῳ adapted and added from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+3:12">Exodus 3:12</span> . The shifts of some Commentators to avoid this plain fact are not worth recounting: but again, the student who would not handle the word of God deceitfully should be here and every where on his guard against them.

<p>The round number, 400 years, given here and Gen. l.c, is <em> further specified</em> Exo 12:40 as 430. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17">Galatians 3:17</span> , and note.)</p>
