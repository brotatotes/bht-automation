<b> 10. the great power of God</b>] Literally, according to the best MS. authorities, the power of God<b> which is called great.</b> Neander and Meyer think that they must have referred to the<b> Word</b>, the creating and governing manifestation of God, so much spoken of in the Alexandrine philosophy, and must have regarded Simon as an incarnation of the<i> Word</i>; so that their erroneous belief would form some preparation for the great truth of an incarnate Messiah, preached by Philip. But to this De Wette well replies, that we can hardly suppose the Alexandrine philosophy to have been so familiar to the mass of the people; and refers the expression to their popular belief of a<i> great angel</i>, who might, as the angels were called by the Samaritans the<i> powers of God</i>, be designated by these remarkable words.
