 10.   ἡ δύν  .   τ  .   θ  .   ἡ καλουμένη μεγάλη ] Neander (l. c.) and Meyer think that they must have referred to the λόγος , the creating and governing manifestation of God so much spoken of in the Alexandrine philosophy (see extracts from Philo in note on John 1:1 . The term, but by no means with the same idea, was adopted by the Spirit, speaking by John, as belonging to the Son of God: see the same note, end), and must have regarded Simon as an incarnation of the λόγος (the μητρόπολις πασῶν τῶν δυνάμεων τοῦ θεοῦ , Philo), so that their erroneous belief would form some preparation for the great truth of an incarnate Messiah, preached by Philip. But to this De W. well replies, that we can hardly suppose the Alexandrine philosophy to have been so familiar to the mass of the people, and refers the expression to their popular belief of a  great angel (Chron. Sam. 10), who might, as the angels were called by the Samaritans  the powers of God (for which he refers to Reland, de Samar. § 7. Gesen. Theol. Samar. p. 21 ff.), be designated as ἡ δύν . τ . θ . ἡ καλουμένη μεγάλη .
	 καλουμένη rests on such strong manuscript authority, and is so unlikely to have been inserted (the idea of a scholium to indicate the force of the art. (Bloomf.) is quite out of the question, no such scholium being here needed), that both on external and internal grounds it must form part of the text. The lit. rendering will be,  This man is the power of God which is called great: the sense, ‘This man is that power of God (see above) which we know as  the great one .’
	λεγομένη , found in a few later mss., is an explanation of καλ . by a more usual word.
