<b> 14. Peter and John</b>] Perhaps<i> two</i>, in accordance with their having been sent out two and two on their first missionary journey (Mark vi. 7): so Paul and Barnabas afterwards (ch. xiii. 2): and the same principle seems to have been adhered to even when these last separated: Paul chose Silas, Barnabas took Mark.—PETER,—because to him belonged, in this early part of the gospel, in a remarkable manner, the first establishing of the church; it was the fulfilment of the promise<i> “upon this rock I will build my church.”</i> It was he who had (in common with all the Apostles, it is true, but in this early period more especially committed to him) the keys of the kingdom of heaven,—who opened the door to the 3000 on the day of Pentecost,—now (as a formal and ratifying act) to the Samaritans,—and in ch. x. to the Gentiles. So far, is plain truth of Scripture history. The monstrous fiction begins, when to Peter is attributed a fixed diocese and successors, and to those successors a delegated power more like that ascribed to Simon Magus than that promised to Peter.——This is the last time that JOHN appears in the Acts. He is only once more mentioned in the New Testament (except in the Revelation), viz. as having been present in Jerusalem at Paul’s visit, Gal. ii. 9.
