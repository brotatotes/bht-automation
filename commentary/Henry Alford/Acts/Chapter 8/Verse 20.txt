<b> 20.</b>] The solemn denunciation of Peter, like the declaration of Paul, 1 Cor. vi. 13, has reference to the perishableness of all worldly good, and of those with it, whose chief end is the use of it (see Col. ii. 22). ‘Thy gold and thou are equally on the way to corruption:’<i> thy gold</i>, as its nature is:<i> thou with it</i>, as having no higher life than thy natural corrupt one: as being bound in the<i> bond of iniquity</i>. The<i> expression of the same Peter</i>, 1 Pet. i. 7,<i> “gold that perisheth,”</i> is remarkably parallel with this (see too 1 Pet. i. 18).
