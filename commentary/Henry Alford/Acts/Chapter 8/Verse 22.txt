<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] <strong> εἰ ἄρα</strong> <strong> , if perhaps</strong> (not ‘ <em> ut sane</em> ,’ which it will not bear: see on its meaning, “ <em> if, which none can say</em> ,” Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 440): and the uncertainty refers, not to the doubt whether Simon would repent or not (see below on γάρ ): but as to whether or not his sin may not have come under the awful category of those unpardonable ones specified by our Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:31">Matthew 12:31</span> , to which words the form ἀφεθήσεται seems to have a tacit reference. Peter does not <em> pronounce</em> his sin <em> to have been such</em> , but throws in this doubt, to increase the motive to repent, and the earnestness of his repentance. This verse is important, taken in connexion with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:23">John 20:23</span> , as shewing <em> how completely the Apostles themselves referred the forgiveness of sins to, and left it in, the sovereign power of God, and not to their own delegated power of absolution</em> .</p>
