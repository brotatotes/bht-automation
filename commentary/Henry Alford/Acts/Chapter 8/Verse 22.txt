 22. ]  εἰ ἄρα  , if perhaps (not ‘  ut sane ,’ which it will not bear: see on its meaning, “  if, which none can say ,” Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 440): and the uncertainty refers, not to the doubt whether Simon would repent or not (see below on γάρ ): but as to whether or not his sin may not have come under the awful category of those unpardonable ones specified by our Lord, Matthew 12:31 , to which words the form ἀφεθήσεται seems to have a tacit reference. Peter does not  pronounce his sin  to have been such , but throws in this doubt, to increase the motive to repent, and the earnestness of his repentance. This verse is important, taken in connexion with John 20:23 , as shewing  how completely the Apostles themselves referred the forgiveness of sins to, and left it in, the sovereign power of God, and not to their own delegated power of absolution .
