<b> 22. if perhaps</b>] The uncertainty refers, not to the doubt whether Simon would repent or not (see below): but as to whether or not his sin may not have come under the awful category of those unpardonable ones specified by our Lord, Matt. xii. 31, to which words this sentence seems to have a tacit reference. Peter does not<i> pronounce</i> his sin<i> to have been such</i>, but throws in this doubt, to increase the motive to repent, and the earnestness of his repentance. This verse is important, taken in connexion with John xx. 23, as shewing<i> how completely the Apostles themselves referred the forgiveness of sins to, and left it in, the sovereign power of God, and not to their own delegated power of absolution.</i>
