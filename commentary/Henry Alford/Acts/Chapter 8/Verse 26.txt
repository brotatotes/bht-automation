<b> 26.</b>] An angel,<i> visibly appearing:</i> not in a dream,—which is not, as some suppose, implied by the command to<i> arise</i>. The ministration of angels introduces and brings about several occurrences in the beginning of the church, see ch. v. 19; x. 3; xii. 7 (xxvii. 23). The appearance seems to have taken place in Samaria, after the departure of Peter and John. He would reach the place appointed by a shorter way than through Jerusalem: he would probably follow the high road (of the itineraries, see map in Conybeare and Howson’s St. Paul) as far as Gophna, and thence strike across the country south-westward to join, at some point to which he would be guided, the road leading from Jerusalem to Gaza.<br><br><b> GAZA</b>] The southernmost city of Canaan (Gen. x. 19), in the portion of Judah (Josh. xv. 47), but soon taken from that tribe by the Philistines, and always spoken of as a Philistian city (1 Sam. vi. 17; 2 Kings xviii. 8; Amos i. 6–8; Zeph. iii. 4; Zech. ix. 5). In Jer. xlvii. 1, we have ‘before Pharaoh (Necho?) smote Gaza,’—implying that at one time it was under Egypt. Alexander the Great took it after a siege of five months, but did not destroy it, for we find it a strong place in the subsequent Syrian wars, see 1 Macc. ix. 52; xi. 61 f.; xiii. 43; xiv. 7; xv. 28; xvi. 1.—It was destroyed by the Jewish king Alexander Jannæns (96 A.C.), after a siege of a year, but rebuilt again by the Roman general Gabinius,—afterwards given by Augustus to Herod, and finally after his death attached to the province of Syria, Mela, in the time of Claudius, calls it ‘a vast city, and strongly fortified,’ with which agree Eusebius and Jerome. At present it is a large town by the same name, with from 15, 000 to 16, 000 inhabitants. The above chronological notices shew that it cannot have been<i> “desert”</i> at this time: see below.<br><br><b> this is desert</b>] The words, I believe, of the<i> angel</i>, not of St. Luke. There appear to have been two (if not more) ways from Jerusalem to Gaza. But Robinson found, besides, an ancient road leading<i> direct</i> from Jerusalem to Gaza, through the<i> Wadi Musurr</i>, and over the Beit Jiibrin, which certainly<i> at present</i> is<i> “desert,”</i> without towns or villages. Thus the words will refer to the<i> way:</i> and denote,<b> the way of which I speak to thee is desert</b>. See in my Greek Test. further proofs of the inapplicability of the epithet<i> “desert”</i> to Gaza.
