 33.   ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ ἡ κρίσις αὐτ  .   ἤρθη ] Heb. ‘He was taken away by distress and judgment’ [so in the margin of E. V.]: i.e. as Lowth, ‘by an oppressive judgment.’
	 γενεὰν αὐτοῦ ] i.e.,  the age in which He shall live ‘the wickedness of his contemporaries.’ The fathers, and Bede [55] (and so Wordsworth), explain ‘  His generation ’ of His eternal Sonship and His miraculous Incarnation. But the Heb. does not seem to bear this out. See the meaning discussed at length, and another interpretation defended in Stier, Jesaias, &c., pp. 466 470. Cf. also Gesenius’ Thesaurus under דּוֹר .
	 [55] Bede,  the Venerable , 731; Bedegr, a Greek MS. cited by Bede, nearly identical with Cod. “E,” mentioned in this edn only when it differs from E.
