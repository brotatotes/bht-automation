<b> 38.</b><b> he</b> (viz. the eunuch)<b> commanded</b>] Some of our MSS., whose text apparently Jerome followed, read here, ‘<i>the Spirit fell on the eunuch, and an angel of the Lord caught away Philip</i>.” This is curious, and has probably arisen from a desire to conform the results of the eunuch’s baptism to the usual method of the divine procedure, and the snatching away of Philip to his commission, ver. 26. But the Spirit did not fall on the Samaritans after baptism by Philip.—The text clearly relates a supernatural disappearance of Philip: compare 2 Kings ii. 16; no interpretation of his being suddenly hurried away by the prompting of the Spirit, will satisfy the analogy of the above-cited passage, and of (see below) a parallel one in St. Luke’s own Gospel.
