 39.   πν  .   κυρ  .   ἥρπ  .   τ  .   Φ  . ] The reading, ‘  the Spirit fell on the Eunuch, and an angel of the Lord caught away Philip ,’ is curious, and has probably arisen from a desire to conform the results of the eunuch’s baptism to the usual method of the divine procedure, and the snatching away of Philip to his commission, Acts 8:26 . But the Spirit did not fall on the Samaritans after baptism by Philip.
	The text clearly relates a supernatural disappearance of Philip: compare μήποτε ᾖρεν αὐτὸν πνεῦμα κυρίου , 4 Kings Acts 2:16 ; no interpretation (as Eichhorn, Kuin., Olsh., Meyer) of his being suddenly hurried away by the prompting of the Spirit, will satisfy the analogy of the above-cited passage, and of (see below) a parallel one in Luke’s own Gospel. The ἁρπάζειν of ref. John, which Meyer cites to justify his view, tells in my mind the other way; the fear was lest the multitude should come and  carry Him off to make Him a King: and in the reff. I have therefore marked the two as bearing the same meaning.
	 οὐκ εἶδεν αὐτὸν οὐκέτι ] Not ‘never saw him from that day,’ though (see below) that meaning may be indirectly included: but as Luke 24:31 , αὐτὸς ἄφαντος ἐγένετο ἀπ ʼ αὐτῶν , and as in the strictly parallel words of 4 Kings Acts 2:12 , οὐκ εἶδεν αὐτὸν ἔτι , after the going up of Elijah. These last words in my view decide the question, that the departure of Philip was miraculous.
	 γάρ ] refers to  what follows (  Φ  .   δὲ εὑρ .). Philip was found at Azotus: if the eunuch had gone  that way , he might have met with him again: but he did not, for he went from the fountain  on his own way , which did not lead through Azotus.
