<p><strong> 39. </strong> <strong> πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κυρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἥρπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Φ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The reading, ‘ <em> the Spirit fell on the Eunuch, and an angel of the Lord caught away Philip</em> ,’ is curious, and has probably arisen from a desire to conform the results of the eunuch’s baptism to the usual method of the divine procedure, and the snatching away of Philip to his commission, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:26">Acts 8:26</span> . But the Spirit did not fall on the Samaritans after baptism by Philip.
	</p>
<p>The text clearly relates a supernatural disappearance of Philip: compare μήποτε ᾖρεν αὐτὸν πνεῦμα κυρίου , 4 Kings <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:16">Acts 2:16</span> ; no interpretation (as Eichhorn, Kuin., Olsh., Meyer) of his being suddenly hurried away by the prompting of the Spirit, will satisfy the analogy of the above-cited passage, and of (see below) a parallel one in Luke’s own Gospel. The ἁρπάζειν of ref. John, which Meyer cites to justify his view, tells in my mind the other way; the fear was lest the multitude should come and <em> carry Him off</em> to make Him a King: and in the reff. I have therefore marked the two as bearing the same meaning.
	</p>
<p><strong> οὐκ εἶδεν αὐτὸν οὐκέτι</strong> ] Not ‘never saw him from that day,’ though (see below) that meaning may be indirectly included: but as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:31">Luke 24:31</span> , αὐτὸς ἄφαντος ἐγένετο ἀπ ʼ αὐτῶν , and as in the strictly parallel words of 4 Kings <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:12">Acts 2:12</span> , οὐκ εἶδεν αὐτὸν ἔτι , after the going up of Elijah. These last words in my view decide the question, that the departure of Philip was miraculous.
	</p>
<p><strong> γάρ</strong> ] refers to <em> what follows</em> ( <strong> Φ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δὲ</strong> εὑρ .). Philip was found at Azotus: if the eunuch had gone <em> that way</em> , he might have met with him again: but he did not, for he went from the fountain <em> on his own way</em> , which did not lead through Azotus.</p>
