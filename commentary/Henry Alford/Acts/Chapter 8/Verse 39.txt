<b> 39. saw him no more</b>] Not ‘never saw him from that day,’ though (see below) that meaning may be indirectly included:—but as in Luke xxiv. 31, “<i>He vanished from their sight,</i>” and as in the strictly parallel words of 2 Kings ii. 12, “<i>he saw him no more</i>,”—after the going up of Elijah. These last words in my view decide the question, that the departure of Philip was miraculous.
