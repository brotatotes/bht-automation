<b> 39. saw him no more</b>] Not ‘never saw him from that day,’ though (see below) that meaning may be indirectly included:—but as in Luke xxiv. 31, “<i>He vanished from their sight,</i>” and as in the strictly parallel words of 2 Kings ii. 12, “<i>he saw him no more</i>,”—after the going up of Elijah. These last words in my view decide the question, that the departure of Philip was miraculous.<br><br><b> for he went on his way</b>] This refers to<i> what follows:</i>—Philip was found at Azotus: if the eunuch had gone<i> that way</i>, he might have met with him again: but he did not, for he went from the fountain<i> on his own way</i>, which did not lead through Azotus. There has been some strange inadvertence in this verse on the part of the translators of the A.V. The Greek has plainly,<b> and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing:</b> and there is no variety of reading.
