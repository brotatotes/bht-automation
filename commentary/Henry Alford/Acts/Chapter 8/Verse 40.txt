<b> 40.</b>] The term “<i>was found</i>” again appears to refer to 4 Kings ii. ver. 17.—AZOTUS or ASHDOD (Josh. xiii. 3; 1 Sam. v. 5 al.) was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines, never, though nominally in Judah, thoroughly subjugated by the Jews: it was taken by Tartan the Assyrian general (Isa. xx. 1),—again by Psammetichus, Jer. xxv. 20,—again by Judas Maccabæus (1 Macc. v. 68) and Jonathan (1 Macc. x. 84), and the latter destroyed;—rebuilt by Gabinius, and belonged to the kingdom of Herod, who left it in his will to his sister Salome. At present it is a small village, retaining the name Esdud, but there are no remains.
