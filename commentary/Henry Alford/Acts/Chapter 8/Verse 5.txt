 5.   Φίλιππος ]  The deacon ; not, as apparently implied in the citation from Polycrates in Eus [53] H. E. iii. 31, Acts 8:24 ,  one of the twelve : this is precluded by Acts 8:1 ; Acts 8:14 . And it is probable, that the persecution should have been directed especially against the colleagues of Stephen. Philip is mentioned again as ὁ εὐαγγελιστής , probably from his having been the first recorded who εὐηγγελίσατο τὸν λόγον , in ch. Acts 21:8 , as married and having four daughters, virgins, who prophesied.

	 πόλιν τ  .   Σαμ .] Verbatim as John 4:5 , in which case it is specified as being Sychar (Sichem). As the words stand here ( πόλιν = τὴν πόλιν , after εἰς , compare also 2Pe 2:6 ), seeing that Σαμάρεια (Acts 8:9 ; Acts 8:14 ; ch. Acts 9:31 ; Act 15:3 ) signifies the  district , I should be inclined to believe that Sychem is here also intended. It was a place of rising importance, and in after-times eclipsed the fame of its neighbour Samaria, which latter had been, on its presentation by Augustus to Herod the Great, re-fortified and called Sebaste, Jos. Antt. xv. 7. 3, and 8. 5. It still, however, bore the name of Samaria, Jos. xx. 6. 2, where, from the context, the  district can hardly be intended.
	 αὐτοῖς ] The inhabitants, implied in πόλις .
