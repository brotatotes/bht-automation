 7. ] According to the reading in the text, which is too strongly upheld by manuscript authority to be rejected for the easier ordinary one, πολλαί is a ‘nominativus pendens’ (compare ch. Acts 7:40 ; Revelation 3:12 . Winer, edn. 6, § 29. 1),  For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they crying out with a loud voice, came out:  ἐξήρχοντο being plur., as often when the neuter plural betokens living agents; see Winer, edn. 6, § 58. 3, a. β .
	 πολλοί has probably been altered to πολλῶν , to agree with τῶν ἐχόντων , on the difficulty being perceived.
