<b> 9. Simon</b>] Neander, in the course of some excellent remarks on this whole history (see further on ver. 14), identifies, and I believe with reason, this Simon with one mentioned as living from ten to twenty years after this by Josephus, and as having been employed by the procurator Felix to tempt Drusilla to leave her husband, and live with him. Simon is there called “a Jew, born in Cyprus, and held to be a magician.” The only difficulty seems to be, that Simon is stated by Justin Martyr, himself a Samaritan, to have been “a Samaritan, from a village called Gitton.” But it has struck me that either Justin, or perhaps more probably Josephus, may have confounded Ghittim with Chittim, i.e. Citium in Cyprus. The account in Josephus is quite in character with what we here read of Simon: not inconsistent with ver. 24, which appears to have been uttered under terror occasioned by the solemn denunciation of Peter.—Justin goes on to relate that he was worshipped as a god at Rome in the time of Claudius Cæsar, on account of his magical powers, and had a statue on the island in the Tiber, inscribed ‘Simoni Deo Sancto’ (to Simon the Holy God). Singularly enough, in the year 1574, a stone was found in the Tiber (or<i> standing on the island in the year</i> 1662, according to Smith’s Dictionary of Biography and Mythology), with the inscription SEMONI SANCO DEO FIDIO SACRUM, i.e. sacred to the god<i> Semo Sancus</i>, the Sabine Hereules;—which makes it probable that Justin may have been misled.—The history of Simon is full of legend and fable. He is said to have studied at Alexandria, and to have originally been, with the heresiarch Dositheus, a disciple of John the Baptist. Of Dositheus he became first the disciple, and then the successor. Origen makes Dositheus also a Samaritan, His own especial followers (Simoniani) had dwindled so much in the time of Origen, that he says there were at that day hardly thirty in the world. There are reports also of subsequent controversies between Simon Magus and Peter, of which the scene is laid at Cæsarea. According to some, he met with his death at Rome, having, during an encounter with Peter, raised himself into the air by the aid of evil spirits, and being precipitated thence at the prayer of Peter and Paul. I saw in the church of S. Francesca Romana, in the forum, a stone with two dents in it, and this inscription: “On this stone rested the knees of S. Peter, when the demons carried Simon Magus through the air.’—The fathers generally regard him as the founder of Gnosticism: this may be in some sense true: but, from the very little authentic information we possess, it is impossible to ascertain how far be was identified with their tenets. Origen distinctly denies that his followers were Christians in any sense.
