Doubtless they (or at least the former) would long be remembered and pointed out by Christians; but, in the long degradation of Christianity in the East, most of such identities must have been lost; and imposture is so easy, that it is hardly possible to cherish the thought that the spots now pointed out can be the true ones. And so of all cases, where we have not unalterable or unaltered data to go on. Still, true as this is, we have sometimes proofs and illustrations unexpectedly appearing, as research goes on, which identify as authentic, sites long pointed out by tradition. So that our way seems to be, to seek for all such elucidations, and meantime to suspend our judgment: but never to lose sight of, nor to treat contemptuously at first sight, a local belief.<br><br><b> of Tarsus</b>] The first place where he is so specified.—TARSUS was the capital of the province of Cilicia, a large and populous city in a fruitful plain on the river Cydnus, which flowed through the midst of it, with a swift stream of remarkably cold water.

It was a “<i>free city</i>,” i.e. one which, though under Rome, lived under its own laws and chose its own magistrates. This<i> freedom</i> was granted to it by Antony: and much later we find it a Roman<i> colony</i>. It is now a town with about 20, 000 inhabitants, and is described as being a den of poverty, filth, and ruins. There are many remains of the old town.<br><br><b> behold, he prayeth</b>] This word would set before Ananias, more powerfully than any other, the state of Saul.
