<b> 15. a vessel of choice</b>] i.e. a chosen vessel: as we say, ‘the man of his choice.’ St. Paul often uses this word<i> vessel</i> in a similar meaning, see 2 Cor. iv. 7; 1 Thess. iv. 4; 2 Tim. ii. 21; and especially Rom. ix. 22, 23, &c., where it is used in illustrating God’s sovereign power in election.
