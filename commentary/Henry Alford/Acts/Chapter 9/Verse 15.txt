	Paul often uses this word σκεῦος in a similar meaning, see reff., especially Romans 9:0 , &c., where it is in illustrating God’s sovereign power in election.

	 ἐθνῶν ] This would hardly be understood at the time: it was afterwards on a remarkable occasion repeated to Paul by the Lord in a vision (see ch. Act 22:21 ), and was regarded by him as the specific command which gave the direction to his ministry, see Galatians 2:7-8 .
	 βασιλ .] Agrippa, and probably Nero.
