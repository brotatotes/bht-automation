<b> 17. and he filled with the Holy Ghost</b>] I ean hardly think that these words imply that the Lord had said to Ananias more than is above related: I would rather view them as a natural inference from what was said in ver. 15.—In ch. xxii. 14, where the command to Ananias is omitted,<i> his</i> speech contains much of the reason given in the command here. It is remarkable again how Paul, speaking there to an infuriated Jewish mob, gives the words spoken just that form which would best gain him a favourable hearing with them,—for example, “<i>the God of our fathers,</i>”— “<i>to see that Just One</i>,” “<i>all men</i>,” avoiding as yet the hateful word “<i>Gentiles</i>.” He there too gives, “<i>Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling upon the name of the Lord,</i>” as part of the exhortation of Ananias.
