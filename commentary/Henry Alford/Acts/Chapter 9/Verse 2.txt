	 εἰς Δαμασκόν ] DAMASCUS is probably the oldest existing city in the world. We read of it in Abraham’s time (Genesis 14:15 ; Gen 15:2 ): then no more till David subdued it ( 2Sa 8:6 ): it became independent again under Solomon (1 Kings 11:24 ff.), and from that time was the residence of the kings of Syria (1 Kings 15:18 ; 1 Kings 20:1 ff.), who were long at war with Israel and Judah, and at last were permitted to prevail considerably over Israel (2 Kings 10:32 ; Amo 1:3-4 ) and to exact tribute from Judah (2 Kings 12:17-18 , see also 2 Kings 13:3 ; 2Ki 13:22 ; 2Ki 13:25 ). Damascus was recovered to Israel by Jeroboam II. (cir. 825 A.C. 2Ki 14:28 ). Not long after we find Rezin, king of Syria, in league with Pekah, king of Israel, against Ahaz ( 2Ki 15:37 ). Ahaz invited to his assistance Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, who took Damascus and slew Rezin, and led the people captive (2 Kings 16:5-9 ; Isa 8:4 ). From this time we find it subject to Assyria (Isaiah 9:11 ; Isaiah 10:9 ; Isa 17:1 ), then to Babylon (2 Kings 24:2 ; Jer 35:11 ), Persia (Arrian. Alex. ii. 11, Δαρεῖος τῶν χρημ . τὰ πολλὰ … πεπόμφει εἰς Δαμασκόν , Strabo, xvi. 756; Q. Curt. iii. 12. 27), the Syrian Seleucidæ ( 1Ma 11:62 ; 1Ma 12:32 ), and from the time of Pompey (64 A.C.), to the Romans, and attached to the province of Syria (Jos. Antt. xiv. 4. 5; 9. 5). Many Jews were settled there, and the majority of the wives of the citizens were proselytes, Jos. B. J. ii. 20. 2.
	On its subjection to Aretas, see below, Acts 9:24 , note. It was later the residence of the Ommiad Caliphs, and the metropolis of the Mahommedan world. (Conybeare and Howson, edn. 2, vol. i. p. 106.)
	At present it is a large city, with (Burckhardt) 250,000 inhabitants, nearly 70,000 of whom are Christians.
	It is situated most beautifully, in a large and well-watered plain, on the river Chrysorrhoas (Barrada), which divides into many streams (see 2Ki 5:12 ), and fertilizes the plain (Strabo, xvi. 756, ἡ Δαμασκηνὴ χώρα διαφερόντως ἐπαινουμένη ), bounded on all sides by the desert. See Winer, Realw., from which the above is mainly taken: Vitringa in Jesaiam, p. 650 ff. (Notitia Damasci et Regni Damasceni), and a vivid description in C. and H., pp. 104 108.

	 τῆς ὁδοῦ ] Not ‘  this way ,’ E. V., which rendering should be kept for the places where the pronoun is  expressed , as ch. Acts 22:4 , but  the way , viz. of ‘salvation,’ ch. Acts 16:17 , or ‘of the Lord,’ ch. Acts 18:25 . (The genitive, as τῆς γνώμης εἶναι , see 1 Corinthians 1:12 .) The expression ‘THE WAY’ had evidently become a well-known one among Christians (see reff.); and it only was necessary to prefix the pronoun when  strangers were addressed.
	The special journey to Damascus presupposes the existence of Christians there, and in some numbers. This would be accounted for by the return of many who may have been converted at the Pentecostal effusion of the Spirit, and perhaps also by some of the fugitives from the persecution having settled there. This latter is rendered probable by Ananias’s ἤκουσα ἀπὸ πολλῶν περὶ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς τούτου , Acts 9:13 .
