 20.   Ἰησοῦν ] The alteration to χριστόν has probably, as Meyer suggests, been made from doctrinal considerations, to fix on ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ the theological sense,  that Christ is the Son of God instead of that which it now bears, that  Jesus is the Son of God , i.e. that Jesus of Nazareth  as a matter of fact , is the Son of God, i.e. the Messiah expected under that appellation. Be this as it may, the following  τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο ( Act 9:21 ) is decisive for the reading Ἰησοῦν , and οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ χριστός Act 9:22 still more so.
