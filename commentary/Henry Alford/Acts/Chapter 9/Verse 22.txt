<b> 22.</b>] I regard the expression<b> Saul increased the more in strength</b>, as the<i> only words beneath which can lie concealed the journey to Arabia</i>. Paul mentions this journey (Gal. i. 17) with no obscure hint that to it was to be assigned the reception by him, in full measure, of the Gospel which he preached. And such a reception would certainly give rise to the great accession of power here recorded. I am the more disposed to allot that journey this place, from the following considerations. The omission of any mention of it here can arise only from one of two causes: (1) whether Paul himself were the source of the narrative, or some other narrator,—<i>the intentional passing over of it, as belonging more to his personal history</i> (which it was his express purpose to relate in Gal. i.)<i> than to that of his ministry:</i> (2) on the supposition of Paul not having been the source of the narrative,—<i>the narrator having not been aware of it</i>. In either case, this expression seems to me one very likely to have been used:— (1) if the omis-sion was<i> intentional</i>,—to record a remarkable accession of power to Saul’s ministry, without particularizing whence or how it came: (2) if it was<i> unintentional</i>,—as a simple record of that which was observed in him, but of which the course was to the narrator unknown.
