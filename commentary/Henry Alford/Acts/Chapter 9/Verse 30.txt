He was praying in the temple, and saw the Lord in a vision, who commanded him to depart, for they would not receive his testimony:—and sent him from thence to the Gentiles: see ch. xxii, 17–21 and notes. His stay in Jerusalem at this visit was fifteen days, Gal. i. 18.<br><br><b> to Cæsarea</b>] From the whole cast of the sentence, and the words<b> brought him down</b> and<b> sent him forth</b>, we should infer this to be Cæsarea Stratonis (see on ch. x. 1), even if this were not determined by the word<i> Cæsarea</i> used absolutely, which always applies to this city, and not to Cæsarea Philippi (which some believe to be meant: see Matt. xvi. 13 and note). From Gal. i. 21, it would appear that Saul about this time<i> traversed Syria</i> (on his way to Tarsus?). If so, he probably went by sea to Seleucia, and thence to Antioch. The expression<b> sent him forth</b>, looks more like a ‘sending off’ by sea, than a mere ‘sending forward’ by land. They sent him<b> towards</b>, ‘for,’ Tarsus. He was not idle there, but certainly preached the Gospel, and in all probability was the founder of the churches alluded to ch. xv. 23 and 41.
