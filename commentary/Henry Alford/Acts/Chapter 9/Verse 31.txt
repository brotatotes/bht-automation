<b> 31.</b>] FLOURIsHING STATE OF THE CHURCH IN PALESTINE AT THIS TIME. Commencement of new section: compare note, ch. xi. 19. The reading<b> church</b>, instead of “<i>churches</i>,” can hardly (as Meyer) be an alteration to suit the idea of<i> the unity of the church</i>,—as in that case we should have similar alterations in ch. xv. 41; xvi. 5, where<i> no variations are found in the chief MSS.</i> More probably, it has been altered here to conform it to those places. This description probably embraces most of the time since the conversion of Saul. De Wette observes, that the attention of the Jews was, during much of this time, distracted from the Christians, by the attempt of Caligula to set up his image in the temple at Jerusalem, related by Josephus.<br><br><b> being built up</b>, or<i> edified</i>: see Matt. xvi. 18. It probably refers to both external and internal strength and accession of grace. St. Paul commonly uses it of<i> spiritual</i> building up: see 1 Cor. viii, 1; x. 23; xiv. 4, 17; 1 Thess. v. 11.<br><br><b> and was multiplied by the exhortation of</b> (i. e. inspired by)<b> the Holy Spirit</b>] This is the only rendering which suits the usage of the words. See on the others which have been given, in my Greek Testament.
