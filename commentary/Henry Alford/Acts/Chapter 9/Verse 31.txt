 31 .] FLOURISHING STATE OF THE CHURCH IN PALESTINE AT THIS TIME. Commencement of new section: compare μὲν οὖν , and note, ch. Acts 11:19 . The reading  ἐκκλησία can hardly (as Meyer) be an alteration to suit the idea of  the unity of the church , as in that case we should have similar alterations in ch. Acts 15:41 ; Acts 16:5 , where  no variations are found in the chief MSS. More probably, it has been altered here to conform it to those places. This description probably embraces most of the time since the conversion of Saul. De Wette observes, that the attention of the Jews was, during much of this time, distracted from the Christians, by the attempt of Caligula to set up his image in the temple at Jerusalem, Jos. Antt. xviii. 8. 2 9.
	 οἰκοδομουμένη ] See Matthew 16:18 . It probably refers to both external and internal strength and accession of grace. Paul commonly uses it of  spiritual building up: see reff.
	 πορ  .   τῷ φόβ  . ]  walking in the fear : for construction see reff.: not ‘  following after the fear ’ (Winer, edn. 2, § 31. 1; not in edn. 6, see § 31. 9), nor ‘walking  according to the fear’ as their  rule (Meyer), nor ‘  advancing in the fear’ (Beza, Wolf).
	 κ. τ. παρακλ. τ. ἁγ. πν. ἐπληθ. ]  And was multiplied (reff.) by the exhortation of (i.e. inspired by) the  Holy Spirit . This is the only rendering which suits the usage of the words. Those of the Vulg. ‘consolatione replebantur,’ of Kuin., ‘adjumento abundabant,’ are unexampled, see reff.
	Neither must τῇ παρακλ . be coupled with τῷ φόβῳ , as in E. V., and by Beza and Rosenmüller, which would leave οἰκοδομ . standing by itself, and render the sentence totally unlike Luke’s usual manner of writing.
