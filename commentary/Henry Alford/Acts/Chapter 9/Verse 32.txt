<b> 32. as Peter passed throughout all....</b>] These words are aptly introduced by the notice in ver. 31, which shews that Peter’s journey was not an escape from persecution, but undertaken at a time of peace, and for the purpose of visiting the churches.—The word<b> all</b>, to which no substantive is supplied in the original, may be neuter, ‘all parts:’ but it is probably masculine, and “all the saints” or “all the brethren” are understood. As I have implied on ver. 31, this journey of Peter’s is not necessarily consecutive on the events of vv. 1–30. But an alternative presents itself here; either it took place<i> before</i> the arrival of Saul in Jerusalem, or<i> after his departure</i>: for Peter<i> was there during his visit</i> (Gal. i. 18). It seems most likely that it was<i> before his arrival.</i> For (1) it is St. Luke’s manner in this first part of the Acts, where he is carrying on several histories together, to follow the one in hand as far as some resting-point, and then go back and take up another: see ch. viii. 2 thus taken up from ver. 1: ver. 4 going back to the dispersion:—ch. ix. 1 taken up from viii. 3:—xi. 19, from viii. 4 again:—and (2) the journey of Peter to visit the churches which were now resting after the persecution would hardly be delayed so long as three whole years. So that it is most natural to place this section, viz. ch. ix. 32–xi. 18 (for all this is continuous),<i> before the visit of Saul to Jerusalem,</i> and during his stay at Damascus or in Arabia.
