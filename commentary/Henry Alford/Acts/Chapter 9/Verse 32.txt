<p><strong> 32. </strong> <strong> διερχόμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> π</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] These words are aptly introduced by the notice in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span> , which shews that Peter’s journey was not an escape from persecution, but undertaken at a time of peace, and for the purpose of visiting the churches.

<p><strong> πάντων</strong> may be neuter, ‘all parts:’ but it is probably masc. and ἁγίων understood. Wieseler (p. 145, note) doubts whether we can say διέρχεσθαι διὰ πάντων τ . ἁγίων , but see reff. The καί makes the masc. more likely, as it presupposes some ἅγιοι in the mind of the writer before.

<p>As I have implied on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span> , this journey of Peter’s is not necessarily consecutive on the events of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:1-30">Acts 9:1-30</span> . But an alternative presents itself here; either it took place <em> before the arrival</em> of Saul in Jerusalem, or <em> after his departure</em> : for Peter <em> was there during his visit</em> ( Gal 1:18 ). It seems most likely that it was <em> before his arrival</em> . For (1) it is Luke’s manner in this first part of the Acts, where he is carrying on several histories together, to follow the one in hand as far as some resting-point, and then go back and take up another: see ch. Act 8:2 thus taken up from ἀναιρέσει αὐτοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1">Acts 8:1</span> ; Act 8:4 going back to the διασπαρέντες : ch. Act 9:1 taken up from Act 8:3 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span> , from Act 8:4 again: and (2) the journey of Peter to visit the churches which were now resting after the persecution would hardly be delayed so long as three whole years. So that it is most natural to place this section, viz. ch. Act 9:32 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:18">Acts 11:18</span> (for all this is continuous), <em> before the visit of Saul to Jerusalem</em> , and during his stay at Damascus or in Arabia. See further on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:19">Acts 11:19</span> .

<p><strong> Λύδδα</strong> ] Lod, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ne+7:37">Nehemiah 7:37</span> . A large village near Joppa ( Act 9:38 ), on the Mediterranean (Jos. Antt. xx. 6. 2, κώμην τινὰ Λύδδαν λεγομ ., πόλεως τὸ μέγεθος οὐκ ἀποδέουσαν ), just one day’s journey from Jerusalem (Lightf., Cent. Chor. Matth. præm. cxvi.). It afterwards became the important town of Diospolis.</p>
