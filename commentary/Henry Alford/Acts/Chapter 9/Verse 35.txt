 35.   πάντες  .…   οἵτινες ] Not ‘  all, who had turned to the Lord ,’ as Kuin.: this would make the mention of the fact unmeaning, and surely more would see him than the believers merely. The similar use of οἵτινες in the ref. shews its meaning to be  commensurate with the preceding  πάντες , and to gather them into a class, of which that which follows is predicated.  All that dwelt in L. and S. saw him; which also (i.e. and they)  turned to the Lord . A general conversion of the inhabitants to the faith followed.
	 τὸν Σάρωνα ] Perhaps not a village, but (and the art. makes this probable) the celebrated  plain of that name, extending along the coast from Cæsarea to Joppa, see Isaiah 33:9 ; Isaiah 35:2 ; Isaiah 65:10 ; Song of Solomon 2:1 ; 1 Chronicles 27:29 ; and Jerome on Isaiah 33, 65, vol. iv., pp. 436, 780.
	Mariti (Travels, p. 350) mentions a village Saren between Lydda and Arsuf (see Joshua 12:18 , marg. E. V.): but more recent travellers do not notice it. See Winer, Realw., where other places of the same name are mentioned.
