<p><strong> 35. </strong> <strong> πάντες</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> οἵτινες</strong> ] Not ‘ <em> all, who had turned to the Lord</em> ,’ as Kuin.: this would make the mention of the fact unmeaning, and surely more would see him than the believers merely. The similar use of οἵτινες in the ref. shews its meaning to be <em> commensurate with the preceding</em> <strong> πάντες</strong> , and to gather them into a class, of which that which follows is predicated. <strong> All that dwelt in L. and S. saw him; which also</strong> (i.e. and they) <strong> turned to the Lord</strong> . A general conversion of the inhabitants to the faith followed.

<p><strong> τὸν Σάρωνα</strong> ] Perhaps not a village, but (and the art. makes this probable) the celebrated <em> plain</em> of that name, extending along the coast from Cæsarea to Joppa, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+33:9">Isaiah 33:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:2">Isaiah 35:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:10">Isaiah 65:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="so+2:1">Song of Solomon 2:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ch+27:29">1 Chronicles 27:29</span> ; and Jerome on Isaiah 33, 65, vol. iv., pp. 436, 780.

<p>Mariti (Travels, p. 350) mentions a village Saren between Lydda and Arsuf (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jos+12:18">Joshua 12:18</span> , marg. E. V.): but more recent travellers do not notice it. See Winer, Realw., where other places of the same name are mentioned.</p>
