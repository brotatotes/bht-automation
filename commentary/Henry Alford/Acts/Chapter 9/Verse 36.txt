<p><strong> 36. </strong> <strong> ἐν Ἰόππῃ</strong> ] Joppa was a very ancient Philistian city, on the frontier of Dan, but not belonging to that tribe, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jos+19:46">Joshua 19:46</span> ; on the coast (ch. Act 10:6 ), with a celebrated but not very secure harbour (Jos. B. J. iii. 9. 3: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+2:16">2 Chronicles 2:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ezr+3:7">Ezra 3:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jon+1:3">Jonah 1:3</span> ; 1Ma 14:5 ; 2Ma 12:3 ), situated in a plain ( 1Ma 10:75-77 ) near Lydda ( Act 9:38 ), at the end of the mountain road connecting Jerusalem with the sea. The Maccabean generals, Jonathan and Simon, took it from the Syrians and fortified it ( 1Ma 10:74-76 ; 1Ma 14:5 ; 1Ma 14:34 . Jos. Antt. xiii. 9. 2). Pompey joined it to the province of Syria (Antt. xiv. 4. 4), but Cæsar restored it to Hyrcanus (xiv. 10. 6), and it afterwards formed part of the kingdom ot Herod (xv. 7. 3) and of Archelaus (xvii. 11. 4), after whose deposition it reverted to the province of Syria, to which it belonged at the time of our narrative. It was destroyed by C. Cestius (Jos. B. J. ii. 18.10); but rebuilt, and became a nest of Jewish pirates (Strabo, xvi. 759), in consequence of which Vespasian levelled it with the ground, and built a fort there (B. J. iii. 9. 3, 4), which soon became the nucleus of a new town. It is now called Jaffa ( Ἰάφα , Anna Comnena, Alex. ii. p. 328), and has about 7000 inhabitants, half of whom are Christians.
