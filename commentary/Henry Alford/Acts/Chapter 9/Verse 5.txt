 5.   ὁ δέ ] That Saul  saw , as well as heard, Him who spoke with him, is certain from Ananias’s speech, Acts 9:17 , and ch. Acts 22:14 , that of Barnabas, Acts 9:27 , from ch. Acts 26:16 ( ὤφθην σοι ), and from the references by Paul himself to his having seen the Lord, 1Co 9:1 ; 1 Corinthians 15:8 . These last I unhesitatingly refer to this occasion, and not to any subsequent one, when he saw the Lord ἐν ἐκστάσει , ch. Acts 22:17 . Such appearances could hardly form the subject of autoptic testimony which should rank with that of the other apostles: this, on the contrary, was no ἔκστασις , but the  real bodily appearance of the risen Jesus : so that it might be adduced as the ground of testimony to His Resurrection.
	On the words excluded from our text, as having been interpolated from ch. Acts 26:14 , and Acts 22:10 , see note at Acts 26:14 . It is natural that the account of the  historian should be less precise than that of the  person concerned, relating his own history . In ch. Acts 26:15-18 , very much more is related to have been said by the Lord: but perhaps he there, as he omits the subsequent particulars, includes the revelations made to him during the three days, and in the message of Ananias.
