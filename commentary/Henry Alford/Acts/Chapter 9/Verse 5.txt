<b> 5.</b>] That Saul<i> saw</i>, as well as heard, Him who spoke with him, is certain from Ananias’s speech, ver. 17, and ch. xxii. 14,—that of Barnabas, ver. 27,—from ch. xxvi. 16 ( “<i>I</i> [have]<i> appeared unto thee</i>’), and from the references by Paul himself to his having seen the Lord, 1 Cor. ix. 1; xv. 8. These last I unhesitatingly refer to this occasion, and not to any subsequent one, when he saw the Lord<i> in a trance</i>, ch. xxii. 17. Such appearances could hardly form the subject of the testimony of an eyewitness which should rank with that of the other apostles: this, on the contrary, was no<i> trance</i>, but the<i> real bodily appearance of the risen Jesus;</i> so that it might be adduced as the ground of testimony to His Resurrection.—On the words excluded from our text, as having been interpolated from ch. xxvi. 14, and xxii. 10, see note at xxvi. 14. It is natural that the account of the<i> historian</i> should be less precise than that of the<i> person concerned, relating his own history.</i> In ch. xxvi. 15–18, very much more is related to have been said by the Lord: but perhaps he there, as he omits the subsequent particulars, includes the revelations made to him during the three days, and in the message of Ananias.
