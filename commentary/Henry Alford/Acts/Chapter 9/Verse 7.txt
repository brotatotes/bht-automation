<b> 7.</b>] In ch. xxii. 9, we read, “<i>They that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid: but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</i>” Two accounts seemingly (and certainly, in the<i> letter</i>) discrepant; but exceedingly instructive when their<i> spirit</i> is compared,—the fact being this: that the companions of Saul saw and were struck to the ground by the light, but saw<i> no person</i>:—that they stood (I should acknowledge the discrepancy here, and recognize the more accurate detail of ch. xxvi. 14, that they<i> fell</i><i> to the ground</i>) mute, hearing the sound of the voice, but not the words spoken and their meaning. Compare John xii. 29, note. Two classes of readers only will stumble at this difference of the forms of narration; those who from enmity to the faith are striving to create or magnify discrepancies,—and those who, by the suicidal theory of verbal inspiration, are effectually doing the work of the former. The devout and intelligent student of Scripture will see in such examples a convincing proof of the simple truth of the narrative,—the absence of all endeavour to pare aware apparent inconsistencies or revise them into conformity,—the<i> bonâ fide</i> work of holy truthful men, bearing each his testimony to things seen and heard under the guidance, not of the spirit of bondage, but of that Spirit of whom it is said, “<i>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty</i>.’—I should not too hastily determine that this account<i> has not come from Saul himself</i>, on account of the above differences: they are no more than might arise in narrations at different times by the same person.
