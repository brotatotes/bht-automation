<b> 12</b>.]<b> giving thanks to the Father</b> (the connexion is not, as Chrysostom and others, with “<i>we do not cease</i>,” in ver. 9, the subject being we, Paul and Timothy,—but with the last words [see above], and the subjects are<i> ‘you</i>.’<b> The Father</b>, viz. of our Lord Jesus Christ),<b> which made</b> (historical—by His gift of the Spirit through His Son: not “<i>hath made</i>,” as A.V.)<b> us</b> (Christians)<b> meet</b> (or,<b> capable</b>)<b> for the share</b> (participation)<b> of the inheritance of the saints in</b> [<b>the</b>]<b> light</b> (it is much disputed with what in [the] light is to be joined. Meyer, after Chrysostom and others, regards it as instrumental—as the means of the<i> making meet</i> which has been mentioned. But this seems unnatural, both in sense, and in the position of the words, in which it stands too far from “<i>made us meet</i>” to be its qualifying clause. It connects much more naturally with the word “<i>inheritance</i>,” or perhaps better still with the whole, “<i>the portion of the inheritance of the saints</i>,” giving “<i>the light</i>” as the region in which the inheritance of the saints, and consequently our share in it, is situated. Some would take “<i>the saints in (the) light</i>” together: but it does not seem so natural, as giving too great prominence to “<i>those who shall gain</i>” the inheritance, and not enough to the inheritance itself. The question as to whether he is speaking of a present inheritance, or the future glory of heaven, seems best answered by Chrysostom, who says, “He seems to me to be speaking at the same time of things present and things to come.” The inheritance is begun here, and the meetness conferred, in gradual sanctification: but completed hereafter. We are “<i>in the light</i>” here: see Rom. xiii, 12, 13; 1 Thess. v. 5; Eph. v. 8; 1 Pet. ii. 9 al.):
