<b> 15.</b>] (the last verse has been a sort of introduction, through our own part in Him, to the Person of the Redeemer, which is now directly treated of, as against the teachers of error at Colossæ. He is described,<i> in His relation</i> 1)<i> to God and His Creation</i> [vv. 15–17]: 2)<i> to the Church</i> [18–20])<b> who is</b> (<i>now</i>—in His glorified state—essentially and permanently: therefore not to be understood of the<i> historical</i> Christ, God manifested in our flesh on earth: nor again of the<i> eternal Word</i>: but of Christ’s present glorified state, in which He is exalted in our humanity, but exalted to that glory which He had with the Father before the world was. So that the following description applies to Christ’s whole Person in its essential glory,—now however, by His assumption of humanity, necessarily otherwise conditioned than before that assumption. See for the whole, notes on Phil. ii. 6, and Heb. i. 2 f.)<b> the image of the invisible God</b> (the adjunct invisible is of the utmost weight to the understanding of the expression. The same fact being the foundation of the whole as in Phil. ii. 6 ff., that the Son<i> subsisted in the form of God</i>, that side of the fact is brought out<i> here</i>, which points to His being the<i> visible</i> manifestation of that in God which is<i> invisible</i>: the word of the eternal silence, the<i> shining forth</i> of the<i> glory</i> which no creature can bear, the<i> expressed mark</i> of that<i> Person</i> which is incommunicably God’s; in one word, the<i> declarer</i> of the Father, whom none hath seen. So that while the epithet<b> invisible</b> includes in it not only the<i> invisibility</i>, but the incommunicability of God, the term<b> image</b> also must not be restricted to Christ corporeally visible in the Incarnation, but understood of Him as the manifestation of God in His whole Person and work—pre-existent and incarnate. It is obvious, that in this expression, the Apostle approaches very near to the Alexandrian doctrine of the<i> Logos</i> or<i> Word</i>: how near, may be seen by an extract from Philo: “As they who cannot look upon the sun, behold the sunshine opposite to him as himself, and the changing phases of the moon as being himself: so men apprehend<i> the image of God, His Angel the Word, as being Himself.</i>” St. Paul is, in fact, as St. John afterwards did, adopting the language of that lore as far as it represented divine truth, and rescuing it from being used in the service of error),<b> the first-born of all creation</b> (such, and not ‘<i>every creature</i>,’ is the meaning. See the reason for maintaining this in my Greek Test.—Christ is THE FIRST-BORN, Heb. i. 6. The idea was well known in the Alexandrian doctrine, and found in the writings of Philo. That the word is used as one whose meaning and reference was already known to the readers, is shewn by its being predicated of Christ as compared with two classes so different, the<i> creatures</i>, and the<i> dead</i> (ver. 18).—The first and simplest meaning is that of<i> priority of birth</i>. But this, if insisted on, in its limited temporal sense, must apply to our Lord’s birth from his<i> human mother</i>, and could have reference only to those brothers and sisters who were born of her afterwards; a reference clearly excluded here. But a secondary and derived meaning of “<i>first-born</i>,” as a designation of<i> dignity and precedence, implied by priority</i>, cannot be denied. See Ps, lxxxix. 27, “<i>I will make him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth.</i>” Exod. iv. 22; Rom. viii. 29, and Heb. xii. 28. It would be obviously wrong here to limit the sense entirely to this reference, as the very expression below, “<i>He is before all things</i>,” shews, in which His priority is distinctly predicated. The safe method of interpretation therefore will be, to take into account the two ideas manifestly included in the word, and here dis-tinctly referred to—priority, and dignity, and to regard the technical term “<i>first-born</i>” as used rather with reference to both these, than in strict construction where it stands. “First-born of every creature” will then imply, that Christ was not only first-born of His mother in the world, but first-begotten of His Father, before the worlds,—and that He holds the rank, as compared with every created thing, of first-born in dignity: BECAUSE, &c., ver. 16, where this assertion is justified. See below on ver. 18):
