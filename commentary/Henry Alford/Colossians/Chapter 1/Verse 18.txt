<b> 18.</b>]<b> And He</b> (emphatic; not any angels nor created beings: the whole following passage has a controversial bearing on the errors of the Colossian teachers)<b> is the Head of the body, the Church</b> (the genitive is one of apposition, inasmuch as in St. Paul, it is the church which<i> is</i>, not which<i> possesses</i>, the body):<b> who</b> (as if it had been said, ‘in that He is:’ the relative has an argumentative force)<b> is the beginning</b> (of the Church of the First-born, being Himself<i> first-born from the dead</i>. Compare “<i>Christ the firstfruits,</i>” 1 Cor. xv. 23, and especially Gen. xlix. 3; Deut. xxi. 17; Rev. iii. 14. But the word evidently has, standing as it does here alone, a wider and more glorious reference than that of mere temporal precedence: see note on Rev. iii. 14: He is the Beginning, in that in Him is begun and conditioned the Church, vv. 19, 20),<b> the First-born from</b> (among)<b> the dead</b> (i. e. the first who arose from among the dead: but the term<i> first-born</i> [see above] being predicated of Christ in both references, he uses it here, regarding the resurrection as a kind of birth. On that which is implied in<i> it</i>, see above on ver. 15);<b> that He</b> (emphatic again: see above)<b> may become</b> (the<i> aim</i> and<i> purpose</i> of this his priority over creation and in resurrection)<b> in all things pre-eminent</b> (<i>first in rank</i>: the word is a transitional one, from priority in time to priority in dignity, and shews incontestably that the two ideas have been before the Apostle’s mind throughout).
