<p><strong> ἁγίοις</strong> should be taken (Mey.) as a substantive, not (De W.) with ἀδελφοῖς , in which case πιστοῖς , being already (as Mey.) presupposed in ἁγίοις , would be tame and superfluous: and <strong> καὶ πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἐν χριστῷ</strong> seems to be a specifying clause, ‘viz. to the &amp;c.:’ or perhaps added merely on account of the natural diplomatic character of an opening address. <strong> ἐν χρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> belongs closely to πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς or perhaps rather to ἀδελφοῖς alone, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:14">Philippians 1:14</span> ; no article before ἐν χριστῷ being wanted, because no distinction between these and any other kind of brethren is needed the idea ἀδελφὸς - ἐν - χριστῷ being familiar.
