	 ἁγίοις should be taken (Mey.) as a substantive, not (De W.) with ἀδελφοῖς , in which case πιστοῖς , being already (as Mey.) presupposed in ἁγίοις , would be tame and superfluous: and  καὶ πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἐν χριστῷ seems to be a specifying clause, ‘viz. to the &c.:’ or perhaps added merely on account of the natural diplomatic character of an opening address.  ἐν χρ  . belongs closely to πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς or perhaps rather to ἀδελφοῖς alone, as Philippians 1:14 ; no article before ἐν χριστῷ being wanted, because no distinction between these and any other kind of brethren is needed the idea ἀδελφὸς - ἐν - χριστῷ being familiar.
