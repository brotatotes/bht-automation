<b> 20.</b>]<b> through Him</b> (as the instrument, in Redemption as in Creation, see above ver. 16 end)<b> to reconcile again</b> (see note on Eph. ii. 16)<b> all things</b> (the universe: not to be limited to ‘<i>all intelligent beings,</i>’ or ‘<i>all men</i>,’ or ‘<i>the whole Church</i>:’ these<i> all things</i> are broken up below into terms which will admit of no such limitation. On the fact, see below)<b> to Him</b> (viz. to<b> Himself</b>, i.e. to God, Eph. ii. 16: the writer has in his mind two Persons, both expressed by<i> He</i> and<i> Him</i>, and to be understood from the context);<b> having made peace</b> (the subject is not Christ [as in Eph. i. 15], but the Father: He is the subject in the whole sentence since the beginning of ver. 19)<b> by means of the blood of</b> (genitive possessive, belonging to, figuratively, as being shed on)<b> His cross,—through Him</b> (emphatic repetition, to bring HIM, the Person of Christ, into its place of prominence again, after the interruption occasioned by the last clause),—<b>whether</b> (<i>all things</i> consist of) t<b> he things on the earth, or the things in the heavens.</b>—It has been a question, in what sense this reconciliation is predicated of the whole universe. Short of this meaning we cannot stop: we cannot hold with Erasmus and others, that it is a reconciliation of the<i> various portions of creation to one another</i>: nor, for the same reason, with Schleiermacher, understand that the elements to be reconciled are the<i> Jews</i> and<i> Gentiles</i>, who were at variance about earthly and heavenly things, and were to be set at one in reference to God. The Apostle’s meaning clearly is, that by the blood of Christ’s Cross, reconciliation with God has passed on<i> all creation as a whole</i>, including angelic as well as human beings, unreasoning and lifeless things, as well as organized and intelligent. Now this may be understood in the following ways: 1) creation may be strictly regarded in its entirety, and man’s offence viewed as having, by inducing impurity upon one portion of it, alienated the whole from God: and thus “<i>all things</i>” may be involved in our fall. Some support may seem to be derived for this by the undeniable fact, that<i> the whole of man’s world</i> is included in these consequences (see Rom. viii. 19 f.). But on the other side, we never find the<i> angelic beings</i> thus involved: nay, we are taught to regard them as our model in hallowing God’s name, realizing His kingdom, and doing His will (Matt. vi. 9, 10). And again the terms here used, “<i>whether... whether</i>..? would not suffer this: reconciliation is thus predicated of each portion<i> separately</i>. We are thus driven, there being no question about<i> the things on the earth</i>, to enquire, how<i> the things in the heavens</i> can be said to be reconciled by the blood of the Cross. And here again, 2) we may say that angelic, celestial creation was alienated from God because a portion of it fell from its purity: and, though there is no idea of the reconciliation extending to<i> that portion</i>, yet the whole, as a whole, may need thus reconciling, by the final driving into punishment of the fallen, and thus setting the faithful in perfect and undoubted unity with God. But to this I answer, a) that such reconciliation (?) though it might be a result of the coming of the Lord Jesus, yet could not in any way be effected by the<i> blood of His cross</i>: b) that we have no reason to think that the fall of some angels involved the rest in its consequences, or that angelic being is evolved from any root, as ours is from Adam: nay, in both these particulars, the very contrary is revealed. We must then seek our solution in some meaning which will apply to angelic beings in their essential nature, not as regards the sin of some among them. And as thus applied, no reconciliation must be thought of which shall resemble<i> ours</i> in its process—for Christ took not upon Him the seed of angels, nor paid any propitiatory penalty in the root of their nature, as including it in Himself. But, forasmuch as He is their Head as well as ours,—forasmuch as in Him they, as well as ourselves, live and move and have their being, it cannot be but that the great event in which He was glorified through suffering, should also bring them nearer to God, who subsist in Him in common with all creation. And at some such increase of blessedness does our Apostle seem to hint in Eph. iii. 10. That such increase might be described as a<i> reconciliation</i>, is manifest. In fact, every such nearer approach to Him may without violence to words be so described, in com-parison with that previous greater distance which now seems like alienation;—and in this case even more properly, as one of the consequences of that great propitiation whose first and plainest effect was to reconcile to God, in the literal sense, the things upon earth, polluted and hostile in consequence of man’s sin. So that our interpretation may be thus summed up: All creation subsists in Christ: all creation therefore is affected by His act of propitiation: sinful creation is, in the strictest sense,<i> reconciled</i>, from being at enmity: sinless creation, ever at a distance from his unapproachable purity, is lifted into nearer participation and higher glorification of Him, and is thus<i> reconciled</i>, though not in the strictest, yet in a very intelligible and allowable sense.
