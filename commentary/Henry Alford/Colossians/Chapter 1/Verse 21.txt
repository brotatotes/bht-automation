In Eph. ii. 12, it is decidedly objective, for such is the cast of the whole sentence there: in Eph. iv. 18 it describes the objective result, with regard to the life of God, of the subjective ‘being darkened in the understanding.’ It is better then here to follow usage, and interpret objectively— ‘alienated’—made aliens)<b> from God</b> (not from<i> the commonwealth of Israel</i>, nor from<i> the life of God</i>: for ‘God’ is the subject of the sentence),<b> and at enmity</b> (active or passive? ‘<i>hating God</i>,’ or ‘hated by God??

But here, where the<i> mind</i> and<i> wicked works</i> are mentioned, there exists no such necessity: the objective state of enmity is grounded in its subjective causes;—and the intelligent responsible being is contemplated in the whole sentence: see the appeal, “<i>provided that ye abide</i>,”&c., below.
