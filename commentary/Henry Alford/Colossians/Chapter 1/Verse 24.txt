<b> 24.]</b> Transition from the mention of himself to<i> his joy in his sufferings for the Church, and</i> (25–29)<i> for the great object of his ministry</i>:—all with a view to enhance the glory, and establish the paramount claim of Christ.—<b>I now</b> (refers to what he beforetime<i> became</i>—extending what he is about to say down to the present time—emphatic, of<i> time</i>, not transitional merely)<b> rejoice in</b> (as the state in which I am when I rejoice, and the element of my joy itself. Our own idiom recognizes the same compound reference)<b> my sufferings on your behalf</b> (not, ‘as a substitute for you;’ but strictly ‘for your advantage,’ that you may be confirmed in the faith by [not my example merely], but the glorification of Christ in my sufferings),<b> and am filling up the deficiencies</b> (plural, because the<i> afflictions</i> are thought of individually, not as a mass: those sufferings which are wanting)<b> of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh</b> (these words, ‘<i>in my flesh,</i>’ belong to the verb<i> am filling up</i>, not to “<i>the afflictions of Christ</i>:” for if it were so, the clause, “the afflictions of Christ in my body,” would contain in itself that which the whole clause asserts, and thus make it flat and tautological)<b> on behalf of His body, which is the Church</b> (the meaning being this: all the tribulations of Christ’s body are Christ’s tribulations. Whatever the whole Church has to suffer, even to the end, she suffers for her perfection in holiness and her completion in Him: and the tribulations of Christ will not be complete till the last pang shall have passed, and the last tear have been shed. Every suffering saint of God in every age and position is in fact filling up, in his place and degree, the<i> afflictions of Christ</i>, in his flesh, and on behalf of His body. Not a pang, not a tear is in vain. The Apostle, as standing out prominent among this suffering body, predicates this of himself especially: the<i> filling up</i>, to which we all contribute, was on his part so considerable, as to deserve the name of<i> a compensation</i> itself, for so the remarkable word implies, which we render<i> fill up</i>—I am contributing<i> afflictions</i> which one after another fill up the<i> defects</i>. Notice that of the SUFFERINGS of Christ not a word is said [see however 2 Cor. i. 5]: the context does not concern, nor does the word<i> afflictions</i> express, those meritorious sufferings which He bore in His person once for all, the measure of which was for ever filled by the one sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction, on the cross; He is here regarded as suffering with His suffering people, bearing them in Himself, and being as in Isa. lxiii. 9, “afflicted in all their affliction.” On other suggested interpretations, see in my Greek Test.):
