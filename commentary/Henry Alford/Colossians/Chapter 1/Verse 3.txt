In this Epistle, the plural and singular are too plainly distinguished to allow us to confuse them in translating: the plural pervading ch. 1., the singular ch. 2., and the two occurring together in ch.

The facts which he heard, not the fact of his hearing, were the ground of his thanksgiving)  your faith in (not τὴν ἐν : the immediate element of their faith, not its distinctive character, is the point brought out)  Christ Jesus, and the love which ye have (these words, dwelling on the fact as reported to him, carry more affectionate commendation than would merely the article τήν of the rec.)  towards all the saints ,
