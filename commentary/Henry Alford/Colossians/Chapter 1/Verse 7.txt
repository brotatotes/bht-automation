 7 .]  as (scil, ἐν ἀληθείᾳ ‘in which truth’)  ye learnt from Epaphras (mentioned again ch. Col 4:12 as of Colossæ, and Philemon 1:23 , as then a fellow-prisoner with the Apostle. The name  may be (hardly as Conyb.,  is ) identical with Epaphroditus. A person of this latter name is mentioned, Philippians 2:25 , as sent by St. Paul to the church at Philippi, and ib. Philippians 4:18 , as having previously brought to him offerings from that church. There is no positive reason disproving their identity: but probability is against it)  our (not ‘  my ’)  beloved fellow-servant (of Christ, Philippians 1:1 ; not necessarily ‘  fellow-bondsman ,’ as Conyb.: συναιχμάλωτος , Phm 1:23 ),  who is a minister of Christ faithful on our behalf (the stress of the predicatory sentence is on πιστὸς ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν , which ought therefore in the translation not to be sundered.

This love of the Colossians he lays stress on, as a ground for thankfulness, a fruit of the hope laid up for them, as being that side of their Christian character where he had no fault (or least fault, see ch. Col 3:12-14 ) to find with them. He now proceeds, gently and delicately at first, to touch on matters needing correction).
