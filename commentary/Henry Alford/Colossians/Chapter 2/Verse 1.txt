<p><strong> 1</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (follows on, and justifies, while it exemplifies, <strong> ἀγων</strong> ιζόμενος , ch. Col 1:29 ) <strong> I would have you know how great</strong> (emphatic; not only that I have an ἀγών , but how great it is. The word is unusual, see reff.) <strong> a conflict</strong> (of anxiety and prayer, cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</span> ; his present imprisoned state necessitates this reference here: he could not be in conflict with the false teachers) <strong> I have on behalf of you and those in Laodicea</strong> (who probably were in the same danger of being led astray, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:16">Colossians 4:16</span> ; on Laodicea, see Prolegg. to Apocalypse, § iii. 13), <strong> and</strong> (it would not appear on merely grammatical grounds, whether this καί generalizes from the two specific instances, you and those in Laodicea, to the genus, including those two in the ὅσοι (see the two first reff., in the second of which however ἄλλα is added) or adds another category to the two which have preceded, as in the third ref., Μακεδόνες καὶ … καὶ … καὶ ὅσοι τῆς Θρηΐκης τὴν παραλίην νέμονται . This must be decided on other grounds, viz. those furnished by the context: see below) ( <strong> for</strong> ) <strong> as many as have not seen</strong> (“the form ἑώρακαν is decidedly Alexandrian.… The ‘sonstige Gebrauch Pauli’ urged against it by Mey. is imaginary, as the third person plural does not elsewhere occur in St. Paul’s Epistles.” Ellicott) <strong> my face in the flesh</strong> (my corporal presence: <strong> ἐν σαρκί</strong> must not be joined with the verb, as Chrys. seems to have done, who adds, δείκνυσιν ἐνταῦθα , ὅτι ἑώρων συνεχῶς ἐν πνεύματι ; for in Col 2:5 the σαρκί is attached to the Apostle. But it is not necessary nor natural, with Estius, to see any ‘ ταπείνωσις , ut intelligant pluris faciendam esse præsentiam spiritus quam carnis.’ Rather is the tendency of this verse the other way to exalt the importance of the Apostle’s bodily presence with a church, if its defect caused him such anxiety), <strong> that</strong> (object of the ἀγών ) <strong> their hearts</strong> (these are the words on which the interpretation of the former καὶ ὅσοι must turn. If αὐτῶν apply to a separate class of persons, who had not seen him, whereas the Colossians and Laodiceans <em> had</em> , how are we to bring them into the ἀγών ? In Col 2:4 the third person αὐτῶν becomes ὑμᾶς . Where is the link, on this hypothesis, that binds them together? The sentence will stand thus: “I am anxious for you who have seen me, and for others who have not: for these last, that &amp;c. &amp;c. This I say that no man may deceive <em> you</em> .” What logical deduction can there be, from the circumstances of <em> others</em> , to <em> theirs</em> , unless they are included in the fact predicated of those others? in a word, unless the ὅσοι above include the Colossians and Laodiceans? Thus the αὐτῶν extends to the whole category of those who had never seen him, and the ὑμας of Col 2:4 singles them specially out from among this category for special exhortation and warning. This seeming to be the only logical interpretation of the αὐτῶν and ὑμᾶς , the καί above must be ruled accordingly, to be not copulative but generalizing: see there) <strong> may be confirmed</strong> (see reff. It can hardly be doubted here, where he is treating, not of troubles and persecutions, but of being shaken from the faith, that the word, so manifold in its bearings, and so difficult to express in English, carries with it the meaning of strengthening, not of comforting merely. If we could preserve in ‘comfort’ the trace of its derivation from ‘confortari,’ it might answer here: but in our present usage, it does not convey any idea of strengthening. This I still hold against Ellicott), <strong> they being knit together</strong> (so E. V. well: not ‘ <em> instructi</em> ,’ as vulg. On the construction, see reff. and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:18">Ephesians 3:18</span> ; Eph 4:2 ) <strong> in love</strong> (the bond of perfectness as of union: disruption being necessarily consequent on false doctrine, their being knit together in love would be a safeguard against it. Love is thus the <em> element</em> of the συμβιβασθῆναι ) <strong> and</strong> (besides the elementary unity) <strong> unto</strong> (as the <em> object</em> of the συμβ .) <strong> all</strong> (the) <strong> richness of the full assurance</strong> (reff. see also Luk 1:1 ) <strong> of the</strong> (Christian) <strong> understanding</strong> (the accumulated substantives shew us generally the Apostle’s anxious desire for a special reason to impress the importance of the matter on them. οἶδά , φησιν , ὅτι πιστεύετε , ἀλλὰ πληροφορηθῆναι ὑμᾶς βούλομαι , οὐκ εἰς τὸν πλοῦτον μόνον , ἀλλ ʼ εἰς πάντα τὸν πλοῦτον , ἵνα καὶ ἐν πᾶσι καὶ ἐπιτεταμένως πεπληροφορημένοι ἦτε , Chrys.), <strong> unto</strong> (parallel with the former, and explaining πᾶν τὸ πλ . τ . πληρ . τῆς συν . by ἐπίγν . τοῦ μ . τ . θεοῦ ) <strong> the thorough-knowledge</strong> (on ἐπίγνωσις and γνῶσις , here clearly distinguished, see on ch. Col 1:9 ) <strong> of the mystery of God</strong> (the additions here found in the rec. and elsewhere seem to be owing to the common practice of annotating on the divine name to specify to which Person it belongs. Thus <strong> τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> having been original, πατρός was placed against it by some, χριστοῦ or τοῦ χριστοῦ by others: and then these found their way into the text in various combinations, some of which from their difficulty gave rise again to alterations, as may be seen in various readings. The reading in text, as accounting for all the rest, has been adopted by Griesb., Scholz, Tischdf. (edn. 2), Olsh., De Wette, al.: τοῦ θεοῦ χριστοῦ by Mey. and Steiger. This latter is also edited, in pursuance of his plan, by Lachm. The shorter reading was by that plan excluded from his present text, as not coming before his notice. In the present digest, the principal differing readings are printed in the same type as that in the text, because I have been utterly unable to fix the reading on any <em> external</em> authority, and am compelled to take refuge in that which appears to have been the origin of the rest. One thing is clear, that τοῦ θεοῦ χριστοῦ , which Ellicott adopts ‘with some confidence,’ is simply one among many glosses, of which it is impossible to say that any has overwhelming authority. Such expressions were not corrected ordinarily by <em> omission</em> of any words, but constantly by supplementing them in various ways): <strong> in which</strong> (mystery, as Grot., Beng., Mey., De W., al. (Bisping well remarks, that the two in fact run into one, as Christ is Himself the μυστήριον τοῦ θεοῦ . He might have referred to ch. Col 1:27 and 1Ti 3:16 ) not ‘ <em> in whom</em> ,’ as E. V. (but ‘wherein’ in marg.), and so, understanding ‘whom’ of <em> Christ</em> , Chrys., Thdrt., al.: for it is unnatural to turn aside from the main subject of the sentence, the μυστήριον , and make this relative clause epexegetic of the dependent genitive merely. To this view the term ἀπόκρυχφος also testifies: see below) <strong> are all the secret</strong> (the ordinary rendering is, to make ἀπόκρυφοι the predicate after εἰσίν : ‘ <em> in which are all</em> , &amp;c. <em> hidden</em> .’ The objection to this is, that it is contrary to fact: the treasures are not hidden, but revealed. The meaning given by Bähr, B.-Crus., and Robinson (Lex.), ‘laid up,’ lying concealed, ἀποκείμενα , does not belong to the word, nor is either of the places in the canonical LXX (reff.) an example of it. The rendering which I have adopted is that of Meyer, and I am persuaded on consideration that it is not only the only logical but the only grammatical one also. The ordinary one would require ἀποκεκρυμμένοι , or with ἀπόκρυφοι , a different arrangement of the words ἐν ᾧ ἀπόκρυφοί εἰσιν , or ἐν ᾧ εἰσὶν ἀπόκρυφοι . The objection, that for our rendering οἱ ἀπόκρυφοι would be required (Bähr), shews ignorance of the logic of such usage. Where the whole subject is covered by the extent of the predicate, the latter, even though separated by an intervening clause from the former, does not <em> require</em> the specification by the article. It <em> may</em> have it, but need not. Thus if all the men in a fortress were Athenians, I <em> might</em> say 1) οἱ ἄνδρες ἐν τούτῳ ἐν τῷ τείχει οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι : but I might also say 2) of οἱ ἄνδρες ἐν τούτῳ ἐν τῷ τείχει Ἀθηναῖοι . If however, part of the men were Platæans, I <em> must</em> use 1), and could not use 2). Here, it is not asserted that ‘all the treasures, &amp;c. which are secret, are contained in the mystery,’ others being implied which are not secret, but the implication is the other way: ‘the treasures, &amp;c. are all secret, and all contained in the mystery.’ Ellicott’s rendering of ἀπόκρυφοι as an adverbial predicate, ‘hiddenly,’ is quite admissible, and tallies better with the classification and nomenclature of predicates, which he has adopted from Donaldson: but I question whether the rendering given above be not both more simple and more grammatical) <strong> treasures</strong> (see Plato, Phileb. p. 15 e, ὥς τινα σοφίας εὑρηκὼς θησαυρόν : Xen. Mem. iv. 2. 9, ἄγαμαί σου διότι οὐκ ἀργυρίου κ . χρυσίου προείλου θησαυροὺς κεκτῆσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ σοφίας : also ib. i. 7. 14) <strong> of wisdom and knowledge</strong> ( σοφ ., the general, γνῶσις , the particular; see note on Eph 1:8 ).</p>
