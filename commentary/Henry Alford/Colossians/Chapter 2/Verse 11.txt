This body is put off in baptism, the sign and seal of the new life. “When ethically circumcised, i.e. translated by<i> change of heart</i> out of the state of sin into that of the Christian life of faith, we have no more the<i> body of the flesh</i>: for the body, which we bear, is disarrayed of its sinful<i> flesh as such</i>, as far as regards its sinful quality: we are no more<i> in the flesh</i> as before, when lust<i> wrought in our members</i> [Rom. vii. 5, see ver. 23]; we are no more ‘<i>carnal, sold under sin</i>’ [Rom. vii. 14], and<i> walk no more according to the flesh, but in newness of spirit</i> [Rom. vii. 6], so that our members are<i> instruments of righteousness unto God</i> [Rom. vi. 13].

Two other interpretations are given: 1) that in which Christ is regarded as the<i> circumciser</i>: so Theophylact says, “Christ circumcises in baptism, stripping off from us our former life.” 2) that in which Christ is the<i> circumcised</i>— “the circumcision to which Christ submitted Himself for man.” The objection to both is, that they introduce irrelevant elements into the context.<i> The circumcision which Christ works</i> would not naturally be followed by “<i>having been buried with Him</i>,” i. e,<i> union with Him</i>:<i> that which was wrought on Him</i> might be thus followed, but would not come in naturally in a passage which describes, not the universal efficacy of the rite once for all performed on Him, but the actual undergoing of it in a spiritual sense, by each one of us):
