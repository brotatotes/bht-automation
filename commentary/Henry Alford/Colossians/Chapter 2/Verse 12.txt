<b> 12.</b>] (goes on to connect this still more closely with the person of Christ,—as if it had been said, ‘in the circumcision of Christ, to whom you were united,’&c.)—<b>having been buried together</b> (i. e. ‘when you were buried’)<b> with Him in your baptism</b> (the new life being begun at baptism,—an image familiar alike to Jews and Christians,—the process itself of baptism is regarded as the burial of the former life: originally, perhaps, owing to the practice of immersion, which would most naturally give rise to the idea: but to maintain from such a circumstance that immersion is<i> necessary</i> in baptism, is surely the merest trifling, and a resuscitation of the very ceremonial spirit which the Apostle here is arguing against. As reasonably might it be argued, from the metaphor of “<i>putting off</i>” being used here, that nakedness was an essential in that sacrament. The things represented by both figures belong to the essentials of the Christian life: the minor details of the sacrament which corresponded to them, may in different ages or climates be varied; but the spiritual figures remain. At the same time, if circumstances concurred,—e. g. a climate where the former practice was always safe, and a part of the world, or time of life, where the latter would be no shock to decency,—there can be no question that the external proprieties of baptism ought to be complied with. And on this principle the baptismal services of the Church of England are constructed);<b> wherein</b> (i. e. in baptism: not, as most expositors, ‘<i>in whom</i>,’ i.e. Christ)<b> ye were also raised again with Him</b> (not your material, but your spiritual resurrection is in the foreground: it is bound on, it is true, to<i> His</i> material resurrection, and brings with it in the background,<i> yours</i>: but in the spiritual, the material is included and taken for granted, as usual in Seripture)<b> through</b> (by means of: the mediate, not the efficient cause; the hand which held on, not the plank that saved)<b> your</b> (or, the)<b> faith in the operation of God</b> (in Christ—that mighty power by which the Father raised Him, compare Rom. viii. 11; Eph. i. 20),<b> who raised Him from the dead</b> ( “for believing in the power of God we wait for the resurrection, having as a pledge of it the resurrection of Christ our Lord.” Theodoret. But there is very much more asserted than the mere<i> waiting for the resurrection</i>—the power of God in raising the dead to life is one and the same in our Lord and in us—the physical power exerted in Him is not only a pledge of the same physical power to be exerted in us, but a condition and assurance of a spiritual power already exerted in us, whereby we are in spirit risen with Christ, the physical resurrection being included and taken for granted in that other and greater one).
