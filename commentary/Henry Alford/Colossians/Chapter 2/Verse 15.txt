<b> 15.]</b> The utmost care must be taken to interpret this verse according to the requirements of grammar and of the context. The<i> first</i> seems to me to necessitate the rendering, not, as the great majority of Commentators, ‘<i>having spoiled</i>,’ a meaning unexampled, and precluded by the plain usage, by the Apostle himself, a few verses below, ch. iii. 9, of the same word,—but ‘<i>having stripped off</i>,’ divested himself of.’ Then the second must guide us to the meaning of<b> the principalities and the powers</b>. Most Commentators have at once assumed these to be tho<i> infernal powers</i>, or<i> evil angels</i>: relying on Eph. vi. 12, where undoubtedly such is the specific reference of these general terms. But the terms<i> being general</i>, such specific reference must be determined by the context of each passage,—or, indeed, there may be no such specific re-ference at all, but they may be used in their fullest general sense. Now the words have occurred before in this very passage, ver. 10, where Christ is exalted as<i> the head of all principality and power</i>: and it is hardly possible to avoid connecting our present expression with that, seeing that in “<b>the</b><i> principalities and</i><b> the</b><i> powers</i>,” the articles seem to contain a manifest reference to it. Now, what is the context? Is it in any way relevant to the fact of the law being superseded by God in the great Sacrifice of the atonement, to say that He, in that act (or, according to others, Christ in that act), spoiled and triumphed over the<i> infernal potentates</i>? Or would the following “<i>therefore</i>” deduce any legitimate inference from such a fact? But, suppose the matter to stand in this way. The law was “<i>ministered by angels</i>” (Gal. iii, 19: see Acts vii. 53), “<i>the word spoken by angels</i>” (Heb. ii, 2:—<i>they</i> were the promulgators of the “<i>handwriting in ordinances</i>.” In that promulgation of theirs, God was pleased to reveal Himself of old. That writing, that investiture, so to speak, of God, was first wiped out, soiled and rendered worthless, and then nailed to the Cross—abrogated and suspended there. Thus God<i> stripped off the principalities and the powers</i>—divested Himself of, put off from Himself, that<i> ministration of angels</i>, manifesting Himself henceforward without a veil in the exalted Person of Jesus. And the act of triumph, by which God has for ever subjected all principality and power to Christ, and made Him to be the only Head of His people, in whom they are complete, was that sacrifice, whereby all the law was accomplished. In that, the<i> principalities and powers</i> were all subjected to Christ, all plainly declared to be powerless as regards His work and His people, and triumphed over by Him, see Phil. ii. 8, 9: Eph. i. 20, 21. No difficulty need be created, on this explanation, by the objection, that thus more prominence would be given to angelic agency in the law than was really the fact: the answer is, that the prominence which is given, is owing to the errors of the false teachers, who had evidently<i> associated the Jewish observances</i> in some way<i> with the worship of angels</i>: St. Paul’s argument will go only to this, that whatever part the angelic powers may have<i> had</i>, or be sup-posed to have had, in the previous dispensation, all such interposition was now entirely at an end, that dispensation itself being once for all antiquated and put away. Render then,—<b>Putting off</b> (by the absence of a copula, the vigour of the sentence is increased. The participle is contemporary with “<i>hath taken out of the way</i>” above, and thus must not be rendered<i> ‘having</i> put off’)<b> the governments and powers</b> (before spoken of, ver. 10, and ch. i. 16: see above),<b> He</b> (God, who is the subject throughout: see also ch. iii, 3:—not<i> Christ</i>, which would awkwardly introduce two subjects into the sentence)<b> exhibited them</b> (as completely subjected to Christ;—not only put them away from Himself, but shewed them as placed under Christ)<b> in</b> (element in<i> which he made a show of them</i>)<b> openness</b> (of speech; declaring and revealing by the Cross that there is none other but Christ the Head<i> of all principality and power</i>. Observe, that “in openness” is equivalent in English to<b> openly</b>),<b> triumphing over them</b> (as in 2 Cor. ii. 14,<i> we</i> are said [see note there] to be led captive in Christ’s triumph, our real victory being our defeat by Him,—so here the principalities and powers, which are next above us in those ranks of being which are all subjected to and summed up in Him)<b> in Him</b> (Christ: not, as A.V., ‘<i>in it</i>,’ viz.<i> the cross</i>, which gives a very feeble meaning after the declaration that God “<i>raised Him</i>,” and “<i>quickened us together with Him</i>” above). 16–23.]<i> More specific warning against false teachers</i> (see summary on ver. 1),<i> and that first</i> (vv. 16, 17)<i> with reference to legal observances and abstinence.</i>
