<b> 17.</b>]<b> which</b> (the relative may refer either to the aggregate of the observances mentioned, or to the<i> last</i> mentioned, i.e. the Sabbath. Or it may refer to all)<b> is</b> (or,<b> are</b>; not,<i> ‘was</i>:’ he speaks of them in their nature, abstractedly)<b> a shadow of things to come</b> (the blessings of the Christian covenant: these are the substance, and the Jewish ordinances the mere type or resemblance, as the shadow is of the living man);<b> but the body</b> (the substance, of which the other is the shadow)<b> belongs to Christ</b> (i. e. the substantial blessings, which those legal observances typified, are attached to, brought in by, found in union with, Christ: see on the whole figure, Heb. viii. 5; x. 1). We may observe, that if the ordinance of the Sabbath had been,<i> in any form</i>, of lasting obligation on the Christian church, it would have been quite impossible for the Apostle to have spoken thus. The fact of an obligatory rest of one day, whether the seventh or the first, would have been directly in the teeth of his assertion here: the holding of such would have been still to retain the shadow, while we possess the substance. And no answer ean be given to this by the transparent special-pleading, that he is speaking only of that which was<i> Jewish</i> in such observances: the whole argument being general, and the axiom of ver. 17 universally applicable.
