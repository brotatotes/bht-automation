<p><strong> 17</strong> .] <strong> which</strong> (if the sing. be read, the relative may refer either to the aggregate of the observances mentioned, or to the <em> last</em> mentioned, i.e. the Sabbath. Or it may be singular by attraction, and refer to all, just as if it were plural, see Mat 12:4 ) <strong> is</strong> (or as in rec. <em> are</em> : not, ‘ <em> was</em> ,’ or <em> were</em> : he speaks of them in their nature, abstractedly) a shadow (not, a <em> sketch</em> , σκιαγραφία or - φημα , which meaning is precluded by the term opposed being σῶμα , not the finished picture, but literally the <em> shadow</em> : see below) <strong> of things to come</strong> (the blessings of the Christian covenant: these are the substance, and the Jewish ordinances the mere type or resemblance, as the shadow is of the living man. But we must not, as Mey., press the figure so far as to imagine the shadow to be cast back by the τὰ μέλλοντα going before (cf. also Thdrt., somewhat differently, προλαμβάνει δὲ ἡ σκιὰ τὸ σῶμα ἀνίσχοντος τοῦ φωτός · ὡς εἶναι σκιὰν μὲν τὸν νόμον , σῶμα δὲ τὴν χάριν , φῶς δὲ τὸν δεσπότην χριστόν ): nor with the same Commentator, interpret τῶν μελλ . of the <em> yet future</em> blessings of the state following the παρουσία , for which ἐστιν (see above) gives no ground. Nor again must we imagine that the <em> obscurity</em> (Suicer, al.) of the Jewish dispensation is alluded to, there being no subjective comparison instituted between the two, only their objective relation stated); <strong> but the body</strong> (the substance, of which the other is the shadow) <strong> belongs to Christ</strong> (i.e. the substantial blessings, which those legal observances typified, are attached to, brought in by, found in union with, Christ: see on the whole figure <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:5">Hebrews 8:5</span> ; Heb 10:1 ). We may observe, that if the ordinance of the Sabbath had been, <em> in any form</em> , of lasting obligation on the Christian Church, it would have been quite impossible for the Apostle to have spoken thus. The fact of an obligatory rest of one day, whether the seventh or the first, would have been directly in the teeth of his assertion here: the holding of such would have been still to retain the shadow, while we possess the substance. And no answer can be given to this by the transparent special-pleading, that he is speaking only of that which was <em> Jewish</em> in such observances; the whole argument being general, and the axiom of Col 2:17 universally applicable.

<p>I cannot see that Ellicott in loc. has at all invalidated this. To hold, as he does, that the sabbath was a σκιά of <em> the Lord’s day</em> , is surely to fall into the same error as we find in the title of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:0">1 Corinthians 10:0</span> in our authorized bibles, ‘The Jewish Sacraments were types of ours.’ The antitype is not to be found in another and a higher type, but in the eternal verity which both shadow forth. An extraordinary punctuation of this verse was proposed by some mentioned by Chrys.: οἱ μὲν οὖν τοῦτο στίζουσι , τὸ δὲ σῶμα , χριστοῦ . ἡ δὲ ἀλήθεια ἐπὶ χριστοῦ γέγονεν · οἱ δὲ , τὸ δὲ σῶμα χριστοῦ μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς καταβραβευέτω · and Aug. ep. 149 (59). 27, vol. ii. p. 841 f., has ‘corpus autem Christi nemo vos convincat. Turpe est, inquit … ut cum sitis corpus Christi, seducamini umbris.’ No wonder that the same father should confess of the passage, ‘nec ego sine caligine intelligo.’</p>
