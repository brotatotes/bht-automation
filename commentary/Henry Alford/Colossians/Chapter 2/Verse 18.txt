If therefore any be found employed in this covert idolatry, let him be accursed, inasmuch as he is a denier of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and a pervert to idolatry.” See, for an account of subsequent legends and visions of the neighbourhood, Conybeare and Howson, Life of St. Paul, ii. p. 480, note, edn. 2),<b> insisting on things which he hath seen</b> (an inhabitant of the realm of sight, not of faith: as Augustine above, “<i>falling into a longing for curious visions</i>.”—This insisting on his own
