The true honouring of the angels and saints is after all in every case an honouring of Christ their Head”? On this I may remark 1) that the word<i> ‘honouring’</i> is simply disingenuous, there being no question of honouring, but of worship in the strict sense. 2) That whatever a Commentator may say in his study, and Romanists may assert when convenient to them, the honour and worship actually and practically paid by them to angels and saints does by very far exceed that paid to Christ their Head. Throughout Papal Europe, the worship of Christ among the body of the middle and lower orders is fast becoming obliterated, and supplanted by that of His Mother).
