<b> 2.</b>]<b> that</b> (object of the<i> contention</i>)<b> their hearts may be confirmed</b> (it can hardly be doubted here, where he is treating, not of troubles and persecutions, but of being shaken from the faith, that the word, so manifold in its bearings, and so difficult to express in English, carries with it the meaning of strengthening, not of comforting merely. If we could preserve in ‘comfort’ the trace of its derivation from the Latin<i> ‘confortari</i>,’ it might answer here: but in our present usage, it does not convey any idea of strengthening),<b> they being</b><b> knit together in love</b> (the bond of perfectness, as of union: disruption being necessarily consequent on false doctrine, their being knit together in love would be a safeguard against it. Love is thus the<i> element</i> of the<i> being knit together</i>),<b> and</b> (besides the elementary unity)<b> unto</b> (as the<i> object</i> of the<i> knitting together</i>),<b> all the riches of the full assurance of the</b> (Christian)<b> understanding</b> (the accumulated substantives shew us generally the Apostle’s anxious desire for a special reason to impress the importance of the matter on them. “I know,” he says, “that you believe, but I wish you to be completed, not only unto the riches, but to<i> all</i> the riches, that ye may be complete in all things and fully.” Chrysostom),<b> unto</b> (parallel with the former, and explaining<i> all the riches</i>, &c., by<i> the thorough knowledge</i>, &c.)<b> the thorough knowledge</b> (on<i> thorough knowledge</i> and<i> knowledge</i>, here clearly distinguished, see on ch, i. 9)<b> of the mystery of God</b> (the additions here found in the received text, and in other authorities, seem to be owing to the common practice in the MSS., of annotating in the margin on the divine name, to specify to which Person it belongs. Thus it would seem likely that,<b> of God</b> having been all that was in the original, “<i>the Father</i>” was placed against it by some, “<i>Christ</i>” or “<i>the Christ</i>” by others: and then these found their way into the text in various combinations, some of which from their difficulty gave rise again to alterations. The reading in the text, as accounting for all the rest, has been adopted by Griesbach, Scholz, Tischendorf, Olshausen, De Wette, and others):<b> in which</b> (mystery, which is in fact Christ: see ch. i, 27; 1 Tim. iii. 16)<b> are all the hidden</b> (the ordinary rendering is, to make hidden the predicate after are: ‘<i>in which</i> (or,<i> whom</i>)<i> are all the treasures&c. hidden,</i>’ The objection to this is, that it is contrary to fact: the treasures are not hidden, but revealed. The rendering which I have adopted is that of Meyer, and I am persuaded on consideration that it is not only the only logical but the only grammatical one also. See the subject discussed in my Greek Test.)<b> treasures of wisdom and knowledge</b> (<b>wisdom</b>, the general,<b> knowledge</b>, the particular; see note on Eph. i. 8).
