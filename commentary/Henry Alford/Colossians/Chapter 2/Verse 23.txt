<b> 23</b>.]<b> Such as</b> (this defining term brings us from the general objective, human doctrines and systems, to the specific subjective, the particular sort of doctrines and systems which they were following: q.d., ‘and that, such sort of<i> commandments and teachings as</i>…’)<b> are possessed of</b> ( ‘enjoy,’ as we say)<b> a reputation indeed of wisdom in</b> (element of its repute)<b> voluntary worship</b> (the<i> worship</i> was mainly that of<i> angels</i>, see above, ver. 18: but the generality of the expression here may take in other voluntary extravagancies of worship also)<b> and humility</b> (see ver. 18),<b> and not sparing of the body, not in any honour</b> [<b>of it</b>] (on the interpretations, see below. The same word is used by St. Paul of honour or respect bestowed on the body, in 1 Cor. xii. 23, 24: of honourable conduct in matters relating to the body, 1 Thess. iv. 4: and such is the meaning I would assign to it here—these<i> ordinances</i> have the repute of wisdom for, &c., and for unsparingness of the body, not in any real honour done to it—its true honour being, dedication to the Lord, 1 Cor. vi. 18),<b> to the satiating of the flesh</b>. I connect these words not with the preceding clause, but with “a<i> re ye prescribed to</i>” above—<i>why are ye suffering yourselves to be thus prescribed to</i> [in the strain “<i>touch not</i>, &c.” according to, &c., which are, &c.],<i> and all for the satisfaction of the flesh</i>,—for the following out of a<i> teaching</i>, the ground of which is the<i> puffed up according to the fleshly mind</i>, ver. 18? Then after this follow most naturally the exhortations of the next chapter; they are not to seek the<i> satisfying of the flesh—not to mind earthly things</i>, but “<i>make dead their members which were upon earth</i>.”—The other renderings, and my objections to them, see in my Greek Test.
