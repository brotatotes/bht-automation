<b> 16</b>.] “Having exhorted them to be thankful, he now shews them the way.” Chry-sostom. This thankfulness to God will shew itself in the rich indwelling in you and outflowing from you of the word of Christ, be it in mutual edifying converse, or in actual songs of praise.<b> Let Christ’s word</b> (the Gospel: genitive subjective; the word which is His—He spoke it, inspired it, and gives it power)<b> dwell in you</b> (not ‘among you.’ St. Paul’s usage seems to require that the indwelling should be individual and personal. Still we may say that the “<i>you</i>” need not he<i> restricted</i> to individual Christians; it may well mean the whole community—you, as a church. The word dwelling in them richly, many would arise to speak it to edification, and many would be moved to the utterance of praise)<b> richly</b> (i. e. in abundance and fulness, so as to lead to the following results);<b> in all wisdom</b> (these words seem to be better taken with the following than with the foregoing. For 1) ch. i. 28 already gives us these two same participles, “<i>teaching</i> and<i> admonishing</i>,” joined with “in all wisdom.” 2) The verb “<i>dwell</i>” has already its qualifying adverb “<i>richly</i>” emphatically placed at the end of the sentence. 3) The two following clauses will thus correspond— “<i>in all wisdom teaching</i>”.... “<i>in grace singing</i>.” The usual arrangement has been, with A.V., to join them with the preceding)<b> teaching and warning</b> (see on ch. i. 28)<b> each other</b> (see on ver. 13)<b> in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs</b> (on the meaning of the words, see notes, Eph. v. 19. Meyer’s note here is important: “Notice moreover that Paul here also [see on Eph. as above] is not speaking of ‘divine service’ Properly. so called, for this teaching and admonishing is required of his<i> readers generally</i> and mutually, and as a proof of their rich possession of the word of Christ: but of the communication of the religious life among one another (e. g. at meals, at the Agape (love-feasts), and other meetings, in their family circles,&.), wherein spiritual influence caused the mouth to overflow with the fulness of the heart, and gave utterance to brotherly instruction and reproof in the higher form of psalms, &c.; perhaps in songs already known,—or extemporized, according to the peculiarity and productivity of each man’s spiritual gift: per-haps sung by individuals alone [which would especially be the case when they were extemporized], or in chorus, or in the form of antiphonal song.” Religious singing was common in the ancient church, independently of ‘divine service’ properly so called. Eusebius testifies to the existence of a collection of rhythmical songs which were composed from the first by Christians. On singing at the Agape, Tertullian says, “After water for the hands, and lights, have been brought, as each is able, from the Holy Scriptures or his own genius, he is encouraged to sing publicly to God”),<b> in</b> [<b>the</b>]<b> Grace</b> (<i>the</i> grace—of Christ. The article marks ‘the grace,’ which is yours by God’s indwelling Spirit)<b> singing in your hearts to God</b> (this clause has generally been understood as qualifying the former. But such a view is manifestly wrong. That former spoke of their teaching and warning one another in effusions of the spirit which took the form of psalms, &c.: in other words, dealt with their intercourse<i> with one another</i>; this on the other hand deals with their own private intercourse<i> with God</i>."The second participle is co-ordinate with the former, not subordinate to it. The mistake has partly arisen from imagining that the former clause related to public worship, in its external form: and then this one was understood to enforce the genuine heartfelt expression of the same. But this not being so, that which is founded on it falls with it. The singing to God is an analogous expression to that in 1 Cor. xiv. 28,— “Let him speak...<i> to God</i>.” So the words “<i>in your hearts</i>” describe the method of uttering this praise, viz. by the thoughts only: “<i>to God</i>” designates to whom it is to be addressed,—not, as before, to one another, but to God).<b></b>
