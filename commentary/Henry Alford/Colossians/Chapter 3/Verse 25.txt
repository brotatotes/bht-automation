 25 .] This verse seems best to be taken as addressed to the slaves by way of encouragement to regard Christ as their Master and serve Him seeing that all their wrongs in this world, if they leave them in His hands, will be in due time righted by Him, the just judge, with whom there is no respect of persons.  For he that doeth wrong shall receive (see, as on the whole, Eph 6:8 )  that which he did wrongfully (the tense is changed because in  ἀδικῶν he is speaking of present practice in  ἠδίκησεν , he has transferred the scene to the day of the Lord, and the wrong is one of past time),  and there is not respect of persons (= εἴτε δοῦλος εἴτε ἐλεύθερος , Eph 6:8 ). At His tribunal, every one, without regard to rank or wealth, shall receive the deeds done in the body. So that in your Christian uprightness and conscientiousness you need not fear that you shall be in the end overborne by the superior power of your masters: there is A judge who will defend and right you: ἐστὶ δικαιοκρίτης ὃς οὐκ οἶδε δούλου κ . δεσπότου διαφοράν , ἀλλὰ δικαίαν εἰσφέρει τὴν ψῆφον , Thdrt. Some, as Thl., Beng., al., suppose the verse spoken  with reference to the slaves; but οὐκ ἔστιν προσωπολημψία is against this, unless we accept Bengel’s far-fetched explanation of it: “tenues sæpe putant, sibi propter tenuitatem ipsorum esse parcendum.”
