That being made partakers with Christ’s death, cut you loose from the<i> things on the earth</i>: see Rom. vi. 4–7),<b> and your life</b> (that resurrection life, which is “your real and true life.” The only real life of the Christian is his resurrection life in and with Christ. Compare Rom, viii. 19–23)<b> is hidden</b> ( “<i>is not yet manifested</i>,” 1 John iii. 2: is laid up, to be manifested hereafter: that such is the sense, the next verse seems plainly to shew)<b> with Christ</b> (who is also Himself hidden at present from us, who wait for His<i> revelation</i> [1 Cor. i. 7, 2 Thess. i. 7. 1 Pet. i. 7, 13; iv. 13], which be also ours, see ver. 4 and Rom. viii. 19)<b> in God</b> (with Christ who is “<i>in the bosom of the Fathe</i> r;”—it is in Him, as in a great depth, that all things concealed are hidden, and He brings them out as seems good to Him).
