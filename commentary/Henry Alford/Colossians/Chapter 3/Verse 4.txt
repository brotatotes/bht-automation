<b> 4.</b>]<b> When Christ is manifested</b> (shall emerge from his present state of hidden-ness, and be personally revealed),<b> who is our</b> (no emphasis—our applies to Christians generally—see on “<i>ye also</i>” below)<b> life</b> (Christ is personally Himself that life, and we possess it only by union with Him and His resurrection: see John xiv. 19),<b> then shall ye also</b> (<i>also</i> takes out the special from the general—ye, as well as and among, other Christians)<b> with Him be manifested in glory</b> (see on the whole, the parallel 1 John iii. 2. Though the<i> completed life of the resurrection</i> seems so plainly pointed out by this last verse as the sense to be given to “our life,” this has not been seen by many Commentators, who hold it to be<i> ethical</i>; hidden, inasmuch as inward and spiritual, Rom. ii, 29, and ideal: or, inasmuch as it is unseen by the world. The root of the mistake has been the want of a sufficiently comprehensive view of that resurrection life of ours which is now hidden with Christ. It includes in itself both spiritual, ethical, and corporeal: and the realization of it as far as possible, here, is the sum of the Christian’s most earnest endeavours: but the life itself, in its full manifestation, is that perfection of body, soul, and spirit, in which we shall be manifested with Him at His appearing. Theodoret says well: “For when He rose, we all rose with Him: but we see not yet the end of the matter. The mystery of our resurrection is hidden in Him”).
