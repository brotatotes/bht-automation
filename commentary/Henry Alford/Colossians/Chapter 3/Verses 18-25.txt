<p><strong> 18 4:1</strong> .] SPECIAL EXHORTATIONS TO RELATIVE SOCIAL DUTIES: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+3:18-19">Colossians 3:18-19</span> , <em> to the married</em> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+3:20-21">Colossians 3:20-21</span> , <em> to children and parents</em> : Col 3:22 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+4:1">Colossians 4:1</span> , <em> to slaves and masters</em> . Seeing that such exhortations occur in Ephesians also in terms so very similar, we are not justified, with Chrys., al., in assuming that there was any thing in the peculiar circumstances of the Colossian church, which required more than common exhortation of this kind. It has been said, that it is only in Epistles addressed to the Asiatic churches, that such exhortations are found: but in this remark the entirely general character of the Epistle to the Ephesians is forgotten. Besides, the exhortations of the Epistle to Titus cannot be so completely severed from these as to be set down in another category, as Eadie has endeavoured to do. See throughout the section, for such matters as are not remarked on, the notes to Eph 5:22 to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:9">Ephesians 6:9</span> .</p>
