<b> 10.</b>] Aristarchus was a Thessalonian (Acts xx. 4), first mentioned Acts xix. 29, as dragged into the theatre at Ephesus during the tumult, together with Gaius, both being “<i>fellow-travellers of Paul</i>.” He accompanied Paul to Asia (ib. xx. 4), and was with him in the voyage to Rome (xxvii. 2). In Philem. 24, he sends greeting, with Marcus, Demas, and Lucas, as here, On<b> fellow-prisoner</b> Meyer suggests an idea, which may without any straining of probability be adopted, and which would explain why Aristarchus is here “<i>fellow-servant</i>,” and in Philem. 23, “<i>fellow-prisoner</i>,” whereas Epaphras is here, ch. i. 7, merely a “<i>fellow-prisoner</i>,” and in Philem. 23, a “<i>fellow-worker</i>.” His view is, that the Apostle’s friends may have voluntarily shared his imprisonment by turns: and that Aristarchus may have been his fellow-prisoner when he wrote this Epistle, Epaphras when he wrote that to Philemon. “<i>Fellow-prisoner</i>” belongs to the same image of<i> warfare</i>, as “f<i> ellow-soldier</i>,” Phil. ii. 25; Philem. 2.<b> Mark</b>] can hardly he other than John Mark, compare Acts xii. 12, 25, who accompanied Paul and Barnabas in part of their first missionary journey, and because he turned back from them at Perga (ib. xiii. 13; xv. 38), was the subject of dispute between them on their second journey. That he was also the Evangelist, is matter of pure tradition, but not therefore to be rejected.<b> cousin</b>] not ‘<i>sister’s son</i>:’—this is a mistake, or at all events, as has been suggested, an obsolete way of expressing the relation which we know as<i> cousin</i>.<b> touching whom</b>...] What these commands were, must be left in entire uncertainty. They had been sent previous to the writing of our Epistle, but from, or by whom, we know not. They concerned Marcus, not Barnabas: and one can hardly help connecting them, associated as they are with<i> the command following</i>, with the dispute of Acts xv. 38. It is very possible, that in consequence of the rejection of John Mark on that occasion by St. Paul, the Pauline portion of the churches may have looked upon him with suspicion.
