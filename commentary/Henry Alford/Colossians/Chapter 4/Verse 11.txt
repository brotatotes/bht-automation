See many more examples in Kühner, ii. § 678. 2. This seems far better, with Meyer and Lachmann, than with rec. Ellic. al. to place the stop at περιτομῆς and attach the clause to the three preceding names. For thus we lose (in spite of the assertion by Ellic. that the μόνοι naturally refers the thought to the category last mentioned) the fact that there were other συνεργοί not of the circumcision who had been a comfort to him. The judaistic teachers were for the most part in opposition to St. Paul: cf. his complaint, Philippians 1:15 ; Php 1:17 )  are my fellow-workers towards the kingdom of God (the rest would not be called by this name so that De W.’s objection to the construction does not apply, that the opponents would not be called συνεργοί ; for they  are not so called),  man that proved (the passive meaning of ἐγενήθησαν is not safely to be pressed: see notes on Ephesians 3:7 ; 1 Thessalonians 1:5-6 ; 1 Peter 1:15 . The aor. alludes to some event recently passed: to what precisely, we cannot say)  a comfort to me (they are my συνεργοί ‘quippe qui.…’ Hierocles, de nuptiis, apud Stob. (Kypke), has the same phrase: ἡ γυνὴ δὲ παροῦσα μεγάλη γίνεται κ . πρὸς ταῦτα παρηγορία : so Plutarch, de auditione, p. 43 (id.), νόσημα παρηγορίας … δεόμενον ).
