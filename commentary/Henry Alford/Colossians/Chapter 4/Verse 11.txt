A Justus is mentioned Acts xviii. 7, as an inhabitant of Corinth, and a proselyte: but there is no further reason to identify the two.

The Judaistic teachers were for the most part in opposition to St. Paul: compare his complaint, Phil. i. 15, 17)<b> are my fellow-workers towards the kingdom of God, men that proved</b> (i. e.<i> inasmuch as they proved</i>. The past tense alludes to some event recently passed: to what precisely, we cannot say)<b> a comfort to me.</b>
