<p><strong> 12</strong> .] On Epaphras, see ch. Col 1:7 note. The sentence is better without a comma at <strong> ὑμῶν</strong> , both as giving more spirit to the δοῦλος χ . Ἰ ., and setting the ἐξ ὑμ . in antithesis to the ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν below. On <strong> ἀγων</strong> <strong> .</strong> besides reff., see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:30">Romans 15:30</span> . By mentioning Epaphras’s anxious prayers for them, he works further on their affections, giving them an additional motive for stedfastness, in that one of themselves was thus striving in prayer for them, <strong> ἵνα</strong> here gives the direct aim of ἀγωνιζ . See above on Col 4:3 <strong> that ye may stand, perfect and fully persuaded</strong> (see reff.), <strong> in</strong> (be firmly settled in, without danger of vacillating or falling) <strong> all the</strong> (lit. ‘in every:’ but we cannot thus express it in English) <strong> will of God</strong> . This connexion, of <strong> στῆτε</strong> with <strong> ἐν</strong> , as Mey., seems better than, as ordinarily (so also De W. and Ellic.), to join ἐν with the participles. Eadie characterizes it as needless refinement in Mey. to assert that thus not only a modal-beftimmung but a local-beftimmung is attached to στῆτε : but the use of στῆναι ἐν in the reff. seems to justify it.</p>
