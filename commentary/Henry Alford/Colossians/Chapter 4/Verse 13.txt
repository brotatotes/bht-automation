LAODICEA was a city of Phrygia Magna, large and rich (Rev. iii. 17; and Introd. to Rev.§iii. 13; and Tacitus says that when destroyed by an earthquake, the inhabitants rebuilt it without imperial assistance), on the river Lycus, formerly called Diospolis, and afterwards Rhoas; its subsequent name was from Laodice, queen of Antiochus II.
