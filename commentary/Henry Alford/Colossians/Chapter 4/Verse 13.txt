<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> πόνος</strong> , an unusual word in the N. T., hence the var. readd., is usual in the toil of conflict in war, thus answering to ἀγωνιζόμ . above: so Herod. vi. 114, ἐν τούτῳ τῷ πόνῳ ὁ πολέμαρχος Καλλίμαχος διαφθείρεται : similarly viii. 89. Plato, Phædr. 247 b, ἔνθα δὴ πόνος τε κ . ἀγὼν ἔσχατος ψυχῇ πρόκειται : Demosth. 637. 18, εἰ δ ʼ ἐκεῖνος ἀσθενέστερος ἦν τὸν ὑπὲρ τῆς νίκης ἐνεγκεῖν πόνον .

<p>On account of this mention of Laodicea and Hierapolis, some have thought that Epaphras was the founder of the three churches. See Prolegg. § ii. 2, 7.

<p><strong> Λαοδικείᾳ</strong> ] LAODICEA was a city of Phrygia Magna (Strabo xii. 8, Plin. v. 29: according to the subscription (rec.) of 1 Tim., the chief city of Phrygia Pacatiana), large ( ἡ τῆς χώρας ἀρετὴ κ . τῶν πολιτῶν τινες εὐτυχήσαντες , μεγάλην ἐποιήσαντο αὐτήν , Strabo) and rich (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+3:17">Revelation 3:17</span> ; and Prolegg. to Rev. § iii. 13. Tac. Ann. xiv. 27: ‘Laodicea, tremore terræ prolapsa, nullo a nobis remedio, propriis opibus revaluit:’ δυνατωτέρα τῶν ἐπὶ θαλάττῃ , Philostr. Soph. i. 25), on the river Lycus (hence called Λ . ἡ ἐπὶ Λύκῳ or πρὸς τῷ Λύκῳ , see Strabo, ib.), formerly called Diospolis, and afterwards Rhoas; its subsequent name was from Laodice queen of Antiochus II. (Steph. Byz.) In A.D. 62, Laodicea, with Hierapolis and Colossæ, was destroyed by an earthquake (Tacit. l. c.), to which visitations the neighbourhood was very subject ( εἰ γάρ τις ἄλλη κ . ἡ Λαοδίκεια εὔσειστος , κ . τῆς πλησιοχώρου πλέον , Plin. ib.). There is now on the spot a desolate village called Eski-hissar, with some ancient ruins (Arundel, Seven Churches). Winer, Realw.

<p><strong> Ἱεραπόλει</strong> ] Six Roman miles north from Laodicea: famed for many mineral springs (Strabo, xiii. 4, describes them at length, also the caverns which exhale noxious vapour. See also Plin. ii. 95), which are still flowing (Schubert, i. 283). Winer, Realw.</p>
