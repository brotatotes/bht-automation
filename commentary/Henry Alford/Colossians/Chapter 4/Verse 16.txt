<p><strong> τὴν ἐκ Λαοδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] On this Epistle, see Prolegg. to Eph. § ii. 17, 19; and Philem. § iii. 2, 3 [and note on the subscription to 1 Tim.]. I will only indicate here the right rendering of the words. They cannot well be taken, as τινές in Chrys., to mean οὐχὶ τὴν Π . πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἀπεσταλμένην , ἀλλὰ τὴν παρ ʼ αὐτῶν Παύλῳ (so also Syr., Thdrt., Phot. in Œc., Erasm., Beza, Calv., Wolf, Est., Corn.-a-lap., al.), both on account of the awkwardness of the sense commanding them to read an Epistle sent from Laodicea, and not found there, and on account of the phrase <strong> τὴν ἐκ</strong> so commonly having the pregnant meaning of ‘which is there and must be sought from there;’ cf. Kühner, ii. § 623 α . Herod. iii. 6. Thucyd. ii. 34; iii. 22; vi. 32; vii. 70, and other examples there. We may safely say that a letter not from, but <em> to</em> the Laodiceans is meant. For the construction of this latter sentence, ποιήσατε again is of course to be supplied.</p>
