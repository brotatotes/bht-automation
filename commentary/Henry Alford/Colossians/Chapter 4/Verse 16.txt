<b> 16.] this</b> (literally,<b> the</b>)<b> epistle. the epistle from Laodicea</b>] i.e. an epistle which I have written to Laodicea, to be forwarded from thence to you. On this Epistle, see Introd. to Eph.§ii. 17, 19; and Philem.§iii. 2, 3. I only indicate here the right rendering of the words. They cannot well be taken, as some whom Chrysostom mentions took them, to mean, an Epistle<i> from them to St. Paul</i>, both on account of the awkwardness of the sense commanding them to read an Epistle sent from Laodicea, and not found there, and on account of the phrase in the original. We may safely say that a letter not<i> from</i>, but<i> to</i> the Laodiceans is meant. For the construction of this latter sentence, “<i>cause</i>,” before “<i>that</i>,” is of course to be supplied.
