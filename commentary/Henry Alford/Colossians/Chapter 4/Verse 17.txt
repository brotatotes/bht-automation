<p><strong> 17</strong> .] Archippus is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:2">Philemon 1:2</span> , and called the Apostle’s συνστρατιώτης . I have treated on the inference to be drawn from this passage as to his abode, in the Prolegg. to Philemon, § iii.1. He was evidently some officer of the church, but <em> what</em> , in the wideness of διακονία , we cannot say: and conjectures are profitless (see such in Est. and Corn.-a-lap.). Meyer well remarks, that the authority hereby implied on the part of the congregation to exercise reproof and discipline over their teachers is remarkable: and that the hierarchical turn given to the passage by Thl. and Œc. ( ἵνα ὅταν ἐπιτιμᾷ Ἀρχ . αὐτοῖς , μὴ ἔχωσιν ἐγκαλεῖν ἐκείνῳ ὡς πικρῷ , … ἐπεὶ ἄλλως ἄτοπον τοῖς μαθηταῖς περὶ τοῦ διδασκάλου διαλέγεσθαι , Thl.) belongs to a later age. As to the words themselves, <strong> Take heed to the ministry which thou receivedst in the Lord</strong> (the sphere of the <em> reception</em> of the ministry; in which the recipient lived and moved and promised at his ordination: not, of the ministry itself ( <strong> τὴν</strong> ἐν κυρ .), nor is <strong> ἐν</strong> to be diverted from its simple local meaning), <strong> that</strong> (aim and end of the βλέπε , in order that) <strong> thou fulfil it</strong> (reff.).</p>
