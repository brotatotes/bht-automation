<b> 6.</b>]<b> Let your speech</b> (<i>to those without</i> still)<b> be always in</b> (as its characteristic element)<b> grace</b> (i. e. gracious, and winning favour: compare Luke iv. 22),<b> seasoned with salt</b> (not insipid and void of point, which can do no man any good: we must not forget that both these words have their spiritual meaning:<i> grace</i>, so common an one as to have almost passed out of its ordinary acceptation into that other,—the grace which is conferred on us from above, and which our words and actions should reflect:—and<i> salt</i>, as used by our Saviour in Mark ix. 50, as symbolizing the unction, freshness, and vital briskness which characterizes the Spirit’s presence and work in a man. There seems to be no allusion here to the conservative power of salt: the matter in hand at present is not avoiding corrupt conversation. Still less does the meaning of wit belong to this place. A local allusion is just possible: we are told by Herodotus that there was a lake from which salt was made in the neighbourhood of Colossae),<b> that ye may know</b>] Compare 1 Pet. iii. 15, which however is but one side of that readiness which is here recommended.
