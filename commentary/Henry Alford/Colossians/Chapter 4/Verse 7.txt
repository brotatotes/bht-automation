 7 .] On Tychicus, see Ephesians 4:21 .
	 ὁ ἀγ  .   ἀδελφός , as dear to his heart:  πιστ  .   διάκ  . , as his tried companion in the ministry,  σύνδ  .   ἐν κυρίῳ , as one with him in the motives and objects of his active work: ὥστε , as Chrys., αὐτῷ πάντοθεν τὸ ἀξιόπιστον ξυνήγαγεν . There is a delicate touch of affection in ἵνα γνῷ τὰ περὶ ὑμ ., which can hardly, in the doubtfulness of the reading, be the work of a corrector. It implies that there were painful circumstances of trial, to which the subsequent  παρακαλέσῃ also has reference. δείκνυσιν αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς πειρασμοῖς ὄντας , Chrys. The objection (Eadie), that thus the  εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο will announce another purpose from that enounced above in τὰ κατ ʼ ἐμὲ π . γνωρ ., will apply just as much to the other reading; for any how the αὐτὸ τοῦτο must iuclude the καὶ παρακαλέσῃ κ . τ . λ . But the fact is, that αὐτὸ τοῦτο may apply exclusively to the  following , without any reference to what has  preceded : see Romans 9:17 ; the parallel place, Ephesians 6:22 ; Philippians 1:6 .
