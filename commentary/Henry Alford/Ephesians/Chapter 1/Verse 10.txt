Thus<i> the dispensation of the fulness of the times</i> will mean, the filling up, completing, fulfilment, of the appointed seasons, carrying on during the Gospel dispensation. Now, belonging to, carried on during, this fulfilling of the periods or seasons, is the<i> œconomy</i> or<i> dispensation</i> here spoken of. And having regard to the derivation and usage of the word, it will mean,<i> the giving</i><i> forth of the Gospel under God's providential arrangements.</i> First and greatest of all, HE is the<i> Steward or œconomus, of the dispensation:</i> then, above all others, His divine Son: and as proceeding from the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit—and then in subordinate degrees every one who<i> is entrusted with carrying out the œconomy,</i> i.e. all Christians, even to the lowest, as<i> stewards of the manifold grace of God,</i> 1 Pet. iv. 10.

All creation is summed up in Christ: it was all the result of the Love of the Father for the Son [see my Doctrine of Divine Love, Serm. I.], and in the Son it is all regarded by the Father. The vastly different relation to Christ of the different parts of creation, is no objection to this union in Him: it affects, as Bengel says, on Rom. viii. 19, “each genus according to its own receptivity.” The Church, of which the Apostle here mainly treats, is subordinated to Him in the highest degree of conscious and joyful union: those who are not His spiritually, in mere subjugation, yet consciously; the inferior tribes of creation, unconsciously: but objectively, all are summed up in Him)<b>; even in Him</b> (emphatic repetition, to connect more closely with Him the following relative clause),
