This word is the instrument of the new birth, James i. 18. See Col. i. 5, and, above all, John xvii. 17), (viz.)<b> the Gospel of your salvation</b> (the Gospel whose contents, whose good tidings are your salvation: compare the expressions, “<i>the Gospel of the grace of God,</i>” Acts xx. 24,— “<i>of peace,</i>” ch. vi. 15,— “<i>of the Kingdom,</i>” Matt. ix. 35,— “<i>of Jesus Christ,</i>” Mark i. 1):<b> in whom also</b> (be-longs to “<i>having believed were sealed,</i>” not to either verb alone)<b> having believed</b> (i. e.<b> on your believing</b>: the<i> date from which,</i> as “<i>having heard</i>” above: see Acts xix. 2, ‘Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye believed?’—and Rom. xii 11: see also 1 Cor. iii, 5; xv. 2, 11; Heb. iv. 3.
