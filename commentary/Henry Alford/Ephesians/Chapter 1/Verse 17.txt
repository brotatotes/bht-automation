<b> 17</b>.]<i> Purport and purpose of the prayer</i>:—<b>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ</b> (see on ver. 3, The appellation is here solemnly and most appropriately given, as leading on to what is about to be said in vv. 20 ff. of God’s<i> exaltation of Christ</i> to be Head over all things to His Church. To His God, Christ also in the days of His flesh prayed, “<i>Father, glorify thy Son:</i>” and even more markedly in that last cry, “<i>My God, my God</i>”),<b> the Father of Glory</b> (not, merely the<i> author</i>, or<i> source</i>, of glory: but God is the Father,—by being the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,—of that glory, the true and all-including glory, and<i> only glory</i>, of the Godhead, which shone forth in the Manhood of the only-begotten Son (John i. 14),—the true Shechinah, which His saints beheld in the face of Christ, 2 Cor. iv. 4, 6, and into which they are changed by the Lord the Spirit, ib. iii. 18. In fact, 2 Cor. iii. 7—iv. 6, is the key to this sublime expression),<b> would give unto you the Spirit</b> (certainly it would not be right to take the word here as signifying solely the Holy Spirit, nor solely the spirit of man: rather is it the complex idea, of the spirit of man indwelt by the Spirit of God, so that as such, it is His special gift; see below)<b> of wisdom</b> (not, which<i> gives</i> wisdom, but which possesses it as its character; to which appertains wisdom)<b> and of revelation</b> (i. e. that revelation which belongs to<i> all Christians</i>: see 1 Cor. ii. 10 ff.: not the<i> spiritual gifts</i> of the early Church;—nor could the Apostle be alluding to any thing so trivial and fleeting, see 1 Cor. xiii. xiv. To those who are taught of God’s Spirit, ever more and more of His glories in Christ are revealed, see John xvi. 14, 15)<b> in</b> (belongs to<i> would give</i>: as the element and sphere of the working of this gift of the Spirit)<b> full knowledge</b> (not knowledge only, but knowledge full and complete: see 1 Cor xiii. 12)<b> of Him:</b> (<b>of Him</b> refers to the Father,—not to Christ, as some think; compare “<i>his</i>” four times in vv. 18, 19: Christ first becomes thus designated in ver. 20),<b> having the eyes of your heart enlightened</b> (the expression<b> eyes of your heart</b> is somewhat unusual. The word “<i>heart</i>” in Scripture signifies the very core and centre of life, where the intelligence has its post of observation, where the stores of experience are laid up, and the thoughts have their fountain. Thus the<b> eyes of the heart</b> would be those pointed at in Matt. vi. 22, 23,—that inner eye of the heart, through which light is poured in on its own purposes and motives, and it looks out on, and perceives, and judges things spiritual: the eye, as in nature, being both receptive and contemplative of the light);<b> that you may know</b> (purpose of the<i> enlightening</i>)<b> what is the</b><b> hope</b> (i. e. the nature of the hope itself, involving also of course the nature of the thing hoped for, which gives its whole complexion to the hope)<b> of</b> (belonging to, see on ch. iv. 4)<b> His calling</b> (i. e. the calling wherewith he called us. All the matters mentioned,<i> the calling, the inheritance, the power, are His</i>,—but not all in the same sense: see below.
