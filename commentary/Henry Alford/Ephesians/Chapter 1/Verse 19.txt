<b> 19</b>.]<b> and what the surpassing greatness of his power to us-ward who believe</b> (not His future power in the actual resurrection only is spoken of, but THE WHOLE of His energizing to us-ward from first to last, principally however His<i> present</i> spiritual work, as implied by the present tense, “<i>who</i> [now]<i> believe</i>,” not, as in 2 Thess. i. 10, “<i>that believed:</i>” see also Col. ii. 12, and 1 Pet. i. 3–5. This power is exerted<i> to us-ward</i>, which expression of the A.V. I retain, as giving better the prominence to<i> us</i> in the fact of its<i> direction</i>, than the more usual but tamer ‘<i>toward us</i>’),<b> accord-ing to</b> (in proportion to,—as might be expected from: but more than this—His power to us-ward is a part of, a continuation of, or rather included as a consequence in, the other)<b> the working</b> (putting forth in action, in an object)<b> of the might of His strength</b> (His<i> might</i>, the actual measure of His<i> strength</i>. The latter is the attribute, subjectively considered: the former the weight of that attribute, objectively es-teemed: the operation, in matter of fact, of the might of that strength),<b> which</b> (viz.<i> working</i>: compare ver. 6, note)<b> He hath wrought in Christ</b> (our<i> firstfruits</i>: nor only this, but our<i> Head</i>, in virtue of God’s<i> working</i> in whom, His power to us-ward is made possible and actual),<b> in that He raised Him from the dead</b> (the resurrection of Christ was not a mere bodily act, an earnest of our bodily resurrection, but was a spiritual act, the raising of His humanity [which is ours], consisting of body and soul, from infirmity to glory, from the curse to the final triumph. In that He died, HE DIED UNTO SIN once; but in that He liveth, HE LIVETH UNTO GOD. And so<i> we who believe</i>, knit to him, have died unto sin and live unto God. It is necessary to the understanding of the following, thoroughly to appreciate this—or we shall be in danger of regarding, with the shallower expositors, Christ’s resurrection as merely a<i> pledge</i> of our<i> bodily</i> resurrection, or as a mere<i> figure representing</i> our<i> spiritual</i> resurrection,—not as<i> involving</i> the resurrection of the Church in both senses),<b> and setting Him at His right hand</b> (see especially Mark xvi. 19)<b> in the heavenly places</b> (see on ver. 3: and Matt. vi. 9, note. But the fact of the universal idea, of God’s dwelling being in heaven, being only a symbolism common to all men, must not for a moment induce us to let go the verity of Christ’s bodily existence, or to explain away the glories of His resurrection into mere spiritualities. As Stephen saw Him, so He veritably is: in human form, locally existent),<b> up above</b> (the word seems to imply, not<i> far above</i> but simply local elevation)<b> all rule</b> (compare Matt. xxviii. 18),<b> and authority, and power, and lordship</b> (the most reasonable account of the four words seems to be this:<b> above all rule</b> gives the high-est and fullest expression of exaltation:<b> and authority</b> is added as filling out<b> rule</b> in detail:<i> authority</i> being not only government, but every kind of official power, primary and delegated: compare Matt. viii. 9; x. 1; xxi. 23 ff; Luke xx. 20; xxiii. 7. Then in the second pair<b> power</b> is mere<i> might</i>, the raw material, so to speak, of<i> authority: lordship</i> is that pre-eminence which<i> power</i> establishes for itself. So that in the first pair we descend from the higher and concentrated to the lower and diffused: in the second we ascend from the lower and diffused to the higher and concentrated. The following shews that in this enumeration not only earthly, nor only heavenly authorities are meant to be included, but both together,—so as to make it perfectly general. That the<i> evil spirits</i> are included, is therefore manifest: see also ch. vi. 12; 1 Cor. xv. 24–26),<b> and every name that is named</b> (further generalization: indicating not merely titles of honour, nor persons, but a transition from the<i> authorities, &c.</i> to<i> all things</i> below: answering to “<i>nor any other creature,</i>” in Rom. viii. 39. And this transition passes into still wider meaning in the following words),<b> not only in this present state, but also in that which is to come</b> (compare again Rom. viii. 38—not only<i> time</i> present and to come, but the present [earthly] condition of things, and the future [heavenly] one. And forasmuch as that heavenly state which is for us<i> future</i>, is now, to those in it, present,<i> it</i> is by the easiest transition denoted by “<i>the age to come:</i>” compare Luke xx. 35, and especially Heb. ii. 5, “<i>the world to come.</i>” So that the meanings seem combined,— ‘every name now named in earth and heaven:’ and, ‘every name which we name,—not only now, but hereafter.’ Wesley says, beautifully expanding Bengel: “We know that the king is above all, though we cannot name all the officers of his court. So we know that Christ is above all, though we are not able to name all His subjects”):<b> 22.</b>]<b> and subjected all things under His feet</b> (from the Messianic Ps, viii.; not without an allusion also above to Ps. cx. 1),<b> and gave</b> (<i> ‘presented</i>;’ keep the literal sense: not ‘<i>appointed</i>;’ see below) HIM (emphatic, from its position: HIM, thus exalted, thus glorified, the Father not only raised to this supereminence, but gave Him to His redeemed as their Head, &c.)<b> as head over all things to the Church</b> (the meaning is thus to be gained, from what follows: CHRIST is Head over all things: the Church is the BODY of Christ, and as such is the fulness of Him who fills all with all: the Head of such a Body, is Head over all things; therefore when God gives Christ as<i> Head</i> to the church, He gives Him as<i> Head over</i><i> all</i><i> things</i> to the church, from the necessity of the case. Thus what follows is explanatory of this),<b> which same</b> (Church)<b> is His BODY</b> (not in a figure merely: it is veritably His Body: not that which in our glorified humanity He personally bears, but that in which He, as the Christ of God, is manifested and glorified by spiritual organization. He is its Head, from Him comes its life; in Him, it is exalted: in it, He is lived forth and witnessed to; He possesses nothing for Himself,—neither His communion with the Father, nor His fulness of the Spirit, nor His glorified humanity,—but all for His Church, which is in the innermost reality, HIMSELF; His flesh and His bones—and therefore)<b> the fulness</b> (i. e. ‘<i>the thing filled</i>,—<i> “the filled up receptacle”</i> [compare ch. ii. 22], as Eadie expresses it; the meaning being, that the church, being the Body of Christ, is dwelt in and filled by God: it is His<b> fulness</b> in an especial manner—His fulness abides in it, and is exemplified by it. The nearest approach to any one word in English which may express it, is made by<b> fulness</b>, though it requires explaining, as importing not the inherent plenitude of God Himself, but that communicated plenitude of gifts and graces wherein He infuses Himself into His Church)<b> of Him that filleth</b> (it is not very easy here to decide whether the word should be thus rendered, or, “<i>that is being filled with.</i>” I have discussed the two in my Greek Test. and adopted that in the text: being further inclined to this rendering by ch. iv. 10, where it is said of Christ, “<i>He that ascended up above all heavens</i>,<b> that He might fill all things</b>,” and the Apostle proceeds to enumerate the various gifts bestowed by Him on his Church. See further in note there)<b> all things</b> (the whole universe: not to he restricted in meaning. The Church is the special receptacle and abiding-place of Him who fills all things)<b> with all things</b> (i. e. who is the bestower of all, wherever found:—<i>with all</i>, not only gifts, not only blessings, but<i> things</i>: who fills all creation with whatever it possesses—who is the Author and Giver of all things. The reference is, I think, to the Father, and not to Christ).
