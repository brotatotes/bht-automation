On the form of greeting, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:7">Romans 1:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:3">1 Corinthians 1:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:2">2 Corinthians 1:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:3">Galatians 1:3</span> , &amp;c.

<p>The Socinian perversion of the words, ‘ <em> from God, who is the Father of us and of our Lord Jesus Christ</em> ,’ is decisively refuted by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span> , not to mention that nothing but the grossest ignorance of St. Paul’s spirit could ever allow such a meaning to be thought of. We must not fall into the error of refining too much, as Stier, on χάρις and εἰρήνη , as referring respectively to ἁγίοις and πιστοῖς : see [1] above, where these last epithets do not occur.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [1] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
