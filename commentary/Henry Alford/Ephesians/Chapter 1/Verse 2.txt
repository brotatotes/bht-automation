 2 .] After  χάρις ὑμ  .   κ  .   εἰρ  . supply rather εἴη than ἔστω ; see 1Pe 1:2 ; 2 Peter 1:2 ; Jude 1:2 . On the form of greeting, cf. Romans 1:7 ; 1 Corinthians 1:3 ; 2 Corinthians 1:2 ; Galatians 1:3 , &c.
	The Socinian perversion of the words, ‘  from God, who is the Father of us and of our Lord Jesus Christ ,’ is decisively refuted by Titus 1:4 , not to mention that nothing but the grossest ignorance of St. Paul’s spirit could ever allow such a meaning to be thought of. We must not fall into the error of refining too much, as Stier, on χάρις and εἰρήνη , as referring respectively to ἁγίοις and πιστοῖς : see [1] above, where these last epithets do not occur.
	 [1] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
