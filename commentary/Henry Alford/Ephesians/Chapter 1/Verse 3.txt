<b> 3—III. 21.] FIRST PORTION OF THE EPISTLE: THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST.</b> And herein,<br><br><b> 3.</b>]<b> Blessed</b> (see note on Rom. ix, 5: and a similar doxology, 2 Cor. i. 3. Almost all St. Paul’s Epistles begin with some ascription of praise. That to Titus is the only exception [not Gal.: see Gal. i. 5]. See also 1 Pet. i. 3)<b> be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</b> (see Rom. xv. 6; 2 Cor. i. 3; xi. 31; Col. i. 3—also 1 Cor. xv. 24, Such is the simplest and most forcible sense of the words—Theophylact says, “God and Father of one and the same Christ: God, as of Christ in the flesh; Father, as of God the Word.” See John xx. 17, from which saying of our Lord it is not improbable that the ex-pression took its rise),<b> who blessed</b> (not, as A.V., ‘<i>hath</i> blessed:’ the historical fact in the counsels of the Father being thought of throughout the sentence. “<i>Blessed</i>”— “<i>who blesse</i> d”— “<i>blessin</i> g”—such was the ground-tone of the new covenant. As in creation God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply,”—so in redemption,—at the introduction of the covenant, “All families of the earth shall be BLESSED,”—at its completion,— “Come ye BLESSED of my Father.’—But<i> God’s</i> blessing is in<i> facts</i>—ours in words only)<b> us</b> (whom? not the Apostle only: nor St. Paul and his fellow-Apostles:—but, ALL CHRISTIANS—all the members of Christ. The “<i>ye also</i>” of ver. 13 perfectly agrees with this: see there: but the “I also” of ver. 15 does not agree with the other views)<b> in</b> (better than “<i>with:</i>” see below: it is instrumental or medial: the element in which, and means by which, the blessing is imparted)<b> all</b> (i. e.<b> all</b> possible—all, exhaustive, in all richness and fulness of blessing: see ver. 23 note)<b> spiritual blessing</b> (i. e.<b> blessing of the Spirit</b>: as we sometimes understand<i> spiritual</i>, not merely, ‘inward blessing? the word in the New Test. always implies the working of the Holy Spirit, never bearing merely our modern inaccurate sense of spiritual as opposed to bodily. See 1 Cor. ix. 11, which has been thus misunderstood)<b> in the heavenly place</b> s (so the expression, which occurs five times in this Epistle, and nowhere else, can only mean; see ver. 20. It is not probable that St. Paul should have chosen an unusual ex-pression for the purposes of this Epistle, and then used it in several different senses. But<i> what is the sense</i>? Our country,<i> place of citizenship</i>, is<i> in heaven</i>, Phil. iii. 20: there our High Priest stands, blessing us. There are our treasures, Matt. vi. 20, 21, and our affections to be, Col. iii. 1 ff.: there our hope is laid up, Col. i. 5: our inheritance is reserved for us, 1 Pet. i. 4. And there, in that place, and belonging to that state, is the<i> blessing</i>, the gift of the Spirit, Heb. vi. 4, poured out on those who<i> mind the things above</i>. Materially, we are yet in the body: but in the Spirit, we are in heaven—only waiting for the redemption of the body to be entirely and literally there)<b> in Christ</b> ( “the threefold<b> in</b> after ‘<i>who blessed,</i>’ has a meaning ever deeper and more precise: and should therefore be kept in translating. The blessing with which God has blessed us, consists and expands itself—in all<i> blessing of the Spirit—</i>then brings in<i> Heaven</i>, the heavenly state in us, and us in it—then finally, CHRIST,<i> personally</i>, He Himself, who is set and exalted into Heaven, comes by the Spirit down into us, so that He is in us and we in Him of a truth, and thereby, and in so far, we are with Him in heaven.” Stier):
