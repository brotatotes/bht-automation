<b> 4.</b>]<b> even as</b> (this explains and expands the foregoing—shewing wherein the<i> blessing</i> consists as regards us, and God’s working towards us. Notice, that whereas ver. 3 has summarily included in the work of blessing the Three Persons, the FATHER bestowing the SPIRIT in CHRIST,—now the threefold cord, so to speak, is un wrapped, and the part of each divine Person separately described: see the argument above)<b> He chose us</b> (<i>se</i> lected, rather than<i> e</i> lected, it is a choosing out of the world, and for Himself. The word is an Old Test. word, and refers to the spiritual Israel, as it did to God’s elect Israel of old. But there is no<i> contrast</i> between their election and ours: it has been but one election throughout—an election in Christ, and to holiness on God’s side—and involving accession to God’s people on ours)<b> in Him</b> (i. e. in Christ, as the second Adam [2 Cor. xv. 22], the righteous Head of our race. In Him, in one wide sense, were all mankind elected, inasmuch as He took their flesh and blood, and redeemed them, and represents them before the Father: but in the proper and final sense, this can be said only of His faithful ones, His Church, who are incorporated in Him by the Spirit. But in any sense, all God’s election is<i> in</i> HIM only)<b> before the foundation of the world</b> (this expression occurs only here in St. Paul. Stier remarks on the necessary connexion of the true doc-trines of creation and redemption: how utterly irreconcilable Pantheism is with this, God’s election, before laying the foundation of the world, of His people in His Son),<b> that we should be</b> (the Apostle seems to have Deut. vii. 6; xiv. 2, before his mind; in both which places the same sentiment, and form of sentence, occurs)<b> holy and blameless</b> (the positive and negative sides of the Christian<i> character</i>. This holiness and unblameableness must not be understood of that justification by faith by which the sinner stands accepted before God: it is distinctly put forth here [see also ch. v. 27] as an ultimate<i> result</i> as regards us, and refers to that sanctification which follows on justification by faith, and which is the will of God respecting us, 1 Thess. iv. 7)<b> before Him</b> (i. e. in the deepest verity of our being—thoroughly penetrated by the Spirit of holiness, bearing His searching eye, ch. v. 27: but at the same time implying an especial nearness to His presence and dear-ness to Him—and bearing a foretaste of the time when the elect shall be<i> before the throne of God</i>, Rev. vii. 15.

The qualification, as here existing, is in the highest degree solemn and appropriate.<b> Love</b>, that which man lost at the Fall, but which God is, and to which God restores man by redemption, is the great element. in which, as in their abode and breathing-place, all Christian graces subsist, and in which, emphatically, all perfection before God must be found, And so, when the Apostle, ch. iv. 16, is describing the glorious building up of the body, the Church, he speaks of its increasing “<i>to the building up of itself in Love</i>.” And it is his prac-tice in this and the parallel Epistle, to add “<i>in love</i>” as the completion of the idea of Christian holiness—see ch. iii. 18; Col. ii. 2, also ch. iv. 25 v. 2):
