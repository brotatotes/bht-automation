<b> 7.</b>] Now the Apostle passes, with<b> In whom,</b> to the consideration of<i> the ground of the church in the</i> SON (7–12): see the synopsis above. But the Father still continues the great subject of the whole;—only the<i> reference</i> is now to the Son.<br><br><b> In whom</b> (see on “in Christ,” ver. 3—and compare Rom. iii. 24)<b> we have</b> (objective— ‘<i>there is for us</i>’ But not without a subjective implied import, as spoken of those who truly<i> have</i> it—have laid hold of it: “are ever needing and ever having it,” Eadie)<b> the</b> (or, our)<b> Redemption</b> (from God’s wrath—or rather from that which brought us under God’s wrath, the guilt and power of sin, Matt. i. 21.

We have in this grace not only redemption from misery and wrath, not only forgiveness,—but we find in it the liberty, the glory, the inheritance of the children of God,—the-crown of eternal life: compare 2 Cor. viii. 9);
