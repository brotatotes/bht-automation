<p><strong> 1</strong> .] <strong> You also</strong> ( καί is much more than merely copulative. It selects and puts into prominence ὑμᾶς , from among the recipients of God’s grace implied in Eph 2:19-22 of the former chapter. See below), <strong> who were</strong> (“ <strong> ὄντας</strong> clearly marks the state in which they were at the time when God quickened them: this in Eph 2:5 is brought prominently forward by the <strong> καί</strong> : here however καί is joined with and gives prominence to ὑμᾶς . A simple indication, then, of their state, without any temporal or causal adjunct, ‘ <em> when</em> ,’ ‘ <em> whereas</em> ,’ &amp;c., seems in the present case most satisfactory, as less calling away the attention from the more emphatic ὑμᾶς .” Ellicott, edn. 1) <strong> dead</strong> (certainly not, as Meyer, ‘ <em> subject to</em> (physical) <em> death</em> :’ the whole of the subsequent mercy of God in His quickening them is <em> spiritual</em> , and therefore of necessity the death also. That it <em> involves</em> physical death, is most true; but as I have often had occasion to remark (see e.g. on Joh 11:25-26 ), this latter is so subordinate to spiritual death, as often hardly to come into account in Scripture) <strong> in</strong> (not exactly as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+2:13">Colossians 2:13</span> , νεκροὺς ὄντας ἐν τοῖς παραπτώμασιν , where the <em> element</em> is more in view, whereas here it is the causal dative we might render, were the expression good in serious writing, ‘dead <em> of</em> your trespasses,’ as we say ‘he lies dead of cholera.’ I use ‘in’ as giving nearly the same causal sense: we say, indiscriminately, ‘sick <em> of</em> a fever,’ and ‘sick <em> in</em> a fever’) [ <strong> your</strong> ] <strong> trespasses and sins</strong> (it seems difficult to establish universally any distinction such as has been attempted, e.g. by Tittm. Synon. p. 47, “licet non satis vera Hieronymi distinctio videatur, qui παράπτωμα primum ad peccatum lapsum esse dicit, ἁμαρτίαν , quum ad ipsum facinus perventum est; tamen in v. παράπτωμα proprie inest notio peccati quod temere commissum est, i.e. a nolente facere injuriam; sed in ἁμαρτία et ἁμάρτημα cogitatur facinus quod, qui fecit, facere voluit, sive imprudens erraverit, recte se facere existimans, sive impetu animi et libidine obreptus fecerit.… Levius est παράπτωμα quam ἁμαρτία , si ἁμαρτία de singulo peccato dicitur.” Where however, as here, the two occur together, it may be accepted as correct. If we take merely that of Ellicott, al., that “ παραπτώματα are the particular, special acts of sin, ἁμαρτίαι the more general and abstract, viz. all forms, phases, and movements of sin, whether entertained in thought or consummated in act,” we shall not provide for the whole case: for ἁμαρτίαι are unquestionably used for special acts (= ἁμαρτήματα ): and we want a distinction which shall embrace this case. Another question concerns the construction of this accusative clause. Some (Beng., Lachm., Harl.) consider it as a continuation of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:23">Ephesians 1:23</span> , and place a comma only at πληρουμένου . But (see our division of the sense) the sentence evidently finishes with πληρουμένου , and a new subject is here taken up. The simplest view seems to be the usual one, that the Apostle began with the accusative, intending to govern it by συνεζωοποίησεν τῷ χριστῷ , but was led away by the relative clauses, ἐν αἷς ποτὲ …, ἐν οἷς καὶ ἡμεῖς …, and himself takes up the dropped thread of the construction by ὁ δὲ θεὸς …, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:4">Ephesians 2:4</span> . So Erasm.: “hyperbati longioris ambitum ipse correxit Apostolus dicens ‘Deus autem qui dives est’ …” At all events, the clause should be left, in translation, pendent, as it stands, and not filled in conjecturally),</p>
