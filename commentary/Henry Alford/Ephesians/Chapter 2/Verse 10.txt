<b> 10</b>.]<b> For</b> (substantiates vv. 8, 9. The English reader is likely to imagine a contrast between ‘not of<i> works’</i> and ‘for we are His handi<i> work</i>,’ which can hardly have been in the mind of the Apostle)<b> his handiwork are we</b> (not, in our natural creation, which idea is clearly refuted by what immediately follows,—but in the spiritual creation, treated of in vv. 8, 9),<b> created in Christ Jesus</b> (see ver. 15; Tit. iii. 5, where the beginning of this new life is called<i> regeneration</i>. See also 2 Cor. v. 17; Gal. vi. 15)<b> for good works</b> (just as a tree may be said to be created for its fruit: see below),<b> which God before prepared</b> ( ‘<i>before He thus created us</i>.’ The sentiment is the same as that in John v. 36. To recur to the similitude used above, we might say of the trees,—they were created for fruits which God before prepared that they should bear them: i.e. defined and assigned to each tree its own, in form, and flavour, and time of bearing. So in the course of God’s providence, our good works are marked out for and assigned to each one of us)<b> that we should walk in them</b>. Thus the truth of the maxim “good works do not go before him who is to be justified, but follow after one who is justified,” is shewn. The sentiment is strictly one of the Apostle’s,—in the spirit of Rom. xii.; Gal. v. 22, 25, &c.
