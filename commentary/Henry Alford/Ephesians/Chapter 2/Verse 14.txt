<b> 14</b>.]<b> For He</b> (there is an emphasis on<b> He</b>, ‘He and none other’)<b> is our peace</b> (in the widest and most literal sense,<i> our peace</i>. He did not make our peace and then retire, leaving us to enjoy that peace,—but is Himself its medium and its substance; His making both one was no external reconciliation, but the taking both, their common nature, on and into Himself,—see ver. 15. Bear in mind the multitude of prophetic passages which connect peace with Him, Isa. ix. 5, 6; lii. 7; liii. 5; lvii. 19; Micah v. 5; Hag. ii. 9; Zech. ix. 10: also Luke ii. 14; John xiv. 27; xx. 19, 21, 26. And notice that already the complex idea of the whole verse, that of uniting both Jews and Gentiles in one reconciliation to God, begins to appear: for He is our Peace, not only as reconciling Jew to Gentile, not as bringing the far-off Gentile near<i> to</i> the Jew, but as reconciling both, united, to God; as bringing the far-off Gentile, and the near Jew, both into peace with God. For want of observing this the sense has been much obscured: see below),<b> who made</b> (specification,<i> how</i> He is our Peace. Better ‘<i>made</i>,’ than ‘<i>hath made</i>:’ the latter is true, but it is the historic fact which is here brought out)<b> both</b> (Jews and Gentiles. In the original<i> both</i> is neuter, as abstract;—both things, both elements)<b> one, and</b> (explana-tory’ namely, in that he’)<b> threw down the middle wall of the fence</b> (i. e. the middle wall which belonged to—was a necessary part of the carrying out of—the<i> fence</i>, or<b> partition</b>. The primary allusion seems to be, to the rending of the veil at the crucifixion: not that that veil separated Jew and Gentile, but that it, the chief symbol of separation from God, included in its removal the admission to Him of that one body into which Christ made Jew and Gentile. This complex idea is before the Apostle throughout the sentence: and necessarily 5; for the reconciliation which Christ effected between Jew and Gentile was in fact only a subordinate step of the great reconciliation of both to God, which He effected by His sacrifice in the flesh,—and in speaking of one he speaks of the other also. The<b> partition</b>, from what has been said above, is more general in sense than the<b> middle wall</b>; is in fact the whole arrangement, of which that was but an instrument—the separation itself, consequent on a system of separation: it represents therefore the whole legal system, ceremonial and moral, which made the whole separation,—of Jew from Gentile,—and in the background, of both from God), [<b>to wit</b>]<b> the enmity</b> (not, of Jew and Gentile: so strong a term is not justified as applying to their separation, nor does such a reference satisfy ver. 16,—see there;—but, the enmity in which both were involved against God, see Rom, viii. 7.<b> the enmity</b> is in apposition with<b> the partition.</b> This enmity was the real cause of separation from God, and in being so, was the inclusive, mediate cause of the separation between Jew and Gentile. Christ, by abolishing the first, abolished the other also: see below),<b> in His flesh</b> (to be joined, not with<b> abolishing</b>, as the A.V., which is very harsh, breaking the parallelism,—but with<b> brake down</b>. Christ destroyed the<i> partition</i>, i.e. the enmity, in, or by, His flesh; see on ver. 16, where the same idea is nearly repeated. It was in His crucified flesh, which was<i> “in the likeness of the Slesh of sin</i>,” that He slew this enmity);<b> having done away the law of decretory commandments</b> (this law was the<i> partition</i>,—the great exponent of the<i> enmity</i>. Its specific nature was that it consisted in commandments, decretorily or dogmatically expressed. This law, moral and ceremonial, its decalogue, its ordinances, its rites, was entirely done away in and by the death of Christ. See Col. ii. 13–15, notes. And the end of that<i> abolition</i> was);<b> that He might create the two</b> (Jew and Gentile)<b> in Himself into one new man</b> (observe, not that He might reconcile the two<i> to each other</i> only, nor is the Apostle speaking merely of any such reconciliation: but that he might incorporate the two, reconciled in Him to God, into one<i> new</i> man,—the old man to which both belonged, the enemy of God, having been slain in His flesh on the Cross. Observe, too, ONE new man: we are all in God’s sight but one in Christ, as we are but one in Adam), [<b>so</b>]<b> making peace</b> (not, between Jew and Gentile: He is<i> the peace</i> of us all: see below on ver. 17);<b> and</b> (parallel with the former purpose)<b> might reconcile both of them</b> (or<b> of us</b>)<b> in one body</b> (not His own human body, as Chrysostom [who however seems to waver between this and His mystical body],—but the Church, compare the same expression Col. iii. 15)<b> unto God</b> (if this had not been here expressed, the<i> whole</i> reference of the sentence would have been thought to be to the uniting Jews and Gentiles. That it is expressed, now shews that throughout, that union has been thought of only as a subordinate step in a greater reconciliation)<b> by means of</b> (through)<b> the</b> (His)<b> cross</b> (the cross regarded as the symbol of that which was done on and by it), having<b> slain the enmity</b> (this has been taken here to mean the enmity between Jew and Gentile. But see on ver. 15: and let us ask here, was this the enmity which Christ slew at His death? Was<i> this</i> the<i> enmity</i>, the slaying of which brought in the<i> reconciliation</i> as this verse implies? Does such a meaning of the word at all satisfy the solemnity of the sentence, or of the next two verses? I cannot think so: and must maintain the<i> enmity</i> here [and if here, then in ver. 15 also] to be that between man and God, which Christ did slay on the cross, and which being brought to an end, the separation between Jew and Gentile, which was the result of it, was done away)<b> thereby</b> (or,<b> in</b> or<b> on it</b>: viz. the cross: compare Col. ii. 15, notes: not<i> in His body</i>: see above):<b> and having come, He preached</b> (how? when? Obviously after his death, because by that death the peace was wrought. We seek in vain for any such announcement made by Him in person after his resurrection. But we find a key to the expression in John xiv. 18: see also ver. 28. And this coming was,—by his Spirit poured out on the Church. There is an expression of St. Paul’s, singularly parallel with this, and of itself strongly corroborative of the genuineness of our Epistle; in Acts xxvi. 23: “<i>That Christ should suffer, and that He should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</i>” This coming therefore is by His Spirit [see on ver. 18], and minis-ters, and ordinances in the Church)<b> peace to you who were far off, and peace to those</b> (not ‘<i>to us</i>,’ for fear of still upholding the distinction where he wishes to merge it altogether)<b> that were nigh</b> (this<b> peace</b> is plainly then not mere mutual reconciliation, but that far greater peace which was effected by Christ’s death, peace with God, which necessitated the union of the far off and the near in one body in Him. This is shewn especially by the repetition of the word<b> peace</b>. See Isa. lvii. 19.—Then follows the empowering reason, why he should preach<i> peace</i> to us both: and it is this ver. 18 especially which cannot be satisfied on the ordinary hypothesis of mere reconciliation between Jew and Gentile being the subject in the former verses. Here clearly the union [not reconciliation, nor is enmity predicated of them] of Jew and Gentile is subordinated to the blessed fact of an access TO GOD having been provided for both through Christ by the Spirit),
