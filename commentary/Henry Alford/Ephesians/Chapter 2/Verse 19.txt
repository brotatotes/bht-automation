<b> 19</b>.]<b> So then ye no longer are strangers and sojourners</b> ( ‘sojourners,’ as dwelling among the Jews, but not numbered with them),<b> but are fellow-citizens with the saints</b> (<i>comrades, co-citizens</i>, of the saints.<b> the saints</b> are not<i> angels</i>, not<i> Jews</i>, nor<i> Christians then alive</i> merely, but the saints of God in the widest sense,—all members of the mystical body of Christ,—the commonwealth of the spiritual Israel),<b> and of the household</b> (i. e. ‘members of God’s family,’ in the usual sense of the word)<b> of God; having been built up</b> (literally,<b> built above</b>: we cannot express this in one word: we have the substantive ‘super-structure,’ but no verb corresponding. There is a transition from one image, a political and social, to another, a material)<b> upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets</b> (how is this genitive to be understood? Is it a genitive of apposition, so that the Apostles and Prophets themselves<i> are</i> the foundation? This has been supposed by numerous Commentators, from Chrysostom to De Wette. But, not to mention the very many other objections which have been well and often urged against this view, this one is to my mind decisive,—that it entirely destroys the imagery of the passage. The temple, into which these Gentiles were built, is the mystical body of the Son, in which the Father dwells by the Spirit, ver. 22. The Apostles and Prophets [see below], yea, Jesus Christ Himself, as the great inclusive Head Corner Stone (see again below], are also built into this temple. [That He includes likewise the<i> foundation</i>, and IS the foundation, is true, and must be remembered, but is not prominent here.] Clearly then the Apostles and Prophets cannot<i> be</i> the foundation, being here spoken of as parts of the upper building, together with these Gentiles, and with Jesus Christ Himself. But again, does the genitive mean, the foundation which the Apostles and Prophets<i> have laid</i>? So also very many Commentators. As clearly,—not thus. To introduce them here as<i> agents</i>, is as inconsistent as the other. No agents are here spoken of, but merely the fact of the great building in its several parts being built up together. The only remaining interpretation then is, to regard the genitive as simply possessive: ‘<i>the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,</i>’— ‘<i>the Apostles’ and Prophets’ foundation</i>’—that upon which they as well as your-selves are built. This explanation, which I find ascribed to Bucer only, seems to me beyond question the right one. See more below.—But (2)<i> who are the</i><b> prophets</b>? They have commonly been taken, without enquiry, as the<i> Old Test. prophets</i>. And certainly, the sense, with some little straining, would admit of this view. They may be said to be built upon Christ, as belonging to that widest acceptation of His mystical body, in which it includes all the saints, Old as well as New Test. But besides the objections arising from the form of the sentence, which the English reader cannot appreciate, there is this weighty one: the usage of the expression<b> apostles and prophets</b> in ch. ili. 5. There unquestionably the prophets are New Test.<b> prophets</b>; and again in ch. iv. 11, And it is difficult to conceive that the Apostle should have used the two words conjoined here, in a different sense. Even stronger is the consideration arising from the whole sense of the passage. All here is strictly Christian,—post-Judaic,—consequent on Christ’s death, and triumph, and His coming preaching peace by the Spirit to the united family of man. So that we must decide for these prophets being<i> New Test. prophets</i>: those who ranked next to the Apostles in the government of the church: see Acts xi. 27, note. They were not in every case distinct from the Apostles: the apostleship probably always including the gift of<i> prophecy</i>: so that all the Apostles themselves might likewise have been<i> prophets</i>),<b> Christ Jesus Himself</b> (the<b> Himself</b> exalts the dignity of the temple, in that not only it has among its stones Apostles and prophets, but the Lord Himself is built into it)<b> being the Head corner stone</b> (see, besides reff., Jer. li. 26; Acts iv. 11. The reference here is clearly to that Headstone of the Corner, which is not only the most conspicuous but the most important in the building: “which, being placed in the corner, joins and rules the two walls of the building.” Builders set up such a stone, or build such a pillar of brick, before getting up their walls, to rule and square them by. I must again repeat, that the fact of Jesus Christ being Himself the<i> foundation</i>, however it underlies the whole, is not to be brought in as interfering with this portion of the figure);
