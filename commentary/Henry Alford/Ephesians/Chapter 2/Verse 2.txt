<b> 2.</b>]<b> in which</b> (viz.<i> sins</i>, the last substantive, but applying in fact to both)<b> ye once walked</b> (we hardly need, as some, go back every time to the figure in the word<b> walked</b>—the word has become with the Apostle so common in its figurative sense)<b> accord-ing to</b> (after the leading of, conformably to)<b> the course</b> (so A.V.: the very best word, as so often. The original word is<b> the age</b>, compounded of its temporal and its ethical sense: it is not exactly ‘<i>lifetime</i>, ‘duration,’ nor again ‘fashion,’ ‘spirit,’ but some common term which will admit of being both temporally and ethically characterized,— ‘career’ or ‘course’)<b> of this world</b> (St. Paul generally uses “<b>the</b><i> world</i>,” but has “<b>this</b><i> world</i>” in 1 Cor. iii. 19; v. 10; vii. 31. It designates the present system of things, as alien from God, and lying in the evil one),<b> according to the ruler of the power</b> (so literally: see below)<b> of the air</b> (the devil—the<i> god</i><i> of this world</i>, 2 Cor. iv. 4, is clearly meant: but it is difficult exactly to dissect the phrase, and give each word its proper meaning.<i> The power</i> appears to be used here to represent the<i> aggregate</i> of those in power: as we say, ‘the government.’ St. Paul is supposed by many to have spoken in accordance with Rabbinical, or even with Pythagorean notions. But I am disposed to seek my interpretation of the words from a much more obvious source: viz. the persuasion and common parlance of mankind, founded on analogy with well known facts. We are tempted by evil spirits, who have access to us, and suggest thoughts and desires to our minds. We are surrounded by the air, which is the vehicle of speech and of all suggestions to our senses. Tried continually as we are by these temptations, what so natural, as to assign to their ministers a dwelling in, and power over that element which is the vehicle of them to us? And thus our Lord, in the parable of the sower, when He would represent the devil coming and taking away the seed out of the heart, figures him by<i> the birds of the air</i> (or,<i> of heaven</i>). The Apostle then, in using this expression, would be appealing to the common feeling of his readers, not to any recondite or questionable system of dæmonology. That traces are found in such systems, of a belief agreeing with this, is merely a proof that they have embodied the same general feeling, and may be used in illustration, not as the ground, of the Apostle’s saying),<b> of the spirit</b> (<i>the power</i> being used as designating [see above] the personal aggregate of those evil ones who have this power,<b> the spirit</b>, in apposition with it, represents their aggregate character, as an influence on the human mind, a spirit of ungodliness and disobedience,—the “<i>spirit of the world</i>” of 1 Cor. ii. 12,—the aggregate of the “<i>seducing spirits</i>” of 1 Tim. iv. 1)<b> which is now</b> (i. e. ‘still:’ contrast to “<i>once</i>,’—to<i> you</i>, who have escaped from his government above)<b> working in the sons of</b> (the expression is a Hebraism, but is strictly reproduced in the fact: that of which they are sons, is the source and spring of their lives, not merely an accidental quality belonging to them)<b> disobedience</b>:
