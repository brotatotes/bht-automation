Both participle and verb imply that the fitting together and the growing are still going on: and the only way which we in English have to mark this so as to avoid the chance of mistake, is by the auxiliary verb substantive, and the participle. The bare present, ‘groweth,’ is in danger of being mistaken for the abstract quality, and the temporal development is thus lost sight of: whereas the other, in giving prominence to that temporal development, also necessarily implies the ‘normal, perpetual, unconditioned nature of the organic increase’)<b> unto an holy temple in the Lord</b> (i. e. according to apostolic usage, and the sense of the whole passage, ‘<i>in Christ</i>.’ These “<i>in whom</i>,”— “<i>in the Lord</i>,” “<i>in whom</i>,”—like the frequent repetitions of the name<i> Christ</i> in vv. 12, 13, are used by the Apostle to lay all stress on the fact that Christ is the inclusive Head of all the building, the element in which it has its being and its growth.
