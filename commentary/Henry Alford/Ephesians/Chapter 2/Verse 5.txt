<b> 5</b>.]<b> even when we were dead in our trespasses</b> (see on ver. 1),<b> vivified</b> (or,<b> quickened</b>: not, as A.V.,<i> ‘hath</i> quickened’—a definite act in time, not an abiding consequence is spoken of)<b> us together with Christ</b> (Christ was THE RESURRECTION and the Life, and we follow in and because of Him. The disputes about the meaning of this<i> vivifying</i>, or<i> quickening</i>, have arisen from not bearing in mind the relation in New Test. language between natural and spiritual death. We have often had occasion to observe that spiritual death in the New Test. includes in it and bears with it natural death as a consequence, to such an extent that this latter is often not thought of as worth mentioning: see especially John xi. 25, 26, which is the key-text for all passages regarding life in Christ. So here—God vivified us together with Christ: in the one act and fact of His Resurrection He raised all His people—to spiritual life, and in that to victory over death, both spiritual, and therefore necessarily physical also. To dispute therefore whether such an expression as this is past [spiritual], or future [physical], is to forget that the whole includes its parts. Our<i> spiritual life</i> is the primary subject of the Apostle’s thought: but this includes in itself our share in the Resurrection and exaltation [ver. 6] of Christ. The three past tenses, “<i>quickened</i>,”<i> “raised up,</i>” “<i>made to sit,</i>” are all anticipatory as regards the actual fact in each man, but equally describe a past and accomplished act on God’s part when He raised up Christ)—<b>by grace ye have been saved</b> (this insertion in the midst of the mention of such great unmerited mercies to us sinners, is meant emphatically to call the reader’s attention to so cogent a proof of that which the Apostle ever preached as the great foundation truth of the Gospel. Notice the perfect, ‘<i>have been saved,</i>’ not, ‘<i>are being saved,</i>’ because we<i> have passed</i> from death unto life: salvation is to the Christian<i> not a future but a past thing,</i> realized in the present by faith)—<br><br><b>6</b>.]<b> and raised us together with Him</b> (the Resurrection of Christ being the next. event consequent on His vivification in the tomb),<b> and seated us together with Him</b> (the Ascension being the completion of the Resurrection. So that all three verbs refer strictly to the same work wrought on Christ, and in Christ on all His mystical Body, the Church)<b> in the heavenly places</b> (see on ch. i. 3, 20)<b> in Christ Jesus</b> (as again specifying the element in which, as united and included in which, we have these blessings which have been enumerated. It is an additional qualification, and recalls the mind to the fact of our union in Him as the medium of our resurrection and glorification.—The disputes as to whether these are to be taken as present or future, actual or potential, literal or spiritual, will easily be disposed of by those who have apprehended the truth of the believer’s union in and with Christ. All these we have, in fact and reality [see Phil. iii. 20], in their highest, and therefore in all lower senses, in Him: they were ours, when they were His: but for their fulness in possession we are waiting till He come, when we shall be like and with Him):<br><br><b> 7</b>.)<b> that He might show forth</b> (see Rom. ix. 23. The original implies, that the exhibition is for His own purpose, for His own glory [see ch. i. 6, 12, 14]—compare note on Col. ii, 15)<b> in the ages which are hereafter to come</b> (what are they? the future periods of the Church’s earthly career,—or the ages of the glorified Church hereafter? The answer must be given by comparing this with the very similar expression in Col. i. 26, 27, where it is manifest (1) that the<i> ages</i> from which the mystery was hidden are the past ages of this world; (2) that those to whom, as here, God will make known the riches of His glory, are His saints, i.e. His church on earth. Therefore I conceivé we are compelled to interpret analogously: viz. to understand the “<i>ages to come</i>” of the coming ages of the church, and the per-sons involved in them to be the future members of the church. Thus the mean-ing will be nearly as in ch. i, 12.—The supposed reference to the future state of glory seems not to agree with<i> the language here</i>,—nor with the fact that the second coming and future kingdom of Christ are hardly ever alluded to in this Epistle)<b> the exceeding riches of His grace in</b> (of the material of which this display of His grace will consist, the department in which it will find its exercise)<b> kindness</b> (see especially Rom. ii. 4) towards us in see ‘<i>through</i>’ as A.V.)<b> Christ Jesus</b> (again and again he repeats this “<i>in Christ Jesus</i>:” HE is the great centre of the Epistle, towards whom all the rays of thought converge, and from whom all blessings flow; and this the Apostle will have his readers never forget).
