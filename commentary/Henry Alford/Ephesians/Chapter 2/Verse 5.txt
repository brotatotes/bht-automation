The disputes about the meaning of this<i> vivifying</i>, or<i> quickening</i>, have arisen from not bearing in mind the relation in New Test. language between natural and spiritual death. We have often had occasion to observe that spiritual death in the New Test. includes in it and bears with it natural death as a consequence, to such an extent that this latter is often not thought of as worth mentioning: see especially John xi. 25, 26, which is the key-text for all passages regarding life in Christ. So here—God vivified us together with Christ: in the one act and fact of His Resurrection He raised all His people—to spiritual life, and in that to victory over death, both spiritual, and therefore necessarily physical also. To dispute therefore whether such an expression as this is past [spiritual], or future [physical], is to forget that the whole includes its parts. Our<i> spiritual life</i> is the primary subject of the Apostle’s thought: but this includes in itself our share in the Resurrection and exaltation [ver. 6] of Christ. The three past tenses, “<i>quickened</i>,”<i> “raised up,</i>” “<i>made to sit,</i>” are all anticipatory as regards the actual fact in each man, but equally describe a past and accomplished act on God’s part when He raised up Christ)—<b>by grace ye have been saved</b> (this insertion in the midst of the mention of such great unmerited mercies to us sinners, is meant emphatically to call the reader’s attention to so cogent a proof of that which the Apostle ever preached as the great foundation truth of the Gospel. Notice the perfect, ‘<i>have been saved,</i>’ not, ‘<i>are being saved,</i>’ because we<i> have passed</i> from death unto life: salvation is to the Christian<i> not a future but a past thing,</i> realized in the present by faith)—
