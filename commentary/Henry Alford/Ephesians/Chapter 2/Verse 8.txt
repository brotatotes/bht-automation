<p><strong> 8</strong> .] <strong> For by grace</strong> (the article shews us the import of the sentence to take up and expand the parenthetic clause χάριτί ἐστε σεσωσμένοι above: but not barely so: that clause itself was inserted on account of the matter in hand being a notable example of the fact, and this γάρ takes up also that matter in hand the ὑπερβάλλον πλοῦτος κ . τ . λ ) <strong> ye are</strong> (perf.) <strong> saved, through</strong> [ <strong> your</strong> ] (or [ <em> the</em> ], but the possessive article is preferable, see below: ‘the’ would make both objective. The abstract, ‘ <em> through faith</em> ,’ must be the rendering if the article be omitted) <strong> faith</strong> (the dative above expressed the objective instrumental condition of your salvation, this <strong> διὰ</strong> the subjective medial condition: it has been effected by grace and apprehended by faith): <strong> and this</strong> (not <em> your faith</em> , as Chrys. οὐδὲ ἡ πίστις , φησίν , ἐξ ὑμῶν : so Thdrt., al., Corn.-a-Iap., Beza, Est., Grot., Beng., all.; this is precluded (not by the gender of τοῦτο , but) by the manifestly parallel clauses οὐκ ἐξ ὑμῶν and οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων , of which the latter would be irrelevant as asserted of πίστις , and the reference of Eph 2:9 must therefore be changed: but, as Calv., Calov., Rück., Harl., Olsh., Mey., De W., Stier, al., ‘your salvation;’ τὸ σεσωσμένοι εἶναι , as Ellic.) <strong> not of yourselves</strong> , GOD’S (emphatic) <strong> is the gift</strong> (not, as E.
