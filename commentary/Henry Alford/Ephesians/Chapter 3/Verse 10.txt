For this sublime cause the humble Paul was raised up,—to bring about,—he, the least worthy of the saints,—that to the heavenly powers themselves should be made known, by means of those whom he was empowered to enlighten, &c.)<b> there might be made known</b> (emphatic, as opposed to “<i>hidden</i>,” above— ‘uo longer hidden, but.”)<b> now</b> (has the secondary emphasis: opposed to “<i>from the beginning of the ages”</i>)<b> to the governments and to the powers</b> (see ch. i. 21 and note)<b> in the heavenly places</b> (see ch. i. 3 note.<b> The governments</b> and the<b> powers</b> are those of the holy angels in heaven: not, as has been vainly imagined<i> Jewish rulers, Christian rulers</i>, or<i> good and bad angels</i>.
