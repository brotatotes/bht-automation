<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> Wherefore</strong> (‘quæ cum ita sint,’ viz. the glorious things spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1-12">Ephesians 3:1-12</span> : and especially his own personal part in them, ἐγὼ π ., ἐμοὶ ἐδόθη , ἐγενήθην διάκονος : since I am the appointed minister of so great a matter) <strong> I beseech you</strong> (not, beseech <em> God</em> , which would awkwardly necessitate a new subject before ἐγκακεῖν : see below) <strong> not to be dispirited</strong> (not, ‘ <em> that I may not be dispirited</em> ,’ as Syr., Thdrt., Beng., Rück., Harl., Olsh. Such a reference is quite refuted by the reason rendered below, ἥτις ἐσ . <strong> δὸξα ὑμων</strong> , and by the insertion of μου after θλ ., which in this case would be wholly superfluous: not to mention its inconsistency with all we know of the Apostle himself) <strong> in</strong> (of the element or sphere, in which the faint-heartedness would be shewn: ‘ <em> in the midst of</em> ’) <strong> my tribulations for you</strong> (the grammatical Commentators justify the absence of the article before <strong> ὑπέρ</strong> by the construction θλίβομαι ὑπέρ τινος . This surely is not necessary, in the presence of such expressions as τοῖς κυρίοις κατὰ σάρκα , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:5">Ephesians 6:5</span> . The strange view of Harl., that ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν is to be joined with αἰτοῦμαι , needs no refutation), <strong> seeing that they are</strong> (not ‘ <em> which is</em> ;’ <strong> ἥτις</strong> is not = ἡ , but = ‘quippe qui,’ ‘utpote qui:’ see examples in Palm and Rost’s Lex. ὅς , p. 547) <strong> your glory</strong> ( πῶς ἐστι δόξα αὐτῶν ; ὅτι οὕτως αὐτοὺς ἠγάπησεν ὁ θεός , ὥστε καὶ τ . υἱὸν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν δοῦναι , κ . τοὺς δούλους κακοῦν . ἵνα γὰρ αὐτοὶ τύχωσι τοσούτων ἀγαθῶν , Παῦλος ἐδεσμεῖτο , Chrys. Bengel compares ὑμεῖς ἔνδοξοι , ἡμεῖς δὲ ἄτιμοι , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:10">1 Corinthians 4:10</span> : and this certainly seems against Stier’s notion that δόξα ὑμῶν means ‘your <em> glorification</em> ,’ ‘the glory of God in you’).</p>
