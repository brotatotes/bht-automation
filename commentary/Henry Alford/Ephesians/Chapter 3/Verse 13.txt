 13 .]  Wherefore (‘quæ cum ita sint,’ viz. the glorious things spoken of Ephesians 3:1-12 : and especially his own personal part in them, ἐγὼ π ., ἐμοὶ ἐδόθη , ἐγενήθην διάκονος : since I am the appointed minister of so great a matter)  I beseech you (not, beseech  God , which would awkwardly necessitate a new subject before ἐγκακεῖν : see below)  not to be dispirited (not, ‘  that I may not be dispirited ,’ as Syr., Thdrt., Beng., Rück., Harl., Olsh. Such a reference is quite refuted by the reason rendered below, ἥτις ἐσ .  δὸξα ὑμων , and by the insertion of μου after θλ ., which in this case would be wholly superfluous: not to mention its inconsistency with all we know of the Apostle himself)  in (of the element or sphere, in which the faint-heartedness would be shewn: ‘  in the midst of ’)  my tribulations for you (the grammatical Commentators justify the absence of the article before  ὑπέρ by the construction θλίβομαι ὑπέρ τινος . This surely is not necessary, in the presence of such expressions as τοῖς κυρίοις κατὰ σάρκα , ch. Ephesians 6:5 . The strange view of Harl., that ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν is to be joined with αἰτοῦμαι , needs no refutation),  seeing that they are (not ‘  which is ;’  ἥτις is not = ἡ , but = ‘quippe qui,’ ‘utpote qui:’ see examples in Palm and Rost’s Lex. ὅς , p. 547)  your glory ( πῶς ἐστι δόξα αὐτῶν ; ὅτι οὕτως αὐτοὺς ἠγάπησεν ὁ θεός , ὥστε καὶ τ . υἱὸν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν δοῦναι , κ . τοὺς δούλους κακοῦν . ἵνα γὰρ αὐτοὶ τύχωσι τοσούτων ἀγαθῶν , Παῦλος ἐδεσμεῖτο , Chrys. Bengel compares ὑμεῖς ἔνδοξοι , ἡμεῖς δὲ ἄτιμοι , 1 Corinthians 4:10 : and this certainly seems against Stier’s notion that δόξα ὑμῶν means ‘your  glorification ,’ ‘the glory of God in you’).
