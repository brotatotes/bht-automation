<b> 15</b>.]<b> from whom</b> (as the source of the<i> name</i>. In Greek, Father is “pater,” Family is “patria,” derived from<i> pater</i>. This must be lost to the English reader. See more below)<b> every family</b> (not ‘<i>the whole family’</i> as A.Y., which is an ungrammatical rendering. The sense, see below)<b> in the heavens and on earth is named</b> (it is difficult to convey in another language any trace of the deep connexion of<i> pater</i> and<i> patria</i> here expressed. Had the sentence been ‘the<i> Creator</i>, after whom every<i> creature</i> in heaven and earth is named,’ all would be plain to the English reader. But we must not thus render; for it is not in virtue of God’s creative power that the Apostle here prays to Him, but in virtue of His adoptive love in Christ. It is best therefore to keep the simple sense of the words, and leave it to explanation to convey the idea,<b> Patria</b> is the<i> family</i> (or in a wider sense, as the Romans named it, the<i> gens</i>), named so from its all having one<b> pater</b>. It is not easy to say, to what the reference is, or why the idea is here introduced. The Apostle seems, regarding God as the Father of us His adopted children in Christ, to go forth into the fact, that He, in this His relation to us, is in reality the great original and prototype of the paternal relation, wherever found. And this he does, by observing that every<b> patria</b>,<i> compaternity</i>, body of persons, having a common father, is thus named [in Greek],<i> from that father</i>,—and so every earthly [and heavenly] family reflects in its name [and constitution] the being and sourceship of the great Father Himself. But then, what are<i> families in heaven</i>? Some have treated the idea of paternity<i> there</i> as absurd: but is it not necessarily involved in<i> any</i> explanation of this passage? He Himself is the Father of spirits, Heb. xii, 9, the Father of lights, James i. 17:—may there not be fathers in the heavenly Israel; as in the earthly? May not the holy Angels be bound up in spiritual<i> families</i>, though they marry not nor are given in marriage?),
