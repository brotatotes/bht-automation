If the καί be omitted, beware of rendering ‘  in the Church which is in Christ Jesus ,’ which would not only require the article (cf. Galatians 1:22 , ταῖς ἐκκλ . τῆς Ἰουδαίας ταῖς ἐν χριστῷ ), but would make  ἐν χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ superfluous. As the text stands, we need not say that  ἐν χρ  .   Ἰησ  . is a second independent clause: it belongs to  ἐν τῇ ἐκκ  . as inclusive of it, though not as descriptive of ἐκκλ .: ‘in the Church and (thus) in Christ Jesus’)  to all the generations of the age of the ages (probably as Grot., ‘augendi causa duas locutiones Hebraicas miscuit Apostolus, quarum prior est ἀπὸ γενεᾶς εἰς γενεάν , לְדֹר וָדֹר , Psalms 10:6 , altera ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος עוֹלְמֵי עַד , Isaiah 45:17 .’ Probably the account of the meaning is, that the  age of ages (eternity) is conceived as containing ages, just as our ‘age’ contains years: and then those ages are thought of as made up, like ours, of generations. Like the similar expression, αἰῶνες τῶν αἰώνων , it is used, by a transfer of what we know in time, to express, imperfectly, and indeed improperly, the idea of Eternity).
