Olshausen says, “It is certainly peculiar, that Paul here calls the Apostles, and consequently himself among them, ‘holy Apostles.” It is going too far when De Wette finds in this a sign of an unapostolic origin of the Epistle: but still the expression remains an unusual one. I account for it to myself thus,—that Paul here conceives of the Apostles and Prophets as a corporation (cf. ch. iv. 11), and as such, in their official character, he gives them the predicate<i> holy</i>, as he names believers, conceived as a whole,<i> ‘holy’</i> or ‘<i>sanctified</i>’ but never an individual”)<b> Apostles and Prophets</b> (as in ch. ii. 20, the New Test.
