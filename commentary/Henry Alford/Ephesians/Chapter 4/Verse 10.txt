 10 .]  He that descended, He (and no other: οὐ γὰρ ἄλλος κατελήλυθεν κ . ἄλλος ἀνελήλυθεν , Thdrt. αὐτός is the subject, and not the predicate ( ὁ αὐτός ))  is also he that ascended (see again Joh 3:13 )  up above (reff.)  all the heavens (cf. Hebrews 7:26 , ὑψηλότερος τῶν οὐρανῶν γενόμενος : and Hebrews 4:14 , διεληλυθότα τοὺς οὐρανούς . It is natural that one who, like St. Paul, had been brought up in the Jewish habits of thought, should still use their methods of speaking, according to which the heaven is expressed in the plural, ‘  the heavens .’ And from such an usage, πάντες οἱ οὐρανοί would naturally flow. See, on the idea of a threefold, or sevenfold division of the heavens, the note on 2 Corinthians 12:2 . Ellicott quotes from Bishop Pearson, ‘whatsoever heaven is higher than all the rest which are called heavens, into that place did he ascend.’ Notice the subjunctive after the aorist participle, giving the present and enduring sense to the verb: used, when “res ita comparata est, ut actione præterita tamen eventus noudmn expletus sit, sed etiam nunc duret: … Eur. Med. 215, Κορίνθιαι γυναῖκες , ἐξῆλθον δόμων , μή μοί τι μέμφησθʼ .” Klotz, Devar. ii. 618), that  He may fill (not as Anselm, al., ‘  fulfil ’)  all things (the whole universe: see ch. Ephesians 1:23 , note: with His presence, His sovereignty, His working by the Spirit: not, with His glorified Body, as some have thought. “Christ is perfect God, and perfect and glorified man: as the former He is present every where, as the latter He can be present any where.” Ellicott).
