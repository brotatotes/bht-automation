<b> 10</b>.]<b> He that descended, He</b> (and no other: “for it was not one that descended, and another that ascended,” Theodoret).<b> is also He that ascended</b> (in English idiom, we must express it as in the text; see again John iii. 18)<b> up above</b> (see on ch. i. 21)<b> all the heavens</b> (compare Heb. vii. 26, ‘<i>made higher than the heavens</i>:” and iv. 14, “<i>that has passed through the heavens</i>.” It is natural that one who, like St. Paul, had been brought up in the Jewish habits of thought, should still use their methods of speaking, according to which the heaven is expressed in the<br><br> plural,<i> ‘the heavens’</i> And from such an usage “<b>all</b><i> the heavens</i>” would naturally flow. See, on the idea of a threefold, or sevenfold division of the heavens, the note on 2 Cor. xii. 2. Ellicott quotes from Bishop Pearson,— ‘Whatsoever heaven is higher than all the rest which are called heavens, into that place did he ascend’),<b> that He might fill</b> (not<i> ‘fulfil’</i>)<b> all things</b> (the whole universe: see ch, i. 23, note: with His presence, His sovereignty, His working by the Spirit: not, with His glorified Body, as some have thought. “Christ is perfect God, and perfect and glorified man: as the former He is present every where, as the latter He can be present any where.” Ellicott).
