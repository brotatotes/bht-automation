<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <strong> but</strong> (opposition to the <em> whole</em> last verse; introducing as it does, not only ἀληθεύοντες ἐν ἀγάπῃ , but the αὐξήσωμεν below) <strong> being followers of truth</strong> ( <strong> ἀληθεύειν</strong> cannot here mean merely to <em> speak the truth</em> , as the whole matter dealt with is more general; the particular follows, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:25">Ephesians 4:25</span> . The verb has the widest meaning of <em> being</em> ἀληθής and (as Stier remarks) not without a certain sense of effort, ‘ <em> sectari veritatem</em> .’ The Vulg. gives it well, but perhaps with too exclusively practical a bearing, ‘ <em> veritatem facientes</em> :’ Bengel, ‘ <em> verantes</em> :’ the old English versions, ‘ <em> folowe the truth</em> ,’ which gives too much the objective sense to truth. It is almost impossible to express it satisfactorily in English. I have somewhat modified this last rendering, restoring the general sense of ‘truth.’ The objection to ‘followers of truth’ is that it may be mistaken for ‘searchers after truth’ but I can find no expression which does not lie open to equal objection) <strong> in love</strong> (must be joined with ἀληθεύοντες , not with αὐξήσωμεν . For 1) the mere participle with δέ would stand most feebly and awkwardly at the beginning of the sentence: and 2) we have already observed the habit of the Apostle to be, to subjoin, not to prefix, his qualifying clauses. <strong> ἐν ἀγάπη</strong> is added, as the element in which the Christian ἀληθεύειν must take place: it is not and cannot be an ἀληθεύειν at all hazards a ‘fiat justitia, ruat cœlum’ truthfulness: but must be conditioned by love: a true-seeking and true-being with loving caution and kind allowance not breaking up, but cementing, brotherly love by walking in truth) <strong> may grow up into</strong> (increase towards the measure of the stature of; to the perfect man in Him. Again an allusion to the incorporation of all the Church in Christ: see below) <strong> Him in all things</strong> (accusative of reference; the article implying, in every department of our growth, ‘in all things wherein we grow,’ as Meyer) <strong> who is the Head</strong> (see ch. Eph 1:22 ), <strong> namely, Christ</strong> (the nominative is best regarded as an attraction to the <em> foregoing</em> relative, just as in ‘urbem quam statuo vestra est’ the substantive is attracted to the <em> following</em> relative. So we have, Eur. Hecub. 754, πρὸς ἄνδρ ʼ, ὃς ἄρχει τῆσδε Πολυμήστωρ χθονός : and Plato, Apol. p. 41 A, εὑρήσει τοὺς ὡς ἀληθῶς δικαστάς , υἵπερ κ . λέγονται ἐκεῖ δικάζειν , Μίνως τε καὶ Ῥαδάμανθυς κ . Αἴακος . In the face of these examples, there is no occasion, with De W. and Ellic., to suppose that the Apostle places χρ . at the end to give force to ἐξ οὗ which follows. Beware of Eadie’s rendering, ‘who is the Head, the ( ὁ χρ .) Christ,’ as alien from any design apparent in the argument, or indeed in the Epistle),</p>
