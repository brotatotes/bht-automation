For the word, see on ch. Eph 2:21 ) <strong> and compounded</strong> (‘notat simul firmitudinem et consolidationem,’ Bengel), <strong> by means of every joint</strong> (to be joined, not with the participles preceding, but (see below) with τ . αὔξ . ποι ., as Chr., Thdrt., Beng., Mey., except that they understand ἁφή to mean αἴσθησις the perception of the vital energy imparted from the head ( τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἀπὸ τ . ἐγκεφάλου καταβαῖνον , τὸ διὰ τῶν νεύρων ), which is the cause of all growth to the body. But it seems hardly controvertible that ἁφή does signify ‘ <em> joint</em> ’ ( συναφή ) in the parallel <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+2:19">Colossians 2:19</span> ; it is there (see note) joined with συνδεσμῶν so closely, as necessarily to fall into the same class of anatomical arrangements, and cannot mean αἴσθησις . Also in Damoxenus in Athenæus, iii. 102 E, we have it in this sense καὶ συμπλεκομένης οὐχὶ συμφώνους ἁφάς .

Love is just as much the element in which the edification, as that in which the growth, takes place).
