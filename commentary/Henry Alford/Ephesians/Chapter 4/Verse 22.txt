<p><strong> 22</strong> .] <strong> namely</strong> (the infinitive depends on <strong> ἐδιδάχθητε</strong> (not on λέγω , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:17">Ephesians 4:17</span> , as Bengel and Stier), and carries therefore (not in itself, but as thus dependent) an imperative force see on Eph 4:17 ) <strong> that ye put off</strong> (cf. ἐνδύσασθαι <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span> : aorist, because the act of putting off is one and decisive, so also of ἐνδύσασθαι below: but ἀνανεοῦσθαι , because the renewal is a gradual process. Beware of rendering, with Eadie and Peile, ‘ <em> that ye have put off</em> ,’ which is inconsistent with the context (cf. Eph 4:25 ), and not justified by ὑμᾶς being expressed. This latter is done merely to resume the subject after the parenthetical Eph 4:21 ), <strong> as regards your former conversation</strong> (explains the reference of ἀποθέσθαι : q. d. (for you were clothed with it in your former conversation): and must not, as by Œc., Jer., Grot., Est., al., be joined with τὸν παλ . ἄνθρ .: on <strong> ἀναστρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , see note, Gal 1:13 ), <strong> the old man</strong> (your former unconverted selves, see note on Rom 6:6 ) <strong> which is</strong> (“almost, ‘ <em> as it is, &amp;c.</em> ,’ the participle having a slight causal force, and serving to superadd a further motive.” Ellic.) <strong> being corrupted</strong> (inasmuch as the whole clause is subjectively spoken of the παλ . ἄνθρ ., it is better to take <strong> φθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> (as usually) of inward ‘ <em> waxing corrupt</em> ,’ as in reff. (especially Jude), than of <em> destination to perdition</em> , as Mey., which would be introducing an outward objective element) <strong> according to</strong> (in conformity with; as might be expected under the guidance of) <strong> the lusts of deceit</strong> ( <strong> ἡ ἀπάτη</strong> is personified the lusts which are the servants, the instruments of deceit: cf. ἐκ χειλέων ἀπάτης μου , Jdt 9:10 . Beware of the unsatisfactory hendiadys, ‘ <em> deceitful lusts</em> ,’ E. V., which destroys the whole force and beauty of the contrast below to ὁσιότητι τῆς ἀληθείας ),</p>
