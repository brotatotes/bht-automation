The doctrine of the restoration to us of the divine image in Christ, as here implied, is not to be overlooked. Not the bare fact of Gen. i. 27, but the great truth which that fact represents, is alluded to. The image of God in Christ is a far more glorious thing than Adam ever had, or could have had: but still the being “<i>after the image of God</i>,”<i> “after God</i>,” is true of both)<b> in</b> (element, or sphere, of the character of the new man)<b> righteousness and holiness of the truth</b> (again, beware of ‘<i>true holiness,</i>’ A.V.—as destroying the whole antithesis and force of the words.

The adjectives and adverbs are connected, 1 Thess. ii. 10: Tit. 1. 8.<i> Righteousness</i> betokens a just relation among the powers of the soul within, and towards men and duties without. But<i> holiness</i> betokens the integrity of the spiritual life, and the piety towards God of which that is the condition. Hence both expressions together complete the idea of moral perfection [Matt. v. 48]. As here the<i> ethical side</i> of the divine image is brought out, Col. iii. 10 brings out the<i> intellectual</i>. The new birth alone leads to<i> perfect knowledge</i>; all knowledge which proceeds not from renewal of heart is but outward appearance: and of this kind was that among the false Colossian teachers.” Olshausen).
