 26 .]  Be ye angry and sin not (citation: see ref. Psa.: and that from the LXX, not from the Hebrew, which (see Hupfeld on the Psalms in loc.) means ‘  tremble (‘stand in awe,’ E. V.) and sin not.’ The first imperative, although jussive, is so in a weaker degree than the other: it is rather assumptive, than permissive.
	‘Be angry (if it must be so):’ as if he had said, 1 Corinthians 7:31 , χράσθε τῷ κόσμῳ τούτῳ (for that must be), καὶ μὴ καταχρᾶσθε .
