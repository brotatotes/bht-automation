<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <strong> one God</strong> (the unity is here consummated in its central Object: ‘hoc est præcipuum, quia inde manant reliqua omnia,’ Calv. But we must not miss the distinct witness to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity in these verses: going upwards, we have 1st, the One Spirit dwelling in the one body: 2nd, the One Lord appropriated by faith and professed in baptism: 3rd, One God and Father supreme, in whom all find their end and object) <strong> and Father of all</strong> (masculine: ‘of all within the Church,’ for so is clearly the <em> primary</em> meaning, where he is speaking distinctly of the Church: of all (Mey.) who have the υἱοθεσία . But it can hardly be doubted, that there is a further reference to the universal Father-ship of all men which indeed the Church only inherits in its fulness, others having fallen out of it by sin, but which nevertheless is just as absolutely true), <strong> who is over all</strong> (men, primarily; and from the following, men only, in this place. He is over all, in his <em> sovereignty as the</em> FATHER), <strong> and through all</strong> (men: in the co-extensiveness of Redemption by the Son with the whole nature of man: see on Eph 4:10 below, and ch. Eph 2:20-21 ) <strong> and in all</strong> (men: by the indwelling of the Spirit, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span> . So that I cannot but recognize, in these three carefully chosen expressions, a distinct allusion again to the Three Persons of the blessed Trinity. All these are the work of the Father: it is He who in direct sovereignty is over all He who is glorified in the filling of all things by the Son: He who is revealed by the witness of the indwelling Spirit. Many Commentators deny such a reference. Almost all agree in <strong> ἐν πᾶσιν</strong> representing the indwelling of the Spirit: the <strong> διὰ πάντων</strong> has been the principal stumbling-block: and is variously interpreted: by some, of God’s Providence, τουτέστιν , ὁ προνοῶν καὶ διοικῶν , Chrys., al.: by others, of His pervading presence by the Spirit, ‘spiritu sanctificationis diffusus est per omnia ecclesiæ membra,’ Calv.: by others, to the creation by the Son, ‘per quem omnia facta sunt’ (Aquin. in Ellic.): but this seems to be a conversion of διὰ πάντων into δι ʼ οὗ πάντες , as indeed Olsh. expressly does, ‘ <em> als Werfzeug¸ durch das die sind</em> .’ Irenæus, v. 18. 2, p. 315, gives the meaning thus, adopting the Trinitarian reference, but taking the πάντων both times as <em> neuter</em> , and reading ἐν πᾶσιν ἡμῖν : ‘super omnia quidem Pater, et ipse est caput Christi: per omnia autem verbum, et ipse est caput ecclesiæ: in omnibus autem nobis Spiritus, et ipse est aqua viva,’ &amp;c.).</p>
