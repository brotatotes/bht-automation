<b> 8</b>.]<b> Wherefore</b> (i. e., since the gift was bestowed by Christ on different men according to measure)<b> He</b> (viz. God, whose word the Scriptures are)<b> saith</b> (viz. in Ps. Ixviii. 18, see below. With the question as to the occasion and intent of that Psalm, we are not here concerned. It is a song of triumph, as ver. 1 [compare Numb. x. 33] shews, at some bringing up of the ark to the hill of Zion. It is<i> therefore</i> a Messianic Psalm. Every part of that ark, every stone of that hill, was full of spiritual meaning. Every note struck on the lyres of the sweet singers of Israel, is but part of a chord, deep and world-wide, sounding from the golden harps of redemption. The partial triumphs of David and Solomon only prefigured as in a prophetic mirror the universal and eternal triumph of the Incarnate Son of God.

In the Psalm, these would be, the captives from the then war, whatever it was: in the interpretation, they were God’s enemies, Satan and his hosts),<b> he gave gifts unto mankind</b> (the original meaning of the Hebrew is obscure. The sense (see my Greek Test.) seems to be, ‘<i>Thou hast taken gifts among men,</i>’ hast, as a victor, surrounded by thy victorious host, brought gifts home, spoils of—and the result of such reception would be naturally stated as the distribution of them among such hosts, and the people,—as indeed ver. 12 of the Psalm has already stated. And so the Chaldee paraphrast understood the words, interpreting the passage<i> of Moses</i>: ‘thou hast given gifts to the sons of men’).
