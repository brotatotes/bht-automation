<b> 9</b>.] Further explanation of this text.<b> But that He ascended, what is it</b> (does it imply)<b> except that He also</b> (as well)<b> descended into the lower parts of the earth</b> (the argument seems to be this: the Ascension here spoken of was not a first exaltation, but a<i> return</i> to heaven of one who dwelt in heaven: compare John iii, 13, which is in fact the key to these verses. The<i> ascent</i> implied a previous<i> descent</i>, This is the leading thought. But it is doubted<i> how far</i> the words the<b> lower parts of the earth</b> carry that descent, whether to earth merely, so that “<i>of the earth</i>” is the genitive of<i> apposition</i>, “<i>the lower parts</i>, which are<i> the earth</i>,”’—or to<i> Hades</i>, so that it is genitive of<i> possession</i>,<i> “the lower parts</i> which belong to the earth.” It cannot be said that the descent into hell would be irrelevant here,—or that our Lord ascended, not from Hades, but from the earth: for, the<i> fact of descent</i> being the primary thought, we have only to ask as above,<i> how far</i> that descent is carried in the Apostle’s mind. The greater the descent, the greater the ascent: and if the<i> captivity</i> consisted of Satan and his powers, the warfare in which they were taken captive would most naturally be contemplated in all its extent, as reaching to their habitation itself:— ‘this ascent, what does it imply but a descent, and that even to the lower parts of the earth from which the spoils of victory were fetched?’ And this meaning seems to be upheld by the words, “<i>that he might fill</i><b> all things</b>,” which follow, as well as by the contrast furnished by up above<b> all the heavens</b>.—This interpretation is upheld by most of the ancients, and some ot the best of the moderns: that of the Incarnation merely,<i> descent on earth</i>, by most of the moderns: that of Christ’s<i> death</i> [and burial], by Chrysostom and some others)?
