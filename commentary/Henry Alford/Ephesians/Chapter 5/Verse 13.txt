<b> 13.] But</b> (opposition to<i> things done</i><i> in secret</i>)<b> all things</b> (not only, all the things done<i> in secret</i>, as Ellicott after Jerome, al.: the Apostle is treating of the<i> general detecting power of light</i>, as is evident by the resumption of the all in the next clause)<b> being reproved are made manifest by the light: for every thing that is made manifest is light</b> (the meaning being, ‘the light of your Christian life, which will be by your reproof shed upon these deeds of darkness, will bring them out of the category of darkness into light’ ( “when it is manifested it becomes light,” Chrysostom]. They themselves were thus ‘once darkness,’ but having been ‘reproved’ by God’s Spirit, had become ‘light in the Lord.’ The A.V. is doubly wrong—1) in ‘<i>all things that are reproved</i>:’ 2) in ‘<i>whatsoever doth make manifest is light</i>’ [which is also an ungrammatical reading of the Greek]: besides that such a proposition has absolutely no meaning in the context).
