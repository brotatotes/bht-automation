<b> 14.] Wherefore</b> (this being so—seeing that every thing that is made manifest becomes light,—is shone upon by the detecting light of Christ,—objectively,—it only remains that the man should be shone upon<i> inwardly</i> by the same Christ revealed in his awakened heart. We have then in Scripture an exhortation to that effect)<b> He</b> (viz. God, in the Scripture: see ch. iv. 8 note. No other reading is allowable)<b> saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee</b> (<i>where is this citation to be found?</i> In the first place, by the introduction of the word<b> Christ</b> it is manifestly a<i> paraphrase</i>,<i> not an exact citation.</i> The Apostle cites, and had a perfect right to cite, the language of prophecy in the light of the fulfilment of prophecy: and that he is here doing so, the bare word ‘<i>Christ’</i> shews us beyond dispute. I insist on this, that it may be plainly shewn to be no shift in a difficulty, no hypothesis among hypotheses,—but the<i> necessary</i> inference from the form of the citation. This being so,—of what passage of the Old Test. is this a paraphrase? I answer, of Isa. lx. 1, 2. There, the Church is set forth as being in a state of darkness and of death [cf. lix. 10], and is exhorted to awake, and become light, for that her light is come, and the glory of Jehovah has arisen upon her).
