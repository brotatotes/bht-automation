Take heed then (there is not any immediate connexion with the last verse: but the  οὖν resumes from the περιπατεῖτε in Ephesians 5:8 , and that which followed it there)  how ye walk strictly (the construction is exactly as in ref. 1 Cor., ἕκαστος δὲ  βλεπέτω πῶς ἐποικοδομεῖ . ‘Take heed, of what sort your ἀκριβῶς περιπατεῖν is:’ the implication being, ‘take heed not only that your walk be exact, strict, but also  of what sort that strictness  is not only that you  have a rule, and  keep to it , but that that rule be the  best one.’ So that a double exhortation is involved.
