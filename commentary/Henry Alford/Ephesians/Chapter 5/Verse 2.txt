and</b> (shew it by this, that ye)<b> walk in love, as Christ also</b> (this comes even nearer: from the love of the Father who gave His Son, to that of the Son, the Personal manifestation of that love in, our humanity)<b> loved</b> (not, ‘<i>hath loved,</i>’ as A.V.)<b> us</b> (the appeal, with the reading<b> us</b>, is a general one, deduced from the universal relation of us all to Christ: with<b> you,</b> it is more a personal one to the Ephesians)<b>, and gave up Himself</b> (absolute; not to be joined with “<i>to God</i>”)<b> for us</b> (see note on Gal. iii. 13:— ‘<i>on our behalf</i>,’ in fact, but not necessarily here implied, ‘<i>in our stead</i>’)<b> an offering and a sacrifice</b> (I believe the nearest approach to the truth in the question of the difference between<b> offering</b> and<b> sacrifice</b> will be made by regarding<b> offering</b> as the more general word, including all kinds of offering,—<b>sacrifice</b> as the more special one, usually involving the death of a victim. The great prominent idea here is the<i> one</i> sacrifice, which the Son of God made of Himself in his redeeming Love, in our nature—bringing it, in Himself, near to God—offering Himself as our representative Head: whether in perfect righteousness of life, or in sacrifice, properly so called, at his Death)<b> to God</b> (to be joined with the substantives “<i>offering</i>” and “<i>sacrifice</i>,” not with the verb,<i> gave Himself up</i>)<b> for an odour of sweet smell</b> (the question so much discussed, whether these words can apply to a sin-offering strictly so called, is an irrelevant one here. It is not [see above] the<i> death</i> of Christ which is treated of, but the whole process of His redeeming love. His death lies in the background, as one, and the chief, of the acknowledged facts of that process: but it does not give the character to what is here predicated of Him. The allusion primarily is to Gen. viii. 21, where after Noah had brought to God a sacrifice of every clean beast ‘and bird, “<i>the Lord smelled a sweet savour,</i>”—and the promise followed, that He would no more destroy the earth for man’s sake).
