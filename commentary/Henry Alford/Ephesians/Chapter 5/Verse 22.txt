<b> 22—VI. 9.]</b> The Church, in her relation to Christ, comprehending and hallowing those earthly relations on which all social unity (and hers also) is founded, the Apostle proceeds to treat of the<i> three greatest of those:</i> that of<i> husband and wife</i> (vv. 22–33), that of<i> parent and child</i> (ch. vi. 1–4), that of<i> master and servant</i> (vi. 5–9).<br><br><b> 22.] Wives</b> (supply, as has been inserted, “<i>be subject</i>,” seeing that the subsequent address to husbands is in the 2nd person)<b>, unto your own husbands</b> (<b>own</b>, as we often use the word [e. g. ‘He murdered his own father’], to intensify the recognition of the relationship, and to suggest its duties: see 1 Cor. vii. 2: also John v. 18)<b>, as unto the Lord</b> (i. e. ‘in obeying your husbands, obey the Lord:’ not merely as in all things we are to have regard to Him, but because, as below expanded, the husband stands peculiarly in Christ’s place. But he is not thus identified in power with Christ, nor the obedience, in its nature, with that which is owed to Him).<b> For an husband</b> (any husband, taken as an example)<b> is head of his wife, as also</b> (introducing identity of category)<b> Christ is head of the Bienth</b> (see for the sentiment, 1 Cor. xi. 3 note), (<i>being</i>, in His case—see below)<b> Himself Saviour of the Body</b> (i. e. ‘in Christ’s ease the Headship is united with, nay gained by, His having SAVED the body in the process of Redemption: so that I am not alleging Christ’s Headship as one entirely identical with that other, for He has a claim to it and office in it peculiar to Himself.’ “The man is not the saviour of his wife: in that, Christ excels him: hence ‘<i>nevertheless’</i> follows.” Bengel).
