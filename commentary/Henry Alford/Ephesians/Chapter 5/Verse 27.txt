<p><strong> 27</strong> .] <strong> that</strong> (further purpose of ἑαυτ . παρέδωκεν ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς ) <strong> He might Himself present to Himself</strong> (as a bride, see reff. 2 Cor.: not as a sacrifice (Harl.), which is quite against the context. The expression sets forth that the preparation of the Church for her bridal with Christ is exclusively by His own agency) <strong> the church glorious</strong> (the prefixed adjective is emphatic, which we lose in translation), <strong> not having spot</strong> (a late word τοῦτο φυλάττου , λέγε δὲ κηλίς Phryn. Lobeck 28, where see note. It is found in Dion. Hal., Plut., Lucian, &amp;c. The proper accentuation seems to be as in text, not σπῖλος . In Anthol. vi. 252, we have ἄσπιλον , ἀῤῥυτίδωτον , beginning a hexameter) <strong> or wrinkle</strong> ( ῥυτίς , ἡ συγκεκλυσμένη σάρξ , Etym. Mag.: from ( ἐ ) ρύω , see Palm and Rost, Lex. A classical word, see reff.), <strong> or any of such things, but that she may be holy</strong> (perfect in holiness) <strong> and blameless</strong> (see on both, note, ch. Eph 1:4 ). The <em> presentation</em> here spoken of is clearly, in its full sense, that future one at the Lord’s coming, so often treated under the image of a marriage (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:1">Matthew 22:1</span> ff; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1">Matthew 25:1</span> ff.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span> ff; Rev 21:2 al. fr.), not any progress of sanctification here below, as Harl., Beng., al., maintain (and Calv., commonly quoted on the other side: for he says on <strong> παραστήσῃ</strong> , ‘finem baptismi et ablutionis nostræ declarat: ut sancte et inculpate Deo vivamus’): however the progress towards this state of spotlessness in this life may sometimes be spoken of in its fulness and completion, or with reference to its proper qualities, not here found in their purity. Schöttgen quotes a rabbinical comment on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="so+1:5">Song of Solomon 1:5</span> : ‘Judæi de synagoga intelligunt, et sic explicant: nigra sum in hoc sæculo, sed decora in sæcuIo futuro.’</p>
