<b> 28.] Thus</b> (two ways of understanding this<b> thus</b> are open to us: 1) as referring back to Christ’s love for the church,— ‘Thus,’ ‘in like manner,’&c., as [being] ‘their own bodies:’ and 2) as referring forward to the similitude below,— ‘<i>Thus,</i>’ ‘<i>so</i>,’<i>&c</i>.,<i> as</i> [they love]<i> their own bodies.</i>” After weighing maturely what has been said on one side and the other, I cannot but decide for the latter, as most in accordance with the usage of St. Paul and with ver. 83: also as more simple. The sense remains substantially the same, and answers much better to the comment furnished by the succeeding clauses:—husbands ought to love their own wives as they love their own bodies [i. e., themselves: for their wives are in fact part of their own bodies, ver. 31]: this being illustrated by and referred to the great mystery of Christ and His church, in which the same love, and the same incorporation, has place)<b> ought the husbands also</b> (as well as Christ in the archetypal example just given)<b> to love their own</b> (emphatic: see above on ver. 22)<b> wives as</b> (with the same affection as)<b> their own bodies. He that loveth his own</b> (see above)<b> wife loveth himself</b> (is but complying with that universal law of nature by which we all love ourselves. The best words to supply before the following “<i>for</i>” will be, “And this we all do”).
