This reading necessarily confines the reference to <em> that one word</em> ) <strong> an idolater</strong> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5">Colossians 3:5</span> , which shews that even ὅς ἐστιν would apply to the πλεονέκτης only, not, as Stier, al., to the <em> three</em> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="job+31:24">Job 31:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+52:7">Psalms 52:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span> . Mey. remarks well, that it was very natural for St. Paul, whose forsaking of all things ( 2Co 6:10 ; 2Co 11:27 ) so strongly contrasted with selfish greediness, to mark with the deepest reprobation the sin of πλεονεξία ), <strong> hath not inheritance</strong> (the <em> present</em> implying more the fixedness of the exclusion, grounded on the eternal verities of that Kingdom, than mere future certainty: see 1Co 15:25 ) <strong> in the Kingdom of Christ and God</strong> (not ‘ <em> and of God</em> ’ ( <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τοῦ θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ) as E. V. No <em> distinction</em> is to be made, <strong> χριστοῦ καὶ θεοῦ</strong> being in the closest union. Nor is any specification needed that the Kingdom of Christ is also the Kingdom of God, as would be made with the second article. This follows as matter of course: and thus the words bear no. legitimate rendering, except on the substratum of our Lord’s Divinity. But on the other hand, we cannot safely say here, that the same Person is intended by χριστοῦ κ . θεοῦ , merely on account of the omission of the article. For 1) any introduction of such a predication regarding Christ would here be manifestly out of place, not belonging to the context: 2) θεός is so frequently and unaccountably anarthrous, that it is not safe to ground any such inference from its use here).</p>
