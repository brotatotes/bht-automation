Æschines, de Corona, p. 288, says that Demosthenes had drawn up a decree, κενώτερον τῶν λόγων οὓς εἴωθε λέγειν , κ . τοῦ βίου ὃν βεβίωκε . See other examples in Kypke h. l.) <strong> sayings</strong> (the persons pointed at are heathen, or pretended Christian, palliators of the fore-mentioned vices. The caution was especially needed, at a time when moral purity was so generally regarded as a thing indifferent. Harl. quotes from Bullinger, “Erant apud Ephesios homines corrupti, ut hodie apud nos plurimi sunt, qui hæc salutaria Dei præcepta cachinno excipientes obstrepunt: humanum esse quod faciant amatores, utile quod fœneratores, facetum quod joculatores, et idcirco Deum non usque adeo graviter animadvertere in istiusmodi lapsus”); <strong> for</strong> (let them say what they will, it is a fact, that) <strong> on account of these things</strong> (the above-mentioned erimes, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+3:6">Colossians 3:6</span> , <strong> δι</strong> <strong> ʼ</strong> ὃ ἔρχεται ἡ ὀργ . κ . τ . λ .: not the ἀπάτη just spoken of, to which the objection is not so much the plural ταῦτα , as the τοὺς υἱοὺς τ . <strong> ἀπειθείας</strong> which follows, shewing that the carrying out of their ἀπείθεια are the <strong> ταῦτα</strong> spoken of; and the μὴ οὖν γίν . κ . τ . λ . of Eph 5:7 ) <strong> cometh</strong> (present, as ἔχει , Eph 5:5 ) <strong> the wrath of God</strong> (not merely, or chiefly, His ordinary judgments, ‘quorum exempla sunt ante oculos,’ as Calv.: nor the ‘antitheton reconciliationis,’ as Beng., for that is on all who are not in Christ ( Joh 3:36 ): but His <em> special</em> wrath, His vengeance <em> for these sins</em> , over and above their state of ἀπείθεια ) <strong> on the sons of</strong> (see on ch. Eph 2:2 ) <strong> disobedience</strong> (the active and practical side of the state of the ἀπειθῶν ( Joh 3:36 ) is here brought out. The word is a valuable middle term between unbelief and disobedience, implying their identity in a manner full of the highest instruction).</p>
