Æschines, de Corona, p. 288, says that Demosthenes had drawn up a decree, κενώτερον τῶν λόγων οὓς εἴωθε λέγειν , κ . τοῦ βίου ὃν βεβίωκε . See other examples in Kypke h. l.)  sayings (the persons pointed at are heathen, or pretended Christian, palliators of the fore-mentioned vices. The caution was especially needed, at a time when moral purity was so generally regarded as a thing indifferent. Harl. quotes from Bullinger, “Erant apud Ephesios homines corrupti, ut hodie apud nos plurimi sunt, qui hæc salutaria Dei præcepta cachinno excipientes obstrepunt: humanum esse quod faciant amatores, utile quod fœneratores, facetum quod joculatores, et idcirco Deum non usque adeo graviter animadvertere in istiusmodi lapsus”);  for (let them say what they will, it is a fact, that)  on account of these things (the above-mentioned erimes, see Colossians 3:6 ,  δι  ʼ ὃ ἔρχεται ἡ ὀργ . κ . τ . λ .: not the ἀπάτη just spoken of, to which the objection is not so much the plural ταῦτα , as the τοὺς υἱοὺς τ .  ἀπειθείας which follows, shewing that the carrying out of their ἀπείθεια are the  ταῦτα spoken of; and the μὴ οὖν γίν . κ . τ . λ . of Eph 5:7 )  cometh (present, as ἔχει , Eph 5:5 )  the wrath of God (not merely, or chiefly, His ordinary judgments, ‘quorum exempla sunt ante oculos,’ as Calv.: nor the ‘antitheton reconciliationis,’ as Beng., for that is on all who are not in Christ ( Joh 3:36 ): but His  special wrath, His vengeance  for these sins , over and above their state of ἀπείθεια )  on the sons of (see on ch.
