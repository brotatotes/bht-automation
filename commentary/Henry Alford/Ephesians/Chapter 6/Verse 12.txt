<b> 12.] For</b> (confirms<i> the purpose just stated</i>)<b> our</b> (or,<i> ‘your:’</i> the ancient authorities are divided)<b> wrestling</b> (this must be literally taken—it is a hand to hand and foot to foot ‘tug of war’—that in which the combatants close, and wrestle for the mastery)<b> is not</b> (Meyer well remarks, that the negative is not to be softened down into<i> not so much,</i> or<i> not only,</i> as Grotius, &c.—the conflict which the Apostle means is absolutely<i> not</i> with men, but&c. Augustine says, “Our struggle is notagainst flesh and blood,” i.e. against<i> men,</i> whom you see raging against you. “They are vessels, which another uses: instruments, which another touches”)<b> against flesh and blood, but</b> (see above)<b> against the governments, against the powers</b> (see note on ch. i. 21)<b>, against the world-rulers</b> (compare John xii. 31 note; xiv. 30; xvi. 11; 2 Cor. iv. 4; 1 John v. 19)<b> of this</b> (present state of)<b> darkness</b> (see ch. ii. 2; v. 8, 11)<b>, against the spiritual (armies) of wickedness in the heavenly places</b> (<i>what is the meaning?</i> Chrysostom connects<b> in the heavenly places</b> with “<i>our wrestling is</i>”—saying, “It is in heavenly matters that our fight takes place.” Others do the same, understanding the<i> heavenly places</i>, properly so called, as the<i> scene</i> of the combat. “But how can the heavenly places, the scenes of divine blessing, of Christ’s exaltation, &c., be the seat or abode of impure fiends?” But if they. are “<i>the scene of</i>” our “<i>combat</i>” with these fiends, how can our enemies be any where else but in them? Two ways then remain: to join the words<b> in the heavenly places</b> a) with<b> the spiritual hosts of wickedness</b>—b) with<b> wickedness</b> only. And in my Greek Testament I have concluded, on account of the form of the Greek sentence, that the former of these is preferable. And in sense, if properly understood, it is unobjectionable. That habitation of the evil spirits, which in ch. ii. 2 was said, when speaking of mere matters of fact, to be in the<i> air,</i> is, now that the difficulty and importance of the Christian conflict is being forcibly set forth, represented as “<i>in the heavenly places</i>”—over us, and too strong for us without the panoply of God).
