<b> 13.] Wherefore</b> (since our foes are in power too mighty for us,—and in dwelling, around and above us)<b> take up</b> (so literally: but not ‘to the battle,’ but ‘to put it on’)<b> the entire armour of God</b> (see on ver. 11)<b>, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day</b> (not as Chrysostom, who makes the<i> evil day</i> mean the<i> present life:</i>—for then the evil day would be upon the Christian before he has on the armour. The right interpretation is well given by Bengel— “The war is perpetual: the fight rages less on one day, more on another. It is<i> the evil day,</i> on the approach of death, or during life: longer or shorter, varying in itself, where the evil one attacks us and his malignant hosts infest us, ver. 12”)<b>, and having accomplished all things</b> (requisite to the combat: being fully equipped and having bravely fought. The words must not be taken in the sense of, ‘<i>when the war is finished, and all foes overcome,</i>’ nor again, understood of<i> preparation only.</i> To finish, or accomplish, is the invariable Pauline usage of the word when taken in a good sense)<b>, to stand firm</b> (at your post: that when you shall have done all that belongs to a good soldier, you may be able to stand and be firm:—that you may not, after having done your duty well in battle, fall off, but stand your ground to the end).
