<b> 24.]</b> General benediction on all who love Christ: corresponding with the malediction on all who love Him not, 1 Cor. xvi. 22.<b> May the grace</b> (so literally: viz. of God, which comes by Christ)<b> be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility</b> (i. e. whose love is incorruptible. The way to explain this difficult expression will be to endeavour to find some clue to the idea in the Apostle’s mind. He speaks, in Col. ii. 22, of worldly things which become<i> corrupt</i> with the using.<i> Incorruptible</i> is with him an epithet of God [Rom. i. 23. 1 Tim. i. 17]: the dead are raised<i> incorruptible</i> [1 Cor. xv. 52]: the Christian’s crown is<i> incorruptible</i> [1 Cor. ix. 25]. The word always elsewhere in N.T. signifies the<i> incorruptibility</i> of future immortality. If we seek elsewhere in the Epistles for an illustration of the term as applied to inward qualities, we find a close parallel in 1 Pet. iii. 4; where the ornament of women is to be “<i>the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptibility of a meek and quiet spirit</i>”—the contrast being between the “<i>corruptible things, gold and silver,</i>” and the<i> incorruptible</i> graces of the renewed spiritual man. I believe we are thus led to the meaning here;—that the love spoken of. is<i> in incorruptibility;</i>—in, as its sphere and element and condition,<i> incorruptibility</i>—not a fleeting earthly love, but a spiritual and eternal one. And thus only is the word worthy to stand as the crown and climax of this glorious Epistle: whereas in the ordinary [A. V.] rendering,<i> ‘sincerity</i>,’—besides that this does not give the meaning of the Greek word,—the Epistle would end with an anti-climax, by lowering the high standard which it has lifted up throughout to an apparent indifferentism, and admitting to the apostolic blessing all those, however otherwise wrong, who are only not hypocrites in their love of Christ).
