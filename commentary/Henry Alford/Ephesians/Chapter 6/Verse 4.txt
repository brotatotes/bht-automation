<p><strong> 4</strong> .] <strong> And ye, fathers</strong> (the mothers being included, as ὑποτασσόμεναι τοῖς ἰδίοις ἀνδράσιν they being the fountains of domestic rule: not for any other less worthy reason, to which the whole view of the sexes by the Apostle is opposed), <strong> irritate not</strong> ( οἷον , says Chrys., οἱ πολλοὶ ποιοῦσιν , ἀποκληρονόμους ἐργαζόμενοι , καὶ ἀποκηρύκτους ποιοῦντες , καὶ φορτικῶς ἐπικείμενοι , οὐχ ὡς ἐλευθέροις ἀλλ ʼ ὡς ἀνδραπόδοις . But the Apostle seems rather to allude to provoking by vexatious commands, and unreasonable blame, and uncertain temper, in ordinary intercourse: cf. Col 3:21 ) <strong> your children, but bring them up</strong> (see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:29">Ephesians 5:29</span> , where it was used of physical fostering up: and cf. Plato, Rep. p. 538 c, περὶ δικαίων κ . καλῶν , ἐν οἷς ἐκτεθράμμεθα ὡς ὑπὸ γονεῦσι ) <strong> in</strong> (as the sphere and element: see Plato above) <strong> the discipline and admonition</strong> (‘ <strong> παιδεία</strong> hic significare videtur institutionem per pœnas: <strong> νουθεσία</strong> autem est ea institutio quæ fit verbis.’ Grot. Such indeed is the general sense of παιδεία in the LXX and N. T., the word having gained a deeper meaning than mere ‘eruditio,’ by the revealed doctrine of the depravity of our nature: see Trench, Syn. § 32. Ellic. remarks, that this sense seems not to have been unknown to earlier writers, e.g. Xen. Mem. i. 3. 5, διαίτῃ τήν τε ψυχὴν ἐπαίδευσε κ . τὸ σῶμα …, he <em> disciplined</em> &amp;c., but not Polyb. ii. 9. 6, where it is <strong> ἀβλαβῶς</strong> ἐπαιδεύθησαν πρὸς τὸ μέλλον .

<p><strong> νουθεσία</strong> (a late form for νουθέτησις , see Phryn. Lob. p. 512) is as Cicero, ‘ <em> quasi lenior objurgatio</em> :’ ‘the training by word by the word of encouragement, when no more is wanted; of remonstrance, reproof, or blame where these are required.’ Trench, ubi supra) <strong> of the Lord</strong> (i.e. Christ: either objective, ‘ <em> concerning the Lord</em> :’ so Thdrt. and very many of the ancients, and Erasm., Beza (not Est.), &amp;c. or subjective ‘ <em> such as the Lord approves</em> and dictates by His Spirit,’ so De W., Harl., Olsh., Mey., Stier. Conyb. renders ‘ <em> such training and correction as befits the servants of Christ</em> ,’ which surely the words can hardly contain).</p>
