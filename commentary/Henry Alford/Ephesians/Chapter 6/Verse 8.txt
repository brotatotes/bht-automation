<b> 8.] that it may be well with thee, and thou be long-lived upon the earth</b> (he paraphrases the latter portion of the commandment: thus adapting the promise to his Christian readers, by taking away from it that which is special and peculiar to the Jewish people. It is surely a mistake to<i> spiritualize</i> the promise, and understand by<b> the earth,</b> the heavenly Canaan. The very fact of the omission of the special clause, “<i>which the Lord thy God giveth thee,</i>” removes the words from the region of type into undoubted reality: and when we remember that the persons addressed are “<i>children</i>,” we must not depart from the simplest sense of the words).<br><br><b> 8.] knowing</b> (as ye do; i.e. seeing that ye are aware)<b> that each man, if he shall have done</b> (at Christ’s coming)<b> any good thing</b> (the reading is in some doubt. The sense comes to the same, whether it be read thus, or as the A.V., ‘<i>whatsoever good thing any man doeth.</i>’ But it must be, on either reading,<b> each man shall have done), this</b> (emphatic: ‘this in full,’ ‘this exactly’)<b> he shall receive</b> (see reff., where the same expression occurs—this he shall then receive in its value as then estimated,—changed, so to speak, into the currency of that new and final state)<b> from the Lord</b> (Christ)<b>, whether he be slave or free.</b> Chrysostom beautifully gives the connexion of thought: “Hence it was probable that many masters, being unbelievers, would not, pay regard to nor requite their slaves for their obedience: see how he consoled them, that they might not be distressed at their requital, but be of good courage, respecting their ultimate reward. For just as those who receive a benefit, if they be not grateful to their benefactors, make God a debtor to them: so in this case the masters, if you treat them well and they make you no return, have in fact made a greater return, by making God your debtor.”
