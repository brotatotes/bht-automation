 1 4 .] See on ch. Ephesians 5:22 .  Duties of children and parents .  Children, obey your parents [  in the Lord (i.e. Christ: the sphere in which the action is to take place, as usual:  ἐν κυρίῳ belonging to  ὑπακούετε τ  .   γον  . , not to  τοῖς γον  . , as if it were τοῖς ἐν κυρίῳ γον ., nor can this be combined, as a second reference, with the other, as by Orig. in Cramer’s Catena, understanding ‘your fathers in the faith, ὁποῖος ὁ Παῦλος ἦν Κορινθίων .’
	I should venture however to question whether the Apostle’s view was to hint at such commands of parents as might not be according to the will of God, as is very generally supposed (‘quia poterant parentes aliquid imperare perversum, adjunxit in Domino.’ Jer.): for cf. Colossians 3:20 , ὑπακούετε τοῖς γονεῦσιν  κατὰ πάντα . I should rather believe, that he regards both parents and children as ἐν κυρίῳ , and the commands, as well as the obedience, as having that sphere and element. How children were to regard commands  not answering to this description , would be understood from the nature of the case: but it seems to violate the simplicity of this  ὑποτασσόμενοι ἀλλήλοις passage, to introduce into it a by-thought of this kind)]:  for this is right (Thdrt., Harl., De W., Mey., al., regard  δίκαιον as explained by the next verse, and meaning κατὰ τὸν θεοῦ νόμον . But it seems rather an appeal to the first principles of natural duty, as Est., ‘ut a quibus vitam acceperimus, iis obedientiam reddamus.’ So Beng. Stier, as usual, combines both senses just, according to the law both of nature and of God. Surely it is better to regard the next verse as an additional particular, not the mere expansion of this).
