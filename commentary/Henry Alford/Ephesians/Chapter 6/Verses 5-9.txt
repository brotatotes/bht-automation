Chrys. sees in <strong> κατὰ σάρκα</strong> a consolatory hint that the δεσποτεία is πρόσκαιρος καὶ βραχεῖα : Calv., that their real liberty was still their own: Ellic. in citing these, rightly observes, that however they may be doubted, still both, especially the latter, are obviously <em> deductions</em> which must have been, and which the Apostle <em> might</em> have intended to have been, made) <strong> with fear and trembling</strong> (see reff., and note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:3">1 Corinthians 2:3</span> : whence it appears that the <strong> φόβος κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τρόμος</strong> was to be not that of dread, arising from their condition as slaves, but that of <em> anxiety</em> to do their duty, ‘sollicita reverentia, quam efficiet cordis simplicitas.’ Calv.), <strong> in</strong> (as its element) <strong> simplicity</strong> (singleness of view: “so Pind., Nem. viii. 61, speaks of κελεύθοις ἁπλόαις ζωᾶς in contrast with πάρφασις , treachery: in Aristoph. Plut. 1159, it is opposed to δόλιος : in Philo, Opif. 36, 39 (§ 55, 61, vol. i. pp. 38, 41), it is classed with ἀκακία ,” Harl.) <strong> of your heart, as to Christ</strong> (again He being the source and ground of all Christian motives and duties), <strong> not in a spirit of</strong> (according to, measuring your obedience by) <strong> eyeservice</strong> ( τὴν οὐκ ἐξ εἰλικρινοῦς καρδίας προσφερομένην θεραπείαν , ἀλλὰ τῷ σχήματι κεχρωσμένην , Thdrt. Xen. Œc. xii. 20, βασιλεὺς ἵππου ἐπιτυχὼν ἀγαθοῦ παχῦναι αὐτὸν ὡς τάχιστα βουλόμενος ἤρετο τῶν δεινῶν τινα ἀμφ ʼ ἵππους δοκούντων εἶναι , τί τάχιστα παχύνει ἵππον · τὸν δὲ εἰπεῖν λέγεται ὅτι δεσπότου ὀφθαλμός ) <strong> as men-pleasers</strong> (on <strong> ἀνθρωπάρεσκοι</strong> , see Lob. on Phryn., p. 621; who, while disapproving of forms such as εὐάρεσκος and δυσάρεσκος , allows ἀνθρωπάρεσκος ), <strong> but as slaves of Christ</strong> ( ὁ ἄρα ἀνθρωπάρεσκος , οὐ δοῦλος τοῦ χριστοῦ · ὁ δὲ δοῦλος τοῦ χριστοῦ , οὐκ ἀνθρωπάρεσκος . τίς γὰρ θεοῦ δοῦλος ὤν , ἀνθρώποις ἀρέσκειν βούλεται ; τίς δὲ ἀνθρώποις ἀρέσκων , θεοῦ δύναται εἶναι δοῦλος ; Chrys. The contrast is between <strong> κατ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ὀφθαλμοδουλείαν</strong> and <strong> ὡς δοῦλοι χρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , and <strong> ποιοῦντες</strong> κ . τ . λ . is a qualification of <strong> δοῦλοι χριστοῦ</strong> . This is much more natural, than, with Rückert, to make ποιοῦντες κ . τ . λ . carry the emphasis, and ὡς δοῦλ . χρ . to be merely subordinate to it), <strong> doing the will of God</strong> (serving not a <em> seen</em> master only ( ὀφθαλμοδουλ .), but the great invisible Lord of all, which will be the surest guarantee for your serving your earthly masters, even when unseen); <strong> from your soul with good will doing service</strong> (this arrangement, which is that of Syr., Chr., Jer., Beng., Lachm., Harl., De Wette, seems to me far better than the other (Tischdf., Mey., Ellic., al.) which joins <strong> ἐκ ψυχῆς</strong> to <strong> ποιοῦντες τὸ θέλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> . For 1) these words need here no such qualification as ἐκ ψυχῆς : if the will of God be the real object of the man’s obedience, the μὴ κατ ʼ ὀφθαλμοδουλ . will be sufficiently answered: and 2) were it so, it would be more natural to find <strong> ἐκ ψυχῆς</strong> preceding than following the clause, ἐκ ψυχῆς ποιοῦντες τὸ θέλ . τοῦ θεοῦ , or ἐκ ψυχῆς τὸ θέλ . τοῦ θεοῦ ποιοῦντες , or τὸ θέλ . τοῦ θεοῦ ἐκ ψυχῆς ποιοῦντες , whereas 3) the double qualification, ἐκ ψυχῆς μετ ʼ εὐνοίας , attached to δουλεύοντες , describes beautifully the source in himself ( ἐκ ψυχῆς ) and the accompanying feeling towards another ( μετ ʼ εὐνοίας ) of Christian service. On <strong> εὔνοια</strong> in this sense, cf. Eur. Androm. 59, εὔνους δὲ καὶ σοί , ζῶντι δ ʼ ἦν τῷ σῷ πόσει : Xen. Œcon. xii. 5, εὔνοιαν πρῶτον … δεήσει αὐτὸν ἔχειν σοι καὶ τοῖς σοῖς …; ἄνευ γὰρ εὐνοίας τί ὄφελος ἐπιτρόπου ἐπιστήμης γίνεται ; and the other examples in Wetst.) <strong> as to the Lord and not to men</strong> ,</p>
