<b> 1.]</b> It is better not to join the word<b> Apostle</b> (here of course used in its strict and highest sense) with<b> from men,</b> but to let it stand by itself, and take the two prepositions as indicating,<b> from</b> the remote originating cause,<b> by</b> the nearer instrumental one. In St. Paul’s case, neither of these was merely human: the Lord Jesus was both the original Sender, and Himself the Announcer of the mission.<br><br><b> and God the Father]</b> If by Jesus Christ, then also by God the Father, in and by whose appointment all the mediatorial acts of Christ in the Headship of His Church are done. The strongest possible contrast is here drawn between man, in the ordinary sense, on the one side, and<b> Jesus Christ,</b> and<b> God the Father,</b> on the other. Had not the Apostle regarded Jesus Christ as one with the Father in the Godhead, he never could have written thus. It is important to remember that the mission of Paul to the actual work of the ministry was by the command of the<i> Holy Spirit,</i> Acts xiii. 2,—proceeding from, and expressing the will of, the Father and the Son.<br><br><b> who raised Him from the dead]</b> Why specified here? Not, I think, because (Meyer) Paul was called to be an Apostle<i> by the risen Saviour</i>,—nor merely to identify the Father as the Originator of the Son’s work of Redemption (which is so in Rom. iv. 24,—but here would not immediately concern Paul’s calling to be an Apostle),—nor to meet the objection that he had never seen Christ, and turn it into an advantage, in that he alone was commissioned by the already risen and ascended Jesus,—for in this case we should not find “<i>who raised Him</i>” stated as a predicate of the Father, but “<i>which was raised</i>” as one of the Son,—nor as asserting the Resurrection against the Jews and Judaizing Galatians, which is far-fetched,—nor again as expressing an attribute of the Father, without which He can hardly be thought of by the believer,—for this is too loose a relevancy for a sentence so pointed as the present: but because the Resurrection, including and implying the Ascension, was the Father’s bestowal on Christ of gifts for men, by virtue of which (Eph. iv. 11) St. Paul’s<i> Apostleship had been received.</i> See a similar sentiment in Rom. i. 4, 5.
