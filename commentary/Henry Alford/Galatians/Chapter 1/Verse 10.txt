 10 .]  For (accounting for, and by so doing, softening, the seeming harshness of the last saying, by the fact which follows)  am I NOW ( ἄρτι takes up the ἄρτι of the last verse, having here the principal emphasis on it, q. d. ‘in saying this,’ ‘in what I have just said;’ ‘is this like an example of men-pleasing?’)  persuading (seeking to win over to me, ζητῶν ἀρέσκειν nearly; see reff.) MEN (see 1 Corinthians 4:3 ; 2 Corinthians 5:11 ; not, as Erasm. (al. not Luther), ‘num res humanas suadeo, an divinas?’ nor as Calvin, ‘suadeone secundum homines an secundum Deum?’)  or (  am I conciliating ) ( πείθω losing its more proper meaning, as of course, when thus applied)  God? or am I seeking to please MEN (a somewhat wider expression than the other, embracing his whole course of procedure)? (  Nay )  if I any longer (implying that such is the course of the world before conversion to Christ; not necessarily referring back to the time before his own conversion, any more than that is contained by implication in the words, but rather perhaps to the accumulated enormity of his being, after all he had gone through, a man-pleaser)  were pleasing men (either (1) imperf., = ‘seeking to please:’ so that the fact, of being well-pleasing to men, does not come into question; or (2) as Mey., ‘the fact of pleasing,  result of seeking to please:’ ‘if I were popular with men:’ the construction will bear both),  I were not (  ἤμην is a late form, found however in Xen. Cyr. vi. 1. 9: see Ellic. here)  the (or a, but better ‘the’)  servant of Christ . Some interpret χρ . δοῦ . οὐκ ἂν ἤμην as Chr., ἔτι μετὰ Ἰουδαίων ἤμην , ἔτι τὴν ἐκκλησίαν ἐδίωκον . But this would more naturally be expressed by οὐκ ἂν ἐγενόμην , and, as Mey. remarks, would give a very flat and poor sense: it is better therefore to take δοῦλος in its ethical, not its historical meaning.
