It cannot be identical with the visions spoken of, 2 Cor. xii. 1 ff.,—for 2 Cor. was written in A.D. 57, and fourteen years before that would bring us to A.D. 43, whereas his conversion was in 37 (see chronological table in Introduction), and his subsequent silence, during which we may conceive him to have been under preparation by this apocalyptic imparting of the Gospel, lasted but three years, ver. 18.—Nor can it be the same as that appearance of the Lord to him related Acts xxii. 18,—for that was not the occasion of any revelation, but simply of warning and command.—He appears to refer to this special revelation in 1 Cor. xi, 23; xv. 3; 1 Thess. iv. 15; see notes in those places.
