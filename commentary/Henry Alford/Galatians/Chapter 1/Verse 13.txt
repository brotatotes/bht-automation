There is no article before nor after ποτε , perhaps because the whole, ἀναστ .- ποτε - ἐν - τῷ - Ἰουδ ., is taken as one, q.d. τὸν ἐμόν ποτε Ἰουδαϊσμόν : or better, as Donaldson in Ellicott, “the position of ποτε is due to the verb included in ἀναστροφήν .

Aj. 1177, and σὲ παρακαλῶ , μὴ ἡμῖν ὁ Πρωταγόρας τὸν Σιμωνίδην ἐκπέρσῃ , Plato, Protag., p. 340.
