Into<i> what part</i> of Arabia he went, we have no means of determining. The name was a very vague one, sometimes including Damascus,—sometimes extending even to Lebanon and the borders of Cilicia. It was however more usually restricted to that Peninsula now thus called, between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.

Hardly for any considerable portion of the three years: Acts ix. 23 will scarcely admit of this: for those “<i>many days</i>” were manifestly passed at Damascus.—The journey is mentioned here, to account, for the time, and to shew that he did not spend it in conferring with<i> men</i>, or with the other Apostles.<br><br><b> and returned....]</b> compare Acts ix. 22, 25.
