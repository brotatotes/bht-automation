<b> 18.]</b> At first sight, it would appear as if the three years were to be reckoned from his<i> return to Damascus:</i> but on closer examination we see that<b> after three years</b> stands in opposition to ‘ “<i>immediately</i>” above, and the “<i>not going away to Jerusalem</i>” here answers to “<i>going up to Jerusalem</i>” there. So that we must reckon them from his<i> conversion</i>: the period specified in ver. 15 ruling the whole narrative. See also on ch. ii. 1.—This is the journey of Acts ix. 26,—where see note. There is no real discrepancy between that account and this. The incident which led to his leaving Damascus (Acts ix. 25; 2 Cor. xi. 32, 33) has not necessarily any connexion with his purpose in<i> going to Jerusalem:</i> a purpose which may have been entertained before, or determined on after, that incident. To this visit must be referred the vision of Acts xxii. 17, 18.
