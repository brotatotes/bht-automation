<b> 19.]</b> This verse admits of two interpretations, between which other considerations must decide. (1) That James, the Lordâ€™s brother, was one of the Twelve, and the only one besides Peter whom Paul saw at this visit: (2) that he was one<b> of the Apostles,</b> but not necessarily of the Twelve. Of these, (1) apparently cannot be: for after the choosing of the Twelve (John vi. 70), the brethren of our Lord did not believe on Him (John vii. 5): an expression (see note there) which will not admit of<i> any</i> of His brethren having then been His disciples. We must then adopt (2): which is besides in consonance with other notices respecting the term<i> Apostle</i>, and the person here mentioned. I reserve the subject for full discussion in the Introduction to the Epistle of James. See also notes, Matt. x. 3; xiii. 55; John vii. 5.
