<b> 2.]</b> Who these brethren were, may best be inferred by the Apostle’s usage in the addresses of other Epistles, where we have. “<i>Sosthenes our brother</i>” (1 Cor. i. 1), “<i>Timothy our brother</i>” (2 Cor. i. 1. Col. i. 1. Philem. 1). They were his colleagues in the work of the Gospel, his companions in travel, and the like (not all the members of the church where he was, who would hardly be specified as being<b> with him</b>,—besides that such an address would be unprecedented): and their unanimity is here stated, to shew that he was not alone in his doctrines but, joined by all the brethren who were present. At the same time the word all would seem to imply that just now he had<i> many</i> of these<i> brethren</i> with him. But we cannot draw any inference from this as to the date of our Epistle: for we do not know who were his companions on many occasions. At Ephesus, where probably it was written, we hear only of Gaius and Aristarchus (Acts xix. 29), but we cannot say that there were not others: in all likelihood, several more of those mentioned Acts xx. 4, were with him.
