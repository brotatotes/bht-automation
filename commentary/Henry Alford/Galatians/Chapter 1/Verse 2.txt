 2.   ἀδελφοί ] Who these were, may best be inferred by the Apostle’s usage in the addresses of other Epistles, where we have Σωσθένης ὁ ἀδελφός ( 1Co 1:1 ), Τιμόθεος ὁ ἀδ . (1 Chronicles 1:1; 1 Chronicles 1:11 Chronicles 1:1 . Phm 1:1 ). They were his colleagues in the work of the Gospel, his companions in travel, and the like (not all the members of the church where he was, as Erasm., Grot., Jowett, al., who would hardly be specified as being σὺν αὐτῷ , besides that such an address would be unprecedented): and their unanimity ( παντες ) is here stated, as Chrys., Luther, al., to shew that he was not alone in his doctrine, but joined by all the brethren who were present. At the same time πάντες would seem to imply that just now he had many of these ἀδελφοί with him. But we cannot draw any inference from this as to the date of our Epistle: for we do not know who were his companions on many occasions. At Ephesus, where probably it was written, we hear only of Gaius and Aristarchus ( Act 19:29 ), but we cannot say that there were not others: in all likelihood, several more of those mentioned Acts 20:4 , were with him.
	 ταῖς ἐκκλ  . ] πανταχοῦ γὰρ εἷρψεν ἡ νόσος . Thdrt. The principal cities of Galatia were Pessinus and Ancyra: but this plural seems to imply more than two such churches. See 1 Corinthians 16:1 , and Acts 16:6 ; Acts 18:23 . That we have here barely ταῖς ἐκκλ ., without any honourable adjunct (as in 1 Cor., 2 Cor., 1 Thess., 2 Thess., &c.), must he explained as Chrys. al.: θέα δέ μοι καὶ ἐνταῦθα τ . πολλὴν ἀγανάκτησιν . οὐ γὰρ εἶπε Τοῖς ἀγαπητοῖς οὐδὲ Τοῖς ἡγιασμένοις , ἀλλὰ Τ . ἐκκλ . τ . Γαλ . Meyer denies this, alleging (carelessly, which is not usual with him) 1 Thess. and 2 Thess. as addressed barely τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ , whereas in both we have added ἐν θεῷ πατρὶ κ . κυρίῳ Ἰησ . χρ .
