 21 .] The beginning only of this journey is related in Acts 9:30 , where see note. Dean Howson suggests (edn. 2, i. p. 129, f.) that he may have gone at once from Cæsarea to Tarsus by sea, and Syria and Cilicia may afterwards have been the field of his activity, these provinces being very generally mentioned together, from their geographical affinity, Cilicia being separated from Asia Minor by Mount Taurus. (See also note on Luke 2:1-2 .) Winer, al. have understood by Syria here, Phœnicia: but as Meyer has shewn, inconsistently with usage. In Acts 15:23 ; Acts 15:41 , we find churches in Syria and Cilicia, which may have been founded by Paul on this journey. The supposition is confirmed by our Galatians 1:23 ; see below.
