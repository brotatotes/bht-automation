<b> 21.]</b> The beginning only of this journey is related in Acts ix. 30, where see note. Mr. Howson suggests (edn. 2, i.p. 129, f.) that he may have gone at once from Caesarea to Tarsus by sea, and Syria and Cilicia may afterwards have been the field of his activity,â€”these provinces being very generally mentioned together, from their geographical affinity, Cilicia being separated from Asia Minor by Mount Taurus. In Acts xv. 23, 41, we find churches in Syria and Cilicia, which may have been founded by Paul on this journey. The supposition is confirmed by our ver. 23: see below.
