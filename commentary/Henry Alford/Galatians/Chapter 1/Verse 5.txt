<b> 5. to whom be the glory]</b> So on other occasions, when speaking of the wonderful things of God, St. Paul adds a doxology. “In civil life,” says Luther, “when we speak of the names of kings or princes, we do it with a submissive gesture, reverence, and genuflexion; much more, when we speak of God, ought we to bend the knee of the heart.”<br><br><b> In the glory,</b> or ‘the glory which is His,’—the article is probably inserted for solemnity.<br><br><b> for ever and ever]</b> Literally,<b> unto the ages of the ages;</b> see note on Eph. iii. 21.<br><br><b> so soon]</b> either (1) ‘<i>so soon after your conversion,’</i> or (2)<i> ‘so quickly,’</i>— ‘<i>after so little persuasion,’ when the false teachers once came among you,</i> or (3) ‘<i>so soon after my recent visit among you.’</i> Of these I prefer (1), as more suiting the dignity of the passage, and as the more general and comprehensive reason. But it does not exclude (2) and (3): ‘so soon’ might be, and might be intended to be, variously supplied. See Introduction, on the time and place of writing this Epistle.<br><br><b> removing</b>,<i> present</i>—not as A.V.,<i> ‘removed’</i>—is not passive, in the common usage of the word, according to which the Galatians would understand it. Chrysostom says well, “He saith not, ‘are removed,’ but ‘are removing:’ i.e. I as yet believe it not: I cannot think that your perversion is yet completed: the very expression is that of one winning them back again.” It is interesting to notice, in connexion with<i> the charge of fickleness,</i> the character given by Cæsar of the Gauls (by whom Galatia, or Gallo-Grecia, was peopled); “that they were eager and prompt to undertake war, but soon discouraged in calamity: fickle in their decisions, and easily induced to change.”<br><br><b> him that called you]</b> this, as almost always with the Apostle, is to be understood (see note on Rom. i. 6) of GOD the Father (see ver. 15; and cf. Rom. viii. 30; ix. 24, 25: 1 Cor. i. 9; vii. 15, 17: 1 Thess. ii. 12: 2 Thess. ii. 14: 2 Tim. i. 9. Also 1 Pet. v. 10).<br><br><b> in</b> (as the<i> element</i>, and hence the<i> medium</i>; not “<i>into</i>,” as A, V.) t<b> he grace of Christ.</b> ‘Christ’s grace’ is the elementary medium of our ‘calling of God,’ as is set forth in full, Rom. v. 15: see also Acts xv. 11. And ‘Christ’s grace’ is the sum of all that He has suffered and done for us to bring us to God;—<i>whereby</i> we come to the Father,—<i>in</i> which, as its element, the Father’s calling of us has place.<br><br><b> unto a different</b> (<i>in kind:</i> not<i> ‘original,’</i><i> ‘another,’ of the same kind,</i> which title he denies it, see below.
