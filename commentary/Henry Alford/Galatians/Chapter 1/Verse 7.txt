<b> 7.]</b> The preceding expression, ‘<i>a different Gospel,</i>’ was a paradoxical one, there being in reality<i> but one Gospel.</i> St. Paul appeared by it to admit the existence of<i> many</i><i> Gospels</i>, and he therefore now explains himself more accurately, how he wishes to be understood,<b> which</b> “different Gospel,” whereto you are falling away,<b> is not another,</b> not a second, besides the one Gospel;<b> except that there are</b> (i. e., in more familiar English,<b> only there are</b>)<b> some that trouble you, &c.</b> That is: ‘<b>This different Gospel</b><i> is only in so far another</i>, that there are certain, who&c.’ Notice, that the stress is on<b> not another</b>; so that St. Paul, though he had before said “<i>a different Gospel,</i>” yet<i> guards the unity</i> of the Gospel, and explains what he meant by this expression to be<i> nothing but a corruption and perversion of the one Gospel of Christ.</i> ‘The nature of this ‘different Gospel,’ as gathered from the data in our Epistle, was (1), though recognizing Jesus as the Christ, it insisted on circumcision and the observance of the Mosaic ordinances as to times, &c.: (2) it professed to rest on the authority of some of the other Apostles.<br><br><b> the gospel of Christ]</b> perhaps here not<i> “Christ’s Gospel,’</i> but the Gospel of (i. e. relating to, preaching) Christ. The context only can determine in such expressions whether the genitive is subjective or objective.
