In the very opening sentence of the Epistle, we see the fervour of the Apostle’s mind and the weightiness of his subject betraying themselves. The vindication of his own apostolic calling, and the description of the work and purpose of Christ towards us, shew him to be writing to those who had disparaged that apostleship, and were falling from their Saviour.
