 10 .  μόν. τ. πτ. ἵνα μν. ] The genitive is put before the conjunction for emphasis: see reff., and 2 Thessalonians 2:7 , and John 13:29 , where remarkably enough it is the same word which precedes ἵνα , … τοῖς πτωχοῖς ἵνα τὶ δῷ . The construction is complete without supplying any participle ( αἰτοῦντες or παρακαλοῦντες ), depending upon ἔδωκαν .
	 ὃ καὶ ἐσπ  .   αὐτὸ τ  .   ποι  . ]  which was the very thing that I also was anxious to do , viz., then and always: it was my habit. So that ἐσπούδασα has not a pluperfect sense. He uses the singular, because the plural could not correctly be predicated of the whole time to which the verb refers: for he parted from Barnabas shortly after the council in Acts 15:0 . Meyer understands ἐσπούδ . of the time subsequent to the council only: but this does not seem necessary. The proofs of this σπουδή on his part may be found, Rom 15:25-27 ; 1 Corinthians 16:1-4 ; 2 Corinthians 8:9 ; Acts 24:17 ; which, though they probably happened after the date of our Epistle, yet shewed the bent of his habitual wishes on this point.
	 αὐτὸ τοῦτο is not merely redundant, as in ἧς εἶχεν τὸ θυγάτριον αὐτῆς πνεῦμα ἀκάθαρτον , Mark 7:25 , but is an emphatic repetition of that to which ὅ refers, as in the version above. So that ὃ ἐσπ . αὐτὸ τοῦτο ποι . = καὶ ἐσπ . τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ποι . Cf. Thuc. i. 10, Ἀθηναίων δὲ τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο παθόντων . Cf. Ellicott’s note.
