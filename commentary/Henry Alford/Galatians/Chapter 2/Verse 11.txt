<b> 11.]</b> This visit of Peter to Antioch, not related in the Acts, will fall most naturally (for our narrative follows the order of time) in the period described, Acts xv. 35, seeing that (ver. 18) Barnabas also was there. See below.<br><br><b> Cephas]</b> Eusebius quotes out of Clement a story that this Cephas was not the Apostle, but one of the Seventy, of the same name. This was manifestly invented to save the credit of St. Peter. One of the most curious instances of ecclesiastical ingenuity on record has been afforded in the interpretation of this passage by the Fathers. They try to make it appear that the reproof was only an apparent one—that St. Peter was entirely in the right, and St. Paul withstood him<b> to the face,</b> i.e. as they explain it, ‘<i>in appearance merely</i>,’ because he had been blamed by others. So Chrysostom: so Theodoret also: and Jerome.—This view of Jerome’s met with strong opposition from Augustine, who writes to him, nobly and worthily, maintaining that if St. Paul wrote thus, he was<i> lying</i>, in the very passage in which he says, “The things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.” Afterwards, Jerome abandoned his view for the right one.<br><br><b> because he was condemned]</b> not,<i> ‘because he was to be blamed,’</i> A.V.: no such meaning can be extracted from the original word. He was ‘a condemned man,’ as we say: by whom, does not appear: possibly,<i> by his own act:</i> or,<i> by the Christians in Antioch</i>: but St. Paul would hardly have waited for the prompting of others to pronounce his condemnation of him. I therefore prefer the former:<b> he was [self] convicted:</b> convicted of inconsistency by his conduct.
