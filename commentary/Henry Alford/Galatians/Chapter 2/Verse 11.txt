<p><strong> 11</strong> . <strong> ὅτε δὲ ἦλθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This visit of Peter to Antioch, not related in the Acts, will fall most naturally (for our narrative follows the order of time) in the period described, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:35">Acts 15:35</span> , seeing that ( Gal 2:13 ) Barnabas also was there. See below.

<p><strong> Κηφᾶς</strong> ] ἡ ἱστορία παρὰ Κλήμεντι κατὰ τὴν πέμπτην τῶν ὑποτυπώσεων , ἐν ᾗ καὶ Κηφᾶν , περὶ οὗ φησὶν ὁ Παῦλος Ὅτε δὲ ἦλθ . Κ . εἰς Ἀντ . κατ . πρ . αὐτ . ἀντέστην , ἕνα φησὶ γεγονέναι τῶν ἑβδομήκοντα μαθητῶν , ὁμώνυμον Πέτρῳ τυγχάνοντα τῷ ἀποστόλῳ . Eus. H. E. i. 12. This story was manifestly invented to save the credit of St. Peter. See below.

<p><strong> κατὰ πρόσωπον</strong> ] <strong> to the face</strong> , see reff.: not ‘ <em> before all</em> ,’ which is asserted by and by, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:14">Galatians 2:14</span> . One of the most curious instances of ecclesiastical ingenuity on record has been afforded in the interpretation of this passage by the fathers. They try to make it appear that the reproof was only an apparent one that ὁ θεῖος Πέτρος was entirely in the right, and Paul withstood him, κατὰ πρόσωπον , ‘ <em> in appearance merely</em> ,’ because he had been blamed by others. So Chrys.: so Thdrt. also: and Jerome, “Paulus … nova usus est arte pugnandi, ut dispensationem Petri, qua Judæos salvari cupiebat, nova ipse contradictionis dispensatione corrigeret, et resisteret ei in facie, non arguens propositum, sed quasi in publico contradicens, ut ex eo quod Paulus eum arguens resistebat, hi qui crediderant e gentibus servarentur.” In Ep. ad Gal, ad loc. This view of his met with strong opposition from Augustine, who writes to him, nobly and worthily, Ep. 40. 3, vol. ii. p. 155, ed. Migne: “In exposition quoque Ep. Pauli ad Gal., invenimus aliquid, quod nos multum moveat. Si enim ad Scripturas sanctas admissa fuerint velut officiosa mendacia, quid in eis remanebit auctoritatis? Quæ tandem de Scripturis illis sententia proferetur, cujus pondere contentiosæ falsitatis obteratur improbitas? Statim enim ut protuleris: si aliter sapit qui contra nititur, dicet illud quod prolatum erit honesto aliquo officio scriptorum fuisse mentitum. Ubi enim hoc non poterit, si potuit in ea narratione, quam exorsus Apostolus ait, <em> Quæ autem scribo vobis, ecce coram Deo quia non mentior</em> , credi affirmarique mentitus, eo loco ubi dixit de Petro et Barnaba, <em> cum viderem, quia non recte ingrediuntur ad veritatem Evangelii?</em> Si enim recte illi ingrediebantur, iste mentitus est: si autem ibi mentitus est, ubi verum dixit? Cur ibi verum dixisse videbitur, ubi hoc dixerit quod lector sapit; cum vero contra sensum lectoris aliquid occurrerit, officioso mendacio deputabitur?… Quare arripe, obsecro te, ingenuam et vere Christianam cum caritate severitatem, ad illud opus corrigendum et emendandum, et παλινῳδίαν , ut dicitur, cane. Incomparabiliter enim pulchrior est veritas Christianorum, quam Helena Græcorum.…” (Similarly in several other Epistles in vol. ii. ed. Migne, where also Jerome’s replies may be seen.) Afterwards, Jerome abandoned his view for the right one: ‘Nonne idem Paulus in faciem Cephæ restitit, quod non recto pede incederet in Evangelio?’ Apol. adv. Ruf. iii. 2, vol. ii. p. 532: see also cont. Pelag. i. 22, p. 718. Aug. Ep. 180. 5, vol. ii. p. 779.

<p><strong> ὅτι κατεγνωσμένος ἦν</strong> ] (not, as vulgate, <em> quia reprehensibilis erat</em> (‘because he was to be blamed,’ E. V.: similarly Calv., Beza, al.): no such meaning can be extracted from the perfect participle passive; nor can Hebrew usage be alleged for such a meaning in Greek. The instance commonly cited from Lucian de saltat., p. 952, ἀληθῶς , ἐπὶ μανίᾳ κατεγνωσμένος , is none whatever; nor is Iliad, α . 388, ὃ δὴ τετελεσμένος ἐστί : the perfect participle having in both its proper sense. Nor again is ψηλαφωμένῳ ( ὄρει ), <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:18">Hebrews 12:18</span> , at all to the purpose: see note there) <strong> because he was condemned</strong> (‘a condemned man,’ as we say: by whom, does not appear: possibly, <em> by his own act</em> : or, <em> by the Christians in Antioch</em> : but St. Paul would hardly have waited for the prompting of others to pronounce his condemnation of him. I therefore prefer the former: <strong> he was</strong> ( <strong> self</strong> ) <strong> convicted:</strong> convicted of inconsistency by his conduct).</p>
