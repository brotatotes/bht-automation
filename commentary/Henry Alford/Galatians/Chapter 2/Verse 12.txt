<b> 12.]</b> These certain men from James have been softened by some Commentators into persons who merely<i> gave themselves out</i> as from James, or who merely came from Jerusalem where James presided. But the candid reader will I think at once recognize in the words a<i> mission</i> from James: and will find no difficulty in believing that that Apostle, even after the decision of the council regarding the Gentile converts, may have retained (characteristically, see his recommendation to St. Paul, in Acts xxi. 18 ff.) his strict view of the duties of Jewish converts,—for that is perhaps all that the present passage requires. And this mission may have been for the very purpose of admonishing the Jewish converts of<i> their</i> obligations, from which the Gentiles were free. Thus we have no occasion to assume that James had in the council been over-persuaded by the earnestness and eloquence of Paul, and had afterwards undergone a reaction: for his course will be consistent throughout. And my view seems to me to be confirmed by his own words, Acts xv. 19, where the emphatic expression, “<i>them which from among the Gentiles are turning unto God,</i>” tacitly implies, that the Jews would be bound as before.
