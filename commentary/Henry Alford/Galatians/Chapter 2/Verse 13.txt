<b> 13. joined in his hypocrisy]</b> The word is not (as De Wette says) too strong a one to describe their conduct. They were aware of the liberty in Christ which allowed them to eat with Gentiles, and had practised it: and now, being still aware of it, and not convinced to the contrary, from mere fear of man they adopted a contrary course. The case bore but very little likeness to that discussed in 1 Cor. viii.â€”x.; Rom. xiv. There, it was a mere matter of<i> licence</i> which was in question: here, the very foundation itself. It was not now a question of using a liberty, but of asserting a truth, that of justification by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law.
