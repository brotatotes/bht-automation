<b> 15.]</b> Some think that the speech ends with ver. 14: others with ver. 15, or ver. 16, or ver. 18: Jowett, that the conversation gradually passes off into the general subject of the Epistle. “Ver. 14,” he says, “is the answer of St.<br><br> Paul to St. Peter: what follows, is more like the Apostle musing or arguing with himself, with an indirect reference to the Galatians.” But it seems very unnatural to place any break before the end of the chapter. The Apostle recurs to the Galatians again, in ch. iii. 1: and it is harsh in the extreme to suppose him to pass from his speech to Peter, into an address to them, with so little indication of the transition. I therefore regard the speech (which doubtless is freely reported, and gives rather the bearing of what was said, than the words themselves, as in Acts xxii. and xxvi.) as continuing to the end of the chapter, as do the great majority of Commentators, ancient and modern.<br><br><b> We</b> (thou and I)<b> are Jews by nature</b> (birth)<b>, and not sinners from among the Gentiles</b> (he is speaking to Peter from the common ground of their Judaism, and using [ironically?] Judaistic language, in which the Gentiles were called<i> atheists, lawless, unjust, sinners,</i> see Rom. ii. 12; vi. 1; ix. 21; Eph. ii. 12; 1 Sam. xv. 18)<b>: knowing nevertheless that a man is not justified by</b> (as the ground of justification)<b> the works of the law</b>,— (supply, nor is any man justified)<b> save through</b> (except by, literally)<b> the faith of Jesus Christ,—we also</b> (as well as the Gentile sinners, casting aside our legal trust)<b> believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by</b> (this time, faith is the<i> ground</i>)<b> the faith of Christ</b> (so literally)<b>, and not by the works of the law: because</b> (it is an axiom in our theolog that)<b> by the works of the law shall all flesh find no justification</b> (so in the Greek: in English ‘<i>shall no flesh be</i><i> justified:’</i> our language not admitting of the logical form of the Greek: but by this transposition of the negative, the sense is not accurately rendered).
