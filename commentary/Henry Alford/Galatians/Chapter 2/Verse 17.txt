<b> 17.]</b><i> continues the argument.</i><b> But if, seeking</b> (put first for emphasis—in the course of our earnest endeavour)<b> to be justified in Christ</b> (as the element—the Body, comprehending us the members. This is lost sight of by rendering as A.V., ‘<i>by</i> Christ’),<b> we ourselves also</b> (you and I, addressed to Peter)<b> were found [to be] sinners</b> (as we should be, if we regarded the keeping of the law as necessary; for we should be in the situation of those Gentiles who in the Judaistic view are<i> sinners</i>, faith having failed in obtaining righteousness for us, and we having cast aside the law which we were bound to keep),<b> is not Christ a minister of sin</b> (i. e. are we to admit the consequence which would in that case be inevitable, that Christ, having failed to obtain for his own the righteousness which is by faith, has left them sinners, and so has done all his work only to minister to a state of sin)? Theodoret expresses well the argument. “If our having left the law and become attached to Christ, expecting by our faith in Him to gain righteousness, is to be accounted transgression, the guilt will lie on our Master Christ Himself: for He it was who proposed to us the new covenant. But God forbid that we should dare to utter such a blasphemy.”
