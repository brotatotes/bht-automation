 18 .]  For (substantiates the μὴ γένοιτο , and otherwise deduces the ὑρέθημεν ἁμαρτωλοί )  if the things which I pulled down, those very things (and no others)  I again build up (which thou art doing, who in Cæsarea didst so plainly announce freedom from the law, and again here in Antioch didst practise it thyself. The  first person is chosen  clementiæ causa ; the  second would have placed Peter, where the first means that he should place  himself ),  I am proving (reff.)  myself a transgressor ( παραβάτης is the species, bringing me under the genus ἁμαρτωλός . So that παραβ . ἐμ . συνιστ . is the explanation of ἁμαρτωλοὶ εὑρέθημεν ). The  force of the verse is, ‘You, by now reasserting the obligation of the law, are proving (  quoad te ) that your former step of setting aside the law was in fact a  transgression of it:’ viz. in that you neglected and set it aside, not, as Chrys., Thl., and Meyer (from Gal 2:19 ), because the law itself was leading you on to faith in Christ: for (1) that point is not yet raised, not belonging to this portion of the argument, and (2) by the hypothesis of this verse the ἐγώ has  given up the faith in Christ, and so cannot be regarded as acknowledging it as the end of the law. See against this view, but to me not convincingly, Ellicott, Exodus 2:0 .
