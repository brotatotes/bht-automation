The first person of the<i> last</i> verse, serves as the transition point to treating, as he now does, of HIS OWN state and course. And this “I,” as that in Rom. vii., is purely and<i> bona fide</i> ‘I Paul;’ not ‘I and all believers’)<b> by means of the law died to the law</b> (Christ was the end of the law for righteousness: the law itself, properly apprehended by me, was my “guide” to Christ: and in Christ, who fulfilled the law, I died to the law: i.e. satisfied the law’s requirements, and passed out of its pale)<b>, that I should live to God</b> (the end of Christ’s work, LIFE unto God). Many of the Fathers, and others, take the first<b> law</b> here to mean the Gospel (the “<i>law of the Spirit of life</i>” of Rom. viii. 2): but it will be manifest to any who follow the argument, that this cannot be so. This “<i>through the law dying to the law</i>” is in fact a compendium of his expanded experience in Rom. vii.: and also of his argument in ch. iii. iv. below.
