<b> 2.] But</b> not only carries on the narrative, emphatically repeating the verb, but carries on the refutation also—<b>but I went up</b> (not for any purpose of learning from or consulting others, but)<b>&c.</b> Of his undertaking the journey<b> by</b> (in consequence of)<b> revelation</b>, nothing is said in the Acts: all that is related there being, the appointment by the church of St. Paul and Barnabas and others to go. What divine intimation St. Paul may have received, inducing him to offer himself for the deputation, we cannot say: that some such occurred, he here assures us, and it was important for him to assert it, as shewing his dependence only on divine leading, and independence of any behests from the Jerusalem church. Meyer well remarks, that the history itself of the Acts furnishes an instance of such a double prompting: Peter was induced by a vision, and at the same time by the messengers of Cornelius, to go to Cesarea.<br><br><b> unto them]</b> The Christians at Jerusalem, implied in the word “<i>Jerusalem</i>” above. This wide assertion is limited by the next clause.<br><br><b> but</b> (limits the foregoing: as if to say, “when I say ‘to them,’ I mean”)<b> privately</b> (in a private conference: not to be conceived as separate from, but as specifying, the former communication)<b> to those that were eminent</b> (more at length ver. 6,<i> “they which seemed to be somewhat.”</i> These were James, Cephas, and John, ver. 9,—who appear to have been the only Apostles then at Jerusalem. ‘This is said, not for his own sake, but for that of others: meaning, that all might see the unity of the preaching, and that the truths proclaimed by me were well pleasing to the rest.” Theodoret)<b>, lest by any means I should</b> (seem to)<b> be running, or</b> (to)<b> have run, in vain.</b> It is quite out of the question, that this last clause should express a<i> bona fide</i> fear, lest his ministry should really be, or have been, in vain, without the recognition of the church at Jerusalem: such a sentiment would be unworthy of him, and, besides, at variance with the whole course of his argument here. The reference must be to the<i> estimation</i> in which his preaching would be held by those to whom he imparted it. When we consider the very strong prejudices of the Jerusalem church, this feeling of anxiety, leading him to take measures to prevent his work from being tumultuously disowned by them, is surely but natural.<b></b><br><br><b> 21] I do not</b> (as thou [Peter] art doing, and the Judaizers)<b> frustrate</b> (or,<b> make void</b>)<b> the grace of God: for</b> (justification of the strong expression,<i> frustrate</i>)<b> if by the law (comes) righteousness</b> (not<i> justification</i>—but<i> the result of justification</i>),<b> then Christ died without cause</b> (not as A.V., ‘<i>in vain</i>,’ with reference to the<i> result</i> of His death, but<i> gratuitously, causelessly;— ‘Christ need not have died.</i>’ “For,” says Chrysostom, “if, Christ died, it is clear that it was because the law could not justify us: but if the law<i> does</i> justify us, Christ’s death was superfluous”).
