<b> 2.] But</b> not only carries on the narrative, emphatically repeating the verb, but carries on the refutation alsoâ€”<b>but I went up</b> (not for any purpose of learning from or consulting others, but)<b>&c.</b> Of his undertaking the journey<b> by</b> (in consequence of)<b> revelation</b>, nothing is said in the Acts: all that is related there being, the appointment by the church of St. Paul and Barnabas and others to go. What divine intimation St. Paul may have received, inducing him to offer himself for the deputation, we cannot say: that some such occurred, he here assures us, and it was important for him to assert it, as shewing his dependence only on divine leading, and independence of any behests from the Jerusalem church. Meyer well remarks, that the history itself of the Acts furnishes an instance of such a double prompting: Peter was induced by a vision, and at the same time by the messengers of Cornelius, to go to Cesarea.
