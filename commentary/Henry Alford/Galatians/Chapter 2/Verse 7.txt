They said, ‘Take your own course: preach the Gospel of the uncircumcision to Gentiles, and we will preach the Gospel of the circumcision to Jews.’” Jowett.<br><br><b> when they saw,</b> viz. by the communication mentioned ver. 2, coupled with the now manifest results of his preaching among the Gentiles.
