<p><strong> ἐνήργ</strong> <strong> .</strong> applies to the ἀπακολουθοῦντα σημεῖα with which the Lord accompanied His word spoken by them, and to the power with which they spoke that word. The agent in ἐνεργ . is GOD, the Father: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:6">1 Corinthians 12:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:15-16">Romans 15:15-16</span> .
