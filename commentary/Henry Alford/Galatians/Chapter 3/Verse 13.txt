<b> 13.]</b> But this curse has been removed by the redemption of Christ. The joyful contrast is introduced abruptly, without any connecting particle: see a similar case in Col. iii. 4. The US is emphatic, and applies solely to the Jews.<i> They only</i> were under the curse of ver. 10,—and they being by Christ redeemed from that curse, the blessing of Abraham (justification by faith), which was always destined by God to flow through the Jews to the Gentiles, was set at liberty thus to flow out to the Gentiles. This is the only view which suits the context. To make<i> us</i> refer to Jews and Gentiles, and refer<i> the curse of the law</i> to the law of conscience, is to break up the context altogether.<br><br><b> redeemed us]</b> bought us off: see, besides reff., 1 Cor. vi. 20; vii. 23; 2 Pet. ii. 1; Rev. v. 9.—The form of the idea is,—the Law (personified) held us (Jews) under its curse; (<b>out of this) Christ bought us, BECOMING</b> (emphatic)<b> a curse</b> (not<i> accursed</i>, concrete, but<i> a curse,</i> abstract, to express that he became not only a cursed person, but<i> the curse itself,</i> coextensive with the disability which affected us)<b> for us</b> (the JEWS again. And the meaning is not, ‘<i>instead of us</i>,’ but<i> ‘on our behalf.’</i> It<i> was</i> in our stead: but that circumstance is not expressed by the form of this sentence).<br><br><b> for it is written, &c.,</b> is a parenthesis, justifying the formal expression “<i>having become a curse for us</i>.” The citation omits the words<i> “of God”</i> after “<i>cursed.</i>” They were not to the point here, being understood as matter of course, the law being<i> God’s</i> law. The words are spoken of hanging<i> after death by stoning;</i> and are given, in the place cited, as a reason why the body should not: remain on the tree all night, because one hanging on a tree is accursed of God. Such formal curse then extended to Christ, who<i> died</i> by hanging on a tree.
