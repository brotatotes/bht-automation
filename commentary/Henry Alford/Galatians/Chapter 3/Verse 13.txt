The US is emphatic, and applies solely to the Jews.<i> They only</i> were under the curse of ver. 10,â€”and they being by Christ redeemed from that curse, the blessing of Abraham (justification by faith), which was always destined by God to flow through the Jews to the Gentiles, was set at liberty thus to flow out to the Gentiles. This is the only view which suits the context. To make<i> us</i> refer to Jews and Gentiles, and refer<i> the curse of the law</i> to the law of conscience, is to break up the context altogether.
