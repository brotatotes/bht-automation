 14 .]  in order that (the intent of γενόμ . ὑπ . ἡμ . κατάρα )  the blessing of Abraham (promised to Abraham: i.e. justification by faith; Gal 3:9 )  might be (come)  upon the Gentiles (not, all nations, but strictly the Gentiles: see above on Gal 3:13 )  in (in and by,  conditional element )  Jesus the Christ, that ( ἵνα , parallel with, not dependent on and included in, the former ἵνα : for this clause has no longer to do with τὰ ἔθνη , see below. We have a second ἵνα co-ordinate with a first in Romans 7:13 ; 2 Corinthians 9:3 ; Eph 6:19-20 )  we (not emphatic, nor is ἡμεῖς expressed: no longer the Jews, as Beza and Bengel, but all Christians: see Jowett’s note, which perhaps is too finely drawn)  might receive (in full, as fulfilled, aor.)  through the (or, but not so usually,  our )  faith (as the subjective medium: but rendered objective by the article, as so often by St. Paul: no  stress on διὰ τ . π .)  the promise of the Spirit (viz. that made Joel 2:28 . See Acts 2:17 ; Acts 2:33 ; Luke 24:49 , THE PROMISE of the new covenant). The genitive τοῦ πν . is objective, the Spirit being the thing promised. But let me guard tiros against the old absurdity, “ ἐπαγγελία τοῦ πνεύματος pro τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἐπηγγελμένον ,” which would destroy, here and every where else, the logical form of the sentence. This ‘receiving the promise of the Spirit’ distinctly refers back to Galatians 3:2 , where he asked them whether they received the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? “Here is a pause, at which the indignant feeling of the Apostle softens, and he begins the new train of thought which follows with words of milder character, and proceeds more quietly with his argument.” Windischmann.
