<b> 17.]</b> Inference from vv. 15, 16, put in the form of a re-statement of the argument, as applying to the matters in hand.<b> This however I say</b> (this is my meaning, the drift of my previous statement),<b> The covenant which was previously ratified by God</b> (the words<i> unto Christ</i> seem to have been inserted by some to complete the correspondence with ver. 16: the<i> fact was so,</i> it was ‘<i>to Christ</i>,’ as its second party, that the covenant was ratified by God),<b> the Law, which took place</b> (was constituted)<b> four hundred and thirty years after, does not abrogate, 80 as to do away the promise.</b> As regards the interval of 430 years, we may remark, that in Exod. xii. 40, it is stated, “The sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.” (In Gen. xv. 13, Acts vii. 6, the period of the oppression of Israel in Egypt is roundly stated at 400 years.) But to this, in order to obtain the entire interval between the covenant with Abraham and the law, must be added the sojourning of the Patriarchs in Canaan,—i. e. to the birth of Isaac, 25 years (Gen. xii. 4; xxi. 5),—to that of Jacob, 60 more (Gen. xxv. 26),—to his going down into Egypt, 130 more (Gen. xlvii. 9); in all = 215 years. So that the time really was 645 years, not 430. But in the Septuagint version (and Samaritan Pentateuch) we read, Exod. xii. 40, “The sojourning of the children of Israel which they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, they and their fathers, was four hundred and thirty years:” and this reckoning St. Paul has followed. We have instances of a similar adoption of the Septuagint text in the apology of Stephen: see Acts vii. 14, and note. After all, however,<i> the difficulty</i> lies in the 400 years of Gen. xv. 13 and Acts vii. 6. For we may ascertain thus the period of the sojourn of Israel in Egypt: Joseph was 39 years old when Jacob came into Egypt (Gen. sli. 46, 47; xlv. 6): therefore he was born when Jacob was 91 (91 + 39 = 130: see Gen. xlvii. 9). But he was born 6 years before Jacob left Laban (compare ib. xxx. 25 with xxxi. 41), having been with him 20 years (ib. xxxi. 38, 41), and served him 14 of them for his two daughters (xxxi. 41). Hence, seeing that his marriage with Rachel took place when he was 78; [the marriages with Leah and Rachel being contemporaneous, and the second seven years of service occurring<i> after</i>, not before, the marriage with Rachel; Levi, the<i> third</i> son of Leah, whose first son was born after Rachel’s marriage [xxix. 30–32], must have been born not earlier than Jacoh’s 81st year,—and consequently was about 49 [130–81] when he went down into Egypt. Now (Exod. vi. 16) Levi<i> lived in all</i> 137 years: i.e., about 88 [137–49]
