 17 .] Enthymematical inference from Galatians 3:15-16 , put in the form of a restatement of the argument, as applying to the matters in hand.  This however I say (this is my meaning, the drift of my previous statement):  the covenant (better than  a covenant, as most Commentators; even Meyer and De W.: the emphatic substantive is often anarthrous: cf. the different arrangement in Gal 3:15 )  which was previously ratified by God ( εἰς χρ . being inserted by some to complete the correspondence with Galatians 3:16 ; the  fact was so , it was ‘  to Christ ,’ as its second party, that the covenant was ratified by God),  the Law, which took place (was constituted)  four hundred and thirty years after, does not abrogate, so as to do away the promise . As regards the interval of 430 years, we may remark, that in Exodus 12:40 , it is stated, “The sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.” (In Genesis 15:13 , Acts 7:6 , the period of the oppression of Israel in Egypt is roundly stated at 400 years.) But to this, in order to obtain the entire interval between the covenant with Abraham and the law, must be added the sojourning of the patriarchs in Canaan, i.e. to the birth of Isaac, 25 years (Genesis 12:4 ; Gen 21:5 ), to that of Jacob, 60 more ( Gen 25:26 ), to his going down into Egypt, 130 more ( Gen 47:9 ); in all = 215 years. So that the time really was 645 years, not 430. But in the LXX (and Samaritan Pentateuch) we read, Exodus 12:40 , ἡ δὲ κατοίκησις ( παροίκ ., A.) τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ , ἣν κατῴκησαν ( παρῴκ ., A.) ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ἐν γῇ Χαναάν (A. adding αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν ) ἔτη τετρακόσια τριάκοντα : and this reckoning St. Paul has followed. We have instances of a similar adoption of the LXX text, in the apology of Stephen: see Acts 7:14 , and note. After all, however,  the difficulty lies in the 400 years of Gen 15:13 and Acts 7:6 . For we may ascertain thus the period of the sojourn of Israel in Egypt: Joseph was 39 years old when Jacob came into Egypt (Genesis 41:46-47 ; Gen 45:6 ): therefore he was born when Jacob was 91 (91 + 39 = 130: see Gen 47:9 ). But he was born 6 years before Jacob left Laban (compare ib. Gen 30:25 with Gen 31:41 ), having been with him 20 years (ib. Genesis 31:38 ; Gen 31:41 ), and served him 14 of them for his two daughters ( Gen 30:41 ). Hence, seeing that his marriage with Rachel took place when he was 78 (91-20-7; the marriages with Leah and Rachel being contemporaneous, and the second seven years of service occurring  after , not, as I assumed in the first edition, before, the marriage with Rachel); Levi, the  third son of Leah, whose  first son was born after Rachel’s marriage ( Gen 29:30-32 ), must have been born not earlier than Jacob’s 81st year, and consequently was about 49 (130 81) when he went down into Egypt. Now ( Exo 6:16 ) Levi  lived in all 137 years: i.e., about 88 (137 49) years in Egypt. But (Exodus 6:16 ; Exodus 6:18 ; Exo 6:20 ) Amram, father of Moses and Aaron, married his father Kohath’s sister, Jochebed, who was therefore, as expressly stated Numbers 26:59 , ‘the daughter of Levi, whom  her mother bare to Levi in Egypt.’ Therefore Jochebed must have been born within 88 years after the going down into Egypt. And seeing that Moses was 80 years old at the Exodus ( Exo 7:7 ), if we call  x his mother’s age when he was born, we have 88 + 80 +  x as a maximum for the sojourn in Egypt, which clearly therefore cannot be 430 years, or even 400; as in the former case  x would = 262, in the latter 232. If we take  x = cir. 47 (to which might be added in the hypothesis any time which 88 and  x might have had in common) we shall have the sojourn in Egypt = 215 years, which added to the previous 215, will make the required 430. Thus it will appear that the LXX, Samaritan Pent., and St. Paul, have the right chronology, and as stated above, the difficulty lies in Gen 15:13 and Acts 7:6 , and in the Hebrew text of Exodus 12:40 .
