Did ye from (as its ground, see ch. Gal 2:16 )  the works of the Law (not a Law)  receive the Spirit (evidently here to be taken as including  all His gifts , spiritual and external: not as Chr., Thl., Jer., χαρίσματα only: for the two are distinguished in Gal 3:5 ),  or from the hearing of faith (meaning either, ‘  that preaching which proclaimed faith ,’ or ‘  that hearing, which received (  the )  faith .’ The first is preferable, because (1) where their first receiving the Gospel is in question, the  preaching of it would probably be hinted at, as it is indeed taken up by the οὖν below, Galatians 3:5 ; (2) where the question is concerning the power of faith as contrasted with the works of the law, faith would most likely be  subjective . But certainly we must not understand it ‘  obedience ( ὑπακ . Romans 1:5 ; Romans 16:26 . See 1Ki 15:22 )  to the faith ,’ as Wahl, al., which would spoil the contrast here)?
