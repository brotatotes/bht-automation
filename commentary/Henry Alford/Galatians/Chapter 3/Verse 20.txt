<b> 20.]</b> The explanations of this verse, so obscure from its brevity, are so numerous (Winer counted 250: Jowett mentions 430) that they require a bibliography of their own. I believe we shall best disentangle the sense as follows. (1) Clearly, the terms<b> a mediator</b> and<b> God</b> are opposed. (2) As clearly<b> cannot be of one</b> and<b> is one</b> are opposed. (3) From this contrast arises an apparent opposition between the law and the promises of God, which gives occasion to the question of ver. 21. Taking up therefore again (1),—<i>a mediator,</i> by whose hand the law was enacted, stands opposed to<i> God</i>, the giver of the promises. And that, in this respect (2);— (a)<i> a mediator</i> is not<i> of one,</i> but (b)<i> God</i> is<i> one</i>. And herein lies the knot of the verse; that is, in (b),—for the meaning of (a) is pretty clear on all hands; viz. that<i> a mediator</i> does not belong to<i> one party</i> (masculine) but to<i> two</i>, as going between one party and another). Then to guide us to the meaning of (b), we must remember, that the numerical contrast is the primary idea:<i> a mediator</i> belongs not to<i> one</i>, but<i> God is one.</i> Shall we then say, that all reference of the term<i> one</i> (as applied to<i> God</i>) beyond this numerical one is to be repudiated? I cannot think so. The proposition “<i>God is one”</i> would carry to the mind of every reader much more than the mere<i> numerical</i> unity of God—viz. His Unity as an<i> essential</i><i> attribute</i>, extending through the whole divine Character. And thus, though the proposition<i> a mediator is not of one,</i> would not, by itself, convey any meaning but that a mediator belongs to more than one, it would, when combined with<i> God is one,</i> receive a shade of meaning which it did not bear before,—of a state of things involved in the fact of a<i> mediator</i> being employed, which was not according to the<i> oneness</i> of God, or, so to speak, in the main track of His unchanging purpose. And thus (3), the law, administered by the<i> mediator</i>, belonging to a state inconsistent. with<i> oneness</i>, a state of two at variance, is apparently opposed to the<i> promises</i>, belonging entirely to THE ONE, the one (faithful) God. And observe, that the above explanation is deduced entirely from the<i> form of the sentence itself,</i> and from the idea which the expression<i> “God is one</i>” must necessarily raise in the mind of its reader, accustomed to the proposition as the foundation of the faith;—not from any preconceived view, to suit which the words, or emphatic arrangement, must be forced. Notice by the way, that the objection, that the Gospel too is<i> in the hand of a mediator,</i> does not apply here: for (<i>a</i>) there is no question here of the Gospel, but only of the<i> promises,</i> as direct from God: (<i>b</i>) the<i> mediator</i> of the Gospel is altogether different, and His work different: He has absolutely reconciled the parties at variance, and MADE THEM ONE in Himself. Remember St. Paul’s habit of insulating the matter in hand, and dealing with it irrespective of all such possible objections. I must refer the reader for even the shortest account of other explanations, to my Greek Test. We may profitably lay down one or two canons of interpretation of the verse. (1) Every interpretation is wrong, which understands Christ by<b> the mediator</b> in this verse. The context determines it to be abstract, and its reference to be to Moses, the mediator of the Law. (2) Every interpretation is wrong, which makes<b> one</b> mean ‘one party’ in the covenant.<b> God is one</b> itself confutes any such view, being a wellknown general proposition, not admitting of a concrete interpretation. (3) Every interpretation is wrong, which confines<b> God is one</b> to its mere numerical meaning, and does not take into account the ideas which the general proposition would raise. 4) Every interpretation is wrong, which deduces from the verse the<i> agreement</i> of the law with the promises: because the Apostle himself, in the next verse, draws the very opposite inference from it, and refutes it on other grounds. (5) Every attempt to set aside the verse as a gloss is utterly futile.
