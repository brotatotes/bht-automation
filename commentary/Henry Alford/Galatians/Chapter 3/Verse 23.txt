<p><strong> 23</strong> .] <strong> But</strong> ( δέ carries us on to a further account of the rationale and office of the law. “When the noun, to which the particle is attached, is preceded by a preposition, and perhaps the article as well, δέ may stand the third or fourth word in the sentence. So ἐν τοῖς πρῶτοι δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι , Thuc. i. 6: οὐχ ὑπὸ ἐραστοῦ δέ , Plato, Phædr. 227 d, &amp;c.” Hartung, Partikell. i. 190) <strong> before</strong> (this) <strong> faith</strong> (not, <em> the faith</em> , in the sense of <em> the objects of faith</em> , but the faith just mentioned, viz. πίστις Ἰησοῦ χρ ., which did not exist until Christ) <strong> came</strong> (was found, or was possible, in men: cf. ref., where however it is more entirely subjective), <strong> we</strong> (properly, we Jewish believers but not here to be pressed, because he is speaking of the divine dealings with men generally the Law was for τὰ πάντα , the only revelation) <strong> were kept in ward</strong> (not simply ‘ <em> kept</em> ’ as E. V., but as Chrys., ὥσπερ ἐν τειχίῳ τινί , though not as he proceeds, τῷ φόβῳ κατεχόμενοι for, as above, our objective state is here treated of: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:6">Romans 7:6</span> . But we must not yet, with Chrys., al., introduce the παιδαγωγός , or understand ἐφρουρ . as conveying the idea of ‘ <em> safely kept</em> ’ ( οὐδὲν ἕτερον δηλοῦντός ἐστιν , ἢ τὴν ἐκ τῶν ἐντολῶν τοῦ νόμου γενομένην ἀσφάλειαν ): συγκλειόμενοι is quite against this, and the pædagogic figure does not enter till the next verse, springing out of the preparation implied in εἰς , joined to the fact of our sonship, see below. Our present verse answers to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:2">Galatians 4:2</span> , where we find ἐπίτροποι and οἰκονόμοι , not the παιδαγωγός . See Jowett’s beautiful illustration), <strong> shut up under the law, in order to</strong> ( εἰς of the preparatory <em> design</em> , not merely of the <em> result</em> , or the arrival of the time: and it may belong either to συγκλειόμ . (not to συγκεκλεισμένοι , if that be read, as that would betoken the act completed when the Law was given), or to the imperfect ἐφρουρούμεθα ) <strong> the faith</strong> (as in Gal 3:22 ) <strong> about to be revealed</strong> (on the order of the words see on ref. Rom. “As long as there was no such thing as faith in Christ, this faith was <em> not yet revealed</em> , was as yet an element of life hidden in the counsel of God.” Meyer).</p>
