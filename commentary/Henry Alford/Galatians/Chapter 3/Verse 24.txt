 24 .]  So that (taking up the condition in which the last verse left us, and  adding to it the fact that we are the SONS of God, cf. γάρ , Gal 3:26 )  the Law has become (has turned out to be)  our tutor (pedagogue, see below)  unto (ethically;  for )  Christ (the παιδαγωγός was a faithful slave, entrusted with the care of the boy from his tender years till puberty, to keep him from evil physical and moral, and accompany him to his amusements and studies. See Dict. of Gr. and Rom. Antt. sub voce. The E. V. ‘  schoolmaster ’ does not express the meaning fully: but it disturbs the sense less than those have done, who have selected one portion only of the pedagogue’s duty, and understood by it, ‘  the slave who leads a child to the house of the schoolmaster ’ ( οἷόν τινι σοφῷ διδασκάλῳ προσφέρει τῷ δεσπότῃ χριστῷ , Thdrt.: so also Thl.: see Suicer, νόμος , b), thus making Christ the schoolmaster, which is inconsistent with the imagery. On the contrary, the whole schoolmaster’s work is included in the παιδαγωγός , and Christ represents the ἐλευθερία of the grown-up son, in which he is no longer guarded or shut up, but justified by faith, the act of a free man; and to Christ  as a Teacher there is here no allusion),  in order that by faith we might be justified (which could only be done when Christ had come):  but (adversative)  now that the faith (see above)  has come, we are no longer under a tutor (pedagogue).
