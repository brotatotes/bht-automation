<b> 24.] So that</b> (taking up the condition in which the last verse left us, and<i> adding to it the fact</i> that we are the SONS of God, ver. 26)<b> the Law hath become</b> (has turned out to be)<b> our tutor</b> (pedagogue, or schoolmaster, see below)<b> unto</b> (ethically; for)<b> Christ</b> (the pedagogue was a faithful slave, entrusted with the care of the boy from his tender years till puberty, to keep him from evil physical and moral, and accompany him to his amusements and studies. The word<b> schoolmaster</b> does not express the meaning fully: but it disturbs the sense less than those have done, who have selected one portion only of the pedagogue’s duty, and understood by it, ‘<i>the slave who leads a child to the house of the schoolmaster</i>,’ thus making Christ the schoolmaster, which is inconsistent with the imagery. On the contrary, the whole schoolmaster’s work is included in the word<b> pedagogue</b>, and Christ represents the<i> freedom</i> of the grown-up son, in which he is no longer guarded or shut up, but justified by faith, the act of a free man; and to Christ<i> as a Teacher</i> there is here no allusion),<b> in order that by faith we can be justified</b> (which may only be done now Christ has come).<b> But</b> (adversative)<b> now that [the] faith</b> (see above)<b> is come, we are no longer under a tutor</b> (pedagogue or schoolmaster).
