<b> 27.] For</b> (substantiates and explains the assertion of ver. 26: see below)<b> as many of you as were baptized into</b> (see Rom. vi. 3 and notes)<b> Christ did put on Christ</b> (at that time, compare the verbs in Acts xix. 2: not “<i>have been baptized,</i>” and “<i>have put on</i>,” as A.V., which leaves the two actions only concomitant: the past tenses make them identical: as many as were baptized into Christ, did in that very act, put on, clothe yourselves with, Christ. The force of the argument is well given by Chrysostom: “Why did he not say, ‘As many of you as were baptized into Christ, were born of God?’ for this would naturally follow from having shewn that they were sons. Because he lays down a far more startling proposition. For if Christ is the Son of God, and thou hast put Him on, having the Son in thee, and fashioned after His likeness, thou wert brought into one family with Him and one type.” Observe here how boldly and broadly St. Paul asserts the effect of Baptism on ALL THE BAPTIZED. Luther remarks: “This passage is to be carefully noted against those fanatical spirits who depreciate the majesty of Baptism, and speak wickedly and impiously concerning it. Paul, on the other hand, dignifies Baptism with sublime titles, calling it the font of regeneration and of the renewal by the Holy Spirit (Tit. iii. 5), and here says that all the baptized put on Christ: as if he said: ye have not received in baptism a mere ticket of admission into the number of Christians, as many fanatics of our time have fancied, who have made of baptism a mere admission ticket, i.e. a transitory and empty sign: but he declares that in baptism, they put on Christ: i.e. ye were snatched away from the law into a new birth, which was effected in your baptism.” But we may notice too, as Meyer remarks, that the very putting on of Christ, which as matter of standing and profession is done in baptism, forms a subject of exhortation to those already baptized, in its ethical sense, Rom. xiii. 14).
