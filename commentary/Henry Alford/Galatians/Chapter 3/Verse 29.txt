<b> 29.]</b> Christ is ‘<i>Abraham’s seed</i>’ (ver. 16): ye are one in and with Christ, have put on Christ; therefore<i> ye</i> are Abraham’s seed; consequently heirs by promise; for to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. The stress is on<b> ye, Abraham’s,</b> and<b> according to promise,</b> especially on the latter,—carrying the conclusion of the argument, as against inheritance<i> by the law.</i> See on this verse, the note on ver. 16 above. “The declaration of ver. 7 is now substantiated by 22 verses of the deepest, the most varied, and most comprehensive reasoning that exists in the whole compass of the great Apostle’s writings.” Ellicott.
