<b> 4.] Did ye suffer</b> (not “<i>have ye suffered,</i>” as A.V.)<b> so many things in vain?</b> There is much controversy about the meaning. Chrysostom, Augustine, and the ancients, and others, understand it of the sufferings which the Galatians underwent at the time of their reception of the Gospel. And, I believe, rightly. For (a) the word “<i>suffer</i>” occurs seven times in St. Paul, and always in the strict sense of<i> ‘suffering</i>,’ by persecution, or hardship (similarly in Heb., 1 Pet., &c.): (b) the past tense here marks the reference to be to some definite time. Now the time referred to by the context is that of their conversion to the Gospel, compare verses 2, 3, above. Therefore the meaning is,<b> Did ye undergo all those sufferings</b> (not specially mentioned in this Epistle, but which every convert to Christ must have undergone as a matter of course)<b> in vain? if it be really in vain</b> ( “if, as it must be, what I have said, ‘that ye suffered in vain,’ is really the fact”).<b></b>
