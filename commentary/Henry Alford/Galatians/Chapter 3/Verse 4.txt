<p><strong> 4</strong> .] <strong> Did ye suffer</strong> (not, ‘ <em> have ye suffered</em> ,’ as almost all Commentators, E. V., &amp;c., i.e. πεπόνθατε , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:18">Hebrews 2:18</span> ; Luk 13:2 ) <strong> so many things in vain?</strong> There is much controversy about the meaning. (1) Chrys., Aug., and the ancients, Grot., Wolf, Rück., Olsh., &amp;c., understand it of the sufferings which the Galatians underwent at the time of their reception of the Gospel. And, I believe, rightly. For (a) πάσχω occurs (see reff.) seven times in St. Paul, and always in the strict sense of ‘ <em> suffering</em> ,’ by persecution, or hardship (similarly in Heb., 1 Pet., &amp;c.): (b) the historic aorist here marks the reference to be to some definite time. Now the time referred to by the context is that of their conversion to the Gospel, cf. τὸ πν . ἐλάβετε , ἐναρξάμενοι πνεύματι above. Therefore the meaning is, <strong> Did ye undergo all those sufferings</strong> (not specially mentioned in this Epistle, but which every convert to Christ must have undergone as a matter of course) <strong> in vain</strong> (Schomer first, and after him many, and Winer, B.-Crus., De Wette, understand παθεῖν here in a <em> good sense</em> , in reference to divine grace bestowed on them. But πάσχω seems never to be thus used in Greek without an indication in the context of such a meaning, e.g. εὖ πάσχειν , or as in Jos. Antt. iii. 15. 1, ὅσα παθόντες ἐξ αὐτοῦ κ . πηλικῶν εὐεργεσιῶν μεταλαβόντες , where the added clause defines the παθόντες ; and never in N. T., LXX nor Apocrypha at all. (3) Bengel refers it to their patience with Paul ( <em> patientissime sustinuistis pertulistisque me</em> ); but this, as Meyer remarks, would be expressed by ἀνέχειν , hardly by πάσχειν . (4) Meyer, to the troubles of their bondage introduced by the false and judaizing teachers. But not to dwell on other objections, it is decisive against this, (a) that it would thus be <em> present</em> , πάσχετε (see ch. Gal 4:10 ), not <em> past</em> at all, and (b) that even if it might be past, it must be the perfect and not the aorist. I therefore hold to (1); οὐ γὰρ ὑπὲρ τοῦ νόμου ἀλλ ʼ ὑπὲρ τοῦ χριστοῦ τὰ παθήματα , Thdrt.: πάντα γὰρ ἐκεῖνα , φησίν , ἅπερ ὑπεμείνατε , ζημιῶσαι ὑμᾶς οὗτοι βούλονται , κ . τὸν στέφανον ὑμῶν ἁρπάσαι . Chrys. (So Ellic. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:0">Exodus 2:0</span> .) When Meyer says that this meaning is ganz isolirt vom Context, he is surely speaking at random: see above. (Ellic. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+1:0">Exodus 1:0</span> took ἐπάθετε in a neutral sense, as applying to both persecutions and blessings, and nearly so Jowett: ‘Had ye all these experiences in vain?’ objecting to (1) that it is unlike the whole spirit of the Apostle. But we find surely a trace of the same spirit in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:29-30">Philippians 1:29-30</span> ; as there suffering is represented as a special grace from Christ, so here it might well be said, ‘let not such grace have been received in vain’)) <strong> ? if it be really in vain</strong> (on εἴ γε καί , see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:3">2 Corinthians 5:3</span> ; the construction is, ‘if, as it must be, what I have said, εἰκῆ , is really the fact.’ The Commentators all take it as a supposition, some, as Chr., &amp;c., E.V., ‘if it be yet in vain,’ as a softening of εἰκῆ , others, as Meyer, De W., al., as an intensification of it, ‘if it be only in vain (and not something worse)’).</p>
