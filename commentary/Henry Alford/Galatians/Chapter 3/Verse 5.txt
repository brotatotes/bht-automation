 5 .]  οὖν takes up again the question of Galatians 3:2 , and asks it in another form. There is a question whether the participles  ἐπιχορηγῶν and  ἐνεργῶν are present, referring to things done among them while the Apostle was  writing , or imperfect, still spoken of the time when he was with them? Chrys., Thdrt., &c., and Bengel, al., maintain the latter: Luth., Calv., Rück., Meyer, De W., &c., the former. It seems to me, that this question must be settled by first determining who is the agent here spoken of. Is it the Apostle? or is it not rather GOD, and is not this indicated by the reference to Abraham’s faith in the next verse, and the taking up the passive ἐλογίσθη by δικαιοῖ  ὁ θεός in Gal 3:8 ? If it be so, then the participles here must be taken as present, but indefinite, in a substantive sense (Winer), as ὁ διώκων ἡμᾶς ποτέ , ch. Galatians 1:23 . And certainly God alone can be said (and so in ref. 2 Cor.) ἐπιχορηγεῖν τὸ πνεῦμα , and ἐνεργεῖν (Ch. Gal 2:8 ) δυνάμεις ἐν ὑμῖν (see below).
