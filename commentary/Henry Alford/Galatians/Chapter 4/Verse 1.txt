<p><strong> ὁ κληρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , generic, as ὁ μεσίτης , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:20">Galatians 3:20</span> . The question, whether the <em> father</em> of the κληρονόμος here is to be thought of as dead, or absent, or living and present, is in fact one of no importance: nor does it belong properly to the consideration of the passage. The fact is, the antitype breaks through the type, and disturbs it: as is the case, wherever the idea of <em> inheritance</em> is spiritualized. The supposition in our text is, that a father (from what reason or under what circumstances matters not. Mr. Bagge quotes from Ulpian, speaking of the right of a testator appointing guardians, “Tutorem autem et a certo tempore dare et usque ad certum tempus licet.” Digest. xxvi. 2. 8) has preordained a time for his son and heir to come of age, and till that time, has subjected him to guardians and stewards. In the <em> type</em> , the reason might be absence, or decease, or even high office or intense occupation, of the father: in the <em> antitype</em> , it is the Father’s sovereign will: but the <em> circumstances</em> equally exist.
