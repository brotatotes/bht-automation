 1 .]  λέγωδέ refers to what follows (reff.), and does not imply, ‘What I mean, is.’
	 ὁ κληρ  . , generic, as ὁ μεσίτης , ch. Galatians 3:20 . The question, whether the  father of the κληρονόμος here is to be thought of as dead, or absent, or living and present, is in fact one of no importance: nor does it belong properly to the consideration of the passage. The fact is, the antitype breaks through the type, and disturbs it: as is the case, wherever the idea of  inheritance is spiritualized. The supposition in our text is, that a father (from what reason or under what circumstances matters not. Mr. Bagge quotes from Ulpian, speaking of the right of a testator appointing guardians, “Tutorem autem et a certo tempore dare et usque ad certum tempus licet.” Digest. xxvi. 2. 8) has preordained a time for his son and heir to come of age, and till that time, has subjected him to guardians and stewards. In the  type , the reason might be absence, or decease, or even high office or intense occupation, of the father: in the  antitype , it is the Father’s sovereign will: but the  circumstances equally exist.
