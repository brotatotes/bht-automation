The question, whether the<i> father</i> of the<i> heir</i> here is to he thought of as dead, or absent, or living and present, is in fact one of no importance: nor does it belong properly to the consideration of the passage. The fact is, the antitype breaks through the type, and disturbs it: as is the case, wherever the idea of<i> inheritance</i> is spiritualized. The supposition in our text is, that a father (from what reason or under what circumstances matters not) has preordained a time for his son and heir to come of age, and till that time, has subjected him to guardians and stewards. In the<i> type</i>, the reason might be absence, or decease, or even high office or intense occupation, of the father: in the<i> antitype</i>, it is the Father's sovereign will: but the<i> circumstances</i> equally exist.<br><br><b> differeth nothing from a bond-servant]</b> for he may be coerced, and even corporally punished, by those set over him.<br><br><b> though he be lord of all</b> must be understood<i> essentially</i>, rather than prospectively. It is said of him in virtue of his rank, rather than of his actual estate:<i> in posse,</i> as the lawyers say, rather than<i> in esse.</i>
