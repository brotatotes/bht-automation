<p><strong> 13</strong> .] <strong> δι</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἀσθένειαν τῆς σαρκός</strong> can surely bear but one rendering, <strong> on account of bodily weakness</strong> : all others (e.g. ‘ <em> in weakness</em> ,’ as E. V., μετὰ ἀσθενείας , as Œc., Thl., ‘ <em> per infirmitatem</em> ,’ as vulg., Luth., Beza, Grot., Estius, Jowett (comparing <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:15">Philippians 1:15</span> , where see note), ‘ <em> during a period of sickness</em> ,’ as Mr. Bagge) are ungrammatical, or irrelevant, as ‘ <em> on account of the infirmity of</em> ( <em> your</em> ) <em> flesh</em> ’ (Jer., Estius, Hig., Rettig), which would require some qualifying adverb such as οὕτως with εὐηγγελισάμην , and would besides be wholly out of place in an Epistle in which he is recalling them to the substance of his first preaching. The meaning then will be, that it was <em> on account of an illness</em> that he first preached in Galatia: i.e. that he was for that reason detained there, and preached, which otherwise he would not have done. On this, see Prolegomena, § ii. 3: the fact itself, I cannot help thinking, is plainly asserted here. Beware of conjectural emendation, such as δι ʼ ἀσθενείας of Peile, for which there is neither warrant nor need.
