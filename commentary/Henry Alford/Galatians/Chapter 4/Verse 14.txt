The whole tenor of the passage seeming to shew that the Apostle’s weakness was spoken of as a trial to the Galatians, μου appeared to have been altered to ὑμῶν , or to have been omitted by some who could not see its relevance, or its needfulness. But the principles of sounder criticism have taught me how unsafe is such ground of arguing, and have compelled me to adopt the text of the most ancient MSS.

No inference can be drawn from <em> these expressions</em> being used of <em> the Galatians’ reception</em> of him, that they were already Christians when he first visited them: the words are evidently not to be pressed as accurate in point of chronology, but involve an ὕστερον πρότερον : not, ‘as you <em> would have</em> received,’ &amp;c., but ‘as you would (now) receive.’</p>
