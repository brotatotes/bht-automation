<b> 15.] Where then</b> (i. e. where in estimation, holding what place)<b> (is) your congratulation of yourselves</b> (so literally:<b> the blessedness ye boasted of</b>, in having me among you as your Apostle? This is perhaps as good a rendering as the words will bear)<b>?</b> i.e. considering your fickle behaviour since.<br><br><b> for I bear you witness...]</b> a proof, to what lengths this<i> congratulation of themselves,</i> and consequently their high value for St. Paul ran, at his first visit. In seeking for a reference for this expression, y<b> e would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me</b>, the right course will be, not at once to adopt the conclusion, that they point to ocular weakness on the part of the Apostle,—nor, because they form a trite proverb (signifying any great extent of self-sacrifice for another) in many languages, therefore to set down at once that no such allusion to a personal infirmity can have been intended, but to judge from the words themselves, and our information from other sources, whether such an allusion is likely. And in doing so, I may observe that a proverbial expression so harsh in its nature, and so little prepared by the context. would perhaps hardly have been introduced without some notice, or some particle of climax. Would not the Apostle have more naturally written, “<i>have plucked out even your own eyes?</i>” Had the “<i>even</i>” been inserted, it would have deprived the words of all reference to a matter of fact, and made them purely proverbial. On the other side, the<i> order of the words</i> in the original rather favours the idea that the phrase is a proverbial one. The inference then of any ocular disease from these words themselves seems to me precarious. Certainly Acts xxiii. 1 ff. receives light from such a supposition: but with our very small knowledge on the subject, many conjectures may be hazarded with some show of support from Scripture, while none of them has enough foundation to mike it probable on the whole.
