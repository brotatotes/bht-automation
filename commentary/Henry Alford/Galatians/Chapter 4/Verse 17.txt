 17 .] ‘My telling you the truth may have made me seem your enemy: but I warn you that these men who court you so zealously (see ref. 2 Cor., and cf. Plut. vii. 762, cited by Fritz. ὑπὸ χρείας τὸ πρῶτον ἕπονται κ . ζηλοῦσιν , ὕστερον δὲ καὶ φιλοῦσιν ) have no honourable purpose in so doing: it is only in order to get you away from the community as a separate clique, that you may court them.’ Thus the verse seems to fit best into the context. As regards particular words,  ἐκκλείω must bear the meaning of exclusion from a larger and attraction to a smaller, viz. their own, party. (Our very word ‘exclusive’ conveys the same idea.) I have therefore not adopted Mey.’s rendering, ‘  from all other teachers ,’ nor that of Luther (1538), Calv., Grot., Beng., Rück., Olsh., Winer, al., ‘  from me and my communion ,’ nor that of Chrys., Œc., Thl., τῆς τελείας γνώσεως ἐκβαλεῖν , nor that of Erasm., Corn.-a-lap., ‘  from Christian freedom .’
	The mood of  ζηλοῦτε has been disputed: and it must remain uncertain here, as in 1 Corinthians 4:6 , where see note. Here as there Meyer would give ἵνα the meaning of ‘  in which case :’ but it is surely far better where the sentence so plainly requires ἵνα of the purpose, to suppose some peculiar usage or solœcism in formation of the subjunctive on the part of the Apostle.
