	 προθεσμία ,  the time (previously)  appointed . The word (an adjective used substantively: scil. ἡμέρα or ὥρα . See for the classical meaning, ‘the time allowed to elapse before bringing an action,’ Smith’s Dict. of Antt. sub voce) is a common one: Wetst. gives many examples. The following clearly explain it: ὁρίσαι προθεσμίαν , ἐν ᾗ τὸ ἱερὸν συντελεσθήσεται , Polyæn. p. 597: εἰ δὲ ὁ τῆς ζωῆς τῶν ἀνθρώπων χρόνος εἰκοσαετὴς ἦν … τὴν δὲ τῶν κ . ἐτῶν προθεσμίαν ἐκπληρώσαντα , Plut. ad Apollon. p. 113 e. It is no objection to the view that the father is dead, that the time was  fixed by law (Hebrew as well as Greek and Roman): nor on the other hand any proof of it, that  προ θεσμία will hardly apply to a living man’s arrangement: see on the whole, above.
