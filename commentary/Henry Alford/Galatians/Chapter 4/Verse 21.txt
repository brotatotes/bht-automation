 21 .  θέλοντες ] καλῶς εἶπεν ·  οἱ θέλοντες , οὐ γὰρ τῆς τῶν πραγμάτων ἀκολουθίας , ἀλλὰ τῆς ἐκείνων ἀκαίρου φιλονεικίας τὸ πρᾶγμα ἦν . Chrys.
	 τ  .   νόμον οὐκ ἀκούετε ]  do ye not hear (heed)  the law , listen to that which the law imparts and impresses on its hearers? Meyer would understand, ‘do ye not hear the law read?’ viz. in the synagogues, &c. But the other seems to me more natural.
