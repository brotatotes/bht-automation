<b> 24.] Which things are allegorical</b> (i. e. as in text,<b> have another meaning:</b> are to be understood otherwise than according to their literal sense. It was the practice of the Rabbinical Jews to allegorize the Old Test. history. “Almost all the things narrated have with them their allegorical and mystical interpretation. Nor can we depreciate their labours in this matter. For St. Paul treats things in the same way, e.g. by speaking of the first and second Adam, of spiritual meat and drink, of Hagar, &c. So also John speaks of the mystical Sodom and Egypt, and predicts by revelation the infliction of the Egyptian plagues on the enemies of the church.” Schöttgen. How various persons take this allegorical comment of the Apostle, depends very much on their views of his authority as a Scripture interpreter. To those who receive the law as a great system of prophetic figures, there can be no difficulty in believing the events by which the giving of the law was prepared to have been prophetic figures also: not losing thereby any of their historic reality, but bearing to those who were able to see it aright, this deeper meaning. And to such persons, the fact of St. Paul and other sacred writers adducing such allegorical interpretations brings no surprise and no difficulty, but only strong confirmation of their belief that there are such deeper meanings lying hid under the O.T. history. That the Rabbis and the Fathers, holding such deeper senses, should have often missed them, and allegorized fancifully and absurdly, is nothing to the purpose: it is surely most illogical to argue that because they were wrong, St. Paul cannot be right. The only thing which really does create any difficulty in my mind, is, that Commentators with spiritual discernment, and appreciation of such a man as our Apostle, should content themselves with quietly casting aside his Scripture interpretation wherever, as here, it passes their comprehension. On their own view of him, it would be at least worth while to consider whether his knowledge of his own Scriptures may not have surpassed ours. But to those who believe that he had the Spirit of God, this passage speaks very solemnly; and I quite agree with Mr. Conybeare in his note on this place, “The lesson to be drawn from this whole passage, as regards the Christian use of the O.T., is of an importance which can scarcely be overrated.” Of course no one, who reads, marks, learns, and inwardly digests the Seriptures, can subscribe to the shallow and indolent dictum of Macknight, ‘This is to be laid down as a fixed rule, that<i> no ancient history is to be considered as allegorical, but that which inspired</i><i> persons have interpreted allegorically:</i> but at the same time, in allegorizing Scripture, he will take care to follow the analogy of the faith, and proceed soberly, and in dependence on that Holy Spirit, who alone can put us in possession of His own mind. in His word.’ Calvin’s remarks here are good: “As then the family of Abraham was the true Church, so it is beyond doubt that the chief and most memorable events which happened in it, are so many types to us. As there was allegory in circumcision, in sacrifices, in the whole Levitical priest-hood: as there is now in our sacraments,—so, I say, was there then in the family of Abraham. But that is no reason why we should give up the literal sense. It amounts to the same as if Paul said that a figure of the two Testaments in the two wives of Abraham, and of the two people in his two sons, is, as if in a picture, set forth to us.” Not the bare literal historical fact is in question here, but the inner character of God’s dealings with men, of which type, and prophecy, and the historical fact itself, are only so many exemplifications. The difference between the children of the bond-and the free, of the law and the promise, has been shewn out to the world before, by, and since the covenant of the law):<b> for these women</b> (the mothers are the covenants;—the sons, the children of the covenants)<b> are</b> (import in the allegory)<b> two covenants</b> (not<i> ‘revelations</i>,’ but lite-rally covenants between God and men);<b> one</b> (covenant)<b> (indeed) from Mount Sinai</b> (taking its origin from,—or having Mount Sinai as its centre),<b> gendering</b> (bringing forth children: compare the expression, Ye are the children (sons)... of the cove-nant, Acts iii. 25)<b> unto</b> (with a view to)<b> bondage, which one is</b> (identical in the allegory with)<b> Hagar</b>.
