<b> 25.] For the word Hagar is</b> (imports)<b> Mount Sinai, in Arabia</b> (i. e. among the Arabians. This rendering, which is Chrysostom’s— “Mount Sinai is called ‘Hagar’ in their vernacular tongue,”—is I conceive necessitated by the arrangement of the sentence us well as by the expression here, “<i>the word Hagar,</i>” not Hagar herself. Testimony has been adduced that the Arabs to this day call Mount Sinai Hadschar: and Chrysostom’s evidence is decisive for his own time. Cer-tainly we have<i> Hagar</i> as a geographical proper name in Arabia Petræa: the Chal-dee paraphrast always calls the wilderness of Shur<i> Hagra</i>. So that Jowett certainly speaks too strongly when he says, “the old explanations, that Hagar is the Arabic word for a rock or the Arabie noun for Mount Sinai, are destitute of foundation.” As to the improbability at which he hints, of St. Paul quoting Arabic words in writing to the Galatians, we may well suppose St. Panl to have become familiarized, during his sojourn there, with this name for the granite peaks of Sinai),<b> and corresponds</b> (viz. Hagar, which is the subject, not Mount Sinai, see below)<b> with the present Jerusalem</b> (i. e. Jerusalem under the law,—the Jerusalem of the Jews, as contrasted with the Jerusalem of the Messiah’s King-dom)<b>, for she</b> (<i>the present Jerusalem, not Hagar</i>)<b> is in slavery with her children.</b>
