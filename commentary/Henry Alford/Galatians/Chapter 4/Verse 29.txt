It runs, ‘and Sarah saw the son of Hagar mocking’—the Septuagint has, ‘sporting with her son Isaac.” ‘The Hebrew word is the same as that used when Lot seemed as one that “<i>mocked</i>” to his sons-in-law, Gen. xix. 14. And this would be quite ground enough for the word here, for the spirit of persecution was begun. So that we need not refer to tradition, as many have done, to account for St. Paul’s expression.<br><br><b> him [that was born] after the Spirit,</b> i.e. in virtue of the promise, which was given by the Spirit. Or,<i> ‘by virtue of the Spirit’s agency.’</i> but the other is better.
