<p><strong> 29</strong> .] ὁ κατ . σάρ . γεν ., see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:23">Galatians 4:23</span> . It has been thought that there is nothing in the Hebrew text to justify so strong a word as <strong> ἐδίωκεν</strong> <strong> .</strong> It runs, ‘and Sarah saw the son of Hagar … מְצַחֵק ’ ( παίζοντα μετὰ Ἰσαὰκ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς , LXX); and some deny that צָחַק ever means ‘he mocked.’ But certainly it does: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:14">Genesis 19:14</span> . And this would be quite ground enough for the ἐδίωκεν , for the spirit of persecution was begun. So that we need not refer to tradition, as many have done (even Ellic., whom see; Jowett, as unfortunately usual with him when impugning the accuracy of St. Paul, asserts rashly and confidently, that the sense in which the Apostle takes the Hebrew is inadmissible), to account for St. Paul’s expression.
