<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> ἡμεῖς</strong> are Jews only here included, or Jews and Gentiles? Clearly, <em> both</em> : for ἵνα τ . υἱοθεσ . ἀπολάβωμεν is spoken of all believers in Christ. He regards the Jews as, for this purpose, including all mankind (see note on ch. Gal 3:23 ), God’s only positive dealings by revelation being with them and the Gentiles as partakers both in their infant-discipline, and in their emancipation in Christ.

<p><strong> ὅτε ἦμεν νήπιοι</strong> refers, not to any immaturity of capacity in <em> us</em> , but to the lifetime of the church, as regarded in the προθεσμία τοῦ πατρός : see below on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span> .

<p><strong> τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου</strong> ] Aug. interprets this physically, of the worship of the elements of nature by the Gentiles: Chrys., Thdrt., al., of the Jewish new moons and sabbaths: Neander (Pfl. u. Leit. p. 370), of a religion of sense as opposed to that of the spirit. But it is more natural to take στοιχεῖα in its simpler meaning, that of <em> letters</em> or symbols of the alphabet, and τοῦ κόσμου not in its worst sense, but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:1">Hebrews 9:1</span> , ἅγιον κοσμικόν , ‘belonging to the unspiritual outer world.’ Thus (as in reff. Col.) the words will mean, the <strong> elementary lessons of outward things</strong> (as Conybeare has rendered it in his note: ‘outward ordinances,’ in his text, is not so good). Of this kind were all the enactments peculiar to the Law; some of which are expressly named, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:10">Galatians 4:10</span> . See στοιχεῖα well discussed in Ellicott’s note; and some useful remarks in Jowett, in loc.

<p>Meyer prefers taking ἦμεν and δεδουλωμένοι separate: ‘we were under the elements of the world, enslaved:’ as answering better to ὑπὸ ἐπιτρόπους ἐστίν above.</p>
