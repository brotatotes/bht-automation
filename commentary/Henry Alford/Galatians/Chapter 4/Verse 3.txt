 3 .]  ἡμεῖς are Jews only here included, or Jews and Gentiles? Clearly,  both : for ἵνα τ . υἱοθεσ . ἀπολάβωμεν is spoken of all believers in Christ. He regards the Jews as, for this purpose, including all mankind (see note on ch. Gal 3:23 ), God’s only positive dealings by revelation being with them and the Gentiles as partakers both in their infant-discipline, and in their emancipation in Christ.
	 ὅτε ἦμεν νήπιοι refers, not to any immaturity of capacity in  us , but to the lifetime of the church, as regarded in the προθεσμία τοῦ πατρός : see below on Galatians 4:4 .
	 τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου ] Aug. interprets this physically, of the worship of the elements of nature by the Gentiles: Chrys., Thdrt., al., of the Jewish new moons and sabbaths: Neander (Pfl. u. Leit. p. 370), of a religion of sense as opposed to that of the spirit. But it is more natural to take στοιχεῖα in its simpler meaning, that of  letters or symbols of the alphabet, and τοῦ κόσμου not in its worst sense, but as in Hebrews 9:1 , ἅγιον κοσμικόν , ‘belonging to the unspiritual outer world.’ Thus (as in reff. Col.) the words will mean, the  elementary lessons of outward things (as Conybeare has rendered it in his note: ‘outward ordinances,’ in his text, is not so good). Of this kind were all the enactments peculiar to the Law; some of which are expressly named, Galatians 4:10 . See στοιχεῖα well discussed in Ellicott’s note; and some useful remarks in Jowett, in loc.
	Meyer prefers taking ἦμεν and δεδουλωμένοι separate: ‘we were under the elements of the world, enslaved:’ as answering better to ὑπὸ ἐπιτρόπους ἐστίν above.
