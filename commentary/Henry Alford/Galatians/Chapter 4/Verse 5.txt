<p><strong> 5</strong> .] See above. Christ, being born under the law, a Jewish child, subject to its ordinances, by His perfect fulfilment of it, and by enduring, as the Head and in the root of our nature, its curse on the tree, bought off (from its curse and power, but see on ch. Gal 3:13 ) those who were under the law: and if them, then the rest of mankind, whose nature He had upon Him. Thus in buying off τοὺς ὑπὸ νόμον , He effected that ἡμεῖς , all men, τὴν υἱοθεσίαν ἀπολάβωμεν <strong> should receive</strong> (not ‘ <em> recover</em> ,’ as Aug., al., and Jowett (‘receive back’): there is no allusion to the innocence which we lost in Adam, nor was redemption by Christ in any sense a <em> recovery</em> of the state before the fall, but a far more glorious thing, the bestowal of an adoption which Adam never had. Nor is it, as Chrys., καλῶς εἶπεν , ἀπολάβωμεν , δεικνὺς ὀφειλομένην : it is true, it <em> was</em> the subject of promise, but it is the mere act of <em> reception</em> , not how or why it was received, which is here put forward. Nor again, with Rückert and Schött., must we render ἀπο ‘ <em> therefrom</em> ,’ as a fruit of the redemption. This again it <em> is</em> , but it is not expressed in the word) <strong> the adoption</strong> (the place, and privileges) <strong> of sons</strong> . The word υἱοθεσία occurs only in the N. T. In Herod. vi. 57 we have θετὸν παῖδα ποιέεσθαι , and the same expression in Diod. Sic. iv. 39.</p>
