<p><strong> 6</strong> .] Meyer interprets this verse with Chrys.: καὶ πόθεν δῆλον ὅτι γεγόναμεν υἱοί , φησίν ; εἶπε τρόπον ἕνα , ὅτι τὸν χριστὸν ἐνεδυσάμεθα τὸν ὄντα υἱόν · λέγει κ . δεύτερον , ὅτι τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς υἱοθεσίας ἐλάβομεν · οὐ γὰρ ἂν ἐδυνήθημεν καλέσαι πατέρα , εἰ μὴ πρότερον υἱοὶ κατέστημεν . And so Thdrt., Thl., Ambr., Pel., Koppe, Flatt, Rückert, Schött., and Ellicott. [Jowett combines both interpretations: but this can hardly be.] If so, we must assume a very unusual ellipsis after ὅτι δέ ἐστε υἱοί , one hardly justified by such precedents as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:18">Romans 11:18</span> , εἰ δὲ κατακαυχᾶσαι , οὐ σὺ τ . ῥίζαν βαστάζεις , κ . τ . λ ., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:15">Romans 11:15</span> , and supply, ‘God hath given you this proof, that.…’ Meyer urges in defence of his view the emphatic position of ἐστε , on which see below. I prefer the ordinary rendering because it suits best (1) the simplicity of construction, the causal ὅτι thus beginning a sentence followed by an apodosis, as in ref., whereas we have no example of the demonstrative ὅτι followed by the ellipsis here supposed: cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:11">Galatians 3:11</span> , where δῆλον follows: (2) the context; it is not in <em> corroboration</em> of the fact that we are sons, but as a <em> consequence</em> of that fact, that the Apostle states what follows: to shew the completeness of the state of sonship. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span> , the order of these is inverted, and the witness of the Spirit <em> proves</em> our sonship: but that does not affect the present passage, which must stand on its own ground. (3) The aorist ἐξαπέστειλεν is against Meyer’s view it would be in that case ἐξαπέσταλκεν . It is now used of the time of the gift of the Spirit. Render then: <strong> Because moreover ye are sons</strong> (the stress on ἐστε is hardly to be urged: υἱοί ἐστε would certainly give a very strong emphasis on the <em> noun</em> : all we can say of ἐστε υἱοί , where so insignificant a word as a verb substantive is concerned, is that there is now no such strong stress on υἱοί , but that the <em> whole fact</em> , of the state of sonship having been brought in, and actually existing, is alleged) <strong> God sent forth</strong> (not, ‘ <em> hath sent forth</em> ’ see above) <strong> the Spirit of His Son</strong> (you being now fellows with that Son in the communion of the Spirit, won for you as a consequence of His atonement: called, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span> , πνεῦμα υἱοθεσίας , and ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span> , πνεῦμα χριστοῦ , where participation in Him is said to be the necessary condition of belonging to Christ at all) <strong> into our hearts</strong> (as he changed from the third person to the first in the foregoing verse, so now from the second: both times from the fervour of his heart, wavering between logical accuracy and generous largeness of sympathy), <strong> crying</strong> (in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span> , it is ἐν ᾧ κράζομεν . Here the Spirit being the main subject, is regarded as the agent, and the believer merely as His organ) <strong> Abba Father</strong> . ὁ πατήρ is not a mere Greek explanation of Ἀββᾶ , but an address by His name of relation, of Him to whom the term Ἀββᾶ was used more as a token of affection than as conveying its real meaning of ‘my father:’ see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span> . Aug. gives a fanciful reason for the repetition: “Eleganter autem intelligitur non frustra duarum linguarum verba posuisse idem significantia propter universum populum, qui de Judæis et de Gentilibus in unitatem fidei vocatus est: ut Hebræum verbum ad Judæos, Græcum ad gentes, utriusque tamen verbi eadem significatio ad ejusdem fidei spiritusque unitatem pertineat.” And so Luther, Calvin, and Bengel.</p>
