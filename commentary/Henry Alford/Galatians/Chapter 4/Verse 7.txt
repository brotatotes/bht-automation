<b> 7.]</b> Statement of the conclusion from the foregoing, and corroboration, from it, of ch, iii. 29. The second person singular individualizes and points home the inference. This individualization has been gradually proceeding from ver. 5— “<i>that we may receive</i>”— “<i>ye are</i>”— “<i>thou art</i>.”<br><br><b> through God]</b> The received reading, “<i>of God through Christ</i>,” seems to have been an adaptation to the parallel text in Rom. viii. 17.—On the text, Windischmann remarks, “<b>Through God</b> combines, on behalf of our race, the whole before-mentioned agency of the Blessed Trinity: the Father hath sent the Son and the Spirit, the Son has freed us from the law, the Spirit has completed our sonship; and thus the redeemed are heirs through the tri-une God Himself, not through the law, nor through fleshly descent.”<br><br><b> 8] at that time</b> refers back, not to ver. 3, but to the time referred to in ver. 7, when they were as bond-servants.—In the assertion that they<i> knew not God,</i> there is no inconsistency with Rom. i. 21: there it is the knowledge which the Gentile world might have had: here, the matter of fact is alleged, that they<i> had it not.</i><b> ye served gods which by nature exist not:</b> see 1 Cor. viii. 4; x. 19, 20 and note. The received reading would mean, “<i>those which are not by nature gods,</i>” i.e. only men, made into gods by human fancy: but this is not the Apostle’s way of conceiving of the heathen deities.
