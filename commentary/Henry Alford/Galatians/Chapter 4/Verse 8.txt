Meyer compares <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+13:9">2 Chronicles 13:9</span> , ἐγένετο εἰς ἱερέα τῷ μὴ ὄντι θεῷ . Notice μή giving the Apostle’s judgment of their non-existence and see 2Co 5:21 note, where however I cannot hold with Ellic., that μὴ γνόντα expresses ‘ <em> God’s judgment</em> ’ (?).</p>
