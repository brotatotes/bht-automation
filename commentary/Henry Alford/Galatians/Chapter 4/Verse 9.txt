<b> 9. or rather are known of (by) God]</b> See note on 1 Cor. viii. 3. Here the propriety of the expression is even more strikingly manifest than there: the Galatians did not so much acquire the knowledge of God, as they were taken into knowledge, recognized, by Him. And this made their fall from Him the more matter of indignant appeal, as being a resistance of His will respecting them. No change of the meaning of<b> known</b> must be resorted to, as<i> ‘approved</i>,’<i> ‘loved</i>:’ compare Matt. xxv. 12; 2 Tim. ii. 19: also Phil. ii. 12.<br><br><b> weak]</b> so the<i> commandment that went before</i> is called in Heb. vii. 18,<i> weak and unprofitable.</i> Want of power to<i> justify</i> is that to which the word points here.<br><br><b> beggarly]</b> in contrast with the riches which are in Christ. Or both words may perhaps refer back to the state of childhood hinted at in ver. 6, during which the heir is<i> weak</i>, as immature, and<i> a beggar,</i> as not yet in possession. But this would not strictly apply to the<i> rudiments</i> as the Gentiles were concerned with them: see below.<br><br><b> again]</b> These Galatians had never been<i> Jews</i> before: but they had been before under the<i> rudiments of the world,</i> under which generic term both Jewish and Gentile worship was comprised: so that they were turning back again to these rudiments.<br><br><b> again from the beginning to be in bondage:</b> i.e. to begin afresh your whole course of servitude.
