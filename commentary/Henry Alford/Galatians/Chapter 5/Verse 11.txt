<b> 11.]</b> The connexion appears to be this: the Apostle had apparently been charged with being a favourer of circumcision in other churches; as shewn e.g. by his having circumcised Timothy. After the preceding sharp denunciation of “<i>him that troubleth you</i>,” and “<i>whosoever he be</i>,” it is open to the adversaries to say, that Paul himself was one of their<i> troublers</i>, by his inconsistency. In the abruptness then of his fervid thoughts he breaks out in this self-defence.<br><br><b> I,</b> emphatic as before, is best understood as referring, not to any change in his preaching as an Apostle (for he appears always to have been of the same mind, and certainly was from the first persecuted by the Jews), but to the change since his conversion, before which he was a strenuous upholder of Judaism. It has been objected to this that the word<b> preach</b> could not be used at that period. But this (even if it be necessary to press the<i> preaching</i> so far into matter of fact) cannot be said with any certainty:—the course of Saul as a zealot may have often led him even to preach, if not circumcision in its present debated position, yet that strict Judaism of which it formed a part.<br><br><b> why am I still persecuted?]</b><i> still</i> is logical, i.e.,<b> what further excuse is there for my being</b> (as I am)<b> persecuted</b> (by the Jews)<b>?—For,</b> if this is so, if I still preach circumcision,<b> then is brought to nought,</b> is done away,<b> the OFFENCE</b> (this word has the emphasis)<b> of the cross—</b>because, if circumcision, and not faith in Christ crucified, be the condition of salvation, then the cross has lost its offensive character to the Jew: ‘For not even the cross did so much scandalize the Jews, as the having to leave off obeying the fathers’ laws. For when they brought up Stephen, they did not allege against him that he worshipped Him who had been crucified, but that he spoke against the law and the holy place.” Chrysostom.
