<b> 12.]</b> The verse introduces a climax—<b>I would that they who are unsettling you would even....</b> As to the verb which follows, (1) it cannot be passive, as A.V., ‘<i>were even cut of.’</i> (2) It can hardly mean ‘<i>would cut themselves off from your communion</i>,’ as the<i> even</i> is against so mild a wish, besides that this sense of the word is unexampled. (3) The only admissible sense of the word is one carrying harshness, and more, to our ears; viz.<i> amputation</i>. And (4) such a meaning of the word is that in which (agreeably to its primitive classical sense, of hewing off limbs) it is used by the Septuagint translators in Deut. xxiii. 1, and by other authors. It seems to me that this sense<i> must be adopted,</i> in spite of the protests raised against it. And so Chrysostom and the great consensus of ancient and modern Commentators: and, as Jowett very properly observes, “the common interpretation of the Fathers, confirmed by the use of language in the Septuagint version, is not to be rejected only because it is displeasing to the delicacy of modern times.”
