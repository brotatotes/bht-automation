<b> 14.]</b> See Rom. xiii. 8, 9.— “The question, how the Apostle can rightly say of the<i> whole</i> law, that it is fulfilled by loving one’s neighbour, must not be answered by understanding<b> the law</b> of the<i> Christian</i> law, or of the<i> moral</i> law only, or of the<i> second</i> table of the decalogue, or of every divinely revealed law in general;—<b>for the whole law</b> cannot, from the circumstances of the whole Epistle, mean any thing but ‘<i>the whole law</i> of Moses;’—but by placing ourselves on the lofty spiritual level from which St. Paul looked down, and saw all other commands of the Jaw so far subordinated to the law of love, that whoever had fulfilled<i> this</i> command, must be treated as having fulfilled the whole.” Meyer: who also remarks that<b> thy neighbour</b> applies to fellow-Christians; compare one another below.<b> 15.] one another</b> has both times the emphasis. Chrysostom says, “He has chosen his words with descriptive purpose. For he says not only<b> ye bite,</b> which is the act, of a man enraged, but also<b> ye devour,</b> which belongs to one persisting in his crime. He that bites gives way to a paroxysm of anger: but he that devours, gives example of the fiercest brutality. And he is speaking of bites and devourings which are not corporeal, but far more savage. For he is not so noxious who eats human flesh, as he who fixes his bites on the soul: for by how much the soul is more precious than the body, by so much more savage is the wounding it.” The literal sense must be kept,—<b>consumed</b> (by one another),—your spiritual life altogether annihilated: “for dissension and strife is corruptive both of the defenders and of the aggressors, and eats out every thing worse than the moth.” Chrysostom.<b> 16–26.]</b><i> Exhortation to a spiritual life, and warning against the works of the flesh.</i>
