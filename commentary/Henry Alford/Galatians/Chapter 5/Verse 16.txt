 16 .]  λέγω δέ refers to Gal 5:13 repeating, and explaining it q. d., ‘What I mean, is this.’
	 πνεύματι , the  normal dative, of the rule, or manner, after or in which: Meyer quotes Hom. II. ο . 194, οὔτι Διὸς βέομαι φρεσίν :  by the Spirit . But  πν  . is not man’s ‘  spiritual part ,’ as Beza, Rück., De W., al.; nor is  πνεύματι ‘  after a spiritual manner ,’ Peile, nor will ἡ ἐνοικοῦσα χάρις give the force of πνεῦμα (Thdrt.): it is (as in Gal 5:5 )  the Holy Spirit of God : this will be clear on comparing with our Galatians 5:16-18 , the more expanded parallel passage, Rom 7:22 to Romans 8:11 . The history of the verbal usage is, that πνεῦμα , as χριστός and θεός , came to be used as a proper name: so that the supposed distinction between τὸ πν . as the objective (the Holy Ghost), and πν . as the subjective (man’s spirit), does not hold.
	 σαρκός ]  the natural man : that whole state of being in the flesh, out of which spring the practices and thoughts of Galatians 5:19 .
	 οὐ μὴ τελέσητε ] Is this (1) merely  future in meaning, and a sequence on πνεύματι περιπ ., ‘and ye shall not fulfil,’ or is it (2)  imperative , ‘and fulfil not?’ Ellic. in his note has shewn that this latter meaning is allowable, it being doubtful even in classical Greek whether there are not some instances of οὐ μή with the second person subjunctive imperatively used, and the tendency of later Greek being rather to use the subjunctive aorist for the future. And Meyer defends it on exegetical grounds. But surely (1) is much to be preferred on these same grounds. For the next and following verses go to shew just what this verse will then assert, viz. that the Spirit and the flesh  exclude one another .
