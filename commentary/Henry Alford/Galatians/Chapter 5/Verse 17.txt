<b> 17.]</b><i> Substantiation of the preceding,—that if ye walk by the Spirit, ye shalt not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.</i>—The second<b> for</b> gives a reason for the continual<i> lusting</i> of these two against one another: viz., that they are opposites.<br><br><b> that ye may not]</b> not, as A.V., “<i>so that ye cannot.</i>” The purpose of this strife is, on the part of the Spirit, to keep you from doing the things of the flesh, and<i> vice versa</i>: your own desires being, in each case, set aside by the combatants. See this verse expanded in Rom. vii. viii. as above: in vii. 20 we have nearly the same words, and the same construction. It is true that the will there is alleged only on one side, the better will, striving after good: whereas here it must. be taken in both senses, for ‘will’ in general, to whichever way inclined. So that our verse requires expansion, both in the direction of Rom. vii. 15–20,—and in the other direction, “for the evil that I desire (after the natural man) I do not: but the good that I desire not, that I do,”—to make it logically complete.
