Gal 5:23 ): the law is made for the flesh, and the works of the flesh: the Spirit and flesh ἀντίκεινται :  if ( δέ bringing out the contrast between the treatment of  both in Galatians 5:17 , and the selection of  one side in this verse)  then ye are led by (see Rom. ref., ὅσοι … πνεύματι θεοῦ ἄγονται , οὗτοι υἱοί εἰσιν θεοῦ )  the Spirit, ye are not under the law .
