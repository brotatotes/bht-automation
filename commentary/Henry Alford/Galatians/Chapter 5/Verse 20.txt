 20 .]  εἰδωλ  . , in its proper meaning of  idolatry : not, as Olsh., ‘  sins of lust ,’ because of the unclean orgies of idolatry.
	 φαρμ  . , either ‘  poisonings ,’ or ‘  sorceries .’ The latter is preferable, as more frequently its sense in the LXX and N. T. (reff.), and because (Mey.) Asia was particularly addicted to sorceries ( Act 19:19 ).
	 θυμοί ]  passionate outbreaks . θυμὸς μέν ἐστι πρόσκαιρος , ὀργὴ δὲ πολυχρόνιος μνησικακία , Ammonius. διαφέρει δὲ θυμὸς ὀργῆς , τῷ θυμὸν μὲν εἶναι ὀργὴν ἀναθυμιωμένην κ . ἔτι ἐκκαιομένην , ὀργὴν δὲ ὄρεξιν ἀντιτιμωρήσεως . Orig. sel. in Psalms 2:0 , vol. ii. 541: both cited by Trench, Syn. p. 146.

Don. ii. 7 (9), vol. ix. p. 471): “  Schisma est recens congregationis ex aliquâ sententiarum diversitate dissensio:  hæresis autem schisma inveteratum.” But we must not think of an ecclesiastical meaning only, or chiefly here.
