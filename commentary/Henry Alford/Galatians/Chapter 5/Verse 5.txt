<p><strong> 5</strong> .] Proof (hence γάρ ) of ἐξεπ . τ . χάρ ., by statement e contrario of the condition and hope of <em> Christians</em> . Emphasis (1) on <strong> ἡμεῖς</strong> , as opposed to οἵτινες ἐν νόμῳ δικαιοῦσθε , (2) on <strong> πνεύματι</strong> (not ‘ <em> mente</em> ’ (Fritz.), nor ‘ <em> spiritually</em> ,’ Middleton, al., but by the (Holy) Spirit, reff.), as opposed to σαρκί , the fleshly state of those under the law, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:29">Galatians 4:29</span> , (3) on <strong> ἐκ πίστεως</strong> , as opposed to ἐν νόμῳ , which involves ἐξ ἔργων .

<p><strong> ἐλπίδα δικαιοσύνης</strong> ] Is this genitive <em> objective</em> , the hope of righteousness, i.e. the hope whose object is perfect righteousness, or <em> subjective</em> , the hope of righteousness, i.e. the hope which the righteous entertain viz. that of eternal life? Certainly I think the <em> former</em> : for this reason, that ἐλπίδα has the emphasis, and ἐλπίδα δικ . ἀπεκδεχ . answers to δικαιοῦσθε above ‘ <em> Ye</em> think ye <em> have</em> your righteousness in the law: <em> we</em> , on the contrary, anxiously wait for the hope of righteousness (full and perfect).’ The phrase ἀπεκδέχεσθαι ἐλπίδα may be paralleled, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:15">Acts 24:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span> ; Eur. Alcest. 130, τίν ʼ ἔτι βίου ἐλπίδα προσδέχωμαι ; Polyb. viii. 21. 7, ταῖς προσδοκωμέναις ἐλπίσιν .</p>
