 6 .] Confirmation of the words ἐκ πίστεως , Galatians 5:5 .
	 ἐν χριστῷ , in Christ, as an element, in union with Christ, = in the state of a Christian: notice χρ . Ἰησ ., not Ἰησ . χρ .: in Christ, and that Christ, Jesus of Nazareth.
	 ἐνεργουμένη , not passive, but middle, as always in N. T. See reff. and notes on those places: also Fritzsche’s note on Romans 7:5 . “ ἐνεργεῖν ,  vim exercere de  personis , ἐνεργεῖσθαι ,  ex se (aut  suam )  vim exercere de  rebus collocavit, Galatians 5:6 ; Col 1:29 ; 1Th 2:13 al., ut h. l. Passivo (cf. ἐνεργεῖται πόλεμος , Polyb. i. 13. 5; Jos. Antt. xv. 5. 3) nunquam Paulus usus est.” The older Romanist Commentators (Bellarm., Est.) insisted on the passive sense as favouring the dogma of  fides formata , for which it is cited by the Council of Trent, sess. vi. cap. 7, de Justific. And the modern Romanist Commentators, though abandoning the passive sense, still claim the passage on their side (e.g. Windischmann); but without reason; love is the  modus operandi of faith,  that which justifies , however, is  not love , but  faith ; nor can a passage be produced, where St. Paul says we are justified by ‘faith working by love,’ but it is ever by faith only. One is astonished at the boldness of such a generally calm and fair writer as Windischmann, in claiming the passage for the Tridentine doctrine, even when the passive interpretation, which was all it had to lay hold on, is given up.
	As parallels to our passage, see Romans 14:17 ; 1 Corinthians 7:19 .
