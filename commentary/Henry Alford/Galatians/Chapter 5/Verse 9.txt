<b> 9.] leaven</b> may allude either to men, or to doctrine. In the parallel place in 1 Cor. v. 6, it is moral influence; so also where our Lord uses the same figure, Matt.<i> leaven</i> means<i> doctrine</i>. Nor can there be any objection to taking it as abstract, and “<i>lump</i>” concrete: a little false doctrine corrupts the whole mass (of Christians).
