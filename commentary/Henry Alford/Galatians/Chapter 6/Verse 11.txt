<b> 11—end.]</b> POSTSCRIPT AND BENEDICTION.<br><br><b> 11.] See in how large letters</b> (in what great and apparently unsightly characters: see note on next verse. ‘The original will not bear the rendering<i> how large a letter</i>, as A.V.)<b> I have written</b> (not referring to the following verses only, but to the whole Epistle, see below)<b> unto you with my own hand.</b> I do not see how it is possible to avoid the inference that these words apply to the whole Epistle. If they had reference only to the passage in which they occur, would not “<i>am writing</i>” have been used, as in 2 Thess. iii. 17? Again, there is no break in style here, indicating the end of the dictated portion, and the beginning of the written, as in Rom. xvi. 25; 2 Thess. iii. 17 al. I should rather believe, that on account of the peculiar character of this Epistle, St. Paul wrote it<i> all with his own hand</i>,—as he did the pastoral Epistles: and I find confirmation of this, in the partial resemblance of its style to those Epistles. (See Introduction, as above on ver. 9.) And he wrote it, whether from weakness of his eyes, or from choice, in large characters.
