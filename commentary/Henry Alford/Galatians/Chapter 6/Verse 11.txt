 11 .]  See in how large letters (in what great and apparently unsightly characters: see note on next verse.  πηλίκοις will not bear the rendering (1) ‘  how many ,’ πόσοις , or (2) ‘  what sort ,’ ποίοις : but only (3)  how great (reff.). Nor can (3) be made to mean (1) by taking γράμματα for ‘Epistle,’ a sense unknown to St. Paul)  I wrote (not strictly the epistolary  scribebam , nor referring to the following verses only: but the aorist spoken as at the time when they would receive the Epistle, and referring I believe to the whole of it, see also below)  with my own hand . I do not see how it is possible to avoid the inference that these words apply to the whole Epistle. If they had reference only to the passage in which they occur, would not γράφω have been used, as in 2Th 3:17 ? Again, there is no break in style here, indicating the end of the dictated portion, and the beginning of the written, as in Rom 16:25 ; 2Th 3:17 al. I should rather believe, that on account of the peculiar character of this Epistle, St. Paul wrote it all with his own hand, as he did the pastoral Epistles: and I find confirmation of this, in the partial resemblance of its style to those Epistles. (See Prolegomena, as above on Galatians 6:9 .) And he wrote it, whether from weakness of his eyes, or from choice, in large characters.
