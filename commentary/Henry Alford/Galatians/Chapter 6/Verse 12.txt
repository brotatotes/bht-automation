<p><strong> 12</strong> .] As my Epistle, so my practice: I have no desire to make a fair show outwardly: my γράμματα are not εὐπρόσωπα (is there a further allusion to the same point in ὅσοι τῷ <strong> κανόνι</strong> τούτῳ στοιχήσουσιν , and even in <strong> στίγματα</strong> , below?) and I have no sympathy with these θέλοντες εὐπροσωπῆσαι ἐν σαρκί . The word εὐπροσωπεῖν occurs only here: but we have φαινοπροσωπεῖν , Cic. Att. vii. 21; xiv. 21: σεμνοπροσωπεῖν , Aristoph. Nub. 363.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν σαρκί</strong> , not merely ‘ <em> in the flesh</em> ,’ but <strong> in outward things</strong> , which belong to man’s natural state: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:19">Galatians 5:19</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> οὗτοι</strong> <strong> , it is these who</strong> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:7">Galatians 6:7</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀναγκάζουσιν</strong> ] <strong> are compelling: go about to compel</strong> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τῷ σταυρῷ</strong> ] dative of the cause, see reff. Winer would understand ‘ <em> should be persecuted with the Cross</em> (i.e. with sufferings like the Cross) <em> of Christ</em> .’ But apart from other objections which I do not feel, however, so strongly as Ellic.), surely this would have been otherwise expressed by τοῖς παθήμασιν or the like.</p>
