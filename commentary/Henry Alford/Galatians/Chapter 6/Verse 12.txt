 12 .] As my Epistle, so my practice: I have no desire to make a fair show outwardly: my γράμματα are not εὐπρόσωπα (is there a further allusion to the same point in ὅσοι τῷ  κανόνι τούτῳ στοιχήσουσιν , and even in  στίγματα , below?) and I have no sympathy with these θέλοντες εὐπροσωπῆσαι ἐν σαρκί . The word εὐπροσωπεῖν occurs only here: but we have φαινοπροσωπεῖν , Cic. Att. vii. 21; xiv. 21: σεμνοπροσωπεῖν , Aristoph. Nub. 363.
	 ἐν σαρκί , not merely ‘  in the flesh ,’ but  in outward things , which belong to man’s natural state: see ch. Galatians 5:19 .
	 οὗτοι  , it is these who : see Galatians 6:7 .
	 ἀναγκάζουσιν ]  are compelling: go about to compel .
	 τῷ σταυρῷ ] dative of the cause, see reff. Winer would understand ‘  should be persecuted with the Cross (i.e. with sufferings like the Cross)  of Christ .’ But apart from other objections which I do not feel, however, so strongly as Ellic.), surely this would have been otherwise expressed by τοῖς παθήμασιν or the like.
