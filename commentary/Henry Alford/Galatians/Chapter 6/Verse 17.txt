<b> 17. trouble me]</b> How? by rebellious conduct and denying his apostolic authority, seeing that it was stamped with so powerful a seal as he proceeds to state.<br><br><b> for I]</b> (emphatic)<b> for it is I</b> (not the Judaizing teachers)<b> who carry</b> (perhaps as in ver. 5, and ch. v. 10,—bear, as a burden: but Chrysostom’s idea seems more adapted to the<i> triumphant</i> character of the sentence: “He saith not, ‘<i>I have</i>,’ but ‘<i>I bear, as one who is proud of trophies or royal standards</i>”)<b> in</b> (on)<b> my body the marks of Jesus.</b> The word used,<i> stigmata,</i> implies, the marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners. These marks, in St. Paul’s case, were of course<i> the scars of his wounds received in the service of his Master</i>—cf. 2 Cor. xi. 23 ff.<br><br><b> of Jesus</b> is the genitive of possession: Jesus’s marks, shewing that I belong to Him. There is no allusion whatever to any similarity between himself and our Lord, ‘the marks which Jesus bore:’ such an allusion would be quite irrelevant: and with its irrelevancy falls a whole fabric of disgusting Romanist superstition which has been raised on this verse, and which the fair and learned Windischmann, giving as he does the honest interpretation here, yet attempts to defend in a supplemental note.—Neither can we naturally suppose any comparison intended between these his “<i>stigmata</i>” as Christ’s servant, and<i> circumcision:</i> for he is not now on that subject, but on his<i> authority as sealed by Christ:</i> and such a comparison is alien from the majesty of the sentence.
