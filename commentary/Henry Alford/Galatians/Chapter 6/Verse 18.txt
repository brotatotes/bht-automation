No special intention need be suspected in the words<b> with your spirit</b> (as Chrysostom does, saying, “He thus dissuades them from fleshly reliance”), seeing that the same expression occurs at the end of other Epistles: see Phil. iv. 28; Philem. 25; 2 Tim. iv. 22. I should rather regard it as a deep expression of his Christian love, which is further carried on by<b> brethren</b>, the last word,—parting from them, after an Epistle of such rebuke and warning, in the fulness of brotherhood in Christ.
