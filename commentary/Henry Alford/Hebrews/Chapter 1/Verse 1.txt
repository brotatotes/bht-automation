<b> CHAP. I. 1–II. 18.]</b> AFTER MANIFOLD REVELATIONS IN FORMER TIMES, GOD HAS NOW REVEALED HIMSELF TO US IN HIS SON (i, 1–4), WHO IS GREATER THAN THE ANGELS, THE DISPENSERS OF THE LAW (i, 4–14; inference, ii, 1–4), THOUGH FOR A TIME HE WAS MADE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS, AND SUBJECTED TO SUFFERINGS, IN ORDER TO BE, AS OUR HIGH PRIEST, OUR RECONCILER TO GOD (ii. 5–18). And herein (i. 1–4),<i> introduction and statement of position.</i><br><br><b> 1.] In many portions</b> (or ‘parts,’ manifoldly as regards the<i> distribution</i>. “For not<i> all</i> things, nor<i> the same</i> things, were revealed to all the prophets, but the parts of great mysteries were distributed among them. E.g., Isaiah was inspired to foretell Christ’s birth from a virgin, and His Passion: Daniel, the time of His Advent: Jonah, His burial: Malachi, the coming of His Forerunner. And again some had more, others less, revealed to them.” Estius,<i> ‘At sundry times’</i> (A. V.) is not an accurate rendering, nor can it he said to<i> express</i> the meaning:<i> time</i> is a historical condition of the sequence of parts,—<i>persons to whom,</i> an anthropological condition,—but it does not follow that<i> ‘at sundry times’</i> or<i> ‘to sundry persons,’ gives the force of ‘in divers parts:’</i> because it might be the same thing which was revealed again and again. This revelation in portions, by fragments, in and by various persons, was necessarily an imperfect revelation, to which the one final manifestation in and by One Person is properly and logically opposed)<b> and in divers manners</b> ( “in one way was He seen by Abraham, in another by Moses, in another by Elijah, in another by Michaiah. Isaiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel saw differing forms of vision.” Theodoret. Bleek remarks, that in Numb. xii. 6–8, the diversity of manner of revelation is recognized: dreams and visions being set beneath that open speaking, mouth to mouth, which the Lord used towards His servant Moses. It will be seen, that I cannot agree with Chrysostom and many others in regarding the two adverbs as a mere rhetorical redundance,—meaning merely, “differently.” Both set forth the imperfection of the Old Test. revelations. They were various in nature and in form: fragments of the whole truth, presented in manifold forms, in shifting hues of separated colour: Christ is the full revelation of God, Himself the pure light, uniting in His one Person the whole spectrum: see below on ver. 3)<b> in time past</b> (generally interpreted of the Old Test. period, ending with Malachi. But there is no need for cutting off the period there. In the interim between Malachi and the Writer’s time, though the Old Test. canon was closed, we cannot say that God’s manifold revelations of Himself had absolutely ceased. Nay, strictly speaking, the Baptist himself be-longed to the former, though he pointed on to the latter period. No doubt he was not here in the Writer’s view, and the period of former revelations is here regarded as distinct from the final Christian one: but for all that, we must not put an artificial terminus where he puts none)<b> God having spoken to the fathers</b> (so in reff. The term<i> “the fathers”</i> is absolutely used in John vii. 22; Acts xiii. 32; Rom. ix. 5; xi. 28; xv. 8; 2 Pet. iii. 4. It is evident from this term being common to the Writer and his readers, where no reference is made to Jews in the context [as in Rom. ix. 5], that he was writing as 4 Jew and to Jews)<b> in</b> (not equivalent to<i> “by,”</i> though it includes it. The<b> in</b> designates the<i> element in which</i> the<i> speaking</i> takes place, and holds therefore its own proper force. God spoke<i> in</i> the prophets, being resident in them. Bengel draws a distinction,—a human king speaks by his ambassadors, but not in them)<b> the prophets</b> (to be taken here apparently in the wider sense,—as including not only those whose inspired writings form the Old Test. canon, but all who were vehicles of the divine self-manifestation to the Fathers. Thus Enoch in Jude 14 is said to have<i> prophesied</i>. Moses is of course included, and indeed would on any view be the<i> chief</i> of those here spoken of, seeing that by him the greater part of God’s revelation of Himself to the fathers was made).
