<b> 11.] they</b> (seems most naturally to refer to<i> the heavens</i> immediately preceding. There is no reason in the Psalm why the pronoun should not represent both antecedents, the heavens and the earth. Here, however, the subsequent context seems to determine the application to be only to the heavens: for to them only can be referred the following image,<i> “as a vesture shalt thou fold thein up”</i>)<b> shall perish</b> (as far as concerns their present state. Compare the parallel expression,<i> “shall be changed,”</i> below);<b> but thou remainest</b> (Bleck prefers the future, on the ground of the verbs being all future in the Hebrew text. But perhaps the consideration alleged by Lümemann, that the Writer, using only the Septuagint, seems to place<i> “but thou remainest”</i> and<i> “but thou art the same,”</i> as parallel clauses, is of more weight than the other. De Wette, on the Psalm, renders the Hebrew verbs<i> present.</i> The verb in the original is a compound one, giving the sense of endurance through all changes);<b> and they all shall wax old as a garment</b> (see Isa. li. 6,<i> “The earth shall wax old like a garment:”</i> also Isa. l. 9; and Ecclus. xiv. 17);<b> and as a mantle</b> (the word signifies any enveloping, enwrapping garment)<b> shalt thou fold them up</b> (the Hebrew here, and apparently some copies of the Septuagint, have the same verb as below:<i> “thou shalt change them,”</i>— “thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed.” But the Alexandrine MS. reads as our text: and there can be little doubt that the Writer of this Epistle followed that text as usual),<b> and they shall be changed</b> (viz. as a mantle is folded up to be put away when a fresh one is about to be put on):<b> but thou art the same</b> (Hebrew, “and Thou art He:” viz., He, which thou hast ever been: compare Isa. xlvi. 4),<b> and thy years shall not fail</b> (Hebrew, “Thy years end not,” are never completed. The account to be given of Psalm cii. seems to be as follows: according to its title it is “a prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.” It was probably written during the Babylonian exile (compare vv. 14, 15) by one who “waited for the consolation of Israel.” That consolation was to be found only in Israel’s covenant God, and the Messiah Israel’s deliverer. And the trust of Israel in this her Deliverer was ever directed to the comfort of her sons under the immediate trouble of the time, be that what it might. As generations went on, more and more was revealed of the Messiah’s office and work, and the hearts of God’s people entered deeper and deeper into the consolation to be derived from the hope of His coming. Here then we have this sorrowing one casting himself on the mercy of the great Deliverer, and extolling his faithfulness and firmness over, and as distinguished from, all the works of His hands. To apply then these words to the Redeemer, is to use them in their sense of strictest propriety).
