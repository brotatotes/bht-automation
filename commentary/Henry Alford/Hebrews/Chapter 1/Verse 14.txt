<b> 14.] Are they not all</b> (all the angels)<b> ministering</b> (in reference probably to the word<i> “ministers”</i> in ver. 7. The word, signifying<i> “pertaining to the ministry,”</i> is used in the Septuagint of any thing pertaining to the<i> ministers</i> or their service; the instruments, vessels, garments, or offerings for the ministry: here, of those devoted to or belonging to the ministry of God)<b> spirits</b> (unembodied beings, even as God Himself, but distinguished by the epithet<i> presiding.</i> The idea of “angels of service” or “of the ministry,” is familiar to the rabbis),<b> sent forth</b> (it is the<i> present participle,</i> so also in Rev. v. 6: he does not mean that angels have before now, in insulated cases, been sent forth, but that they are ever thus being sent forth,—it is their normal work and regular duty through all the ages of time)<b> for ministry</b> (in order to the ministration which is their work. The A.V., “sent forth to minister for them,” gives a wrong idea of the meaning. The<i> ministry</i> is not a<i> waiting upon men,</i> but a fulfilment of their office as<i> ministers of God.</i> See Rom. xiii. 4. Compare with this expression Col. i. 7,<i> “a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf”</i>)<b> on behalf of those who are about to inherit salvation</b> (in the highest sense—eternal salvation: not, as Kuinoel and others, “deliverance from dangers:” in so solemn a reference, that meaning would be quite beside the purpose. Those spoken of are the elect of God, they who love Him, and for whom all things work together for good, even the principalities and powers in heavenly places. And if it be said, that the ministration of angels has often been used for other immediate purposes than the behoof of the elect, we may answer, that all those things may well come under the<i> ministry,</i> on account of<i> them who shall be heirs of salvation</i>: for all things are theirs; and for them, in and as united to Christ, all events are ordered)? Thus the Son of God is proved superior to the angels—i. e. to the highest. of created beings: who, so far from being equal with Him, worship Him, and serve His purposes.
