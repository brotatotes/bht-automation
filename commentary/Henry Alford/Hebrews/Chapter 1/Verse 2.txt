<b> 2.] at the end of these days</b> (in order to understand this expression, it will be well to call to mind certain Jewish modes of speaking of time. The Rabbis divided the whole of time into<i> “this age,”</i> and<i> “the age to come.”</i> The days of the Messiah were regarded as a period of transition from the former to the latter,—His appearance, as the ushering in of the termination of<i> “these days,”</i> the beginning of the end,—and His second coming in glory as the accomplishment of<i> “these days”</i> or<i> “this age.”</i> And with this, New Test. usage agrees,—see 1 Pet. i. 20; James v. 3; Jude 18; 2 Pet. iii. 3. Thus<b> at the end of these days</b> would mean, ‘at the end of<i> this age,’</i> in the technical sense of these words as signifying the whole world-period, the latter boundary of which is the Resurrection. And thus is the manifestation of Christ in the flesh ever spoken of, and especially in this Epistle; compare ch. ix. 26; and notes on ch. ii. 5; vi. 5. Stuart has mistaken the meaning, in rendering<i> ‘during the last dispensation,’</i> and making<i> “these”</i> to import that the period had already<i> begun</i>. It is not of a beginning, but of an<i> expiring</i> period, the Writer is speaking. The ancient expositors principally use these words as ground of<i> consolation:</i> those who were in conflict would be consoled on hearing that it was soon to end)<b> spake</b> (not<i> ‘hath spoken:’</i> the<b> end</b> just spoken of is looked back on as a definite point, at which the divine revelation took place. The attention of the readers is thus directed not so much to the present state in which they are, as to the act of God towards them)<b> unto us</b> (i. e. all who have heard that voice, or to whom it is to be announced. There is no distinction between those who received God’s revelation immediately from the Son, and those who received immediately through others.<br><br><b> To this latter</b> number belonged the Writer himself, compare ch. ii. 3)<b> in</b> (see above) His Son (literally, or rather, nearer the strict sense of the original,<b> in Him who was Son of God</b>. We now pass off into a description of the dignity, and person, and work, of this Son of God: which description ends in asserting and proving Him to be higher than angels, the loftiest of created beings)<b> whom He constituted</b> (not,<i> “hath constituted,”</i> or<i> “appointed:”</i> referring, as also does<b> made</b>, which follows, to the time,<i> “in the beginning,”</i>—the date of the eternal counsel of God)<i> heir</i> ( “appropriately, after the mention of<i> Sonship</i>, comes<i> inheritance.”</i> Bengel.<b> That heir</b> is not equivalent to<i> “lord”</i> simply, is plain: the same expression could not have been used of the Father. It is in virtue of the Sonship of our Lord that the Father constituted Him heir of all things, before the worlds began. “In Him also,” says Delitzsch, “culminates the fulfilment of the promise given to the seed of Abraham, that he should be heir of the world.” See below. See for St. Paul’s use of the word and image, Gal. iv. 7)<b> of all things</b> ( “that is, of the whole world.” Chrysostom. And we cannot give this a more limited sense, nor restrict it to this world; especially as the subsequent portion of the chapter distinctly includes the angels in it. It is much disputed whether this heirship of Christ is to be conceived as belonging to Him essentially in his divine nature, or as accruing to Him from his work of redemption in the human nature. The Fathers, and the majority of the moderns, decide for the latter alternative. “The Lord Christ is the heir of all things,” says Theodoret, “not as God, but as man.” And so the Socinian and quasi-Socinian interpreters, arriving at the same view by another way, not believing the præ-existence of Christ. But it is plain that such an interpretation will not snit the requirements of the passage. For this humiliation of His, with its effects, first comes in at the end of ver. 3. All this, now adduced, is referable to his essential Being as Son of God; not merely in the Godhead before his Incarnation, but also in the Manhood after it, which no less formed a part of His “constitution” by the Father, thin His Godhead itself, So that the word<i> “constituted”</i> or<i> “appointed,”</i> as observed above, must be taken not as an appoint-ment in prospect of the Incarnation, but as an absolute appointment, coincident with the<i> “this day have I begotten Thee,”</i> belonging to the eternal Sonship of the Lord, though wrought out in full by his mediatorial work),<b> by whom</b> (by means of whom, as His acting Power and personal instrument: so Theophylact: “Since the Father is the cause of the Son, He is also of the things which were made by Him. The Father, who begat the Son their maker, seems to make them Himself”)<b> He also made</b> (<i>created</i>. The word brought into emphasis by<b> also</b> is not<i> the world</i>, but<b> made</b>. “He not only appointed the Son heir of all things, before the Creation; but He also<i> made</i> the worlds by Him.” Bengel)<b> the ages</b> (so literally; but the meaning of the term has been much disputed. ‘The main classes of interpreters are two. (1) Those who see in the word its ordinary meaning of<i> ‘an age of time:’</i> (2) those who do not recognize such meaning, but suppose it to have been merged in that of<i> “the world,”</i> or<i> “the worlds.”</i> To (1) belong the Greek Fathers; and. some: others. On the other hand, (2) is the view of the majority of Commentators. It is explained and defended at length by Bleek, none of whose examples however seem to me to be void of the same ambiguity which characterizes the expression here. The Jews, it appears, came at length to designate by their phrase, “the present age,” not only the present age, but all things in and belonging to it—and so of the “future age” likewise. He therefore would regard<b> the ages</b> as strictly parallel with<i> “all things”</i> above, and would in-terpret, ‘Whom He has constituted lord, possessor and ruler over all, over the whole world, even as by Him He has made all, the universe,’ And nearly so Delitzsch, Ebrard, and Lünemann: these two latter adding however somewhat, inasmuch as they take it of all this state of things constituted in time and space. And this last view I should be disposed to adopt, going however somewhat further still: for whereas Ebrard includes in the expression God’s revelation of Himself in a sphere whose conditions are Time and Space, and so would understand by it all things existing under these conditions, I would include in it also<i> these conditions themselves,</i>—which exist not independently of the Creator, but are His work—<i>His</i> appointed conditions of all created existence. So that the universe, as well in its great primæval conditions,—the reaches of Space, and the ages of Time, as in all material objects and all successive events, which furnish out and people Space and Time, God made by Christ. It will be plain that what has been here said will apply equally to ch. xi. 3, which is commonly quoted as decisive for the<i> material</i> sense here. Some have endeavoured to refer<i> the ages</i> (3) to the new or spiritual world, or the ages of the Messiah, or of the Christian Church: principally in the interests of Socinianism: or (4), to the various dispensations of God’s revelation of Himself: or even (5), as Fabricius, to the Gnostic sons, or emanations from the divine Essence, and so to the higher spiritual order of beings, the angels. Against all these, besides other considerations, ch. xi. 3 is a decisive testimony). It will be seen by consulting the note on John i. 1, how very near the teaching of Philo approached to this creation of the universe by the Son.
