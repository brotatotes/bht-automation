<b> 2.] at the end of these days</b> (in order to understand this expression, it will be well to call to mind certain Jewish modes of speaking of time. The Rabbis divided the whole of time into<i> “this age,”</i> and<i> “the age to come.”</i> The days of the Messiah were regarded as a period of transition from the former to the latter,—His appearance, as the ushering in of the termination of<i> “these days,”</i> the beginning of the end,—and His second coming in glory as the accomplishment of<i> “these days”</i> or<i> “this age.”</i> And with this, New Test. usage agrees,—see 1 Pet. i. 20; James v. 3; Jude 18; 2 Pet. iii. 3. Thus<b> at the end of these days</b> would mean, ‘at the end of<i> this age,’</i> in the technical sense of these words as signifying the whole world-period, the latter boundary of which is the Resurrection. And thus is the manifestation of Christ in the flesh ever spoken of, and especially in this Epistle; compare ch. ix. 26; and notes on ch. ii. 5; vi. 5. Stuart has mistaken the meaning, in rendering<i> ‘during the last dispensation,’</i> and making<i> “these”</i> to import that the period had already<i> begun</i>. It is not of a beginning, but of an<i> expiring</i> period, the Writer is speaking. The ancient expositors principally use these words as ground of<i> consolation:</i> those who were in conflict would be consoled on hearing that it was soon to end)<b> spake</b> (not<i> ‘hath spoken:’</i> the<b> end</b> just spoken of is looked back on as a definite point, at which the divine revelation took place. The attention of the readers is thus directed not so much to the present state in which they are, as to the act of God towards them)<b> unto us</b> (i. e. all who have heard that voice, or to whom it is to be announced. There is no distinction between those who received God’s revelation immediately from the Son, and those who received immediately through others.
