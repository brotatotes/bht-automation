But the intermediate participial clauses do not stand in the same relation to the main sentence. The first members,<i> ‘being, &c.,”</i> still set forth those attributes of the Son of God which are of a permanent character, and belonging to Him before the Incarnation: whereas the following member, the last participial clause, stands in nearer relation to the main sentence, expressing as it does the purification of mankind from sin, wrought by the incarnate Son of God, as one individual historical event,—as the antecedent of that exaltation of Him to the right hand of God, which the main sentence enounces.” Bleck.<br><br><b> Who</b> (this represents, it will be evident, rather the præ-existent than the incarnate Word. But it is perhaps a mistake to let this distinction be too prominent, and would lead to the idea of a change having taken place in the eternal relation of the Son to the Father, when He subjected himself to the conditions of space and time. Even then He could say of Himself, “The Son of Man which<i> is</i> in heaven”)<b> being</b> (see Phil. ii. 6, which is also said of His præ-existent and essential being)<b> the brightness</b> (<i> “reflexion,”</i> not<i> “effulgence.”</i> This latter would be legitimate, but does not seem to have been the ordinary usage. See Wisd. vii, 26, where wisdom is called “the brightness of the everlasting light.” And this (which, as Delitzsch remarks, is represented by the “light of light” of the Nicene Creed) seems to have been universally the sense among the ancients: no trace whatever being found of the meaning<i> ‘reflexion.’</i> Nor would the idea he apposite here: the Son of God is, in this his essential majesty, the expression, and the sole expression, of the divine Light,—not, as in his Incarnation, its reflexion)<b> of His glory</b> (not simply<i> His light</i>; nor need the expression be confined to such literal sense.

Hence—c) generally,<i> consistence</i> or<i> existence,</i>—A) it imports the<i> especial manner of being,</i>—the<i> peculiar essence</i> of an object. And this last seems to be the best meaning: in our place: His<i> essential being</i>, His<i> substance</i>. For in regarding the history of the word, we find that the well-known theological meaning<i> ‘person,’</i> was not by any means generally received during the first four centuries. The Nicene Council itself uses<i> “hypostasis”</i> and<i> “essence”</i> in the same sense, and condemns the deriving the Son from another hypostasis or essence from the Father: and so usually Athanasius. The fact was, that the Easterns most commonly used the term to designate the three separate Persons: whereas the Westerns continued to regard it as equivalent to<i> essence</i>, and assumed but one<i> hypostasis:</i> and the Western bishops, assembled with Athanasius at the council of Sardica in 347, distinctly pronounced the assumption of three<i> hypostases</i> heretical, i.e. Arian. Subsequently, however, to this, in the Synod assembled at Alexandria in 362, at which Athanasius, and bishops of Italy, Arabia, Egypt, and Libya were present, the Easterns and Westerns agreed, on examination of one another's meaning, to acknowledge one another as orthodox, and to allow indifferently of the use of<i> three hypostases,</i> signifying ‘Persons,’ and<i> one hypostasis,</i> signifying substance, essence. On all grounds it will be safer here to hold to the primitive meaning of the word, and not to introduce into the language of the apostolic age a terminology which was long subsequent to it),<b> and upholding</b> (bearing up. The Rabbinical writings speak of God as<i> carrying all the worlds by His strength</i>)<b> the universe</b> (the meaning attempted to be given by some Socinian expositors, “the whole kingdom of grace,” is wholly beside the purpose: see Col. i. 17; Job. viii. 3; Rev. iv. 11)<b> by the word</b> (<i>expressed command:</i> compare ch. xi. 3)<b> of his</b> (Whose? His own, or the Fathers? ‘The latter is held by Cyril of Alexandria. And so Grotius and others. But Chrysostom and the great body of Commentators understand<b> his</b> to refer to the Son. The strict parallelism of the clauses would seem to require, that<i> his</i> here should designate the same person, as it does before in this same verse. But such parallelism and consistency of reference of demonstrative pronouns is by no means observed in the New Test., e.g. Eph. i 20, 22, “And placed Him at His right hand (of the Father),.... and put all things under His feet” (of the Son). In every such ease the reference must be determined by the circumstances, and the things spoken of. And applying that test here, we find that in our former clause it is quite out of the question that<b> his</b> should be reflective, referring, as it clearly does, to another than the subject of the sentence. But when we proceed to our second clause, we find no such bar to the ordinary reflective sense of<b> his</b>, but every reason to adopt it as the most obvious. For we have here an action performed by the Son, who<i> upholds the universe.</i> Whereby?<b> By the word of His power:</b> where we may certainly say 1) that had another than the subject of the sentence been intended, such intention would have been expressed: and 2) that the assertion would be after all a strange and unexampled one, that the Son. upholds all things by the word of the Father's power, So that, on all accounts, this second<b> his</b> seems better to be referred to the Son)<b> power</b> (not to be weakened into the comparatively unmeaning “his powerful word.” His Power is an inherent attribute, whether uttered or not: the<b> word</b> is that utterance, which He has been pleased to give of it. It is a “powerful word,” but much more is here stated—that it is the word of, proceeding from, giving utterance to, His power),<b> having</b> (or,<b> when He had</b>)<b> made</b> (the vulgate,<i> “making,”</i> is an unfortunate mistranslation, tending to obscure the truth of the completion of the one Sacrifice of the Lord. The words<i> “by Himself”</i> can hardly be retained in the text, in the face of their omission in the most ancient MSS., joined to their internal character as an explanatory gloss. Meanwhile, the gloss is a good and true one. It was by<i> Himself,</i> in the fullest sense)<b> purification of sins</b> (as Bleck observes, there is no occasion to suppose the genitive here equivalent to<i> “from sins,”</i> seeing that we may say,<i> “the sins of a man are purified,”</i> as we read, Matt. viii. 3,<i> “his leprosy was cleansed.”</i> Sin was the great uncleanness, of which He has effected the purga- tion: the disease of which He has wrought the care. This<i> purification</i> must be understood by the subsequent argument in the Epistle: for that which the Writer had it in his mind to expand in the course of his treatise, he must be supposed to have meant when he used without explanation a concise term, like this. And that we know to have been, the purifications and sacrifices of the Levitical law, by which man’s natural uncleanness in God’s sight was typically removed, and access to God laid open to him. Ebrard’s note here is so important that, though long, I cannot forbear inserting it. “The term<b> purification</b> answers to the Hebrew, and its ideal explanation must be sought in the meaning which suits the Levitical cleansing in the Old Test. worship. Consequently, they are entirely wrong, who understand this<i> purification</i> of moral amelioration, and would so take the<i> ‘making purification’</i> in this place, as if the author wished to set forth Christ here as a moral teacher, who by precept and example incited men to amendment, And we pronounce those in error, who go so far indeed as to explain the<i> purification</i> of the propitiatory removal of the guilt of sin, but only on account of later passages in our Epistle, as if the idea of scriptural<i> purification</i> were not already sufficiently clear to establish this, the only true meaning. The whole law of purification, as given by God to Moses, rested on the assumption that our nature, as sinful and guilt-laden, is not capable of coming into immediate contact with our holy God and Judge. The mediation between man and God present in the most holy place, and in that most holy place separated from the people, was revealed in three forms; (<i>a</i>) in sacrifices, (<i>b</i>) in the Priesthood; and (<i>c</i>) in the Levitical laws of purity. Sacrifices were [typical] acts or means of propitiation for guilt; Priests were the agents for accomplishing these acts, but were not themselves accounted purer than the rest of the people, having consequently to bring offerings for their own sins before they offered for those of the people. Lastly, Levitical purity was the condition which was attained, positively by sacrifice and worship, negatively by avoidance of Levitical pollution,—the condition in which the people was enabled, by means of the priests, to come into relation with God ‘without dying’ [Deut. v. 26]; the result of the cultus which was past, and the postulate for that which was to come. So that that which purified, was sacrifice: and the purification was, the removal of guilt. This is most clearly seen in the ordinance concerning the great day of atonement, Lev. xvi. There we find those three leading features in the closest distinctive relation. First, the sacrifice must be prepared [vv. 1–10]: then, the High Priest is to offer for his own sins [vv. 11–14]: lastly, he is to kill the sin-offering for the people [ver. 15], and with its blood to sprinkle the mercy-seat and all the holy place, and cleanse it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel [ver. 19]; and then he is symbolically to lay the sins of the people on the head of a second victim, and send forth this animal, laden with the curse, into the wilderness. For [ver. 30] ‘on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.’ In the atonement, in the gracious<i> covering</i> of the guilt of sin, consists<i> purification</i> in the scriptural sense. [And so also were those who had become levitically unclean, e.g., lepers, Levit. xiv., cleansed by atoning sacrifices.] So that an Israelitish reader, a Christian Jew, would never, on reading the words<b> made purification</b>, think on what we commonly call ‘moral amelioration,’ which, if not springing out of the living ground of a heart reconciled to God, is mere self deceit, and only external avoidance of evident transgression: but the<b> purification</b> which Christ brought in would, in the sense of our author and his readers, only be understood of that gracious atonement for all guilt of sin of all mankind, which Christ our Lord and Saviour has completed for us by His sinless sufferings and death: and out of which flows forth to us, as from a fountain, all power to love in return, all love to Him, our heavenly Pattern, and all hatred of sin, which caused His death. To speak these words of Scripture with the mouth is easy: but he only can say Yea and Amen to them with the heart who, in simple truthfulness of the knowledge of himself, has looked down even to the darkest depths of his ruined state, natural to him, and intensified by innumerable sins of act,—and, despairing of all help in himself, reaches forth his hand after the good tidings of heavenly deliverance.” It is truly refreshing, in the midst of so much unbelief, and misapprehension of the sense of Scripture, in the German commentators, to meet with such a clear and full testimony to the truth and efficacy of the Lord’s great Sacrifice, And I am bound to that the other great Germans recognize this just as fully),<b> sat down on the right hand</b> (literally,<i> ‘in the right hand,’</i> viz.,<i> portion</i> or<i> side</i>. The expression comes doubtless originally from Ps. cx. 1, cited below. Bleek, in the course of a long and thorough discussion of its meaning as applied to our Lord, shews that it is never used of his priæ-existent coequality with the Father, but always with reference to His exaltation in his humanity after his course of suffering and triumph. It is ever connected, not with the idea of His equality with the Father and share in the majesty of the Godhead, but with His state of waiting, in the immediate presence of the Father, and thus highly exalted by Him, till the purposes of his mediatorial office are accomplished. This his lofty state is, however, not one of quiescence; for (Acts ii. 33) He shed down the gift of the Spirit,—and (Rom. viii. 34) He maketh intercession for us: and below (ch. viii. 1 ff.) He is, for all purposes belonging to that office, our High Priest in Heaven. This<i> “sitting at the right hand of God”</i> is described as lasting until all enemies shall have been subdued unto Him, i.e. until the end of this state of time, and his own second coming: after which, properly and strictly speaking, the state of exaltation described by these words shall come to an end, and that mysterious completion of the supreme glory of the Son of God shall take place, which St. Paul describes, 1 Cor. xv. 28)<b> of Majesty</b> (this word<b> majesty</b> is often found in the Septuagint, and principally as referring to the divine greatness)<b> on high</b> (<i>in high places,</i> i.e.<i> in heaven</i>. Compare Ps. xciii. 4, cxiii. 5; Isa. xxxii. 15, xxxiii. 5; Jer. xxv. 30. In the same sense we have<i> “in the highest,”</i> Luke ii. 14; xix. 38; Job xvi. 20; Ecclus. xxvi. 16; Matt. xxi. 9; Mark xi. 10, Ebrard says: “HEAVEN, in Holy Scripture, signifies never unbounded space, nor omnipresence, but always either the starry firmament, or, more usually, that sphere of the created world of space and time, where the union of God with the personal creature is not severed by sin,—where no Death reigns, where the glorification of the body is not a mere hope of the future. Into that sphere has the Firstling of risen and glorified manhood entered, as into a place, with visible glorified Body, visibly to return again from thence.” The omission of the article<i> “the”</i> here gives majesty and solemnity—its insertion would seem to hint at other<i> majesties</i> in the background),<b> having become</b> (distinct from<i> “being,”</i> ver. 3: that, importing His essential, this, His superinduced state. For we are are now, in the course of the enunciation,—which has advanced to the main subject of the argument, the proving of the superiority of the New Covenant,—treating of the post-incarnate majesty of the Son of God. HE WAS all that has been detailed in ver. 3: He made purification of sins, and sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high, and thus BECAME this which is now spoken of. This is denied by Chrysostom, but recognized by ‘Theodoret, in a form however not strictly exact: for he applied it<i> only to the Humanity</i> of our Lord. To this Bleck very properly objects, that the making this exaltation belong only to Christ’s human nature, and supposing Him to have while on earth possessed still the fulness of the majesty of his Godhead, is not according to the usage of our Writer, nor of the New Test. generally, and in fact induces something like a double personality in the Son of God. The Scriptures teach us that He who was with God before the creation, from love to men put on flesh, and took the form of a servant, not all the while having on Him the whole fulness of his divine nature and divine glory, but having really and actually emptied himself of this fulness and glory, so that there was not only a hiding, but an absolute<i> inanition,</i> a putting off, of it. Therefore His subsequent exaltation must be conceived of as belonging, not to his Humanity only, but to the entire undivided Person of Christ, now resuming the fulness and glory of the Godhead (John xvii. 5), and in addition to this having taken into the Godhead the Manhood, now glorified by his obedience, atonement, and victory. See Eph. i. 20–22; Phil. ii. 6–9; Acts ii. 36; 1 Pet. iii. 21, 22. The Son of God before his Incarnation was<i> over</i> Creation: but after his work in the flesh he had become also Head<i> of</i> Creation,<br><br> inasmuch as his glorified Body, in which He triumphs sitting at God’s right hand, is itself created, and is the sum and the centre of creation)<b> so much better than</b> (the usual word of general and indefinite comparison in our Epistle, whether of Christian with Jewish [ch. vii. 19, 22; viii. 6; ix. 23], heavenly with earthly [x. 34; xi. 16; xii. 24], eternal with temporal [xi. 35]: see also vi. 9; vii. 7; xi. 40. It is used only three times by St. Paul, and never [unless 1 Cor. xii. 31, in the received text, be counted] in this sense: but thirteen times in this Epistle)<b> the angels</b> (of God; the heavenly created beings; afterwards, ver. 14, called<i> “ministering spirits.”</i> All attempts to evade this plain meaning are futile; and proceed on ignorance of the argument of our Epistle, and of the Jewish theology. But<i> why</i> should the angels be here brought in? and why should the superiority of the Incarnate Son of God to them be so insisted on and elaborated? Bleek gives a very insufficient reason, when he says that the mention of God’s throne brought to the Writer’s mind the angels who are the attendants there. The reason, as Ebrard remarks, lies far deeper. The whole Old Test. dispensation is related to the New Test. dispensation, as the angels to the Son. In the former, mankind, and Israel also, stands separated from God by sin: and angels, divine messengers [as in the expression “the angel of the covenant”), stand as mediators between man and God. And of these there is, so to speak, a chain of two links: viz., Moses, and the angel of the Lord. The first link is a mere man, who is raised above his fellow-men by his calling, by his office, the commission given to him,—and brought nearer to God; but he is a sinner as they are, and is in reality no more a partaker of the divine nature than they are. The second link is the angelic form in which God revealed Himself to his people, coming down to their capacity, like to man, without being man. So that Godhead and Manhood approximated to one another: a man was com-missioned and enabled to hear God’s word: God appeared in a form in which men might see Him: but the two found no point of contact; no real union of the Godhead and the Manhood took place. Whereas in the Son, God and the Manhood not only approximated, but became personally one. God no longer accommodates Himself to the capacities of men in an angelophany or theophany, but has revealed the fulness of his divine nature in the man Jesus,—in that He, who was the<i> brightness</i> of his glory, became man. The argument of the Writer necessarily then leads him to shew how both Mediators, the angel of the Old Test. covenant, and Moses, found their higher unity in Christ. First, he shews this of the angel or angels [for it was not always one individual angelic being, but various] by whom the first covenant was given: then of Moses, ch. iii. iv. This first portion is divided into two: vv. 4–14, in which he shews that the Son, as the eternal Son of God, is higher than the angels [see the connexion of this with the main argument below]: then, after an exhortation [ii. 1–4] founded on this, tending also to impress on us the superior holiness of the New Test. revelation, the second part [ii. 5–18] in which he shews that in the Son, the manhood also is exalted above the angels),<b> in proportion as he hath inherited</b> (as his own: the word being perhaps chosen in reference to the Old Test. prophecies, which promised it to Him: see below. The<i> perfect</i> is important, as denoting something belonging to His present and abiding state, not an event wholly past, as<i> “sat down”</i> above, indicating the first “setting himself down,” though that word might also be used of a permanent state of session)<b> a more distinguished</b> (or,<b> more excellent</b>)<b> name</b> (to be taken in its proper sense, not understood to mean precedence or dignity as ver. 5 shews: whence also we get an easy answer to the enquiry,<i> what name</i> is intended: viz. that of<b> Son</b>, in the peculiar and individual sense of the citation there. ‘The angels themselves are called<i> “sons of God,”</i> Job i. 6; ii. 1; xxxviii. 7: Dan. iii. 25, and Gen. vi. 2 [see Jude 6 note, and Introd. to Jude,§v. 11]: but the argument here is that the title “SON OF GOD” is bestowed on him individually, in a sense in which it never was conferred upon an angel. See as a parallel, Phil. ii. 9 ff. It must be remembered, as Delitzsch beautifully remarks, that the fulness of glory of the peculiar name of the Son of God is unattainable by human speech or thought: it is, Rev. xix. 12,<i> “a name which none knoweth but Himself.”</i> And all the citations and appellations here are but fragmentary indications of portions of its glory; are but beams of light, which are united in it as in a central sun.<i> Since</i><i> when</i> has Christ in this sense inherited this name? The answer must not be hastily made, as by some Commentators, that the term<b> inherited</b> implies the glorification of the humanity of Christ to that Sonship which He before had in virtue of his Deity. Evidently so partial a reference cannot be considered as exhausting the sense of the Writer. Nor again can we say that it was at the time of His incarnation, though the words of the angel in Luke i. 35,<i> “That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God,”</i> seem to favour such a reference: for it was especially at His incarnation, that He was made<i> a little lower than the angels</i>, ch. ii. 9. Rather would the sense seem to be, that the especial name of SON, belonging to Him not by ascription nor adoption, but by His very Being itself, has been ever, and is now, His:<i> inherited</i> by Him, “in that He is the very Son of God,” as Chrysostom says: the Old Test. declarations being as it were portions of the instrument by which this inheritance is assured to Him, and by the citation of which it is proved. Observe that the<i> having become better than the angels</i> is not<i> identical with</i> the<i> inheriting,</i> but<i> in proportion to</i> it: the triumphant issue of his Mediation is consonant to the glorious Name, which is His by inheritance: but which, in the fulness of its present inconceivable glory [see above], has been put on and taken up by Him in the historical process of his mediatorial humiliation and triumph) than they.
