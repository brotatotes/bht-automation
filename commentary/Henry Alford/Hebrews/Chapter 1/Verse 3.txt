<b> 3.]</b> “The Son of God now becomes Himself the subject. The verb belonging to the relative<b> who</b> is not found till<i> ‘sat down’</i> at the end of the verse. But the intermediate participial clauses do not stand in the same relation to the main sentence. The first members,<i> ‘being, &c.,”</i> still set forth those attributes of the Son of God which are of a permanent character, and belonging to Him before the Incarnation: whereas the following member, the last participial clause, stands in nearer relation to the main sentence, expressing as it does the purification of mankind from sin, wrought by the incarnate Son of God, as one individual historical event,—as the antecedent of that exaltation of Him to the right hand of God, which the main sentence enounces.” Bleck.
