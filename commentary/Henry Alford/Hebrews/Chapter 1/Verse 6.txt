<b> 6.] But</b> (because a further proof, and a more decisive one as regards the angels, is about to be adduced)<b> when He again</b> (or,<i> “when again He?”</i> Does<b> again</b> introduce a new citation, or does it belong to the verb, and denote a new and second introduction? This latter view is taken by many, principally the ancient expositors, and lately by Tholuck, De Wette, Lünemann, and Delitzsch,—interpreting the ‘second introduction’ diversely: some, as His incarnation, contrasted with His everlasting generation, or His creating of the world, which they treat as His first introduction: others, as His resurrection, contrasted with His incarnation: others, to His second coming, as contrasted with His first. The other view supposes a transposition of the adverb<i> again,</i> which in the original stands between<i> when</i> and the verb. I have shewn in my Gr. Test. that such a transposition is without examples. In this Epistle, when<i> “again”</i> is joined to a verb, it always has the sense of<i> ‘a second time:’</i> e.g. ch. iv. 7; v. 12; vi. 1, 6. This being the ease, I must agree with those who join<b> again</b> with<b> hath introduced</b>. And of the meanings which they assign to the phrase<i> “bringing in again,”</i> I conceive the only allowable one to be, the second coming of our Lord to judgment. See more below) hath ( ‘shall have’ It appears from all usage that the<i> present</i> rendering,<i> “bringeth in,”</i> is quite inadmissible)<b> hath introduced</b> (in what sense? See some of the interpretations above. But even those who hold the transposition of the word<b> again</b> are not, agreed as to the<i> introduction</i> here referred to. Some hold one of the above-mentioned meanings, some another. I have discussed the meaning fully below, and gathered that the word can only refer to the great entering of the Messiah on His kingdom. At present, the usage of the verb here used must be considered. It is the accustomed word in the Pentateuch for the ‘introducing’ the children of Israel into the lund of promise, the putting them into possession of their promised inheritance: see also Ps. lxxviii. 54. We have it again in Neh. i. 9, of the second introduction, or restoration of Israel to the promised land. The prophets again use it of the ultimate restoration of Israel: compare Isa. xiv. 2; lvi. 7; Jer. iii. 14; Ezek. xxxiv. 13; xxxvi. 24; xxxvii. 21; Zech. viii. 8. This fact, connected with the circumstances to be noted below, makes it probable that the word here also has this solemn sense of ‘putting in possession of,’ as of an inheritance. The sense ordinarily given, of ‘bringing into the world,’ the act of the Father corresponding to the<i> “coming into the world”</i> [ch. x. 5] of the Son appears to be unexampled)<b> the firstborn</b> (only here is the Son of God so called absolutely. It is His title by præ-existence,<i> “the</i><b> firstborn</b><i> of all creation,”</i> Col. i. 15 [where see the word itself discussed]:—by prophecy, Ps, lxxxix. 27,<i> “I will make Him my</i><b> firstborn,</b><i> higher than the kings of the earth:”</i>—by birth, Luke ii. 7, see also Matt. i, 18–25:—by victory over death, Col. i. 18; Rev. i. 5:—and here, where He is absolutely<b> the Firstborn,</b> it will he reasonable to regard all these references as being accumulated—Him, who is<i> the Firstborn,</i>—of the universe, of the new manhood, of the risen dead. And thus the inducting Him in glory into His inheritance is clothed with even more solemnity. All angels, all men, are but the younger sons of God, compared to HIM, THE FIRSTBORN)<b> into the world</b> (not the same word as that so rendered, ch. x. 5: but signifying the ‘inhabited earth:’ and very frequently used by the Septuagint in prophetic passages, where the future judgments of God on mankind are spoken of. The usage would not indeed be decisive against referring the words to Christ’s entrance into the human nature, but is much more naturally satisfied by the other interpretation),<b> He</b> (i. e. God, the subject of ver. 5)<b> saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him</b> (there are two places from which these words might come; and the comparison of the two will be very instructive as to the connexion and citation of prophecy. 1) The words themselves, including the<b> and</b>, which has no independent meaning here, come from Deut. xxxii. 43, where they conclude the dying song of Moses with a triumphant description of the victory of God over His enemies, and the avenging of His people. It will cause the intelligent student of Scripture no surprise to find such words cited directly of Christ, into whose hand all judgment is committed: however such Commentators as Stuart and De Wette may reject the idea of the citation being from thence, because no trace of a Messianic reference is there found. One would have imagined that the words<i> “nor is</i><i> there any that shall pluck them out of my hand,”</i> occurring just before, ver. 39 [compare John x. 28], would have prevented such an assertion. But those who see not Christ every where in the Old Testament, see Him nowhere. The fact of the usual literal citation of the Septuagint by our Writer, decides the point as far as the place is concerned from which the words are immediately taken. But here a difficulty arises. The words in the Septuagint, Deut. xxxii. 43,<i> “Rejoice ye heavens, with Him, and let all the angels of God worship Him,”</i> do not exist in our present Hebrew text. It is hardly however probable, that they are an insertion of the Septuagint, found as they are [with one variation presently to be noticed] in nearly all the MSS. The translators probably found them in their Hebrew text, which, especially in the Pentateuch, appears to have been an older and purer recension than that which we now possess. 2) The other passage from which they might come is Ps. xcvi. 7, where however they do not occur verbatim, but we read, “worship Him, all ye angels of God.” This, especially the omission of the and, which clearly belongs to the citation, is against the supposition of their being taken from thence: but it does not therefore follow that the Psalm was not in the Sacred Writer’s mind, or does not apply to the same glorious period of Messiah's triumph in its ultimate reference. Indeed the similarity of the two expressions of triumph is remarkable).
