<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <strong> But</strong> ( <strong> δέ</strong> , because a further proof, and a more decisive one as regards the angels, is about to be adduced) <strong> when He again</strong> (or, ‘ <em> when again He</em> ’? Does <strong> πάλιν</strong> introduce a new citation, or does it belong to <strong> εἰσαγάγῃ</strong> , and denote a new and second introduction? This latter view is taken by many, principally the ancient expositors, Chrys., Thl., (not Thdrt. appy.,) Ambr [4] , Œc., Anselm, Thos. Aquin., &amp;c., and lately by Tholuck, De Wette, Lünemann, and Delitzsch, interpreting the ‘second introduction’ diversely: some, as His incarnation, contrasted with His everlasting generation, or His creating of the world, which they treat as His first introduction: so Primasius, al.: others (Wittich, Surenhus., Peirce, al.), as His resurrection, contrasted with His incarnation: others (Greg.-nyss. contra Eunom. ii. vol. ii. p. 504 ed. Migne, Corn.-a-lap., Camerar., Gerhard, Calmet, Estius, Mede, Tholuck, De Wette, Lünemann, Delitzsch, Hofmann, in his Schriftbeweis, i. p. 151, al.), to His second coming, as contrasted with His first. The other view supposes a transposition of the adverb πάλιν , = πάλιν δέ , ὅταν εἰσαγάγῃ . And this is taken by the Syr., Erasm., Luth., Calv., Beza, Cappellus, Schlichting, Grot., Hammond, Owen, Bengel, Wolf, Kuin., al. Bleek discusses the question, and adopts this meaning: Ebrard sets it down as certain, and congratulates himself on being “spared the fruitless trouble of deciding which are the two introductions.” But I think we shall find the matter not quite so clear, nor so easily to be dismissed. The two passages of Philo adduced by Bleek (after Carpzov) for the transposition of πάλιν , do not touch the present construction. They are, ὁ δὲ πάλιν ἀποδιδράσκων θεὸν .… φησιν , Leg. Alleg. iii. 9, vol. i. p. 93: and ἡ δὲ πάλιν θεὸν ἀποδοκιμάζουσα κ . τ . λ . ib. Now in both of these, as Lünemann has pointed out, the contrary suppositions have preceded: ὁ δὲ νοῦν τὸν ἴδιον ἀπολείπων … ὁ δὲ πάλιν ἀποδιδρ . κ . τ . λ .: ἡ μὲν γὰρ τὸν ἐπὶ μέρους , τὸν γεννητὸν κ . θνητὸν ἀπολιποῦσα .… ἡ δὲ πάλιν κ . τ . λ .: and consequently in both, πάλιν has the meaning of <em> e contra</em> , and necessarily stands after the subject of the sentence, as δέ would: and as we find it repeatedly in Plato, e. g. Gorg. § 83, νῦν δὲ πάλιν αὖθις (or αὐτὸς ) ταὐτὸν τοῦτο ἔπαθε : Laches, § 22, νῦν δ ʼ αὖ πάλιν φαμὲν κ . τ . λ .: Rep. x. § 11, ἐπειδὴ τοίνυν κεκριμέναι εἰσίν , ἐγὼ πάλιν ἀπαιτῶ κ . τ . λ . Now manifestly no such meaning can here have place (notwithstanding that Storr and Wahl so give it): nor can I find any analogous instance in prose of a transposition of πάλιν in its ordinary sense. In this Epistle, when it is joined to a verb, it always has the sense of ‘ <em> a second time</em> :’ e. g. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:7">Hebrews 4:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:1">Hebrews 6:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6">Hebrews 6:6</span> . This being the case, I must agree with those who join πάλιν with εἰσαγάγῃ . And of the meanings which they assign to the phrase πάλιν εἰσαγ ., I conceive the only allowable one to be, the second coming of our Lord to judgment. See more below) <strong> hath</strong> (‘shall have:’ this rendering, the ‘futurus exactus,’ is required by grammar: cf. the same verb in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:5">Exodus 13:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:11">Exodus 13:11</span> , καὶ ἔσται ἡνίκα ἐὰν ( ὡς ἂν ) εἰσαγάγῃ σε κύριος ὁ θεός σου εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν Χαναναίων κ . τ . λ .: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:10">Luke 17:10</span> , ὃταν ποιήσητε πάντα … λέγετε , “when ye shall have done,” &amp;c.: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:40">Matthew 21:40</span> , ὅταν ἔλθῃ ὁ κύριος …, τί ποιήσει ; See numerous other instances cited in Winer, § 42.5. It would certainly appear from all usage that the <em> present</em> rendering is quite inadmissible) <strong> introduced</strong> (in what sense? See some of the interpretations above. But even those who hold the trajection of πάλιν are not agreed as to the introduction here referred to. Some hold one of the above-mentioned meanings, some another. I have discussed the meaning fully below, and gathered that the word can only refer to the great entering of the Messiah on His kingdom. At present, the usage of εἰσάγειν must be considered. It is the ‘verbum solenne’ for the ‘introducing’ the children of Israel into the land of promise, the putting them into possession of their promised inheritance: see Exod. above, and indeed Exod., Levit., Num., Deut., passim: also Ps. 77:54. It is sometimes used <em> absolutely</em> in this sense: e. g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:23">Exodus 23:23</span> , εἰσάξει σε πρὸς τὸν Αμοῤῥαῖον κ . Χετταῖον κ . τ . λ . We have it again in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ne+1:9">Nehemiah 1:9</span> , of the second introduction, or restoration of Israel to the promised land. The Prophets again use it of the ultimate restoration of Israel: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:2">Isaiah 14:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:7">Isaiah 56:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:14">Jeremiah 3:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:13">Ezekiel 34:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:24">Ezekiel 36:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:21">Ezekiel 37:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+8:8">Zechariah 8:8</span> . This fact, connected with the circumstances to be noted below, makes it probable that the word here also has this solemn sense of ‘putting in possession of,’ as of an inheritance. The sense ordinarily given, of ‘bringing into the world,’ the act of the Father corresponding to the εἰσέρχεσθαι εἰς τὸν κόσμον (ch. Heb 10:5 ) of the Son, appears to be unexampled. Estius remarks, “Juxta hunc sensum (that given above) magis apparet ἐνέργεια vocis ‘ <em> introducere</em> :’ quatenus ea significatur id quod jurisperiti vocant <em> inducere</em> seu <em> mittere in possessionem</em> ”) <strong> the firstborn</strong> (only here is the Son of God so called absolutely. It is His title by præ-existence, πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span> (where see the word itself discussed): by prophecy, Ps. 88:27, πρωτότοκον θήσομαι αὐτόν , ὑψηλὸν παρὰ τοῖς βασιλεῦσι τῆς γῆς : by birth, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:7">Luke 2:7</span> , see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18-25">Matthew 1:18-25</span> : by victory over death, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span> , πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span> : and here, where he is absolutely ὁ πρωτότοκος , it will be reasonable to regard all these references as being accumulated Him, who is <em> the Firstborn</em> , of the universe, of the new manhood, of the risen dead. And thus the inducting Him in glory into His inheritance is clothed with even more solemnity. All angels, all men, are but the younger sons of God, compared to HIM, THE FIRSTBORN) <strong> into the earth</strong> (not = κόσμον , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span> ; the ‘inhabited earth:’ and very frequently used by the LXX in prophetic passages, where the future judgments of God on mankind are spoken of. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+9:8">Psalms 9:8</span> ; 95:13: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:23">Isaiah 10:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:5">Isaiah 13:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+13:9">Isaiah 13:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:26">Isaiah 14:26</span> ; Isa 24:1 al. fr., and see below on the citation. The usage would not indeed be decisive against referring the words to Christ’s entrance into the human nature, but is much more naturally satisfied by the other interpretation), <strong> He</strong> (i. e. God, the subject of Heb 1:5 ) <strong> saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him</strong> (there are two places from which these words might come; and the comparison of the two will be very instructive as to the connexion and citation of prophecy. 1. The words themselves, including the <strong> καί</strong> , which has no independent meaning here; come from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+32:43">Deuteronomy 32:43</span> , where they conclude the dying song of Moses with a triumphant description of the victory of God over His enemies, and the avenging of His people. It will cause the intelligent student of Scripture no surprise to find such words cited directly of Christ, into whose hand all judgment is committed: however such Commentators as Stuart and De Wette may reject the idea of the citation being from thence, because no trace of a Messianic reference is there found. One would have imagined that the words οὔτε ἔστιν ὃς ἐξελεῖται ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν μου , occurring just before, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+32:39">Deuteronomy 32:39</span> (cf. Joh 10:28 ), would have prevented such an assertion. But those who see not Christ every where in the Old Testament, see Him no where. The fact of the usual literal citation of the LXX by our Writer, decides the point as far as the place is concerned from which the words are immediately taken. But here a difficulty arises. The words in the LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+32:43">Deuteronomy 32:43</span> , εὐφράνθητε οὐρανοὶ ἅμα αὐτῷ , καὶ προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες ἄγγελοι θεοῦ , do not exist in our present Hebrew text. It is hardly however probable, that they are an insertion of the LXX, found as they are (with one variation presently to be noticed) in nearly all the MSS. The translators probably found them in their Heb. text, which, especially in the Pentateuch, appears to have been an older and purer recension than that which we now possess. It is true that [5] [6] have here υἱοὶ θεοῦ , and in the third clause of the verse ἄγγελοι θεοῦ : while the Ed-vat. reads as here. But our Writer cites from the Alexandrine text: and it has been noticed that the Alexandrine MS. itself in a second copy of this song, subjoined to the Psalter, reads ἄγγελοι , only prefixing to it οἱ . And Justin Martyr, Dial. 130, p. 222, quotes the words as here. 2. The other passage from which they might come is <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+96:7">Psalms 96:7</span> , where however they do not occur verbatim, but we read προσκυνήσατε αὐτῷ πάντες ἄγγελοι αὐτοῦ . This, especially the omission of the καί , which clearly belongs to the citation, is against the supposition of their being taken from thence: but it does not therefore follow that the Psalm was not in the sacred Writer’s mind, or does not apply to the same glorious period of Messiah’s triumph in its ultimate reference. Indeed the similarity of the two expressions of triumph is remarkable, and the words in the Psalm must be treated as a reference to those in Deut. at least in the LXX rendering, for the Heb. seems rather (as Delitzsch in loc.) to regard the gods of the heathen nations (“Worship Him, all ye gods”). As a corroboration of the view, that the Psalm was in the Writer’s mind, it may be mentioned, that in introducing the description of the divine Majesty in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span> , we read ἔφαναν αἱ ἀστραπαὶ αὐτοῦ τῇ οἰκουμένῃ . Ebrard denies the reference to the Psalm, but has some valuable remarks on the Messianic import of the passage in Deut. See also the whole subject and context of it set forth in Delitzsch.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [5] The MS. referred to by this symbol is that commonly called the Alexandrine, or CODEX ALEXANDRINUS. It once belonged to Cyrillus Lucaris, patriarch of Alexandria and then of Constantinople, who in the year 1628 presented it to our King Charles I. It is now in the British Museum. It is on parchment in four volumes, of which three contain the Old, and one the New Testament, with the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians. This fourth volume is exhibited open in a glass case. It will be seen by the letters in the inner margin of this edition, that the first 24 chapters of Matthew are wanting in it, its first leaf commencing ὁ νυμφίος , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span> : as also the leaves containing ἵνα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:50">John 6:50</span> , to καὶ σύ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:52">John 8:52</span> . It is generally agreed that it was written at Alexandria; it does not, however, <em> in the Gospels</em> , represent that commonly known as the Alexandrine text, but approaches much more nearly to the Constantinopolitan, or generally received text. The New Testament, according to its text, was edited, in uncial types cast to imitate those of the MS., by Woide, London, 1786, the Old Testament by Baber, London, 1819: and its N.T. text has now been edited in common type by Mr. B. H. Cowper, London, 1861. The date of this MS. has been variously assigned, but it is now pretty generally agreed to be the <em> fifth century</em> .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [6] The CODEX VATICANUS, No. 1209 in the Vatican Library at Rome; and proved, by the old catalogues, to have been there from the foundation of the library in the 16th century. It was apparently, from internal evidence, copied in Egypt. It is on vellum, and contains the Old and New Testaments. In the latter, it is deficient from Heb 9:14 to the end of the Epistle; it does not contain the Epistles to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon; nor the Apocalypse. An edition of this celebrated codex, undertaken as long ago as 1828 by Cardinal Angelo Mai, has since his death been published at Rome. The defects of this edition are such, that it can hardly be ranked higher in usefulness than a tolerably complete collation, entirely untrustworthy in those places where it differs from former collations in representing the MS. as <em> agreeing with</em> the received text. An 8vo edition of the N.T. portion, newly revised by Vercellone, was published at Rome in 1859 (referred to as ‘Verc’): and of course superseded the English reprint of the 1st edition. Even in this 2nd edition there were imperfections which rendered it necessary to have recourse to the MS. itself, and to the partial collations made in former times. These are (1) that of Bartolocci (under the name of Giulio de St. Anastasia), once librarian at the Vatican, made in 1669, and preserved in manuscript in the Imperial Library (MSS. Gr. Suppl. 53) at Paris (referred to as ‘Blc’); (2) that of Birch (‘Bch’), published in various readings to the Acts and Epistles, Copenhagen, 1798, Apocalypse, 1800, Gospels, 1801; (3) that made for the great Bentley (‘Btly’), by the Abbate Mico, published in Ford’s Appendix to Woide’s edition of the Codex Alexandrinus, 1799 (it was made on the margin of a copy of Cephalæus’ Greek Testament, Argentorati, 1524, still amongst Bentley’s books in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge); (4) notes of alterations by the original scribe and other correctors. These notes were procured for Bentley by the Abbé de Stosch, and were till lately supposed to be lost. They were made by the Abbate Rulotta (‘Rl’), and are preserved amongst Bentley’s papers in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge (B. 17. 20) 1 . The Codex has been occasionally consulted for the verification of certain readings by Tregelles, Tischendorf, and others. A list of readings examined at Rome by the present editor (Feb. 1861), and by the Rev. E. C. Cure, Fellow of Merton College, Oxford (April 1862), will be found at the end of these prolegomena. A description, with an engraving from a photograph of a portion of a page, is given in Burgon’s “Letters from Rome,” London 1861. This most important MS. was probably written in the <em> fourth century</em> (Hug, Tischendorf, al.).
