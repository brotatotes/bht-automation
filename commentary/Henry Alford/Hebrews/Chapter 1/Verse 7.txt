<b> 7.] And</b> (with reference)<b> indeed to the angels He</b> (God)<b> saith, Who maketh his angels winds</b> (see below),<b> and his ministers a flame of fire</b> (the citation is after the Septuagint according to the Alexandrine MS., which indeed commonly agrees with the citations in this Epistle. And as the words stand in the Greek, the arrangement and rendering of them is unquestionably as above. But here comes in no small difficulty as to the sense of the original Hebrew. It is usually contended that its words can only mean, from the context, “who maketh the winds his messengers, and flames of fire his servants.” But I have maintained in my Greek Test. that the sense is, “who maketh his messengers winds, his servants flames of fire,” whatever these words may be intended to import. And this latter enquiry will I imagine be not very difficult to answer. He makes his messengers winds, i.e. He causes his messengers to act in or by means of the winds; his servants flames of fire, i.e. commissions them to assume the agency or form of flames for His purposes. Tt seems to me that this, the plain sense of the Hebrew as it stands, is quite as agreeable to the context as the other. And thus the Rabbis took it. The only accommodation of the original passage made by the Writer, is the very slight one of applying the general terms “His messengers” and “His servants” to the angels, which indeed can be their only meaning. The sense of the words I have endeavoured to give in some measure above. It is evident that the word represented in the A.V. by<i> spirits,</i> must be rendered<b> winds,</b> not<i> ‘spirits:’</i> from both the context in the Psalm and the correspondence of the two clauses, and also from the nature of the subject. “They all<i> are</i> spirits,” as asserted below, ver. 14: therefore it could not with any meaning be said, that He<i> maketh them</i> spirits).<b> But unto the Son,—Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: and the rod</b> (i. e. sceptre: see especially Esth. iv. 11; Amos i. 5, where the same Hebrew word occurs)<b> of thy kingdom is the rod of straightness</b> (i. e. righteousness, justice).<b> Thou lovedst</b> (the Writer refers the words to the whole life of our Lord on earth, as a past period)<b> righteousness, and hatedst iniquity; for this cause</b> (because of His love of righteousness and hatred of iniquity, shewn by his blameless life and perfect obedience on earth)<b> God</b> (some render this first,<i> “O God,”</i> but apparently without necessity),<b> thy God, anointed thee</b> (<i>how?</i> and<i> when?</i> We must distinguish this anointing from what is said in Acts x. 38,<i> “God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit, and with power,”</i> and the<i> anointing</i> of Isa. lxi. 1. For it is a consequent upon the righteous course of the Son of God in his Humanity, and therefore belongs to his triumph, in which He is exalted above his fellows [see below]. Again, the<i> “oil of gladness”</i> below seems rather to point to a festive and triumphant, than to an inaugurative unction. We should therefore rather take the allusion to be, as in Ps. xxiii. 5; xcii. 10, to the custom of anointing guests at feasts: so that, as the King in the Psalm is anointed with the oil of rejoicing above his fellows, because of his having loved righteousness and hated iniquity, so Christ, in the jubilant celebration of His finished course at his exaltation in heaven, is anointed with the festive oil<i> above His fellows</i> [see below]. There is of course an allusion also in the word<b> anointed</b> (echrīsen) to the honoured and triumphant. Name<i> Christ</i>)<b> with oil of rejoicing</b> (see above: oil indicative of joy, as it is of superabundance: compare Isa. lxi. 3)<b> beyond thy fellows</b> (i. e. in the Psalm, ‘other kings:’ hardly ‘brothers by kin’ [other sons of David], as Grotius and others. But to whom does the Writer apply the words? Chrysostom says, “Who are the<i> fellows,</i> except<i> men?</i> And the meaning is, Christ received not the Holy Spirit by measure.” Theodoret on the Psalm, Calvin, Beza, and others, think of believers, the adopted into God’s family: others, of the High Priests, prophets, and kings, in the Old Test., anointed as types of Christ: others, of<i> all creatures:</i> others, as in the Psalm, of<i> other kings.</i> Camero says, “Christ had in His office no fellows; in His human nature, all men; in grace, all the faithful.” Still we may answer to all these, that they do not in any way satisfy the requirements of the context. Were it the intent of the Writer to shew Christ’s superiority over his human brethren of<i> every kind,</i> we might accept one or other of these meanings: but as this is not his design, but to shew His superiority to the angels, we must I think take the word<b> fellows</b> as representing other heavenly beings, partakers in the same glorious and sinless state with Himself, though not in the strict sense, His “fellows.” De Wette objects to this sense, that the Writer places the angels far beneath Christ: Delitzsch, that the angels are not<i> anointed,</i> whereas there is no necessity in the text for understanding that these<i> fellows</i> are also anointed: the comparison may consist in the very fact of the anointing itself:—and Ebrard, speaking as usual strongly, says that “neither the Psalmist, nor our author if in his senses, could have applied the word to the angels.” But this need not frighten us: and we may well answer with Lünemann, 1) “that the general comparison here being that of Christ with the angels, the fresh introduction of this point of comparison in ver. 9 cannot of itself appear inappropriate. 2) Granted, that just before, in ver. 7, the angels are placed far beneath Christ,—we have this very inferiority here marked distinctly by the terms of this comparison. 3) The angels are<i> next</i> to Christ in rank, by the whole course of this argument: to whom then would the Writer more naturally apply the term<i> fellows,</i> than to them?” I may add, 4) that the comparison here is but analogous to that in ver. 4, of which indeed it is an expansion: and 5) that thus only can the figure of anointing at a triumphant festival be carried out consistently: that triumph having taken place on the exaltation of the Redeemer to the Father’s right hand and throne [ver. 8], when, the whole of the heavenly company, His<i> fellows</i> in glory and joy, being anointed with the oil of gladness, His share and dignity was so much greater than theirs. It remains that we should consider the general import, and application here, of Ps. xlv. From what is elsewhere found in this commentary, it will not be for a moment supposed that I can give in to the view of such writers as De Wette and Hupfeld, who maintain that it was simply an ode to some king, uncertain whom, and has no further reference whatever. Granting that in its first meaning it was addressed to Solomon (for to him the circumstances introduced seem best to apply, e.g. the palace of ivory, ver. 9, compare 1 Kings x. 18: the gold from Ophir, ver. 10, compare 1 Kings ix. 28: the daughter of Tyre with her gift, ver. 18, compare 2 Chron. ii. 3–16),—or even, with Delitzsch, to Joram, on his marriage with the Tyrian Athaliah,—we must yet apply to it that manifest principle, without which every Hebrew ode is both unintelligible and preposterous, that the theocratic idea filled the mind of the Writer and prompted his pen: and that the Spirit of God used him as the means of testifying to that King, who stood veritably at the head of the theocracy in the divine counsels. Thus considered, such applications as this lose all their difficulty; and we cease to feel ourselves obliged in every case to enquire to whom and on what occasion the Psalm was probably first addressed. And even descending to the low and mere rationalistic ground taken by De Wette and Hupfeld, we are at least safer than they are, holding as we do a meaning in which both Jews and Christians have so long concurred, as against the infinite diversity of occasion and reference which divides their opinions of the Psalm).
