<b> 1.] For</b> (connects with the whole passage, ch. ix. 24–28: hitherto has been shewn the impossibility of Christ’s offering being repeated as were those of the law: now is to be shewn its absolute perfection as compared with those of the law)<b> the law having</b> (as it has; the participle has a reasoning force, which passes on upon what follows)<b> a shadow</b> (or, ‘the shadow,” which in sense would be much the same. The putting forward of the word to the beginning of the sentence would render it anarthrous. I prefer, however, ‘a shadow,” because of the meaning of the word, presently to be treated of: see below)<b> of the good things to come</b> (viz. the same good things of which, in ch. ix. 11, Christ is said to be the High Priest,—which belong to the<i> “age to come”</i> of ch. vi. 5, whose<i> powers</i> are working in the present. dispensation,—and to the<i> completion</i> of the<i> “world to come”</i> of ch. ii. 5: the good things which are still future to us as they were to those under the law, but are now made sure to us in and by Christ),<b> not the very image of the things</b> (every representation of<i> good things to come</i> must be an<i> image</i>, whether it be in words, or in types, or in any other method of representation. The full description and entire revelation of the things thus designated will be<i> “the very image”</i> of the things: which we possess in the gospel covenant: the very setting forth and form of the heavenly realities themselves. But the law had no such<i> “image”</i> constructed out of the heavenly realities themselves: it had merely a<i> shadow</i>, merely a rough sketch or outline),<b> year by year with the same sacrifices</b> (in the A.V. the words<b> year by year</b> are placed in the next clause. But there is no need to disturb the plain order of the sentence, in which<b> year by year</b> belongs to the verb,<i> “can never.”</i> “This,” says Delitzsch, “is more accordant with the sense of the Writer: for he does not say, that the law by means of the offerings which were always the same year by year never was able to perfect, &c.,—but that the law, year by year, by the repetition of the same offerings, testified its inability to perfect, &c., viz. on the day of atonement, on which the same expiatory offerings were always repeated, being necessary, notwithstanding the many offerings brought throughout the year, and after which the same round of offerings again began anew.” It will be evident that the words<b> with the same sacrifices</b> must refer, not to the daily offerings, but to those of propitiation on the great day of atonement)<b> which they</b> (the ministering priests)<b> offer continually</b> (the offering of these sacrifices is looked upon as continuous, being unbroken from year to year. When I say, “the celebration of the day of atonement continued unbroken till the destruction of Jerusalem,” I use the same method of expression)<b> never</b> (not even at any time)<b> is able to perfect</b> (see on ch. ii. 10, where I have entered into the meanings of this verb,<b> to perfect</b>, in our Epistle)<b> those who draw near</b> (to God, by means of them).
