See the matter discussed in my Greek Test. It will there be seen that I incline to join them with what follows, but would leave it an open question. My ground is that the words seem<br><br> better to refer to an enduring state, than to a past act. The objection taken to this arrangement, above, that there will be change in the nature of a session at the end, when all things shall have been put under His feet, may be met by saying that such change, being obviously included in His ultimate state of reception into God’s presence in heaven, does not here<i> count as</i> a change, where the question is of renewal of sacrifice, with regard to which that session is eternal)<b> sat down on the right hand of God; henceforth waiting until his enemies be placed as footstool of his feet</b> (there is no real discrepancy between this passage and 1 Cor. xv. 23–26. If this seems to date the subjection of all to Christ<i> before</i> the second advent, and that places it<i> after</i> the same event, we may well say, that the second advent is not here taken into account by the Writer,—whose object is the contrast between the suffering and triumphant Christ,—as it is by St. Paul, who is specially giving an account of the resurrection, which is so inseparably bound up with that<i> advent.</i> The second advent is no break in Christ’s waiting till his enemies be subdued to him, but it is the last step but one of that subjection; the last of all being the subjection of Himself, and his mystical Body with him, to Him that did put all things under him. For among the enemies are His own elect, who<i> were</i> enemies: and they are not thoroughly subject to Him, till He with them is subject to the Father, the mediatorial veil being withdrawn, and the One God being all in all).
