 18 .]  But (or, ‘now:’ it is the ‘but’ of the demonstration, referring to a well-known axiomatic fact as contrasting with the contrary hypothesis)  where there is remission of these, there is no longer offering concerning sin .
	“Here ends the finale ( Heb 10:1-18 ) of the great tripartite arrangement (Hebrews 7:1-25 ; Heb 7:26 to Hebrews 9:12 ; Heb 9:13 to Heb 10:18 ) of the middle portion of the Epistle. ‘Christ a High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek,’ this was its great theme, now brought to a conclusion. That the Priesthood of Christ, as Melchisedekite, is as high above the Levitical as God’s heaven is above the earth, that Christ, with His One High-priestly self-sacrifice, has accomplished that which the Levitical priesthood with its sacrifices was unable to accomplish, that henceforth, both our present possession of salvation, and our future completion of salvation, are as certain to us as that He is with God, ruling as a priest and reigning as a king, once more to appear, no more as a bearer of our sins, but in glory as a Judge; these are the three great fundamental thoughts, now brought to their full development. What it is, to be a High Priest after the order of Melchisedek and not of Aaron, is set forth, ch. Hebrews 7:1-25 . That Christ however as High Priest is Aaron’s antitype, ruling in the true holy place by virtue of His self-sacrifice here on earth, and Mediator of a better covenant, whose essential character the old covenant only shadowed forth and typified, we learn, Heb 7:26 to Hebrews 9:12 . And that the self-sacrifice of Christ, offered through the eternal Spirit, is of everlasting power, as contrasted with the unavailing cycle of legal offerings, is established in the third part, Heb 9:13 to Hebrews 10:18 ; the second half of this portion, Hebrews 10:1-18 , being devoted to a reiterated and conclusive treatment of the main position of the whole, the High-priesthood of Christ, grounded on His offering of Himself, its Kingly character, its eternal accomplishment of its end, confirmed by Psalms 40:0 , Psalms 110:0 , Jeremiah 31:0 ” Delitzsch.
