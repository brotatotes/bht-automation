<b> 18.] But</b> (or,<i> now:</i> it is the<i> ‘but’</i> of the demonstration, referring to a well-known axiomatic fact as contrasting with the contrary hypothesis)<b> where there is remission of these, there is no longer offering concerning sin.</b> “Here ends the finale (x. 1–18) of the great tripartite arrangement (vii. 1–25, vii. 26—ix. 12, ix. 13–x. 18) of the middle portion of the Epistle. ‘Christ a High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec,’ this was its great theme, now brought to a conclusion. That the Priesthood of Christ, as Melchisedecite, is as high above the Levitical as God’s heaven is above the earth,—that Christ, with His One High-priestly self-sacrifice, has accomplished that which the Levitical priesthood with its sacrifices was unable to accomplish,—that henceforth, both our present possession of salvation, and our future completion of salvation, are as certain to us as that He is with God, ruling as a Priest and reigning as a King, once more to appear, no more as a bearer of our sins, but in glory as a Judge;—these are the three great fundamental thoughts, now brought to their full development. What it is, to be a high priest after the order of Melchisedec and not of Aaron, is set forth, ch. vii. 1–25 That Christ however us High Priest is Aaron's antitype, ruling in the true holy place by virtue of His self-sacrifice here on earth,—and Mediator of a better covenant, whose essential character the old covenant only shadowed forth and typified, we learn, vii. 26–ix. 12. And that the self-sacrifice of Christ, offered through the eternal Spirit, is of everlasting power, as contrasted with the unavailing cycle of legal offerings, is established in the third part, ix. 13–x. 18: the second half of this portion, x. 1–18, being devoted to a reiterated and conclusive treatment of the main position of the whole,—the High Priesthood of Christ, grounded on His offering of Himself,—its Kingly character, its eternal accomplishment of its end, confirmed by Ps. xl. Ps. cx.; Jer. xxxi.” Delitzsch.<b> CHAP. X. 19—XIII.]</b> THE THIRD GREAT DIVISION OF THE EPISTLE: OUR DUTY IN THE INTERVAL OF WAITING BETWEEN THE BEGINNING AND ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR SALVATION. And herein, x. 19–39, exhortation to enter boldly into the holiest place, 19–22: to hold fast our profession, 23: to stir up one another, 24, 25: in consideration of the fearful punishment which awaits the rejectors of Christ, 26–31: and in remembrance of the previous sufferings which they underwent when first converted, 32–34. Finally, exhortation not to cast away confidence, for the time until His coming is short, and during that time, faith is the life of the soul.<br><br> There has been no<i> exhortation</i>, properly speaking, since ch. vii. 1, i.e. during the great doctrinal argument of the Epistle. Before that, argument and exhortation were rapidly alternated. But so exquisite is the skill of arrangement and development, that the very exhortation with which he closed the former portion of the Epistle, where first he began to prepare the way for his great argument, ch. iv. 14–16, is now resumed, deepened indeed and expanded by the intervening demonstration, but in spirit and substance the same:<i> “let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith”</i> here, answering to<i> “let us approach with boldness to the throne of grace”</i> there, and<i> “let us hold fast the confession of our hope”</i> here, to<i> “let us hold fast our confession”</i> there.
