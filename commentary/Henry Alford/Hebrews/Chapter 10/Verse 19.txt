 19 .]  Having ( ἔχοντες is placed first as carrying the emphasis: ‘possessing, as we do …’)  therefore (as above proved: οὖν collects and infers),  brethren (see on ch. Heb 3:1 ),  confidence (see on ch. Heb 3:6  παῤῥησία here as well as there is not justification, right ( ἐξουσίαν Hesych.) to enter, but purely subjective,  confidence , boldness)  as regards the (our, see below)  entering into the holy places (for construction, see reff. καὶ γὰρ ἐπειδὴ ἀφέθησαν ἡμῖν τὰ ἁμαρτήματα , παῤῥησίαν ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸ εἰσέρχεσθαι εἰς τὰ ἅγια , τουτέστιν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν . Thl.  ἡ εἴσοδος is  our entering, not  Christ’s entering, as Heinrichs and Dindorf: see ch. Hebrews 4:16 , προσερχώμεθα μετὰ παῤῥησίας τῷ θρόνῳ τῆς χάριτος )  in the blood of Jesus (the ἐν introduces that wherein the confidence is grounded: cf. ref., ἐν ᾧ ἔχομεν τὴν παῤῥησίαν καὶ [ τὴν ] προσαγωγήν . He having once entered in with His blood as our High Priest, and thereby all atonement and propitiation having been for ever accomplished, it is in that blood that our boldness to enter in is grounded. To understand ἐν , with Bleek and Stier, as in ch. Hebrews 9:25 , εἰσέρχεται εἰς τὰ ἅγια … ἐν αἵματι ἀλλοτρίῳ , is in fact to make us, as priests, renew Christ’s offering of Himself. “We enter,” says Stier, “with the blood of Jesus, even with the same, wherewith He entered before us:” which is very like a contradiction in terms, and is at all events inaccurate theology. We do not take the blood of Christ with us into the presence of God: it is there already once for all, and our confidence of access is therein grounded, that it  is there. See note on ch. Heb 12:24 ),
