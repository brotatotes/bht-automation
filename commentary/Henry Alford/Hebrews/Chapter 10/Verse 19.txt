We do not take the blood of Christ with us into the presence of God: it is there already once for all, and our confidence of access is therein grounded, that it<i> is</i> there.

It is hardly probable, to begin with, that our Writer should in two places describe Christ as set<i> over the house of God</i>, in meanings entirely different from each other, clearly, the heavenly sanctuary is regarded by him as also including the earthly, the church above as the home of the church below: see ch. xii. 22 ff.);
