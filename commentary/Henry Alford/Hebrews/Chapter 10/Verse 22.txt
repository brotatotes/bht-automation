<b> 22.] let us approach</b> (<i>draw near to God</i>. So that the clauses which follow are best regarded as both belonging to this<i> approach</i>, since they also describe requisite preparations for worship: see this further treated below, on ver. 23)<b> with a true heart</b> (<i>without hypocrisy</i>, Chrysostom. So Hezekiah pleads, Isa. xxxviii. 3, “I have walked before thee in truth with a perfect (Septuagint, ‘true’) heart”)<b> in fall assurance</b> (ch. vi. 11: see note there)<b> of faith</b> (with no doubt as to the certainty of our access to God by the blood of Jesus),<b> having our hearts sprinkled from</b> (meaning, “sprinkled, and by that sprinkling cleansed from”)<b> an evil conscience</b> (a conscience polluted with the guilt of sin: for “if a man’s practice be bad, his conscience, in so far it is the consciousness of that practice, is<i> evil</i>”),<b> and having our body washed with pure water</b> (both these clauses refer to the legal purifications of the Levitical priests, which took place by means of blood and water. At their first dedication, Aaron and his sons were sprinkled with blood, their bodies and their clothes, Exod. xxxi. 21; Lev. viii. 30). And so are we to be as God’s priests, having access to Him, sprinkled with blood, not outwardly with that of the ram of consecration, but inwardly with that of the Lamb of God: the first could only produce<i> purity of the flesh</i> [ch. ix. 13], but the second, pureness of heart and conscience in God’s sight. The washing with water also [Exod. xxix. 4] was to be part of the cleansing of Aaron and his sons: nor only so, but as often as they entered the holy place or approached the altar, they were to wash their hands and feet in the brazen laver, Exod. xxx. 20; xl. 30–32: and the High Priest, on the day of atonement,<i> was to wash his whole body with water</i>, Lev. xvi. 4. There can be no reasonable doubt that this clause refers directly to Christian baptism. The<i> “font of the water”</i> of Eph. v. 26, and the<i> “font of regeneration,”</i> Tit. iii. 5, are analogous expressions: and the express mention of<b> body</b> here, as distinguished from<i> “heart”</i> before, stamps this interpretation with certainty. This distinction makes it impossible, with Calvin, and others, to spiritualize away the meaning into “the Spirit and doctrine of Christ,—the spiritual water with which Christ sprinkles his own: even His blood is not here excluded” [Schlichting]; for the word<b> body</b> confines the reference to an outward act. And so the majority of Commentators. Still in maintaining the externality of the words, as referring, and referring solely, to Baptism, we must remember, that Baptism itself is not a mere external rite, but at every mention of it carries the thought further, viz. to that spiritual washing of which it is itself symbolical and sacramental. Notice here that the word is<b> body</b>, and not<i> “flesh,”</i> as ch. ix. 13: our whole natural life, and not the mere outside surface: that in which our soul dwells and works, the seat of the emotions and desires: this also must be purified in those who would approach God in Christ. So that I would understand with Delitzsch, that the<i> sprinkling the heart from an evil conscience</i> is, so to speak, intra-sacramental, a spiritual application of the purifying Blood, beyond sacramental rites, and the<i> washing the body with pure water</i> is purely sacramental, the effect of baptism taken in its whole blessed meaning and fulfilment as regards our natural existence. The end of his note very beautiful: “As priests we are sprinkled, as priests we are bathed: sprinkled so that our hearts are freed from an evil conscience, and thus from self-condemnation, sprinkled with Christ’s Blood, to be sprinkled with which and to be certain of and joyful in justification before God is one and the same thing,—washed in Holy Baptism, whose pure water penetrates with its saving power not only into the depths of our self-conscious life, but also into the very foundation of our corporeity, and thus sanctifies us not only in the flesh, but in the body and in the spirit: so bringing us, in our whole personal existence, through the Blood speaking in the Sanctuary, through the Water welling forth out of the Sanctuary, into so real a connexion, so close an union with the Sanctuary itself, that we are at all times privileged to enter into the Sanctuary, and to use, in faith, the new and living way”).
