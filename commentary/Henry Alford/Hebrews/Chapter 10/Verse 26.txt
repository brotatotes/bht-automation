<b> 26.] For if we willingly sin</b> (contrast to the<i> “ignorant and erring,”</i> ch. v. 2. The sin meant is sufficiently defined by the connexion [<b>for</b>] with the preceding exhortations, and by the description of one who has so sinned in ver. 29. Neglect of assembling together, and loss of mutual exhortation and stimulus, would naturally result in [as it would be prompted by an inclination that way at first] the<i> “departing from God”</i> of ch. iii. 12; the<i> “falling away”</i> of ch. vi 6. It is the sin of apostasy from Christ back to the state which preceded the reception of Christ, viz. Judaism. This is the ground-sin of all other sins. The verb is in the present, not the past. “If we be found wilfully sinning,” not “if we have wilfully sinned,” at that Day. It is not of an act. or of any number of acts of sin, that the Writer is speaking, which might be repented of and blotted out: but of a<i> state</i> of sin, in which a man is formed when that day shall come)<b> after the receiving</b> (having received)<b> the knowledge</b> ( “the word used for knowledge is one which of necessity means a<i> thorough, heart-knowledge.</i> And the Writer, by the use of this word, gives us to understand that he means by it not only a shallow historical notion about the Truth, but a living, believing knowledge of it, which has laid hold of a man and fused him into union with itself.” Delitzsch. It is most important here to keep this cardinal point distinctly in mind: that these sinners willingly are not mere professors of religion, but real converts, or else ver. 29 becomes unintelligible)<b> of the truth</b> (the truth of God, as so often in St. Paul and St. John),<b> there is no longer left remaining</b> (see on ch. iv. 6)<b> a sacrifice for sins</b> (for there is but One true sacrifice for sins: if a man, having availed himself of that One, then deliberately casts it behind him, there is no second left for him. It will be observed that one thing is not, and need not be, specified in the text. That he has exhausted the virtue of the One Sacrifice, is not said: but in proportion to his willing rejection of it, has it ceased to operate for him. He has in fact, as Delitzsch observes, shut the door of repentance behind him, by the very fact of his being in an abiding state of willing sin. And this is still more forcibly brought out when, which Delitzsch does not notice, the scene of action is transferred to the great day of the Lord’s coming, and he is found in that impenitent state irreparably. This verse has been misunderstood, 1) b: the Fathers, who apply it to the Novatian controversy, and make it assert the impossibility of a second baptism: 2) by Theodore of Mopsuestia and others, who interpret it only of those in a state of impenitence, understanding that on penitence they will again come under the cleansing influence of the blood of Christ),<b> but</b> (there is left remaining: this is common to both clauses)<b> a certain</b> (some one, out of all that might befall various men and dispositions.
