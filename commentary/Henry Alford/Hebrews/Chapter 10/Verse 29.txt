<b>of how much worse punishment, think ye</b> (an appeal to the judgment of the readers themselves),<b> shall he be found worthy</b> (i. e. by God),<b> who trampled under foot</b> (the verb is in the past tense, as spoken at that day, and looking back upon this life. By “trampling under foot” is meant that flagrant contempt which those shew who deliberately abandon the Lord and His precepts. Stier remarks: Some of us remember the cry, “Ecrasez l’ infame!”)<b> the Son of God</b> (the higher title of the Mediator of the new covenant is used, to heighten the enormity of the crime),<b> and accounted common the blood of the covenant</b> (being the “<i>precious blood</i>” of Christ Himself, far above all blood of sprinkling under’ the old covenant. Even that [Lev. xvi. 19] had hallowing power: how much more this. But the apostate “<i>accounted common</i>” this blood—deemed it mere ordinary blood of a common man, and if so, consented to its shedding, for then Christ deserved to die as a blasphemer. And this, of that holy Blood, by which we have access to God!So that we have quite enough for the solemn sense, by rendering the word literally<i> common</i>, without going to the further meaning,<i> unclean</i>. Compare Acts x. 28, where the two are distinguished.

He had advanced so far in the reality of the spiritual life, that this blood had been really applied to his heart by faith, and its hallowing and purifying effects were visible in his life: which makes the contrast the more terrible. And Delitzsch finely remarks, as against the assertors of mere shallow supralapsarianism, that without former experience of grace, without a life of faith far more than superficial, so irrecoverable a fall into the abyss is not possible. It is worthy of remark how Calvin evades the deep truth contained in the words<b> wherewith he was sanctified</b>:— “It is most unworthy to profane the blood of Christ,<i> which is the material of our sanctification:</i> and this those do who apostatize from the faith:” thus making
