 30 .]  For we know Him who said, To me belongeth vengeance, I will repay, saith the Lord (the citation is from Deuteronomy 32:35 , and is given not in agreement with the Hebrew text ( לִי נָקָם וְשַׁלֵּם , “To me (belongeth) vengeance and recompense”) nor with the LXX ( ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκδικήσεως (i. e. ליום נ , as is read in the Samaritan Pent.) ἀνταποδώσω , so also Philo, Leg.
