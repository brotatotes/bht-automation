And this<i> reception of judgment and fervour of fire</i> are certainties, testified to by God Himself.<b> For we know Him who said, “To me belongeth vengeance, I will repay, saith the Lord”</b> (the citation is from Deut. xxxii. 35, and is given not in agreement with the Hebrew text nor with the Septuagint [ “in the day of vengeance will I recompense:” so also in the Samaritan Pentateuch, and in Philo], but, remarkably enough, in verbal accordance with St, Paul’s citation of the same text, Rom. xii. 19, even to the adding of the words “<i>saith the Lord,</i>” which are neither in the Hebrew nor the Septuagint. Two solutions of this are possible: 1) that the expression had become a common saying in the church: 2) that our Writer takes it from St. Paul’s citation. A third alternative is of course open; that it is St. Paul himself, who quotes here as there. For a solution, see Introduction, on the authorship of this Epistle).<b> And again, The Lord will judge His people</b> (no doubt quoted primarily from the passage where it primarily occurs, in Deut. xxxii. 36. The<i> judging</i> there expresses another function of the judge from that which is adduced here. There, He will judge for rescue and for defence: here, for punishment and for condemnation. But the<i> office of Judge</i>, generally asserted, involves all that belongs to a judge: and if there it induces the comforting of those of whom He saw that their power is gone, and that there is here shut up or left, here the same general office of judgment also induces the punishment of the wilful sinner and apostate).
