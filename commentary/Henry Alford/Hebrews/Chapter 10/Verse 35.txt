Herod. viii. 65, τὸν ναυτικὸν στρατὸν κινδυνεύσει βασιλεὺς ἀποβαλέειν : see many more examples in Bleek: and Dio Chrys.

The Latin ‘ <em> quippe quæ</em> ’ expresses it well: ‘being of such sort, as …’) <strong> hath</strong> ( <em> present</em> , although the reward is future: hath, set down over against it: possesses in reversion) <strong> great recompense of reward</strong> (see on <strong> μισθαποδοσία</strong> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span> , note; also reff.).</p>
