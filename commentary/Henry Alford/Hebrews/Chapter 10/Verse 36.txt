 36 .]  For (justification of the foregoing μὴ ἀποβάλητε κ . τ . λ .)  of endurance (  ὑπομονῆς is placed first, carrying the main emphasis. “Paulatim,” says Bengel, “Apostolus ab hoc versu ad 38 prophetam inducit.” For in Habakkuk 2:2-3 , the whole passage runs thus: ἐὰν ὑστερήσῃ , ὑπόμεινον αὐτόν · ὅτι ἐρχόμενος ἥξει καὶ οὐ μὴ χρονίσῃ . ἐὰν ὑποστείληται , οὐκ εὐδοκεῖ ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν αὐτῷ · ὁ δὲ δίκαιος ἐκ πίστεώς μου ( μου ἐκ πίστεως Α ) ζήσεται )  ye have need, that ye may do the will of God and receive the promise (the aor. part., preceding an aor. verb, is often contemporary with it in time, and so requires to be rendered in English by a synchronous tense, as in the case of ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπε , he answered and said. And thus it certainly ought to be taken here. No endurance or patience would be wanted, when they had done the will of God, to receive the promise; because such interval as should elapse between their ποιῆσαι τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ in this sense, and κομίσασθαι τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν , would be not here, but in the intermediate state. But that which they really do want ὑπομονή for is that they may δοκιμάζειν τί τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ εὐάρεστον καὶ τέλειον , and thus receive the promise: see ch. Hebrews 13:21 .  ἐπαγγελία , as in reff., not the  word of promise, but the substance of the promise, the promise in its fulfilment.  κομίζεσθαι , reff., of gathering a reward, or a prize from a contest, see Eur. Hipp. 432, δόξαν ἐσθλὴν κομίζεται : Thuc. iii. 58, σώφρονα ἀντὶ αἰσχρᾶς κομίσασθαι χάριν ).
