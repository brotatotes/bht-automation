<b> 36.</b>]<b> For</b> (justification of the foregoing exhortation)<b> of endurance</b> (this in the original is placed first, carrying the main emphasis, “By degrees,” Bengel, “the Apostle from this verse to ver. 38 introduces the prophetic citation.” In the Septuagint, in Hab. ii. 3, 4, the whole passage runs thus: “Though it tarry, wait for it: because it will surely come, it will not tarry. If any man draw back, my Lord hath no pleasure in him: but the just by my faith shall live”)<b> ye have need, that ye may do the will of God and receive the promise</b> (this is the most correct rendering of the original: and thus it certainly ought to be taken here. No endurance or patience would be wanted, when they had done the will of God, to receive the promise: because such interval as should elapse between their<i> having done the will of God</i> in this sense, and<i> receiving the promise</i>, would be not here, but in the intermediate state. But that which they really do want<i> endurance</i> for, is that they may “prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God,” and thus receive the promise: see ch. xiii. 21.<b> The promise</b> means, not the<i> word</i> of promise, but the substance of the promise, the promise in its fulfilment).
