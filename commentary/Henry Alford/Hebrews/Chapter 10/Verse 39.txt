 39 .] Here again he returns from that which is threatening in appearance to that which is encouraging and reassuring.  But we (emphatic; bringing with it, in its mention, all that we are as Christians and that God has made us: you and I, κλήσεως ἐπουρανίου μέτοχοι , ch. Heb 3:1 )  are not of backsliding (there is no ellipsis after ἐσμέν , as υἱοί , or τέκνα : the gen. of category is common enough: see Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 165, who gives many examples. ὑποστολή takes up ὑποστείληται above.
