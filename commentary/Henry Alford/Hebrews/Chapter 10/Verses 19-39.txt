<p><strong> 19 13:25</strong> .] THE THIRD GREAT DIVISION OF THE EPISTLE: OUR DUTY IN THE INTERVAL OF WAITING BETWEEN THE BEGINNING AND ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR SALVATION. And herein, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-39">Hebrews 10:19-39</span> , exhortation to enter boldly into the holiest place, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-22">Hebrews 10:19-22</span> : to hold fast our profession, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span> : to stir up one another, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:24-25">Hebrews 10:24-25</span> : in consideration of the fearful punishment which awaits the rejecters of Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26-31">Hebrews 10:26-31</span> : and in remembrance of the previous sufferings which they underwent when first converted, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:32-34">Hebrews 10:32-34</span> . Finally, exhortation not to cast away confidence, for the time until His coming is short, and during that time, faith is the life of the soul.
	</p>
<p>There has been no exhortation, properly speaking, since ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:1">Hebrews 7:1</span> , i. e. during the great doctrinal argument of the Epistle. Before that, argument and exhortation were rapidly alternated. But so exquisite is the skill of arrangement and development, that the very exhortation with which he closed the former portion of the Epistle where first he began to prepare the way for his great argument, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14-16">Hebrews 4:14-16</span> , is now resumed, deepened indeed and expanded by the intervening demonstration, but in spirit and substance the same: προσερχώμεθα μετ ʼ ἀληθινῆς καρδίας ἐν πληροφρίᾳ πίστεως here, answering to προσερχώμεθα μετὰ παῤῥησίας τῷ θρόνῳ τῆς χάριτος there, and κατέχωμεν τὴν ὁμολογίαν here to κρατῶμεν τῆς ὁμολογίας there.</p>
