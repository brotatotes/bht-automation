<b> 1.</b>]<b> Now Faith is</b> (notice that it is of<i> faith</i> in general,<i> all</i> faith, not here of faith in God in particular, that the Writer is speaking)<b> confidence</b> (there has been much difference concerning the meaning of this word [<i>hypostasis</i>]. The ancients for the most part understand it here as substance, the real and true essence: faith gives reality to things not yet seen, so that they are treated as veritably present. Others have rendered it<i> foundation</i>. On the other hand the majority of modern Commentators have preferred the meaning which the word bears in ch. iii. 14, where see note: viz. “confidence.” And there can be no reasonable doubt, that this is the true rendering here. Thus only do the two descriptions given correspond in nature and quality. The one being subjective in both these cases of parallel, it is but reasonable that the other should be also)<b> of things hoped for, demonstration</b> (<i>conviction</i>, or<i> proof</i>. The modern Commentators are divided: some have taken the subjective sense of<i> conviction,</i>—<i>inward persuasion of the truth of</i>. But this sense of the word is hardly borne out by usage. And therefore we seem driven back on the objective meaning as referred to things, viz.<i> proof</i>, or<i> demonstration</i>. As far as the<i> sense</i> is concerned, both come to the same in the end. It is faith, an act of the mind, which is this demonstration: it is therefore necessarily subjective in its effect,—is the demonstration<i> to him who believes</i>)<b> of matters not seen</b> (this is a much wider designation than<i> things hoped for</i>, embracing the whole realm of the spiritual and invisible, even to the being and essence of God Himself: see below, ver. 6: and compare Rom. viii. 24, where St. Paul’s expressions differ slightly in form from these. There is no ground whatever for saying that our Writer makes faith identical with hope. Faith is the<i> confidence of things hoped for</i>: Hope<i> exists</i> independently of it,” but derives its reality, and is ripened into confidence, by its means. And faith is the demonstration to us of that which we do not see: compare the beautiful words of Calvin: “Eternal life is promised to us, but after death: we are told of a blessed resurrection, but we meantime become the prey of decay: we are pronounced righteous, and yet sin dwells in us: we hear ourselves called blessed, and meantime are overwhelmed with infinite miseries: we are promised affluence of all good things, but are all our days in hunger and thirst: God proclaims that He will be ever present to help us, but seems deaf to our cries. What would become of us if we leant not on hope, and unless our mind, guided by the Word and Spirit of God, emerged through the midst of the shades, above this present world?”).
