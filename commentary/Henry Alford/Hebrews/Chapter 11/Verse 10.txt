<b> 10.</b>]<b> for</b> (reason of his sojourning in the land of promise as in a strange land)<b> he waited for the city which has the foundations</b> (beyond doubt, the heavenly city, the “<i>Jerusalem which is above,</i>” thus contrasted with the frail and moveable tents in which the patriarchs dwelt. No other interpretation will suit the language here used. The “<i>city of the living God</i>” of ch. xii, 32, and the “<i>city which is to come</i>” of ch. xiii. 14, must be here meant also. Of the earthly Jerusalem indeed it is said, Ps. lxxxvii. 1, “<i>its foundation is in the holy mountains:</i>” but it is impossible, that the earthly Jerusalem can be meant here. The lives of the dwellers in her rather corresponded to the precarious dwelling in tents than to the abiding in a permanent city: and the true reference of the expression “<b>having the foundations</b>” is to be found in Rev. xxi. 14, 19. As having these foundations, it forms a contrast to the tent, placed on the ground and easily transported. Ebrard objects to this view, that it is unhistoric to say that the patriarchs looked for the heavenly city: but Delitzsch well answers, that it is not the mere historic question, what they knew and expected, with which our Writer is concerned, but the question what it was that their faith, breaking through this knowledge in its yearnings for the future, framed to itself as matter of hope. The expectation of the literal fulfilment of a promise is one thing: the hopes and prospects and surmises built upon the character of that promise, another. The one is mere belief: the other is faith),<b> of which the architect and master-builder is God</b> (very similarly) ch. viii. 2: see also ver. 16 below).
