<p><strong> 10</strong> .] <strong> for</strong> (reason of his παροικία in the land of promise as in a strange land) <strong> he waited for</strong> (the prep. in <strong> ἐκ</strong> δέχομαι , as in <strong> ἐκ</strong> ζητέω above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:6">Hebrews 11:6</span> , intensifies the expectation) <strong> the city which has the foundations</strong> (beyond doubt, the heavenly city, the ἄνω Ἱερουσαλήμ , thus contrasted with the frail and moveable tents in which the patriarchs dwelt. Delitzsch shews that the idea was an Old Testament one; and no other interpretation will suit the language here used. The πόλις θεοῦ ζῶντος of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span> , and the μέλλουσα πόλις of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:14">Hebrews 13:14</span> , must be here meant also. Of the earthly Jerusalem indeed it is said, ref. Ps., οἱ θεμέλιοι αὐτοῦ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι τοῖς ἁγίοις : but it is impossible that the earthly Jerusalem can be meant here. The lives of the dwellers in her rather corresponded to the precarious dwelling in tents than to the abiding in a permanent city: and the true reference of τοὺς θεμελίους ἔχουσα is to be found in ref. Rev., τὸ τεῖχος τῆς πόλεως ἔχων θεμελίους δώδεκα . As having these foundations, it forms a contrast to the tent, placed on the ground, and easily transported. Ebrard objects to this view, that it is unhistoric to say that the patriarchs looked for the heavenly city: but Del. well answers, that it is not the mere historic question, what they knew and expected, with which our Writer is concerned, but the question what it was that their faith, breaking through this knowledge in its yearnings for the future, framed to itself as matter of hope. The expectation of the literal fulfilment of a promise is one thing: the hopes and prospects and surmises built upon the character of that promise, another. The one is mere belief: the other is faith), <strong> of which the architect and master-builder is God</strong> (very similarly, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span> , ἣν ἔπηξεν ὁ κύριος , οὐκ ἄνθρωπος : cf. also Heb 11:16 below. <strong> τεχνίτης</strong> , so ref. Wisd., οὔτε τοῖς ἔργοις προσσχόντες ἐπέγνωσαν τὸν τεχνίτην . And Philo, Leg. Alleg. i. 7, vol. i. p. 47, οὐ τεχνίτης μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ πατὴρ ὢν τῶν γιγνομένων : De Mut. Nom. § 4, p. 583, ὁ γεννήσας καὶ τεχνιτεύσας πατήρ : ib. (of <em> men</em> ), δημιούργημα τοῦ τῶν καλῶν καὶ ἀγαθῶν μόνου τεχνίτου . In Xen. Mem. i. 4. 7, it is said of the world, πάνυ ἔοικε ταῦτα σοφοῦ τινος δημιουργοῦ καὶ φιλοζώου τεχνήματι : and Plato, Tim. § 9, calls God δημιουργὸν τοῦ κόσμου καὶ τεκταινόμενον αὐτόν .
