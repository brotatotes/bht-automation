<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <strong> And if indeed</strong> (‘posito,’ that.…: hence the indicative) <strong> they were mindful</strong> (see below. Bl., De W., Lünem. render it, “had made mention,” as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:22">Hebrews 11:22</span> . And so Del. inclines. But this would necessitate a very harsh ellipsis: If we found them making mention &amp;c., they might have had opportunity to gratify the wish thus expressed) <strong> of that</strong> (home) <strong> from which they went out, they would continually be having opportunity to return</strong> ( <strong> ἀνακάμπτω</strong> is neuter generally, in classical Greek also: cf. Herod. ii. 8, ταύτῃ μὲν λῆγον ἀνακάμπτει εἰς τὰ εἴρηται τὸ ὄρος . The two imperfects in this sentence present some little difficulty. The general rendering of dependent imperfects is as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:46">John 5:46</span> , εἰ ἐπιστεύετε Μωυσεῖ , ἐπιστεύετε ἂν ἐμοί , “If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me.” So also in Latin: “Servi.… mei si me isto pacto metuerent, ut te metuunt omnes cives tui, domum meam relinquendam putarem,” Cic. in Cat. i. 7: “If my slaves feared me.… I should think.” But such a rendering here is out of the question, both events being past and gone: we could not say, ‘If they remembered.… they might have opportunity.’ It would therefore seem that the imperfects are here used not so much in their logical temporal places, as on account of the <em> habitual</em> sense which both members of the sentence are meant to convey: ‘If they were, through their lives, mindful &amp;c., they would have through their lives, they would continually be having, opportunities’ &amp;c.):</p>
