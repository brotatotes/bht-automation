<b> 16.</b>]<b> But now</b> (as the case now is: the logical “<i>now:</i>” see 1 Cor. xiii. 13 note, and our ch. viii. 6)<b> they desire a better</b> (home),<b> that is, a heavenly one</b> (the justification of this assertion, which seems to ascribe New Test. ideas to the Old Test. fathers, must be found in such sayings as that of the dying Jacob, Gen. xlix. 18, which only represent a wide class of their faithful thoughts):<b> wherefore God is not ashamed of them to be called their God</b> (from the present tense, is not ashamed, and especially from the clause which follows, it is probable, as Bleek has well remarked, that the Writer intends not merely to adduce that God did once call Himself their God, but that he is<i> now</i> not ashamed to be so called, they enduring and abiding with Him where He is: in the same sense in which our Lord adduces the same circumstance, Matt. xxii. 31 ff. See below):<b> for He prepared for them a city</b> (permanent and eternal, in contrast to the tents in which they wandered. There are two ways of understanding this clause: 1) to take the verb asa pluperfect, “for God had prepared for them a city:” 2) God is not ashamed of them, nor to be called their God: and we find proof of this not only in His thus naming Himself, but in His<i> preparing</i> for them a city: the home for which they yearned: He did not deceive their hopes, but acted as their God by verifying those hopes. Thus, and thus only, does the<i> preparing</i> keep its proper emphasis, and the past tense its proper time:<i> they looked for a city:</i> and God refused not to be called their God, for<i> He prepared</i> for them that city, verified those their hopes. And if we ask for the<i> interpretation</i> of this<i> preparing</i>, I answer, in the preparation of the way of Christ, and bringing in salvation by Him, of which salvation they in their anticipation of faith were partakers John viii. 56).
