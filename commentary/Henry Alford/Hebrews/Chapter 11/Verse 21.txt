<b> 21.</b>]<b> By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph</b> (the faith consisted in transposing his hands wittingly, laying the right hand on the head of the younger, Ephraim, who was to become the greater tribe);<b> and he worshipped</b> (this incident is not connected with the other, but took place before it, on another occasion, when Jacob made Joseph swear to him that he would bury him with his fathers, and not in Egypt, Gen. xlvii. 31. Perhaps the Writer inverts, the order of the two, to bring the two acts of blessing, that of Isaac and that of Jacob, together. This act of worship was one of faith, inasmuch as it was connected with a command, the point of which was, God’s promise respecting the land of Canaan. And the faith was shewn by the turning of, his aged and dying body in a posture of thankful adoration)<b> on the top of his staff</b> (an incalculable quantity of idolatrous nonsense has been written on these words by Roman-Catholic Commentators, taking as their starting-point the rendering of the Vulgate, “and adored the top of his staff,” and thence deriving an argument for the worship of images, assuming that there was an image or symbol of power upon<i> Joseph's</i> staff, to which they apply the words. But first, it must be<i> Jacob’s</i>, not Joseph’s staff, which is intended, as remarked by Augustine. In his comment on the place, he has nothing of adoring the staff or the top of the staff. What Jerome thought of such an idea, is plainly seen: for he derides it, and treats it simply as a mistranslation of the Hebrew, which he explains as it stands in our A.V. Chrysostom has the idea, but not a word of the<i> image</i>: thinks that Jacob worshipped the power, symbolized by Joseph. I will only cite the inference from the above ancient data in Cornelius-a-Lapide, as most instructive regarding the grounds on which age after age the chief abominations of the church of Rome have been introduced: “Rightly therefore do the Fathers of the second Nicene Council prove, from this adoration of Joseph’s staff, the adoration and culture of images, and teach that it does not stop with the image, but is referred and passed on to its prototype.” The real question with regard to the passage is confined within very narrow limits. The same Hebrew word signifies a<i> staff</i>, or a<i> bed</i>, according as it is pointed. And, as there are no points in the ancient Hebrew texts, it is an open question, which meaning we are to take. The Septuagint have taken “<i>staff,</i>” though, as Jerome notices, they have rendered the same word “<i>bed</i>” in Gen. xlviii. 2, two verses after. Our A.V. has taken this latter: “And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.” And so almost all the moderns agree in taking it. Stuart, it is true, has argued at some length for the meaning “staff,” on the ground that the eastern beds have no head properly so called, being merely a carpet or rag spread on the ground. But he has in his mind in thus objecting, a bed<i> stead</i>, not a bed. The head of a bed, be it where or what it may, is that part of it where the person’s head lies; and Delitzsch has made it probable, that Jacob turned himself in his bed so as to lay his face to the pillow: compare Isa. xxxviii. 2. If the ‘staff’ is to be taken, then it must be his own, not Joseph’s staff, which is indicated, and the gesture might have had a meaning correspondent to the thought in Gen. xxii. 10, “<i>with my staff I passed this Jordan;</i>” viz. the recognition of that God who had supported him through life, and declaration of his having done with all human supports. It is due to the better Roman-Catholic Commentators, such as Estius and Justiniani, to say, that no such inference as that cited above is to be found in them. Some have expressed surprise that no mention is made of the far more important blessings of the twelve sons of Jacob in Gen. xlix. But Delitzsch says well, “He plucks, so to speak, only the flowers which stand by his way, and leaves the whole meadow-full to his readers”).
