<b> 23.</b>] Now the Writer passes on to Exodus, and its chief example, Moses, who even in his preservation by his parents was the child of faith.<b> By faith Moses, when born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw the child was comely; and they feared not the command of the king</b> (to destroy all the male children, Exod. i, 22, faith was, loving trust in God who had given them so fair a child, which led them to perform, as far as in them lay, the duties of parents to it, and not the cruel part which the tyrant prescribed).<b> 24–28.</b>]<i> The faith of Moses when come to man’s estate.</i><b> By faith Moses, when grown up</b> (literally,<i> become great</i>. The expression is from the Greek of the passage in Exodus),<b> refused to be called son of a</b> (or,<b> the</b>)<b> daughter of Pharaoh</b> (there is no record in the Old Test. of this refusal of Moses: but the fact of the adoption was matter of Jewish traditionary belief: and the refusal is fairly gathered from his whole conduct);<b> choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to possess a temporary enjoyment of sin; esteeming</b> (this comes in with a slightly ratiocinative force— “esteeming, as he did”)<b> the reproach of Christ</b> (what is this? Certainly not, with some, merely reproach<i> similar to that of Christ:</i> nor again does the more usual explanation, reproach<i> on account of Christ</i>, satisfy the meaning; nor even the modification of it which makes Moses thus choose, from a principle of faith in the Messiah to come. Far better is Bleek, “reproach which Christ in his own person, and has to members.” And in this view, we may say, that all Israel’s reproach was Christ's reproach: Israel typified Christ: all Israel’s sufferings as the people of God were Christ’s sufferings, not only by anticipation in type, but, by that inclusion in Christ which they, His members before the Head was revealed, possessed in common with us. Christ was ever present in and among God’s people: and thus De Wette well and finely says here, “The Writer calls the reproach which Moses suffered, the reproach of Christ, as Paul, 2 Cor. i. 5; Col. i. 24, calls the sufferings of Christians the sufferings of Christ, i.e. of Christ dwelling, striving, suffering, in his Church as in His body; to which this reproach is referred according to the idea of the unity of the Old and New Testaments, and of the eternal Christ [the Logos] already living and reigning in the former”)<b> greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked</b> (the verb means, “so to look at any thing, as to be by waiting for it, or generally by the regard of it, determined or strengthened in a course of action”)<b> to the recompence of reward</b> (viz. the great eternal reward spoken of vv. 39 f.: not the possession of Canaan merely)
