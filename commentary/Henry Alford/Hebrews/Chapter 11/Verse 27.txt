<b> 27.</b>]<b> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king</b> (<i>when?</i> This is much disputed. Was it when he fled after the murder of the Egyptian? or when he left Egypt with the children of Israel? Against the latter, it seems a decisive objection, that the Exodus was made, not in defiance of the king of Egypt, but with his consent, and at his urgent instance. It is also a lesser objection to it, that thus the chronological order is broken, the next particular, the institution of the Passover, having taken place previously to the Exodus. A third objection is, and one not easily got over, that the singular,<i> he left</i> Egypt, cannot well be referred to an event in Israel’s history, but must refer to the personal history of Moses. Otherwise we should expect “<i>he crossed,</i>” and not “<i>they crossed,</i>” below in ver. 29, Regard being had to these objections, I cannot but think that to understand this. of the Exodus is altogether impossible. It must then refer to the former flight. And this is the view of all the ancient expositors: and of many among the moderns. But we are here met by a startling difficulty. In Exod. ii, 14, we read that on finding that his slaying of the Egyptian was known, “<i>Moses was afraid:</i>” here we read, “<i>not fearing the wrath of the king.</i>” Were it not for this difficulty, we may ly say that the other interpretation would never have been thought of; but standing as it does, it is no wonder that it has driven Commentators to another resource. Still, if owing to other circumstances in the text it is, as we have seen it to be, necessary to refer it to that first leaving of Egypt, we have no right to set those aside on account of this difficulty: rather should we say that there must be some solution of it, however difficult to find. In attempting to give a solution, I may confess that I see as yet no<i> satisfactory</i> one, It may be that the truth is, that though the fact of his flight was the effect of his fear, the same flight itself, the dereliction of Egypt and reserving himself for farther action, shewed that that fear did not<i> possess</i> nor bear him away. But on any solution, the difficulty remains. Had it stood “<i>fearing</i>,” instead of<b> not fearing</b>, the whole would have been plain enough: “when he feared the anger of the king”):<b> for he endured, as seeing the invisible One</b> (or, “the King who is invisible:” compare 1 Tim. i. 17).
