 29 .]  By faith, they (see above)  crossed (the verb  διαβαίνω is used of crossing water, whether in boats, or on a bridge, or swimming or wading: e. g. Herod. i. 75, of the river Halys, Κροῖσος , … κατὰ τὰς ἐούσας γεφύρας  διεβίβασε τὸν στρατόν : … ἀπορέοντος ὅκως οἱ  διαβήσεται τ . ποταμὸν ὁ στρατός : … ἐπεί τε καὶ ἐσχίσθη τάχιστα ὁ ποταμός , ἀμφοτέρῃ  διαβατὸς ἐγένετο . Here it is used of a  bridge , of  crossing, generally , and of a  ford . See other examples in Bl.)  the red sea (so the LXX always for יַם־סוּף , the sea of (red) weeds)  as through dry land (we should rather expect ὡς ξηρὰν γῆν ; but the unusual expression is apparently borrowed from the narrative in Exodus (ref.), οἱ δὲ νἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπορεύθησαν διὰ ξηρᾶς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης ):  of which (viz. of the  red sea , not, of the  dry land , as Böhme, Kuinoel, and Klee. For as Lün. observes, the idea of the sea is necessarily called up again by κατεπόθησαν , shewing that it, and not the dry land, is the leading idea)  the Egyptians making experiment (here, πεῖραν λαμβάνειν is in an active sense: in Hebrews 11:36 , in a passive. Both are sufficiently common: e. g. for the active, Plato, Protag. p. 342 A, εἰ βούλει λαβεῖν μου πεῖραν ὅπως ἔχω : ib. 348 A: Gorg. 448 A: Polyb. ii. 32. 5, ἔκριναν τῆς τύχης λαβεῖν πεῖραν . See many others in Bleek: and for the other sense, on Heb 11:36 )  were swallowed up (by the sea. The verb is a general one, qualified by the particular mode of καταπίνεσθαι . So in reff. Exod. and Num.: Diod. Sic. i. 32, τῶν δ ʼ ἀποσχιζομένων μερῶν τὸ μὲν .… ὑπ ʼ ἄμμου καταπίνεται . And Polyb. ii. 41. 7, using the word of drowning, qualifies it: Ἑλίκης , τῆς .… ὑπὸ τῆς θαλάττης καταποθείσης . There is something to be said for the reading κατεποντίσθησαν , though it is weakly supported by mss., as being the Alex. reading of the LXX in Exodus 15:4 , and found in Chrys. and Thdrt. Bleek inclines to think that our Writer may have had it in his Alexandrine LXX).
