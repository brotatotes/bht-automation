<b> 3.</b>] The Writer now begins his series of examples of the power of faith. But instead of opening them with the example of our first parents, which he probably passes over as not sufficiently recorded in Scripture, he adduces the great and primary postulate of faith, which has regard to a fact contemporaneous indeed with them, and holding this first chronological place in the series: viz. the creation of the world itself.<b> By faith</b> (<i>faith</i> is the instrumental cause, and the expression is nearly equivalent to<b> through faith</b>, with which indeed it is interchanged in ver. 33)<b> we perceive</b> (we have intellectual perception. The world itself, and the therein, are<i> seen</i> by us: but the its eration by God is<i> apprehended</i>, with our rational or spiritual faculties) the<b> ages</b> (see note on ch. i. 2, where I have maintained that this expression includes in it all that exists under the conditions of time and space, together with those conditions of time and space themselves, conditions which do not bind God, and did not exist independently of Him, but are themselves the work of His word)<b> to have been framed</b> (so A.V.: and we cannot perhaps do better. It is rather however,<i> furnished forth</i>, “made to be, and to be what we find them”)<b> by the word of God</b> (the<i> spoken word</i>, the command, as throughout Gen. i.:—the term in the Greek is not<i> logos</i>. Not must it here be taken for the personal word: ch. i. 2, is on a different matter),<b> so that not out of things apparent hath that which is seen</b> (i. e. the visible world)<b> been made</b> (in all that we see with our sense, of recreation and reproduction,<i> that which is seen is made out of that which appears.</i> The seed becomes the plant: the grub, the moth. But that which is above sight, viz., faith, leads us to apprehend, that this has not been so in the first instance: that the visible world has not been made ont of apparent materials).
