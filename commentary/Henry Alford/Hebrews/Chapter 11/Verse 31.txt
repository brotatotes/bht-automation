Clement of Rome devotes to her a whole chapter of his Epistle to the Corinthians, and has no idea of her other than as an harlot. Calvin says well, “Hoc (epitheton) ad anteactam vitam referri certum est: resipiscentiæ enim testis est fides.” See note, Mat 1:5 )  did not perish with them who were disobedient (on the word  ἀπειθέω , see note ch. Hebrews 3:18 . The inhabitants of Jericho were disobedient to the will of God manifested by the signs and wonders which he had wrought for Israel: as is implied by Rahab’s speech, Jos 2:9-12 ),  having received (viz. to her house: κατέλυσαν ἐκεῖ , Jos 2:1 )  the spies (sent by Joshua to Jericho: ἀπέστειλεν Ἰησοῦς δύο νεανίσκους κατασκοπεῦσαι , Jos 2:1 )  with peace (reff.: so that they had nothing hostile to fear from her). On the introduction of Rahab in James 2:25 , as an example of justification by works, see note there.
