<b> 32.</b>]<b> And what say I yet</b> (more, any)<b> further? for the time</b> (which might be reasonable for writing an epistle)<b> will fail me narrating</b> (if I narrate)<b> concerning Gideon</b> (see Judges vi.–viii.), and<b> Barak</b> (Judges iv. v. Barak was not so strong in faith as he might have been, though he did believe and go to the fight, and triumph: see Judg. iv. 8, 9),<b> and Samson</b> (Judges xiii–xvi.),<b> and Jephthah</b> (Judges xi. l—xii, 7);<b> and David, and Samuel, and of the prophets; who</b> (does not strictly identify the antecedents: for many of the actions which follow were done by others than those previously mentioned)<b> through faith</b> (<b>through faith</b>, instead of “<i>by faith,</i>” for the first time in the chapter, suits perhaps better the miscellaneous verbs of predication which follow, e.g.<i> quenched the violence of fire</i>)<b> subdued kingdoms</b> (the acts referred to may be Gideon’s victory over the Midianites Judges vii.], Barak’s over the Canaanites [ib. iv.], Samson’s over the Philistines [ib. xiv. ff.], Jephthah’s over the Ammonites [ib. ix.], David’s over the Philistines [2 Sam. v. 17–25; viii. 1; xxi. 15 ff.], Moabites, Syrians, Edomites [ib viii. 2 ff.], Ammonites [ib. x. xii. 26 ff.]),<b> wrought righteousness</b> (so Samuel, the righteous judge, 1 Sam. xii. 3, 4: David, the righteous king, 2 Sam. viii, 15; 1 Chron. xviii, 14: and indeed in a wide sense all of them, see Jer. xxiii. 5; Ezek. xlv. 9),<b> obtained promises</b> (the words are capable of two senses: 1) got from God spoken promises, as e.g. the prophets: or 2) obtained the fulfilment of promises. 1) is taken by Chrysostom [referring it to the promise to David that his seed should sit on his throne], and others. But it seems to me altogether improbable that the Writer should’ thus illustrate faith by a fact which, though it may have accompanied faith in the recipient, was certainly no fruit or direct triumph of it: and that in the face of such sayings as Josh. xxi. 45; 1 Kings viii. 56, and of Gideon’s trials of God. The objection which is brought against 2), that it is inconsistent with “<i>not having received the promises,</i>” ver. 13, and with “<i>received not the promise,</i>” ver. 39, is very simply answered: it is not said that they obtained<b> the</b> promises, or<b> the</b> promise, but anarthrously: they obtained promises, but not<i> the</i> promises which were yet future. And so most Commentators),<b> stopped the mouths of lions</b> (referring principally, it may be, to Daniel, of whom it is said, Dan. vi. 22, that God sent his angel and stopped the mouths of the lions: where notice also the addition “<i>because he believed in his God.</i>” But reference may be also to Samson, Judges xiv. 6, and David, 1 Sam, xvii. 34: and I may add, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, 2 Sam. xxiii. 20; 1 Chron. xi. 22),
