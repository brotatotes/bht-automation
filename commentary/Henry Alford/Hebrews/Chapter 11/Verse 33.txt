Numa, § 19, ἀπὸ Καίσαρος , τοῦ κατηγωνισαμένου Πομπήϊον , &c. The acts referred to may be Gideon’s victory over the Midianites (Judges 7:0 ), Barak’s over the Canaanites (Judges 9:0 ), Samson’s over the Philistines (Judges 14 ff.), Jephthah’s over the Ammonites (Judges 9:0 .), David’s over the Philistines (2 Samuel 5:17-25 ; 2Sa 8:1 ; 2 Samuel 21:15 ff.), Moabites, Syrians, Edomites (ib. 2 Samuel 8:2 ff.), Ammonites (2 Samuel 10:12 , ff.)),  wrought righteousness (so Samuel, the righteous judge, 1 Samuel 12:3-4 ; David, the righteous king, 2 Samuel 8:15 ; 1 Chronicles 18:14 ; and indeed in a wide sense all of them, see Jeremiah 23:5 ; Ezekiel 45:9 , τοῦτο κοινὸν τῶν ἁγίων ἁπάντων , as Thdrt.),  obtained promises (the words are capable of two senses: 1. got from God spoken promises, as e. g. the Prophets: or 2. obtained the fulfilment of promises.

The objection which is brought against (2), that it is inconsistent with μὴ λαβόντες τὰς ἐπαγγελίας , Hebrews 11:13 , and with οὐκ ἐκομίσαντο τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν , Hebrews 11:39 , is very simply answered: it is not said that they ἐπέτυχον  τῶν ἐπαγγελιῶν or τῆς ἐπαγγελίας , but anarthrously: they obtained promises, but not  the promises which were yet future. And so most Commentators),  stopped the mouths of lions (referring principally, it may be, to Daniel, of whom it is said, Daniel 6:22 , that God sent his angel and stopped ( וּסֲגַר , ἐνέφραξε Theodotion; LXX freely, ἔσωσέν με ἀπὸ τῶν λ .) the mouths of the lions: where notice also the addition ( Heb 11:23 Theod.), ὅτι ἐπίστευσεν ἐν τῷ θεῷ αὐτοῦ . But reference may be also to Samson, Judges 14:6 , and David, 1 Samuel 17:34 ; and I may add, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, 2 Samuel 23:20 ; 1Ch 11:22 ),
