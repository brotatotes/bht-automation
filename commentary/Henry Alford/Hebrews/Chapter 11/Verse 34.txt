<b> 34.</b>]<b> quenched the power of fire</b> (so the three companions of Daniel,—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, Dan. iii. Theophylact says, “He does not say, extinguished<i> fire</i>, but<i> the power of fire</i>, which is even greater: though it remained kindled, yet it had no power against them to burn them.” It is said of them, 1 Macc. ii. 59, that they “<i>by believing were saved out of the flame.</i>” Delitzsch reminds us that one of the two martyrs at Brussels, Henry Voes and Joh. Esche, when the flames of the faggots rose round him, said, that it felt to him as if they were strewing roses under him),<b> escaped the edge</b> (literally,<b> mouths</b>, or<b> edges</b>, plural, because the Writer has various examples in mind)<b> of the sword</b> (e. g. David from Saul, 1 Sam. xviii. 11; xix. 10, 12; xxi. 10: Elijah, 1 Kings xix. 1 ff.: Elisha, 2 Kings vi 14 ff., 31 ff.: Jeremiah, Baruch, Jer. xxxvi. 26: Ebedmelech, Jer. xxxviii. 8 ff., compared with xxxix. 18),<b> were made strong out of weakness</b> (so Samson, after his hair grew, Judges xvi. 28 ff.: David, who ends so many of his plaintive psalms with jubilant thanksgiving: Hezekiah, who after deadly sickness was restored to fifteen years of health, 2 Kings xx.; Isa. xxxviii. The ancient expositors refer the words, not so probably, to the strengthening of Israel after the return from the captivity),<b> were made strong in war</b> (Theodoret says, “Both those mentioned before, and the sons of Mattathias, Judas, and Jonathan, and Simon.” It is not improbable that these later glories of the faith were also before the Writer’s mind: they unquestionably are in the next verse),<b> put to flight armies of aliens</b> (the word is common in the Septuagint, of Gentiles, aliens from God’s people. The reference of the fact may be general, to many who have preceded: but I should rather regard it as describing the Maccabean victories. Delitzsch would understand all from “<i>escaped the edge of the sword</i>” of those times; the escape of Mattathias and his sons into the mountains, the increase and success of the little band that strengthened itself in God, the first victories of Judas Maccabæus over Apollonius, Seron, and others, the formal and victorious war of the Asmonæan heroes with the Syrians and neighbouring people. “That the Writer,” he continues, “should recognize these as illustrious deeds of faith, is no wonder. In our times indeed it is the custom to represent the mighty revival of the Maccabæan period rather as human than divine, rather as patriotic and popular than theocratic and national: but the book of Daniel shews us, in prophetic delineation of that time, the holy people of the Most High, conflicting with the atheistic and antichristian prince of this world, and ascribes to this conflict the highest imaginable importance in reference to the sacred history. Therefore I hold that these clauses pass beyond ‘<i>the prophets,</i>’ and over the book of Daniel to the first of Maccabees, which in the Septuagint is attached to it: which indeed is generally acknowledged with regard to the two last clauses, and is the more certain because the unusual word here used for armies, as well as that for aliens, are of frequent occurrence in the first book of Maccabees.” And perhaps, after all, this may be the true view),
