<b> 35.</b>]<b> Women received their dead by</b> (out of, by means of, their reception springing out of it as its cause)<b> resurrection</b> (not,<i> the resurrection</i>: see below. The cases alluded to seem to be those of the widow of Zarephath, 1 Kings xvii. 17 ff., and the Shunamite, 2 Kings iv. 17 ff., whose sons were raised, the former by Elijah, the latter by Elisha. The faith must be that of the women themselves, the subject of the sentence, not merely that in the prophets):<b> but</b> (for the contrast, see below)<b> others were broken on the wheel</b> (the case especially referred to is that of Eleazar, 2 Macc. vi. 18–end; and the<i> tympanum</i> here mentioned seems to have been an instrument like a wheel or drum-head, on which the victim was stretched and scourged to death. Josephus makes Eleazar say to Antiochus, “<i>Now then prepare thy wheel</i>”.... And in the deaths of the seven others, which are related differently from the account in 2 Macc. vii., we read of the first [4 Macc. ix. 12), “<i>they put him upon the wheel,</i>” and similarly of several of the others),<b> not accepting the deliverance</b> (offered to them: see in the deaths of the seven brethren, 2 Macc. vii. Eleazar himself says, 2 Macc. vi. 30, “<i>Whereas I might have been delivered from death, I now endure sore pain, &c.”</i>),<b> that they might obtain a better resurrection</b> (there can, I think, be little doubt that Chrysostom’s explanation of<b> better</b> is right,—better, i.e. not such as the dead of the women before mentioned. Those sons were raised by a kind of resurrection to a life which should again end in death: but these expected a glorious resurrection to endless life. See 2 Macc. vii. 9, “<i>The King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for this law, unto everlasting life:</i>” also ib. vv. 11, 14, 20, 23, 36. Hence we may perhaps understand the<b> others again</b>, distinguishing these even higher triumphs of faith from these former):<b> others again had trial of cruel mockings</b> (so the A.V. well: for the word must mean insult accompanied with cruelty, judging from its use in the place here referred to, viz. 2 Macc. vii. 7, 10. See also 1 Macc. ix. 26)<b> and of scourgings</b> (see 2 Macc. as before),<b> yea, moreover of bonds and prison</b> (so Jonathan, 1 Macc. xiii. 12. But perhaps he now speaks more e.g. of Hanani, 2 Chron. xvi. 10, Micaiah, the son of Imlah, 1 Kings xxii. 26, and Jeremiah, Jer. xxxii. 2, 3, &c.):<b> they were stoned</b> (so Zechariah, son of Jehoinda, 2 Chron, xxiv. 20–22, referred to by our Lord, Luke xi. 51, Matt. xxiii. 35, ‘There was a tradition, reported by Tertullian and other fathers, that Jeremiah was stoned at Daphne in Egypt, by the people: and perhaps the Writer refers to this also. It cannot refer still to the Maccabæan times, seeing that stoning not a Greek but purely Jewish punishment. Some imagine it to refer to Naboth, 1 Kings xxi.: but this is hardly probable),<b> they were sawn asunder</b> (the traditional death of Isaiah at the hands of king Manasseh. There seems no reason to doubt, that this tradition was known in the apostolic times: Jerome calls it a “most certain tradition among the Jews,” and mentions the general reference of these words to it by Christians. The punishment was used sometimes in the case of captives in war: see 2 Sam. xii. 31, 1 Chron. xx, 3),<b> were tempted</b> (certainly it is surprising, to meet with so mild a word in the midst of torments and ways of dreadful death. Our surprise is not much mitigated by the sense given, e.g. by Stuart, “temptations presented by persecutors to the victims of their torture, in order to induce them to forsake their religion, and worship the gods of the idolaters.” And this surprise having been all but universally felt, various have been the conjectures resorted to. Some have been for leaving out the word altogether. And other proposals have ben made, consisting of the substitution of other Greek words somewhat like this one, and bearing the sense of<i> were burned</i>, or<i> were mutilated, &c</i>. As it stands, I do not see how any appropriate meaning can be given to the mere enduring of temptation, placed as it is between being sawn asunder and dying by the sword),<b> died in the murder of the sword</b> (i. e. were slain by the sword: see reff. One prophet only perished by the sword in the kingdom of Judah, viz. Urijah, Jer. xxvi, 23: but under Israel it is said, 1 Kings xix. 10, “They [the house of Omri] have slain thy prophets with the sword.” Perhaps the Maccabæan persecutions may again be before the Writer's mind: see 2 Macc. vii. 4. Chrysostom says beautifully, “What means this? what sayest thou? Some escaped the edge of the sword, and some died in the murder of the sword? what does this mean? which praisest thou? which admirest thou? the last, or the first? Yea, he replies, both one and the other: for double are the wonders of faith: it both does great things, and it suffers great things without seeming to: suffer any thing”):
