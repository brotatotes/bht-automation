The passive signification is found Polyb. xxviii. 9. 7, πολλοὺς ἄν ἐποίησε τῆς αὐτῆς τύχης πεῖραν αὐτῷ λαβεῖν : Diod. Sic. xii. 24, τὴν θυγατέρα ἀπέκτεινεν , ἵνα μὴ τῆς ὕβρεως λάβῃ πεῖραν : Jos.

See also 1Ma 9:26 )  and of scourgings (see reff. 2 Macc.),  yea moreover (  ἔτι δέ rises in climax: so out of many examples in Bleek, Xen. Œcon. Hebrews 11:12 , ἔτι δὲ ἡ γῆ θέλουσα … διδάσκει , “and moreover the earth of herself teaches,” &c.)  of bonds and prison (so Jonathan, 1Ma 13:12 . But perhaps he now speaks more generally, e. g. of Hanani, 2 Chronicles 16:10 , Micaiah, the son of Imlah, 1 Kings 22:26 , and Jeremiah, Jer 32:2-3 al.):
