 37 b .]  they wandered about ( τὸ  περιῆλθον διώκεσθαι αὐτοὺς δηλοῖ , ἢ ἀστατεῖν . Thl.)  in sheepskins (  μηλωτή , προβάτειος δορά , Etym. Mag. But also, as Hesych., πᾶσα βύρσα , ὅ ἐστι πᾶν δέρμα , μηλωτὴ λέγεται .  μῆλον was the name for small kine, whether sheep or goats, and the μηλωτή was the skin of such kine with the hair on. The LXX (reff.) use the word for Elijah’s garment, to whom the allusion seems principally to be. Clem.-rom. ad Cor. 17, p. 241, says, μιμηταὶ γενώμεθα κἀκείνων , οἵτινες ἐν δέρμασιν αἰγείοις καὶ μηλωταῖς περιεπάτησαν , κηρύσσοντες τὴν ἔλευσιν τοῦ χριστοῦ , λέγομεν δὴ Ἡλίαν κ . Ἐλισσαῖον , ἔτι δὲ καὶ Ἰεζεκιήλ , τοὺς προφήτας . Clem.-alex. Strom. iv. 17, § 107, p. 610 P., citing this, inserts after μηλωταῖς , καὶ τριχῶν καμηλεὶων πλέγμασιν . See more particulars in Suicer, sub voce: and cf. Mat 7:15 )  and goats’ skins (this, coming after μηλωταῖς , which may mean the same, has surprised some, and has seemed to them a mere gloss on that word. But it is quoted by Clem. and Orig [67] , besides being found in all MSS. and vss. Delitzsch says that “it not only explains the former, but intensifies it: for the (commonly) black goat’s skin shewed, even more than the (commonly) white sheepskin, the deep earnestness of one thrust out from the world, and dead to it.” Perhaps: but it is more probable that the Writer regarded μηλωτή as merely the sheepskin, and mentioned the other because goats were as often kept and their skin as often worn),  destitute (reff.),  afflicted (reff.),  in misery (cf. Heb 11:25 );
