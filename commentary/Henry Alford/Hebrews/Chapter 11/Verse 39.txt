<b> 39.</b>]<b> And these all</b> ( “these, every one of them.” All, viz. all that have been named or referred to throughout the chapter: not only those<i> others</i> since ver. 35),<b> borne witness to by their faith</b> (the emphasis is on<i> being borne witness to</i>, not on<i> by their</i><i> faith:</i> and the sense is rather, “<i>though</i> borne witness to,” than “<i>being</i>” or “<i>because</i>, borne witness to”),<b> did not receive the promise</b> (many promises indeed they did receive, ver. 33: but not THE PROMISE, the promise of final salvation, or as it is called, ch. ix. 15, “<i>the promise of the eternal inheritance:</i>” the perfection, to which without us they were not to attain. “But,” says Delitzsch, “do we not read ch. vi. 15, of Abraham,<i> he obtained the promise?</i> Certainly, he has obtained the promise, yet not this side the grave, but, as we there maintained, in his life on the other side the grave: the general and actual salvation of the New Test. is, in their heavenly estate, the joy of the patriarchs. And this view is confirmed by looking forward to ch. xii., where the Old Test. believers translated into heaven are called the ‘<i>spirits of just men made perfect,</i>’ or at all events are included in that designation. And another question arises. It is said of the Old Test. saints, that they did not obtain the promise: but is it not plain, from ch. x. 36, that<i> the obtaining the promise</i> is for us also a thing future? Doubtless, but with a significant difference. For them, final salvation was a thing purely future: for us, it is a thing present as well as future: present, in that it is once for all brought about by Christ’s offering of Himself,—future, inasmuch as the unfolding of all the fulness of that which we possess, and the taking possession of it, when unfolded in its fulness, is for us yet to come: compare ch. ix, 28 with x. 14”),
