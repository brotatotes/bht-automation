<b> 4.</b>]<b> By faith</b> (see above)<b> Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice</b> (literally, more sacrifice)<b> than Cain</b> (than Cain did. But how a<b> more excellent sacrifice?</b> First, there can be no doubt that the adjective must be taken not of quantity, but of quality: it was not a more abundant, but: a more excellent. But how was it so? Our text answers us:<i> because of, by, faith.</i> The more excellence must be looked for then rather in the disposition with which the sacrifice was offered, than in the nature of the sacrifice itself. Gregory the Great [cited by Delitzsch] says well, “All that is given to God, is weighed according to the disposition of its giver: whence it is written, ‘God had regard to Abel, and to his gifts, but had uo regard to Cain and his gifts’ The Scripture docs not say, ‘He regarded the gifts of Abel, and did not regard the gifts of Cain,’ but first says, that “He regarded Abel,” and then adds, ‘and his gifts.’ So we see that it was not the gifts which made Abel to be acceptable, but Abel who made the gifts to be so.” This beyond doubt is the principal ground of the designation<b> more</b><b> excellent</b>. With regard to the sacrifices themselves; with our present knowledge of type and sacrifice, many reasons might be alleged why that of Abel should be more according to God’s will than that. of Cain; but none of those reasons can be safely or decisively applied here. That Abel's consisted of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof—the<i> first and the best</i>, whereas Cain’s was merely an offering of the fruit of the ground, perfunctory and common-place, may be a circumstance not without weight in appreciating the term<b> by faith</b>. That Abel’s was offering of slain animals, God’s own appointed way, so soon after, of the sinner’s approach to Him, whereas Cain’s was only a gift, as if he could approach God without shedding of blood,—this may also be an important element in the term<b> by faith</b>. But it would not be safe here to insist on either of these),<b> by means of which</b> (viz.<i> which faith</i>, not, which<i> sacrifice</i>:<b> by which</b> must apply to the same as<b> by it</b> below, and that surely can refer to nothing but the<i> faith</i>, which is the great leading idea of the chapter)<b> he was testified</b> (see above, ver. 2)<b> to be righteous</b> (when? by whom? not, by our Saviour, nor by St. John [1 John iii. 12), though in both places such testimony is borne to him: but as explained in the next clause, at the time of his sacrifice, and by God Himself),<b> God bearing testimony upon</b> (in regard to)<b> his gifts</b> (of what kind this testimony was, there can be little doubt. Theodotion’s rendering of the text in Genesis, “<i>and God consumed them by fire,</i>” though wrong as a rendering, is probably right in fact. Compare Exod. xiv. 24; 1 Kings xviii. 24, 28):<b> and by means of it</b> (his faith, again, not, his sacrifice: see above)<b> having died he yet speaketh</b> (viz., as interpreted by the parallel place, ch. xii. 24, where it is said of the “<i>blood of sprinkling,” that it speaketh better things than Abel</i>,—by means of his blood, of which it is said by God in Gen. iv. 10, “The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the ground.” Some have taken it in the sense of speaks to us to follow his example? And perhaps Stuart may be partly right, who recognizing the allusion to Gen. iv. 10, says, “The form of expression only in our verse seems to be borrowed from Gen. iv. 10, for here it is the<i> faith</i> of Abel which makes him speak after his death; viz. to those who should come after him, exhorting and encouraging them to follow his example.” I say<i> partly</i> right, for however this may be in the background the cry of his blood is obviously primary in the Writer’s thought, from ch. xii. 24, where the voice of Abel is contrasted with that of the Christian blood of sprinkling).
