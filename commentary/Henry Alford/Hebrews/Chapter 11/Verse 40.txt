<b> 40.</b>]<b> God having provided</b> (foreseen from afar)<b> concerning us</b> (viz. the Writer and his readers, as belonging to the New Test. church)<b> something better</b> (what is this? The Fathers generally interpret it of the ultimate state of glorious perfection, which shall only then come in, when all the number of the elect shall be accomplished. On this view, as Delitzsch says, the<b> something better</b> would consist in this, that the history of mankind has not been cut short, as it would have been if the ancients had received the promise in this sense, but has been continued for us to partake of our present privileges under the New Test. But, he continues, this narrow acceptation of the promise, as referring to the last things only, has against it not only what is said of Abraham in ch. vi. 15, that he “<i>obtained the promise,</i>” but also the whole spirit of the Epistle, which regards final salvation as brought in with the propitiation of Christ, and the “<i>end of the days</i>” as begun with His first Advent. The Writer cannot be ignoring this all-inclusive beginning of the New Test. fulfilment of the promises, in attributing to us<i> something better</i> than the Old Test. believers had. And consequently we must understand by the expression, something better than they had, viz. the enjoyment, here, of the fulfilment of the promise, which they never had here, and only have there since Christ’s descent into Hadés and ascension into Heaven. It is that “<i>something better</i>” for which the Lord felicitates his disciples, Matt. xiii. 17, the revelation of the Son of God, ch. i. 1, the “<i>salvation</i>” of ch. ii. 3),<b> that they should not apart from us be made perfect</b> (the design of God in this provision of something better for us was, that they, the Old Test. saints, should not be perfected without us, i.e. independently of the New Test. salvation of which we are partakers,—cut off from Christ’s universal Church, of which we are members. But we read, ch. xii. 23, of them as “<i>made perfect</i>” now. And therefore the Writer implies, as indeed ch. x. 14 seems to testify, that the Advent and work of Christ has changed the estate of the Old Test. Fathers and saints into great and perfect bliss; an inference which is forced on us by many other places in Scripture. So that their perfection was dependent on our perfection: their and our perfection was all brought in at the same time, when Christ “<i>by one offering perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</i>” So that the result with regard to them is, that their spirits, from the time when Christ descended into Hades and ascended up into heaven, enjoy heavenly blessedness, and are waiting, with all who have followed their glorified High Priest within the veil, for the resurrection of their bodies, the Regeneration, the renovation of all things. This thought naturally leads on to the opening verses of the next, chapter).
