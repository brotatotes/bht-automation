LXX, Genesis 5:24 , after which this verse is framed: καὶ εὐηρέστησεν Ἐνὼχ τῷ θεῷ , καὶ οὐχ εὑρίσκετο ὅτι ( ηὑρ . διότι Α ) μετέθηκεν αὐτὸν ὁ θεός .
	 μετετέθη , as in reff., by a sudden disappearance from this earth: οὐχ ηὑρίσκετο , cf. the similar expression of Livy i. 16, in relating the supposed disappearance of Romulus in the storm, “nec deinde in terris Romulus fuit.” This translation was hardly, as Calvin, “mors quædam extraordinaria,” though he means this in no rationalistic sense, as is plain from his accompanying remarks: but rather a change which passed upon him altogether without death, from corruptibility to incorruptibility, from the natural body to the spiritual. The  τοῦ μὴ ἰδεῖν is purpose and purport in one. The construction, after a sentence and in relation to it, is said by Winer, § 44. 4.  b , to be chiefly familiar, in the N. T., to St. Luke and St. Paul. See reff.),  and was not found (see above),  because God translated him. For before his translation a testimony is given to him (the perfect implies the continued existence of the testimony in the text of Scripture)  that he hath pleased God (on εὐηρ . and εὐαρ . see Winer, § 12. 3.  b . The temporal augment, usual after εὐ - and δυς -, is omitted in the κοινὴ διάλεκτος ):
