<b> 7.</b>]<i> Example of</i> NOAH. Gen. vi. 8 ff.<b> By faith Noah, having been warned</b> (viz. by God, Gen. vi. 13 ff.)<b> concerning</b><b> the things not yet seen, taking forethought</b> (many interpret this word “fearing God:” and most, “fearing;” but the distinction is important, which is brought out in ch. v. 7, where the same word occurs, that this is the fear of caution or reverence, and not of terror)<b> prepared the ark</b> (not ‘<i>an</i> ark’)<b> for the preservation of his house; by means of which</b> (to what does<b> which</b> refer? to “<i>preservation,</i>” to “<i>ark,</i>” or to “<i>faith?</i>” Certainly not to the former: for thus Noah’s<i> preservation</i> would be the inheriting of the righteousness which is by faith. Possibly, to<i> the ark</i>; for it was by the building of it that he condemned the world in its unbelief, and by it that in some sense, as the manifested result of his faith, he became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. But it must be confessed that this latter part of the interpretation halts considerably. And on this account, as well as on account of its inadequacy to the spirit of the passage, I do not hesitate, with most of the recent Commentators, to prefer “<i>faith</i>” as the antecedent: “by which faith,” as above, ver. 4. It is true, that the word faith, as last mentioned, here is somewhat far off; but it is the burden of the chapter, and continually before the Writer’s mind, and it was by his<i> faith</i>, rather than by the results of that faith, that he<i> condemned the world</i>, and became, &c.)<b> he condemned</b> (the sense may be either imperfect, he condemned, while building the ark, the unbelieving world around,—or,<i> past</i>, he once for all condemned the unbelieving then, and in them, the world, which lies in unbelief. Better perhaps the latter. On the sense, Limborch says, “He is said to<i> condemn</i> another who by his deed shews what another ought to have done, and, because he did not do it, convicts him of a fault, and shews his lability to punishment”)<b> the world</b> (so also in Matt. xii. 41, 42),<b> and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith</b> (Noah is the first in Scripture who is called “<i>righteous</i>” or “<i>just,</i>” Gen. vi. 9. See Ezek. xiv. 14, 20, where he is named together with Daniel and Job as an example of righteousness: and Wisd, x. 4, 6; Ecclus, xliv. 17; 2 Pet. ii. 5; where he is called<i> a preacher of righteousness</i>. And this righteousness, which is matter of history in the Old Test., our Writer refers to his faith as its measure. So Calvin: “Moses relates that he was righteous: that the cause and root of this righteousness was faith, is not told in the history, but is proved by the Apostle from the facts.” This<i> righteousness according to faith</i> seems to be altogether in St. Paul’s sense, the righteousness which is<i> by faith</i>, Rom. iv. 13, though the expression itself is foreign to St. Paul. The idea of its being<i> matter of inheritance</i> is also according to St. Paul. It should be noticed that the whole expression is used, in an Epistle in which righteousness by faith forms no part of the main subject, as one<i> familiar</i> and well known to the readers).
