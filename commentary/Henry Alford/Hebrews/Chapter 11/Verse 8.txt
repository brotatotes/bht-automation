<b> 8.</b>] ABRAHAM’ S<i> example</i>.<b> By faith Abraham, being called</b> (viz. by God, Gen. xii. 1 ff. Another reading, having considerable authority, is, “he that was called, named, Abraham.” And the sense thus would be very good,—whatever Bleek and Delitszch have said against it,—when we take into account the meaning of the name Abraham, a<i> father of nations</i>. That this change of name did not take place till twenty-five years after his removal from Haran, is no objection, but is just what would be the point raised: “By faith, he who was [afterwards] called Abrabam, father of nations, &c.” But on the whole, I adhere to the received text),<b> obeyed, to go out</b> (the infinitive explains<i> wherein</i> he obeyed)<b> to a</b> (or, ‘<i>the</i>’<b> place which he was hereafter to receive for an inheritance</b> (not that he was conscious even of this promise when he went out, for it was made to him afterwards in Canaan, see Gen. xii. 7);<b> and went out, not knowing whither he was going</b> (coming).
