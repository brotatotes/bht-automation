<b> 1.</b>]<b> Wherefore</b> (the word used is one of earnest and solemn inference;— “these things then being so...”)<b> we also</b> (as well as those just enumerated),<b> having so great a cloud</b> (see below)<b> of witnesses surrounding us</b> (in order to understand this aright, we must bear in mind both the similitude here used, and the connexion with the preceding chapter. “This verse is altogether made up of words derived from the games,” says Hammond. And this being so, who can help referring this cloud of witnesses which surrounds us to the scene in the games which is depicted, and regarding them as lookers on while our race is run? Whoever denies such reference, misses, it seems to me, the very point of the sense. But even thus we have not exhausted the meaning of the word<b> witnesses</b>. It is improbable, as Delitzsch well observes, that: the Writer should have used the word “<i>witnesses</i>” so closely upon “<i>borne witness to,</i>” ch. xi, 39, without any reference to that idea. See also ib. vv. 2, 4, 5, So that we can hardly help giving to ‘witnesses’ a sense not confined to their” looking on upon us, but extending to their ethical condition of witnesses for the faith. But we may notice, that Delitzsch in contending for this double sense, has in fact a triple reference of the word to justify: they are<i> borne witness</i> to, they have their<i> testimony</i>, ch. xi, 5: and by this they become<i> witnesses</i>: and they carry out that office in being witnesses “of our conflict here below. And now the propriety of the other words used at once appears.<b> cloud</b>, not only an immense multitude, and that number as it were pressing us all around as the spectators did the combatants in the circus—but also fitly compared to a cloud from the fact of its being<i> above us</i>, they looking on from that heavenly bliss which they entered at Christ’s triumph. So that the words must be taken as distinctly so far implying community between the church triumphant and the church below, that they who have entered into heavenly rest are conscious of what passes among ourselves. Any interpretation short of this leaves the exhortation here tame and without point. If they are merely quasi-witnesses, merely witnesses in a metaphor, the motive, as far as this clause supplies one, is gone. The best note on the whole idea and imagery is that of Schlichting: “He introduces us as it were into an immense theatre, where a vast crowd of spectators has assembled, which fills all the benches and spaces, seeming like a dense cloud poured around those contending in the middle. Before the eyes of such a multitude, and so many spectators, he represents us contending. Now as of old such a multitude of spectators added courage to the combatants, and was a great stimulus to use every effort for victory: so to us also, so many witnesses, who also themselves have toiled in the same conflict, ought to add alacrity, and cause us to run with all our force the race which we have begun. And he calls them<i> witnesses</i>, not only in a figure, allusive to the spectators of a contest, as we have said, who are witnesses of the prowess of those who contend; but, and much more, because they witness concerning God and His goodness and justice, and all as with one mouth declare that God is, and is a rewarder of those who seek Him: that with Him, as the Chief Lord of the games, there is laid up a prize for earnest contenders: that He is true in His promises; that even after death He can render those happy who for His sake have given their lives. For, thirdly, they are specially to be understood in this place by the name, who by their blood, witness to the faithfulness and goodness of God. Whence they are par excellence called<i> martyrs</i>, i.e. witnesses”),
