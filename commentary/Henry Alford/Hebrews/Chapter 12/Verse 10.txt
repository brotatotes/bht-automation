<b> 10.</b>] The argument from the stronger consideration is strengthened, by ing out the difference between the two chastisements as to their<i> character</i>.<b> For they indeed</b> (our earthly parts)<b> for a few days</b> (see the meaning below)<b> chastised us after their own pleasure</b> (according to that which seemed good to them: their standard and rule of action in the matter was at best their own view of what was right, and too often their own caprice or temper);<b> but He in order to that which is profitable, in order to our partaking of His holiness</b> (the becoming partakers of God’s holiness is manifestly to be taken subjectively: becoming holy like Him). Two questions arise regarding this verse, 1) what is the intended reference of<b> for a few days</b>? 2) What are the clauses opposed to one another? The former of these questions in fact involves the latter.<b> for a few days</b> has been understood by many of the<i> duration of our natural life</i>, as the term to which the chastisement of our natural parents had reference, whereas that of our heavenly Father regarded eternity. But this cannot be the meaning of the Writer. For in the first place it is not true that all earthly correction had regard only to the present life. And in the next, there is not one word in the latter clause expressing the eternal nature of God’s purpose, which surely there would have been. The other interpretation, ‘during and in reference to the time of our being subject to their chastisement,’ is certainly the right one. Then we come to the second question, how the antitheses are to be arranged. Some lave thought that “<i>for a few days</i>” is to be supplied in the second member of the sentence also: seeing that the divine chastisement, like the human, lasts for a few days only, i.e. for the term of this time of trial. Others again would supply in the second member some<i> contrast</i> to the terin “<i>for a few days.</i>” Surely the true antithesis is that pointed out by the order of the clauses themselves, and by their correspondence: 1) “<i>for a few days,</i>” and “<i>for our profit,</i>” 2) “<i>after their pleasure,</i>” and “<i>that we may be partakers of his holiness.</i>” In 1), we have set over against one another,—the short time during which, the temporary reference with which, their chastisement was inflicted,—and the great purpose implied as eternal from its very expression as<i> that</i><i> which is profitable</i> for an immortal being, for which He chastises us: and in 2). are opposed,—their purpose and standard of action, to satisfy their own seeming, be it good or bad,—and His purpose, to make us partakers of His holiness, which holiness, absolute and pure, is His rule of acting, and no mere pleasure of His own. Thus all is straightforward, and no clause need be supplied.
