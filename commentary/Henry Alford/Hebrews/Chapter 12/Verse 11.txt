<b> 11.</b>] Recurrence to the common ground of ver. 8, in describing the attribute of<i> all chastisement</i>, divine as well as human. In asserting what he does of<i> all chastisement</i>, the Writer lets fall out of view the capricious nature and uncertain result of human chastisement, and regards it more as a type and representative of that which is divine:—all chastisement, properly so called, and answering its proper purpose. This is brought ont in the second clause: the first is equally true ot every sort of<i> chastisement</i>. Now (introducing an axiom to which all will assent)<b> all chastisement for</b> ( ‘during and in respect of”)<b> the time present seems</b> (the<i> reality</i>, as Chrysostom remarks, being otherwise)<b> not to be matter of joy, but of grief: but afterwards it yields peaceable fruit of righteousness</b> (the genitive is one of apposition; the righteousness is the fruit, the<i> chastisement</i> being the tree. The words are sometimes otherwise taken, making righteousness that which yields the fruit. But seeing that chastisement<i> yields fruit</i>, it must be its own fruit, and not that belonging to righteousness, that it yields. And this fruit, thus considered, is the practical righteousness which springs, from faith, not the forensic righteousness which comes by faith [as in Rom, v. 1]. And this fruit is called<i> peaceful,</i> in contrast to the<i> contest</i> by which it is won: it is, as Tholuck expresses it, “fruit of righteousness to be enjoyed in peace after the conflict”).<b> to those who have been exercised by it</b> (viz.<i> chastisement</i>. The word<b> exercised</b> is a clear reference to the conflict alluded to in the former verses).
