<b> 13.</b>]<b> and make straight tracks for your feet</b> (these words are quoted in substance from Prov. iv. 26. In the Septuagint the A.V. has “ponder the paths of thy feet.” The word means properly the mark left by the<i> wheel</i>, the rut or wheel-mark, indicating a track or road. The meaning seems to be, Let your walk be so firm and so unanimous in the right direction, that a plain track and highway may be thereby established for those who accompany and follow you to perceive and walk in. Compare Isa. xxxv. 8),<b> that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed</b> ( “<i>that which is lame,</i>” indicates that part of the church which was wavering between Christianity and Judaism: answering to the “<i>weak</i>” of the Epistle to the Romans. If the whole congregation, by their united and consistent walk, trod a plain and beaten path for men’s feet, these lame ones, though halting, would be easily able to keep in it, and by keeping in the<i> straight</i><i> track</i>, would even acquire the habit of walking straight onward, and so be healed: but if the tracks were errant and confused, their erratic steps would deviate more and more, till at length they fell away out of the right way altogether. It should be noticed that the Writer has still the image of a race before him. The making a beaten track for all is, that they may not miss the way and lose the prize).
