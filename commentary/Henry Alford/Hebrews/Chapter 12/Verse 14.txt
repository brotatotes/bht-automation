<b> 14.</b>]<b> Follow peace with all</b> (<b>with all</b> belongs to<b> peace</b>, not to the verb, Some have understood<b> all</b> to refer not only to the brethren, but to unbelievers also. But thus taken, the exhortation would lose much of its proper force here. For it is introduced by a caution that the lame be not turned out of the way, and followed by taking heed that none of the grace of God: and between these two an exhortation to follow peace with all mankind would come in very flat and disjointed. It is clearly the brethren who are here meant by<b> all</b>. The sentiment thus is the me as in Rom. xiv. 19),<b> and sanctification</b> (<i>holiness</i> is not<b> sanctification</b>, but the putting on of it and becoming<i> holy</i>. Many Commentators, misled by the peculiar contextual reference of the word in 1 Thess. iv. 3, have restricted the meaning here to<i> chastity</i>. But the wider meaning, as a rule, must always be kept where the context does not require a narrower. And thus understood, the reference of it is well given by Limboreh: “That they should not, while anxious for peace, by too great wish to please others, commit any fault against Christian holiness”),<b> without</b> (apart from)<b> which none shall see the Lord</b> (whether<b> the Lord</b> is to be applied to Christ, or to the Father, is uncertain. It is clearly the Father in ch. viii. 2: as clearly the Son in ch. ii. 3. But here it would seem that the Father is intended. For we know, Matt. xxiv. 30; Rev. i. 7, that every eye shall see the Son, even in His glory: whereas we have our Lord using, in an ethical sentence not much unlike this one, the expression “<i>they shall see God</i>”):<b> looking well lest any one falling short of the grace of God</b> (see on ch. iv. 1. The whole sentence is imitated from Deut. xxix. 18: and the sense passes on to the verb<b> trouble</b><b> you</b> below),—<b>lest any root of bitterness</b> (not the same as “<i>bitter root,</i>” but<i> bitterness</i> is the origin and the ingrained character of the root, not its mere attribute. So Chrysostom well, “He says not, ‘<i>bitter,</i>’ but, of<b> bitterness</b>. For a bitter root might bring forth sweet fruit, but a root and fount and foundation of bitterness can never bear sweet fruit: for all things are bitter, it has nothing sweet; all is bitter, all is unsweet, all is full of hate and abomination”)<b> springing up,—trouble you, and by its means the many</b> (the whole congregation: see Gal. v. 9 quoted below)<b> be polluted</b> (how? by intercourse, by compromise, by over-persuasion, by imitation. The kind of pollution he explains in the next verse to arise from fornication and profanity);<b> lest</b> (<b>there be</b>)<b> any fornicator</b> (to be taken literally, not as alluding to spiritual fornication, see Deut. xxxi. 16; Exod. xxxiv. 15 f.: for as Delitzsch observes, this sense is foreign to the New Test., except in the Apocalypse: and it is very unlikely that the Writer should have used a meaning lying so far from the context, and not suggested either by the passage of Deut. to which he was before alluding, or by the history of Esau which he is now introducing. Nearly connected with the question of the scuse of<b> fornicator</b>, is that of the punctuation: whether by a comma after it we are to sever it from connexion with Esau, or not. Most Commentators join it with what follows: and explain it partly of the gluttony of Esau, partly of his having wedded strange women, partly by the character of a fornicator which is given him by later Jewish tradition. But others divide the word<i> fornicator</i> from what follows. It seems hardly possible to decide. The character of Esau, from Scripture as well as tradition, will very well hear the designation<i> fornicator</i>: and the balance of the sentence is better preserved by applying both to him, than by leaving the word<i> fornicator</i> insulated),<b> or profane person</b> (a mun of low views, who has no appreciation of any high or divine thing),<b> as Esau, who for one meal sold his own birthrigh</b> t (the reflexive<b> his own</b>, which must be read, may seem to be superfluous; but it serves to intensify the unworthiness of the act).
