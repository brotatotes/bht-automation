<b> 17.</b>]<b> For</b> (gives a reason for the caution, from the terrible result in Esau’s case)<b> ye know</b> (it was a fact of which no Hebrew could be ignorant)<b> that when he afterward on his part</b> (<i>he</i> dishonoured his inheritance, but was in his turn rejected from the blessing)<b> wished to inherit the blessing, he was rejected</b> (some supply<i> by God</i>, some<i> by his father</i>. But there is no reason why both should not be joined. His father's blessing was God’s blessing; his father’s rejection was God’s rejection):<b> for he found not place of repentance</b> (<i>whose</i> repentance,<i> his own</i>, or<i> his father’s</i>? The former is held by all the Greek expositors: by Luther, Calvin, and many others. The latter, by Beza, and most of the moderns. But the former I believe to be the only admissible sense. It is no mean argument for it, that the Fathers thought not of the other, though it would have been so useful to them in the Novatian controversy. Theodore of Mopsuestia, though he wrests the passage from those who wished<i> to preclude</i><i> repentance</i>, never hints at any other meaning. And thus referred to Esau himself, it will mean, that he found no way open to reverse what hud been done, by repentance: the sin had been committed and the consequence entailed, irrevocably. He might change, but the penalty could not, from the very nature of the circumstances, be taken off. So that<i> repentance</i>, in its full sense, had no<i> place</i>. And such is the meaning of<i> a place for repentance</i>, wherever occurring. We do not mean by it an opportunity to repent in a man’s own bosom, to be sorry for what he has done, for this may be under any circumstances, and this might have been with Esau: but we mean,<i> a chance, by repenting, to repair</i>. So when a condemned criminal has a<i> place for repentance</i> allowed him, we do not mean that he may die penitent, but that he is reprieved. I see not how else to understand this, and what follows: and thus understood nothing can be plainer),<b> although he earnestly sought it</b> (<i>what? not the blessing</i>, as many think, for this would be, as Ebrard characterizes it, most unnatural, the antecedent being thus separated from the pronoun “<i>it</i>” by a whole intervening clause, which will not hear parenthesizing..... Regarding<b> repentance</b> then as the only admissible antecedent for<b> it</b>, the explanation will be very simple.<i> Place for repentance is</i>, in fact,<i> repentance</i>. He found no place for<i> repentance</i>: if he bad found one,<i> repentance</i> would have been secured: this was what he sought)<b> with tears</b> (Gen. xxvii. 38. It is obvious, that our passage, rightly understood, cannot by any means favour the exclusion of any sinner from repentance. Tn Esiu’s case the<i> place for repentance</i> was closed, by circumstances themselves: the blessing had been given and could not be recalled. And this is our warning. It may be so, in many cases, with us. That it is always so, is not even hinted: but warning is given us that a path is not safe where even such a possibility may be encountered.
