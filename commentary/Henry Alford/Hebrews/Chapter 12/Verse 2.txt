<b> 2.</b>]<b> looking unto</b> (so A.V. very exactly. There does not appear to be in the word here used any intimation of looking<i> off from every thing else unto</i>, as sometimes asserted)<b> the Leader</b> (one who precedes others by his example, they following him. But see note on ch. ii, 10.<i> Author</i> seems the best English word here, as there)<b> and Perfecter</b> (this is variously interpreted. The most likely meaning is that H<i> e perfected the faith</i>, inasmuch as He perfected faith in his own person and example:<i> but He perfected the faith</i> also, inasmuch as He became the Author of perfect salvation to them that obey Him. His going before us in faith has made faith possible for us: His perfecting faith in his own person and example, has made faith effectual tor us)<b> of the faith</b> (viz. that faith of which we have been speaking through ch. xi.: and thus rather “<i>the faith</i>” than “<i>our faith,</i>” which latter is liable to the mistake so often made in English, viz. to being taken us if it meant<i> faith in us</i>, so that Jesus should be said to be “author and finisher” of each individual Christian’s faith which he has within him. The word here may be rendered merely “faith” without the article; but it would seem most probable that the article here used in the original, whereas it was not throughout ch. xi., is intended to have a definite force. Besides which, the ascription of faith to our Lord is so plain in our Epistle, compare ch. ii. 13; iii. 2, that we must not seem to exclude this sense in our rendering, which we certainly do by “<i>our faith:</i>” whereas “<i>the faith</i>” includes both, and satisfies that which follows, in which His own example of endurance in prospect of triumph is set before us), [<b>even</b>]<b> Jesus, who for</b> (literally,<b> instead of</b>: see below)<b> the joy set before Him</b> (the words of the original thus rendered have been otherwise interpreted both by ancients and moderns, The ancient Syriac version, Beza, and others, take it to mean, “<i>instead of the joy which He had before His incarnation.</i>” But this, though not an incorrect<i> rendering</i>, seems to me doubly objectionable. First, which many have noticed,<i> joy</i> which He already had could not well be designated as<i> set before Him</i>: and then, which I have not seen noticed, the term<b> joy</b> can hardly be used of a state of bliss in which one already is, a quiescent or pre-existent joy, but more naturally applies to joy prompted by some cause of active rejoicing. Then another modification of this same view is found in Chrysostom, viz., that the preferable alternative of escaping the cross was before Him, and He might have taken it, if He would. And so Luther, Calvin, and others. But this again, though it might satisfy the “<i>set before Him,</i>” falls short of the above sense maintained for<i> joy</i>. Erasmus and others explain it, that He<i> despised the joys of this life</i>. This makes<b> joy</b> identical with<i> pleasure</i>, besides giving a low and unworthy sense to the joy<i> set before Him</i>, in making it to mean the pleasures of this life. The sense given above, “for the joy set before Him,” i.e. as in comparison with, as in exchange for, the joy which was to come after in the day of His triumph, is adopted by most Commentators,
