 20 .]  for they could not bear that which was commanded (Œc. and Thl. take this as an independent sentence, said of the general fearful character of the commands: τουτέστι τὸ διαλαλούμενον παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ οὐκ ἠδύναντο τοῖς ὠσὶ στέγειν ὡς φοβερόν . And so Schlichting. But this would be exceedingly harsh, and finds no justification in the reason assigned by Schlichting, viz. that thus “sequentia verba tanquam per se posita, ad exaggerandum magis spectaculi illius terrorem pertinebunt.” It is manifest, from the retention of the future λιθοβοληθήσεται , that the words are a citation, and this clause the introduction of it. But among those who agree thus far, there is another wide difference about the  voice of the participle, as to whether διαστελλόμενον is middle or passive. Storr, Heinrichs, Schulz, Delitzsch, take it middle, in an active sense, “that which ordered:” viz. the divine voice. But surely this is, if admissible grammatically (see Mark 7:36 ; Mark 8:15 , where only διεστέλλετο is found, all the other cases having the 1 aor. διαστείλασθαι , which stands on its own ground), yet contextually most improbable: 1. that God, or the voice of God, should be thus described by a neuter part.: 2. that with τὸ φανταζόμενον just below, in strict parallelism, τὸ διαστελλόμενον should signify any thing but that which was commanded),  Even if a beast (much more if a man)  touch the mountain, it shall be stoned (an abbreviation of Exodus 19:12-13 , καὶ ἀφοριεῖς τὸν λαὸν κύκλῳ , λέγων , Προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς τοῦ ἀναβῆναι εἰς τὸ ὄρος καὶ θιγεῖν τι αὐτοῦ · πᾶς ὁ ἁψάμενος τοῦ ὄρους θανάτῳ τελευτήσει . οὐχ ἅψεται αὐτοῦ χείρ · ἐν γὰρ λίθοις λιθοβοληθήσεται ἢ βολίδι κατατοξευθήσεται · ἐάν τε κτῆνος ἐάν τε ἄνθρωπος , οὐ ζήσεται ):
