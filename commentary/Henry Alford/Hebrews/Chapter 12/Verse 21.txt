<p><strong> 21</strong> .] <strong> and</strong> (this clause is diversely punctuated. Before Beza, there was no comma at καί , and the sense was read straight on, “and so terrible was the sight, (that) Moses said,” as in E. V. So the Fathers: so some MSS. of the vulg. So Mill, Bengel, Michaelis, and Lachmann. And thus, as Bl. well observes, should we have punctuated in an Epistle of St. Paul, who is full of these broken constructions. But nothing can be more different than the style of this Epistle, which is weighed and rhetorically balanced with constant care. There can be little doubt in any who take this style into account, that the punctuation which began with Beza is right, viz. the setting a comma at καί , and regarding οὕτως φοβ . ἦν τὸ φαντ . as a parenthesis. <strong> καί</strong> must not, with Carpzov, Cramer, al., be taken for “ <em> even</em> ,” for thus we should have an asyndeton: and it is too far separated from Μωυσῆς ), <strong> so fearful was that which was revealed</strong> (which appeared to them as a vision of the glory and majesty of Jehovah: φανταζόμενον δ ʼ εἶπεν , ἐπειδὴ οὐκ αὐτὸν ἑώρων τὸν τῶν ὅλων θεόν , ἀλλά τινα φαντασίαν τῆς θείας ἐπιφανείας , Thdrt.), <strong> Moses said, I am in great terror and in trembling</strong> (no such saying of Moses at this time is to be found in the sacred narrative.

Some have supposed that the saying is taken from some tradition: but none has been found to justify the idea. Others, as Calvin, suppose that “hæc communis totius populi querimonia; sed Moses inducitur, qui fuit veluti commune os omnium.” But if so, where would be any climax, as there manifestly is in this verse?):</p>
