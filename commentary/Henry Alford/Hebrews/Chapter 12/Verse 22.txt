So that Chrys. misses the mark, when he says, ἐκεῖνοι οὐ προσῆλθον , ἀλλὰ πόῤῥωθεν εἱστήκεισαν , καὶ ὁ Μωυσῆς · ὑμεῖς δὲ προσεληλύθατε : and Thl., when he adds, ὁρᾷς τὴν ὑπεροχήν ) <strong> to Mount Sion</strong> (here at length <strong> ὄρει</strong> is expressed: see above. Böhme and Kuinoel would take the following <strong> ἐπουρανίῳ</strong> as an epithet belonging to all three, ὄρει , πόλει , and Ἱερουσαλήμ : and so apparently did Œc.: ἀντὶ τοῦ Σινᾶ ὄρους , φησί , ἐνταῦθά ἐστιν , ὁ οὐρανός · τοῦτον γὰρ καλεῖ Σιὼν ὄρος καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ . ὅθεν ἐπάγει ἐπουρανίῳ . But the form of the sentence will not allow this. Mount Sion, the abode of God which He loved and where He will abide continually, is used to signify, not its mere representative, which men know by that name, but the reality, God’s own abode in heaven. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:68">Psalms 78:68</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:2">Psalms 110:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+132:13">Psalms 132:13</span> ff.: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:2">Isaiah 2:2</span> f.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:32">Joel 2:32</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mic+4:1">Micah 4:1</span> f.: Oba 1:17 al. And so Thl., ἀντὶ τοῦ Σινᾶ ἔχομεν Σιὼν ὄρος νοητὸν καὶ πόλιν νοητὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ , τουτέστιν αὐτὸν τὸν οὐρανόν . See Delitzsch’s long note) <strong> and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem</strong> (as the earthly Jerusalem, situate on Mount Sion, was the πόλις τοῦ μεγάλου βασιλέως , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:35">Matthew 5:35</span> , so in a more blessed sense is that heavenly city the city of the living God. He is its maker and builder, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:10">Hebrews 11:10</span> ; nor only so, but also evermore dwells in it with the light of His presence, cf. Rev 21:22-24 ):</p>
