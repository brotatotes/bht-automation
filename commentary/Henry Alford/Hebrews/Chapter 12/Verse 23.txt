<b> 23.</b>] The difficult question of the punctuation has been dealt with in my Greek Testament. The matter would be unintelligible to the English reader. It is enough to say that the Writer begins with the<b> innumerable company</b> (literally<b> myriads</b>), in order afterwards to say of what these myriads consist. Adopting then this-ngement, the verse will stand,—<b>and to myriads</b> (the word is commonly used of the angelic company surrounding Jehovah),<b> the festal host</b> (so the word imports)<b> of angels, and the assembly of the firstborn which are written in heaven</b> (who are these? Why are they put with the angels? Why does the Writer place<b> God the Judge of all</b> between the assembly of the firstborn and the spirits of just men made perfect? These, says Delitzsch, are three closely connected questions, and among the very hardest in our Epistle. The answers to them are very various, Many understand<b> the assembly of the firstborn</b> of the firstfruits of the Christian church (Rey. xiv. 4): so De Wette, “those who are fallen asleep in the faith of Christ, and possibly also glorified by martyrdom, who have entered earlier than others, as it were the firstborn, into blissful union with God and Christ.” As Delitzsch observes, if we hold them to be martyrs, the following words,<b> and to God the Judge of all</b>, might have a certain propriety from Rev. vi. 9 f., where the souls of the martyrs under the altar cry, “<i>How long.... dost thou not</i><b> judge</b><i> and avenge our blood, &c.?</i>” But this view seems altogether to fail when we attempt to explain by it the words,<b> written in heaven</b>. Those of whom our Lord says, Luke x. 20, “<i>Rejoice, because your names are written in heaven,</i>” are<i> yet living on earth</i>. According to St. Luke’s manner of speaking, the firstborn are hereby designated as enrolled (in Luke ii. 1, 3, 5, he uses the word here rendered “<i>written</i>” for enrolling in the census) in the heavenly roll: and Scripture usage seems to demand that we consider one thus described, as not yet in possession of everlasting life in the fullest sense, but as destined to life [see Acts xiii. 48]. This would forbid us from thinking of the 141, 000 whom St. John saw with the Lamb on the heavenly Zion, who bore on their foreheads the name of the Lamb and of the Father. For this sealing was among the insignia of their eternal glorification: whereas the being enrolled in the book of life is the token to us, while here below, of our heavenly citizenship, and seems to lose all its significance, as soon as we have entered the heavenly city and need no assurance of our citizenship either for ourselves or for others. So that though we are tempted, both by the fact of their being classed with the angels, and by their being<i> firstborn</i> (so we have “<i>firstfruits from</i><i> among men,</i>” Rev. xiv. 4), to identify these with the<i> thousands</i> seen by St. John, we must give up the parallel, these<i> persons written in heaven</i> being not yet citizens of heaven who have taken up their fall citizenship by passing through death, but persons to whom their citizenship is assured, they being as yet here below. Add to which, that they are distinguished from the spirits of just men made perfect, by the term<b> assembly</b> or<b> chureh</b> [<i>ecclesia</i>]: and that it would he difficult or rather impossible, on this hypothesis, to give any account of the sense or arrangement of the two following clauses. Just as inadmissible is it, or even more so, to understand by the firstborn the patriarchs and saints of the Old Test., and then by<b> spirits of just men made perfect</b>, not the Old Test. but the New Test. saints. So that, to say nothing of other varieties of interpretation not worth mentioning, there is no way left but to see, in the words,<i> the assembly of the firstborn written in heaven</i>, THE CHURCH BELOW. And this view, far from being a last refuge, is justified by every consideration. For 1) thus<i> ecclesia</i> is explained, which every where, when used of men and not of angels, Ps, lxxxix. 5, designates the assembly of saints on earth: 2) the adjunct<i> written in heaven</i> is accounted for, indicating as it does the heavenly charter of the church below, the invisible side of their sonship and citizenship (see 1 John iii. 2), with which in this description of heaven we are mainly concerned: 3) we get an explanation of the choice of the term<i> firstborn</i> to describe Christian believers. The Writer having given the warning example of Esau, who for a morsel of meat sold his birthright, has prepared the way for such a designation, while at the same time, as Knapp rightly remarks, the long sentence beginning at ver. 18 aims at this “that Christians may be defended against unbelief, and may learn to know their rights of inheritance.” There is no distinction between first-born and later-born Christians, but all Christians as such are called firstborn because of their heritorship of the heavenly inheritance. We may also remark that thus the analogy with the firstborn of Israel is completely fulfilled. They were dedicated to God specially as his priests (Exod. xiii. 1, 2, 11–15), and royal succession was in the firstborn: so that in the word<i> firstborn</i> we have that which St. John says: “He made as a kingdom, priests to God and His Father.” This primogeniture, which belonged to Israel as such (Exod. iv. 22), belongs to Christians as such, and to every one of them: they are enrolled not merely in an earthly register, Num. iii, 42, but in the book of life in heaven. We also thus 4) obtain an explanation of the juxtaposition in the sentence of the myriads of angels and the myriads of the firstborn: the key to it being found in ch. i. 14, where God is said to have apportioned the angels as<i> ministering spirits</i> to minister to the<i> heirs of salvation</i>. Thus we have the heavenly spirits and the firstborn whose names are in heaven, the jubilant choir above and the militant church below, ranged together. But 5) we also get, what we find on no other hypothesis, an explanation of the sequence of<b> God the judge of all</b> on<i> the assembly of the firstborn</i>, and of that of<b> spirits of just men. made perfect</b> on<i> God the judge of all</i>. The key to the words is in ch. x. 30, “<i>The Lord shall judge His people.</i>” The church militant here below brings to mind those enemies and persecutors, for deliverance and righting from whom she looks to the righteous judgment of God. And he who is in fellowship (1 John i. 7) with the great Judge has no judgment to fear, but is<i> justified</i>; thereby leading on to the “<i>spirits of just men made perfect</i>” which follows),<b> and to God the Judge of all</b> (this clause comes between the mention of the elect, written in heaven, and the spirits of the<i> just</i>, shewing that the<i> enrolment in heaven</i> is no arbitrary selection,—the<i> justification</i> no unreasonable procedure. It is not probable that the Writer may have had in view Abraham’s question Gen. xviii. 25, “Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?” Some Commentators understand this, “<i>God, the Judge of all,</i>” of Christ: but it is a characteristic of this Epistle that all judgment is formally, and in words, referred to God the Father: see ch. iv. 11 f., x. 30 f.: ver. 29: ch. xiii. 4),<b> and to the spirits of just men who have been perfected</b> (i. e. the whole number of the just who have passed into their rest, from righteous Abel downwards; not yet absolutely called “<i>just men made perfect,</i>” because they are as yet disembodied and awaiting the resurrection, but “<i>the spirits of just men made perfect.</i>” This m<i> aking perfect</i> has been through sufferings, through trials, through running and having ended their race. All is accomplished, their probation, their righteousness, God’s purposes respecting them. They are not sleeping, they are not unconscious, they are not absent from us: they are perfected, lacking nothing, except, and that is our defect because we are as yet imprisoned in an unspiritual body, communion with us: their spirits are perfect, and therefore not suspended from the spirit life, but waiting only for bodily perfection also),<b> and to the mediator ot the latter covenant, Jesus</b> (the mention of the<i> just made perfect</i> at once introduces that of Him who was Himself<i> made perfect</i>, ch. ii. 10, and who is the<i> perfecter of the faith</i>, ver. 2. See ch. vii, 22. Our Writer especially loves to use the name JESUS. To<i> Christ</i>, all that is predicated of our Lord belonged officially: but when it is predicated of Jesus, it becomes personal fact, realized in one whom we know and who loves us, That Christ is the mediator of the new covenant, is a theological truth: that Jesus is, is a glorious token of God’s love manifested to us men),<b> and to the blood of sprinkling</b> (naturally following on the mention of<i> the covenant</i>, for no<i> covenant</i> is consecrated without blood, ch. ix. 18, 22. And if Moses had blood wherewith to sprinkle the people, much more Jesus, of whom Moses was a shadow. And therefore the Writer, enumerating the great differences of our Sion from their Sinai, though he has not recounted their blood of sprinkling, as not being worthy of mention in the face of the terrors of God’s law, mentions ours, by which we were redeemed unto God, and assigns it a place in the heavenly city, next to, but separate from, Jesus Himself in His glorified state. If we come to enquire how this can be, we enter on an interesting but high and difficult subject, on which learned and holy men have been much divided. Our Lord’s Blood was shed from Him on the Cross. And as His Body did not see corruption, it is obvious to suppose, that His Blood did not corrupt as that of ordinary men, being as it is so important a portion of the body. Hence, and because His resurrection Body seems to have been bloodless,—see Luke xxiv, 32; John xx. 27, and notes,—some have supposed that the Blood of the Lord remains, as it was poured ont, incorruptible, in the presence of God. On such a matter I would neither affirm nor deny, but mention, with all reverence, that which seems to suit the requirements of the words before us. By that Blood we live, wherever it is: but as here it is mentioned separately from the Lord Himself, as an item in the glories of the heavenly city, and as “yet speaking,” it seems to require some such view to account for the words used. Bengel has here a long excursus on the point, in which he takes strongly the above view. Chrysostom also seems to have done so. The blood of Christ is called “<i>the blood</i><b> of sprinkling</b>,” inasmuch as, like that sacrificial blood of old materially, it is spiritually sprinkled on the conscience of those who come unto God by Him, compare ch. ix. 13 ff.; x. 22; xiii. 12)<b> speaking better</b> (adverbially; as in 1 Cor. vii. 38,<i> doing better</i> is opposed to<i> doing well</i>. And the adverb refers not to the<i> manner</i> of the speaking, but to the matter spoken; so that “<i>better things</i>” in the English expresses well the meaning)<b> than Abel</b> (not, “<i>than that of Abel:</i>” for in ch. xi. 4, it is Abel himself who speaks, in his blood: see note there).
