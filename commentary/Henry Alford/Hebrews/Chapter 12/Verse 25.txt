<b> 25.</b>] This voice of the blood of sprinkling, just mentioned, leads naturally to the<i> caution not to despise that voice, nor put it by as they of old did the “voice of words” from Sinai.</i><b> Take heed that ye decline not</b> (see above on ver. 19)<b> him that speaketh</b> (i. e, God in Christ, see below).<b> For if they did not escape</b> (how? in one of two senses: either 1) they did not escape hearing the voice on account of this their<i> refusal</i>: or 2) which seems more probable, they did not escape God's vengeance in punishment: the Writer taking this their<i> refusal</i> of the divine voice as a sort of sample of their disobedient and unbelieving spirit),<b> declining as they did</b> (not ‘<i>who refused</i>’)<b> him who spoke on earth</b> (on Mount Sinai),<b> much more we</b> (<b>shall not escape</b>),<b> who are turning away from him</b> (who<i> speaks</i>)<b> from</b> (<b>the</b>)<b> heavens:</b>—We now come to the somewhat difficult question, the answer to which we have taken for granted in the rendering of this verse: viz., who are intended by the various objects, “<i>him that speaketh,</i>”— “<i>him that speaketh on earth,</i>”— “<i>him from heaven.</i>” Let us take the second of these first, as furnishing the key to the others. “Whom does he mean (says Chrysostom)? It seems to me, Moses.” But this cannot well be. For the participle<b> refusing</b>, manifestly refers baek to ver. 19: where it was not Moses, but God, whom they<i> refused</i>. It must be laid down then as certain, that<b> he that speaketh on earth</b> is God. Then if so, who is<b> he from heaven</b>, or in other words who is<b> he that speaketh</b>, for these two are manifestly the same? Clearly, not Jesus: for by the words<b> whose voice</b>, which follow, the voice of this same speaker shook the earth at the giving of the law: and it can by no ingenuity be pretended, that the terrors of the law proceeded from the Son of God; especially in the face of the contrast drawn here, and in ch. ii. 2 ff. And it would be against all accuracy and decorum in divine things, to pass from the speaking of the God of Israel to that of our Lord Jesus Christ in the way of climax as is here done, with “much more shall we not escape.” Add to which, that, if Christ is to be understood as the subject of vv. 26 ff., we shall have Him uttering the prophetic words, “<i>yet once more, &c.;</i>” whereas both from our Writer’s habit of quoting prophecy [compare ch. i. 1; iv. 7; vi. 13; viii. 8; xi, 11], and from the context of the prophecy itself, they must be attributed to the Father. How then are these difficulties to be got over? Simply by taking above, the speaker in both cases to be GOD: in the first, as speaking from Mount Sinai by His Angels: in the second, as speaking from His heavenly throne through His exalted Son. Thus it is true we lie open to one objection, viz. that the giving of the law is ever regarded in the Old Test. as a speaking from heaven: so Exod. xx. 22; Deut. iv. 36; Neh. ix. 13. But this objection, though at first sight weighty, is by no means decisive. The “<i>heaven</i>” spoken of there is surely nothing but the material heaven, as apparent to the Israelites in the clouds and darkness which rested on Sinai, and totally distinct from the “<i>heaven</i>” here, the site of our blessed Lord’s glorification, who is spoken of, ch. iv. 14, as “<i>having passed through the heavens.</i>” Thus the words have been explained from early times.
