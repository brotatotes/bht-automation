<b> 26.</b>]<b> whose voice</b> (see on last verse)<b> shook the earth then</b> (so in Judg. v. 5, in Deborah’s Song, “<i>The earth trembled; the mountains melted from before the Lord, even that Sinai from before the God of Israel.</i>” See also Ps. cxiv. 7. In Exod. xix. 18, where the A.V. has, after the Hebrew, “the whole mount quaked greatly,”—the Septuagint render, “<i>The whole people was much astonished</i>.” Some take this shaking of the earth to be meant of a figurative excitement of men’s minds. But there can be little doubt, that the material explanation is the true one):<b> but now</b> (<i>now</i>, not only in an argumentative sense, “<i>as the case now is,</i>” but here in a more temporal sense, as opposed to<i> then: now,</i> under the prophetic revelations since the captivity,—under the New Test. dispensation in which those prophecies will find their fulfilment)<b> hath He</b> (God: see above)<b> promised, saying, Yet once</b> (more)<b> and I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.</b> The prophecy in Haggai is uttered, like the whole of his prophecies, with reference to the second temple, which was then rising out of the ruins of the first, smaller indeed and poorer, but destined to witness greater glories. It was to be the scene of the last revelation of Jehovah to His people: and the house of David, then so low, was to rise above the ruins of the thrones of the earth, and endure as the signet on God’s right hand (Hagg. ii. 21–23). It is this ruin of earthly powers, this antitypical shaking of the earth and all that is in it, after the typical material shaking at Sinai, of which the prophet speaks. And the result of this shaking was to be, that the desire, or best treasures, of all nations (not to be understood personally of Christ, but as in the Septuagint, “the chosen things of all the nations shall come”) should be brought to adorn that temple. The expression here (as in the Septuagint) rendered “<i>yet once</i>....” is in the Hebrew, “yet once, it is a little while, and:” i.e. the period which shall elapse shall be but one, not admitting of being broken into many; and that one, but short. Thus the prophecy seems to point to the same great final bringing of all the earth under the Kingdom of God, which is spoken of in Zechariah xiv., when the Lord shall come and all His saints with Him, the great antitype of Sinai (see Deut. xxxiii. 2), so often the subject of ancient prophecy. It is clearly wrong, with some interpreters, to understand this shaking of the mere breaking down of Judaism before the Gospel, or of any thing which shall be fulfilled<i> during</i> the Christian œconomy short of its glorious end and accomplishment. The<b> not only</b>... but, which the Writer has substituted for the simple “<i>and</i>” of the Septuagint, is adopted for the sake of bringing out the point which is before him, the earth, and the speaking from the earth, on the one hand, the heaven, and the speaking from the heaven, on the other. But the<b> heaven</b> here, that is to be shaken, is the material heaven stretched above this earth,
