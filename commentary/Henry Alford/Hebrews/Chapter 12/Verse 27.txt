<b> 27.</b>]<b> But</b> (now)<b> this Yet once</b> (more)<b> indicates the removal of the things shaken, as of things which have been made, in order that the things which</b><b> are not</b> (i. e. cannot be)<b> shaken may abide</b> (the great final shaking which is to introduce the accomplished kingdom of God is that after which there shall be no other. To what does in order that belong? Two ways of taking the sentence are possible. 1) That given above, to the consideration of which I will presently return. 2) We may join<i> in order that</i>, &c., not with the fact pointed at, the<i> removal of the things shaken</i>, as its purpose, but with the verb,<b> have been made</b>; ‘as of things which have been made in order that the things which cannot be shaken may remain:’ i.e. the scope of Creation has been, the establishing of the kingdom of Redemption: that it, the transitory and baseless, may pass away when its work is fulfilled, and give place to that which shall never pass away. This view is strongly taken by Delitzsch, after Grotius, Bengel, Tholuck, and others. But I cannot accede to it, beautiful as is the thought, and strictly true, that Creation was made but to subserve Redemption: the things removable, to give place to the things unremoveable. For, a) the word<i> remain</i> will thus have an exceedingly awkward elliptic sense, “that the things which cannot be shaken may remain,” i.e. “may come into the place of those removed, and thus abide for ever:” for things which cannot be shaken<i> remaining</i> merely, would be a matter of course. b) the logical propriety as well as the rhythm of the sentence is thus destroyed. For we should on this rendering have the clause beginning with “<i>in order that</i>” entirely subordinated to the word<b> made</b>, and indicating, not the purpose of the main action of the sentence, but that of the creation, a matter lying quite out of the present record. So that, it seems to me, we must fall back on 1), viz. the making<b> in</b><b> order that</b> to belong to “<i>the remaining,</i>” the action of the sentence. This, it is true, is not without difficulty. For, a) even thus we must go some little out of our way for a sense for<b> remain</b>, though not so far as in the other case. It must then mean,<i> may remain over</i>, when the<i> things shaken</i> are gone: may be permanently left: to which sense there is no objection, but it does not exactly fit the requirements of the sentence: b) if the term<b> which have been made</b> be taken absolutely, we might be met by the citation from Isa. lxvi. 22, to shew that the new heavens and the new earth are also<i> made</i>: see also Isa. lxv. 17, 18. The answer to this must be, though I own it is not altogether a satisfactory one, that the<i> making</i> is not the same in the two cases: that this word carries rather with it<i> made</i><i> with hands, of this creation,</i> as that word is explained, ch. ix. 11: whereas the other<i> I make</i> rests in the almighty power of God, by which the spirit-world as well as the world of sense was called into existence. See by all means, on the whole, Luke xxi. 26).
