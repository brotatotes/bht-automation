To what does in order that belong? Two ways of taking the sentence are possible. 1) That given above, to the consideration of which I will presently return. 2) We may join<i> in order that</i>, &c., not with the fact pointed at, the<i> removal of the things shaken</i>, as its purpose, but with the verb,<b> have been made</b>; ‘as of things which have been made in order that the things which cannot be shaken may remain:’ i.e. the scope of Creation has been, the establishing of the kingdom of Redemption: that it, the transitory and baseless, may pass away when its work is fulfilled, and give place to that which shall never pass away. This view is strongly taken by Delitzsch, after Grotius, Bengel, Tholuck, and others. But I cannot accede to it, beautiful as is the thought, and strictly true, that Creation was made but to subserve Redemption: the things removable, to give place to the things unremoveable. For, a) the word<i> remain</i> will thus have an exceedingly awkward elliptic sense, “that the things which cannot be shaken may remain,” i.e. “may come into the place of those removed, and thus abide for ever:” for things which cannot be shaken<i> remaining</i> merely, would be a matter of course. b) the logical propriety as well as the rhythm of the sentence is thus destroyed. For we should on this rendering have the clause beginning with “<i>in order that</i>” entirely subordinated to the word<b> made</b>, and indicating, not the purpose of the main action of the sentence, but that of the creation, a matter lying quite out of the present record. So that, it seems to me, we must fall back on 1), viz. the making<b> in</b>
