<p><strong> 29</strong> .] <strong> For moreover our God is a consuming fire</strong> ( <strong> καὶ</strong> γάρ , as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span> , and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:37">Luke 22:37</span> , introduces the reason rendered by γάρ as an additional particular not contained in what went immediately before, answering to the Latin ‘ <em> etenim</em> .’ It is quite impossible that the Writer should have meant, “For <em> our God also</em> , as well as the God of the Jews:” as even Bleek, De Wette, Tholuck, and Bisping make him say. Besides the utter incongruity of such a mode of expression with any thing found in our Writer or in the N. T., this would certainly have been expressed καὶ γὰρ ἡμῶν ὁ θεός . The words are taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+4:24">Deuteronomy 4:24</span> , ὅτι κύριος ὁ θεός σου πῦρ καταναλίσκον ἐστί , θεός ζηλωτής . Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+9:3">Deuteronomy 9:3</span> . And thus the fact that God’s anger continues to burn now, as then, against those who reject his Kingdom, is brought in; and in the background lie all those gracious dealings by which the fire of God’s presence and purity becomes to his people, while it consumes their vanity and sin and earthly state, the fire of purity and light and love for their enduring citizenship of his kingdom).</p>
