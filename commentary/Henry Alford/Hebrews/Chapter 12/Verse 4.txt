<b> 4.</b>] Bengel’s remark, which De Wette charges with pedantry, “from the<i> race</i> he comes to<i> boxing,</i> as Paul, 1 Cor. ix, 26,” is nevertheless a just one.<b> Not yet have ye resisted unto blood</b> (many take this to mean, have not yet sacrificed your lives: so Chrysostom, “ye have undergone spoiling of your goods, defamation, banishment, but not yet this” And it may be so: but 1 would rather abide by the idea of the pugilistic figure being intended, and apply<b> unto blood</b> to the figure, not to the interpretation. Seneca says: “An athlete cannot bring great courage to the contest who has never been bruised. He who has seen his own blood, whose teeth have crashed beneath the fist, he who has been thrown and borne the weight of his adversary on him, and has not been prostrated in his spirit, who as often as he has fallen has risen more indomitable in spirit, he it is who comes down to the fight with great hope.” On the relation of such passages as this to the date of the Epistle, see in the Introduction,§ii, 29 ff.),<b> contending against sin</b> (personified, as an adversary: not to be limited in its meaning to sin in themselves, or to sin in their persecutors, but understood of both. Delitzsch, who would confine it to the latter, says that it was not sin in themselves which would<i> shed</i> their blood, but rather, which would<i> spare</i> its being shed. Yes, and for this very reason the<i> resisting</i> that sin of unfaithfulness which would lead them to<i> spare</i> their blood, would, if carried far enough, lead to the shedding of it. Similarly, the sin in their persecutors, which they were to resist, would, if yielded to, spare their blood by seducing them into apostasy).
