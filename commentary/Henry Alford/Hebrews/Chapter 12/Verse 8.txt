 8 .]  But if ye are without (separate from, no partakers in)  chastisement, of which all (God’s sons: or those above mentioned, ch. 11, which is better, on account of the perfect verb)  have been made partakers (  μέτοχος , see reff. and note),  then ye are (  ἄρα , the inferential particle, in late and N. T. Greek, is found at the beginning of a clause: but never in classical Greek. Delitzsch compares two examples, one from Lucian, Jup. Tragœd. § 51, εἰ εἰσὶ βωμοί , εἰσὶ καὶ θεοί · ἀλλὰ μὴν εἰσὶ βωμοί , εἰσὶν ἄρα καὶ θεοί , the other, the well-known “cogito, ergo sum;” which in later and modern Greek is στοχάζομαι , ἄρα εἰμί ( εἶμαι ). He proceeds to say that Klotz’s view, that ἄρα is not properly syllogistic but only expresses “  leviorem et liberiorem quandam ratiocinationem,” is not confirmed by N. T. usage, nor indeed by classical, cf. Plato, Phædo § 26, οὐχ ὁρατόν · ἀειδὲς ἄρα )  bastards (  νόθος , ὁ μὴ γνήσιος υἱός , ἀλλ ʼ ἐκ παλλακίδος , Phavorinus. But it is only one side of the similitude which is brought out. So Philo, De Confus.

Chrys. explains it well: ὁρᾷς ὅτι ὥσπερ ἔφθην εἰπών , οὐκ ἔνι μὴ παιδευόμενον εἶναι υἱόν : ὥσπερ γὰρ ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις τῶν νόθων καταφρονοῦσιν οἱ πατέρες , κἂν μηδὲν μανθάνωσι , κἂν μὴ ἔνδοξοι γένωνται , τῶν δὲ γνησίων ἕνεκεν υἱῶν δεδοίκασι μήποτε ῥᾳθυμήσωσι , τοῦτο καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος . εἰ τοίνυν τὸ μὴ παιδεύεσθαι νόθων ἐστί , δεῖ χαίρειν ἐπὶ τῇ παιδείᾳ , εἴγε γνησιότητος τοῦτό ἐστιν ),  and not sons .
