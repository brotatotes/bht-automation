<b> 10.</b>]<i> What is the connexion with ver.</i> 9? It is represented as being entirely done away by our interpretation of<b> meats</b> above. If I regard it aright, it is not only not done away, but. established in its proper light. Those ancient distinctions are profitless: one distinction remains: that our true meat is not to be partaken of by those who adhere to those old distinctions: that Christianity and Judaism are necessarily and totally distinct. See more below.<b> We have an altar</b> (to what does the Writer allude? Some have said that no distinct idea was before him, but that he merely used the term altar, to help the figure which he was about to introduce. And this view has just so much truth in it, that there is no<i> emphasis</i> on the word<b> altar</b>. The altar bears only a secondary place in the figure; but still I cannot think that it has not a definite meaning. Others understand by the altar,<i> Christ himself</i>. This again has so much truth in it, that the Victim is so superior to the altar, as to cast it altogether into shade; but still is not Himself the altar. Some again understand,<i> the table of the Lord</i>, at which we eat the Lord’s Supper. This is so far true, that that table may be said to<i> represent</i> to us the Cross whereupon the Sacrifice was offered, just as the bread and wine, laid on it, represent the oblation itself: but it<i> is</i> not the altar, in any propriety of language, however we may be justified, in common parlance, in so calling it. Some again have interpreted it to mean the<i> heavenly place</i>, where Christ now offers the virtue of His Blood to the Father for us. This again is so far true, that it is the antitype of the Cross, just as the Cross is the antitype of the Lord’s table: but we do not want, in this word, the heavenly thing represented by, any more than the enduring ordinance representing, the original historic concrete material altar: we want that altar itself: and that altar is, the CROSS, on which the Lord suffered. That is our altar: not to be emphasized, nor exalted into any comparison with the adorable Victim thereon offered; but still our altar, that wherein we glory that for which as for our altars. we contend: of which our banners, our tokens, our adornments, our churches, are full: severed from which, we know not Christ; laid upon which, He is the power of God, and the wisdom of God. And so it is here explained by most of the best Commentators)<b> to eat of which</b> (see esp. 1 Cor. ix. 13)<b> they have not licence who serve the tabernacle</b> (who are these? Some, as Schlichting, Morus, and strange to say recently Hofmann, understand by them the same, viz. Christians, as the subject of<b> we</b><b> have</b>. We Christians have an altar whereof [even] they who serve the [Christian] tabernacle have no right to eat: i.e. as explained by Hofmann, as the high priest himself did not eat of the sin-offerings whose blood was brought into the tabernacle, but they were burnt without the camp, so we Christians have no sacrifice of which we have any right to eat, no<i> further profit</i> to be derived from that one sacrifice, by which we have bee reconciled to God. But this is 1) false in fact. We<i> have a right</i> to eat of our Sacrifice, and are commanded so to do. All that our Lord says of eating His Flesh and drinking His Blood [explain it how we will] would be nullified and set aside by such an interpretation. And 2) it is directly against the whole context, in which the meats, whatever they are, are pronounced profitless, and they who walked in them contrasted with us who have higher privileges. To what purpose then would it be to say, that we have an altar of which we<i> cannot</i> eat? that we have a sacrifice which brings us no profit, but only shame? 1 pass over the interpretation which understands by the words some particular class of Christians among the Hebrews, because it involves the anachronism of a distinction between clergy and laity which certainly then had no place: and also because it would furnish no sense at all suiting the passage, referring as it then would to<i> some</i> Christians only, not to all. The only true reference of our words, as also that which has been all but universally acknowledged, is that to the Jewish priesthood, and in them to those who have part with them in serving the rites and ordinances of the ceremonial law. These have no right to eat of our altar: for just as the bodies of those beasts whose blood was brought into the sanctuary were burnt without the camp, so Jesus suffered altogether without the gate of legal Judaism. Let us then not tarry serving that tabernacle which has no part in Him, but go forth to Him without the camp, bearing His reproach. For we cleave not to any abiding city, such as the earthly Jerusalem, but seek one to come. Let us then not tarry in the Jewish tabernacle, serving their rites, offering their sacrifices; but offer our now only possible sacrifice, that of praise, the fruit of a good confession, acceptable to God through Him. Thus, and thus only, does the whole context stand in harmony. Thus the words in<i> they that serve the tabernacle</i> keep their former meanings: see ch. viii. 5, where we have “<i>such as have the delineation and the shadow of heavenly things:</i>” and remember that “<i>the tabernacle,</i>” barely so placed, cannot by any possibility mean any part of the Christian apparatus of worship, nor have any antitypical reference, but can only import that which throughout the Epistle it has imported, viz. the Jewish tabernacle: see ch. viii. 5, ix. 21, &c.).
