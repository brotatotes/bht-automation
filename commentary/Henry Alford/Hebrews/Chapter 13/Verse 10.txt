<b> 10.</b>]<i> What is the connexion with ver.</i> 9? It is represented as being entirely done away by our interpretation of<b> meats</b> above. If I regard it aright, it is not only not done away, but. established in its proper light. Those ancient distinctions are profitless: one distinction remains: that our true meat is not to be partaken of by those who adhere to those old distinctions: that Christianity and Judaism are necessarily and totally distinct. See more below.<b> We have an altar</b> (to what does the Writer allude? Some have said that no distinct idea was before him, but that he merely used the term altar, to help the figure which he was about to introduce. And this view has just so much truth in it, that there is no<i> emphasis</i> on the word<b> altar</b>. The altar bears only a secondary place in the figure; but still I cannot think that it has not a definite meaning. Others understand by the altar,<i> Christ himself</i>. This again has so much truth in it, that the Victim is so superior to the altar, as to cast it altogether into shade; but still is not Himself the altar. Some again understand,<i> the table of the Lord</i>, at which we eat the Lord’s Supper. This is so far true, that that table may be said to<i> represent</i> to us the Cross whereupon the Sacrifice was offered, just as the bread and wine, laid on it, represent the oblation itself: but it<i> is</i> not the altar, in any propriety of language, however we may be justified, in common parlance, in so calling it. Some again have interpreted it to mean the<i> heavenly place</i>, where Christ now offers the virtue of His Blood to the Father for us. This again is so far true, that it is the antitype of the Cross, just as the Cross is the antitype of the Lord’s table: but we do not want, in this word, the heavenly thing represented by, any more than the enduring ordinance representing, the original historic concrete material altar: we want that altar itself: and that altar is, the CROSS, on which the Lord suffered. That is our altar: not to be emphasized, nor exalted into any comparison with the adorable Victim thereon offered; but still our altar, that wherein we glory that for which as for our altars. we contend: of which our banners, our tokens, our adornments, our churches, are full: severed from which, we know not Christ; laid upon which, He is the power of God, and the wisdom of God. And so it is here explained by most of the best Commentators)<b> to eat of which</b> (see esp. 1 Cor. ix. 13)<b> they have not licence who serve the tabernacle</b> (who are these? Some, as Schlichting, Morus, and strange to say recently Hofmann, understand by them the same, viz. Christians, as the subject of<b> we</b>
