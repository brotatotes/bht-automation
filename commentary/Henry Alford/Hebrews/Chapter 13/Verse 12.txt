<b> 12.</b>]<b> Wherefore</b> (as being the antitype of the sin-offering on the day of atonement)<b> Jesus also, that He might sanctify</b> (see on ch. ii. 11)<b> the people</b> (see on ch. ii. 17)<b> through His own blood, suffered outside the gate</b> (of Jerusalem. It is necessary in order to understand this verse rightly, to trace with some cure the various steps of the symbolism. The offering of Christ consists of two parts: 1) His offering on earth, which was accomplished on the cross, and answered to the slaying of the legal victim and the destruction of its body by fire, the annihilation of the fleshly life: and 2) His offering in the holy place above, which consisted in His entering heaven, the abode of God, through the veil, that is to say his flesh, and carrying His blood there as a standing atonement for the world’s sin. This, the sanctifying of the people through His own blood, was the ulterior end of that sacrifice on earth: and therefore whatever belonged to that sacrifice on earth, is said to have been done in order to that other. This will sufficiently account for the clause indicating purpose here, without making it seem as if the ultimate end, the sanctification of God’s people, depended on the subordinate circumstance of Christ’s having suffered outside the gate. It did depend on the entire fulfilment by Him of all things written of Him in the law: and of them this was one).<b> So then let us go forth to Him outside</b><b> the camp</b> ( “meaning, outside the polity which is according to the law:” Theodoret.

Both these may be involved in that which is intended; the latter particular is presently mentioned: but they are not identical with it. Possibly there may be a reference to Exod. xxixii. 7, “<i>It came to pass, that every one which sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.</i>” Bleek objects that if so, we should not expect<i> the tabernacle</i> to have been so shortly before mentioned as representing the Jewish sanctuary, in distinction from the Christian. But this seems hardly sufficient reason for denying the reference. The occasion in Exod. xxxiii. was a remarkable one. The people were just quitting Sinai,
