 17 .] Having already in Heb 13:7 spoken of their deceased leaders in the church, and thereby been reminded of  their stedfastness in the faith, he has taken occasion in the intervening verses to admonish them respecting the danger of apostasy to Judaism, and to exhort them to come fearlessly out of it to Christ. Now he returns to their  duty to their leaders .  Obey your leaders ( περὶ ἐπισκόπων λέγει , Œc., Thl.),  and submit (to them) (  πείθεσθαι , in the regular course of your habits, guided by them, persuaded that their rule is right:  ὑπείκειν , where that rule interferes with your own will: πείθεσθαι has more of free following, ὑπείκειν of dutiful yielding):  for they (on their part, brought out by the  αὐτοί )  keep watch on behalf of your souls (not = ὑπερ ὑμῶν as Böhme, but rather = ὑπερ ὑμῶν εἰς σωτηρίαν : the ψυχή bringing in the idea of immortality),  as having to give an account (Thdrt. well-remarks, παραινεῖ μὲν τοῖς μαθηταῖς ὑπακούειν τοῖς διδασκάλοις · διήγειρε δὲ κατὰ ταὐτὸν καὶ τοὺς διδασκάλους εἰς πλείονα προθυμίαν · διδάσκει γὰρ αὐτοὺς ἀγρυπνεῖν καὶ τὰς εὐθύνας δειμαίνειν . Chrys. de Sacerdotio, lib. vi. init., vol. i. 2, p. 677 (Migne), says, τὸ γὰρ πείθεσθε τοῖς ἡγ . κ . τ . λ .… ἀποδώσοντες , εἰ καὶ πρότερον εἶπον , ἀλλ ʼ οὐδὲ νῦν σιωπήσομαι · ὁ γὰρ φόβος ταύτης τῆς ἀπειλῆς συνεχῶς κατασείει μου τὴν ψυχήν ):  that they may do this (viz.  watch , not give an account, for thus the present ποιῶσιν , and τοῦτο γὰρ ἀλυσιτελὲς ὑμῖν would be inapplicable)  with joy, and not lamenting (over your disobedience):  for this (their having to lament over you)  is unprofitable for you (  λυσιτελεῖ is found in Luke 17:2 . “The exhortation is like Paul in its spirit, cf. 1 Thessalonians 5:12-13 , but more like Luke in its expression. And as we proceed, St. Luke’s and St. Paul’s expressions are found mingled together.” Delitzsch).
