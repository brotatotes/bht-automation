<b> 17—end.</b>]<i> Concluding exhortations and</i><i> notices.</i><br><br><b> 17.</b>] Having already in ver. 7 spoken of their deceased leaders in the church, and thereby been reminded of<i> their</i> steadfastness in the faith, he has taken occasion in the intervening verses to admonish them respecting the danger of apostasy to Judaism, and to exhort them to come fearlessly out of it to Christ. Now he returns to their<i> duty to their leaders</i>.<b> Obey your leaders, and submit</b> (<b>to them</b>) (<b>obey</b>, in the regular course of your habits, guided by them, persuaded that their rule is right<b> submit</b>, where that rule interferes with your own will:<b> obey</b> has more of free following,<b> submit</b> of dutiful yielding):<b> for they</b> (on their part)<b> keep watch on behalf of your souls</b> (not the same as<i> on behalf of</i><b> you</b>, but rather equivalent to “<i>on behalf of you for your salvation:</i>” the word<b> soul</b> bringing in the idea of immortality),<b> as having to give an account</b> (by these words, as Theophylact well observes, bestir up the rulers also to diligence, and remembering their own responsibility):<b> that they may do this</b> (viz.<i> watch</i>, not give an account, for thus the present tenses which follow would be inapplicable)<b> with joy, and not lamenting</b> (over your disobedience):<b> for this</b> (their having to lament over you)<b> is unprofitable for you.</b>
