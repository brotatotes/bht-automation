 18 .]  Pray for us (here, as elsewhere, it is probably a mistake to suppose that the first person plural indicates the Writer alone. As Del. observes, the passage from the ἡγούμενοι to the Writer individually would be harsh. And when Bleek finds in Hebrews 13:19 a proof that the Writer only is meant, he misses the point, that this ἡμῶν , including the Writer and his companions, is in fact a transition note between Heb 13:17 and Hebrews 13:19 . Cf. Ephesians 6:19 ; Rom 15:30 ; 2Co 1:11 ):  for we are persuaded ( πειθόμεθα , which is St. Luke’s way of speaking, cf. Acts 26:26 , has been changed into πεποίθαμεν , which is St. Paul’s, cf. Galatians 5:10 ; Philippians 1:25 ; Php 2:24 )  that (Bengel, al. pause at πεποίθαμεν (rec.) γάρ , rendering ὅτι “quia: nam  confidimus ponitur absolute, uti  audemus , 2 Corinthians 5:8 .” But the other is the better and more probable rendering, even with the rec.: and with πειθόμεθα , more necessary still)  we have a good conscience (St. Luke’s expression, see reff.: and here chosen perhaps to correspond to καλῶς below),  desiring in all things (not as Chrys., Erasm.(par.), Luth., al., masculine, οὐκ ἐν ἐθνικοῖς μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν , but as in Heb 13:4 )  to behave ourselves with seemliness ( τουτέστιν , ἀπροσκόπως διάγειν σπουδάζοντες καὶ ἀσκανδαλίστως . Thl. This appears to point at some offence of the same kind as we know to have been taken at the life and teaching of St. Paul with reference to the law and Jewish customs).
