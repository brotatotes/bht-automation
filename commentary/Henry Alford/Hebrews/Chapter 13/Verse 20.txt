<b> 20.</b>]<b> But</b> (breaking off, as we use the same term: see again ver. 22)<b> the God of peace</b> (so often, at the end of St. Paul’s Epistles: see Rom. xv. 33; xvi. 20; 1 Cor. xiv. 33; 2 Cor. xiii. 11; Phil. iv. 9; 1 Thess. iv. 23; and 2 Thess. iii. 16. In the presence of so many instances of the expression under different circumstances, it would perhaps be hardly safe to infer from it here any reference to danger of strife within the church addressed. Still the words are not a mere formula, and in all the above places, some reference is made, doubtless, to circumstances either of internal dissension or external tribulation. And certainly both the exhortations in vv. 17–19 point to a state in which there was danger of disobedience within and suspicion towards the Writer and those who were on his part. So that ‘peace’ was a natural wish for them, even without taking into account those troubles which harassed and threatened them from without, in regard of which it would be also a haven, where they would be),<b> who brought up from the dead</b> (perhaps this is said not of the Resurrection only, but of the Ascension also. “This is the only place where our Writer mentions the Resurrection. Every where else he lifts his eyes from the depth of our Lord’s humiliation, passing over all that is intermediate, to the highest point of His exaltation. The connexion here suggests to him once at least to make mention of that which lay between Golgotha and the throne of God, between the altar of the Cross and the heavenly sanctuary, the resurrection of Him who died as our sin-offering”)<b> the great Shepherd of the sheep</b> (the passage before the Writer’s mind has Been that in the prophetic sixty-third chapter of Isaiah [ver. 11], where speaking of Moses, it is said, “Where is He that brought them up out of the sea unto the Shepherd of his flock?” In Isaiah, the shepherd is Moses; and the comparison between Moses and Christ is familiar to our Writer, ch, iii, 2–6. The addition of<b> great</b> as applied to Christ, is correspondent to His title<b> great Priest</b>, ch. x. 21, To deny this reference, with Lünemann, seems impossible, with the remarkable conjunction of “<i>the Shepherd of the sheep.</i>” The connexion here in which this title of our Lord is brought in, may be, that<i> the Rulers</i> having been just mentioned, and himself also, and his labours and theirs for the settlement of the Church in peace being before his mind, he is led to speak of Him who is the Chief Shepherd [1 Pet. v. 4], who was brought again from the dead by the God of Peace),<b> in the blood of the everlasting covenant</b> (but in what sense? Theodoret says, “He calls the new Covenant everlasting; for that there shall be none after it.” Then, the expression itself can hardly but be a reminiscence of Zech. ix. 11, “<i>By (in) the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoner out of the pit wherein is no water:</i>” and if so, the import of the preposition<b> in</b> here will be at least indicated by its import there. And there it is, by virtue of, in the power of, the blood of thy covenant, i.e. of that blood which was the seal of the covenant entered into with thee. So also we must understand it here. The instrumental, conditioning-element force of<i> in</i> seems to predominate:<b> through</b>, or in virtue of, the blood [Acts xx. 28]. See on the whole, Isa. lv. 3; lxi. 8; John x. 11–18),<b> even our Lord Jesus</b> (here the personal name,<b> Jesus</b>, is joined with the assertion of His lordship over us: below, where the inworking of the Spirit through Him is spoken of, it is “<i>through Jesus Christ,</i>” His office as Christ at God’s right hand having made Him the channel of the Spirit to us: the anointing on Him, the Head, flowing down to the skirts of the raiment. See Acts ii. 36)<b> perfect you in every good work, towards the doing His will</b> (see ch. x. 36. Here as there, it is not a<i> habit</i> which is spoken of, but the accomplishment of the whole course of obedience),<b> doing in you</b> (<b>doing</b>, chosen expressly as taking up the<b> doing</b> of His will, in exact correspondence with St. Paul’s saying, Phil. ii. 13)<b> that which is well-pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ</b> (the reference is variously giver to “<i>well-pleasing,</i>”—well-pleasing&c. through Jesus Christ: or to the verb, “<i>doing.</i>” The latter is by far the more probable, as the former would introduce a superfinity):<b> to whom</b> (i. e. to God, the chief subject of the whole sentence, God, who is the God of peace, who brought up the Lord Jesus from the dead, who can perfect us in every good work, to accomplish His will, and works in’ ns that which is well-pleasing to Him through Jesus Christ. The whole majesty of the sentence requires this reverting to its main agent, and speaks against the referring<b> to whom be glory</b> to our Blessed Lord, who is only incidentally mentioned. See the very similar construction of 1 Pet. iv. 11, where however the reference is not by any means equally certain)<b> be</b> (in 1 Pet. iv. 11, “<i>is:</i>” and possibly also here: but perhaps “<i>be</i>” is the more probable supplement)<b> the glory for ever.
