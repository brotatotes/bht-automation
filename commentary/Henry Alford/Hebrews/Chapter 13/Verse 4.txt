<b> 4.</b>]<i> Exhortation to chastity.</i><b> Let your marriage be</b> (held)<b> in honour in all things</b> (see below)<b> and your marriage bed be undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God shall judge.</b> There are several debatable matters in this verse. First, is it a command or an assertion? The latter view is taken in the ancient Syriac version: “Honourable is marriage among all, and their bed is undefiled:” also in the A.V. and by some Commentators, Chrysostom included. But the arrangement of the words in the original is against this: and so is the context, in which the whole is of a hortatory character: the very same collocation of words immediately follows in ver. 5, where no one suggests the indicative rendering. The imperative view has accordingly been taken by very many ancient Commentators, and the great mass of moderns. That<b> in all</b> is to be supplied not with “<i>men</i>,” but with “<i>things,</i>” I have endeavoured to shew in my Greek Test. The latter clause carries with it the anticipation of condemnation in the term<b> shall judge</b>. Man may, or may not, punish them: one thing is sure: they shall come into judgment, and if so into condemnation, when God shall judge all.
