<p><strong> 5</strong> .] <strong> Let your manner of life</strong> (reff.) <strong> be void of avarice: contented</strong> (sufficed) <strong> with things present</strong> (the construction is precisely as in ref. Rom., ἡ ἀγάπη ἀνυπόκριτος · ἀποστυγοῦντες τὸ πονηρὸν κ . τ . λ . On ἀρκούμενος and τοῖς παροῦσιν , see Bleek’s examples. Among them, we have the very phrase in Teles. in Stobæus, serm. 95, βιώσῃ ἀρκούμενος τοῖς παροῦσι , τῶν ἀπόντων οὐκ ἐπιθυμῶν : Democrit. in Stobæus, serm. 1, τοῖς παρεοῦσιν ἀρεκεῖσθαι : Phoeyl. 4, ἀρκεῖσθαι παρεοῦσι , καὶ ἀλλοτρίων ἀπέχεσθαι . The construction <strong> ἀρκεῖσθαί τινι</strong> occurs in Herod. ix. 33, οὐδ ʼ οὕτω ἔφη ἔτι ἀρκέεσθαι τούτοισι μούνοισι , and al. (Bl.): see also reff.): <strong> for He</strong> (viz. ὁ ἐπαγγειλάμενος , of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span> , God, already named <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span> . “In post-biblical Hebrew,” says Delitzsch, “ הוּא and אֲנִי are used as the mystical names of God”) <strong> hath said, I will not leave thee, no nor will I forsake thee</strong> (passages bearing some resemblance to this are found in the O. T., but no where the words themselves: see reff. But in Philo, Confus. Ling. § 32, vol. i. p. 431, we have, λόγιου τοῦ ἵλεω θεοῦ μεστὸν ἡμερότητος ἐλπίδας χρηστὰς ὑπογράφον τοῖς παιδείας ἐρασταῖς ἀνῄρηται τοιόνδε , Οὐ μή σε ἀνῶ , οὐδ ʼ οὐ μή σε ἐγκαταλίπω . This is certainly singular, and cannot be mere coincidence. Bleek and Lünemann suppose the Writer to have made the citation direct from Philo (see Prolegg. § i. par. 156), whereas Delitzsch believes that the expression was taken from Deu 31:6 A, οὐ μή σε ἀνῇ οὐδ ʼ οὐ μή σε ἐγκαταλείπῃ , and had become inwoven into some liturgical or homiletic portion of the services in the Hellenistic synagogue. <strong> οὐδ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> οὐ μή</strong> occurs again Mat 24:21 ):</p>
