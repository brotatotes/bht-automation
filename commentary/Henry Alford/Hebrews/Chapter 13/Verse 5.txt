 5 .]  Let your manner of life (reff.)  be void of avarice: contented (sufficed)  with things present (the construction is precisely as in ref. Rom., ἡ ἀγάπη ἀνυπόκριτος · ἀποστυγοῦντες τὸ πονηρὸν κ . τ . λ . On ἀρκούμενος and τοῖς παροῦσιν , see Bleek’s examples. Among them, we have the very phrase in Teles. in Stobæus, serm. 95, βιώσῃ ἀρκούμενος τοῖς παροῦσι , τῶν ἀπόντων οὐκ ἐπιθυμῶν : Democrit. in Stobæus, serm. 1, τοῖς παρεοῦσιν ἀρεκεῖσθαι : Phoeyl. 4, ἀρκεῖσθαι παρεοῦσι , καὶ ἀλλοτρίων ἀπέχεσθαι . The construction  ἀρκεῖσθαί τινι occurs in Herod. ix. 33, οὐδ ʼ οὕτω ἔφη ἔτι ἀρκέεσθαι τούτοισι μούνοισι , and al. (Bl.): see also reff.):  for He (viz. ὁ ἐπαγγειλάμενος , of ch.

T., but no where the words themselves: see reff. But in Philo, Confus. Ling. § 32, vol. i. p. 431, we have, λόγιου τοῦ ἵλεω θεοῦ μεστὸν ἡμερότητος ἐλπίδας χρηστὰς ὑπογράφον τοῖς παιδείας ἐρασταῖς ἀνῄρηται τοιόνδε , Οὐ μή σε ἀνῶ , οὐδ ʼ οὐ μή σε ἐγκαταλίπω . This is certainly singular, and cannot be mere coincidence. Bleek and Lünemann suppose the Writer to have made the citation direct from Philo (see Prolegg. § i. par. 156), whereas Delitzsch believes that the expression was taken from Deu 31:6 A, οὐ μή σε ἀνῇ οὐδ ʼ οὐ μή σε ἐγκαταλείπῃ , and had become inwoven into some liturgical or homiletic portion of the services in the Hellenistic synagogue.  οὐδ  ʼ   οὐ μή occurs again Mat 24:21 ):
