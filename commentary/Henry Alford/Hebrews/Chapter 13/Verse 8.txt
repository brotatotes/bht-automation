<b> 8.</b>]<b> Jesus Christ is yesterday and to-day the same, and for ever</b> (the verse stands as a transition from what has passed to what follows. “It was Christ whom these<i> leaders</i> preached,<i> when they spoke the word of God</i>: Christ who supported them to the end, being the author and finisher of their faith; and He remains still the same with regard to you,—<i>the same:</i> be not then carried away&c.” As to the<i> meaning</i> of the words,<b> yesterday</b> refers to the time past, when their<i> leaders</i> passed away from them,<b> to-day</b> to the time present, when the Writer and the readers were living. In our A.V., this verse, by the omission of the copula “is,” appears as if it were in apposition with “the end of whose conversation:” and in the carelessly printed polyglott of Bagster, the matter is made worse, by a<i> colon</i> being substituted for the<i> period</i>, after ‘conversation.’ Observe<b> Jesus Christ</b>, not common with our Writer: only e.g. ver. 21, where he wishes to give a solemn fulness to the mention of the Lord: Jesus, the Person, of whom we have been proving, that He is<i> the Christ</i>, the Anointed of God. Compare also ch. x. 10).<b> Be not carried away</b> (the fixed point from which they are not to be carried away, is clearly that given in the last verse, viz. Jesus Christ)<b> by various and strange</b> (<i>strangers to the truth</i>)<b> doctrines</b> (teachings, Matt. xv. 9; Col. ii. 22; 1 Tim. iv. 1):<b> for it is good that the heart be confirmed with grace</b> (God’s grace, working on us by faith),<b> not with meats</b> (it is a question whether this be meant of meat eaten after sacrifices, or of “meats” as spoken of so much by St. Paul, meats partaken of or abstained from as a matter of conscience: see 1 Cor. viii. 8, 13: ib. vi 13: Rom. xiv. 15, 20. The former view is taken by Schlichting, Bleek, Lünnemann, &c., on the grounds, 1) that the expression will not suit meats<i> abstained from</i>, only those partaken of: 2) that ver. 10, which is in close connexion with this, speaks of an altar and of partaking of meats sacrificed: and 3) that this same reference, to meats offered in sacrifice, is retained throughout, to ver. 15. The other view is taken by Chrysostom, &c., the great body of later Commentators, and recently by Böhme, Tholuck, and Delitzsch. And I own the reasons urged in its favour incline me strongly to this view, to the exclusion of the other),<b> in which</b> (the observance of which: the word<b> meats</b> being used for<i> the observance of rules concerning meats and drinks, &c.</i>)<b> they who walked were not profited</b> (these, who walked in such observances, are the whole people of God under the Old Test. dispensation [notice the past tenses], to whom they were of themselves useless and profitless, though ordained for a preparatory purpose: so that Calvin’s objection is answered, that “the discipline of which the distinction between meats was a part,<i> was useful</i> to the fathers under the law.” Yes, and so was the shedding of the blood of bulls and goats part of the discipline: but it was useless to take away sin).
