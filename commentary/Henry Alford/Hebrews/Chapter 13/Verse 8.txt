 8 .]  Jesus Christ is yesterday and to-day the same, and for ever (as to the  construction ,  ὁ αὐτός is the predicate to all three times, not as vulg. (not Syr., if at least Etheridge’s version of it is to be trusted), “Jesus Christus heri et hodie: ipse et in sæcula;” Ambr [78] (passim), Calvin, al. As to the  connexion , the verse stands as a transition from what has passed to what follows. ‘It was Christ whom these ἡγούμενοι preached, ἐλάλησαν τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ : Christ who supported them to the end, being the author and finisher of their faith; and He remains still with regard to you ( ὥσπερ τοὺς ἡγουμένους ὑμῶν οὐ κατέλιπεν , ἀλλ ʼ ἐν πᾶσιν ἀντελαμβάνετο αὐτῶν , οὕτω καὶ ὑμῶν ἀντιλήψεται · ὁ αὐτὸς γάρ ἐστι , altern. in Thl. Similarly Chrys. alt.)  the same : be not then carried away’ &c. As to the  meaning of the words,  ἐχθές (the common and also Attic form, whereas χθές is Epic, Ionic, and Attic) refers to the time past, when their ἡγούμενοι passed away from them;  σήμερον to the time present, when the Writer and the readers were living.

	In our E. V., this verse, by the omission of the copula ‘is,’ appears as if it were in apposition with “the end of whose conversation:” and in the carelessly printed polyglott of Bagster, the matter is made worse, by a  colon being substituted for the  period after “conversation.” Observe  Ἰησοῦς χριστός , not common with our Writer: only e. g. Hebrews 13:21 , where he wishes to give a solemn fulness to the mention of the Lord: Jesus, the Person, of whom we have been proving, that He is χριστός , the Anointed of God. Cf. also ch. Heb 10:10 ).
