<p><strong> 9</strong> .] <strong> Be not carried away</strong> (the rec. περιφ . is probably from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span> . <strong> παραφέρεσθαι</strong> , as the prep. indicates, is to be carried out of the right course. So Plato, Phædr. p. 265 B, ἴσως μὲν ἀληθοῦς τινος ἐφαπτόμενοι , τάχα δ ʼ ἂν καὶ ἄλλοσε παραφερόμενοι : Plut. Timoleon 6, αἱ κρίσεις .… σείονται καὶ παραφέρονται ῥᾳδίως ὑπὸ τῶν τυχόντων ἐπαίνων καὶ ψόγων , ἐκκρουόμενοι τῶν οἰκείων λογισμῶν . Ælian has ὑπὸ τοῦ οἴνου παραφερόμενος . Œc. says, τὸ δὲ παραφ . ἀπὸ μεταφορᾶς τῶν μαινομένων τῶν τῇδε κἀκεῖσε παραφερομένων εἴρηται . The fixed point from which they are not to be carried away, is clearly that given in the last verse, viz. Jesus Christ) by various ( ποικίλαις , παντοδαπαῖς · αἱ τοιαῦται γὰρ οὐδὲν βέβαιον ἔχουσιν , ἀλλ ʼ εἰσὶ διάφοροι · μάλιστα δὲ τὸ τῶν βρωμάτων διάφορον . Chrys. Thl. says, τουτέστιν παρὰ τοῦδε τόδε .… ἡ γὰρ ἀλήθεια μονοειδής , καὶ πρὸς ἓν ἀφορῶσα . The reference, from what follows, is to teachings about various meats) <strong> and strange</strong> ( τουτέστιν , ἀλλότριαι τῆς ἀληθείας , Thl. The use of ἕτερος is similar, from which ἑτεροδοξία has its technical sense) <strong> doctrines</strong> (teachings: so διδασκαλίαι , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:9">Matthew 15:9</span> ; Col 2:22 ; 1Ti 4:1 ): <strong> for it is good that the heart be confirmed</strong> (reff.) <strong> with grace</strong> (God’s grace, working <em> on us</em> by faith: δείκνυσιν ὅτι τὸ πᾶν πίστις ἐστίν · ἂν αὐτῇ βεβαιώσῃ , ἡ καρδία ἐν ἀσφαλείᾳ ἕστηκεν , Chrys.), <strong> not with meats</strong> (it is a question whether <strong> βρώμασιν</strong> be meant of meat eaten after sacrifices, or of “meats” as spoken of so much by St. Paul, meats partaken of or abstained from as a matter of conscience: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span> , βρῶμα ἡμᾶς οὐ παρίστησιν τῷ θεῷ ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span> ; ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:20">Romans 14:20</span> , μὴ ἕνεκεν βρώματος κατάλυε τὸ ἔργον τοῦ θεοῦ . The former view is taken by Schlichting, Bleek, Lünemann, al., on the grounds, 1. that the expression will not suit meats <em> abstained from</em> , only those partaken of: “Cor non reficitur cibis non comestis, sed comestis. Ciborum ergo usui, non abstinentiæ, opponitur hic gratia,” Schlicht.; 2. that <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:10">Hebrews 13:10</span> , which is in close connexion with this, speaks of an altar and of partaking of meats sacrificed: and, 3. that this same reference, to meats offered in sacrifice, is retained throughout, to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:15">Hebrews 13:15</span> . The other view is taken by Chrys., Thdrt., Œc., Thl., Primas., Faber Stap., Erasm., Calv., Beza, the great body of later Commentators, and recently by Böhme, Tholuck, and Delitzsch. It is defended against the above objections, 1. by remembering that in the other passages where βρώματα occurs with this reference, it is used not merely in the concrete, for meats absolutely partaken of, but in the abstract, for the whole department or subject of βρώματα , to be partaken of or abstained from: 2. see below on the verse: (3) stands or falls with (2). And besides, it is supported by the following considerations: 4. that βρώματα is a word not found in the law where offerings are spoken of (in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+19:6">Leviticus 19:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+22:30">Leviticus 22:30</span> , we have βρωθήσεται of peace-offerings and thank-offerings): but in the distinction of clean and unclean, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+11:34">Leviticus 11:34</span> ; 1Ma 1:63 . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:5">Malachi 1:5</span> . that in all N. T. places, where βρῶμα is used in a similar connexion, it applies to clean and unclean meats. 6. that διδαχαῖς ποικίλαις καὶ ξέναις μὴ παραφέρεσθε must refer, not to meats eaten after sacrifices, but to some doctrines in which there was variety and perplexity, as to those concerning clean and unclean. And I own these reasons incline me strongly to this view, to the exclusion of the other. Two ‘monstra interpretationis’ need only be mentioned: that of the R.-Cath. Bisping, who interprets <strong> χάριτι</strong> “by the eucharist:” and that of Ebrard, who renders βεβαιοῦσθαι , “ <em> cling fast to</em> ,” and χάριτι and βρώμασιν as datives), <strong> in which</strong> (the observance of which, βρώματα , as above, being used for the observance of rules concerning meats and drinks &amp;c.) <strong> they who walked were not profited</strong> (the <strong> ἐν</strong> belongs, not to ὠφελήθησαν , but to περιπατήσαντες , according to the very usual construction, περιπατεῖν ἔν τινι , for to observe, to live in the practice of any thing: see reff. and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span> . So Chrys., τουτέστιν , οἱ διὰ παντὸς φυλάξαντες αὐτά . These, who walked in such observances, are the whole people of God under the O. T. dispensation (notice the historic aorists), to whom they were of themselves useless and profitless, though ordained for a preparatory purpose: so that Calvin’s objection is answered, “Certe patribus qui sub lege vixerunt utilis fuit pædagogia cujus pars erat ciborum discrimen.” Yes, and so was the shedding of the blood of bulls and goats part of the pædagogia: but it was useless to take away sin. Cf. Thl., οἱ τῇ τῶν βρωμάτων τηρήσει στοιχήσαντες διὰ παντὸς οὐδὲν εἰς τὴν ψυχὴν ὠφελήθησαν , ὡς τῆς πίστεως ἔξω ὄντες καὶ τῷ νόμῳ τῷ ἀνωφελεῖ δουλεύοντες . But he understands it of τοὺς τὴν Ἰουδαϊκὴν παρατήρησιν τῶν βρωμάτων εἰσάγοντες ).</p>
