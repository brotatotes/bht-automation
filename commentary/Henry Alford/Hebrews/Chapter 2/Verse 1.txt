<b> 1] On this account</b> (viz. because Christ, the Mediator of the New Covenant, is far above all the angels who were the mediators of the former Covenant)<b> it behoves us</b> (<i> “being aware of this difference,”</i> Theodoret: it is a moral necessity, arising from the previous premises: so Matt. xviii. 33; xxv. 27; 2 Tim. ii. 6. There is no stress on us)<b> to give heed more abundantly</b> (we must not understand after the comparative,<b> more abundantly,</b> “than we did to the law,” as Chrysostom and others; or the aim of the Writer to be, to shew the superiority of the Gospel over the law, as Theodoret: but the comparative intimates how much our attention ought to be increased and intensified by our apprehension of the dignity of Him whose record the gospel is, and who is its Mediator)<b> to the things heard [by us], lest haply we be diverted</b> (Aristotle uses the same passive form of this Greek verb to indicate that which we familiarly call food<i> going the wrong way</i> in course of swallowing. Plutarch uses it of a ring<i> falling off from the finger.</i> See other illustrations in my Greek Test. The meaning of the verb seems then to be clear—to flow past, or away, or aside, to fall off, deflect from a course. We, going onward in time, living our lives in one or another direction, are exhorted ‘to adhere to the things we have heard’ [see above], and that,<i> ‘that we do not at any time float past them,’</i> be not carried away beside them, led astray from the course on which they would take us. Two mistakes respecting the word are to be avoided: a) that of A.V.,<i> ‘lest at any time we should let them slip.’</i> From what has been above said of the tense and voice, it will be clear that such cannot be the meaning. b) Still worse is that of those who have thought of a comparison with a sieve, or a leaking vessel. So Calvin, Owen, and others: and I find it reproduced in Tait’s commentary on the He-brews:<i> “lest.... we should run out as leaking vessels.”</i> The meaning is as untenable, as the simile is irrelevant. The Greek expositors, whose authority in matters of Greek verbal usage is considerable, all explain it as above. So also all the more accurate of the moderns)<b> from them</b> (such is the most natural object to supply after the verb: turned aside from and floated away from the course on which the<i> adhering</i> to them would have carried us).
