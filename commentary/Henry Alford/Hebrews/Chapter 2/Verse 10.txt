<b> 10.] For</b> (the connexion with the foregoing, see above. The<b> for</b> renders a reason why the result just introduced should have been one which the<i> grace of God</i> contemplated)<b> it became</b> (as matter not only of decorum, but of sequence from the data;—<i> ‘was suitable to,’</i> not as matter of absolute necessity, which was not the question here. The expression here glances at those who found in a suffering and crucified Messiah something unsuitable to the Godhead; and expresses not merely a negative, that it was not unsuitable, not unworthy of God,—but at the same time the positive, that it was altogether correspondent to and worthy of His Being and His Wisdom and His Love, to take this course: that it is so shaped, that he who knows the being and attributes of God, might have expected it. And thus it is indirectly implied, that it was also the most suitable, and that any other way would have been less correspondent to the being and purpose of God. Bleek has some excellent remarks on the lingering of the offence of the cross among these Jewish Christians, who, although their ideas of the glory and kingly triumph of the Messiah been in a measure satisfied by the resurrection and exaltation of Christ, and their hopes awakened by the promise of future glory at His second coming,— yet, in the procrastination of this great event, felt their souls languishing, and the old stumbling-block of Christ’s sufferings recurring to their minds. To set forth then the way of suffering and the cross as one worthy of God’s high purpose, would be a natural course for the argument of the Writer to take)<b> Him, for whom are all things</b> (not only, ‘all those things which contribute to man’s salvation,’ but ‘the sum total of things,’ ‘the universe,’ as in the parallel passages. All created things are for God [see below], for His purpose and for His glory),<b> and by whom</b> (by whose will, and fiat, and agency)<b> are all things</b> (who<i> is intended?</i> From the sequel of the sentence there can be no doubt that it is God the Father. For the subject of this clause is there said to perfect Christ: and this could be predicated of none but the Father Himself. That these expressions are found frequently used of the Son, need be no objection: whatever is thus said of Him as the End, and the Worker, in creation may<i> à fortiori</i> be said of the Father who sent Him and of whose will He is the expression. As to the reason of this lengthened appellation here, Calvin well says: “He might have designated God in one word: but he wished to remind them that that was to be accounted<i> best</i>, which He decreed whose will and glory is the real end of all things.” And not only this: in introducing the<i> “becomingness”</i> of Christ's sufferings by such a description of God, he reminds his readers that those sufferings also were<b> for Him</b>—contributing to His end and His glory—and<b> by Him</b> brought about and carried through by His agency and superintendence),<b> bringing</b> (the application of the clause is to God the Father, the subject of the preceding. See the idea which refers it to<i> Christ</i> treated in my Greek Test. Some take the participle as past,<i> “having brought,”</i> referring the expression chiefly, or entirely, to the Old Test. saints. These however can hardly be meant; for they cannot be said in any adequate sense to have been led to glory, or to have had Christ for the Captain of their salvation, And surely it would be most unnatural to refer the participle to those saints only who had entered into glory since the completion of Christ’s work, but before this Epistle was written. The peculiar form of the participle here used has in all cases reference to the completion of the action. In Christ’s being<i> perfected</i>, the bringing many sons to glory is<i> completed</i>. Had it been a<i> present</i>, we must have rendered, as indeed the A.V. has erroneously rendered now,<i> ‘in bringing:’</i> so that the Father’s<i> perfecting</i> of Christ would be<i> only a step in the process</i> of leading many sons to glory. But now it is<i> the whole process</i>. We cannot give in idiomatic English this delicate shade of meaning correctly: the nearest representation of it is, as in the text, perhaps— ‘it became Him.... bringing, as He did, many sons to glory, to’&c.)<b> many</b> (not in contrast to<i> all</i>, but in contrast to<i> few</i>, and in relation to one)<b> sons</b> (probably in the closer sense: not merely sons by creation, but sons by adoption. This seems necessitated by the next verse)<b> to glory</b> (the expression is not common in this meaning in our Epistle: and is perhaps chosen on account of the word occurring in ver. 9. It is, that supreme bliss and majesty which rightly belongs to God only—of which His divine Son is [ch. i. 3] the brightness or shining forth, and of which believers in Christ are here in their degree partakers, and shall be fully so hereafter. It is the crowning positive result of the negative word<i> salvation</i>),<b> to make perfect</b> (this word is used often in our Epistle, and in various references. It is said of the Redeemer Himself, here, and in ch. v. 9; vii. 28,—of His people, who are<i> made perfect</i> through Him, ix. 9; xi. 14, 40; xii. 23; and indeed xii. 2;—with a general reference, vii. 11, 19: see also<i> perfect</i> ch. v. 14; ix. 11,—and<i> perfection</i>, ch. vi. 1. From all this it is evident, that some meaning must be looked for wide enough to include all these senses of the word itself and its cognates. And such a sense is found in the ordinary rendering of the word,—to<i> “accomplish,”</i> or<i> “make complete,”</i> or<i> “perfect.”</i> This accomplishment, completion or perfecting of Christ was, the bringing Him to that glory which was His proposed and destined end: and it answers to the<i> “crowning with glory and honour”</i> of ver. 9: and to the<i> “glorifying”</i> of St. John: and fits exactly the requirements of the other passages in our Epistle where our Lord is spoken of. Nor is such meaning at all misplaced in those passages where<i> we</i> are spoken of: seeing that it is a relative term, and our<i> being made perfect</i> is the being brought, each one of us, to the full height of our measure of perfection, in union with and participation of Christ’s glory. Some have imagined that the meaning here and elsewhere in our Epistle, of the word rendered<i> “to make perfect,”</i> is<i> “to consecrate:”</i> and understand the word of the setting apart or consecration of Christ to the high-priestly office. So Calvin [the first, as Bleek thinks, who propounded the view], Beza, and others. But Bleek replies well, that such a meaning will not suit the other passages in our Epistle, and besides, no such meaning is really ever found for the Greek word)<b> the Author</b> (<i>Captain</i>, in the A.V., introduces an idea foreign to the meaning of the title here used for our Lord. It is often found in the sense of<i> a leader</i> in the Septuagint: in that of the<i> progenitor of a race:</i> of one who<i> precedes others by his example</i>, they following him. Compare particularly ch. xii. 2, where the idea of<i> author</i> and<i> completer</i> is so closely allied to that in our verse, that the word<i> author</i> should have been kept here also. The idea of<i> origination</i> for the word frequently occurs in Greek writers, especially later ones, of the person from whom any thing, whether good or bad, first proceeds, in which others have a share. Hence the usage here, and in Acts iii. 15, where Christ is called<i> “the Prince of Life,”</i> is easily explained: on Him our salvation depends; He was its originator)<b> of their salvation through sufferings</b> (i. e. His sufferings were the appointed access to, and the appointed elements of, His glory: see more particularly below, on ch. v. 8, 9. Chrysostom gives a beautiful general application: “shewing us that he who suffers for another, does not benefit him alone, but also himself becomes more illustrious and nearer perfection”).
