<b> 11.] For both the Sanctifier and (notice both—and,</b> which bind closely together in one category)<b> the sanctified</b> (sanctification is not here the same as<i> “salvation,”</i> but as every where, when used in allusion to Christ’s work on His people, involves that transforming and consecrating process, of which His Spirit is the actual agent. Hence, believers are ordinarily not described by the past participle,<i> “having been sanctified,”</i> but as here by the present,<i> “being sanctified.”</i> The word<b> to sanctify</b> signifies in the Septuagint and New Test. usually,<i> to select out:</i> and where their present state is spoken of, the participle is present: where God's purpose respecting them, and Christ's finished work, the perfect. Sanctification is glory working in embryo: glory is sanctification come to the birth and manifested.<br><br> It is disputed whether the reference of these words is to be considered as general, applying to every case of sanctifier and sanctified, as, e.g. the priest and the people under the old law, the firstfruits and the remaining harvest: or is to be restricted to Christ and His people alone. Certainly the latter seems to be required by the context, and most of all by the assumption of the subject in the next clause tacitly as contained in<i> he that sanctifieth</i>. The ground on which Christ is only Sanctifier has also been variously alleged. Grotius leaves the connexion very loose, when he says, “Christ makes us holy by His teaching and example. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and we by the Holy Spirit get a new nature: thus we both have a common origin.” But this obviously does not reach the depth of the following argument, see especially ver. 17: and we must believe that there is a reference to the expiatory death of Christ: see also ch. x. 10, 14, and more in the note there)<b> [are] of one</b> (<b>one</b>, as will he seen by the reference in my Greek Test., must be taken as<i> masculine</i>. And if masculine, what are we to supply? Some say,<i> Adam:</i> others,<i> Abraham.</i> But it seems far better and simpler here, on account of the expression<b> many sons,</b> above, and as satisfying fully the force of<b> of,</b> or<b> out of,</b> to understand<i> God</i> to be meant. It is not here the mere physical unity of all men with Christ which is treated, but the further and higher spiritual unity of the<i> Sanctifier</i> and the<i> sanctified</i>, as evinced by his speaking of them. The same is plain from ver. 14 below: see there. So that it is the higher Sonship of God, common to the Lord and those whom the Father by Him is leading to glory which must be understood. See John viii. 47; 1 John iii. 10; iv. 6; v. 19; 3 John 11.<br><br> Note, that the point brought out here is not that the holiness of our Lord’s human nature, and our holiness, are both of one, viz. the Father [John x. 36]: which, however true, would be introducing a matter not belonging to the argument<i> here</i>),<b> all [of them]:</b><b> on which account</b> (viz. because they are all of one)<b> He</b> (Christ: see above)<b> is not ashamed</b> (His consent in this relationship springs, as Chrysostom says, not from the nature of the case merely, but from His extreme love and condescension)<b> to call them</b> (that are sanctified)<b> brethren, saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the assembly will I sing of thee</b> (it will be sufficient to refer, respecting the general sense and prophetic import of Ps. xxii., to what has been before said, on Ps. viii. [above ver. 6], and on similar citations elsewhere. The Psalm was originally the expression of a suffering saint, in all probability David, communing with his God: laying forth to Him his anguish and finally triumphing in confidence of His gracious help and deliverance. But by the mouth of such servants of God did the prophetic Spirit speak forth His intimations respecting the Redeemer to come. No word prompted by the Holy Ghost had reference to the utterer only. All Israel was a type: all spiritual Israel set forth the second Man, the quickening spirit: all the groanings of God's suffering people prefigured, and found their fullest meaning in, His groans, who was the chief in suffering. The maxim cannot be too firmly held, nor too widely applied, that all the Old Test. utterances of the Spirit anticipate Christ, just as all His New Test. utterances set forth and expand Christ: that Christ is everywhere involved in the Old Test., as He is every where evolved in the New Test. And this Psalm holds an illustrious place among those which thus point onward to Christ. Its opening cry, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” was uttered by the Lord Himself in His last agony. The most minute particulars detailed in it are by the Evangelists adduced as exemplified in the history of His Passion; see e.g. John xix. 24 And, as Bleek well observes, the particulars chosen out of that history by St. Matthew seem to have been selected with an especial view to the illustration and fulfilment of this Psalm. Ebrard, in his note here, insists on the authorship of the Psalm by David, and on its date, as belonging to the time of his persecution by Saul, Then he maintains the exact parallelism of the circumstances with those of the second and greater David, and refers the<i> “brethren”</i> here to the countrymen of David, who were hereafter to be his subjects. I have no positive objection to this view. Subordinately to the deeper and wider one, it might be applicable in individual instances: but that other seems to me both safer and nearer the truth. The particular verse here chosen, the 22nd, forms the transition-point from the suffering to the triumphant portion of the Psalm: and consequently the resolution expressed in it by the Messiah has reference to His triumphant state, in which he is still not ashamed to call his people brethren. It is characteristic of the object of this Epistle with reference to intended readers, that whereas the Writer might have cited two instances as matters of fact, in which our Lord did call His disciples brethren after His resurrection [see John xx. 17; Matt. xxviii. 10], yet he has not done so, but has preferred to establish his point by the Old Test. citations).
