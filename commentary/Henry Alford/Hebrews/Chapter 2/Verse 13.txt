<b> 13.] And again, I will put my trust in Him</b> (there is considerable dispute as to the original place from which this citation comes. Most Commentators, and recently Bleek and Delitzsch, have believed it to be taken from Isa. viii. 17, where the words occur in the Septuagint, immediately preceding the next citation. The only objection to this view is, that it would be hardly likely in this case that the words<i> “and again”</i> would have occurred, but the two citations would have proceeded as one. And hence the words have sought in other places: e.g. in Ps. xviii. 3, Isa. xlii. 1, where however, besides the Septuagint being different, the words are spoken in a totally different reference. The<i> same</i> words are found in the Septuagint in 2 Sam. xxii. 3, and Isa. xii. 2. There is no objection to the first of these passages being the<i> origin</i> of our citation; and the alleged non-Messianic character of the Psalm will weigh very light with those who view the Psalms as above set forth. Still, regarding the above-stated objection as of no weight,—owing to the diversity of the two cited clauses, the one expressive of personal trust in God, the other declaratory respecting a relation to others [compare also ch. x. 30, which is a nearly though not exactly similar case],—I prefer, is the more natural, the opinion which derives both texts from the same place of Isaiah. On the sense then, see below).<b> And again, Behold I and the children which God gave me</b> (Isa. viii. 18. Considerable difficulty has been made by the Commentators in applying these citations to Christ. I own that the question seems to me to be admirably stated by Theodorct on Ps. xxii., “More credit is to be given to the Holy Apostles and to our Saviour Himself when He uses plainly the opening of the Psalm, than to those who attempt to interpret it.” But: this does not preclude our entering on an attempt in each case to give a distinct: account of the rationale of the application. In the passage of Isaiah [vv. 11–18], the Prophet is especially blaming the people of Judah under Ahaz, for having called in the help of the Assyrian king against Pekah king of Israel, and Rezin king of Syria. And in these verses [17 f.] the Prophet expresses his own determination, in spite of the reliance of the people on the confederacy, to wait for the Lord, and to remain, he and the children whom God had given him, for signs and wonders in Israel from the Lord of Hosts, which dwelleth in Zion. Then from Isa. viii. 18 to ix. 7, is set forth the prospect of future deliverance to Judah coming from their God, ending with the glorious anticipation of the great future Deliverer. This confident speech of the Prophet our Writer adopts at once as the words of the greatest of all Prophets—thereby<i> assuming</i> the prophetic office of Christ. Thus the matter illustrated [for there is no demonstration here; this verse is a<i> consequence</i> of the last] is, that as the prophet Isaiah withstood the human dependence of his age, and stood forth, he and the children whom God had given him, and who were begotten in pursuance of the divine command as a sign to Israel,—so<i> the great Prophet</i> himself fulfilled the same office, and had the same hopes, and bore the same relation to those among who He prophesied, praising God with them, leading them in confidence on God, and speaking of them as one family and stock with Himself. So that our passage forms a notable instance of the prophetic office of Christ being taken as the antitype of the official words and acts of all the Prophets, just as His kingly office fulfills and takes up all that is said and done by the theocratic Kings, and His priestly office accomplishes all the types and ordinances of the Old Test.
