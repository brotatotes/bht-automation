<b> 14.]</b> The connexion and line of argument is this: in ver. 5 it was shewn, that<i> not to angels, but to</i> MAN, is the new order of things subjected: in vv. 6–8, that this domination was predicated of man in the Old Test.: in ver. 9, that the only case of its filfilment has been that of Jesus, who has been crowned with glory and honour on account of His suffering death. Then, vv. 10, 11 a, it is shewn that the becoming way for the Redeemer to this crown of glory, the purpose of winning which was to bring many sons of God to it, was, being perfected through sufferings, seeing that He must share with those whom He is to sanctify, in dependence on a common Father. Then vv. 11 b, 12, 13 have furnished illustrations confirmatory of this, from His own sayings in the Scripture. And<i> now</i> we are come to the proof, that He who was thus to be the Leader of the salvation of these many sons, by trusting like them, and suffering like them, must Himself BECOME MAN like them, in order for that His death to have any efficacy towards His purpose.<b> Since then</b> (by<b> since</b> an inference is drawn from the words immediately preceding: by<b> then</b>, the thought is cast back to the argument of which the citations had been an interruption: as if it had been said, “and by this very expression in our last citation,<b> the children,</b> we may substantiate that which our argument. is seeking to prove”)<b> the children</b> (before mentioned)<b> are partakers of</b> (literally<i> ‘have been constituted partakers of,’—in</i> the order established in nature, and enduring still. The<i> participation</i> is not with their<i> elders</i>, as Valeknaer, but with<i> one another</i>)<b> blood and flesh</b> ( “this expression betokens,” says Bleek, “the whole sensuous corporeal nature of man, which he has in common with the brutes, and whereby he is the object of sensuous perception and corporeal impressions: whereby also he is subjected to the laws of the infirmity, decay, and transitoriness of material things, in contrast to purely spiritual and incorporeal beings.” Delitzsch remarks on the order, that it differs from<i> “flesh and blood,”</i> in setting forth first the inner and more important element, the blood, as the more immediate and principal vehicle of the soul..... before the more visible and palpable element, the flesh: doubtless with reference to the shedding of Blood, with a view to which the Saviour entered into community with our corporeal life),<b> He Himself also in like manner</b> (<i>similarly.</i> The word expresses a general similitude, a likeness in the main; and so is not to be pressed here, to extend to<i> entire identity</i>, nor on the other hand to imply, of purpose,<i> partial diversity;</i> but to be taken in its wide and open sense—that He Himself also partook, in the main, in like manner with us, of our nature. The ancient expositors dwell justly on the word as against the Docetæ, who held that our Lord’s was only an apparent body)<b> participated in</b> (the A.V.,<i> “took part,”</i> is good, but it should be followed by<i> ‘in,’</i> not ‘<i>of,’</i> which makes it ambiguous. Notice the past tense, referring to the one act of the Incarnation)<b> the same things</b> (viz.<i> blood and flesh:</i> not, as Bengel, “the same things which happen to his brethren, not even death excepted”);<b> that by means of his death</b> (a paradox. “Death itself, as Death, is that which Jesus used as the instrument of annihilating the prince of Death;” Hoffmann. There is an old Latin Epigram, which may be thus given in English: “Had not the death of death|by death done death to death,|that key were lost, which Life|Eternal openeth”)<b> He might destroy</b> (bring to nought. The word is found, besides here, once in St. Luke [xiii. 7], and twenty-five times in St. Paul)<b> him that hath the power of death</b> (the present participle is better taken of the office, ‘the holder of the power,’—than of past time,<i> ‘him that had the power,’</i> as A.V. The reason why this clause comes first, and not<i> “the devil,”</i> is probably, as Chrysostom suggests, to exhibit the paradox mentioned above),<b> that is, the devil</b> (compare Wisdom ii. 24, “By the envy of the devil death came into the world:” and see Rev. xii. 9; xx. 2. So in the Rabbinical writings, Samuel, the chief of the evil spirits, was called the angel of death: and it is said, “Samuel was the cause of death to all the world.”
