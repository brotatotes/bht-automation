<b> 16.]</b> Explanatory of ver. 15, by pointing out a fact well Known to us all, that it was to help a race subject to death, that Christ came.<b> For, as we well know, it is not angels that He helpeth, but it is the seed of Abraham that He helpeth</b> (I have rendered thus, to preserve the emphasis on the two contrasted words,<b> angels,</b> and<b> the seed of Abraham</b>. The word rendered<b> helpeth</b> signifies<i> “takes by the hand,”</i> in order to assist and lead. This help is not by Him rendered to<i> angels:</i> He is not the Captain of their salvation, And herein there is no contradiction to Col. i. 20: for the reconciliation which Christ has effected even for the things in the heavens, is not delivering them from fear of death, or bringing them through sufferings to glory, whatever mystery it may involve beyond our power of conception.
