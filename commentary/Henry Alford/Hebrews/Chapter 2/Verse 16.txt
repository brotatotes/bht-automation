<b> 16.]</b> Explanatory of ver. 15, by pointing out a fact well Known to us all, that it was to help a race subject to death, that Christ came.<b> For, as we well know, it is not angels that He helpeth, but it is the seed of Abraham that He helpeth</b> (I have rendered thus, to preserve the emphasis on the two contrasted words,<b> angels,</b> and<b> the seed of Abraham</b>. The word rendered<b> helpeth</b> signifies<i> “takes by the hand,”</i> in order to assist and lead. This help is not by Him rendered to<i> angels:</i> He is not the Captain of their salvation, And herein there is no contradiction to Col. i. 20: for the reconciliation which Christ has effected even for the things in the heavens, is not delivering them from fear of death, or bringing them through sufferings to glory, whatever mystery it may involve beyond our power of conception.<br><br><b> the seed of Abraham</b> next comes under consideration. And we must here as ever, render, and understand, according to the simple sense of the words used, regarding the circumstances under which they were used. Accordingly, we must not here understand<i> mankind,</i> as some have done: nor again with others, can we suppose the<i> spiritual</i> seed of Abraham to be meant [Gal. iii. 7, 29; Rom. iv. 11f., 16],—because, as Bleek well remarks, the present context speaks not of that<i> into which</i> Christ has<i> made</i> those redeemed by Him, but of that<i> out of which</i> He has<i> helped</i> them.<i> The seed of Abraham</i> then means,<i> the Jewish race</i>, among whom Christ was born in the flesh, and whom He did come primarily to help: and the peculiarity of the expression must be explained, Estius,— “This whole epistle prudently dissimulates the calling of the Gentiles, either because the mention of them would be unpleasing to the Hebrews, or because that mention was not necessary to its design.” I must not omit to mention, that the above manner of interpreting this verse, now generally acquiesced in, was not that of the ancient expositors. By them it was generally supposed that the verb referred to our Lord’s taking upon Him of our nature: and they for the most part make it into a past tense, and render as A.V.,—<i> “He took not upon Him the nature of angels, but He took upon Him the seed of Abraham.”</i> But independently of other reasons against this, arising from the usage of the word, the formula ‘to take on him the seed of Abraham, or the angels,’ would be a most unnatural way of expressing<i> ‘to take the nature</i> of either of these.’ And the ancients themselves seem to have felt, that this formula of itself could not bear such a meaning. They assume accordingly that the writer represents man and his nature, through sinfulness, alienated and flying from God and the divine nature, and the Son of God pursuing, overtaking, and drawing it into union with Himself. It needs little to shew how far-fetched and forced this interpretation of the words is, if it is intended to give the sense of<i> assuming the nature of man.</i> See more remarks on the meaning in my Greek Test.).
