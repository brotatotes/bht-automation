<b> 17.]</b> Because then He had this work to do for the seed of Abraham (sons of men, in the wider reference),—viz. to deliver them from<i> fear</i> of death, He must be made like them in all things, that He may be a merciful and faithful High Priest. Then ver. 18 gives the reason of this necessity.<b> Whence it behoved Him</b> (not implying the eternal purpose of God [Luke xxiv. 26:—but a moral necessity in the carrying out of His mediatorial work)<b> in all things</b> (i. e. all things wherewith the present argument is concerned: all things which constitute real humanity, and introduce to its sufferings and temptations and sympathies. The exception,<i> without sin,</i> brought out in ch. iv. 15, is not in view here)<b> to be like</b> (not,<i> ‘made like.’</i> The original expresses that this resemblance was brought about by a definite act, other than his former state: an important distinction, which however we must rather lose in the English than introduce an irrelevant idea by the word ‘made’)<b> unto his brethren</b> (the children of Israel, as above: but obviously also, his brethren in the flesh—all mankind),<b> that he might become</b> (<b>become</b>, not simply<i> be</i>, because the High Priesthood of Christ in all its fulness, and especially in its work of mercy and compassion and succour, was not inaugurated, till He entered into the heavenly place: see ch. v. 9, vi. 19, 20, vii. 26, viii. 1, 4. His being in all things like his brethren, sufferings and death included, was<i> necessary</i> for Him, in order to his becoming, through those sufferings and death, our High Priest. It was not the death [though that was of previous necessity, and therefore is often spoken of as involving the whole], but the bringing the blood into the holy place, in which the work of sacerdotal expiation consisted: see Levit. iv. 13–20: and below, on the end of the verse)<b> a merciful</b> (the original might also be rendered,<i> “merciful, and a faithful High Priest:”</i> but against adopting this here, see in my Greek Test.)<b> and faithful</b> (true to His office, not only as regards God [ch. iii. 5], but as regards men also; to be trusted without fail)<b> High Priest</b> (this is the first mention of the sacerdotal office of Christ, of which so much is afterwards said in the Epistle, and which recurs again so soon, ch. iii. 1)<b> in matters relating to God</b> (the words must not be referred to<i> faithful</i>, but to<b> High Priest;</b> or rather to the whole idea,<i> “a merciful and faithful High Priest”</i>),<b> to expiate the sins</b> (the word used here means to<i> be propitiated</i>, and properly used passively of the person to be rendered propitious. The expression is not a strict one: but is thus to be accounted for: God is rendered propitious to the sinner, who has forfeited His favour and incurred His wrath. But we never find in Scripture, Old Test. or New Test., any such expression as<i> “the Father was propitiated concerning our sins by the death of His Son;”</i> or as this,<i> “Christ propitiated God</i> (or,<i> ‘the wrath of God’</i>)<i> by His blood:”</i> never,<i> “God was reconciled to us.”</i> “As the Old Test. nowhere says, that sacrifice propitiated God’s wrath, lest it should be thought that sacrifice was an act, by which, as such, man influenced God to shew him grace,—so also the New Test. never says that the sacrifice of Christ propitiated God’s wrath, lest it may be thought that it was an act anticipatory of God’s gracious purpose,—which obtained, and so to speak, forced from God previously reluctant, without His own concurrence, grace instead of wrath.” Delitzsch. To understand this rightly, is all-important to any right holding of the doctrine of the Atonement. This then is not said: but the sinner is [improperly, as far as the<i> use of the word</i> is concerned] said on his part, to be<i> propitiated</i>, to be brought into God’s favour; and if the sinner, then that on account of which he is a sinner, viz. his sin. The word here is used of Him who, by His<i> propitiation</i>, brings the sinner into God’s favour, i.e. makes propitiation for, expiates, the sin. The Death of Christ being the necessary opening and condition of this propitiation,—the propitiation being once for all consummated by the sacrifice of His death, and all sin by that sacrifice expiated, we must of necessity determine [against the Socinian view of Christ’s High Priesthood, which again and again come before us in this commentary] that His High Priesthood was, strictly speaking, begun, as its one chief work in substance was accomplished, here below, during His time of suffering. That it is still continued in heaven, and indeed finds its highest and noblest employ there, is no reason against this view. The accomplished his sacrifice, before he went within the veil to sprinkle the blood: though it was that sprinkling of the blood by which the atonement was actually made, as it is by the Spirit’s application of Christ’s atoning blood to the heart of each individual sinner that he is brought into reconciliation with God) of the people (again, the Jewish people, compare Matt. i. 21: Luke i. 68, 77; ii. 10. “Why did not he say, the sins of<i> the world</i>, but, of<i> the people?</i> because then the relation of the Lord was to the Jews only, and He came especially on their account, that their salvation might precede the salvation of the rest: notwithstanding that the converse really happened.” Theophylact).
