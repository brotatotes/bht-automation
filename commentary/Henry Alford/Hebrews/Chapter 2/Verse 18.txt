<b> 18.]</b> Explanation, how the<b> being like His brethren in all things</b> has answered the end.<i> that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest.</i><b> For He Himself having been tempted in that which He hath suffered, He is able to succour them that are</b> (now)<b> tempted</b> (the construction is much doubted. The sentence is open to several logical arrangements and consequent renderings. 1)<i> “for He is able to help those who are tried by the same temptations in which His own sufferings have consisted:”</i> 2)<i> “for having been Himself tempted in that which He hath suffered,</i>&c.:” 3)<i> “for in that which He hath suffered when He himself was tempted, He is able to succour those who are tempted</i> [<i>in the same</i>]<i>:”</i> 4)<i> “for in that in which He himself was tempted and hath suffered He is able,</i>&c.” Of these I much prefer 2); because (a) it keeps together the prominent members of the logical comparison, between Him being tempted and us being tempted, giving<i> “in that which He hath suffered”</i> as a qualification of<i> being tempted,</i> and thus explaining wherein His temptation consisted. Nor (b) is it at all open to Lünemann’s objection, that it limits the power of Christ to help, to those things merely in which He himself has suffered and been tempted: stating as it does generally the fact<i> being tempted</i>, and then specifying in what, viz.<i> in that which He hath suffered.</i> It also (c) corresponds exactly in construction with the similar sentence ch. v. 8,—<i> “He learned, from the things which He suffered, obedience,”</i> in supplying an object after<i> suffered</i>. And (a) it seems more natural that an object should be required after the perfect, than that it should be used absolutely. After ‘He hath suffered,’ we enquire, ‘What?’—after ‘He suffered,’— ‘When?’ Christ's whole sufferings were a<i> temptation</i> in the sense here intended: see ch. iv. 15; James i. 2. The rendering given in the A.V., making<i> “in that”</i> a conjunction of inference, meaning<i> “because,”</i> seems to be quite unauthorized. The ability<b> to succour</b> here is not to be understood of the power to which the Lord has been exalted through death and suffering to be a Prince and a Saviour,—which is not here in question: but of the power of sympathy which he has acquired by personal experience of our sufferings. As God, He knows what is in us: but as man, He feels it also. And by this, wonderful as it may seem, He has acquired a fresh power, that of sympathy with us, and, in consequence, of helping us.
