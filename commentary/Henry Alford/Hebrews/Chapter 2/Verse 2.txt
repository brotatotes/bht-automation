<b> 2.] For</b> (introduces an argument [vv. 2–4]<i> from the less to the greater.</i> The law was introduced by the mere subordinate messengers of God, but was enforced with strict precision: how much more shall they be punished who reject that Gospel, which was brought in by the Son of God Himself, and continues to be confirmed to us by God’s present power)<b> if the word which was spoken by means of angels</b> (i. e. the law of Moses. The cooperation of angels in the giving of the law at Sinai was not merely a rabbinical notion, but is implied in both the Old and New Testaments. There can consequently be little doubt that the Writer, in mentioning<b> the word spoken by angels,</b> had reference to the law of Moses, and not, as some think, to the scattered messages which were, at different times in Old Test. history, delivered by angels. It has been sometimes supposed that the<b> angels</b> spoken of here are not angels, but merely human messengers. Chrysostom says, “Some think that Moses is pointed at: but not with justice: for the writer speaks of many<i> angels</i>.” Bleck remarks that the Writer would hardly have used this argument of depreciating contrast, had he regarded the Law as given either to Moses or to the people by the direct ministry of the Son of God Himself)<b> was made</b> (<i> “became,”</i> on being thus spoken by angels)<b> binding</b> (<i>firm, ratified: “stedfast,”</i> as A.V.: as applied to commands,<i>—imperative,—</i>not to be violated with impunity),<b> and every transgression</b> (overstepping of its ordinances, or more properly walking alongside of, and therefore not in, the path which it marked out)<b> and disobedience</b> (the relation of these two words to one another in point of sense seems accordingly to be, that<b> transgression</b> denotes the ontward act of transgression of the Law, the practical withstanding of its precepts, while<b> disobedience</b> occurs when we fulfil not, and have no mind to fulfil, the precepts of the Law: the former expresses, viewed<i> from without,</i> more something positive, the latter something negative, while at the same time it regards more the disposition of the man.

To the single instances of punishment which overtook the offenders against the law, or, as Grotius suggests, to the general punishment of the whole people’s unbelief, as in ch. iii. 8; iv. 11; xii. 21, and see 1 Cor. x. 6 ff.? I should be disposed to think, to the former: such penalties as are denounced in Deut. xxxii. 35, and indeed attached to very many of the Mosaic enactments: as Owen: “The law was so established, that the transgression of it, so as to disannul the terms and conditions of it, had by divine constitution the punishment of death temporal, or excision, appointed unto it”);
