<b> 3.] how shall we</b> (emphatic: including Christians in general, all who have received the message of salvation in the manner specified below)<b> escape, if we have neglected so great</b> ( “<i>that</i> was a giving of laws only, but the other brought the grace of the Spirit, and the taking away of sins, and the announcement of the kingdom of heaven, and the promise of immortality: so that he had some reason to say<b> so great</b>.” Theodore of Mopsuestia)<b> salvation</b> (as in ch. i. 14);<b> the which</b> (equivalent to<i> ‘seeing that it’</i>),<b> having begun to be spoken by means of</b> (he was the instrument in this ease, as the angels in the other; but both, law and gospel, came at first hand not from the mediators, but from God)<b> the Lord (by the Lord</b> is to be joined with the whole,<b> having began to be spoken,</b> not with<b> spoken</b> only.<b> The Lord,</b> as Bleck remarks, has here an especial emphasis setting forth the majesty and sovereignty of Christ: “He Himself, the Master of angels, first brought to us the doctrine of salvation,” Theodoret),<b> was confirmed</b> (see Mark xvi. 19, where the word is used exactly in the same sense and reference. It seems to be used to correspond to<i> became binding</i> (or firm, the cognate adjective to this verb<i> confirmed</i>) above, signifying a ratification of the Gospel somewhat correspondent to that there predicated of the law: as also<b> spoken</b> here answers to<i> spoken</i> there)<b> unto us by those who heard</b> (<i>it?</i> or<i> Him?</i> In the sense, the difference will be but little: in either ease, those pointed at will be, as Theodoret, “those who were parakers of the apostolic grace:” the “eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word” of Luke i. 2. From the usage, however, of the Writer himself, I prefer understanding “it:” compare ch. iii. 16; iv. 2; xii. 19)<b> it</b> (on the evidence furnished by this verse as to the Writer of the Epistle, see Introduction,§i. parr. 130 ff.);<b> God also bearing witness to it</b> (Chrysostom remarks: “How then was it confirmed? What if those who heard it, themselves feigned it? To remove the shame of this, and to shew that the grace came not from men, he adds that God also bore witness. For had they been the inventors, God would not have borne witness to them: but now they are witnesses, and God is witness besides. We have not simply believed them, but have been helped by signs and wonders: so that we have not believed them, but God Himself”),<b> with signs and wonders</b> (Bleck remarks: “As regards the relation of the two expressions to each other in their combination here, as divine confirmations of human testimony, it is this: a<b> sign</b> is a more general and wider idea than a<b> wonder</b>. Every<i> sign,</i> religiously considered, is also a<i> wonder,</i> but not always vice versa. A<b> wonder</b> always includes the idea of something marvellous, something extraordinary in itself, betokens something which by its very occurrence raises astonishment, and cannot be explained from the known laws of nature. On the other hand, a<b> sign</b> is each and every thing whereby a person, or a saying and assertion, is witnessed to as true, and made manifest: and thus it<i> may</i> be something, which, considered in and of itself, would appear an ordinary matter, causing no astonishment, but which gets its character of striking and supernatural from the connexion into which it is brought with something else, e.g. from a heavenly messenger having previously referred to some event which he could not have foreseen by mere natural knowledge. But it may also be a<i> wonder,</i> properly so called. Still, it is natural to suppose that the biblical writers, using so often as they do the words together, did not on every occasion bear in mind the distinction, but under the former word thought also of events which of themselves would be extraordinary and marvellous appearances”),<b> and various miraculous powers, and distributions</b> (this substantive is that derived from the verb used in Rom. xii. 3; 1 Cor. vii. 17; 2 Cor. x. 13)<b> of the Holy Spirit</b> (is this genitive descriptive of the<i> object distributed,</i> or of the<i> subject distributing?</i> It does not follow that this will be ruled by the reference of the possessive pronoun<b> His</b> below. It seems much more natural to refer this pronoun to God, the primary subject of the sentence, than to the Holy, who is merely introduced in the course of it. And if it be once granted that<b> His</b> refers to God, we should have, on the supposition of the<i> subjective</i> genitive an awkwardly complicated sense, hardly consistent with the assertion of absolute sovereignty so prominently made in the following clause. I take then the genitive, with most commentators, as<i> objective,</i> and the Holy Spirit as that which<i> is distributed,</i> according to God’s will, to each man according to his measure and kind. The declaration in John iii. 34, of Him whom God sent,<i> “He giveth not the Spirit by measure,”</i> speaks of the same<i> giving,</i> but of its unmeasured fulness, as imparted to our glorious Head, not of its fragmentary distribution to us, the imperfect and limited members),<b> according to His</b> (God’s: see above)<b> will</b> (it is best to refer this clause, not to the whole sentence preceding, nor to the two clauses,<i> various miraculous powers</i> and<i> distributions of the Holy Spirit,</i> as Bleek and Lünemann, but to the last of these only, agreeably to 1 Cor. xii. 11, and to the free and sovereign agency implied in the word<i> distributions</i>. See on the whole sense, Acts v. 32)?
