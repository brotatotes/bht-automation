<b> 5.]</b> The proposition stated.<b> For</b> (the connexion is with the sentence immediately preceding, i.e. with vv. 2–4. That former<i> word</i> was spoken by angels: it carried its punishment for neglect of it: much more shall this<i> salvation,</i> spoken by.... &c., confirmed by.... &c. FOR this whole state of things, induced by the proclamation of that salvation, is not subjected to angels, but to Christ, the Son of God. Then the fact that it is to MAN, and to Him AS MAN, that it is subjected, is brought in, and a new subject thus grafted on the old one of His superiority to the angels)<b> not to angels</b> (<i> “angels”</i> stands in the place of emphasis, as contrasted with<i> “man”</i> below)<b> did he subject</b> (viz., at the date of the same. The subjection of this present natural world to the holy angels, as its administrators, is in several places attested in Scripture, and was a very general matter of belief among the Jews. In Deut. xxxii. 8, we read in the Septuagint,<i> “When the Highest distributed nations, as He dispersed the sons of men, He set the boundaries of nations according to the number</i><i> of the angels of God.”</i> There, it is true, the Hebrew text has, as A.V., “according to the number of the children [more properly,<i> the sons</i>, in the stricter sense] of Israel.” Origen (or his translator) says, “According to the number of His angels, or, as we read in other copies, according to the number of the sons of Israel.” But the<i> doctrine</i> rests on passages about which there can be no such doubt. See Dan. x. 13, 20, 21; xii. 1, for this commital of kingdoms to the superintendence of angels: Rev. ix. 11; xvi. 5, for the same as regards<br><br> the natural elements: Matt. xviii. 10, as regards the guardianship of individuals: Rev. i. 20&c., for that of churches [for so, and not of chief bishops, is the name to be understood: see note there]. See also Dan. iv. 13. In the apocryphal and rabbinical writings we find the same idea asserted, and indeed carried out into minute details. So in Ecclus. xvii. 17,<i> “In the division of the nations of the whole earth he set a ruler over every people: but Israel is the Lord’s portion.”</i> The rabbinical authorities may be found in Bleck and Eisenmenger. See also a very elaborate article— “Engel”—by Böhme, in Herzog’s Encyclȯpädie: and testimonies to the view of the early church from Eusebius, Justin Martyr, Irenæus, Athenagoras, and Clement of Alexandria, in Whitby’s note. The idea then of subjection of the world to angels was one with which the readers of this Epistle were familiar)<b> the world</b><b> to come</b> (the reference of this expression has been variously given by expositors. 1) Many imagine it to refer to the world which is, strictly speaking,<i> to come,</i> as distinguished from this present world. This meaning will hardly tally with the context here. Though it might be said that the future life, being the<i> completion</i> of the state of salvation by Christ, might very well here he spoken of as the subject of the present discourse. 2) Some have supposed a direct allusion to ch. i. 6. But certainly in this case the verb would have been past: “of which we<i> spoke;”</i> and besides, the addition of the epithet to come sufficiently distinguishes it from the mere inhabited world, in the other place. 3) Others again have thought of<i> heaven</i>, which is to us future, because we are not yet admitted to its joys, But this again would not agree with the context. 4) The most probable account to be given is that the phrase represents the Hebrew expression,<i> “the age to come”</i> [see note on ch. i. 1], and imports the whole new order of things brought in by Christ,—taking its rise in His life on earth, and having its completion in His reign in glory. This last-mentioned view is by far the best, agreeing as it does with the connexion, for he has been speaking of the gospel above, with the ordinary way of speaking, and with the whole subject of the Epistle.<i> All</i> reference to the future need not be excluded: we Christians are so eminently “prisoners of hope,” that the very mention of such a designation would naturally awaken a thought of the glories to come: but this reference must not be pressed as having any prominence),<b> of which we are speaking</b> (which forms the subject of our present argument: viz. that urged in vv. 1–4, The sense is strictly<i> present;</i> not past, nor future. Bleek has here some excellent remarks: “As regards the whole thought, the non-subjection of the new order of the world to angels, it respects partly what is already present, partly what we have yet to wait for. Certainly, here and there in the New Test. history angels are mentioned: but they come in only as transitory appearances, to announce or to execute some matter which is specially entrusted to them: they never appear as essential agents in the introduction of the kingdom of God, either in general, or in particular: they do not descend on earth as preaching repentance, or preparing men to be received into God’s kingdom. This is done by<i> men</i>, first and chiefly by Him who is Son of Man<i> par excellence</i>, and after Him by the disciples whom He prepared for the work. Even the miraculous conversion of Paul is brought about, not by angels, but by the appearing of the Lord Himself. Our author has indeed, in ch. i. 14, designated the angels as fellow-workers in the salvation of men: but only in a serving capacity, never as working or imparting salvation by independent agency, as does the Son of Man in the first place, and then in a certain degree His disciples also. So that we cannot speak with any truth of a subjection of this new order of things to the angels, Rather, even by what we see at present, does it appear to be subjected to the Redeemer Himself. And this will ever more and more be the ease; for,—according to the prophetic declaration of the Psalm, the whole world shall be put under His feet [ver 8]. Thus, by reminding them of the will of God declared in the holy Scriptures, does the Writer meet at the same time the objections of those of his readers and countrymen, to whom perhaps withdrawal of the agency of the angels with the introduction and growing realization of the new order of things might appear an important defect”).
