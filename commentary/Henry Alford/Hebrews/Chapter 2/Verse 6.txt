<b> 6.] But</b> (introduces a contrast to a preceding negative sentence frequently in our Epistle: compare ch. iv, 13. 15; ix. 12; x. 27; xii. 13. An ellipsis follows it, to be supplied in the thought, “it is far otherwise, for”....)<b> one somewhere</b> (no inference can be drawn from this indefinite manner of citation, either that the writer was quoting from memory, as some think, or that he did not know who was the author of the Psalm, as others. Rather may we say that it shews he was writing for readers familiar with the Scriptures, and from whom it might well be expected that they would recognize the citation without further specification. He certainly is not quoting from memory, seeing that the words agree exactly with the Septuagint: and Ps. viii. both in the Hebrew and Septuagint has a superscription indicating that it was written by David. We can hardly infer with some that the Writer meant to express his feeling that the Old Test. books had no human authors, but God Himself: for in this ease the personal designation<i> some one</i> would hardly have been used, but a passive construction,<i> “it is written,”</i> or the like, adopted instead)<b> testified, saying</b> (this seems the proper place for a few remarks on the sense of the citation which follows, and on the connexion of thought in the rest of the chapter. The general import of the<i> eighth Psalm</i> may be described as being, to praise Jehovah for His glory and majesty, and His merciful dealing with and exaltation of mankind. All exposition which loses sight of this general import, and attempts to force the Psalm into a direct and exclusive prophecy of the personal Messiah, goes to conceal its true prophetic sense, and to obscure the force and beauty of its reference to Him. This has been done by Bleck and others, who have made “the Son of Man” a direct title here of Christ. It is MAN who in the Psalm is spoken of, in the common and most general sense: the care taken by God of<i> Him,</i> the lordship given to<i> him</i>, the subjection of God’s works to him. This high dignity he lost, but this high dignity he has regained, and possesses potentially in all its fulness and glory, restored, and for ever secured to him: How? and by whom? By one of his own race, the MAN Christ Jesus. Whatever high and glorious things can be said of man, belong<i> of proper right</i> to Him only,<i> in proper person</i> to Him only, but derivatively to us His brethren and members. And this is the great key to the interpretation of all such sayings as these: whatever belongs to man by the constitution of his nature, belongs superlatively to that MAN, who is the constituted HEAD of man’s nature, the second Adam, who has more than recovered all that the first Adam lost. To those who clearly apprehend and firmly hold this fundamental doctrine of Christianity, the interpretation of ancient prophecy, and the New Test. application of Old Test. sayings to Christ, become a far simpler matter than they ever can be to others. And so here, it is to MAN, not to angels, that the “world to come” is subjected. This is the argument: and, as far as the end of ver. 8, it is carried on with reference to<i> man</i>, properly so called. There is<i> here</i> as yet no personal reference to our Lord, who is first introduced, and that in His lower personal human Name, at ver. 9. This has been missed, and thus confusion introduced into the argument, by the majority of Commentators. To hold that our Lord is from the first intended by<i> “man”</i> and<i> “the son of man”</i> here, is to disturb altogether the logical sequence, which runs thus: “It is<i> not to angels</i> that He has subjected the latter dispensation, but to<i> man</i>. Still we do not see man in possession of this sovereignty. No; but we do see Jesus, whose humiliation fulfilled the conditions of manhood, crowned with glory and honour, and thus constituted the Head of our race, so that His death and sufferings were our deliverance and our perfecting. And for this to be so, the sanctifier and the sanctified must be all of one race.” And the rest of the chapter is spent in laying forth with inimitable beauty and tenderness tho necessity and effect of Jesus being thus made like us. The whole process of this second chapter stands without parallel for tender persuasiveness amidst the strictest logical coherence. And yet both of these are concealed and spoiled, unless we take these words of the Psalm, and the argument founded on them, of man generally, and then, and not till then, of Jesus, as man like ourselves),<b> What is man</b> (some have understood this to mean, “How great, how noble, is man; who even amongst the immensity of all these heavenly works of God, yet is remembered and visited of Him;” but against this are the two words here used in the Hebrew, both betokening man on his lower side, of weakness and inferiority. There can be little doubt that the ordinary view is right—not<i> how great,</i> but<i> how little,</i> is man. This agrees far better also with the wonder expressed at God’s thinking of and visiting him, below),<b> that thou art mindful of him</b> (i. e. objectively,—as shewn by Thy care of him)? or (in the Hebrew<i> “and”</i> is here doubtless substituted for<b> or</b> by the Septuagint, to indicate that the second member of the parallelism does not point to another subject additional to the first)<b> the son of man</b> (proceeding on the same view as that given above, it would be irrelevant here to enter on an enquiry as to the application of this title to our Lord, by others, and by Himself,—inasmuch as it is not here appropriated to Him, but used of any and every son of Adam. It is true, our thoughts at once recur to Him on reading the words—but, if we are following the train of thought, only as their ulterior, not as their immediate, reference),<b> that Thou visitest him?</b>
