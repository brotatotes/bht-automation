<p><strong> 7</strong> .] <strong> Thou madest him a little lower than the angels</strong> (Heb., וַתִּחַסְּרֵהוּ מְעִט מֵאֱלֹהִים : which is literally, “Thou lettest him be little inferior to God.” “ חָסֵר in Kal betokens ‘to be without,’ ‘to fall short of,’ and has, like all other verbs of abounding and wanting, the thing wanted in the accusative: see Gesen. § 135. 3. b. The causative Pihel, ‘to make or let want,’ takes consequently a double accusative, of the person (here ־הוּ ) and of the thing (here מְעִט ): see Gesen. § 136. 1. מִן is usually taken comparative, ‘ <em> in comparison of God</em> :’ according to Hupfeld, it is properly partitive, ‘ <em> of God</em> :’ of the attributes which constitute the essence of God.” De Wette: and thus also Calvin: “Tot decoribus ornatos esse dicit ut eorum conditio divina et cœlesti gloria non longe sit inferior.” But when De W. goes on, in treating of מְעַט , to say that some understand it, <em> with the LXX</em> , of <em> time</em> , and refers to Heb 2:6-7 to confirm this, I must venture to doubt, though I find the same very generally assumed (e. g. by Calvin, “Videtur apostolus verba trahere in diversum sensum quam intellexerit David. Nam βραχύ τι videtur ad tempus referre ut sit <em> paulisper</em> , et imminutionem intelligit quum exinanitus fuit Christus, et gloriam ad resurrectionis diem restringit, quum David generaliter extendat ad totam hominis vitam.” And then he defends this method of quotation on the ground of there being “nihil incommodi si allusiones in verbis quærat ad ornandam præsentem causam.” Similarly Schlichting, Grotius, Hammond, Limborch, and most of the moderns: and, maintaining the sense of <em> time</em> in the <em> Psalm also</em> , Beza, Gerhard, Calov., Peirce, Michaelis, al.), whether this is so certain after all. The expression <strong> βραχύ τι</strong> is used both in the classics and in Hellenistic Greek, just as much of space and quantity, as of time; as the following examples (besides reff.) will shew, gathered from Wetst., Bleek, and from various indices: Hippocrat. de Natur. Hominum i., τὸ μὲν ὅλον βιβλίον σχεδὸν εἰς χ ʹ στίχους ἢ βραχύ τι ἧττον ἐκτεταμένον : Thucyd. i. 63, βραχὺ μέν τι προῆλθον ὡς βοηθήσοντες : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+16:1">2 Kings 16:1</span> , καὶ Δαυεὶδ παρῆλθε βραχύ τι ἀπὸ τῆς Ῥώς : Galen, de Usu Part. xiv., ἐπειδὴ ἐν τῇ πρώτῃ διαπλάσει βραχύ τι πλημμεληθῇ : id. de Facult. Med. Simpl. v., ὑπερβάλλουσιν βραχύ τι ῥητίνῃ κ . πίττᾳ : ib. vi., φαίνεται μὲν γὰρ ἐν αὐτῇ βραχύ τι τὸ δριμύ , πλεῖστον δὲ τὸ πικρόν . Also Plato, Legg. x. p. 906 B, βραχύ δέ τι καὶ τῆς ἄν τις τῶν τοιούτων ἐνοικοῦν ἡμῖν σαφὲς ἴδοι . It is used of <em> time</em> in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:58">Luke 22:58</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:34">Acts 5:34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:28">Acts 27:28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:17">Isaiah 57:17</span> . This being the case, I do not see why it should be at once set down that the LXX or our Writer necessarily referred it to time, either here or in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span> ; see below. So also Kuinoel, Heinrichs, Wahl, and Bretschneider. The only point remaining for discussion is <strong> ἀγγέλους</strong> , the LXX rendering of אֱלֹהִים , and the meaning understood also by the Chaldee paraphrast. The best Hebrew scholars seem to agree that it represents, not the personal God, but the abstract qualities of Godhead, in which all that is divine, or immediately connected with the Deity, is included. This, as Hupfeld himself confesses, the angels may well be, in so far as they may be called אֱלֹהִים , or בְּנֵי אֱלֹהִים . If so, then the rendering of the LXX and our text is, though not exhaustive of the original, yet by no means an inaccurate one. The angelic nature, being the lowest of that which is divine and heavenly, marks well the terminus just beneath which man is set. And it must be remarked, that the stress of the argument here is not on this mention of the angels, but on the assertion of the sovereignty of man. The verb <strong> ἐλαττοῦν</strong> is in frequent classical use: see Palm and Rost’s Lex.: and notice the parallel from Philo in reff.): <strong> thou crownedst him with glory and honour</strong> (I must remind the reader of what has been said before; that the quotation is adduced <em> here</em> not of the Messiah but of <em> man</em> , and that on this the whole subsequent argument depends. With this view vanish the difficulties which have been raised about the original and the here-intended meaning of this clause. It is, in fact, a further setting forth of the preceding one. Man, who was left not far behind the divine attributes themselves, was also invested with kingly majesty on earth, put into the place of God Himself in sovereignty over the world. That this has only been realized in the man Jesus Christ is not brought out till below, and forms the central point of the argument. Hupfeld remarks, that כָּבוֹד וְהָדָר , here rendered δόξῃ κ . τιμῇ , is a common expression for the divine majesty, and thence for the kingly, as a reflection of the divine: and the crowning represents the kingly majesty, with which man is adorned as with a kingly crown: Calv., “Decoratum esse honoris insignibus quæ non longe a divino fulgore absint”):</p>
