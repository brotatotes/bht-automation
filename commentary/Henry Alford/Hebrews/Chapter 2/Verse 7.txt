<b> 7.] Thou madest Him a little lower than the angels</b> (literally, in the Hebrew, “Thou lettest him be little inferior to God.” The best Hebrew scholars seem to agree that the word “God” here represents not the personal God, but the abstract qualities of Godhead, in which all that is divine, or immediately connected with the Deity, is included. If so, then the rendering of the Septuagint and our text is, though not exhaustive of the original, yet by no means an inaccurate one. The angelic nature, being the lowest of that which is divine and heavenly, marks well the terminus just beneath which man is set. And it must be remarked that the stress of the argument here is not on this mention of the angels, but on the assertion of the sovereignty of man.
