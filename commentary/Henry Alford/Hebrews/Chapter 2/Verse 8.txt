<p><strong> 8</strong> .] <strong> thou didst put</strong> (the Heb. is <em> perfect</em> : on which Hupfeld remarks, “The imperf. is at first continued from the foregoing verses, but in the concluding sentence all is finished with the perfect שַׁתָּה , and treated as a standing arrangement and permanent ordering of things: ‘all things hast thou put under his feet.’ ” So that our E. V., though imperfectly representing the Greek, is true to the original Heb.) <strong> all things under his feet</strong> (these words form in the Heb. and LXX the second member of a parallelism, the first of which, καὶ κατέστησας αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σου , is found indeed in our rec. text, but (see var. readd.) must be omitted on critical principles. The probable cause why the Writer omitted it, has been discussed by Bleek. He thinks that it was unnecessary to the argumentation, the latter clause expressing more definitely the same thing. This he gathers, believing the whole to apply to our Saviour: but the same will hold good on our understanding of the passage also.
	</p>
<p>The words themselves are plain. Universal dominion is bestowed on man by his constitution as he came from God. That that bestowal has never yet been realized, is the next step of the argument: the Redeemer being at present kept out of sight, but by and by to be introduced as the real fulfiller of this high destiny of man, and on that account, incarnate in man’s nature. It is, as Ebrard remarks, astonishing that a thorough Commentator like Bleek should have so entirely misread and misunderstood the logical connexion of so clear a passage: while he himself confesses, that it looks as if the Person were first introduced in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span> , to whom <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6-7">Hebrews 2:6-7</span> , have been pointing: and yet denies that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6">Hebrews 2:6</span> f. ἄνθρωπος can mean ‘mankind.’ Besides all other objections, on Bleek’s view, the question τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος κ . τ . λ . loses all appropriate meaning. The connexion was first laid out by Hofmann, Weissag. u. Erfüll. ii. 23 ff.: Schriftbeweis i. 185 188; ii. 1. 38 ff., and is adopted by Ebrard and Delitzsch).
	</p>
<p><strong> For</strong> (Bleek thinks that the <strong> γάρ</strong> rather repeats the former γάρ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:5">Hebrews 2:5</span> , than has any logical force of its own here. This peculiar use of γάρ , he says, is characteristic of our Epistle: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2-3">Hebrews 4:2-3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:1">Hebrews 5:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:12-13">Hebrews 7:12-13</span> ; see his vol. i. p. 330. Hofmann however protests strongly against this view (Weissag. ii. 26, &amp;c. as above), holding the <strong> γάρ</strong> to be ratiocinative, and justificative of the Psalm, as referring back to Gen 1:28 to substantiate the ὑπέταξας . But, as Delitzsch remarks, this would be but to prove <em> idem per idem</em> ; for the ύπέταξας itself necessarily refers back to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:28">Genesis 1:28</span> . He therefore prefers Bleek’s view, which is also that of Tholuck, De Wette, and Winer, that <strong> γάρ</strong> grounds, or rather begins to ground, that already asserted in Heb 2:5 ) <strong> in that he</strong> (viz. God: not the writer of the Psalm, as Heinrichs: unless indeed we are to understand ὑποτάξαι to mean εἰπεῖν ὅτι ὑποτέτακται , as St. Paul expresses it <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:27">1 Corinthians 15:27</span> ; but the other is much simpler, more analogous to usage, and more in the sense of the Psalm, which is a direct address to God) <strong> put all things</strong> ( <em> the universe</em> : not πάντα , as before, merely, but <strong> τὰ πάντα</strong> ) <strong> under him</strong> (Man, again: not, Christ: see above, and remarks at the end of the verse) <strong> He left</strong> (aor. as in E. V.; not perfect, which would be ἀφεῖκεν ) <strong> nothing</strong> (“Nec cœlestia videtur excepisse nec terrestria,” Primasius: and so Estius, al. Possibly: and in the application itself, certainly: but we can hardly say that such was his thought <em> here</em> . The idea that angels are especially here intended, has arisen from that misconception of the connexion, which I have been throughout endeavouring to meet) <strong> unsubjected</strong> (see reff. where, as in υἱοὶ ἀνυπότακτοι , Symm. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+2:12">1 Kings 2:12</span> , it is in the sense of <em> rebellious</em> . The word belongs to later Greek: we have, Arrian, Epictet. ii. 10, ταύτῃ (to the will of man) τὰ ἄλλα ὑποτεταγμένα , αὐτὴ δ ʼ ἀδούλωτον κ . <strong> ἀνυπότακτον</strong> : Porphyr. Oneirocrit. 196, <strong> ἀνυπότακτος</strong> ἔσται πᾶσιν : Philo, Quis Rer. Div. Hær. § 1, vol. i. p. 473. <strong> ἀνυποτάκτῳ</strong> φορᾷ χρῆσθαι : and in Polyb. several times, <strong> ἀνυπότακτος</strong> διήγησις , “narratio quæ non habet notitiam antecedentem in animo discentis cui ceu fundamento et basi innitatur.” Casaubon) <strong> to him: but</strong> (contrast bringing out the exception) <strong> now</strong> (‘ut nunc est:’ in the present condition of things: not strictly temporal, but as the νῦν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:16">Hebrews 11:16</span> , and the νυνί , ch. Heb 9:26 ) <strong> we see not yet</strong> (cf. on the whole, 1Co 15:24-27 ) <strong> all things</strong> ( <strong> τὰ</strong> π ., again) <strong> put under him</strong> (the αὐτῷ in all three places referring to MAN: man has not yet attained his sovereignty. That the summing up of manhood in Christ is in the Writer’s mind, is evident throughout, and that he wishes it to be before his readers’ minds also; but the gradual introduction of the humiliation and exaltation of Christ in His humanity is marred by making all this apply personally to Him. Manhood, as such, is exalted to glory and honour, and waiting for its primæval prerogative to be fully assured, but it is IN CHRIST, and in Him alone, that this is true: and in Him it is true, inasmuch as He, being of our flesh and blood, and having been Himself made perfect by sufferings, and calling us His brethren, can lead us up through sufferings into glory, freed from guilt by His sacrifice for our sins).
	</p>
<p><strong> 9</strong> ] We do not see man, &amp;c.: <strong> but</strong> ( <strong> δέ</strong> , strong contrast again: ‘ <em> but rather</em> ’ see on Heb 2:6 ) <strong> him who is made</strong> (better than ‘ <em> was</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> hath been, made</em> ;’ His humanity in its abstract position being in view) <strong> a little</strong> (not necessarily, here either, of time (as Delitzsch here, though not above): nor are we at liberty to assume such a rendering: though of course it is difficult to say, when the same phrase has two analogous meanings both applicable, as this, how far the one may have accompanied the other in the Writer’s mind) <strong> lower than (the) angels, we behold</strong> (notice the difference between the half-involuntary όρῶμεν above, the impression which our eyes receive from things around us, and the direction and intention of the contemplating eye (here, of faith: cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:19">Hebrews 3:19</span> ; Heb 10:25 ) in <strong> βλέπομεν</strong> ), ( <strong> namely</strong> ) <strong> Jesus</strong> (Lünemann is quite right against Ebrard here. The latter would take the words thus: “ <em> But we behold Jesus</em> (object) τὸν βρ . τι παρ ʼ ἀγγ . ἠλαττ . (adjectival attribute to Ἰησοῦν ), ὲστεφανωμένον (predicate).” But this would be to throw Ἰησοῦν into a position of emphasis: and would have been expressed Ἰησοῦν δὲ τὸν κ . τ . λ ., or, τὸν δὲ βρ . τ . π . ἀγ . ἠλ . Ἰησοῦν βλέπομεν . As it is, Ἰησοῦν , standing as it does behind the verb, is, as Lünem. well remarks, altogether unemphasized, and is merely an explicative addition, to make it clear who is intended by τὸν βρ . τι παρ ʼ ἀγγ . ἠλαττωμένον . So that this latter clause is the object, διὰ to ἐστεφ . (see below) the predicate, and Ἰησοῦν an appositional elucidation of the object. So Hofmann <em> now</em> , Schriftb. i. 187. Formerly he took it as Ebrard; Weissag. u. Erfüll. ii. 28. Delitzsch takes Ἰησοῦν as the object and τὸν ἠλαττωμ . κ . τ . λ . as the appositional clause. But I prefer as above: see more below), <strong> on account of his suffering of death</strong> (it has been much doubted whether these words belong, 1. to the foregoing clause, βραχύ τι παρ . ὰγγ . ἠλαττ ., or, 2. to the following, δόξῃ κ . τιμῇ ἐστεφανωμένον . The former connexion is assumed without remark by the ancient Commentators: so Origen in Joann. tom. ii. 6 (vol. iv. p. 62), ἀγγέλων ἐλάττονα διὰ τὸ πάθημα τοῦ θανάτου : Augustine, contra Maximin. ii. 25, vol. viii. (misquoted in Bleek), “Eum autem modico minus quam angelos minoratum vidimus Jesum propter passionem mortis. Non ergo propter naturam hominis, sed propter passionem mortis:” Chrys., Thdrt. (see below), (not Thl. as Bleek: see below), Beza, Schlichting, Justiniani, a-Lapide, Cameron (but interpreting it “per illud tempus quo passus est mortem”), Calov., Limborch, Owen, Michaelis, Baumgarten, Semler, Dindorf, Wakefield. And these interpret the words two ways: α . <strong> on account of the suffering of death</strong> , i. e. because He has suffered death ( οὐ τῇ φύσει τῆς θεότητος τῶν ἀγγέλων ἠλάττωται , ἀλλὰ τῷ πάθει τῆς ἀνθρωπότητος , Thdrt.), thus making <strong> βραχύ τι</strong> refer to the time of His sufferings and death, or as Chrys. ( τὸ βραχὺ αὐτῷ ἂν ἁρμόσειε … τῷ τρεῖς ἡμέρας γενομένῳ ἐν τῷ ᾅδῃ μόνας ), al., to the three days of His being in the grave: β . <strong> for the sake of the suffering of death</strong> , = εἰς τὸ πάσχειν τ . θ . So Aug [17] above, and most of the foregoing list.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [17] <em> Augustine, Bp. of Hippo</em> , 395 430
	</p>
<p>But, <strong> 2</strong> . the latter connexion, with the following clause, is adopted by Theophylact (as Thl. has been said by Bleek to maintain the other connexion, I give his note entire: σπουδάζει δεῖξαι τὰ ῥηθέντα τῷ χριστῷ προσαρμόζοντα , καὶ φησὶν ὅτι εἰ καὶ τὰ πάντα ὑπέταξεν οὔπω δοκεῖ ἁρμόζειν αὐτῷ , καίτοι ἐδείξαμεν ὅτι πάντως καὶ τοῦτο ἐκβήσεται . ἀλλ ʼ οὖν τὸ βραχύ τι ἠλαττῶσθαι παρ ʼ ἀλλέλους , τούτῳ · ἁρμόζει ἢ ἡμῖν . καὶ γὰρ ὁ μὲν τρεῖς ἡμέρας γεγονὼς ἐν τῷ ᾅδῃ ὡς ἄνθρωπος , βραχὺ ἠλάττωται τῶν ἀγγέλων , ἅτε μηδ ʼ ὅλως θανάτῳ ὑπαγομένων ἐκείνων · ἡμεῖς δὲ ἐπὶ πολὺ φθειρόμενοι , οὐ βραχὺ ἀλλὰ πάμπολυ αὐτῶν ἠλαττώμεθα . καὶ <strong> τὸ δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφανῶσθαι διὰ τὸ πάθος</strong> , ἐκείνῳ μᾶλλον ἁρμόζει ἢ ἡμῖν . πάθημα δὲ θανάτου εἰπών , τὸν ἀληθῆ θάνατον ἐδήλωσεν . οὐ φαντασία γὰρ θανάτου , ἀλλὰ πάθημα ἦν ἔνεργον . ἀνέμνησε δὲ τοῦ σταυροῦ κ . τοῦ θανάτου , ἵνα πείσῃ αὐτοὺς γενναίως φέρειν τὰς φλίψεις , εἰς τὸν διδάσκαλον ἀφορῶντας . ἀλλὰ <strong> καὶ δόξα</strong> , φησί , <strong> καὶ τιμὴ ὁ σταυρὸς αὐτῷ γέγονεν</strong> <strong> ·</strong> οὐκοῦν καὶ ὑμῖν αἱ θλίψεις κ . τὰ πάθη · τί οὖν ἀποπηδᾶτε τῶν στεφανούντων ; ἐκεῖνος ὑπὲρ σοῦ τοῦ δούλου ἔπαθε · σὺ ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀνέχῃ θλιβῆναι τοῦ δεσπότου ; Here, although he partially adopts the notion of βραχύ τι referring to the three days, it is evident both from the words which I have noted by different type, and by the application which he makes to ourselves, that he joins διὰ τὸ πάθ . τ . θ . with δόξῃ κ . τιμῇ ἐστεφανωμένον , not with the preceding clause), Luther, Calvin, Estius, Grot., Seb.-Schmidt, Bengel, Wetst., Schulz, Böhme, Kuinoel, Bleek, Tholuck, Ebrard, Lünemann, Delitzsch, al.
	</p>
<p>The question must be determined by the arrangement of the words, and by the requirements of the context. And both these seem to require the latter, not the former connexion. The words διὰ τὸ πάθ . τ . θ . are emphatic; they are taken up again in the next sentence by διὰ παθημάτων τελειῶσαι (which words themselves are a witness that suffering and exaltation, not suffering and degradation, are here connected). But emphatic they could not be in the <em> former</em> connexion, coming as they would only as an explicatory clause, after βραχύ τι παρ ʼ ἀγγ . ἠλαττωμένον . Again, the former connexion hardly satisfies the διὰ with an accusative; certainly not if the sense α ., <em> because He has suffered death</em> , be taken; and if the other, β ., we should have expected rather εἰς τὸ πάθημα τοῦ θ ., or εἰς τὸ παθεῖν τὸν θ . Whereas the latter connexion entirely satisfies the context, the sufferings of Christ being treated of as necessary to His being our perfect Redeemer: entirely also fulfils the requirements of διὰ with an accusative; wherein, which is no small consideration in its favour, it is in strict analogy with the construction in ref. Phil., γενόμενος ὑπήκοος μέχρι θανάτου , θανάτου δὲ σταυροῦ . <strong> διὸ</strong> καὶ ὁ θεὸς αὐτὸν ὑπερύψωσεν κ . τ . λ . And this connexion will be made even clearer by what will be said on the next clause, ὅπως κ . τ . λ .), <strong> crowned with glory and honour</strong> (viz. at His exaltation, when God exalted Him to His right Hand: not, as some (e. g. Hofmann, ubi supra; see also Schriftbeweis i. 271, <em> um des Todes willen ist Iesus mit der Berufsherrlichkeit und Berufsehre gekront</em> ), at His incarnation, or His establishment as Saviour of the world: see above, Heb 2:7 ): <strong> in order that</strong> (how is this <strong> ὅπως</strong> logically constructed? In answering the question, we may at once dismiss all impossible senses of ὅπως , invented to escape the difficulty: such as the supposed <em> ecbatic</em> sense, “ <em> so that</em> ” (Erasm. (paraphr.), Valck., Kuinoel, &amp;c.), “ <em> postquam</em> mortem gustavit,” Schleusner; &amp;c. &amp;c. <strong> ὅπως</strong> has no such ecbatic sense any where: and its temporal sense is altogether unexampled with the subjunctive mood. It can have here none but its constant telic sense: ‘ <em> in order that</em> .’ And as to its dependence we must have recourse to no inversions of construction, but take it simply as we find it, however difficult. It depends then on the last clause, which clause it will be best to take in its entirety, διὰ τὸ πάθημα τοῦ θανάτου δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφανωμένον . The full connexion we cannot enter into, till the three other questions arising out of our clause are disposed of: <strong> χάριτι θεοῦ</strong> <strong> </strong> <strong> ὑπὲρ παντός</strong> and <strong> γεύσηται θανάτου</strong> ) <strong> by the grace of God</strong> (here comes into question the very important various reading <strong> χωρὶς θεοῦ</strong> , the authorities for which see in the digest. That it does not owe its origin to the Nestorians, whatever use they may have made of it, is evident from Origen reading and expounding it. In his time it was the prevalent reading, the present ἐν χάριτι θεοῦ being found only ἔν τισιν ἀντιγράφοις . Theodoret here, and on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span> (see below), knew of no other reading: nor did Ambrose, nor Fulgentius. Jerome on Gal 3:10 says, “Quia Christus <em> gratia Dei</em> , sive ut in quibusdam exemplaribus legitur, <em> absque Deo</em> , pro omnibus mortuus est.” In the Greek Church, the Nestorians mostly held fast to the old reading, as favouring their views. It may be well to cite Theophylact on this point: οἱ δὲ Νεστοριανοὶ παραποιοῦντες τὴν γραφήν φασι · “ <strong> χωρὶς θεοῦ</strong> ὑπὲρ παντὸς γεύσηται θανάτου ,” ἵνα συστήσωσιν ὅτι ἐσταυρωμένῳ τῷ χριστῷ οὐ συνῆν ἡ θεότης , ἅτε μὴ καθ ʼ ὑπόστασιν αὐτῷ ἡνωμένη , ἀλλὰ κατὰ σχέσιν . πρὸς οὓς ὀρθόδοξός τις χλευάζων τὴν ἀνοησίαν αὐτῶν εἶπεν · ὅτι ἐχέτω , ὥς φατε , ἡ γραφή , καὶ οὕτως ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἐστι τὸ λεγόμενον · χωρὶς γὰρ θεοῦ ὑπὲρ παντὸς ἄλλου ἀπέθανεν ὁ κύριος , καὶ ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀλλέλων αὐτῶν , ἵνα λύσῃ τὴν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἐχθρὰν αὐτῶν καὶ χαρὰν αὐτοῖς περιποιήσηται . And similarly Œcumenius. In our copies of the Peschito this reading is not now found, but the passage runs “Nam ipse Deus per gratiam suam pro omni homine gustavit mortem” (“For He Aloha in his grace for every man hath tasted death,” Etheridge’s version): but (see digest) in certain mss., we have a combination of the readings, “Ipse enim excepto Deo per gratiam suam pro omni homine gustavit mortem,” [but this combination appears to be due to Editors only, and not to mss.] Bleek adduces, from the 8th century, Anastatius Abbas, a writer of Palestine: “Absque Deo: sola enim divina natura non egebat.” In modern times, the reading has been defended by Camerarius, Colomesius, Bengel, Ch. Fr. Schmid, Paulus, and more recently Ebrard and Baumgarten. Hofmann once defended it, Weissag. u. Erfüll. i. 92; but has now given it up; Entstehungsgeschichte, u.s.w. p. 338. By those who have adopted it, it has been interpreted three different ways: 1. as Origen ( ὑπὲρ πάντων χωρὶς θεοῦ ), Thdrt. ( πάντα γὰρ ὅσα κτιστὴν ἔχει τὴν φύσιν , ταύτης ἐδεῖτο τῆς θεραπείας · τοῦτο γὰρ εἶπεν · ὅπως χωρὶς θεοῦ ὑπὲρ παντὸς γεύσηται θανάτου . μόνη φησὶν ἡ θεία φύσις ἀνενδεής , τἄλλα δὲ πάντα τοῦ τῆς ἐνανθρωπήσεως ἐδεῖτο φαρμάκου ), Thl. and Œc. (hypothetically, see above), and Ebrard; and in a modification, Bengel and Schmid (“Omne, præter Deum, Christo subjectum est,’ Beng.: in accordance with 1Co 15:27 ). 2. as Ambrose, Fulgentius, and the Nestorians, and Colomesius (“Ut divinitate tantisper deposita, ut homo mortem subiret pro omnibus”). 3. as Paulus and Baumgarten, “forsaken of God,” as witnessed by the cry on the cross. In considering the probability of this reading, as to, α . external evidence, and, β . internal probability, it must, α . be confessed, that such instances as this, where an important reading, prevalent in the early ages, is found only in two or three of our present mss., tend considerably to shake the trustworthiness of mere manuscript evidence as to the original text of the N. T., and to enhance the testimony of those sources which are anterior to any of our present MSS., viz. the earlier Fathers. In treating of ( β ), we must deal with each of the assigned meanings separately. Of (1) it may be said, that however true in fact, the thought that Jesus died for every rational being ( παντὸς λογικοῦ as Origen), or for every thing (neut.), except God, is quite alien from the present context, where the sovereignty of MAN in the new world is the subject of man, in and through the Son of man, Jesus Christ: cf. the πολλοὺς υἱούς <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span> , τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:12">Hebrews 2:12</span> ; &amp;c. &amp;c. And as to (2), it is even more alien from the context, as it also is from the N. T. Christology. We have no analogical expression whereby to justify it, nor any safeguard against such a view being carried out at once into the bi-personality of the Nestorians. It is hardly to be imagined that the Writer here, with no end in view at all requiring such a severance of the two natures in Christ, should thus gratuitously have introduced a sentiment of the most novel and startling character. And with regard to (3) it may well be said, that we have no right to press the exclamation of our Redeemer in His agony to so bare and strong a dogmatic fact as that He really was χωρὶς θεοῦ on the cross. We no where find Himself so speaking, nor His Apostles: nay the Writer of our Epistle would be the first to testify against such an understanding of his words: cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span> , and indeed our next verse here. So that it does not seem possible to assign to the words χωρὶς θεοῦ a meaning in accordance with the demands of the context, and the analogy of Scripture. This indeed would be no argument against a reading universally and unobjectionably attested by external authorities; but where no such attestation exists, may well be brought in to guide us to a decision. If so then, and we reject χωρὶς θεοῦ , how are we to understand the rec. reading, <strong> χάριτι θεοῦ</strong> ? At all events we have strong Scripture analogy for such an expression. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:21">Galatians 2:21</span> , the Apostle’s confession of faith in the Son of God, he says, οὐκ ἀθετῶ τὴν χάριν τοῦ θεοῦ · εί γὰρ διὰ νόμου δικαιοσύνη , ἄρα χριστὸς δωρεὰν ἀπέθανεν . And in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span> , we read, συνίστησιν δὲ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ὰγάπην εἰς ἡμᾶς ( ὁ θεός ), ὅτι ἔτι ἁμαρτωλῶν ὄντων ἡμῶν χριστὸς ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ὰπέθανεν . And in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:11">Titus 2:11</span> , ἐπεφάνη γὰρ ἡ χάρις τοῦ θεοῦ σωτήριος πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις . So that, in point of meaning, no difficulty need be found in the words. It was by the love and grace, the χρηστότης and φιλανθρωπία of the Father, that all Redemption was effected, and above all that one sacrifice which was the crowning act of Redemption. Bleek’s account of the origin of the reading χωρίς in a mistake of a scribe, copying an illegible χάριτι , and Origen’s possessing this copy or one made from it, and the further progress of the reading being due to his mention of it, is perhaps a shade more probable than that mentioned in the digest, but at the same time far from satisfactory.
	</p>
<p>I may mention, as a curious instance of the helplessness of those who read Scripture in a version only, that (see Bleek) Primasius and Thom. Aquinas, in the sentence “Ut gratia dei pro omnibus gustaret mortem,” take “gratia dei” as nominative, and interpret it as a title of Christ) <strong> He might for</strong> ( <strong> ὑπέρ</strong> , ‘on behalf of,’ ‘for the benefit of:’ where this ordinary meaning of ὑπέρ suffices, that of vicariousness must not be introduced. Sometimes, as e. g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:15">2 Corinthians 5:15</span> , it is necessary. But here clearly not, the whole argument proceeding not on the vicariousness of Christ’s sacrifice, but on the benefits which we derive from His personal suffering for us in humanity; not on His substitution for us, but on His community with us) <strong> every man</strong> (is <strong> παντός</strong> neuter or masculine? and if the latter, to what to be referred? Origen (apparently, see above), Thdrt., Œc., Thl. (above), take it as neuter, and apply it either to all nature, or to all reasonable beings. The latter see discussed below. The former can hardly be here meant: for of such a doctrine, however true, there is no hint (see above on the reading χωρὶς θεοῦ , β . 1). Then taking παντός masculine, are we to understand it “ <em> for every one, angels included?</em> ” So Ebrard: but where do we find any such usage of πᾶς , absolutely put as here? And where in this chapter again is any room for the position, that Christ suffered death for angels? In the logical course of the argument, we have done with them, and are now treating of man, and of Him who was made man to be our High Priest and advocate. And therefore of none other than man can this word <strong> παντός</strong> be here meant, in accordance indeed with its universal usage elsewhere. If it be asked, why παντός rather than πάντων , we may safely say, that the singular brings out, far more strongly than the plural would, the applicability of Christ’s death <em> to each individual man</em> : and we may say that this again testifies to the sense ‘every man,’ as there would be no such reason for individualizing other rational beings, as there is for shewing that the whole nature of man, to which this promise of sovereignty is given, is penetrated by the efficacy of Christ’s death) <strong> taste of death</strong> (reff. and so <strong> γεύεσθαι</strong> frequently in the classics with other substantives, e. g. μόχθων Soph. Trach. 1103, πόνων Pind. Nem. v. 596, πένθους Eurip. Alcest. 1069, τῶν κακῶν Hecub. 379, ὀϊστοῦ , ἀκωκῆς δουρός Homer, τῆς ἀρχῆς , τῆς ἐλευθερίης Herod. iv. 147; vi. 5, but never with θανάτου . So that Bleek infers it has come into the N. T. diction from the Heb. phrase, which is not uncommonly found in the Rabbinical writings. Some have seen in the phrase an allusion to the shortness and transitoriness of the Lord’s death: so Chrys., καὶ κυρίως εἶπεν , ὑπὲρ παντὸς γεύσηται θανάτου , καὶ οὐκ εἶπεν , ἀποθάνῃ . ὥσπερ γὰρ ὄντως γευσάμενος , οὕτω μικρὸν ἐν αὐτῷ ποιήσας διάστημα , εὐθέως ἀνέστη : then, comparing Christ to a physician who first tastes his medicines to encourage the sick man to take them, adds, οὕτω καὶ ὁ χριστός , ἐπειδὴ πάντες ἄνθρωποι τὸν θάνατον ἐδεδοίκεσαν , πείθων αὐτοὺς κατατολμᾶν τοῦ θανάτου , καὶ αὐτὸς ἀπεγεύσατο αὐτοῦ , οὐκ ἔχων ἀνάγκην . And so Thl. and Œc., καλῶς δὲ τὸ γεύσηται · οὐ γὰρ ἐνέμεινε τῷ θανάτῳ , ἀλλὰ μόνον αὐτὸν τρόπον τινὰ ἀπεγεύσατο . And so many other Commentators, among whom Beza and Bengel find also the <em> verity</em> of His Death indicated in the words. But it is well answered (not by Calvin, as Bleek; for he says, “Quod Chrysostomus <em> gustare mortem</em> exponit, quasi summis labris delibare, eo quod Christus victor e morte emerserit, non refello neque improbo, quanquam nescio an adeo subtiliter loqui voluerit apostolus”), that in none of the places where the phrase appears, either in the N. T. or in the Rabbinical writings, does any such meaning appear to be conveyed. Nor again can we, as Bleek himself, understand the implication to be that Christ underwent all the <em> bitterness</em> of death. But, as θανάτου has been just before mentioned, I cannot help regarding its position here behind the verb as throwing that verb into some little prominence, as θανάτου itself is this second time in a place of insignificance. Thus viewed, the phrase falls into exact accord with the general argument of the passage, that it became Christ, in order to be the great and merciful High Priest of humanity, to be perfected through human sufferings: and it forms in fact the first mention of this idea, and prepares the way for <strong> γάρ</strong> which follows. I would say then, that γεύσηται must be regarded as slightly emphatic, and as implying the personal undergoing of death and entering into its suffering. And I doubt much, whether it will not be found that in the other passages where the phrase occurs, this personal suffering of death, though not boldly prominent, is yet within view, and agreeable to the context.
	</p>
<p>And now, having considered the three points, <strong> χάριτι θεοῦ</strong> <strong> </strong> <strong> ὑπὲρ παντός</strong> and <strong> γεύσηται θανάτου</strong> , we return again to the question of the connexion of the <strong> ὅπως</strong> , with which this clause begins. We before stated that, avoiding all tortuous and artificial arrangements, we find it dependent on the former clause <strong> διὰ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> ἐστεφανωμένον</strong> . This exaltation, being the τελείωσις (see Heb 2:10 ) of Christ, was arrived at διὰ παθημάτων , and διὰ τὸ πάθημα τοῦ θανάτου both by means of and on account of, His suffering of death. And this exaltation has made Him the divine Head of our humanity the channel of grace, and the ἀρχηγὸν τῆς σωτηρίας ἡμῶν . Without His exaltation, his death would not have been effectual. Unless he had been crowned with glory and honour, received to the right hand of the Father, and set in expectation of all things being put under his feet, His death could not have been, for every man, the expiation to him of his own individual sin. On the <em> triumphant issue</em> of His sufferings, their efficacy depends. And this I believe is what the sacred Writer meant to express. His glory was the consequence of His suffering of death; arrived at through His suffering: but the applicability of His death to every man is the consequence of His constitution in Heaven as the great High Priest, in virtue of his blood carried into the holy place, and the triumphant Head of our common humanity: which common humanity of Him and ourselves now becomes the subject of further elucidation).</p>
