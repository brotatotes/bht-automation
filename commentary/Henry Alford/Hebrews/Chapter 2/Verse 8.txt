That that bestowal has never yet been realized, is the next step of the argument: the Redeemer being at present kept out of sight, but by and by to be introduced as the real fulfiller of this high destiny of man, and on that account, incarnate in man’s nature).<b> For</b> (this<b> for</b> grounds, or rather begins to ground that already asserted in ver. 5)<b> in that he</b> (viz.
