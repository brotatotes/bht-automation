<b> 9.]</b> We do not see man, &c.<b> But</b> (strong contrast again:<i> “but rather”</i>—see on ver. 6)<b> him who is made</b> (better than<i> ‘was,’</i> or<i> ‘hath been, made;’</i> His humanity in its abstract position being in view)<b> a little</b> (not necessarily, here either, of time [a little while]: nor are we at liberty to assume such a rendering: though of course it is difficult to say, when the same phrase has two analogous meanings both applicable, as this, how far the one may have accompanied the other in the Writer’s mind)<b> lower than (the) angels, we behold</b> (notice the difference between the half-involuntary words<i> “we see”</i> above, the impression which our eyes receive from things around us,—and the direction and intention of the contemplating eye [here, of faith: ch. iii. 19; x. 25] in this word,<b> we behold), (namely) Jesus, on account of his suffering of death</b> (it has been much doubted whether these words belong (I.) to the foregoing clause,<i> “made a little lower than the angels,”</i> or, (II.) to the following,<i> “crowned with glory and honour.”</i> The former connexion is assumed without remark by the ancient Commentators, and by several moderns. And these interpret the words two ways: 1)<b> on account of the suffering of death</b> [i. e.<i> because He has</i> suffered death],—thus making<i> “a little (while)”</i> refer to the time of His sufferings and death, or, Chrysostom and others, to the three days of His being in the grave: 2)<b> for the sake of the suffering of death</b>,—so that He might suffer death. So Augustine and most of the ancients. But (II.) the latter connexion, with the following clause, is adopted by Theophylact, Luther, Calvin, and many others. The arrangement of the words, and the requirements of the context,<b> on account of the suffering of death,</b> both seem to require the latter, not the former connexion. The words are emphatic; they are taken up again in the next sentence by<i> ‘made perfect by sufferings’</i> [which words themselves are a witness that suffering and exaltation, not suffering and degradation, are here connected]. But emphatic they could not be in the<i> former</i> connexion, coming as they would only as an explicatory clause, after<i> “made a little lower than the angels.”</i> Again, the latter connexion entirely satisfies the context, the sufferings of Christ being treated of as necessary to His being our perfect Redeemer. And this connexion will be made even clearer by what will he said on the next clause),<b> crowned with glory and honour</b> (viz. at His exaltation, when God exalted Him to His right Hand: not, as some, at His incarnation, or His establishment as Saviour of the world: see above, ver. 7);<b> in order that</b> (how is this logically constructed? It depends on the last clause, which clause it will be best to take in its entirety,<i> “on account of His suffering of death crowned with glory and honour.”</i> The full connexion we cannot enter into, till the three other questions arising out of our clause are disposed of:<b> by the grace of God,—for every man,—and, that He should taste death) by the grace of God</b> (how is this to be understood? At all events we have strong Scripture analogy for such an expression. In Gal. ii. 21, the Apostle’s confession of faith in the Son of God, he says,<i> “I do not make void the grace of God; for if righteousness be by the law, then Christ died without cause.”</i> And in Rom. v. 8, we read,<i> “God giveth proof of His own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”</i> And in Titus ii. 11,<i> “The grace of God was manifested, bringing salvation to all men.”</i> So that, in point of meaning, no difficulty need be found in the words. It was by the love and grace, the<i> kindness</i> and<i> love towards men</i> of the Father, that all Redemption was effected, and above all that One Sacrifice which was the crowning act of Redemption. The remarkable various reading (see margin) is discussed at length in the notes to my Greek Testament. I have there concluded, that it does not seem possible to assign to the words<i> “except God,”</i> or,<i> “without God,”</i> a meaning in accordance with the demands of the context, and the analogy of Scripture. This indeed would be no argument against a reading universally and unobjectionably attested by external authorities; but where no such attestation exists, may well be brought in to guide us to a decision)<b> He might for</b> ( ‘on behalf of,’ ‘for the benefit of:’ where this ordinary meaning of the preposition suffices, that of vicariousness must not be introduced. Sometimes, as e.g., 2 Cor. v. 15, it is necessary. But here clearly not, the whole argument proceeding not on the vicariousness of Christ’s sacrifice, but on the benefits which we derive from His personal suffering for us in humanity; not on His substitution for us, but on His community with us)<b> every man</b> (in the original the word may be neuter or masculine; every<i> thing</i>, or every<i> man</i>. If the latter, to what is it to be referred? Origen and others take it as neuter, and apply it either to all nature, or to all reasonable beings. The latter see discussed below. The former can hardly be here meant: for of such a doctrine, however true, there is no hint. Then taking the adjective masculine, are we to understand it<i> “for every one, angels included?”</i> So Ebrard: but where do we find any such usage of<i> “all,”</i> or<i> “every,”</i> absolutely as here? And where in this chapter again is any room for the position, that Christ suffered death for angels? In the logical course of the argument, we have done with them, and are now treating of man, and of Him who was made man to be our High Priest and advocate. And therefore of none other than man can this word<i> “every one”</i> be here meant, in accordance indeed with its universal usage elsewhere. If it be asked, why<i> every man</i> rather than<i> all men</i>, we may safely say, that the singular brings out, far more strongly than the plural would, the applicability of Christ’s death<i> to each individual man:</i> and we may say that this again testifies to the sense<i> “every man,”</i> as there would be no such reason for individualizing other rational beings, as there is for showing that the whole nature of man, to which this promise of sovereignty is given, is penetrated by the efficacy of Christ’s death)<b> taste of death</b> (some have seen in the phrase an allusion to the shortness and transitoriness of the Lord's death: so Chrysostom, “He properly said<i> should taste death,</i> and not,<i> should die</i>. For as if really only<i> tasting</i> it, He made so little stay in it, and immediately arose:” then, comparing Christ to a physician who first tastes his medicines to encourage the sick man to take them, adds, “So also Christ, since all men had ever been afraid of death, to persuade them to be bold against it, Himself tasted it, having no benefit so to do.” So also many other Commentators, among whom Beza and Bengel find also the<i> verity</i> of His Death indicated in the words. But it is well answered, that in none of the places where the phrase appears, either in the New Test. or in the rabbinical writings, does any such meaning appear to be conveyed. Nor again can we, as Bleek, understand the implication to be that Christ underwent all the<i> bitterness</i> of death. But the phrase falls into exact accord with the general argument of the passage, that it became Christ, in order to be the great and merciful High Priest of humanity, to be perfected through human sufferings: and it forms in fact the first mention of this idea, and prepares the way for<b> for</b> which follows. I would say, that the word<b> taste</b> must be regarded as slightly emphatic, and as implying the personal undergoing of death and entering into its suffering. And I doubt much, whether it will not be found that in the other passages where the phrase occurs, this personal suffering of death, though not boldly prominent, is yet within view, and agreeable to the context.<br><br> And now, having considered the three points,<b> by the grace of God,</b>—<b>for every man,</b>—and<b> taste of death,</b>—we return again to the question of the connexion of<b> in order that</b>, with which this clause begins. We before stated that we find it dependent on the former clause,<i> on account of His suffering of death crowned with glory and honour.</i> This exaltation, being the<i> perfecting</i> [see ver. 10] of Christ, was arrived at<i> through sufferings,</i> and<i> on account of His suffering of death</i>,—both by means of, and on account of, His suffering of death, And this exaltation has made Him the divine Head of our humanity—the channel of grace, and the Captain of our salvation. Without His exaltation, his death would not have been effectual. Unless he had been crowned with glory and honour, received to the right hand of the Father, and set in expectation of all things being put under his feet, His death could not have been, for every man, the expiation to him of his own individual sin. On the<i> triumphant issue</i> of his sufferings, their efficacy depends. And this I believe is what the Sacred Writer meant to express. His glory was the consequence of his suffering of death;—arrived at through His suffering: but the applicability of His death to every man is the consequence of His constitution in Heaven as the great High Priest, in virtue of his blood carried into the holy place,—and the triumphant Head of our common humanity: which common humanity of Him and ourselves now becomes the subject of further elucidation).
