<b> CHAP. III. 1–IV. 16.]</b> THE SON OF GOD GREATER ALSO THAN MOSES: AND INFERENCES THEREFROM. The Writer has arrived, through the reasonings of ch. i. ii., at the mention of the High Priesthood of Jesus. He might at once have passed thence to the superiority of His High Priesthood to that of the imperfect priests on earth. But one point yet remains, without which the Gospel would not have its entire comparison with the law. The law was given by angels in the hand of a mediator. Moses was that mediator. Moses was above all others the prophet by whom God had spoken to the Fathers in times past. Christ therefore must be compared with Moses, and shewn to be greater than he. This being done, he returns again to his central idea, the High Priesthood of Christ (ch. iv. 14); and from thenceforward treats of and unfolds it. Ebrard gives the detailed connexion well: “The angel of the covenant came in the name of God before the people of Israel; Moses in the name of Israel before God: the High Priest came in the name of God before Israel (with the name ‘Jehovah’ on his forehead), and in the name of Israel (with the names of the twelve tribes on his breast) before God (Exod. xxviii. 9–29 and 36–68). Now the New Test. Messiah is above the angels, according to ch. i. ii. a) because in Himself as Son of God He is higher than they, and b) because in Him all humanity is exalted above the angels to lordship in the<i> ‘world to come,’</i> and that by this means, because the Messiah is not only Angel, but also High Priest,—not only messenger of God to men, but also the propitiatory sacerdotal<br><br><b> 1.] Whence</b> (i. e. seeing that we have such a helper: it is connected with the result of ch. ii. The fact just announced in ii. 18, is a reason for<i> our considering</i>, &c.: see below),<b> holy brethren</b> (both these words are used in reference to the<i> brethren</i>, ch. ii. 11, 12. Not that the<i> brethren</i> here are<i> Christ's</i> brethren: but that the use of the word reminds them of that brotherhood in and because of Christ, of which he has before spoken. Whether the idea of common nationality is here to be introduced, is at least doubtful. I should rather regard it as swallowed up in the great brotherhood in Christ: and Bleek has well remarked, that, had the Writer been addressing believing Jews and Gentiles, or even believing Gentiles only, he would have used the same term of address, and without any conscious difference of meaning),<b> partakers of an heavenly calling</b> (the invitation, or summons, of God, calling men to His glory in Christ—and hence the state which is entered by them in pursuance of that calling: compare especially Phil. iii. 14. Then also<b> heavenly</b> means—a calling made from heaven, see ch. xii. 25. Or it may mean, the calling which proposes a heavenly reward,—whose inheritance is in heaven. By far the best way is, to join the two meanings together:<i> heavenly</i> in its purport and<i> heavenward</i> in its result),<b> contemplate</b> (survey, with a view to more closely considering, not, “pay attention to, be obedient to”)<b> the Apostle and High Priest</b> (both words belong to the genitive, which follows)<b> of our profession, Jesus (apostle,</b> as superior to the angels, being Himself the angel of the covenant, God’s greatest messenger: the word<i> “angel”</i> being avoided, on account of its technical use before, to prevent Christ being confused with the angels in nature. He is the<i> “sent from the Father:”</i> see John xx. 21. [I may remark, that the circumstance of the Writer using the term<i> “apostle”</i> without scruple, as designating our Lord, shew that the apostles, as a class, were not so distinctly marked as they have since been: a view supported also by some expressions of St. Paul: e.g. 2 Cor. viii. 23.]
