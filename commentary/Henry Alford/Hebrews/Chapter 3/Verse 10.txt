<b> 10.] Wherefore</b> (see above: it is inserted, to mark more strongly the reference of the<i> forty years</i> to the preceding. It is impossible, with this particle of inference, to join those words to this sentence. Instead of being anxious, as some Commentators are, at the expense of the meaning of words, to put our citations straight to the letter, it is far better to recognize at once the truth, for such it is, which Calvin here so boldly states: “We know that the Apostles, in citing testimonies, are more attentive to the main subject, than anxious about words”)<b> I was offended with this generation</b> (the Septuagint has “<i>that</i> generation,” as the received text here: there is no demonstrative in the original Hebrew,—<i>the generation</i>. The change seems to be made by our Writer for a set purpose, viz., to extend the saying, by making<i> “generation”</i> thus import the whole Jewish people,—the then living race, as well as that which provoked God in the wilderness. Compare Matt. xxiv. 34, and note),<b> and said, They do alway err in their heart</b> (Hebrew,<i> “They are a people of wanderers in heart”</i>);<b> but they</b> (in Hebrew, merely<i> “and they”</i>)<b> knew not</b> (<i>never knew:</i> their ignorance preceded their wandering, and is treated as the antecedent fact to it. The<i> not knowing,</i> where matters of practical religion are concerned, implies the not following)<b> my ways</b> (i. e., the ways which I would have them to walk in: so Gen. vi 12; Exod. xviii. 20).<b> As according</b> ( “in conformity with the fact, that:” such conformity not necessarily implying that the excluding oath was<i> prior</i> to the disobedience, but only that the oath and the disobedience were strict correlatives of one another. As the one, so was the other)<b> I sware</b> (see Numb. xiv. 21 ff.; xxxii. 10 ff.; Deut. i. 34 ff.)<b> in my wrath, If they shall enter</b> (so literally: this elliptical form of an oath stands for a strong negative: it is sometimes, when<i> man</i> is the speaker, filled up by “The Lord do so to me and more also, if...” Compare reference Mark; 2 Sam. iii. 35, and other places. It is interpreted below, ver. 18:<i> “to whom sware he that they should not enter,”</i>&c.)<b> into my rest</b> (in the Psalm, and in the places referred to above, the<i> rest</i> is, primarily, the promised land of Canaan. In Deut. xii. 9, 10, the words<i> “rest”</i> and<i> “giving you rest”</i> are used of the promised inheritance of Canaan. But it has been well noticed, that after Joshua had led the people into the land, they never in reality enjoyed entirely the rest which had been promised;—and in consequence, the meaning of that threat of God opened out before them, and it became plain that more was denounced upon the<i> generation</i> than one generation merely could exhaust, more also than the mere not entering into Canaan. Hence the prophetic pregnancy of the oath became evident, and its meaning was carried on in this exhortation by the Psalmist, and is here carried on by the sacred Writer of this Epistle, to a further rest which then remained for Israel, and now still remains for the people of God).
