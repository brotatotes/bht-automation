This is especially meant, that in the church one should exhort another: yet not excluding the implication, that each one should himself be exhorted by his exhortation of the church. In Col. iii. 16, we have the same relation expressed)<b> day by day, as long as the</b> [<b>word</b>]<b> “To-day” is named</b> (i. e., as long as that period endures, which can be called by the name<i> “to-day”</i> as used in the Psalm, That period would be here,<i> the day of grace:</i> the short time [see ch. x. 25, 37] before the coming of the Lord);<b> that from among you</b> (emphatic, as contradistinguished from<i> “your fathers”</i> ver. 9)<b> no one be hardened</b> (as they, ver. 8)<b> by deceit of</b> (arising out of, belonging to) his sin (compare Rom. vii. 11,<i> “For sin... deceived me and slew me.”</i> See also Eph. iv. 22. In ch. xi. 25, xii. 4<i> “sin”</i> is similarly used for defection from God).
