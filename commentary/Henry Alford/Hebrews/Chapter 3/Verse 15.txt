<b> 15.]</b> The whole connexion and construction of this verse is very difficult. I have discussed them in full in my Greek Test.; and have concluded that the words are to be taken as a proof that we must hold fast&c, in order to be<i> partakers of Christ.</i> I would render then,<i> “since it is said,”</i> or in more idiomatic English,<b> for it is said, To-day if ye hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</b> Thus the context goes on smoothly, and the purpose of the whole is to shew, as is summed up in ver. 12, that (ver. 12) it is the wicked heart of<i> unbelief</i> which they have above all things to avoid. This argument is now carried forward by taking up the word<i> provocation</i>, and asking, in a double question, who they were that provoked, and with whom it was that He was offended.
