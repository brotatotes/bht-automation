<b> 16.]</b> The A.V. renders, as indeed the original will very well bear,<i> “For some, when they had heard, did provoke; howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses:”</i>—the exceptions being, Caleb and Joshua, and all under twenty years old, and the women and Levites, But if we come to examine, (a) what contextual sense such a sentence can bear, or even (b) how our Writer would probably have expressed such a meaning, we shall find reason at once to reject the interpretation. For (a), the purpose here is clearly not to bring out the<i> exceptions</i> to those who were included in this saying, a process which would have quite defeated the purpose of the exhortation, seeing that the rebellious would be designated merely by<i> some</i>, and the exceptions would appear to be by far the greater number: and so every reader might shelter himself under the reflection that he was one of the faithful many, not one of the rebellions<i> “some.”</i> Nor again (b) would this, as mere matter of fact, have been thus expressed by the Writer. For it obviously was not so. The<i> “some”</i> were the faithful few, not the rebellious many:<i> “but with the greater part of them</i> God was not well pleased,” 1 Cor. x. 5. As regards the context, the course of thought is in fact just contrary to what this construction would require. The faithful exceptions are overlooked, and the whole of Israel is included in the<i> provocation</i>, to make the exhortation fall more forcibly on the readers.
