<b> 16.]</b> The A.V. renders, as indeed the original will very well bear,<i> “For some, when they had heard, did provoke; howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses:”</i>—the exceptions being, Caleb and Joshua, and all under twenty years old, and the women and Levites, But if we come to examine, (a) what contextual sense such a sentence can bear, or even (b) how our Writer would probably have expressed such a meaning, we shall find reason at once to reject the interpretation. For (a), the purpose here is clearly not to bring out the<i> exceptions</i> to those who were included in this saying, a process which would have quite defeated the purpose of the exhortation, seeing that the rebellious would be designated merely by<i> some</i>, and the exceptions would appear to be by far the greater number: and so every reader might shelter himself under the reflection that he was one of the faithful many, not one of the rebellions<i> “some.”</i> Nor again (b) would this, as mere matter of fact, have been thus expressed by the Writer. For it obviously was not so. The<i> “some”</i> were the faithful few, not the rebellious many:<i> “but with the greater part of them</i> God was not well pleased,” 1 Cor. x. 5. As regards the context, the course of thought is in fact just contrary to what this construction would require. The faithful exceptions are overlooked, and the whole of Israel is included in the<i> provocation</i>, to make the exhortation fall more forcibly on the readers.<br><br><b> For</b> ( “you need indeed to be careful against unbelief:—<i>for</i> on account of this very unbelief all our fathers were excluded”) WHO,<b> when they had heard</b> (in immediate reference to<i> “if ye hear,”</i> ver. 7),<b> provoked</b> (viz. God)?<b> Nay, was it not all who</b> (as above noticed, the exceptions are put out of sight, and that which was true of<i> almost all</i>, asserted generally)<b> came out from Egypt by means of Moses? And</b> (literally,<b> but;</b> it simply brings out the very slight contrast of a second and new particular, and therefore must in English be expressed by<b> and</b>. It is<i> ‘but’</i> in the A.V.: but that is because take ver. 16 in the manner above rejected, as an<i> assertion</i>)<b> with</b> WHOM<b> was He offended forty years</b> (see on vv. 9, 10, and the consonance, in the connexion of<b> forty years</b> with the verb, with that in the Psalm, which was there departed from)?<b> was it not with those who sinned, whose carcases</b> (literally, members of the body, but especially the legs: taken also for the legs and arms, i.e. limbs: probably with the meaning that their bodies should fall and perish limb from limb in the wilderness: so Beza: “By this word is signified not so much that they died by the ordinary means, or by any plague, as that they fell in the desert by their bodies gradually wasting away”)<b> fell in the wilderness</b> (see 1 Cor. x. 5. The words here are exactly those of Numb. xiv. 29. Again, we must remember, in explaining these words, that the Writer is not bearing in mind at this moment the exceptions, but speaking generally)?<b> And to whom sware He that they should not enter into His rest, except to those who disobeyed</b> (not, as A.V.,<i> “believed not:”</i> this was a fact, and was indeed the root of their<i> disobedience</i>)?
