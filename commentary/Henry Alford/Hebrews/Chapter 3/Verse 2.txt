<b> 2.]</b> First, a point of<i> likeness</i> between our Lord and Moses is brought out, and that by a reference to an Old Test. declaration respecting the latter);<b> that he is</b> (not<i> ‘was.’</i> The present sense must be retained here. Then a question arises: are we to understand it strictly of present time, of Christ now in heaven,—or as in the case cited, of general designation? Clearly, I think, of the latter: Jesus, whose character it is, that He is<i> faithful</i>. For the strict present would, to say nothing of other objections, not apply to the portion of the Lord’s office, designated by the word<i> “apostle,”</i> but only to that comprised under<i> “High Priest.”</i> It characterizes faithfulness as His inherent attribute)<b> faithful</b> (it is questioned, whether or not this word refers back to the<i> “faithful High Priest”</i> of ch. ii. 18. The sense is certainly not the same: the faithfulness there being the fidelity wherewith He, being like His brethren, would, so to speak, reproduce their wants before God;—that here spoken of being His faithfulness to God, over whose house He is set, ver. 6. Still I cannot help thinking that the<i> word itself</i> is led to by, and takes up that other. That regarded more the sacerdotal, this regards the<i> apostolic</i> office of Christ)<b> to him that made him</b> (so we must render: not,<i> ‘that appointed him.’</i> See this defended, and citations of the expression in both senses in the Fathers, in my Greek Test. The word thus taken, is of course to be understood of that constitution of our Lord as our Apostle and High Priest in which He, being human, was made by the Father: not of Him as the eternal Word, which would be irrelevant here, besides being against all Scripture precedent),<b> as also</b> (<b>also</b>—to take another instance of faithfulness: thus, with every circumstance of honour, is Moses introduced, before any disparagement of him is entered upon) [<b>was</b>]<b> Moses in all his house</b> (cited from Numbers in the references,<i> “My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.”</i> 1) It may be well to remark, that the substitution of his for<i> “my”</i> at once indicates to whom<i> “His”</i> is to be referred: viz. to God,<i> who made him:</i> see also below on ver. 6. And so most ancient and modern Commentators. 2) The circumstance of the quotation makes it far more natural to refer<i> “in all His house”</i> to Moses directly, and not to Christ, as some do, putting a comma at<i> Moses.</i> 3) The ellipsis is to be filled up by<i> “was faithful”</i> after<i> “Moses,”</i> as in the place cited, and as in A.V. 4) The signification of<i> “His house”</i> is well illustrated by 1 Tim. iii. 15,—<i> “the house of God, which is the church of the living God.”</i> It imports the Church of God: and is one and the same here and in ver. 6; not two different houses, but the same, in the case of Moses taken at one time only,—in that of Christ, in its whole existence and development).
