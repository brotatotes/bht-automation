<b> 3.] For</b> (the<b> for</b> is best connected, as commonly, with the<i> “consider”</i> above: as containing the reason why our attention should be thus fixed on Jesus:<i> for</i>, though He has the quality of faithfulness in God's house in common with Moses, yet is He far more exalted and glorious than he)<b> this person</b> (better than<i> “this man”</i> of the A.V., which brings in an element not present here)<b> hath been held worthy</b> (the word includes, with the idea of<i> ‘accounting worthy,’</i> that also of the<i> actual</i> bestowal of the dignity. It refers to the honour and glory wherewith God hath crowned Christ, in His exaltation to His right Hand; which is taken for granted without further explanation, as a fact well known to the readers)<b> of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he hath more honour than the house, who established it</b> (so literally. The<i> establishing</i> here meant refers beyond doubt primarily to the erection of an actual house. The word is so used, of the preparation of a building,—a house, or temple, or ship, or town, &c.—In almost all the places where it occurs (see my Greek Test.) the verb may be so taken as to include not only the erection of the building, ship, &c., but also the fitting up, providing with proper furniture. And here also we may say, that it means more than the building of the house, and includes, besides the building of the house, the fitting it up and providing it with all requisites. So that to this<i> establishment</i> of the house belong servants, male and female; and so here we may say that the servants of the house are included. The sense then is this: just as he who has built and furnished a house,—for himself namely, as master of the house,—stands higher in honour than the house itself and the individual<i> servants</i>, so does Christ higher than Moses: and Christ is thus represented as he who has prepared the house of God [and therefore as its lord], to whom Moses also belongs as an individual<i> servant</i>).
