<b> 4.] For</b> (expansion and justification of the last verse)<b> every house is established by some one</b> (i. e. it belongs to the idea of a house that some one should have built and fitted it up: arrangement implies an arranger, design a designer);<b> but</b> (contrast as passing from the individual to the general)<b> He which established all things is God</b> (before treating of the misunderstanding of this verse by the fathers, and by many of the moderns, let us endeavour to grasp its true meaning. The last verse brings before us Christ as the<i> establisher</i> of the house of God. And this He is, in whatever sense the word<i> “house”</i> be taken: whether in the narrower sense which best suits this present comparison, or in the wider sense implied by the faithful centurion in Matt. viii. 9, in which all natural powers are his<i> servants</i>. But he is this, not by independent will or agency.<i> “By whom also He made the worlds,”</i> is our Writer’s own language of the creation by Christ: and it is in accord with that of St. John, where he says<i> “all things were made by Him.”</i> He,<i> as the Son</i>, is He that established the house of God—the church, or the world, or the universe; but, apparently [compare ver. 6], the former of these: but it is as one with—by virtue of his Sonship—Him who is<i> the Establisher of all things</i>, viz. God. And thus the<b> his</b>, twice repeated in vv. 5, 6, falls into its own place as belonging both times to God: Moses is His servant, part and portion of His household: Christ is His Son, over His household. And by this reference to God as the<i> first Establisher</i>, is the expression above,<i> “him that made him,”</i> illustrated and justified. So that this verse is not parenthetic, as almost all the recent expositors make it,—but distinctly part of the argument.<br><br> The ancient expositors, almost without exception, take<i> “God”</i> as predicate, and<i> “He that established all things”</i> as a designation of Christ—<i> “now He that founded all things, is</i> [must be]<i> God:”</i> thus making the passage a proof of the deity of Christ. But, apart from the extreme harshness and forcing of the construction to bring out this meaning, the sentiment itself is entirely irrelevant here. If the Writer was proving Christ to be greater than Moses inasmuch as He is God, the founder of all things, then clearly the mere assertion of this fact. would have sufficed for the proof, without entering on another consideration after such an assertion, all minor considerations would have been not only superfluous, but preposterous. He does however, after this, distinctly go into the consideration of Christ being faithful not as a servant but as a son: so that he cannot be here speaking of His Deity as a ground of superiority).
