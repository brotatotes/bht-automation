<b> 5.]</b> The argument proceeds, resuming the common ground of ver. 2.<b> And Moses indeed</b> (inasmuch as<b> but</b> following has the effect of bringing out, and thus emphasizing,<i> Christ</i>, this<b> indeed</b>, or<b> verily</b>, may almost be treated as a particle of disparagement) [<b>was</b>]<b> faithful in all His</b> God’s, compare above the words of the citation, on ver. 2. It is necessary in the English to mark this reference, which otherwise would be missed)<b> house, as a servant</b> (compare as above; the word<b> servant</b> is often applied in the Old Test. to Moses: see Exod. iv. 10, xiv. 31: Numb. xii. 7, 8: Josh. i. 2, &c. The Greek word used here for<b> servant</b> is not that which signifies<i> slave</i>, but a more honourable one, designating all who minister to one another on any account),<b> for testimony of the things which were to be</b> [afterwards]<b> spoken</b> (these words are not to be joined with<b> “servant,”</b> nor with<b> “faithful,”</b> but with the whole preceding sentence: the purpose of the faithful service of Moses in God’s house was,<i> for testimony</i>, &c.<b> The things which were to be spoken after</b> can only mean<i> the Gospel</i> (see the various insufficient meanings which have been given and discussed in my Greek Test. Owen observes, “This as well the order of the words as the import of them doth require. In his ministry he was a testimony, or, by what he did in the service of the house he gave testimony: whereunto? to the things that were afterwards to be spoken, viz. in the fulness of time, the appointed season, by the Messiah: i.e. the things of the gospel. And this indeed was the proper end of all that Moses did or ordered in the house of God”);<b> but Christ</b> (understand,<i> is faithful</i>. Then, supplying this, are we to join it with<i> “over his house,”</i> or to insert it before the words<i> “as a Son,”</i> and take it absolutely? Certainly the latter, as shewn by the order of the words in the previous sentence; the ellipsis here being, to judge by that order, between<i> “but Christ”</i> and<i> “as,”</i> not between<i> “Son”</i> and “<i>over”</i>)<b> as a Son over His house</b> (his here again<i> of God</i>,—not primarily, though of course by inference, of Christ. The house is<i> God’s</i> throughout: but Christ is of primary authority and glory in it, inasmuch as He is the Son in the house, and actually established the house. This, which I am persuaded is required by the context, is shewn decisively by ch. x. 21, “Having.... a great High Priest over<b> the house of God.”</b> Most Commentators refer it to<i> Christ:</i> and some, as A.V., understand<i> “his”</i> to mean<i> “his own.”</i> But thus the parallelism is destroyed, and in fact the identity of the house in the two cases, on which depends the strictness of the comparison between Moses and Christ. Ebrard has maintained that<i> two houses are intended:</i> “in the one house serves Moses. for a testimony of the future revelations of God, the<i> house</i> itself being part of the<i> testimony:</i> the other<i> house</i>, the<i> house</i> of Christ, are<i> we:</i> it is a living house, built of living stones.” But this introduces a complicated comparison, and to my mind infinitely weakens the argument. There is but one house throughout, and that one, the Church of God, in which both are faithful; one as a servant, the other as a son: this house was Israel, this house are we, if we are found faithful in the covenant);<b> whose</b> (not [except by inference]<i> Christ’s</i>. Besides the considerations urged above as affecting the question, we have the strong argument from Scripture analogy, compare 1 Tim. iii. 15; 1 Pet. iv. 17; 1 Cor. iii. 16, 17; 2 Cor. vi. 16; Eph. ii. 22; ch. x. 21, xii. 22; Rev. iii. 12: which alone, especially ch. x. 21, would go very far with me to decide the question)<b> house are we</b> (the Writer and his Hebrew readers: of whose house we are, even as Moses<b> if we hold fast the confidence and the matter of boasting of our hope</b> (see Rom. v. 2).
