<b> 7.]</b><b> Wherefore</b> (i. e. seeing that they are the house of Christ, if they hold fast their confidence and boast. of hope. It has been disputed, what following verb is to be connected with<i> wherefore</i>. Some join it immediately with<i> “harden not,”</i> and regard with Writer as making the Spirit's words his own: but this labours under the great difficulty that in ver. 9 the speaker is God Himself, and so an unnatural break is made at the end of ver. 8. Others believe that the construction begun with<b> wherefore</b> is dropped, and never finished, as in Rom. xv. 3, 21; 1 Cor. i. 31, ii. 9:<b> supplying</b> after<b> wherefore</b>,<i> “harden not your hearts,”</i>—or understanding<b> wherefore</b> more freely,” wherefore let it be so with you, as&c.” But by far the best way is, to take the whole citation, including the formula of citation, as a parenthesis, and join<b> wherefore</b> with<b> take heed</b>, ver. 12. The length of such parenthesis is no objection to this view: see ch. vii. 20–22; xii. 18–24, where the Writer, after similar parentheses, returns back into the previous construction. Nor again is it any objection, that in the midst of the citation, another<i> “wherefore”</i> occurs, ver. 10: for that<i> “wherefore”</i> belongs strictly to the citation, and finds both its preparation and its resulting clause within its limits),—<b>even as the Holy Spirit saith</b> (in Ps. xcv., Hebrew and English. This Psalm in the Hebrew has no writer’s name: in the Septuagint it is headed,<i> “a psalm of praise of</i> (or,<i> to</i>)<i> David.”</i> And it is ascribed to David in ch. iv. 7 below. The passage is cited as the direct testimony of the Holy Spirit, speaking through David),<b> To-day if ye hear his voice</b> (in ‘the Psalm, according to the Hebrew, the words corresponding to these, the second half of the 7th verse, form an independent sentence, to be taken as a powerful exhortation expressed in the form of a wish. The sense from ver. 6 is,— ‘Come let us fall down and bow ourselves, kneel before Jehovah our Creator. For He is our God, and we the people of his pasture and the flock of his hand.’ Then this sentence follows: ‘O that ye might this day hearken to His voice!’<i> “This day”</i> stands first, with strong emphasis, in contrast to the whole past time, during which they had shewn themselves disobedient and rebellious against the divine voice, as e.g. during the journey through the wilderness, alluded to in the following verses: ‘to-day’ therefore means<i> ‘now,’</i><i> ‘now at length.’</i> Then in the following verses, to the end of the Psalm, is introduced, that which the divine voice, which they are to hear, addresses to them.<b> To-day</b> will thus refer to the day in which the Psalm was used in public worship, whenever that might be. See below),<b> harden not your hearts</b> (Hebrew,<i> heart</i>. Bleek remarks, that this is the only place where this expression<i> ‘to harden the heart,’</i> is [in the original Hebrew text: the A.V. is inaccurate in Exod. viii. 15, 32, 1 Sam. vi. 6, where the expression is, literally rendered,<i> to make heavy or dull</i>] used of<i> man’s</i> own act: elsewhere it is always of God's act, compare Exod. iv. 21; vii. 20, 27; xi. 10; xiv. 4, 17; Isa. lxiii. 17; and with<i> “spirit,”</i> Deut. ii. 30; whereas when the hardening is described us the work of man, the formula<i> “to stiffen the neck”</i> is used, Deut. x. 16; Neh. ix. 17, 29; 2 Chron. xxx. 8; xxxvi. 13; Jer. vii. 26; 2 Kings xvii. 14. For New Test. usage see Acts xix. 9; Rom. ix. 18),<b> as in the provocation</b> (the Hebrew has,<i> ‘as</i> [<i>at</i>]<i> Meribah.’</i> In Exod. xvii. 1–7 we read that the place where the children of Israel murmured against the Lord for want of water was called Massah and Meribab. But the subsequent account of Numb. xx. 1–13, makes it plain that the two names refer to two different events and places: and this is further confirmed by Deut. xxxiii. 8,— “Thy holy One whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah.” In the Psalm these two are mentioned together, and the Septuagint as usual<i> translate</i> the names. In giving, for the proper names, their meaning and occasion, they have in fact cast light upon the sacred text; though it is rather comment than strict translation),<b> in the time of</b> (in the Hebrew this second clause is distinct from the first, and introduces a fresh instance: see below)<b> the day of the temptation in the wilderness</b> (Hebrew,<i> “as in the day of Massah in the wilderness:”</i> viz. that of the second murmuring against Moses and Aaron for want of water: see Numb. xx, 1–13. The place was in the wilderness of Sin, near Kadesh: ib. ver. 1):<b> where your fathers tempted, by way of trial</b> (<i> ‘templed</i> [<i>me</i>]<i> in trying,’</i> or<i> ‘proving</i> [<i>me</i>]<i>’</i>),<b> and saw my works</b> (Hebrew,<i> “moreover they saw my work”</i>—i. e. my penal judgments; for these penal judgments lasted during the forty years, and it is they which are described in the next sentence. The meaning given by most expositors,<i> “although they saw my works</i> [miracles of deliverance, &c.]<i> for forty years,”</i> is not so likely, seeing that these provocations happened at the beginning of the forty years. But see below)<b> forty years</b> (these words in the Hebrew most probably belong, as rendered in our A.V., to what follows:<i> “I was grieved with this generation forty years:”</i> an arrangement rendered impossible here, on account of<i> wherefore</i> intervening.—But that such arrangement, was not unknown to our Writer is plain, from his presently saying, ver. 17,<i> “With whom was he grieved forty years?”</i> It is therefore likely that he did not choose this arrangement without reason. And if we ask what that reason was, we find an answer in the probability that the forty years’ space is taken as representing to the Hebrews their space for repentance; their<i> “to-day”</i> between the opening of the preaching of the gospel [compare ch. ii. 2], and their impending destruction. This idea was recognized by the Jews themselves in their books: “How long endure the years of the Messiah? Rabbi Eliezer said, forty years, in like manner as the children of Israel were this number of years in the wilderness.” “And if,” says Bleek, “this idea of the days of the Messiah was prevalent, that they were the immediate precursors of the<i> ‘age to come,’</i> as the time of the great Sabbath-rest and the completed glory of the people of God,—this is something very analogous to the acceptation of the period of the forty years which seems to underlie what is said of them in our Epistle.” If so, it is possible that the meaning may be, that they saw My wonderful works and took no heed to them, and thereby increased their guilt).
