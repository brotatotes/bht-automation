<b> 1.] Let us fear</b><b> therefore</b> (this form of expressing the caution seems purposely chosen to express the fear and trembling, Phil. ii. 12, with which every servant of God, however free from slavish terror anxiety, ought to work out his salvation),<b> lest, a promise being still left us</b> (notice the<i> present</i>—not<i> “having been left us.”</i> On the force of this present, very much of the argument rests)<b> of entering into His rest</b> (it is to be observed, that in the argument in this chapter, the Writer departs from the primary sense of the words<i> “my rest”</i> in the Psalm, and lays stress on<i> His</i>, making it<i> God's</i> rest, the rest into which God has entered; see below on ver. 10. And this is very important as to the nature of the rest in question, as importing, not the land of Canaan, but the heavenly home which that earthly rest mystically foreshadowed. Of course all references of the rest spoken of to the period after the destruction of Jerusalem, as Hammond, or to the cessation of Levitical ordinances, as Michaelis, are inadequate and out of the question),<b> any one of you</b> (although the communicative form has been used before in<i> “let us fear,”</i> the second person is here returned to; and of purpose. A similar change is found in ch. x. 24, 25: and in Rom. xiv. 13)<b> appear</b> (see below)<b> to have fallen short of it</b> (i. e. be found, when the great trial of all shall take place, to have failed of, = to have no part in,—the promise. So that<b> appear</b> is, as so many both of ancients and moderns have taken it, a mild term, conveying indeed a sterner intimation behind it).
