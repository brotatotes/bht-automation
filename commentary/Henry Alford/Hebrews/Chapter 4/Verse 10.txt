<b> 10.]</b> is taken in two ways: 1. as a general axiom, justifying the use of the words<i> “keeping of sabbath”</i> above:<b> For he that entered into his</b> (God’s)<b> rest, himself also rested from his</b> (own)<b> works, like as God rested from his own.</b> This has been the usual explanation, Theophylact says, “He is explaining, in what sense he called such a rest a<i> sabbatism:</i> because, he says we also rest from our works, as also God, when He rested from His works in creating the world, named the day the Sabbath.” This explanation labours under two difficulties (a) the past tense,<b> ‘entered</b> into his which thus is made into a perfect or a present: (b) the double reference<b> of</b><b> his</b>, first to God, and then to the man in question, especially when God’s works are taken up by the strong term<b> his own</b>, 2. The other interpretation has been that of Owen, and others, and recently Ebrard, who refer<b> he that entered</b> to Christ:<b> For He that entered into his</b> (own or God’s)<b> rest, Himself also rested from His works like as God rested from His own:</b> and therefore, from our Forerunner having entered into this sabbatism, it is reserved for us, the people of God, to enter into it with and because of Him. Thus, as Ehrard says, Jesus is placed in the liveliest contrast to Joshua, who had not brought God’s people to their rest; and is designated as “That one, who entered into God's rest.” And to this view I own I am strongly inclined, notwithstanding the protest raised against it by Bleck, Lünemann, and Delitzsch. My reasons are, in addition to those implied above, a) the<i> form</i> of the assertion, as regards Joshua here and Jesus in ver. 14. That a contrast is intended between the Jesus who did not give them rest, and the “Great High Priest who is gone through the heavens,<b> Jesus the Son of God,</b>” seems very plain. And if so, it would he easily accounted for, that Christ should be here introduced merely under the designation of<b> He that entered into his rest.</b> b) the introduction of the words<b> he himself also</b>, lifting out and dignifying the subject of this clause as compared with<b> God</b>, in a way which would hardly be done, had the assertion been merely of any man generally. c) Seripture analogy. This rest, into which the Lord Jesus entered, is spoken of Isa. xi, 10,<i> “And His rest shall be glorious:”</i> and this work of His, in Isa. xl. 10,<i> “His work is before Him:”</i> and by Christ Himself, John ix. 4,<i> “I must work the works of Him that’ sent me while it is day.”</i> d) The expression<b> that rest</b> below, which stands harshly insulated, unless it refers to the<b> rest</b> in this verse. e) The whole context: see summary at ch. iii. 1. Render then:<b> For He that entered into His</b> (either, “God’s;” or more probably merely “his,” reflective, as in Isa, xi. 10 above)<b> rest, He Himself also</b> (on this, see above)<b> rested from his works</b> (see above)<b> as God from his own</b> (His own, not with any distinction of kind, but used only to mark distinction of possession).
