<b> 13.] And there is not a creature</b> (the term embraces all created things, visible and invisible, compare Col. i. 16)<b> unseen in His presence</b> (first as to the possessive pronoun: to what does it refer? to<i> the word of God,</i> or to<i> God</i> Himself? The idea of its referring to<i> Christ</i> falls with the untenableness of the personal meaning of the<i> Word:</i> although some, abandoning that, yet hold it. Then of the two other, it seems much the more obvious to refer it to<i> God</i>, especially in the presence of<i> “the eyes of Him with whom we have to do”</i> below. Nor is there any harshness in this; from speaking of the uttered word of God, whose powers ave not its own but His, the transition to Himself, with whom that word is so nearly identified, is simple and obvious):<b> but</b> (nay, rather... i.e. so far from this, that...)<b> all things are naked and lying open</b> (the Greek word thus rendered is a very unusual and difficult one. Its intention seems to be to convey the idea of entire prostration and subjugation under the eye of God: so that the things of which this is said are not only naked, stripped of all covering and concealment,—but also laid prostrate in their exposure, before His eye. See the whole matter discussed in my Greek Test. It is one which can hardly be made intelligible to the mere English reader)<b> to His eyes</b> (for His eyes to see)<b> with whom we have to do</b> (there could not be a happier rendering than this of the A.V., expressing our whole concern and relation with God, One who is not to be trifled with, considering that His word is so powerful, and His eye so discerning. The ancients, withont, exception, confined this relation to one solemn particular of it, and rendered,<i> “to whom our account must be given.”</i> And many of the moderns also take this view. Others suppose it to mean, “concerning whom is our discourse”).
