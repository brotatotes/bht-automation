<b> 16.]</b><i> Exhortation to confidence, even in our guilt and need, grounded on this sympathy of our great High Priest.</i><b> Let us therefore approach</b> (this idea, of<i> approach</i>, or<i> coming</i>, or<i> drawing near</i>, to God [all expressed by the same word in the Greek], is a favourite one in this Epistle, see ch. vii, 25; x. 1, 22; xi. 6; xii. 18, 22, and generally in the same sense as here, either, as under the Old Test., by sacrifices, or, as under the New Test., by the one sacrifice of Christ. The same idea is expressed Eph. ii. 18; iii. 12, by the word<i> “access”</i>)<b> with confidence</b> (ch. iii. 16, and note there)<b> to the throne of grace</b> (i. e. not, Christ Himself,—nor the throne of Christ, but, by the analogy of this Epistle, the<i> throne</i> of God, at the right hand of which, ch. viii. 1, xii. 2, Jesus our Forerunner is seated. That it is here called the throne of<i> grace</i>, is owing to the complexion of the passage, in which the grace and mercy of our reconciled God are described as ensured to us by the sympathy and power of our great High Priest),<b> that we may receive compassion</b> (corresponding to that<i> sympathy</i> of our High Priest above spoken of: but extending further than our<i> infirmities</i>, to the forgiveness of our sins by God's mercy in Christ),<b> and may find grace</b> (both, the receiving<i> mercy</i> and find-ing<i> grace</i>, apply to the next clause)<b> for help in time</b> (i. e.<i> to-day</i>, while it is yet open to us. This is decidedly the right interpretation, and not as many Commentators and the A.V.<i> “in time of need,”</i><i> “as often as we want it,”</i> which would be both flat, and hardly justified by usage).
