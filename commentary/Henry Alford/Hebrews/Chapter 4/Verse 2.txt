<b> 2.]</b> The former half of this verse substantiates the expression<i> “being still left”</i> of the last verse. The stress is not, “<i>we</i>, as well as<i> they:</i>” but lies on<b> have good tidings been preached</b>, which includes both us and them.<br><br><b> For good tidings have been also announced to us, as likewise to them</b> (they were not the same good tidings in the two cases: but the Writer treats them as the same. To them indeed it was primarily the inheritance of the land of promise: but even then, as proved below, the term<b> my rest</b> had a farther meaning, which meaning reaches even down to us):<b> nevertheless the word of</b> [<b>their</b>]<b> hearing</b> (<i>of hearing</i>, genitive of apposition; the word and the<i> hearing</i> being commensurate: “<i>the word of</i> [consisting in]<i> that which they heard</i>”)<b> did not profit them, unmingled as they were in faith with its hearers.</b><br><br> The passage is almost a desperate one. I have discussed it, in its various readings and meanings, in my Greek Test., and, deem-ing it necessary to adopt the reading followed in the text, have found this meaning,— “And so these men received no benefit from ‘the word of hearing,’ because they were not one in faith with its hearers; did not correspond, in their method of receiving it, with faithful hearers, whom it does profit.” I have stated that this interpretation<i> does not satisfy me</i>: but it seems the only escape from violation either of the rules of criticism or of those of grammar: and therefore I am constrained to accept it until some better is suggested.
