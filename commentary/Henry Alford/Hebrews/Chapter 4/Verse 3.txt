<b> 3.] For</b> (taking up again the word “<i>faith</i>” in ver. 2)<b> we do enter</b> (are to enter. Some Commentators have seen a communicative and conciliatory tone in the first person here. But Bleek and Lünemann well remark that it is not so; for the fact of<i> believing</i> brings out a class distinct from the rest, as in ch. vi. 18, xii. 25)<b> into the</b> (aforesaid)<b> rest</b> (not only, as A.V.,<i> “into rest,”</i> abstract),<b> we who believed</b> (the past tense is anticipatory, the standing-point being, the day of entering into the rest. It was unbelief which excluded them: the promise still remains unfulfilled, see below: they who at the time of its fulfilment shall be found to have believed, shall enter into it),<b> even as He hath said</b> (this citation evidently does not refer to the whole of what has just been said, but only to the fact, that the rest has not yet been entered into in the sense of the promise. The condition,<i> believing</i>, is not yet: brought into treatment, but follows below in ver. 11 in hortatory form, having in fact been demonstrated already in ch. iii. 12–19),<b> As I sware in my wrath, if</b> (see above on ch. iii. 11)<b> they shall enter into my rest: although</b> (the context is much disputed. I believe it will be best taken thus: the Writer is leading on to the inference, that the entering into<i> God's rest</i> is a thing YET FUTURE for God’s people. And this he thus brings about.<i> “My rest”</i> is not a thing future for God:—He has already entered therein,—ver. 4. Still [ver. 5] we have again, after God had thus entered in, the oath, They shall not, &c. Consequently, since [ver. 6] it remains that<i> some</i> must enter in, and they to whom it was first promised did not, on account of unbelief,—for that they<i> did not</i> [i. e. none of them did], is plain by His repeating in David, after the lapse of so many centuries, the same warn-ing again [ver. 7], which He would not have done if Joshua had led Israel into that rest [ver. 8]:—since this is so, the sabbatism of God’s people is YET FUTURE [ver. 9], and reserved for that time when they shall rest from their labours, as God from His [ver. 10]. Then follows a concluding exhortation, vv. 11–16. Thus all is clear, and according to the progress of the argument, Sev other proposed meanings discussed in my Gr. Test.)<b> the works</b> (viz. of God: an expression borrowed from the citation which follows)<b> were constituted</b> (i. e. finished)<b> from the foundation of the world</b> (i. e. as substantiated in next verse, though God Himself had not that rest<i> to enter into</i>, and did not mean this by<b> my rest,</b> but had entered into the rest of which He speaks: the key-verse to this being ver. 10).
