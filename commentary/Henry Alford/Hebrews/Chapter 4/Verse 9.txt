<b> 9.]</b><i> Consequence from the proposition</i> in ver. 6.<i> Some</i> must enter therein: some, that is, analogous to, inheriting the condition of and promises. made to, those first, who did not enter in because of disobedience. These are now specified as<i> “the people of God,”</i> doubtless with a reference to the true spiritual character of Israclites indeed, represented under their external name: and their rest is no longer a<i> “rest”</i> merely. but (see below) is called by a higher and nobler name.<b> Therefore</b> (see above)<b> there is yet reserved</b> (see on ver. 6: remains as yet unexhausted, occupied, unrealized)<b> a keeping of sabbath</b> (the term is used here to correspond to<i> “my rest,”</i> specified and explained in ver. 4. God's rest was a<i> keeping of sabbath:</i> so also will ours be. The idea of the rest hereafter being the antitype of the Sabbath-rest, was familiar to the Jews. They spoke of the<i> “age to come”</i> as the “day which is all sabbath.” It is hardly probable that the sacred Writer had in his mind the object which Calvin mention: “I doubt not that the Apostle purposely alludes to the Sabbath, to dissuade the Jews from its outward observance: for thus only can its abrogation be understood, by the understanding its spiritual end.” Still more alien from the sense and context is it to use this verse, as some have absurdly done, as carrying weight one way or the other in the controversy respecting the obligation of a sabbath under the Christian dispensation. The only indication it furnishes is negative: viz. that no such term as<i> “keeping of sabbath”</i> could then have been, in the minds of Christians, associated with the keeping of the Lord’s day: otherwise, being already present, it could not be said that<b> it is yet reserved</b>)<b> for the people of God</b> (the well-known designation of Israel the covenant people. It occurs again, ch. xi. 25. Here it is used of that veritable Israel, who inherit God's promises by faith Christ: compare Gal. vi. 16).
