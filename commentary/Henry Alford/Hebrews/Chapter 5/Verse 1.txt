<b> CHAP. V. 1–X. 18.]</b> THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD OF CHRIST: and this in several points of view. That which has before been twice by anticipation hinted at, ch. ii. 17; iii. 1; iv. 14, 15, is now taken up and thoroughly discussed. First of all, v. 1–10, two necessary qualifications of a High Priest are stated, and Christ is proved to have fulfilled both: a) vv. 1–3,<i> he must be taken from among men, capable, in respect of infirmity, of feeling for men,</i> and b) vv. 4–10,<i> he must not have taken the dignity upon himself, but have been appointed by God.</i><br><br><b> 1.] For</b> (takes up again ch. iv. 15, with a view to substantiate it: see remarks below)<b> every high priest</b> (in the sense, Levitical High Priest; the only class here in question. Delitzsch is however right in maintaining, that it is not right to limit the words to this sense, or to see in them this condition, which indeed is not brought forward, but only exists in the nature of the case, no other High Priests being in view),<b> being taken from among men</b> (this participial clause belongs to the predicative portion of the sentence, and indeed carries the chief weight of it, having a slight causal force; “inasmuch as he is taken from among men.” Some take it as belonging to the<i> subject</i>, as does the A.V., “Every high priest taken from among men,” and see in it a contrast, as in ch. vii. 28, between human High Priests, and the Son of God. But such contrast here is not only not in, but inconsistent with, the context: which does not bring out as yet any difference between Christ, and the Jewish High Priests, but rather [see below] treats of the attributes of a High Priest from their example)<b> is appointed for</b> (<i>on behalf of</i>, for the benefit of: vicariousness must not be introduced where the context, as here, does not require it: see note on ch. ii. 9)<b> men</b> (the stress is both times on this noun and its preposition, “<i>being taken</i><b> from among men,</b><i> is ap-pointed</i><b> for men,”</b> the former justifying the latter. This is a powerful additional reason for taking<i> “taken from among men”</i> predicatively: for, if it be taken as attached to the subject, “every High Priest taken from among<i> “men,”</i> with a necessary stress in such case on<i> “men”</i> the same stress must be laid on<i> “men,”</i> in the clause<i> “is appointed for men,”</i> with an implication that Christ, with whom on this hypothesis the human High Priest is contrasted, was<i> not</i> appointed for<i> men</i>)<b> in matters relating to God</b> (see note on ch. ii. 17),<b> that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins</b> (<b>gifts and sacrifices</b> are both to be taken with<b> for sins:</b> not,<i> gifts</i> alone, and<i> sacrifices for sin</i> together.
