<b> 11–VI. 20.]</b><i> Digression</i>, before entering on the comparison of Christ with Melchisedec,<i> complaining of the low state of spiritual attainment of the readers</i> (11–14):<i> warning them of the necessity of progress and the peril of falling back</i> (vi. 1–8):<i> but at the suime time encouraging them by God’s faithfulness in bearing in mind their previous labour of love, and in His promises generally, to persevere in faith and patience to the end</i> (vi. 9–20).<br><br><b> 11.] Concerning whom</b> (i. e.<i> Melchisedec:</i> not as some,<i> Christ</i>, of whom such an expression as this would hardly here be used, seeing that the whole Epistle hitherto has been concerning Him: the Writer<i> returns to Melchisedec</i>, ch. vii. 1)<b> what we have to say</b> (the plural pronoun, not with any definite reference to Timothy or other companions of the Writer, nor intended to include the readers, which is here impossible: but, as in some other places of the Epistle, merely indicating the Writer himself, as so frequently also in the Epistles of St. Paul)<b> is much, and difficult of interpretation</b> [for us]<b> to speak</b> (this is somewhat difficult.

This latter alternative is taken by some: but it is hardly justified by the original: see my Greek Test. We are driven then to the other alternative, of making the Writer the subject to be supplied: so Chrysostom: “For when one has an audience who do not follow one, nor understand what is said, one cannot interpret well to them:” and many others; and the verb,<i> to speak</i>, which follow, will be constructed much as in our phrase “beautiful to look upon,” “hard to work upon,”&c.),<b> since</b> (probably renders a reason only for the<i> difficulty of interpretation</i>, not belonging also to the fact that the discourse would be<i> abundant</i>)<b> ye are bocome</b> (not<i> ‘are’</i> as A.V.
