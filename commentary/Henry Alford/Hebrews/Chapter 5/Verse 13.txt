<b> 13.]</b> renders a reason for vv. 11, 12, and especially for the assertion that the discourse would be difficulty of interpretation. Having before stated that what he had to say would be hard for him to explain to them, and then that they were become persons needing milk and not solid food, he now proceeds to join these two positions together:<b> For every one who partakes of</b> (in the sense of<i> has for his share</i>, in ordinary feeding: not, partakes of in common with other things, for that adults do: see 1 Cor. x. 21)<b> milk is unskilled in</b> (not, unskil<i> ful</i> in, which would be so, but is a different thing)<b> the word of righteousness: for he is an infant</b> (that is, for every partaker of milk, in the metaphorical sense in which I just now used the word, i.e. every one who requires yet to be taught the first principles&c., is devoid of understanding in the word of righteousness, in, that is, the positions and arguments which treat of God’s salvation by Christ: for he is an infant: takes the same rank in spiritual understanding, that an infant does in worldly” Thus taken, I can see no difficulty in the contextual connexion. There is of course a mingling of the figure and the thing represented, which however is easy enough to any reader to whom both figure and thing are already familiar. But it is necessary to fix more satisfactorily the meaning of the somewhat obscure expression,<b> the word of righteous-ness.</b> Chrysostom interprets it of the doctrine of a pure and holy life: others, of that relating to Christ, the Author of righteousness: others again, of the higher doctrines: others, of the doctrine of justification by faith: others, of the doctrine of perfection, of which he by and by speaks: some, of the doctrine respecting Melchisedec, who is<i> King of Righteousness</i>. I incline more to Lünemann’s view of the meaning, based as it is on the requirements of the passage, in which the stress is not on<i> “the word of righteousness,”</i> but on<i> “unskilled,”</i> and<i> “the word of righteousness”</i> follows as something of course and generally understood. Feeling this, he interprets it. of the gospel in general: that<i> word</i> of which the central point is, the righteousness which is of God. And he refers to 2 Cor. iii. 9,<i> “the ministration of righteousness,”</i> and xi. 15,<i> “ministers of righteousness.”</i> This acceptation would not altogether preclude<i> “the king of righteousness”</i> falling under the same general head, and thus would bring the two expressions into union, though without any distinct reference from one to another).
