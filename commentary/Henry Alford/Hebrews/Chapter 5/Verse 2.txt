<b> 2.] being</b> (one who is)<b> able</b> (this clause is closely bound to the last, and belongs to it, not to the whole sentence)<b> to be compassionate towards the ignorant and erring</b> (the former mild word though frequently used of sinners elsewhere without, as well as with, the implication of ignorance, seems to be here placed, as well as<b> erring</b>, itself at all events a milder term than<i> sinning</i> as suitable to the tone of the sentence, in which the feeling of a sinner towards his fellow-sinners is expressed. The sense might be filled up, ‘towards those who [possibly after all] are ignorant and deluded.’ And thus the propriety of the next clause is rendered still greater; both these,<i> ignorance</i> and<i> error</i>, being the results of<i> weakness</i>, with which he himself is encompassed. There is in these designations exclusion on the one side of “sinners with a high hand,” and an inclusion in them, as above, of much more than sins, strictly speaking, of ignorance),<b> seeing that he himself is also compassed about with infirmity</b> (<b>infirmity</b>, asin ch. vii. 28, that moral weakness which makes men capable of sin. It is never predicated of Christ in this sense: nay, by the terms of vii. 28, He is excluded from it. That<i> infirmity</i> of the flesh which He bore on Him, and thereby was capable of suffering and of death, was entirely distinct from this).
