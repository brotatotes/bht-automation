<b> 5.] Thus Christ also</b> (as well as those others)<b> did not glorify</b> HIMSELF<b> to be made High Priest</b> (i. e. did not raise<i> Himself</i> to the office of High Priest. The word<b> glorify</b> is here used in its most general sense, of all those steps of elevation by which the dignity might be attained: se especially John viii. 54, which is exceedingly useful to the right understanding here);<b> but He</b> (i. e. the Father)<b> who spake to Him, Thou art my Son, I have this day begotten thee</b> (see ch. i. 5, where this same saying is similarly adduced as spoken by the Heavenly Father to the Son. It must be carefully observed, that the Writer does not adduce this text as containing a direct proof of Christ’s divine appointment to the High Priesthood: that follows in the next verse: nor again, does it merely assert, without any close connexion, that the same divine Person appointed Him High Priest, who said to Him, “Thon art my Son:” but it asserts, that such divine appointment was wrapped up and already involved in that eternal generation to the Sonship which was declared in these words. Then again, we must beware of imagining that<b> he that spake unto him,</b>&c. is mere periphrasis of<i> the Father</i>, as some have done. The true account seems to be this: the word<b> glorified</b> contains in it the whole process of exaltation [through suffering] by which the Lord Jesus has attained the heavenly High Priesthood. This whole process was not<i> his own work</i>, but the Father's, John viii. 54. And in saying this, we involve every step of it, from the very beginning. Of these, unquestionably the first was, His eternal generation by the Father. He did not constitute himself the Son of God, in virtue ultimately of which sonship He<i> became High Priest.</i> And therefore in proving this, the sacred Writer adduces first the declaration of the Father which sets forth this His generation as Son of God, on which all His process of glorification depended, and then, when He was completed by sufferings, vv. 7–10, the direct declaration of his High Priesthood, also by the Father).<b> Even as also he saith in another</b> (<b>place</b>: see on ch. iv. 5),<b> Thou art priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec</b> (on the relation of this Psalm to Christ, see generally on ch. i. 13. I may add to what was there said, that it is thus declared, that He, in whom all the theocratic promises find their fulfilment, in whom the true Kingdom of God comes and is summed up, was to be, as in Zech, vi. 12 ff., “a priest upon His throne,” and such a priest [i. e. necessarily High Priest, if a King; as indeed the word is given in ver. 10 and ch. vi. 20], as should be after the order of Melchisedec. In examining this last predication, we find that<b> after the order,</b> according to the ordinary meaning of the word, imports,<i> according to the office or the rank,</i> which Melchisedec held).
