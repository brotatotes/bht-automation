<b> 7 ff.]</b> The<i> sufferings</i> of Christ are adduced, as a portion of his<i> being glorified</i> to be made High Priest. They were all in subjection to the will of the Father: they were all parts of his<i> being made perfect</i>, by virtue of which he is now, in the fullest and most glorious sense, our High Priest. So that these verses are no digression, but stand directly in the course of the argument, as proving the proposition,<i> “he glorified not himself to be made High Priest.”</i>
