<b> 7 ff.]</b> The<i> sufferings</i> of Christ are adduced, as a portion of his<i> being glorified</i> to be made High Priest. They were all in subjection to the will of the Father: they were all parts of his<i> being made perfect</i>, by virtue of which he is now, in the fullest and most glorious sense, our High Priest. So that these verses are no digression, but stand directly in the course of the argument, as proving the proposition,<i> “he glorified not himself to be made High Priest.”</i><br><br> It will be best to mark at once what I believe to be the connexion of this much-disputed sentence, and then to examine each portion in detail afterwards.<b> Who in the days of his flesh, in that he offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him that was able to save him from death, and was heard by reason of his reverent submission; though He was a Son, learned, from the things which he suffered, his obedience; and being made perfect, became the cause of eternal salvation to all who obey Him, being addressed by God as High Priest after the order of Melchisedec.</b> That is, being paraphrased— “who had a course of glorifying for the High Priest’s office to go through, not of his own choice, but appointed for Him by the Father, as is shewn by that sharp lesson of obedience (not as contrasted with disobedience, but as indicating a glorious degree of perfect obedience,<b> his obedience</b>), familiar to us all, which He, though God’s own Son, learned during the days of his flesh: when He cried to God with tears for deliverance from death, and was heard on account: of His resignation to the Father’s will [ ‘not my will but Thine be done’], &c.” Then as to details:<b> in the days of his flesh I</b> understand as a general wide date for the incident which bout to be brought in, as contrasted with His present days of glorification in the Spirit.<br><br><b> with tears</b> is not distinctly asserted in the sacred narrative: but is a most obvious inference from what is there: see Matt. xxvi. 37. There seems no reason for understanding the<b> strong crying and tears</b> of any other time than the agony at Gethsemane, as some have done. This is adduced as the most illustrious instance of that learning obedience from suffering. Epiphanius reports, that this<i> weeping</i> of the Lord in His agony was once related in some texts of St. Luke: see note on Luke xxii. 43, 44.<br><br><b> to save him from death</b> is by some understood to mean, not as generally, of rescue from the death which He was about to suffer, but of His happy deliverance from that death by the Resurrection. So also recently Ebrard. But this is not only against the usage of the phrase here used, but still more decidedly against the truth of the sacred narrative: “Father, if it be possible,<i> let this cup pass from me:”</i> for we must of course assume, that in such a designation of the Father, the contents of the prayer made to him are also indicated. The clause which follows is rendered in three different ways. 1)<i> “He was heard on account of His pious resignation.”</i> 2)<i> “He was heard, and so delivered, from that which He feared.”</i> 3)<i> “He was heard by Him who was His fear”</i> Gen. xxxi. 42, 43). I have discussed all these in my Greek Test., and have rejected 3), as far-fetched, and inconsistent with the usage of the Greek word here used: 2), as also inconsistent with the usage of that word, which signifies not terror,—His own fear, or the thing which caused that fear,—but the fear of caution, or modesty, or reverence: besides that He was not delivered from death, as this meaning would assert. So that 1) must be accepted; and it fulfils the requirements both of usage and of fact. The religious sense of this cautions fear suits remarkably well in our passage. No term could more exactly express the reverent submission to his Heavenly Father’s will which is shewn in those words, “Not my will but thine be done:” none the constant humbling of himself in comparison with the Father, and exalting him in word and deed, of which our Saviour’s life is full. I have no hesitation therefore in adopting this rendering, and feeling entirely satisfied with it. Besides the fulfilling the requisites of philology and of fact, it admirably suits the context here, where the appointment of Christ by the Father to his, High Priesthood and the various steps by which that High Priesthood was perfected, are in question.<br><br> The matter of’ fact represented by the assertion that<i> He was heard</i> may require some explanation. He<i> was heard,</i> not in the sense of the cup passing away from Him, which indeed was not the prayer of his<i> cautious fear,</i>—but in strength being ministered to Him to do and to suffer that will of his Father, to fulfil which<i> was</i> the prayer of that<i> cautious fear</i>— “not my will but thine be done.” And I have little doubt that the ord immediately refers to the “angel in Heaven strengthening Him,” of Luke xxii. 43.<br><br><b> though he was a Son]</b> This clause is to be taken by itself, not with what follows. Thus much is certain from usage: the next question is, to what these words are to be applied. We may take them with the clause immediately preceding: He was heard, although He was a Son, and thus had no need of being heard:—though He was a Son, yet not this, but his<i> reverent fear</i>, was the ground is being heard: which gives an undoubted good sense. Not much dissimilar will be the sense given by the other and more general way: viz. to take the words with the following clause: although He was a Son, He learned his obedience, not from this relation, but from his sufferings. So Chrysostom, and almost all the moderns. And there can be little doubt that this yields the better sense, und points to the deeper truth, Christ was a Son: as a Son, He was ever obedient, and ever in union with His Father’s will: but<i> His special</i> obedience, that course of submission by which He became perfected as our High Priest, was gone through<i> in Time</i>, and matter of<i> acquirement</i> for Him, and<i> practice</i>, by suffering. The ancients found this assertion startling, attributing too narrow a sense to our Lord’s<i> sufferings</i>. So Chrysostom: “He who before this had been obedient even unto death, how can He said afterwards to have learned obedience?” This indeed would be a difficulty, were the Writer speaking of the Passion only, in its stricter sense; but he is speaking, I take it, of that continuous course of new obedience entered on by new suffering, of which the prayer in Gethsemane furnishes indeed the most notable instance, but of which also almost every act of His life on earth was an example. Theophylact is so scandalized by the whole passage as applied to Christ that he says, “See how for the benefit of his reader Paul condescends, even to the appearance of uttering absurdities.”<br><br> Two mistakes must be avoided: 1) though he was<i> the</i> Son, which I find in Craik’s new translation of the Epistle: and 2) that of Whitby, that the Greek verb here means<i> “taught (us).”</i> [I have even heard the same maintained of the English verb here,<i> “learned;”</i> see an example in Ps. xxv. 4, Prayer-book version.] If such a meaning ever could be admitted, least of all could it, from the context, here, where the subject treated is entirely Christ Himself, in his completion as our High Priest, and not till this is finished does that which He became to others come into question.<b> being made perfect,</b> see note on ch. ii, 10; completed, brought to his goal of learning and suffering, through death: the time to which the word would apply is that of the Resurrection, when his triumph began: so our Lord Himself on the way to Emmaus,—<i> “Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and</i> [<i>being made perfect would come in here</i>]<i> to enter into His glory?”</i> He was made, by means of that course which ended in His<i> perfection</i>. In the words,<b> all them that obey Him</b>, there is probably an allusion to<i> “His obedience”</i> above. As he obeyed the Father, so must we obey Him, if we would be brought to that<i> “eternal salvation”</i> into which he has led the way. The expression is strictly parallel with<i> “we that have believed,”</i> ch. iv. 3, and “they that come into God by Him,” ch. vii. 25. Some have thought that in the word<b> all</b>, the Writer hints to his Jewish readers, that such salvation was not confined to them alone. But it hardly seems likely that such a by-purpose should lie in the word. The next clause,<b> being addressed, &c</b>., depends closely upon<i> “being made perfect, &c.”</i> above, and belongs to the time of Christ’s exaltation, indicated by that<i> perfection:</i> and therefore must not be divided by a semicolon, as in A.V., from the foregoing, nor supposed to refer to the whole from ver. 7. The reference is to the passage of Psalm above, and is made to confirm just been said.<b> Being addressed,</b> in this connexion, has a force of solemnity and formal appellation, implying His previous appointment and inauguration, and is hardly expressed by the slighter and more familiar “called” of the A.V.
