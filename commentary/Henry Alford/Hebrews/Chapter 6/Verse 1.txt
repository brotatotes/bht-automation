<b> CHAP. VI. 1.] Therefore</b> (on the connexion, see below)<b> leaving</b> (as behind, and done with; in order to go on to another thing: not,<i> forgetting</i>, any more than the foundation is forgotten when we rear the house upon it)<b> the word of the beginning of Christ</b> (compare above, ch, vv. 12: that word, or discourse, which has respect to the fundamental and elementary things mentioned below),<b> let us press on to maturity</b> (a question of some difficulty has divided the Commentators here: whether this sentence be meant as expressing the resolution of the Writer, as we say, “let us now proceed” to this or that,—or as conveying an exhortation to the readers. Each view has a formidable array of supporters. Owen tries [and so Delitzsch] to comprehend both meanings: giving, however, the alternative very lucidly: “The Apostle either assumes the Hebrews unto himself, as to his work, or joins himself with them as to their duty. For if the words be taken the first way, they declare his resolution in teaching: if in the latter, their duty in learning.” Between these two, both equally legitimate, the context must decide. And in seeking for elements of decision, I own that the alternative seems to me to have been put too exclusively. What I mean will be plain, when we consider on the one hand that<i> “laying the foundation”</i> can hardly be properly said of any but a<i> teacher:</i> and on the other, that vv. 4 ff. must necessarily have a general reference of warning to the hearers. It seems to me that the fact may be best stated thus: The whole is a<i> “condescension”</i> of the Writer to his readers: he with his work of teaching comes down to their level of learning, and regards that teaching and learning as all one work, going on together: himself and them as bound up in one progress. Thus best may we explain the expressions, which seem to oscillate alternately between writer and readers. And thus will<i> therefore</i> retain all its proper meaning, which on the first hypothesis was obliged to be wrested. It will mean, ‘Wherefore, seeing that we [you and I, by communication] are in so low a state babes, instead of grown men, let us, &c.’);<b> not again laying the foundation</b> (the<i> subjects</i> to be supplied to the participle<b> laying</b> are the readers, with whom the Writer unites himself, as above explained)<b> of</b> (the genitives here indicate the materials of which the foundation consists. They are all matters belonging to the<i> “discourse concerning the beginning of Christ:”</i> extending indeed in their influence over the whole Christian life, just as the shape of the foundation is that of the building: but to be laid down once for all and not afterwards repeated)<b> repentance from dead works, and faith on God</b> (so in the opening of the Gospel, Mark i. 15: and in its progress, Acts xx. 21. These were the common conditions on which all mankind were invited to embrace the Gospel. And as the readers here were Jews, so would these words especially remind them of the form in which they were first invited by Christ’s messengers. But we have to notice the qualifications which here follow each tern—repentance<b> from dead works</b>, faith<b> on God</b>. The<b> dead</b> works are taken by all the patristic expositors to mean<i> sinful</i> works. And so the great majority of Commentators also. And the justification of such an expression as<i> dead words</i> for<i> sins</i> is variously given: as<i> cansing death eternal:</i> as<i> polluting, like the touch of a dead body</i> [so Chrysostom]. But neither of these meanings is borne out: the former being contrary to usage, the latter far-fetched and unlikely. It is much letter to take the epithet in its common and obvious meaning;<i> dead, devoid of life</i> and power: compare<i> “dead faith,”</i> James ii. 17, 26, and<i> “dead sin,”</i> Rom. vii. 8; and in the references, St. Paul speaks, Eph. v. 11, in nearly the same sense:<i> “the unfruitful works of darkness.”</i> But such dead or lifeless works again may be variously understood: either of the works of the flesh in the unconverted man, or of the Jewish works of the law which could not give life. Considering the readers and object of the Epistle, it is much more likely that the latter are here meant; those works by which they sought to set up a righteousness of their own, before they submitted themselves to God's righteousness. The best explanation of<b> faith on God</b> is found in St. Paul’s language, Rom. iv. 5. And by this, our expression is defined to mean,<i> full trust, rested on God, that He has fulfilled his promises in Christ.</i> We may observe, that the things mentioned arrange themselves in groups of pairs, of which this is the first),<b> of the doctrine of washings</b> (not<i> baptisms:</i> this is a different form of the word from that generally used in the New Test. for both Christian baptism and that of John. In Mark vii. 4 ch. ix. 10, Col. ii. 12, the word is used, as here, of washing, or lustration with water. On the meaning, see below. On the construction, see in my Greek Test. As regards the plural,<b> washings</b>, it has been very variously taken for the singular: but none of the accounts of it seems to reach the point so well as that given above, which includes in the idea those various washings which were under the law, the baptism of John and even Christian baptism also perhaps included, the nature of which, and their distinctions from one another, would naturally be one of the fundamental and primary objects of teaching to Hebrew converts. When it is objected to the view [as e.g. by Stuart] that the doctrine of Jewish washings would have had nothing to do with the elements of Christian teaching, we may fairly say that such objection is is brought in mere thoughtlessness. The converts being Jews, their first and most obviously elementary instruction would be, the teaching them the typical significance of their own ceremonial law in its Christian fulfilment)<b> and of laying on of hands</b> (the doctrine of laying on of hands, like that of washings, not being confined to any one special rite, will mean, the reference and import of all that imposition of hands which was practiced under the law, and found in some eases its continuance under the Gospel. By laying on of hands, the sick were healed, Mark xvi. 18; Acts ix. 12, 17; xxviii. 8; compare 2 Kings v. 11; Matt. ix. 18, &c.; officers and teachers of the Church were admitted to their calling, Acts vi. 6; xiii. 3; 1 Tim. iv. 14; v. 22; Num. viii. 10; xxvii. 18, 23; Deut. xxxiv. 9; converts were fully admitted into the Christian Church after baptism, Acts viii. 17; xix. 6; 2 Tim. i. 6. And there can be little doubt that it is mainly to this last that the attention of the readers is here called, as the Writer is speaking of the beginning of Christian teaching),<b> and</b> [<b>of</b>]<b> resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment</b> (these words, as well as the foregoing clause, depend on<b> doctrine</b>. These also were points of Jewish doctrine, confirmed and brought into clearer light by the Gospel. Some have supposed<b> the resurrection of the dead</b> to refer only to the righteous, as in John vi. 39, 40, 44, 54,—<b>eternal judgment</b> only to the wicked. But it is more probable, in a passage of such very general reference, that the Writer speaks generally, without any such distinction here in view, of the two doctrines: of the<i> “resurrection of life” and the</i> “resurrection of judgment” of John v. 29. And it is probable that he uses<b> judgment</b> in the same indefinite meaning: see Act xxiv. 25.<br><br><b> eternal</b>, probably as part of the proceedings of eternity, and thus bearing ing the character and stamp of eternal: or perhaps, as Theophylact, the judgment which decides men’s eternal fate).
