<b> 11.] But</b> (carries a slight reproof, contrasting your need of exhortation to constancy with your past and partially remaining present practice)<b> we earnestly desire</b> (a fervent heartfelt expression)<b> that every one of you</b> ( “he cares alike for great and small, knowing all, and passing over none.” Chrysostom)<b> do shew the same diligence</b> (not, as some explain, the same which<i> some have already shewn:</i> nor, the same as<i> ye have already shewn,</i> as Chrysostom and others, which would imply that the Writer was satisfied with their state hitherto, and only desired its continuance: an inference at variance with the facts of the Epistle: but, the same, with a view to<i> the full assurance of hope</i><i> unto the end,</i> as they had already shewn with regard to the necessities of the saints)<b> with regard to</b> (the employment which this diligence is to find: the object with reference to which it is to energize)<b> the full assurance</b> (not, as some,<i> the full</i><i> formation</i>, objective,—which is against the New Test. usage of the word rendered)<b> of your hope until the end</b> (see ch. iii. 14. The words<b> until the end</b> belong to the whole sentence, not to the verb, nor to<i> “the full assurance of hope” only.</i> “The end” is the coming of the Lord, looked for as close at hand; see note as above):<b> that ye become not</b> (<i> “be not”</i> misses the fine delicacy of the Writer, implying that the dulness which he deprecates was indeed commenced, but might be broken off. Compare ch. v. 11, where they are said to have become<i> dull of hearing</i>—the same adjective in the Greek. It is true that there is no contradiction between the two verses—the one being of sluggishness in hearing, the other in Christian practice),<b> sluggish, but</b> (this again brings in a strong contrast— “nay, but rather:” passing to another subject altogether, as it were. See on ch. ii. 6)<b> imitators of them who through faith and endurance</b> (see Col. i. 11, also ver. 15; James v. 7, 8. That constant and patient waiting is implied, without which faith would be made void: of which it is said, “It is good that a man should both hope and wait for the salvation of the Lord”)<b> inherit the promises</b> (what is meant by this, and who are indicated by the expression? The two questions are very closely connected together. First observe that the verb is not past,<i> who... inherited,</i> but present: said not of any one act by which these persons entered on the inheritance of the promise, but of (1) a state now going on,<i> “who are inheriting,”</i> or (2) in mere predication,<i> “who are inheritors of.”</i> That the first cannot be meant, is clear: for in ch. xi. where he enumerates the examples of faith and patience, he says,<i> “These all... received not the promise.”</i> The same consideration would prevent the reference very commonly here supposed, to Abraham and the patriarchs. Taking then (2), we may regard the designation as used without reference to time, but as indicative of office, or standing, or privilege. Thus the reference of the words will be perfectly general: not,<i> who have inherited,</i> nor<i> who shall inherit,</i> nor<i> who are inheriting,</i> but<i> “who are inheritors of,”</i><i> who inherit,</i> in all times and under all circumstances. Of these, Abraham is chosen as the most illustrious example).
