<p><strong> 12</strong> .] <strong> that ye become not</strong> (“ <em> be not</em> ” misses the fine delicacy of the Writer: as Chrys., ἵνα μὴ νωθροὶ γένησθε , ἀκμὴν γένησθε . καὶ μὴν ἀνωτέρω ἔλεγεν , ἐπεὶ νωθροὶ γεγόνατε ταῖς ἀκοαῖς . ἀλλ ʼ ὅρα πῶς ἐκεῖ μέχρι τῆς ἀκοῆς τὴν νωθρότητα ἔστησεν . ἐνταῦθά τε καὶ αὐτὸ τοῦτο φθέγγεται , ἀλλ ʼ ἕτερόν τι αἰνίττεται · ἀντὶ γὰρ τοῦ εἰπεῖν , μὴ ἐναπομείνητε τῇ ῥᾳθυμίᾳ , μὴ νωθροὶ γένησθε , εἶπε . πάλιν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν μέλλοντα ἐξάγει καιρὸν τὸν ἀνεύθυνον , εἰπών , ἵνα μὴ νωθροὶ γένησθε · ἐκείνου γὰρ τοῦ μήπω παρόντος οὐκ ἂν εἴημεν ὑπεύθυνοι . ὁ μὲν γὰρ εἰς τὸ παρὸν παρακαλούμενος σπουδάζειν , ὡς ῥᾳθυμῶν , ἴσως καὶ ὀκνηρότερος ἔσται · ὁ δὲ εἰς τὸ μέλλον , οὐχ οὕτως ) <strong> sluggish</strong> (see on ref. Lünemann observes that this <strong> μὴ νωθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γένησθε</strong> is in no contradiction to νωθ . γεγόνατε there, the one being of sluggishness in hearing, the other in Christian practice. See Chrys. above), <strong> but</strong> (this again is a <strong> δέ</strong> bringing in a strong contrast ‘nay, but rather:’ passing to another subject altogether, as it were. See on ch. Heb 2:6 ) <strong> imitators</strong> (a favourite word with St. Paul, see reff.: Xen. Mem. i. 6. 3, οἱ διδάσκαλοι τοὺς μαθητὰς μιμητὰς ἑαυτῶν ἀποδεικνύουσι . Herodian vi. 8. 5, ὡς μὴ μαθητὰς εἶναι μόνον , ἀλλὰ ζηλωτὰς καὶ μιμητὰς τῆς ἐκείνου ἀνδρείας ) <strong> of them who through faith and endurance</strong> (see ref. Col., also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:15">Hebrews 6:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7-8">James 5:7-8</span> . Both the noun and the verb belong to later Greek. They form a contrast to ὀξύ - θυμος , - έω , earlier and classical words. Here, that constant and patient waiting is implied, without which faith would be made void: of which it is said, “It is good that a man should both hope and wait for the salvation of the Lord.” But there is no Hendiadys: faith is one thing, endurance another, superadded upon it) <strong> inherit the promises</strong> (what is meant by κληρονομούντων τὰς ἐπαγγελίας , and who are indicated by the expression? The two questions are very closely connected together. First observe that the participle is not κληρονομησάντων , but present: said not of any one act by which these persons entered on the inheritance of the promises, but of either, 1. a state now going on, ‘ <em> who are inheriting</em> ,’ or, 2. in mere predication, ‘ <em> who are inheritors of</em> .’ That the first cannot be meant, is clear: for in ch. 11 where he enumerates the examples of faith and patience, he says, οὗτοι πάντες … οὐκ ἐκομίσαντο τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν . This same consideration will prevent the reference very commonly here supposed, to Abraham and the patriarchs. Taking then (2), we may regard the participle as ὁ πειράζων and the like, used without reference to time, but as indicative of office, or standing, or privilege. Thus the reference of the words will be perfectly general: not, <em> who have inherited</em> , nor <em> who shall inherit</em> , nor <em> who are inheriting</em> , but ‘ <em> who are inheritors of,’ who inherit</em> , in all times and under all circumstances. Of these, Abraham is chosen as the most illustrious example).</p>
