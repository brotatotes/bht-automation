<b> 13.] For</b> “in these words he does not render a reason why we should imitate those just mentioned, but a reason, why he mentions them. A man might ask whether there are any such, and who they are? So in these words he introduces Abraham, the father of all the faithful, who was most enduring in his faith, and reaped most fruit from it.” Schlichting)<b> God when He promised</b> (Bleek well remarks, that<b> promised</b> is to be taken not only as “made a promise,” but in the Messianic sense,<i> “gave the promise,”</i> as<i> “the promises”</i> above, and vv. 15, 17, ch. vii. 6; Rom. ix. 4; Gal. iii, 16)<b> to Abraham, since He could swear by none</b> (no<i> person</i>)<b> greater, swore by Himself, saying, Surely blessing I will bless</b> (at first the participle, on, seems to have had a certain emphasis: but afterwards this was lost, and the expression became a mere formula)<b> thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. And thus</b> (i. e.<i> when he had received this promise</i>,—being in this state of dependence on the divine promise),<b> having endured with patience</b> (viz. in his waiting so long for God’s promise to be fulfilled—in having, when it was partially fulfilled, again shewn noble endurance in the will of God by offering up Isaac),<b> he obtained the promise</b> (i. e. not as Bleek, he had made to him the promise above related: this would merely stultify the sentence, which proceeds on the faithfulness of God, confirming his promise with an oath by Himself, and the faith and endurance of Abraham, waiting for that promise to be fulfilled: but as Lünemann, he<i> obtained</i>,<i> got fulfilled to him</i>, the promise, the thing promised, to wit, the birth of Isaac, as the commencement of the fulfilment—as much of it as he could see. And thus Abraham became inheritor of the promises. That there is here no inconsistency with ch. xi. 39, see shewn there).
