Poterat enim aliquis quærere, an tales aliqui sint, et quinam sint? his ergo verbis in exemplum istius rei adducit patrem omnium credentium Abrahamum, qui et in fide fuit constantissimus, et istius fidei fructum tulit maximum.” Schlichting)  God when He promised (not, as De W., Lün., al.,  having promised : for in matter of fact the oath preceded the statement of the promise, cf. Heb 6:14 below: but the aor. participle, as so often, is contemporaneous with the aor. verb, as in ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπε , &c. Bleek well remarks, that ἐπαγγειλάμενος is to be taken not only as “made a promise,” but in the Messianic sense, “  gave the promise ,” as τὰς ἐπαγγελίας above, and ἡ ἐπαγγελία Hebrews 6:15 ; Heb 6:17 al., αἱ ἐπαγγελίαι ch.

See reff.)  swear by (the classical construction of  ὄμνυμι is with an accus. of the person sworn by, ὄμνυμι τοὺς θεούς : but  κατά with a gen, is found when a thing is used as binding the oath, as ὄμνυμι κατ ʼ ἐξολείας , Demosth, p. 553. 17 al.; καθ ʼ ἱερῶν , p. 1306. 21 al. And this construction, applied to  persons , appears to have arisen from that other. See Bleek’s note)  none (masc.)  greater, swore by Himself (a singularly coincident passage occurs, of the same promise, in Philo, Legg. Allegor. iii. 72, vol. i. p. 127: εὖ καὶ τῷ ὅρκῳ βεβαιώσας τὴν ὑπόσχεσιν , καὶ ὅρκῳ θεοπρεπεῖ . ὁρᾷς γὰρ ὅτι οὐ καθ ʼ ἑτέρου ὀμνύει θεός , οὐδὲν γὰρ αὐτοῦ κρεῖττον , ἀλλὰ καθ ʼ ἑαυτοῦ , ὅς ἐστι πάντων ἄριστος ),
