The expression occurs in formulæ jurandi in several places in the LXX (as e. g. Ezekiel 33:27 , ζῶ ἐγώ , εἰ μὴν οἱ ἐν ταῖς ἠρημωμέναις μαχαίραις πεσοῦνται : see also ib.

Bleek thinks it came from the Hebraistic formula εἰ μή , which has sometimes been written and edited for it)  blessing I will bless (thus frequently the LXX, for the Heb. idiomatic conjuction of the absolute infinitive with the finite verb: but sometimes they have it where the Heb. has no such conjunction, as in 1 Kings 2:25 ; and something like it is found even in Greek writers, as e. g.
