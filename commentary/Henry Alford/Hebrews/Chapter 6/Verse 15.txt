It then signifies,  when he had received this promise being in this state of dependence on the divine promise: see below, and reff.)  having endured with patience (viz. in his waiting so long for God’s promise to be fulfilled in having, when it was partially fulfilled, again shewn noble endurance in the will of God by offering up Isaac),  he obtained the promise (i. e. not as Bleek, he had made to him the promise above related: this would nearly stultify the sentence, which proceeds on the faithfulness of God, confirming his promise with an oath by Himself, and the faith and endurance of Abraham, waiting for that promise to be fulfilled: but as Lün., he  obtained, got fulfilled to him , the promise, the thing promised, to wit, the birth of Isaac, as the commencement of the fulfilment as much of it as he could see. And thus Abraham became a κληρονόμος τῶν ἐπαγγελιῶν . That there is here no inconsistency with ch. Hebrews 11:39 , see shewn there.  ἐπιτυγχάνω is always used of the actual getting in possession: ὁλκάδος ἀναγομένης ἐπέτυχον , Thuc. iii. 3: εἰ ἀγαθοῦ ὠνητοῦ ἐπιτύχοιμι , Xen.
