<b> 17.] In which behalf</b> (nearly equivalent to “wherefore.” This seems the best rendering, and not, with the A.V., to take it as signifying<i> wherein</i> or<i> in which</i>)<b> God, willing to shew more abundantly</b> (than he would have done without an oath)<b> to the heirs of the promise</b> (from ch. xi. 9, Isaac and Jacob were<i> “co-heirs of the same promise”</i> with Abraham. But there is no need to confine the title to them: it may well be extended down to us, who are “the seed of Abraham and heirs according to the promise,” Gal. iii. 29)<b> the unchangeableness of His counsel, interposed</b> (became mediator: so Josephus says in one place, “They said these things with an oath, and constituted God the Mediator of their promises.” And thus when He Himself swears, having no greater to swear by, He swears by Himself, so making Himself as it were a third person between the parties to the oath)<b> with an oath</b> (the instrument: it was by means of the oath that He exercised the office of interposer or<i> Mediator</i>):<b> that by means of two</b> ( “what two?” says Chrysostom: and replies, “the saying and promising, the adding an oath to His promise.” The Writer is impressing on us the strength of that<i> method of assurance</i> which God has been pleased to give us, in that He has not only promised [in both cases in question], but also confirmed it by an oath)<b> unchangeable things, in which</b> (as the material of the lie, if it were possible)<b> it is impossible for God ever</b> (this force is given by the original construction, which distributes the proposition into separate incidents)<b> to lie</b> (in each and either of them, it is out of all question that falsehood should be suspected in Him),<b> we may have strong encouragement</b> (or,<b> exhortation</b>, which amounts to the same better than<i> consolation:</i> see ch. xii. 5, xiii. 22, where the same Greek word occurs),<b> who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope</b> (taken here objectively, or very nearly so: hope as embodying the thing hoped for)<b> set before us</b> (proposed to us as a prize in a contest):<b> which</b> (viz. the hope: in its subjective resting on objective grounds now to be set forth)<b> we have</b> (not,<i> “we hold fast,</i>” as some)<b> as an anchor of our soul</b> (the similitude is a very common one in Greek and Roman writers; and on coins and medals, where hope is represented by an anchor. A saying is attributed to Socrates, “A ship is not to he held by one anchor, nor life by one hope”),<b> safe and firm</b> (the adjectives belong to<b> anchor</b>, not to “which [hope].” An anchor may be unsafe and unsteady, as well as safe and firm),<b> and entering into the part within the veil</b> (first, to what is<b> entering in</b> to be referred? to the<i> anchor</i>, or to the<i> hope?</i> The former is the more obvious construction: and has been accepted by many, thus explaining it: “As a ship’s anchor does not fasten in the water, but enters the earth beneath the water, and there fixes: so our hope, the anchor of the soul, thinks it not enough to enter the vestibule, i.e. is not content with earthly and visible blessings, but penetrates even to those things which are within the veil, even into the very Holy of Holies: i.e. lays hold of God Himself, and heavenly blessings, and fixes on them.” Estius. This is said by Bleek to be too artificial, and he, with some others, takes<i> hope</i> as that which enters within the veil, simply, the figure being dropped. But I must say that I prefer the other, being as it seems to me the simpler view. “Two figures are here not so much mixed, as wonderfully combined. The Writer might have compared the world to a sea, the soul to a ship, the future yet hidden glory to the concealed bottom of the deep, the far off terra firma, stretching away under the water and covered by it. Or, he might have compared the present earthly life with the forecourt, and the future blessedness with the heavenly sanctuary which is concealed from us as by a veil. But he has combined both these, ‘The Soul clings, as one in fear of shipwreck, to an anchor, and sees not whither the cable of the anchor runs,—where it is fastened: but she knows, that it is fastened behind the veil which hides the future glory, and that she, if she only holds on to the anchor, shall in her time be drawn in where it is, into the holiest place, by the hand of the Deliverer.” Ebrard. This is very beautiful, and in the main, simple and natural: only going off into fancy at the end,—which is not required for the interpretation. The word here used was the name for the second veil or curtain [ch. ix. 3], which shut in the Holy of Holies; the first or outer one being called by another name),<b> where as forerunner</b> (not<i> “the forerunner,”</i> as A.V.)<b> on our behalf</b> (as representing, and introducing, us, who are to come after. It is a figure analogous, in its propriety, to that where our Lord is described as<i> firstfruits of them that slept</i>,<i> firstborn of the dead</i>, in theirs. And it is one full of comfort to us: for, as Theophylact says, “A forerunner must be so with reference to some that follow, and there is not generally any entire difference between the forerunner and his followers, as neither was there between John and Christ. Be not then faint-hearted: we shall very soon enter where our forerunner has entered”)<b> entered Jesus, having be-come</b> (see on ch. ii. 17)<b> a High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec</b> (the stress is on these last words. And this is so, because it is this particular point to which the Writer wishes to return in what follows. He assumes for the present the eternal priesthood as conceded, and takes up the mysterious point which he left at ch. v. 10, for elucidation. And thus ends the digression which began there).
