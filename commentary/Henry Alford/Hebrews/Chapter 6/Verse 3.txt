<b> 3.] And this we will do</b> (this has been variously interpreted. Grotins, and several others, who suppose [see above] that<i> “let us go on,”</i> in ver. 1, expresses the determination of the Writer, take it as referring to the participial clause,<i> “not laying again the foundation,”</i> and as meaning,<i> “even</i> [<i>also</i>]<i> this</i> [<i>viz., laying again the foundation</i>]<i> we will do.”</i> But besides that the words will not bear it, no convenient sense would be yielded by such a reference. For having asserted on this hypothesis that even the relaying of the foundation should be done, if God will, he goes on to say, “For it is impossible,”&c., which would in no way [see below] fit in to the context. This being so, others, still regarding<i> “let us go on”</i> as the first, refer the future,<b> we will do,</b> to the<i> thus going on</i>. So Theophylact, “<b>This will we do</b>: what? go on to perfection.” And doubtless so a very good sense is given. In favour of the reading<b> let us do</b>, it may be said, that it corresponds better with the hortatory tone of<i> “let us go on”</i> above, and though the less obvious reading, is more in accordance with the style of the Epistle) if, that is (the effect of the word here used, in hypothetical sentences like the present, is to assume the hypothesis as altogether requisite to the previous position),<b> God permit</b> (it may here again be said, that the addition after the hortatory<b> let us do</b> is as delicate and beautiful, as it is frigid in the common acceptation after the indicative<i> “we will do.”</i> For it is God who worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure, Phil. ii. 13. And it leads the way beautifully to what follows: “If,” I say, “God permit: for when men have once fallen away, it is a thing impossible,”&c.).
