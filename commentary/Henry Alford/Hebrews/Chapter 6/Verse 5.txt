<b> 5.] and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come</b> (what is<i> the good word of God?</i> The epithet is frequently applied to the word of God: see 1 Kings viii. 56; 2 Kings xx. 19; Neh. ix. 13; Jer. xxix. 10; Zech. i. 13; Rom. vii, 12; and usually with reference to its quickening, comforting, strengthening power, as sent or spoken by God to men. And in consequence if has been taken here to signify the comforting portion of the gospel, its promises. But it is better to take it more generally, as the wholesome and soul-preserving utterance of God in the gospel.<br><br> Then it is a far more debated question, what is meant by<b> the powers of the world</b> (literally,<b> age</b>)<b> to come</b>. Some have said, those<i> powerful foretastes of glory</i> which belong indeed to the future state in their fulness, but are vouchsafed to believers here. But most Commentators, and rightly,<b> take the age to come</b> as equivalent to<i> “the world to come,”</i> ch. ii. 5 [where see note], and as designating the Christian times, agreeably to that name of Christ in Isa. ix. 6, in the Septuagint,<i> “the Father of the age to come.”</i> Then the<i> powers</i> of this “world to come” be the spiritual gifts, given by the Spirit in measure to all who believed, “distributing severally to every man as He will.” We need not necessarily limit these to external miraculous powers, or even<i> prophecy</i> and the like: but surely may include in them spiritual powers bestowed in virtue of the indwelling Spirit to arm the Christian for his conflict with sin, the world, and the devil),<b> and have fallen away</b> (this expression is used here, as<i> “sinning willingly,”</i> ch. x. 26, and<i> “departing from the living God,”</i> ch. iii. 12,—see also ch. x. 29, and ch. ii. 1,—as pointing out the sin of apostasy from Christ: similar to that of the Galatians, Gal. v. 4; and iii. 3. The fear was [see Introd.§iv. 1 [lest these Hebrew converts should cast away their confidence in Christ, and take up again that system of types and shadows which He came to fulfil and abrogate: and nearly connected with this peril was their small progress in the doctrine of Christ. While speaking therefore of that, and exhorting them to be advancing towards maturity, he puts in this solemn caution against the fearful result to which their backwardness might lead),—<b>to renew</b> [them]<b> again unto repentance</b> (there is no superfluity, as Grotius thought, in<b> to renew again</b>. For the<b> renewing</b> would be the regenerating in any case, and the<b> again renewing</b> the renewal of it. Even in the first case, man is<i> renewed:</i> in the second case is<b> again</b><i> renewed</i>. “Instead of<b> unto repentance</b>, one would expect<i> in repentance</i>, or<i> by repentance</i>, inasmuch as<i> renewal</i> in full measure can only be brought about by<i> repentance</i>, amd must therefore be preceded by it. But on the other side,<i> repentance</i> itself, the change of disposition, may be considered as the result of the renewal of the man having taken place; and so is it here: to renew to<i> repentance</i>, i.e. so to form anew, that entire change of disposition precedes.” Bleck. There was a very general ancient reference of this to<i> renewal of baptism;</i> of which view I have given examples in my Greek Test.);<b> crucifying as they do</b> (<i> “seeing they crucify,”</i> as A.V. well)<b> afresh</b> (some have questioned the possibility of the word here meaning to crucify<b> afresh,</b> and would render it simply<i> “crucify.”</i> But it seems hardly doubtful that the meaning, as here given, is contained in it)<b> to themselves</b> (Christ was their possession by faith: this their possession they took, and recrucified to themselves: deprived themselves of all benefit from Him, just as did the unbelieving Jews who nailed Him to the tree. He who should have been their gain was made their loss)<b> the Son of God</b> (for solemnity, to shew the magnitude of the offence),<b> and putting</b> (<b>Him</b>)<b> to open shame</b> (they crucify Him anew, and as at his former crucifixion, put Him to shame before all: as Bleek strikingly says, they tear Him out of the recesses of their hearts where He had fixed his abode, and exhibit Him to the open scoffs and reproach of the world, as something powerless and common: compare ch. x. 29. It would be quite beyond the limits of mere annotation, to give any satisfactory analysis of the history of interpretation of this passage, and of the conflicts which have sprung up around it. Such accounts will be found admirably given in several of the Commentators, among whom I would especially mention; and for the English reader, Owen, who treats it at great length and very perspicuously. I will only mention the most notable points, and set down a few landmarks of the exposition. 1) The passage was used by the Montanists and the Novatians, in ancient times, to justify the irrevocable exclusion from the church of those who had lapsed. But 2) in the Catholic church, this view was ever resisted, and the Fathers found in the passage simply a prohibition against the repetition of baptism. And so all the ancients who have noticed the passage, and some of the moderns. 3) In later times the great combat over our passage has been between the Calvinistic and the Arminian expositors. To favour their peculiar views of indefectibility, the former have endeavoured to weaken the force of the participial clauses as implying any real participation in the spiritual. So Calvin himself, and Beza: so Owen [ “the persons here intended are not true and sincere believers.... for 1) in their full and large description there is no mention of faith or believing,”&c.], and recently Tait, Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews. But all is clearly wrong, and contrary to the plainest sense of the terms here used. The Writer even heaps clause upon clause, to show that no such shallow tasting is intended: and the whole contextual argument is against the view, for it is the very fact of these precious having veritably entered the spiritual life, which makes it impossible to renew them afresh if the fall away. If they have never entered if, if they are unregenerate, what possible logic is it, or even common sense at all, to say, that their shallow taste and partial apprehension makes it impossible to renew them? what again to say, that it is impossible<i> to renew again</i> persons in whose case no<i> renewal</i> has ever taken place? If they never have believed, never been regenerated, how can it be more difficult to renew them to repentance, than the heathen, or any unconverted persons? One landmark of exposition then must be, to hold fast the simple plain sense of the passage, and recognize the fact that the persons are truly the partakers of the spiritual life—regenerate by the Holy Spirit.<i> Elect</i> of course they are not, or they could not fall away, by the very force of the term: but this is one among many passages where in the Scripture, as ever from the teaching of the Church, we learn that<i> “elect”</i> and<i> “regenerate”</i> are not convertible terms. All elect are regenerate: but all regenerate are not elect. The regenerate may full away, the elect never can. 4) Again the word<b> impossible</b> has been weakened down to<i> “difficult.”</i> The readers of this commentary will not need reminding, that no such sense ean be for a moment tolerated. And this is our second landmark of explanation: this word<b> impossible</b><i> stands immoveable</i>. But let us see where, and how, it stands. It is the strongest possible ease which the Writer is putting. First there is<i> considerable advance in the spiritual life,</i> carefully and specifically indicated. Then there is<i> deliberate apostasy:</i> an enmity to Him whom they before loved, a going over to the ranks of His bitter enemies and revilers, and an exposing Him to shame in the sight of the world. Of such persons, such apostates from being such saints, the Winter simply says that it is impossible to bestow on them a fresh renewal to repentance. There remaineth<i> no more</i> sacrifice for sin than that One which they have gone through and rejected: they are in the state of crucifying the Son of God: the putting Him to shame is their enduring condition.<br><br> How is it possible then to renew them to repentance? It is simply impossible, from the very nature of the ease. ‘The question is not, it seems to me, whether man’s ministry or God’s power is to be supplied as the agent, nor even whether the verb is active or passive [ “to renew them,” or, “that they should be renewed”]: the impossibility merely within the limits of the hypothesis itself. Whether God, of His infinite mercy and almighty power, will ever, by judgments or the strong work of His Spirit reclaim the obdurate sinner, so that even<i> he</i> may look on Him whom he has pierced, is, thank Him, a question which neither this, nor any other passage of Scripture, precludes us from entertaining. There is no barring here of God’s grace, but just as 1 have observed above, an axiomatic preclusion by the very hypothesis itself, of a renewal to repentance of those who have passed through, and rejected for themselves, God’s appointed means of renewal. 5) Another dispute over our passage has been, whether the<i> sin against the Holy Ghost</i> is in any way brought in here. Certainly we may say that the fall here spoken of cannot be identical with that sin: for as Bleek has well remarked, that sin may be predicated of persons altogether outside the Christian Church, as were those with reference to whom our Lord uttered His awful saying on it. It is true, the language used in the parallel place, ch. x. 29, does approach that sin, where he says,<i> “have done despite to the Spirit of grace:”</i> but it is also clear that the impossibility here spoken of cannot depend ou the fact of such sin having been committed, by the construction of the sentence, which itself renders the reason for that impossibility).
