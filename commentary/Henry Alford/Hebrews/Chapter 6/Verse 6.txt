<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <strong> and have fallen away</strong> (the classical usage of <strong> παραπίπτω</strong> is very different, as will be seen from the following examples: Herod. viii. 87, κατὰ τύχην παραπεσοῦσα νηῦς , i. e. impinging, coming into collision: Plato, Phileb. p. 14 C, τὸν νῦν δὲ παραπεσόντα ( λόγον ), “eum sermonem qui nobis se obtulit:” Legg. iii. p. 686, ἔδοξέ μοι θαυμαστὸν κτῆμα παραπεσεῖν τοῖς Ἕλλησιν , “Græcis accidisse.” We first find trace of our present meaning in Xenophon, Hell. i. 6. 4, διαθροούντων … ὅτι Λακεδαιμόνιοι μέγιστα παραπίπτοιεν ἐν τῷ διαλλάττειν τοὺς ναυαρχοὺς κ . τ . λ . Polyb. uses it frequently in this sense, but commonly with a gen. of that from which: so iii. 54. 5, πᾶν τὸ παραπεσὸν τῆς ὁδοῦ : xii. 7. 2, παραπίπτειν τῆς ἀληθείας : viii. 13. 8, τοῦ καθήκοντος : and xviii. 19. 6 absolutely, τοῖς ὅλοις πράγμασιν ἀγνοεῖν ἔφη καὶ παραπίπτειν αὐτόν . In the LXX it occurs often (reff.) in the ethical sense, and the cognate noun παράπτωμα often in the N. T. It is used here, as ἑκουσίως ἀμαρτάνειν , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span> , and ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ θεοῦ ζῶντος , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span> , see also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span> , and παραρυῶμεν ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:1">Hebrews 2:1</span> , as pointing out the sin of apostasy from Christ: and the case supposed is very similar to that of the Galatians, to whom St. Paul says, κατηργήθητε ἀπὸ [ τοῦ ] χριστοῦ οἵτινες ἐν νόμῳ δικαιοῦσθε , τῆς χάριτος ἐξεπέσατε , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:4">Galatians 5:4</span> ; and ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:3">Galatians 3:3</span> , ἐναρξάμενοι πνεύματι νῦν σαρκὶ ἐπιτελεῖσθε ; The fear was (see Prolegg. § iv. 1) lest these Hebrew converts should cast away their confidence in Christ, and take up again that system of types and shadows which He came to fulfil and abrogate: and nearly connected with this peril was their small progress in the doctrine of Christ. While speaking therefore of that, and exhorting them to be advancing towards maturity, he puts in this solemn caution against the fearful result to which their backwardness might lead), <strong> again</strong> ( <strong> πάλιν</strong> does not belong to παραπεσόντας , but to ἀνακαινίζειν : the usual place of πάλιν , and the unvarying place in this Epistle, being before the verb to which it belongs) <strong> to renew</strong> (them) <strong> to repentance</strong> (there is no pleonasm, as Grotius thought, in πάλιν ἀνακαινίζειν . For the <strong> ἀνακαινίζειν</strong> would be the regenerating in any case, and the <strong> πάλιν</strong> ἀνακ ., the renewal of it. Even in the first case, man ἀνακαινίζεται : in the second case, <strong> πάλιν</strong> ἀνακαινίζεται . As to the word, it is found, after Isocr. as in reff., in Appian, Lucian, Josephus (Antt. ix. 8. 2, βασιλέα Ἰώασον ὁρμή τις ἔλαβε τὸν ναὸν ἀνακαινίσαι τοῦ θεοῦ ), Philo (Legat. ad Cai. § 11, vol. ii. p. 558, ἀνισότητα , τὴν ἀδικίας ἀρχήν , ἀνεκαίνισεν ἰσότητι , ἥτις ἐστὶ πηγὴ δικαιοσύνης ), and freq. in LXX. Observe St. Paul’s usage in reff. The usage of the word, as Bleek remarks, is without reference to any previous existence of the state into which the renewal takes place: e. g. we cannot say here that the perfect state of man before the fall was in the Writer’s mind. The verb is active, and implies a subject. This by some is made to be the foregoing accusatives, and ἑαυτούς is supplied after ἀνακαινίζειν : so Origen cites it (in Joann. tom. xx. 12, vol. iv. p. 322, ἀνακαινίζειν ἑαυτόν in some mss., ἀνακαινισμὸν ποιεῖν ἑαυτῶν in others): so vulg. (“ <em> renovari</em> ”), and Erasmus, Vatabl., al. But it is far better, as in the translation, and usually, to make the subject indefinite: “it is impossible to” &amp;c. “Instead of <strong> εἰς μετάνοιαν</strong> , one would expect ἐν μετανοίᾳ or διὰ μετανοίας , inasmuch as ὰνακαινίζεσθαι in full measure can only be brought about by μετάνοια , and must therefore be preceded by it. But on the other side, μετάνοια itself, the change of disposition, may be considered as the result of the renewal of the man having taken place: and so it is here: to renew to μετάνοια , i. e. so to form anew, that entire change of disposition precedes.” Bleek. On the very general ancient reference of this to renewal of baptism, see below.
	</p>
<p>It is really marvellous, that such a note as this of Dr. Burton’s could have been written in England in the present century: “ ἀνακαινίζειν , <em> once more to make them new creatures by baptism</em> , εἰς μετάνοιαν , <em> upon their repentance</em> . Even if they repent, there is no power to readmit them by baptism”), <strong> crucifying as they do</strong> (“ <em> seeing they crucify</em> ” as E. V. well. The ratiocinative force is given by the omission of the article before the participle, as the demonstrative would be by its insertion. Some ancient Commentators, especially those who refer the foregoing clause to the repetition of baptism, join these participles closely to the verb ἀνακαινίζειν , as epexegetical of it; as indicating, that is, what such a πάλιν ἀνακαινίζειν εἰς μετ . would be: that it would amount to a new crucifying and putting to shame the Son of God: and they refer to St. Paul’s declaration, that in baptism is symbolized the crucifixion of the old man with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3">Romans 6:3</span> ff.), and understand it thus, that if baptism be repeated, Christ also would appear to be crucified anew. So Chrys., Thdrt., Eulogius (Phot. Bibl. 280, ed. Bekk. p. 538 a), Phot. (in Œc.), Œc. ( ὁ τοίνυν , φησίν , οἰόμενος εἶναι δεύτερον βάπτισμα , ὅσον τὸ κατ ʼ αὐτόν , ἄνωθεν σταυροῖ τὸν κύριον . τί γὰρ ἕτερον ποιεῖ ὁ δεύτερον αὐτῷ διὰ τοῦ βαπτίσματος συσταυροῦσθαι νομίζων , ἢ ὅτι καὶ αὐτὸν ἡγεῖται δεύτερον ἐσταυρῶσθαι , δι ʼ ὧν ποιεῖ ; τὸ δὲ δεύτερον σταυροῦν , φησί , τὸν χριστόν , τὸ ὅσον ἦκεν εἰς αὐτόν , οὐδὲν ἕτερόν ἐστιν ἢ παραδειγματίσαι αυτὸν καὶ καταισχῦναι . ἅπαξ γὰρ σταυρωθείς , ἀθάνατός ἐστι λοιπόν . ὁ δὲ ἀνασταυρῶν , ψεῦδος τοῦτο ποιεῖ , ὅπερ αἰσχύνην αὐτῷ φέρει ὡς ψευσαμένῳ τὸ ἅπαξ ἀποθανεῖν μόνον ), Schol. Matthiæ, Thl., and similarly Faber Stapulensis, Erasm. (par.), Clarius. And so Calvin takes the connexion, even though he does not understand the foregoing of the repetition of baptism: that it is impossible that they should again be renewed to repentance, and their fall from Christ be forgiven them, for that thus God would be again crucifying His Son and putting Him to shame. This Beza also mentions as an alternative (giving it indeed his approval, “quam sententiam si amplectamur, uti sane probabilis et commoda mihi videtur, tum pro ‘ut qui rursum crucifigant,’ scribendum erit, ‘rursum crucifigendo, et ad ignominiam exponendo’ ”). “But besides that which Seb. Schmidt adduces against the Greek Commentators, that they wrongly assume <em> Christ</em> to be crucified in baptism, whereas it is only our old man that is crucified, the whole construction is, grammatically speaking, very unnatural; and only tolerable, if the men spoken of, whose renewal is said to be impossible, were not the object but the subject, if, that is, instead of ἀνακαινίζειν we had a passive, or it could be taken intransitively. And since this cannot be done, it is only possible, grammatically, to take the participles as a close specification of the foregoing object, an emphatic setting forth of the grievous offence of which they have become guilty by their apostasy, and on account of which it has become impossible to renew them again to repentance.” Bleek) <strong> afresh</strong> (it has been questioned by Lambert Bos, Exercitt., whether <strong> ἀνασταυροῦν</strong> can bear this meaning. He, and others who have taken his view, adduce multitudes of instances of the use of the word in the simple sense of ‘to crucify,’ the ἀνά being merely ‘ <em> up</em> ,’ as in ἀνακρεμάω , ἀναρτάω , ἀνασκολοπίζω , &amp;c. So in Herod. vi. 30, τὸ μὲν αὐτοῦ σῶμα .… ἀνεσταύρωσαν , and thus in Thucyd., Xen., Polyb., also in Plato, Plut., Diod. Sic., Ælian, Herodian, Galen, Lucian, Josephus. But it has been well answered by Bleek, and others, 1. that <strong> ἀνά</strong> in composition is not unfrequently found with the double meaning of <em> again</em> , or <em> back</em> , and also <em> up</em> : as e. g. in ἀναβλέπω , which signifies both <em> to look up</em> , and to <em> recover-sight</em> ; so of ἀναβαίνω , ἀνάγω , ἀναδύομαι , ἀναθέω , ἀνατρέχω , ἀνακαθίζω , ἀνακομίζω , ἀναπέμπω , ἀναπλέω , &amp;c.: 2. considering, α . that the classical writers never had any occasion for the idea of recrucifying, and, β . that our Writer could have used the word, however to be rendered, with no other idea here, it is very probable that the reiterative force of ἀνά is the right one to be adopted: 3. the consensus of the Greek interpreters is of great weight, in a question simply affecting the meaning of a Greek compound. Chrys., ἄνωθεν πάλιν σταυροῦντας : Thdrt., Œc., ἄνωθεν , φησί , σταυροῦντας : Phot., ἐπὶ δευτέραν σταύρωσιν κ . δεύτερον πάθος καλοῦντας αὐτόν : Thl. and Schol. Matth., ἄνωθεν σταυροῦντας · ἅπαξ γὰρ ἐσταυοώθη κ . τ . λ .: Syr., “denuo erucifigunt:” vulg., “ <em> rursum crucifigentes</em> :” D-lat., “ <em> recrucientes</em> :” Tert [32] , “ <em> refigentes cruci</em> .” Jerome’s testimony also is remarkable: “Pro <em> rursus crucifigentes</em> melius unum verbum compositum in Græco est ἀνασταυροῦντες , quod nos interpretari possumus <em> recrucifigentes</em> ”) <strong> to themselves</strong> ( <strong> ἑαυτοῖς</strong> is not, as some of the Fathers, e. g. Œc., Thl., ὅσον τὸ ἐφ ʼ ἑαυτοῖς , nor <em> by their means</em> , as Schulz: but is that kind of ‘dativus commodi’ which approaches very nearly to mere reference, though there never is, properly speaking, a dative of mere reference. So in ref. Gal., δι ʼ οὗ ἐμοὶ κόσμος ἐσταύρωται κἀγὼ κόσμῳ . Christ was their possession by faith: this their possession they took, and recrucified to themselves: deprived themselves of all benefit from Him, just as did the unbelieving Jews who nailed Him to the tree. Vatablus’s “ <em> in suorum perniciem</em> ,” approved by Lünemann, is too strong. The ‘dativus incommodi’ is only in fact a fine irony on the ‘dativus commodi,’ and its edge must not be turned by too rough use. Bengel’s characteristic antithesis, “ ἑαυτοῖς , <em> sibi</em> , facit antitheton ad παραδειγματίζοντας , ostentantes,” is in this case more fanciful than real) <strong> the Son of God</strong> (for solemnity, to shew the magnitude of the offence), <strong> and putting</strong> ( <strong> Him</strong> ) <strong> to open shame</strong> (so in ref. Matt.: in ref. Num., the word is used of the actual hanging up on a tree: “Take all the heads of the people, καὶ παραδειγμάτισον αὐτοὺς τῷ κυρίῳ κατέναντι τοῦ ἡλίου .” See other examples in Bleek. Here the word continues the action of the former participle: they crucify Him anew, and as at his former crucifixion, put Him to shame before all: as Bleek strikingly says, they tear Him out of the recesses of their hearts where He had fixed his abode, and exhibit Him to the open scoffs and reproach of the world, as something powerless and common: cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span> , τὸν υἱὸν θεοῦ καταπατήσας , καὶ τὸ αἷμα τῆς διαθήκης κοινὸν ἡγησάμενος ἐν ᾧ ἡγιάσθη , καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς χάριτος ἐνυβρίσας ). It would be quite beyond the limits of mere annotation, to give any satisfactory analysis of the history of interpretation of this passage, and of the conflicts which have sprung up around it. Such accounts will be found admirably given in several of the Commentators, among whom I would especially mention Bleek and Tholuck; and for the English reader, Owen, who treats it at great length and very perspicuously. I will only mention the most notable points, and set down a few landmarks of the exegesis. 1. The passage was used by the Montanists and the Novatians, in ancient times, to justify the irrevocable exclusion from the Church, of those who had lapsed. Tertullian, de Pudicitia, § 20, vol. ii. p. 1021, cites it as the testimony of Barnabas, and adds, “Hoc qui ab apostolis didicit et cum apostolis docuit, nunquam mœcho et fornicatori secundam pœnitentiam promissam ab apostolis norat.” See other testimonies in Bleek i. § 53, and h. 1. But, 2. in the Catholic Church this view was ever resisted, and the Fathers found in the passage simply a prohibition against the repetition of baptism. So Athanasius expressly, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:0">Ephesians 4:0</span> , ad Serap. § 13, vol. i. (ii. Migne) p. 563, οὐκ ἐκκλεῖόν ἐστι τῶν ἁμαρτανόντων τὴν μετάνοιαν , ἀλλὰ δεικνύον , ἓν εἶναι τὸ τῆς καθολικῆς ἐκκλησίας βάπτισμα καὶ μὴ δεύτερον . And so all the ancients who have noticed the passage, and some of the moderns: see above on φωτίζω . 3. In later times, the great combat over our passage has been between the Calvinistic and the Arminian expositors. To favour their peculiar views of indefectibility, the former have endeavoured to weaken the force of the participial clauses as implying any real participation in the spiritual life. So Calvin himself (“Hoc (the elect only being truly regenerate) obstare nego quominus reprobos etiam gustu gratiæ suræ adspergat, irradiet eorum mentes aliquibus lucis suæ scintillis, afficiat eos bonitatis suæ sensu, verbumque suum utrumque animis eorum insculpat”), Beza (“Aliud est vere credere … aliud vero gustum aliquem habere …”): so Owen (“The persons here intended are not true and sincere believers:.… for, 1) in their full and large description there is no mention of faith or believing,” &amp;c.), and recently Tait, Exposition of Epistle to the Hebrews. But all this is clearly wrong, and contrary to the plainest sense of the terms here used. The Writer even heaps clause upon clause, to shew that no such shallow tasting, no “primoribus tantum labris gustasse” is intended: and the whole contextual argument is against the view, for it is the very fact of these persons having veritably entered the spiritual life, which makes it impossible to renew them afresh if they fall away. If they have never entered it, if they are unregenerate, what possible logic is it, or even common sense at all, to say, that their shallow taste and partial apprehension makes it impossible to renew them: what again to say, that it is impossible πάλιν ἀνακαινίζειν persons in whose case no ἀνακαινισμός has ever taken place? If they have never believed, never been regenerated, how can it be more difficult to renew them to repentance, than the heathen, or any unconverted persons? One landmark of exegesis then must be, to hold fast the simple plain sense of the passage, and recognize the fact that the persons are truly the partakers of the spiritual life regenerate by the Holy Spirit. <em> Elect</em> of course they are not, or they could not fall away, by the very force of the term: but this is one among many passages where in the Scripture, as ever from the teaching of the Church, we learn that ‘ <em> elect</em> ’ and ‘ <em> regenerate</em> ’ are not convertible terms. All elect are regenerate: but all regenerate are not elect. The regenerate may fall away, the elect never Song of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="so+4:0">Song of Solomon 4:0</span> . Again, the word <strong> ἀδύνατον</strong> has been weakened down to “ <em> difficile</em> ” by the ancient Latin version in D, and thus explained by a-Lapide, Le Clerc, Limborch, Pyle, and many others. The readers of this commentary will not need reminding, that no such sense can be for a moment tolerated. And this is our second landmark of exegesis: <strong> ἀδύνατον</strong> <em> stands immoveable</em> . But let us see where, and how, it stands. It is the strongest possible case, which the Writer is putting. First there is <em> considerable advance in the spiritual life</em> , carefully and specifically indicated. Then there is <em> deliberate apostasy</em> : an enmity to Him whom they before loved, a going over to the ranks of His bitter enemies and revilers, and an exposing Him to shame in the sight of the world. Of such persons, such apostates from being such saints, the Writer simply says that it is impossible to bestow on them a fresh renewal to repentance. There remaineth <em> no more</em> sacrifice for sin than that one which they have gone through and rejected: they are in the state of crucifying the Son of God: the putting Him to shame is their enduring condition. How is it possible then to renew them to repentance? It is simply impossible, from the very nature of the case. The question is not, it seems to me, whether man’s ministry or God’s power is to be supplied as the agent, nor even whether the verb is active or passive: the impossibility lies merely within the limits of the hypothesis itself. Whether God, of His infinite mercy and almighty power, will ever, by judgments or the strong workings of His Spirit, reclaim the obdurate sinner, so that even <em> he</em> may look on Him whom he has pierced, is, thank Him, a question which neither this, nor any other passage of Scripture, precludes us from entertaining. There is no barring here of God’s grace, but just as I have observed above, an axiomatic preclusion by the very hypothesis itself, of a renewal to repentance of those who have passed through, and rejected for themselves, God’s appointed means of renewal. 5. Another dispute over our passage has been, whether the <em> sin against the Holy Ghost</em> is in any way brought in here. Certainly we may say that the fall here spoken of cannot be identical with that sin: for as Bleek has well remarked, that sin may be predicated of persons altogether outside the Christian Church, as were those with reference to whom our Lord uttered His awful saying on it. It is true, the language used in the parallel place, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span> , does approach that sin, where he says, τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς χάριτος ἐνυβρίσας : but it is also clear that the impossibility here spoken of cannot depend on the fact of such sin having been committed, by the very construction of the participles, ἀνασταυροῦντας and παραδειγματίζοντας , which themselves render the reason for that impossibility.
