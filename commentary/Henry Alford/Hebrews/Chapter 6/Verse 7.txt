<b>For land which hath drunk in the rain frequently coming on it</b> (so far, is the<i> subject</i> of both sides of the hypothesis: and not the word<i> “land”</i> only. The A.V., “But that which beareth thorns, &c.,” is mistranslated. Besides which, the A.V. has neglected the past participle here, in rendering,<i> “the earth which drinketh in.”</i> The drinking in the rain is an act prior to both the hypotheses.
