<b>but if it bear thorns and thistles is accounted worthless (</b><i> ‘reprobate,’</i> tried and found wanting. Being thus rejected, it gets no share of God’s blessing),<b> and nigh unto cursing</b> (there appears here to be an allusion to Gen. iii. 17, 18, “Cursed be the ground for thy sake: thorns and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee.” Chrysostom has noticed that in the expression<i> “nigh unto cursing,”</i> there is a softening of the severity of the declaration);<b> of which the end is unto burning.</b> There is considerable doubt both as to the connexion, and as to the interpretation of the sense when obtained. To what does<b> of what,</b> or<b> whose,</b> belong? to<i> “land,”</i> or to<i> “cursing”?</i> The latter is taken by some: the end, result, of which course is that it tends to burning. But it does not seem to me that this would have been thus expressed. I would therefore, with Chrysostom, and most Commentators, refer<i> “whose”</i> to<i> “land.”</i> But then, with what view will this ultimate burning take place? Some have said, with a salutary end, to purge out the evil. Strange to say, this meaning is adopted, not by Roman-Catholic Commentators, but by Protestants: most of them not seeing that the inevitable conclusion from such an acceptation would be, the existence of purgatorial fire. The reference clearly is, as the whole context, and the finality of the expression<i> “whose end is unto”</i> shew, not to purifying, but to consuming fire: as in ch. x. 26, 27, where the same ultimate fear is described as issuing in<i> fire which shall consume the adversaries.</i> So in Deut. xxix. 22, 23, the curse of the apostate land is described as consisting in “brimstone, and salt, and burning; that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah&c.” And this destruction by burning is quite according to New Test. analogy: e.g. John xv. 6; Matt. iii. 10, 12; vii. 19; xiii. 30. 40 ff.
