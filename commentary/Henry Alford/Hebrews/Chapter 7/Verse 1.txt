<b> CHAP. VII. 1–X. 18.]</b> THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD OF CHRIST AFTER THE ORDER OF MELCHISEDEC, SET FORTH IN ITS DISTINCTION FROM THE LEVITICAL PRIESTHOOD:—THE NEW COVENANT BROUGHT IN BY CHRIST, IN ITS DISTINCTION FROM THE OLD:—AND THE FULL PROPITIATION WROUGHT BY HIM IN DISTINCTION FROM THE PROPITATORY SACRIFICES FORMERLY OFFERED. And herein,<br><br> So far (see the summary above) is purely historical: now follow the inductions from the history; from the mystical office and name of the Person concerned);<b> first indeed being interpreted</b> (i. e.<i> “being by interpretation:"</i>his name bearing this meaning when translated into Greek)<b> King of righteousness</b> (or<b> righteous king,</b> as Josephus gives it. But the other form here is no doubt purposely chosen, inasmuch as Melchisedec is a prophetic symbol of Him who is not only righteous, but the fount and ground of all righteousness before God. Zech. ix. 9; Isa. ix. 7; Jer. xxiii. 5, 6; Dan. ix. 21; Mal iv. 2; 1 Cor. i. 30),<b> and next also</b> (<i> “being,”</i> not<i> “being interpreted,”</i> must be supplied. This is plain from<i> “King of Salem”</i> representing a matter of fact, and the interpretation<i> following</i>)<b> King of Salem, which is, King of peace</b> (it has been much disputed, whether<b> Salem</b> is regarded by the Writer as the name of a town<i> at all</i>, and is not rather a portion of the personal appellation of Melchisedec. This latter has been held by Bleek, mainly from the consideration that no distinction here is made between the two expressions, “King of righteousness,” and “King of peace.” But, as Bleek himself confesses, we may well imagine that the Writer may wish to point out as a remarkable fact, that the city over which Melchisedce reigned, as well as his own name, was of typical significance; and in that case does not the expression<b> and after that also</b> draw sufficient distinction between his personal appellation and that of his city? As regards the word itself,<i> peace</i> is here used in that pregnant and blessed sense in which Christ is said to be “Prince of peace,” Isa. ix. 6; see also Rom. v. 1; Eph. ii. 14, 15, 17; Col. i. 20. It is peace as the fruit of righteousness, compare Isa. xxxii, 17: notice the order here,<b> first... of righteousness,</b> and after that also of<b> peace.</b> “Righteousness and peace,” says Delitzsch, “form in Old Test. prophecy, the characteristic of the times of the Messiah”);<b> without father, with-out mother, without genealogy</b> (it is very difficult to assign the true meaning to these predicates. The latter of them seems indeed to represent a simple matter of fact: viz. that Melchisedec<i> has not in Genesis any genealogy recorded</i>, by which his descent is shewn [see below]. But as to the two former, it cannot well be denied that, while they also may bear a similar sense, viz., that no father and mother of his are recorded in the sacred narrative, it is very possible on the other hand to feel that the Writer would hardly have introduced them so solemnly, hardly have followed them up by such a clause as<i> “having neither beginning of days nor end of life,”</i> we he had coupled with them far higher ideas than the former supposition implies. I confess this feeling to be present in my own mind:—indeed I feel that such solemn words seem to me to decide against that other supposition. So far I think all is clear: but when we come to inquire<i> what</i> high and mysterious eminence is here allotted to Melchisedec, I own I have no data whereon to decide: nor, I think, is a decision required of us. The Writer assigns to him this mysterious and insulated position, simply as a type of Christ: and this type he is merely by virtue of negations, as far as these epithets are concerned: in what he was<i> not</i>, he surpasses earthly priests, and represents Christ: what he<i> was</i>, is not in the record. I would regard the epithets then as designedly used in this mysterious way, and meant to represent to us, that Melchisedec was a person suffering from common men. It remains to give a summary of the opinions respecting the The circumstance that Melchisedec is here stated to be<b> likened unto the Son of God,</b> has led many of the older expositors to regard these epithets as belonging to Melchisedec only in so far as he is a type of the Son of God, and as properly true of Him alone, not of Melchisedec, or only in an improper sense, and a subordinate manner. Accordingly, they understand<b> without father</b> of Christ in reference to his Humanity;<b> without mother,</b> in reference to his Divinity; and so also<b> without genealogy.</b> But, however the term<i> “without father”</i> might perhaps be conceded to be not unnaturally applied to Christ in virtue of his Humanity, the words<i> “without mother”</i> and<i> “without genealogy”</i> lie so far off any obvious application to his Divinity, that we may safely say this view could not well have been in the Writer's mind. See further reasons, on the words<i> “likened to the Son of God”</i> below, for applying these epithets to Melchisedec, and not to Christ. But<i> when they are so applied,</i> we are met by two widely divergent streams of opinion, partly hinted at in the explanation of the rendering given above. The one of these regards Melchisedec as a superhuman being: the other finds nothing in this description which need point him out as any thing beyond a man. Jerome had received from Evagrius au anonymous work, in which the “most famous question respecting the Priest Melchisedec” was treated, and the writer tried to prove him “to have been of divine nature, not to be thought of as a man: and to have at the end presumed. to say that the Holy Spirit met Abraham, and was the person who appeared to him as a man.” This strange opinion moved Jerome “to examine the books of the ancients to see what their opinions were.” And he found that Origen, in his first Homily on Genesis [now lost], maintained him to have been<i> an angel</i>, as did Didymus, the follower of Origen. Then he examined Hippolytus, Eusebius of Cæsarea, and Eusebius of Emesa, Apollinarius, Eustathius of Antioch, and found that all these held him to have been<i> a man</i> of Canaan, King of Jerusalem, and endeavoured to prove it in different ways. He then mentions the opinion of the Jews, that Melchisedec was<i> Shem</i>, the eldest son of Noah; and gives their calculation that this may well have been, for Shem survived Abraham forty years. On this he pronounces no opinion. The view, that Melchisedec was the Holy Ghost, was also entertained by Hieraeas the Egyptian, and by a branch of the Theodotian heretics, founded by the younger Theodotus, and called Melchisedecites: and Marcus Eremita [about 400], who wrote a treatise: on Melchisedec, mentions heretics who believed him to be “God the Word, before He took flesh, or was born of Mary.” This opinion Epiphanius mentions as held by some within the church: and Ambrose, from his remarks, vol. i.p. 288, seems to have held this: though, as above, he expressly states him to have been merely a holy man, a type of Christ. This last view was ever the prevalent one in the church Cyril of Alexandria combats the two opinions that Melchisedec was a vision of the Holy Spirit, and that he was a great angel.<br><br> In later times the idea that he was the Son of God has been revived. The theory that he was<i> Shem</i> has found many advocates: among others, Luther [on Gen. xv.] and Melanchthon. Jurieu believes him to have been<i> Ham;</i> Hulse and Calmet to have been<i> Enoch</i> reappearing on earth),<b> having neither beginning of days, nor end of life</b> (these words are again taken by most Commentators to mean, that of Melchisedec, neither beginning of days nor end of life are related in Scripture. Some take<b> beginning</b> for that of his sacredotal life: other take<b> end</b> also for that of his priestly life: “for that no one preceded him in the priesthood to which he succeeded, and no one is related to have succeeded him in his priesthood, in which thing he was a type of Christ.” Camero. But however the<b> end</b> of his life may be legitimately thus referred, seeing that his priesthood and his life would expire together, his<b> beginning of days</b> can hardly be understood of any thing but his<i> natural life</i>, especially as following his being without father or mother, and in the presence of the general biblical usage of the<b> days</b> of any one as a man’s lifetime. Accordingly most expositors take the words in this their natural sense and interpret them as above, Again however, no one, I think, can help feeling that such an interpretation is in fact no worthy acceptation of these solemn words of the sacred Writer. The expressions become incomparably more natural, as Bleek says, if the Writer really mean that Melchisedec had not, as mortal men, a definite beginning and end of his life. It really would seem to me almost childish, to say thus solemnly of any whose acts were related in the Old Test., but whose birth and death were not related, that<i> they had neither beginning of days nor end of life</i>. Suppose e.g. such a thing were said of Hobab, father-in-law of Moses. Here again Delitzsch, who takes strongly the other view, quotes from Philo an expression respecting Cain which he supposes analogous: Cain, the symbol of evil, shall not die, because evil must always live among the mortal race of men.” But surely it is hardly legitimate to conclude that, because Philo means only thus much, the Writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews means no more);<b> but</b> (yea, rather)<b> likened to the Son of God</b> (this clause stands alone and pendent, like the preceding, and must not be taken with<i> “abideth a priest for ever.”</i> To this there are three objections: 1) it would be extremely unnatural to say that from a text where it is said that the Son of God is a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec, Melchisedec himself derives the character of remaining priest for ever: 2) it would be but a poor way of proving the eternal priesthood of Christ, to shew that He is a priest after the order of one who only appeared to have, but really had not, such eternal priesthood: and 3) it is clearly not in respect of<i> priesthood</i> that the<i> being made like</i> is here meant, but in respect of the foregoing predicates: for it is as to these only that the Son of God would be an archetype for Melchisedec, seeing that, in respect of priesthood, Melchisedec, was chronologically prior to our Lord, The sense is then that Melchisedec, in being<i> “without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life,”</i> personally, not typically, resembles the Son of God—in his personal attributes, as the Son of God subsequently in His incarnation, resembled<i> him</i> in His priesthood);<b> remaineth priest for ever</b> (the expression is one which must be interpreted in each case by the context in which it occurs. There is no reason why here, where an eternal priesthood is in question, it should mean<i> for life:</i> indeed such meaning would be absurd, seeing that all were priests for life. All kinds of ways have been devised to escape the plain assertion of these words. Most Commentators have had recourse to the same as before, viz, that<i> no end of his priesthood is related to us in Scripture:</i> so Œcumenius, Theophylact, Cyril of Alexandria, Epiphanius, and many moderns. Schlichting takes it, that as our Lord’s High Priesthood, which: is said to be eternal, will endure to that time when the high-priestly office will cease, so Melchisedec’s priesthood is said to endure for ever, “because it endured as long as the nature of the case would admit. So” he adds, “David said he would praise the Lord for ever,”&c. Stier says, “He stands in Scripture as a type of an eternal priest.” but the question here is not of<i> type</i>, but of<i> fact</i>. Tholuck, “He remains, in so far as the type remains in the antitype, in so far as his priesthood remains in Christ.” But thus type and antitype are hopelessly confounded. Christ is to be proved to be a High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. Can we conceive then that the Writer, in setting forth what the order and attributes of Melchisedec are, should go back to Christ to find them? Again, to shew to what shifts interpreters have been reduced here, others actually understand<i> “who”</i> before<i> “abideth,”</i> and construe,<i> “made like to the Son of God, who, abideth, &c.”</i><br><br> Every thing shews that which has been maintained all through this difficult passage, that the assertions are made, and this chief one is above all made, simply of Melchisedec, and they are, as matters of fact, inferred and laid down by the sacred Writer from the historic notices of him. What further inference lies from such dignity being here put on Melchisedec, is not, as I before said, for us to enquire: certainly, none which can in any way interfere with Christ’s eternal and sole priesthood, can be correct. It is one of those things in which we must not be wise above that which is written, but must. take simply and trustingly the plain sense of our Bibles on a deep and mysterious subject, and leave it for the day when all shall be clear, to give us full revelation on the matter).
