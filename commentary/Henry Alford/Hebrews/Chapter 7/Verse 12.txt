<b> 12.] For if the priesthood is changed</b> (better thus than A.V.,<i> “the priesthood being changed”</i>),<b> there takes place of necessity a change of the law also</b> (viz. of that law, which as above, is legislated upon the ground of that priesthood: not of the<i> law of the priesthood</i> only, nor of the<i> ceremonial law</i> only. The connexion is with the parenthesis in ver. 11, which was inserted to prepare the way for our verse. The Writer as yet expresses himself mildly and cautiously: the<b> change</b> here in fact amounts to the<i> disannulling</i> in ver. 18, but is not yet so expressed).
