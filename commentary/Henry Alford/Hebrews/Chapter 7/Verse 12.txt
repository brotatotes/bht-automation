 12 .]  For if the priesthood is changed (better thus than E. V., “  the priesthood being changed ,” which gives the reader the idea of μετατιθείσης ),  there takes place of necessity a change of the law (not ‘  of law ,’ which would be decidedly wrong, and would require  τοῦ νόμου , as in a general sentence, implying ‘the law’ of the particular case in view;  νόμου , anarthrous, means that law, which had already begun to be used as a proper name, the well-known law of Moses)  also (viz. of that law, which, as above, is legislated upon the ground of that priesthood: not, as Beza, Grot., al., of the  law of the priesthood only, nor as Calvin, a-Lapide, Jac. Cappell., Böhme, Kuinoel, al., of the  ceremonial law only. Chrys. says rightly: εἰ δὲ ἕτερον δεῖ ἱερέα εἶναι , μᾶλλον δὲ ἑτέραν ἱερωσύνην , ἀνάγκη καὶ νόμον ἕτερον εἶναι · τοῦτο δὲ πρὸς τοὺς λέγοντας · τί ἔδει καινῆς διαθήκης ; The connexion is with the parenthesis in Hebrews 7:11 , which was inserted to prepare the way for our verse. Bleek, De Wette, al. deny the reference to the parenthetical clause in Hebrews 7:11 , and regard our verse as preparing the way for what follows: “It lays down the ground, why not without urgent cause a change of the priesthood took place” (De W.), that cause being that the law itself was to be abrogated. The Writer as yet expresses himself mildly and cautiously: the  μετάθεσις here in fact amounts to the ἀθέτησις in Hebrews 7:18 , but is not yet so expressed).
