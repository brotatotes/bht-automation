 15 .]  And it (viz. the change of the law; the proposition of Hebrews 7:12 .: so Œc., οὐ μόνον ἔνθεν δῆλόν ἐστιν , ὅτι ἐνηλλάγη ἥ τε λατρεία καὶ ἡ διαθήκη … ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου περισσῶς δῆλόν ἐστιν … καὶ ἐκ τούτου κατάδηλός ἐστιν ἥ τε ἐναλλαγὴ καὶ ἡ μετάθεσις τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης . Chrys. takes ‘  it ’ to mean the distinction between the Levitical and the N. T. High Priesthood: τί ἐστι κατάδηλον ; τὸ μέσον τῆς ἱερωσύνης . Jac. Cappellus, and Bengel “illud quod in Heb 7:11 asseritur, nullam consummationem factam esse per sacerdotium Leviticum,” and so Delitzsch. Primasius, Hammond, al., that the  priesthood is altered: Ebrard strangely supplies, “that our Lord sprung from Judah:” indeed his whole comment on this verse is one of those curiosities of exegesis which unhappily abound in his otherwise valuable commentary. But the alteration of the  law is the proposition here: and so Estius, Schlichting, Seb. Schmidt, Kuinoel, Tholuck, Bleek, Lünem., al.)  is yet more abundantly (see for περισσότερον , on ch. Heb 2:1 )  manifest (  κατάδηλος is another stronger form of δῆλος , common in the classics (reff.), but found only here in LXX and N. T.),  if (i. e.  siquidem , seeing that: τὸ  εἰ ἀντὶ τοῦ  ὅτι νοήσεις , ἤγουν  ἐπειδή , Œc.: “  si … rem dubitative loquitur, sed affirmative, quasi diceret … quia” &c., Primasius, in Bleek. See reff. ὅτι could not well have been used here, as the reader would have connected it with κατάδηλον , ‘it is evident, that’ &c.)  according to the similitude of (= κατὰ τὴν τάξιν before)  Melchisedek ariseth a different priest (it is best to take  ἱερεὺς ἕτερος as the subject, ἕτερος being a mere epithet: not, as Schulz (also in Heb 7:11 ), ἱερεύς predicatively, “  another ariseth as priest ,” nor as some (?) mentioned by Lünem., to take ἱερεύς and ἕτερος both predicatively, “  He ariseth as another priest ,” viz. our Lord).
