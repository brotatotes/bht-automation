<b> 17.]</b><i> Proof of the last clause from Scripture.</i> The stress of the citation is on<b> for ever. For he</b> (the different priest)<b> is borne witness of, that thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</b><br><br><b> For moreover there takes place an abrogation of the preceding commandment</b> (the commandment intended is that mentioned in ver. 16, according to which the priesthood was constituted, not, as Chrysostom and others think, the whole Mosaic law, however much that may be involved in the assertion: compare the parenthesis in ver. 11. This commandment went before—not merely in time, but was an introduction to and gave way before the greater and final ordinance)<b> on account of its weakness and unprofitableness</b> (Rom. viii. 3, as Gal. iv. 9, is remarkably parallel, both in thought and mode of expression: one of those coincidences which could hardly take place where there was not community of thought and diction),—<b>for the law perfected nothing</b> (this parenthetical clause inserted to explain the implication contained in the words<i> “the weakness and</i><i> unprofitableness thereof.”</i> The law had not the power to bring any thing whatever to perfection, to its appointed end and excellence:—perfection, in any kind, was not by the law),—<b>and an introduction</b> (<i>a bringing in besides:</i> the law being already there, this is brought in to and upon it)<b> of a better hope</b> (the contrast is between the preceding commandment, weak and unprofitable, and a better thing, viz. the<i> hope</i> which brings us near to God),<b> by means of which we draw near to God</b> (this note, of personal access to God, has been twice struck before, ch. iv. 16; vi. 19, and is further on in the Epistle expanded into a whole strain of argument. See ch. ix. 11 ff.; x. 19 ff. It is that access, which was only carnally and symbolically open to them by shedding of the blood of sacrifices, but has been spiritually and really opened to us by the shedding of Christ’s blood once for ail, so that we being justified by faith can approach the very throne of God. The verb here used is the technical term in the Septuagint for the<i> drawing near</i> of the priests in their sacrificial ministrations. It remains to treat of the connexion of the above sentence, vv. 18, 19, which has been entirely mistaken by many, and among them by the A.V. The ending clause,<i> “but the bringing in of a better hope,”</i> has been wrongly joined with<i> “for the law made nothing perfect:”</i> and that, either 1) as A.V.,<i> “but the bringing in of a better hope did.”</i> Beza appears here, as in so many other cases, to have led our translators into error: or 2)<i> “For the law perfected nothing, but was the introduction,”</i>&c. This latter is successfully impugned by Beza, on the ground that the law was not an<i> introduction</i> at all, from the very meaning [see above] of that word. See the rest of the matter argued in my Greek Test.).<br><br><b> And inasmuch as</b> [it was]<b> not without an oath</b> (the ellipsis here is variously supplied. Some fill it up out of what follows,<i> “that He became surety.”</i> And this seems on the whole more natural, and more agreeable to the style of our Epistle, than to put in, as A.V.,<i> “he was made priest,”</i> or as Bleek, and others,<i> “this</i> [the bringing in of a better hope]<i> took plac</i> e):<b> for they</b> [<b>as we know</b>]<b> without swearing of an oath are made priests</b> (<i>are made</i>, as strongly marking the existence of these priests at the time of writing);<b> but He with swearing of an oath by Him who saith</b> (i. e., certainly not the Psalmist, who cannot be said to have spoken this<i> unto Him</i>, unless indeed we take<i> “unto”</i> in the mere secondary sense of “with reference to.” In the following citation it is the words of address only to which this refers: the former part is the mere introduction to them. Not seeing this has led to the above mistake. It was God who addressed Him, God who made Him priest, God who sware unto Him)<b> to Him, The Lord</b> (Jehovah)<b> sware and will not repent</b> (i. e. the decree stands fast, and shall undergo no change),<b> Thou art a priest for ever:—of so much</b> (in that same proportion, viz. as the difference between the oath and no oath indicates)<b> better a testament</b> (the meanings of the word thus rendered [<i>diatheké</i>], 1) an appointment, without concurrence of a second party, of somewhat concerning that second party,—of which nature is<i> a last will and testament,</i> 2) a mutual agreement in which all parties concerned consent,—<i>a covenant,</i> in the proper sense,—being confessed, our business here is, not to enquire what is the fixed theological acceptance of the word, and so to render it here, irrespective of any subsequent usage by our Writer himself; but to enquire 1) how he uses it in this Epistle, 2) whether he is likely to have used it in more than one sense:—and to render accordingly. Now it cannot well be doubted, that in ch. ix. 16, 17, he does use it in the sense of<i> “testament.”</i> And just as little can it be questioned, that he is speaking there of the same thing as here; that the<i> “new testament”</i> there answers to the<b> better testament</b> here, this first mention of it being in fact preparatory to that fuller treatment. I therefore keep here to the A.V.)<b> also hath Jesus become surety</b> ( “Jesus is become the surety of the better covenant, i.e. in His person security and certainty is given to men, that a better covenant is made and sanctioned by God. For Christ, the Son of God, became man, to publish this covenant on earth,—has sealed it with His sufferings and death, and by His resurrection from the dead was declared with power to be sent by God as the Founder of such a Covenant.” Lümemann. This seems better, considering the context, in which our hope mainly, and not at present Christ’s satisfaction, is in question, than to bring in as some do, that satisfaction, or to regard His suretyship meaning His mediatorship [see ch. viii. 6, where He is described as<i> mediator of a better testament or covenant</i>] seen from both sides—that He is God’s surety for man and man’s surety for God).
