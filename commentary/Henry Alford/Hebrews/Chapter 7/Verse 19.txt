<b>for the law perfected nothing</b> (this parenthetical clause inserted to explain the implication contained in the words<i> “the weakness and</i><i> unprofitableness thereof.”</i> The law had not the power to bring any thing whatever to perfection, to its appointed end and excellence:—perfection, in any kind, was not by the law),—<b>and an introduction</b> (<i>a bringing in besides:</i> the law being already there, this is brought in to and upon it)<b> of a better hope</b> (the contrast is between the preceding commandment, weak and unprofitable, and a better thing, viz. the<i> hope</i> which brings us near to God),<b> by means of which we draw near to God</b> (this note, of personal access to God, has been twice struck before, ch. iv. 16; vi. 19, and is further on in the Epistle expanded into a whole strain of argument. See ch. ix. 11 ff.; x. 19 ff. It is that access, which was only carnally and symbolically open to them by shedding of the blood of sacrifices, but has been spiritually and really opened to us by the shedding of Christ’s blood once for ail, so that we being justified by faith can approach the very throne of God. The verb here used is the technical term in the Septuagint for the<i> drawing near</i> of the priests in their sacrificial ministrations. It remains to treat of the connexion of the above sentence, vv. 18, 19, which has been entirely mistaken by many, and among them by the A.V. The ending clause,<i> “but the bringing in of a better hope,”</i> has been wrongly joined with<i> “for the law made nothing perfect:”</i> and that, either 1) as A.V.,<i> “but the bringing in of a better hope did.”</i> Beza appears here, as in so many other cases, to have led our translators into error: or 2)<i> “For the law perfected nothing, but was the introduction,”</i>&c. This latter is successfully impugned by Beza, on the ground that the law was not an<i> introduction</i> at all, from the very meaning [see above] of that word. See the rest of the matter argued in my Greek Test.).
