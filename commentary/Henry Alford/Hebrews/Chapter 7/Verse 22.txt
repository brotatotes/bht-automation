of so much</b> (in that same proportion, viz. as the difference between the oath and no oath indicates)<b> better a testament</b> (the meanings of the word thus rendered [<i>diatheké</i>], 1) an appointment, without concurrence of a second party, of somewhat concerning that second party,—of which nature is<i> a last will and testament,</i> 2) a mutual agreement in which all parties concerned consent,—<i>a covenant,</i> in the proper sense,—being confessed, our business here is, not to enquire what is the fixed theological acceptance of the word, and so to render it here, irrespective of any subsequent usage by our Writer himself; but to enquire 1) how he uses it in this Epistle, 2) whether he is likely to have used it in more than one sense:—and to render accordingly. Now it cannot well be doubted, that in ch. ix. 16, 17, he does use it in the sense of<i> “testament.”</i> And just as little can it be questioned, that he is speaking there of the same thing as here; that the<i> “new testament”</i> there answers to the<b> better testament</b> here, this first mention of it being in fact preparatory to that fuller treatment. I therefore keep here to the A.V.)<b> also hath Jesus become surety</b> ( “Jesus is become the surety of the better covenant, i.e. in His person security and certainty is given to men, that a better covenant is made and sanctioned by God. For Christ, the Son of God, became man, to publish this covenant on earth,—has sealed it with His sufferings and death, and by His resurrection from the dead was declared with power to be sent by God as the Founder of such a Covenant.” Lümemann. This seems better, considering the context, in which our hope mainly, and not at present Christ’s satisfaction, is in question, than to bring in as some do, that satisfaction, or to regard His suretyship meaning His mediatorship [see ch. viii. 6, where He is described as<i> mediator of a better testament or covenant</i>] seen from both sides—that He is God’s surety for man and man’s surety for God).
