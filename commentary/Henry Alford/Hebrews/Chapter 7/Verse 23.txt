<b> 23.] And they indeed</b> (i. e. the Levitical priests)<b> are appointed priests in numbers</b> (the chief emphasis is on this latter point, as contrasted with<i> unchangeable</i> below),<b> on account of their being by death hindered from continuing</b> (in<i> life?</i> or, in their<i> priesthood?</i> The latter is taken by many, and is the more probable. The context clearly here treats of abiding in the priesthood: besides which, it would be somewhat tautological to say that they were hindered by death from continuing in life):<b> but He, on account of his remaining for ever</b> (here again our former argument conversely applies, and obliges us to understand this<i> remaining</i> of endurance now in<i> life</i>, not in priesthood. It would be tautology to say, as some explain it, “because He remains a priest for ever, He has an unchangeable priesthood:” besides that thus the members of the parallelism would not correspond. They, on account of their deaths, are subject to continual renewal: He, because he lives for ever, has his priesthood unchangeable, See John viii. 35; xii. 34; xxi. 22 f.: 1 Cor. xv. 6: Phil. i. 25),<b> hath his priesthood unchangeable.</b>
