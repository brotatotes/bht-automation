<p><strong> 24</strong> .] <strong> but He, on account of his remaining for ever</strong> (here again, our former argument conversely applies, and obliges us to understand this μένειν of endurance now in <em> life</em> , not in priesthood. It would be tautology to say, as Estius, Seb. Schmidt, al., “because He remains a priest for ever, He has an unchangeable priesthood:” besides that thus the members of the parallelism would not correspond. They, on account of their deaths, are subject to continual renewal: He, because He lives for ever, has, &amp;c. See, besides reff., Joh 21:22 f.: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span> ; Php 1:25 ), <strong> hath his priesthood unchangeable</strong> (such is the construction: as in such sentences as εἶπε μεγάγῃ τῇ φωνῇ , and χαλεπὴν ἔχει τὴν ἀποκάθαρσιν , Plut. de Discr. Am. et Adult., § 35, in Bl. The art. in such case is quasi-personal, and the adjective a pure predicate, not an epithet. <strong> ἀπαράβατος</strong> is a word of later Greek: sec Lob. on Phryn. p. 313 ( ἀπαράβατον παραιτοῦ λέγειν , ἀλλ ʼ ἀπαραίτητον : on which Lob. says, “Ratio convenit: nam παράβατον vetus est sed poeticum: ἀπαράβατον neque vetus, neque oratoricum”). Many expositors, Thdrt., Œc., Thl., al., take it actively, διάδοχον οὐκ ἔχουσαν , μὴ παραβαίνουσαν εἰς ἄλλον . But it seems doubtful whether the word ever has this meaning. Palm and Rost give it, but cite only this place as justifying it. On the other hand, the examples in Bleek and Wetst. all tend to substantiate the passive meaning, <em> unalterable</em> ; which may not be passed by or put aside. So Galen i. in Hippocr. says, πρὸς γὰρ τὸ κατεπεῖγον ἀεὶ χρὴ τὸν ἰατρὸν ἵστασθαι , καὶ μὴ καθάπερ νόμον ἀπαράβατον φυλάσσειν τὰ κελευθέντα πράττεσθαι . The same expression, νόμος ἀπαράβατος , is found in Epictet. 75. The sun, in Plut. de Oracul. Defect. p. 410, has a τάξις ἀπαράβατος : and Hierceles, Aur. Carm. p. 26, has, τὸ ἀπαράβατον τῆς ἐν τοῖς δημιουργηθεῖσιν εὐταξίας , and p. 72, ἡ τῶν καθηκόντων τήρησις ἀπαράβατος . So vulg. and D-lat., “ <em> sempiternum</em> :” Ambr [37] de Fuga Sæculi c. 3 (16), vol. i. p. 424, “ <em> imprævaricabile</em> :” Aug [38] de Pecc. Mer. i. 27 (50), vol. x. pt. i., “ <em> intransgressibile</em> ”).
