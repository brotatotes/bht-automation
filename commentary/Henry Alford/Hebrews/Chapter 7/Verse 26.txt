<b> 26.] For such</b> (i. e. such as is above described: retrospective, not prospective, as some have taken it. Then the following adjectives serve as appositional predicates, carrying forward the word<b> such</b>, and enlarging on the attributes of our High Priest, which were already slightly touched ch. iv. 14, 15)<b> an High Priest was for us</b> (emphasis on<i> us</i>)<b> becoming also</b> ( “nay, not only for all the above-mentioned reasons, but even for this”),—<b>holy</b> (the word here thus rendered is not the ordinary one,<i> “hagios,”</i> but<i> “hosios,”</i> that used in Ps. xvi. 10, and cited in Acts ii. 27, as the especial title of the incarnate Son of God, perfect in piety and reverent holiness toward his heavenly Father),<b> harmless</b> (simple and free from vice or evil suspicion),<b> undefiled</b> (not only from legal, but from moral pollution, in deed, word, and though),<b> separated from sinners</b> (from<i> the whole race and category</i> of sinners. This lets us into the true meaning, which is, not that Christ, ever and throughout, was free from sip, however true that may be, but [see next clause] that in his service as our High Priest, He, as the Levitical high priests in their service [Levit. xxi. 10 ff.], is void of all contact and commerce with sinners, removed far away in his glorified state and body, into God's holy place. This expression exactly answers to that in ch. ix. 28, where it is said that he shall come a second time<i> without, apart from, sin:</i> see there),<b> and made</b> (<i>advanced to be</i>)<b> higher than the heavens; who hath not necessity</b> (the present tense shews, that the Writer is not setting forth the ideal of a high priest, but speaking of the actual existing attributes of our great High Priest, as He is)<b> day by day</b> (the allusion is to the<i> daily offering</i> the priests, Ex. xxix. 38–42; Num. xxviii. 3–8, which are spoken of as offered by the high priests, though they took part in them only on festival days, because the high priests in fact lead and represent the whole priesthood),<b> as the high priests, to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, then for those of the people</b> (so Philo, speaking also of the daily sacrifices. Still it must be confessed that the application of such an idea to them has no authority in the law: and it would seem probable, as Bleek suggests, that the ceremonies of the great day of atonement were throughout before the mind of the Writer, as the chief and archetypal features of the High Priest’s work, but repeated in some sort in the daily sacrifices. The most probable solution of the difficulty however is that proposed by Hofmann and approved by Delitzsch: that<i> “day by day,”</i> from its situation, belongs not to the high priests, but only to Christ:<i> “who has not need day by day, as the high priests had year by year,”</i>&c.):<b> for this he did</b> (what? of necessity, by the shewing of ver. 26 and of ch. iv. 15, the offering for the sins of the people only. To include in this the whole, “first for his own, then for those of the people,” would be either to contradict these testimonies of the Writer himself, or to give some second and unnatural sense to<i> sins,</i> as the Socinian interpreters do, who regard it as importing only<i> weaknesses</i> when applied to Christ. Besides, as Delitzsch well observes, the idea of “offering himself for his own sins” would be against all sacrificial analogy, according to which the<i> sinless</i> is an offering for the sinful)<b> once for all, when He offered</b> (see above)<b> Himself</b> (this is the first place in the Epistle where mention is made of Christ’s having offered Himself. Henceforward it becomes more and more familiar to the reader: “once struck, the note sounds on ever louder and louder,” Delitzsch).<b> 28.]</b><i> Final bringing out of the contrast between the Aaronic priests and Christ.</i><b> For</b> (gives the reason for the difference in the last verse)<b> the law makes men</b> (emphatic, opposed to<b> the Son</b> below)<b> high priests, who have infirmity</b> (compare ch. v. 2, of the human high priest, and see below. The expression here involves, from the context, liability to sin, and subjection to, removal by, death. Christ had not the first, and therefore need not offer for his own sin: he was freed from the second, and therefore need not repeat His sacrifice);<b> but the word</b> (utterance; or, purport)<b> of the oath which was after the law</b> (these words, “the oath which was after the law,” belong together, which ought to be marked in the A.V. by the omission of the comma after “oath.” This oath is recorded in David, i.e. subsequently to the giving of the law, and therefore as antiquating it and setting it aside. The argument is similar to that in Gal. iii. 17), (<b>makes</b>)<b> the Son, made perfect</b> (in this participle, as Delitzsch remarks, lies enwrapped the whole process of the Son’s assumption of human<i> infirmity</i>, and being exalted through it: for this<i> being made perfect</i> was<i> through sufferings</i>, ch. ii. 10, v. 9. Those priests, by their infirmity, were removed away in death, and replaced by others: He, by that infirmity, which He took on Him, went out through death into glory eternal, and an unrenewable priesthood)<b> for evermore</b> (these words belong simply and entirely to the participle,<i> “made perfect.”</i> The A.V. has obliterated both sense, and analogy with ch. ii. 10 and v. 9, by rendering this participle,<i> ‘consecrated’</i>).
