<b> 5.]</b><i> Continuation of ver. 4, setting forth the reason of this greatness,</i><b> And indeed</b> (the A.V.<i> “and verily,”</i> is rather too strong)<b> they of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood</b> (or, and perhaps more properly,<i> “they of the sons of Levi, when they receive the priesthood:”</i> in either case meaning the family of Aaron, not the whole tribe of Levi, which indeed was appointed by God to receive tithes, see Numb. xviii. 20: the words<b> they of the sons of Levi</b> will not admit of this interpretation. The Writer speaks of the custom, whereby not all the Levites, but the priests only, received tithes),<b> have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law</b> (the commandment referred to, on the ordinary construction of the first words of the verse, would be Numb. xviii, 20–32. But it seems more natural to understand those first words as I have given them in the alternative there, and then<b> according to the law falls</b> into its place easily “Those of the sons of Levi, when they are invested with the priesthood, receive commandment to tithe the people according to the law”),<b> that is, of their brethren, though</b> [<b>they be</b>]<b> come out of the loins of Abraham</b> (the meaning is very difficult to assign. I take this to be intended: by the first clause,<b> that is, of their brethren,</b> that the Levitical tithe right was all within the limits of one race, a privilege enjoyed by sons of Abraham over sons of Abraham, and therefore less to be wondered at, and involving less difference between man and man, than the tithe right of Melchisedec over Abraham, one of different race, and indeed over all his progeny with him. Then the second clause,<b> though they be come out of the loins of Abraham,</b> is inserted to shew the deep subjection of the ordinary Abrahamic to the Melchisedec priesthood, seeing that, notwithstanding his privilege of descent, he was subjected to his own priest, his brother, who in turn paid tithes in Abraham to Melchisedec).
