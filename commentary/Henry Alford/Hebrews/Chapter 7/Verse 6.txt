 6 .]  But (apodosis to μέν , Heb 7:5 ),  he whose pedigree is never (see below)  reckoned from them (contrast οἱ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Λευεί , ὁ μὴ γενεαλογούμενος ἐξ αὐτῶν : also speaking for the connexion above advocated in Hebrews 7:5 . The present part. gives the sense, ‘  who is not in the habit of having his genealogy made out ’ …, whose descent no one thinks of deducing. This is also indicated by the subjective  μή . Had it been οὐ (as οἱ οὐκ ἠλεημένοι , 1Pe 2:10 ) it would denote the mere matter of fact, ‘of whom no such genealogy exists.’ This is better than with Winer, edn. 6, § 55. 5, to regard the μή as only a stronger form of negation. The verb is good Greek: the Egyptian priests in Herodotus, Ἑκαταίῳ γενεηλογήσαντι ἑωϋτὸν .… ἀντεγενεηλόγησαν κ . τ . λ ., ii. 143, see also ib. 146; and in Xen.

The sentence is cast into this form, because of the  enduring nature of the office and priesthood of Melchisedek, which is given by the perfect tense. Doubtless the perfect might be used without any such reference, meaning, ‘as the fact now stands:’ indicating, as Winer, § 40. 4, that the fact endures in its significance: see below, Hebrews 7:9 ; but considering the connexion here, I prefer supposing it to have been intended)  and hath blessed the possessor of the promises (Klee would urge the present sense of the participle; “  him who now possesses the promises ;” but there seems to be no necessity for this. I should rather take  ὁ ἔχων τὰς ἐπαγ  . for a quasi-official designation of Abraham (see on ch. Heb 6:12 ) as the  possessor of the promises. As to the sense, Œc. has well expressed it: ἐξῆρε τὸν Ἀβραάμ , ἵνα πλεῖον ἐξάρῃ τὸν Μελχισεδέκ ):
