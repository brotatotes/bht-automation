<b> 6.] But</b> (answers to<i> “indeed,”</i> ver. 5)<b> he whose pedigree is never</b> (see below)<b> reckoned from them</b> (the sons of Levi, not, from<i> the sons of Israel</i>, nor, from<i> Levi and Abraham:</i> and it means “from them,” i.e. their line of descent)<b> hath taken tithes of Abraham</b> (not,<i> received</i>, as A.V. The sentence is cast into this form, because of the<i> enduring nature</i> of the office and priesthood of Melchisedec, which is given by the perfect tense),<b> and hath blessed the possessor of the promises</b> (some would urge the present sense,—<i> “him who mow possesses the promises;”</i> but there seems to be no necessity for this. I should rather take the words for a quasi-official designation of Abraham [see on ch. vi. 12], as the<i> possessor of</i> the promises).<b> And without all controversy the less is blessed by the better</b> (it is obvious that the axiom here laid down only holds good where the blessing is a solemn and official one, as of a father, or a priest: as was the case here. In such cases the blesser stands in the place of God, and as so standing is of superior dignity).
