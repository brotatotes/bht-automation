<b> 8.]</b><i> Second item of superiority,</i> in that Melchisedec’s is an<i> enduring</i>, the Levitical a<i> transitory</i> priesthood.<b> And here indeed</b> (the Levitical priesthood being still in existence in the Writer’s time)<b> men who die</b> (there is a secondary emphasis on<b> men</b>:<i> men</i>, who die)<b> receive tithes</b> (different sorts of tenths taken of different things);<b> but there</b> (i. e. in this matter concerning Melchisedec)<b> one, of whom it is testified</b> (<b>one</b>, no longer<i> “a man of whom.”</i> This is not again expressed, nor is it to be supplied. The mysterious character of Melchisedec is still before the Writer. The testimony meant is certainly that of<i> Scripture;</i> probably, that in Ps. cx. 4, where an eternal priesthood, and therefore duration, is predicated of Melchisedec. It cannot well be, as Calvin and others hold, the mere negative fact of his death not being recorded, which would not amount to a testimony that he lives: and it is improbable that in so express a statement as this the Writer should, as some imagine, intend to combine both the positive testimony and the inference from the omission)<b> that he liveth</b> (this clearly cannot be interpreted of the<i> priesthood</i> of Melchisedec enduring: for what is here said is eminently personal, and that Melchisedec himself is meant, is shewn by the historical reference to the fact of his receiving tithes of Abraham. As Bleek well remarks, if the<i> dying</i> applies personally to the sons of Levi, the<i> living</i> must also apply personally to Melchisedec).
