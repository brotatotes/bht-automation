<b> 1.] Now the principal matter</b> (the word here used also signifies<i> sum total</i>, and this other meaning would be apposite enough here, were the sense confined to ver. 1, which has been treated of before: but ver. 2 contains new particulars, which cannot be said to be the<i> sum</i> of any things hitherto said)<b> in</b> (<b>in</b>, or<b> upon</b>: lying as it were, by, and among)<b> the things which we are saying: We have such an High Priest</b> (emphasis on<i> such</i>, which refers, not to what preceded, but to what is to follow, viz.<i> “who sat down,”</i>&c.),<b> who sat down</b> ( “in ch. i. 3, the sitting at the right hand of God was mentioned as a pre-eminence of the Son above the angels, who stand as ministering spirits before the presence of God: here, where the same is said of Christ as High Priest, Schlichting and others rightly remark that there is again a pre-eminence over the Jewish high priests: for these, even when they entered the holiest place, did not sit down by the throne of God, but only stood before it for a moment: compare ch. x. 11, 12.” Bleek. Lünemann calls this fanciful: but such distinctions are not surely to be overlooked altogether)<b> on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens</b> (better thus, than “of<i> the</i> majesty in the heavens”);<b> 2.] a minister of the holy place, and of the</b><b> true</b> (archetypal,<i> only true</i>, as so often in St, John, and in one passage of St. Luke, xvi. 11)<b> tabernacle, which the Lord</b> (here evidently the Father: see note on ch. xii. 14)<b> pitched, not</b> [any]<b> man</b> (it is an important question, symbolically considered, whether any and what distinction is intended by the Writer, between<b> the holy place</b> and<b> the tabernacle</b>. Delitzsch has gone into it at length, and Hofmann has treated of it in two places. Both are agreed that<b> the holy place</b> betokens the immediate immaterial presence of God, the veritable Holy of Holies, beyond, and ap-approached through, the heavens, ch. iv. 14. But as regards<b> the tabernacle</b> they differ. Hofmann maintains it to be the glorified body of Christ, and argues that it alone will satisfy such expressions as that in ch. ix. 11, “<i>not of this creation:</i>” in order to satisfying which, this<i> tabernacle</i> must belong to the new creation, the<i> regeneration</i>, which commences with the glorification of Christ. This glorified body of His is the new and abiding temple of God, in which He dwells and meets with us who are united to and have put on that glorified body, our house, eternal in the heavens: for so Hofmann interprets 2 Cor. v. 1 ff. On the other hand, Delitzsch controverts this view, as inconsistent with the symbolism in ch. ix. 11, 12, where Christ, “through the greater and more perfect tabernacle.... entered into the holy place,” taking this connexion of the words: and also with our ver. 5, where the Mosaic tabernacle is set forth as the representation and shadow of the heavenly. Accordingly, he believes the<i> tabernacle</i> here to be the heavenly Jerusalem, the worship-place of blessed spirits [Ps. xxix. 9] and of those men who have been rapt in vision thither [Isa. vi.],–the “<i>temple of the tabernacle Of witness</i>,” of Rev. xv. 5,—the place where God's<i> visible</i> presence [in contradistinction to His personal and invisible presence in the<i> holy places</i>] is manifested to his creatures angelic and human. In weighing these two opinions, I own they seem to me to run into one, and of that one by far the larger component is on Hofmann’s side.<br><br> For what is the Heavenly Jerusalem? What but the aggregate, in their persons and their glorious abiding-place, of the triumphant saints and servants of God? And what is this aggregate, but the mystical body of which Christ is the Head and they are the members, in its fulfilment and perfection? That glorified body of His, in which they are accepted before God, and in which as a heavenly temple they serve God, and God dwells, He has passed through, not by passing out of it, but by finally establishing it as an accomplished thing in God's sight, and in and as proceeding forth from it carrying on his intercession and<i> ministration in the true tabernacle</i>, in the<i> holy place</i> itself, See more on this subject, ch. ix. 11: and the views of Bleek, Tholuck, &c.: also a sermon of Schileiermacher’s on the text, vol. ii, of his Predigten, p. 504).
