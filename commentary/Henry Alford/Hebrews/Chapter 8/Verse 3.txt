<b> 3.</b>]<b> For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices</b> (see the very similar passage, ch. v. 1, and note there):<b> whence it is necessary that this (High Priest) also have somewhat which He may offer</b> (there is here considerable difficulty. For the Writer is evidently, from what follows, laying the stress on the<i> heavenly “ministry”</i> of Christ: and this “<i>somewhat to offer</i>” applies therefore to His work, not on earth, but in heaven, If so, how comes it to be said that He has somewhat to offer in heaven, seeing that His offering, of Himself, was made once for all, in contradistinction to those of the Levitical priests which were being constantly offered? See especially ch. x. 11, 12, which, on this view, brings the Writer here into direct contradiction to himself, In order to avoid this, Lũnemann and Hofmann attempt to make the “<i>somewhat to offer</i>” retrospective: “it is necessary for Him to have [there, in heaven] somewhat [viz. His body] which he may have offered.” But surely this is a view which cannot be admitted. The straightforward construction of our sentence makes it necessary that the words should refer to an act done in the state pointed out, however the nature of that act may be, in each ease of its being done, such as to be accomplished at the moment, and not enduring onwards: which latter would certainly involve the contradiction above spoken of. Thus regarded then, what is it which our High Priest in heaven has to offer? In ch. v. 7, He is described as<i> having offered</i> prayers and supplications in the days of His flesh: and it might be thought that His<i> interceding for us</i>, ch. vii. 25, might be here meant, the offering being those intercessions. But this would hardly satisfactorily give the force of the word<b> somewhat</b>, which, as Delitzsch remarks, is too concrete for such an interpretation. It must be something with which and by virtue of which, and as offering and applying which, our High Priest enters and ministers in the Holy of Holies above. Now if we look to the analogy of ch. ix.<b> 7, 12,</b> we see (1) that the high priest entered the holy place “<i>not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the ignorances of the people,</i>”— (2) that Christ is entered into the<i> holy places of heaven, not with the blood of goats and bulls, but by</i><b> His own blood</b>: see also ib. ver. 25. This BLOOD of the one offering, Christ is represented as bearing into the Holy Place, and its application is set ever forth to us as a continuing and constantly repeated one. Thus this<i> blood of sprinkling</i> is regarded us being in<i> heaven</i>, ch. xii. 24: as<i> being sprinkled on the believer as the end of his election</i>, 1 Pet. i. 2: as<i> cleansing us from all sin</i>, 1 John i. 7: as<i> that wherein the saints wash their robes and make them white</i>, Rev. vii. 14. Still, as Delitzsch also remarks, this is not the place to enlarge on this matter, seeing that it is merely incidentally introduced here, the present object being to shew that it is in heaven, and not on earth, that our High Priest ministers).
