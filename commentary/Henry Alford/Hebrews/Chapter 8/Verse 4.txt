<b> 4.] Yea, if</b> (the connexion is obvious: “our High Priest must have somewhat to offer. But<i> on earth</i> this could not be: yea, &c.”) H<b> e were on earth, He would not even</b><i> be</i><b> a Priest</b> (observe the emphasis: which is not, as Bleek, He would not even be a<i> priest</i>,<i> much less a High Priest</i>, but the stress is on the verb be, and it is taken as a matter agreed that the<i> High Priest</i> belonged to the genus<i> priest</i>: “He would not even belong to the category of priests.” In the background lies, “and if not so, certainly could not be a High Priest:” but it is not brought forward, nor does it belong to the argument),<b> since there are</b> ( ‘there are already:’ not, “<i>were</i>,” as is shewn by the<i> present tense</i> below. The time indicated is that of writing the Epistle)<b> those who offer the gifts according to</b> (the)<b> law:{5}men who serve</b> (this word thus rendered occurs eight times in St. Luke, four times in St. Paul, and six times in this Epistle. It has the general sense of “serving,” either God, as almost always: or some especial portion of divine service or sacred things, as here and ch. xiii. 10)<b> the delineation</b> (the word cannot, as in ch. iv. 11, mean, a pattern, or example: but must be taken as meaning a suggestive representation, or sketch)<b> and shadow</b> ( ‘adumbration.’ See on ch. x. 1, where the<i> shadow</i> and<i> image</i> are contrasted)<b> of the heavenly things</b> (i. e. the things in heaven, in the heavenly sanctuary. Chrysostom understands it of<i> spiritual</i> things:—and then goes on to instance the work of the Spirit in baptism, the power of the keys, the utterance of Christian praise, &c. But the context clearly requires the other view),<b> even as Moses was commanded</b> ( “<i>admonished of God</i>,” A.V., an excellent rendering)<b> when about to complete</b> (not in distinction from<i> beginning</i>, as if he were about to put the finishing stroke to the work already nearly ended: but involving the whole work: “to take in hand and carry on to completion”)<b> the tabernacle: for</b> (justifies the assertion by the following citation)<b> take heed, He says</b> (supply<i> God</i>; there can be no doubt of this here, where the words following are God’s own),<b> that thou makest all things</b> (this is not in the Septuagint, nor in the Hebrew, but is supplied also by Philo)<b> according to the pattern which was shewn thee in the mount</b>. If now we ask what this<b> pattern</b> was, we are met with various replies. Faber Stapulensis interprets it, “that what was shewn to Moses in the mount was not the truth itself, but only an adumbration and idea of it.” And so Schlichting, concluding, “so that the ancient tabernacle was only an example of an example, and a shadow of a shadow.” This view is strongly controverted by Delitzsch, who takes the<b> pattern</b> to be the veritable heavenly things themselves, not seen however by Moses directly and naturally, which would be impossible, but made visible to him in a vision. I do not see that there is much to choose between the two views. If the latter be taken, then surely the vision thus vouchsafed to Moses was itself only an intermediate representation, and so this view comes much to the same as the other.
