<b> CHAP. IX. 1.]</b> The chief train of thought and argument, although in the main forwarded, has been for the present somewhat broken, by the long citation in the last chapter. It is now resumed. Christ is the High Priest of a heavenly tabernacle, the Mediator of a covenant established upon better promises. This latter has been shewn ont of Scripture: and it has been proved that the old covenant was by that Scripture pronounced to be transitory and near its end. As such, it is now<i> compared in detail with this second and better one, as to its liturgical apparatus and proffered means of access to God.</i> These are detailed somewhat minutely, mention being even made of some which are not insisted on, nor their symbolism explained: and the main point of comparison, the access into the holiest place, is hastened on. In this particular especially the infinite superiority of the new covenant is insisted on: and the whole access of Christ into God’s presence for us is elaborately contrasted with the former insufficient ceremonial access by means of animal sacrifices. In one point, above all, is this contrast brought out:<i> the supreme efficacy of the blood of Christ, as set against the nullity of the blood of bulls and of goats to purge away sin</i>. Then the subject of the heavenly tabernacle and holy place is recurred to, and the future prospect of Christ’s reappearing from thence opened.<br><br><b> 1.] Now accordingly</b> (this takes up the thought of ch. viii. 5, where the command is recited directing Moses to make the tabernacle after the pattern shewn him in the mount. In pursuance of that command it was that<i> the first covenant had</i>, &c.)<b> the first</b> [<b>covenant</b>] (not, the first<i> tabernacle</i>, as the received text in the Greek wrongly and clumsily glosses.

But I prefer the other view)<b> also</b> (as well as this second and more perfect covenant: not that this has all the things below mentioned, but that it too possesses its corresponding liturgical appliances, though of a higher kind)<b> ordinances</b> ( “the old covenant also had liturgical ordinances, which were of divine right, ordinances which rested their obligatory right upon revelation from God and declaration of His will.” Delitzsch)<b> of service</b> (<i>worship:</i> see ch. viii. 5 and note),<b> and its</b> (or,<i> the:</i> see below)<b> worldly sanctuary</b> (as the whole passage treats of the distinction between the two sanctuaries, one into which the Levitical priests entered, and the other into which Christ is entered, it is certain that the signification must be local only.
