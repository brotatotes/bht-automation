See the very parallel place, Col. ii. 16. The law prescribed much about eating: nothing: about drinking, except some general rules of uncleanness, such as Lev. xi. 34,—and in peculiar cases, such as the prohibition of wine to the Nazarite, Numb. vi. 3,—and to the priests when on actual service in the tabernacle, Lev. x. 9. But subsequent circumstances and usage added other observances and precedents: as, e.g. Dan. i. 8; Hagg. ii 13. See Matt. xxiii. 24; Rom. xiv. 21. So there is no necessity to suppose that the allusion is to the feasts after sacrifice [ch. xiii. 10], or to the passover. The<i> divers washings may</i> refer to all the washings ordained by the law, Exod. xxix. 4; Lev. xi. 25, 28, 32, 40; xiv. 6–9; xv. 5 ff.; xvi. 4, 24 ff.; Numb. viii. 7; xix. 17 ff. But it seems likely that not the sacredotal washings, so much as those prescribed to or observed by the people, are mainly in view: such as those mentioned in Mark vii. 4),<b> ordinances of</b> [the]<b> flesh</b> (i. e. belonging to flesh, as opposed to spirit.

The expression probably refers to ch. viii. 8 f.,—the time when God would make with His people a better covenant. I need hardly remind the reader who has kept pace with what has been said on<i> “the time now present”</i> above that this time of<b> reformation</b> is one and the same with that. Those who give another meaning there, yet agree in referring these words to Christian times).
