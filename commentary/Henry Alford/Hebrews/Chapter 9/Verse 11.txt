<i>The fulfilment of these types by Christ.</i><b> But</b> (the contrast is to the ineffectiveness and the merely provisional nature of the Levitical offerings)<b> Christ</b> (not “Jesus” here: because the Writer will introduce with emphasis that name which carries with it the fulfilment of all type and prophecy. Nor again<i> “the Christ,”</i> because he will not say that ‘the Messiah’ was come, but will use that well-known name as a personal name belonging to Him whom now all Christians know by it)<b> having appeared</b> (the verb here used is the usual word for<i> appearing</i> or<i> coming forward</i> as a historical person: appearing on the stage of the world. And it is of this appearance of Christ in history that the word is here used. That appearance was the point of demarcation between prophecy and fulfilment, between the old covenant and the new. So that the expression is rather to be taken of the whole accomplished course of Christ summed up in one, than either of His first incarnation upon earth, or of His full inauguration into His Melchisedec High Priesthood in heaven)<b> as High Priest of the good things to come</b> (i. e. in this case, the blessed promises of the Christian covenant, different, in the very nautre of the case, from<i> their</i> “good things to come,” but still, in formal expression, a term common to them and us: so that the expression, “high priest of the good things to come,” might in its scantiness of sense have been used of a Jewish High Priest, just as it is in its fulness of completed sense used of Christ now. It is hardly necessary to add that I take<b> to come</b> as meaning’ not, which were future<i> in respect of the law</i>, but which<i> are now</i> future; the<i> “incorruptible inheritance”</i> of 1 Pet. i. 4, the<i> “things hoped for”</i> of our ch. xi. 1: see our Writer’s usage in reff. The genitive after the word<b> High Priest</b> is not an attributive, but an objective one: the<i> good things to come</i> are the objects and ultimate regard of His High Priesthood),<b> through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this creation</b> (1)<i> How are these words to be constructed?</i> 2)<i> to what tabernacle do they refer?</i> 1)<i> they belong to</i><b> entered</b> below, not to<i> what went before</i>. For in that case<b> neither</b> would he left without any preceding member of the negation to follow, or it must be considered as the sequence to<i> “not made with hands,”</i> or to<i> “not of this creation,”</i> either of which would be absurd. 2) the<b> through</b> is<i> local:</i> as the Jewish High Priest passed through the<i> first tabernacle</i> in entering into the earthly<i> holy place</i>, so our High Priest has passed through the<i> greater and more perfect tabernacle</i> to enter into the heavenly<i> holy place</i>. But, this settled, 2)<i> what is</i> this greater and more perfect tabernacle? The Fathers for the most part interpret it of<i> Christ's body</i> or<i> human nature</i>. Ebrard takes it of<i> Christ's holy life</i>, and<i> “the holy place”</i> of His exaltation; passing, in fact, from reality into symbol: others explain it of<i> the Church on earth:</i> others, of the<i> whole world:</i> Hofmann, of<i> the glorified Body of Christ</i>, which, and not the Body of His flesh, he maintains can alone be said to be<i> not of this creation</i>, and in which dwells [Col. ii. 9] all the fulness of the Godhead bodily: Bleek, De Wette, Lünemann, and Stier, of the<i> lower region of the heavens</i>, through which Christ passed in ascending to the throne of God. Tholnek thinks it to be merely a superadded feature, having no representation in reality but serving only to complete the idea of a heavenly sanctuary. Delitzsch keeps to his interpretation in ch. viii. 2 [which see discussed in note there], as against Hofmann. But here, as there, I believe that his and Hofmann’s views run up into one; though perhaps here the weight is on his side, as it was there on Hofmann’s. The<i> tabernacle</i> here, as in ch. viii. 2, is the<i> heavens</i> [see ch. iv. 14] through which Christ passed not only locally, but conditionally, being the abode of blessed spirits and just men made perfect: corresponding to His mystical Body [see on ch. viii. 2: and below, on the other epithets of this tabernacle], and<i> the holy place is the heaven itself</i> [ver. 24], the especial abode of the invisible and unapproachable God. As regards the epithets of this<i> tabernacle</i>, first it is distinguished by the article<i> the</i>,<i> “that tabernacle of which we know.”</i> Then it is called<b> greater</b>, in contrast with the small extent and import of that other, and more<b> perfect</b>, in contrast with its ineffectiveness and its exclusion from the divine presence: perhaps also with its merely symbolical, and its transitory nature. “The indeterminate<b> not made with hands</b>, a word of St. Luke in similar connexion, Acts vii. 48; xvii. 24, is explained by the Writer himself by<b> not of this creation</b>, and serves as an apposition to the preceding. That tabernacle is not built by hands of men, but by the Lord Himself, ch. viii. 2; it is of His own immediate placing, not belonging to this creation, not only not to this material creation which surrounds us, out of which we get our building materials, but altogether not to this first and present creation: it belongs to the age of the future, to the glorified world.” Delitzsch. The rendering<i> “not of this building,”</i> A.V. is wrong, and misses the idea, giving in fact a tautological explanation for<i> “not made with</i><i> hands”</i>);
