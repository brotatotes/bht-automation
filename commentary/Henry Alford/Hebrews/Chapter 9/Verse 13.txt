In distinction from the legal offerings which were constantly repeated, He has, by his offering of Himself, performed the actual will of God which willed salvation [ch. x. 1–10]: our Sanctification is now for ever accomplished, and the exalted Saviour reigns in expectation of ultimate victory [x. 11–14]: and the promised new covenant has come in, resting on an eternal forgiveness of sins which requires no further offering [x. 15–18].” Delitzsch.
