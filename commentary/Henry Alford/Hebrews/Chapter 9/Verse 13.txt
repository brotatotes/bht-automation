In distinction from the legal offerings which were constantly repeated, He has, by his offering of Himself, performed the actual will of God which willed salvation [ch. x. 1–10]: our Sanctification is now for ever accomplished, and the exalted Saviour reigns in expectation of ultimate victory [x. 11–14]: and the promised new covenant has come in, resting on an eternal forgiveness of sins which requires no further offering [x. 15–18].” Delitzsch.<br><br><b> ashes</b> has no article, because the ashes were to be laid up, and a portion used as wanted)<b> sprinkling those</b><b> who have been defiled, sanctifieth to</b> (so as to bring about)<b> the purity</b> (not<i> “purifying,”</i> as A, V.)<b> of the flesh</b> (it is evident, that the Writer speaks only of the Levitical rites in their matter-of-fact results as works done, not of any divine grace which might accrue to the soul of the faithful Israelite from a spiritual partaking in them. The outward effect of the sacrifices of the day of atonement, as well as of the sprinkling of the ashes of the heifer, was, to render ceremonially pure before God, in the one case from the imputation of the defilement of sin on the whole people, in the other, from the defilement actually contracted by contact with death or uncleaness. These effects they had in themselves: what others they had, out of themselves, belonged not so much to them, as to that great Sacrifice which they represented):<b> how much more</b> (see the logical connexion at the end)<b> shall</b><b> the blood of</b> [<b>the</b>]<b> Christ, who through the</b><b> eternal Spirit offered</b> HIMSELF (emphatic)<b> without fault to God</b> (first,<i> when</i> did He offer Himself? Clearly not, as Socinus, and others, when he presented himself to God in heaven. For, as Delitzsch rightly observes, when Christ is antitypically or by way of contrast compared with the<i> victims</i> of the Old Test. sacrifices, as the ritual term<b> without fault</b> here shews that He is, then beyond question the offering on the cross is intended, which corresponds to the slaying the victim and offering him on the altar. Besides which, the ‘oblation in the holy place’ was but the completion of the ‘oblation on the altar,’ and, when Christ’s self-offering is spoken of generally, we are to take the whole from the beginning, not merely that which was the last act of it. This will guide us to the meaning of the somewhat difficult words,<b> through the eternal Spirit.</b> The animals which were offered had no will,<i> no spirit</i> of their own, which could concur with the act of sacrifice. Theirs was a transitory life, of no potency or virtue. They were offered<i> through the</i><i> law</i> rather than<i> through</i> any consent, or agency, or counteragency, of their own But Christ offered Himself, with His own consent assisting and empowering the sacrifice. And what was that consent? The consent of what? of the spirit of a man? such a consent as yours or mine, given in and through our finite spirit whose acts are bounded by its own allotted space in time and its own responsibilities? No: but the consenting act of His divine Personality—His<i> “eternal Spirit,”</i> His Godhead, which from before time acquiesced in, and wrought with, the redemption-purpose of the Father. Thus we have<i> spirit</i> contrasted with<i> flesh</i> in speaking of our Lord, in several places: see Rom. i. 3, 4; 1 Tim. iii. 16; 1 Pet. iii. 18. This divine Personality it was, which in the Resurrection so completely ruled and absorbed His<i> flesh:</i> this, which causes Him to be spoken of by St. Paul in 1 Cor. xv. 45 as a<i> “life-giving Spirit,”</i> and in 2 Cor. iii. 17 f. as absolutely<i> “the Spirit.”</i> Not however that any confusion hence arises in the distinction of the divine Persons:<i> “the eternal Spirit”</i> is not the Spirit of the Father dwelling in Christ, nor is it the Holy Spirit given without measure to Christ, but it is the divine Spirit of the Godhead which Christ Himself had and was in His inner Personality. And the relevancy of such a clause here is, that the eternal Spirit is absolute spirit, divine spirit, and thus self-conscious, laying down its own course purely of itself unbound by: conditions, simply and entirely free: so that Christ’s offering of Himself<i> through the Eternal Spirit</i>, is, as such, a moral act of absolute worth.<br><br><b> through</b>, i.e. by virtue of: so that His divine Spirit was the agent in the<b> offering</b>, penetrating and acting on the Humanity.<br><br><b> without fault</b>, as above observed, is the regular word of the ritual in reference to the victims which must be without spot when offered. Therefore to understand it of the perfection of the glorified human nature of the ascended Saviour, as the Socinian interpreters, is clearly beside the meaning, and contrary to analogy),<b> purify our</b> (the question of reading,<b> our</b> or<b> your</b>, is one not easy to settle. At the word<i> “purify”</i> we unfortunately lose the evidence of the great Vatican MS.: as it terminates there, and has been completed by a later hand. From all analogy it would seem that we must infer our English word<i> conscience</i> does not reach the fulness of the term here used, the<i> self-consciousness as regards to God</i>, the inner consciousness of relation to Him. This is, by the blood of Christ, shed in the power of the divine Spirit, thoroughly purified, freed from the terror of guilt, cleared from alienation from Him and from all selfish regards and carnal pretences, and rendered living and real as He is living and real)<b> from dead works</b> (just as death was under the old law the fountain of ceremonial pollution, and any one by touching a dead body became unclean, so carnal works, having their origin in sin, with which death is bound up, pollute the conscience. They are like the touching of the dead body, rendering the man unclean in God’s sight, as not springing from life in Him: inducing decay and corruption in the spirit. See on ch. vi. 1, and Chrysostom there quoted. Here, the reference to the dead body can hardly be set aside, being more pointed than there, where I have rather advocated the general sense. The Writer does not here set forth<i> how</i> this blood of Christ acts in purifying the conscience: it is not his aim now to speak of<i> our</i> way of participation of its benefits, but merely of<i> its</i> cleansing power itself)<b> in order to the serving</b> (ministering to, which the unclean might not do in the ceremonial sanctuary, nor can the unclean do in heart and life)<b> the living God</b> (God in His spiritual reality and absolute holiness: not a God concealed by veils and signs, but approached in his verity by the sanctified soul)?
