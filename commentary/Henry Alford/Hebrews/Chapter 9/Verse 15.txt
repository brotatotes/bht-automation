<b> 15.]</b> See summary above at ver. 13. This pre-eminent spiritual virtue of His redeeming blood constitutes his fitness to be the Mediator of the new covenant, the main blessing of which, forgiveness, extends even back over the insufficient former one, and ensures the inheritances to the called.<b> And on this</b><b> account</b> (<i>on account of this virtue of His blood:</i> or if it seem better, extend the reference further back still, over vv. 11–14,<i> on account of the great work which He hath accomplished by his death:</i> “because these things are so”)<b> is He mediator of a new covenant</b> (see ch. viii. 6 and note),<b> in order that,—death having taken place, for the propitiation of the transgressions under the first covenant,—they who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance</b> (first, the object of the new covenant is an eternal<i> inheritance</i>,—see ver. 11; ch. ii. 5: and therefore the idea of<i> inheritance</i> having once come in, gives to the word<i> covenant</i> [<i>diatheké</i>] that shade of meaning which is deepened and insisted on below, viz. that of a TESTAMENTARY covenant or arrangement.<br><br><b> receiving the promise</b> is to he taken in the sense of receiving the fulfilment of a promise, not merely of having the promise granted. Then, the<b> called</b> are the<i> “partakers in the heavenly calling”</i> of ch. iii. 1: compare also<i> “the high calling”</i> of Phil. iii. 14. Calvin well remarks, “He speaks of the called, that he the better conciliate the Jews, who were partakers calling.” This end, of the called being put in possession of the promise of the eternal inheritance, is to be attained<i> “by death having taken place Sor the propitiation of the transgressions under the first testament.”</i> Without this death, it could not be attained. The full reason of this, that death must take place first, is presently gone into: it is with the concluding words of this clause that we are at present concerned. These<i> transgressions under the first covenant</i> are in fact those of all mankind. Israel was a pattern of God’s dealings with all: and His revelation of His will to Israel extended categorically to all mankind. Against this will, primavally revealed, revealed to the patriarchs, revealed in the law, our parents and the antediluvian earth, the sons of Noah and the postdiluvian earth, Israel itself as a people, had deeply and repeatedly transgressed: and before a new inheritance by testament could come in, there must be a propitiation of all these former transgressions. All the propitiatory sacrifices, so called, of the former covenant, were but imperfect and typical: but as this is to be a real inheritance, so there must be real and actual propitiation. See the remarkable parallel, Acts xiii. 39).
