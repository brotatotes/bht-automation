<b> 19.]</b><b> For</b> (explanation of the assertion in last verse)<b> when every commandment had been spoken according to the law</b> (these last words,<b> according to the law</b>, belong not to<i> precept</i>, but to<b> spoken</b>, spoken according to the law, i.e. as the law directed, not varying from it in any point)<b> by Moses to all</b><b> the people</b> (see Exod. xxiv. 3),<b> taking the</b><b> blood</b> (the additional detail of Exod. xxiv. 5 is omitted, viz, that “he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto the Lord.” It was of this blood that Moses took)<b> of the calves and goats</b> (the former only are mentioned in Exodus. But this is only said of the peace-offerings. The<i> burnt-offerings</i> [see above], after the analogy of the rites on the day of atonement, might be presumed to be goats. Indeed the key to the additions made here to the text of Exodus is, that the account is filled up by subsequent usage. We may presume, that the solemn legal appointment of various ceremonial details was in fact only a divine sanction of practices already existing: sacrifice having been long in use, and that under the direction and approval of God Himself),<b> with water</b> (prescribed, in Numb. xix. 6, 17, to be mixed with the ashes of the red heifer which were to be kept for purifying: compare also Lev. xiv. 50 f.: see above),<b> and scarlet wool, and hyssop</b> (see Lev. xiv. 49 ff.: by comparing which with Numb. xix. as above, it may fairly be inferred, as our text here assures us was the fact, that these instruments where the ordinary ones in cleansing and sprinkling, even before their positive enactment as such by the law. The hyssop indeed we find thus prescribed, Exod. xii. 22, in sprinkling the blood on the doorposts at the Passover. As to the manner of using, the stalk or bunch of hyssop was wrapt round with scarlet wool to make it absorb the blood, being tied with the same wool to a staff of cedar-wood to keep it stiff. On<i> hyssop</i> itself, there are various opinions. The most approved makes it to be a plant growing on walls, ‘hyssopus officinalis,’ with small lancet-formed woolly leaves, about an inch long, a knotty stalk from 1 to 1 ½ foot high, with blue [sometimes white] flowers),<b> he sprinkled both the book itself</b> (nothing is said of this in Exod. xxiv. The book is of course that out of which he had just read the ordinances of God. If, as Stier supposes, Moses took the book [Exod. xxiv. 7] from off the altar where it was lying when he sprinkled the altar with blood, then the book was sprinkled likewise: but nothing in the text of Exodus implies this),<b> and all the people</b> (of course the words<i> all the people</i> are not to be taken to mean that he sprinkled every individuals; but merely the whole mass, as they stood),<b> saying, This is the blood of the testament</b> (in Exod. xxiv. 8,<i> “Behold the blood...”</i> It has been suggested, that the change has been made by the Writer after the tenor of the New Test. inauguration of the testament by our Lord, “This cup is the New Testament in my blood,” Luke xxii. 20)<b> which God</b> (in Exod. xxiv. 8,<i> “the Lord;”</i> Jehovah: changed apparently to preserve more completely the Old Test. character of the saying)<b> commanded in regard to you</b> (it is much disputed, how the logic of this passage can cohere: seeing that how properly soever the latter<i> diatheké</i> may be spoken of and argued on as being a testament, the former one could have no such character, and consequently cannot be thus argued on. And the question is very variously answered according to the standing point of different Commentators. The matter seems to stand thus. The word<i> diatheké</i> has the double sense of a covenant and a testament. Both these senses may be applied to both<i> covenants:</i> to the latter more properly belongs the testamentary sense, but to the former also in as far as it was typical of and foreshadowed the other. In the latter, all is clear. Christ, the heir of all things, has bequeathed to us His people an everlasting inheritance; has died, sealing the testament with His blood. In the former all this is formally, though inadequately represented. The<i> inheritance,</i> faintly shadowed forth by temporal possessions, had yet a recognized blessed meaning far beyond those possessions: the testator was imperfectly, but still was formally represented by the animals slain in sacrifice:<i> there</i> was a death,<i> there</i> was a sprinkling of and sealing by blood: and surely it requires no more stretch of concession to acknowledge the victim in sacrifice to represent the Lamb of God in his sonship and his heritorship, than it does in his innocence and propitiatory power. The one idea is just as poorly and inadequately set forth by it as the other. But in both cases there is an inheritance, and in both it is the same. In both it is bequeathed: in the latter actually by One who has come in person and died: in the former, only typically, by the same One ceremonially present. So that, if our<b> whence</b> in ver. 18 were to be filled up, it would be, “Whence, i.e. since the former covenant also had its testamentary side, and thus was analogous to as well as typical of the latter.”
