<b> 22.] And almost (one may say, that) in</b> [<b>with</b>]<b> blood all things are purified</b> (there is a combination throughout of the ideas of the inheritance by testament, whereof the death is a condition, and the purification by covenant, whereof the death is the efficient cause. The combination is not a rhetorical figure in the mind of the Writer, but a deep truth in the verity of God. The same Death which purifies us from guilt, makes us partakers of the kingdom of glory; the same Blood which cleanses us from sin, seals the testament of our inheritance. The face that<i> almost</i> in all cases the law purified by blood, provides for such exceptions as Exod. xix. 10; Lev. xv. 5 ff.; xvi. 26, 28; xxii. 6; Numb. xxxi. 22–24)<b> according to the law</b> (i. e. receive legal purification);<b> and that apart from shedding</b> (literally,<b> pouring out</b>)<b> of blood</b> (there has been a question, whether this<b> pouring out</b> imports the shedding of blood in the slaughter of the victims, or the pouring out of the blood at the foot of the altar, so often enjoined in the ordinances of legal sacrifice. “It seems most probable that the Writer here has the<i> shedding of blood</i> in mind. It would not by any means follow, that he treats this blood-<i>shedding</i> as a propitiation. He does not directly call it the<i> medium</i> of forgiveness, he says only, that apart from it there was no remission, that it is the indispensable means to obtain the expiatory life’s blood.... One thing which determines the reference to be to the<i> shedding</i> of blood, is the expression,<i> ‘which is being shed for you,’</i> in the institution of the Lord’s Supper in Luke xxii. 20,—at all events the close parallel in word and in thought to this. It is hardly probable that the Writer would mean<i> a pouring out of blood,</i> of which that so called on Christ’s part is not the antitype: not to say that since ver. 13,<i> blood and death</i> have been ideas most closely connected,” Delitzsch)<b> there cometh not</b> (taketh not place)<b> remission</b> (viz.<i> of sins</i>, As to the fact, Lev. xvii. 11 sufficiently proves it: and the Rabbis deduced from that passage an axiom almost verbatim the same as our text: “There is no expiation except through blood.” The case of the poor man, who cannot afford the animal victim, Lev. vv. 11–13, seems to present. an exception, and to justify the application of the<i> “one may almost say”</i> to this clause).
