<b> 23.] There</b> [<b>was</b>] (more probably than<i> ‘is’</i> seeing that he was before speaking, not of the renewed cleansing year by year, but of the solemn inauguration: and much more, now that he is coming to speak of the heavenly sanctuary, must hebe asserting a necessity not of continually renewed cleansing, but of a past one, once for all)<b> necessity therefore</b> (this first inference follows from the facts just mentioned: and is introduced only to lead the way to the second,<i> “but the heavenly things themselves, &c.,”</i> which itself is a conclusion from the analogy between type and antitype, and is the converse of the proposition of verses 13, 14)<b> that the delineations</b> (or<b> figures</b>; not,<i> “patterns:”</i> at least not in the present acceptation of that word. The heavenly things themselves would be the patterns, or antitypes. See on ch. viii. 5)<b> of the things in the heavens</b> (i. e. of the heavenly tabernacle with its contents: see below)<b> should be purified</b> (for the<i> “dedication”</i> was in fact not only an inauguration, but a purification likewise: and the proposition of ver. 22,— “wherever there is<i> remission</i>, there is<i> blood-shedding</i>,”—will bear converting,—wherever there is a sprinkling with blood, there is remission, and consequently, purification)<b> with these</b> (i. e. not the various purifications mentioned up to this time, the ashes of the red heifer included; for these last were never used to purity the tabernacle or its vessels: nor again, “blood and the like,” e.g. the oil which was used with it; for this has not been mentioned: nor, with such things, viz. Levitical ordinances, which is far too vague. It is the blood, and that only, which is meant: the plural being used most probably to indicate the animals slain, the<i> “goats and calves”</i>);<b> but the heavenly things themselves</b> (i. e. heaven and the things therein: see the next verse, of which Bleck well remarks, that the junction to this by<i> “for”</i> can only then be valid when those words refer to the same as our<i> “heavenly things themselves.”</i> But it has appeared difficult to Commentators to understand, how heaven itself should need this cleansing. Consequently various expedients have b adopted: and various meanings given, which I have discussed in my Greek Test., and have found all equally futile. We must rest in the plain and literal sense: that<i> the heaven itself needed, and obtained, purification</i> by the atoning blood of Christ. And if we enquire how this could be, we may find an answer in reflecting on the consequence of man’s sin on the mind and aspect of God towards him. That unclouded benignity wherewith the Creator contemplated his creation, Gen. i. 31, had become overcast by the divine anger on account of sin, but was again restored by Him in whom the Father<i> was well pleased</i> the darkness being by His blood turned into light, the frown into an eternal smile. So Delitzsch beautifully: “If I see aright, the meaning of the Writer is, in its ground-thought, this: the supernal holiest place, i.e. as ver. 24 shows,<i> heaven itself</i>, the uncreated eternal heaven of God, although in itself untroubled light, yet needed a<i> purification</i> in so far as the light of Love towards man was, so to speak, outflared and obscured by the fire of wrath against sinful man; and the heavenly tabernacle, i.e. the place of God’s revealing of His majesty and grace for angels and men, needed a<i> purification</i>, in so far as men had rendered this place, which was destined for them from the beginning, unapproachable by reason of their sin, and so it must be changed into an approachable place of manifestation of a God gracious to men”)<b> with sacrifices</b> (categoric plural of an abstract proposition: not therefore implying that the sacrifice was repeated: applicable in its reality, only to the one Sacrifice of the body of Christ once for all, and most emphatically designating that<i> as a sacrifice</i>)<b> better than</b> (see on ch. i. 4)<b> these.</b>
