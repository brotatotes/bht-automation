<p><strong> 23</strong> .] <strong> There</strong> ( <strong> was</strong> ) (more probably than ‘ <em> is</em> ,’ seeing that he was before speaking, not of the renewed cleansing year by year, but of the solemn inauguration: and much more, now that he is coming to speak of the heavenly sanctuary, must he be asserting a necessity not of continually renewed cleansing, but of a past one, once for all) <strong> necessity therefore</strong> (this first inference follows from the facts just mentioned: and is introduced only to lead the way to the second, αὐτὰ δέ κ . τ . λ ., which itself is a conclusion from the analogy between type and antitype, and is the converse of the ‘a fortiori’ proposition of Heb 9:13-14 ) <strong> that the delineations</strong> not, “ <em> patterns</em> :” at least not in the present acceptation of that word. The heavenly things themselves would be the patterns, or antitypes. See on ch. Heb 8:5 ) <strong> of the things in the heavens</strong> (i. e. of the heavenly tabernacle with its contents: see below) <strong> should be purified</strong> (for the ἐγκαινίζειν was in fact not only an inauguration, but a purification likewise: and the proposition of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:22">Hebrews 9:22</span> , ‘wherever there is ἄφεσις , there is αἱματεκχυσία ,’ will bear converting, wherever there is a sprinkling with blood, there is remission, and consequently, purification) <strong> with these</strong> (i. e. not the various purifications mentioned up to this time, the ashes of the red heifer included, as Lünem., al.; for these last were never used to purify the tabernacle or its vessels: nor again, “blood and the like,” e. g. the oil which was used with it, as De Wette, al.; for this has not been mentioned: nor, “talibus, nempe rebus Leviticis,” as Böhme, which is far too vague. It is the blood, and that only, which is meant: the plural being used most probably to indicate the animals slain, the τράγοι κ . μόσχοι ), <strong> but the heavenly things themselves</strong> (i. e. heaven and the things therein: cf. εἰς αὐτὸν τὸν οὐρανόν in the next verse, of which Bleek well remarks, that the junction to this by γάρ can only then be valid when those words refer to the same as our αὐτὰ τὰ ἐπουράνια . But it has appeared difficult to Commentators to understand, how heaven itself should need this cleansing. Consequently various expedients have been adopted: and various meanings given, either to τὰ ἐπουράνια or to the verb. Luther, Calv., Beza, Grot., Le Clerc, Ebrard, Lünem., al. (not Bleek, as Ebr.) would understand καθαρίζεσθαι to be applied only by zeugma to the second member of our sentence, and would get out of it the idea ἐγκαινίζεσθαι , or “aditum pati,” or something of the kind. But to this we may answer, with Delitzsch, that every kind of inauguration, or patefaction, passed upon the heavenly things themselves by means of <em> blood</em> , must mean an inauguration or patefaction by means of propitiatory purification: so that the difficulty remains where it was. Thos. Aquinas (“Mundantur cœlestia, quatenus homines mundantur a peccatis”), Bengel (“i. e. usus redditus sanctus respectu nostri”), Tholuck, al. understand it of our being purified to inherit or enter heaven: which Delitzsch properly calls, after the difference which has been already in the text indicated between the purification of person and of the tabernacle, a precarious ‘quid pro quo.’ Still less can we accept the interpretations given in the ancient expositors, e. g. Chrys. ( αὐτὰ τὰ ἐπουράνια , τουτέστι τὴν φιλοσοφίαν τὴν παρ ʼ ἡμῖν , τοὺς ἐκεῖ κεκλημένους ), Œc. ( τουτέστι , τὰ τῆς νέας ( διαθήκης )), Thdrt. ( οὐράνια δὲ τὰ πνευματικὰ κέκληκεν , οἷς ἡ ἐκκλησία καθαίρεται ), Thl. ( τουτέστι , τὰ τῆς ἐκκλησίας τὰ ἡμέτερα ): so also Primasius, Aymo, Psuedo-Anselm. See this view well met in Justiniani. More literally, some have interpreted it with a view to the expulsion of Satan from heaven spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:18">Luke 10:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span> , and especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+12:7-9">Revelation 12:7-9</span> ; see also our ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span> . So Akersloot, and Bleek. But this does not meet the requirements of the case. There would thus be no cleansing, as far as the relations of God and men are concerned: none, to which the propitiatory effect of blood would in any way apply. We must therefore rest in the plain and literal sense: that <em> the heaven itself needed, and obtained, purification</em> by the atoning blood of Christ. And if we enquire how this could be, we may find an answer in reflecting on the consequence of man’s sin on the mind and aspect of God towards him. That unclouded benignity wherewith the Creator contemplated his creation, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:31">Genesis 1:31</span> , had become overcast by the divine anger on account of sin, but was again restored by Him in whom the Father εὐδόκησεν , the darkness being by His blood turned into light, the frown into an eternal smile. So Delitzsch beautifully: “If I see aright, the meaning of the Writer is, in its ground thought, this: the supernal holiest place, i. e., as Heb 9:24 shews, αὐτὸς ὁ οὐρανός , the uncreated eternal heaven of God, although in itself untroubled light, yet needed a καθαρίζεσθαι in so far as the light of Love towards man was, so to speak, outflared and obscured by the fire of wrath against sinful man; and the heavenly tabernacle, i. e. the place of God’s revealing of His majesty and grace for angels and men, needed a καθαρίζεσθαι , in so far as men had rendered this place, which was destined for them from the beginning, unapproachable by reason of their sin, and so it must be changed into an approachable place of manifestation of a God gracious to men”) <strong> with sacrifices</strong> (categoric plural of an abstract proposition: not therefore implying that the sacrifice was repeated: applicable in its reality, only to the one Sacrifice of the body of Christ once for all, and most emphatically designating that <em> as a sacrifice</em> ) <strong> better than</strong> (see on ch. Heb 1:4 ) <strong> these</strong> .</p>
