<b> 24.]</b> He now reasserts, under the fuller light which has since been cast upon it, that which was enounced in verses 11, 12, and by it shews at what the term<i> heavenly places</i> above pointed. In fact, as Delitzsch observes, the proposition of vv. 11, 12, has been in course of elucidation ever since: in vv. 13, 14, he explained<i> “through his own blood,”</i> in vv. 15–23 the<i> “high priest of the good things to come,”</i> and now the<i> “entered once for all into the holy place.”</i><b> For</b> (resumption of<i> the heavenly things</i> above)<b> not into</b><b> holy places made with hands</b> (such as those into which the Jewish high priests entered: see above, ver. 11: and the two expressions Acts vii. 48; xvii. 24)<b> did Christ enter, counterfeits of the true</b> [holy places] (literally,<b> antitypes</b>, correspondent to the<i> type</i>; either, as in this case,<i> copies from</i> a pattern, viz. the<i> type</i> shewn in the mount, however understood, ch. viii. 5, also Rom. v. 14, or the<i> reality corresponding</i><i> to</i> a previously shewn figure, as baptism in 1 Pet. iii. 21, where baptism is the<i> antitype</i> to the food of Noah: which latter is our more usual English sense of antitype. The<i> true</i>, genuine<i> holy</i><i> places</i> are those in heaven, where God's presence is manifested. See below);<b> but into the heaven itself</b> (none of the<i> heavens</i>, all of which the Lord<i> has gone through</i>, ch. iv. 14,—but the very holiest place, where God peculiarly reveals Himself, and which is uncreated. Delitzsch quotes from Sebastian Schmidt, “The heaven into which Christ hath entered is not any form of the created heaven, but the heaven in which God is irrespective of any created heaven,—the very divine glory itself.” Hence what follows),<b> now</b> (in the present dispensation: almost equivalent to<i> henceforth</i>. It is an anticipation of the next verse)<b> to be manifested</b> (as to the peculiar propriety of the term<b> to be made manifest</b>. It is one found mostly in St. Luke (Acts). It. is there principally in the sense of<i> making manifest</i>, giving information: in Matt. xxviii. 53, it is used of the bodies of the saints appearing to many: and in John xiv. 21, 22, of Jesus manifesting himself to his people. But the key-text to the understanding of it here is Exod. xxxiii. 13. Moses desired to advance beyond the mere vision of God, and prayed<i> “manifest thyself to me”</i> [so in the Greek of the Septuagint, the same verb being used as here]. This, which might not be granted to Moses [nor to any man, compare Lev. xvi. 13]—this open sight of God, is that which takes place between the Father and the Son. “None knoweth the Son but the Father.” There is no veil hiding the Father’s face from the Son: so completely does this<i> manifestation</i> take place, that he is the perfect image of the Father: “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father:” “No man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him”)<b> to</b> (before)<b> the face of God</b> Rev. xxii. 4, where it is said that the servants of God shall see<i> His face</i>)<b> for us</b> (this is the intent of His entrance into the heavenly sanctuary, to appear and to plead<i> for</i><i> us:</i> see ch. vii. 25. “He brings before the face of God no offering which has exhausted itself and, as only sufficing for a time, needs renewal; but He himself is in person our offering, and by virtue of the eternal Spirit, i.e. of the imperishable life. of His person, now for ever freed from death, our eternally present offering before God.” Delitzsch).<br><br> By very many expositors, the construction of this verse is differently taken. Some understand<i> “hath been manifested”</i> of His appearance before God. But this cannot be for a moment maintained. Analogy is wholly against it, and so is the<i> second appearance</i>, mentioned below: not to mention that had it been so, we should certainly have had<i> before</i><i> God</i>, or some such qualification, added).
