<b> 27.] And inasmuch as</b> (seeing that Christ is not only a<i> fit object of comparison</i> with man, but<i> is</i> man)<b> it is appointed to men</b> (all men)<b> once</b> (and no more)<b> to die, and after that, judgment</b> (not necessarily here to be taken on its unfavourable side: the word is perfectly general: nor is there, as Böhne imagined, any opposition between<i> men</i> here and<i> those that wait for Him</i> below. Such opposition indeed would mar the whole context, which has a totally different object, and deals with the general and inevitable fate of all men indiscriminately. Nor again must the question, whether judgment is spoken of as immediately to follow death, or after an interval, be imported into the consideration of the text. The indefinite<b> after that</b> does not admit of any such question being raised.<i> Next</i> to death, with no more like events between, comes judgment: this is the fact contemplated—the appointed destiny of man, according to which that of the man Christ Jesus also, as far as it is applicable to Him, is apportioned):<b> so also the Christ</b> (not Christ, without the article, but<b> the</b> Christ, that man who was God’s Christ—<i>the</i><b></b><i> Christ</i>, it being plain and palpable to all that<i> the Christ</i> belongs to the category,<i> men</i>. In ver. 24, the case was different),<b> once</b> (for all)<b> having been offered</b> (not the same as ‘having offered himself.’ The form and the meaning are both passive; and the reason of this is, I believe, to be found in the fact that it is in this verse not so much the agency, as the destiny of Christ, that is spoken of; that which, though the expression itself is avoided with regard to Him, is appointed for Him as for us. It is hardly necessary to mention, that the very terms of the context here necessitate the understanding this<i> offering</i> of the death of Christ,—not as in ver. 25, where the context, as there insisted, confines it to His offering of Himself to God in the heavenly sanctuary)<b> to bear the sins of many</b> (a plain allusion to Isa. liii. 12: and here, as there, importing the<i> “bearing,” “carrying on Himself;”</i> see also Lev. xxiv. 15, “Whosoever curseth his God shall<i> bear</i> his sin:” Numb. v. 31, “The woman shall<i> bear</i> her iniquity;” xiv. 34, “Each day for a year shall<i> ye bear</i> your iniquities, even forty years.” And so in ver. 33, “shall bear Your whoredoms.” On<b> many</b>, and its supposed contrast to<i> all</i>, see above, ch. ii. 10, and Schlichting’s true distinction, “<b>Many</b> is opposed here, not to<i> all</i>, but to<i> few</i>.”<b> Many</b> is, as Delitzsch says, the qualitative designation of<i> all: all men</i> are<i> many</i> in number. There is reference in it to<i> “once for all:”</i> He was offered, One, for all: and once for all),<b> shall appear</b> (the usual verb of the appearances of Christ after his resurrection)<b> a second time without</b> (separate from)<b> sin</b> (in order to understand this, we must remember what it is that the Writer is proving: viz. that Christ’s death, the repetition of which would be the condition of a repeated offering of Himself in heaven to God, admits of no such repetition. It was a death in which He bore the sins of many—but He shall appear the second time with no sin upon Him, and consequently the whole work of atonement done and accomplished by that first offering. So that there is no need of any far-fetched explanation, either of<i> sin</i>, or of<i> without sin</i>. At His first appearance in the world He came<i> with sin</i>, not<i> in</i> him, but<i> on</i> him: He was<i> made to be sin</i>: but this sin has been once for all taken away by his bearing it as our Sacrifice: and at his second appearance He shall appear<i> without</i>, having done with, separate from,<i> sin</i>),<b> to them that wait for Him,—unto</b> (to bring in: for the purpose of)<b> salvation</b> (these last words belong to<b> shall appear</b>, not, to<i> them that wait for Him</i>. The object of Christ’s second appearance shall be, to bring in salvation; this is the bright and Christian side of His appearing, the side which we, who ought to be<i> waiting for Him</i>, should ever look upon).
