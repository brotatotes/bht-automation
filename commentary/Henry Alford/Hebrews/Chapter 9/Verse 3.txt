<b> 3.] But</b> (as bringing out by anticipation the same contrast which we have in vv. 6, 7)<b> after</b> (i. e. in entering:<i> “behind,”</i> as we should say, if regarding it ‘in situ’)<b> the second veil</b> (or curtain hanging before the sanctuary. There were in reality two of these, as described in Exod. xxvi. 31–37: one before the holy of holies itself [vv. 31–35], the other before the tabernacle door [vv. 36, 37]) the (not<i> “a,”</i> see above)<b> tabernacle which is called holy of holies</b> (literally<b> holies</b>);<b> having</b> (see below)<b> a golden censer</b> [or,<b> altar of incense</b>] (there is considerable difficulty here. The word used may mean either an<i> altar upon which</i>, or a<i> censer in which</i>, incense was burnt. On the side of the latter meaning it is remarkable, that much stress is laid by the Mischna upon the<i> censer to be used on the day of expiation</i>, as distinguished from that used on any other day: on the fact of its being<i> of gold</i>, and of a particular and precious kind of gold. But if this latter interpretation be adopted, we are involved in the following difficulty. This<i> golden censer</i> is nowhere named in the law: the word rendered “<i>censer</i>” by A.V. in Levit. xvi. 12, is a shallow basin, in which the high priest on the day of atonement was to take incense from the incense-altar into the holy place. Besides which, it is not specified as golden; nor was it kept in the Holy of holies. Indeed it could not have been, or the high priest would have been obliged to fetch it from thence before burning in-cense in it, which is most improbable. Of these, the first-mentioned objection is not decisive; for our Writer is speaking, not of Mosaic usage only, but of several things outside the provisions of the law itself; and thus our explanation of any difficulty need not be sought in the provisions of the law only, but also in subsequent Jewish usage. If now, influenced by the above difficulties, we adopt the interpretation “<i>altar of incense</i>,” a difficulty arises, certainly not less than any of those adduced above. On the one hand the word<b> having</b> at first sight seems to admit of no other meaning than a local one, “<i>containing</i>.” The parallelism with<b> wherein was</b> above appears to demand this, and the fact that the other things mentioned are beyond question intended to be<i> in</i>, not merely belonging to, the Holy of holies. On this, see more below. Taking it as our first impression, we are startled by the fact, that the altar of incense<i> was not in</i> the Holy of holies, but<i> outside it.</i> Hence Bleck, De Wette, and Lünemann, suppose that the Writer has fallen into a mistake, and Bleek infers from this that he was not an inhabitant of Palestine, but an Alexandrine. But as Delitzsch observes, whichever he were, he must have been perfect monster of ignorance, to have fallen into any such error. “Then,” continues Delitzseh, “since we cannot submit him to such an imputation, is there any intent which our Writer may have had, inducing him to ascribe the altar of incense to the Holy of holies, notwithstanding that he knew its local situation to be in the Holy eP” There is such an intent, recognized even by Bleek himself: “The Author,” says Bleek, and after him Tholuck, “treats the Holy of holies, irrespective of the veil, as symbolical of the heavenly sanctuary, and had also a motive to include in it the altar of incense, whose offerings of incense are the symbol of the prayers of the saints, Rev. viii. 3 ff.” And even so it is. Not only the New Test. writings, but the Old Test. also, Isa. vi. 6, speak of a heavenly altar, which is the antitype there of the earthly. Considering the fact that this antitypical altar belonged to the Holy of holies, into which Christ entered through the torn veil, it was obvious for our Writer to reckon the typical altar also among the things belonging to the Holy of holies. Our second question then whether our Writer is justified, having this motive, in reckoning the altar of incense among the furniture of the Holy of holies. And our answer is, Entirely so: the following considerations have weight: a) that the altar of incense, by Exod. xxx. 6, xl. 5, is to be placed before the ark of the covenant, or before the Capporeth [mercy-seat], ie. in the middle between the candlestick on the right and the table of shewbread on the left, so that its place is subordinate to the ark of the covenant: b) that on the day of atonement, it, as wall as the mercy-seat, was sprinkled with the blood of the sin-offering: c) that 1 Kings vi. 22, as well as by our Writer, it is reckoned to the Holy of holies, being there culled the altar belonging to the sanctuary [A, V.<i> “the altar that was by the oracle”</i>). The solution to be gathered from this would be, that the altar of incense, being appointed by the Mosaic ordinance to stand in immediate contiguity to the veil separating the Holy of holies, and being destined in its use especially for the service of the Holy of Holies [for this, notwithstanding the objection brought by Delitzsch, might have weight; the exterior altar of burnt-offering did not belong in any such strict sense to the sanctuary and mercy-seat], and being described in more than one place of Scripture [e. g. Exod. xxx. 6; 1 Kings vi. 22] as connected with the sanctuary, is taken by the Writer as appertaining to the Holy of holies: he choosing, thus to describe it, the somewhat ambiguous word<b> having</b>, and not<i> “wherein was,”</i> as before. I have thus given both views of the solution to be sought: and will now state the result. 1) On either hypothesis,<b> having</b> cannot be kept to its stricter meaning of<i> containing</i>. For neither the censer nor the incense-altar was<i> kept in</i> the Holy of holies. 2) The language of the Mischna concerning the golden censer is very strong, and more weight still is given to it when we reflect that it is especially of the day of expiation that our Writer is preparing to speak. 3) The word<b> golden</b> should not be overlooked in the consideration. When the ark of the covenant by and by is spoken of, which like the altar of incense was overlaid with gold, it is not said to be<i> golden</i>, but only<i> “overlaid all round with gold.”</i> And this predicate being thus emphatically thrown forward, it is hardly possible to help feeling that a stress is laid on it, and it is not used without design. And if we enquire what this design is, we can hardly find fault with the reply which says that it is to distinguish a<i> golden censer</i> from some other kinds of censers. 4) On the whole then I should say that the balance inclines towards the “censer” interpretation, though I do not feel by any means that the difficulty is removed, and should hail any new solution which might clear it still further),<b> and the ark of the covenant</b> (see Exod. xxv. 10 ff., xxxvii. 1 ff.: called by this name, Josh. iii. 6 and in other places)<b> covered round on all sides</b> (<i> “within and without,”</i> Exod. xxv. 11)<b> with gold</b> (the ark, a chest, was of shittim [acacia] wood, overlaid with plates of fine gold, Exod. as above. The ark of the covenant was in the Holy of holies in the Mosaic tabernacle, and in the temple of Solomon, 1 Kings viii. 4, 6. In the sack by the Chaldeans, it disappeared. See a legend respecting its fate in 2 Macc. ii, 1–8, where curiously enough “the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense,” are classed together. The second temple did not contain it, but it was represented by a stone basement three fingers high, called “the stone of foundation”),<b> in which</b> [<b>was</b>]<b> a golden pot</b> (Ex. xvi. 32–34. The word<i> “golden”</i> is added by the Septuagint: so also Philo: the Hetrew has merely “a pot,” as A.V.)<b> containing the manna</b> (viz. an omer, each man's daily share laid up for a memorial, see Exod. xvi. 32 with ib. 16. That this pot was to be placed<i> in the ark</i>, is not said there, but it was gathered probably from the words “before the Lord.” In 1 Kings viii. 9; 2 Chron. v. 10, it is stated that there was nothing in the ark in Solomon’s temple, except the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb. But this, as Delitzsch observes, will not prove any thing against the pot of manna and the rod having<i> once</i> been there; nay rather, from the express declaration that there was<i> then</i> nothing but the tables of stone, it would seem that formerly there had been other things there. The Rabbis certainly treat of the pot of manna, as of the rod, as<i> being in the ark</i>),<b> and the rod of Aaron which budded</b> (see Numb. xvii. 1–11. It was to be laid up “before the testimony,” in which Ben Gershom sees a proof that it was in the ark. The Gemara mentions a tradition that with the ark disappeared the pot of manna, and the cruse of anointing oil, and the rod of Aaron with its almonds and blossoms, and the chest which the Philistines sent for a trespass-offering, 1 Sam. vi. 4, 8),<b> and the tables of the covenant</b> (viz. the tables of stone on which the ten commandments were written by the finger of God, Exod. xxv. 16, xxxi. 18; Deut. x. 1–5; 1 Kings viii. 9; 2 Chron. v. 10, as above. It will he seen from these references, that these tables were ordered to be put in the ark);
