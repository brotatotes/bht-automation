<b> 8.] the Holy Spirit signifying</b> (by the typical arrangement of the sanctuary, excluding all from it except the High Priest once a year: the reference of<i> “signifying”</i> is not to be referred back to the prophecy of Jeremiah above quoted. We often have the verb in this meaning of<i> “signifying by a representation:”</i> so in ch. xii. 27)<b> this</b> (which follows),<b> that the way to the holy place</b> (i. e. the true holy places in heaven: for is of antitype, not of type, that the Writer is here speaking. Hence there is no danger of mistaking<i> the holy place</i> here for the outer tabernacle: it is as in Ezek. xli. 23; Lev. xvi. 16, 17, 20, 23, 27,<i> the holy place</i>, par excellence)<b> has not yet been manifested</b> (not,<i> had</i> not: the present form is maintained throughout: see below),<b> while the first tabernacle is as yet standing</b> (<i>what first tabernacle?</i> That which was first in<i> time</i>, or<i> first in order of space?</i> Clearly the latter, which has already been used in ver. 6: no reason can be given for changing the sense to the temporal one, especially as the Writer is regarding the whole as present, and drawing no contrast as to time. In fact, if time be regarded, the<i> heavenly</i>, not the earthly tabernacle is the first. Still less can we understand the tabernacle in the wilderness, as distinguished from the temple: which would yield no assignable sense. Bleek supposes that<i> the first tabernacle,</i> thus understood, symbolizes the whole Jewish Levitical worship which took place in the first or outer tabernacle: Ebrard, that the whole, exterior and interior tabernacle, is symbolical, the exterior of relative, the interior of absolute holiness. But both of these ideas are well refuted by Delitzsch, who reminds us that the first as well as the second tabernacle was symbolical of heavenly things):<b> the which</b> (viz. the first or anterior tabernacle, and that especially considered as obstructing, by its yet remaining, the way into the holiest)<b> is</b> (not,<i> “was,”</i> see above)<b> a parable for</b> (in reference to)<b> the time</b> (period, or season, with reference to the divine dispensations)<b> now present</b> (so Primasius,— “for what was then done in the temple, was a figure and similitude of that truth which is now fulfilled in the church.” And thus recently, and to my mind decisively, Delitzsch. But observe, the first tabernacle was not a parable<i> of</i> the present time, so that<i> the present time</i> should be the thing represented:—but<b> a</b> parable—<i>for</i>, reserved unto, or given in reference to, the present time,—of heavenly things, to which the access is in the present time revealed.
