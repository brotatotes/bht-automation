<b> 8.] the Holy Spirit signifying</b> (by the typical arrangement of the sanctuary, excluding all from it except the High Priest once a year: the reference of<i> “signifying”</i> is not to be referred back to the prophecy of Jeremiah above quoted. We often have the verb in this meaning of<i> “signifying by a representation:”</i> so in ch. xii. 27)<b> this</b> (which follows),<b> that the way to the holy place</b> (i. e. the true holy places in heaven: for is of antitype, not of type, that the Writer is here speaking. Hence there is no danger of mistaking<i> the holy place</i> here for the outer tabernacle: it is as in Ezek. xli. 23; Lev. xvi. 16, 17, 20, 23, 27,<i> the holy place</i>, par excellence)<b> has not yet been manifested</b> (not,<i> had</i> not: the present form is maintained throughout: see below),<b> while the first tabernacle is as yet standing</b> (<i>what first tabernacle?</i> That which was first in<i> time</i>, or<i> first in order of space?</i> Clearly the latter, which has already been used in ver. 6: no reason can be given for changing the sense to the temporal one, especially as the Writer is regarding the whole as present, and drawing no contrast as to time. In fact, if time be regarded, the<i> heavenly</i>, not the earthly tabernacle is the first. Still less can we understand the tabernacle in the wilderness, as distinguished from the temple: which would yield no assignable sense. Bleek supposes that<i> the first tabernacle,</i> thus understood, symbolizes the whole Jewish Levitical worship which took place in the first or outer tabernacle: Ebrard, that the whole, exterior and interior tabernacle, is symbolical, the exterior of relative, the interior of absolute holiness. But both of these ideas are well refuted by Delitzsch, who reminds us that the first as well as the second tabernacle was symbolical of heavenly things):<b> the which</b> (viz. the first or anterior tabernacle, and that especially considered as obstructing, by its yet remaining, the way into the holiest)<b> is</b> (not,<i> “was,”</i> see above)<b> a parable for</b> (in reference to)<b> the time</b> (period, or season, with reference to the divine dispensations)<b> now present</b> (so Primasius,— “for what was then done in the temple, was a figure and similitude of that truth which is now fulfilled in the church.” And thus recently, and to my mind decisively, Delitzsch. But observe, the first tabernacle was not a parable<i> of</i> the present time, so that<i> the present time</i> should be the thing represented:—but<b> a</b> parable—<i>for</i>, reserved unto, or given in reference to, the present time,—of heavenly things, to which the access is in the present time revealed.<br><br> This application of the expression to<i> the time now present</i>, has not been the general view of Commentators. Chrysostom and others have interpreted it of the time<i> then</i> present, the time before the coming of Christ. But this meaning,<i> “the time which was instant,”</i> would not agree with the present tense,<b> are offered,</b> to which consequently those interpreters are obliged to do violence. Accordingly we have modifications of this view, e.g. that of Ebrard, and others, that the time meant is the present time of offering Old Test. sacrifices, in which the readers of the Epistle were still taking a part. “The author might have called the time of the Old Test. worship ‘the past time,’ and he would doubtless have so called it, had he been minded to speak from his own standing-point: but with practical wisdom he here speaks from that of his readers, who yet joined in the temple worship, and for whom the period of sacrifices was not yet passed away.” Ebrard:—that of Bleek, Tholuck, and Lünemann, “This<i> first tabernacle</i> is, or there lies in its establishment, a parabolic setting forth of the character of the present time in general, i.e. of the time of the Old Test.,—of Judaism.” Bleek. And so A.V., “which was a figure for the time then present.” See more below under<i> “the time of reformation”</i>);<b> according to which</b> (i. e.<i> in accordance with which typical meaning;</i> a specification accounting for and justifying the profitless character of the ordinances about to be spoken of)<b> both gifts and sacrifices are offered</b> (the<i> present</i> implies only the matter-of-fact endurance of the Levitical offerings, not their subsistence in the divine plan),<b> having no power to perfect in conscience</b> (see below)<b> him that serveth</b> (i. e. not the priests, but the people, who offered through them. “The offering Israelite assures,—doing, as he does, that which God’s law requires,—his part, as a member, in the people of the law and of the promised salvation: he obtains also, if he does this with right feeling, operations of divine grace, which he seeks in the way prescribed: but, seeing that the Holy of holies is not yet unveiled, the offerings cannot perfect him<i> in conscience</i>, i.e. cannot put his moral-religions consciousness, in its inward feeling, into a state of entire and joyful looking for of salvation, so that his<i> conscience</i> should be an onward-waxing consciousness of perfect restoration, of entire clearing up, of total emancipation, of his relation to God.” Delituseh: who continues, “The material offerings of animals are only parables, referring to the time when that which is parabolically set forth becomes actual, and passes into reality. They are, considered of themselves, incapable of any action on the inner part of a man; they are”);
