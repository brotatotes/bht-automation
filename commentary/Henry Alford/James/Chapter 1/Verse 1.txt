<b> CHAP. I. 1.]</b> ADDRESS AND GREETING.<b> James</b> (for all questions who the Author of this Epistle was, see the Introduction. I assume here that which I have there endeavoured to establish, that it is “James the Lord’s brother,” the first president or bishop of the church at Jerusalem, an Apostle, but not one of the Twelve),<b> servant</b> (not necessarily, as Huther, an official appellation; but implying, as he also confesses, devotion to God and His work alone, irrespectively of self-will or other men’s will)<b> of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ</b> (not “<i>of the God and Lord, J.C.,</i>” but, as Œcumenius, “by<b> God</b>, he means the Father: by<b> Lord</b>, the Son.” Huther remarks, that in all the addresses of Epistles, the whole name<i> Jesus Christ</i> is given. St. James mentions our Lord only here and ch. ii. 1 in this Epistle, and not at all in his speeches in Acts xv. and xxi. Bengel says, “It might have seemed, if he had often named Jesus, as if he did it to exalt himself as the brother of our Lord. For that very reason, he ‘knew Christ according to the flesh’ less than others”),<b> to the twelve tribes</b> (of Israel: nor can there be any reasonable doubt that this Epistle was addressed to Jewish Christians in the first place. Not however to them, as distinguished from Gentile Christians: for the two classes appear to have<br><br> been not as yet distinct. If the later date of the Epistle be taken [see Introd.], then the Jewish Christians are addressed as the nucleus and kernel of all Christendom. But to my mind, the former is more probable)<b> which are in the dispersion</b> (the most likely reference of this word is to the literal and actual Jewish dispersion: and the Epistle must be considered as addressed, from the head of the mother church in Jerusalem, to the Jewish believers, residing among the dispersed tribes of Israel),<b> greeting</b> (the formula thus rendered is not found in the address of any other apostolical Epistle; but it occurs in the Epistle drawn up under the direction of James to the Gentile churches in Acts xv. 23).
