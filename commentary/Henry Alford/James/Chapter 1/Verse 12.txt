<b> 12.</b>] We now return to the suffering and tempted Christian, who has his<i> blessedness</i>, and a possession more precious and more sure than worldly wealth.<b> Blessed is the man who endureth</b> (the emphasis is on this verb, which distinguishes this saying from that in ver. 2; it is not the mere<i> falling among temptations,</i> but the<b> enduring</b><i> temptation</i>, which is felicitated)<b> temptation: because when he has become approved</b> (by the trial: when he has undergone the<i> proof</i> ver. 2)<b> he shall receive the crown of life (of life</b> is genitive of apposition: the crown<i> is</i> life eternal. No image derived from<i> athletes</i> must be thought of in the verse, as is done by many: such an image would be foreign to the ideas of Jews, with whom the receiving a crown from God was a familiar image, irrespective of any previous contest for a prize: see Ps. xxi. 3; Wisd. v. 16, “<i>They shall receive the kingdom of glory and the diadem of beauty from the hand of the Lord</i>”),<b> which He promised to them that love Him</b> (<i>who</i> promised it, is understood: God, repeatedly, in substance: whenever a kingdom is foretold as the future inheritance of His people:<b> to them that love Him</b>, 2 Tim. iv. 8; and the same words again in ch. ii. 5. It is a formula frequently occurring in the law and the prophets: compare Exod. xx. 6; Deut. vii. 9; Judg. v. 31; Neh. i. 5; Ps. v. 11, exliv. 20; Dan. ix. 4; Ecclus. xxxi. [xxxiv.] 16, xlvii. 22).
