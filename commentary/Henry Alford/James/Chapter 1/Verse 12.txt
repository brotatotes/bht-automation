 12 .] We now return to the suffering and tempted Christian, who has his μακαρισμός , and a possession more precious and more sure than worldly wealth.  Blessed is the man (no stress on ἀνήρ , cf. James 1:7-8 ; Jam 1:20 )  who endureth (the emphasis is on ὑπομένει , which distinguishes this saying from that in James 1:2 ; it is not the mere περιπεσεῖν πειρασμοῖς , but the ὑπομένειν πειρασμόν , which is felicitated. There is no reason to read ὑπομενεῖ , as Bengel. The blessing is categorical, and as well expressed by the present as by the future)  temptation: because when he has become approved (by the trial: when he has undergone the δοκίμιον , James 1:2 . This δόκιμος γενόμενος , as connected with that verse, furnishes some support to the reading which omits τῆς πίστεως there. The δοκίμιον is of himself, and it is he that becomes δόκιμος by it)  he shall receive the crown of life (  τῆς ζωῆς is gen. of apposition: the crown  is life eternal:  τῆς ζωῆς , ‘vitæ illius,’ of that life of which we know, which is glorious and eternal. No image derived from  athletes must be thought of in the verse, as is done by many: such an image would be foreign to the ideas of Jews, with whom the receiving a crown from God was a familiar image, irrespective of any previous contest for a prize: cf. Psalms 21:3 ; Wis 5:16 , λήψονται τὸ βασίλειον τῆς εὐπρεπείας καὶ τὸ διάδημα τοῦ κάλλους ἐκ χειρὸς κυρίου ),  which He promised to them that love Him (  who promised it, is understood: God, repeatedly, in substance: whenever a kingdom is foretold as the future inheritance of His people: τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν , cf. 2 Timothy 4:8 , and the same words again in ch. James 2:5 . It is a formula frequently occurring in the law and the Prophets: cf. Exodus 20:6 ; Deuteronomy 7:9 ; Judges 5:31 ; Nehemiah 1:5 ; Psalms 5:11 ; 144:20: Daniel 9:4 ; Sir 31:16 ( Sir 34:16 ) ; Sir 47:22 ).
