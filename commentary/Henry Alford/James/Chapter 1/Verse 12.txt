<p><strong> 12</strong> .] We now return to the suffering and tempted Christian, who has his μακαρισμός , and a possession more precious and more sure than worldly wealth. <strong> Blessed is the man</strong> (no stress on ἀνήρ , cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:7-8">James 1:7-8</span> ; Jam 1:20 ) <strong> who endureth</strong> (the emphasis is on ὑπομένει , which distinguishes this saying from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span> ; it is not the mere περιπεσεῖν πειρασμοῖς , but the ὑπομένειν πειρασμόν , which is felicitated. There is no reason to read ὑπομενεῖ , as Bengel. The blessing is categorical, and as well expressed by the present as by the future) <strong> temptation: because when he has become approved</strong> (by the trial: when he has undergone the δοκίμιον , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span> . This δόκιμος γενόμενος , as connected with that verse, furnishes some support to the reading which omits τῆς πίστεως there. The δοκίμιον is of himself, and it is he that becomes δόκιμος by it) <strong> he shall receive the crown of life (</strong> <strong> τῆς ζωῆς</strong> is gen. of apposition: the crown <em> is</em> life eternal: <strong> τῆς</strong> ζωῆς , ‘vitæ illius,’ of that life of which we know, which is glorious and eternal. No image derived from <em> athletes</em> must be thought of in the verse, as is done by many: such an image would be foreign to the ideas of Jews, with whom the receiving a crown from God was a familiar image, irrespective of any previous contest for a prize: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+21:3">Psalms 21:3</span> ; Wis 5:16 , λήψονται τὸ βασίλειον τῆς εὐπρεπείας καὶ τὸ διάδημα τοῦ κάλλους ἐκ χειρὸς κυρίου ), <strong> which He promised to them that love Him</strong> ( <em> who</em> promised it, is understood: God, repeatedly, in substance: whenever a kingdom is foretold as the future inheritance of His people: τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν , cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span> , and the same words again in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:5">James 2:5</span> . It is a formula frequently occurring in the law and the Prophets: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:6">Exodus 20:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+7:9">Deuteronomy 7:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jdg+5:31">Judges 5:31</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ne+1:5">Nehemiah 1:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+5:11">Psalms 5:11</span> ; 144:20: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+9:4">Daniel 9:4</span> ; Sir 31:16 ( Sir 34:16 ) ; Sir 47:22 ).</p>
