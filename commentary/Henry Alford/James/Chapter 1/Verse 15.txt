<b> 15.</b>]<b> then lust having conceived, bringeth forth sin: and sin, when completed, bringeth forth death</b> (it has been questioned whether<b> sin</b> is here in one, or in two senses. De Wette holds that the first<b> sin</b> is the purpose, or inner act, of sin,—the<i> completion</i>, carrying this<i> sin</i> out into an act, which act brings forth death, the wages of sin. But this is decidedly wrong. Wiesinger has disputed it, and insisted rightly that the<i> inner act</i> is the union of the will with the<i> lust</i>, the “<i>bringing forth</i>” denoting extrusion into outward act: then the second<i> sin</i>,—which Huther rightly maintains to be the sinful act when brought to perfection in all its consequences, in a series of results following on one another and bringing a man under bondage to his sin,—being thus perfected, brings forth eternal death. The imagery is throughout consistent. The harlot<b> lust draws away</b> and<b> entices</b> the man: the guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress: the consequence is that she<b> conceives sin</b>, sin, in general, of some kind, of that kind to which the temptation inclines: then [so literally],<b> the sin</b>, that particular sin, when grown up and mature, herself<b> bringeth forth</b>, as if all along pregnant with it, Death, the final result of sin. So that<i> temptation to sin</i> cannot be from God, while<i> trial</i> is from Him. The one, being our proof, works endurance, and endurance, when she has a perfect work, life: the other, being a bait and excitement arising from lust, “brings forth sin, and sin being completed, brings forth<b> death.</b>” The English reader will not fail to remember Milton’s sublime allegory in Paradise Lost, where Satan, by his own evil lust, brings forth sin: and then by an incestuous union with Sin [which doubtless may be said to lie here also in the background, no canse being assigned for the<i> conception</i>] causes her to bring forth Death).
