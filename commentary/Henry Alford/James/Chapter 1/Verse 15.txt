<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <strong> then lust having conceived, bringeth forth sin: and</strong> ( <strong> δέ</strong> brings out the new subject) <strong> sin, when completed, bringeth forth death</strong> (it has been questioned whether <strong> ἁμαρτία</strong> is here in one, or in two senses. De Wette holds that the first ἁμαρτία is the purpose, or inner act, of sin, the <strong> ἀποτελεσθεῖσα</strong> carrying this ἁμαρτία out into an act, which act brings forth death, the wages of sin. But this is decidedly wrong. Wiesinger has disputed it, and insisted rightly that the <em> inner act</em> is the union of the will with the ἐπιθυμία , the <strong> τίκτει</strong> denoting extrusion into outward act: then the second ἁμαρτία , which Huther rightly maintains to be, not as Wiesinger, after Calvin, “cursus peccandi completus,” but the sinful act when brought to perfection in all its consequences, in a series of results following on one another and bringing a man under bondage to his sin, being thus perfected, brings forth eternal death. The imagery is throughout consistent. The harlot ἐπιθυμία , ἐξέλκει and δελεάζει the man: the guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress: the consequence is that she τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν , sin, in general, of some kind, of that kind to which the temptation inclines: then, <strong> ἡ</strong> ἁμαρτία , that particular sin, when grown up and mature, herself ἀποκύει , ‘extrudit,’ as if all along pregnant with it, Death, the final result of sin. So that temptation to sin cannot be from God, while trial is from Him. The one, being δοκίμιον ἡμῶν , κατεργάζεται ὑπομονήν · ἡ δὲ ὑπομονή , ἔργον τέλειον ἔχουσα , <strong> τὴν ζωήν</strong> : the other, being ἐξέλκυσις κ . δέλεαρ arising from ἐπιθυμία , τίκτει ἁμαρτίαν · ἡ δὲ ἁμαρτία ἀποτελεσθεῖσα ἀποκύει <strong> θάνατον</strong> . The English reader will not fail to remember Milton’s sublime allegory in Paradise Lost, where Satan, by his own evil lust, brings forth sin: and then by an incestuous union with Sin (which doubtless may be said to lie here also in the background, no cause being assigned for the ἀποκύει ) causes her to bring forth Death. As regards the single expressions, <strong> συλλαβοῦσα τίκτει</strong> is a regular LXX formula for וַתַּהַר וַתֵּלֶד : cf. reff. Gen., also Gen 30:17 al. fr. <strong> ἀποκύειν</strong> , or ἀποκυεῖν (either is allowable, see Winer, § 15) is found principally in later Greek: Wetst. gives examples from Maximus Tyr., Herodian, Lucian, Phlegon, all with this meaning.
