<p><strong> 20</strong> .] <strong> for the wrath</strong> (any wrath, all wrath) <strong> of man</strong> ( <strong> ἀνήρ</strong> is used by our Apostle without any such definite precision as has been supposed here by Bengel, “ <em> Sexus virilis</em> maxime iram alit:” or Thomus, “Non dicit <em> pueri</em> , quæ cito transit.” Cf. ἀνὴρ δίψυχος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:8">James 1:8</span> , and reff.) <strong> worketh not</strong> ( <strong> ἐργάζεται</strong> and <strong> κατ</strong> εργάζεται would differ here slightly in sense: the latter would signify more ‘worketh out,’ ‘bringeth to issue or existence,’ the former, ‘practiseth,’ ‘worketh habitually,’ and each of these would throw its own shade of meaning on δικαιοσύνη see below) <strong> the righteousness of God</strong> (if ἐργάζεται , = that which is righteousness in God’s sight = τὸ δίκαιον ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ : if κατεργάζεται , = that righteousness, to produce which is God’s end in begetting us to a new life. In other words, the more general ethical sense is given by ἐργάζεται : the more particular theological one by κατεργάζεται . At all events, we must not interpret δικ . θεοῦ the state of righteousness before God, as some, or that righteousness <em> in another</em> , into which God begets men by his word of truth, as Hofmann (Schriftb. 1. 548 f.) and Wiesinger. When this latter asks, What relevance here has the remark that anger doeth not that which is right in the sight of God? an easy answer can be given. Be not intemperately zealous, hastily rash to speak and to be angered, even in God’s behalf (for this is implied): be humble, ready to listen, for your angry zeal, your quick speaking, work not God’s righteous purposes serve not Him, are not carriers forward of that righteousness which is the characteristic of His kingdom, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:18">James 3:18</span> . How many an endeavour, which might have ended in ἐργάζεσθαι δικαιοσύνην θεοῦ , has been diverted and blighted by hasty speaking and anger, and ended only in disgracing ourselves, and Him whom we would have served, before men! So Bengel, “Ira plane impedit justitiam Dei; tametsi sibi dum fervet, quam maxime operari eam videatur. Purius sine ira fit”).</p>
