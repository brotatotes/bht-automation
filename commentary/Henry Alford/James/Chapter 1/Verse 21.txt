<b> 21.]</b><b> Wherefore</b> (consequence from ver. 20: seeing that<i> wrath</i> excludes you from having a share in the righteous work of God)<b> putting off</b> (it must be done as a single act, antecedently to that which follows. The previous putting off is the condition of the subsequent reception)<b> all filthiness</b> (here figurative, as Rev. xxii. 11. Some Commentators take it here as standing alone: others join it with<i> and superabundance,</i> as belonging to the genitive “<i>of malignity;</i>” and this seems better for the context, which concerns not the putting away of moral pollution of all kinds, but only of that kind which belongs to<i> malignity:</i> see below. And, thus taken, it will mean that<i> malignity</i> pollutes the soul, and renders it unfit to receive the<i> implanted word</i>. It is very possible that the agricultural similitude in the word<b> implanted</b> may have influenced the choice of both these words,<i> filthiness</i> and<i> superabundance.</i> The ground must be ridded of all that pollutes and chokes it, before the seed can sink in and come to maturity; must be cleaned and cleared) and abundance ( ‘<i>superfluity</i>’ is perhaps too strong: it is, if the above figure be allowed, the rank growth, the abundant crop)<b> of malignity</b> (evil disposition towards one another. ‘The word carries on the “<i>wrath</i>” above: which springs from<i> malignity</i>, evil disposition, which is inherent in our hearts, and requires putting off before we can receive the word of God. That this is so, is evident from the recommendation of<i> mildness</i> which follows. However the exhortation may apply in the wider sense, it is not its sense here, as the context plainly shews),<b> in mildness</b> (towards one another)<b> receive</b> (so Mark iv. 20, of the good ground)<b> the implanted word</b> (the word spoken of is beyond doubt the same as the<i> word of truth</i> above—i. e. the Gospel, in its fulness. Bat the epithet makes some little difficulty. First of all, it clearly is not, as Œcumenius seems to take it, ‘innate:’ for this would stultify the command to<i> receive</i> it, we having it already. Nor can it mean “the word which has been planted in the whole of Christendom,” seeing that individuals are here being dealt with: but the allusion is apparently to the parable of the sower, and it is the word implanted [equivalent to which has been sown], the word whose attribute and<i> virtue</i> is to be<i> implanted</i>, and which is<i> implanted</i>, awaiting your reception of it to spring up and take up your being into it and make you new plants)<b> which is able to save your souls</b> (so Rom. i. 16, where the<i> Gospel</i> is said to be<i> the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.</i> Observe “<i>your</i> souls.” It is the<i> soul</i> which carries the personality of the man: which is between the<i> spirit</i> drawing it upwards, and the<i> flesh</i> drawing it downwards, and is saved or lost, passes into life or death, according to the choice between these two. And the<i> implanted word</i>, working through the<i> spirit</i>, and by the divine Spirit, is a spiritual agency, able to save the<i> soul</i>,—to complete the work, and to have done it for ever).
