 22 .] The  ταχὺς εἰς τὸ ἀκοῦσαι and  δέξασθε are qualified, at the same time that they are enforced, by a caution.  But be ye (not, ‘  become ye ,’ any more than in Matthew 6:16 ; Matthew 10:16 ; Matthew 24:44 ; John 20:27 ; Romans 12:16 . In all these places no other meaning will suit the context but simply “  be ye :” with reference indeed to some future act by which the word γίνεσθαι gets its propriety; but ‘become’ in English carries a very different meaning, viz. that of  change into the state mentioned from some other previous one, which is in none of these cases implied)  doers of the word (viz. of the λόγος ἔμφυτος , the λόγος τῆς ἀληθείας . Theile remarks well, “Substantiva plus sonant quam participia;” the substantive ποιητής carries an enduring, a sort of official force with it: ‘let this be your occupation.’ For the expression, see reff.),  not hearers only (  ἀκροατής in classical Greek carries rather the idea of attentive observance with it, which cannot be the case either here or in ref. Rom.),  deceiving yourselves (see note on ref. Col.  παραλογίζεσθαι is used here probably as allusive to λόγος , and means, to deceive by a false logical conclusion. The ‘hearer only’ does this, when he infers that the mere sound of the word received in his outward ear will suffice for him. Cf. ἀπατῶν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ , James 1:26 . Hesych. gives ἀπάτη λογισμοῦ as the explanation of παραλογισμός . See Suicer, sub voce).
