Strictly, it is ‘if any one is a hearer, and a not-doer’) <strong> a doer, this man</strong> (the demonstrative pronoun points more markedly at the individual in whom the hearing and not-doing are united: see reff.) <strong> is like to a man</strong> ( <strong> ἀνδρί</strong> general again: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:8">James 1:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span> , &amp;c. Huther quotes a curious comment from Paes: “Viri obiter tantum solent specula intueri, muliebre autem est curiose se ad speculum componere”) <strong> contemplating</strong> (reff. Probably the example was meant to have a general reference: for though it may be true, as De Wette says, that many men remember well their appearance in the mirror, the common rule is that men forget it.

Whether the gen. <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> (not αὑτοῦ ) belongs to πρόσωπον or to τῆς γενέσεως , is uncertain as the words stand: more probably however to the latter: cf. τοῦ υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ , Col 1:13 ) <strong> in a mirror</strong> (see reff.: and Pind. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ne+7:20">Nehemiah 7:20</span> ):</p>
