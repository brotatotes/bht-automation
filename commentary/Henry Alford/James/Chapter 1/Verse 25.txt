<b>But he who looked into</b> (here we have the figure mingled with the reality, the comparison being dropped. Probably the verb used here, which signifies<i> to stoop and look in</i>, has reference to a mirror being placed on a table or on the ground, to contemplate which steadily, a man must put his face near to it. But we must not perhaps urge this too strictly: for in 1 Pet. i. 12, it is used of looking closely into any thing. It is here the opposite of<i> contemplating</i>: attention bestowed for a time only and then withdrawn. And this opposition is strengthened by the words which follow: see below)<b> the perfect law</b><b> which is</b> (the law)<b> of our</b> (Christian)<b> liberty</b> ( ‘<i>the perfect law,</i>” not, the gospel as contrasted with the law, nor the covenant of faith more perfect than that of legal obedience: but the rule of life as revealed in the gospel, which is perfect and perfecting, but not in contrast with the former law as being not perfect, and not able to make perfect: that distinction is not in view here: see below. The whole Epistle is founded on this perfect law of Christ, more especially on that declaration of it contained in the Sermon on the mount: see Introd. And that this law here is meant, the<i> implanted word, the word of truth</i>, as it is a rule of conduct, is evident from what follows, where<i> deeds</i>, and they only, are spoken of. It is the law of our liberty, not as in contrast with a former law of bondage, but as viewed on the side of its being the law of the new life and birth, with all its spontaneous and free development of obedience. Huther remarks, “Ever in the Old Test. the sweetness of the law was subject of praise [Ps xix. 8–11], But the life-giving power belonged to the law only in an imperfect manner, because the covenant on which it rested, was as yet only one of promise, and not of fulfilment”),<b> and remains there</b> (remains looking in, does not depart as the other. As Wiesinger remarks, the matter spoken of here is not so much observing the law in act, as observing it in attention—not letting it pass out of the thoughts. That ls to action, as below),<b> being</b> (not,<i> having become:</i> see above on ver. 22)<b> not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of work</b> (not,<i> of the work</i>, but abstract. of<i> work</i>, something which brings a result with it),<b> this man shall be blessed in his doing</b> (the words imply that even in the act there is blessing: the life of obedience is the element wherein the blessedness is found and consists).
