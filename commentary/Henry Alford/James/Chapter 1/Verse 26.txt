<b>If any man imagines that he is</b> (our A.V. ‘<i>seem fo be</i>’ is ambiguous: it may mean ‘to others,’ whereas the word really means only, ‘to himself:’ ‘thinks that he is’)<b> religious</b> (in the sense ot ‘observant of God’s outward service,’ marking the external manifestation of a religious mind. We have no word at all adequately expressing the original term),<b> not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart</b> (see above on “<i>deceiving yourselves,</i>” ver. 22: viz. by imagining such a character consistent with true religion),<b> of this man the religious service is vain</b> (idle and fruitless).
