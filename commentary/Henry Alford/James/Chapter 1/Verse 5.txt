 5.]<b> But</b> (i. e., but this perfection and entireness, this defect in nothing, will not be yet attained; and you will find, when you aim at it, that you are lacking in the very first requisite)<b> if any of you is deficient in wisdom</b> (for what is meant by wisdom here, see ch. iii. 15–17), let him ask (either supply ‘<i>it</i>,’ or take the verb absolutely, which is better: so A.V., see below)<b> from God who giveth</b> (asking and giving are put forward as belonging to us and God in the abstract, and we do not want any object, as “<i>it</i>,” or “<i>wisdom,</i>” supplied) to<b> all men simply</b> (so Rom. xii. 8, “<i>He that imparteth, with simplicity:</i>” which is perhaps better than “<i>with liberality:</i>” we must here interpret by what follows, and understand it of simply giving, and adding nothing afterwards which may take off from the graciousness of the gift)<b> and upbraideth not</b> (in what sense is rather doubtful. Many interpret it of sending away with a refusal: the word will not bear this meaning. By far the greatest part of Commentators understand it of reproaching by the recounting of benefits bestowed. But this again does not reach the full and general nature of the expression here. The real meaning here is just as in Ecclus. xx. 15, “He giveth little, and upbraideth much,” and in Ecclus. xli. 22, “After thou hast given, upbraid not,” viz. upbraiding with any kind of reproaches, as God might well do, so unworthy are we to approach Him with any request. This of course would include that other),<b> and it shall be given to him</b> (viz,<i> wisdom</i>, see 3 Kings iii. 9–12. The whole verse seems to be written in remembrance of Matt. vii. 7–12).
