<b> 6.</b>]<b> But let him ask in faith</b> (persuasion that God can and will give: see Matt. xxi. 22: and compare “<i>the prayer of faith,</i>” 15),<b> nothing doubting</b> (compare Matt. xxi, 21, from which this is evidently taken, “<i>If ye have faith, and doubt not,</i>”&c. Huther says well, “<i>Doubt</i> is not<i> unbelief</i> [Luke xxiv. 11], but includes in it the essential character of<i> unbelief:</i> while<i> faith</i> says ‘Yes,’ and<i> unbelief</i> ‘No,’<i> doubt</i> is the union of ‘Yes’ and ‘No,’ but so that ‘No’ is the weightier: it is that inward giving way which leans not to<i> faith</i>, but to<i> unbelief</i>. ‘The deep-lying ground of it is<i> pride</i>”):<b> for he that doubteth is like a wave of the sea</b> (see Eph. iv. 14 and Isa. lvii. 20)<b> driven by the wind and tossed about</b> (the word forms a synonym with the former, “<i>driven by the wind:</i>” and the use of these synonymous expressions so close to one another is again a characteristic of St. James. A good explanation of the figure is quoted by Wiesinger from Heisen: “Sometimes he is east on the shore of faith and hope, sometimes he is rolled back into the deep of distrust: now he is borne up into the height of worldly pride, now he is mingled with the lowest sands of desperation and trouble”):{7}<b>for</b> (takes up and repeats the former<b> for</b>)<b> let not that man</b> (said with a certain slight expression of contempt)<b> think that he shall receive any thing</b> (viz. of what he asks: some things, as life, food, raiment, &c., he does continually receive)<b> from the Lord</b> (i. e. as usually in this Epistle, from GOD. So ch. iv. 10, 15; v. 4, 10, 11: see at each of those places. On the other hand, “<i>the Lord,</i>” ch. v. 7, 14, 15, is used of Christ. Hofmann remarks that where the Father is not expressly distinguished from the Son by the context, the Godhead, in its unity, is to be understood by the word<b> God</b>: and the same may be said of<b> the Lord</b>).
