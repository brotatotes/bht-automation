<b> 9.]</b> The connexion appears to he this: we must not pray before God, we must not be before God, double-minded; in our trials, we shall get no heavenly wisdom, if this is so. This double-mindedness, one soul drawn upwards to God, the other drawn downwards to the world, causes nothing but instability, and cannot result in that joy which is to be<i> our</i> attitude in trial. And it arises from misapprehension of our appointed state in trial: the poor and humble forget the exceeding honour thus done to him, which ought to be to him ground of boasting, far more worthy than (see below) the rich in this world have in their riches which shall so soon fade away: whereas (ver. 12) he that is tried shall receive a crown of life from the Lord.<b> But</b> (contrasted with the<i> double-mindedness</i> above)<b> let the brother</b> (the Christian believer)<b> who is low</b> (poor and afflicted; not merely, low in station: this explanation disappears with the view that<i> the rich man</i> [below] is Christian also)<b> glory in his exaltation</b> (which he has obtained by being admitted into the fellowship of Christ’s sufferings, and which he has further in reversion in the glorious crown of life hereafter, ver. 12):<b> but the rich</b> (not the rich<i> brother,</i> nor is the rich to be understood any otherwise than in the rest of the Epistle, compare ch. ii. 6f., v. 1ff. There are difficulties either way; but on mature consideration I find those on the usual hypothesis, of the<i> rich man being also a brother</i>, insuperable. For in that case 1) a most unnatural change in the sense is necessary at “<i>because:</i>”— ‘Let the rich brother glory in his humiliation, for, or because,<i> considered merely as a rich man,</i>&c.”’ So that he is a Christian brother at first, and then a mere rich man in the next clause: 2) such a meaning will not suit the concluding words of ver. 11: which are simply predicated of<i> the rich man,</i> the subject enunciated above, and cannot with any probability be supposed to be said of him merely as regards his riches. Whereas on the other view the difficulties are no more than arise from a confessedly elliptical parallelism. After<b> the rich</b> we must supply<i> glorieth:</i> ‘let the<i> low</i> glory in his exaltation, whereas the rich ran glories in his debasement,’ compare Phil. iii. 19, “<i>whose glory is in their shame</i>”)<b> glories</b> (see above)<b> in his humiliation</b> (see Phil. iii, 19, above,—in that which is in reality his debasement, just as in the other case the lowly Christian is called on to boast in what is in reality his exaltation. Thus, and thus only, the parallelism coheres. On the ordinary view, the<i> exaltation</i> of the<i> low brother</i> is, that which is really but not apparently his exaltation, whereas the<i> humiliation</i> of the<i> rich brother</i> is that which is apparently but not really his debasement);<b> because as a flower of the grass he shall pass away.</b>
