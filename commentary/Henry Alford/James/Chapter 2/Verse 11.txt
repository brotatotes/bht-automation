<b> 11.]</b><i> Reason for this assertion:</i> the unity of the divine Author of the whole law, and of that law, as the exponent of His will: “He is one who made the whole law: those who violate His will in one thing, violate it all.” Bengel.<b> For He who said, Commit nct adultery, said</b><b> also, Commit not murder. Now if thou committest no adultery, but committest murder, thou hast become a transgressor of the law.</b> Various fanciful reasons have. been given for the selection of these two commandments: ‘because these two were punished with death,’ Baumgarten: ‘because no one had laid a charge of adultery against the readers, but the other they violated by violating the law of love,’ Wiesinger. But it is far more likely that they are alleged as the two first which regard our duty to our neighbour generally: the prohibition of adultery being put first, as in Mark x. 19; Luke xviii. 20; Rom. xiii. 9; Philo also has this order, and lays a stress on it, as shewing that adultery is the greatest of social crimes. So that this order must have been one preserved in ancient tradition: or perhaps found anciently in the Septuagint. The Rabbis have the same sentiment as this. They say of the thirty-nine precepts of Moses, “If a man do them all, but omit one, he is guilty of all and every of them.”
