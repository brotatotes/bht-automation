 11 .]  Reason for this assertion : the unity of the divine Author of the whole law, and of that law, as the exponent of His will: “Unus est, qui totam legem tulit: cujus voluntatem qui una in re violant, totam violant,” Bengel. Cf. also Aug [6] Ep. ad Hieronym. on this passage.  For He who said, Commit not adultery, said also, Commit not murder; now if thou committest no adultery (  οὐ , and not μή , because the attention is fixed on the fact of  no committal of adultery having taken place. It corresponds,  in fact , to μὴ μοιχεύσῃς above in prohibition. See Winer, § 55. 2,  c. d : and cf. ch. James 1:23 ; Jam 3:2 ; 1Co 16:22 ),  but committest murder, thou hast become a transgressor of the law . (Various fanciful reasons have been given for the selection of these two commandments: “because these two were punished with death,” Baumgarten: “because no one had laid a charge of adultery against the readers, but the other they violated by violating the law of love,” Wiesinger. But it is far more likely that they are alleged as the two first which regard our duty to our neighbour generally: μὴ μοιχεύσῃς being put first, as in Mark 10:19 ; Luke 18:20 ; Romans 13:9 ; Philo de Decalog. § 10, 12, 24, 82, vol. ii. pp. 186, 189, 201, 207, who lays a stress on this order as shewing that adultery is μέγιστον ἀδικημάτων : see also De Spec. Leg. ad 6 Esther 7:0 Dec. Cap. § 2, p. 300. So that this order must have been one preserved in ancient tradition: or perhaps found anciently in the LXX. The Rabbis have the same sentiment as this: Wolf quotes from the Talm. Sabbath, fol. lxx. 2, where R. Jochanan says of the 39 precepts of Moses, “Quod si faciat omnia, unum vero omittat, omnium et singulorum reus est.”)
