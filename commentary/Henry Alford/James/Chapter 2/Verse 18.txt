 18 .]  But (in any case of faith without works, analogous to that supposed above, of one of you having dismissed the naked and hungry with mere words)  some one will say (he will be liable to this reproach from any one who takes the more effectual and sensible method, of uniting faith with works),  Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me (not,  ‘prove to me,’ but ‘exhibit to me,’ ‘ostenta mihi’)  thy faith without the works (which ought to accompany it),  and I will shew thee my faith by (from the evidence of, out of, as the ground of the manifestation)  my works . The whole difficulty found in this verse by Commentators has arisen from overlooking the fact that it continues the argument from the previous verses, and does not begin a new portion of the subject. And the reason why this has been overlooked, is, the occurrence between the two of the general clause in James 2:17 . The same mistaken person is in the Apostle’s view throughout, down to James 2:22 ; and it is as addressed to him, on the part of a chance objector to his inconsistency, that the  ἀλλ  ʼ   ἐρεῖ τις is introduced: the  ἀλλά conveying the opposition of an objection not to the Apostle himself, but to him whom the Apostle is opposing. For the various and curious difficulties and confusions which have been raised on the verse, see Huther’s note.
