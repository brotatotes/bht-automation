<b> 22.]</b><b> Thou seest</b> (better not a question: in which case the “<i>and</i>” of ver. 23 does not follow so naturally as when we couple the direct verb<b> seest</b> with the direct verb<b> was fulfilled</b>)<b> that</b> (not,<i> how</i>, as A.V.: it is not the manner in which, nor even ‘how,’ in the sense of ‘<i>how that</i>,’ which is meant. The assertion is, that the inference indubitable, that the fact was<i> as stated</i>)<b> faith wrought</b> (at the time, ‘was working’)<b> with his works</b> (this plural again is categorical, the work in the example being but one),<b> and by</b> (<i>out of</i>, as the ground and source)<b> works</b> (again categorical; the general proposition proved by the particular case. Doubtless this second time it<i> might be</i> ‘by his works, his faith…:’ but the other is more like St. James, who is singularly given to introduce abstract propositions as applicable to particular cases)<b> faith</b> (see above)<b> was made complete</b> (in one act, once for all. The Apostle’s argument is, that faith is developed and brought to perfection by obedience: see below on yer. 26. And hence also is it evident, how faith<i> wrought with his works</i>. By the Apostle’s own comparison, ver. 26, faith is the body, obedience the spirit: faith without obedience is dead, until obedience, the spirit, sets faith in motion: then faith, like the limbs of the body, moves with and works with the acts of obedience. Which is prior in time, which the ground of the other, is a point not touched by St. James at all);<b> and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, But Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness</b> (i. e. that saying of Scripture which long preceded the offering of Isaac, received its realization, not, it may be, its only realization, but certainly its chief one, in this act of obedience. It was not, until this, fulfilled, in the sense of being entirely exemplified and filled up. Wiesinger combats this sense as an unworthy one: no such objection as that which he brings [viz. that we make thus the truth of God’s saying depend on Abraham’s subsequent conduct] lies against our view, that the saying received on, and not till this occasion, its entire and full realization. It was true, when uttered: but it became more and more gloriously true of Abraham’s life and acts till it reached this its culminating point, in his chief act of self-denying obedience):<b> and he was called</b> (couple with<i> was fulfilled</i>, not with<i> was reckoned</i>)<b> God's friend</b> (i. e. ‘<i>loved by God</i>,’ not ‘<i>loving God</i>.’ This appellation of Abrabam is not found in the Septuagint. In Gen. xviii. 17, where they have “<i>Abraham my servant</i>,” Philo cites it “<i>Abraham</i><b> my friend</b>.” And in Isa. xli. 8 the words “<i>the seed of Abraham whom I loved</i>” are rendered by the Vulgate and by the A.V. ‘the seed of Abraham my friend.’ So also in 2 Chron. xx. 7).
