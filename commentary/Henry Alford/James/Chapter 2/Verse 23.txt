<p><strong> 23</strong> .] <strong> and the Scripture was fulfilled which saith, But</strong> ( καί , LXX) <strong> Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness</strong> (i. e. that saying of Scripture, which long preceded the offering of Isaac, received its realization, not, it may be, its only realization, but certainly its chief one, in this act of obedience. It was not, until this, fulfilled, in the sense of being entirely exemplified and filled up. Wiesinger combats this sense as an unworthy one, and follows Wolf and Knapp in understanding <strong> πληρωθῆναι</strong> and <strong> τελεσθῆναι</strong> not only “cum illud ipsum quod prædictum erat evenit, sed etiam ubi tale quid accidit quo ejusmodi dicta.… quoquo modo vel confirmantur et illustrantur.” But this is not satisfactory, unless the case in point be such a prominent illustration as to constitute the main fulfilment; and then we come to much the same point. No such objection as that which Wiesinger brings (viz. that we make thus the truth of God’s saying depend on Abraham’s subsequent conduct) lies against our view, that the saying received on and not till this occasion its entire and full realization. It was true, when uttered: but it became more and more gloriously true of Abraham’s life and acts till it reached this its culminating point, in his chief act of self-denying obedience): <strong> and he was called</strong> (couple with ἐπίστευσεν not with ἐλογίσθη ) <strong> God’s friend</strong> (‘amatus a Deo,’ not ‘amans Deum.’ This appellation of Abraham is not found in the LXX. In ref. Gen., where they have Ἀβραὰμ τοῦ παιδός μου , Philo, De Resip. Noë, § 11, vol. i. p. 401, cites it Ἀβρ . τοῦ φίλου μου . And in Isa 41:8 the words σπέρμα Ἀβραὰμ ὃν ἠγάπησα are rendered by the vulg. “semen Abraham amici mei,” and by the E.V. “the seed of Abraham my friend.” So also in 2Ch 20:7 ).</p>
