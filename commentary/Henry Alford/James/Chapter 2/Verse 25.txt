<p><strong> 25</strong> .] <em> The example of Rahab</em> . Various reasons have been assigned for this example being added. Bed [8] says, “Ne se causarentur opera tanti patris Abrahæ imitari non valere, præsertim cum nullus eos modo cogeret Deo filios offerre perimendos, … addit et mulieris exemplum, mulieris criminosæ, mulieris alienigenæ, quæ tamen per opera misericordiæ, per officium hospitalitatis, etiam cum periculo vitæ suæ Dei famulis exhibitum, justificari a peccatis meruit” &amp;c. Grotius, “Abrahami exemplum Hebræis ad Christum conversis sufficere debebat, sed quia etiam alienigenis scribebat, adjunxit exemplum fœminæ extraneæ:” and similarly Hofmann, Schriftb. i. 557. Schneckenburger, “Novum additur exemplum e sexu muliebri sumptum:” and so Bengel, “Post virum ponitur mulier: nam viros et mulieres appellat,” ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:4">James 4:4</span> (see note there). When Delitzsch, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:31">Hebrews 11:31</span> , assigns as a reason that <em> der Paulinismus</em> had already used this example to prove justification <em> sola ex fide</em> , he does not necessarily assume the later date for our Epistle. See the whole matter discussed in the Prolegomena. <strong> And</strong> (the <strong> δέ</strong> brings out the contrast of the example, again affirming the Apostle’s proposition, to the ἐκ πίστεως μόνον , which has been just denied. Huther understands the δέ as bringing out the dissimilarity between the examples implied in πόρνη ) <strong> in like manner</strong> (with Abraham) <strong> was not Rahab the harlot</strong> (not “caupona” or “hospita,” as Grot., not “idololatra,” as Rosenmüller, but to be taken literally: see on Heb 11:31 ) <strong> justified by works, when she received</strong> (not necessarily “ <em> clam excepit</em> ,” as Theile, see reff. It may be so, but the <em> word</em> does not express it. The word in Heb. is δεξαμένη ) <strong> the messengers</strong> ( κατασκόπους , Heb 11:31 ), <strong> and thrust them forth</strong> (in haste and fear. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jos+2:15-16">Joshua 2:15-16</span> ; <strong> ἐκβαΛλειν</strong> is not simply ‘emittere:’ see reff.) <strong> by another way</strong> (viz. διὰ τῆς θυρίδος , Jos 2:15 LXX. For the local dative, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:12">Romans 4:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+22:14">Revelation 22:14</span> ; and Winer, § 31. 9)?
