<p><strong> 26</strong> .] <em> General conclusion to the argument</em> , but in the form of a comparison, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:17">James 2:17</span> . <strong> For</strong> ( <strong> γάρ</strong> binds the verse on to the foregoing, and makes <em> it</em> rather depend on this axiom, than this axiom a conclusion from it: ‘it must be so, Rahab must have been thus justified, seeing that’ &amp;c.) <strong> just as the body without</strong> (separate from) <strong> spirit</strong> (or, the spirit) <strong> is dead, so also faith without works</strong> (or without its works, the works belonging to it: as in Jam 2:20 ) <strong> is dead</strong> . This comparison has been found matter of surprise to some Commentators, inasmuch as the things compared do not seem relatively to correspond. Faith is unquestionably a thing spiritual: works are external and material: so that it would seem as if the members of the comparison should have been inverted, and works made the body, faith the spirit. But the Apostle’s view seems rather to be this: Faith is the body, the sum and substance, of the Christian life.: works (= obedience), the moving and quickening of that body; just as the spirit is the moving and quickening principle of the natural body. So that as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.</p>
