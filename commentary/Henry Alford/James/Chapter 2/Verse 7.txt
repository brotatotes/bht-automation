Those who maintain them to be Christian rich men, would understand this<i> blasphemy</i> of disgracing by their lives)<b> the goodly name which was called on you</b> (i. e. which when you were admitted into Christ’s Church by baptism was made yours, so that you are called<i> Christ's</i>, 1 Cor. iii. 28 [not necessarily “<i>Christians:</i>” no particular form of the appropriation of the name is alluded to, but only the fact of the name being called over them. The appellation may or may not have been in use at this time, for aught that this shews]. The name is of course that of<i> Christ:</i> not that of God, as some think, nor that of ‘brethren,’ as others)? So that if ye thus dishonour the poor in comparison with the rich, you are 1) contravening the standard of honour which God sets up in His dealings: 2) opposing your own interest: 3) helping to blaspheme the name of Christ.
