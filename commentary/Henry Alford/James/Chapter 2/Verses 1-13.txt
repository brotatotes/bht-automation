<p><strong> 1 13</strong> .] THE SIN OF RESPECT OF PERSONS: as the first of a series of reproofs for errors in practice which spring out of the mention of the νόμος τέλειος ὁ τῆς ἐλευθερίας : cf. ch. Jam 1:25 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:12">James 2:12</span> . The Apostle begins, as is his wont, with strong blame of the sin: then illustrates it, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:2-4">James 2:2-4</span> ; then gives the ground of its sinfulness, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:5-11">James 2:5-11</span> , and concludes, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:12-13">James 2:12-13</span> , with a reference again to the law of liberty.</p>
