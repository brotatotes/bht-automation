<p><strong> 8 11</strong> .] <em> Proof that this behaviour is a transgression of God’s law</em> . The connexion is somewhat recondite. The adversative <strong> μέντοι</strong> clearly takes exception at something expressed or understood. Calvin, Corn. a-Lap., Laurentius, al., and Theile, Wiesinger, and Huther, suppose the Apostle to be meeting an objection of his readers: “But thus, according to you, we should be breaking the injunction, Love thy neighbour &amp;c., for we should view the rich with hatred and contempt.” Then he replies, “Certainly, if ye &amp;c. ye do well:” understanding καλῶς <strong> π</strong> . as a very feeble approbation. But this seems to me very unnatural. It contains indeed the germ of the true view, which appears to be this: The Apostle is not replying to a fancied objection on the part of others, but is guarding his own argument from misconstruction: q. d. ‘All this is true of the rich. Still I do not say, hate them, drive them from your assemblies &amp;c.: if you choose to observe faithfully the great command, Love others as yourselves, in your conduct to all, well and good ( καλῶς ποιεῖτε ): but respect of persons, instead of being a keeping, is a breach of this law; for I have proved it to be sin, and he who commits sin is a transgressor of the law, of the whole law, by the very terms of legal obedience.’ Thus the context seems to run smoothly and naturally.</p>
