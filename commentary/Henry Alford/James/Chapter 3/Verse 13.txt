It is not easy to mark the difference, if any is here intended. Wiesinger says, “  σοφός is a general term for the normal habit as regards intelligence, cf. ch.

The σοφία and ἐπιστήμη would be dead without this exhibition, as faith without works)  his good conduct (in life: see reff.)  his works (the good conduct is the general manifestation: the works, the particular results of that general manifestation. The sum of both makes up the ἔργα in the former case, ch. 2.)  in meekness of wisdom (an adverbial clause belonging to δειξάτω : not to be tamed down into πραεία σοφία as Beza, Grot., al., nor into πραΰτης σοφή as Laurentius: meekness is the attribute, σοφία the character to which it belongs: ‘in that meekness which is the proper attribute of wisdom’).
