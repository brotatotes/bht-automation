Colossians 3:1 , εἰ οὖν συνηγέρθητε τῷ χριστῷ κ . τ . λ .)  bitter emulation ( πικρόν seems to refer back to the example in James 3:11-12 . “Non damnatur,” says Bengel, “zelus dulcis et ira dulcis, ex fide et amore”)  and rivalry (see on ἔριθος and  ἐριθεία in note, Romans 2:8 . Beware of confounding ἐριθεία with ἔρις , as is very generally done)  in your heart (  out of which come thoughts and words and acts, see Mat 15:18-19 ),  do not (in giving yourselves out for wise, which (cf.
