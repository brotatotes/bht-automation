Some, as De W. and Wiesinger, suppose κατακαυχ . κατά to belong together, and καὶ ψεύδεσθε to be an insertion of the Apostle further to define the κατακαυχᾶσθε . Others again have taken pains to excuse the imagined tautology in ψεύδεσθε κατὰ τῆς ἀληθείας , which however is no tautology at all. ἡ ἀλήθεια , from its following κατακαυχᾶσθε , is necessarily not subjective, ‘ <em> truth</em> ’ merely, as a quality absent from the conduct of those thus acting, but objective, ‘ <em> the truth</em> ,’ of which their whole lives would be thus a negation and an opposition; which would be in their persons vaunted against and lied against).</p>
