<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <em> Designation of such pretended wisdom</em> . <strong> This wisdom is not one descending from above</strong> (the verb is purposely resolved, to throw out the negation <strong> οὐκ ἔστιν</strong> , and to put the categorical <strong> κατερχομένη</strong> into prominence as a class to which this σοφία does not belong. So that we must not miss this purpose by making ἐστιν κατερχομένη = κατέρχεται , as does E. V., Schneckenb., al.: still less must we with Luth … al., render ungrammatically, “this is not the wisdom which cometh down” ( ἡ ἄνωθεν κατερχομένη )), <strong> but earthly</strong> (as the sharpest contrast to ἄνωθεν κατερχομένη : belonging to this earth, and its life of sin and strife), <strong> sensual</strong> (it is almost impossible to express satisfactorily in English the idea given by <strong> ψυχικός</strong> . Our ‘ <em> soul</em> ’ is so identified with man’s spiritual part in common parlance, that we have lost the distinction between ψυχή and πνεῦμα , except when we can give a periphrastic explanation. The idea here is, belonging to the unspiritual mind of man. See the whole treated in the note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:19">Jude 1:19</span> , ψυχικοὶ πνεῦμα οὐκ ἔχοντες ), <strong> devilish</strong> (like, or partaking of the nature of, the devils. This word must not be figuratively taken, as by Hottinger (in Huther), “impuro genio magis quam homine digna:” it betokens both the origin of this hypocritical wisdom (cf. φλογιζομένη ὑπὸ τῆς γεέννης above, Jam 3:6 ), and its character: it is from, not God, the giver of all true wisdom, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:5">James 1:5</span> , but the devil, and bears the character of its author).</p>
