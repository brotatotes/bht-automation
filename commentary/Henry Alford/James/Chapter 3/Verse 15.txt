 15 .]  Designation of such pretended wisdom .  This wisdom is not one descending from above (the verb is purposely resolved, to throw out the negation  οὐκ ἔστιν , and to put the categorical  κατερχομένη into prominence as a class to which this σοφία does not belong. So that we must not miss this purpose by making ἐστιν κατερχομένη = κατέρχεται , as does E. V., Schneckenb., al.: still less must we with Luth … al., render ungrammatically, “this is not the wisdom which cometh down” ( ἡ ἄνωθεν κατερχομένη )),  but earthly (as the sharpest contrast to ἄνωθεν κατερχομένη : belonging to this earth, and its life of sin and strife),  sensual (it is almost impossible to express satisfactorily in English the idea given by  ψυχικός . Our ‘  soul ’ is so identified with man’s spiritual part in common parlance, that we have lost the distinction between ψυχή and πνεῦμα , except when we can give a periphrastic explanation. The idea here is, belonging to the unspiritual mind of man. See the whole treated in the note on Jude 1:19 , ψυχικοὶ πνεῦμα οὐκ ἔχοντες ),  devilish (like, or partaking of the nature of, the devils. This word must not be figuratively taken, as by Hottinger (in Huther), “impuro genio magis quam homine digna:” it betokens both the origin of this hypocritical wisdom (cf. φλογιζομένη ὑπὸ τῆς γεέννης above, Jam 3:6 ), and its character: it is from, not God, the giver of all true wisdom, ch. James 1:5 , but the devil, and bears the character of its author).
