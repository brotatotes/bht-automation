<p><strong> 17</strong> .] <strong> But</strong> (contrast) <strong> the wisdom from above is first of all pure</strong> (“Ad duplex genus qualitas revocatur: altero interna vis uno vocabulo exprimitur, quippe una ipsa cæterarumque effectrix, altero externæ rationes sex notationibus describuntur, quæ ad primarium scriptoris consilium invidiæ rixisque occurrendi omnes redeunt.” Theile. ἁγνή , καθαρὰ καὶ ἀρύπαρος , μηδενὸς τῶν σαρκικῶν ἀντεχομένη , Œc. It is hardly necessary to guard any scholar against the abuse of this text often found, when it is made to signify that the heavenly-wise must be pure, i. e. free from all contact with any thing that offends, <em> before he can be</em> peaceable: and thus it is used to further, instead of to discourage, an uncharitable spirit), <strong> then</strong> (= in the second place: its external qualities are now enumerated) <strong> peaceable, forbearing</strong> ( μὴ ἀκριβοδίκαιος ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖρον , Aristot. Eth. Nic. x. 6. See note on Php 4:5 ), <strong> easily persuaded</strong> (“suadibilis,” vulg. The word occurs in the active sense of “easily persuading,” in Æschyl. Agam. 274, πότερα δ ʼ ὀνείρων φάσματ ʼ εὐπειθῆ σέβεις : and Choeph. 259, πέμπειν ἔχοις ἂν σήματ ʼ εὐπειθῆ βροτοῖς : but not, that I am aware, in this passive sense), <strong> full of compassion</strong> (the great triumph of the Christian practical life is won by ἔλεος : see ch. Jam 2:13 ) <strong> and good fruits</strong> (contrast to πᾶν φαῦλον πρᾶγμα above), <strong> without doubting</strong> (as might be expected, from the various meanings of διακρίνεσθαι , this word has been variously interpreted. Luther, E. V., and most Commentators render it “ <em> without partiality</em> ,” unparteiisch, thus giving to a passive adjective an active meaning: and in the same spirit, Œc., μὴ διακρίνουσα παρατηρήσεις βρωμάτων κ . διαφόρων βαπτισμάτων : Beza, “ <em> absque disceptatione</em> :” vulg., “ <em> non judicans</em> :” Calvin, “Nimis anxiam et scrupulosam inquisitionem notat, qualem fere in hypocritis cernere licet, qui dum nimis exacte inquirunt in fratrum dicta et facta, nihil non in sinistram partem rapiunt:” Bengel, “Non facit discrimen ubi non opus est, v. gr., inter potentes et tenues.” The passive sense is kept by Gebser, who understands “undivided:” the heavenly-wise keeping banded together in love: Wetst., “ <em> non duplex</em> .” Two considerations contribute to substantiate the rendering given above, which is that of De Wette, Wiesinger, and Huther. 1. The word would seem, from its close junction with ἀνυπόκριτος , rather to betoken an inner quality than (as Gebser above) an outward circumstance: 2. when thus used of an inner quality, cf. ch. Jam 1:6 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:4">James 2:4</span> , our Apostle, in common with other N. T. writers, signifies by it ‘ <em> to doubt</em> .’ So that I would understand by it “expers omnis cujuscunque ambiguitatis et simulationis,” as Huther), <strong> without feigning</strong> (“These two characteristics are also added with especial reference to the state of things among the readers: on <strong> ἀδιάκριτος</strong> , cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:6-8">James 1:6-8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:4">James 2:4</span> ; on <strong> ἀνυπόκριτος</strong> , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:22">James 1:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:26">James 1:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span> .” Huther).</p>
