 2 .]  For (see above: this supplies the ellipsis)  oftentimes (adverbial: see reff. and Winer, § 54. 1)  we all (without exception:  ἅπαντες is a stronger form than πάντες , being originally contracted from ἅμα πάντες )  offend (  πταίω , cognate with πίπτω , πέπτωκα , πτῶσις , see Buttmann, Lexil. i. p. 295, to stumble, fall: cf. the proverb, μὴ δὶς πρὸς τὸν αὐτὸν λίθον πταίειν : hence figuratively, to err or offend morally. The present assertion is to be taken in the widest moral sense, as an axiom applying to our whole conduct. It is in the next clause limited to the subject in hand, viz. the tongue):  if any man (see ch. James 1:5 ; James 1:23 ; Jam 1:26 )  offendeth not (is void of offence:  οὐ , because the negative belongs, not subjectively to the hypothesis, but objectively to the fact included within the hypothesis)  in word (in speaking: and therefore the hypothesis is applicable to these many who set up for teachers, seeing that thus their chances of offence would be multiplied many fold),  he (  is )  a perfect man (explained by what follows),  able to bridle the whole body also (I cannot see the force of De Wette’s objections against the general sense of the πολλὰ πταίομεν ἅπαντες . The sense surely runs well thus: We all oftentimes offend: and of those frequent offences, sins of the tongue are so weighty a part and so constant a cause, that he who is free from them may be said to be perfect, inasmuch as he is able to rule every other minor cause of offence: ‘the whole body’ standing for all those other members by which, as by the tongue, sin may be committed: which may be ὅπλα ἀδικίας τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ or ὅπλα δικαιοσύνης τῷ θεῷ , Rom 6:13 ).
