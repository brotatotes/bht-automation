<p><strong> 3</strong> .] This mention of <strong> χαλιναγωγῆσαι</strong> , and the situation of the tongue where the χαλινός also is placed, introduce this similitude: which circumstances will also account for <strong> τῶν ἵππων</strong> standing first and emphatic, χαλινός and στόμα being ideas already given by the context. <strong> But</strong> (transitional) <strong> if</strong> (as we do: = in our vernacular, ‘ <em> when</em> ,’ ‘ <em> as often as</em> ’) <strong> of horses</strong> (this would not be English, but indicates the emphatic place of τῶν ἵππων . The gen. depends on τὰ στόματα , not on τοὺς χαλινούς ) <strong> we put</strong> (so χαλινὸν ἵππῳ ἐμβάλλειν , Ælian V. H. ix. 16) <strong> bits</strong> ( <strong> τούς</strong> , which are in common use: the bits, of which every one knows) <strong> into the mouths, in order to their obeying us</strong> (thus shewing, by the expression of this purpose, that we recognize the principle of turning the whole body by the tongue), (now comes the apodosis after the <strong> εἰ</strong> : see below) <strong> we turn about also</strong> (in turning the bit one way or the other) <strong> their whole body</strong> (cf. Soph. Antig. 473, σμικρῷ χαλινῷ δ ʼ οἰδα τοὺς θυμουμένους Ἵππους καταρτυθέντας ).</p>
