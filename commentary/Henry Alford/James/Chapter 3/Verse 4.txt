<p><strong> 4</strong> .] The <em> second comparison</em> takes up, not the protasis with its εἰ δέ , but only the apodosis foregoing. <strong> Behold, even</strong> (or also) <strong> the ships, though so great</strong> (the participle carries a slightly ratiocinative force, illative or exceptive according to the circumstances), <strong> and driven by fierce</strong> (see reff.: and cf. Ælian de Animal, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:13">James 3:13</span> , σκληρὸν πνεῦμα : and Hist. Var. ix. 14, ἵνα μὴ ἀνατρέπηται ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνέμων , εἴποτε σκληροὶ κατέπνεον . See other citations in Wetst.) <strong> winds</strong> (Bed [9] interprets this as having a meaning respecting ourselves: “Naves magnæ in mari, mentes sunt hominum in hac vita, sive bonorum sive malorum. Venti validi, a quibus minantur (?), ipsi appetitus sunt mentium, quibus naturaliter coguntur aliquld agere” &amp;c. But it is not likely that the Apostle had any such meaning), <strong> are turned about by a very small rudder, whither-soever</strong> ( <strong> οπου</strong> for ὅποι , which is not used in N. T. So also in the classics: e. g. Soph. Trach. 40, κεῖνος ὅπου βέβηκεν ) <strong> the desire</strong> (not, as many Commentators, the external impulse given by the hand. Cf. Plato, Phileb. p. 35 D, ξύμπασαν τήν τε ὁρμὴν καὶ ἐπιθυμίαν καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν τοῦ ζώου παντός ) <strong> of the steersman</strong> (him who actually handles the tiller) <strong> may wish</strong> . The same thought occurs in Aristot. Quæst Mechan. 5, τὸ πηδάλιον , μικρὸν ὄν , καὶ ἐπ ʼ ἐσχάτῳ τῷ πλοίῳ , τοσαύτην δύναμιν ἔχει , ὥστε ὑπὸ μικροῦ οἴακος , καὶ ἑνὸς ἀνθρώπου δυνάμεως , καὶ ταύτης ἠρεμαίας , μεγάλα κινεῖσθαι μεγέθη πλοίων . Philo, In Flacc. 5, vol. ii. p. 521, joins the two ideas together, ἐμπειροτάτους κυβερνήτας , οἳ καθάπερ ἀθλητὰς ἵππους ἡνιοχοῦσιν , ἀπλανῆ παρέχοντας τὸν ἐπ ʼ εὐθείας δρόμον . Cf. also Lucret. iv. 899, and other examples in Wetst.
