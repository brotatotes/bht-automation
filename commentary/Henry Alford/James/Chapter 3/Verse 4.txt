 4 .] The  second comparison takes up, not the protasis with its εἰ δέ , but only the apodosis foregoing.  Behold, even (or also)  the ships, though so great (the participle carries a slightly ratiocinative force, illative or exceptive according to the circumstances),  and driven by fierce (see reff.: and cf. Ælian de Animal, James 3:13 , σκληρὸν πνεῦμα : and Hist. Var. ix. 14, ἵνα μὴ ἀνατρέπηται ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνέμων , εἴποτε σκληροὶ κατέπνεον . See other citations in Wetst.)  winds (Bed [9] interprets this as having a meaning respecting ourselves: “Naves magnæ in mari, mentes sunt hominum in hac vita, sive bonorum sive malorum. Venti validi, a quibus minantur (?), ipsi appetitus sunt mentium, quibus naturaliter coguntur aliquld agere” &c. But it is not likely that the Apostle had any such meaning),  are turned about by a very small rudder, whither-soever (  οπου for ὅποι , which is not used in N. T. So also in the classics: e. g. Soph. Trach. 40, κεῖνος ὅπου βέβηκεν )  the desire (not, as many Commentators, the external impulse given by the hand. Cf. Plato, Phileb. p. 35 D, ξύμπασαν τήν τε ὁρμὴν καὶ ἐπιθυμίαν καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν τοῦ ζώου παντός )  of the steersman (him who actually handles the tiller)  may wish . The same thought occurs in Aristot. Quæst Mechan. 5, τὸ πηδάλιον , μικρὸν ὄν , καὶ ἐπ ʼ ἐσχάτῳ τῷ πλοίῳ , τοσαύτην δύναμιν ἔχει , ὥστε ὑπὸ μικροῦ οἴακος , καὶ ἑνὸς ἀνθρώπου δυνάμεως , καὶ ταύτης ἠρεμαίας , μεγάλα κινεῖσθαι μεγέθη πλοίων . Philo, In Flacc. 5, vol. ii. p. 521, joins the two ideas together, ἐμπειροτάτους κυβερνήτας , οἳ καθάπερ ἀθλητὰς ἵππους ἡνιοχοῦσιν , ἀπλανῆ παρέχοντας τὸν ἐπ ʼ εὐθείας δρόμον . Cf. also Lucret. iv. 899, and other examples in Wetst.
