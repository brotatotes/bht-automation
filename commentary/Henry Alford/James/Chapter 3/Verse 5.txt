<b> 5.]</b><i> Application of the comparison</i>.<b> Thus also the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things</b> (vaunts great words, which bring about great acts of mischief).<b> Behold</b> (rendering the sentence literally:—for the purpose of an English version, it must be inverted),<b> how small a fire kindleth how great a forest</b> (the word also sometimes signifies “<i>matter</i>,” and thus the A.V. But the ordinary meaning,<b> forest</b>, gives a far livelier and more graphic sense here)!<br><br><b>6.]</b><b> Likewise the tongue is a fire, that world of iniquity</b> (a complete repertory of all wickedness, as the world is of all things):<b> the tongue is</b> (literally, is constituted: but meaning no more than that it<i> is</i>)<b> among our members, that one which defileth the whole body</b> (thus justifying the title given to it of “<i>that world of iniquity</i>”),<b> and setteth on fire</b> (the other clause,<b> the tongue is a fire</b>, is now taken up)<b> the orb</b> (or,<b> wheel</b>)<b> of the creation</b> (in interpreting these difficult words, one thing must especially be borne in mind: that, like<i> the whole body</i>, they designate some material thing which agreeably to the figure used may be set on fire. This would at once set aside all figurative explanations See the proposed meanings discussed in my Greek Test. The sense,<i> the whole orb</i> or<i> cycle of creation</i>, is that which I have seen cause to adopt: for other reasons, and because it fits well into the context. After the mention of the<i> orb of creation</i>, it is natural that the Apostle should take up, with the<b> for</b> (ver. 7), the details of creation, and assert that they might all be tamed by man, but that the tongue is untameable. Again, such sense is most agreeable to the similitude just used, of a small spark kindling a vast forest. The expression in the A.V.,<b> the course of nature</b>, is sufficiently near the meaning, and expresses it in better English, perhaps, than any other);<b> and is itself set on fire</b> (in the original the verb is in the<i> present</i> tense, indicating that it is habitually, continually, so set on fire: see below)<b> by hell</b> (which is itself<i> the hell of fire</i>, in Matt. v. 22, and many other places. These words are not to be explained away: but are to be literally taken. It is the devil for whom hell is prepared, that is the tempter and instigator of the habitual sins of the tongue. It is out of the question [see above] to regard the sentence as alluding to the original temptations of the fall: equally so, to suppose it to have a future reference, and to imply that the tongue shall be tormented in hell: as some have done. Wiesinger says: “This passage reminds us, in its general sense, of the Old Test. sayings, Prov. xvi. 27; Ps. cxx. 2–4; Ecclus. xxviii. 11 ff.” This last clause is strikingly paralleled by the Targum on Ps. cxx. 2, where the deceitful tongue is compared with coals of juniper, which are set on fire in hell beneath. But none of these passages treats of the destruction which the tongue brings on its own body).
