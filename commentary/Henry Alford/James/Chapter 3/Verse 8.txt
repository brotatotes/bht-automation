 8 .]  but (exception)  the tongue no one of men can tame (the assertion is absolute, not to be weakened by εὐκόλως κ . ἄνευ πόνου , as the Schol. in Matthæi. And it is plain that to read it, as Œc., interrogatively ( εἰ τὰ ἀτίθασσα θηρία ὁ ἄνθρωπος τιθασσεύει καὶ χειροήθη ποιεῖ , ἆρα τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γλῶσσαν οὐ δαμάσει ;), is quite out of the question. Observe  δαμάσαι , aor., ‘even to tame once,’ not habitually, pres. Now we see fully the meaning of Jam 3:2 ):  it is a restless mischief (  ἀκατάστατον expresses both fickleness and restlessness, see above on ch.

The figure here seems to correspond nearly to what is related of Proteus, that he eluded the grasp of Menelaus under many various shapes. Cf.

Or, the two clauses may be rendered without any copulæ, as quasi-exclamations)  full of death-bringing poison (cf. ref. Ps., ἠκόνησαν γλῶσσαν αὐτῶν ὡσεὶ ὄφεως , ἰὸς ἀσπίδων ὑπὸ τὰ χείλη αὐτῶν ). I cannot forbear referring the reader to Erasmus’s very elegant paraphrase of these two verses, 7, 8; and thanking Wiesinger for directing attention to it.
