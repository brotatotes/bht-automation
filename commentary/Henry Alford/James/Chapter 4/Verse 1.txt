<p><strong> 1</strong> .] <strong> Whence are wars, and whence fightings among you</strong> (“By what follows, it is not contentions <em> between teachers</em> that are meant, as Schneckenb., al., or <em> sects</em> , as Semler, al., but concerning ‘meum’ and ‘tuum.’ Grot. refers them to the tumults which preceded the destruction of Jerusalem. <strong> πόλ</strong> . and <strong> μάχ</strong> . are strong expressions, as in Arrian, Epict. iii. 21 in Raphel, and Wetst. πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον πόλεμος , πρὸς τοὺς γείτονας κ . τ . λ .” De Wette. The above assertion, that these are strifes about mine and thine, confines them perhaps to too narrow a space; they seem rather, as Huther, to represent all those quarrels which spring up about common worldly interests from selfish considerations of pride, envy, covetousness, and the like)? <strong> Are they not from hence</strong> (this second question contains in fact the answer to the former, in an appeal to the consciences of the readers), <strong> from your lusts</strong> (an unusual sense of <strong> ἡδοναί</strong> , hardly distinguishable from ἐπιθυμίαι : in fact taken up by ἐπιθυμεῖτε ) <strong> which militate</strong> (campaign, have their camp, and, as it were, forage about. There seems no need, with De W., Calov., al., to supply κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς or κατὰ τοῦ νοός , as in ref.: Huther observes well, that, had this been intended, it would have been more plainly expressed. Schneckenb., Theile, al. understand it of militating <em> one against another</em> , but this again is not consistent with the context, in which αἱ ἡδοναὶ ὑμῶν are treated as a class, united for one purpose, cf. Jam 4:3 fin. Wiesinger thinks that the adversaries are to be found in the fact of the ἐπιθυμεῖν having set over against it an οὐκ ἔχειν , an οὐ δύνασθε ἐπιτυχεῖν . But this again would not, except by implication (this οὐ δύνασθε implying a neighbour who is the obstacle), touch the point of wars and fightings. It is far better therefore to see as the adversaries, our fellow-men, against whom, to put down whom and set ourselves up, our lusts are as it were an army of soldiers ever encamped within us and waging war) <strong> in your members</strong> (see a remarkable parallel in Plato, Phædo, p. 66 C: καὶ γὰρ πολέμους καὶ στάσεις καὶ μάχας οὐδὲν ἄλλο παρέχει ἢ τὸ σῶμα καὶ αἱ τούτου ἐπιθυμίαι )?

<p>Jam 4:2 <em> carries on the assertion in detail</em> . Ye desire (generally: it is not said what: but evidently worldly possessions and honours are intended by the context, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:4">James 4:4</span> ff.), and possess not (lust of possession does not ensure possession itself, then comes a further step, out of this lust): ye murder (but how comes φόνος to be introduced at this early stage of the development of ἐπιθυμία , before ζῆλος , which itself leads on to μάχαι κ . πόλεμοι ? Three solutions of this difficulty may at once be set aside, as out of the question: 1. that which makes the words mean “ <em> ye envy even unto death</em> ,” giving the so-called adverbial meaning to φονεύετε καί . So Carpzov, Pott, Schneckenburger, al. Against this, besides its exceeding lameness and clumsiness, is, that in this case the subordinate verb φονεύετε must come <em> last</em> , not first. 2. That which gives to φονεύετε the unexampled sense, “ <em> ye murder in thought</em> ,” have the intent to murder. So Estius, Calov., Bengel, De Wette, Huther, Wiesinger. But even if such a meaning might be justified, which I doubt, by the strong figurative cast of the passage, yet the matter of fact character of the following clause, καὶ οὐ δύνασθε ἐπιτυχεῖν , makes it more probable that a matter of fact is here also pointed at, and that φονεύετε is rather qualified by καὶ ζηλοῦτε than strictly parallel with it. 3. That of Œcum., which as far as I know stands alone: ἐπιστατέον δὲ ὡς φόνον ἐνταῦθα καὶ πόλεμον οὐ τὸν σαρκικόν φησι . τοῦτο γὰρ βαρὺ καὶ κατὰ λῃστῶν ἐννοεῖν , μὴ ὅτι κατὰ πόσως πιστῶν καὶ τῷ κυοίῳ προσερχουένων . ἀλλ ʼ ὥς γέ μοι δοκεῖ , φονευειν φησὶ τοὺς τὴν ἑαυτῶν ψυχὴν ἀποκτίννυντας ταῖς τολμηραῖς ταύταις ἐπιχειρήσεσι , δι ʼ ἃς καὶ ὁ πρὸς τὴν εὐσέβειαν αὐτοῖς πόλεμος . Another inadmissible expedient is, to suppose φθονεῖτε to be the true reading; there being no authority whatever for it in manuscripts. Thus Erasm., Luther, Calvin, Beza, Piscator, Benson, and many others. It only remains then to take the word literally, and understand it to allude to such cases, e. g. as those in the O. T. of David and Ahab, who, in their desire to possess, committed murder. And if it be said, as Œc. above, that this is a hard saying of those who feared the Lord, be it remembered that the Apostle is speaking of πόλεμοι καὶ μάχαι , and though he may include under these terms the lesser forms of variance, the greater and more atrocious ones are clearly not excluded. In the state of Jewish society during the apostolic age, it is to be feared that examples of them were but too plentiful, and there is no saying how far the Christian portion of Jewish communities may have suffered themselves to become entangled in such quarrels and their murderous consequences) and envy, and are not able to obtain: ye fight and make war (these words form the final answer to the πόθεν κ . τ . λ . with which the section begins: and are therefore not to be joined with the following as by δέ in the rec.).
