<p><strong> 11</strong> .] <strong> Do not speak against one another</strong> (it is evident what sort of <strong> καταλαλεῖν</strong> he means, by the junction of <strong> κρίνειν</strong> with it below: it is that kind which follows upon unfavourable judgment: depreciation of character and motive), <strong> brethren</strong> ( <strong> ἀδελφοί</strong> prepares the way for the frequent mention of ἀδελφός below): <strong> he that speaketh against a brother</strong> (but not necessarily indefinite: the relations of life, πατήρ , μήτηρ , ἀδελφός &amp;c. frequently lose their articles even when put definitely), <strong> and judgeth his brother</strong> (the expression of αὐτοῦ in this second case brings out more strongly the community under the νόμος , which such an one violates), <strong> speaketh against the law</strong> (of Christian life: the old moral law glorified and amplified by Christ: the νόμος βασιλικός , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:8">James 2:8</span> ; νόμος τῆς ἐλευθερίας , Jam 1:25 ), <strong> and judgeth the law</strong> (viz. by setting himself up over that law, as pronouncing upon its observance or non-observance by another. This is far better, than with Grot., al., “Doctrinam evangelicam homo talis spernit et damnat ut imperfectam: Christus enim tales non damnat:” or than Laurentius, cited with approbation by Huther, “Is qui detrahit proximo, detrahit legi, quia lex prohibet omnem detractionem: sed et judicat idem legem, quia hoc ipso quod contra prohibitionem legis detrahit, judicat quasi, legem non recte prohibuisse.” This is condemned by the word <em> quasi</em> : for such an argument might be used of every transgressor. See below): <strong> but if</strong> (as thou dost) <strong> thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge</strong> (seeing that he who judges, judges not only the man before him, but the law also: for he pronounces not only on the fact, but on that fact being, or not being, a breach of the law. So that thus to bring men’s actions under the cognizance of the law, is the office of a judge. There is no need to supply νόμου after κριτής : indeed it destroys the sense by removing the point of the assertion. That the evil speaker <em> judges the law</em> , was before asserted; <em> now</em> , he is stated to be thereby removed from the Christian brotherhood of doers of the law, and become categorically <em> a judge</em> . And then in the next verse, the inconsistency and absurdity of his placing himself in that category is shewn).</p>
