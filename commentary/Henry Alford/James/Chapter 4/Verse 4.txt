For it puts God in the place of<i> husband</i>: and thus it is as natural to call individual men adulteresses, as the whole human race, or any particular nation.” Some have thought that St. James is addressing Churches here. But God is the Lord and husband of every soul that is His, as much as of every church; and the indignant<i> exclamation</i> of the Apostle is just as applicable to every one who forsakes his or her God, as to an apostate church.
