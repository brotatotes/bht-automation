 11, 12 .]  Exhortation against evil speaking and uncharitable judgment . Some have thought that there is no close connexion with the preceding: and Huther urges this from the milder word ἀδελφοί being here used, whereas before it was μοιχαλίδες , ἁμαρτωλοί , δίψυχοι . But it may be observed, that St. James frequently begins his exhortations mildly, and moves onward into severity: in this very paragraph we have an example of it, where unquestionably the σὺ τίς εἶ ὁ κρίνων τὸν πλησίον ; is more severe than the ἀδελφοί with which it began. The connexion is with the whole spirit of this part of the Epistle, as dissuading mutual quarrels, undue self-exaltation, and neighbour-depreciation. Chap. 3. dealt with the sins of the tongue: and now, after speaking against pride and strife, the Apostle naturally returns to them, as springing out of a proud, uncharitable spirit.
