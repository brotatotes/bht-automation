<b> 1.] Go to now</b> (see above, ch. iv. 13),<b> ye rich, go weep</b> (the<i> tense</i> in the original gives the command a concentrated force, as that which ought to be done at once and without delay),<b> howling</b> (it is a word in the Old Test. confined to the prophets, and used, as here, with reference to the near approach of God’s judgments. See Isa. xiii. 6)<b> over your miseries which are coming on</b> (no supply of the word “<i>you</i>” is required after the verb. These miseries are not to be thought of as the natural and determined end of all worldly riches, but are the judgments connected with the coming of the Lord: see ver. 8. It may be that this prospect was as yet intimately bound up with the approaching destruction of the Jewish city and polity: for it must be remembered that they are Jews who are here addressed).
