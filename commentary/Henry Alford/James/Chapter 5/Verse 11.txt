 11 .]  Another example , in which a further point is gained.  Behold, we count happy them that have endured (see Matthew 5:10 . ὑπομείν  αντας  may be a correction to suit the sense, and τέλος below, but it must be adopted as the most ancient reading, and it is connected with Matt. L. c., μακάριοι οἱ  δεδιωγμένοι , they who have been persecuted):  ye (have) heard of the endurance of Job; see also (not ‘and have seen,’ which Wiesinger renders even with the reading ἴδετε . The imperative is not as Huther auffallend, but natural enough, see ch. Jam 1:6-7 )  the end of the Lord (‘the termination which the Lord (in O. T. sense) gave:’ do not limit your attention to Job’s sufferings, but look on to the end and see the mercy shewn him by God);  for (better than “that,” as Huther, al.: the sense being, ‘Job’s patience is known to you all: do not rest there, but look on to the end which God gave him: and it is well worth your while so to do, for you will find that He is’ &c. And this has apparently occasioned the repetition by the Apostle of the word  ὁ κύριος , which has been left out by those who imagined that  ὅτι introduced merely the result of the inspection, and that therefore no new subject was needed)  the Lord is very pitiful (  πολύσπλαγχνος , a word no where else found: coined after the Heb. רַב־חֶסֶד (Wiesinger), which the LXX render πολυέλεος , Exo 34:6 al., always joined with μακρόθυμος : see in Trommius. We have εὔσπλαγχνος , Ephesians 4:32 ; 1Pe 3:8 )  and merciful (reff. This remembrance of God’s pity and mercy would encourage them also to hope that whatever their sufferings, the τέλος κυρίου might prove similar in their own case).
