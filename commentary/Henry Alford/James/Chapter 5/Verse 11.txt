<p><strong> 11</strong> .] <em> Another example</em> , in which a further point is gained. <strong> Behold, we count happy them that have endured</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span> . ὑπομείν <strong> αντας</strong> <em> may</em> be a correction to suit the sense, and τέλος below, but it must be adopted as the most ancient reading, and it is connected with Matt. L. c., μακάριοι οἱ <strong> δεδιωγμένοι</strong> , they who have been persecuted): <strong> ye (have) heard of the endurance of Job; see also</strong> (not ‘and have seen,’ which Wiesinger renders even with the reading ἴδετε . The imperative is not as Huther auffallend, but natural enough, see ch. Jam 1:6-7 ) <strong> the end of the Lord</strong> (‘the termination which the Lord (in O. T. sense) gave:’ do not limit your attention to Job’s sufferings, but look on to the end and see the mercy shewn him by God); <strong> for</strong> (better than “that,” as Huther, al.: the sense being, ‘Job’s patience is known to you all: do not rest there, but look on to the end which God gave him: and it is well worth your while so to do, for you will find that He is’ &amp;c. And this has apparently occasioned the repetition by the Apostle of the word <strong> ὁ κύριος</strong> , which has been left out by those who imagined that <strong> ὅτι</strong> introduced merely the result of the inspection, and that therefore no new subject was needed) <strong> the Lord is very pitiful</strong> ( <strong> πολύσπλαγχνος</strong> , a word no where else found: coined after the Heb. רַב־חֶסֶד (Wiesinger), which the LXX render πολυέλεος , Exo 34:6 al., always joined with μακρόθυμος : see in Trommius. We have εὔσπλαγχνος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</span> ; 1Pe 3:8 ) <strong> and merciful</strong> (reff. This remembrance of God’s pity and mercy would encourage them also to hope that whatever their sufferings, the τέλος κυρίου might prove similar in their own case).</p>
