<b> 15.]</b><b> and the prayer of faith</b> (the prayer which faith offers)<b> shall save</b> (clearly here, considering that the forgiveness of sins is separately stated afterwards, this term can<i> only</i> be used of<i> corporeal healing</i>, not of the salvation of the soul, This has not always been recognized. The R.-Cath. interpreters, who pervert the whole passage to the defence of the practice of extreme unction, take it of the salvation of the soul: Cornelius-a-Lapide saying, “<i>The prayer of faith</i>, i.e. the sacrament and the sacramental form of extreme unction (!), shall save the sick, i.e., shall confer on him grace by which his soul may be saved.” Some Commentators take both meanings. The Council of Trent prevaricates between the two)<b> the sick man, and the Lord</b> (most probably Christ, again: He who is Lord in the Christian church)<b> shall raise him up</b> (from his bed of sickness: thus the Greek word is used in Mark i. 31; Matt. viii. 15; ix. 5–7, &c. Here again our R.-Cath. friends are in sad perplexity, seeing that these words entirely deprive the passage of all relevancy to extreme unction):<b> even if he have committed</b> (he be<i> in a state of having committed</i>, i.e. abiding under the consequence of, some commission of sin; for so the<i> perfect</i> tense implies; and hereby the sin in question is presumed to have been the working cause of his present sickness)<b> sins, it shall be forgiven him</b> (supply as a subject,<i> the having committed them</i>, from the foregoing).<br><br> Among all the daring perversions of Scripture by which the Church of Rome has defended her superstitions, there is none more patent than that of the present passage. Not without reason has the Council of Trent defended its misinterpretation with the anathema above cited: for indeed it needed that, and every other recommendation, to support it, and give it any kind of acceptance. The Apostle is treating of a matter totally distinct from the occasion, and the object, of extreme unction. He is enforcing the efficacy of the prayer of faith in afflictions, ver. 13. Of such efficacy, he adduces one special instance. In sickness, let the sick man inform the elders of the Church. Let them, representing the congregation of the faithful, pray over the sick man, accompanying that prayer with the symbolic and sacramental act of anointing with oil in the name of the Lord. Then, the prayer of faith (see Cornelius-a-Lapide above for the audacious interpretation) shall save (heal) the sick man, and the Lord shall bring him up out of his sickness; and even if it were occasioned by some sin, that sin shall be forgiven him. Such is the simple and undeniable sense of the Apostle, arguing for the efficacy of prayer: and such, as above seen, the perversion of that sense by the Church of Rome. Here, as in the rest of these cases, it is our comfort to know that there is a God of truth, whose judgment shall begin at His Church. Observe, the promises here made of recovery and forgiveness are unconditional, as in Mark xvi. 18, &c.
