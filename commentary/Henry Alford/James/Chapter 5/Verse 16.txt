<b> 16.]</b><i> A general injunction</i> arising out of a circumstance necessarily to be inferred in the preceding example. There, the sin would of necessity have been confessed to the elders, before the prayer of faith could deal with it. And seeing the blessed consequences in that case,— “generally,” says the Apostle, “in all similar cases, and one to another universally, pursue the same salutary practice of confessing your sins.”<b> Confess therefore to one another</b> (not only to the presbyters in the case supposed, but to one another generally)<b> your transgressions</b> (i. e. not merely offences against your brethren; but also sins against God: compare Matt. vi. 14, 15),<b> and pray for one another that ye may be healed</b> (in case of sickness, as above. The context here forbids any wider meaning: and so rightly De Wette, Wiesinger, and Huther. So even Cornelius-a-Lapide). It might appear astonishing, were it not notorious, that on this passage among others is built the Romish doctrine of the necessity of confessing sins to a priest. As a specimen of<i> the way in which</i> it is deduced, I subjoin Cornelius-a-Lapide’s explanation “ ‘<i>One another:</i>’ i.e. confess, man to man, like to like, brother to brother, namely to the priest, who though in office he be superior, yet by nature is equal, like in infirmity, the same in obligation of confessing.” Cajetan, on the contrary, denies that “sacramental confession” is here spoken of: here, as in so many other cases, the much-vaunted unity of Roman interpreters embracing the most opposite opinions.<b> The supplication of a righteous man</b> (i. e. of one who shews his faith by his works, see ch. ii. 24)<b> availeth much in its working</b> (i. e. worketh very effectually. Much doubt has arisen about the meaning and reference of this last term. It is usually taken as in A.V.,— “the effectual fervent prayer,”—as an epithet, setting forth its fervency. This interpretation however has not only, as Wiesinger confesses, New Test. usage against it, but can hardly be justified from the context, it being necessarily implied that the prayer of the righteous man is not a dead and formal one. Besides which, the force of the general sentence, “<i>the prayer of a righteous man availeth much,</i>” suffers much from the appending of a condition under which alone the sentence could be true).
