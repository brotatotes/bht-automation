<b> 17.]</b><b> Elijah was a man of like passions with us</b> (this precedes, to obviate the objection that the greatness of Elijah, so far out of our reach, neutralizes the example for us weak and ordinary men. There is no contrast to the<i> just</i> man intended, but rather Elijah is an éxample of a just man),<b> and he prayed with prayer</b> (made it a special matter of prayer: not,<i> prayed earnestly</i>, as A.V., and others)<b> that it might not rain</b> (this fact is not even hinted at in the Old Test. history in 1 Kings xvii. ff.; nor the following one, that he prayed for rain at the end of the drought: though this latter may perhaps be implied in 1 Kings xviii. 42 ff.),<b> and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months</b> (so also Luke iv. 25: and in a Rabbinical work this, “In the thirteenth year of Ahab, a famine prevailed in Samaria for three years and a half.” There is no real discrepancy here, as has been often assumed, with the account in I Kings: for as Benson has rightly observed, the words “<i>in the third year</i>” of 1 Kings xviii. 1 by no necessity refer to the duration of the famine, but most naturally date back to the removal of Elijah to Zarephath, xvii. 8 ff.; compare the same “many days” in ver. 15, where indeed a variation is “for a full year”):<b> and again he prayed</b> (see above),<b> and the heavens gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit</b> (which she is accustomed to bear).
