<p><strong> 20</strong> .] <strong> know</strong> (or, with the rec. γινωσκέτω , <em> let him know</em> , viz. the last τις , ὁ ἐπιστρέψας for his comfort, and for the encouragement of others to do the like by this proclamation of the fact), <strong> that he who converteth</strong> (not, ‘ <em> has converted</em> :’ our English present, when connected with a future, exactly gives the aor. participle. The first action is necessarily antecedent to the second, which is all that the Greek requires) <strong> a sinner from the error of his way</strong> (thus is the person converted more generally expressed than before; not only, τὸν πλανηθέντα , but any ἁμαρτωλόν ) <strong> shall save a soul from death</strong> (in eternity: the future shews that the σωτηρία spoken of is not contemporary with the ἐπιστρέψαι , but its ultimate result), <strong> and shall cover a multitude of sins</strong> (viz. by introducing the convert into that state of Christian faith, wherein all sins, past, present, and future, are forgiven and done away. See reff. and for the expression, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+31:1">Psalms 31:1</span> ; Neh 4:5 LXX. The <strong> ἁμαρτιῶν</strong> , following ἁμαρτωλόν , necessarily binds the reference to the converted, not the converters. It is not τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτοῦ (as Syr., “hideth the multitude of his sins”), because the Apostle wishes to put in its most striking <em> abstract</em> light the good deed thus done. The objection (Whitby) that thus we should have a tautology, the saving of his soul including the covering of his sins, is entirely obviated by this latter consideration: even without Wiesinger’s reply, that “the words carry on further the <strong> σώσει ψυχήν</strong> , and state the ground of that salvation.” The idea that they are the sins of the converter (Zacharias <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:0">Ephesians 1:0</span> ad Bed., Erasmus, Whitby, Hammond, al.) is thus as abhorrent from the context, as it is generally repugnant to apostolic teaching: cf. on the whole, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:8">1 Peter 4:8</span> . “Commendat,” says Calvin, “fratrum correctionem ab effectu, ut majore studio in eam intenti simus”).
