<b> 6.]</b><i> Third class of sins: condemning the innocent.</i><b> Ye condemned, ye murdered the just man</b> (these words are probably spoken generally, the singular being collective. “<i>The</i><b> just</b><i> man,</i>” not merely “<i>the innocent man;</i>” it’ is his justice itself which provokes the enmity and cruelty of the<i> rich</i>. It has been usual to refer these words to the condemnation and execution of Christ. But there is surely nothing in the context to indicate this, further than that such a particular case may be included in the general charge, as its most notorious example. I cannot see, with Huther, how the<i> present</i> tense, “<i>doth not resist,</i>” makes against this; for any how we must suppose a change of sense before the<i> present</i> can be introduced: and then it may as well be a description of Christ’s patient endurance, or of His present long-suffering, as of the present meekness of the [generic]<i> just man</i>. But I prefer the latter, and with it the other reference throughout):<b> he</b> (the<i> just man</i>)<b> doth not resist you</b> (the behaviour of the just under your persecutions is ever that ‘of meekness and submission. This last clause serves as a note of transition to what follows. So Herder remarks, as cited by Wiesinger: “And thus we have as it were standing before us the slain and unresisting righteous man, when lo the curtain falls: Be patient, brethren, wait!” See, on the whole sense, Amos ii. 6, 7; v. 12; and the description in Wisd. ii. 6–20).
