<p><strong> 1 6</strong> .] <em> Denunciation of woe on the rich in this world</em> . These verses need not necessarily be addressed (as Huther) to the same persons as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:13">James 4:13</span> ff. Indeed the <strong> ἄγε νῦν</strong> repeated seems to indicate a fresh beginning. Commentators have differed as to whether this denunciation has for its object, or not, exhortation to repentance. I believe the right answer to be, much as De Wette, that in the outward form indeed the words contain no such exhortation: but that we are bound to believe all such triumphant denunciation to have but one ultimate view, that of grace and mercy to those addressed. That such does not here appear, is owing chiefly to the close proximity of judgment, which the writer has before him. Calvin then is in the main right, when he says, “Falluntur qui Jacobum hic exhortari ad pœnitentiam divites putant: mihi simplex magis denuntiatio judicii Dei videtur, qua eos terrere voluit <em> absque spe veniæ</em> ,” except in those three last rather characteristic words.</p>
