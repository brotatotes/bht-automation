<b> 1.]</b> Before commenting on the truths here declared, it is absolutely necessary to discuss the one term on which the whole turns: viz. THE WORD. This term is used by St. John<i> without explanation</i>, as bearing a meaning well known to his readers. The enquiry concerning that meaning must therefore be conducted on<i> historical</i>, not on mere<i> grammatical</i> grounds. And the most important elements of the enquiry are, (I.)<i> the usage of speech as regards the term</i>, by St. John himself and other biblical writers: and (II.)<i> the purely historical information</i> which we possess on the<i> ideas attached to the term</i>.<br><br> The simplicity of this expression is no doubt directed against’ the Docete of the Apostle’s time, who maintained that the Word only apparently took human nature. Therefore he says, absolutely and literally<b> became</b> flesh:—see 1 John iv. 2. The word rendered “<i>dwelt</i>,” properly is<i> ‘sojourned</i>,’ or<b> ‘tabernacled,’</b> in us. There is no reference to the flesh being the<i> tabernacle</i> of the Spirit;—but the word is one technically used in Scripture to import the<i> dwelling of God among men</i>.<b> us]</b> “men, who are flesh,” Bengel.
