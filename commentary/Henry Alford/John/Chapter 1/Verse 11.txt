<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <strong> τὰ ἴδια</strong> here cannot well mean <em> the world</em> , or <strong> οἱ ἴδιοι</strong> <em> mankind in general:</em> it would be difficult to point out any Scripture usage to justify such a meaning. But abundance of passages bear out the meaning which makes <strong> τὰ ἴδια</strong> His own inheritance or possession, i.e. Judæa; and <strong> οἱ ἴδιοι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the Jews: compare especially the parable <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:33">Matthew 21:33</span> ff., and Sir 24:7 ff. And thus <strong> ἦλθεν</strong> forms a nearer step in the approach to the declaration in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span> . He <em> came to</em> His own.
