<b> 11.]</b> It is impossible to express this verse in terse and short English. In the original, the first<b> his own</b> is neuter—<i>his own things</i>, or<i> possessions</i>: the second, masculine,<i> his own people</i>. If we enquire for the sense,<b> his own things</b> here cannot well mean<i> the world</i>, or<b> his own people</b> mankind in general: it would be difficult to point out any Scripture usage to justify such a meaning. But abundance of passages bear out the meaning which makes the former His own inheritance or possession, i.e. Judæa; and the latter, the Jews; compare especially the parable Matt. xxi. 33 ff.; and Ecclus. xxiv. 7 ff. And thus<b> came</b> forms a nearer step in the approach to the declaration in ver. 14. He<i> came</i> to His own.
