 12. ] The  ὅσοι  … primarily refers to the ἐκλογή  among the Jews who have just been spoken of: but also, by implication, being opposed to both  ὁ κόσμος and  οἱ ἴδιοι  , the ἐκλογή in all the world.
	 ἔλαβον  =   παρέλαβον above as many as recognized Him as that which He was the Word of God and Light of men.

Joh 8:51 ).
