<b> 13.]</b> The Jews grounded their claim to be children of God on their descent from Abraham. St. John here negatives any such claim, and asserts the exclusive divine birth of all who become children of God by faith. It is to be noticed that the conjunctions here are not merely disjunctive ones, which would necessitate the ranging the clauses as co-ordinate and parallel, but exclusive ones, which rise in climax from one clause to another,— ‘<i>not</i> of blood,<i> nor yet</i> of the will of the flesh,<i> nor yet</i> of the will of man,<i> but</i> of God.’-Many Interpreters have seen in “<i>the will of man</i>” (the word in the original is that expressing the<i> man</i> as distinguished from the<i> woman</i>) the male, and in “<i>the will of the flesh</i>” the female side of human concupiscence (so Augustine, Theophylact, &c.); or in the former the higher and more conscious, in the latter the lower and animal side (Bleek, Luthardt). But both these interpretations seem to be objectionable.
