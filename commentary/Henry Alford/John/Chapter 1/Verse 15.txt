<b> 15.]</b> The testimony of John, so important as being the fulfilment of the very object for which he was<i> sent from God</i>, is in this prologue ranged, so to speak, parallel with the assertions and testimony of the Evangelist himself. So that this verse does not interrupt the train of thought, but confirms by this important testimony the assertion “<i>the Word became flesh</i>,” shewing that John<i> bore witness to His pre-existence</i>. Then (ver. 16) the “<i>full of grace and truth</i>” is again taken up. Euthymius paraphrases: “Even if I,” says the Evangelist, “may perhaps seem to some not worthy of credit, yet before me John witnesseth to His Godhead, that John, whose name is great and celebrated among all the Jews.”
