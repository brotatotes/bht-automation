<b> 15.]</b> The testimony of John, so important as being the fulfilment of the very object for which he was<i> sent from God</i>, is in this prologue ranged, so to speak, parallel with the assertions and testimony of the Evangelist himself. So that this verse does not interrupt the train of thought, but confirms by this important testimony the assertion “<i>the Word became flesh</i>,” shewing that John<i> bore witness to His pre-existence</i>. Then (ver. 16) the “<i>full of grace and truth</i>” is again taken up. Euthymius paraphrases: “Even if I,” says the Evangelist, “may perhaps seem to some not worthy of credit, yet before me John witnesseth to His Godhead, that John, whose name is great and celebrated among all the Jews.”<br><br><b> beareth witness</b>,<i> present</i>, for solemnity—as part of the testimony to Him, not only once given, but still sub-sisting.<br><br><b> crieth</b> (in the original,<i> perfect</i>, being, in sense,<i> present</i>,<i> ‘hath cried,’</i> so that the voice is still sounding), see ch. vii. 37: “John crieth out with confidence and joy, as becometh a great herald.” Bengel.<br><br><b> This was he of whom I spake...</b>] This reference to a former saying seems to shew, as indeed would appear from the announcement of his own office by the Baptist, that he had uttered these words in the power of the Spirit concerning Him whose forerunner he was<i> before he saw and recognized Him in the flesh.</i> Then,<i> on doing so</i>, he exclaimed,<b> This was He of whom I spake</b>, &c. This view seems to be borne out. by his own statement, ver. 33, and by the order of the narrative in Matt. iii. 11, 12, 13.<br><br><b> cometh after me]</b> In point of<i> time</i>; not of<i> birth</i>, merely or principally, nor of<i> commencement of official life</i>: but, inasmuch as John was His<i> Forerunner</i>, on account of official<i> position</i>.<br><br><b> taketh place before me]</b> This expression,<b> taketh place</b>, represents one, in the original, very difficult to render in English. It is the same word as that rendered<i> “hath been made”</i> in ver. 8:<i> hath come to be, is constituted.</i> The A.V.,<i> “is preferred,”</i> would be very suitable, setting forth the advancement to official dignity before which John’s office waned and decreased (ch. iii. 30), which took place even while John’s course was being fulfilled: but the objection to<i> ‘preferred’</i> is, its possible ambiguity: the word to<i> prefer</i> meaning to<i> esteem more highly</i>, as well as to<i> advance or promote</i>, which is the sense required here. Even Dr. Johnson has fallen into the mistake of quoting this very passage, in his Dictionary, as an instance of the sense “to love more than another.”<br><br><b> because</b> (or,<b> for</b>, but better because)<b> He</b><i> was</i> (not<i> “became”</i> or<i> “was made,”</i> but as in ver. 1) before me; i.e. ‘He<i> existed</i>, was in being, before me.’ The question raised by some, whether it is probable that the Baptist had, or expressed such views of the pre-existence of Christ, is not one for us to deal with, in the face of so direct a testimony as is given to the<i> fact</i>, here and in ch. iii, 27 ff. In all probability, the Evangelist was himself a disciple of the Baptist: and if he has given us, as compared with the other Evangelists, a fuller and somewhat differing account of his testimony to Christ, it is because his means of information were ampler than those of the other Evangelists. The questioners seem to forget that the Baptist was divinely raised up and commissioned,<i> and full of the Holy Ghost, and spoke in that power;</i> his declarations were not therefore merely conclusions which he had arrived at by natural means,—the study of the prophecies, &c.: but<i> inspirations and revelations of the Spirit</i>.
