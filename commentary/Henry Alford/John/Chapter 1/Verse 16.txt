<b> 16.]</b> Origen blames Heracleon for terminating the testimony of John at the end of ver. 17, and makes it continue to the end of ver. 18. But it can hardly be that his testimony extends beyond ver. 15, for<b> all we</b> (in ver. 16) would bear no very definite meaning in his mouth, and the assertions in ver. 17 are alien from the character of the Baptist, belonging as they do to the more mature development of Christian doctrines. I cannot doubt that this and the following verses<i> belong to the Evangelist</i>, and are a carrying onwards of his declarations concerning the divine Word.<br><br> Ver. 15 is not parenthetical, but confirmatory of ver. 14, and this verse<i> grounds itself on the fact of ver. 14, corroborated by the testimony of ver. 15,—that He dwelt among us, and that we saw His glory, full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><b> his fulness</b> is<i> that of which He was</i><b> full</b>, ver. 14,<br><br><b> all we]</b> All who believe on Him; see ver. 12.<br><br><b> received, and...]</b> ‘Our relation to Him has been that of récipients out of His fulness, and the thing received has been’....<br><br><b> grace for grace]</b> The ancient interpretation,<i> the New Covenant instead of the Old</i> (Euthymius), is certainly wrong, for the<b> received</b> is spoken entirely of<i> the times of the Incarnate Word:</i> and besides,<i> the law</i> and<i> grace</i> are distinctly<i> opposed</i> to one another in the next verse.<br><br> The preposition rendered<b> for</b> (<i>instead of</i>) is properly used of any thing which<i> supersedes</i> another, or occupies its place. This is in fact its ordinary usage when<i> exchange</i> is spoken of: the possession of the thing gotten succeeds to, supersedes, the possession of the thing given in exchange, and I possess one thing<i> instead of</i> (or,<i> for</i>) another. ‘Thus also we have received<b> grace for grace</b>,<i> continual accessions of grace</i>; new grace coming upon and superseding the former.
