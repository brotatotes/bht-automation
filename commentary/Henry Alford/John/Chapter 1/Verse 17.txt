<b> 17.]</b> The connexion of this verse with the foregoing lies in the words<b> his fulness</b> (ver. 16), and<b> in grace and truth</b> (ver. 14). ‘We received from His fulness continual additions of grace,<i> because that fulness is not, like the law, a positive enactment, finite and circumscribed</i>, of which it could be said that it<b> was given</b>, but the<i> bringing in of grace and truth</i>, which<b> came</b> (came in, came to pass) by Jesus Christ.’ The<b> fulness</b> of Christ is set against the<i> narrowness of positive enactment</i> in the law. The distinction must not be lost sight of, nor denied, as Lücke attempts to do: for Bengel truly observes: “No philosopher places his words so accurately, and observes their minute differences, as John, especially in this chapter.”
