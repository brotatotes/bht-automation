<b> 18.]</b> The connexion is: ‘Moses could not give out of the<i> fulness</i> of grace and truth, for he had no<i> immediate</i> sight of God, and no man can have: there is but One who can<i> declare</i> God, the<i> only-begotten Son</i>, who is no mere<i> man</i>, but abides in the bosom of the Father.’ The<i> sight of God</i> here meant, is not only bodily sight (though of that it is true, see Exod. xxxiii. 20: 1 Tim. vi. 16), but<i> intuitive</i> and<i> infallible knowledge</i>, which enables him who has it to declare the nature and will of God; see ch. iii. 11; vi. 46; xiv. 7.<br><br> The Evangelist speaks in this verse in accordance with the sayings of the Alexandrine philosophy, whose phraseology he has adopted:<i> Who hath seen Him, that he might tell us?</i> Ecclus. xliii. 31.<br><br><b> the only-begotten Son]</b> A remarkable various reading,<b> the only-begotten God</b>, occurs here in many of our oldest MSS., versions, and Fathers. The evidence for and against it is given in full in my Gr. Test. (edn. 6.) It seems to have arisen from a confusion of the contracted forms of writing the words “<i>Son</i>” and “<i>God</i>” in the Greek: the former being in our ancient MSS. written ΥC, the latter θC. The question, which reading to adopt, is one which, in the balance of authorities, must be provisionally decided by the consideration that, as far as we can see, we should be introducing much harshness into the sentence, and a new and strange term into Scripture, by adopting<b> only-begotten God</b>: a consequence which ought to have<i> no weight whatever where authority is overpowering</i>, but may fairly be weighed where this is not so. I therefore retain the commonly received reading,<b> only-begotten Son.</b><br><br><b> which is in the bosom]</b> ‘The expression must not be understood as referring to the custom of reclining<i> on the bosom</i>, as in ch. xiii, 23: for by this explanation confusion is introduced into the imagery, and the real depth of the truth hidden. The expression signifies, as Chrysostom observes,<i> Kindred and oneness of essence</i>:—and is derived from the fond and intimate union of children and parents. The<i> present, which</i><b> is</b>, as in ch. iti. 18, is used to signify<i> essential truth</i>, without any particular regard to time.<br><br><b> he]</b> In the original this pronoun is very marked: He, and none else: an emphatic exclusive expression.<br><br><b> declared]</b> Better than<i> ‘hath declared,</i> as A.V. On the sense, see Matt. xi. 27.
