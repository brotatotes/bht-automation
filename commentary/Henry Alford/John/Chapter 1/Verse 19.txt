It is an interesting enquiry, what this usage denotes as to the author or date of our Gospel. Prof. Bleek has satisfactorily shewn that no inference can be deduced from it<i> against the Jewish origin</i> of the author, as some have endeavoured to do; but it is rather confirmatory of the belief that the Gospel was written after the Jews had ceased to be politically a nation,—and among Gentiles;—the author himself contemplating these last as his readers.<br><br><b> priests and Levites]</b> This was a<i> formal deputation</i>;—priests and Levites, constituting the two classes of persons employed ahout the service of the temple (see Josh. iii. 3), are sent (Matt. xxi. 23) officially to enquire into the pretensions of the new Teacher (ver. 25), who had collected about him such multitudes (Matt. iii. 5), and had awakened popular expectation that he was the Messiah (Luke iii. 15).<br><br><b> Who art thou?]</b> The emphasis should be on the<b> thou</b>. “The question is asked with reference to the popular doubts respecting him; in an unbelieving and inquisitorial spirit,—compare Matt. iii. 7 ff., which had already taken place.
