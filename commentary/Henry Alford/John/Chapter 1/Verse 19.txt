<b> 19. the Jews]</b> St. John alone of the Evangelists uses this expression;—principally as designating<i> the chiefs of the Jewish people</i>, the members of the Sanhedrim. It is an interesting enquiry, what this usage denotes as to the author or date of our Gospel. Prof. Bleek has satisfactorily shewn that no inference can be deduced from it<i> against the Jewish origin</i> of the author, as some have endeavoured to do; but it is rather confirmatory of the belief that the Gospel was written after the Jews had ceased to be politically a nation,—and among Gentiles;—the author himself contemplating these last as his readers.
