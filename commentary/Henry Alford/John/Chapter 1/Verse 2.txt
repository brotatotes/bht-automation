<b> 2.]</b> In order to direct the mind to the difference (in unity) between this “Word” and “God,” St. John recalls the reader’s attention to the two first clauses of ver. 1, which he now combines, in order to pass on to the<i> creative work</i>, which distinctly belongs to the “Word.” Thus also this verse fixes the reference of him in ver. 3, which might otherwise, after the mention of “God,” have seemed ambiguous.<b></b><b> 3.] All things</b> (1 Cor. viii. 6. Col. i. 16), equivalent to “<i>the world</i>,” ver. 10. This parallelism of itself refutes the Socinian interpretation of “<i>all things</i>,” “all Christian graces and virtues, ‘the whole moral world.’ But the history of the term “Logos” forbids such an explanation entirely. For Philo says, “<i>Thou shalt find that the cause of the world is God, by whom it was made; the matter, the four elements, out of which it was composed</i>:<b> the instrument, the Word of God, through whom it was constituted:”</b> see also Col. i. 16, and Heb. i. 2. Olshausen observes, that we never read in Scripture that ‘Christ made the world;’ but ‘the Father made the world<i> through</i> the Son,’ or ‘the world was made<i> by</i> the Father, and<i> through</i> the Son:’ because the Son<i> never works of Himself</i>, but always<i> as the revelation of the Father</i>; His work is the Father’s<i> will</i>, and the Father has no Will, except the Son, who is<i> all His will</i> (in whom He is well pleased). The Christian Fathers rightly therefore rejected the semi-Arian formula, ‘The Son was begotten by an act of the Father’s will;’ for He is<i> that Will Himself</i>.<br><br><b> and without him]</b> This addition is not merely a Hebraistic parallelism, but a distinct denial of the eternity and uncreatedness of matter as held by the Gnostics. They set<i> matter</i>, as a separate existence, over against God, and made it the origin of evil:—but St. John excludes any such notion. Nothing was mado without Him (the Word); all matter, and<i> implicitly</i> evil itself, in the deep and inscrutable purposes of creation (for it was not in the beginning, but was made),<b> was made through Him.</b><br><br> The punctuation at the end of the verse is uncertain, if we regard solely manuscript authority. Some of our MSS. set a full stop at “<i>was not any thing made</i>:” so that the sense of the words following would be, “<i>That which hath been made by (or in) him was life</i>.’ The question must however be determined by the sense of the passage, which is rendered weak, and inconsistent with analogy, by adopting this punctuation:—<i>weak</i>, because in that case we must render ‘That which hath been made by Him was life (i. e. having life), and that life was the light of men;’ but.<i> how</i> was that life, i.e. that living creation which was made by Him, the light of men?—<i>inconsistent with analogy</i>, for St. John’s usage of beginning a sentence with “<i>in</i>” or “<i>by</i>” and a demonstrative pron. should have its weight: compare ch. xiii. 35; xv. 8; xvi. 26: 1 John ii. 3, 4, 5; iii. (8,) 10, 16, 19, 24; iv. 2 al. fr. Compare also 1 John ii. 4,—ib. iii. 5. I have determined therefore for the ordinary punctuation. It is said to have been first adopted owing to an abuse of the passage by the Macedonian heretics, who maintained that if the exclusion ( “<i>without him was not any thing made that was made</i>”) was<i> complete</i>, the Holy Spirit can also not have been without His creating power, i.e. was created by Him. But this would be refuted otherwise, for the Holy Spirit “<i>was</i>,” and “<i>was not made</i>.”
