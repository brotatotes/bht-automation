<b> 2.]</b> In order to direct the mind to the difference (in unity) between this “Word” and “God,” St. John recalls the reader’s attention to the two first clauses of ver. 1, which he now combines, in order to pass on to the<i> creative work</i>, which distinctly belongs to the “Word.” Thus also this verse fixes the reference of him in ver. 3, which might otherwise, after the mention of “God,” have seemed ambiguous.<b></b><b> 3.] All things</b> (1 Cor. viii. 6. Col. i. 16), equivalent to “<i>the world</i>,” ver. 10. This parallelism of itself refutes the Socinian interpretation of “<i>all things</i>,” “all Christian graces and virtues, ‘the whole moral world.’ But the history of the term “Logos” forbids such an explanation entirely. For Philo says, “<i>Thou shalt find that the cause of the world is God, by whom it was made; the matter, the four elements, out of which it was composed</i>:<b> the instrument, the Word of God, through whom it was constituted:”</b> see also Col. i. 16, and Heb. i. 2. Olshausen observes, that we never read in Scripture that ‘Christ made the world;’ but ‘the Father made the world<i> through</i> the Son,’ or ‘the world was made<i> by</i> the Father, and<i> through</i> the Son:’ because the Son<i> never works of Himself</i>, but always<i> as the revelation of the Father</i>; His work is the Father’s<i> will</i>, and the Father has no Will, except the Son, who is<i> all His will</i> (in whom He is well pleased). The Christian Fathers rightly therefore rejected the semi-Arian formula, ‘The Son was begotten by an act of the Father’s will;’ for He is<i> that Will Himself</i>.
