<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] In order to direct the mind to the difference (in unity) between this λόγος and ὁ θεός , John recalls the reader’s attention to the two first clauses of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span> , which he now combines, in order to pass on to the <em> creative work</em> , which distinctly belongs to the λόγος . Thus also this verse fixes the reference of αὐτοῦ in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span> , which might otherwise, after the mention of θεός , have seemed ambiguous.</p>
