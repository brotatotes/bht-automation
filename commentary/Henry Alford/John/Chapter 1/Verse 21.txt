<b> 21.]</b> Our earliest MS. (the Vatican) reads here, “<i>What then art</i><b> thou</b>?” equivalent to<i> What sayest thou of thyself</i>? ver. 22.<br><br><b> Art thou Elias?]</b> The whole appearance of John remindes them of Elias:—see Matt. iii. 4, and compare 2 Kings i. 8. Besides, his announcement that<i> the Kingdom of God was at hand</i>, naturally led them to the prophecy Mal. iv. 5. Lightfoot cites from the Rabbinical books testimonies, that the Jews expected a general purification or baptism before the coming of the Messiah (from Ezek. xxxvi. 25, 26, and Zech. xiii. 1), and that it would be administered by Elias.<br><br><b> And he saith, I am not]</b> The right explanation of this answer seems to be the usual one,—that the deputation asked the question in a mistaken and superstitions sense, meaning Elias bodily come down from heaven, who was expected to forerun and anoint the Messias. (Our Lord seems to refer to the same extravagant notion in Matt. xi. 14,<b> If ye will receive it,</b><i> this is Elias, which shall come</i>.)<i> In this sense</i>, John was not Elias; nor indeed in any other sense,<i> was</i> he Elias;—but only (Luke i. 17)<i> in the spirit and power of Elias.</i><b> Art thou the prophet?]</b> From the prophecy of Moses, Deut. xviii. 15, 18, the Jews expected some particular prophet to arise,—distinct from the Messiah (this distinction however was not held by all, see ch. vi. 14),—whose coming was, like that of Elias, intimately connected with that of the Messiah Himself: see ch. vii. 40, 41. In Matt. xvi. 14 we have ‘<i>Jeremiah, or one of the prophets</i>,’ apparently spoken as representing this expected prophet. There seem to have been various opinions about him;—all however agreeing in this, that he was to be<i> one of the old prophets raised from the dead</i> (see also 2 Macc. ii. 1–8). This John was not: and he therefore answers this also in the negative.
