 21. ]  σὺ οὖν τί  ; equivalent to τί λέγεις περὶ σεαυτοῦ ; John 1:22 .
	 Ἡλίας εἶ  ; ] The whole appearance of John reminded them of Elias: see Matthew 3:4 , and compare 2 Kings 1:8 . Besides, his announcement that  the Kingdom of God was at hand , naturally led them to the prophecy Malachi 4:5 , Lightfoot cites from the Rabbinical books testimonies that the Jews expected a general purification or baptism before the coming of the Messiah (from Ezekiel 36:25-26 , and Zec 13:1 ), and that it would be administered by Elias.
	 κ  .   λ  .   Οὐκ εἰμί ] The right explanation of this answer seems to be the usual one, that the deputation asked the question in a mistaken and superstitious sense, meaning Elias bodily come down from heaven, who was expected to forerun and anoint the Messias. (Our Lord seems to refer to the same extravagant notion in Matthew 11:14 ,  εἰ θέλετε δέξασθαι  , αὐτός ἐστιν Ἡλ . ὁ μέλλων ἔρχεσθαι .)  In this sense , John was not Elias; nor indeed in any other sense,  was he Elias: but only ( Luk 1:17 ) ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει Ἡλίου .
	 ὁ προφ  .   εἶ σύ  ; ] From the prophecy of Moses, Deuteronomy 18:15 ; Deuteronomy 18:18 , the Jews expected some particular prophet to arise, distinct from the Messiah (this distinction however was not held by all, see ch. Joh 6:14 ), whose coming was, like that of Elias, intimately connected with that of the Messiah Himself: see ch. John 7:40-41 . In Mat 16:14 we have ‘Jeremiah, or one of the prophets’ apparently = this expected prophet. There seem to have been various opinions about him; all however agreeing in this, that he was to be  one of the old prophets raised from the dead (see also 2Ma 2:1-8 ). This John  was not: and he therefore answers this also in the negative.
