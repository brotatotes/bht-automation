The insertions, “<i>it is</i>,” and “<i>is preferred before me</i>,” have been made by some one not aware of the meaning, and wishing to square the verse with vv. 15, 30. The answer of the Baptist seems not to correspond to the question in ver. 25. This was noticed as early as Heracleon (Century II), who said,<i> John answers the deputation from the Pharisees not with reference to what they asked, but what he himself chose.</i> This however is impugned at some length by Origen, but not on very convincing grounds. The truth seems to have been apprehended by Olshausen,—that the declaration of John that the Messiah was standing among them at that moment unknown to them,<i> was an answer to their question demanding a legitimation of his prophetic claims;—a sign</i> that he was sent from God:—see ch. ii. 18.

In repeating this saying at other times (see Matt. iii. 11 and parallel places), the Baptist plainly states of the Messiah, that he should baptize them with the Holy Ghost (and fire), as here in ver. 33.
