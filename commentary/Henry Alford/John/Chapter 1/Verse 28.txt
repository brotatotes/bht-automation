<b> 28.]</b> The common reading,<i> Bethabara</i>, is owing to a conjecture of Origen, the grounds of which he thus states:—<i> “We are not ignorant, that in almost all our copies it is stated, ‘these things were done in Bethany;’</i> and this seems to have been so read even before our time: for I have read it so in Heracleon. But I am persuaded that we ought not to read<i> Bethany, but Bethabara</i>; for I have been on the spot, in my desire to track the footsteps of Jesus and of His Apostles and of the prophets. Bethany, as the Evangelist himself says, is only fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem, far away from the river Jordan, about 180 furlongs, roughly stated. Nor is there any place near the Jordan of the same name as<i> Bethany</i>: but<i> they say that a place is shewn</i> on the bunks of the Jordan called<i> Bethabara</i>, where they relate that John baptized.” He goes on to shew from the<i> etymology of the names</i> that it must have been Bethabara; an argument which modern criticism will not much esteem. It will be seen that his testimony is decisive for the universality and authority of the reading<b> Bethany</b>, while for the other he only produces a tradition, and that only at second-hand:<i> ‘they say</i> that such a place is shewn.’ That no Bethany beyond Jordan was known in his time proves but little;—for 300 eventful years had changed the face of Palestine since these events, and the names and sites of many obscure places may have been forgotten. I abstain from enumerating modern conjectures on the identity of the two, or the etymology of the names, as being indecisive and unprofitable. The objection of Paulus, that<i> beyond Jordan</i> the Sanhedrim had no authority, appears not to be founded in fact.
