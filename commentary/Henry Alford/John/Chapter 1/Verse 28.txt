<b> 28.]</b> The common reading,<i> Bethabara</i>, is owing to a conjecture of Origen, the grounds of which he thus states:—<i> “We are not ignorant, that in almost all our copies it is stated, ‘these things were done in Bethany;’</i> and this seems to have been so read even before our time: for I have read it so in Heracleon. But I am persuaded that we ought not to read<i> Bethany, but Bethabara</i>; for I have been on the spot, in my desire to track the footsteps of Jesus and of His Apostles and of the prophets. Bethany, as the Evangelist himself says, is only fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem, far away from the river Jordan, about 180 furlongs, roughly stated. Nor is there any place near the Jordan of the same name as<i> Bethany</i>: but<i> they say that a place is shewn</i> on the bunks of the Jordan called<i> Bethabara</i>, where they relate that John baptized.” He goes on to shew from the<i> etymology of the names</i> that it must have been Bethabara; an argument which modern criticism will not much esteem. It will be seen that his testimony is decisive for the universality and authority of the reading<b> Bethany</b>, while for the other he only produces a tradition, and that only at second-hand:<i> ‘they say</i> that such a place is shewn.’ That no Bethany beyond Jordan was known in his time proves but little;—for 300 eventful years had changed the face of Palestine since these events, and the names and sites of many obscure places may have been forgotten. I abstain from enumerating modern conjectures on the identity of the two, or the etymology of the names, as being indecisive and unprofitable. The objection of Paulus, that<i> beyond Jordan</i> the Sanhedrim had no authority, appears not to be founded in fact.<br><br> The question whether this testimony of the Baptist is identical with that given by the other three Evangelists, especially by St. Luke (iii. 16), is, after all that has been said on it, not of great importance. The whole series of transactions here recorded, from ver. 15 onwards, certainly happened<i> after</i> the baptism of our Lord;—for before that event John<i> did not know Him as He that was to come</i>: and<i> “standeth among you,”</i> ver. 26, shews that<i> he had so recognized Him</i> (see below on<i> “the next day”</i>): whereas the testimony in Luke iii. 16 and parallel places, is as certainly given<i> before</i> the baptism. But since the great end of John’s mission was to proclaim Him who was coming after him, it is not only probable, but absolutely necessary to suppose, that he should have delivered this testimony<i> often</i>, and under varying circumstances:<i> before</i> the baptism, in the form given by St. Luke, “<i>One mightier than I cometh</i>,”&c., and<i> after</i> it in this form, “<i>This is He of whom I said</i>,”&c. (ver. 15), where his former testimony is distinctly referred to. And among John’s disciples and the multitudes who frequented his baptism, many reports of such his sayings would naturally be current. So that there is neither a real nor even an apparent contradiction between John and the other Evangelists.<br><br> It is a far more important question,<i> in what part of this narration the forty days’ Temptation is to be inserted.</i> From ver. 19 to ch. ii. 1 there is an unbroken sequence of days distinctly marked. Since then ver. 19 must be understood as happening after the baptism, it must have happened<i> after the Temptation</i> also. And in this supposition there is not the slightest difficulty. But when we have made it, it still remains to say whether at that time our Lord had returned from the Temptation or not. The general opinion of Harmonists has been, that the approach of Jesus to John in ver. 29<i> was His return after the Temptation.</i> But this I think questionable, on account of the “<i>standeth among you</i>,” ver. 26; which I can only understand literally. I therefore believe-–— that the return from the Temptation to Bethany beyond Jordan had taken place before the deputation arrived.
