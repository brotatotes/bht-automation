<b> 29.] The next day (the morrow).</b> Those who wish to introduce the Temptation between vv. 28 and 29, interpret it, ‘<i>on some day after.’</i> Thus Euthym., “<i>the next day</i>; that is, the next after his return from the wilderness.” But this sense, although certainly found in the Old Testament,—see Gen. xxx. 33 ( ‘<i>in time to come</i>,’ Heb. “<i>to-morrow</i>”),—is not according to the usage of St. John (see ch. vi. 22; xii. 12), and would be quite alien from the precision of this whole portion of the narrative, which, ver. 40, specifies even the hours of the day. I understand it therefore literally, both here and. in vv. 35 and 44.<br><br><b> coming unto him]</b> It is not said<i> whence</i>, or<i> why</i>, or whether for the purpose of an interview, or not;<i> the fact</i> merely is related, for the sake of the testimony which follows. I mention this, because on these points difficulties have been raised.<br><br><b> Behold the Lamb of God]</b> This is one of the most important and difficult sayings in the New Testament.<i> The question to be answered</i> is, In calling Jesus by so definite a name as<b> the Lamb of God</b>,<i> to what</i> did John refer? And this question is intimately connected with that of the meaning of the following words,<b> which taketh away the sin of the world.</b><br><br> (a) The title must refer to<i> some “known and particular lamb</i>, and cannot be a mere figure for a just and holy man, as some suppose. It is inconceivable, that<i> the Lamb of God</i> should, in a testimony so precise and formal as this of the Baptist, be<i> nothing but an hyperbole</i>, and that one<i> wholly unprecedented</i>, and to his hearers<i> unintelligible</i>. Had no doctrinal considerations been at stake, we may safely say that this interpretation would never have been proposed. In its bearing on the latter clause of the verse, it is equally untenable. These interpreters make<i> which taketh away the sin of the world</i> to mean, “who shall, though innocent, have, throughout his life, grievous experience of the wickedness of men, but shall, like a lamb, bear the evils inflicted upon him with a patient and gentle mind” (Gabler); or, “He shall remove the sins of men, i.e. wickedness, out of the earth.” ‘The first of these meanings of the verb rendered “<i>takeaway</i>” is<i> altogether without example</i>. The second, though common enough in other connexions, is never found in connexion with “<i>sin</i>.” The common sense account of this part of the matter is:—John wished to point out Jesus as<i> the Messiah</i>: he designates Him as<i> the lamb of God</i>; he therefore referred to some definite lamb,—revealed by God, sent by God, pleasing to God, or in some meaning especially,<b> of God</b>.<i> Whence did this idea come?</i><br><br> (b) Can John have referred to the<i> paschal lamb</i>? Further than the very use of the name brings in with it the general typical use of the animal, and thus this particular use may lie in the background,<i> I think not</i>,—and for this reason;—The<i> ruling idea</i> in the paschal sacrifice has no connexion, in any sense of the words, with<i> taking away sin</i>. However, by the light<i> now</i> thrown back on it since the Spirit has opened the things of Christ,<i> we</i> discern this typical meaning in the sprinkling of the blood (see 1 Cor. v. 7),—in the<i> Jewish mind</i>, no mention being made of sin or the removing of sin in any connexion with the paschal lamb, the two could not be brought forward, in such an announcement as this, in close connexion with one another.<br><br> (c) Can the reference be to the<i> lamb of the daily morning and evening sacrifice</i>? or to the<i> sacrificial lamb</i> generally? With’ the same reservation as above,<i> I think not</i>: for (1) this expression is too definite to have so general and miscellaneous a reference; (2) of many animals which were used for sacrifice, the lamb was<i> only one</i>, and that one<i> not by any means so prominent as. to serve as a type for the whole</i>: and (3) the lamb (with only two exceptions, Levit. iv. 32: Num. vi. 14, in both which cases it was to be a<i> female</i>, as if for express distinction from the ordinary use of the lamb)<i> was never used for a sin-offering</i>, properly so called and known. The<i> question ts not</i>, whether Christ be not typified by all these offerings, which we<i> now know</i> to be the case (1 Pet. i. 19 al.), but whether<i> the Baptist is likely to have referred to them in such words as these.</i> (d) There remains but one reference, and that is, to<i> the prophetic announcement in Isa</i>. liii. 7. The whole of that latter<br><br>-–— section of Isaiah, as before remarked on ver. 23, is Messianic, and was so understood by the Jews (see my Hulsean Lectures for 1841, pp. 62–66). We have there the servant of God (the Messiah) compared to<i> a lamb brought to the slaughter</i> (liii. 7), and it is said of Him (ib. ver. 4), “He hath borne our griefs (in the LXX, “beareth our sins”) and carried our sorrows”—ver. 5, “He was wounded for our transgressions”—ver. 6, “The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all” (in the LXX, “delivered Him to our sins”)—ver. 8, “He was cut off out of the land of the living, for the transgression of my people was He stricken”—ver. 12, “He bare the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors” (in the LXX., “and was delivered because of their iniquities”). So that here, and here only, we have the connexion of which we are in search,—between<i> the lamb</i>, and the<i> bearing or taking away of sin</i>,—expressly stated, so that it could be formally referred to in a testimony like the present. And I have therefore no doubt that<i> this was the reference</i>.<br><br> (e) We have now to enquire into the specific meaning of<b> which taketh away the sin of the world</b> (see above under [a]). The verb rendered taketh away answers to a Hebrew verb, which is used frequently in the O.T., in connection with<i> sin</i>, in the sense of<i> bearing its punishment</i>:—see Levit. xxiv. 15: Num. v. 31; xiv. 3: Ezek. iv. 5; xxiii, 35a]. A form of this very Greek verb is used by the LXX in the sense of taking away sin and its guilt by expiation: see in our English Bible, Levit. x. 17. The word in our verse will bear either of these meanings, or both conjoined; for if the Lamb is to suffer the burden of the sins of the world, and to take away sin and its guilt by expiation, this result must be accomplished by the<i> offering of Himself</i>.<br><br> (f) But it is objected, that this view of a suffering Messiah, and of expiation by the sufferings of<i> one</i>, was<i> alien from the Jewish expectations</i>;—and that the Baptist (see Matt. xi. 2 ff. and note) cannot himself have had any such view. But the answer to this may be found in the fact that the view, though not generally prevalent, among the Jews, was by no means unknown to many. The application by the early Jewish expositors of Isa. liii. to the Messiah, could hardly have been made, without the idea of the suffering and death of their Messiah being presented to their minds. The same would be the case in the whole sacrificial economy:—the removal of guilt (which was universally ascribed to the Messiah) by suffering and death would be familiarized to their minds. Traces of this are found in their own writings. In 2 Macc. vii. 37, 38, the last of the seven brethren thus speaks before his martyrdom:— “But I, as my brethren, offer up my body and life for the laws of our fathers, beseeching God that He would speedily be merciful unto our nation; and that thou by torments and plagues mayest confess, that He alone is God: and that in me and my brethren the wrath of the Almighty, which is justly brought upon all our nation, may cease.” And Josephus says of these same martyrs, that they were “as it were a ransom for the nation’s sin: and by means of the blood of those pious ones and the propitiation of their death, divine Providence saved afflicted Israel.” The whole history of the sacrifices and devotions of the heathen world abounds with examples of the same idea variously brought forward; and to these the better-informed among the Jews could be no strangers. And as to the Baptist himself, we must not forget that the power of the Holy Spirit which enabled him to recognize by a special sign the Redeemer, also<i> spoke in him</i>, and therefore his words would not be the result of education merely, or his own reasoning, but of that kind of intuitive perception of divine truth, which those have had who have been for any special purpose the organs of the Holy Ghost.<br><br> As regards Matt. xi. 3, the doubt on the mind of John there expressed does not appear to have touched at all on the matter now in question,—but to have rather been a form of expressing his impatience at the slow and quiet progress of Him of whom he expected greater things and a more rapid public manifestation.
