<b> 29.] The next day (the morrow).</b> Those who wish to introduce the Temptation between vv. 28 and 29, interpret it, ‘<i>on some day after.’</i> Thus Euthym., “<i>the next day</i>; that is, the next after his return from the wilderness.” But this sense, although certainly found in the Old Testament,—see Gen. xxx. 33 ( ‘<i>in time to come</i>,’ Heb. “<i>to-morrow</i>”),—is not according to the usage of St. John (see ch. vi. 22; xii. 12), and would be quite alien from the precision of this whole portion of the narrative, which, ver. 40, specifies even the hours of the day. I understand it therefore literally, both here and. in vv. 35 and 44.
