<b> 31.]</b> On the apparent discrepancy between this statement,<b> I knew him not</b>, and St. Matthew’s narrative, I have stated my view on Matt. iii, 14. Both accounts are entirely consistent with the supposition that John had been from youth upwards acquainted with our Lord, and<br><br>-–— indeed may have in his own mind believed Him to be the Christ:—but having (ver. 33)<i> a special sign appointed him</i>, by which to recognize Him as such,—until that sign was given, he, like the rest of the people (the words may be rendered,<b> I also</b>, as well as you, see ver. 26), had no certain knowledge of Him. De Wette gives the sense well: “This testimony (ver. 30) does not rest upon my long personal acquaintance with Him, but on that which happened during my work of baptizing.”<br><br><b> but that he should be made manifest]</b> Justin Martyr represents Trypho the Jew saying, “Even if Christ has been born and exists somewhere, he is unknown, and is not even conscious of his own identity, until Elias shall come and anoint him, and make him manifest to all.” But our narrative is not built upon any such Jewish belief, for it is evidently only as a<i> spiritual preparation</i>, through repentance, for the knowledge of Him, that John regarded his baptism, not as any thing making Him manifest to all.
