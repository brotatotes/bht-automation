 31. ] On the apparent discrepancy between this statement,  οὐκ ῃδειν αὐτόν  , and St. Matthew’s narrative, I have stated my view on Matthew 3:14 . Both accounts are entirely consistent with the supposition that John had been from youth upwards acquainted with our Lord, and indeed may have in his own mind believed Him to be the Christ: but having ( Joh 1:33 )  a special sign appointed him , by which to recognize Him as such, until that sign was given, he, like the rest of the people ( κἀγώ ,  I also, see Joh 1:26 ), had no certain knowledge of Him. Lücke’s whole note proceeds upon the unworthy view of the historical character of the Gospels which his school has adopted. The same may be said of Neander, Leben Jesu, pp. 86 ff.
	De Wette gives the sense well: “This testimony ( Joh 1:30 ) does not rest upon my long personal acquaintance with Him, but on that which happened during my work of baptizing.”
	 ἀλλ  ʼ   ἵνα φαν  . ] Justin Martyr represents Trypho the Jew saying, χριστὸς δὲ εἰ καὶ γεγέννηται , καὶ ἔστι που , ἄγνωστός ἐστι , καὶ οὐδὲ αὐτός πω ἑαυτὸν ἐπίσταται , οὐδὲ ἔχει δύναμίν τινα , μέχρις ἂν ἐλθὼν Ἡλίας χρίσῃ αὐτὸν καὶ  φανερόν πᾶσι ποιήσῃ  , § 8, p. 110. But our narrative is not built upon any such Jewish belief, for it is evidently only as a  spiritual preparation , through repentance, for the knowledge of Him, that John regarded his baptism, not as any thing ἐκεῖνον φανερὸν πᾶσι ποιοῦν .
	 ἐν [  τῷ ]  ὕδ ., hardly distinguishable in English from ἐν ὕδ ., but importing, ‘in the water which it is my custom to use,’ ‘in the water in which you see I do baptize.’
