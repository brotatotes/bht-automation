<b> 31.]</b> On the apparent discrepancy between this statement,<b> I knew him not</b>, and St. Matthew’s narrative, I have stated my view on Matt. iii, 14. Both accounts are entirely consistent with the supposition that John had been from youth upwards acquainted with our Lord, and<br><br>-–— indeed may have in his own mind believed Him to be the Christ:—but having (ver. 33)<i> a special sign appointed him</i>, by which to recognize Him as such,—until that sign was given, he, like the rest of the people (the words may be rendered,<b> I also</b>, as well as you, see ver. 26), had no certain knowledge of Him. De Wette gives the sense well: “This testimony (ver. 30) does not rest upon my long personal acquaintance with Him, but on that which happened during my work of baptizing.”<br><br><b> but that he should be made manifest]</b> Justin Martyr represents Trypho the Jew saying, “Even if Christ has been born and exists somewhere, he is unknown, and is not even conscious of his own identity, until Elias shall come and anoint him, and make him manifest to all.” But our narrative is not built upon any such Jewish belief, for it is evidently only as a<i> spiritual preparation</i>, through repentance, for the knowledge of Him, that John regarded his baptism, not as any thing making Him manifest to all.<br><br> The occurrence related by John happened<i> at the baptism</i> of Jesus, which is therefore here<i> pre-supposed as known</i>, Although this has been questioned, I cannot see how it can be reasonably doubted. We cannot surely suppose that such a sign was<i> twice</i> shewn. On the appearance itself, see note Matt. iii. 16. The account here given confirms the view which I have there maintained, that the appearance was confined to our Lord and the Baptist:<i> he</i> was to receive the sign, and then to testify to the others, who were not themselves yet the bearers, but the recipients of testimony:— “It was seen, in a kind of spiritual vision, by John alone.” Theodore of Mopsuestia.<br><br><b> I have beheld</b>, in reference to the sign divinely intimated to him, in the abiding fulfilment of which he now stood. So again, below, ver. 34.<br><br><b> it remained upon him]</b> By some appearance which is not described, the Holy Spirit was manifested to John as<i> not removing from Jesus again, but remaining on Him</i>. But we are not to understand that he had seen the Spirit descending on<i> others</i>, and<i> not remaining</i>; for (see ch. vii. 39; Acts i. 5; xix. 2 ff. (the gift of the Holy Spirit did not ordinarily accompany John’s baptism, but only in this one case; and its occurrence was to point out to him the Messiah.<br><br><b> the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost]</b> Here again we seem to have a reference to the cycle of narratives of the three other Gospels, for our Evangelist has not before mentioned this office of the Messiah.
