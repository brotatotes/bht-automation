<b> 34.]</b> A solemn reiteration of his testimony, after the mention of the giving of this token by Him who sent him;—<b>And I have seen (accordingly)</b>&c.<br><br> The token must have been given to the Baptist<i> by a special revelation</i>, which also revealed to him his own errand and office; so Luke iii. 2, “<i>The word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness</i>.”<br><br> The perfect tense in this verse is stronger than the present,—<b>I have seen</b> (on the perf. see above ver. 32)<b> and have borne witness</b>—it is a reference to his testimony at the time, as a thing on record in their memories, and as still continuing.<br><br><b> the Son of God]</b> See ver. 18—the<b> Word</b> made flesh, the Messiah. On the import of the descent of the Spirit<br><br> on Jesus at his baptism, I may remark, that the Personal Word, Who<i> became flesh</i> in our Lord, and was subjected to all the laws of human development in infancy, childhood, youth,—evermore in an especial degree under the leading of the Holy Spirit, by whose agency the Incarnation had taken place,—was the Recipient of this fulness of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost: and that herein consisted the real depth and propriety of this sign;—the abiding of the Spirit without measure (ch. iii. 34) on Him indicated beyond doubt that He was the<i> Word become flesh</i>—for no mere human intelligence could be thus receptive of the Holy Spirit of God;—<i>we</i> receive Him only<i> as we can</i>, only as far as our receptivity extends,—<i>by measure</i>; but HE, into the very fulness and infinite capacities of His divine Being.
