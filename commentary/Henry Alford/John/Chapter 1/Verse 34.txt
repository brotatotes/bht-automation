 34. ] A solemn reiteration of his testimony, after the mention of the giving of this token by Him who sent him;  And I have seen (  accordingly ) &c.
	The token must have been given to the Baptist  by a special revelation , which also revealed to him his own errand and office; so Luke 3:2 , ἐγένετο ῥῆμα θεοῦ ἐπὶ Ἰωάννην τὸν Ζαχ . υἱὸν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ .
	 μεμαρτύρηκα is stronger than μαρτυρῶ  I have seen (on the perf. see above, Joh 1:32 )  and have borne testimony it is a reference to his testimony at the time, as a thing on record in their memories, and as still continuing.
	 ὁ υἱ  .   τ  .   θεοῦ (see Joh 1:18 ) = the  λόγος made flesh, the Messiah.
	On the import of the descent of the Spirit on Jesus at His baptism, those who can do so should consult Lücke’s very able Excursus, i. 433 443. In this commentary, see notes on Luke 2:41-52 .
	I may just remark, that the Personal Logos, Who σὰρξ ἐγένετο in our Lord, and was subjected to all the laws of human development in infancy, childhood, youth, evermore in an especial degree under the leading of the Holy Spirit, by whose agency the Incarnation had taken place, was the Recipient ( τὸ δεχόμενον ) of this fulness of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost: and that herein consisted the real depth and propriety of this sign; the abiding of the Spirit  without measure (ch. Joh 3:34 ) on Him indicated beyond doubt that He was the λόγος σὰρξ γεγονώς , for no mere human intelligence could be thus receptive of the Holy Spirit of God;  we receive Him only  as we can , only as far as our receptivity extends,  by measure; but HE, into the very fulness and infinite capacities of His Divine Being.
