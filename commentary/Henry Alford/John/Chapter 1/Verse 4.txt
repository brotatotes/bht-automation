 4.   ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἦν ] Compare 1 John 5:11 ; 1 John 1:1-2 , and ch. John 6:33 .
	 ζωή is not merely ‘  spiritual life ,’ nor ‘  the recovery of blessedness ,’ as Tholuck, Kuinoel, &c. explain it: the λόγος is the source of  all life to the creature, not indeed ultimately, but mediately (see ch. John 5:26 : 1Jn 5:11 ).
	 κ  .   ἡ ζωὴ ἦν τ  .   φῶς τ  .   ἀνθ ] This is not to be understood of the  teaching of the Incarnate Logos , but of the  enlightening and life-sustaining influence of the eternal Son of God , in Whom was life. In the material world, light, the offspring of the Word of God, is the condition of life, and without it life degenerates and expires: so also in the spiritual world that  life which is in Him, is to the creature the very condition of all development and furtherance of the life of the spirit. All knowledge, all purity, all love, all happiness, spring up and grow from this life, which is the light to them all.
	It is not φῶς , but  τὸ φῶς : because this is  the only true light: see John 1:9 , also 1 John 1:5 .
