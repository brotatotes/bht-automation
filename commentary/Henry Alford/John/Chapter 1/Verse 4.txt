<p><strong> ζωή</strong> is not merely ‘ <em> spiritual life</em> ,’ nor ‘ <em> the recovery of blessedness</em> ,’ as Tholuck, Kuinoel, &amp;c. explain it: the λόγος is the source of <em> all life</em> to the creature, not indeed ultimately, but mediately (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span> : 1Jn 5:11 ).

<p><strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡ ζωὴ ἦν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> φῶς τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀνθ</strong> ] This is not to be understood of the <em> teaching of the Incarnate Logos</em> , but of the <em> enlightening and life-sustaining influence of the eternal Son of God</em> , in Whom was life. In the material world, light, the offspring of the Word of God, is the condition of life, and without it life degenerates and expires: so also in the spiritual world that <em> life</em> which is in Him, is to the creature the very condition of all development and furtherance of the life of the spirit. All knowledge, all purity, all love, all happiness, spring up and grow from this life, which is the light to them all.
	</p>
<p>It is not φῶς , but <strong> τὸ</strong> φῶς : because this is <em> the only</em> true light: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:9">John 1:9</span> , also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span> .</p>
