<b> 4.] In him was life</b>—compare 1 John v. 11, i. 1, 2, and ch, vi. 33.<br><br><b> life</b> is not merely ‘<i>spiritual life</i>,’ nor ‘<i>the recovery of blessedness</i>,’—as some explain it:—the Word is the source of<i> all life</i> to the creature, not indeed ultimately, but mediately (see ch. v. 26: 1 John v. 11).<br><br><b> and the life was the light of men]</b> This is not to be understood of the<i> teaching of the Incarnate Word</i>, but of the<i> enlightening and life-sustaining influence of the eternal Son of God</i>, in Whom was life. In the material world, light, the offspring of the Word of God, is the condition of life, and without it life degenerates and expires:—so also in the spiritual world that<i> life</i> which is in Him, is to the creature the very condition of all development and furtherance of the life of the spirit. All knowledge, all purity, all love, all happiness, spring up and grow from this life, which is the light to them all.<br><br> It is not “<i>light</i>,” but<i> the light</i>:—because this is<i> the only</i> true light: see ver. 9, also 1 John i. 5.
