<b> 42.]</b> This is evidently the<i> first bestowal of the new name</i> on Simon: and it is done from our Lord’s prophetic knowledge of his future character; see note on Matt. xvi. 18.<i> Kaphā</i> in Aramaic,<i> Kaph</i> in Hebrew, a<b> stone</b>. But the rendering of<i> Petros</i> in this verse should be as in margin,<b> Peter</b>, not as in A.V.,<i> a stone</i>. The Greek name<i> Peter</i> became the prevalent one in the apostolic Church very soon: St. Paul uses both names indiscriminately.<br><br> I own I cannot but think that the knowledge of Simon shewn by the Lord is<i> intended to be miraculous</i>, So also Stier, “I know who and what thou art from thy birth till thy present coming to me.... I name thee, I give thee a new name, I know what I will make of thee in thy following of Me and for my Kingdom.” The emphatic use of<i> looked on him</i> here (it is not so emphatic in ver. 36, but still even there may imply fixed contemplation, in the power of the Spirit, who suggested the testimony) is hardly accountable except on this explanation of supernatural knowledge. Similarly Abram, Sara, Jacob, received new names in reference to the covenant and promises of God to them.
