	Our Lord is on the point of setting out from the valley of the Jordan to Galilee, and finds Philip, with whom there is every reason to believe He was previously acquainted (see Joh 1:45 ). Here we find Jesus himself  calling a disciple, for the first time. But  ἀκολούθει does not here bear its strict apostolic sense; the εὑρήκαμεν afterwards, and the going to search for others to be disciples, unites Philip to the company of those who have been before mentioned, who we know were not immediately or inseparably attached as followers to Jesus.
