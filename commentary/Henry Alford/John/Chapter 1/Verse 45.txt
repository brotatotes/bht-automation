<b> 45.]</b> It does not appear where Nathanael was found: but he is described, ch. xxi. 2, as<i> of Cana of Galilee</i>: and as we find Jesus there in ch. ii. 1, it is probable the call may have taken place in its neighbourhood. Nathanael (meaning, “the gift of God,” corresponding to Theodore or Theodosius in Greek) is mentioned<i> only in these two places</i>. From them we should gather that he was an apostle; and as his name is nowhere found in the catalogues of the twelve, but Philip is associated in three of them, Matt. x. 3: Mark iii. 18: Luke vi. 14, with<i> Bartholomew</i>, it has been supposed that Nathanael and Bartholomew<i> were the same person</i> (see note on Matt. x. 3). This is however mere conjecture.
