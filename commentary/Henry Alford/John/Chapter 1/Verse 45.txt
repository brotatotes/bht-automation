<b> 45.]</b> It does not appear where Nathanael was found: but he is described, ch. xxi. 2, as<i> of Cana of Galilee</i>: and as we find Jesus there in ch. ii. 1, it is probable the call may have taken place in its neighbourhood. Nathanael (meaning, “the gift of God,” corresponding to Theodore or Theodosius in Greek) is mentioned<i> only in these two places</i>. From them we should gather that he was an apostle; and as his name is nowhere found in the catalogues of the twelve, but Philip is associated in three of them, Matt. x. 3: Mark iii. 18: Luke vi. 14, with<i> Bartholomew</i>, it has been supposed that Nathanael and Bartholomew<i> were the same person</i> (see note on Matt. x. 3). This is however mere conjecture.<br><br><b> Moses in the law]</b> Probably in Deut. xviii. 15; but also in the promises to Abraham, Gen. xvii. 7 al.: and in the prophecy of Jacob, Gen. xlix. 10, and the prophets, passim; see the references.<br><br><b> the son of Joseph, which is from Nazareth]</b> This expression seems to shew previous acquaintance on the part of Philip with Jesus. No stress can be laid, as has been most unfairly done, on Jesus being called by Philip, the son of Joseph, as indicating that the history of His birth and childhood, as related by St. Matthew and St. Luke, was<i> unknown to St. John</i>. Philip<i> expresses what was the prevailing belief, in the ordinary words,</i> as Olshausen remarks. In an admirable note, Neander remarks, that by combining the two declarations of John, that<i> in Jesus the Eternal Word of God became flesh</i> (ver. 14), and that<i> ‘that which is born of the flesh is flesh’</i> (ch. iii. 6), we cannot escape the inference, that a<i> supernatural working of God in the conception of the Ban Christ Jesus is implied.</i>
