<p><strong> 46.</strong> ] It does not appear where Nathanael was found: but he is described, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:2">John 21:2</span> , as ὁ ἀπὸ Κανᾶ τῆς Γαλιλαίας : and as we find Jesus there, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:1">John 2:1</span> , it is probable the call may have taken place in its neighbourhood. Nathanael (“ נְהַנְאֵל , i. q. Θεόδωρος , gift of God.” Wordsw.) is mentioned <em> only in these two places</em> . From them we should gather that <em> he was an Apostle;</em> and as his name is no where found in the catalogues of the Twelve, but Philip is associated in three of them (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:3">Matthew 10:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:18">Mark 3:18</span> ; Luk 6:14 ) with <em> Bartholomew</em> , it has been supposed that Nathanael and Bartholomew <em> were the same person</em> (see note on Mat 10:3 ). This is however mere conjecture.

<p><strong> τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ Ἰωσ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀπὸ</strong> [37] .] This expression seems to shew previous acquaintance on the part of Philip with Jesus. No stress can be laid, as has been most unfairly done by Lücke, De Wette, and others, on Jesus being called by Philip, <strong> the son of Joseph</strong> , as indicating that the history of His birth and childhood, as related by Matt. and Luke, was <em> unknown to John</em> . Philip <em> expresses what was the prevailing belief, in the ordinary words</em> , as Olshausen remarks. In an admirable note, Leben Jesu, p. 23 ff., Neander remarks, that by combining the two declarations of John, that <em> in Jesus the Eternal Word of God became flesh</em> ( Joh 1:14 ), and that ‘ <em> that which is born of the flesh is flesh</em> ’ (ch. Joh 3:6 ), we cannot escape the inference, that a <em> supernatural working of God in the conception of the Man Christ Jesus is implied</em> .
