<b> 49.]</b> The answer expresses, ‘Thou art the Messiah;’ see Ps. ii. 7: ch. xi. 27: Matt. xvi. 16: Luke xxii. 70. Olshausen maintains that<b> the Son of God</b> was not a Jewish appellation for the Messiah,—on account of the Jews taking up stones to cast at Jesus when He so called Himself, ch. x. 33. But as Lücke observes, it was not for the<i> mere use</i> of this Name,—but for using it in a<i> close and literal sense</i> which was unintelligible and appeared blasphemous to them, ‘I and My Father<b> are one</b>,’—that they wished to stone Him; see note on ch, x. 36. It was certainly not so common a name as ‘the Son of David, for the Messiah. Nathanael can hardly have meant the name in other than its popular meaning; and the synonymous and better known appellation which he adds, confirms this.
