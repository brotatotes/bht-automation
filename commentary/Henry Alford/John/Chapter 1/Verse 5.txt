<b> 5.]</b> As<i> light</i> and<i> life</i> are closely connected ideas, so are<i> death</i> and<i> darkness</i>. The whole world, lying in death and in darkness, is the<b> darkness</b> here spoken of:—not merely the “<i>darkened</i>” (Eph. iv. 18; see Eph. v. 7, 8), but the<i> whole mass</i>, with the sole exception (see below, ver. 12) of “<i>as many as received Him</i>” (compare ch. iii. 19; 1 John v. 19).<br><br> This<b> shineth</b> not merely the historical present, but describes the whole process of the light of life in the Eternal Word shining in this evil and dark world; both by the O.T. revelations, and (see ch. x. 16; xi. 52) by all the scattered fragments of light glittering among the thick darkness of heathendom.<br><br><b> and the darkness comprehended</b> (understood, apprehended)<b> it not</b>] That this is the meaning, will be clear from the context. St. John states here as<i> a general fact</i>, what he afterwards states of the appearance of the Incarnate Word to the chosen people, ver. 11. The sentences are strictly parallel. “<i>The light shineth in the darkness</i>” is parallel to “<i>He came to his own</i>,” and “<i>the darkness comprehended it not</i>” is parallel to “<i>His own received him not</i>.” In the first, he is speaking of the<i> whole shining of this light over the world</i>; in the second, of its<i> historical manifestation to the Jews</i>. In both cases,<i> the Divine Word was rejected</i>.<br><br><b> received</b> is used in the second case as expressing the personal assumption to oneself. as a friend or companion.<br><br> Lücke observes, that the almost tragic tone of this verse is prevalent through the Gospel of St. John and his first epistle, see ch. iii. 19; xii. 37 ff. al.: and is occasionally found in St. Paul also; see Rom. i. 18 ff.<br><br> The connexion of the two members of our verse by and is not, “The Light shineth in the darkness,<i> and therefore</i> (i. e. because darkness is the opposition to light, and they exclude one another) the darkness comprehended it not;” but, “The Light shineth in the darkness,<i> and yet</i> (notwithstanding that the effect of light in darkness is so great and immediate in the physical world) the darkness comprehended it not:” see “<i>and</i>” below, ver. 11.<br><br> On<b> received him not</b> see above on ver. 5.<b> 12.]</b> The words,<b> as many as...</b>. primarily refer to the “<i>election</i>”<i> among the Jews</i>, who have just been spoken of: but also, by implication, being opposed to both<b> the world</b> and<b> his own</b>, the<i> election</i> in all the world.<br><br><b> as many as received him</b>, i. e, as many as recognized Him as that which He was—the Word of God and Light of men.<br><br><b> them gave he power]</b> The word means, not merely<i> capability</i>,—still less<i> privilege or prerogative,</i>—but<b> power</b>; involving all the actions and states needful to their so becoming, and removing all the obstacles in their way (e. g. the wrath of God, and the guilt of sin).<br><br><b> to become children of God]</b> The spiritual life owes its beginning to<i> a birth from above</i>, ch. iii. 3–7. “And this birth is owing to the Holy Spirit of God; so that this is equivalent to saying, ‘As many as received Him, to them gave He His Holy Spirit.’ And we find that it was so: see Acts x. 44,<br><br><b> children</b><i> of God</i> is a more comprehensive expression than “<i>sons of</i> God” (which rendering in the A.V. is entirely without authority), which brings out rather our<i> adoption</i>, and hope of inheritance (Rom. viii. 14 ff.), whereas the other involves the<i> whole generation and process</i> of our life in the Spirit, as being from and of God, and consequently our<i> likeness</i> to God, walking in light as He is in light (1 John i. 5–7)—free from sin (ib. iii. 9; v. 18) and death (ch. viii. 51).<br><br><b> to them that believe on his name] His name</b> is<i> His manifestation as that which He has given Himself out to be: i.e. as a Saviour from sin;</i> see Matt. i. 21, “<i>Thou shalt call his name Jesus; for He himself shall save His people from their sins</i>.”
