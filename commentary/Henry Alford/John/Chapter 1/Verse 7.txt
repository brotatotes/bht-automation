<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] The purpose of John’s coming was to <em> bear witness to a fact</em> , which fact ( Joh 1:33 ) was made known to him by divine revelation.
	</p>
<p><strong> εἰς μαρτυρίαν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not as E. V., ‘ <em> for a witness</em> ,’ but <strong> for witness,</strong> for the purpose of bearing witness: so A.V.R.

<p><strong> ἵνα μαρτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> κ . τ . λ . is an expansion of <strong> εἰς μαρτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> : the subject of his testimony was to be <strong> the Light</strong> , and the aim of it, <strong> that all might believe</strong> ( εἰς τὸ φῶς , see ch. Joh 12:36 ) <strong> through</strong> <em> him</em> (i.e. John: not τοῦ φωτός (Grot.), which confuses the whole, for then we must understand εἰς <strong> θεόν</strong> after <strong> πιστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> which is here out of place).</p>
