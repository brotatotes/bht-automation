<b> 9.]</b> The word<b> true</b> in this connexion imports original, ‘archetypal,’ and is used of the true genuine sources and patterns of those things which we find here below only in fragmentary imitations and derivations. Such an<i> original</i> was the light here spoken of;—but John was only a derived light,—not a light<i> lighting</i>, but a light<i> lighted</i>.<br><br> The construction of this verse has been much disputed. Is<b> coming into the world</b> to be taken with<b> every man</b> (as many ancient versions, and most of the<br><br> ancient Commentators, and A.V.), or does it belong to<b> the true light</b>?<br><br> The former construction can only be defended by a Rabbinical usage, by which “<i>all that cometh into the world</i>” means ‘all men.’ But it is very questionable whether St. John ever speaks thus. Certainly he does not, in any of the passages commonly cited to defend this rendering, ch. xviii. 87 (which is spoken by Christ of Himself and His Mission); xvi. 21, 28; xii. 46. And even if he had thus spoken, how harsh and how unmeaning is the sentence, however we take it; whether with Euthymius we lay an emphasis on “was,” or with A.V. &c. supply “<i>that</i>” before it. If this latter had been intended, surely it would have been more distinctly expressed; and even when it is supplied, we have in this verse only a less forcible repetition of ver. 4.<br><br> It seems then that we must join<b> coming into the world</b> with<b> the true light</b>.<br><br> But even then, three ways of rendering are apparently open to us.<br><br> The first of these, which is that of Socinus, takes “<i>coming into the world</i>” as meaning, ‘<i>at its coming into the world</i>?’ This however—besides the sense being inconsistent with ver. 4—leaves the opening clause without a demonstrative pronoun, as before. Then, secondly,<b> coming</b> might seem to be used in the sense in which we frequently have it, as a sort of future, ‘who was, or is, to come;’ see Matt. xi. 3; Mark x. 30 al. fr.; ch. vi. 14; xi. 27, in which last two places it is joined, as here, with “<i>into the world</i>.” But if this be adopted, the only sense will be that the true light, &c.<i> was to come</i>; i.e.<i> had not yet come</i>; which manifestly is not correct;—for it<i> had come</i>, when John gave his witness; and the whole of these verses 6–13 relate to the time when He had appeared, and<i> come</i> to His own.<br><br> We are driven then to the only legitimate rendering, which is to take<b> was coming</b> as equivalent to an imperfect,<b> came</b>:—this usage being frequent in the N.T.:—i. e. at the time when John bore this witness, the true light which lighteth every man, came—was in process of manifesting Himself,—into the world.<br><br><b> which lighteth every man</b> is a further expansion of<b> the true.</b>
