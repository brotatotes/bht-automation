 26, 27. ] [  ὁ ]  ὀπίσω μου ἐρχ  . is the  subject of the sentence;  He that cometh after me, &c.,  stands among you.
	The insertions (see var. readd.) have been made by some one not aware of this, and wishing to square the verse with John 1:15 ; John 1:30 .
	The answer of the Baptist seems not to correspond to the question in John 1:25 . This was noticed as early as Heracleon (Origen in Joan. tom. vi. 15, vol. iv. p. 131), who said, ἀποκρίνεται ὁ Ἰωάννης τοῖς ἐκ τῶν Φαρισαίων πεμφθεῖσιν , οὐ πρὸς ὃ ἐκεῖνοι ἐπηρώτων , ἀλλ ʼ ὃ αὐτὸς ἐβούλετο . This however is impugned at some length by Origen, but not on very convincing grounds. The truth seems to have been apprehended by Olshausen, that the declaration of John that the Messiah was standing among them at that moment unknown to them,  was an answer to their question demanding a legitimation of his prophetic claims; a σημεῖον that he was sent from God: see ch. John 2:18 . Olsh. also suggests that this may clear up the saying of the Jews in ch. John 10:41 (see note there). In repeating this saying at other times (see Mat 3:11 and [27] ), the Baptist plainly states of the Messiah, that he should baptize them with the Holy Ghost (and fire), as here in John 1:33 . Here, in speaking to those learned in the offices of the Messiah, he leaves that to be supplied.
	 [27] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
