 32, 33. ] “Quæ sequuntur, erant  testimonii : quæ ex Joh 1:29 sq. dicuntur, erant  demonstrationis ex testimonio . Cohærentibus Baptistæ verbis Evangelista quasi parenthesin interponit: καὶ ἐμαρτύρησεν Ἰωάννης λέγων .” Bengel.
	The occurrence related by John happened  at the baptism of Jesus, which is therefore here  pre-supposed as known . Although this has been questioned (Usteri, Nachrichten über den Täufer J. u.s.w., cited by Lücke, i. 423), I cannot see how it can be reasonably doubted. We cannot surely suppose that such a sign was  twice shewn. On the appearance itself, see note Matthew 3:16 . The account here given confirms the view which I have there maintained, that the appearance was confined to our Lord and the Baptist:  he was to receive the sign, and then to testify to the others, who were not themselves yet the bearers, but the recipients of testimony: κατά τινα πνευματικὴν θεωρίαν ὤφθη μόνῳ τῷ Ἰωάννῃ .

	 τεθέαμαι  , perf.  I have seen, in reference to the sign divinely intimated to him, in the abiding fulfilment of which he now stood. So again below, John 1:34 .
	 ἔμεινεν ἐπ  ʼ   αὐτ  . ] By some appearance which is not described, the Holy Spirit was manifested to John as  not removing from Jesus again, but abiding on Him . But we are not to understand that he had seen the Spirit descending on  others , and  not abiding; for (see ch. John 7:39 : Acts 1:5 ; Acts 19:2 ff.) the gift of the Holy Spirit did not ordinarily accompany John’s baptism, but only in this one case; and its occurrence was to point out to him the Messiah.
