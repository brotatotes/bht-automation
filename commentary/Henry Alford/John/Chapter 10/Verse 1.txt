 1.  τὴν αὐλ  . ] ὁ περιτετειχισμένος κ . ὕπαιθρος τόπος (Phavorinus, Lücke ii. 403); just answering, except in this being a  permanent enclosure, to our  fold. This fold is  the visible Church of God , primarily, as His people Israel were His peculiar fold; the possibility of there being  other folds has been supposed to be alluded to in John 10:16 : but see note there.
	The terms in this first part are  general , and apply to  all leaders of God’s people; in John 10:1 , to those who enter that office without having come in by the door (i.e. Christ, in the large sense, in which the O.T. faithful looked to and trusted in Him, as the covenant promise of Israel’s God); and in Joh 10:2 to those who do enter this way; and whosoever does is the shepherd of the sheep (not emphatic, not, ‘  the Good Shepherd ,’ as below, John 10:11 , but here it is merely predicated of one who thus enters, that he is the shepherd of that particular fold: it is the attribute of a shepherd thus to enter).
	The sheep throughout this parable are not the mingled multitude of good and bad; but the  real sheep, the faithful, who  are , what all in the fold  should be . The false sheep (  goats , Mat 25:32 ) do not appear; for it is not the character of the  flock , but that of the  shepherd , and the relation between him and his sheep, which is here prominent.
