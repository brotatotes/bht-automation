<b> 1. the sheepfold]</b> The word thus rendered is described by the old writers as meaning a space walled round and open to the air: just answering, except in this being a<i> per-manent</i> enclosure, to our term<b> fold</b>. This fold is the<i> visible Church of God,</i> primarily, as His people Israel were His peculiar fold; the possibility of there being<i> other folds</i> has been supposed to be alluded to in ver. 16: but see note there.<br><br> The terms in this first part are<i> general</i>, and apply to<i> all leaders</i> of God’s people; in ver. 1, to those who enter that office without having come in by the door (i. e. Christ, in the large sense, in which the Old Testament faithful looked to and trusted in Him, as the covenant promise of Israel’s God); and in ver. 2 to those who do enter this way; and whosoever does is the shepherd of the sheep (not emphatic—not, “<i>the Good Shepherd,</i>” as below, ver. 11, but here it is merely predicated of one who thus enters, that he is the shepherd of that par-ticular fold: it is the attribute of a shep-herd thus to enter).<br><br> The<b> sheep</b>, throughout this parable, are not the min-gled multitude of good and bad; but the<i> real</i> sheep, the faithful, who<i> are</i>, what all in the fold<i> should be.</i> The false sheep (<i>goats</i>, Matt. xxv. 32) do not appear; for it is not the character of the<i> flock</i>, but that of the<i> shepherd</i>, and the relation be-tween him and his sheep, which is here prominent.<br><br><b>11.]</b> the announcement of Himself as THE GOOD SHEPHERD—the great antagonist of<i> the robber</i>—the pattern and Head of all good shepherds, as<i> he</i> of all thieves and robbers: the Messiah, in His best known and most loving office: cf. Ezek. xxxiv. 11–16, 23; xxxvii. 24, and Isa. xl. 11. But He is<b> the good Shepherd</b> in this verse, as having most eminently<i> the qualities of a good shepherd,</i> one of which is to<i> lay down His life</i> for the sheep. These words here are not so much a prophecy, as a declaration, implying however that which ver. 15 asserts explicitly.
