<b>11.]</b> the announcement of Himself as THE GOOD SHEPHERD—the great antagonist of<i> the robber</i>—the pattern and Head of all good shepherds, as<i> he</i> of all thieves and robbers: the Messiah, in His best known and most loving office: cf. Ezek. xxxiv. 11–16, 23; xxxvii. 24, and Isa. xl. 11. But He is<b> the good Shepherd</b> in this verse, as having most eminently<i> the qualities of a good shepherd,</i> one of which is to<i> lay down His life</i> for the sheep. These words here are not so much a prophecy, as a declaration, implying however that which ver. 15 asserts explicitly.
