<b> 12.]</b> The imagery is here again somewhat changed. The false shepherds are here compared to hirelings, i.e. those who serve<i> merely</i> for gain; the<i> hireling</i> who fulfils the character implied by the word. The idea is brought in by the words “<i>layeth down his life for the sheep,</i>” which introduce the thought of a time of danger, when the true and false shepherds are distinguished.<b></b><br><br><b> the wolf]</b> The purposes of this<b> wolf</b> are the same as those of the thief in ver. 10, and in the allegory he is the same;<i>—the great Foe of the sheep of Christ.</i> Lücke and De Wette deny this, and hold ‘any enemies of the theocracy’ to be meant;—but no deep view of the parable will be content with this,—see Matt. vii. 15, where the “<i>ravening wolves</i>” are “<i>false prophets,</i>” the “<i>thieves and robbers</i>” of ver. 8;—and their chief and father would therefore be<b> the wolf,</b> just as our Lord is<i> the</i> Shepherd.<br><br> Beware of rendering the former clause of ver. 15, as in A.V., as an independent sentence, “<i>As my Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father:”</i> it is merely the sequel to ver. 14, and should stand as in margin,<b> as the Father knoweth me and I know the Father.</b><br><br><b> the sheep]</b> i.e. for those<b> my sheep</b>—not, for<i> all</i>; that,<i> however true,</i> is not<i> the point</i> brought out<i> here:</i> the Lord lays down His life strictly and properly, and in the depths of the divine counsel,<i> for those who are his sheep.</i>
