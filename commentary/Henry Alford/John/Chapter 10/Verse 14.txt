The knowledge of His sheep here spoken of is more than the mere<i> knowing by name;</i> it is a knowledge corresponding to the Father’s knowledge of Him;—i. e. entire, perfect, all-comprehensive: and<i> their</i> knowledge of<i> Him</i> corresponds to His of the Father,—i. e. is intimate, direct, and personal: both being bound together by holy and inseparable Love.
