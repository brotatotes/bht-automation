Beware of rendering the former clause of ver. 15, as in A.V., as an independent sentence, “<i>As my Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father:”</i> it is merely the sequel to ver. 14, and should stand as in margin,<b> as the Father knoweth me and I know the Father.</b><br><br><b> the sheep]</b> i.e. for those<b> my sheep</b>—not, for<i> all</i>; that,<i> however true,</i> is not<i> the point</i> brought out<i> here:</i> the Lord lays down His life strictly and properly, and in the depths of the divine counsel,<i> for those who are his sheep.</i>
