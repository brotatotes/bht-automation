<b> 16.] The other sheep</b> are the<i> Gentiles</i>;—not the dispersion of the Jews, who were already in God’s<i> fold</i>. By these wonderful words, as by those in Acts xviii. 10, and by the conclusion of Matt. xxv. (see notes there), our Lord shews that, dark and miserable as the Gentile world was,<i> He had sheep even there</i>. Observe they are not<i> in other folds,</i> but scattered; see ch. xi. 52. Cf. also Eph. ii. 14 ff.<br><br><b> I must bring....]</b> i.e. in the purpose and covenant of the Father. The Lord speaks of<i> His</i> bringing them, and their hearing<i> His</i> voice: meaning that His servants in His name and by His power would accomplish this work. Admirably illustrative of the converse method of speaking, which He employs Matt. xxv. 40, 45. The<b> one flock,</b> is remarkable—<i>not</i><b> one fold,</b><i> as characteristically, but erroneously rendered in A.V.:</i>—not ONE FOLD, but ONE FLOCK: no one exclusive enclosure of an outward church, but one flock, all knowing the one Shepherd and known of Him. On<b> one shepherd,</b> compare Heb. xiii. 20.
