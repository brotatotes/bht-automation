<b> 16.] The other sheep</b> are the<i> Gentiles</i>;—not the dispersion of the Jews, who were already in God’s<i> fold</i>. By these wonderful words, as by those in Acts xviii. 10, and by the conclusion of Matt. xxv. (see notes there), our Lord shews that, dark and miserable as the Gentile world was,<i> He had sheep even there</i>. Observe they are not<i> in other folds,</i> but scattered; see ch. xi. 52. Cf. also Eph. ii. 14 ff.
