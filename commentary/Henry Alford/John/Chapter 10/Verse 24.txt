 24. ]  ψυχὴν αἴρεις is generally explained, ‘  keep us in doubt ,’ αἰωρεῖς , ἀναρτᾷς μεταξὺ πίστεως κ . ἀπιστίας , Euthym [150] But there is some question whether ψ . αἴρ . is ever so used. In Josephus, it signifies ‘  to uplift the soul ,’ ‘  raise the courage; ’ ἐπὶ τὸν κίνδ . τὰς ψ . ἠρμένοι , Antt. iii. 2. 3; 5. 1. So also Aquila, Proverbs 19:18 , πρὸς τὸ θανατῶσαι αὐτὸν μὴ ἄρῃς ψ . σου . See also Psalms 85:4 ; 142:8 (LXX). These usages, however, as all the examples adduced in the com [151] ., are confined to the act of a man on  his own soul: when the term applies to effects produced on  another , it seems to imply any strong excitement of mind, whether for hope or fear.  How long dost thou excite our minds?
