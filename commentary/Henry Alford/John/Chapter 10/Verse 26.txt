<b> 26.]</b> The difficulty of the words<b> as I said unto you</b> is considerable warrant for their genuineness: and they come much more naturally with this than with the following verse. I believe them to refer more to the<i> whole allegory,</i> than to any explicit saying of this kind; and this is shewn to my mind by the following words in ver. 27:—the link between the two, ‘<i>but ye hear not my voice,’</i> being understood. This was an obvious deduction from the allegory, and thus it might be said, “as I said unto you.” This reference to the allegory some two months after it was spoken, has been used by the rationalists as an argument against the authenticity of the narrative. But, as Meyer observes, it in reality implies that the conflict with the Jewish authorities is here again taken up after that interval, during which it had not broken out.
