<b> 3.]</b> Perhaps the<b> porter</b> (<b>doorkeeper</b>: it is the same word as that used in ch. xviii. 16, Mark xiii. 31) should not be too much pressed as significant; but certainly<i> the Holy Spirit</i> is especially He who opens the door to the shepherds; see frequent uses of this symbolism by the Apostles, Acts xiv. 27; 1 Cor. xvi. 9; 2 Cor. ii. 12; Col. iv. 3;â€”and instances of the Holy Spirit shutting the door, Acts xvi. 6, 7.<b></b><br><br><b> the sheep hear his voice]</b> The voice of<i> every such true shepherd</i> is heard (heeded, understood) by<i> the sheep</i> (generally): and he calls by name<i> his own</i> sheep,<i></i> that portion of the great flock entrusted to him, and leads them out to pasture, as his office is.<br><br> This distinction between<b> the</b><i> sheep<b></b></i> and<b> his own</b><i> sheep</i> has given rise to mistakes, from not observing that<i> shepherd</i> here is still in its mere general sense, and not spiritually applied until ver. 7, or rather ver. 11 above. It has been imagined that<i> Christ</i> is here spoken of, and that therefore these two descriptions of sheep must be different, and so the whole exposition has been confused. Even Stier has fallen into this mistake.
