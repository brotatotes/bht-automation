 3. ] Perhaps the  θυρωρός should not be too much pressed as significant; but certainly  the Holy Spirit is especially He who opens the door to the shepherds: see frequent uses of this symbolism by the Apostles, Acts 14:27 ; 1Co 16:9 ; 2 Corinthians 2:12 ; Colossians 4:3 ; and instances of the θυρωρός shutting the door, Acts 16:6-7 . (So Theodorus Heracleota, and Stier, iv. 482, edn. 2.)
	 τὰ πρόβ  .   τ  .   φων  .   αὐτ  .   ἀκ  . ] The voice of  every such true shepherd is heard (heeded, understood) by  the sheep (generally): and he calls by name  his own sheep, that portion of the great flock entrusted to him, and leads them out to pasture, as his office is.
	This distinction between τὰ πρόβ . and  τὰ ἴδια πρόβ . has given rise to exegetical and doctrinal mistakes, from not observing ποιμήν above. It has been imagined that Christ is here spoken of, and that therefore these two descriptions of sheep must be different, and so the whole exposition has been confused. Even Stier has fallen into this mistake.
