 34. ]  νόμος here is in its widest acceptation, the whole O.T., as ch. John 12:34 ; John 15:25 . The Psalm (82) is directed against the injustice and tyranny of judges (not, the  Gentile rulers of the world (De Wette), nor, the  angels (Bleek)) in Israel. And in the Psalm reference is made by  εἶπα to previous places of Scripture where judges are so called, viz. Exodus 21:6 ; Exodus 22:9 ; Exodus 22:28 .
