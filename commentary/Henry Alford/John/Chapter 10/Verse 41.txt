<b> 41.]</b> The locality reminds them of John and his testimony. The remark seems to have a double tendency:—to relate their now confirmed persuasion, that though John did not fulfil their expectations by shewing a sign or working miracles, yet he was a<i> true</i> prophet, and really, as he professed, the forerunner of this Person, who in con-sequence must be, what John had declared Him to be, the Messiah. And (ver. 42) the result followed;—<i>many believed on Him.</i> “The word<b> John</b> repeated ver. 42, belongs to the simplicity of the speech, which is reproduced literally as spoken, and. expresses the honour paid by the people to the holy man whose memory still lived among them.” Meyer.
