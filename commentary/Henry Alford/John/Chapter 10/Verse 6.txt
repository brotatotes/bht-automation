 6.] The word here rendered in the A.V. “<i>parable</i>” is not exactly what is commonly socalled: not properly a parable: but rather a parabolic allegory. The<i> parable</i> requires<br><br><i> narrative</i> to<i> set it forth;</i> and St. John relates<i> no such.</i> The right word here would be<b> allegory</b>. The original term, in its etymology, signifies, any saying diverging from the common way of speech. We have other examples in ch. xv. 1 ff. and in Matt. ix. 37, 38.<br><br><b>36.]</b> The argument is<i> from the greater to the less.</i> If in any sense<i> they</i> could be called<b> gods</b>,—how much more properly<i> He,</i> whom&c. They were only officially so<i> called</i>, only<i> called</i> gods—but He, the only One, sealed and hallowed by the Father, and sent into the world (the<i> time</i> referred to, in<b> sanctified</b> and<b> sent,</b> is that of the Incarnation), is essentially<b> God</b>, inasmuch as<b> He is the Son of God.</b> The deeper aim of this argu-ment is, to shew them that the idea of<i> man and God being one,</i> was not alien from their Old Testament spirit, but set forth there in types and shadows of Him, the real God-Man. Observe<b> ye,</b> set in empha-tic contrast to the authority of Scripture,—as “<i>he whom the Father sanctified</i>”... is to “<i>them to whom the word of God came</i>” above.<br><br><b> that ye may perceive and know]</b> The former of these is the introductory act, the latter the abiding state, of the know-ledge spoken of.
