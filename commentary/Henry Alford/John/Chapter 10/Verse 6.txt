<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] <strong> παροιμία</strong> is not = παραβολή , as so generally set down. This is not properly a parable: but rather a parabolic allegory. The <em> parable</em> requires <em> narrative</em> to set it forth; and John relates <em> no such</em> . The right word for παροιμία would be <em> allegory:</em> etymologically it is, any saying diverging from the common way of speech ( παρ ʼ οἶμον ): cf. Meyer. We have other examples in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:1">John 15:1</span> ff. and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:37-38">Matthew 9:37-38</span> .</p>
