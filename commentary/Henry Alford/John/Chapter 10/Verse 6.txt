 6. ]  παροιμία is not = παραβολή , as so generally set down. This is not properly a parable: but rather a parabolic allegory. The  parable requires  narrative to set it forth; and John relates  no such . The right word for παροιμία would be  allegory: etymologically it is, any saying diverging from the common way of speech ( παρ ʼ οἶμον ): cf. Meyer. We have other examples in ch. John 15:1 ff. and in Matthew 9:37-38 .
