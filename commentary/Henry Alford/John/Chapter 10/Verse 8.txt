<b> 8.]</b> I believe that the right sense of these words,<b> All that ever came before me,</b> has not been apprehended by any of the Commentators.<br><br> First, they can only be honestly understood of<i> time</i>; all<i> who came</i><b> before</b><i> me</i> (not, ‘<i>without regard to me,</i>’ nor ‘<i>passing by me as the door,’</i> nor ‘<i>instead of me:</i>’ nor ‘<i>pressing before me,’</i> (ch. v. 7,) which would have been “<i>come</i>,” not “<i>came:</i>? nor “before taking the trouble to find me, the door:” nor any other of the numerous shifts which have been adopted).<i></i><br><br><i> What pretended teachers then came before Christ?</i> Remember the connexion of these discourses. He has taught the Jews that Abraham and the prophets<i> entered by Him</i> (ch. viii. 56): but He has set in strong opposition to Himself and His, them (these Jews) and their father,<i> the Devil</i> (ib. ver. 44).<i> He</i> was, as Milton has it, ‘the first thief who clomb into God’s fold;’ and all his followers are here spoken of inclusively in the language of the allegory, as coming in by and with<i> him.</i> His was the first attempt to lead human nature,<i> before</i> Christ came; before the series of dispensations of grace began, in which pasture and life is offered to man by Him.<br><br> Meyer understands the Pharisees, &c. who taught the people before Christ<i> appeared</i> as the Door of the sheep: but this does not seem to reach the depth of the requirements of the saying.<br><br><b> are,</b> not<i> were</i>, because their essential nature as belonging to and being of the evil one is set forth, and the inclusion of these present Pharisees in their ranks.<br><br><b> but the sheep did not hear them...]</b> This of course cannot be understood absolutely,— ‘<i>the sheep never for one moment listened to them;</i>’ but, did not listen to them in the sense of becoming their disciples eventually. So that the fall of our first Parents would be no exception to this; whom of all men we must conclude, by the continuing grace and mercy of God to them after that fall, to have been of His real sheep. And since then, the same is true; however the sheep may for a while listen to these false shepherds, they do not<i> hear them,</i> so as to follow them. Those who do, belong not to the true flock.
