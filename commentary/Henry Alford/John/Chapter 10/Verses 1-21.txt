 1 21. ]  Of true and false shepherds. Jesus the good Shepherd . This discourse is connected with the preceding miracle; and the conduct of the Pharisees towards the man who had been blind, seems to have given occasion to this description of false shepherds, which again introduces the testimony of Jesus to Himself as the true Shepherd. So that, as Meyer remarks, the paragraph should begin at ch. Joh 9:35 properly. The more we study carefully this wonderful Gospel, the more we shall see that the idea of this close connexion is never to be summarily dismissed as imaginary, and that our Evangelist never “passes without notice to an entirely different and disjointed occurrence or discourse,” as I stated in some of my earlier editions. See on the whole subject of the parable, Jeremiah 23:1-4 ; Ezekiel 34:0 ; Zechariah 11:4-17 .
	These opening verses (to Joh 10:5 ) set forth the distinction between  false and true shepherds . Then ( Joh 10:7-9 ) He brings in  Himself , as  the door , by which both shepherds and sheep enter the fold. Then ( Joh 10:10 ) He returns to the imagery of the first verses, and sets forth Himself as THE GOOD SHEPHERD; and the rest (to Joh 10:18 ) is occupied with the results and distinctions dependent on that fact.
