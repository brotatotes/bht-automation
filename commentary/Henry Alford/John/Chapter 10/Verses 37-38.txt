 37, 38. ] Having put the charge of  blasphemy aside, our Lord again has recourse to the testimony of  His works , at which He hinted John 10:32 ; and here, to their  character , as admitted by them in John 10:33 . ‘If they bear not the character of the Father, believe Me not: but if they do (which even yourselves admit), though ye may hate and disbelieve Me, recognize the unquestionable testimony of the works: that ye may be led on to the higher faith of the unity of Myself and the Father.’
	 γνῶτε κ  .   γινώσκητε ] The distinction lies in the force of the present as denoting the continuance of a state, whereas the aorist implies an act of a moment. The nearest approach to it in English would perhaps be,  that ye may perceive (the introductory act)  and know (the abiding state). This distinction between the tenses not being appreciated, γινώσκητε has been awkwardly changed to πιστεύσητε . Cf. Plato, Legg. viii. p. 849 Α , τῶν δὲ ἐν ἄστει κατὰ τὰ αὐτὰ ἐπιμεληθῆναι καὶ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τὴν τῶν ἀστυνόμων ἀρχήν .
