 18. ] The geographical notice is given, to account for the occurrence detailed in the next verse. A stadium = ⅛ of a Roman mile.
	Meyer remarks, that  ἦν does not  necessarily imply that the places no longer existed when the Apostle wrote, but may arise from the word occurring in context with a history which is past. So Xen. Anab. i. 4. 9, αἱ δὲ κῶμαι ἐν αἷς ἐσκήνουν Παρυσάτιδος ἦσαν . But seeing that  John alone uses this form of designation (cf. ch. John 18:1 ; Joh 19:41 ), and that he probably wrote after the destruction of Jerusalem, it is more natural (as Meyer himself confesses) to explain the past tense by his regarding Jerusalem and its neighbourhood as laid waste at the time when he published his Gospel.
