<b> 18.]</b> The geographical notice is given, to account for the occurrence detailed in the next verse. A<b> furlong</b> or<b> stadium,</b> was â…› of a Roman mile. Meyer remarks, that the use of<i> the past tense,<b></b></i><b> was nigh,</b> does not<i> necessarily</i> imply that the places no longer existed when the Apostle wrote, but may arise from the word occurring in context: with a history which is past. But seeing that<i> St. John alone</i> uses this form of designation (compare ch. xviii. 1; xix. 41), and that he probably wrote after the destruction of Jerusalem, it is more natural (as Meyer himself confesses) to explain the past tense by his regarding Jerusalem and its neighbourhood as laid waste at the time when he published his Gospel.
