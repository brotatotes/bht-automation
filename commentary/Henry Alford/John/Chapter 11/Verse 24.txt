<b> 24.]</b> She understands the words rightly, but gently repels the insufficient comfort of his ultimate resurrection.<br><br><b> he that believeth in me</b> is the subject of both clauses; in the former it is said that he “<i>though he have</i><i> died, shall live:”</i> in the second, that he “<i>living and believing, shall never die.</i>” Olshausen’s remark, that<i> living</i> and<i> dying</i>, in the second clause, must<i> both</i> be physical,<i> if one is,</i> is wrong; the antithesis consisting, in both clauses, in the reciprocation of the two senses, physical and spiritual; and serving in the latter clause, as a key hereafter to the condition of Lazarus, when<i> raised</i> from the dead.<br><br> There can hardly be any reference in ver. 26 to<i> the state of the living faithful at the Lord’s coming</i> (1 Cor. xv. 51),—for although the Apostle there, speaking of believers primarily and especially, uses the first person,—the saying would he equally true of unbelievers, on whose bodies the change from<i> the corruptible</i> to<i> the incorruptible</i> will equally pass, and of whom the “<i>shall never die</i>” here would be equally true,—whereas the saying is one setting forth an exclusive privilege of the man<i> that liveth and believeth on me.</i> Besides, such an interpretation would set aside all reference to Lazarus, or to present circumstances.
