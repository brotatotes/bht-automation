<b> 33.]</b> In explaining this difficult verse, two things must be borne in mind: (1) that the word rendered by the A.V. “<i>groaned</i>” can bear but one meaning,—the expression of<i> indignation</i> and<i> rebuke, not of sorrow.</i> This has been here acknowledged by all the expositors who have paid any attention to the usage of the word. (2) That both from the words, “<i>When Jesus saw her weeping,</i>”&c.,—from the expression “<i>he troubled himself,</i>” and from ver. 35,—the feeling in the Lord was clearly one of<i> rising sympathy,</i> which vented itself at last in tears. These two things being premised, I think the meaning to be, that Jesus, with the tears of sympathy already rising and overcoming His speech,<i> checked them, so as to be able to speak the words following.</i> I would understand the words as expressing the temporary check given to the flow of His tears,—<i>the effort used to utter the following question.</i> And I would thus divest the self-restraint of all stoical and unworthy character, and consider it as<i> merely physical,</i> requiring indeed an act of the will, and a self-troubling,—a complication of feeling,—but implying no deliberate disapproval of the rising emotion, which indeed immediately after is suffered to prevail. What minister has not, when burying the dead in the midst of a weeping family, felt the emotion and made the effort here described? And surely this was one of the things in which He was made like unto His brethren. ‘Thus Bengel: “Jesus for the present austerely repressed his tears, and presently, ver. 38, they broke forth. So much the greater was their power, when they were shed.”
