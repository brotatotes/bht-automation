<b> 33.]</b> In explaining this difficult verse, two things must be borne in mind: (1) that the word rendered by the A.V. “<i>groaned</i>” can bear but one meaning,—the expression of<i> indignation</i> and<i> rebuke, not of sorrow.</i> This has been here acknowledged by all the expositors who have paid any attention to the usage of the word. (2) That both from the words, “<i>When Jesus saw her weeping,</i>”&c.,—from the expression “<i>he troubled himself,</i>” and from ver. 35,—the feeling in the Lord was clearly one of<i> rising sympathy,</i> which vented itself at last in tears. These two things being premised, I think the meaning to be, that Jesus, with the tears of sympathy already rising and overcoming His speech,<i> checked them, so as to be able to speak the words following.</i> I would understand the words as expressing the temporary check given to the flow of His tears,—<i>the effort used to utter the following question.</i> And I would thus divest the self-restraint of all stoical and unworthy character, and consider it as<i> merely physical,</i> requiring indeed an act of the will, and a self-troubling,—a complication of feeling,—but implying no deliberate disapproval of the rising emotion, which indeed immediately after is suffered to prevail. What minister has not, when burying the dead in the midst of a weeping family, felt the emotion and made the effort here described? And surely this was one of the things in which He was made like unto His brethren. ‘Thus Bengel: “Jesus for the present austerely repressed his tears, and presently, ver. 38, they broke forth. So much the greater was their power, when they were shed.”<br><br> Meyer’s explanation deserves mention; that our Lord was indignant at seeing the Jews, His bitter enemies, mingling their hypocritical tears with the true ones of the bereaved sister. But, not to say how unworthy this seems of the Person and occasion, the explanation will find no place in ver. 38: for surely the question of the Jews in ver. 37 is not enough to justify it. Still perhaps, any contribution to the solution of this difficult word is not to he summarily rejected.<br><br><b> in spirit,</b> here, corresponds to “<i>within himself</i>,” ver. 38.<br><br> Indignation over unbelief, and sin, and death the fruit of sin, doubtless lay in the background; but to see it<i> in the words</i> (with Olsh., Stier, and Trench) seems unnatural.<b></b><br><br><b> troubled himself</b> is understood by Meyer, and perhaps rightly, as describing an outward motion of the body,<b>—He shuddered:</b> and so Euthymius, “He trembled, as is usual with those who are thus affected.” Cyril’s comment is to the same effect: that it was His divinity, rebuking, and in conflict with, His human feelings, which caused His frame to shudder.<br><br> It is (as Trench remarks) a point of accuracy in the narrative, that these dwellers in Jerusalem should refer to a miracle so well known among themselves, rather than to the former raisings of the dead in Galilee, of which they probably may have heard, but naturally would not thoroughly believe on rumour only. Again, of<i> raising</i> Lazarus none of them seem to have thought, only of preventing his death.<br><br> This second<i> being greatly moved</i> of our Lord I would refer to the same reason as the first. “He wept, as allowing nature to manifest herself:.... there again he rebukes the affections.” Euthymius. Only he assigns a<i> didactic</i> purpose,<i> to teach us moderation in our tears;</i> I should rather believe the self-restraint to have been exercised as a preparation for what followed.<br><br> The caves were generally horizontal, natural or artificial,—with recesses in the sides, where the bodies were laid. There is no necessity here for supposing the entrance to have been otherwise than horizontal, as the word<i> cave</i> would lead us to believe. Graves were of both kinds: we have the vertically sunk mentioned Luke xi. 44. Compare Isa. xxii. 16; 2 Chron. xvi. 14; 2 Kings xxiii. 16.<br><br> Probably, from this circumstance, as from ‘the Jews’ coming to condole,—and the costly ointment (ch. xii. 3),—the family was wealthy.
