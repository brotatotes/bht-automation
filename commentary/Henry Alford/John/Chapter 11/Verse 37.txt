It is probable that the second set of Jews (ver. 37) spoke with a scoffing and hostile purport: for St. John seldom uses<b> but</b> as a mere copula, but generally as expressing a contrast: see vv. 46, 49, 51.<br><br> It is (as Trench remarks) a point of accuracy in the narrative, that these dwellers in Jerusalem should refer to a miracle so well known among themselves, rather than to the former raisings of the dead in Galilee, of which they probably may have heard, but naturally would not thoroughly believe on rumour only. Again, of<i> raising</i> Lazarus none of them seem to have thought, only of preventing his death.
