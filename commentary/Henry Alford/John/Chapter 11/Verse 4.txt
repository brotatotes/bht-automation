 4. ] The only right understanding of this answer, and our Lord’s whole proceeding here is, that  He knew and foresaw all from the first , as well the termination of Lazarus’s sickness and his being raised again, as the part which this miracle would bear in bringing about the close of His own ministry.
	 αὕτη ἡ ἀσθ  . ] “Ostendit Christus, notum sibi, quod tanquam nescienti indicabatur.” Grot.  οὐκ ἔστ  .   πρὸς θάν  . ] Its  result as regards Lazarus will not be  death (see Matthew 9:24 [153] , and notes): but (see ch. John 2:11 ; Joh 9:3 ) it has a higher purpose, the glory of God; the glorification, by its means, of the Son of God. And this  δοξασθῇ how was it accomplished? By  this miracle leading to his death , which in John’s diction is so frequently implied in that word. (It need hardly be remarked, with Olsh. and Trench, that the glorifying of the Son of God in Lazarus  himself is subordinately implied. Men are not mere tools, but temples, of God.)
	 [153] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
	It is doubtful whether these words were the answer sent back to the sisters, or were said to the disciples. In either case, they evidently carried a double meaning, as again those in John 11:11 .
	Joh 11:5 explains  ὃν φιλεῖς  . Observe  ἠγάπα here; while we have ὃν  φιλεῖς in John 11:3 , where there was no possibility of misunderstanding the import: cf. note on Matthew 5:46 , and Trench, New Test. Synonyms, p. 45.
