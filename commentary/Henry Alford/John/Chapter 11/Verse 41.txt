</b>In the filial relation of the Lord Jesus to the Father, all power is<i> given</i> to Him: the Son can do nothing of Himself:—and during His humiliation on earth, these acts of power were done by Him, not by that glory of His own which He had laid aside, but by the mighty working of the Father<i> in Him,</i> and in answer to His prayer: the difference between Him and us in this respect being, that His prayer<i> was always heard,</i>—even (Heb. v. 7) that in Gethsemane. And this,<b> Thou hast heard me,</b> He states here for the benefit of the standers-by, that they might know the truth of His repeated assertions of His mission from the Father.
