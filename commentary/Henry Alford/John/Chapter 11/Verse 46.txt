 46. ] Meyer, with his usual philological acumen, takes pains to set right the understanding of this. In the last verse, it is not πολλοὶ … τῶν ἐλθόντων , but πολλοὶ …  οἱ ἐλθόντες : thus identifying the πολλοί with those that came: ‘many … to wit,  those that came .’ All these ἐπίστευσαν εἰς αὐτόν (see a similar case in ch. John 8:30 ff.). Then, τινὲς ἐξ αὐτῶν , viz. the ἐλθόντων , and πιστευόντων , went, &c. The  δέ (see on Joh 11:37 ) certainly shews that this was done with a hostile intent: not in  doubt as to the miracle, any more than in the case of the blind man, ch. 9, but with a view to stir up the rulers yet more against Him. This Evangelist is very simple, and at the same time very consistent, in his use of  particles: almost throughout his Gospel the great subject, the manifestation of the Glory of Christ, is carried onward by  οὖν  , whereas  δέ as generally prefaces the development of the antagonist manifestation of hatred and rejection of Him. If it seem strange that this hostile step should be taken by πιστεύοντες εἰς αὐτόν , we at least find a parallel in the passage above cited, ch. John 8:30 ff.
