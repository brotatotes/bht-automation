Augustine understands it differently: that, all men being persuaded by Him to peaceful lives, they would have no one to join them in revolt against the Romans; but this seems forced: for no coming of the Romans would in that ease be provoked.<br><br><b> our place]</b> not,<i> the temple</i> (the<i> holy</i> place, Acts vi. 13), but<b> our place,</b> as in reff.: i.e. our<i> local habitation,</i> and our<i> national existence.</i> Both these literally came to pass.<br><br> Whether this fear was earnestly expressed, or only as a covert for their enmity, does not appear.
