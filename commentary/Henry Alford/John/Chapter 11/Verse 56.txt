<p><strong> 56.</strong> ] <strong> τί δοκ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑμ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> and <strong> ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἔλθῃ</strong> <strong> …;</strong> are <em> two separate questions</em> , as in E. V. The making them <em> one</em> , is hardly grammatical, seeing that <strong> οὐ μὴ ἔλθῃ</strong> must have a <em> future</em> sense, whereas in that case it would be <em> past:</em> ‘What think ye, that He is not (i.e. of His not having) come to the feast?’</p>
