<b> 57.]</b> The verse depends on the insertion or omission of the “<i>both</i>” before “<i>the chief priests.</i>”<i> Without</i> it, the verse is merely an explanation of the people’s question, which was asked in consequence of the order having been issued by the chief priests&c.:<i> with</i> it, it would mean, ‘And besides, the chief priests’&c.; i.e. ‘not only did the people question, but’&c. The former is in my view most probable; for the command having been given would satisfactorily account for the questioning, and not be stated merely as co-ordinate with it.
