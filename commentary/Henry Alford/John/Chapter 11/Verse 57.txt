<p><strong> 57.</strong> ] The import of this verse depends on the insertion or omission of the <strong> καί</strong> before οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς . <em> Without</em> it, it is merely an explanation of the people’s question: <strong> For the chief priests</strong> &amp;c.: <em> with</em> it, it would mean, ‘And besides, the chief priests’ &amp;c. i.e. ‘not only did the people question, but’ &amp;c. The former is in my view most probable; for the command, having been given, would satisfactorily account for the questioning, and not be stated merely as co-ordinate with it.</p>
