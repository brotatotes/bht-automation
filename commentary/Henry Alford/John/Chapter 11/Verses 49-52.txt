<p><strong> 49 52.</strong> ] The counsel is given in subtilty, and was intended by Caiaphas in the sense of political expediency only. But it pleased God to make him, as High Priest, the special though involuntary organ of the Holy Spirit, and’ thus to utter by him a prophecy of the death of Christ and its effects. That this is the only sense to be given, appears from the consideration that the <em> whole</em> of Joh 11:51-52 cannot for a moment be supposed to have been in the mind of Caiaphas; and to divide it and suppose the latter part to be the addition of the Evangelist, is quite unjustifiable.

THAT YEAR <em> of great events</em> had Caiaphas as its High Priest. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:57">John 11:57</span> .

We find it in Jos. B. J. iii. 8. 3, and Philo de Creat. Principum, 8, vol. ii. p. 367. The latter says ὁ πρὸς ἀλήθειαν ἱερεὺς εὐθύς ἐστι προφήτης . That this belief existed, may account for the expression here; which however does not confirm it in all cases, but asserts the fact that the Spirit <em> in this case</em> made use of him, as High Priest, for this purpose. This confirms the above view of <strong> τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἐκείνου</strong> <strong> ,</strong> here again repeated. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:49">John 11:49</span> .
