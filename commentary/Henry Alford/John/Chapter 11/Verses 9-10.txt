<p><strong> 9, 10.</strong> ] Our Lord’s answer is first general, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:9-10">John 11:9-10</span> , then particular, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:11">John 11:11</span> .

<p><strong> οὐχὶ δώδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4">John 9:4</span> , where the same thought is expressed. But here it is carried further, ‘I have a fixed time during which to work, appointed me by my Father; during that time I fear no danger, I walk in His light, even as the traveller in the light of this world by day: and (by inference) ye too are safe, walking in this light, which light to you is Myself, walking with Me: whosoever walks without this light, without Me, without the light of the divine purpose illumining the path of duty, stumbles, because he has no light in him.’ <strong> In him,</strong> for ‘the light of the body is the eye,’ and the light must be <em> in us</em> in order to guide us. Shut it out by blinding the eyes, and we are in darkness. So too of spiritual light.

<p>The twelve-hour division of the day was common among the Jews by this time, being probably borrowed from Babylon ( οἱ Ἕλληνες τὰ δυώδεκα μέρεα τῆς ἡμέρας παρὰ Βαβυλωνίων ἔμαθον , Herod. ii. 109). As the day in Palestine varied in length from 14h. 12m. in summer to 9h. 48m. in winter, these hours must also have varied considerably in length at the different seasons (see Winer, Realwört. art. ‘Tag’). I may remark that this verse refutes the fancy of Townson and others, also upheld by Bp. Wordsworth (who passes this verse without remark), that St. John adopts the so-called Asiatic method of reckoning time: see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:40">John 1:40</span> ; Joh 4:6 alli [154] .

<p>Notice <strong> δώδεκα</strong> emphatically prefixed, implying (as Bengel, “jam multa erat hora, sed tamen adhuc erat dies”) that though the conflict was far spent, there were yet more hours of daylight, and it could not yet be said ἐλήλυθεν ἡ ὥρα , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span> .
