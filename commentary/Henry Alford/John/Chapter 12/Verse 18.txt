We have had no account of any multitude<i> coming from Bethany with Him,</i>—nor does this narrative imply it: and surely<b> the multitude</b> in the two verses must mean the same persons. The also here does not imply another<i> multitude</i>, but<b> And on this account the multitude also went out to meet Him:</b> i.e. their coming out to meet Him and their<i> testimony</i> on the Mount of Olives, had one and the same cause,—the raising of Lazarus.
