<p style="margin-left:3.54em;"> [164] Euthymius Zigabenus, 1116
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀπῆλθεν</strong> can hardly be altogether without allusion to the fact, or likelihood, of <em> apostasy from Judaism</em> . It is used to signify entire devotion to Him whithersoever He might lead them, as in ref.: and thus implies <em> escape</em> and alienation from themselves.</p>
