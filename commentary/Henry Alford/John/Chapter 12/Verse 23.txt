<b> 23.]</b><i> Did these Greeks see (</i>i. e. speak with)<i> Jesus or not?</i> Certainly<i> not</i>, if I understand His discourse rightly. But they may have been present, at, and have understood it. The substance of His answer (made to Philip and Andrew, not to the Greeks) is, that the time was now come for His glorification, which should draw all nations to Him:—but that glorification must be accomplished by His Death. The very appearance of these Greeks is to Him a token that His glorification is at hand. Stier strikingly says, “These men from the West at the end of the Life of Jesus, set forth the same as the Magi from the East at its beginning:—but they come to the<i> Cross</i> of the King, as those to His<i> cradle</i>.” The rejection of the Jews for their unbelief is the secondary subject, and is commented on by the Evangelist, vv. 37–43.
