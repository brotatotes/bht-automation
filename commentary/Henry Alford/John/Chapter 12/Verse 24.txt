The saying is more than a mere parabolic similitude: the divine Will, which has fixed the law of the springing up of the wheat-corn, has also determined the law of the glorification of the Son of Man, and the one in analogy with the other: i.e. both<i> through Death.</i> The symbolism here lies at the root of that in ch. vi., where Christ is<i> the</i> BREAD<i> of life.</i>
