But the saying here proclaims more plainly its true extent,—by its immediate connexion with ver, 24 and by the words,<b> unto life eternal.</b><br><br> The word<b> soul</b> (or,<i> life</i>, but here better,<i> soul</i>) is not<i> really</i> in a double sense: as the wheat-corn retains its identity, though it die, so the soul: so that the two senses are, in their depth, but one. Notice, that the<b> soul</b> involves the<i> life</i> in both cases, and must not be taken in the present acceptation of that term.
