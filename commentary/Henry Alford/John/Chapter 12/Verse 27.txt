 27. ] “Concurrebat horror mortis et ardor obedientiæ” (Bengel). And to express both these  together in human speech was impossible: therefore  τί εἴπω  ;
	The following words must not be taken interrogatively (as by Theophyl., Grot., Tholuck, alli [165] .) [as if our Lord were doubting whether to say them or not]: for thus the whole sense is destroyed, besides the sentiment being most unworthy of Him who uttered it. The prayer is a  veritable prayer; and answers to the prophetic Messianic prayers in the Psalms, which thus run “My soul is troubled; Lord, help me” (Psalms 69:1 ; Psalms 40:12-13 ; Psalms 25:17 ; Psa 6:3-4 alli [166] .); and to that prayer afterwards in Gethsemane, Matthew 26:39 .

	 διὰ τοῦτο ] The misunderstanding of these words has principally led to the erroneous punctuation just noticed. διὰ τοῦτο =  ἵνα σωθῶ ἐκ τῆς ὥρας ταύτης . ‘I came to this hour for this very purpose,  that I might be saved from this hour:’ i.e. ‘  the going into, and exhausting this hour, this cup, is the very appointed way of my glorification .’  Das Hineinkommen ist selbst das Hindurchkommen, das Leiden selbst die Erldsung! Stier, ver. 77, edn. 2: so also Lampe. This interpretation does not, as Luthardt says,  fall with the interrogative punctuation of the previous clause, but holds equally good when that is relinquished. The other interpretation, that of Meyer, alli [167] ., is,  that Thy Name may be glorified . But surely this is to do violence to the order of thought. This particular does not come in till the next clause, and cannot without an improbable trajection be drawn into this.
