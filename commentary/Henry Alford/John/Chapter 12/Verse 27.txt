<b> 27.]</b> Bengel observes that the horror of death and the ardour of obedience were in conflict. And to express both these<i> together</i> in human speech was impossible: therefore our Lord exclaims,<b> What shall I say?</b><br><br> The following words,<b> Father, save me from this hour</b>, must not be taken interrogatively, as if our Lord were doubting whether to say them or not: for thus the whole sense is destroyed, besides the sentiment being most unworthy of Him who uttered it. The prayer is a<i> veritable prayer;</i> and answers to the prophetic Messianic prayers in the Psalms, which thus run— ‘My soul is troubled; Lord, help me’ (Ps. lxix. 1; xl. 12, 13; xxv. 17; vi. 3, 4, al.); and to that prayer afterwards in Gethsemane, Matt. xxvi. 39.<br><br><b> for this cause]</b> The misunderstanding of these words has principally led to the erroneous punctuation just noticed.<b> for this cause</b> really means,<i> “in order that I may be saved from this hour:”</i> i.e. ‘I came to this hour for this very purpose,—<i>that I might be saved from</i> this hour:’ i.e. ‘<i>the going into, and exhausting this hour, this cup, is the very appointed way of my glorification</i>.’ This interpretation docs not, as Luthardt says,<i> fall</i> if we give up the interrogative punctuation of the previous clause, but holds equally good when that is relinquished. The other interpretation of the words<b> for this cause,</b> that of Meyer and others, is,<i> that Thy Name may be glorified.</i> But surely this is to do violence to the order of thought. This particular does not come in till the next clause, and cannot without an improbable transposition be drawn into this.
