<p><strong> 30.</strong> ] The voice had been heard by those, who did not apprehend its meaning, <em> as thunder</em> . But αὕτη ἡ <strong> φωνή</strong> could not by any possibility have been said to them, <em> if it had only thundered</em> .
	</p>
<p>Our Lord does not say that the assurance was <em> not made</em> for <em> His</em> sake; He had prayed, and His prayer had been answered: but that it had not been thus <em> outwardly expressed</em> for <em> His</em> , but for <em> their</em> sake. This is likewise true in the case of all testimonies to Him; and especially those two other voices from heaven, at His Baptism and His Transfiguration.

<p><strong> ὑμᾶς</strong> is the whole multitude, not merely the disciples. All heard, and all <em> might have</em> understood the voice: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:42">John 11:42</span> .</p>
