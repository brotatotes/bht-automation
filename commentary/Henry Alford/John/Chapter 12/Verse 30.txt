<b> 30.]</b> The voice had been heard by those, who did not apprehend its meaning,<i> as thunder.</i> But the words,<b> this voice,</b> could not by any possibility have been said to them,<i> if it had only thundered.</i><br><br> Our Lord does not say that the assurance was<i> not made</i> for<i> His</i> sake:—He had prayed, and His prayer had been answered:—but that it had not been thus<i> outwardly expressed</i> for<i> His,</i> but for<i> their</i> sake. This is likewise true in the case of all testimonies to Him; and especially of those two other voices from heaven,—at His Baptism and His Transfiguration.<br><br> Those addressed in the words,<b> for your sakes,</b> are the whole multitude, not merely the disciples. All heard, and all<i> might have</i> understood the voice: see ch, xi. 42.
