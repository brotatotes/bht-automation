<p><strong> 32.</strong> ] See reff. Here there is more perhaps implied in <strong> ὑψ</strong> <strong> .</strong> than in either of those places: viz. <em> the Death, with all its consequences</em> . The Saviour crucified, is in fact the Saviour glorified; so that the exalting to God’s right hand is set forth by that uplifting on the Cross. There is a fine touch of pathos, corresponding to the feeling of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:27">John 12:27</span> , in <strong> ἐὰν ὑψωθῶ</strong> <strong> .</strong> Hermann’s description of the meaning of ἐὰν τοῦτο γένηται exactly gives it: “sumo hoc fieri, et potest omnino fieri, sed utrum vere futurum sit necne, experientia cognoscam.” Viger, p. 832. The Lord Jesus, though <em> knowing all this</em> , yet in the weakness of his humanity, puts himself into this seeming doubt, ‘if it is so to be:’ cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:42">Matthew 26:42</span> . All this is missed by the shallow and unscholarlike rendering ‘ <em> when</em> ,’ which I need hardly remind my readers ἐάν can never bear. See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:3">John 14:3</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span> .

<p><strong> ἑλκύσω</strong> by the diffusion of the Spirit in the Church: manifested in the preaching of the Word mediately, and the pleading of the Spirit immediately. Before the glorification of Christ, the Father drew men to the Son (see ch. Joh 6:44 and note), but now the Son Himself to Himself. Then it was, ‘no man can come except the Father draw Him:’ now the Son draws <em> all</em> . And, <em> to Himself</em> , as thus uplifted, thus exalted; the great object of Faith: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:52">John 11:52</span> .</p>
