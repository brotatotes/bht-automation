<b> 32. if I be lifted up]</b> See the references. Here there is more perhaps implied than in either of those places: viz.<i> the Death, with all its consequences.</i> The Saviour crucified, is in fact the Saviour glorified; so that the exalting to God’s right hand is set forth by that uplifting on the Cross. There is a fine touch of pathos, corresponding to the feeling of ver. 27, in the words,<b> if I be lifted up</b>. The Lord Jesus, though<i> knowing that the lifting up would really take place,</i> yet in the weakness of His humanity, puts Himself into this seeming doubt, ‘if is so to be:’ cf. Matt. xxvi. 42. All missed by the shallow and unscholarlike rendering “<i>when</i> I shall be lifted up,” which the original will not bear.<br><br><b> will draw all men unto me]</b> By the diffusion of the Spirit in the Church: manifested in the preaching of the Word mediately, and the pleading of the Spirit immediately. Before the glorification of Christ, the Father drew men to the Son (see ch. vi. 44 and note), but now the Son Himself to Himself. Then it was “no man can come except the Father draw him:” now the Son draws<i> all.</i> And,<i> to Himself,</i> as thus uplifted, thus exalted;—the great object of Faith: see ch. xi. 52.
