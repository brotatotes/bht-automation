<b> 32. if I be lifted up]</b> See the references. Here there is more perhaps implied than in either of those places: viz.<i> the Death, with all its consequences.</i> The Saviour crucified, is in fact the Saviour glorified; so that the exalting to God’s right hand is set forth by that uplifting on the Cross. There is a fine touch of pathos, corresponding to the feeling of ver. 27, in the words,<b> if I be lifted up</b>. The Lord Jesus, though<i> knowing that the lifting up would really take place,</i> yet in the weakness of His humanity, puts Himself into this seeming doubt, ‘if is so to be:’ cf. Matt. xxvi. 42. All missed by the shallow and unscholarlike rendering “<i>when</i> I shall be lifted up,” which the original will not bear.
