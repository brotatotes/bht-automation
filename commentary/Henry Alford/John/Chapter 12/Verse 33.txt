 33. ]  ποίῳ θαν  . can hardly mean more than  by what manner of death. Lampe (“non nude significat  quo genere mortis , sed in sensu latiori  qualitatem mortis , etiam  internam involvit, adeoque ad fructus etiam hujus mortis respicit”) and Stier find in the word the whole consequences and character of His Death: but see ch. John 18:32 .
	John does not say that this was  all that ὑψωθῶ meant, but that it was its first and obvious reference.
