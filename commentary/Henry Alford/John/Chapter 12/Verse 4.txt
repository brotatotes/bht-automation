<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] For <em> Judas</em> , we have οἱ μαθ . αὐτοῦ . Matt., τινές , merely, Mark. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:8">Matthew 26:8</span> .

<p><strong> ὁ μέλλεν αὐτὸν παραδιδόναι</strong> is not inserted, nor are any such notices in St. John without significance. It has a pragmatic connexion with the narrative in hand. Only one with thoughts alien from Jesus could have originated such a murmur. And on the other hand, it may well be, as some have supposed, that by the rebuke of the Lord on this occasion, the traitorous scheme of Judas, long hidden in his inmost soul, may have been stimulated to immediate action.</p>
