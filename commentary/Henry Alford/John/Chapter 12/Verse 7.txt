 7. ] See note on Matthew 26:12 . To suppose that it was a remnant from that used at the burial of Lazarus, is not only fanciful, but at variance with the character of the deed as apparent in the narrative. The rec [163] . reading, εἰς τ . ἡμ . τ . ἐντ . μου τετήρηκεν αὐτό , seems to be an adaptation to Mark 14:8 , in order to escape from the difficulty of understanding how she could  keep for His burial , what she  poured out now . Meyer understands the text of the  remnant: but Luthardt rightly observes that the history clearly excludes the idea of a remnant: cf. ἐπράθη and ἐδόθη . He himself, with Baumg.-Crusius, takes τηρήοῃ as past, “  Let her have kept it ,” i.e. blame her not for having kept it: but this is vapid in sense, and ungrammatical. I understand the words, which, like all our Lord’s proleptical expressions, have something enigmatical in them, of her whole act, not regarded as a thing past, but spoken of in the abstract as to be allowed or disallowed:  Let her keep it for the day of my burial: not meaning a  future day or act, but the present one, as one to be allowed.
