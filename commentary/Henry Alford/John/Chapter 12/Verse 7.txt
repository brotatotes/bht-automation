<b> 7.]</b> See note on Matt. xxvi. 12. To suppose that the ointment was a remnant from that used at the burial of Lazarus, is not only fanciful, but at variance with the character of the deed as apparent in the narrative. The common reading, “<i>against the day of my burying she hath kept this,</i>” seems to be an adaptation to Mark xiv. 8, in order to escape from the difficulty of understanding how she could<i> keep for His burial,</i> what she<i> poured out now.</i> Meyer understands the words to apply to the<i> remnant</i>: but Luthardt rightly observes, that the history clearly excludes the idea of a remnant. I understand the words, which, like all our Lord’s anticipatory expressions, have something enigmatical in them, of her whole act, regarded as a thing past, but spoken of in the abstract, as to be allowed or disallowed:<b> Let her keep it for the day of my burial:</b> not meaning a<i> future</i> day or act, but the present one, as involving that future one.
