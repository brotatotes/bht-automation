Joh 18:28 and note. The words belong to the whole narrative following, not to εἰδώς or ἀγαπήσας .

<p><strong> εἰδώς</strong> ] The view with which our Lord washed His disciples’ feet, is shewn by the repeated εἰδώς and by ἀγαπήσας … αὐτούς . The connexion is: “Jesus loved His own even to the end (of His life in the flesh), and gave them in the washing of their feet a proof of His love; and to this act He was induced by the knowledge that He must soon leave this world; and although this knowledge was united ( Joh 13:3 ) with the highest consciousness of His divine mission and speedy glorification, yet this latter did not prevent Him from giving this proof of His self-humiliating love” (De Wette).
