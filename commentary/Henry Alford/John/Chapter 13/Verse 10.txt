<b> 10.]</b> Reference appears to be made to the fact that one who<i> has bathed,</i> after he has reached his home, needs not entire washing, but only to have his feet washed from the dust of the way. This bathing, the bath of the new birth, but only yet in its foreshadowing, in the purifying effect of faith working by love, the Apostles, with one exception, had; and this<i> foot-washing</i> represented to them, besides its lesson of humility and brotherly love, their<i> daily need of cleansing from daily pollution, even after spiritual regeneration,</i> at the hands of their divine Master. See 2 Cor. vii. 1: James i. 21: Acts xv. 8, 9: 2 Pet. ii. 22.
