<b> 14.]</b> The command here given must be understood in the full light of intelligent appreciation of the circumstances, and the meaning of the act. Bengel remarks, that<i> one</i> intent of our Lord’s washing the feet of His disciples must necessarily be absent from any such deed on our part: viz. its<i> symbolic meaning,</i> pressed by our Lord on St. Peter, “If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me.” The command will rather find its fulfilment in all kinds of mutual condescension and help, than in any literal observance. “In these times,” continues Bengel, “pontiffs and princes obey this injunction to the letter: but it would be a more wonderful thing to see a pontiff, for example, wash the feet of one equal, than of twelve poor beggars.” The custom of literally and ceremonially washing the feet in obedience to this command, is not found before the fourth century.
