<b></b>The proverbial expression,<b> There is no servant greater than his lord,</b> is used here in a different sense from that which it has in ch. xv. 20. Here it is, “if the Master thus humbles Himself, much more should His servants and messengers;” see Matt. x. 24; Luke vi. 40; and on ver. 17, Luke xii. 47, 48.
