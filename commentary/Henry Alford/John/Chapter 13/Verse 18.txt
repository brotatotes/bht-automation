	On the citation, see LXX. The words here are given freely, the LXX having ἐμεγάλυνεν ἐπ ʼ ἐμὲ πτερνισμόν .
	This is another instance of the direct and unhesitating application of the words of the Psalms by our Lord to Himself.
	 τὴν πτ  . ] “Congruit hic sermo imprimis ad lotionem  pedum , et ad morem veterum discumbentium ad  panem edendum.” Bengel.
