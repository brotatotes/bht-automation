 2.   δείπ  .   γεν  . ] Not as E. V. ‘  supper being ended ,’ for ( Joh 13:12 ) He  reclined again , and in John 13:26 , the supper is  still going on: but,  supper having begun, or  having been served see Ἰησ .  γενομένου ἐν Βηθ . Matthew 26:6 , ‘When Jesus had arrived at B.;’ and πρωΐας  γενομένης  , ‘when it had become morning,’ ch. John 21:4 . Cf. also γενομένου σαββάτου , Mark 6:2 .

Judas had before this covenanted with the Sanhedrim to betray Him, Mat 26:14 and [174] , which must here be meant by  the devil having put it into his heart: the thorough self-abandonment to Satan which led to the actual deed, being designated John 13:27 .

When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
	Luke ( Luk 22:3 ) expresses the steps of his treasonable purpose otherwise, meaning the same. The fact is here stated, to enhance the love which Jesus shewed in the following action.
