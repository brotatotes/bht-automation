<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:40">Matthew 10:40</span> . The connexion is very difficult, and variously set down.

<p>It has been generally supposed (Euthym [175] , &amp;c.) that the words were to comfort the Apostles for the disgrace of their order by Judas, or in prospect of their future labours. But then would not ἄν τινα π . have been expressed by ὑμᾶς ? Another view is to refer back to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:16-17">John 13:16-17</span> , and suppose the connexion to have been broken by the allusion to Judas. But is this likely, in a discourse of our Lord? I rather believe that the saying sets forth the dignity of that office from which Judas was about to fall: q. d. ‘not only was he in close intercourse with Me ( Joh 13:18 ), but invested with an ambassadorship for Me, and in Me, for the Father; and yet <em> he</em> will lift up his heel against Me.’ And the consideration of this dignity in all its privileges, as contrasted with the sad announcement just to be made, leads on to the ἐταράχθη τῷ πν . of the next verse.
