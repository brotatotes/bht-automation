<b> 27.]</b> Bengel observes that it was<i> after</i> the sop, not<i> with</i> it, that Satan entered into him. Observe the word<b> sop,</b> in this sentence, stands for the act in which it played a principal part. This<i> giving the sop</i> was one of the closest testimonies of friendly affection.<br><br> The<br><br> word then carries a graphic power and pathos with it:<b> at that moment</b>.<br><br><b> Satan entered into him]</b> See ver. 2 and note. Satan<i> entered fully</i> into him, took full possession of him,—so that his will was not only bent upon doing the deed of treachery, but fixed and determined to do it<i> then and there</i>. The words must be understood literally, not as merely betokening the decision of his mind in the direction of the devil’s counsels.<br><br><b> What thou doest (art doing)...]</b> These words are not to be evaded, as being<i> permissive</i> or<i> dismissive</i> (this latter view is taken by Chrysostom, who says, “The words are not to be taken as commanding or exhorting, but as reproaching, and intimating that there was in him the wish to act decidedly, but as he was undecided, the Lord permits him to depart and do it”). They are like the saying of God to Balaam, Num. xxii. 20,—and of our Lord to the Pharisees, Matt. xxiii. 32. The<i> course of sinful action is presupposed</i>, and the command to go on is but the echo of that mysterious appointment by which the sinner in the exercise of his own corrupted will becomes the instrument of the purposes of God. Thus it is not “<i>What thou art about to do</i>,” but—that<b> which thou art doing</b>, hast just now fully determined to put in present action,<b> do quickly—</b>reproving his lingering, and his pretending (Matt. ver. 25) to share in the general doubt.
