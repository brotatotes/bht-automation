Joh 18:3 into precision, as happening on one and the same night. It is perhaps fanciful to see, as Orig [177] , Olsh., Stier, &c. have done, an allusion to the σκοτία in Judas’s soul, or to ὑμῶν … ἡ ὥρα καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία τοῦ σκότου , Luke 22:53 ; though doubtless  there the Lord alludes to its being  also night: but I quite feel, with Meyer, that there is something awful in this termination  it was night.
