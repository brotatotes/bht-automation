<p><strong> 31. </strong> <strong> νῦν ἐδοξ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] It was not that the <em> presence of</em> Judas, as some have thought, hindered the great consummation imported by <strong> ἐδοξ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> but that the work on which he was gone out, was the ACTUAL COMMENCEMENT <em> of that consummation:</em> “ab hinc enim passiones Christi initium capiebant.” Lampe.
