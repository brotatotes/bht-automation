<b> 31—XIV. 31.]</b><i> He comforts them with the assurance that He is going to the Father.</i><br><br><b> 31. Now is the Son of man glorified</b>] It was not that the<i> presence of</i> Judas, as some have thought, hindered the great consummation imported by this<i> glorification</i>, but that the work on which he was gone out, was the ACTUAL COMMENCEMENT<i> of that consummation</i>. “Now at length,” says Lampe, “as if an obstacle were broken down, the rushing rivers of grace flow from the lips of Jesus.” It is true that Judas’s presence hindered the<i> expression</i> of these gracious words. The glorification is spoken of by anticipation, as if accomplished, because the deed was actually in doing, which was to accomplish it. The glorifying spoken of here, and in ver. 32, is not the same.<i> This</i> is the glorifying of God by Christ on earth, in His course of obedience as the Son of Man, which was completed by His death ( “<i>he became obedient even unto death</i>,” Phil. ii. 8). And His death was the sition-point between God being glorified in Him, and He being glorified in God—manifested to be the Son of God with power by His resurrection, and received up to the Father, to sit at the right hand of God. This latter (ver. 32) is spoken of by Him here as future, but immediate (<b>straightway</b>) on His death, and leads on to the address in ver. 33.
