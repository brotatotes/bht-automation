 31.   νῦν ἐδοξ  . ] It was not that the  presence of Judas, as some have thought, hindered the great consummation imported by  ἐδοξ  ., but that the work on which he was gone out, was the ACTUAL COMMENCEMENT  of that consummation: “ab hinc enim passiones Christi initium capiebant.” Lampe. It is true that his presence hindered the  expression of these gracious words: “jam quasi obice rupto torrentes gratiæ a labiis Jesu effunduntur.” Id.
	 ἐδοξάσθη spoken proleptically as if accomplished, because the deed was actually in doing, which was to accomplish it. The glorifying spoken of here, and in δοξάσει , John 13:32 , is not the same.  This is the glorifying of God by Christ on earth, in His course of obedience as the Son of Man, which was completed by His death ( ὑπήκοος μέχρι θανάτου , Php 2:8 ). And His death was the transition-point between God being glorified in Him, and He being glorified in God manifested to be the Son of God with power by His resurrection, and received up to the Father, to sit at the right hand of God. This latter ( Joh 13:32 ) is spoken of by Him here as future, but immediate ( εὐθύς ) on His death, and leads on to the address in John 13:33 .
	 ἐν ἑαυτῷ is in  God (the Father), not in Christ. ἑαυτ . reflects back on the  subject of the sentence: and ἐν is not ‘  by means of ,’ but in, by the resurrection of Him into that glory, which He had indeed before, but now has  as the Son of Man , with the risen Manhood; so παρὰ σεαντῷ , ch. John 17:5 . Grotius compares 1 Samuel 2:30 ( τοὺς δοξάζοντάς με δοξάσω LXX). ἀντιδωρεῖται αὐτῷ ὁ πατὴρ τὸ μεῖζον οὗ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου πεποίηκεν . Origen. in Joan. tom. xxxii. 18, vol. iv. p. 451.
