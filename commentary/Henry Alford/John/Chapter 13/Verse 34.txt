<p><strong> 34.</strong> ] The καινότης of this commandment consists in its <em> simplicity</em> and (so to speak) <em> unicity</em> . The same <em> kind</em> of love was prescribed in the O.T. (see Rom 13:8 ): ‘as thyself’ is the <em> highest</em> measure of love, and it is therefore not in <em> degree</em> that the new commandment differs (Cyr [178] , Euthym [179] , Theod. Mops [180] ) from the old, nor in <em> extent</em> , but in being <em> the</em> commandment of the new covenant, the first-fruit of the Spirit in the new dispensation ( Gal 5:22 ): see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7-8">1 John 2:7-8</span> (and note), where καινή is commented on by the Apostle himself.

<p>I cannot agree with Stier (ver. 148, edn. 2), that <strong> ἵνα</strong> in the second sentence is not [181] . with <strong> ἵνα</strong> in the first, but signifies (‘I have loved you’) “in order that &amp;c.” The sentence is analogous to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:14">John 13:14</span> , and the <em> new</em> point in it is the καθὼς ἠγ . ὑμ ., which is therefore set first, and should be (as in E. V.) retained so.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [181] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
