 34. ] The καινότης of this commandment consists in its  simplicity and (so to speak)  unicity . The same  kind of love was prescribed in the O.T. (see Rom 13:8 ): ‘as thyself’ is the  highest measure of love, and it is therefore not in  degree that the new commandment differs (Cyr [178] , Euthym [179] , Theod. Mops [180] ) from the old, nor in  extent , but in being  the commandment of the new covenant, the first-fruit of the Spirit in the new dispensation ( Gal 5:22 ): see 1 John 2:7-8 (and note), where καινή is commented on by the Apostle himself.

	I cannot agree with Stier (ver. 148, edn. 2), that  ἵνα in the second sentence is not [181] . with  ἵνα in the first, but signifies (‘I have loved you’) “in order that &c.” The sentence is analogous to John 13:14 , and the  new point in it is the καθὼς ἠγ . ὑμ ., which is therefore set first, and should be (as in E.

When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
