<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] And (the οὖν taking up the narrative again at the ἤρξατο , q. d., ‘in pursuance of this intention’) He comes to Simon Peter; not <em> first</em> , as some have maintained, both with and without reference to the primacy of Peter: for that would be hardly consistent (see on the preceding verse) with the context, which seems to require that the washing should have begun and been going on, before He came to Peter.

<p><strong> νίπτεις</strong> ] <strong> art</strong> <em> Thou</em> <strong> washing</strong> (intending to wash) <strong> my feet?</strong> He thinks the act unworthy of the Lord; even as many think that great act of Love to have been, which was typified by it.

<p>Notice that <strong> μου</strong> is enclitic, <em> not emphatic</em> , in which case it would be <strong> ἐμοῦ</strong> <strong> .</strong> The having his feet washed is a matter of course: it is the Person who is about to do it that offends him.</p>
