<p><strong> 8.</strong> ] The rash and self-opinionated Apostle opposes to μετὰ ταῦτα his <strong> οὐ μὴ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> εἰς τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αἰῶνα</strong> <strong> .</strong> In interpreting our Lord’s answer, we must remember, that He replies more to the <em> spirit</em> of Peter’s objection, than to his words. The same well-meaning but false humility would prevent him (and does prevent many) from stooping to receive at the hands of the Lord that spiritual washing which is absolutely necessary in order to have any part in Him, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span> , ‘ <em> If I wash thee not, thou hast no part in Me;</em> ’ but the affirmative proposition is not equally true; witness the example of Judas, who <em> was washed, but yet had no part</em> in Jesus. In the <em> spiritual sense</em> of washing, this is not so. Whoever is washed by Jesus, has part in Him. We are here in the realm of another and deeper logic: the act being no longer symbolic, but veritable.</p>
