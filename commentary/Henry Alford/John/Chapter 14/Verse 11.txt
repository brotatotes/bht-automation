<b> 11. for the very works’ sake]</b> See ch. x. 38. The object here seems to be, to fix their attention on the<i> works</i> as a plain testimony even to such as could not simply believe so deep a thing on His assertion, and one which—<b>12.]</b> should become a matter felt and known in themselves hereafter,—by virtue of their living union with Him who is gone to the Father, and become the dispenser and channel of the Spirit. ‘He who<i> believes</i> Christ speaking concerning Himself,<i> believes on</i> Christ.’ Bengel.<br><br><b> greater works than these shall he do]</b> This word is not to be evaded (so as to mean<i> greater in number</i>), but taken in its full strict sense. And the keys to its meaning will be found ch. i. 51; v. 20.<i> The</i> works which Jesus did, His Apostles also did,—viz. raising the dead, &c.;—<i>greater works than those</i>, they did—not in<i> degree</i>, but<i> in kind</i>:<i> spiritual</i> works, under the dispensation of the Spirit, which<i> had not yet come in</i>. But they did them<i> not as separate from</i> Him: but<i> in</i> Him, and<i> by</i> Him; and so (ch. v. 21)<i> He</i> is said to do them. The work which He did by Peter’s sermon, Acts ii., was one of these<i> greater works</i>—the firstfruits of the unspeakable gift.<br><br> This union of them with and in Him is expressed here by “<i>the works that</i><b> I</b><i> do, shall</i><b> he</b><i> do</i><i> also</i>.” ‘He has sown, we reap; and the harvest is greater than the seed-time.’ Stier.
