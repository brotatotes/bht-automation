 13. ] I have retained the period after  πορεύομαι (Grot., Griesb., Lachm., Knapp, Lücke, Meyer, Stier place a comma only and connect this verse with the  ὅτι ), because the sense remains much the same, and the style is better preserved.
	 αἰτήσητε  , scil. τὸν πατέρα : so ch. John 15:16 ; John 16:23 . But this does not exclude, but  distinctly includes , prayer to Christ; so blended are these two (as the ὁρᾶν , Joh 14:9 ), that we have not ποιήσει , but  ποιήσω  , and, John 14:14 , emphatically  ἐγὼ ποιήσω . He who prays to the Father, prays to the Son.
	This ποιήσω answers to the ποιήσει in John 14:12 ;  the reason why you shall do these greater works, is, on account of the all-powerful Spirit of grace and supplication which My going to the Father shall bring down upon the Church; in answer to which Spirit, I will do by you whatever in My Name (i.e. in union with Me, as being Mine, manifesting forth Jesus  as the Son of God )  ye shall ask. And the end of this is, that by these  μείζονα τούτων  ,  the wonders of grace and triumphs of the Spirit, the Father may be glorified (His glory shewn forth)  in and by the Son .
	Joh 14:14 solemnly repeats  as a promise , what was incidentally asserted before: ‘For this is a truth, that whatever’ &c. And besides, adds the  ἐγώ  : it is I that will do it: shewing that the use of the first person before was emphatic. “ ἐγώ hoc jam indicat gloriam.” Bengel.
	Joh 14:15 is a following out of the ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου : ‘That  way of prayer is the way of  loving obedience , in which the Spirit is ever found, and which is only trodden by His help:’ and also of ἵνα δοξ . ὁ π . ἐν τῷ νἱ ., ‘As the Father is honoured in the Son, so must the Son be honoured in you:’ see ch. John 15:10 .
