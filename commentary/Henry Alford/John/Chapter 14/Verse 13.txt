But this does not exclude, but<i> distinctly includes</i>, prayer to Christ; so blended are these two (as the<i> seeing</i> ver. 9), that we have not “<i>that will</i><b> He</b><i> do,</i>” but, ver. 14, emphatically “<i>that will</i><b> I</b><i> do.</i>” He who prays to the Father, prays to the Son. This doing answers to the<b> doing</b> in ver. 12;<i> the reason why you shall do these greater works, is, on account of the all-powerful Spirit of grace and supplication which My going to the Father shall bring down upon the Church; in answer to which Spirit, I will do by you whatever in My Name</i> (i. e. in union with Me, as being Mine, manifesting forth Jesus<i> as the Son of God</i>)<i> ye shall ask, And the end of this is, that by these<b> greater works</b>, the wonders of grace and triumphs of the Spirit, the Father may be glorified</i> (His glory shewn forth)<i> in and by the Son.</i>
