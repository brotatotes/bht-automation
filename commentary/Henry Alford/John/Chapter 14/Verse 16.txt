 16. ] And  then the Spirit shall proceed forth upon you. Not αἰτήσω , but  ἐρωτήσω “familiaris petendi modus,” Bengel: rather perhaps, a manner of asking implying  actual presence and nearness , and here used of the mediatorial office in Christ’s  ascended state .
	 παράκλητον ] Olshausen remarks that the interpretations of this word range themselves in  two classes , which again by no means exclude one another: those of ‘COMFORTER,’ and those of ‘ADVOCATE.’ (“  Teacher ” (Theodore of Mopsuest. and Ernesti) is out of the question.)
	The etymology of the word requires the latter as its strict meaning, and in this strict meaning it satisfies 1 John 2:1 ,  παράκλητον ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα Ἰησοῦν χριστόν : but not so all the places where it is used  of the Holy Spirit , nor this verse, where of the Son and Spirit both. And therefore the other meaning,  Comforter, including as it does in its fulness (see Romans 8:26 , where both, the συναντιλαμβάνεσθαι and the ὑπερεντυγχάνειν , are united) the  Advocate also, has been both here and in Germany (  Troster , Luther) sanctioned by Christian usage as the most adequate rendering. See Archdeacon Hare’s Mission of the Comforter, vol. ii. note J a. He shews that Wicliff, from whom we have our  Comforter, often used “comfort” for the Latin  comfortari , as e.g. Luke 22:43 ; Act 9:19 alli [194] . Thus the idea of  help and strength is conveyed by it, as well as of consolation.
