<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] And <em> then</em> the Spirit shall proceed forth upon you. Not αἰτήσω , but <strong> ἐρωτήσω</strong> “familiaris petendi modus,” Bengel: rather perhaps, a manner of asking implying <em> actual presence and nearness</em> , and here used of the mediatorial office in Christ’s <em> ascended state</em> .

<p><strong> παράκλητον</strong> ] Olshausen remarks that the interpretations of this word range themselves in <em> two classes</em> , which again by no means exclude one another: those of ‘COMFORTER,’ and those of ‘ADVOCATE.’ (“ <em> Teacher</em> ” (Theodore of Mopsuest. and Ernesti) is out of the question.)

<p>The etymology of the word requires the latter as its strict meaning, and in this strict meaning it satisfies <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span> , <strong> παράκλητον</strong> ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα Ἰησοῦν χριστόν : but not so all the places where it is used <em> of the Holy Spirit</em> , nor this verse, where of the Son and Spirit both. And therefore the other meaning, <strong> Comforter,</strong> including as it does in its fulness (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:26">Romans 8:26</span> , where both, the συναντιλαμβάνεσθαι and the ὑπερεντυγχάνειν , are united) the <em> Advocate</em> also, has been both here and in Germany ( <em> Troster</em> , Luther) sanctioned by Christian usage as the most adequate rendering. See Archdeacon Hare’s Mission of the Comforter, vol. ii. note J a. He shews that Wicliff, from whom we have our <strong> Comforter,</strong> often used “comfort” for the Latin <em> comfortari</em> , as e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:43">Luke 22:43</span> ; Act 9:19 alli [194] . Thus the idea of <em> help and strength</em> is conveyed by it, as well as of consolation.

<p>It was this office (comfortari) which Jesus had filled to His disciples while with them: and which the Holy Spirit was to fill even more abundantly (and in a higher sense, because their state would be higher) on the removal of Jesus from them.</p>
