<b> 16.]</b> And<i> then</i> the Spirit shall proceed forth upon you. The word rendered<b> I will pray</b> betokens, probably, a manner of asking implying<i> actual presence and nearness</i>,—and is here used of the mediatorial office in Christ’s<i> ascended state</i>.<br><br><b> Comforter</b>—literally<b> Paraclete</b>. Olshausen remarks that the interpretations of this word range themselves in<i> two classes</i>, which again by no means exclude one another:—those of ‘COMFORTER,’ and those of ‘ADVOCATE.’ The etymology of the word requires the<i> latter</i> as its strict meaning, and in this strict meaning it satisfies 1 John ii. 1, “<i>we have an</i><b> Advocate</b> (<b>Paraclete</b>, as here)<i> with the Father</i>,” but not so all the places where it is used<i> of the Holy Spirit</i>,—nor this verse, where of the Son and Spirit both. And therefore the other meaning,—<b>Comforter</b>, including as it does in its fulness (see Rom. viii. 26, where both, the<i> helping</i> and the<i> interceding</i>, are united) the<i> Advocate</i> also, has been both here and in Germany (Luther has the equivalent term) sanctioned by Christian usage as the most adequate rendering. Wicliff, from whom we have our word<b> Comforter</b>, often used ‘comfort’ for the Latin<i> confortari</i>, which means to strengthen, as e.g. Luke xxii, 43; Acts ix. 19&c. Thus the idea of<i> help and strength</i> is conveyed by it, as well as of consolation. It was this office, of Comforter in this double sense, which Jesus had filled to His disciples while with them:—and which the Holy Spirit was to fill even more abundantly (and in a higher sense, because their state would be higher) on the removal of Jesus from them.
