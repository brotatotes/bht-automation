<b> 17.]</b> This Comforter is, not ‘the true Spirit,’—but ‘THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH;’—the Spirit<i> Who is truth</i>, 1 John v. 6,—of Whom all truth comes, and who alone leads into<i> the whole truth</i>, the truth of God, ch. xvi. 13.<br><br><b> the world]</b> equivalent to the “<i>carnal</i>” of 1 Cor. ii. 14 (where see note), those who live according to the desires of the flesh and the mind, and have no receptivity of the things of God.<br><br><b> beholdeth]</b> This word<b> behold</b>, when used in a spiritual sense, is sometimes equivalent to<b> know</b>: but this cannot be so here, because it is separated from<b> knoweth</b> by<b> neither</b>: ‘<i>recognizes not</i> in His operations,<i> nor knows</i>:’—<b>has neither sight nor knowledge of</b>.<br><br><b> ye know him]</b> present, but spoken of their state as disciples opposed to the world,—and by anticipation, as before. They were even now not of the world (ch. xv. 19), and are therefore viewed in the completion of their state as opposed to it.<b> dwelleth</b> (not<i> shall</i><i> dwell</i>) is future in<i> signification</i>, as any present assertion of that which is to be permanent must necessarily be;<b> abideth</b>, as in ch, viii, 35. Euthymius understands<b> dwelleth with you</b>, of the Spirit abiding<br><br><i> in Jesus</i>, who was among them: but. wrongly.<br><br><b> is in you]</b> This was perhaps corrected to the future, “<i>shall be</i>,” because, though their knowledge of the Spirit proper to their complete state, and His dwelling, remaining, among them, had in some inferior sense begun,—His dwelling in them had not. With the verb in the present, the speaking by anticipation is still stronger.
