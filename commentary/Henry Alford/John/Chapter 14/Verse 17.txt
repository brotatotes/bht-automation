<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] <strong> τὸ πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀλ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not ‘the true Spirit,’ but ‘THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH;’ the Spirit <em> Who is truth</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:6">1 John 5:6</span> , of Whom all truth comes, and who alone leads into <em> the whole truth</em> , the truth of God, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13">John 16:13</span> .

<p><strong> ὁ κόσμος</strong> = οἱ ψυχικοί , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span> , those who live according to the desires of the flesh and the mind, and have no receptivity of the things of God.

<p><strong> θεωρεῖ</strong> sometimes = γινώσκει , but not here, as being separated from it by οὐδέ : ‘ <em> recognizes not</em> in His operations (obj.) <em> nor knows</em> (subj.);’ <strong> has neither sight nor knowledge of.

<p><strong> γινώσκετε</strong> present, but spoken of their state as disciples opposed to the world, and proleptically, as before. They were even now not of the world (ch. Joh 15:19 ), and are therefore viewed in the completion of their state as opposed to it.

<p><strong> μένει</strong> (not μενεῖ as Vulg. and some other vss.) is rightly explained by De Wette to be future in <em> signification</em> , as any present predication of permanence must necessarily be; <strong> abideth,</strong> as μένει , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:35">John 8:35</span> . Euthym [195] understands παρ ʼ ὑμ . μένει of the Spirit abiding <em> in Jesus</em> , Who was among them: but wrongly.

<p><strong> ἐστίν</strong> ] This was perhaps corrected to the future, because, though their knowledge of the Spirit proper to their complete state, and His dwelling, remaining, among them, had in some inferior sense begun, His dwelling <em> in</em> them had not. See Hare, Mission of the Comforter, ii. note I. With the reading <strong> ἐστίν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the prolepsis is still stronger.</p>
