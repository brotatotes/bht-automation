<b> 18.]</b> The original word should be literally rendered,<b> orphans</b>, as indeed it is in the margin of the<b> A.V.</b><br><br> The office of the Comforter is to connect the disciples with the Father: if therefore they had Him not, they would be<i> fatherless</i>. The expression is closely connected with “little children” ch. xiii. 33, and, as Euthymius says, springs from paternal compassion. This makes our Lord’s declaration, that He was coming to them, plain, as applying to the coming by the Spirit, who is one with Christ;—not only to the ultimate personal coming, which is but the last step of the Advent, nor only the bodily coming again to them and not to the world at the Resurrection, which was but a pledge of His lasting presence in the Spirit: see on ver. 3. The<b> coming</b> is (as there) the summary of these—the<i> great Revisitation</i>, in all its blessed progress. The absence of any connecting particle, as “<i>for</i>,” with this clause, arises from the depth of affection in the Lord’s heart.<br><br> Luthardt attempts to confine this<b> coming</b> (and the whole passage) to the last great Advent, 1 in spite of the plain sense of vv. 19, 20, relying on the analogy of Rev. xxii, 17, and saying that, on the common interpretation, the Church would have no cause to long for her Lord: and so Augustine and others. But manifestly the context is against them: and they must thus explain away many other pa: (e. g. Matt. xviii. 20). The presence Christ by the Spirit is none the less<i> real</i>, for being<i> incomplete</i>.
