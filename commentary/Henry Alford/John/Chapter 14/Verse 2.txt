<b> 2.]</b> This comfort—of being reunited to their Lord—is administered to them as<i> “little children,”</i> in forms of speech simple, and adapted to their powers of apprehension of spiritual things. The<b> house</b> spoken of is Heaven: Ps. xxxiii. 13, 14; Isa. lxiii. 15. In it are many (in number—it may be also in degree of dignity, but no such meaning is here conveyed) abiding-places;<i> room enough for them all</i>. If not,—if they could not follow Him thither, He would not have concealed this from them. This latter assurance is one calculated to beget entire trust and confidence; He would not in any matter hold out vain hopes to them; His word to them would plainly state all difficulties and discouragements,—as indeed He does, ch. xv. 18; xvi. 1, 4. This<i> preparing a place for us</i> is that of which we sing,— ‘When Thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, Thon didst open the Kingdom of heaven to all believers:’ see note on Luke xxiii. 43. And thus it is a<b> place</b>, not the<i> many mansions</i> that He is preparing:—<i>the place</i> as a whole, not<i> each man’s place</i> in it.
