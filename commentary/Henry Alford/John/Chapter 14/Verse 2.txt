<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] This comfort of being reunited to their Lord is administered to them as τεκνία , in forms of speech simple, and adapted to their powers of apprehension of spiritual things. The <strong> οἰκία</strong> is Heaven: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+33:13-14">Psalms 33:13-14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:15">Isaiah 63:15</span> . In it are many (in number not in degree of dignity, as Clem. Alex [185] , Basil., Theod., Chrys., Theophylact, Tert [186] , Hil [187] , Aug [188] , &amp;c., at least no such meaning is <em> here</em> conveyed) abiding-places; <em> room enough for them all;</em> ἱκαναὶ δέξασθαι καὶ ὑμᾶς συνεσομένους ἡμῖν ἀεί . Euthym [189] If not, if they could not follow Him thither, He would not have concealed this from them. This latter assurance is one calculated to beget entire trust and confidence; He would not in any matter hold out vain hopes to them; His word to them would plainly state all difficulties and discouragements, as indeed He does, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:18">John 15:18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:1">John 16:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:4">John 16:4</span> ; which last verse <strong> ἵνα μνημ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ὅτι ἐγὼ εἶπον ὑμῖν</strong> , is decisive for the above interpretation here, against those who would join ὅτι πορεύομαι … with εἷπον ἂν ὑμῖν (Euthym [190] , Aug [191] , Erasm., Luther, Bengel): which besides does violence to the next verse, where the ‘going to prepare a place’ is stated as a <em> fact</em> . The <strong> ὅτι</strong> may, it is true, have been inserted as a <strong> ὅτι</strong> <em> recitantis</em> , to favour the view just controverted: but it is much more probably genuine, signifying <strong> because,</strong> and belongs to the whole sense of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1-2">John 14:1-2</span> , as a reason why their heart should not be troubled.

<p>The sense confidently proposed for the <strong> many mansions</strong> by a correspondent, that He was going to <em> one part</em> of His Father’s house, while they would remain in <em> another</em> , that house being not Heaven, but the Universe, is entirely put out of the question, as being frigid in the extreme under the solemn circumstances, as being contrary to all Scripture analogy of expression, and as inconsistent with the <strong> πορεὑομαι ἑτοιμάσαι τόπον ὑμῖν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> where the τόπος is of necessity correlative with the μοναί , which are in that οἰκία whither He is going. Besides, their earthly μικρὸς χρόνος could in no sense be called a <strong> μονή</strong> <strong> .</strong> The <strong> ἑτοιμάσαι τόπον</strong> is that of which we sing, “When Thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, Thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers:” see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:43">Luke 23:43</span> . And thus it is <strong> τόπον</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not τὰς μονάς : <em> the place</em> as a whole, not <em> each man’s place</em> in it.</p>
