 2. ] This comfort of being reunited to their Lord is administered to them as τεκνία , in forms of speech simple, and adapted to their powers of apprehension of spiritual things. The  οἰκία is Heaven: Psalms 33:13-14 ; Isaiah 63:15 . In it are many (in number not in degree of dignity, as Clem. Alex [185] , Basil., Theod., Chrys., Theophylact, Tert [186] , Hil [187] , Aug [188] , &c., at least no such meaning is  here conveyed) abiding-places;  room enough for them all; ἱκαναὶ δέξασθαι καὶ ὑμᾶς συνεσομένους ἡμῖν ἀεί . Euthym [189] If not, if they could not follow Him thither, He would not have concealed this from them. This latter assurance is one calculated to beget entire trust and confidence; He would not in any matter hold out vain hopes to them; His word to them would plainly state all difficulties and discouragements, as indeed He does, ch. John 15:18 ; John 16:1 ; John 16:4 ; which last verse  ἵνα μνημ  …   ὅτι ἐγὼ εἶπον ὑμῖν , is decisive for the above interpretation here, against those who would join ὅτι πορεύομαι … with εἷπον ἂν ὑμῖν (Euthym [190] , Aug [191] , Erasm., Luther, Bengel): which besides does violence to the next verse, where the ‘going to prepare a place’ is stated as a  fact . The  ὅτι may, it is true, have been inserted as a  ὅτι  recitantis , to favour the view just controverted: but it is much more probably genuine, signifying  because, and belongs to the whole sense of John 14:1-2 , as a reason why their heart should not be troubled.

	The sense confidently proposed for the  many mansions by a correspondent, that He was going to  one part of His Father’s house, while they would remain in  another , that house being not Heaven, but the Universe, is entirely put out of the question, as being frigid in the extreme under the solemn circumstances, as being contrary to all Scripture analogy of expression, and as inconsistent with the  πορεὑομαι ἑτοιμάσαι τόπον ὑμῖν  , where the τόπος is of necessity correlative with the μοναί , which are in that οἰκία whither He is going. Besides, their earthly μικρὸς χρόνος could in no sense be called a  μονή  . The  ἑτοιμάσαι τόπον is that of which we sing, “When Thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, Thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers:” see note on Luke 23:43 . And thus it is  τόπον  , not τὰς μονάς :  the place as a whole, not  each man’s place in it.
