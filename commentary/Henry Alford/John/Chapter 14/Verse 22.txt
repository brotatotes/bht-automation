	[  καί preceding an interrogation, expresses astonishment at what has just been said, and, assuming it, connects to it a conclusion which appears to refute or cast doubt on it. So Eur. Med. 1388, ὦ τέκνα φίλτατα ! “ μητρί γε , σοὶ δ ʼ οὔ .” κἄπειτ ʼ ἔκτας ; See more examples in Hartung, i. p. 146, and cf. Kühner on Xen. Mem. p. 117.]
	 τί γέγ  .   ὅτι ]  What has happened, that …? i.e.  how is it, that …?
