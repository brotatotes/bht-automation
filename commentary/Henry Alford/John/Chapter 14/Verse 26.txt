<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] q. d. ‘I know that ye do not understand them yet: but’ &amp;c.
	</p>
<p><strong> τὸ πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὸ ἅγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The Paraclete is now more closely defined by this well-known Name, and, by ὃ πέμψει ὁ πατήρ , and ἐκεῖνος …, designated <em> personally</em> , as One sent, and One acting on them.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν τῷ ὀν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> μου</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not, ‘in My stead,’ but <strong> in regard of Me</strong> ‘in answer to My prayer, and prayers in My name, to those who bear My name, and as a means of manifesting Me.’
	</p>
<p><strong> διδάξ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πάντα</strong> stands by itself, not with ἃ εἶπον : <strong> shall teach you all things;</strong> ‘all that can and may be learnt by you, all that belongs to your work and life in Me.’
	</p>
<p><strong> ὑπομνήσει</strong> ] What is <em> not understood</em> is liable to be <em> forgotten;</em> and therefore in this word is implied the giving them a right understanding of, as well as recalling, what Jesus had said to them: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:22">John 2:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:16">John 12:16</span> .
	</p>
<p><em> It is on the fulfilment of this promise to the Apostles, that their sufficiency as Witnesses of all that the Lord did and taught, and consequently</em> THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE GOSPEL NARRATIVE, <em> is grounded</em> .</p>
