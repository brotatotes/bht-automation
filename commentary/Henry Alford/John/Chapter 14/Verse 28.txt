<b> 28.</b>] The former part of the verse gives a reason why their heart should not be<i> troubled</i>;—then the rest of the verse removes all ground of fear, since it is an<i> exaltation</i> of Him whom they loved, which is about to happen; and therefore a ground of joy, and not of fear.<br><br><b> my Father is greater than I</b>] And therefore the<i> going</i> of Jesus<i> to the Father</i> is an<i> advancement</i>. This word<b> greater</b>, as Luther well remarks, is not here used as referring to the<i> Nature or Essence of the Son as related to the Father</i>,—but as indicating that particular subordination to the Father in which the Lord Jesus then was,—and the cessation of the state of humiliation, and entering into His glory, which would take place on His being received up to the Father. So also Calvin: “Christ is not here comparing the Divinity of the Father with His own, nor His human nature with the divine essence of the Father, but rather His present state with the heavenly glory to which He was soon to be exalted.” And Cocceius: “The inferiority here is not to be understood as meaning, according to His human nature; for the words point to an inferiority which would be<i> laid aside, on His going to the Father</i>.” And this removes all reason for fear, as<i> they</i> will be exalted in<i> Him</i>.<br><br> The whole doctrinal controversy which has been raised on these words (especially by the Fathers against the Arians), seems not to belong to the sense of the passage. That<i> there</i> ts<i> a sense</i> in which the Father is greater than even the<i> glorified</i> Son, is beyond doubt (see especially 1 Cor. xv. 27 f.); but as on the one hand that concession is no concession to Arianism, because it is not in the essential being of the Son, but in His Mediatorial office, that this His inferiority consists,—so on the other hand this verse implies in itself<i> no such</i> inferiority, the discourse being of<i> another kind</i>.
