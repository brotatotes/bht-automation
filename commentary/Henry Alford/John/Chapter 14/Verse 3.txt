	In order to understand this, we must bear in mind what Stier well calls the ‘perspective’ of prophecy. The  coming again of the Lord is not one single act, as His resurrection, or the descent of the Spirit, or His second personal advent, or the final coming to judgment; but the  great complex of all these, the result of which shall be, His taking His people to Himself to be where He is. This  ἔρχομαι  , is  begun ( Joh 14:18 ) in His Resurrection  carried on ( Joh 14:23 ) in the  spiritual life (see also ch. John 16:22 f.), the making  them ready for the place prepared; -  further advanced when each by death is fetched away to be with Him ( Php 1:23 );  fully completed at His coming in glory, when they shall for ever be with Him ( 1Th 4:17 ) in the perfected resurrection state.
