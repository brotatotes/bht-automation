<b> 3.]</b> In order to understand this, we must bear in mind what Stier well calls the ‘perspective’ of prophecy. The<i> coming again of the Lord</i> is not one single act,—as His resurrection, or the descent of the Spirit, or His second personal advent, or the final coming to judgment; but the<i> great summary</i> of all these, the result of which shall be, His taking His people to Himself to be where He is. This coming of His is<i> begun</i> (ver. 18) in His Resurrection—<i>carried</i> on (ver. 23) in the<i> spiritual life</i> (see also ch. xvi. 22 ff.), the making<i> them</i> ready for the place prepared;—<i>further advanced</i> when each by death is fetched away to be with Him (Phil. i. 23):<i> fully completed</i> at His coming in glory, when they shall for ever be with Him (1 Thess. iv. 17) in the perfected resurrection state.
