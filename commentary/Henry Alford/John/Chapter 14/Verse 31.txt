<b> 31.</b>] ‘But My Death is an act of voluntary obedience, that it may be known that I love and obey the Father—that the glory of the Father in and by Me may be manifested.’ The construction is elliptic: supply, ‘But (his power over Me for death will be permitted by Me) that,’&c. And the period should be at<b> so I do</b>, as in the text.<br><br> Meyer and others would put only a comma here, and carry on the sense, ‘<i>But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, thus I do, arise, let us go hence</i>.’ I need only put it to the inner feeling of any who have learned to appreciate the majesty and calmness of our Lord’s discourses, whether a sentence so savouring of theatrical effect is likely to have been spoken by Him. We may notwithstanding safely believe that the words “<i>Arise, let us go hence,” without this connexion</i>, do undoubtedly express the holy boldness of the Lord in going to meet that which was to come upon Him, and are for that reason inserted hy St. John.<br><br><b> Arise, let us go hence</b>] These words imply a movement from the table to depart. Probably the rest of the discourse, and the prayer, ch. xvii., were delivered when now all were standing ready to depart. There would be some little pause, in which the preparations for departure would be made. But the<i> place</i> is clearly the same, see ch. xviii. 1, “<i>when Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth</i>:”—besides which, we can hardly suppose, as Grotius and others, discourses of a character like those in ch. xv. xvi. to have been delivered to as many as eleven persons, while<i> walking by the way</i>, and in a time of such publicity as that of the Paschal feast. Still less is the supposition of Bengel and Beausobre probable,—that ch. xiii. xiv. happened outside the city, and that between ch. xiv. and xv. the paschal meal takes place. Compare also ch. xiii. 30, which is decisive against this idea.
