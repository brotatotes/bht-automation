It is another side of the same idea of<i> the Way</i>;—God being true, and only approached by and in truth. Christ IS THE TRUTH, in Whom only (Col. ii. 3) that Knowledge of Him is gained, which (ch. xvii. 3) is eternal life.<br><br><b> the life]</b> not merely because “not even death shall separate you from Me,” Euthymius:—but as being THE LIFE (see ver. 19: Gal. ii. 20) of all His in Whom only they who live can come to the living Father (ch. vi. 57).<br><br><b> no man cometh unto the Father, but by me...]</b> This plainly states<i> whither</i> He was going, and<i> the way</i> also: He was going<i> to the Father</i>: and the way was,<i> through Him-self</i>.
