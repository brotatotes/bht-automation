	 ἀπ  ʼ   ἄρτι ] There is no difficulty, if we bear in mind the  νῦν of ch. John 13:31 . The  henceforth is the future time, beginning with our Lord’s glorification, which was now at hand. Lücke remarks: “ ἀπ ʼ ἄρτι is not entirely future nor entirely present, but the moment of transition, the identification of the present and future. Christ speaks here proleptically, in reference to the hour of His glorification being come” (ii. 598).
