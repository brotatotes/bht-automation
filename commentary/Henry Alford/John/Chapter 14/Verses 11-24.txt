 11 24. ]  Jesus will make proof of His abiding union with the Father, in His union with His own: and this, John 14:12-14 ,  in answering prayer: John 14:15-17 ,  in the sending of the Spirit: John 14:18 ff.,  as a pledge of the completion of this union in His personal return . The Lord now unfolds out of this  ποιεῖ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ  , the great promise of the Paraclete.
	 διὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτά ] See ch. John 10:38 . The object here seems to be, to fix their attention on the  works as a plain testimony even to such as could not simply believe so deep a thing on His assertion (  πιστ  . μοι ), and one which ( Joh 14:12 ) should become subjective in themselves hereafter, by virtue of their living union with Him who is gone to the Father, and become the dispenser and channel of the Spirit. “Qui Christo de se loquenti credit, in Christum credit.” Bengel.
	 μείζ  .   τούτων ] This word  μείζ  . is not to be evaded (so as to = πλείονα , Lampe), but taken in its full strict sense. And the keys to its meaning will be found ch. John 1:51 ; John 5:20 .  The works which Jesus did, His Apostles also did, scil., raising the dead, &c.  greater works than those , they did, not in  degree , but  in kind: spiritual works, under the dispensation of the Spirit, which  had not yet come in . But they did them,  not as separate from Him: but  in Him, and  by Him; and so (ch. Joh 5:21 )  He is said to do them. The work which He did by Peter’s sermon, Acts 2:0 , was one of these μείζονα τούτων , the first-fruits of the unspeakable gift.
	This union of them with and in Him is expressed here by τὰ ἔρ .  ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ ,  κἀκεῖνος ποιήσει .
