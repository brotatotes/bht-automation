 19 21. ] This ἔρχομαι is explained to consist in His presence among them by the life of His Resurrection, which is theirs; by ( Joh 14:20 ) the witness of the Spirit in their hearts; and ( Joh 14:21 ) their sanctification by the Spirit in love, and the consequent manifestation of Jesus to them.
	Luthardt (ii. p. 309 f.) attempts to confine ἔρχομαι (and this whole passage) to the παρουσία , in spite of the plain sense of John 14:19-20 , relying on the analogy of Revelation 22:17 , and saying that on the common interpretation, the Church would have no cause to long for her Lord: and so Aug [198] , Maldon., Hofm., alli [199] . But manifestly the context is against him: and he must thus explain away many other passages (e.g. Mat 18:20 ). The presence of Christ by the Spirit is none the less  real , for being  incomplete .
