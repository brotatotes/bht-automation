 13. ] A difficulty has been unnecessarily found in this verse, because St. Paul, Romans 5:6 ff., cites it as a nobler instance of love, that Christ died for us  when we were enemies . But manifestly  here the example is from common life, in which if a man did lay down his life it would naturally be for his friends; and would be, and is cited as, the greatest example of love. Nor again is there any doctrinal difficulty: our Lord does not assert of himself, that He laid down his life  only for his friends (as defined in the next verse), but puts forward  this side of his Love as a great and a practical example for his followers. His own great Sacrifice of Himself lies in the background of this verse; but only in the background, and with but one side of it seen, viz. his Love to  them . See 1 Timothy 4:10 , and compare 1 John 3:16 .
	 ἵνα  , as in John 15:8 , depends on αὕτη , not on any  will implied in ἀγάπη (De Wette), nor used ἐκβατικῶς (Olsh.), and answers to ‘scilicet, ut:’ see on this use of ἵνα , note on 1 Corinthians 14:13 .
	Joh 15:14 parallel to John 15:10 , and, like it, guarded, in John 15:15-17 , from legal misinterpretation.
	John 15:15  proleptically spoken, of the state in which He would place them under the Spirit. Nor is there any discrepancy with ch. John 13:13 ; John 13:16 , and Joh 15:20 here, which are also spoken of their future condition: for in that sense both relations subsist together. It is the  lower sense of δοῦλος which is brought out in this verse. The proleptical character of the saying is clearly shewn in the οὐκ οἶδεν τί ποιεῖ ὁ κ ., for this was precisely their  present condition, but was after His Ascension changed into light and knowledge.
	 ἐγνώρισα ὑμ  . ] Here again the allusion must be (see ch. Joh 16:12 ) to their future state under the dispensation of the Spirit: nay, even to the fulness and completion of  it , as Aug [214] remarks, Tract. lxxxvi. 1, vol. iii. pt. ii.: compare the confession of one of the greatest Apostles, 1 Corinthians 13:10 . “Sicut immortalitatem carnis et salutem animarum futuram exspectamus, quamvis jam pignore accepto salvi facti esse dicamur: ita omnium notitiam quæcumque Unigenitus audivit a Patre, futuram sperare debemus, quamvis hoc jam se fecisse dixerit Christus.” Aug [215] ut supra.
