<b> 13</b>.] A difficulty has been unnecessarily found in this verse, because St. Paul, Rom. v. 6 ff, cites it as a nobler instance of love, that Christ died for us<i> when we were enemies</i>. But manifestly<i> here</i> the example is from common life, in which if a man did Jay down his life, it would naturally be for his friends; and would be, and is cited as, the greatest example of love. Nor again is there any doctrinal difficulty: our Lord does not assert of himself, that He laid down his life<i> only</i> for his friends (as defined in the next verse), but puts forward<i> this side</i> of his Love as a great and a practical example for his followers. His own great Sacrifice of Himself lies in the background of this verse; but only in the background, and with but one side of it seen, viz. his Love<i> to them</i>. See 1 Tim. iv. 10, and compare 1 John iii. 16.
