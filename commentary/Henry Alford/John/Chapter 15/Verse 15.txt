It is the<i> lower sense</i> of the word rendered<b> servant</b> (signifying both<i> servant</i> and<i> slave</i>), which is brought out in this verse. The anticipatory character of the saying is clearly shewn in the words, “<i>Knoweth not what his lord doeth</i>;” for this was precisely their<i> present</i> condition, but was after His Ascension changed into light and knowledge.<b> I made known unto you</b>] Here again the allusion must be (see chi. xvi. 12) to their future state under the dispensation of the Spirit: nay, even to the fulness and completion of<i> it</i>, as Augustine remarks; compare the confession of one of the greatest. Apostles, 1 Cor. 10. “As we look for immortality of the flesh and salvation of the soul in the future, although, having received the pledge of both, we are said to be already saved: so we should hope for in the future the knowledge of all things which the Only-begotten has heard from the Father, although Christ says He has already made them known to us.” Augustine.
