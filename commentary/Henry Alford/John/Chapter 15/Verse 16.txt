Chrysostom and others explain it as meaning “<i>planted</i>,” in reference to the similitude of the<i> vine</i>. But the parable seems to be no further returned to than in the allusion implied in<i> bearing fruit</i>. “<i>Ordained</i>,” in A, V., is objectionable, as conveying a wrong idea, that of<i> appointing to the Ministry</i>, which is not here present.<br><br><b> that ye should go and bear fruit</b>] The word go probably merely expresses (see Matt. xvili. 15; xix. 21, and Luke viii. 14) the activity of living and developing principle; not the missionary journeys of the Apostles, as some have explained it. The fruit is not the Church, to be founded by the Apostles, and endure;—this is evident, for here the fruit is spoken of with reference to<i> themselves</i>, ard their ripening into the full stature of Christ. Much of their fruit will be necessarily the winning of others to Christ: but that is not<i> the prominent</i> idea here.<br><br><b> that your fruit should remain</b>] See 2 John 8; Rev. xiv. 13.<br><br><b> that whatsoever ye ask...</b>] This second that is parallel with the former one, not the result of it; the two, the bringing forth of fruit and the obtaining answer to prayer, being co-ordinate with each other; but (vv. 7, 8) the bearing fruit to God’s glory is of these the greater, being the result and aim of the other.
