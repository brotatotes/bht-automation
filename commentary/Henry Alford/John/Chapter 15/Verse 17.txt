<b> 17.</b>] The expression<b> these things</b> refers (as almost always in John, see verses 11, 21; xvi. 1, 25, 33; xvii. 1; xviii. 1 al.) back to what has gone before. ‘The object of my enjoining these things on you is (for all since ver. 12 has been an expansion of the words<i> “as I loved you”</i>) that ye love one another’ (see 1 John iv. 11). Then from the indefiniteness of this term,<b> one another</b>, our Lord takes occasion to forewarn them that however wide their love to one another, they cannot bring all within this category; there will be still<b> the world</b> outside, which will hate them.
