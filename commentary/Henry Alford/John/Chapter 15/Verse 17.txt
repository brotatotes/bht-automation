 17. ]  ταῦτα refers (as almost always in John, see John 15:11 ; John 15:21 ; John 16:1 ; John 16:25 ; John 16:33 ; John 17:1 ; Joh 18:1 alli [216] .) back to what has gone before. ‘The object of my enjoining these things on you is (for all since Joh 15:12 has been an expansion of  καθὼς ἠγ  .   ὑμ  . ) that ye love one another’ (see 1Jn 4:11 ). Then from the indefiniteness of this word ἀλλήλους our Lord takes occasion to forewarn them that however wide their love to one another, they cannot bring all within this category; there will be ὁ κόσμος , which will hate them.
