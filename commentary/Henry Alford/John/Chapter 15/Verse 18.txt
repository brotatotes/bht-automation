 18. ] See ch. John 7:7 .  γινώσκετε  , most probably  imperative ,  know ye .… The  assertion of their knowledge of the fact would in all likelihood be conveyed in the past tense, οἴδατε , or ἔγνωτε , or ἐγνώκατε : cf. for the imperative, ch. Luke 24:43 ; Luke 10:11 ; Luke 12:39 ; Galatians 3:7 ; Hebrews 13:23 ; for the indicative, ch. John 14:17 : Acts 20:34 ; 2 Corinthians 8:9 ; Philippians 2:22 ; 1 John 2:29 (see note there); John 4:2 ; for both combined, Matthew 24:32-33 [217] ; for the past tense in assertion, Luke 16:4 ; ch. John 5:42 ; John 6:69 ; John 8:52 ; Joh 8:55 alli [218] . The great proof of this hatred to Him was yet to come, but is viewed as past. This knowledge brings comfort, 1 Peter 4:12-13 .

When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .

	In  τὸ ἴδιον ἐφίλει , not ὑμᾶς ἐφ ., we have the true practice of the world hinted at, and the false character of the world’s love, as a mere φιλαυτία , set forth. “  Suum dicitur pro  vos , atque sic notatur  Interesse mundi,” Bengel. In this ‘loving their own,’ the children of this world fall into hating one another.
	Meyer remarks the solemnity of κόσμος thus repeated five times.
