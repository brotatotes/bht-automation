<b> 2.</b>] The Vine contains<i> fruitful</i> and<i> unfruitful</i> branches. Who are these<i> unfruitful</i> branches?<i> Who are the branches?</i> Clearly, all those who, adopting the parallel image, are made<i> members</i> of Christ by baptism, Rom. vi. 3, 4; compare<i> “planted together,”</i> ib. ver. 5, also Rom. xi. 17 ff. The Vine is<i> the visible Church here</i>, of which Christ is the<i> inclusive</i> Head: the Vine<i> contains</i> the branches; hence the unfruitful, as well as the fruitful, are in Me.<br><br> Every such unfruitful branch the Father pulls off and casts away: and every one that beareth fruit He prunes, by cleansing it of its worthless parts, and shortening its rank growth, that it may ripen and enlarge its fruit better.
