 2. ] The Vine contains  fruitful , and  unfruitful branches. Who are these unfruitful branches?  Who are the branches? Clearly, all those who, adopting the parallel image, are made  members of Christ by baptism, Romans 6:3-4 ; compare  σύμφυτοι  , ib. Romans 15:5 , also Romans 11:17 ff. The Vine is  the visible Church here , of which Christ is the  inclusive Head: the Vine  contains the branches; hence the unfruitful, as well as the fruitful, are  ἐν ἐμοί  .
	Every such unfruitful branch (notice the  μή in an hypothesis, not οὐ ) the Father  αἴρει  , pulls off and casts away: and every one that beareth fruit He  καθαίρει (an allusion to αἴρει , but only in the Greek (?): “suavis rhythmus,” Bengel), prunes, by cleansing it of its worthless parts, and shortening its rank growth, that it may ripen and enlarge its fruit better. Cf. Æsch. in Ctes. (iii. 166, quoting Demosthenes), ἀμπελουργοῦσί τινες τὴν πόλιν ἀνατετμήκασί τινες τὰ κλήματα τοῦ δήμου .
	The two,  πᾶν κλ  .,   καὶ πᾶν  .…, are pendent nominatives, a construction usual with John in connexion with πᾶν , see ch. John 6:39 ; John 17:2 .
