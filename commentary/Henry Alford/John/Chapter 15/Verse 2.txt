<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] The Vine contains <em> fruitful</em> , and <em> unfruitful</em> branches. Who are these unfruitful branches? <em> Who are the branches?</em> Clearly, all those who, adopting the parallel image, are made <em> members</em> of Christ by baptism, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3-4">Romans 6:3-4</span> ; compare <strong> σύμφυτοι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:5">Romans 15:5</span> , also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:17">Romans 11:17</span> ff. The Vine is <em> the visible Church here</em> , of which Christ is the <em> inclusive</em> Head: the Vine <em> contains</em> the branches; hence the unfruitful, as well as the fruitful, are <strong> ἐν ἐμοί</strong> <strong> .
	</strong></p>
<p>Every such unfruitful branch (notice the <strong> μή</strong> in an hypothesis, not οὐ ) the Father <strong> αἴρει</strong> <strong> ,</strong> pulls off and casts away: and every one that beareth fruit He <strong> καθαίρει</strong> (an allusion to αἴρει , but only in the Greek (?): “suavis rhythmus,” Bengel), prunes, by cleansing it of its worthless parts, and shortening its rank growth, that it may ripen and enlarge its fruit better. Cf. Æsch. in Ctes. (iii. 166, quoting Demosthenes), ἀμπελουργοῦσί τινες τὴν πόλιν ἀνατετμήκασί τινες τὰ κλήματα τοῦ δήμου .

<p>The two, <strong> πᾶν κλ</strong> <strong> ., </strong> <strong> καὶ πᾶν</strong> <strong> .…,</strong> are pendent nominatives, a construction usual with John in connexion with πᾶν , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:2">John 17:2</span> .</p>
