 20. ] Ch. John 13:16 , but with a different reference: the sense here being, ‘Remember the saying, for it is true in this matter also:’ see Matthew 10:24 , where it is used in the same sense. The subject of ἐδίωξαν is ὁ κόσμος as a noun of number.
	A difficulty has been raised on ἐτήρησαν … τηρήσουσιν , and some have wanted to give this word a hostile sense, (as παρατηρεῖν ,) quoting Matthew 27:36 , and Genesis 3:15 (which is altogether an exceptional use, the reading being undoubtedly genuine): see also Jeremiah 20:13 . But in John this cannot be. Nor is  irony (Lampe, Stier) in this latter clause at all in keeping with the solemnity of the discourse. The words simply mean (as Thl.), ‘the keeping My word and the keeping yours are intimately joined, and when you find the world or any part of the world do the first, you may infer the other.’ The issue of εἰ τ . λ . μ . ἐτήρ . was to be proved by their rejection and killing of the Lord Jesus.
	Beware of rendering as Kuinoel, “  If they had kept my word, they would keep yours ,” which is ungrammatical. The only idiomatic rendering in English is that of the E. V.,  If they have kept [or rather,  If they kept ]  my word they will keep yours.
