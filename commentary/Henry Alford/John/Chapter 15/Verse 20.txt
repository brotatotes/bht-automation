<b> 20.</b>] Our Lord had said it to them in ch. xiii. 16, but with a different reference: the sense here being, ‘Remember the saying, for it is true in this matter also;’ see Matt. x. 24, where it is used in the same sense.<b> They</b>, i.e.<i> the world</i>—the persons constituting it.<br><br> A difficulty has been raised on the latter clause of this verse, because “<i>they</i>” did not im any sense “<i>keep</i>” Christ’s word, whereas they did persecute Him: and an attempt has been made to give to the word “<i>keep</i>” the sense of<i> watching</i> with a hostile intent, which it will not bear. Nor is<i> irony</i> (Lampe, Stier) in this latter clause at all in keeping with the solemnity of the discourse. There is no real difficulty: the words simply mean, ‘the keeping My word and the keeping yours are intimately joined, and when you find the world or any part of the world do the first, you may infer the other.” The issue of the condition, “<i>If they kept My saying</i>,” was to be proved by their rejection and killing of the Lord Jesus.
