<b> 22.</b>]<i> The sinfulness of this hate</i>. See ch. ix. 41 and note.<br><br><b> If I had not come and spoken unto them,</b> i.e.<b> discoursed to them</b>, generally: not,<i> acquainted them with their sin</i>. The<i> sin</i> spoken of is, not the generally sinful state of the world,â€”nor the sin of unbelief in Christ, which they of course could not have committed, had He never come: but,<i> the sin of hatred to Him and His</i>, which might have been excused otherwise, but now that He had come and discoursed with them, had no excuse, since He had plainly shewn them the proofs of His mission from the Father.<br><br> Thus He shews that they embraced the side of evil of their own accord, and had no pretext of self-justification.
