To suppose any irony in these words, as De Wette does ( ‘they are<i> true</i><i> followers</i>-<i>out of their law’</i>), is manifestly against, the whole spirit of our Lord’s reference to the law. It is called ‘<i>their</i> law,’— “the law which they are ever turning over and vaunting themselves about,” as Bengel says,—as condemning them, though their boast and pride.<br><br><b> without a cause</b>, as answering to “<i>they have no excuse for their sin</i>,” ver, 22.<br><br> The citation is probably from Psalm lxix., which treats of the rejection and sufferings of the Messiah.
