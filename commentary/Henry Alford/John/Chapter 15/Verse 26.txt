<b> 26.</b>] This assurance carries on the testimony concerning Christ,—which the world should see and hear, and yet reject and hate Him,—even to the end of time, by means of the Spirit of Truth: so that on the one hand this<b> seeing and hating</b> must not be expected to cease as long as the Spirit bears this witness,—and on the other, He, the Spirit of Truth, will never cease to overcome the hating world by this His testimony.<br><br><b> the Comforter</b> (<b>Paraclete</b>)] See ch. xiv. 16 and note.<br><br><b> whom I will send</b>] Stier dwells on the accurate division of the clauses here, “<i>the Comforter</i><b> whom I will send</b>,”—but “<i>the Spirit of Truth</i><b> which proceedeth from the Father</b>.” The first clause he regards as spoken with reference to the mediatorial dispensation, of the Spirit in His office as Paraclete, sent from the Father by the glorified Son (or, by the Father in the Son’s name, ch. xiv. 26), and bringing in the dispensation of the Spirit;—the second, in strictness of theological meaning, of the essential nature of the Spirit Himself, that He<i> proceedeth forth from the Father</i>. (And if from the Father, from the Son also,—see ch. xvi. 15, and those passages where the Spirit is said to be<i> His</i> Spirit, Rom. viii. 9; Gal. iv. 6; Phil. i. 19; 1 Pet. i. 11, also Rev. xxii. 1.) Perhaps however it is better to take<i> the whole</i> as spoken with reference to the mediatorial dispensation. Then the former description is<i> parallel with</i> the latter, and the procession from the Father<i> is</i> the sending by the Son. At all events,<i> this passage</i>, as Beza remarks, cannot be alleged either one way or the other in the controversy with the Greek church, which maintains that the Holy Spirit proceeds from<i> the Father alone</i>, not as we (see Nicene Creed)<i> from the Father and the Son</i>.
