 26. ] This assurance carries on the testimony concerning Christ, which the world should see and hear, and yet reject and hate Him, even to the end of time, by means of the Spirit of Truth: so that on the one hand this  seeing and hating must not be expected to cease as long as the Spirit bears this witness, and on the other, He, the Spirit of Truth, will never cease to overcome the hating world by this His testimony.

	 ὃν ἐγὼ πέμψω ] Stier (whose comment on this verse should be consulted) dwells on the accurate division of the clauses here, ὁ παράκλ .  ὃν ἐγὼ πέμψω , but τὸ πνεῦμα τ . ἀληθ .  ὃ παρὰ τ . πατρὸς ἐκπορεύεται . The first clause he regards as spoken œconomically, of the Spirit in His office as Paraclete, sent from the Father by the glorified Son (or, by the Father in the Son’s name, ch. Joh 14:26 ), and bringing in the dispensation of the Spirit; the second ontologically, of the essential nature of the Spirit Himself, that He  proceeded forth from the Father . (And if from the Father, from the Son also, see ch. John 16:15 , and those passages where the Spirit is said to be  His Spirit, Romans 8:9 ; Galatians 4:6 ; Philippians 1:19 ; 1 Peter 1:11 ; also Revelation 22:1 .) Perhaps however it is better to take  the whole œconomically, as Luthardt has done. Then ὃν ἐγὼ πέμψω παρὰ τ . π . is  parallel with ὃ παρὰ τοῦ π . ἐκπορεύεται , and the procession from the Father  is the sending by the Son. At all events,  this passage , as Beza remarks, cannot be alleged either one way or the other in the controversy with the Greek Church on the procession of the Holy Spirit. See this done in the interest of the Greek view, by Theodor. Mops [221] in loc.
