<b> 27.</b>] The disciples are not, as some have supposed, here mentioned as witnesses<i> separate from</i> and<i> working with</i> the Holy Spirit. The witness is<i> one and the same</i>; the Spirit will witness in and by them: the introductory clause,<b> when the Comforter is come</b>, belongs to the whole; see Luke xxiv. 48, 49, where this is strongly expressed. This verse alludes to the historical witness which the Holy Ghost in the ministers and eye-witnesses of the word, Luke i. 2, should enable them to give,—which forms the<i> human side</i> of this great testimony of the Spirit of truth, and OF WHICH OUR INSPIRED GOSPELS ARE THE SUMMARY: the<i> Divine side</i> being, His own indwelling testimony in the life and heart of every believer in all time. But both the one and the other are given<i> by the self-same</i> SPIRIT;—neither of them inconsistent with, or superseding the other.
