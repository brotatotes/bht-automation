The witness is<i> one and the same</i>; the Spirit will witness in and by them: the introductory clause,<b> when the Comforter is come</b>, belongs to the whole; see Luke xxiv. 48, 49, where this is strongly expressed. This verse alludes to the historical witness which the Holy Ghost in the ministers and eye-witnesses of the word, Luke i. 2, should enable them to give,—which forms the<i> human side</i> of this great testimony of the Spirit of truth, and OF WHICH OUR INSPIRED GOSPELS ARE THE SUMMARY: the<i> Divine side</i> being, His own indwelling testimony in the life and heart of every believer in all time. But both the one and the other are given<i> by the self-same</i> SPIRIT;—neither of them inconsistent with, or superseding the other.<br><br><b> from the beginning</b>, as in Luke i. 2, and in the sense of Acts i. 21;— ‘from the beginning of the Lord’s ministry,’ The present tenses set forth the connexion between the being (continuing to be) witnesses, and the being (having been throughout) companions of the Lord in His ministry. Thus we have in 1 John iii. 8, “<i>the devil sinneth from the beginning</i>.”
