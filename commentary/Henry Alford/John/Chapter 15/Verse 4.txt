<b> 4.</b>]<b> And I in you</b> must not be taken as a<i> promise</i> (<i> “Abide in me, and then I will abide in you”</i>), which (see on ver. 2 above) would be contrary to the sense: but as a clause dependent on the former, ‘Take care that ye abide in Me and I in you:’<i> both these</i> being necessary to the bringing forth fruit: see ver. 5, where the two are similarly bound together.
