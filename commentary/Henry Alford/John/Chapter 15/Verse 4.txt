<b> 4.</b>]<b> And I in you</b> must not be taken as a<i> promise</i> (<i> “Abide in me, and then I will abide in you”</i>), which (see on ver. 2 above) would be contrary to the sense: but as a clause dependent on the former, ‘Take care that ye abide in Me and I in you:’<i> both these</i> being necessary to the bringing forth fruit: see ver. 5, where the two are similarly bound together.<br><br> Here the natural strictness of the similitude is departed from. The branch cannot sever itself from the vine: but,<i> such a case supposed</i>, every one will see the inevitable consequence. Bengel says well, “This passage plainly shews the difference between what takes place in nature and what takes place in grace.” It is<i> the permitted free-will of the creature</i> which makes the difference between the branches in the two cases.
