	Here the natural strictness of the similitude is departed from. The branch cannot sever itself from the vine: but,  such a case supposed , every one will see the inevitable consequence. Bengel says well, “Hic locus egregie declarat discrimen naturæ et gratiæ.” It is  the permitted freewill of the creature which makes the difference between the branches in the two cases.
