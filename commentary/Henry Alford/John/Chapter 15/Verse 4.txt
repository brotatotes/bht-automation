<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] <strong> κἀγὼ</strong> ἐν ὑμ . must not (with Euthym [207] , Meyer, and Lücke) be taken as a <em> promise</em> , which (see on ἐν ἐμοί above) would be contrary to the sense: but (with Aug [208] , Tholuck, Bengel, Stier, who however modifies it by rendering “ <em> so</em> abide in Me that I may abide in you”) as a clause dependent on μείνατε ἐν ἐμοί , ‘Take care that ye abide in Me and I in you:’ <em> both these</em> being necessary to the bringing forth fruit: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:5">John 15:5</span> , where the two are similarly bound together.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [208] <em> Augustine, Bp. of Hippo</em> , 395 430
	</p>
<p>Here the natural strictness of the similitude is departed from. The branch cannot sever itself from the vine: but, <em> such a case supposed</em> , every one will see the inevitable consequence. Bengel says well, “Hic locus egregie declarat discrimen naturæ et gratiæ.” It is <em> the permitted freewill of the creature</em> which makes the difference between the branches in the two cases.</p>
