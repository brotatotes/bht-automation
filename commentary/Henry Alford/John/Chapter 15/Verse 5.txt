<b> 5.</b>] The interpretation of the allegory which each mind was forming for itself, the Lord solemnly asserts for them. Notice the term<b> the</b><b> same</b>—he and no other: “it is he, that beareth much fruit.”<br><br> The separation indicated in the last clause of the verse is more than ‘<i>without Me,’</i> the words are best rendered<b> apart</b>, or<b> separate from Me</b>, from being in Me and I in you. The word<b> because</b> has respect rather to the sense, than to the words themselves:<i> because</i> union with Me is the sole efficient cause of fruit being produced, you having no power to do any thing, to bring any thing to perfection, to do any of those things which belong to that which ye are, separate from Me.
