<b> 6.</b>] This verse is a most important testimony against supra-lapsarian error, shewing us that<i> falling from grace is possible,</i> and pointing out the steps of the fall. Observe this is<i> not said of the unfruitful branch,</i> which the Father<i> takes</i><i> away</i> (in judgment): but of one<i> who will</i><i> not abide</i> in Christ, becomes separate from Him: (1) he is<i> cast out</i> (of the vineyard, or of the Vine) like a branch in such a case: (2) he becomes<i> dried up</i>, having lost the supply of life-giving sap ( ‘quenched the Spirit,’ 1 Thess. v. 19): (3) he is gathered up with other such (Matt. xiii. 40) by the angels at the great day: (4) is cast into the fire, as the result of that judgment; and finally (5) ‘burneth;’ not, ‘is burned,’ in any sense of being<i> consumed; “and must burn,”</i> as Luther renders it.
