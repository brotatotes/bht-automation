 9. ] The Love between the Father and Christ is compared with that between Christ and His disciples. The sense is best served by placing a colon (as in E. V.) after ὑμᾶς ἠγάπησα , making μείνατε κ . τ . λ . a separate injunction, and κἀγώ = οὕτως . With only a comma at ἠγάπησα , that which is the great assertion of the sentence, is suffered to slip by unnoticed; viz. that ‘as the Father hath loved the Son, so the Son His disciples.’
	 τῇ ἀγ  .   τῇ ἐμῇ may be rendered  the love of Me , as in Luke 22:19 [211] 1 Cor., but the sense is not good, and the expression is not parallel with τῇ ἀγ . μου in John 15:10 ; so that I prefer  my love, the love which I have towards you; remain in it: do not cast yourselves out of it. The other sense is  implied in this, but not expressed.
	 [211] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
