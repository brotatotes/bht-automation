<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] The Love between the Father and Christ is compared with that between Christ and His disciples. The sense is best served by placing a colon (as in E. V.) after ὑμᾶς ἠγάπησα , making μείνατε κ . τ . λ . a separate injunction, and κἀγώ = οὕτως . With only a comma at ἠγάπησα , that which is the great assertion of the sentence, is suffered to slip by unnoticed; viz. that ‘as the Father hath loved the Son, so the Son His disciples.’

<p><strong> τῇ ἀγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῇ ἐμῇ</strong> may be rendered <em> the love of Me</em> , as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span> [211] 1 Cor., but the sense is not good, and the expression is not parallel with τῇ ἀγ . μου in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:10">John 15:10</span> ; so that I prefer <strong> my love,</strong> the love which I have towards you; remain in it: do not cast yourselves out of it. The other sense is <em> implied</em> in this, but not expressed.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [211] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
