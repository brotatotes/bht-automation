<b> 9.</b>] The Love between the Father and Christ is compared with that between Christ and His disciples. ‘As the Father hath loved the Son, sothe Son His disciples.’<br><br> The words<b> my love</b> may be understood as meaning<i> the love of Me</i>;—but the sense is not good, and the expression is not parallel with the same expression in ver. 10; so that I prefer<b> my love</b>,<i> the love which I have towards you</i>; remain in it; do not cast yourselves out of it. The other sense is<i> implied</i> in this, but not expressed.
