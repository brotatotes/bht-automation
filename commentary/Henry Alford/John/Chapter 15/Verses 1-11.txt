<p><strong> 1 11.</strong> ] <em> Their relation to Him</em> . Various suggestive circumstances have been imagined, but none of them are satisfactory. The vineyards on the way to Gethsemane (Lampe), the carved vine on the great doors of the temple (Rosenmüller, Bibl. Exeget. Repert. i. 166 (Lücke), see Jos. B. J. ver. 5. 4: Antt. xv. 11. 3); a vine trained about the window of the guest-chamber (Knapp, Lücke conj., Tholuck, 6), are all fanciful, and the two first (see on ch. Joh 14:31 ) inapplicable. The <em> cup</em> , so lately partaken (Meyer, Stier), is certainly nearer, see below. But I believe with Lücke that most probably the Lord did not take the similitude from any outward suggesting occasion, but as a means of illustrating the great subject, <em> the inner unity of Himself and His</em> . Occasion enough was furnished, by the O.T. symbolism of the vineyard and the vine, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:1">Isaiah 5:1</span> ff.: <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:21">Jeremiah 2:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+19:10">Ezekiel 19:10</span> ff., and especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+80:8-19">Psalms 80:8-19</span> ; by the intimate analogy of vegetable life (of which the tree bearing fruit is the highest kind, and of such trees the vine the noblest) with spiritual, and perhaps also by the γέννημα τῆς ἀμπ . having been so recently the subject of their attention and the Lord’s prophecy, Luk 22:18 [206] .
