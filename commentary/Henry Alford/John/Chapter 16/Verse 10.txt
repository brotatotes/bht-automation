<b> 10.</b>] The<b> righteousness</b> here spoken of cannot be<i> only</i> the righteousness<i> of Christ</i>, the mere conviction of which would only bring condemnation to that world which rejected and crucified Him: but as Stier remarks rightly, the conviction of the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment must be concerning a sin that is<i> theirs</i>, a righteousness that is (or, in the case of condemnation<i> might have been</i>)<i> theirs</i>, a judgment which is<i> theirs</i> (see below). Then<i> what</i><i><b> is</b> the world’s righteousness</i>? Not their own, but that of the accepted Man Christ Jesus standing at the right hand of God (seen by us no more, but by that very withdrawal testified to be the Son of God, THE RIGHTEOUS ONE), manifested in the hearts of men by the Spirit to be<i> their only</i> righteousness;—and thereby that righteousness, which they had of their own before, is demonstrated to be worthless, and as filthy rags. It is<i> His going to the Father</i> by which this righteousness is assured to us, and by the effect of which, the Spirit, the conviction respecting it is wrought in our hearts. The<i> condemnatory</i> side of this part of the Spirit’s work of conviction is,—that<i> remorse</i>, wherewith they whose day of grace is past shall look on the perfect righteousness which might have been theirs, and on the miserable substitute with which they contented themselves.
