<b> 11.</b>] As the<b> righteousness</b> spoken of was<i> the world’s righteousness</i>, and the convicting them of it was the manifesting to them how worthless it (their righteousness after its old conception) was of their own by nature, but how perfect and complete it (the same as now newly and more worthily apprehended) is in and by Christ,—so now the<b> judgment</b> spoken of is<i> the world’s judgment</i>:—<i>on the one side, their judgment</i> or estimate, or discrimination of things,—on the other side, God’s<i> judgment</i>, to which it is opposed. This their judgment by nature they form in subjection to the prince of this world, the Devil, of whose power they are not conscious, and whose existence they even deny: but the Spirit of God shall convict this judgment of wrong;—shall shew them how erroneous and destructive it is, and what a bondage they have been under;—shall detect to them the Prince of this world reigning in the children of disobedience, and give them<i> a better judgment</i>, by which they shall ‘not be ignorant of his devices’ (2 Cor. ii. 11). But this better judgment itself is that very truth ot God manifested in the Lord Jesus, by which (ch. xii. 31)<i> the Prince of this world is cast out</i>;—by which the follower of Christ is enabled to say, ‘Get thee behind me, Satan;’ by which the unbelieving world, and its Prince, are finally condemned in<i> the judgment</i> hereafter.
