<b> 11.</b>] As the<b> righteousness</b> spoken of was<i> the world’s righteousness</i>, and the convicting them of it was the manifesting to them how worthless it (their righteousness after its old conception) was of their own by nature, but how perfect and complete it (the same as now newly and more worthily apprehended) is in and by Christ,—so now the<b> judgment</b> spoken of is<i> the world’s judgment</i>:—<i>on the one side, their judgment</i> or estimate, or discrimination of things,—on the other side, God’s<i> judgment</i>, to which it is opposed. This their judgment by nature they form in subjection to the prince of this world, the Devil, of whose power they are not conscious, and whose existence they even deny: but the Spirit of God shall convict this judgment of wrong;—shall shew them how erroneous and destructive it is, and what a bondage they have been under;—shall detect to them the Prince of this world reigning in the children of disobedience, and give them<i> a better judgment</i>, by which they shall ‘not be ignorant of his devices’ (2 Cor. ii. 11). But this better judgment itself is that very truth ot God manifested in the Lord Jesus, by which (ch. xii. 31)<i> the Prince of this world is cast out</i>;—by which the follower of Christ is enabled to say, ‘Get thee behind me, Satan;’ by which the unbelieving world, and its Prince, are finally condemned in<i> the judgment</i> hereafter.<br><br> I have preferred giving pointedly what I believe to be the sense of this most important passage, to stringing together a multitude of opinions on it: seeing that of even the best Commentators no two bring out exactly the same shade of meaning, and thus classification is next to impossible, It will be seen that in my view the<i> subjective</i> (internal, acting in and on the mind of its<i> subject</i>) and<i> objective</i> (external, viewed from without, belonging to the<i> object</i> regarded, not to him who regards it) bearing of the three words are<i> both</i> to be kept in sight, and that the great convictive work of the Spirit is to bring man OUT OF HIMSELF INTO CHRIST, Who (in His objective manifestation) must be<i> made unto him</i> (subjectively), 1.<i> redemption</i>, 2.<i> righteousness</i>, 3.<i> wisdom</i> (the fourth,<i> sanctification</i>, not being here treated of, as being another part of the Spirit’s work, and on those who are no longer “<i>the world</i>,” see ch. xvii. 16, 17); and to condemn those who remain in the world finally, in all these points, as having rejected Christ. And this convictive work of the Spirit is a<i> complex</i> and<i> progressive</i> work; including the ministry of the Apostles, and every step taken towards divine truth in the history of the Church, as well as the conversion of individuals, and condemnation of the unbelieving.
