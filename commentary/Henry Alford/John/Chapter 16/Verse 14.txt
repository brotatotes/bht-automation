<b> 14.</b>] This is in connexion with ver. 12—and sets forth that the<i> Spirit guiding into</i> truth is in fact<i> the</i><br><br><i> Son declaring</i> the truth, for He shall shew forth the glory of Christ, by revealing the matters of Christ,—the riches of the Father’s love in him (ver. 15).<br><br> This verse is decisive against all additions and pretended revelations subsequent to and besides Christ; it being the work of the Spirit to testify to and declare THE THINGS OF CHRIST; not any thing new and beyond Him. And this declaration is coincident with inward advance in the likeness and image of Christ (2 Cor. iii. 17, 18), not with a mere external development.
