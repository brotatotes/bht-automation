<b> 16.</b>] The mode of expression is (purposely) enigmatical;—the<b> beholding</b>: and<b> seeing</b> not being co-ordinate;—the first referring merely to physical, the second also to spiritual sight. So before, ch. xiv. 19, where see note. It is important to observe the distinction between the two verbs, which the A.V. has obliterated by rendering both “<i>see</i>.” The “<i>beholding</i>” implies the long, constant, usual sight of Him which they then had in the flesh: the “<i>seeing</i>” the glimpses obtained by occasional appearances and visions, and the dimmer and more interrupted spiritual sight gained by faith.<br><br> The promise of seeing Him after a little while,<i> began to be fulfilled</i> at the Resurrection;—then received its<i> main fulfilment</i> at the day of Pentecost;—and shall have its<i> final completion</i> at the great return of the Lord hereafter. Remember again, that in all these prophecies we have a perspective of continually-unfolding fulfilments presented to us: see note on ch. xiv. 3.
