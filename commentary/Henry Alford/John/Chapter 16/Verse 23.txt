<b> 23.</b>]<b> that day</b>, in its full meaning, cannot import<i> the forty days</i>: for, Acts i. 6, they did then<i> ask</i> the Lord<i> questions</i>—nor this present dispensation of the Spirit, during which we have only the firstfruits, but not the full understanding so as not to need to ask any thing; (for is not<i> prayer itself</i> an<i> asking</i>?)—but that great completion of the Christian’s hope, when he shall be with his Lord, when all doubt shall be resolved, and prayer shall be turned into praise. The Resurrection-visiting, and the Pentecost-visiting of them, were but foretastes of this. Stier well remarks, ‘The connexion of the latter part of this verse is,—the way to<b> asking nothing</b> any more, is to ask and to pray the more diligently, till that day comes.’
