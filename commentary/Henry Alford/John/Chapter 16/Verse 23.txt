<b> 23.</b>]<b> that day</b>, in its full meaning, cannot import<i> the forty days</i>: for, Acts i. 6, they did then<i> ask</i> the Lord<i> questions</i>—nor this present dispensation of the Spirit, during which we have only the firstfruits, but not the full understanding so as not to need to ask any thing; (for is not<i> prayer itself</i> an<i> asking</i>?)—but that great completion of the Christian’s hope, when he shall be with his Lord, when all doubt shall be resolved, and prayer shall be turned into praise. The Resurrection-visiting, and the Pentecost-visiting of them, were but foretastes of this. Stier well remarks, ‘The connexion of the latter part of this verse is,—the way to<b> asking nothing</b> any more, is to ask and to pray the more diligently, till that day comes.’<br><br> It has been supposed wrongly that the words<b> me</b> and<b> the Father</b> are in opposition in this verse, and thence gathered that it is not lawful to address prayer to Christ. But such an opposition is contrary to the whole spirit of these discourses,—and<i> asking the Father in Christ’s name</i>, is in fact<i> asking</i> HIM.<br><br> In the latter clause, notice the right reading,<b> He will give it you in my name</b>, He being the<i> element</i>, the<i> region</i>, of all communication between God and the Church. Compare Rom. i. 8, where<i> thanks</i> are offered<b> through Jesus Christ</b>.
