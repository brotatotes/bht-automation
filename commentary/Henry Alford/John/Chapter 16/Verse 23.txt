<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] <strong> ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> in its full meaning, cannot import <em> the forty days:</em> for, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:6">Acts 1:6</span> , they did then <em> ask</em> the Lord <em> questions</em> (the sense of ἐρωτᾶν , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:19">John 16:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:30">John 16:30</span> , not <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:26">John 16:26</span> , where the construction is different); nor this present dispensation of the Spirit, during which we have only the first-fruits, but not the full understanding so as not to need to ask any thing: (for is not <em> prayer itself</em> an <em> asking?</em> ) but that great completion of the Christian’s hope, when he shall be with his Lord, when all doubt shall be resolved, and prayer shall be turned into praise. The Resurrection-visiting and the Pentecost-visiting of them, were but foretastes of this. Stier well remarks, “The connexion of the latter part of this verse is, The way to οὐδὲν ἐρωτᾶν any more, is to ask and to pray the more diligently, till that day comes.”

<p>It has been supposed wrongly that ἐμέ and τὸν πατέρα are in opposition in this verse, and thence gathered (Origen de Orat. § 15, vol. i. p. 222, λέγεται (alli [225] . λείπεται ) τοίνυν προσεύχεσθαι μόνῳ τῷ θεῷ τῷ τῶν ὅλων πατρί · ἀλλὰ μὴ χωρὶς τοῦ ἀρχιερέως , κ . τ . λ .) that it is not lawful to address prayer to Christ. But such an opposition is contrary to the whole spirit of these discourses, and <em> asking the Father in Christ’s name</em> , is in fact <em> asking</em> HIM.

<p>In the latter clause, notice the right reading: <strong> He shall give it you in my name,</strong> He being, as Luthardt expresses it, the <em> element</em> , the <em> region</em> , of all communication between God and the Church. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8">Romans 1:8</span> , where <em> thanks</em> are offered διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ .</p>
