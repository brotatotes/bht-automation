<b> 25.</b>] The word used here signifies<i> literally</i>, as rendered in A.V.,<i> a proverb</i>: but it is better for the English reader to render it<b> parable</b>, because<i> proverb</i> has the technical appropriated sense of a short pithy saying of concentrated wisdom, whereas this implies generally something dark and enigmatical—deep truth wrapped up in words, as in a parable.<br><br> This is true of the whole discourse—and of the discourses of the Lord in general, as they must then have seemed to them, before the Holy Spirit furnished the key to their meaning.<br><br><b> the hour cometh</b>] viz. the same as that indicated in vv. 16 and 23;—but here again, not one<i> hour</i> only exclusive of all others, but to be understood of the several steps of spiritual knowledge.<br><br> Olshansen finely remarks, that all human language is a parable, or dark saying, only able to hint at, not to express fully, the things of God; and that the Lord contrasts the use of this weak and insufficient medium, with the inward teaching of the Holy Spirit. This inward teaching, because it is a real imparting of the divine Nature and Life, brings with it not only<i> prayer in the name of Jesus</i>, but a<i> free access to the Father Himself</i>. This<i> speaking plainly</i> however, he continues, is described here by the Lord in its ideal perfection (as it will hereafter be): and is only approximated to on earth; for, as long as the<i> old man</i> yet lives in us, we require still the Lord’s intercessory prayer (ch. xvii. 15), daily washing from the pollution of the world; by which Intercession alone the faithful man, notwithstanding his imperfection, can enjoy in peace the grace of God vouchsafed to him.
