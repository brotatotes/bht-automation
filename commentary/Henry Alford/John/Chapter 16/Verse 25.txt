 25. ]  παροιμία  , properly, a  proverb: but implying generally in Scriptural and oriental usage something dark and enigmatical: see especially Sir 6:35 ; Sir 8:8 ; Sir 39:3 ; Sir 47:17 ; “in dictis tectioribus,” Bengel.
	This is true of the whole discourse and of the discourses of the Lord in general, as they must then have seemed to them, before the Holy Spirit furnished the key to their meaning.
	 ἔρχεται ὥρα  , viz. the same as that indicated in John 16:16 ; John 16:23 ; but here again, not one ὥρα only exclusive of all others, but to be understood of the several steps of spiritual knowledge.
	Olshausen finely remarks, that all human language is a παροιμία , only able to hint at, not to express fully, the things of God; and that the Lord contrasts the use of this weak and insufficient medium, with the inward teaching of the Holy Spirit. This inward teaching, because it is a real imparting of the divine Nature and Life, brings with it not only  prayer in the name of Jesus , but a  free access to the Father  Himself . This παῤῥησίᾳ λαλεῖν however, he continues, is spoken of here by the Lord in its ideal perfection (as it will hereafter be): and is only approximated to on earth; for, as long as the  old man yet lives in us, we require still the Lord’s intercessory prayer (ch. Joh 17:15 ), daily washing from the pollution of the world; by which Intercession alone the faithful man notwithstanding his imperfection can enjoy in peace the grace of God vouchsafed to him.
