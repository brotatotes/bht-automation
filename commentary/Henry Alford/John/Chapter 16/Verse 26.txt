<b> 26.</b>] ‘The more knowledge, the more prayer in the name of Jesus,’ Lücke. ‘Knowledge begets prayer,’ Bengel. The approaching the Father through Him shall be a characteristic of their higher state under the dispensation of the Spirit<br><br><b> I say not unto you....</b>] This has been variously understood. Grotius’s rendering, “I pass by this, as a lesser thing than that which Tam about to mention,” comes I believe the nearest to the truth, though it does not express the whole meaning. The Lord is now describing the fulness of their state of communion with Himself and the Father by the Spirit. He is setting in the strongest light their reconciliation and access to the Father. He therefore says,<b> Ye shall ask the Father in My name: and I do not now say to you</b>,—I do not now state it in this form,—as if there were no relation of love and mercy<i> between the Father and yourselves</i>:— (<b>27</b>)<b> for the Father</b><i> Himself</i> (i. e. of His own accord)<b> loveth you</b>; why?<b> Because ye love and believe on Me</b>.<br><br> The whole mind of the Father towards mankind is<i> Love</i>: both in Redemption itself (ch. iii. 16),—and then in an especial manner by drawing those who come to Christ (vi. 44),—and again by this fuller manifestation of His love to those who believe on and love Christ. The aim of this saying is, to shew them that His intercession (which is still going on under the dispensation of the Spirit, 1 John ii. 1) does not imply their<i> exclusion from access</i> to the Father, but rather<i> ensures that access</i>, by the especial love which the Father bears to them who believe in and love His Son: CHRIST being still the efficient cause of the Father’s love to them, and the channel of that Love. No stress must be laid (Lücke) on<i> ye</i><b> have loved</b> here coming before<i> ye</i><b> have believed</b>, as to Faith coming after Love: probably “<i>ye have loved</i>” is placed first as corresponding to the word “<i>loveth</i>” just before:—and it might be said with just as much reason that the Faith contains the ground of the Love, as the converse.
