Cf. Æsch. Agam. 507 9. Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. p. 35. If we are to seek any contrast, it will be between the οὐκ ἔγνωσαν of the world, and the μνημονεύητε of the Church. The one know not what they are doing: the other know well what they are suffering.

<p><strong> ἐγώ</strong> before εἶπον is emphatic, ‘ <strong> I</strong> MYSELF:’ <strong> that it was I</strong> MYSELF <strong> who told you.</strong> A difficulty has been found in the latter part of the verse, because our Lord had repeatedly announced to them future persecutions, and that at least as plainly as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16">Matthew 10:16</span> ; Mat 10:21-28 alli [222] . freq. And hence, De Wette, Meyer, and Lücke, and even Olsh., find ground for supposing that the chronological order of the discourses has not been followed in the Synoptic Gospels. But there is in reality no inconsistency, and therefore no need for such a supposition. This declaration, <em> as here meant</em> , was <em> not made before</em> , because He was with them. Then clearly it <em> is now made</em> , in reference to His immediate departure. And if so, to what will <strong> ταῦτα</strong> most naturally refer? To <em> that full and complete account</em> of the world’s motives, and their own office, and their comfort under it, which He has been giving them. This He had <em> never before done</em> so plainly, though occasional mention has been made even of the help of the Spirit under such trials, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:19-20">Matthew 10:19-20</span> .

<p>In <strong> ἤμην</strong> we have the proleptical character of the discourse again manifest.</p>
