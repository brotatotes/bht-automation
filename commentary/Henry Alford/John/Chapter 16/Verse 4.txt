<b> 4.</b>]<b> Nevertheless</b> here indicates no contrast, but only breaking off the mournful details, and passing back to the subject of ver. 1. If we are to seek any contrast, it will be between the “<i>non-knowledge</i>” of the world, and the “<i>remembering</i>” of the church. The one know not what they are doing: the other know well what they are suffering.<br><br><b> their hour</b>] i.e. the time of their happening.<br><br> The “<b>I</b>” before<b> told you of them</b> is emphatic, ‘I MYSELF:’—<b>that it was I</b> MYSELF<b> who told you</b>. A difficulty has been found in the latter part of the verse, because our Lord had repeatedly announced to them future persecutions, and that at least as plainly as here, Matt. v. 10; x. 16, 21–28, and elsewhere. And hence some Commentators find ground for supposing that the chronological order of the discourses has not been followed in the three first Gospels. But there is in reality no inconsistency, and therefore no need for such a supposition. This declaration,<i> as here meant</i>, was<i> not made before</i>, because He was with them. Then clearly it<i> is now made</i>, in reference to His immediate departure. And if so, to what will<b> these</b><b> things</b> most naturally refer? To<i> that full and complete account</i> of the world’s motives, and their own office, and their comfort under it, which He has been giving them. This He had<i> never before done</i> so plainly, though occasional mention has been made even of the help of the Spirit under such trials; see Matt. x. 19, 20.<br><br><b> because I was with you</b>] While the Lord was<i> with them</i> (compare Matt. ix. 15), the malice of the world was mainly directed against<i> Him</i>,—and they were overlooked: see ch. xviii. 8.<br><br> In this past tense,<b> I was</b>, we have the anticipatory character of the discourse again manifest. The Lord looks upon His earthly course as ended.
