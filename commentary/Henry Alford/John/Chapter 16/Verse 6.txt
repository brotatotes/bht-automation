 6.   ἡ λύπη πεπλ  .   ὑμ  .   τ  .   κ  . ] ‘Your grief (or abstract, ‘grief’) has filled, entirely occupied, your heart (not τὰς κ ., but singular, as common to all, see Rom 1:21 ), to the exclusion of any regard of my object in leaving you.’ “These are the same disciples who afterwards when their risen Lord had ascended to heaven, without any pang at parting with Him, returned with great joy to Jerusalem, Luk 24:52 ” (Stier). “Subest huic blandæ increpationi tacita consolatio. Dum enim improbat, quod quæstionem, quo vaderet, negligant, sibi id optime perspectum esse docet. Dum negligentiæ incusat, ad excusationem tamen affert, quod ea ex tam vehementi affectu tristitiæ oriunda sit.” Lampe.
