<b> 8. will convict</b>] It is difficult to give in one word the deep meaning of the original term:<i> ‘convince</i>’ approaches perhaps near to it, but does not express the double sense, which is manifestly here intended—of a<i> convincing</i> unto salvation, and a<i> convicting</i> unto condemnation:— ‘<i>reprove’</i> is far too weak, conveying merely the idea of an outward rebuke, whereas this reaches into the heart, and works inwardly in both the above-mentioned ways. See the whole question amply discussed in Archdeacon Hare’s “Mission of the Comforter,” vol. ii. note K.<br><br> Lücke’s comment is valuable: ‘The testimony of the Holy Ghost in behalf of Christ as opposed to the unbelieving world (ch. xv. 26) is essentially a<i> refutation</i>, a demonstration of its wrong and error. All the apostolic preaching, as addressed to the world, takes necessarily this polemical form (1 Tim. v. 20; 2 Tim. iv. 2; iii. 16; Titus i. 9, 13; ii. 15). And the more difficult was the disciples’ conflict, against the power of this world with only the Word for their weapon, the more comfort was it for them, that the power of God the Spirit working by this<i> refutation</i> was their help. In Matt. x. 19, 20; Luke xii. 11, 12, the apologetic side of their conflict, which was in close connexion with the polemical, is brought into view. In the word here used is always implied the refutation, the overcoming of an error, a wrong,—by the truth and the right. And when, by means of the “<i>refutation</i>” the truth detects the error, and the right the wrong, so that a man becomes conscious of them,—then arises the feeling of<i> guilt</i>, which is ever painful. Thus every such “<i>refutation</i>” is a chastening, a punishment. And hence this office has been called the<i> punitive</i> office of the Spirit. The<i> effect</i> of the “<i>refutation</i>” carried on by the divine Spirit in the world may be<i> to harden</i>: but its<i> aim</i> is the<i> deliverance</i> of the world. This term<b> the world</b>, in John, includes those who are not yet delivered (from the power of Satan to God) who<i> may be yet delivered</i>,—not the condemned. If the “<i>refutation</i>” of the world is a moral process, its result may just as well be conversion, as non-conversion.<i> Only thus</i> did the refutation carried on by the Spirit answer the end of Christ’s coming;—only thus could it be a cheering support to the Apostles. Certainly, the<b> judgment</b> with which it closes is<i> condemnation</i>, not however of the<i> world</i>, but of the<i> Prince of the world</i>.’<br><br> De Wette denies the<i> salutary</i> side of this convicting process—but he is certainly wrong: see below. These three words,<b> sin, righteousness, judgment</b>, comprehend the three great steps of advance in spiritual truth among men. Of itself the world does not know what<i> Sin</i> is, what<i> Righteousness</i> is, what<i> Judgment</i> is. Nor can either of these be revealed to any man, except by the Spirit of God working within him. Each man’s conscience has some glimmering of light on each of these;<i> some</i> consciousness of guilt,<i> some</i> sense of right,<i> some</i> power of judgment of what is transitory and worthless: but all these are unreal and unpractical, till the convicting work of the Spirit has wrought in him.
