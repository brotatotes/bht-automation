 9. ] And the great opening of  Sin to the world is to shew them that its root and essence is,  unbelief in Christ as the Son of God . UNBELIEF: for, mankind being alien from God by nature, the first step towards their recovery must be to lay hold on that only safety which He has provided for them; and that laying hold is  faith , and the not doing it, when revealed and placed before them, is  sin . Beforetime, it was also  unbelief; “The fool hath said in his heart, There is  no God: ” but now, for we can only believe as God has revealed Himself, it is unbelief in  Christ the Son of God , the οὐ  θέλετε ἔρχεσθαι πρός με : see this pointedly asserted 1 John 5:10-12 . Remember, this unbelief is not a mere want of historical faith, but unbelief  in its very root , the want of a personal and living recognition of Jesus as the Lord ( 1Co 12:3 ), which, wherever the Spirit has “opened His commission” by the planting of the visible Church, is  the condemning sin of the world. Of this He shall  convince those who are brought out of the world, and ultimately  convict those who remain in it and die in their sins (see Hare, Mission of the Comforter, vol. ii. note Q).
