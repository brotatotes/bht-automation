<b> 9.</b>] And the great opening of<i> Sin</i> to the world is to shew them that its root and essence is,<i> unbelief in Christ as the Son of God</i>. UNBELIEF:—for, mankind being alien from God by nature, the first step towards their recovery must be to lay hold on that only safety which He has provided for them; and that laying hold is<i> faith</i>, and the not doing it, when revealed and placed before them, is<i> sin</i>. Beforetime, it was also<i> unbelief</i>;—’ The fool hath said in his heart, there is<i> no God</i>:’—but now,—for we can only believe as God has revealed Himself,—it is unbelief in<i> Christ the Son of God</i>,—the<i> having no desire to come to Him</i>: see this pointedly asserted 1 John v. 10–12. Remember, this unbelief is not a mere want of historical faith,—but unbelief<i> in its very root</i>,—the want of a personal and living recognition of Jesus as the Lord (1 Cor. xii. 3), which, wherever the Spirit has ‘opened His commission’ by the planting of the visible Church, is<i> the condemning sin</i> of the world. Of this He shall<i> convince</i> those who are brought out of the world, and ultimately<i> convict</i> those who remain in it and die in their sins (see Hare, “Mission of the Comforter,” vol. ii. note Q).
