<b> 1.</b>]<b> These words</b>, the foregoing discourse.<br><br> St. John very seldom depicts the gestures or looks of our Lord, as here. But this was an occasion ot which the impression was indelible, and the upward look could not be passed over.<br><br><b> to heaven</b>] Nothing hereby is determined as to the locality. The guest-chamber no doubt was the place of this prayer. The eyes may be lifted to heaven in doors, as well as out-of-doors;<i> heaven</i> is not the<i> sky</i>, but that upper region, above our own being and thoughts, where we all agree in believing God to be especially present; and which we indicate when we direct our eyes or our hands upward. The Lord, being in all such things like as we are, lifted up His eyes to heaven when addressing the Father (not His<i> hands</i>, for He prays not here as a suppliant—but as an intercessor and a High Priest, standing between earth and heaven, see ver. 24, where he says,<b> I will, that.....</b>).<br><br> It is impossible to regard the following prayer otherwise than as the<i> very words of our Lord Himself,</i>—<i>faithfully rendered by the beloved Apostle in the power of the Holy Spirit</i>.<br><br><b> Father</b>] not,<i> Our</i> Father,—which He never could say,—nor,<i> My</i> Father,—which would be too great a separation between Himself and His for such a prayer (see Matt. xxv. [39,] 42, where He prays for Himself only)—but simply FATHER; that Great Name in which all the mystery of Redemption is summed up.<br><br><b> the hour is come</b>] See ch, xii. 23, 28; xiii. 31, 32. The Glorification is—the exaltation by Death and Resurrection: He prays in the Manhood, and for the exaltation of the Manhood, but in virtue of His Godhead, ver. 5.<br><br><b> thy Son</b>] He prays first as<i> concerning</i> Himself, in the third person, to set the great matter forth in all its majesty; then<i> from</i> Himself, in the first person, ver. 5, putting<i> Himself</i> into the place of “<i>thy Son</i>” here.<br><br><b> that thy Son also may glorify thee</b>] “These words are a proof that the Son is equal to the Father as touching His Godhead. What creature could stand before his Creator and say, ‘Glorify Thou me, that I may glorify Thee?’” Stier.<br><br> This glorifying of the Father by the Son is, the whole great result of the glorification of the Son by the Father,—the manifestation of God to and in men by the Son through the Spirit.
