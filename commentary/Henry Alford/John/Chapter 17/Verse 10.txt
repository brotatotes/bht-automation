<b> 10.</b>] Compare ch. xvi. 15 and note. “It were not so much if He had only said, ‘All Mine is Thine;’ for that we may all say, that all we have is God’s. But this is a far greater thing, that He inverts this and says, ‘All Thine is Mine.’ This can no<i> creature</i> say before God.” Luther.<br><br> The A.V.,— ‘All Mine<i> are</i> Thine,’&c.—gives the erroneous impression that<i> persons</i> only are meant, whereas it is<i> all things</i>, in the widest meaning,—<i>the Godhead itself</i><i> included</i>,—of which this is asserted.<br><br><b> I am glorified in them</b>] not ‘<i>by their means</i>,’<b> but in them</b>; by that “<i>I in them</i>” of ver. 23, the life of the vine in the branches; so that the fruit of the branches is the glory of the vine, by the sap of the vine living in the branches. All this again is anticipatory.
