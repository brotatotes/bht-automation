<b> 11.</b>] The<i> occasion</i>, and<i> substance</i> of His prayer for them.<br><br><b> I am no more in the world</b>] This shews us that “<i>the world</i>” is not said of<i> place</i> alone, for the Lord Jesus is still<i> here</i>; but of state, the<i> state of men in the flesh</i>; sometimes viewed on its darker side, as overcoming men and bringing in spiritual death,—sometimes, as here, used in the most general sense.<br><br><b> and these are..</b>] not<i> but</i>; it expresses the simultaneous state of the Lord and His, see ch. xvi. 32, and note.<br><br><b> Holy Father</b>]<i> Holy</i>, as applied to God, peculiarly expresses that<i> penetration of all His attributes by LOVE</i>, which He only who here uttered it sees through in its length, breadth, and height:—which angels (Isa. vi. 3; Rev. iv. 8) feel and express:—which men are privileged to utter, but can never worthily feel:—but which devils can neither feel nor worthily utter (see Mark i. 24). They know His Power and His Justice only. But His Holiness is especially employed in this work of<i> keeping in His name</i> now spoken of.<br><br><b> in thy name</b>] not<i> ‘through</i> Thine own Name,’ as A.V., which yet renders the same expression ‘<i>in</i> Thy Name’ ver. 12—but<b> in the</b> NAME of verses 6 and 12; see below.<br><br><b> thy name, which thou hast given me</b>] Not only the best supported, but the<i> best</i> reading.<br><br> The<i> Name</i> of God is that which was to be<i> in the Angel of the Covenant</i>, Exod. xxiii. 21, see also Isa. ix. 6; Jer. xxiii. 6.<br><br> This Name,—not the essential Godhead, but the covenant name, JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS,—the Father hath<i> given to Christ</i>, see Phil. ii. 9; and it is the being kept in this, the truth and confession of this, for which He here prays. ‘That which the Son has given to His disciples is no other than that which He himself has received from the Father, viz. the essential revelation of the Father.’ Luthardt. Compare Matt. x. 27.<br><br><b> that they may be one, even as we are</b>] The oneness here is not merely harmony of will or of love,—as some have interpreted it, and then tried to weaken the Oneness of the Godhead,—but oneness by the indwelling of the Spirit of Christ, the gift of the Covenant (1 Cor. vi. 17), and ultimately (as the close union implied by<b> even as</b> requires) oneness of nature, 2 Pet. i. 4, where the expression “<i>whereby are</i><b> given</b><i> unto us exceeding great and precious promises</i>” answers to the words “<i>thy name which thou hast given me</i>” here. The Lord does not say, “that they may be<i> one with</i><i> us</i>,” nor, “that<i> they and we</i> may be one,” but “<i>that they may be one as we are.</i>” Augustine.
