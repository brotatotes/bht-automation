 17. ]  ἁγιάζειν here and in Joh 17:19 carries the meaning, which unites the two uses, of  consecration to God . (1) In  them , this setting apart for Him was a long and gradual process, to be accomplished by conflicts, and the deeper sinking in of the Truth by the blows of affliction, and the purifying fire of the Spirit: in  them it was strictly  sanctification , the  making holy: but (2) in HIM it was that pure and entire self-consecration by His submission to the Father’s holy will, the entire possession of His sinless humanity with the living and speaking Truth of God, which should be at the same time the efficient cause of their sanctification and their Pattern. Such an High Priest  became us (see Heb 7:26 ), who are to be ourselves priests unto God. Revelation 20:6 .
	 ἐν  , not ‘by,’ but in: see on John 17:11 . The truth is the  element in which the ἁγ . takes place.
	 ὁ λόγ  .   ὁ σός ] Compare Acts 20:32 . Thy word, in its inner subjective power.
	Joh 17:18 is proleptic, and received its fulfilment ch. John 20:21 . He does not merely  leave them in the world, but  sends them into it, to witness to this same truth of God: see ch. John 15:16 .
