 19. ] See above on John 17:17 . Notice, says Meyer, the emphatic correlation of  αὐτῶν    ἐγὼ ἐμαυτόν    καὶ αὐτοί  .
	It is clear against all Socinian inferences from this verse, that all that part of ἁγιάζειν implied in ch. Joh 10:36 is here excluded: and only that intended which is expressed Heb 2:10 by διὰ παθημάτων τελειῶσαι . Of this, His death was the crowning act, and was also the one to which the ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν most directly applies; but the whole is included. The confining the meaning to  His sacrifice (Chrys., Euthym [236] ), and the ἵνα καὶ αὐτοὶ .… to  their martyrdom , or their spiritual  self-offering , Romans 12:1 (Euthym [237] ), is insufficient for the depth of the words.

	 ἐν ἀληθ  . ]  in truth:  what truth, is evident from John 17:17 , where, in the repetition, ὁ λόγ . ὁ σὸς ἀλήθειά ἐστιν , the article is also wanting: see also ch. John 1:14 ; John 4:24 : 3 John 1:3 , for ἀλήθ , without the article. But the distinction is perhaps somewhat obscured after a preposition.
