<b> 19.</b>] See above on ver. 17. It is clear against all Socinian inferences from this verse, that all that part of the sanctification of the Son of God implied in ch. x. 36 is here excluded: and only that intended, which is expressed Heb. ii. 10 by<i> making perfect through sufferings</i>. Of this, His Death was the crowning act, and was also the one to which the expression<b> for their sakes</b> most directly applies; but the whole is included. The confining the meaning to<i> His sacrifice</i>, and the purpose stated,<b> that they also</b>... to<i> their</i><i> martyrdom</i>, or their spiritual<i> self-offering</i>, Rom. xii. 1, is insufficient for the depth of the words.<br><br><b> sanctified in truth</b>:<i> what</i> truth, is evident from ver. 17, viz. Godâ€™s word and will, which is Truth, and<i> the</i> Truth.
