<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] “The causal connexion expressed by <strong> καθώς</strong> is this, that the glorification, the <em> end</em> , must correspond to the <em> beginning</em> , to the sending, the preparation, and office of the Son.” (Lücke.) We must also bear in mind that the ‘giving of power’ in this verse is the <em> ground</em> , as well as the <em> type</em> , of the glorification, see Rom 1:28 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:6">1 Corinthians 1:6</span> ; so Stier (v. 383, edn. 2).

<p><strong> πᾶσα σάρξ</strong> is not only ‘all mankind,’ but (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+7:15-16">Genesis 7:15-16</span> ; Gen 7:21 ) <em> all that has life</em> , all that is subject to death, all that is cursed on account of sin. But of this all, <em> mankind</em> is the head and crown, and in the <em> full</em> blessings of the Lordship of Christ mankind only can participate. πᾶσα σάρξ is given by the Father from before the foundation of the world to Christ; the <em> whole creation</em> is His to rule, His to judge, by virtue of His being, in the root of that human nature, to which sovereignty over the world was given, THE SECOND AND RIGHTEOUS ADAM.

And to them, and them only, He imparts the further and ineffable gift consequent on union with Him their God in the Spirit, viz. ETERNAL LIFE (compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26-27">John 5:26-27</span> ; also Joh 6:37 ).</p>
