But of this all,<i> mankind</i> is the head and crown, and in the<i> full</i> blessings of the Lordship of Christ mankind only can participate.<i> All flesh</i> is given by the Father, from before the foundation of the world, to Christ; the<i> whole creation</i> is His to rule, His to judge, by virtue of His being, in the root of that human nature, to which sovereignty over the world was given, THE SECOND AND RIGHTEOUS ADAM.<br><br> But in this wide gift, there is a<i> more</i><i> special gift</i>,—<b>whatsoever thou hast given</b> him in the stricter sense,—<i>the chosen</i>, they who believe on Him. And to them, and them only, He imparts the further and ineffable gift consequent on union with Him their God in the Spirit,—viz. ETERNAL LIFE (compare ch. v. 26, 27; also vi. 37).
