<b> 21.</b>] The word that here hardly can regard the<i> subject-matter</i> of the prayer, ver. 20, but rather we should understand it as expressing the<i> object of the prayer</i> respecting both. The<i> subject-matter</i> of the prayer is, that they may be kept in God’s name and sanctified in God’s truth; and if this be so, their unity with the Son and the Father follows, 1 John i. 3. But here it is not merely ‘with,’ but in, the Son and the Father;—because the Spirit proceeds from<i> the Father and the Son</i>, and ‘He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit:’ see ver. 11. This unity has its true and only<i> ground</i> in faith in Christ through the Word of God as delivered by the Apostles; and is therefore not mere outward uniformity, nor can such uniformity produce it. At the same time its effects are to be real and visible, such that the world may see them.
