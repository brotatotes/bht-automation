<b> 21.</b>] The word that here hardly can regard the<i> subject-matter</i> of the prayer, ver. 20, but rather we should understand it as expressing the<i> object of the prayer</i> respecting both. The<i> subject-matter</i> of the prayer is, that they may be kept in God’s name and sanctified in God’s truth; and if this be so, their unity with the Son and the Father follows, 1 John i. 3. But here it is not merely ‘with,’ but in, the Son and the Father;—because the Spirit proceeds from<i> the Father and the Son</i>, and ‘He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit:’ see ver. 11. This unity has its true and only<i> ground</i> in faith in Christ through the Word of God as delivered by the Apostles; and is therefore not mere outward uniformity, nor can such uniformity produce it. At the same time its effects are to be real and visible, such that the world may see them.<br><br><b> that the world may believe</b>] This clause is not<i> parallel</i> with the former, as if<i> the world believing</i> meant the same as<i> they all being one</i>, that all may be brought to believe. Nor again can the words mean that the<i> unbelieving and condemned world, at the end</i>, may be persuaded ‘that Thou hast sent Me.’ Such a rendering would surely be repugnant to the spirit of the prayer, and to the use of the word<b> believe</b> in our Gospel. Rather is it,— ‘that this their testimony, being borne by them all, and in all ages, may continue to convince the world, so that many in the world may believe,’&c.<br><br> The “<i>believing</i><b> that thou didst send me</b>” implies belief in the whole Work and Office of Christ. Here our Lord certainly<i> prays</i><i> for the world</i>,—see above on ver. 9.<br><br> See a remarkable parallel, Rev. iii. 9, where, as Stier truly remarks, the persons spoken of are<i> penitents</i>.<br><br> We have the same recurrences of<b> that</b> as in ver. 21, and the same dependence. The second of them here expresses not merely the similarity of their unity to that of the Son and Father,—but the<i> actuality of its subsistence</i>, in Christ abiding in them and the Father in Christ.<br><br> “<i>That the world may</i><b> know</b>” here, parallel as it is to “<i>that the world may</i><b> believe</b>” above, cannot be interpreted of a bare recognition, or of a recognition at the final judgment,—but must be taken to mean that salutary knowledge by which from time to time the children of the world are by God called to become the children of light. See the same words, and note, ch. xiv. 31, also ch. xiii. 35, and observe that in all three places the recognition is that of<i> love</i>;—in ch. xiii, 35, of the disciples one to another; in ch. xiv. 31, of Jesus to the Father; here, of the Father to believers, as perfected into unity in the Son of His love.<br><br> “Observe,” says Meyer, “how the glance of the Intercessor reaches in these verses even to the highest aim of His work on earth, when the<i> world</i> shall be believing, and Christ Himself actually the Saviour<i> of the</i><i> world</i>, ch. iv. 42, cf. ch. x. 16.”
