Grotius and others interpret this<b> glory</b> to mean,<i> the power of working miracles</i>, and refer to ch. ii. 11 and ch. xi. 40; but wrongly:—for if so, in the words<b> I have given them</b> our Lord must refer to<i> the Apostles only</i>, whereas it is distinctly referred to the believers<i> of all time</i>. The<b> glory</b> is<i> the glory of Christ as the only-begotten Son</i> (ch. i. 14), full of grace and truth (see ver. 5 and note), which by virtue of His exaltation and the unity of all believers in Him through the Spirit, has become (not,<i> shall be</i>) theirs, Eph. ii. 6; Rom. viii. 30; Eph. i. 18; not yet fully, nor<i> as it is His</i>. but as each can receive and shew it forth. The perfection of it is spoken of, ver. 24.<br><br> We have the same recurrences of<b> that</b> as in ver. 21, and the same dependence. The second of them here expresses not merely the similarity of their unity to that of the Son and Father,—but the<i> actuality of its subsistence</i>, in Christ abiding in them and the Father in Christ.
