 “<i>That the world may</i><b> know</b>” here, parallel as it is to “<i>that the world may</i><b> believe</b>” above, cannot be interpreted of a bare recognition, or of a recognition at the final judgment,—but must be taken to mean that salutary knowledge by which from time to time the children of the world are by God called to become the children of light. See the same words, and note, ch. xiv. 31, also ch. xiii. 35, and observe that in all three places the recognition is that of<i> love</i>;—in ch. xiii, 35, of the disciples one to another; in ch. xiv. 31, of Jesus to the Father; here, of the Father to believers, as perfected into unity in the Son of His love.<br><br> “Observe,” says Meyer, “how the glance of the Intercessor reaches in these verses even to the highest aim of His work on earth, when the<i> world</i> shall be believing, and Christ Himself actually the Saviour<i> of the</i><i> world</i>, ch. iv. 42, cf. ch. x. 16.”
