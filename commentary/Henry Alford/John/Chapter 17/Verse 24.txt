 24.   ὅ δέδωκάς μοι ] The neuter has a peculiar solemnity, uniting the whole Church together as  one gift of the Father to the Son: see ch. John 6:39 , note. Then the κἀκεῖνοι resolves it into the great multitude whom no man can number, and comes home to the heart of every individual believer with inexpressibly sweet assurance of an eternity with Christ.
	 θέλω is not the θέλω of ch. John 12:21 : 1 Corinthians 7:7 , but more like that of Mark 6:25 , an expression of will founded on acknowledged right: compare διατίθεμαι , Luke 22:29 .
	Compare also the θέλω and ὃ δέδωκ . μοι , with ch. John 5:21 ; John 6:44 .
	 ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγώ ] i.e. in the glorified state: see ch. Joh 12:26 and note: also ch. John 14:3 .
	 ἵνα θεωρ  . ] This is the completion of John 17:22 , the open beholding of His glory, spoken of 1 John 3:2 , which shall be coincident with our being changed into His perfect image.
	 θεωρ  . is to  behold and  partake the very case supposes it. No  mere spectator could behold this glory. See Rom 8:17 end, and 2 Corinthians 3:18 .
	 ὅτι ἠγ  .   με  .… ] The most glorious part of this sight of glory will be to behold the whole mystery of redemption unfolded in the glory of Christ’s Person, and to see how, before the being of the creature, that eternal Love was, which gave the glory to Christ of which all creation is but the exponent.
