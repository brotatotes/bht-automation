The epithet<b> righteous</b>, here applied to the Father, is connected with the final clause of ver. 24. The Righteousness of the Father is witnessed by the beginning of Redemption before the foundation of the world, and by the glorification of the elect from Christ; but also by the fact of<i> the world’s not knowing the Father</i>,—the final distinction made by His Justice between the world and His.
