The<b> making known</b>, here spoken of, is carried on by the whole work and testimony of the Spirit completed in the Kingdom of God. This promise has been in fulfilment through all the history of the Church. And the great result of this manifestation of the Father’s Name is, that the wonderful Love wherewith He loved Christ, may dwell in (not the Apostles merely—the future tense,<b> I will make it known</b>, has again thrown the meaning onward to the great body of believers) them,—i. e. the perfect, living knowledge of God in Christ, which reveals, and in fact is, this love. And this can only be by<b> I in them</b>—by Christ dwelling in their hearts by faith, and renewing and enlightening them by His Spirit. He does not say, ‘<i>Thou</i> in them’—but “<b>I in them</b>,” and ‘<i>Thou in Me</i>:’ see ver. 23.
