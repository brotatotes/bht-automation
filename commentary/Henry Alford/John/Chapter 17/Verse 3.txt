<b> 3.</b>] See a similar definition of a term just used, in ch, iii. 19.<br><br><b> this</b> IS<b> life eternal</b>, not<i> is the way to it</i>. The knowledge spoken of is no mere head or heart knowledge,—the mere information of the mind, or excitation of the feelings,—but that living reality of knowledge and personal realization,—that oneness in will with God, and partaking of His nature, which IS itself life eternal:—the knowledge, love, enjoyment, of Him who is infinite, being themselves infinite. “The beginning of life is the result of the participation of God: and participation of God is the knowing God and enjoying His goodness.” Irenæus. The Latin Fathers, Augustine, Ambrose, and Hilary, anxious to avoid the inference unwarrantably drawn by some from this verse against the Godhead of Christ, tried to arrange it thus: “<i>that they might know Thee, and Jesus Christ whom Thou didst send</i>, (to be)<i> the only true God</i>.” But this treatment of the original is inadmissible. Others, as Chrysostom and Euthymius, construing rightly, yet regarded Jesus Christ as included in the words “<i>the only true God</i>.” But all such violences to the text are unnecessary. For, first, the very juxtaposition of Jesus Christ here with the Father, and the<i> knowledge of both</i> being defined to be eternal life, is a proof, by implication, of the Godhead of the former. The knowledge of<i> God and a creature</i> could not be eternal life, and the juxtaposition of the two would be inconceivable. Secondly, the words<b> whom Thou didst</b><b> send</b> most distinctly express the<i> coming forth</i> from God, ver. 8—imply the<i> unity</i> expressed in ver. 22, and cannot, in connexion with what follows, possibly be understood in a Socinian, or an Arian sense. I do not scruple to use and preach on the verse as a plain proof of the co-equality of the Lord Jesus in the Godhead.<br><br> A difficulty has been found in the use of the name JESUS CHRIST<i> by the Lord Himself</i>:—and inferences have been hence made that we have<i> St. John’s own language</i> here:—but surely without any ground. He who said “<i>Thy Son</i>,” ver. 1, might well here, before the change to the first person in ver. 4, use that prophetic Name JESUS, which had been divinely given Him as the Saviour of men, and its weighty adjunct CHRIST, in which Names are all the hidden treasures of that knowledge of which He here speaks. And as to the later use of the two names together having led to their insertion here by the Apostle,—what if<i> the converse were the case</i>, and this solemn use of them by our Lord had given occasion to their subsequent use by the Church? This is to me much more probable than the other.<br><br><b> the work which thou gavest me to do</b> is not only the ministerial life of our Lord, but the<i> whole</i> Life, with all its appointed manifestations of humility and purity;—the perfect righteousness which by that life He has planted in our nature,—and His prophetic and declarative office, terminated by His Passion and Death.
