 5.   δόξασόν με ] Notice the correlation, which Meyer has pointed out, between  ἐγώ σε before and  με σύ now. The same Person ( ἐγώ ) who had with the Father glory before the world, also glorified the Father in the world, and prays to be again received into that glory.  A decisive proof of the unity of the Person of Christ , in His three estates of eternal præ-existence in glory, humiliation in the flesh, and glorification in the Resurrection Body.
	This direct testimony to the eternal præ-existence of the Son of God has been evaded by the Socinian and also the Arminian interpreters, by rendering  εἶχον  , “habebam  destinatione tua ,” Grot., Wets [232] . On the identity of the δόξα in Joh 17:22 with this δόξα , see note there.
