 6. ] This verse particularizes John 17:4 , and forms the transition to the intercessory prayer.
	 σου τὸ ὄνομα ] Thy Name of FATHER, which was so constantly on the lips of our Lord; and which derived its living meaning and power from His teaching: see Exodus 23:21 . No especial emphasis on σου : it carries on the strain of address, and points to the emphatic  σοί which follows, and the equally emphatic  παρὰ σοῦ in John 17:7  .
	 οὓς δέδ  . ] The Father gave them to Christ, by  leading them to Christ, see ch. John 6:37 ; John 6:44-45 .
	 σοὶ ἦσαν ]  Thine (  σοί  , from σός )  they were  Israelites  Thy people, before: not only outwardly, but Israelites indeed, see ch. John 1:48 , and thus prepared to receive Christ (so Stier, v. 411 ff., edn. 2). And thus the  ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου answers to λαβεῖν ἑαυτῷ ἔθνος ἐκ μέσου ἔθνους , Deuteronomy 4:34 . But see the fuller sense below, on John 17:9 .
	 τὸν λ  .   σου τετήρηκαν ]  They have observed Thy word walked in the path of Thy commandments; for so λόγον τηρεῖν means: see ch. Joh 14:23 and reff.
	Stier understands their walking in the O.T. ordinances blameless, as Luke 1:6 , and thus (compare ch. John 1:42 ; Joh 1:46 ) recognizing Christ as the Messiah when He came. But this is perhaps hardly likely to have been set at the  end of the sentence,  after ἐμοὶ αὐτοὺς δέδωκας . It is more likely that τὸν λόγον σου = τὰ ῥήματα ἃ δέδωκάς μοι , John 17:8 , and is proleptically spoken.
