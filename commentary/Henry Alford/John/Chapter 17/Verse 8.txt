	 τὰ ῥ  .…   δέδ  .   αὐτοῖς  , and the similar sayings ch. Joh 15:15 alli [233] ., seem to be a reference to Deuteronomy 18:18-19 , where it is said that the Prophet “shall speak unto them all that I shall command Him.” The imparting to them of these ῥήματα was the efficient cause of their faith: see their confession ch. John 6:68-69 , where πεπιστεύκαμεν and ἐγνώκαμεν are connected as here.

	On the two last clauses we may notice that  παρὰ σοῦ ἐξῆλθον is more a matter of  conviction from inference (see ch. Joh 3:2 ),  ἔγνωσαν  : whereas the other side of the same truth,  σύ με ἀπέστειλας  , the act of the Father unseen by us, is more a matter of  pure faith ,  ἐπίστευσαν  . In the first, the ἔγνωσαν  ἀληθῶς stamps our Lord’s approval on  their knowledge, and distinguishes it from such knowledge as the bare οἴδαμεν [ch. Joh 3:2 ] of Nicodemus and his colleagues.
