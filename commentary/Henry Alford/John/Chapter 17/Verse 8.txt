<b> 8.</b>]<b> I have given unto them the words...</b>, and the similar sayings ch. xv. 15 al., seem to be a reference to Deut. xviii. 18, 19, where it is said that the Prophet ‘shall speak unto them all that I shall command Him.’ The imparting to them of these “<i>words</i>” was the efficient cause of their faith:—see their confession ch. vi. 68, 69, where “<i>we have believed and know</i>” are connected as here.<br><br> On the two last clauses we may notice, that our Lord’s<b> coming forth from the Father</b> is with them more a matter of<i> conviction from inference</i>, and is therefore connected with<b> they knew</b> (see eh. iii. 2):—whereas the other side of the same<b> truth, thou didst send me</b>, the act of the Father unseen by us, is more a matter of<i> pure faith</i>,—and is therefore connected with<b> they believed</b>. In the first, the expression<b> knew surely</b> (<b>truly</b>) stamps our Lord’s approval on<b> their</b> knowledge, and distinguishes it from such knowledge as the bare assumption of knowing (John iii. 2) by Nicodemus and his colleagues.
