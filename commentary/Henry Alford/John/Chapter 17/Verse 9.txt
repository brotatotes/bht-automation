<b> 9.</b>] Stier remarks, that the Lord<i> here begins to fulfil His promise</i> Matt. x. 32.<br><br><b> I pray not for the world</b>] The misconceptions which have been made of this verse, as implying a decree of exclusion for the vessels of wrath, may be at once removed by considering the usage of the term<b> the world</b> in this Prayer. The Lord<i> does pray</i> distinctly for<i> the world</i>, vv. 21, 23, that they may believe and know that the Father hath sent Him. He cannot therefore mean here that He does not pray (absolutely) for the world, but that He is not<i> now</i> asking for the world, does not pray<i> this thing</i> for the world.<i> These</i> “<i>whom Thou gavest me” have already</i> believed and known; the prayer for them is therefore a different one, viz. that in vv. 11, 15. The mistake would be at once precluded for English readers by the paraphrase,<b> I am praying for them; I am praying not for the world....</b><br><br><b> for they are thine</b>] in a fuller sense than “<i>they were Thine</i>,’ ver. 6. That was their<i> preparation</i> for Christ; this is their<i> abiding in</i> Him, which is abiding in the Father, see next verse.
