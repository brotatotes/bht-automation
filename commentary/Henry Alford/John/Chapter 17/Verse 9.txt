 9. ] Stier remarks, that the Lord  here begins to fulfil His promise Matthew 10:32 .
	 οὐ περὶ τ. κόσμου ἐρ. ] The misconceptions which have been made of this verse (Calvin, Lampe, and even Luther, who elsewhere corrects himself, see Tholuck on John, edn. 6, p. 352) as implying a decree of exclusion for the vessels of wrath, may be at once removed by considering the usage of  ὁ κόσμος in this Prayer. The Lord  does pray distinctly for ὁ κόσμος , John 17:21 ; John 17:23 , that they may believe and know that the Father hath sent Him. He cannot therefore mean here that He does not pray (absolutely) for the world, but that He is not  now asking for the world, does not pray  this thing for the world.  These ( οὓς δέδωκάς μοι )  have already believed and known; the prayer for them is therefore a different one, viz. that in John 17:11 ; John 17:15 . The mistake would be at once precluded for English readers by the paraphrase,  I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world.
	 ὅτι σοί εἰσιν in a fuller sense than σοὶ ἦσαν , John 17:6 . That was their  preparation for Christ; this is their  abiding in Him, which is abiding in the Father, see next verse.
