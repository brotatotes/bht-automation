 22, 23. ] Grotius and others interpret this  δόξα  , “potestas faciendi miracula,” and refer to ch. Joh 2:11 and ch. John 11:40 ; but wrongly: for if so, the αὐτοῖς must mean the Apostles only, whereas it is distinctly referred to the believers  of all time . The δόξα is (Lücke, De Wette, Stier: Meyer understands it of the heavenly glory, Rom 8:17 )  the glory of Christ as the only-begotten Son (ch. Joh 1:14 ), full of grace and truth (see Joh 17:5 and note), which by virtue of His exaltation and the unity of all believers in Him through the Spirit, has become (not,  shall be ) theirs, Ephesians 1:18 ; Ephesians 2:6 ; Romans 8:30 ; not yet fully, nor  as it is His , but as each can receive and shew it forth. The perfection of it is spoken of, John 17:24 .
	We have the same recurrences of ἵνα as in John 17:21 , and the same dependence (see var. readd.). The second of them here expresses not merely the similarity of their unity to that of the Son and Father, but the  actuality of its subsistence , in Christ abiding in them and the Father in Christ.

	 γινώσκῃ here, parallel as it is to  πιστεύσῃ above, cannot be interpreted of a bare recognition, or of a recognition at the final judgment, but must be taken to mean that salutary knowledge by which from time to time the children of the world are by God called to become the children of light. See the same words, and note, ch. John 14:31 , also ch. John 13:35 , and observe that in all three places the recognition is that of  love; in ch. John 13:35 , of the disciples one to another; in ch. John 14:31 , of Jesus to the Father; here, of the Father to believers, as perfected into unity in the Son of His love.
	“Observe,” says Meyer, “how the glance of the Intercessor reaches in these verses even to the highest aim of His work on earth, when the  world shall be believing, and Christ Himself actually the Saviour  of the world , ch. John 4:42 , cf. ch. John 10:16 .”
