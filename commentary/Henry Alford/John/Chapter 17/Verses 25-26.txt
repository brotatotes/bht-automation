 25, 26. ]  δίκαιε is connected with the final clause of John 17:24 . The Righteousness of the Father is witnessed by the beginning ( πρὸ κατ . κόσ .) of Redemption, and ( κἀκεῖνοι ὦσιν ) by the glorification of the elect from Christ; but also by ὁ κόσμος σε οὐκ ἔγνω , the final distinction made by His justice between the world and His.
	The first  καί is in the quasi-disjunctive usage so common with our Evangelist, see ch. John 16:32 , note, and contrasts with the  δέ immediately following: the more classical construction would be τε δέ (Lücke). The second  καί merely couples the preceding to the following, as depending upon it: see Matthew 11:27 .
	This  ἔγνω  ,   ἔγνωσαν  ,   ἐγνώρισα  ,   γνωρίσω  , shew that our Lord spoke here of the then present time and disciples again, at the close of His prayer.
	The  γνωρίσω is by the whole work and testimony of the Spirit completed in the Kingdom of God. This promise has been in fulfilment through all the history of the Church. And the great result of this manifestation of the Father’s name is, that the wonderful Love wherewith He loved Christ, may dwell in (not the Apostles merely the future γνωρίσω has again thrown the meaning onward to the great body of believers) them, i.e. the perfect, living knowledge of God in Christ, which reveals, and in fact is, this love. And this can only be by κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτοῖς Christ dwelling in their hearts by faith, and renewing and enlightening them by His Spirit. He does not say, ‘  Thou in them’ but  I in them and Thou in Me: see John 17:23 .
