<b> 1. the brook Cedron</b>] The name given to this brook in the oldest text,<b> of the cedars</b>, seems to furnish an instance of the common practice of changing foreign, or unmeaning names, into other words bearing sense in the new language: the Hebrew word Ce-or Ke-dron signifying “<i>of cedars</i>” in Greek.<br><br> The ravine in the bottom of which flows the Kidron, is to the East of Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives.<br><br><b> a garden</b>] Lücke suggests that the owner of this garden may have been friendly to (or a disciple of?) Jesus. It was called Gethsemane,—Matthew, Mark.<br><br> Traditions as to its site are, as usual, various. A square plot of ground in the depth of the ravine is now usually pointed out, and seems to have been fixed on at the time when the empress Helena visited Jerusalem, A.D. 326. Eusebius says Gethsemane was<i> at</i> the Mount of Olives: Jerome,<i> at the foot of</i> the mount. The language of Luke xxi. 37 leads to a belief that it may have been higher up the mount.
