Luthardt remarks: “He before whose aspect, and ἐγώ εἰμι , the whole band had been terrified and cast to the ground, now suffers himself to be taken, bound, and led away. This contrast the Evangelist has in mind here. To apprehend and bind ONE, all gave their help: the cohort, the chiliarch, and the Jewish officers. This the Evangelist brings prominently forward, to shew how deep the impression of that previous incident still was: only  by the help of all did they feel themselves secure. And thus it was ordered, that the disciples might escape with the more safety.”
