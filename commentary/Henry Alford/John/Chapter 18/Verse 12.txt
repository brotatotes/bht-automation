<b> 12.</b>] The<b> officers of the Jews</b> were those sent by the Sanhedrim. Luthardt remarks: “He before whose aspect, and whose declaration,<b> I am he</b>, the whole band had been terrified and cast to the ground, now suffers himself to be taken, bound, and led away. This contrast the Evangelist has in mind here. To apprehend and bind ONE, all gave their help: the cohort, the captain, and the Jewish officers. This the Evanpelt brings prominently forward, to shew how deep the impression of that previous incident still was: only<i> by the help of all</i> did they feel themselves secure. And thus it was ordered, that the disciples might escape with the more safety.”
