<b> 13.</b>] On Annas, see note Luke iii. 2. The influence of Annas appears to have been very great, and Acts iv. 6, he is called<i> the High Priest</i>, in the year following this. The narrative evidently rests upon some arrangement with regard to the High Priesthood now unknown to us, but accountable enough by foreign influence and the deterioration of the priestly class through bribes and intrigues, to which Josephus and the Talmud sufficiently testify. This<i> hearing</i> is entirely distinct from that in the other Gospels.<i> There</i>, no questions are asked of Jesus about His disciples or doetrine (ver. 19):<i> there</i>, winesses are produced, and the whole proceedings are after a legal form. That hearing was in a public court of justice, before the assembled Sanhedrim; this was a private and informal questioning. That Annas should be so often called ‘the High Priest,’ is no objection to this view: see on Luke as above: see also note on ver. 24. The<i> two</i> hearings are maintained to be<i> one and the same</i> by many, among whom are Grotius, Bengel, Tholuck, &c.:—the view here taken is maintained by Chrysostom, Augustine, Olshausen, Neander, and others.
