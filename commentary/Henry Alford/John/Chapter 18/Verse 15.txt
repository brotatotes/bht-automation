<b> 15.</b>]<b> the other disciple</b> is here mentioned for the first time. There is no reason to doubt the universal persuasion that by this name John intends<i> himself</i>, and refers to the mention in ch. xiii. 23 of a disciple whom Jesus loved. The idea that it was<i> Judas Iscariot</i>, is surely too absurd to need confutation. The details mentioned concerning him, that he<i> followed Jesus</i>, that he was known to the High Priest (as a matter of individual notice), and the whole character of the incident, will prevent any real student of St. Johnâ€™s style and manner from entertaining such a supposition for a moment.<i> How</i> John was<i> known to the High Priest</i>, we have no means of forming a conjecture.<br><br> The palace of the High Priest was probably the dwelling of both Annas and Caiaphas.
