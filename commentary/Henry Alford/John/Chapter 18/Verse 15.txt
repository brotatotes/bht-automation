<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] [ <strong> ὁ</strong> ] <strong> ἄλλος μαθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is here mentioned for the first time. There is no reason to doubt the universal persuasion that by this name John intends <em> himself</em> , and refers to the mention in ch. Joh 13:23 of a disciple whom Jesus loved. The idea that it was <em> Judas Iscariot</em> (Heumann), is surely too absurd to need confutation. The [ ὁ ] ἄλλος , συνεις . τῷ Ἰησ ., ἦν γνωστὸς τῷ ἀρχ . (as a matter of individual notice), and the whole character of the incident, will prevent any real student of St. John’s style and manner from entertaining such a supposition for a moment. How John was <em> known to the High Priest</em> we have no means of forming a conjecture.

<p>The palace of the High Priest was probably the dwelling of both Annas and Caiaphas.</p>
