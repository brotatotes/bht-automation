 15. ] [  ὁ ]  ἄλλος μαθ  . is here mentioned for the first time. There is no reason to doubt the universal persuasion that by this name John intends  himself , and refers to the mention in ch. Joh 13:23 of a disciple whom Jesus loved. The idea that it was  Judas Iscariot (Heumann), is surely too absurd to need confutation. The [ ὁ ] ἄλλος , συνεις . τῷ Ἰησ ., ἦν γνωστὸς τῷ ἀρχ . (as a matter of individual notice), and the whole character of the incident, will prevent any real student of St. John’s style and manner from entertaining such a supposition for a moment. How John was  known to the High Priest we have no means of forming a conjecture.
	The palace of the High Priest was probably the dwelling of both Annas and Caiaphas.
