<b> 17.</b>] See the whole subject of Peter’s denials discussed in notes on Matt. vv. 69–75.<br><br> This first denial was to all appearance rashly and almost inadvertently made, from a mere feeling of shame. Lücke suggests that Peter may have set himself among the servants of the High Priest<i> to bear out his denial</i>. The question, “<i>Art thou</i><b> also</b><i> one of this man’s disciples?</i>” (ver. 25,) as Luthardt remarks, implies that the other disciple had already been recognized as a follower of Jesus, and had escaped annoyance.
