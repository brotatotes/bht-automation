<b> 24.</b>] From what has been above said, it will be seen that I cannot acquiesce in the<i> pluperfect</i> rendering of this word<b> sent</b>, to bring about which the opening particle,<b> So</b>, has apparently been omitted by the copyists. I believe the verse simply to describe what followed on the preceding—<b>So Annas</b> (or<b> Annas therefore</b>)<b> sent Him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest</b>. “Then,” says Chrysostom, “not being able even thus to make progress in their decision, they send Him bound to Caiaphas.” There is no real difficulty in this rendering, if Annas and Caiaphas lived in one palace, or at all events transacted public affairs in one and the same. They would naturally have different apartments, and thus the sending from one to the other would be very possible; as also would the incident related by Luke xxii. 61:—see the extract from Robinson, Matt. xxvi. 69, note. “The Evangelist had no need to relate the hearing before Caiaphas, for he has related ch. xi. 47 ff.: and we have ere this been familiarized with the habit of our Evangelist not to narrate any further the outward process, where he has already by anticipation substantially given us its result.” Luthardt.<br><br> Peter was in the court-yard of the house.
