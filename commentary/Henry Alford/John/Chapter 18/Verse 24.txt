<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] From what has been above said, it will be seen that I cannot acquiesce in the <em> pluperfect</em> rendering of ἀπέστειλεν , to bring about which the <strong> οὖν</strong> has apparently been omitted. I believe the verse simply to describe what followed on the preceding: <strong> Annas therefore sent Him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest.</strong> εἶτα , μηδὲ οὕτως εὑρίσκοντές τι πλέον , πέμπουσιν αὐτὸν δεδεμένον πρὸς Καϊάφαν , Chrys. There is no real difficulty in this rendering, if Annas and Caiaphas lived in one palace, or at all events transacted public affairs in one and the same. They would naturally have different apartments, and thus the sending from one to the other would be very possible; as also would the incident related by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61">Luke 22:61</span> ; see the extract from Robinson, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:69">Matthew 26:69</span> , note. “The Evangelist had no need to relate the hearing before Caiaphas, for he has related ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:47">John 11:47</span> ff.: and we have ere this been familiarized with the habit of our Evangelist not to narrate any further the outward process, where he has already by anticipation substantially given us its result.” Luthardt.</p>
