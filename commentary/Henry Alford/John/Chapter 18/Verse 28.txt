<b> 28. they themselves went not into the palace</b> (literally,<b> the Prætorium</b>)] I have already di ed the difficulties attending the subject of our Lord’s last Passover, in the note on Matt. xxvi. 17–19. I will add here some remarks of Friedlieb’s. “The Jews would not enter the Prætorium that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover. For the entrance of a Jew into the house of a Gentile made him unclean till the evening. It is surprising, that according to this declaration of the Holy Evangelists, the Jews<i> had yet to eat the Passover</i>, whereas Jesus and His disciples had already eaten it in the previous night. And it is no less surprising, that the Jews in the early morning should have been afraid of rendering themselves unclean for the Passover,—since the Passover could not be kept till<i> evening</i>, i.e.<i> on the next day</i>, and the uncleanness which they dreaded did not, by the law, last till the next day. For this reason, the passage in John labours under no small exegetic difficulties, which we cannot altogether solve, from want of accurate knowledge of the customs of the time. Possibly the law concerning Levitical defilements and purifications had in that age been made more stringent or otherwise modified; possibly, they called some other meal, besides the actual Passover, by its name. This last we certainly, with our present knowledge of Hebrew antiquities, must assume: for the law respecting uncleanness will not allow us to interpret this passage of the<i> proper</i> Passover on the evening of the 14th of Nisan, nor indeed of any<i> evening meal</i> at all.”
