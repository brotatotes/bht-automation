 3. ] See, on this band of men, note on Matthew 26:47 . Lücke refers to Dion. Hal. ix. ( ἐξέτρεχον ἅπαντες ἐκ τῶν σκηνῶν ἀθρόοι , φανοὺς ἔχοντες κ . λαμπάδας ) to shew that lanterns and torches were part of the utensils of military on a night march.
	 φανοί appear to be strictly  torches, any blazing substance held in the hand; and  λαμπάδες  , lights, fed with oil.
	The weapons were swords and staves, Matt., Mark. The fact of its being full moon did not make the lights unnecessary, as, in searching for a prisoner, they might have to enter dark places.
