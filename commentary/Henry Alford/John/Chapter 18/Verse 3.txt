<b> 3.</b>] See, on this band of men, the note on Matthew ver. 47. Lanterns and torches were part of the utensils of military on a night march.<br><br> The latter of these appear to be strictly<b> torches</b>,—some blazing substance held in the hand;—and the former,<b> lights</b>, fed with oil.<br><br> The weapons were<i> swords</i> and<i> staves</i>,—Matthew, Mark. The fact of its being full moon did not make the lights unnecessary, as, in searching for a prisoner, they might have to enter dark places.
