<b> 31.</b>] This answer is best regarded as an ironical reproach founded on their apparently proud assertion in ver. 30—and amounting to this: ‘If you suppose I am to have such implicit confidence in your judgment concerning this prisoner as to take his guilt on your word, take him and put him to death (for so “<b>judge ye Him</b>” must be understood,—see below) according to your law;’ reminding them that the same Roman power which had reserved capital cases for his jurisdiction, also expected proper cognizance to be taken of them, and not that he should be the mere executioner of the Sanhedrim.<br><br><b> It is not lawful for us to put any man to death</b>] From the time when Archelaus was deposed (A. D. 6 or 7), and Judæa became a Roman province, it would follow by the Roman law that the Jews lost the power of life and death. Josephus tells us, that it was not lawful to hold a court of judgment in capital cases, without the consent of the Procurator. Some have thought that this power was reserved to them in religions matters, as of blasphemy and sacrilege; but no proof has been adduced of this; the passages commonly alleged in Josephus, and Acts vii. 58, not applying (see note on Acts). The Talmud relates that this had taken place forty years (or more) before the destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br> Biscoe, on the Acts, argues at great length that the Jews had this power; and that the words here merely mean that they could not put to death<i> on the Sabbath</i>, which, according to the usual custom of executing the next day after judgment, would now have been the case. But this treatment of the words is unjustifiable. Can we suppose for a moment that this can have been meant, when there is not a word in the text to imply it? We may hope that the day for such forced interpretations is fast passing away.<br><br> Friedlieb gives the most consistent account of the matter. In the Roman provinces generally, the Proprætor or Proconsul conducted judicial proceedings. But Judæa, which belonged to the province of Syria, was an exception. There was there a Procurator with full powers, who exercised the right of judicial cognizance. Jerusalem however possessed the privilege of judging all lighter causes before the<i> three-and-twenty</i>, and heavier causes, with the sole exception of capital trials, before the great Sanhedrim: so that none but these reserved cases remained for the Procurator. Pilate seems to have judged these cases at his visits during the festivals; which would fall conveniently for the purpose, it being the custom in Jerusalem, to execute great criminals at the Feasts In other provinces the governors made circuits and held assizes throughout their jurisdictions.
