<b> 33.</b>] This question probably arose out of what Pilate had previously heard, not from any charge to this effect being made between our vv. 31 and 34. Had such a charge been made, our Lord’s question ver. 34 would be unnatural.<br><br> Pilate summoned Jesus in, who had been as yet outside with the Jews. This was the formal<i> reception</i> of the case before him;—the Roman soldiers must now have formally taken charge of Jesus, as servants of the Roman authorities: having previously, when granted by Pilate to the Chief Priests. acted as<i> their</i> police.<br><br> The judgments of the Romans were always public and in the open air, see ch. xix. 13;—but the enquiries and examinations might be private. In this case Pilate appears to have wished to obtain an account from Jesus apart from the clamours of the chief priests and the mob.
