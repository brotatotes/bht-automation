 34. ] On this whole interview, see note on Luke 23:3-4 .
	I regard this question  ἀπὸ σεαυτ  . κ . τ . λ . as intended to distinguish the senses of the word  King as applied to Jesus: and of course not (De Wette, Lücke) for the information of Him who asked it, but to bring out this distinction in Pilate’s mind. If he asked  of himself , the word could certainly have but one meaning, and that one would be wrongly applied; if from information derived from the Jews, this very fact would open the way to the true meaning in which He was King of the Jews. Stier and Ebrard think there may be some reference in ἀπὸ σεαυτοῦ to a momentary earnestness in Pilate’s own mind, a suspicion that his prisoner  was what he was charged with being (see ch. John 19:8 ; Joh 19:12 ), from the mention of which he immediately ( Joh 18:35 ) recoils, and implies the other side of the dilemma.
