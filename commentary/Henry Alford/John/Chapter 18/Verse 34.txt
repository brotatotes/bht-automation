<b> 34.</b>] On this whole interview, see note on Luke vv. 3, 4.<br><br> I regard this question,<b> Sayest thou this thing of thyself...</b> as intended to distinguish the senses of the word<i> King</i> as applied to Jesus: and of course not for the<i> information</i> of Him who asked it, but to bring out this distinction in Pilate’s mind. If he asked<i> of</i><i> himself</i>, the word could certainly have but one meaning, and that one would be wrongly applied;—if from information derived from the Jews, this very fact would open the way to the true meaning in which He was King of the Jews. Stier and Ebrard think there may be some reference in the words<b> of thyself</b>, to a momentary earnestness in Pilate’s own mind,—a suspicion that his prisoner<i> was</i> what he was charged with being (see ch. xix. 8, 12), from the mention of which he immediately (ver. 35) recoils, and implies the other side of the dilemma.
