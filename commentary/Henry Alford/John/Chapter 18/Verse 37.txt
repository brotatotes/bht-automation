<p><strong> 37.</strong> ] It is best to take <strong> οὐκοῦν β</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἶ σύ</strong> as interrogative, <strong> Art Thou then a King?</strong> on account of what follows.
	</p>
<p><strong> σύ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> emphatic and sarcastic.
	</p>
<p><strong> σὺ λέγεις</strong> ] A formula neither classical nor found in the LXX, but frequent in the Rabbinical writings: see Schöttgen, Hor. Hebr. on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:25">Matthew 26:25</span> . It seems best to punctuate at λέγεις , and regard <strong> ὅτι</strong> as the reason for the affirmation conveyed in σὺ λέγεις . This agrees best with the order of the words, β . εἰμ . [ ἐγώ ], and with the continued affirmation which follows. The first ἐγώ , if genuine, refers to Pilate’s σύ .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐγὼ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> τῇ ἀληθείᾳ</strong> ] Our Lord here preached the Truth of his mission, upholding that side of it best calculated for the doubting philosophic mind of the day, of which Pilate was a partaker. He declares the unity and objectivity of Truth; and that Truth must come from above, and must come through a Person sent by God, and that that Person was Himself.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐγώ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> both times emphatic, and majestically set (see above) against the preceding scornful <strong> σύ</strong> <strong> .
	</strong></p>
<p><strong> εἰς τοῦτο γεγέννημαι</strong> implies that He was <em> born</em> a King, and that He was born with a definite purpose. The words are a pregnant proof of an Incarnation of the Son of God. This great truth is further expressed by <strong> ἐλήλυθα εἰς τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> .:</strong> ‘I have been born, but not therein commencing my being I <em> have come into</em> the world.’ Thus certainly are the words to be understood, and not of his public appearance, his ἀνάδειξις (as Lücke, De Wette), nor as synonymous with γεγέννημαι . It is this saying which began the <em> fear</em> in Pilate, which the charge of the Jews, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:7">John 19:7</span> , increased.
	</p>
<p><strong> τῇ ἀληθείᾳ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not τὴν ἀλήθειαν : not ‘the truth,’ so that what He said should be <em> true</em> , but <strong> to the Truth,</strong> in its objective reality: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17">John 17:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span> , of which deep saying this is the popular exposition for his present hearer.
	</p>
<p>The Lord, besides, sets forth here in the depth of these words, the very idea of all kinghood. The <em> King</em> is the representative of the truth: the truth of dealing between man and man; the truth of that power, which in its inmost truth belongs to the great and only Potentate, the King of Kings.
	</p>
<p>Again, the Lord, the King of manhood and the world, the second Adam, came to testify to the <em> truth</em> of manhood and the world, which sin and Satan had concealed. This testimony to the Truth is to be the weapon whereby His Kingdom will be spread; ‘every one who is of the truth,’ i.e. here in the most general sense, every one who is a true dealer with his own heart, who has <em> an ear to hear</em> , ‘of such are my subjects composed: they hear my voice.’ But for the putting this true dealing on its <em> proper and only ground</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:47">John 8:47</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span> .</p>
