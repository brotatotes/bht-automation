<b> 37.</b>] The word<b> thou</b>, in Pilate’s question, is emphatic and sarcastic. “Art THOU, thus captured, bound, standing here as a criminal in peril of thy life, A KING?”<br><br><b> Thou sayest</b>] A formula frequent in the Rabbinical writings: and conveying assent to the previous enquiry. It seems best, as in margin, to punctuate at<b> it</b>, and regard<b> for</b>, or<b> because</b>, as the reason for the affirmation conveyed in<b> Thou sayest it</b>. This agrees best with the continued affirmation which follows.<br><br><b> To this end have I been born...</b>] Our Lord here preached the Truth of his mission, upholding that side of it best calculated to meet the doubting philosophic mind of the day, of which Pilate was a partaker. He declares the unity and outward reality of Truth:—and that Truth must come from above, and must come through a Person sent by God, and that that Person was Himself.<br><br> “<b>I</b>,” is both times emphatic, and majestically set (see above) against the preceding scornful<b> thou</b> of Pilate.<br><br> Our Lord implies that He was<i> born</i> a King, and that He was born with a definite purpose. The words are a pregnant proof of an Incarnation of the Son of God. This great truth is further expressed by what follows,— ‘I have been born, but not therein commencing my being—I am (or, have) come into the world.’ Thns certainly are the words to be understood, and not of His public appearance, nor as synonymous with His<i> having been born</i>. It is this saying which began the<i> fear</i> in Pilate, which the charge of the Jews, ch. xix. 7, increased.<br><br> He is come into the world, not merely to speak truth, but to bear witness<b> to the Truth</b>, in its outward reality:—see ch. xvii. 17, 19, of which deep saying this is the popular exposition for his present hearer.<br><br> The Lord, besides, sets forth here in the depth of these words, the very idea of all kinghood. The<i> King</i> is the representative of the truth: the truth of dealing between man and man;—the truth of that power, which in its inmost truth belongs to the great and only Potentate, the King of Kings.<br><br> Again, the Lord, the King of manhood and the world, the second Adam, came to testify to the<i> truth</i> of manhood and the world, which sin and Satan had concealed. This testimony to the Truth is to be the weapon whereby His Kingdom will be spread;— ‘every one who is of the truth,’ i.e. here in the most general sense, every one who is a true dealer with his own heart, who has<i> an</i><i> ear to hear</i>,— ‘of such are my subjects composed:—they hear my voice.’ But for the putting this true dealing on its<i> proper</i><i> and only ground</i>, see ch. viii. 47; vi. 44.
