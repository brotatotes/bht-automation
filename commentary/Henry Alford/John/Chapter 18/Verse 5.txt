<b> 5.</b>] Some among them knew Him (Matt. xxvi. 55), others probably not. This answer may have been given by some one in authority among the Roman soldiers, who had it in command ‘to apprehend Jesus of Nazareth.’<br><br><b> Judas.... was standing with them</b>] I believe these words to be the description of an eye-witness;—St. John detected Judas standing among them, and notices the detail, as is his constant habit, by way of enhancing the tragic character of the history. The narrative common to the three Gospels related the kiss which presently took place; but this self-tradition of our Lord was not related in it. St. John therefore adds this touch of exactness, to shew that the answer,<b> Jesus of Nazareth</b>, was not given because they were ignorant of His Person, so as<i> not to be able</i> to say ‘Thee;’—but because they<i> feared</i> to say it.
