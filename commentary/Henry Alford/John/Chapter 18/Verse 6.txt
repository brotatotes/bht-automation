<b> 6.</b>] The question on the miraculous nature of this incident is not whether it was a miracle<i> at all</i> (for it is evident that it<i> must</i> be regarded as one), but whether it were an act<i> specially</i><i> intended</i> by our Lord, or a result of the superhuman dignity of His person, and the majestic calmness of His reply. I believe the latter alternative to be the right one. Commentators cite various instances of the confusion of the enemies of<i> innocent men</i> before the calinness and dignity of their victims: how much more was this likely to be the case when He in whom was no sin, and who spake as never man spake, came forth to meet His implacable foes as the self-sacrificing Lamb of God. So that I regard it rather as a miracle<i> consequent upon</i> that which Christ said and did, and the state of mind in which His enemies were,—than as one, in the strict sense,<i> wrought by</i> Him: bearing however always in mind, that to Him nothing was<i> unexpected</i>, or a<i> mere result</i>, but every thing foreknown. With this view what follows is also consistent, rather than with the other.<br><br> The distinction is an important one, as the view which we take of our Lord’s mind towards His captors must enter, as an element, into our understanding of the whole of this scene, and indeed of the solemn occurrences which follow. Such incidents as this are not related by the Evangelists, and least of all by St. John, as mere astounding facts, but as grounds on which we are to enquire, and determine for ourselves, as to the “glory, full of grace and truth,” which was in Him, whom, not having seen, we love.
