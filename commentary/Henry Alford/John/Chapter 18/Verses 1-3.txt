John presents us with most striking instances of the troubling of the human soul of Christ by the suffering which was before Him: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:23-27">John 12:23-27</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:21">John 13:21</span> .
