 1 3. ] Matthew 26:30-47 . Mark 14:26-43 .Luke 22:39-53; Luke 22:39-53 . On the omission by John of the conflict of the Redeemerâ€™s soul in Gethsemane, I would remind the reader of what has been said in the Prolegomena on the character of this Gospel. The attempt to find in this omission a discrepancy between the setting forth of the Redeemer by John and the synoptic Gospels, is, as usual, unsuccessful. John presents us with most striking instances of the troubling of the human soul of Christ by the suffering which was before Him: see ch. John 12:23-27 ; John 13:21 . Compare notes on Matthew 26:36 , and throughout the section.
