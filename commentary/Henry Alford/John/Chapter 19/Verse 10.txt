No just judge has any such power as this, to punish or to loose (see 2 Cor. xiii. 8); but only patiently to enquire and give sentence according to the truth.<br><br><b> unto me</b>, emphatic: it perhaps being implied, ‘Thou hast, I know, refused to reply to others before.’ That Pilate should put the<i> releasing</i> first, as it stands in the most ancient authorities, seems most natural, as appealing most to the prisoner: the power of<i> crucifying</i> follows as the alternative in case the other is rejected.
