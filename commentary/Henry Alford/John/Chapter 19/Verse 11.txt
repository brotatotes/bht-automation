<b> 11.</b>] This last testimony of our Lord before Pilate is a<i> witness to the truth</i>: opening in a wonderful manner the secret of Pilate’s vaunted power, of His own humble submission, and the sinfulness of His enemies. This saying, observes Meyer, breathes truth and grace. The great stress is on the term<b> from above</b>, on which Grotius strikingly says, “<i>thence, that is, from whence I am sprung;</i>” so that it furnishes a remarkable answer to the above. We must not dream of any allusion to<i> Rome</i>, or the<i> Sanhedrim</i>, in this question “<i>Whence art thou</i>?” as the sources of Pilate’s power:—the word was not so meant, nor so understood: see ver. 12.<br><br> The word it does not refer to<i> power against me</i>, but embraces in itself the whole delegation from above, power included: and the words “except it were given thee from above,” are equivalent to<i> except by appointment from above</i>. Lampe remarks: “Our Lord concedes to Pilate 1) Power. He acknowledged the authority of a human court, because His kingdom was not earthly, destroying human magistrates: nor did He dispute the authority of Pilate and the Romans over the Jews. 2) He even amplifies that power, as given from above. For this is the Christian doctrine, that all power is from God (Rom. xiii. 1, 2). 3) He acknowledges that that power extended even over Himself, since all concerning Him was being done by divine decree (Acts iv. 28).”<br><br><b> for this cause</b>] viz. because of what has just been asserted, ‘<i>Thou wouldest have no power&c</i>.”<br><br> The connexion is somewhat difficult. I take it to be this: ‘God has given to thee<i> power over</i> me;—not insight into the character which I claim, that of being the Son of God—but simply<i> power</i>: that insight belonged to others, viz. the Sanhedrim, and their president, whose office it was to judge that claim;<i> they</i> have judged against the clearest evidence and rejected me, the Son of God; thy sin, that of blindly exercising thy<i> power</i>, sin though it be, is therefore<i> less than theirs</i>, who being God’s own people, and with God’s word of prophecy before them (and the High Priest, with his own prophetic word before him,—see ch. xviii. 14), deliberately gave me over into thy hand.’ It is important to this, which I believe to be the only right understanding of the words, to remember that Pilate, from ver. 6, was making himself simply their tool;—He was the sinful, but at the same time the blind instrument of their deliberate malice.<br><br><b> he that delivereth me unto thee</b>] Beyond question,<i> Caiaphas</i>,—to whom the initiative on the Jewish side belonged; by whose authority all was done. At the same time the whole Sanhedrim are probably included under the guilt of their chief.<br><br> In this word<b> sin</b> is an implied reference to a higher Judge—nay, that Judge Himself speaks.
