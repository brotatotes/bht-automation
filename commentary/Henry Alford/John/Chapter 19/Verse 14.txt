<b> 14. the preparation of the passover</b>] The signification, ‘Friday in the Passover week,’ has found many, and some recent, defenders. But this is not the natural meaning of the words, nor would it ever have been thought of in this place, but for the difficulty arising from the whole Passover question, which I have discussed on Matt. xxvi. 17–19, and on ch. xviii. 28.<br><br><b> This preparation day</b> is<i> ‘the vigil of the Passover</i>,’ i.e. the day preceding the evening when the passover was killed. And so it must be understood here, especially when connected with ch. xviii. 28. See on the whole matter the notes above referred to.<br><br><b> about the sixth hour</b>] There is an insuperable difficulty, as the text now stands. For St. Mark relates, ch. xv. 25, that the<i> crucifixion</i> took place at the<i> third hour</i>: and that it certainly was so, the whole arrangement of the day testifies. For on the one hand, the judgment could hardly have taken the whole day till noon: and on the other, there will not thus be time left for the rest of the events of the day, before the sabbath began. We must certainly suppose, as did Eusebius, Theophylact, and Severus, that there has been some very early erratum in our copies; whether the interchange of 3 and 6, which when expressed in Greek numeral letters, are not unlike one another (<i>Γ</i> and<i> Ϛ</i>), or some other, cannot now be determined.<br><br> We certainly may bring the two accounts nearer together by recollecting that, as the crucifixion itself certainly did not (see in Mark) take place<i> exactly</i> at the third hour, and as here it is<b> about</b><i> the sixth hour</i>, some intermediate time may be described by both Evangelists. But this is not satisfactory: see note on Mark xv. 25. The solution given by Dr. Wordsworth, after Townson and others, that St. John’s reckoning of the hours is different, and like our own, so that the sixth hour would be 6 A.M., besides being unsupported by any authority (see ch. i. 39; iv. 6, 52; xi. 9, and notes), would leave here the difficulty that there must thus elapse three hours between the hearing before Pilate and the Crucifixion. Besides which, we may ask, is it possible to imagine St. John, with the other gospels before him as these expositors believe him to have had, adopting without notice an independent reckoning of his own which would introduce utter confusion into that history which (again on their hypothesis) he wrote his gospel to complete and clear up?<br><br> The words<b> Behold your King</b> seem to have been spoken in irony to the Jews—in the same spirit in which afterwards the title, was written over the cross:—partly perhaps also, as in that case, in consequence of the saying in ver. 12,—to sever himself altogether from the suspicion there cast on him.
