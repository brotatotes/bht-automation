<b> 15.</b>]<b> We have no king but Cæsar</b>, was a degrading confession from the<i> chief priests</i> of that people of whom it was said, ‘The Lord your God is your King.’ 1 Sam. xii. 12. “They were so earnest in repudiating Jesus,” says Bengel, “that they repudiate their Messiah altogether.” However, the cry furthered the present purpose, and to this all was sacrificed, including truth itself; for the confession was not only degrading, but false in their mouths. Some of those who now cried this, died miserably in rebellion against Cæsar forty years afterwards.
