<b> 19.</b>] Matt. ver. 37.<br><br> The Latin was the official language, the Greek that usually spoken,—the Hebrew (i. e. Aramaic) that of the common people.<br><br><b> What I have written I have written</b>] The first perfect denotes the past action; the second that it was complete and unalterable.<br><br> The garments of the executed were by law the perquisite of the soldiers on duty.<br><br> The<b> coat</b> was the tunic. It reached from the neck to the feet, and was fastened round the throat with a clasp. It was properly a priest’s garment, and was woven of linen, or perhaps of wool.<br><br> The citation is verbatim from the LXX.
