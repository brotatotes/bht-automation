<b> 25.</b>] In Matt. xxvii. 55, 56, and the parallel places, we learn that two of these were looking on afar off, after Jesus had expired, with Salome. Considering then that St. John’s habit of not naming himself might extend to his mother (he names his father, ch. xxi. 2), we may well believe that<b> his mother’s sister</b> here represents<i> Salome</i>, and that<i> four</i> women are designated by this description. So Wieseler and Meyer, Luthardt opposing them. So also Ewald: and, which is no mean evidence, the ancient Syriac version, inserting<i> and</i> between, “<i>the mother’s sister</i>,<b> and</b><i> Mary</i>....” This Mary was wife of Klopas (Alphæus, see Matt. x. 3, and Introd. to Ep. of James,§i. 4), the mother of James the Less and Joses; Matt., Mark.
