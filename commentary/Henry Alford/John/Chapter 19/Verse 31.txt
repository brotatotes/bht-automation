<b> 31.</b>] On the Jewish custom, see note, Matt. xxvii. 57.<br><br><b> that sabbath day was an high day</b>, being as it was (see note on ch. xviii. 28, and Matt. xxvi. 17)<i> a double sabbath</i>: the coincidence of the first day of unleavened bread (Ex. xii. 16) with an ordinary sabbath.<br><br><b> that their legs might be broken</b>] The<i> breaking of the legs</i> was sometimes appended to the punishment of crucifixion, but docs not appear to have been inflicted for the purpose of causing death, which indeed it would not do. Friedlieb supposes that the term involved in it the ‘<i>coup de grace</i>,’ which was given to all executed criminals, and that the piercing with the spear was this death-blow, and was also inflicted on the thieves.
