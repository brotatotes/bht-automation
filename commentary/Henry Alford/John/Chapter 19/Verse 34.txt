<b> 34.</b>] The lance must have penetrated deep, for the object was to<i> ensure</i> death,—and see ch. xx. 27, probably into the<i> left</i> side, on account of the position of the soldier, and of what followed.<br><br><b> blood and water</b>] The spear perhaps pierced the pericardium or envelope of the heart, in which case a liquid answering the description of<b> water</b> may have flowed with the blood. But the quantity would be so small as scarcely to have been observed. It is hardly possible that the separation of the blood into placenta and serum should so soon have taken place, or that, if it had, it should have been by an observer described as<i> blood and water</i>. It is more probable that the fact, which is here so strongly testified, was a consequence of the extreme exhaustion of the Body of the Redeemer. The medical opinions on the point are very various, and by no means satisfactory. Meyer's view after all seems to be the safe and true one—that the circumstance is related as a miraculous sign, having deep significance as to the work of the Redeemer, and shewing Him to be more than mortal. It can be no reason against this, that St. John does not<i> here</i> dwell on any such typical significance: nor can I see how 1 John v. 6 ff. can be understood without reference to this fact: see note there.
