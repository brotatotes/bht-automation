<b> 35.</b>] This emphatic affirmation of the fact seems to regard rather the whole incident, than the mere outflowing of the blood and water. It was the object of St. John to shew that the Lord’s Body was a<i> real body</i>, and<i> underwent real death</i>. And both these were shewn by what took place: not so much by the phænomenon of the water and blood, as by the infliction of such a wound,—after which, even had not death taken place before, there could not by any possibility be life remaining.<br><br> The third person (<b>he that saw it</b>....) gives solemnity. It is, besides, in accordance with St. John’s way of speaking of himself throughout the Gospel.<br><br> The usage of the word<b> believe</b> in St. John makes it probable that he lays the weight on the proof of the<i> reality</i> of the death, as above. The clause,<b> that ye may believe</b>, depends on the three preceding clauses, without any parenthesis, as the final aim of what has gone before:<b> in order that</b> your faith may receive confirmation.
