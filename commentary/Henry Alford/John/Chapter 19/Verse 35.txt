<p><strong> 35.</strong> ] This emphatic affirmation of the fact seems to regard rather the whole incident than the mere outflowing of the blood and water. It was the object of John to shew that the Lord’s Body was a <em> real body</em> , and <em> underwent real death</em> . And both these were shewn by what took place: not so much by the phænomenon of the water and blood, as by the infliction of such a wound, after which, even had not death taken place before, there could not by any possibility be life remaining. So Lücke: except that he seems to refer ἑωρακώς more to the whole circumstances of the death of Jesus.

<p>Meyer is for keeping <strong> ἀληθινή</strong> here to its strict sense, not <em> true</em> , but <em> genuine, real</em> . Perhaps the best account to be given of the word is to be found in the use of <strong> ἀληθῆ</strong> immediately afterwards of the matter of the testimony. The things related are ἀληθῆ : the narrative of them is ἀληθινή , a narrative of truth.

<p>Some have fancied that by the use of <strong> ἐκεῖνος</strong> here, the narrator necessarily signifies not himself, but some third person. But it has been shewn above (see note on ch. Joh 7:29 ) that St. John constantly uses ἐκεῖνος merely as emphatically taking up again the main subject of the sentence. The use of <strong> πιστεύειν</strong> in John makes it probable that he lays the weight on the proof of the <em> reality</em> of the death, as above. The <strong> ἵνα</strong> depends on the three preceding clauses, without any parenthesis, as the final aim of what has gone before: <strong> in order that;</strong> not, ‘ <em> so that</em> .’</p>
