<p><strong> 37.</strong> ] LXX, ἐπιβλέψονται πρός με , ἀνθ ʼ ὧν κατωρχήσαντο but the Evangelist has given the literal and, as now acknowledged (Lücke), true sense of the word דָּקַר . The <strong> ὄψονται</strong> does not refer to the Roman soldiers, but to the repentant in the world, who, at the time the Gospel was written, had begun to fulfil the prophecy: and is not without a prophetic reference to the future conversion of Israel, who were here the real <em> piercers</em> , though the act was done διὰ χειρὸς ἀνόμων .</p>
