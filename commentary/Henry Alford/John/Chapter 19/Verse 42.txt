<b> 42.</b>]<b> the Jews’ preparation day</b> seems to indicate clearly the preparation<i> of the Passover</i>, as I have before maintained that the words mean; not the mere day of the week so called, which, as it was by the Christians also in the Apostles’ time named<i> the preparation</i> (Parascévé),<i> would not be qualified</i> by the additional statement that it was “<i>the Jews</i>’ preparation day.”
