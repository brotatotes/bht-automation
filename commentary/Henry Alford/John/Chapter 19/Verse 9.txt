 9. ] He entered, taking Jesus with him.
	 πόθεν i.e. not ‘from what province?’ for he knew this, Luke 23:6-7 ; nor, ‘of what parents?’ but  whence? in reference to υἱὸς θεοῦ : cf. πόθεν γένος εὔχεται εἶναι , Hom. Od.  ρ . 373. Observe that the fear of Pilate is not mere superstition, nor does it enter into the Jewish meaning of υἱὸς θ .: but arises from an indefinite impression made on him by the Person and bearing of our Lord. We must not therefore imagine any fear of Him as being a ‘son of the gods,’ in Pilate’s mind (so even Luthardt): this gives a wrong direction to his conduct, and misses the fine psychological truth of the narrative.
	Our Lord, in His silence, was acting according to His own precept, Matthew 7:6 . Notwithstanding Pilate’s fear of Him, he was not in earnest; not determined to be led by his conscience, but had already given way to the unjust demands of the people; and He who saw his heart, knew how unworthy he was of an answer to so momentous a question. Besides, this silence was the most emphatic answer to all who had ears to hear it; was a reference to what He had said before, ch. John 18:37 , and so a witness to His divine origin. Would any  mere man , of true and upright character, have refused an answer to such a question, so put? Let the modern rationalist consider this.
