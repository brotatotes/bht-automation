<b> 9.</b>] He entered, taking Jesus with him.<br><br><b> Whence</b>] i.e. not ‘from what province?’—for he knew this, Luke xxiii. 6, 7: nor, ‘of what parents?’—but<b> whence?</b> in reference to the name,<b> the Son of God</b>:<i> Whence is thine origin?</i> Observe that the fear of Pilate is not mere superstition, nor does it enter into the Jewish meaning of “<i>the Son of God:</i>” but arises from an indefinite impression made on him by the Person and bearing of our Lord. We must not therefore imagine any fear of Him as being a ‘son of the gods,’ in Pilate’s mind: this gives a wrong direction to his conduct, and misses the fine psychological truth of the narrative.<br><br> Our Lord, in His silence, was acting according to His own precept, Matt. vii. 6. Notwithstanding Pilate’s fear of Him, he was not in earnest;—not determined to be led by his conscience, but had already given way to the unjust demands of the people; and He who saw his heart, knew how unworthy he was of an answer to so momentous a question. Besides, this silence was the most emphatic answer to all who had ears to hear it;—was a reference to what He had said before, ch. xviii. 37, and so a witness to His divine origin. Would any<i> mere man</i>, of true and upright character, have refused an answer to such a question, so put? Let the modern rationalist consider this.
