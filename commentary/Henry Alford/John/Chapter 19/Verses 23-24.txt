 23, 24. ]  οὖν goes back to John 19:18 . There were four soldiers, a τετράδιον , Acts 12:4 ,  and a centurion? “centurio supplicio præpositus,” Seneca de Ira, 16 (Friedlieb).
	The garments of the executed were by law the perquisite of the soldiers on duty. Dig. xlviii. 20. 6 (Friedlieb).
	The tunic was the so-called ‘toga ocellata,’ or ‘byssina.’ It reached from the neck to the feet, and was fastened round the throat with a clasp. It was properly a priest’s garment (see Jos. Antt. iii. 7. 4), and was woven of linen, or perhaps of wool (Friedlieb).
	The citation is verbatim from the LXX. In it, ἱμάτια = the upper garments, ἱματισμός the tunic. Again, beware of any evasion of ἵνα .
