<b> 11.]</b> The words may also be rendered. according to the reading of most of our ancient MSS.,<b> This wrought Jesus as the beginning of his miracles</b>.<br><br> This assertion of St. John excludes all the apocryphal miracles of the Gospel of the Infancy, and such like works, from credit.<br><br> The word<b> sign</b>, which occasionally occurs in the other Gospels and the Acts in this absolute sense of<i> a miracle</i> (e. g. in the original of Mark xvi. 17, 20; Luke xxiii. 8; Acts iv. 16, 22; viii. 6), is St. John’s ordinary word for it.<br><br><b> his glory]</b> The glory, namely, which is referred to in ch. i. 14, where see note. It was a miracle eminently shewing forth the glory of the<i> Word, by whom all things were made</i>, in His state of having become flesh. And this ‘<i>believing on Him</i>,’ here predicated of the disciples, was certainly a higher faith than that which first led them to Him. They obtained new insight into His power:—not yet reflectively, so as to infer what all this implied, but so as to increase their faith and trust in Him. Again and again ‘<i>they believed</i>:’ new degrees of faith being attained; just as this has since been the case, and will continue to be, in the Church, in the continual providential development of the Christian spirit,—the leavening of the whole lump by degrees.<br><br> This important miracle, standing us it does<i> at the very entrance of the official life of Christ</i>, has been the subject of many doubts, and attempts to get rid of, or explain away, the power which was here manifested. Butnever did a narrative present a more stubborn inflexibility to the wresters of Scripture:—never was simple historical veracity more strikingly stamped on any miracle than on this. And doubtless this is providentially so arranged: sec the objections to it treated, and some admirable concluding remarks, in Lücke, i. 478.
