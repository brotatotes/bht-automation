 To those who yet seek some sufficient<i> cause</i> for the miracle being wrought, we may—besides the conclusive answer that we are not in a position to treat this question satisfactorily,—assign the unmistakeable spiritual import of the change here made, as indicating the general nature of the beneficent work which the Lord came on earth to do. So Cornelius a Lapide: “Chuist, at the beginning of His ministry, by changing water into wine, signified, that He was about to change the Mosaic law, insipid and cold as water, into the Gospel of Grace, which is as wine, generous, full-flavoured, ardent, and powerful.” Similarly Eusebius, Augustine, Bernard, and Gregory the Great.<b> II 12—IV. 54.] FIRST MANIFESTATION OF HIMSELF AS THE SON OF GOD:—and herein, ii. 13—iii. 36, IN JERUSALEM AND JUDÆA.</b><br><br><b> 12.] went down</b>, because Capernaum lay on the lake,—Cana higher up the country. There is no certainty as to this visit, whether or not it is the same with that hinted at in Luke iv. 23: so that no chronological inferences can be built on the hypothesis with any security.
