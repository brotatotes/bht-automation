<b> 19.]</b> This answer of our Lord has been involved in needless difficulty. That in uttering the words, this temple, He<i> pointed</i> to His own Body, is inconceivable;—for thus both the Jews and His own disciples must have understood Him, which (see vv. 20, 22) neither of them did. That He implied in saying,<b> Destroy this temple</b>,<i> that their lawless proceedings in the temple would at last bring it to an end</i>, is equally inconceivable; both on account of the latter part of His declaration, which would thus have no meaning,—and because of the use in this case of the peculiar word,—which signifies<i> the holy and the holiest place</i>, the<i> temple itself</i>,—as distinguished from the whole enceinte of the sacred buildings. Stier has well remarked that our Lord in this saying<i> comprehended in the reality</i>,—His own Body,<i> its type and symbol</i>,—the temple then before them. That temple, with all its ordinances and holy places, was but the shadow of the Christian Church;—that, the type of the Body of the Lord, represented the Church, which is<i> veritably His Body</i>. And so the saying was fulfilled by the slaying of His actual Body, in which rejection of Him the destruction of the Jewish temple and city was involved,—and the raising of that Body after three days, in which resurrection we, all the members of His new glorified Body, are risen again. The difficulties attending the interpretation are,—hesides the double meaning which I have treated above,—<br><br> (1)<i> the use of the imperative, as applied to the death of Christ</i>. But this surely may be understood as used hypothetically, and not by way of command. Matt. xii. 33 ( “muke the tree good, &c.”) is an instance in point.<br><br> (2)<i> The words</i><b> I will raise it up</b>—seeing that the resurrection of the Lord is ever spoken of as<i> the work of the Father</i>. Yes,—but by power committed to Christ Himself;—see ch. x. 18, where this is distinctly asserted: and ch. vi. 39, 40, 44, where it is implied, for He is the first-fruits of them that sleep,—and (though the whole course of His working was after the will of the Father,—and in the Spirit, which wrought in Him) strictly and truly<i> raised Himself</i> from the dead in the sense here intended.<br><br> (3)<i> The utterance of such a prophecy at so early a period of His official life.</i> But it was not a prophecy known and understood,—but a<i> dark saying</i>, from which no one could then draw an inference as to His death or resurrection. The disciples did not understand it; and I cannot agree with Stier that the Jews could have had any idea of such being His meaning. Chrysostom says, “He speaks many such things, which were not plain to men at the time, but to those who should come after. Why does He do this? that He might be shewn to Lave foreknown future events, when the accomplishment of the prophecy should have come: which has come to pass in the case of this very prophecy.” Lücke remarks, that the circumstance of the words being spoken so long before his trial by the Sanhedrim, would make it more easy for the false witnesses to distort them. This they did, but not so as to agree with one another. They reported it, ‘I can destroy,’&c. which makes a wide difference, and represents our Lord as an enemy of the temple (Matt. xxvi. 61), and some added to<b> this temple</b> the epithet “<i>which is made with hands</i>,” and that He would raise another “<i>made without hands</i>” (Mark xiv. 58).
