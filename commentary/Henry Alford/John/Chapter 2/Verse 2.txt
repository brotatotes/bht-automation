	In this case, there must have been some other reason for the invitation, besides mere previous acquaintance. This would be the probable reason for  Jesus Himself being invited; but the  disciples , being from various places in the district, can hardly  all have been (De Wette)  friends of the family . The fact of Jesus having attached disciples to Himself must have been known, and they were doubtless invited  from consideration to Him .
	Our Lord at once opens His ministry with the character which He gives of himself Matthew 11:18-19 , as distinguished from the asceticism of John. He also, as Trench admirably remarks (Miracles, edn. 2, p. 98, note), gives us his own testimony against the tendency which our indolence ever favours, of giving up those things and occasions to the world and the devil, which we have not Christian boldness to mingle in and purify. Even Cyprian, for instance, proscribes such festivals, “nuptiarum festa improba et convivia lasciva vitentur, quorum periculosa contagio est.” De Habitu Virginum, ch. 21. p. 460. And such is the general verdict of modern religionism, which would keep the leaven distinct from the lump, for fear  it should become  unleavened . The especial honour conferred upon  marriage by the Lord should also be noticed. “He here adorned and beautified it with his presence, and first miracle that He wrought.”
