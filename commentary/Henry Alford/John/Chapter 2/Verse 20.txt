<b> 20.]</b> The building of the temple by Herod the Great is stated by Josephus in one place to have been begun in the<i> eighteenth</i> year of his reign; in another, in the<i> fifteenth</i>; the ditlerence being made by counting his reign from the death of Antigonus, or from his appointment by the Romans. Reckoning from this latter, we shall have twenty years till the birth of Christ, and thirty years since that event, from which fifty, however, four must be taken, since our era is four years too late. This gives forty-six. The temple was not completed till A.D. 64, under Herod Agrippa II., and the procurator Albinus; so that<b> was in building</b> must refer to the greater part of the work now completed.
