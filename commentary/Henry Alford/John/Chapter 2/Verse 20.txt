 20. ] The building of the temple by Herod the Great is stated by Josephus, in Antt. xv. 11. 1, to have been begun in the  eighteenth year of his reign; in B. J. i. 21. 1, in the  fifteenth: the difference being made by counting his reign from the death of Antigonus, or from his appointment by the Romans, see Antt. xvii. 8. 1. Reckoning from this latter, we shall have twenty years till the birth of Christ, and thirty years since that event, from which fifty, however, four must be taken, since our era is four years too late. This gives forty-six. The temple was not completed till A.D. 64, under Herod Agrippa II., and the procurator Albinus; so that  ᾠκοδομήθη  ,  was in building , must refer to the greater part of the work now completed. The sense of this aor. is curiously illustrated by a passage in Ezra 5:16 , τότε Σαβανασὰρ ἐκεῖνος ἧλθε καὶ ἔδωκε θεμελίους τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ , καὶ ἀπὸ τότε ἕως τοῦ νῦν ᾠκοδομήθη καὶ οὐκ ἐτελέσθη .
