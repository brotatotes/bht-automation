<b> 22.]</b><b> the Scripture</b>, by all analogy, must mean the<i> O.T. scriptures</i>. That the resurrection of the Lord is the subject of O.T. prophecy, we find in several passages of the N.T., see ch. xx. 9; Luke xxiv. 26, 27; 1 Cor. xv. 4. At first sight it appears difficult to fix on any passage in which it is directly announced: but with the deeper understanding of the Scriptures which the Holy Spirit gave the Apostles and still gives the Christian Church, such prophecies as that in Ps. xvi. are recognized as belonging to Him in Whom alone they are properly fulfilled; see also Hos. vi. 2.
