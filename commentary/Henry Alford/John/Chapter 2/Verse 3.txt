<b> 3.]</b> There is no necessity to suppose that the feast had lasted several days, as Do Wette and Lücke do. It has been suggested that the unexpected presence of the disciples may have occasioned a failure in the previously sufficient supply: a gloss in one of the old Latin MSS. has, “And it came to pass, that through the great number of guests the wine was used up.”<br><br> The mother of Jesus evidently is<i> in a position of authority</i> (see ver. 5) in the house, which was probably that of a near relative. The conjectures and traditions on the subject are many, and wholly unsatisfactory.<br><br> A graver question arises as to the intent with which this,<b> They have no wine</b>, was said. She cannot have had<i> from experience</i> any reason to suppose that her Son would work a miracle, for this (ver. 11)<i> was His first</i>. Chrysostom and others suggest that, knowing Him to be Who He was, she had been by the recent divine acknowledgment of Him and His calling disciples to Himself, led to expect the manifestation of His Messianic power about this time; and here seemed an occasion for it. Some of the other explanations are: “that she had always found Him a wise counsellor, and mentioned the want to Him merely that He might suggest some way of remedying it.” Cocceius. “Do thou depart, that the other guests may do the same, before the lack of wine is noticed.” Bengel. “That by some pious exhortation He might prevent the guests from feeling annoyance, and at the same time spare the bridegroom’s shame.” Calvin, “Jesus had wrought miracles, but in secret, before this.” Tholuck.
