 On the whole, the most probable explanation is that of Lücke, which somewhat modifies the first hero mentioned,—that our Lord Himself had recently given some reason to expect that He would shew forth His glory by wonderful works. So, very nearly, Stier.<b> 4.]</b> The answer of our Lord is beyond question<i> one of reproof</i>, and<i> disclaimer of participation in the grounds on which the request was made.</i> See instances, besides reff. in Josh. xxii, 24: Mark i, 24. And so all the early expositors understood it. Irenæus says, “The Lord, repelling her unseasonable urgency, said,”&c.;—and Chrysostom, “She wished.... to gain glory to herself by means of her Son,” and therefore He “answered her with severity.”<br><br> The Romanist expositors mostly endeavour to divest the answer of any aspect of rebuke, and maintain that it was so uttered for<i> our sakes</i> alone, to teach us that He did not perform His miracles from regard to human affinity, but solely from love and His object of manifesting His glory. So Maldonatus. And this is true:—but first among those to be taught this, was<i> she herself, who had tempted Him to work a miracle from that regard.</i><br><br> It has perhaps not been enough noticed, that in this answer the Lord declares His period of subjection to her as His earthly parent to be at an end. Henceforth His thoughts are not her thoughts. At twelve years of age, see Luke ii. 49, He answers, ‘thy father and I,’ by ‘My Father:’—now, He is to be no longer before the world<i> as Mary’s son</i>, but as sanctified by the Father and sent into the world:—compare Matt. xii. 48–50, and Luke xi. 27, 28.<br><br><b> Woman]</b> There is no reproach in this term: but rather respect. The Lord henceforth uses it towards her, not calling her ‘mother,’ even on the Cross (see ch. xix. 26), doubtless for the reason alleged above.<br><br><b> mine hour is not yet come]</b> This expression,<b> mine hour</b>, is generally used in John of the time of the<i> Death</i> of Christ:—see reff. But it is only so used because His death is in those passages the subject naturally underlying the narrative. It is,<i> any fixed or appointed time</i>;—and therefore here, the appointed time of His self-manifestation by miracles. This time was not yet come, but was close at hand. Some have supposed that the wine was not yet wholly exhausted, and that our Lord would wait till the miracle should be undoubted (so Trench): but Stier well remarks that the known<i> depth</i> of all His early sayings forbids us from attaching only this meaning to it;—and he sees in it a reference to the great marriage-feast and the new fruit of the vine in the Kingdom of God. If this be so, it can be only in the background; the words must have had a present meaning, and I believe it to be, ‘<i>My time, the time at which, from the Father’s appointment and my own concurring will, I am to begin miraculous working, is not yet arrived: forestall it not’</i> Very similarly he speaks, ch. vii. 6, to His brethren, and yet afterwards goes up to the feast. The notion that<b> mine hour</b> refers to the hour of our Lord’s human infirmity on the Cross when (ch. xix. 27) He “acknowledged her as His mother,” Wordsw., seems wholly unfounded. Where do we find any such special acknowledgment there? And why should we go out of our way for a fanciful sense of words which bear an excellent meaning as referring to circumstances then present?
