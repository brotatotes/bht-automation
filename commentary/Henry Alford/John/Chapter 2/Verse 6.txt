<b> 6.]</b> These vessels were for the washings usual at feasts: see Mark vii. 4. There could be no collusion or imposture here, as they were<i> water-vessels</i>, and could have no remnants of wine in them (see also ver. 10). And the large quantity which they held could not have been brought in unobserved. The word here rendered<b> firkin</b> is probably equivalent to the Jewish “<i>bath</i>” (which held 8 gall. 7–4 pints), and stands for it in the LXX, ref. 2 Chron. According to this, the quantity of wine thus created would be 6 times|2 or 3 times|8 gallons 7–4 pints: i.e. 6 times|17 or 25 gallons: i. e, (say, taking the mean,) 6 times 21 gallons: i. e, 126 gallons. The large quantity thus created has been cavilled at by unbelievers. We may leave them to their cavils with just one remark,—that He who creates abundance enough in this. earth to “put temptation in men’s way,” acted on this occasion<i> analogously with His known method of dealing</i>. We may answer an error on the other side (<i>if at be on the other side</i>), by saying that the Lord here most effectually and once for all stamps with His condemnation that false system of moral reformation, which would commence by<i> pledges to abstain from intoxicating liquors</i>. He pours out His bounty for all, and He vouchsafes His grace to<i> each</i> for guidance; and to endeavor to evade the work which He has appointed for each man,—by<i> refusing the bounty, to save the trouble of seeking the grace</i>, is an attempt which inst ever end in degradation of the individual motives, and in social demoralization,—whatever present apparent effects may follow its first promulgation, One visible sign of this degradation, in its intellectual form, is the miserable attempt made by some of the advocates of this movement, to shew that the wine here and in other places of Scripture is unfermented wine, not possessing the power of intoxication.
