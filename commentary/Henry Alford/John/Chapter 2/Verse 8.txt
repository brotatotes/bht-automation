<b> 8.]</b> The<b> ruler of the feast</b> seems to be the same with the “<i>master of a feast</i>” spoken of Ecclus, xxxii. 1, and with the Latin “<i>king</i>,” or “<i>master</i>,” “<i>of the feast</i>.” It would seem, from the place in Ecclesiasticus, that he was<i> one of the guests</i> raised to the post of presiding over the arrangements of the feast. This is however doubted by the older Commentators, who make him not one of the guests, but a person<i> holding this especial office, and attending on feasts.</i> Here, he<i> tastes the wine</i>; and therefore probably was a guest himself.
