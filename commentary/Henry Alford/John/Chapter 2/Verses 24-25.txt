<p><strong> 24, 25.</strong> ] The repetition of <strong> ἐπίστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> has been regarded (Lücke, De Wette) as a sort of play on the word. But I should rather set it down to the simplicity of John’s style.

<p>The meaning is, <strong> He did not trust himself to them</strong> , i.e. treat them as true and earnest disciples: they entered into no spiritual relation with Him, and He in consequence into none with them. The fact of this being narrated shews that it made an impression on the Evangelist, and led him perhaps first to the conclusion which he here expresses, and which higher knowledge enabled him afterwards to place, as he here does, on its right ground: His <em> knowing what was in man</em> . Nothing less than <em> divine knowledge</em> is here set forth; the words are even stronger than if τῶν ἀνθ . and ἐν τοῖς ἀνθ . had been used. Then some reference might have been imagined to the persons here mentioned; but now, the singular is, and must be on all hands, <em> purely generic</em> , as in E. V.</p>
