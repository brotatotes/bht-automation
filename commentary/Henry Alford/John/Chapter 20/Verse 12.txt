<b> 12.</b>] From what has been said above, my readers will not expect me to compare the angelic appearances in the four Gospels. What wonder, if the heavenly hosts were variously and often visible on this great day, when ‘the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?’ What can be more accurate in detail than this description of the vision of Mary? Every word was no doubt carefully related to the Apostle, and as carefully recorded. And all is significant: they are in<i> white</i>, because from the world of light: they<i> sit</i>, as not defending, but peacefully watching the Body: at the<i> Head</i> and the<i> Feet</i>, for the Body of the Lord was from head to foot in the charge of His Father and of His servants.
