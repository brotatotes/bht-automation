<b> 15.</b>] The same kind of repetition by the Lord of what the angel had before said is found in Matt. xxviii. 7–10.<br><br> It is idle to enquire<i> why</i> she thought Him to be the gardener: but I may once for all observe that we must believe the clothing of His risen Body to have been<i> that which He pleased to assume</i>; not earthly clothing, but perhaps some semblance of it. Certainly, in this case, He<i> was clothed</i>;—or she must at once have recognized Him. But see on the words “<i>she turned herself</i>” below.<br><br><b> Sir</b>] The Greek word rendered both “<i>Sir</i>” and “<i>Lord</i>” is one and the same throughout the New Test. We can only judge from the circumstances in each case, which it represents. Here there can be no doubt, seeing that she did not recognize her Lord, that it is merely the appellation of courtesy to an unknown person.<br><br><b> thou</b> is emphatic.<br><br><b> I will take him away</b>] She forgets her lack of strength for this, in the overbearing force of her love.
