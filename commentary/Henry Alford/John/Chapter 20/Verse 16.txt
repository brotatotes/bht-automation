<b> 16.</b>] With one word, and that one word<i> her name</i>, the Lord awakens all the consciousness of His presence: calling her in that tone doubtless in which her soul had been so often summoned to receive divine knowledge and precious comfort.<br><br><b> She turned herself</b>] seems to imply that she had not been looking full at Him before.<br><br><b> Rabboni</b> may mean either<b> my Master</b>,—or only<b> Master</b>; which last appears to be the case here.<br><br> That she gives way to no impassioned exclamations, but pours out her satisfaction and joy in this one word, is also according to the deepest psychological truth. There is an addition found in some of our copies, “<i>and she rushed forward to touch Him</i>:” this is an explanatory gloss to the words “<i>Touch me not</i>”—but doubtless it represents what really was the fact. ‘It was the former name, with which He called her: His former appellation, in which she replied; and now she seeks to renew the former intercourse.’ (Luthardt.)
