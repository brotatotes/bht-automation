<b> 17.</b>] The connexion between the prohibition and its reason is difficult, and has been very variously given. The sense seems to me to be connected with some gesture of the nature alluded to in the addition quoted above, but indicating that she believed she had now gotten Him again, never to be parted from Him. This gesture He reproves as unsuited to the time, and the nature of His present appearance. ‘Do not thus—for I am not yet restored finally to you in the body—I have yet to ascend to the Father.’ This implies in the background<i> another and truer touching</i>, when He should have ascended to the Father. “Thou desirest to touch Me, Mary, and to enjoy friendly intercourse with Me: but that may not be now, for I permit Myself to be seen only for a purpose connected with Mine Office, the confirmation of your faith. But when I shall have ascended to My Father, the time will come that thou mayst enjoy intercourse with the most perfect, not by earthly touch, but by such as befits that place,—heavenly and spiritual.” Grotius. With this my view nearly agrees, not confining (as indeed neither does he) the latter enjoyment to<i> heaven</i> itself, but understanding it to have begun here below. Leo the Great interprets very similarly: see in my Greek Test.
