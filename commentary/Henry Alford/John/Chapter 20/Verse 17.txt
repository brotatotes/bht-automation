<b> 17.</b>] The connexion between the prohibition and its reason is difficult, and has been very variously given. The sense seems to me to be connected with some gesture of the nature alluded to in the addition quoted above, but indicating that she believed she had now gotten Him again, never to be parted from Him. This gesture He reproves as unsuited to the time, and the nature of His present appearance. ‘Do not thus—for I am not yet restored finally to you in the body—I have yet to ascend to the Father.’ This implies in the background<i> another and truer touching</i>, when He should have ascended to the Father. “Thou desirest to touch Me, Mary, and to enjoy friendly intercourse with Me: but that may not be now, for I permit Myself to be seen only for a purpose connected with Mine Office, the confirmation of your faith. But when I shall have ascended to My Father, the time will come that thou mayst enjoy intercourse with the most perfect, not by earthly touch, but by such as befits that place,—heavenly and spiritual.” Grotius. With this my view nearly agrees, not confining (as indeed neither does he) the latter enjoyment to<i> heaven</i> itself, but understanding it to have begun here below. Leo the Great interprets very similarly: see in my Greek Test.<br><br><b> but go....</b>] Stier remarks that this was a far greater honour than that which had been forbidden her;—just as the handling of the Lord allowed to Thomas was a far less thing than the not seeing and yet believing.<br><br><b> to my brethren</b>] By this term He testifies that He has not put off his humanity, nor his love for his own, in his resurrection state: see Heb. ii. 11.<br><br><b> my Father, and your Father</b>] This distinction,<b> my</b>... and<b> your</b>.., when “<i>Our</i>”<i> seems</i> so likely to have been said, has been observed by all Commentators of any depth, as indicating an<i> essential difference in the relations</i>. Cyril of Jerusalem says, “<b>My</b> Father, by nature:<b> your</b> Father, by adoption.” Similarly Augustine; adding, “Nor did He say<i> Our</i><i> God</i>:” wherefore here also is a difference in the relation. “<b>My</b> God, in subjection to whom I am in my human nature,<b> your</b> God, between whom and you I myself am the Mediator.” So that the<b> my</b> is the ground and source of the<b> your</b>: God is<b> His</b> God, directly and properly: but<b> our</b> God, through Him. And the words<b> my</b> God indicate that He is still Man: see Eph. i. 3, and often in the epistles: 1 Cor. iii. 23: and especially Heb. ii. 11. In the words<b> I ascend</b> is included His temporary stay which He was now making with them—<b>I am ascending</b>—i. e. ‘I am on my way.’<b>
