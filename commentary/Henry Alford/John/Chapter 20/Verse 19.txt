 19. ] The circumstance of the doors being shut is mentioned here and in John 20:26 , to indicate  what sort of appearances these were. Suddenly, unaccounted for by any approach, the Lord rendered Himself visible to His disciples. Nor did this affect the truth of that resurrection Body, any more than his withdrawing himself from mortal sight occasionally affected the truth of His fleshly Body. Both were done by that supernatural power dwelling in Him, by which His other miracles were wrought. It seems to have been the normal condition of His fleshly Body, to be visible to mortal eyes: of His risen Body, not to be. But both these He could suspend when He pleased, without affecting the substance or truth of either.
	 διὰ τ  .   φόβ  .   τ  .   Ἰουδ  . ] This was natural enough; the bitter hatred of the Jews (both people and rulers) to their Master, and his own prophetic announcements, would raise in them a dread of incipient persecution, now that He was removed.
	 ἦλθεν not, by ordinary approach; nor,  through the closed doors; nor in any visible manner; but (  subjectively , of  Himself ) the word describes that  unseen arrival among them which preceded His becoming visible to them.
	 ἔστη εἰς τ  .   μ  . ] Compare Luke 24:36 , ἔστη ἐν μέσῳ . The  εἰς  , as in ch. John 21:4 , denotes the  coming , and  standing, in one the standing  without motion thither , which in ordinary cases would be standing as the  result of motion thither; so that in this case  ἔστη itself is the verb of motion.
	 εἰρ  .   ὑμ  . ] See on Luke 24:36 , and ch. John 14:27 .
	Joh 20:20 answers to Luke 24:39 .
	 ἐχάρησαν ] The first and partial fulfilment of ch. John 16:20-22 : see notes there.
	The disciples seem to have  handled Him: see Luke 24:39 ; 1 John 1:1 , and below, John 20:25 .
