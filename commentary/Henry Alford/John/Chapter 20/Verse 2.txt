Does this appear in the plural verb, “<b>we know not</b><i> where they have laid Him</i>,” below? This is not, as Meyer says, precluded by the use of “<i>I know not</i>” in ver. 13. Mary there speaks in her own person, which she might do, however accompanied. Still, probably not. She perhaps uses the plural, as involving all the disciples in her own feeling of ignorance and of consequent sorrow. So Meyer: and it is more natural to take it thus. One thing we may conclude for certain, that<i> she</i>, for some reason,<i> did not see</i> the vision related in the three other Gospels.
