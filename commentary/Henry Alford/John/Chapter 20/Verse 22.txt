<b> 22.</b>] To understand this verse as the outpouring of the Spirit, the fulfilment of the promise of the Comforter, is against all consistency, and most against St. John himself:—see ch. xvi. 7, and ch. vii. 39. To understand it rightly, we have merely to recur to that great key to the meaning of so many dark passages of Scripture, the manifold and gradual unfolding of promise and prophecy in their fulfilment. The presence of the Lord among them<i> now</i> was a slight and temporary fulfilment of His promise of returning to them; and so the imparting of the Spirit<i> now</i>, was a symbol and foretaste of that which they should receive at Pentecost:—just as, to mount a step higher,<i> that itself</i>, in its present abiding with us, is but the firstfruits and pledge (Rom. viii. 23. 2 Cor. i. 22) of the fulness which we shall hereafter inherit. ‘The relation of this saying to the effusion of the Spirit is the same which chap. iii. bears to Baptism, chap. vi. to the Lord’s Supper, chap. xvii. 1 to the Ascension,&c.’ (Luthardt.)
