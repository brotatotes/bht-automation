<b> 28.</b>] The Socinian view, that these words,<b> My Lord and my God</b>, are<i> merely an exclamation</i>, is refuted, (1) By the fact that no such exclamations were in use among the Jews. (2) By the introduction to them, “<i>Thomas said</i> to him.” (3) By the impossibility of referring the words<b> my Lord</b> to another than Jesus: see ver. 13. (4) By the utter psychological absurdity of such a supposition: that one just convinced of the presence of Him whom he deeply loved, should, instead of addressing Him, break out into an irrelevant cry. (5) By the further absurdity of supposing that<i> if such were</i> the case, the Apostle John, who of all the sacred writers most constantly keeps in mind the object for which he is writing, should have recorded any thing so<i> beside that object</i>. (6) By the intimate conjunction of the<i> seeing</i> and<i> believing</i> in our Lord’s answer, which necessarily makes this his saying the<i> expression of his belief</i>:—see below. Dismissing it therefore, we observe that this is<i> the highest confession of faith which has yet been made</i>;—and that it shews that (though not yet<i> fully</i>) the meaning of the previous confessions of His being ‘<i>the Son of God</i>’ was understood. Thus St. John, in the very close of his Gospel (see on vv. 30, 31) iterates the testimony with which he began it—to the Godhead of the Word who became flesh: and by this closing confession, shews how the testimony of Jesus to Himself had gradually deepened and exalted the Apostles’ conviction, from the time when they knew Him only as “<i>the Son of Joseph</i>” (ch. i. 46), till now, when He is acknowledged as their LORD and their GOD.<b> 29.</b>] The reason,<b> because thou hast seen me</b>, blames the slowness and required ground of the faith: the assertion,<b> thou hast believed</b>, recognizes and commends the soundness of that faith just confessed. Wonderful indeed, and rich in blessing for us who have not seen Him, is this, the closing word (see below) of the Gospel. For these words cannot apply to the<i> remaining Ten</i>: they, like<i> Thomas, had seen and believed</i>. ‘All the appearances of the forty days,’ says Stier, ‘were mere preparations for the believing without seeing.’<i> On the record of them</i>, we now believe: see 1 Pet. i. 8.
