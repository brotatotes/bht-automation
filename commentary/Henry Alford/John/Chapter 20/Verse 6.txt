The ardent and impetuous Peter goes directly in—John follows—and<i> believes</i>. What can exceed the inner truth of this description? And what is<i> not</i> related is as full of truth as that which is. For, vv. 6, 7, we seem to hear the very voice of Peter describing to his companion the inner state of the tomb.<br><br><b>seeth</b> represents the original word used of the cursory glance of John, who did not go in,—<b>beholdeth</b>, that which describes the exhaustive gaze of Peter, who did. Notice also that John, when he stooped and looked in, saw only the<i> linen clothes</i>, which seem to have been lying where the Feet were, nearer the entrance, whereas Peter, on going in, saw the<i> napkin</i>, which was perhaps deposited further in, near the place of the Head.
