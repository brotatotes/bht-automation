<p><strong> 8. </strong> <strong> ἐπίστευσεν</strong> ] Nothing is said of Peter did he <em> believe</em> too? I think <em> not;</em> and that John modestly suppresses it. But <em> what</em> did John believe? Was it merely, “corpus fuisse translatum, ut dixerat Maria?” (Bengel, so August., Erasm., Grot., Stier, Ebrard.) Surely not; the facts which he saw would prevent this conclusion: nor does John so use the word πιστεύειν . He believed <em> that Jesus was risen from the dead</em> . He received into his mind, embraced with his assent, THE FACT OF THE RESURRECTION, for the first time. He did this, on the <em> ocular testimony before him;</em> for as yet neither of them <em> knew the Scripture</em> , so as to be <em> à priori</em> convinced of the certainty that it would be so. But (see above) Peter does not seem to have as yet received this fact; accounting probably for what he saw as Mary had done. Lampe beautifully says “Concludimus, ab hoc momento in ipsis monumenti tenebris animum Joannis fide salvifica resurrectionis Jesu, tanquam novo quodam orti solis justitiæ radio, collustratum fuisse.”</p>
