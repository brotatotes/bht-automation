<b> 8. he saw, and believed</b>] Nothing is said of Peter—did he<i> believe</i> too? I think<i> not</i>;—and that John modestly suppresses it. But<i> what</i> did John believe? Was it merely,<i> that the Body had been taken away, as Mary had reported</i> (Bengel and others)? Surely not; the facts which he saw would prevent this conclusion: nor does John so use the word<b> believe</b>. He believed<i> that Jesus was risen from the dead</i>. He received into his mind, embraced with his assent, THE FACT OF THE RESURRECTION, for the first time. He did this, on the<i> ocular testimony before him</i>; for as yet neither of them<i> knew the Scripture</i>, so as to be previously convinced of the certainty that it would be so. But (see above) Peter does not seem to have as yet received this fact;—accounting probably for what he saw as Mary had done. Lampe beautifully says, ‘We conclude that from this moment, in the gloom of the sepulchre, the mind of John was enlightened by saving faith in the Resurrection of Jesus, as with a new ray of the risen Sun of Righteousness.’
