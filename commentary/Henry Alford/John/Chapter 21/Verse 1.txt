<b> 1.</b>]<b> After these things</b>, compare ch. v. 1; vi. 1,<b> at a subsequent time.</b><br><br><b> the sons of Zebedee</b> are<i> nowhere else named by John</i>;â€”they may however be here mentioned as in reminiscence of the<i> draught of fishes which</i><i> occurred before</i>: see Luke v. 1 ff.<b> two other of his disciples</b>] Who these were does not appear. Probably (as Luthardt) some two not named in the Gospel, and therefore not specified in its appendix.
