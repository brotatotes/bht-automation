<b> 1.</b>]<b> After these things</b>, compare ch. v. 1; vi. 1,<b> at a subsequent time.</b><br><br><b> manifested himself</b>] This expression is nowhere else used by St. John of the Lord’s appearances, but only in Mark xvi. 12, 14. The use of the verb here indicates that the usual state of the Lord at this time was one not of manifestation, but of invisibility to them.<br><br><b> the sons of Zebedee</b> are<i> nowhere else named by John</i>;—they may however be here mentioned as in reminiscence of the<i> draught of fishes which</i><i> occurred before</i>: see Luke v. 1 ff.<b> two other of his disciples</b>] Who these were does not appear. Probably (as Luthardt) some two not named in the Gospel, and therefore not specified in its appendix.
