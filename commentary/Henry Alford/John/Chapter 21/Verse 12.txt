 12.   ἀριστ  . ] Hereby is implied the  morning meal: see John 21:3-4 .
	 οὐδεὶς ἐτ  . ] I take these words to imply that they sat down to the meal in silence, wondering at, while at the same time they well knew, Him who was thus their Host. Chrys. says, οὐκέτι γὰρ τὴν αὐτὴν παῤῥησίαν εἶχον … ἀλλὰ μετὰ σιγῆς καὶ δεοῦς πολλοῦ καὶ αἰδοῦς ἐκαθέζοντο προσέχοντες πρὸς αὐτόν , … τὴν δὲ μορφὴν ἀλλοιοτέραν ὁρῶντες καὶ πολλῆς ἐκπλήξεως γέμουσαν , σφόδρα ἦσαν καταπεπληγμένοι , καὶ ἐβούλοντό τι περὶ αὐτῆς ἐρωτᾶν · ἀλλὰ τὸ δέος καὶ τὸ εἰδέναι αὐτοὺς ὅτι οὐχ ἕτερός τις ἦν ἀλλ ʼ αὐτός , ἐπεῖχον τὴν ἐρώτησιν . Hom. in Joann. lxxxvii. 2.
	 τολμᾶν and  ἐξετάζειν are  not elsewhere in John .
	 ἐξετάσαι  , more than ‘  ask: ’  to question or  prove Him.
	 ἐστίν again, after ἐτόλμα , in John’s manner.
