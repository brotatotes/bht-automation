<b> 12. Come and dine</b>] The word used implies the<i> morning meal</i>:—see ver. 3, 4.<br><br><b> none of the disciples durst ask him</b>] I take these words to imply that they sat down to the meal in silence,—wondering at, while at the same time they well knew, Him who was thus their Host. Chrysostom says, “for they no longer had their former confidence,.... but in silence and much fear and reverence they sat down, looking on Him:... seeing His form changed and very wonderful, they were much amazed, and wanted to ask Him respecting it, but their fear, and their knowledge that it was no other than He himself, hindered them.”<br><br> The verb rendered<b> ask</b> signifies more:—to<b> question</b> or<b> prove</b> Him.
