 14.   τοῦτο ἤδη τρίτον ] Compare τοῦτο [ δὲ ] πάλιν δεύτερον , ch. John 4:54 : and 2 Corinthians 13:1 . The number here is clearly not that of  all appearances of Jesus up to this time, for that to Mary Magdalen is not reckoned; but only those  to the disciples , i.e. any considerable number of them together. This one internal trait of consistency speaks much for the authenticity and genuineness of the addition.
	 ἐγερθείς ] The participle is not found elsewhere in John, but the participial construction is found in ch. John 4:54 .
	Without agreeing with all the allegorical interpretations of the Fathers, I cannot but see much depth and richness of meaning in this whole narrative. The Lord appears to His disciples, busied about their occupation for their, daily bread; speaks and acts in a manner wonderfully similar to His words and actions on a former memorable occasion, when we know that by their toiling long and taking nothing, but at his word enclosing a multitude of fishes, was set forth what should befall them as fishers of men. Can we miss that application at this far more important epoch of their apostolic mission? Besides, He graciously provides for their present wants, and invites them to be His guests: why, but to shew them that in their work hereafter they should never want but He would provide? And as connected with the parable, Matthew 13:47 ff., has the net  enclosing a great multitude and yet not broken , no meaning? Has the ‘taking the bread and giving to them, and the fish likewise’ no meaning, which so closely binds together the miraculous feeding, and the institution of the Lord’s Supper, with their future meetings in His Name and round His Table? Any one who recognizes the  teaching character of the acts of the Lord, can hardly cast all such applications from him; and those who do not, have yet the first rudiments of the Gospels to learn.
