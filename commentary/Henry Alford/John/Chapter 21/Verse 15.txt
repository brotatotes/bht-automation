<b> 15. So when they had dined</b>] There appears to have been nothing said during the meal. Surely every word would have been recorded. One great object of this appearance, observes Stier, certainly was the confirmation, and encouragement of the<i> ‘fisher of men</i>,’ in his apostolic office.<br><br><b> Simon son of Jonas</b>] A reminiscence probably of his own name and parentage, as distinguished from his apostolic name of honour, Cephas, or Peter, see ch. i. 43. Thus we have the same address, Matt. xvi. 17, connected with the mention of his natural state of flesh and blood, which had not revealed to him the great truth just confessed—and Luke xxii. 31, ‘Simon, Simon,’ when he is reminded of his natural weakness. See also Mark xiv. 37, and Matt. xvii. 25, where the significance is not so plain.<br><br><b> more than these</b>]<b> more than these thy fellow-disciples</b>, compare Matt. xxvi. 33; Mark xiv. 29, ‘Though<i> all</i> should be offended, yet not I.’ That St. John does not record this saying, makes no difficulty here; nor does it tell against the genuineness of this appendix to the Gospel. The narrator tells that which he heard the Lord say, and tells it faithfully and literally. That it coincides with what Peter is related to have said elsewhere, is a proof of the<i> authenticity</i>, not of the<i> connexion</i>, of the two accounts.<br><br> The word<b> these</b> has been strangely enough understood (Whitby, and others) of the<i> fish</i>, or the ‘employment and furniture of a fisherman.’—Olshausen sees a reference to the pre-eminence given to Peter, Matt. xvi. 19,—and regards the words as implying that on that account he really did love Jesus more than the rest;—but surely this is most improbable, and the other explanation the only likely or true one. Perhaps there is also a slight reference to his present just-shewn zeal, in leaping from the ship first to meet the Lord. ‘Has thy past conduct to Me truly borne out thy former and present warmth of love to Me above these thy fellows?’ “Wonderful is the wisdom of Christ, who in so few words makes Peter render account to Him whom He had denied, and to his brother-apostles, to whom he had made himself superior in love;—thus giving us an example for the exercise of church discipline.” Grotius.<br><br> Peter’s answer shews that he understood the question as above. He says nothing of the<b> more than these</b>—but dropping all comparison of himself with others, humbly refers to the Searcher of hearts the genuineness of his love, however the past may seem to have called it in question.<br><br> We may note that<i> two</i> Greek verbs, both signifying<b> to love</b>, are used in this conversation. The one (<i>agapain</i>) is applied to the ordinary love which men have to one another, or to the reverential love which is borne towards God and man by the child of God: the other (<i>philein</i>) to the closer love of a man for his own friend or his dearest relatives. The<i> former</i> word is used in ch. xi. 5, where it is said “Jesus<i> loved</i> Martha and her sister, and Lazarus:” the<i> latter</i> by the Jews in ch. xi. 37, when judging by the tears of Jesus for Lazarus, they exclaimed, “See how he<i> loved</i> him.” “Now in observing this conversation in the original, we notice, that the Lord’s<i> two</i><i> first</i> questions contain the former word, while Peter’s answers have the latter and warmer one:—whereas,<i> the third time</i> the question and answer both have the warmer word (<i>philein</i>). This does not look like accident. Peter in his two answers uses a less exalted word, and one implying a consciousness of his own weakness, but a persuasion and deep feeling of personal love. Then in the third question, the Lord adopts the word of Peter’s answer, the closer to press the meaning of it home to him. The answer,<b> thou knowest</b>, the<i> two first</i> times, seems to refer to the Lord’s<i> personal</i> knowledge of Peter’s heart—in His having given him that name, ch. i. 43, Matt. xvi. 17; Luke xxii. 31, and the announcement of his denial of Him. The<i> last</i> time, he widens this assertion ‘Thou knowest<i> me</i>,’ into ‘Thou knowest<i> all things</i>,’ being grieved at the repetition of a question which brought this Omniscience so painfully to his mind.<br><br><b> Feed my lambs</b>] This, and the following answers of the Lord, can hardly be regarded as the<i> reinstating</i> of Peter in his apostolic office, for there is no record of his ever having lost it: but as a further and higher setting forth of it than that first one, Matt. iv. 18 ff.—both as belonging to all of them on the present occasion, and as tending to comfort Peter’s own mind after his fall, and reassure him of his holding the same place among the Apostles as before, owing to the gracious forgiveness of his Lord.<br><br> Our Lord’s three injunctions differ in their mode of expression. The first is,<b> Feed my lambs</b>. ‘The second,<b> Keep, tend</b>, or<b> shepherd</b> (the same word is used in Acts xx. 28: 1 Pet. v. 2)<b> my sheep</b>. The third,<b> Feed my sheep</b>, but with this difference, that the word<b> sheep</b> is the diminutive, expressive of affection. Perhaps the<i> feeding of the lambs</i> was the furnishing the apostolic testimony of the Resurrection, and facts of the Lord’s life on earth, to the first converts; the<i> shepherding</i> or ruling<i> the sheep</i>, the subsequent government of the Church, as shewn forth in the early part of the Acts: the<i> feeding of the</i> sheep (diminutive, the choicest, the loved of the flock), the furnishing the now maturer Church of Christ with the wholesome food of the doctrine contained in his Epistles. The notice of these distinctions, which only the cold and undiscerning will attempt to deny, may serve to shew the English reader, how entirely inadequate even the best version must be to represent the sense of Holy Scripture. For our language is quite unable to express its minute beauties and differences. But those must strangely miss the whole sense, who dream of an exclusive primatial power here granted or confirmed to this Apostle. A sufficient refutation of this silly idea, if it needed any other than the fact, that Peter<i> was grieved</i> at the question leading to the commission, is found in the “<i>fellow-elder</i>” (so in the original) of 1 Pet. v. 1, where he refers apparently to this very charge; see note on Matt. xvi. 17 ff.
