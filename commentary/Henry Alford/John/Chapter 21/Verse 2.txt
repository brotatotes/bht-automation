<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] Nathanael is named <em> by John only</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:46">John 1:46</span> ff.: Thomas also <em> by John only</em> , except in the catalogues of the Apostles.
	</p>
<p>The junction of ἀπό with a proper name is in John’s style: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:45">John 1:45</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:1">John 11:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:38">John 19:38</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> οἱ τοῦ Ζεβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> are <em> no where else named by John;</em> they may however be here mentioned as in reminiscence of the <em> draught of fishes which occurred before:</em> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1">Luke 5:1</span> ff.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐκ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> μαθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ δύο</strong> ] The same words occur ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:35">John 1:35</span> , with reference to John the Baptist. Who these were does not appear. Probably (as Luthardt) some two not named in the Gospel, and therefore not specified in its appendix.</p>
