<b> 20.</b>] The details necessary to complete the narrative are obscure, and only hinted at in the background. It seems that Peter either was at the time of the foregoing conversation walking with Jesus, and turned round and saw John following,—or that he moved towards Him on the termination of it (but certainly not from a misunderstanding of the words “<i>Follow Me</i>,” see ver. 21). I can hardly conceive Him<i> moving away</i> on uttering these words, and summoning Peter away in private. It seems in the highest degree unnatural. This description and identification of the disciple whom Jesus loved is evidently inserted to justify his following, and is a strong token of St. John’s hand having written this chapter; see ch. xiii. 23.
