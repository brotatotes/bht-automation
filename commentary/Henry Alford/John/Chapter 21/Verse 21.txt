<b> 21.</b>] Peter’s question shews that. he had rightly understood the Lord’s prophecy respecting him. He now wishes to know what should befall his friend and colleague,— “giving him a return (for<i> his</i> similar service in ch. xiii. 23 just referred to), and, in the idea that he too might be desirous to ask about himself, but might. lack the courage, Peter took up the enquiry.” Chrysostom. This was not mere<i> idle</i> curiosity, but that longing which we all feel for our friends. “Is<i> he</i> not to follow Thee too? is<i> he</i> not to go the same way of death with us?” Euthymius.
