<b> 22.</b>] The words<b> what is that to thee?</b> imply a rebuke;—not perhaps however so sharp a one as has been sometimes seen in them. They remind Peter of the distinctness of each man’s position and duty before the Lord; and the subsequent command,<b> follow thou Me</b>, directs his view along that course of duty and suffering, which was appointed for him by his divine Master. In the original, both<i> thou</i> and<i> Me</i> are in emphatic positions: “<i>His</i> appointed lot is no element in<i> thy</i> onward course: it is ME that<i> thou</i> must follow.”<br><br> On the words,<b> if I will that he tarry till I come....</b>, three opinions have been held (for that which refers the words to John’s remaining where he then was, on the shore, till the Lord returned from His colloquy with Peter, is not worth more than cursory mention): (1) that of Augustine and others (it being allowed on all hands, that<b> to tarry</b> means<b> to remain in this life</b>: see<b> abideth</b> (<i>the same word in the original</i>), ch. xii. 34), ‘If I will that he remain till I fetch him,’ i.e. by a<i> natural death</i>. But this is frigid, and besides inapplicable here. Peter’s death, although by the hands of another, was just as much the Lord’s ‘<i>coming for him</i>,’ as John’s, and there would thus be no contrast. (2) That that ‘coming of the Lord’ is meant, which is so often in the three Gospels alluded to (see especially notes on Matt. xxiv.), viz. the establishment in full of the dispensation of the Kingdom by the destruction of the nation and temple of the Jews, This is the view of some mentioned by Theophylact, of Bengel, and others,—and is upheld by the similar place, Matt. xvi. 28. (3) That the Lord here puts a case only,— ‘Even should I will that he remain upon earth till My last coming—what would that be to thee?’ This view is upheld by Trench; but I think must be rejected on maturer consideration of the character of the words of our Lord, in whose mouth such a mere hypothetical saying would be strangely incongruous, especially in these last solemn days of His presence on earth.<br><br> The second view seems then to remain, and I adopt it with some qualification. At the destruction of Jerusalem began that mighty series of events of which the Apocalypse is the prophetic record, and which is in the complex known as the ‘COMING OF THE LORD,’ ending, as it shall, with His glorious and personal Advent. This the beloved Apostle alone lived to see, according to ancient and undoubted tradition.
