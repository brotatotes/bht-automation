<b> 25.</b>] The purpose of this verse seems to he to assert and vindicate the fragmentary character of the Gospel, considered merely as an historical narrative:—for that the doings of the Lord were so many,—His life so rich in matter of record,—that in a popular hyperbole, we can hardly imagine the world containing them all, if singly written down; thus setting forth the superfluity and cumbrousness of any thing like a perfect detail, in the strongest terms,—and in terms which certainly look as if fault had been found with this Gospel for want of completeness, by some objectors.
