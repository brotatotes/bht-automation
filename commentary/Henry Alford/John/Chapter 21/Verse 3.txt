The correspondence of this account with that is very remarkable—as is also their entire distinctness in the midst of that correspondence. The disciples must have been powerfully reminded of that their former and probably last fishing together. And after the “<i>fishers of men</i>” of that other occasion, the whole could not but bear to them a spiritual meaning in reference to their apostolic commission:—their powerlessness without Christ,—their success when they let down the net at His word. Their present part was not to go fishing of themselves, but “<i>to wait for the promise of the Father,</i>” Acts i. 4 (Luthardt).
