 1. ] We have in the Talmud (see Lightfoot, Hor. Heb. in loc.) a Nicodemus ben Gorion, who was properly called Bonai, and said to have been a disciple of Jesus: but he is found living at the destruction of Jerusalem. This might certainly have been; still it must be quite uncertain whether he be the same with this Nicodemus.
	He is mentioned again ch. John 7:50 ; John 19:39 . He was a member of the Sanhedrim (  ἄρχων  , see reff.), and, besides, a νομοδιδάσκαλος ( Joh 3:10 ).
