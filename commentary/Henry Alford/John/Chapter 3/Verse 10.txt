 10. ] I believe the E. V. is right in rendering  ὁ διδ  .  a master; the article is inserted as required by τοῦ before Ἰσραήλ , which is expressed as giving a solemnity to Ἰσρ . as the people of God. Or is it possible that ὁ διδάσκαλος may merely be meant as  one of οἱ διδάσκαλοι ? I prefer either of these reasons for the presence of the article, to supposing it to have any emphatic meaning. Nicodemus was manifestly in no supereminent place among the ἄρχοντες : see ch. John 7:50-52 . Still less can I with Bp. Middleton, Gr. Art. pp. 242 3, believe any  blame conveyed in the title . [Dean Alford afterwards preferred rendering ὁ διδάσκαλος  the teacher; see N.T. for English Readers, and N.T. Authorized Version Revised.]
