<b> 12.]</b> The words<b> receive our testimony</b> prepared the way for the new idea which is brought forward in this verse—<b>believing</b>, Faith is, in the most pregnant sense, ‘the receiving of testimony;” because it is the making<i> subjectively real</i> the contents of that testimony. So the<b> believing in him</b> (see ver. 15) is,<i> the full reception of the Lord’s testimony</i>; because the burden of that testimony is,<i> grace and truth and salvation by Himself</i>. This faith is neither reasoning, nor knowledge, but a<i> reception</i> of divine Truth declared by One who came from God; and so it is<i> far above</i> reasoning and knowledge:—<b>we believe</b> above<b> we know</b>.<br><br> But what are the<b> earthly things</b>? The matters relating to the new birth which have hitherto been spoken of;—called so because<i> that side of them</i> has been exhibited which is<i> upon earth</i>, and happens among men. That the<i> parable about the wind</i> is not intended, is evident from “<i>and ye</i><b> believe</b><i> not</i>,” which in that case would be ‘ye<i> understand</i> not.’ And the<b> heavenly things</b> are the things of which the discourse goes on to treat<i> from this point</i>: viz. the<i> heavenly side</i> of the new birth and salvation of man, in the eternal counsels of God regarding His only-begotten Son.<br><br> Stier supposes a reference in this verse to Wisd. ix. 16, “Hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon the earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out?”
