<b> 12.]</b> The words<b> receive our testimony</b> prepared the way for the new idea which is brought forward in this verse—<b>believing</b>, Faith is, in the most pregnant sense, ‘the receiving of testimony;” because it is the making<i> subjectively real</i> the contents of that testimony. So the<b> believing in him</b> (see ver. 15) is,<i> the full reception of the Lord’s testimony</i>; because the burden of that testimony is,<i> grace and truth and salvation by Himself</i>. This faith is neither reasoning, nor knowledge, but a<i> reception</i> of divine Truth declared by One who came from God; and so it is<i> far above</i> reasoning and knowledge:—<b>we believe</b> above<b> we know</b>.
