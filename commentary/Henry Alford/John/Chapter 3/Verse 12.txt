 12. ] The words  μαρτυρίαν λαμβάνειν prepared the way for the new idea which is brought forward in this verse  πιστεύειν  . Faith is, in the most pregnant sense, ‘the receiving of testimony;’ because it is the making  subjectively real the contents of that testimony. So the πιστεύειν  εἰς αὐτόν [see Joh 3:15 ] is,  the full reception of the Lord’s testimony; because the burden of that testimony is,  grace and truth and salvation by Himself . This faith is neither reasoning, nor knowledge, but a  reception of divine Truth declared by One who came from God; and so it is  far above reasoning and knowledge:  πιστεύομεν above  οἴδαμεν  .

The matters relating to the new birth which have hitherto been spoken of; called so because  that side of them has been exhibited which is  upon earth , and happens among men; ἃ τοῖς ἐπὶ γῆς ἔτι διατρίβουσιν ἀνθρώποις δυνατὰ ὑπάρξαι τε καὶ νοηθῆναι , Origen. That the  parable about the wind is not intended, is evident from κ . οὐ  πιστεύετε  , which in that case would be ‘do not  understand .’ And the  ἐπουράνια are the things of which the discourse goes on to treat  from this point: viz. the  heavenly side of the new birth and salvation of man, in the eternal counsels of God regarding His only-begotten Son.
	Stier supposes a reference in this verse to Wis 9:16 , καὶ μόλις εἰκάζομεν τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς , καὶ τὰ ἐν χερσὶν εὑρίσκομεν μετὰ πόνου , τὰ δὲ ἐν οὐρανοῖς τίς ἐξιχνίασεν ;
