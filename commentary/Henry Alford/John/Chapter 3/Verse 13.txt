<b> 13.]</b> The whole verse seems to have intimate connexion with and reference to Prov. xxx. 4, “Who hath ascended up to heaven, or descended?” and as spoken to a learned doctor of the law, would recall that verse,—especially as the further question is there asked, ‘Who hath gathered<i> the wind</i> in His fists?’ and ‘What is His name, and what His Son’s name?’ See also Deut. xxx. 12, and the citation, Rom. x. 6–8.<br><br> All attempts to explain away the plain sense of this verse are futile and ridiculous. The Son of Man, the Lord Jesus, the Word made Flesh,<i> was in, came down from</i>, heaven,—and was<i> in heaven</i> (heaven about Him, heaven dwelling on earth, ch. i. 52),<i> while here</i>, and ascended up into heaven when He left this earth;—and by all these proofs, speaking in the prophetic language of accomplished Redemption, does the Lord establish, that<i> He alone</i> can speak of<i> heavenly things</i> to men, or convey the blessing of the new birth to them. Be it remembered, that He is here speaking<i> by anticipation,</i> of<i> results</i> of His course and sufferings on earth,—of the way of’ regeneration and salvation which God has appointed by Him. He regards therefore throughout the passage, the great facts of redemption<i> as accomplished</i>, and makes announcements which could not be literally acted upon till they had been so accomplished. See vv. 14 ff., whose sense will be altogether lost, unless this<b> hath ascended up</b> be understood of His exaltation to be a Prince and a Saviour.<br><br><b> which is in heaven]</b> See ch. i. 18 and note. Doubtless the meaning involves ‘<i>whose place is in heaven</i>;’ but it also asserts the<b> being in heaven</b> of the<i> time then present</i>: see ch. i. 52. Thus majestically does the Lord characterize His whole life of humiliation in the flesh, between His descent and His ascent. As uniting in Himself God, whose dwelling is Heaven, with man, whose dwelling is on earth, He ever was in heaven. And nearly connected with this fact is the transition to His being the fountain of eternal life, in vv. 14 ff: cf. 1 Cor. xv. 47–50, where the same connexion is strikingly set forth.<br><br> To explain such expressions as “<i>to ascend up into heaven</i>,”&c., as mere<i> Hebrew metaphors</i> (Lücke, De Wette, &c.) is no more than saying that Hebrew metaphors were founded on deep insight into divine truth:—these words in fact express<i> the truths on which Hebrew metaphors were constructed</i>. Socinus is quite right, when he says that<i> those who take</i> ‘hath ascended up into heaven’<i> metaphorically, must in all consistency take</i> ‘he that came down from heaven’<i> metaphorically also</i>; “the descent and ascent must be both of the same kind.”
