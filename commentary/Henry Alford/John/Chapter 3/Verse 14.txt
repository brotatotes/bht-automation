<b> 14.]</b> From this point the discourse passes to the<i> Person</i> of Christ, and Redemption by His Death.<br><br> The Lord brings before this doctor of the Law the mention of Moses, who in his day by divine command lifted up a symbol of forgiveness and redemption to Israel.<br><br> In interpreting this comparison, we must avoid all such ideas as that our Lord<i> merely compares</i> His death to the elevation of the brazen serpent, as if only a<i> fortuitous likeness</i> were laid hold of by Him. This would leave the<i> brazen serpent itself meaningless</i>, and is an explanation which can only satisfy those who do not discern the typical reference of all the ceremonial dispensation to the Redeemer.<br><br> It is an important duty of an expositor here, to defend the obvious and only honest explanation of this comparison against the tortuous and inadequate interpretations of modern critics. The comparison lies between the<i> exalted serpent of brass</i>, and the<i> exalted Son of Man. The brazen serpent</i> sets forth<i> the Redeemer</i>. This by recent commentators (Lücke, De Wette, and others) is considered impossible: and the<i> thing compared</i> is held to be only ‘the lifting up.’ But this does not satisfy the construction of the comparison. ‘The brazen serpent was lifted up: every one who looked on it, lived;’ this sentence, in its terms, represents. this other,— ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up: every one who believes on Him, shall live.’ The<i> same thing</i> is predicated of the two;—both are lifted up; cognate consequences follow,—<i>body-healing</i> and<i> soul-healing</i> (as Erskine, On the Brazen Serpent). There must then be<i> some reason</i> why the<i> only two members of the comparison yet unaccounted for</i> stand where they do,—considering that the brazen serpent was lifted up not for any physical efficacy, but by command of God alone.<i> Now on examination we find this correspondence fully established</i>. The ‘serpent’ is in Scripture symbolism,<i> the devil</i>,—from the historical temptation in Gen. iii. downwards. But<i> why</i> is the devil set forth by the<i> serpent</i>? How does the bite of the serpent operate? It<i> pervades with its poison the frame of its victim</i>: that frame<i> becomes poisoned</i>:—and<i> death ensues</i>. So sin,<i> the poison of the devil</i>, being instilled into our nature, that nature has become a<i> poisoned nature</i>,—a<i> flesh of sin</i> (see Rom. viii. 3). Now the brazen serpent was made<i> in the likeness of the serpents</i> which had bitten the children of Israel. It<i> represented to them the poison</i> which had gone through their frames, and it was hung up there, on the banner-staff, as a trophy, to shew them that<i> for the poison, there was healing</i>;—that the plague had been overcome. In<i> it</i>, there was<i> no poison</i>; only the<i> likeness</i> of it. Now was not the Lord Jesus made<i> in the likeness of the flesh of sin</i>, Rom. viii. 3? Was not He made ‘<i>Sin for us, who knew no sin’</i> (2 Cor. v. 21)?<br><br> Did not He, on His Cross, make an open shew of, and triumph over, the Enemy, so that it was<i> as if the Enemy himself had been nailed to that Cross</i> (Col. ii. 15)? Were not Sin and Death and Satan crucified, when<i> He was crucified</i>? “In that case, since the injury was by the serpent, by the serpent was also the cure: and in this, since by man death came into the world, by man entered life also.” Euthymius.<br><br><b> must the Son of man be lifted up: i.e. it is necessary</b>, in the Father’s counsel—it is decreed, but not arbitrarily;—the very necessity of things, which is in fact but the evolution of the divine Will, made it requisite that the pure and sinless Son of Man should thus be uplifted and suffer; see Luke xxiv. 26.<br><br> In the word<b> lifted up</b> there is more than the mere crucifixion. It has respect in its double meaning (of which see a remarkable instance in Gen. xl. 13, 19) to the exaltation of the Lord on the Cross, and through the Cross to His Kingdom; and refers back to “<i>hath ascended up into heaven</i>” before.
