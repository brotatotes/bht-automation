<b> 15.]</b> The corresponding clause applying to the type is left to be supplied— ‘And as every one who looked on it was healed, so....’<br><br><b> believeth in him]</b> This expression, here only used by John,<i> implies his exaltation</i>,—see ch. xii. 32. It is<i> a belief in</i> (<i>abiding in</i>, see note on ver. 18)<i> His Person being what God by his sufferings and exaltation hath made Him to be, and being that</i> TO ME. This involves, on the part of the believer, the anguish of the bite of the fiery serpent,—and the earnest looking on Him in Whom sin is crucified, with the inner eye of faith.<br><br><b> have eternal life]</b> Just as in the type, God did not remove the fiery serpents,—or not all at once,—but healing was to be found in the midst of them by looking to the brazen serpent ( ‘every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it<b> shall live</b>,’ Num. xxi. 8),—so the temptations and conflicts of sin shall not<i> leave</i> the believer,—but<i> in the midst of these</i>, with the Eye of Faith fixed on the uplifted Son of Man, he<i> has eternal life</i>; perishes not of the bite, but<b> shall live</b>.<br><br> See on this verse the remarkable passage, Wisd. xvi. 5–13, where as much of the healing sign is opened as could be expected before the great Antitype Himselfappeared.
