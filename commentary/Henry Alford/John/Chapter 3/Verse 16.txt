<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] Many Commentators since the time of Erasmus, who first suggested the notion have maintained <em> that the discourse of our Lord breaks off here</em> , and the rest, to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:21">John 3:21</span> , consists of the remarks of the Evangelist. (So Tholuck, Olshausen, Lücke, De Wette; which last attributes Joh 3:13-14 also to John.) But to those who view these discourses of our Lord as intimately connected <em> wholes</em> , this will be as inconceivable, as the idea of St. Matthew having combined into one the insulated sayings of his Master. This discourse would be altogether fragmentary, and would have left Nicodemus <em> almost where he was before</em> , had not this most weighty concluding part been also spoken to him. This it is, which expands and explains the assertions of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14-15">John 3:14-15</span> , and applies them to the present life and conduct of mankind.
	</p>
<p>The principal grounds alleged for supposing the discourse to break off here seem to be ( α ) <em> that all allusion to Nicodemus is henceforth dropped</em> .
	</p>
<p>But this is not conclusive, for it is obvious that the natural progress of such an interview on his part would be <em> from questioning to listening:</em> and that even had he joined in the dialogue, the Evangelist would not have been bound to relate all his remarks, but only those which, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:4">John 3:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:9">John 3:9</span> , were important to bring out his mind and standing-point. ( β ) <em> That</em> <em> henceforth past tenses are used;</em> making it more probable that the passage was added after the great events alluded to had taken place. But does not our Lord speak here, as in so many other cases, <em> proleptically</em> , of the fulness of the accomplishment of those designs, which <em> in the divine counsels were</em> accomplished? Is not this way of speaking natural to a discourse which is treating of the <em> development</em> of the new birth, itself not yet brought in till the Spirit was given? See a parallel instance, with the Evangelist’s explanation, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37-39">John 7:37-39</span> . ( γ ) <em> On account of this use of</em> <strong> μονογενής</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span> , which is peculiar to John. But, as Stier well enquires (iv. 84, edn. 2), <em> whence did John get this word</em> , but from the lips of his Divine Master? Would he have ventured on such an expression, except by an authorization from Him? ( δ ) <em> It is asserted that John often continues our Lord’s discourses with additions of his own;</em> and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31">John 3:31</span> , and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span> , are alleged as instances. Of these, ch. Joh 1:16 is <em> beside the question;</em> for the whole prologue is spoken in the person of the Evangelist, and the Baptist’s testimony in Joh 3:15 is merely confirmatory of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span> , and then the connexion goes on with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span> . On the untenableness of the view with regard to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31">John 3:31</span> ff., see notes there.
	</p>
<p>It would besides give us a very mean idea of the honesty or reverence of one who sets forth so sublime a view of the Divinity and Authority of our Lord, to suppose him capable, <em> in any place</em> , of attributing to his Master words and sentiments of his own invention. And that the charge amounts to this, every simple reader can bear testimony. The obvious <em> intention</em> of the Evangelist here is, <em> that the Lord shall have said these words</em> . If our Lord did not say them, but the Evangelist, we cannot stop with the view that he has <em> added his own remarks</em> to our Lord’s discourse, but must at once pronounce him <em> guilty of an imposture and a forgery</em> . (See Stier, iv. 81 ff., edn. 2.) I conclude therefore on all these grounds that the words following, to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:21">John 3:21</span> , cannot be otherwise regarded than as <em> uttered by our Lord in continuation of His discourse</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἠγάπησεν</strong> ] The indefinite signifying the universal and eternal existence of that love which God Himself <em> is</em> ( 1Jn 4:8 ).
	</p>
<p><strong> τὸν κόσμον</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <strong> the world</strong> , in the most general sense, as represented by, and included in, man, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:17-18">Genesis 3:17-18</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:28">Genesis 1:28</span> ; not, <em> the elect</em> , which would utterly destroy the force of the passage: see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span> .
	</p>
<p>The Lord here reveals <em> Love</em> as the <em> one ground of the divine counsel</em> in redemption, <em> salvation</em> of men, as its <em> one purpose with regard to them</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τὸν υἱὸν</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ἔδωκεν</strong> ] These words, whether spoken in Hebrew or in Greek, seem to carry a reference to the offering of Isaac; and Nicodemus in that case would at once be reminded by them of the love <em> there required</em> , the <em> substitution there made</em> , and the <em> prophecy there uttered</em> to Abraham, to which <strong> ἵνα πᾶς ὁ πιστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> so nearly corresponds.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἔδωκεν</strong> absolute, not merely τῷ κόσμῳ <strong> gave up,</strong> παρέδωκεν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:32">Romans 8:32</span> ; where as Stier remarks, we have again, in the οὐκ ἐφείσατο , an unmistakeable allusion to the οὐκ ἐφείσω , said to Abraham, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:16">Genesis 22:16</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἵνα</strong> <strong> …</strong> ] By the repetition of this final clause verbatim from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:15">John 3:15</span> , we have the identity of the former clauses established: i.e. the uplifting of the Son of Man like the serpent in the wilderness <em> is</em> the manifestation of the Divine Love in the gift of the Son of God: ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span> , = in the strictest sense, ὁ υἱὸς αὐτ . ὁ μονογ . of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span> .</p>
