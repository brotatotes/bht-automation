<b> 17.] the world</b>,—the Gentile world,—was according to Jewish ideas to be judged and condemned by the Messiah. This error our Lord here removes. The assertion ch. ix. 39, “<i>for judgment</i> (or,<i> condemnation</i>)<i> came I into this world</i>,” is no contradiction to this. The judgment there, as here, results from the separation of mankind into two classes,—those who will and those who will not come to the light; and that result itself is not the<i> purpose why</i> the Son of God came into the world, but is evolved in the accomplishment of the higher purpose, viz. Love, and the salvation of men. Observe, the latter clause does not correspond to the former—it is not<i> that He might save the world</i>, but<b> that the world through Him might be saved</b>:—the<i> free will</i> of the<i> world</i> is by this strikingly set forth, in connexion with verses 19, 20. Not that the Lord is not the<i> Saviour of the world</i> (ch. iv. 42), but that the peculiar cast of this passage required the other side of the truth to be brought out.
