 18. ] On  πιστ  .   εἰς αὐτ  . (which is John’s usual phrase) the remarks above on Joh 3:15 apply with little distinction; εἰς giving more the  direction of the belief  towards , and its  resting upon , ἐν its  abiding in , Jesus as the Saviour.
	 οὐ κρίνεται ] See ch. John 5:24 , where the same assertion is made more fully; and note there.
	 ἤδη κέκριται  , implying,  by no positive act of judgment of mine , but by the very nature of things themselves. God has provided a remedy for the deadly bite of sin; this remedy the man has not accepted, not  taken: he must then perish in his sins: he is  already judged and sentenced .
	 μὴ πεπίστευκεν ] The perfect implies more than ‘that faith is a definite act in time’ (Lücke, De Wette); it sets before us the deliberate choice of the man, q. d. ‘he hath not chosen to believe’ (Lange, in Stier, iv. 93, edn. 2): see 2 Thessalonians 2:11-12 .
	 εἰς τὸ ὄν  ., not without meaning: that name was Ἰησοῦς , αὐτὸς γὰρ σώσει τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν , Matthew 1:21 .
	The  μονογενοῦς also here sets before us the  hopelessness of such a man’s state: he has no  other Saviour.
