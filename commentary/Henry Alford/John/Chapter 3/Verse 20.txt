<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] This verse analyses the psychological grounds of the preceding. The φῶς is not here ‘the common light of day,’ nor light in general: but as before, <strong> the Light;</strong> i.e. <em> the Lord Jesus</em> , and His salvation: see Joh 3:21 fin.

<p>There is here a difference between φαῦλα <strong> πράσσειν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and <strong> ποιεῖν</strong> τὴν ἀλήθειαν , which is too remarkable to be passed over, especially as the same distinction is observed in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span> , οἱ τὰ <strong> ἀγαθὰ ποιήσαντες</strong> εἰς ἀνάστασιν ζωῆς , οἱ δὲ τὰ <strong> φαῦλα πράξαντες</strong> εἰς ἀν . κρίσεως . Bengel, who noticed this, hardly I think gives the right reason for it: “malitia est <em> irrequieta</em> , est quiddam operosius quam veritas;” nor does Stier fully reach it, “that πράσ . signifies more a subordination, a being the <em> servants</em> of sin, ἐργάται ἀδικίας , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:27">Luke 13:27</span> .” I think the distinction is rather perhaps this, that πράσσειν is more the <em> habit of action;</em> so that we might say ‘ <em> he that practises evil;</em> ’ but ποιεῖν the true <em> doing</em> of good, <em> good fruit</em> , good that <em> remains</em> . He who <strong> πράσσει</strong> <strong> ,</strong> has nothing but his πρᾶγμα , which is an event, a thing of the past, a source to him only of condemnation, for he has nothing to shew for it, for it is also φαῦλον , worthless; whereas he that <strong> ποιεῖ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> has his ποίημα , he has abiding fruit; <em> his works do follow him</em> . So that the expressions will not perhaps here admit of being interchanged. (See however <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:15-20">Romans 7:15-20</span> , where the two verbs are certainly interchanged more than once.) There may possibly be a hint [in the mention of σκότος Joh 3:19 ] at the <em> coming by night</em> of Nicodemus, but surely only by a distant implication. He might gather this from what was said, that it would have been better for him to make open confession of Jesus; but we can hardly say that our Lord reproves him for coming even as he did.</p>
