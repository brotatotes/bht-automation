<b> 20.]</b> This verse analyzes the psychological grounds of the preceding. The<i> light</i> is not here ‘the common light of day,’ nor light in general: but, as before,<b> the Light</b>; i.e.<i> the Lord Jesus</i>, and His salvation: see ver. 21 end.<br><br> There is here a difference between the verbs used in the original in the expressions<b> doeth evil</b> and<b> doeth the truth</b>, which is too remarkable to be passed over,—especially as the same distinction is observed in ch. v. 29. I think the distinction is perhaps this,—that the first verb represents more the<i> habit of action</i>; so that we might say ‘<i>he that practises evil</i>;’ but the second the true<i> doing</i> of good, good<i> fruit</i>, good that<i> remains</i>. He who<i> practises</i>, has nothing but his<i> practice</i>, which is an event, a thing of the past, a source to him only of condemnation; he has nothing to shew for it, for it is also empty, worthless (which is the real primitive meaning of the adjective here rendered “<i>evil</i>”); whereas he that<b> does, makes, creates</b> (for this is the force of the second verb), has his<b> deed</b>, or<b> thing made</b>,—he has abiding fruit;<i> his works do follow him</i>. So that the expressions will not perhaps here admit of being interchanged. In the allusion to<i> darkness</i>, there may possibly be a hint at the<i> coming by night</i> of Nicodemus, but surely only by a distant implication. He might gather this from what was said, that it would have been better for him to make open confession of Jesus; but we can hardly say that our Lord reproves him for coming even as he did.
