 20. ] This verse analyses the psychological grounds of the preceding. The φῶς is not here ‘the common light of day,’ nor light in general: but as before,  the Light; i.e.  the Lord Jesus , and His salvation: see Joh 3:21 fin.
	There is here a difference between φαῦλα  πράσσειν  , and  ποιεῖν τὴν ἀλήθειαν , which is too remarkable to be passed over, especially as the same distinction is observed in ch. John 5:29 , οἱ τὰ  ἀγαθὰ ποιήσαντες εἰς ἀνάστασιν ζωῆς , οἱ δὲ τὰ  φαῦλα πράξαντες εἰς ἀν . κρίσεως . Bengel, who noticed this, hardly I think gives the right reason for it: “malitia est  irrequieta , est quiddam operosius quam veritas;” nor does Stier fully reach it, “that πράσ . signifies more a subordination, a being the  servants of sin, ἐργάται ἀδικίας , Luke 13:27 .” I think the distinction is rather perhaps this, that πράσσειν is more the  habit of action; so that we might say ‘  he that practises evil; ’ but ποιεῖν the true  doing of good,  good fruit , good that  remains . He who  πράσσει  , has nothing but his πρᾶγμα , which is an event, a thing of the past, a source to him only of condemnation, for he has nothing to shew for it, for it is also φαῦλον , worthless; whereas he that  ποιεῖ  , has his ποίημα , he has abiding fruit;  his works do follow him . So that the expressions will not perhaps here admit of being interchanged. (See however Romans 7:15-20 , where the two verbs are certainly interchanged more than once.) There may possibly be a hint [in the mention of σκότος Joh 3:19 ] at the  coming by night of Nicodemus, but surely only by a distant implication. He might gather this from what was said, that it would have been better for him to make open confession of Jesus; but we can hardly say that our Lord reproves him for coming even as he did.
