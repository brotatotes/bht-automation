<b> 21.]</b> Who is this<i> doer of the truth</i>? the end of ch. i. will best explain to us,—<i>in whom there is no guile</i>, see also Luke viii. 15, and Ps. xv. The<i> practiser of wickedness</i> is crooked and perverse; he has a light, which he does not follow; he knows the light, and avoids it; and so there is no truth, singleness, in him; he is a man at variance with himself. But the simple and single-minded is he who knowing and approving the light, comes to it; and comes that he may be carried onward in this spirit of truth and single-mindedness to higher degrees of communion with and likeness to God. “The good man seeks the light, and to place his works in the light, not from a vain love of praise, but from a desire for communion wherein he finds strength and security,” De Wette. But this is not all: the<i> manifesting his works, that they are wrought in God</i>, is and can be only by the candle of the Lord being kindled within him, and he himself born again in the Kingdom of God; see Ps. cxxxix. 23, 24.
