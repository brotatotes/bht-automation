<b> 23.]</b> The situation of these places is uncertain, Eusebius and Jerome place Salim eight Roman miles south of Scythopolis, and Ænon at the same distance, on the Jordan. If Scythopolis was the ancient Bethshan, both places were in<i> Samaria</i>: and to this agree Epiphanius, and the Samaritan chronicle called Abul Phatach. In Judith iv. 4, we find mention of “<i>the valley of Salem</i>” in Samaria (see note on Heb. vii. 1). An Ænon in the wilderness of Judah is mentioned Josh. xv. 61 (in the Alexandrine text of the LXX, not in our English Bible) and ib. ver. 32, Shilhim (Seleem, LXX) and Ain, both in Judah, where it is certainly more probable, both from the text here and from other considerations, that John would have been baptizing, than in Samaria. The name Ænon is an intensitive form of<i> Ain</i>, a fountain, which answers to the description here given. Both places were West of the Jordan: see ver. 26, and compare ch. i. 28.
