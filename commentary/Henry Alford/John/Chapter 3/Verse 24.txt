<b> 24]</b> There is much difficulty, which probably never will be cleared up, about the<i> date of the imprisonment</i> of John, and its reference to the course of our Lord’s ministry. Between Matt. iv. 11, 12, there seems to be a wide hiatus, in which (see note there) the first chapters of this Gospel should be inserted. But the records from which the three Gospels have arisen were apparently unconscious of any such interval. Our Evangelist seems here to refer to such records, and to insert this remark, that it might not be imagined, as it would be from them, that our Lord’s public ministry (in the wider sense, sec below on ver. 26) began with the imprisonment of the Baptist.
