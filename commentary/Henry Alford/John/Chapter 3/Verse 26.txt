The baptism now carried on by the disciples appears to have stood very much in the same position as that of John. It was preparatory to the<i> public ministry</i> of our Lord<i> properly so called</i>, which began in Galilee after the imprisonment of John. It was<i> not accompanied with the gift of the Spirit</i>, see ch. vii. 39. As John’s commission was now on the wane, so our Lord’s was expanding. The solemn cleansing of the temple was its opening; and now it is proceeding onwards, gathering multitudes around it (see ch. iv. 1).
