<p><strong> 28.</strong> ] ‘Not only so, but I have always given the same consistent testimony; that I was only the forerunner of One greater than myself.’ <strong> ἐκείνου</strong> does not refer to ὁ χριστός , in which case it would have been αὐτοῦ (see, however, apparent exceptions to this, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:45">John 7:45</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:13">Acts 3:13</span> ; see also Winer, Gr., edn. 6, § 23. 1): but <em> to Jesus</em> , as the subject of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:26">John 3:26</span> ; and thus is not merely a <em> general</em> testimony with regard to the Messiah, but a <em> personal</em> one to Jesus.</p>
