<p><strong> 29.</strong> ] Here first, (and here only in our Gospel,) comes from the mouth of the Forerunner, this great symbolical reference which is so common in the other Gospels and in the Epistles. It is remarkable that our Lord brings it forward in His answer <em> to the disciples of John</em> respecting fasting, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:15">Matthew 9:15</span> ; where see note on the further import of the terms used.

<p>The <strong> φίλος τοῦ νυμφίου</strong> (Heb. שׁוֹשְׁבַּן ) was the regular organ of communication in the preliminaries of marriage, and had the ordering of the marriage feast. It is to this last time, and not to any ceremonial custom connected with the marriage rites, that this verse refers. The friend rejoices at hearing the <strong> φωνὴ τοῦ νυμφίου</strong> <strong> ,</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:34">Jeremiah 7:34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+16:9">Jeremiah 16:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+25:10">Jeremiah 25:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+18:23">Revelation 18:23</span> ,) in his triumph and joy, <em> at the marriage</em> . He <strong> χαρᾷ χαίρει</strong> (see reff.: 1Th 3:9 is not a parallel case as to <em> construction</em> , for <strong> ᾗ</strong> there is only by attraction) because he hears in the voice of the Bridegroom an assurance of the happy completion of his mission, and on account of the voice itself, τὴν οὕτω γλυκεῖαν , τὴν οὕτως ἐπέραστον , τὴν οὕτω σωτήριον .
