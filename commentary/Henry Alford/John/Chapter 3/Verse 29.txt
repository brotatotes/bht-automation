<b> 29.]</b> Here first, (and here only in our Gospel,) comes, from the mouth of the Forerunner, this great symbolical reference, which is so common in the other Gospels and in the Epistles. It is remarkable that our Lord brings it forward in His answer<i> to the disciples of John</i> respecting fasting, Matt. ix. 15: where see note on the further import of the terms used.<br><br> The<b> friend of the bridegroom</b> was the regular organ of communication in the preliminaries of marriage, and had the ordering of the marriage feast. It is to this last time, and not to any ceremonial custom connected with the marriage rites, that this verse refers. The friend rejoices at hearing the<b> voice of the bridegroom</b>, (see Jer. vii. 34; xvi. 9; xxv. 10: Rev. xviii. 23,) in his triumph and joy,<i> at the marriage</i>. He<b> rejoiceth with joy</b> because he hears in the voice of the Bridegroom an assurance of the happy completion of his mission, and on account of the voice itself,— “so sweet, so lovely, so telling of salvation.”<br><br> The words standeth and belong merely to the graphic setting forth of the similitude.<br><br><b> this my joy therefore is fulfilled]</b> “Because I have presented the bride to Him, and fulfilled, as is elsewhere said, the ministry entrusted to me.” Euthymius.
