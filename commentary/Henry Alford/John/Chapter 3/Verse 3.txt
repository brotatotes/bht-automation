<b> 3.]</b> We are not to imagine that any thing is wanting to complete the sense or connexion. Our Lord replies, It is not<i> learning</i>, but<i> life</i>, that is wanted for the Messiah’s Kingdom; and<i> life</i> must begin by<i> birth</i>. Luther says: “My teaching is not of<i> doing</i> and<i> leaving undone</i>, but of a<i> change in the man</i>;—so that it is, not<i> new works</i> done, but a<i> new man</i> to do them; not another<i> life</i> only, but another<i> birth</i>.” And<i> only by this means</i> can Nicodemus gain the teaching for which he is come,— “<i>see the Kingdom of God</i>,”— ‘become a disciple of Christ:’—”<b> see</b>,<i> that is, understand</i>,” says Theophylact,— ‘<i>understand, by sharing’</i>— ‘have any conception of.’<br><br><b> anew]</b> “<i>some say</i>,<b> from heaven</b>,<i> some</i>,<b> from the beginning</b>.” Chrysostom:—who, as also Euthymius, explains it by<i> ‘regeneration</i>:”—Origen, Cyril, and Theophylact taking the other meaning.<br><br> The true meaning is to be found by taking into account the answer of Nicodemus, who obviously understood it of a<i> new birth in mature life</i>.<b> Born anew or afresh</b> is a better rendering than ‘<i>born again</i>,’ being closer to the meaning of the Greek word, ‘from the very beginning;’— ‘unless a man begin his life anew altogether (see Gal. iv. 9), he cannot’&c.<br><br> It is not impossible that the other meaning may lie<i> beneath this</i>,—as the<i> kingdom</i> is<b> of God</b>, and so must the birth be;—but Grotius has made the important remark, that in the language in which our Lord probably spoke, there is no word of double meaning corresponding to the Greek word here:—so that He must have expressed it, as Nicodemus understood it, of an<i> entirely new birth</i>.<br><br><b> 32],</b> His witness is not, like John’s, only of what he has been forewarned to expect, but of that which He has seen and heard. But<b> no man</b>,—i. e. in reference to the<i> world</i>, into which He is come, the<i> darkness</i> in which His light shines,—<i>no one comparatively</i>,—receives His testimony. The state of men’s minds at Jerusalem with regard to Jesus must ere this have been well known to the Baptist.
