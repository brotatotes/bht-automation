<b> 31.]</b> Many modern critics maintain that after ver. 30 we have the words,<i> not of the Baptist, but of the Evangelist</i>. Lücke and De Wette assume that the Evangelist has put his own thoughts into the Baptist’s mouth, or at least mixed them with his words. The reason of this arbitrary hypothesis is, (<i>a</i>)<i> That the sentiments of the following verses seem to them not to be congruous with the time and position of the Baptist.</i> But some of them confess that this very position of the Baptist is to them yet unexplained, and are disposed to question the applicability to their idea of it of very much which is undoubtedly recorded to have been said by him. So that we cannot allow such a view much critical weight, unless it can be first clearly shewn,<i> what were</i> the Baptist’s convictions concerning the Person and Office of our Lord, (<i>b</i>)<i> That the diction and sentiments of the following verses are so entirely in the style of our Evangelist</i>. But first, I by no means grant this, in the sense which is here meant. It will be seen by the reff. in my Greek Test. that the Evangelist does not so frequently repeat his own favourite expressions as in most other passages of equal length. And even were this so the remark made above on vv. 16–21, would apply here also; that the Evangelist’s peculiar style of theological expression was formed on some model; and on what more likely than in the first place the discourses of his divine Master, and then such sententious and striking testimonies as the present? But there is a weightier reason than these for opposing the above view, and that arises from what modern criticism has been so much given to overlook,—<i>the inner coherence of the discourse itself</i>; in which John explains to his disciples the<i> reason why</i> HE must increase; whereas his own dignity was to be eclipsed before Him. This will!be seen below as we proceed.
