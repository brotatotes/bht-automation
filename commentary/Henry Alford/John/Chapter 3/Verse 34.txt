</b>This exception shews the correctness of the sense just assigned to “<i>no man</i>.’ “He that hath received His testimony, and believeth Him, hath confirmed, shewn, that God is true who sent Him, Whose are the words which He speaks; but he that hath not received it and disbelieveth Him, doeth the contrary, and in fact is an open withstander of God,” Euthymius.<br><br><b> true</b>, not as Wetstein, that God has been true to His promises by the prophets: this does not suit the context; but as above from Euthym.,<b> true</b> in Himself: a revealer, and fountain of truth.<br><br><b> for God giveth not the Spirit by measure]</b> Seeing that the contrast is between the<i> unlimited</i> gift of the Spirit to Him that comes from above, and the<i> limited</i> participation of Him by those who are of the earth; we must not understand the assertion generally, but supply<i> to Him</i> as has usually been done. The Rabbinical books say that the Holy Spirit was only given to the prophets by measure. This unmeasured pouring of the Spirit on Him accounts for his speaking the words of God.
