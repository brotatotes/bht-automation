 6. ] The neuter denotes not only the universal application of this truth, but (see Luk 1:35 ) the very first beginnings of life in the embryo, before sex can be predicated. So Bengel: “notat ipsa prima stamina vitæ.”
	The Lord here answers Nicodemus’s hypothetical question of John 3:4 , by telling him that  even could it be so , it would not accomplish the birth of which He speaks.
	In this  σάρξ is included  every part of that which is born after the ordinary method of generation: even the spirit of man, which, receptive as it is of the Spirit of God, is yet in the natural birth  dead , sunk in trespasses and sins, and in a state of wrath. Such ‘flesh and blood’ cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, 1 Corinthians 15:50 . But when the man is born again of the Spirit (the water does not appear any more, being merely the outward form of reception, the less included in the greater), then just as flesh generates flesh, so spirit generates spirit, after its own image, see 2Co 3:18 fin.; and since the Kingdom of God is a spiritual kingdom, such only who are so born can enter into it.
