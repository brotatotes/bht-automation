<b> 6.]</b> The neuter gender (<b>that which</b><i> is born</i>....) denotes not only the universal application of this truth, but (see Luke i. 35) the very first beginnings of life in the embryo, before sex can be predicated. So Bengel: “It denotes the very first elements of life.”<br><br> The Lord here answers Nicodemus’s hypothetical question of ver. 4, by telling him that<i> even could it be so</i>, it would not accomplish the birth of which He speaks.<br><br> In this<b> flesh</b> is included<i> every part</i> of that which is born after the ordinary method of generation: even the spirit of man, which, receptive as it is of the Spirit of God, is yet in the natural birth<i> dead</i>, sunk in trespasses and sins, and in a state of wrath. Such ‘flesh and blood’ cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, 1 Cor. xv. 50. But when the man is born again of the Spirit (the water does not appear any more, being merely the outward form of reception,—theless included in thegreater), then just as flesh generates flesh, so spirit generates spirit, after its own image, see 2 Cor. iii. 18 end; and since the Kingdom of God is a spiritual kingdom, such only who are so born can enter into it.
