<b> 7.]</b> The weightiest word here is<b> Ye</b>. The Lord did not, could not, say this of<i> Himself</i>. Why?â€”Because in the full sense in which the flesh is incapacitated from entering the kingdom of God, He was<i> not born of the flesh</i>. He inherited the weakness of the flesh, but His spirit was not, like that of sinful man, alien from holiness and God; and therefore on Him no second birth passed; when the Holy Spirit descended on Him at his baptism, the words spoken by the Father were indicative of<i> past approval</i>, not of<i> renewal</i>. His obedience was accepted as perfect, and the good pleasure of the Father rested on Him. Therefore He includes not Himself in this necessity for the new birth.
