 7. ] The weightiest word here is  ὑμᾶς  . The Lord did not, could not, say this of  Himself . Why? Because in the full sense in which the flesh is incapacitated from entering the kingdom of God, He was  not born of the flesh . He inherited the weakness of the flesh, but His spirit was not, like that of sinful man, alien from holiness and God; and therefore on Him no second birth passed; when the Holy Spirit descended on Him at His baptism, the words spoken by the Father were indicative of  past approval , not of  renewal . His obedience was accepted as perfect, and the good pleasure of the Father rested on Him. Therefore He includes not Himself in this necessity for the new birth.
	The  μὴ θαυμάσῃς applies to the next verse, in which Nicodemus is told that he has things as wonderful around him every day in the natural world.
