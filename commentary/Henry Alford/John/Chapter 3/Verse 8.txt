<b> 8.]</b> Our Lord might have chosen any of the mysteries of nature to illustrate the point:—He takes<i> that one</i>, which is above others symbolic of the action of the<i> Spirit</i>, and which (in both languages, that in which He spoke, as well as that in which His speech is reported) is expressed by<i> the same word</i> as it;—<i>Pneuma</i> being both<i> wind</i> and<i> spirit</i>. So that the words as they stand apply themselves at once to the Spirit and His working, without any figure. Bengel, after Origen and Augustine, takes the word<i> pneuma</i> with which this verse opens, and which we have rendered<b> wind</b>, of the<i> Holy Spirit</i> exclusively: but this can hardly be. The<i> form</i> of the sentence, as well as its import, is against it. The words “<i>bloweth</i>,” “<i>hearest</i>,” “<i>knowest</i>,” are all said of well-known facts. And the comparison would not hold on that supposition— ‘As<i> the Spirit</i> is in His working on those born of Him, so is<i> every one that is born of the Spirit</i>. But on the other interpretation, we have<b> The wind bloweth, &c.:—so is</b>, i.e.<i> ‘so it is with’</i> (see a similar construction Matt. xiii. 45)<b> every one born of the Spirit</b>.<br><br> The word<i> pneuma</i> is not the violent wind, which is otherwise expressed, but the<i> gentle breath</i> of the wind;—and it is<i> heard, not felt</i>;—a case in which “<i>thou knowest not, &c.</i>” is more applicable than in that of a violent wind steadily blowing. It is one of those sudden breezes springing up on a calm day, which has no apparent direction, but we hear it rustling in the leaves around. The<b> where it listeth</b>,<i> in the application</i>, implies the<i> freedom</i> (2 Cor. iii. 17) and<i> unrestrained working of the Spirit</i> (1 Cor. xii. 11).<br><br><b> every one that is born of the Spirit]</b> Our Lord can hardly, as Stier explains, mean<i> Himself</i> by these words; or if He does, only<i> inclusively</i>, as being<i> one born of the Spirit</i>,—not principally. He describes<i> the mystery of the spiritual life</i>: we see its<i> effects</i>, in ourselves, and others who have it; but we cannot trace its beginnings, nor can we prescribe to the Holy Spirit His course: He works in us and leads us on, accompanying us with His witness,—<i>His voice</i>, spiritually discerned.<br><br> This saying of the Lord—in contradiction to all so-called Methodism, which prescribes the time and manner of the working of the Spirit—assures us of the manifold and undefinable variety of both these. ‘The physiognomies of those who are born again, are as various as those of natural men.’ Draseke.
