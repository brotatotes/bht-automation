<b> 8.]</b> Our Lord might have chosen any of the mysteries of nature to illustrate the point:—He takes<i> that one</i>, which is above others symbolic of the action of the<i> Spirit</i>, and which (in both languages, that in which He spoke, as well as that in which His speech is reported) is expressed by<i> the same word</i> as it;—<i>Pneuma</i> being both<i> wind</i> and<i> spirit</i>. So that the words as they stand apply themselves at once to the Spirit and His working, without any figure. Bengel, after Origen and Augustine, takes the word<i> pneuma</i> with which this verse opens, and which we have rendered<b> wind</b>, of the<i> Holy Spirit</i> exclusively: but this can hardly be. The<i> form</i> of the sentence, as well as its import, is against it. The words “<i>bloweth</i>,” “<i>hearest</i>,” “<i>knowest</i>,” are all said of well-known facts. And the comparison would not hold on that supposition— ‘As<i> the Spirit</i> is in His working on those born of Him, so is<i> every one that is born of the Spirit</i>. But on the other interpretation, we have<b> The wind bloweth, &c.:—so is</b>, i.e.<i> ‘so it is with’</i> (see a similar construction Matt. xiii. 45)<b> every one born of the Spirit</b>.
