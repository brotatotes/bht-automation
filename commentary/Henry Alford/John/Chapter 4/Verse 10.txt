 10. ] The important words  the gift of God have been misunderstood by many Commentators. Some suppose them to mean ‘  our Lord himself ,’ and to be in apposition with the next clause, καὶ τίς ἐστιν κ . τ . λ . Others, ‘  this opportunity of speaking with me .’ Doubtless both these meanings  are involved , especially the former: but  neither of them is the primary one , as addressed to the woman. The WATER  is, in this first part of the discourse, the subject , and serves as a point of connexion, whereby the woman’s thoughts may be elevated, and her desire aroused. The process of the discourse in this particular is similar to that in Acts 14:17 . From recognizing  this water as the gift of God, in its  limitation , John 4:13 , and its  parabolic import , John 4:14 , her view is directed to Him who was speaking with her, and the Gift which He should bestow, THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT: see ch. John 7:37-39 .
	 τίς ἐστιν ] These pregnant words form the  second step in our Lord’s declaration. He who speaks with thee is no ordinary Ἰουδαῖος , nor any ordinary man, but One who can give thee the gift of God; One sent from God, and God Himself. All this lies in the words, which however only serve to arouse in the woman’s mind the question of John 4:12 (see below).
	 ὕδωρ ζῶν ] Designedly used in a double sense by our Lord, that the woman may lay hold of the  material meaning, and by it be awakened to the  higher one (see reff.). The words bring with them, and in our Lord’s inner meaning involved, the performance of all such prophetic promises as Ezekiel 36:25 ; Zechariah 13:1 (see also Jer 2:13 ); but, as regarded the woman, the  ordinary sense was that intended for her to fasten on, which she does accordingly. On the question, how this living water could be  now given, before Jesus was glorified, see on ch. John 7:38-39 .
