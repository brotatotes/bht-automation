<b> 10.]</b> The important words<b> the gift of God</b> have been misunderstood by many Commentators. Some suppose them to mean ‘<i>our Lord Himself</i>,’ and to be in apposition with the next clause,<b> and who it is</b>, &c. Others, ‘<i>this opportunity of speaking with Me.’</i> Doubtless both these meanings<i> are involved</i>,—especially the former: but<i> neither of them is the primary one</i>, as addressed to the woman. The WATER<i> is, in this first part of the discourse, the subject</i>, and serves as a point of connexion, whereby the woman’s thoughts may be elevated, and her desire aroused. The process of the discourse in this particular is similar to that in Acts xiv. 17, From recognizing<i> this water</i> as the gift of God, in its<i> limitation</i>, ver. 13, and its<i> parabolic import</i>, ver. 14, her view is directed to Him who was speaking with her, and the Gift which He should bestow,—THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT: see ch. vii. 37–39.<br><br><b> who it is]</b> These pregnant words form the<i> second step</i> in our Lord’s declaration. He who speaks with thee is no ordinary Jew, nor any ordinary man, but One who can give thee the gift of God; One sent from God, and God Himself. All this lies in the words, which however only serve to arouse in the woman’s mind the question of ver. 12 (see below).<br><br><b> living water]</b> Designedly used in a double sense by our Lord, that the woman may lay hold of the<i> material</i> meaning, and by it be awakened to the<i> higher one</i> (see reff.), The words bring with them, and in our Lord’s inner meaning involved, the performance of all such prophetic promises as Ezek. xxxvi. 25; Zech. xiii. 1 (see also Jer. ii, 13); but, as regarded the woman, the<i> ordinary sense</i> was that intended for her to fasten on, which she does accordingly. On the question, how this living water could be<i> now</i> given, before Jesus was glorified, see on ch. vii. 38, 39.<br><br> The words apply to every similar quenching of desire by earthly means: the desire springs up again;—is not<i> satisfied</i>, but only<i> postponed</i>. The manna was as insufficient to satisfy hunger,—as this water, thirst, see ch. vi. 49, 58: it is only the<b> living</b><i> water</i>, and the<i> bread of</i> life, which can<i> satisfy</i>.<br><br> In the original, the words<b> Every one that drinketh</b> set forth the recurrence, the interrupted seasons, of the drinking of earthly water;—but<b> whosoever shall have drunk</b> sets forth the<i> once having tasted</i>, and ever continuing in the increasing power, and living forth-flowing, of that life-long draught.<br><br><b> shall thirst no more for ever</b>, shall never have to go away and be exhausted, and come again to he filled;—but shall have the spring at home, in his own breast,—so that he can “<i>draw water with joy out of the wells of salvation</i>” (Isa. xii. 3) at his pleasure. “When thirst does recur, it is the defect of the man, not of the water.” Bengel.<br><br><b> shall become a well]</b> All earthly supplies have access only into those lower parts of our being where the desires<i> work themselves out</i>—are but<i> local applications</i>; but the heavenly gift of spiritual life which Jesus gives to those who believe on Him, enters into the<i> very secret and highest place of their personal life, the source whence the desires spring out</i>:—and, its nature being living and spiritual, it docs not merely<i> supply</i>, but it<i> lives</i> and waxes onward, unto everlasting life,<i> in duration</i>, and also<i> as producing and sustaining it</i>.<br><br> It should not be overlooked, that this discourse had, besides its manifold and wonderful meaning for us all, an especial moral one as applied to the woman,—who, by successive draughts at the ‘broken cistern’ of carnal lust, had been vainly seeking solace:—and this consideration serves to bind on the following verses (ver. 16 ff.) to the preceding, by another link besides those noticed below.
