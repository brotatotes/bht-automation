<b> 10.]</b> The important words<b> the gift of God</b> have been misunderstood by many Commentators. Some suppose them to mean ‘<i>our Lord Himself</i>,’ and to be in apposition with the next clause,<b> and who it is</b>, &c. Others, ‘<i>this opportunity of speaking with Me.’</i> Doubtless both these meanings<i> are involved</i>,—especially the former: but<i> neither of them is the primary one</i>, as addressed to the woman. The WATER<i> is, in this first part of the discourse, the subject</i>, and serves as a point of connexion, whereby the woman’s thoughts may be elevated, and her desire aroused. The process of the discourse in this particular is similar to that in Acts xiv. 17, From recognizing<i> this water</i> as the gift of God, in its<i> limitation</i>, ver. 13, and its<i> parabolic import</i>, ver. 14, her view is directed to Him who was speaking with her, and the Gift which He should bestow,—THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT: see ch. vii. 37–39.
