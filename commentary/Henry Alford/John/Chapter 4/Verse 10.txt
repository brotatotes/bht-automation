<b> 10.]</b> The important words<b> the gift of God</b> have been misunderstood by many Commentators. Some suppose them to mean ‘<i>our Lord Himself</i>,’ and to be in apposition with the next clause,<b> and who it is</b>, &c. Others, ‘<i>this opportunity of speaking with Me.’</i> Doubtless both these meanings<i> are involved</i>,—especially the former: but<i> neither of them is the primary one</i>, as addressed to the woman. The WATER<i> is, in this first part of the discourse, the subject</i>, and serves as a point of connexion, whereby the woman’s thoughts may be elevated, and her desire aroused. The process of the discourse in this particular is similar to that in Acts xiv. 17, From recognizing<i> this water</i> as the gift of God, in its<i> limitation</i>, ver. 13, and its<i> parabolic import</i>, ver. 14, her view is directed to Him who was speaking with her, and the Gift which He should bestow,—THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT: see ch. vii. 37–39.<br><br><b> who it is]</b> These pregnant words form the<i> second step</i> in our Lord’s declaration. He who speaks with thee is no ordinary Jew, nor any ordinary man, but One who can give thee the gift of God; One sent from God, and God Himself. All this lies in the words, which however only serve to arouse in the woman’s mind the question of ver. 12 (see below).<br><br><b> living water]</b> Designedly used in a double sense by our Lord, that the woman may lay hold of the<i> material</i> meaning, and by it be awakened to the<i> higher one</i> (see reff.), The words bring with them, and in our Lord’s inner meaning involved, the performance of all such prophetic promises as Ezek. xxxvi. 25; Zech. xiii. 1 (see also Jer. ii, 13); but, as regarded the woman, the<i> ordinary sense</i> was that intended for her to fasten on, which she does accordingly. On the question, how this living water could be<i> now</i> given, before Jesus was glorified, see on ch. vii. 38, 39.
