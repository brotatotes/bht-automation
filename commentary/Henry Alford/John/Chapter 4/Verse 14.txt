but the water which He should give has<i> living power</i>, and becomes an eternal fountain within. This however, ‘that<i> He was greater than Jacob</i>,’ lies only in the background:<i> the water</i> is the subject, as before.<br><br> The words apply to every similar quenching of desire by earthly means: the desire springs up again;—is not<i> satisfied</i>, but only<i> postponed</i>. The manna was as insufficient to satisfy hunger,—as this water, thirst, see ch. vi. 49, 58: it is only the<b> living</b><i> water</i>, and the<i> bread of</i> life, which can<i> satisfy</i>.<br><br> In the original, the words<b> Every one that drinketh</b> set forth the recurrence, the interrupted seasons, of the drinking of earthly water;—but<b> whosoever shall have drunk</b> sets forth the<i> once having tasted</i>, and ever continuing in the increasing power, and living forth-flowing, of that life-long draught.<br><br><b> shall thirst no more for ever</b>, shall never have to go away and be exhausted, and come again to be filled;—but shall have the spring at home, in his own breast,—so that he can “<i>draw water with joy out of the wells of salvation</i>” (Isa. xii. 3) at his pleasure. “When thirst does recur, it is the defect of the man, not of the water.” Bengel.<br><br><b> shall become a well]</b> All earthly supplies have access only into those lower parts of our being where the desires<i> work themselves out</i>—are but<i> local applications</i>; but the heavenly gift of spiritual life which Jesus gives to those who believe on Him, enters into the<i> very secret and highest place of their personal life, the source whence the desires spring out</i>:—and, its nature being living and spiritual, it docs not merely<i> supply</i>, but it<i> lives</i> and waxes onward, unto everlasting life,<i> in duration</i>, and also<i> as producing and sustaining it</i>.<br><br> It should not be overlooked, that this discourse had, besides its manifold and wonderful meaning for us all, an especial moral one as applied to the woman,—who, by successive draughts at the ‘broken cistern’ of carnal lust, had been vainly seeking solace:—and this consideration serves to bind on the following verses (ver. 16 ff.) to the preceding, by another link besides those noticed below.
