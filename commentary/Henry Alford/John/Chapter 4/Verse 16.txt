<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] The connexion of this verse with the foregoing has been much disputed; and the strangest and most unworthy views have been taken of it. Some (e.g. Grotius) have strangely referred it to the supposed indecorum of the longer continuance of the colloquy with the woman alone; some more strangely still (Cyril Alex [63] in Catena, Lücke, p. 588) to the incapacity of the female mind to apprehend the matters of which He was to speak. Both these need surely no refutation. The band of women from Galilee, “last at the cross, and earliest at the tomb,” are a sufficient answer to them.

<p>Those approach nearer the truth, who believe the command to have been given <em> to awaken her conscience</em> (Maldonatus and alli [64] .); or to shew her the divine knowledge which the Lord had of her heart (Meyer). But I am persuaded that the right account is found, in viewing this command, as the <em> first step of granting her request</em> , δός μοι τοῦτο τὸ ὕδωρ . The first work of the Spirit of God, and of Him who here spoke in the fulness of that Spirit, is, to <em> convince of sin</em> . The ‘give me this water’ was not so simple a matter as she supposed. The heart must first be laid bare before the Wisdom of God: the secret sins set in the light of His countenance; and this our Lord here does. The command itself is of course given in the fulness of knowledge of her sinful condition of life. In every conversation which our Lord held with men, while He connects usually one remark with another by the common links which bind human thought, we perceive that He knows, and sees through, those with whom He speaks. Euthymius, though not seeing the whole bearing of the command, expresses well this last remark; ἐγκειμένης καὶ ζητούσης λαβεῖν , λέγει Ὕπαγε κ . τ . λ . προσποιούμενος ὅτι χρὴ κἀκεῖνον κοινωνῆσαι ταύτῃ τοῦ δώρον . καὶ ὅτι μὲν οὐκ ἔχει ἄνδρα νόμιμον ἐγίνωσκεν , ὡς πάντα εἰδώς · ἐβούλετο δὲ ταύτην εἰπεῖν ὅτι οὐκ ἔχω ἄνδρα , ἵνα λοιπόν , προφάσεως δραξάμενος , προφητεύσῃ τὰ κατ ʼ αὐτὴν καὶ διορθώσηται ταύτην . θέλει γὰρ τῶν προῤῥήσεων καὶ τῶν θαυμάτων τὰς ἀφορμὰς παρ ʼ αὐτῶν λαμβάνειν τῶν προσιόντων , ὥστε καὶ τὴν τοῦ κενοδοξεῖν ὑπόνοιαν διαφεύγειν , καὶ οἰκειοῦσθαι μᾶλλον αὐτούς .
