<b> 18.]</b> There was<i> literal</i> truth, but no more, in the woman’s answer: and the Lord, by His divine knowledge, detects the hidden falsehood of it. Notice it is<b> true</b> (a fact—bare truth), not<b> truly</b>: this<i> one word</i> was<i> true</i>: further shewn by the emphatic position of the word<b> husband</b> in our Lord’s answer,—which was not so placed in hers.<br><br><b> thou hast had five husbands]</b> These five<i> were certainly lawful husbands</i>; they are distinguished from the sixth, who<i> was not</i>;—probably the woman had been separated from some by divorce (the law of which was but loose among the Samaritans),—from some by death,—or perhaps by other reasons more or less discreditable to her character, which had now become degraded into that of an openly licentious woman, The conviction of sin here lies beneath the surface: it is not pressed, nor at the moment does it seem to have worked deeply, for she goes on with the conversation with apparent indifference to it; but our Lord’s words in vv. 25, 26 would tend to infix it more deeply, and we find at ver. 29, that it had been working during her journey back to the city.
