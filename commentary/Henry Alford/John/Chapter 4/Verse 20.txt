Him Sanballat not only received, but made him high priest of a temple which he built on Mount Gerizim. Josephus makes this appointment sanctioned by Alexander, when at Tyre;—but the chronology is certainly not accurate, for between Sanballat and Alexander is a difference of nearly a century. This temple was destroyed 200 years after by John Hyreanus (B. c. 129); but the Samaritans still used it as a place of prayer and sacrifice, and to this day the few Samaritans resident in Nablus (Sychem) call it<i> the holy mountain</i>, and turn their faces to it in prayer.<br><br> They defended their practice by Deut. xxvii. 4, where our reading and the Heb. and LXX is Ebal, but that of the Samaritan Pentateuch, Gerizim (probably an alteration): also by Gen. xii. 6, 7; xiii, 4; xxxiii. 18, 20; Deut. xi. 26 ff.<br><br><b> Our fathers</b> most likely means<i> not the patriarchs</i>, but the ancestors of the then Samaritans.<br><br><b> the place where men ought to worship]</b> The definite place spoken of in Deut. xii. 5.<br><br> She pauses, having suggested, rather than asked, a question,—seeming to imply, ‘Before I can receive this gift of God, it must be decided, where I can acceptably pray for it;’ and she leaves it for Him whom she now recognizes as a prophet, to resolve this doubt.
