The neuter <strong> ὅ</strong> is used to shew the want of personality and distinctness in their idea of God: the second <strong> ὅ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> merely as corresponding to it in the other member of the sentence.

But not only this; the Messiah Himself was to spring from among the Jews, and <em> had sprung</em> from among them; not <strong> ἔσται</strong> <strong> ,</strong> but <strong> ἐστίν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the abstract present, but perhaps with a reference to what was then happening.
