<b> 22.]</b> But He will not leave the temple of Zion and the worship appointed by God without His testimony. He decides her question not merely by affirming, but by<i> proving</i> the Jewish worship to be the right one. In the Samaritan worship there was no leading of God to guide them, there were no prophetic voices revealing more and more of His purposes. The neuter,<b> that which</b>, is used to shew the want of personality and distinctness in their idea of God:—the second<b> that which</b>, merely as corresponding to it in the other member of the sentence. Or perhaps better,<i> both</i>, as designating merely the abstract<i> object of worship</i>, not the personal God. The word<b> we</b> is remarkable, as being the<i> only instance</i> of our Lord thus speaking. But the nature of the case accounts for it. He never elsewhere is speaking to one so set in opposition to the Jews on a point where Himself and the Jews stood together for God’s truth. He now speaks<i> as a Jew</i>. The nearest approach to it is in His answer to the Canaanitish woman, Matt. xv. 24, 26.<br><br><b> because</b>: this is<i> the reason</i> why we know what we worship, because the promises of God are made to us, and we possess them and believe them; see Rom. iii. 1, 2.<br><br><b> salvation</b> (or, literally,<b> the salvation</b> [of men])<b> cometh of the Jews]</b> It was in this point especially, expectation of the promised salvation by the great Deliverer (see Gen. xlix. 18), that the Samaritan rejection of the prophetic word had made them so deficient in comparison of the Jews. But not only this;—the Messiah Himself was to spring from among the Jews, and<i> had sprung</i> from among them;—not “<i>shall come</i>,” but<b> cometh</b>, the abstract present, but perhaps with a reference to what was then happening. See Isa. ii. 1–3.
