The neuter,<b> that which</b>, is used to shew the want of personality and distinctness in their idea of God:—the second<b> that which</b>, merely as corresponding to it in the other member of the sentence. Or perhaps better,<i> both</i>, as designating merely the abstract<i> object of worship</i>, not the personal God. The word<b> we</b> is remarkable, as being the<i> only instance</i> of our Lord thus speaking. But the nature of the case accounts for it. He never elsewhere is speaking to one so set in opposition to the Jews on a point where Himself and the Jews stood together for God’s truth. He now speaks<i> as a Jew</i>.
