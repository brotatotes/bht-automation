<b> 23.]</b> The discourse returns to the ground taken in ver. 21, but not so as to make ver. 22 parenthetical only: the spiritual worship now to be spoken of is the carrying out and consequence of the<i> salvation</i> just mentioned, and could not have been brought in without it.<br><br><b> and now is]</b> “This which was not added in ver. 21, is now added, that the woman might not think that the locality of this true worship was to be sought in Judæa alone,” Bengel.<br><br><b> the true worshippers</b>, as distinguished (1) from<i> hypocrites</i>, who have pretended to worship Him: (2) from<i> all</i> who went before, whose worship was necessarily imperfect.<br><br> The words<b> in spirit and in truth</b> (not without an allusion to “<i>in this mountain</i>”) are, in their first meaning, opposed to<i> in mere habit and falsehood</i>,—and denote the<i> earnestness of spirit</i> with which the true worshippers shall worship; so Ps. exlv. 18, “<i>The Lord is nigh.... unto all that call upon him</i><b> in truth</b>.” A deeper meaning is brought out where the ground of this kind of worship is stated, in the next verse.<br><br> Such worshippers God not only ‘requires,’ from His very nature, but<b> seeks</b>,—is seeking. This seeking on the part of the Father naturally brings in the idea, in the woman’s answer, of the Messiah,<i> by Whom</i> He seeks (Luke xix. 10) His true worshippers, to gather them out of the world.
