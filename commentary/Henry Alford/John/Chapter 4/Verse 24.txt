 24. ]  πνεῦμα ὁ θεός was the great Truth of Judaism, whereby the Jews were distinguished from the idolatrous people around them. And the Samaritans held even more strongly than the Jews the pure monotheistic view. Traces of this, remarks Lücke (from Gesenius), i. 599 note, are found in the alterations made by them in their Pentateuch, long before the time of this history. This may perhaps be partly the reason why our Lord, as Bengel remarks, “Discipulis non tradidit sublimiora,” than to this Samaritan woman.
	God being pure  spirit (perhaps better not ‘  a Spirit,’ since it is His  Essence , not His Personality, which is here spoken of), cannot dwell in particular spots or temples (see Acts 7:48 ; Act 17:24-25 ); cannot require, nor be pleased with, earthly material offerings nor ceremonies, as such: on the other hand, is only to be approached in  that part of our being, which is spirit , and even there, inasmuch as He is pure and holy, with no by-ends nor hypocritical regards, but in truth and earnestness. But here comes in the deeper sense alluded to above. How is the spirit of man to be brought into communion with God? “In  templo vis orare; in  te ora . Sed prius  esto templum Dei.” Aug [65] (Stier, iv. 137, edn. 2.) And how is this to be?  Man cannot make himself the temple of God . So that here comes in the  gift of God , with which the discourse began,  the gift of the Holy Spirit , which Christ should give to them that believe on Him: thus we have ‘  praying ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ ,’ Jude 1:20 . So beautifully does the expression  ὁ πατήρ here bring with it the new birth by the Spirit, and for us, the readers of the Gospel, does the discourse of ch. 3 reflect light on this. And so wonderfully do these words form the conclusion to the great subject of these first chapters: ‘GOD IS BECOME ONE FLESH WITH US, THAT WE MIGHT BECOME ONE SPIRIT WITH HIM.’
