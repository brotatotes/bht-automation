<b> 26.]</b> Of the reasons which our Lord had, thus to declare Himself to this Samaritan woman and through her to the inhabitants of Sychem (ver. 42), as the Christ, thus early in his ministry, we surely are not qualified to judge. There is nothing so opposed to true Scripture criticism, as to form a preconceived plan and rationale of the course of our Lord in the flesh, and then to force recorded events into agreement with it. Such a plan<i> will be formed</i> in our own minds from continued study of the Scripture narrative:—but by the arbitrary system which I am here condemning, the ver facts which are the chief data of such a scheme, are themselves set aside. When De Wette says, ‘This early and decided declaration of Jesus is in contradiction with Matt. viii, 4, and xvi. 20,’—he forgets the very different circumstances under which both those injunctions were spoken:—while he is forced to confess that it is in agreement with the whole spirit of the Sermon on the Mount. He who knew what was in man, varied His revelations and injunctions, as the time and place, and individual dispositions required.
