<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <strong> μετὰ γυν</strong> <strong> .</strong> , <strong> with a woman</strong> . No inference, it is true, can be drawn as to the indefiniteness of the noun, from the omission of the article <em> after a preposition</em> , see Bp. Middleton, ch. 6 § 1: but the position of μετὰ γυναικός before the verb throws an emphasis on the words, and makes it probable that the meaning is as above.

<p><strong> τί ζητεῖς; κ.τ.λ.</strong> ] Either <em> to the woman</em> <strong> What seekest thou?</strong> and to the Lord, <strong> Why talkest thou with her?</strong> or perhaps both questions <em> to Him:</em> and then we must suppose a mixture of two constructions, of τί ζ . παρ ʼ αὐτῆς ; and τί λαλεῖς μετ ʼ αὐτῆς ; I rather prefer the former interpretation.</p>
