 27. ]  μετὰ γυν  . ,  with a woman . No inference, it is true, can be drawn as to the indefiniteness of the noun, from the omission of the article  after a preposition , see Bp. Middleton, ch. 6 § 1: but the position of μετὰ γυναικός before the verb throws an emphasis on the words, and makes it probable that the meaning is as above.
	 τί ζητεῖς; κ.τ.λ. ] Either  to the woman  What seekest thou? and to the Lord,  Why talkest thou with her? or perhaps both questions  to Him: and then we must suppose a mixture of two constructions, of τί ζ . παρ ʼ αὐτῆς ; and τί λαλεῖς μετ ʼ αὐτῆς ; I rather prefer the former interpretation.
