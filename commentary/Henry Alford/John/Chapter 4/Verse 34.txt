In the believer on Him, they are partially true,—true as far as he has received the Spirit, and entered into the spiritual life;—but in Him they were absolutely and fully true. His whole life was the doing of the Father’s will. We can ‘eat and drink, &c. to the glory of God,—but in Him the hallowing of the Father’s name, doing His will, bringing about His Kingdom, was His<i> daily bread</i>, and superseded the thoughts and desires for the other, needful as<i> it</i> was for His humanity.<br><br><b> My meat is to be (</b>better,<b> that I may be) doing</b>, &c.<b>]</b> That is, it was our Lord’s continued sustenance, to be ever carrying onward to completion that performance of His Father’s will for which He came into the world. In the words<b> finish his work</b>, the way is prepared for the idea introduced in the next verse. These words give au answer to the questioning in the minds of the disciples, and shew<i> that He had been employed in the Father’s work during their absence.</i>
