In the believer on Him, they are partially true,—true as far as he has received the Spirit, and entered into the spiritual life;—but in Him they were absolutely and fully true. His whole life was the doing of the Father’s will. We can ‘eat and drink, &c. to the glory of God,—but in Him the hallowing of the Father’s name, doing His will, bringing about His Kingdom, was His<i> daily bread</i>, and superseded the thoughts and desires for the other, needful as<i> it</i> was for His humanity.
