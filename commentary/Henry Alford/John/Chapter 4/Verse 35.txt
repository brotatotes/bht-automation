<b> 35.]</b> The sense of these much-controverted words will be best ascertained by narrowly observing the form of the sentence.<br><br><b> Say not ye....</b> surely<i> cannot be the introduction to an observation of what was matter of fact at the time.</i> Had the words been spoken<i> at a time when it wanted four months to the harvest</i>, and had our Lord<i> intended to express this</i>,—is it conceivable that He should have thus introduced the remark? Would not,<i> must</i> not, the question have been a<i> direct</i> one in that case— ‘<i>are there not four months</i>?’&c. I know not how to account for this<b> Say not ye that</b>.... except that it introduces<i> some common saying</i> which the Jews, or perhaps the people of Galileo only, were in the habit of using.<b> Are not ye accustomed to say, that....?</b> That we hear of no such proverb elsewhere, is not to the point;—for such unrecorded sayings are among every people. That we do not know whence to date the four months, is again no objection:—there may have been, in the part where the saying was usual (possibly in the land west of the lake of Tiberias, for those addressed were from thence, and the emphatic “<i>ye</i>” seems to point to some particular locality),<i> some fixed period in the year</i>,—the end of the sowing, or some religious anniversary,—when it was<i> a common saying, that it wanted four months to harvest</i>. And this might have been the first date in the year which had regard to the harvest, and so the best known in connexion with it.<br><br> If this be so, all that has been built on<i> this</i> saying, as giving a chronological date, must fall to the ground. (Lightfoot, Wieseler, and others, maintain, that since the harvest began on the 16th of Nisan, we must reckon four months back from that time for this journey through Samaria, which would bring it to the middle of Chisleu, i.e. the beginning of December.)<br><br> To get the meaning of the latter part of the verse, we must endeavour to follow, as far as may be, the train of thought which pervades the discourse. He that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man: our Lord had now been employed in this His work. But not as in the natural year, so was it to be in the world’s lifetime. One-third of the year may elapse, or more, before the sown seed springs up; but the<i> sowing by the Son of Man</i> comes late in time, and the harvest should immediately follow. The fields were whitening for it; these Samaritans (not that I believe He<i> pointed to them approaching</i>, as Chrysostom and most expositors, but had them in his view in what He said), and the multitudes in Galilee, were all nearly ready. In the discourse as far as ver. 38, He is<i> the sower</i>, the disciples (see Acts viii.) were the<i> reapers</i>:—He was the<i> one who had laboured</i>, they were the<i> persons who had entered into his labours</i>. The<i> past</i> is used, as descriptive of the office which each held, not of the actual thing done. I cannot also but see an allusion to the words spoken by Joshua (xxiv. 18),<i> on this very spot</i>;—«I have given you a land for which ye did not labour.’<br><br> Taking this view,<i> I do not believe there was any allusion to the actual state of the fields at that time.</i> The words<b> Lift up your eyes</b>, &c., are of course to be understood<i> literally</i>;—they were to lift up their eyes and look on the lands around them;—and then came the assurance; ‘they are whitening already towards the harvest.’ And it seems to me that on<i> this view</i>—of the Lord speaking of spiritual things to them, and announcing to them the approach of the spiritual harvest,—<i>and none else,—the right understanding of the following verses depends.</i><br><br> It is of course<i> possible</i> that<i> it may have been seed-time</i>;—possible also, that the fields may have been<i> actually whitening Sor the harvest</i>;—but to lay down either of these as certain, and build chronological inferences on it, is quite unwarranted.
