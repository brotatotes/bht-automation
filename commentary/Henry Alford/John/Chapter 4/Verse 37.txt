 37. ] ὁ λόγ .  ἐστιν [ ὁ ] ἀλ ., i.e.  has place, applies = συμβέβηκεν in 2 Peter 2:22 . So Winer, Meyer (1), Stier, but contr. Lücke, De Wette, who question the propriety of the art. and take [ ὁ ] ἀληθινός for the predicate, and as = ἀληθής . John’s usage however is to join ὁ λόγ . ὁ ἀληθινός : see ch. John 15:1 . We may also take the words, without doing any violence to the art. before ἀληθινός , ‘Herein is that saying the true one.’ But I still prefer the other way. If we regard the bracketed article as omitted, the sense will of course be, ‘Herein is that saying true.’ Such however is not St. John’s usage: see above.
