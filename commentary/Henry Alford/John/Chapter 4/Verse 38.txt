 38. ] Here, as often, our Lord speaks of the office and its work as  accomplished , which is but beginning (see Isa 46:10 ).
	By  ἄλλοι here He cannot mean the O.T. Prophets (Grotius, Bengel, Lange), for then His own place would be altogether left out; and besides, all Scripture analogy is against the idea of the O.T. being the  seed of which the N.T. is the  fruit: nor can it be  right , as Olshausen maintains, to leave Him out, as being the  Lord of the Harvest: for He is certainly  elsewhere , and was by the very nature of the case  here, the Sower . The plural is I believe merely inserted as the correspondent word to ὑμεῖς in the explanation, as it was ἄλλος ἄλλος , in the proverb. (So Lücke, Tholuck, Stier. De Wette denies their interpretation, but gives none of his own.)
