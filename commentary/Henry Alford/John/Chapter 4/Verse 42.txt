It does not seem that any miracle was wrought there: the feeling expressed in the words “<i>we have heard</i><i> Him ourselves</i>” was enough to raise their faith to a point never attained by the Jews, and hardly as yet by the disciples,—that He was the Saviour of<i> the world</i>. Their view seems to have been less clouded by prejudice and narrow-mindedness than that of the Jews; and though the conversion of this people lay not in the plan of the official life of our Lord, or working of His Apostles during it (see Matt. x. 5),—yet we have abundant proof from this history, of His gracious purposes towards them. A trace of this occurrence may be found ch. viii, 48, where see note. Compare throughout Acts viii. 1–25. The word rendered<b> story</b> (literally, “<i>this talking</i>”) is one in which it is hardly possible not to see something of allusion to the woman’s eager and diffuse report to them.
