<b> 46. a certain nobleman]</b> literally, “<i>a royal person</i>.” “Either,” say Euthymius and Chrysostom, “one of the royal race, or one in possession of some dignity from which he was called ‘<i>royal</i>;’” or, Euthymius adds, “because he was a servant of the King.” Origen thinks he may have been one of the household of Cæsar, having some business in Judæa at that time. But the usage of Josephus is perhaps our surest guide. He uses this word “<i>royal</i>,” to distinguish the soldiers, or courtiers, or officers of the<i> kings</i> (Herods or others), from those of<i> Rome</i>,—but never to designate the royal family. So that this man was probably an officer of Herod Antipas. He may haye been Chuza, Herod’s steward, Luke viii. 3: but this is pure conjecture. The man seems to have been a Jew: see below.
