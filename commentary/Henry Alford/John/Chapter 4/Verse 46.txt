<b> 46. a certain nobleman]</b> literally, “<i>a royal person</i>.” “Either,” say Euthymius and Chrysostom, “one of the royal race, or one in possession of some dignity from which he was called ‘<i>royal</i>;’” or, Euthymius adds, “because he was a servant of the King.” Origen thinks he may have been one of the household of Cæsar, having some business in Judæa at that time. But the usage of Josephus is perhaps our surest guide. He uses this word “<i>royal</i>,” to distinguish the soldiers, or courtiers, or officers of the<i> kings</i> (Herods or others), from those of<i> Rome</i>,—but never to designate the royal family. So that this man was probably an officer of Herod Antipas. He may haye been Chuza, Herod’s steward, Luke viii. 3: but this is pure conjecture. The man seems to have been a Jew: see below.<br><br><b> come down</b>: see on ch. ii. 12.<br><br> The charge brought against them,<b> Except ye see signs and wonders</b>, &c., docs not imply, as some think, that they would not believe signs and wonders<i> heard of</i>, but required to<i> see</i> them—for in this case the expression would certainly have been fuller, “<i>see with your eyes</i>,” or something similar;—and it would not accord with our Lord’s known low estimate of all<i> mere miracle-faith</i>, to find Him making so weighty a difference between faith from miracles<i> seen</i> and faith from miracles<i> heard</i>. The words imply the contrast between the Samaritans, who believed<i> because of His word</i>, and the Jews (the<i> plural</i> reckoning the nobleman among them), who would not believe but<i> through signs and prodigies</i>:—see 1 Cor. i. 22. And observe also that it is not implied that even when they had seen signs and wonders, they would believe:—they required these as a condition of their faith, but even these were rejected by them: see ch. xii. 37.<br><br> But even with such inadequate conceptions and conditions of faith, our Lord receives the nobleman, and works the sign rather than dismiss him. It was otherwise in Matt. xvi. 1 ff.
