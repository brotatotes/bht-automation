The charge brought against them,<b> Except ye see signs and wonders</b>, &c., docs not imply, as some think, that they would not believe signs and wonders<i> heard of</i>, but required to<i> see</i> them—for in this case the expression would certainly have been fuller, “<i>see with your eyes</i>,” or something similar;—and it would not accord with our Lord’s known low estimate of all<i> mere miracle-faith</i>, to find Him making so weighty a difference between faith from miracles<i> seen</i> and faith from miracles<i> heard</i>. The words imply the contrast between the Samaritans, who believed<i> because of His word</i>, and the Jews (the<i> plural</i> reckoning the nobleman among them), who would not believe but<i> through signs and prodigies</i>:—see 1 Cor. i. 22. And observe also that it is not implied that even when they had seen signs and wonders, they would believe:—they required these as a condition of their faith, but even these were rejected by them: see ch. xii. 37.<br><br> But even with such inadequate conceptions and conditions of faith, our Lord receives the nobleman, and works the sign rather than dismiss him. It was otherwise in Matt. xvi. 1 ff.
