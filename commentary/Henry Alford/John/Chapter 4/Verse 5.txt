<b> 5.] Sychar</b> is better known by the O.T. name of Shechem. It was a very old town on the range of Mt. Ephraim, in a narrow valley between Mt. Ebal and Mt. Gerizim, Judg. ix. 7. Some think that Sychar, which means “drunken,” was originally a contemptuous name applied by the Jews to Shechem,—which had supplanted the proper appellation.<br><br> Very near it was afterwards built Flavia Neapolis. There is a long and interesting history of Sychem, and the Samaritan. worship on Gerizim, and the Christian church in the neighbourhood, in Robinson’s Palestine, iii. 113–136. See also Dr. Thomson, The Land and the Book, p. 472 ff. He thinks that Sychar and Shechem are not the same, because at Shechem (Nablus) there are delicious fountains of water, which the woman would hardly have left to draw from a deep well two miles off.<br><br> the<b> parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph]</b> This is traditional: finds however support from Gen. xxxiii. 19 where we find Jacob buying a field near Shechem, and Josh. xxiv. 32, where, on the mention of Joseph’s bones being laid there, it is said that it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.<i> Our Lord</i> does not allude to the tradition in the conversation, though the woman does.
