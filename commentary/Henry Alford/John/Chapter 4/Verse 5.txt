<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] Sychar is better known by the O.T. name of Sychem ( Συχέμ ), or τὰ Σίκιμα (Josephus, Euseb., &amp;c.), or ἡ Σικίμα (LXX, 3 Kings Joh 12:25 ). It was a very old town on the range of Mt. Ephraim, in a narrow valley between Mt. Ebal and Mt. Gerizim. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jdg+9:7">Judges 9:7</span> . The name Sychar has been variously derived: from שֶׁקֶר , a lie, or שִׁכֹּר , <em> drunken</em> ( Isa 28:1 ), by some (Reland, Lightfoot), who believe it to have originally been an opprobrious name given by the Jews, but by this time to have lost its signification, and become the usual appelation: by others from Συχέμ , by mere corruption of the terminating liquid μ into ρ , Olsh.

<p>Very near it was afterwards built Flavia Neapolis ( Συχέμ , νῦν ἔρημος , δείκνυται δὲ ὁ τόπος ἐν προαστείοις νέας πόλεως , Euseb. Onomasticon, in Winer, sub voce). There is a long and interesting history of Sychem and the Samaritan worship on Gerizim, and the Christian church in the neighbourhood, in Robinson’s Palestine, iii. 113 136. [See also Dr. Thomson, The Land and the Book, p. 472 ff. He thinks that Sychar and Shechem are not the same, because at Shechem (Nablus) there are delicious fountains of water, which the woman would hardly have left to draw from a deep well two miles off.]

Kal. w. suffix of יָהַב , a verb which only occurs in the imperative mood, unless it be in the very doubtful place of Hos 4:18 ). Our Lord does not allude to it in the conversation, though the woman does.</p>
