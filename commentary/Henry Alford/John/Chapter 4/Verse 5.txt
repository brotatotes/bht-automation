<b> 5.] Sychar</b> is better known by the O.T. name of Shechem. It was a very old town on the range of Mt. Ephraim, in a narrow valley between Mt. Ebal and Mt. Gerizim, Judg. ix. 7. Some think that Sychar, which means “drunken,” was originally a contemptuous name applied by the Jews to Shechem,—which had supplanted the proper appellation.
