<b> 54.]</b> The<i> meaning</i> of the Evangelist clearly is, that this was the second<i> Galilæan</i> miracle (see ch. iii. 2, and ver. 45). But (1) how is that expressed in the words? The miracles which He did at Jerusalem in the feast being omitted, the words naturally carry the thoughts back to a former one related; and the clause added ( “<i>when He was come out of Judæa into Galilee”</i>) shews, not that a miracle prior to this, during this return visit, has been passed over,—but that as the scene of this second was in Galilee, so that former one, to which “<i>second</i>” refers, must be sought in Galilee also. And then (2)<i> why</i> should this so particularly be stated? Certainly, it seems to me, on account of the part which this miracle bore in the calling ont and assuring of faith by the manifestation of His glory, as that first one had done before. By that (ch. ii. 11), His disciples had been convinced: by this, one (himself a type of the weak and unworthy in faith) outside the circle of His own. By both, half-belief was strengthened into faith in Him: but in each case it is of a different kind.
