<b> 6.]</b> Robinson (iii, 112) can only solve the difficulty of the present well standing in a spot watered by so many natural fountains, by supposing that it may have been dug, according to the practice of the patriarchs, by Jacob, in connexion with the plot of ground which he bought, to have an independent supply of water.<br><br><b> thus</b> refers to<b> being wearied with his journey</b>, and might be expressed by<b> accordingly</b>. There is no authority for the meaning ‘just as he was,’ or ‘just as it happened,’ i.e. on the bare stone.<br><br><b> the sixth hour</b>, i.e.<b> mid-day</b>. Townson supposed the sixth hour, according to St. John, to mean<i> six in the evening</i>, ‘after the way of reckoning in Asia Minor;’—but, as Lücke observes, this way of reckoning in Asia Minor is a pure invention of Townson’s. A decisive answer however to such a supposition here, or any where else in our Evangelist, is that if would naturally have specified whether it was 6 A.M. or P.M. The<i> unusualness</i> of a woman coming to draw water at mid-day is no argument against its<i> possibility</i>; indeed the very fact of her being<i> alone</i> seems to shew that it was not the common time.
