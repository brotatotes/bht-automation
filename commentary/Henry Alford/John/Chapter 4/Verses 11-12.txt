<p><strong> 11, 12.</strong> ] Though <strong> κύριε</strong> is not to be pressed as emphatic, it is not without import; it surely betokens a different regard of the stranger than <strong> σὺ Ἰουδαῖος ὤν</strong> did; κύριον αὐτὸν προσηγόρευσε , νομίσασα μέγαν εἶναί τινα . Euthym [61] The course of her thoughts appears to be: ‘ <em> Thou canst not mean living water</em> ( ἀναβλύζον καὶ ἁλλόμενον , Euthym [62] ), <em> from</em> <strong> this</strong> <em> well, because thou hast no vessel to draw with, and it is deep; whence then hast thou</em> (knowest thou of, drawest thou) <em> the living water of which thou speakest? Our father Jacob was contented with</em> <strong> this</strong> , <em> used it, and bequeathed it to us: if thou hast better water, and canst give it</em> (notice the ἔδωκεν in both verses), <em> thou must be greater than Jacob</em> .’ There is something also of Samaritan nationality speaking here. Claiming Jacob as her father ( ὅταν μὲν εὖ πράττοντας βλέπωσι τοὺς Ἰουδαίους , συγγενεῖς ἀποκαλοῦσιν , ὡς ἐξ Ἰωσήπου φύντες , ὅταν δὲ πταίσαντας ἴδωσιν , οὐδαμόθεν αὑτοῖς προσήκειν λέγουσιν , Jos. Antt. ix. 14. 3), she expresses by this question an appropriation of descent from him, such as almost to exclude, or at all events set at a greater distance, the Jews, to one of whom she believed herself to be speaking.
