 11, 12. ] Though  κύριε is not to be pressed as emphatic, it is not without import; it surely betokens a different regard of the stranger than  σὺ Ἰουδαῖος ὤν did; κύριον αὐτὸν προσηγόρευσε , νομίσασα μέγαν εἶναί τινα . Euthym [61] The course of her thoughts appears to be: ‘  Thou canst not mean living water ( ἀναβλύζον καὶ ἁλλόμενον , Euthym [62] ),  from  this  well, because thou hast no vessel to draw with, and it is deep; whence then hast thou (knowest thou of, drawest thou)  the living water of which thou speakest? Our father Jacob was contented with  this ,  used it, and bequeathed it to us: if thou hast better water, and canst give it (notice the ἔδωκεν in both verses),  thou must be greater than Jacob .’ There is something also of Samaritan nationality speaking here. Claiming Jacob as her father ( ὅταν μὲν εὖ πράττοντας βλέπωσι τοὺς Ἰουδαίους , συγγενεῖς ἀποκαλοῦσιν , ὡς ἐξ Ἰωσήπου φύντες , ὅταν δὲ πταίσαντας ἴδωσιν , οὐδαμόθεν αὑτοῖς προσήκειν λέγουσιν , Jos. Antt. ix. 14. 3), she expresses by this question an appropriation of descent from him, such as almost to exclude, or at all events set at a greater distance, the Jews, to one of whom she believed herself to be speaking.
