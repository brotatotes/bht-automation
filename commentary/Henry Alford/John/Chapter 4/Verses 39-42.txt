<p><strong> 39 42.</strong> ] The truth of the saying of Joh 4:35 begins to be manifested. These Samaritans were the foundation of the church afterwards built up there. It does not seem that any miracle was wrought there: αὐτοὶ ἀκηκόαμεν was enough to raise their faith to a point never attained by the Jews, and hardly as yet by the disciples, that He was the Saviour of <em> the world</em> . Their view seems to have been less clouded by prejudice and narrow-mindedness than that of the Jews; and though the conversion of this people lay not in the plan of the official life of our Lord, or working of His Apostles during it (see Mat 10:5 ), yet we have abundant proof from this history, of His gracious purposes towards them. A trace of this occurrence may be found ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48">John 8:48</span> , where see note. Compare throughout <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:1-25">Acts 8:1-25</span> . (In Joh 4:42 λαλιά is perhaps not to be distinguished from λόγος before: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:43">John 8:43</span> . But it is hardly possible not to see in the word something of allusion to the woman’s eager and diffuse report to them.)</p>
