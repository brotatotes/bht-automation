<p><strong> 47, 48.</strong> ] This miracle is a notable instance of our Lord ‘not quenching the smoking flax:’ just as His reproof of the Samaritan woman was of His ‘not breaking the bruised reed.’ The little spark of faith in the breast of this nobleman is by Him lit up into a clear and enduring flame for the light and comfort of himself and his house.

<p>The charge brought against them, <strong> ἐὰν μὴ</strong> κ . τ . λ ., does not imply, as some (Raphel and Storr) think, that they would not believe signs and wonders <em> heard of</em> , but required to <em> see</em> them (thus laying the stress on <strong> ἴδητε</strong> ) for in this case the expression would certainly have been fuller, ἴδητε τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς , or something similar; and it would not accord with our Lord’s known low estimate of all <em> mere miracle-faith</em> , to find Him making so weighty a difference between faith from miracles <em> seen</em> and faith from miracles <em> heard</em> . The words imply the contrast between the Samaritans, who believed <em> because of His word</em> , and the Jews (the plural reckoning the βασιλικός among them), who would not believe but <em> through signs and prodigies:</em> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:22">1 Corinthians 1:22</span> . And observe also that it is not implied that even when they had seen signs and wonders, they would believe: the required these as a condition of their faith, but even these were rejected by them: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:37">John 12:37</span> .

<p>But even with such inadequate conception and conditions of faith, our Lord receives the nobleman, and works the sign rather than dismiss him. It was otherwise in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span> ff.</p>
