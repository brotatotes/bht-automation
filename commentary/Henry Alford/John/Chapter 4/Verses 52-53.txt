<p><strong> 52, 53.</strong> ] <strong> κομψῶς ἔχειν</strong> in this sense is found in Arrian. Dissert. Epictet. iii. 10, cited by most of the Commentators. ὅταν ὁ ἰατρὸς εἰσέρχηται , μὴ φοβεῖσθαι τί εἴπῃ · μηδ ʼ ἂν εἴπη , <strong> κομψῶς ἔχεις</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ὑπερχαίρειν … μηδ ʼ ἂν εἴπῃ , <strong> κακῶς ἔχεις</strong> , ἀθυμεῖν .…

<p><strong> ἀφῆκεν αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁ πυρ</strong> .] This was probably more than he expected to hear; and the coincidence of so sudden a recovery with the time at which Jesus had spoken the words to him (after ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὣρᾳ understand ἀφῆκεν αὐτὸν ὁ πυρετός ), raises his faith at length into a full belief of the Power and Goodness and the Messiahship of Him, who had by a word commanded the disease, and it had obeyed. The <strong> ἐπίστευσεν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <em> absolutely</em> , implies that in the fullest sense he and all his <em> became disciples of Jesus</em> . It is very different from ἐπίστευσεν τῷ λόγῳ ὃν εἶπ . Ἰησ . in Joh 4:50 as believing on HIM must be always different from believing on <em> any thing else in the world</em> , be it <em> even His own word or His own ordinances</em> . Here the advocates of the (imaginary see above on Joh 4:6 ) Asiatic division of the hours by St. John, suppose him to have put that division into the mouth of Jews in Galilee. But that division would in reality not help the narrative here at all, as they maintain. The βασιλικός probably set out, as indeed the narrative implies, immediately on hearing our Lord’s assurance, and <em> spent the night on the way</em> . Indeed, curiously enough, Bp. Wordsw. makes him do this, and yet maintains the seventh hour to have been 7 P.M.</p>
