<b> 1. After these things]</b> Lücke remarks that when John wishes to indicate immediate succession, he uses “<i>after this</i>” (or “<i>that</i>”), ch. ii. 12; xi. 7, 11; xix. 28; when mediate, after an interval, “<i>after these things</i>,” ch. iii. 22; v. 14; vi. 1; vii. 1; xix. 38. So that apart from other considerations which would lead us to the same conclusion, we may infer that some interval has elapsed since the last verse of ch. iv.<br><br><b> a feast of the Jews]</b> Few points have been more controverted, than the question,<i> what this feast was</i>. I will give the principal views, and then state my own conclusion. (1) Irenæeus understands it to be the<i> second Passover of our Lord’s ministry</i>. Origen (whose commentary on this chapter is lost) mentions this view, but apparently does not approve it. This is the view of Luther, Grotius, Lightfoot, and others. (2) Cyril of Alexandria, Chrysostom, and others think it to be<i> the Pentecost</i>. This opinion prevailed in the Greek Church; and has found many defenders in modern times. (3) Kepler first suggested the idea that it might be<i> the feast of Purim</i>, (Esth. ix. 21, 26,) almost immediately preceding the Passover (the 14th and 15th of Adar). This has been the general view of the modern chronologists. (4) The<i> feast of Tabernacles</i> has been suggested by Cocceius, and is supported by one of our MSS., but of late date. (5) Kepler and Petavius thought it also possible that the<i> feast of Dedication</i> (see ch. x. 22) might be meant.<br><br> So that almost every Jewish feast finds some supporters. I believe, with Lücke, De Wette, and Tholuck,<i> that we cannot with any probability gather what feast it was</i>. Seeing as I do no distinct datum given in ch. iv. 35, nor again in ch. vi. 1, and finding nothing in this chapter to determine the nature of this feast, I cannot attach any weight to most of the elaborate chronological arguments which have been raised on the subject. It can hardly have been<b> a</b> Passover, both because it is called<b> a</b> feast, not<b> the</b> feast, as in ch. vi. 4, and because if so, we should have an interval of a whole year between this chapter and the next, which is not probable. Nor can it have been the Dedication, in the<i> winter</i>; for then the multitude of sick would have hardly been waiting in the porches of Bethesda. The feast of Purim would nearest agree with the subsequent events; and it seems as if our Lord did not go up to Jerusalem at. the Passover next following (ch. vi. 4; vii. 1), so that no difficulty would be created by the proximity of the two feasts, unless, with De Wette, we believe that the interval was too little for what is related ch. vi. 1–3 to have happened. But it may be doubted, (1) whether it was a general practice to go up to Jerusalem at the Purim: (2) whether our Lord would be likely to observe it, even if it was.<br><br> No reason need be given why St. John does not name the feast; it is quite in accordance with his practice of mentioning nothing that does not concern his subject-matter. Thus the Passover is mentioned ch. ii. 13, because of the<i> buying and selling in the temple</i>; again, ch. vi. 4, to account for the<i> great multitude</i>, and as eminently suiting (see notes) the subject of His discourse there; the feast of Tabernacles, ch. vii. 2, because of the practice alluded to by our Lord in ver. 37; that of the Dedication, ch. x. 22, to account for His being in Solomon’s porch, because it was winter; but in this chapter, where there is nothing alluding to the time or nature of the feast, it is not specified.<br><br><b> Jesus]</b> and probably His disciples: for the same expression is used ch. ii. 13, whereas we find, ch. iii. 22, that His disciples were with Him; compare also ch. vii. 10 and ch. ix. 2.
