See Neh. xiii. 15–19: Exod. xxxi. 13–17: Jer. xvii. 21, 22. And our Lord does not, as in another case (Luke xiii. 15, 16), appeal here to the reasonableness of the deed being done on the Sabbath,<i> saving the sanctity of the Sabbath</i>, but takes altogether loftier ground, as being One greater than the Sabbath. The whole kernel of this incident and discourse is<i> not, that it is lawful to do works of mercy on the Sabbath: but that the Son of God (here) is Lord of the Sabbath.</i>
