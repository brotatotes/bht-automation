 13. ] Difficulty has been found here from the supposed improbability that some should not have told him, seeing that Jesus was by this time well known in Jerusalem. But this is wholly unnecessary. His fame had not been so spread yet, but that He might during the crowd of strangers at the feast pass unnoticed.
	 ἐξένευσεν  ,  passed on unobserved: just spoke the healing words, and then went on among the crowd; so that no particular attention was attracted to Himself, either by the sick man or others.  The context requires this interpretation: being violated by the ordinary one, that Jesus ‘  conveyed himself away , because a multitude was in the place:’ for that would imply that attention had been attracted towards him which He wished to avoid; and in that case he could hardly fail to have been known to the man and to others. Observe, ἐξένευσεν has for its understood  object, the man subjectively;  escaped his notice, a crowd  being in the place: not referring to any thing which Jesus had  done himself.
