<b> 18.]</b> The ground of the charge is now shifted; and by these last words (ver. 17), occasion is given for one of our Lord’s most weighty discourses.<br><br> The Jews understood His words to mean nothing short of<i> peculiar personal Sonship</i>, and thus equality of nature wit!God. And that this their understanding<i> was the right one</i>, the discourse testifies.<i> All might in one sense, and the Jews did in a closer sense</i>, call God<i> their, or our, Father</i>; but they at once said that the individual use of ‘MY FATHER’ by Jesus had a totally distinct, and in their view a blasphemous, meaning: this latter especially, because He thus made God a participator in His crime of breaking the sabbath. Thus we obtain from the adversaries of the faith a most important statement of one of its highest and holiest doctrines.
