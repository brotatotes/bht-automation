<b> 19.]</b> The discourse is a wonderful setting forth of the Person and Office of the Son of God in His Ministrations as the Word of the Father. It still has reference to the charge of working on the Sabbath, and the context takes in our Lord’s answer both to this, ver. 17, and to the Jews’ accusation, ver. 18. In this verse, He states that He cannot work any but the works of God:<i> cannot</i>, by his very relationship to the Father, by the very nature and necessity of the case;—the working<b> of himself</b> being an impossible supposition, and purposely set here to express one:—the Son<i> cannot</i> work of Himself, because<i> He is</i> the Son: His very Person presupposes the Father’s will and counsel as His will and counsel,—and His. perfect<i> knowledge</i> of that will and counsel. And this, because every<i> creature</i> may abuse its freedom, and will contrary to God: but THE SON, standing in essential unity with God, cannot, even when become Man, commit sin,—break the Sabbath; for His whole Being and Working is in and of God.<br><br><b> for what things soever...]</b> This clause<i> converts</i> the former proposition, and asserts its truth when thus converted. ‘<i>For</i> it is the very nature of the Son to do whatever the Father doeth.’ Also, to do these works<b> in like manner;</b> after the same plan and proceeding, so that there can be no discord, but unity.
