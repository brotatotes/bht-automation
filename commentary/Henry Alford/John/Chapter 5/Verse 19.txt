<p><strong> 19.</strong> ] The discourse is a wonderful setting forth of the Person and Office of the Son of God in His Ministrations as the Word of the Father.

In this verse, He states that He cannot work any but the works of God: <em> cannot</em> , by his very relationship to the Father, by the very nature and necessity of the case; the <strong> ἀφ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἑαυτοῦ</strong> being an impossible supposition, and purposely set here to express one: the Son <em> cannot</em> work of Himself, because <em> He is</em> the Son: His very Person presupposes the Father’s will and counsel as <em> His</em> will and counsel, and His perfect <em> knowledge</em> of that will and counsel. And this, because every <em> creature</em> may abuse its freedom, and <em> will contrary to God:</em> but THE SON, standing in essential unity with God, cannot, even when become Man, commit sin, break the Sabbath; for His whole Being and Working is in and of God.
