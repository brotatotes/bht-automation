<b> 2.]</b> The expression<b> there is</b> has been thought to import that St. John wrote his Gospel<i> before the destruction of Jerusalem</i>. But this must not be pressed. He might have spoken in the present without meaning to be literally accurate with regard to the moment when he was writing.<br><br> The locality given means, probably,<b> near the sheep-gate</b>,—mentioned by Nehemiah, see reff. The situation of this gate is unknown;—it is traditionally supposed to be the same with that now called St. Stephen’s gate; but inaccurately, for no wall existed in that quarter till the time of Agrippa. Eusebius, Jerome, and the Jerusalem Itinerary speak of a<i> sheep-pool</i>, as indeed the Vai. gate renders here.<br><br><b> Bethesda</b>,—in Syriac,<b> the house</b> (place)<b> of mercy</b>, or<b> of grace</b>. Its present situation is very uncertain. Robinson established by personal inspection the fact of the subterranean connexion of the pool of Siloam (see ch. ix. 7 note) and that called the Fountain of the Virgin; and has made it probable that the Fountain under the grand Mosk is also connected with them; in fact that all these are but one and the same spring. Now this spring, as he himself witnessed, is an<i> intermittent</i> one, as indeed had been reported before by Jerome, Prudentius, William of Tyre, and others. There might have been then, it is obvious, some artificially constructed basin in connexion with this spring, the site and memory of which have perished, which would present. the phenomenon here described.<br><br> I have received an interesting communication from a traveller who believes that he has identified Bethesda in the present pool of Siloam. It appears from his account: that there are still visible four bases of pillars in the middle of the water, and four corresponding ones in the wall, shewing that at one time the pool has been arched over by five equal porches. This pool is, as above noticed, intermittent, and is even now believed to possess a certain medicinal power. See the account of my informant. at length at the end of vol. i., edn. 5, of my Greek Testament.<br><br> The spot now traditionally known as Bethesda is a part of the fosse round the fort or tower Antonia, an immense reservoir or trench, seventy-five feet deep. But, as Robinson observes, there is not the slightest evidence that can identify it with the Bethesda of the N.T.<br><br> This pool is not mentioned by Josephus.<br><br><b> having five porches]</b> Probably these were for the shelter of the sick persons, and were arches or porticos, opening upon and surrounding the reservoir: see above.
