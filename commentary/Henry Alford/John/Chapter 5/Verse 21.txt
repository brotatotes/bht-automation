 21. ] It is very important to observe the distinction here between the working of the Eternal Son (in creation, e.g.) as He is ἐν οὐρανῷ , with God, and His working in the state of His humiliation in which the Father should by degrees advance Him to exaltation and put His enemies under His feet. Of the  latter of these mention is made ( Joh 5:20 ) in the  future , of the  former in the  present . The former belong to the Son as His proper and essential work: the latter are opened out before Him in the process of His passing onward in the humanity which He has taken. And the unfolding of these latter shall all be in the direction of, and in accordance with, the eternal attributes of the Son: see ch. John 17:5 : resulting in His being exalted to the right hand of the Father. So here, as it is the Father’s essential work to vivify the dead (see Romans 8:11 ; 1Sa 2:6 alli [82] .), so the Son vivifies whom He will: this last  οὓς θέλει not implying any selection out of mankind, nor said merely to remove the Jewish prejudice that their own nation alone should rise from the dead, but meaning, that in every instance where  His will is to vivify , the result invariably follows.

	Observe, this  ζωοποιεῖ lays hold of life in its innermost and deepest sense, and thus finds its illustration in the waking both of the  outwardly and the  spiritually dead.
