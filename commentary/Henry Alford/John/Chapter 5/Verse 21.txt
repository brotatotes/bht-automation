<b> 21.]</b> It is very important to observe the distinction here between the working of the Eternal Son (in creation, e.g.) as He is “<i>in heaven</i>” with God, and His working in the state of His humiliation, in which the Father should by degrees advance Him to exaltation and put His enemies under His feet. Of the latter of these mention is made (ver. 20) in the<i> future</i>, of the<i> former</i> in the<i> present</i>. The former belong to the Son as His proper and essential work: the latter are opened out before Him in the process of His passing onward in the humanity which He has taken. And the unfolding of these latter shall all be in the direction of, and in accordance with, the eternal attributes of the Son: see ch. xvii. 6; resulting in His being exalted to the right hand of the Father. So here,—as it is the Father’s essential work to vivify the dead (see Rom. viii, 11; 1 Sam. ii. 6 al.), so the Son vivifies whom He will: this last<b> whom He will</b> not implying any selection out of mankind, nor said merely to remove the Jewish prejudice that their own nation alone should rise from the dead,—but meaning, that in every instance where<i> His will is to vivify</i>, the result invariably follows.
