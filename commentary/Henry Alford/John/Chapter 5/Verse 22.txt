<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] In the <strong> οὐδὲ γάρ</strong> is implied that as the Father does not Himself, by His own proper act, <em> vivify</em> any, but commits all quickening power to the Son: so is it with judgment also. And <em> judgment</em> contains eminently in itself the οὓς θέλει , when ζωοπ . is understood as it must be <em> now</em> of <em> bestowing everlasting life</em> . Again; the raising of the <em> outwardly dead</em> is to be understood as a sign that He who works it is appointed Judge of quick and dead, for it is a part of the office of that Judge; <em> in the vivifying, the judgment is made:</em> see below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+72:1-4">Psalms 72:1-4</span> .</p>
