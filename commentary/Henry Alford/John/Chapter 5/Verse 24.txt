<b> 24.]</b> What follows, to ver. 30 inclusive, is an expansion of the two assertions in vv. 21, 22,—the<b> quickening</b> and the<b> judging</b>,—intimately bound up as they are together. There is a parallelism in verses 24 and 25 which should be noticed for the right understanding of the words. “<i>He that</i><b> heareth</b><i> my word</i>,” in the one, answers to “<i>the dead shall</i><b> hear</b><i> the voice of the Son of God</i>” in the other. It isa Kind of<i> hearing</i> which awakens to life,—one accompanied by “<i>believing Him that sent Me</i>.” And this last is not barely ‘Him who sent Me,’ but Him,<i> the very essence of belief in Whom is in this</i>, THAT HE SENT ME (see ch. xii. 44). And the expression<b> believeth Him</b> (not<i> ‘on</i> Him,” which is quite unauthorized by the original) expresses that belief in the<i> testimony</i> of God that He hath sent His Son, which is dwelt ou so much 1 John v. 9–12, where, ver. 10, we have the same expression, “<i>he that believeth not God</i>,” even in the A.V.<br><br><b> hath everlasting life</b>: so 1 John y. 12, 13. The<b> believing</b>, and the<b> having everlasting life</b>, are<i> commensurate</i>:—where the faith is, the possession of eternal life is:—and when the one remits, the other is forfeited. But here the faith is set before us as an<i> enduring faith</i>, and its effects described<i> in their completion</i> (see Eph. i. 19, 20).<br><br><b> cometh not into judgment]</b><i> Judgment</i> being the<i> separation</i>,—the effect of which is to gather out of the Kingdom<i> all that offendeth</i>;—and thus regarding especially the<i> damnatory</i> part of judgment,—he who believes<i> comes not into</i>, has no concern with, judgment. Compare Ps. cxliii. 2. The reckoning which ends with “<i>Well done, good servant</i>,” is not<i> judgment: the reward is of free grace.</i> In this sense, the believers in Christ will not be judged according to their works: they are justified before God by faith, and<i> by God—God is he that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?</i> Their ‘passage over’ from death into life<i> has already taken place</i>,—from the state of spiritual death into that<i> everlasting life</i>, which in their believing state they<i> have</i> already. It is to be observed that our Lord speaks in very similar terms of the unbelieving being<i> condemned already</i>, in ch. iii. 18.<br><br> The<i> perfect</i> sense of the word<b> hath passed</b> must not be weakened nor explained away.
