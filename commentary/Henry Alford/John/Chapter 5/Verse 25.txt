 25. ] This verse continues to refer to  spiritual awakening from the dead. The  ἔρχεται ὥρα κ  .   νῦν ἐστιν is an expression (see ref.) used of those things which are to characterize the spiritual Kingdom of Christ, which was even now begun among men, but not yet brought (until the day of Pentecost, Acts 2:0 ) to its completion. Thus  it cometh, in its fulness, and  even now is begun.
	 οἱ νεκροί  , in reference to ἐκ θανάτον of the preceding verse  the  spiritually  dead: see below on John 5:28 .
	 τῆς φωνῆς  , His  call to awake , in its widest and deepest sense; by His own preaching, by His Apostles, His ministers, &c. &c. In all these He speaks to the spiritually dead.
	 οἱ ἀκούσ  . ] Not ἀκούσαντες  merely , which would be ‘and having heard it, shall live:’ but  οἱ ἀκούσ .,  and THEY WHO  have heard it (or,  who hear it) shall live.  This determines the verse to be spoken of spiritual, not bodily awakening.
	 οἱ ἀκούσαντες are the persons to whom the Lord cried so often ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν , ἀκουέτω : the persons who stand opposed to those addressed in John 5:40 , οὐ θέλετε ἐλθεῖν πρός με , ἴνα ζωὴν ἔχητε .
	 ζήσουσιν is explained in the next verse.
