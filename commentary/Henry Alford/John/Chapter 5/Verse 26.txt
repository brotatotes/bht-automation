We have here again<i> vivifying</i> and<i> judging</i> bound together as the two great departments of the Son’s working;—the former, as substantiating the word “<i>shall live</i>” just uttered; the latter, as leading on to the great announcement of the next verse, But the two departments spring from<i> two distinct sources</i>, united in the Person of the Incarnate Son of God. The Father hath given Him to have life in Himself,<i> as He is</i> THE SON OF GOD. We have none of us<i> life in ourselves</i>:<i> in Him</i> we live and move and have our being. But He, as the Father is, is the<i> source</i> of Life.
