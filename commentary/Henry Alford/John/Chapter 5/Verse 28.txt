<b> 28.] Marvel not at this</b>, as in ch. iii, 7, introduces a matter of even<i> greater</i> wonder to them;—the astounding proof which shall be given in the face of the universe that this is so.<br><br><b> the hour cometh</b>, but not “<i>and now is</i>” this time,—because He is<i> now speaking</i> of the great day of the resurrection: when not merely “<i>the dead</i>,” but<b> all that are in the graves</b>, shall hear His voice, and “<i>they that have heard</i>” are not specified, because<i> all</i> shall<i> hear</i> in the fullest sense. Observe that here, as elsewhere, when the judgment according to<i> works</i> is spoken of, it is the great<i> general</i> resurrection of Matt. xxv. 31–46, which (and the notes) compare. So here we have not “<i>they that have believed</i>,” and “<i>they that have not believed</i>,” but the descriptions reach far wider, including indeed in this most general form the first resurrection unto life also—and the two great classes are described as<i> they that have done (wrought) good</i> and<i> they that have done (practised</i>, see on ch. iii. 20, 21) evil (<i>vain, worthless things</i>).<br><br> Observe that<i> life</i> and<i> judgment</i> stand opposed here, as in ver. 24:—not that there is<i> no such thing</i> as a<i> resurrection of death</i>, but that<i> it is involved in this judgment</i>. Olshausen observes that this, and Acts xxiv. 15, are the only<i> direct</i> declarations in the N.T. of a<i> bodily resurrection of the unjust</i> as well as of the just. It is implied in some places, e.g. Matt. x. 28, and less plainly in Matt. xxv. 34 ff.: Rev. xx 5, 12, and directly asserted in the O.T., Dan. xii. 2. In 1 Cor. xv.,—as the object was to convince<i> believers in Christ</i> of the truth of the resurrection of<i> their</i> bodies,—no allusion is made to those who are not believers.
