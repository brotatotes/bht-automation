 32. ]  ἄλλος can, by the inner coherence of the discourse, be no other than THE FATHER, of Whom so much has been said in the former part, but Who is hinted at rather than mentioned in  this ( πατρός in Joh 5:30 is spurious).  It cannot be John , from whom ( Joh 5:34 ) our Lord  took not his testimony . Similar modes of alluding to the Father occur ch. John 8:50 : see also ch. John 8:18 , and Mat 10:28 and [83] . Many interpreters however understand it of  John , Chrysostom, Nonnus, Theophylact, Euthym [84] : and lately De Wette has defended the view with some acuteness. But he has certainly missed the inner coherence of the passage. The reason why our Lord mentions John is not ‘as ascending from the lesser witness to the greater,’ but  purposely to remove the idea that He meant  him only or principally by these words , and to set his testimony in its right place: then at Joh 5:36 He returns again to the ἄλλος μαρ . περὶ ἐμοῦ .
	 [83] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .

	 καὶ σἶδα  .… ] This is the Son’s testimony to the Father’s truth: see ch. ( Joh 3:33 ) John 7:28 ; John 8:26 ; John 8:55 . It testifies to the full consciousness on the part of the Son, even in the days of his humiliation, of the righteousness of the Father: and (for the testimony of the Father to the Son is contained in the Scriptures) also to His distinct recognition and approval ( Psa 40:6-8 ) of psalm and type and prophecy, as applied to Himself and His work.
