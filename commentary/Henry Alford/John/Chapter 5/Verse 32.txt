<p><strong> 32.</strong> ] <strong> ἄλλος</strong> can, by the inner coherence of the discourse, be no other than THE FATHER, of Whom so much has been said in the former part, but Who is hinted at rather than mentioned in <em> this</em> ( πατρός in Joh 5:30 is spurious). <em> It cannot be John</em> , from whom ( Joh 5:34 ) our Lord <em> took not his testimony</em> . Similar modes of alluding to the Father occur ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:50">John 8:50</span> : see also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:18">John 8:18</span> , and Mat 10:28 and [83] . Many interpreters however understand it of <em> John</em> , Chrysostom, Nonnus, Theophylact, Euthym [84] : and lately De Wette has defended the view with some acuteness. But he has certainly missed the inner coherence of the passage. The reason why our Lord mentions John is not ‘as ascending from the lesser witness to the greater,’ but <em> purposely to remove the idea that He meant</em> <em> him only or principally by these words</em> , and to set his testimony in its right place: then at Joh 5:36 He returns again to the ἄλλος μαρ . περὶ ἐμοῦ .

It testifies to the full consciousness on the part of the Son, even in the days of his humiliation, of the righteousness of the Father: and (for the testimony of the Father to the Son is contained in the Scriptures) also to His distinct recognition and approval ( Psa 40:6-8 ) of psalm and type and prophecy, as applied to Himself and His work.</p>
