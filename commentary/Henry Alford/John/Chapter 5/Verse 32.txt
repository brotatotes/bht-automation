<b> 32.]</b> This<b> other</b> can, by the inner coherence of the discourse, be no other than THE FATHER, of Whom so much has been said in the former part, but Who is hinted at rather than mentioned in<i> this</i> (the word “<i>Father</i>” in ver. 80 being spurious).<i> It cannot be John,</i>—from whom (ver. 34) our Lord<i> took not his testimony</i>. Similar modes of alluding to the Father occur ch. 50: see also ch. viii. 18, and Matt. x. 28 and parallel places.<br><br><b> and I know...]</b> This is the Son’s testimony to the Father’s truth: see ch. (iii. 38) vii. 28; viii, 26, 55. It testifies to the full consciousness on the part of the Son, even in the days of his humiliation, of the righteousness of the Father: and (for the testimony of the Father to the Son is contained in the Scriptures) also to His distinct recognition and approval (Ps. xl. 6–8) of psalm and type and prophecy, as applied to Himself and His work.
