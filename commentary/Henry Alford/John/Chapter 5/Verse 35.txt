In Ecclus. xlviii. 1 we read of him, “<i>Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burned like a lamp</i>,” which Stier thinks may be referred to here. We may, as indeed he also suggests, believe that those words represent or gave rise to a common way of speaking of Elias, as certain Rabbis were called ‘The candle of the Law,’&c. De Wette takes the article as meaning, ‘<i>the lamp which was to lead you</i>,’&c.<br><br> On John as the light<i> lighted</i> not<i> lighting</i>, see note, ch. i. 8.<br><br><b> and shining]</b> The description sets forth the<i> derived</i>, and<i> transitory</i> nature of John’s light.<br><br><b> and ye....]</b> See Ezek. xxxiii, 30, 32. ‘But you wished only to disport yourselves in his light for a time—came out to him in crowds at first,—and—like silly children who play with the fire till it burns and hurts them, and then shrink from and loathe it,—when he began to speak of deep repentance as the preparation for God’s Kingdom, and laid the axe to the root of the trees, you left him.’ No one cared, when he was imprisoned and put to death. And even those few who remained true to him, did not follow his direction to Christ. For the mass of the people, and their leaders, his mission was in vain.
