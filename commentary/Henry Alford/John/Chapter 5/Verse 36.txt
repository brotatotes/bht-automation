<b> 36.]</b> Literally,<b> I have my witness greater than John</b>; or,<i> than that of John</i>;—but perhaps this is not needed, for John himself<i> was</i> a testimony.<br><br><b> for the works</b>, not<i> His miracles alone</i>, although those principally; but<i> the whole of His life and course of action</i>, full as it was of holiness, in which, and as forming harmonious parts of which, His miracles were testimonies of His divine mission. His<i> greatest work</i> (ch. vi. 29) was the awakening of faith, the<i> quickening</i> of which we have heard before, to which the miracles were but as means to an end.<br><br><b> the same works that I do]</b> The repetition is to shew that His life and working was an exact fulfilment of the Father’s will.<b> The works which the Father hath given me to do, those very works which I am doing.....</b><b> 37–39.]</b> The connexion of these verses has been much disputed. I believe it will be found to be this: ‘The works of which I have spoken, are only<i> indirect</i> testimonies; the Father Himself, who sent Me, has given<i> direct</i> testimony concerning Me. Now that testimony cannot be derived by you, nor any man, by direct<i> communication</i> with Him; for ye have never heard His voice nor seen His shape. (Or perhaps,—have not heard His voice, as your fathers did from Sinai,—nor seen His visional appearance, as the Prophets did.) Nor (ver. 38),<i> in your case</i>, has it been given by that<i> inward witness</i> (ch. iii. 33 5 1 John iv. 13, 14) which those have (and had in a measure, even before the gift of the Spirit—see, among other places, Ps. li. 11), in whom His word abides; for ye have not His word abiding in you, not believing on Him whom He hath sent. Yet (ver. 39) there is a form of this direct testimony of the Father, accessible even to you;— “<i>Search the Scriptures</i>,”&c.’ Chrysostom and others understand the word<b> voice</b> to refer to<i> the voice at our Lord’s baptism</i>: but, as Lücke observes, the addition,<b> at any time</b>, forbids this. Observe that the testimony in the Scriptures is not the only, nor the chief one,<i> intended</i> in ver. 37, but the direct testimony<i> in the heart of the believer</i>;—which, as the Jews<i> have not,</i> they are directed to<i> another form</i> of the Father’s testimony,<i> that in the Scriptures</i>.
