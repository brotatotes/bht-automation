<b> 39.]</b> The word<b> Search</b> may be<i> indicative</i>,<b> Ye search</b>: then the sense will be, ‘<i>Ye search the Scriptures, for ye believe ye have&c., and they are they that testify of Me: and (yet</i>, ver. 40)<i> ye will not come to Me that ye may have life:</i>’ or<i> imperative</i>, as in the text, in which case generally a period has been placed after me, and a fresh sentence begins at<b> And yet ye are not willing....</b> Authorities are very divided between these: the Greek Fathers, who should best understand their own language, took them (with one remarkable exception, Cyril of Alexandria) as<i> imperative</i>. And I believe the<i> imperative sense only</i> will be found to cohere with the previous verses:—see above, where I have given the context. And no other sense will suit the word<b> search</b>: which cannot be used, as in the indicative it would be, with blame attached to it,— ‘<i>ye make nice and frivolous search into the letter of Scripture</i>;’ but implies<i> a thorough search</i> (see also 1 Pet. i. 11)<i> into the contents and spirit of Seripture</i>.<br><br><i> Ye</i> (emphatic)<b> imagine that</b><i> in them</i> (emphatic)<b> ye have eternal life</b>. We may find testimonies to this from the Rabbis: “<i>He who acquires the words of the law, acquires for himself eternal life</i>,”&c. But they, like all other secondary ordinances, have a spiritual end in view, and that end is to testify, from first to last (it is<i> their office</i>);<i> they are they that testify</i> of ME.
