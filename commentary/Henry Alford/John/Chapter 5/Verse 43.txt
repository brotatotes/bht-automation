This<b> another</b> is in strong contrast with the “<i>another</i>” of ver. 32. ‘The testimony of that Other, who is greater than I, ye will not receive; but if another come in his own name, him ye will receive.’ The words are perhaps spoken primarily of the false or Idol-Messiah, the Antichrist, who shall appear in the latter days (2 Thess. ii. 8–12); whose appearance shall be<i> according to the working of Satan</i> (their<i> father</i>, ch. viii. 44),<i> shewing himself that he is God</i>, 2 Thess. ii. 4;—and doubtless,<i> in</i> that their final reference, embrace also all the cases in which the Jews<i> have</i> more or less<i> received</i> those false Messiahs who have been foreshadowers of the great Antichrist, and indeed all the cases in which<i> such a spirit</i> has been shewn by them, even in the absence of false Messiahs.
