 43. ] The first clause is clear. In the latter we have a prophetic declaration regarding the Jews in the latter days. This  ἄλλος is in strong contrast with the ἄλλος of John 5:32 . ‘The testimony of that Other, who is greater than I, ye will not receive; but if another come in his own name, him ye will receive.’ The words are perhaps spoken primarily of the false or Idol-Messiah, the Antichrist, who shall appear in the latter days ( 2Th 2:8-12 ); whose appearance shall be κατ ʼ ἐνέργειαν τοῦ σατανᾶ (their  father , ch. Joh 8:44 ),  ἀποδεικνὺς ἑαυτὸν ὅτι ἐστὶν θεός  , 2 Thessalonians 2:4 ; and doubtless,  in that their final reference, embrace also all the cases in which the Jews  have more or less  received those false Messiahs who have been foreshadowers of the great Antichrist, and indeed all the cases in which  such a spirit has been shewn by them, even in the absence of false Messiahs.
