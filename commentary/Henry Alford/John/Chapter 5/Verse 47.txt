 47. ]  γράμμασιν here does not,  in the sense , = γραφαῖς : for ταῖς ἐκείνου γραφαῖς could not be used; the  γραφή being ἡ θεία γραφή , not ( ἡ τοῦ ) Μωυσέως γραφή , but the  γράμματα were those of Moses; the outward expression of the γραφή , the letters, and words, as found on paper: just as the ῥήματα in the other case are the outward expression of the λόγος . The meaning is: ‘men give greater weight to what is written and published, the letter of a book, than to mere word of mouth; and ye in particular give greater honour to Moses, than to Me: if then ye believe not what  he has written, which comes down to you hallowed by the reverence of ages, how can you believe the words which are uttered by Me, to whom you are hostile?’ This however is not all:  Moses leads to Christ: is one of the witnesses by which the Father hath testified of Him: ‘if then ye have rejected the  means , how shall ye reach the  end? ’ ‘If your unbelief has stopped the path, how shall ye arrive at Him to whom it leads?’ Meyer is quite right in maintaining that the opposition does not lie between γράμμασιν and ῥήμασιν , but between ἐκείνου and τοῖς ἐμοῖς .
