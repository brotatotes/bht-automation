 26, 27. ] We have here again ζωοποιεῖν and κρίνειν bound together as the two great departments of the Son’s working; the former, as substantiating the ζήσουσιν just uttered; the latter, as leading on to the great announcement of the next verse. But the two departments spring from  two distinct sources , united in the Person of the Incarnate Son of God. The Father hath given Him to have life in Himself,  as He is THE SON OF GOD.  We have none of us  life in ourselves: in Him we live and move and have our being. But He, as the Father is, is the  source of Life. Then again the Father hath given Him power to pass judgment,  because He is THE SON OF MAN; man is to be judged by Man, by that Man whom God hath appointed, who is the inclusive Head of humanity, and to whom mankind, and man’s  world , pertain by right of covenant-purchase. This κρίσιν  ποιεῖν leads the thought to the  great occasion when judgment shall be executed; which accordingly is treated of in the next verse.
