 28, 29. ]  μὴ θαυμ  ., as ch. John 3:7 , introduces a matter of even  greater wonder to them; the astounding proof which shall be given in the face of the universe that this is so.
	 ἔρχεται ὥρα  , but not καὶ νῦν ἐστιν this time, because He is  now speaking of the great day of the resurrection: when not merely οἱ νεκροί , but  πάντες οἱ ἐν τοῖς μνημείοις  , shall hear His voice, and  οἱ ἀκούσαντες are not specified, because  all shall  hear in the fullest sense. Observe that here, as elsewhere, when the judgment according to  works is spoken of, it is the great  general resurrection of Matthew 25:31-46 , which (and the notes) compare. So here we have not οἱ πιστεύσαντες and οἱ μὴ πιστεύσαντες , but the categories reach far wider, including indeed in this most general form the first resurrection unto life also and the two great classes are described as  οἱ τὰ ἀγ  .   ποιήσαντες and  οἱ τὰ φαῦλα πράξαντες  .
	On the difference between ποιεω and πράσσω , see note on ch. John 3:20-21 .
	Observe, that  ζωή and  κρίσις stand opposed here, as in John 5:24 : not that there is  no such thing as an ἀνάστασις θανάτου (Schleiermacher, in Stier, iv. 194, edn. 2), but that  it is involved in this κρίσις .
	Olshausen observes (ii. 153) that this, and Acts 24:15 , are the only  direct declarations in the N.T. of a  bodily resurrection of the unjust as well as of the just. It is implied in some places, e.g. Matthew 10:28 , and less plamly in Matthew 25:34 ff.: Revelation 20:5 ; Revelation 20:12 , and directly asserted in the O.T., Daniel 12:2 . In 1 Corinthians 15:0 , as the object was to convince  believers in Christ of the truth of the resurrection of  their bodies, no allusion is made to those who are not believers.
