<p><strong> 37 39.</strong> ] The connexion of these verses has been much disputed. I believe it will be found to be this: ‘The works of which I have spoken, are only <em> indirect</em> testimonies; the Father Himself, who sent Me, has given <em> direct</em> testimony concerning Me. Now that testimony cannot be derived by you, nor any man, by direct <em> communication</em> with Him; for ye have never heard His voice nor seen His shape. (Or perhaps have not heard His voice, as your fathers did from Sinai, nor seen His visional appearance, as the Prophets did.) Nor ( Joh 5:38 ), <em> in your case</em> , has it been given by that <em> inward witness</em> (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:33">John 3:33</span> : 1Jn 4:13-14 ) which those have (and had in a measure, even before the gift of the Spirit see inter alli [85] ., Psa 51:11 ) in whom His word abides; for ye have not His word abiding in you, not believing on Him whom He hath sent. Yet ( Joh 5:39 ) there is <em> a form</em> of this direct testimony of the Father, accessible even to you; ‘ <em> search the Scriptures</em> ,’ &amp;c. Chrysostom, Euthymius, Lampe, Bengel, &amp;c., understand <strong> φωνή</strong> to refer to <em> the voice at our Lord’s baptism:</em> but, as Lücke observes, <strong> πώποτε</strong> forbids this. I may also add that the perfect, <strong> ἀκηκόατε</strong> <strong> ,</strong> excludes it. Had reference been to a <em> distinct event</em> , it must have been ἠκούσατε , and (Lücke) τὴν φωνήν .

<p>Observe that the testimony in the Scriptures is not the only, nor the chief one, <em> intended</em> in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:37">John 5:37</span> , but (as De Wette well maintains) the direct testimony <em> in the heart of the believer;</em> which, as the Jews <em> have not</em> , they are directed to <em> another form</em> of the Father’s testimony, <em> that in the Scriptures</em> .

<p><strong> ἐραυνᾶτε</strong> <strong> ,</strong> either <em> indicative</em> (Cyril, Erasm., Beza, Lampe, Bengel, Kuinoel, Lücke, Tholuck, Olshausen, De Wette), ‘ <em> Ye search the Scriptures, for ye believe ye have &amp;c., and they are they that testify of Me, and</em> ( <em> yet</em> , Joh 5:40 ) <em> ye will not come to Me that ye may have life:</em> ’ or <em> imperative</em> (Chrys., Theophyl., Euthym [86] , August., Luther, Calvin, Wets [87] ., Paulus, Stier), in which case generally a period has been placed after <strong> ἐμοῦ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and a fresh sentence begins at <strong> καὶ οὐ θέλ</strong> <strong> .

<p>I believe the <em> imperative sense only</em> will be found to cohere with the previous verses: see above, where I have given the context. And no other sense will suit the word ἐραυνᾶτε , which cannot be used, as in the indicative it would be, with blame attached to it, ‘ <em> ye make nice and frivolous search into the letter of Scripture;</em> ’ but, as ἐξερευν . in ref. Ps., implies <em> a thorough search</em> (see also 1Pe 1:11 ) <em> into the contents and spirit</em> of Scripture. Besides, the emphatic position of ἐραυνᾶτε before τὰς γραφάς , while it does not absolutely necessitate the imper. sense, makes it much more probable than the indic., which would be conveyed by τὰς γρ . ἐραυνᾶτε . Luthardt (ii. 21) remarks, that the almost unanimous verdict of the <em> Greek</em> Fathers (Cyril however is a remarkable exception) for the imper. decides him in its favour.
