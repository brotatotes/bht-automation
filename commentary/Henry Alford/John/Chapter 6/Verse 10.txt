And I have therefore substituted in the margin,<b> people</b>. But now it is the word signifying<i> men</i>, as distinguished from women and children. And this is a particular touch of accuracy in the account of an eye-witness, which has not I think been noticed. Why in the other accounts should mention be made only of the<i> men</i> in numbering them? St. Matthew has, it is true, “<i>beside women and children</i>,” leaving it to be inferred that there was some means of distinguishing;—the others merely give “ [<i>about</i>]<i> five thousand men</i>” without any explanation. But here we see how it came to be so—the<i> men alone</i> were arranged in companies, or alone arranged so that<i> any account</i> was taken of them: the women and children being served. promiscuously; who indeed, if the multitude were a paschal caravan (?), or parts of many such, would not be likely to be very numerous;—and here again we have a point of minute truthfulness brought out.
