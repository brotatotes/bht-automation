<b> 19. walking on the sea]</b> There surely can be no question in the mind of an unprejudiced reader, that it is John’s intention to relate a<i> miracle</i>;—nor again,—that there could be in the minds of the disciples<i> no doubt about</i> that miracle,—<i>no chance of a mistake</i> as to what they saw. I have treated of<b> on the sea</b> on Matthew, ver. 25.<br><br> They were afraid:—but upon being reassured by His voice, they were willing to take Him into the ship; and upon their doing so, the ship in a comparatively short time (or perhaps<i> immediately by miracle</i>, but I prefer the other) was at the land to which they had been going, viz. by the storm ceasing, and the ship making smooth way ( “<i>the wind ceased</i>,” Matthew, Mark).<br><br> It seems to me that the above interpretation of “<i>they were willing therefore to receive Him</i>” is absolutely necessary to account for the<b> therefore</b>.<br><br><b> the multitude]</b> We are not to understand<i> the whole multitude who were fed</i>,—but that portion of them which had remained on the coast over the night. Many had probably dispersed to the villages about, or perhaps taken up their night quarters more inland.<br><br><b> on the other side of the sea]</b> i.e. on the east coast. We are supposed to be at Capernaum.<br><br> The<b> other boats</b> had perhaps brought some of them thither: or<i> the spot nigh unto the place where they ate the bread</i>, &c., might have been some landing-place of merchandise.
