<b> 26.]</b> The seeking Him, on the part of these people,—to Him, who saw the hearts,—was merely a low desire to profit by His wonderful works,—not a reasonable consequence of deduction from His miracles that He was the Saviour of the world. And from this low desire of mere satisfaction of their carnal appetite, He takes occasion in the following discourse to raise them to spiritual desire after HIMSELF THE BREAD OF LIFE. The discourse forms a parallel with that in ch. iv. 27.<br><br><b> Work not for]</b> The A.V., ‘<i>Labour not for</i>,’ does not give the sense. They had not laboured in this case for the<i> meat that perisheth</i>, but it had been furnished miraculously. A better rendering would<i> be</i>,<b> Busy not yourselves about,—Do not weary yourselves for</b>,—which they were doing, by thus coming after our Lord: but best of all,<b> Work not for</b>, because in the original the root of the word is the same in verses 27, 29, 30.<br><br><i> “The meat whose nourishing power passes away,”</i> De Wette. Better literally,<b> which perisheth</b>, as in text:—the<i> useless</i> part of it, in being cast out;—the<i> useful</i>, in becoming part of the body which perishes (see 1 Cor. vi. 13).<br><br><b> but for that meat]</b> It is important to bear in mind that the “<i>working for</i>” spoken of above, which also applies to this, was not a ‘<i>labouring for</i>,’ or ‘<i>bringing about of</i>,’ but a following Christ in order to obtain. So the meaning will be,<b> but seek to obtain</b>, by following after Me....<br><br><b> which endureth unto everlasting life]</b> See ch. iv. 14, If this “<i>meat</i>”<i> remains to eternal life,</i> it must be<i> spiritual food</i>.<br><br><b> which the Son of man shall give unto you]</b> See eh. iv. ib.<br><br><b> which</b> agrees with “<i>meat</i>,” not with “<i>life</i>.”<br><br><b> shall give</b>, future, because the great Sacrifice was not yet offered: so in ch. iv.<br><br><b> the Son of man</b>, emphatic here, and belonging to this discourse, since it is of His<i> Flesh</i> that He is about to speak.<br><br><b> for Him the Father sealed, even God]</b> This rendering is made necessary by the grammatical form of the original.<br><br><b> sealed</b>, by<i> undoubted testimony</i>, as at His baptism; and since,<i> by His miracles</i>, see ch. x. 36: not, ‘stamped with the image of His Person,’ which is altogether beside the present subject, and inconsistent with the meaning of the verb.
