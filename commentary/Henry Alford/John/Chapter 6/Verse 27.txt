 27. ]  ἐργάζ  ., imperative: another instance of the construction which I have advocated in ch. John 5:39 .
	The E. V., ‘  Labour not for ,’ does not give the sense of ἐργάζ . They had not  laboured in this case for the βρῶσις ἀπολλυμένη , but it had been furnished miraculously. A better rendering would be,  Busy not yourselves about ,  Do not weary yourselves for, which they were doing, by thus coming after our Lord: [but best of all  Work not for: so as to preserve the connexion between John 6:27 ; John 6:29-30 .]
	 τὴνἀπολλ  . “  whose nourishing power passes away ,” De Wette. Rather perhaps more literally,  which perisheth , E. V.: the  useless part of it, in being cast out; the  useful , in becoming part of the body which perishes (see 1Co 6:13 ).
	 ἀλλὰ τ  .   βρ  . ] It is important to bear in mind that the ἐργάζεσθαι spoken of above, which also applies to this, was not a ‘  working for ,’ or ‘  bringing about of ,’ but a following Christ in order to obtain. So the meaning will be,  but seek to obtain , by following after Me.… And thus μὴ .… ἀγγά keeps its true literal force,  Do not.… but.
	 τὴν μένουσαν εἰς ζ  .   αἰ  . ] See ch. John 4:14 . If this βρῶσις  remains to eternal life , it must be  spiritual food .
	 ἣν  .…   δώσει ] See ch. 4 ib.  ἥν agrees with  βρῶσιν  , not with  ζωήν  .   δώσει  , future, because the great Sacrifice was not yet offered: so in ch. 4.
	 ὁ υἱὸς τ  .   ἀνθρ  ., emphatic here and belonging to this discourse, since it is of His  Flesh that He is about to speak.
	 τοῦτον γὰρ  .… ]  for Him the Father sealed, even God .
	 ἐσφράγ  ., by  undoubted testimony , as at His baptism; and since,  by His miracles , see ch. John 10:36 : not, ‘stamped with the image of His Person,’ which is altogether beside the present subject, and inconsistent with the meaning of σφραγίζω .
