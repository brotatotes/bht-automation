<b> 29.]</b> The meaning is not,—that faith is<i> wrought in us by</i> God, is<i> the work of God</i>; but that the truest way of working the work of God is to believe on Him whom He hath sent.<br><br><b> work</b>, not<i> works</i>, because there is but this one, properly speaking, and all the rest are wrapt up in it (see James i. 25).<br><br> This is a most important saying of our Lord, as containing the germ of that teaching afterwards so fully expanded in the writings of St. Paul. “I know not,” says Schleiermacher, “where we can find any passage, even in the writings of the Apostles, which says so clearly and significantly, that all eternal life in men proceeds from nothing else than faith in Christ.”<br><br> The manna was extolled by the Jews, as the greatest miracle of Moses. Josephus calls it “<i>a divine and wondrous food</i>:” see also Wisd. xvi. 20, 21. “They forgot that their fathers disbelieved Moses almost from the time when they began to eat the manna; and that the Psalm from which they quote most strongly sets forth this;—that they despised the manna, and preferred ordinary meat to it.” Stier.<br><br> Observe our<b> Lord’s believe on</b><i> him</i> in ver. 29, and their<b> believe thee</b>. The former, the casting their whole hopes and faith on Him, is what He requires: but they will not even give the latter, common credence, to Him.<br><br> Their<b> what dost thou work?</b> Meyer remarks, is a retort of our Lord’s question, ver. 27. The stress, in these words, should be not on the<b> thou</b>, which is not expressed in the original, but on the<b> what</b>.
