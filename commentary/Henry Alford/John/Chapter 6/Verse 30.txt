Ibis spoken in unbelief and opposition; not, as many have supposed, as a request for the Bread of Life, meaning<i> it</i> by the sign, but in the ordinary sign-seeking spirit of the Jews. Stier says well, “They have been hesitating between better and worse thoughts, till at last unbelief prevails.” The<b> sign</b> here demanded is the<i> sign from heaven</i>, the proof of the sealing by God; such a proof would be, in their estimation, compared with His present miracles, as the manna (bread<i> from heaven</i>) was, compared to the multiplied loaves and fishes.<br><br>Observe our Lord’s<b> believe on</b><i> him</i> in ver. 29, and their<b> believe thee</b>. The former, the casting their whole hopes and faith on Him, is what He requires: but they will not even give the latter, common credence, to Him.<br><br> Their<b> what dost thou work?</b> Meyer remarks, is a retort of our Lord’s question, ver. 27. The stress, in these words, should be not on the<b> thou</b>, which is not expressed in the original, but on the<b> what</b>.
