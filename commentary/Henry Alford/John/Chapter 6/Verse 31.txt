The manna was extolled by the Jews, as the greatest miracle of Moses. Josephus calls it “<i>a divine and wondrous food</i>:” see also Wisd. xvi. 20, 21. “They forgot that their fathers disbelieved Moses almost from the time when they began to eat the manna; and that the Psalm from which they quote most strongly sets forth this;—that they despised the manna, and preferred ordinary meat to it.” Stier.
