<p><strong> 32.</strong> ] Our Lord lays open the course of their argument. They have not <em> mentioned</em> Moses, nor was the giving of the manna a miracle performed by Moses; but He knew that the comparison between Moses and Himself was in their minds, and answers by exposing the error which represented Moses as the giver of the manna. Neither again was that the true bread from heaven. It was, in one sense, bread from heaven; but not in <em> this</em> sense. It was a type and shadow of the true bread from heaven, <strong> which My Father is giving</strong> ( δίδωσιν , or perhaps the abstract present, <strong> giveth</strong> ) <strong> to you</strong> . Our Lord does not here <em> deny</em> , but <em> asserts</em> the miraculous character of the manna.</p>
