 33. ]  ὁ ἄρτος τοῦ θεοῦ = ὁ ἄρτος ὃν δίδωσιν ὁ πατήρ μου . The words  ὁ καταβ  … are the predicate of ὁ ἄρτος , and do  not apply, in the construction of this verse, to Christ personally , however truly they apply to Him in fact. The E. V. is here wrong: it should be,  The bread of God is  that (not  He )  which cometh, &c.  Not  till  Joh 6:35 does Jesus first say, ‘I AM the bread of life.’ The  manna is still kept in view ὅταν κατέβη ἡ δρόσος …  κατέβαινεν τὸ μάννα ἐπ ʼ αὐτῆς , Numbers 11:9 . And the present participle, here used in reference to the manna, is dropped when the Lord Himself is spoken of: see John 6:38 ; John 6:41 ; John 6:58 , and especially the distinction between Joh 6:50 and John 6:51 (so Lücke, De Wette, Stier, Bengel).
