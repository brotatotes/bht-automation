<b> 33.] the bread of God</b> answers to “<i>the bread which my Father giveth.</i>” The words<b> that which cometh down from heaven</b>.... are the predicate of<b> the bread</b>, and do<i> not apply, in the construction of this verse, to Christ personally,</i> however truly they apply to Him in fact. The A.V. is here wrong: it should be,<b> The bread of God is</b><i> that</i> (not<i> He</i>)<b> which cometh</b>, &c.<i> Not till ver</i>. 35 does Jesus first say, ‘I AM the bread of life.’ The<i> manna</i> is still kept in view, which ‘when the dew fell on the camp....<i> fell</i> (the Greek word in the LXX is the same as here,<b> came down</b>) upon it,’ Num. xi. 9. And the present tense, here used in reference to the manna, is dropped when the Lord Himself is spoken of: see vv. 38, 41, 58, and especially the distinction between ver. 50 and ver. 51.
