	In the genitive  τῆς ζωῆς is implied ὁ καταβὰς ἐκ τοῦ οὐρ . καὶ ζωὴν διδοὺς τῷ κόσμῳ . So ὕδωρ ζῶν in ch. 4.
	On the assurance of  never hungering or thirsting , see note at ch. John 4:14 . It is possible that our Lord placed the all-satisfying bread of life in contrast to the manna, which was  no sooner given , Exodus 16:0 ,  than the people  began to thirst , Exodus 17:0 ; but I would not lay any stress on this.
	 ὁ ἐρχόμ  .   πρ  .   ἐμέ is in the same sense as in ch. Joh 5:40 that of acceptance of and faith in Him.
