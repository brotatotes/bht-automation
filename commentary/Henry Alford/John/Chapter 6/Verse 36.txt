Euthym [90] But perhaps, as Euthym [91] himself seems to suggest, and as Lücke and De Wette are inclined to think, the reference may be to ch. John 5:37-44 , and the  ὑμῖν may be said generally. Stier and others think that Joh 6:26 is referred to: but this is far-fetched. We have instances of reference to sayings not recorded, in ch. John 10:26 ; John 12:34 .
