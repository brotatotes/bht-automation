<p><strong> 36.</strong> ] <strong> εἷπον ὑμῖν</strong> πότε δὲ τοῦτο εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ; εἰκὸς τοῦτο ῥηθῆναι μὲν μὴ γραφῆναι δέ . Euthym [90] But perhaps, as Euthym [91] himself seems to suggest, and as Lücke and De Wette are inclined to think, the reference may be to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:37-44">John 5:37-44</span> , and the <strong> ὑμῖν</strong> may be said generally. Stier and others think that Joh 6:26 is referred to: but this is far-fetched. We have instances of reference to sayings not recorded, in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:26">John 10:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:34">John 12:34</span> .
