 37. ] The whole body of believers on Christ are spoken of by Him, here and in ch. 17,  as given to Him by the Father . But Bengel’s observation is very important: “  πᾶν vocula momentosissima, et, collatis iis quæ sequuntur, consideratu dignissima. Nam in sermonibus Jesu Christi, quod Pater ipsi dedit, id, et singulari numero et neutro genere, appellatur  omne; qui ad ipsum,  Filium , veniunt, ii masculino genere vel etiam plurali numero describuntur,  omnis , vel  illi . Pater Filio totam quasi massam dedit, ut omnes quos dedit unum sint; id universum Filius singulatim evolvit, in exsecutione. Hinc illud in xvii. 2, ut  omne quod dedisti ei,  det eis vitam æternam.” See also 1 John 5:4 . See further on πᾶν ὃ δίδωσίν μοι ὁ πατήρ , John 6:44 .
	 οὐ μὴ ἐκβ  .   ἔξω does not refer here to the office of the Son of God  as Judge; but is another way of expressing the grace and readiness with which He will receive all who come to Him.
