<b> 37.]</b> The whole body of believers on Christ are spoken of by Him, here and in ch. xvii,<i> as given to Him by the Father</i>. But Bengel’s observation is very important: ‘<b>all that which</b>—a most significant expression, and, compared with what follows, most worthy of consideration. For in our Lord’s discourses, that, which the Father hath given Him, is spoken of in the singular number and neuter gender, “<i>all that which</i>:” whereas they who come to Him, the Son, are spoken of in the masculine gender, and sometimes also in the plural number: “<i>every man</i>,” or “<i>all they</i>.” The Father hath given to the Son as it were one mass, that all whom He hath given should be<i> one</i>: that whole mass the Son unfoldeth one by one in this following out of the Father’s design. Hence also that which we read in ch. xvii. 2, “<i>that all that which Thou hast given Him</i> (so literally), to<i> them He may give eternal life</i>.”’ See also 1 John v. 4.<br><br><b> I will in no wise cast out</b> does not refer here to the office of the Son of God<i> as Judge</i>; but is another way of expressing the grace, and readiness with which He will receive all who come to Him.
