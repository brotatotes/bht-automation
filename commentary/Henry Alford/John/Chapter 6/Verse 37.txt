<b> 37.]</b> The whole body of believers on Christ are spoken of by Him, here and in ch. xvii,<i> as given to Him by the Father</i>. But Bengel’s observation is very important: ‘<b>all that which</b>—a most significant expression, and, compared with what follows, most worthy of consideration. For in our Lord’s discourses, that, which the Father hath given Him, is spoken of in the singular number and neuter gender, “<i>all that which</i>:” whereas they who come to Him, the Son, are spoken of in the masculine gender, and sometimes also in the plural number: “<i>every man</i>,” or “<i>all they</i>.” The Father hath given to the Son as it were one mass, that all whom He hath given should be<i> one</i>: that whole mass the Son unfoldeth one by one in this following out of the Father’s design. Hence also that which we read in ch. xvii. 2, “<i>that all that which Thou hast given Him</i> (so literally), to<i> them He may give eternal life</i>.”’ See also 1 John v. 4.<br><br><b> I will in no wise cast out</b> does not refer here to the office of the Son of God<i> as Judge</i>; but is another way of expressing the grace, and readiness with which He will receive all who come to Him.<br><br><b> raise it up again</b> refers to the only resurrection which is the completion of the man in his glorified state;—it does not set aside the “<i>resurrection of judgment</i>” (ch. v. 29), but that very term is a debasement of “<i>resurrection?</i>’ its true sense is only “<i>resurrection of life</i>.”<br><br> Bengel has beautifully given the connexion of this last promise with what went before: “this is the end, beyond which there is no danger.” But there is much more than this in it. In this declaration (vv. 39, 40) is contained the key of the following discourse, vv. 44–59. The<i> end</i> of the work of God, as regards man, is the glorification of his restored and sanctified nature,—<i>body, soul, and spirit</i>,—in eternity. Without this,—salvation, restitution, would be incomplete. The adoption cannot be consummated without the redemption of the body. Rom. viii. 18–23. And the glorification of the body, soul, and spirit,—of the whole man,—cannot take place but by means of<i> the glorified Body of the second Adam</i>. ‘He who does not see this, will never understand either the Holy Communion, or this testimony of the Lord in its inner meaning.’ Stier.<br><br><b> The looketh on</b> here is a different thing from the mere<i> seeing</i> of ver. 36. It is the awakening of the attention preparatory to faith, answering to the looking on the serpent of brass:<i> with the eyes of the soul</i>, as Euthymius says; but we must not make the<i> looking</i> equivalent to<i> believing</i>, to which it is only preparatory.
