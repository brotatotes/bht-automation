—loses none of them;—and will raise them all up (here, in the<i> fullest</i> and<i> blessed sense</i>) at the last day. Olshausen remarks, that ‘in ch. iv. we had only the inexhaustible refreshing of the<i> soul</i> by the water of life; but this discourse goes further;—that not even death itself shall destroy the<i> body</i> of him who has been nourished by this bread of life.’<br><br><b> raise it up again</b> refers to the only resurrection which is the completion of the man in his glorified state;—it does not set aside the “<i>resurrection of judgment</i>” (ch. v. 29), but that very term is a debasement of “<i>resurrection?</i>’ its true sense is only “<i>resurrection of life</i>.”<br><br> Bengel has beautifully given the connexion of this last promise with what went before: “this is the end, beyond which there is no danger.” But there is much more than this in it. In this declaration (vv. 39, 40) is contained the key of the following discourse, vv. 44–59. The<i> end</i> of the work of God, as regards man, is the glorification of his restored and sanctified nature,—<i>body, soul, and spirit</i>,—in eternity. Without this,—salvation, restitution, would be incomplete. The adoption cannot be consummated without the redemption of the body. Rom. viii. 18–23. And the glorification of the body, soul, and spirit,—of the whole man,—cannot take place but by means of<i> the glorified Body of the second Adam</i>. ‘He who does not see this, will never understand either the Holy Communion, or this testimony of the Lord in its inner meaning.’ Stier.
