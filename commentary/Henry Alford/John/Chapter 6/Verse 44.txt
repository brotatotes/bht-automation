<b> 44.]</b> The connexion seems to be this: They were not to murmur among themselves because He had said this; for the right understanding of what He had said is only to be gained by being taught of God, by being drawn by thé Father, who alone can give the desire to come to Christ, and bring a man to Him. That this ‘drawing’ is not<i> irresistible grace</i>, is confessed even by Augustine himself, the great upholder of the doctrines of grace. “If a man is drawn, says an objector, he comes against his will. (We answer) if he comes unwillingly, he does not believe: if he does not believe, he does not come. For we do not run to Christ on our feet, but by faith; not with the movement of the body, but with the free will of the heart... Think not that thou art drawn against thy will: the mind can be drawn by love.” Calvin and others understand<i> irresistible grace</i> to be here meant: “It is false and profane,” says Calvin, ‘to say that only the willing are drawn.”’ The Greek expositors take the view which I have adopted above. Chrysostom says, “This expression does not remove our part in the coming, but rather shews that we want help to come.” See Article X. of the Church of England, at the end.
