<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] Here there is considerable difficulty, on account of the variation from Matt., Mark, and Luke, who relate that the disciples came to the Lord after He had been teaching and healing the multitudes, and when it was now evening, and asked him to dismiss the multitudes, that they might buy food; whereupon He commanded, ‘Give ye them to eat;’ whereas here apparently, on their first coming, the Lord Himself suggests the question, how they were to be fed, to Philip. This difference is not to be passed over, as it has usually been by English Commentators, without notice. Still less are we to invent improbable and hardly honest harmonistic shifts to piece the two narratives together. There can be no doubt, fairly and honestly speaking, that the narratives, <em> in their mere letter</em> , disagree. But those who are not slaves to the mere letter will see here that inner and deeper accordance of which Augustine (De Consensu Evang. ii. 46, vol. iii. pt. i.) speaks in commenting on this passage: “Ex qua universa varietate verborum, rerum autem sententiarumque concordia, satis apparet salubriter nos doceri, nihil quærendum in verbis nisi loquentium voluntatem; cui demonstrandæ invigilare debent omnes veridici narratores, cum de homine vel de angelo vel de Deo aliquid narrant.” I repeat the remark so often made in this Commentary, that if we were in possession of the facts as they happened, there is no doubt that the various forms of the literal narrations would fall into their places, and the truthfulness of each historian would be apparent: but as we cannot at present reconcile them in this way, the humble and believing Christian will not be tempted to handle the word of God deceitfully, but to admire the gracious condescension which has given us the evidence of so many independent witnesses, whose very difference in detail makes their accordance in the great central truths so much the more weighty. <em> On every point of importance here, the four sacred historians are entirely and absolutely agreed</em> . That every minor detail related by them had its ground in historical fact, we fully believe; it is the <em> tracking it to</em> this ground in each case, which is now <em> beyond our power;</em> and here comes in the simplicity and reliance of faith: and the justification of those who believe and receive each Gospel as they find it written.

<p><strong> πρὸς Φ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Why to <em> Philip</em> , does not appear; perhaps some reason lay in the <strong> πειράζων αὐτόν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> which is now lost to us. From his words in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:8">John 14:8</span> , we cannot infer, as has been done by Chrys. (Hom. xlii. 1, in Joann. vol. viii. p. 249) and others, that he was weaker in faith, or tardier in spiritual apprehension, than the rest. Of all the Apostles who appear in the sacred narrative, something might be quoted shewing equal unreadiness to believe and understand. I would take the circumstance as simple matter of fact, implying perhaps that Philip was nearest to our Lord at the moment. We must not fall into the mistake of supposing that Philip being <em> of Bethsaida the city of Andrew and Peter</em> (ch. Joh 1:45 ) throws any light on the question: for the Bethsaida near which our Lord now was, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10">Luke 9:10</span> , was <em> another place</em> , see notes there.
