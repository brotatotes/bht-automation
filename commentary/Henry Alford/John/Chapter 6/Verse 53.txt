<b> 53.]</b> Our Lord not only ratifies their own word,<b> eat</b>, but adds to it a more wonderful thing; that they must also do that against which a prohibition might seem to have existed from Noah downwards,—<i>drink His Blood</i>. But observe, this Blood is not to be<i> eaten</i> in the Flesh,<i> which was the forbidden thing</i> (Gen. ix. 4: Levit. xvii. 10–16), in its strict literal form: but to be<i> drunk</i>, separate from the flesh: again<i> pres posing death</i>. Now as the Flesh of Ch (see above) is the Resurrection-Body which: He now has, and in which all things consist; so is His Blood ( “the blood is the<i> life</i>,’ Lev. xvii. 11, 14) the Life which He gave up, paid down, as the penalty for the sin of the world. By the shedding, pouring forth, of that Blood, is remission of sin.<br><br> It is quite impossible that these words should, as De Wette maintains, be merely an expansion of “<i>eating His flesh</i>.” Even had the idea of<i> drinking blood</i> been one familiar to the Jews, the construction would not have allowed such an interpretation;—but<i> new as if was</i>, and<i> abhorrent from their habits and law</i>, we must regard it as specially and purposely added.<br><br> But<i> what</i> is this eating and drinking? Clearly, not<i> merely faith</i>: for faith answers to the<i> hand reached forth for the food, but is not the act of eating</i>. Faith is a<i> necessary condition</i> of the act: so that we can hardly say with Augustine, “<i>believe, and thou hast eaten</i>,” but “<i>believe, and thou shalt eat</i>.” Inasmuch as Faith will necessarily in its energizing lead to this partaking, we sometimes incorrectly say that it is Faith: but for strict accuracy this is not enough. ‘To eat the flesh of Christ, is<i> to realize, in our inward life, the mystery of His Body now in heaven,—to digest and assimilate our own portion in that Body.</i><br><br> To drink His Blood, is<i> to realize, in our inward life, the mystery of His satisfaction for sin,—to digest and assimilate our own portion in that satisfaction, the outpouring of that Blood.</i> And both these definitions may be gathered into one, which is: The eating of His Flesh and drinking of His Blood import the making to ourselves and using as<i> objectively real</i>, those two great Truths of our Redemption in Him, of which our Faith<i> subjectively</i> convinces us.<br><br> And of this realizing of Faith he has been pleased to appoint certain symbols in the Holy Communion, which He has commanded to be received; to signify to us the spiritual process, and to assist us towards it.<br><br><b> ye have no life in you]</b> Ye have not in you that spring of life, which shall overcome death, and lead<b> 54.]</b> to the resurrection in the true sense:’ see above, ver. 44, and notice again the solemn<i> refrain</i>.
