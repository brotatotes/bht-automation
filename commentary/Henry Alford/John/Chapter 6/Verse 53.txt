<b> 53.]</b> Our Lord not only ratifies their own word,<b> eat</b>, but adds to it a more wonderful thing; that they must also do that against which a prohibition might seem to have existed from Noah downwards,—<i>drink His Blood</i>. But observe, this Blood is not to be<i> eaten</i> in the Flesh,<i> which was the forbidden thing</i> (Gen. ix. 4: Levit. xvii. 10–16), in its strict literal form: but to be<i> drunk</i>, separate from the flesh: again<i> pres posing death</i>. Now as the Flesh of Ch (see above) is the Resurrection-Body which: He now has, and in which all things consist; so is His Blood ( “the blood is the<i> life</i>,’ Lev. xvii. 11, 14) the Life which He gave up, paid down, as the penalty for the sin of the world. By the shedding, pouring forth, of that Blood, is remission of sin.
