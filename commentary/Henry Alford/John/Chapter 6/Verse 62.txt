 62. ]  ἐὰν οὖν θεωρ  .,  what then, if ye see … not meaning ‘  will ye not then be much more scandalized? ’ or, ‘  what will ye say (or  do ),  then? ’ but appealing to an event which they should witness, as a  certain proof of one part of the σκληρὸς λόγος , with which indeed  the rest of it was bound up , His having  descended from heaven . All attempts (as those of Lücke, De Wette, and others) to explain this otherwise than of His ascent into heaven, are simply  dishonest , and spring from laxity of belief in the historical reality of that event. That it is not recorded by John, is of no moment here: see Prolegomena. And that none but the Twelve saw it, is unimportant; for how do we know that our Lord was not here speaking to some among the Twelve? To explain it of His  death , as part of His going up where He was before, is hardly less disingenuous. Lücke maintains that θεωρεῖν need not mean bodily sight: which is true enough in some constructions in John (ch. Joh 8:51 alli [94] .); but surely, as joined with ἀναβαίνοντα , it must. The whole exegesis of the passage in the above-named Commentators is a remarkable instance of the warping of the judgment by unsoundness of belief in the historical truth of the evangelistic testimony.
