<b> 62.] What then if ye see</b>... not meaning ‘<i>will ye not then be much more scandalized’</i> or,<i> ‘what will ye say</i> (or<i> do</i>),<i> then</i>?’—but appealing to an event which they should witness, as a<i> certain proof of one part of the “hard saying</i>,” with which indeed<i> the rest of it</i><i> was bound up</i>,—His having<i> descended from heaven</i>. All attempts to explain this otherwise than of His ascent into heaven, are simply<i> dishonest</i>,—and spring from laxity of belief in the historical reality of that event. That it is not recorded by John, is of no moment here. And that none but the Twelve saw it, is unimportant; for how do we know that our Lord was not here speaking to some among the Twelve? To explain it of His<i> death</i>, as part of His going up where he was before, is hardly less disingenuous.
