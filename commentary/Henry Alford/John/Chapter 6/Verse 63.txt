<b> 63.] spirit</b> and<b> flesh</b> do not mean the<i> spiritual</i> and<i> carnal sense of the foregoing discourse</i>, as many Commentators explain them: for our Lord is speaking, not of<i> teaching</i> merely, but of<i> vivifying</i>: He is explaining the<i> life-giving principle</i> of which He had been before speaking. ‘Such eating of My flesh as you imagine and find hard to listen to, could profit you nothing,—for<i> it</i> will have ascended up, &c.; and besides, generally, it is only the<i> Spirit</i> that can vivify the spirit of man; the<i> flesh</i> (in whatever way used) can profit nothing towards this.’ He does not say ‘<i>My</i> Flesh profiteth nothing,’ but ‘<i>the</i> flesh.’ To make Him say this, as the Swiss anti-sacramentalists do, is to make Him contradict His own words in ver. 51.<br><br><b> the words that I have spoken]</b><i> viz</i>.<i> the words</i><b> my flesh</b><i> and</i><b> my blood</b>,<i> above</i>. They are<i> spirit</i> and<i> life</i>:—spirit, not flesh only:—<i>living food</i>, not<i> carnal</i> and<i> perishable</i>. This meaning has been missed by almost all Commentators: Stier upholds it, and it seems to me<i> beyond question the right one</i>. The common interpretation is, ‘<i>the words which I have</i><i> spoken</i>,’ i.e. ‘<i>My discourses</i>,’ are ‘<i>to be taken in a spiritual sense</i>, ‘<i>and are life</i>’ But this is any thing but precise, even after the forcing of the meaning of the word “<i>spirit</i>.”
