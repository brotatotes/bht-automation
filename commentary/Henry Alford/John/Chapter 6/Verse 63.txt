<p><strong> 63.</strong> ] <strong> πνεῦμα</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> σάρξ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> do not mean the <em> spiritual</em> and <em> carnal sense of the foregoing discourse</em> , as many Commentators explain them: for our Lord is speaking, not of <em> teaching</em> merely, but of <em> vivifying:</em> He is explaining the <em> life-giving principle</em> of which He had been before speaking. ‘Such eating of My flesh as you imagine and find hard to listen to, could profit you nothing, for <em> it</em> will have ascended up, &amp;c. and besides, generally, it is only the <em> Spirit</em> that can vivify the spirit of man: the <em> flesh</em> (in whatever way used) can profit nothing towards this.’ He does not say ‘ <em> My</em> Flesh profiteth nothing,’ but ‘ <em> the</em> flesh.’ To make Him say this, as the Swiss anti-sacramentalists do, is to make Him contradict His own words in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span> .

<p><strong> τὰ ῥήμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἃ ἐγὼ λελάληκα</strong> <em> viz. the words</em> <strong> μου τὴν σάρκα</strong> <em> and</em> <strong> μου τὸ αἷμα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <em> above</em> . They are πνεῦμα and ζωή : spirit, not flesh only: <em> living food</em> , not <em> carnal</em> and <em> perishable</em> . This meaning has been missed by almost all Commentators: Stier upholds it, iv. 281 (2nd edn.): and it seems to me <em> beyond question the right one</em> . The common interpretation is, ‘ <em> the words which I have spoken</em> ,’ i.e. ‘ <em> My discourses</em> ,’ are πνεῦμα , ‘ <em> to be taken in a spiritual sense</em> ,’ (? this sense of πνεῦμα ,) ‘ <em> and are life</em> .’ But this is any thing but precise, even after the forcing of πνεῦμα .</p>
