 63. ]  πνεῦμα  ,   σάρξ  , do not mean the  spiritual and  carnal sense of the foregoing discourse , as many Commentators explain them: for our Lord is speaking, not of  teaching merely, but of  vivifying: He is explaining the  life-giving principle of which He had been before speaking. ‘Such eating of My flesh as you imagine and find hard to listen to, could profit you nothing, for  it will have ascended up, &c. and besides, generally, it is only the  Spirit that can vivify the spirit of man: the  flesh (in whatever way used) can profit nothing towards this.’ He does not say ‘  My Flesh profiteth nothing,’ but ‘  the flesh.’ To make Him say this, as the Swiss anti-sacramentalists do, is to make Him contradict His own words in John 6:51 .
	 τὰ ῥήμ  .   ἃ ἐγὼ λελάληκα  viz. the words  μου τὴν σάρκα  and  μου τὸ αἷμα  ,  above . They are πνεῦμα and ζωή : spirit, not flesh only:  living food , not  carnal and  perishable . This meaning has been missed by almost all Commentators: Stier upholds it, iv. 281 (2nd edn.): and it seems to me  beyond question the right one . The common interpretation is, ‘  the words which I have spoken ,’ i.e. ‘  My discourses ,’ are πνεῦμα , ‘  to be taken in a spiritual sense ,’ (? this sense of πνεῦμα ,) ‘  and are life .’ But this is any thing but precise, even after the forcing of πνεῦμα .
