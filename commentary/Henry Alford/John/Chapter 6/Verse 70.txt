<b> 70.]</b> The selection of the Twelve by Jesus is the consequence of the giving of them to Him by the Father, ch. xvii. 6,—in which there also Judas is included. So that<i> His selecting, and the Father's giving and drawing, do not exclude final falling away.</i><br><br><b> a devil]</b> It is doubtful in what sense this word should be taken, However we explain it, it will be an expression only once used in the N.T. In the dark act here prophesied, Judas was under the immediate instigation of and yielded himself up to Satan (compare our Lord’s reply to Peter, Matt. xvi. 23); and I would understand this expression as having reference to that league with and entertainment of the Evil One in his thoughts and purposes, which his ultimate possession by Satan implies. This meaning can perhaps hardly be rendered by any single word in another language. The A.V. ‘<i>a devil</i>,’ is certainly too strong;<b> devilish</b> would be better, but not unobjectionable. Compare “<i>The son of perdition</i>,” ch. xvii. 12.
