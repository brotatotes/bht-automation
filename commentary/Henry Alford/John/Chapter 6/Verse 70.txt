<p><strong> 70.</strong> ] The selection of the Twelve by Jesus is the consequence of the giving of them to Him by the Father, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6">John 17:6</span> , in which there also Judas is included. So that <em> His selecting, and the Father’s giving and drawing, do not exclude final falling away</em> .

<p>Meyer observes, that the solemn addition, <strong> τοὺς δώδεκα</strong> after ὑμᾶς , heightens the contrast to the opposite result which follows.

<p><strong> διάβολος</strong> ] It is doubtful in what sense this word should be taken. Whether we render it διαβολικός (= τοῦ διαβόλου ὑπουργός ), or ἐπίβουλος , (both given by Euthym [96] ,) it will be an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον in the N.T. Of the two however the latter is the harsher, and less analogous to N.T. diction. Certainly, in the dark act here prophesied, Judas was under the immediate instigation of and yielded himself up to Satan (cf. our Lord’s reply to Peter, Mat 16:23 ); and I would understand this expression as having reference to that league with and entertainment of the Evil One in his thoughts and purposes, which his ultimate possession by Satan implies. This meaning can perhaps hardly be rendered by any single word in another language. The E. V. ‘ <em> a devil</em> ’ is certainly too strong; <strong> devilish</strong> would be better, but not unobjectionable. Compare ὁ υἱὸς τῆς ἀπωλείας ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span> .
