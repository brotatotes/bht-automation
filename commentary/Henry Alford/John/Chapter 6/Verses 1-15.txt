<p><strong> 1 15.</strong> ] <em> Miraculous feeding of five thousand men</em> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:13-21">Matthew 14:13-21</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:30-44">Mark 6:30-44</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:30-44">Mark 6:30-44</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10-17">Luke 9:10-17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:10-17">Luke 9:10-17</span> , in each of which compare the notes throughout. Here we have another example of John relating a miracle with the view of introducing a discourse, and that discourse carries on the testimony of Jesus to Himself. In the last, He was the SON OF GOD, testified to by the Father, received by faith, rejected by unbelief: here He is SON OF MAN, the incarnate Life of the world, and we have the unbelief of the Jews and His own disciples set in strong contrast with the feeding on and participating in Him as the Bread of Life.</p>
