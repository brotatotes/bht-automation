 19 21.   περ  .   ἐπὶ τῆς θαλ  . ] There surely can be no question in the mind of an unprejudiced reader, that it is John’s intention to relate a  miracle; nor again, that there could be in the minds of the disciples  no doubt about that miracle,  no chance of a mistake as to what they saw. I have treated of  ἐπὶ τῆς θαλ  . on Matthew 14:25 .
	They were afraid: but upon being reassured by His voice, they were willing to take Him into the ship; and upon their doing so, the ship in a comparatively short time (or perhaps  immediately, by miracle , but I prefer the other) was at the land to which they had been going, viz. by the storm ceasing, and the ship making smooth way ( ἐκόπασεν ὁ ἄνεμος , Matt., Mark).
	It seems to me that the above interpretation of  ἤθελον οὖν λαβεῖν is absolutely necessary to account for the  οὖν  , and quite in accordance with John’s usage of θέλω (see reff.).
	Some of the German Commentators (even De Wette among them) have created a difficulty, by strangely rendering ἤθελον , ‘  they wished ’ (implying, ‘  but did not ’),  but ( καί )  the ship was immediately , &c. i.e. they were already close to the land, and so there was no occasion. Prof. Bleek (Beiträge, pp. 103 4) half adopts this view: adding to it, I am sorry to see, that perhaps Jesus was on the land, and the disciples in the storm and darkness thought Him to be on the sea.
