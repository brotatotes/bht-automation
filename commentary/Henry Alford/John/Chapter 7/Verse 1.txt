 1. ] The chronology of this period is very doubtful. I have remarked on it in my note on Luke 9:51 . Thus much we may observe here, that  μετὰ ταῦτα cannot apply emphatically to ch. 6, but must be referred back to ch. 5, as indeed must the Jews seeking to kill Him, and the miracle alluded to in John 7:23 . But it will not follow from this, that ch. 6 is not in its right place: it contains an independent memoir of a miracle and discourse of our Lord in Galilee which actually happened in the interval, and only serves to shew us the character of this Gospel as made up of such memoirs, more or less connected with one another, and selected by the Evangelist for their higher spiritual import, and the discourses arising from them. I would understand this verse as merely carrying on the time from ch. 5 and ch. 6, and its contents as introductory to the account of Jesus not going up at first to the feast. Ch. 6 is in some measure presupposed in our John 7:3 , as indicating that He had not constantly observed the festal journeys of late.
