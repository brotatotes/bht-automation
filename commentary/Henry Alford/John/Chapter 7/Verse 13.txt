Probably His teaching consisted in<i> exposition of the Scripture</i>.<br><br><b> having never learned:</b> never having been the scholar of any Rabbi. He was<i> taught of God</i>. These words are spoken in the true bigotry and prejudice of so-called ‘learning.’<br><br> These words of His enemies, testifying to matter of fact well known to them, are, as Meyer observes, decisive against all attempts of unbelievers to attribute our Lord’s knowledge to education in any human school of learning. Such indications are not without their value in these times.
