<b> 17.]</b> The rendering of this verse in the A.V. is much to be deplored. The word signifying<b> be willing to</b> should not have been slurred over, for it is important.<br><br><b> If any man’s will be, to do His will,</b>&c. As it now stands in the A.V.,<i> a wrong idea is conveyed:</i> that the<i> bare performance of God’s outward commands</i> will give a man sufficient acquaintance with Christian doctrine:—whereas what our Lord asserts to the Jews is, that if the<i> will</i> be set in His ways, if a man be really anxious to do the will of God, and thus to fulfil this first great commandment of the law, the singleness of purpose, and subjection to the will of God, will lead him on to faith in the promised and then apparent Messiah, and to a just discrimination of the divine character of his teaching.
