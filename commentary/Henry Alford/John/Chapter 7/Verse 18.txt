<b> 18.]</b> This gives us the reason why he, who wishes to do God’s will, will know of the teaching of Christ: viz. because both are seeking one aim—the glory of God:—and the humility of him, whose will it is to do God’s will, can best appreciate that more perfect humility of the divine Son, who speaks not of himself, but of Him that sent him,—see ch. v. 41–44, of which this verse is a repetition with a somewhat different bearing. In its<i> general</i> sense, it asserts that self-exaltation and self-seeking necessarily accompany the unaided teaching of man, but that all true teaching is from God. But then we must remember that, simply taken, the latter part of the sentence is only true of the Holy One Himself; that owing to human infirmity, purity of motive is no sure guarantee for correctness of doctrine;—and therefore in this second part He does not say “<i>the glory of God</i>,” which would generalize it to all men, but<b> his glory that sent him</b>, which: confines it to Himself.
