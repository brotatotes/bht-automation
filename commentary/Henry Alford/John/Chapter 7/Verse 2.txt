<b> 2.]</b> See Deut. xvi. 13–17. Josephus calls this<i> the holiest and greatest feast</i>. It began on the 15th (evening of 14th) of Tisri (Sept. 28), and lasted till the evening of the 22nd (Oct. 6).<br><br> In ver. 5 (as well as by “<i>thy disciples</i>,” ver. 8), we have these brethren<i> absolutely excluded from the number of the Twelve</i> (see ch. vi. 69); and it is impossible to modify the meaning of the word “<i>believe</i>,” so as to suppose that they may have been of the Twelve, but not believers in the highest sense. This ‘verse also excludes<i> all</i> His brethren: it is inconceivable that John should have so written, if<i> any among them</i> believed at that time.<br><br> The emphatic expression,<b> for even his brethren</b>, &c., is a strong corroboration of the view that they were really and literally<i> brethren</i>;—see also Ps. lxix. 8.<br><br> In ver. 8, it is of little import whether we read<b> not</b> or<b> not yet</b>: the sense will be the same, both on account of the present,<b> go not up</b> (not ‘will not go up,’ which would express the disavowal of<i> an intention</i> to go up), and of “<i>not yet</i>,” which occurs afterwards.<b> I go not up</b> would mean,<b> I am not</b> (at present)<b> going up</b>. Meyer attributes to our Lord change of purpose, and justifies his view by the example of His treatment of the Syropheenician woman, whom He at first repulsed, but afterwards had compassion on. Matt. xv. 26 ff. The same Commentator directs attention to the emphatic term, “<b>this</b><i> feast</i>,” as implying that our Lord had it in His mind to go up to some future feasts, hut not to<i> this one</i>.<br><br><b> is not yet full come</b>: see Luke ix. 51 and note.
