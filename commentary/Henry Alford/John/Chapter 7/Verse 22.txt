<b> 22.]</b> The argument seems to be,<b> Moses</b><i> on this account</i><b> gave you circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers</b>; i.e. it is no part of the law<i> of Moses</i>, properly so called,—but was adopted by Moses, and thereby becomes part of his law.<b> Now you circumcise on the Sabbath, to avoid breaking the law of Moses</b>, &c. If our Lord had said these last words (in ver. 23)<i> merely</i>, the argument would not have been strict: they might have answered, that circumcision was not only a command of the law, but anterior to it; whereas ver. 22 takes this answer from them; reminding them that though they regarded its sanction as derived from Moses, it was in fact older,—and tacitly approving their doing it on the Sabbath. Then the argument is,<i> If this may be done on the Sabbath</i> if an ordinance<i> strictly Mosaic</i> (which<i> the Sabbath</i> in its Jewish mode of observance was) may be set aside by another, Mosaic also, but more ancient, and borrowed from a more general and direct command of God (for, as Grotius observes, circumcision was older than the enactment of strict rest on the Sabbath by the law),<i> how much more may it by a deed of mercy</i>, a benevolent exercise of divine power, the approval of which is anterior to and deeper than all ceremonial enactment?
