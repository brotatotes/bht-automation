<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] <strong> ἵνα μὴ λυθῇ</strong> not, “ <em> ita ut non solvatur</em> ” “ <em> salva lege</em> ;” which is ungrammatical; but <strong> in order that the Law of Moses may not be broken</strong> , viz. that which (after the fathers) ordains circumcision on the eighth day.

<p><strong> ὅλον ἄνθρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The distinction is between circumcision, which purified only part of a man, by which he received ( ἔλαβεν ) ceremonial cleanness, and that perfect and entire healing which the Lord bestowed on the cripple. Stier (after Bengel) thinks the ὅλον refers to <em> body and soul</em> , see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:14">John 5:14</span> , whose healing is a much greater benefit than circumcision, even viewed as a sacrament: “nam circumcisio est <em> medium</em> , sanatio animæ <em> finis</em> .” But this is perhaps too subtle. The Jews could not have appreciated this meaning, and the argument is especially addressed <em> to them</em> . Besides, it is by no means certain from that passage that such was the case.</p>
