<b> 27.]</b> Perhaps they refer to the idea (see quotation from Justin Martyr in note on ch. i. 31) that the Messiah would not be known until anointed by Elias, when He would suddenly come forth from obscurity.<br><br> They may allude to Isa. liii. 8.<br><br> The<i> place</i> of the Messiah’s birth was known, ver. 42.<br><br> At all events we see here, that the Jews regarded their Messiah not as a mere man, but one to bo supernaturally sent into the world.<br><br><b> Ye both know me....]</b> It has been questioned whether these words are to be taken ironically, interrogatively, or affirmatively. I incline to the latter view, for this reason:—obviously no very high degree of knowledge<b> whence He was</b> is implied, for they knew not Him that sent Him (see also ch. viii. 14, 19), and therefore could not know<b> whence He was</b>, in this sense. The answer is made<i> in their own sense</i>:—they knew that He was from Nazareth in Galilee, see ver, 41,—and probably that He was called the son of Joseph. In this sense they knew<b> whence He was</b>; but further than this they knew not.<br><br><b> and I am not come; and moreover—i. e. besides this</b>.<br><br> The sense of true must. be gathered from the context.<b> I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is</b><i> true</i>—<b>ye know Him not, but I know Him.—for I came from Him, and He sent Me.</b> The matter here impressed on them is the<i> genuineness</i>, the<i> reality</i> of the fact:—that Jesus<i> was sent</i>, and<i> there was one who sent Him</i>, though they knew Him not, and consequently knew not whence He was. The nearest English word would be<b> real</b>: but this would not convey the meaning perspicuously to the ordinary mind;—perhaps the A.V.<b> true</b> is better, provided it be explained to mean<b> really existent</b>, not<i> ‘truthful</i>.’
