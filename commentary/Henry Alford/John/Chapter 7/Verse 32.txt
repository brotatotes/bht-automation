<b> 32.]</b> The wavering of the multitude appears to the Pharisees a dangerous sign: and the Sanhedrim (consisting of the Chief Priests and the Pharisees) send officers specially to lay hold on Him.<br><br><b> Yet a little while....]</b> This appears to be said in reference to ver. 30, to shew them the uselessness of their attempting to lay hands on Him till His hour was come, which it soon would do.<br><br><b> unto him that sent me]</b> It has been asked, ‘If Jesus thus specified where He was going, how could the Jews ask the question in ver. 35?’ but De Wette answers well, that the Jews knew not “<i>Him that sent Him</i>,” and therefore the saying was a dark one to them.<br><br><b> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me]</b> These words must not be pressed too much, as has been done by in any interpreters, who would make them mean ‘<i>Ye shall seek My help and not find it</i>? (viz. in your need, at the destruction of Jerusalem); for this would not be true even of the Jews, any one of whom might have at any time turned and looked on Him whom he had pierced, by faith,—and have been saved;—nor again must it be taken as meaning, ‘<i>Ye shall seek to lay hands on Me, and shall not be able</i>,’—which is vapid and unmeaning. Neither of these interpretations, nor any like them, will agree with the parallel place, ch. xiii. 33, where the same words are used to the<i> disciples</i>. The meaning is simply (as in reff.), ‘My bodily presence will be withdrawn from you; I shall be personally in a place inaccessible to you:’ see ch. xiii. 36.<br><br><b> where I am]</b> We need not supply “<i>then</i>;” the present tense is used in the solemn sense of ch. i. 18, and ch. iii. 13, to signify<i> essential truth</i>.<br><br> Compare “<i>ye cannot</i>” addressed to the Jews, with “<i>thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me afterwards</i>,” addressed to Peter, ch. xiii. 36, and it will be evident that the Lord had their<i> spiritual state</i> in view: ‘Ye cannot, as ye are now, enter there.’<br><br> On the whole, see Luke xvii. 22.<br><br> Their intent in this hypothesis, that He was going to the dispersed among the Greeks, is, to convey contempt and mockery. They do not however believe the hypothesis; but ask again,<b> What is this saying</b>?<br><br> On the sense of our Lord’s words, see notes on ch, iv. 13, 14.<br><br><b> as the scripture hath said</b>] These words must apply to the words “<i>out of his belly shall flow,&</i>c.,” since the words “he that believeth on me” could not form part of the citation. But we look in vain for such a text in the O.T., and an apocryphal or lost canonical book is out of the question.<br><br> I believe the citation to be intimately connected with the ceremony referred to, and that we must look for its place by consulting the passages where the<i> flowing out of water from the temple</i> (see above) is spoken of. The most remarkable of these is found in Ezek. xlvii, 1–12. There a river of water of life (see ver. 9 especially)<i> flows from under the threshold of the temple</i>. Again in Zech. xiv. 8,<i> living waters</i><i> shall go out from Jerusalem</i>. 1 believe these expressions to be all to which the citation applies, and the words “<i>out of his belly</i>” to be the interpretation of the corresponding words in the prophecies. For the temple was symbolic (see ch. ii. 21) of the Body of the Lord; and the Spirit which dwells in and flows forth from His glorified Body, dwells in and flows forth from His people also, who are made like unto Him, Gal. iv. 6; Rom. viii. 9–11; 1 Cor. iii. 16.
