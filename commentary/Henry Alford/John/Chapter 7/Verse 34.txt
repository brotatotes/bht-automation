Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me]</b> These words must not be pressed too much, as has been done by in any interpreters, who would make them mean ‘<i>Ye shall seek My help and not find it</i>? (viz. in your need, at the destruction of Jerusalem); for this would not be true even of the Jews, any one of whom might have at any time turned and looked on Him whom he had pierced, by faith,—and have been saved;—nor again must it be taken as meaning, ‘<i>Ye shall seek to lay hands on Me, and shall not be able</i>,’—which is vapid and unmeaning. Neither of these interpretations, nor any like them, will agree with the parallel place, ch. xiii. 33, where the same words are used to the<i> disciples</i>. The meaning is simply (as in reff.), ‘My bodily presence will be withdrawn from you; I shall be personally in a place inaccessible to you:’ see ch. xiii. 36.<br><br><b> where I am]</b> We need not supply “<i>then</i>;” the present tense is used in the solemn sense of ch. i. 18, and ch. iii. 13, to signify<i> essential truth</i>.<br><br> Compare “<i>ye cannot</i>” addressed to the Jews, with “<i>thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me afterwards</i>,” addressed to Peter, ch. xiii. 36, and it will be evident that the Lord had their<i> spiritual state</i> in view: ‘Ye cannot, as ye are now, enter there.’<br><br> On the whole, see Luke xvii. 22.
