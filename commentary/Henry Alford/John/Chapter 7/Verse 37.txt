</b>It is not certain what is meant by this<b> last day, which was the great day of the feast.</b> The command, Levit. xxiii. 34, 35, was to keep the feast seven days; the<i> first</i> to be a solemn assembly and a feast-sabbath,—then on the<i> eighth</i> day another solemn assembly and a feast-sabbath:—so also ib. ver. 39. (But in Deut. xvi. 13 nothing is said of the<i> eighth</i> day.) In Neh. viii. 18 the feast is kept seven days, and on the eighth is a solemn assembly, ‘<i>according unto the manner</i>?’ In Num. xxix. 12–38, where minute directions are given for every day of the feast, the eighth day is reckoned in, as usual. Josephus, Antt. iii, 10. 4, gives a similar aceount. In 2 Macc. x. 6, we read “<i>eight days.... as in the feast of the tabernacles</i>.” But the eighth day was not properly one of the<i> feast days</i>; the people ceased to dwell in the tabernacles on the seventh day. Philo says of it, that it was the<i> solemn conclusion, not of that feast alone, but of all the feasts in the year, being the last day in the year</i>. And though this may be pure conjecture, it is valuable, as shewing<i> the fact</i> the reason of which is conjectured; viz. that the<i> eighth day was held in more than ordinary estimation</i>. The<i> eighth</i> day then seems here to be meant, and<b> the last of the feast</b> to be popularly used, as in some of the citations above. But a difficulty attends this view. Our Lord certainly seems to allude here to the custom which prevailed during the seven days of the feast, of a priest bringing water in a golden vessel from the pool of Siloam with a jubilant procession to the temple, standing on the altar and pouring it out there, together with wine, while meantime the<i> Hallel</i> (Ps. cxiii—cxviii.) was sung. This practice was by some supposed—as the dwelling in tabernacles represented their life in the desert of old—to refer to the striking of the rock by Moses:—by others, to the rain, for which they then prayed, for the seed of the ensuing year:—by the elder Rabbis, to Isa. xii. 3, and the effusion of the Holy Spirit in the days of the Messiah. But it was almost universally agreed, that on the eighth day this ceremony did not take place. Now, out of this difficulty I would extract what I believe to be the right interpretation. It<i> was</i> the eighth day, and the pouring of water<i> did not</i> take place. But is therefore all allusion to the ceremony excluded? I think not: nay, I believe it is the more natural. For seven days the ceremony had been performed, and the Hallel sung. On the eighth day the Hallel was sung, but the outpouring of the water did not take place: something was missed, which took place on the other days. ‘<i>Then Jesus stood and cried</i>, &c.’ Was not this the most natural time? Was it not probable that He would have said it at such a time, rather even than while the ceremony itself was going on?
