On the sense of our Lord’s words, see notes on ch. iv. 13, 14.<br><br><b> as the scripture hath said</b>] These words must apply to the words “<i>out of his belly shall flow,&</i>c.,” since the words “he that believeth on me” could not form part of the citation. But we look in vain for such a text in the O.T., and an apocryphal or lost canonical book is out of the question.<br><br> I believe the citation to be intimately connected with the ceremony referred to, and that we must look for its place by consulting the passages where the<i> flowing out of water from the temple</i> (see above) is spoken of. The most remarkable of these is found in Ezek. xlvii, 1–12. There a river of water of life (see ver. 9 especially)<i> flows from under the threshold of the temple</i>. Again in Zech. xiv. 8,<i> living waters</i><i> shall go out from Jerusalem</i>. 1 believe these expressions to be all to which the citation applies, and the words “<i>out of his belly</i>” to be the interpretation of the corresponding words in the prophecies. For the temple was symbolic (see ch. ii. 21) of the Body of the Lord; and the Spirit which dwells in and flows forth from His glorified Body, dwells in and flows forth from His people also, who are made like unto Him, Gal. iv. 6; Rom. viii. 9–11; 1 Cor. iii. 16.
