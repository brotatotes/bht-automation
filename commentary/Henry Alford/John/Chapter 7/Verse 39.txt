<b> 39</b>.] The difficulties raised concerning this interpretation of the saying of our pont have arisen from a misapprehension. John does not say that the words were a prophecy of<i> what happened</i> on the day of Pentecost; but of<i> the Spirit</i>, which the believers were about to receive. Their<i> first reception</i> of Him must not be illogically put in the place of<i> all His indwelling and working</i>, which are here intended, And the symbolism of the N.T. is fully satisfied by the interpretation. Granted that the water is the<i> water of life</i>,—what is that life but the life of the Spirit? “<i>The mind of the Spirit, is life</i>,” Rom. viii. 6; and again, “<i>the Spirit, is life</i>,” ib. ver. 10.<br><br><b> was not yet</b>] The additions “<i>given</i>,” “<i>upon them</i>,” as some authorities read,—and the like, are all put in by way of explanation, to avoid a misunderstanding which no intelligent reader could fall into. Chrysostom writes, “The Evangelist says, ‘for the Holy Ghost was not yet,” i.e. was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified: meaning by the Glory, the Cross.” It is obvious that the word<b> was</b> cannot refer to the<i> essential existence</i> of the Holy Spirit, as this would be not only in flat contradiction to ch. i. 32,, 33; iii. 5, 8, 34, but to the whole Old Test. in which the agency of the Spirit in the<i> outward world</i> is recognized even more vividly than in the N.T. The word implied is not exactly “<i>given</i>,” but rather “<i>working</i>,” or some similar word:<b> was not,—had not come in</b>; ‘<i>the dispensation of the Spirit was not yet</i>.’<br><br><b> glorified</b>,<i> through death</i>. The glorified Body of the Lord is the temple from under whose threshold the Holy Spirit flows forth to us; see ch. i. 16; Rom. viii. 11; Col. ii. 9.
