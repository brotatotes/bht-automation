The mention of the question about Bethlehem seems to me rather to corroborate our belief that the Evangelist was well aware how the fact stood, than, as some have said, to imply that he was ignorant of it. That no more remarks are appended, is natural. St. John had one great design in writing his gospel, and does not allow it to be interfered with by explanations of matters otherwise known. Besides, we may note that the so-called “<i>probability, that John knew nothing of the birth at Bethlehem</i>,” reaches much further than may appear at first. If St. John knew nothing of it, and yet the Mother of the Lord lived with him, the inference must be that<i> she</i> knew nothing of it,—in other words, that it never happened.
