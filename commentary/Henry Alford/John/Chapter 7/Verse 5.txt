In ver. 5 (as well as by “<i>thy disciples</i>,” ver. 8), we have these brethren<i> absolutely excluded from the number of the Twelve</i> (see ch. vi. 69); and it is impossible to modify the meaning of the word “<i>believe</i>,” so as to suppose that they may have been of the Twelve, but not believers in the highest sense. This ‘verse also excludes<i> all</i> His brethren: it is inconceivable that John should have so written, if<i> any among them</i> believed at that time.<br><br> The emphatic expression,<b> for even his brethren</b>, &c., is a strong corroboration of the view that they were really and literally<i> brethren;—</i>see also Ps. lxix. 8.
