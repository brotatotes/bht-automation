<b> 52</b>.] They taunt him with being disposed to join those (mostly Galilaeans) who had attached themselves to Jesus. Whether we read<b> ariseth</b> or<b> hath arisen</b>, the assertion is much the same: for the expression “<i>no prophet</i>” cannot include<i> the</i> Prophet, or the Messiah. It was<i> not historically true</i>;—for two prophets at least had arisen from Galilee: Jonah of Gathhepher and the greatest of the prophets, Elijah of Thisbe; and perhaps also Nahum and Hosea. Their contempt for Galilee made them lose sight of historical accuracy.<br><br>——————————<br><br><b> [</b>This passage is to be treated very differently from the rest of the sacred text.<br><br> In the Alexandrine, Vatican, Paris, and Sinaitic MSS., the ancient Syriac Versions, and all the early fathers, it is omitted: the Cambridge MS. alone of our most ancient, authorities contains it. Augustine states, that certain expunged it from their MSS., because they thought it might encourage sin. But this will not account for the very general omission of it, nor for the fact that ch. vii. 53 is included in the omitted portion. Eusebius assigns it apparently to the apocryphal “Gospel according to the Hebrews.” Other things to be noted respecting it are, (1) that in the MSS. which contain it, the<i> number</i><i> of variations</i> is very much greater than in any equal portion of Scripture: so much is this the case, that there are in fact three separate texts, it being hardly possible to unite them into one. (2) That in the original, the style, and manner of narrating, are entirely different from those of our Evangelist. It is not merely that many words and idioms occur which John never uses, but that the whole cast and character of the passage is alien from his manner, in whichever of the existing texts we read it. (3) The great majority of those MSS. which contain the passage, place it<i> here</i>. Some however insert it after the end of Luke xxi., which certainly seems a more fitting place, seeing that the incidents evidently belong to the later part of our Lord’s ministry. (4) I have adopted the plan also followed in the last edition of my Greek Testament, and have printed it beneath the text of St. John, which I have allowed to go on independently of the inserted passage. See the whole matter discussed and the authorities given, in my Greek Testament.
