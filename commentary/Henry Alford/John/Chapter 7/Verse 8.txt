In ver. 8, it is of little import whether we read<b> not</b> or<b> not yet</b>: the sense will be the same, both on account of the present,<b> go not up</b> (not ‘will not go up,’ which would express the disavowal of<i> an intention</i> to go up), and of “<i>not yet</i>,” which occurs afterwards.<b> I go not up</b> would mean,<b> I am not</b> (at present)<b> going up</b>. Meyer attributes to our Lord change of purpose, and justifies his view by the example of His treatment of the Syropheenician woman, whom He at first repulsed, but afterwards had compassion on. Matt. xv. 26 ff. The same Commentator directs attention to the emphatic term, “<b>this</b><i> feast</i>,” as implying that our Lord had it in His mind to go up to some future feasts, hut not to<i> this one</i>.<br><br><b> is not yet full come</b>: see Luke ix. 51 and note.
