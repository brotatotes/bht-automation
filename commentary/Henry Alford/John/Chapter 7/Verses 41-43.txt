Besides, we may note that De Wette’s “  probability, that John knew nothing of the birth at Bethlehem ,” reaches much further than may appear at first. If John knew nothing of it, and yet the mother of the Lord lived with him, the inference must be that  she knew nothing of it, in other words, that it never happened.
