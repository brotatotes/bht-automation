<p><strong> 6 9.</strong> ] <strong> ὁ καιρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁ ἐμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> can hardly be taken as directly meaning ‘ <em> the time of my sufferings</em> and death,’ but as ἡ ὥρα μου in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:4">John 2:4</span> : ‘My time for the matter of which you speak, viz. manifestation to the world.’ That (ch. Joh 12:32 ) was to take place in a very different manner. But <em> they</em> , having no definite end before them, no glory of God to shew forth, but being of the world, always had their opportunity ready of mingling with and standing well with the world. Then ( Joh 7:7 ), ‘ <em> you</em> have no hatred of the world in <em> your</em> way: but its hatred to Me on account of my testimony against it, causes me to exercise this caution which you so blame.’

<p>In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:8">John 7:8</span> , it is of little import (see var. readd.) whether we read <strong> οὐκ</strong> or <strong> οὔπω</strong> <strong> :</strong> the sense will be the same, both on account of the present, ἀναβαίνω (not ἀναβήσομαι , which would express the disavowal of <em> an intention</em> to go up), and of οὔπω afterwards. <strong> οὐκ</strong> ἀναβ . would mean, <strong> I am not</strong> (at present) <strong> going up</strong> . Meyer attributes to our Lord change of purpose, and justifies his view by the example of His treatment of the Syrophœnician woman, whom He at first repulsed, but afterwards had compassion on. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:26">Matthew 15:26</span> ff. The same Commentator directs attention to the emphatic ταύτην , as implying that our Lord had it in His mind to go up to some future feasts, but not to <em> this one</em> .

<p><strong> οὔπω πεπλήρ</strong> <strong> ., is not yet fully come</strong> : see Luk 9:51 and note.</p>
