<b> CHAP. VIII. 1.</b>] St. John<i> never elsewhere mentions the Mount of Olives</i> (not even in ch. xviii. 1): and when he introduces a new place, it is his habit to give explanations (see ch. 1. 45; xix. 13, 17). Stier, who says, “The simple answer to Alford’s remark is,<i> that John here, and here only, mentions the Mt. of O</i>.,” omits all allusion to this habit of the Evangelist, which<i> alone gives weight</i> to my remark.<br><br> Most of the many differences from the style and expression of St. John must be gathered from the notes in the Greek Test., as they cannot be made clear to the mere English reader.
