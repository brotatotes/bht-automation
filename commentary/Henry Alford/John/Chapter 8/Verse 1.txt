<b> CHAP. VIII. 1.</b>] St. John<i> never elsewhere mentions the Mount of Olives</i> (not even in ch. xviii. 1): and when he introduces a new place, it is his habit to give explanations (see ch. 1. 45; xix. 13, 17). Stier, who says, “The simple answer to Alford’s remark is,<i> that John here, and here only, mentions the Mt. of O</i>.,” omits all allusion to this habit of the Evangelist, which<i> alone gives weight</i> to my remark.
