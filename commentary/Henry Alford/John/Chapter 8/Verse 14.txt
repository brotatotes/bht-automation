This reason binds His testimony to that of the Father; for He came forth from the<br><br>—-------<br><br>those of younger ones are more tender.<br><br><b> alone</b>, i.e. with the multitude and the disciples; the woman standing between Him and the disciples on one hand,—and the multitude on the other.<br><br> “Light,” says Augustine, “demonstrates other things, and itself also... light gives testimony to itself: opens the eyes that are capable of beholding it, and is its own witness that<i> it may be known to be light</i>.”<br><br> Then again, he only who<i> knows</i> can witness: and Jesus only<i> knew</i> this.<br><br> Notice<b> I know whence I</b><i> came</i>:—this goes back to the “<i>existence in the beginning”</i> of ch. i. 1; but ye know not whence I come,— ‘do not recognize even My present mission.’<br><br> We must not, for a moment understand “<i>Though I bear witness</i>,” with Grotius, “<i>even though I Should bear witness</i>,”&c.: i.e. “<i>even though there were no previous testimonies to me of the prophets or of ‘John the Baptist</i>?” Our Lord’s words do not<i> suppose a case</i>, but<i> allows the fact</i>.<br><br> ‘The end of all<i> testimony</i>, is the forming, or pronouncing, of<i> judgment</i>. Ye do this by fleshly rules, concerning me and my mission: I judge no man, i.e. it is not the object nor habit of this My mission on earth; but even if I be called on to exercise judgment, my judgment is decisive:’ the word meaning not exactly<i> true</i> in its ordinary meaning, but rather,<b> genuine</b>; which a judgment can only be by being<i> true</i> and final; see ch. v. 30 and note.
