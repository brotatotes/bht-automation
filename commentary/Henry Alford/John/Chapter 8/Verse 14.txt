<p><strong> 14. </strong> <strong> ὅτι οἶδα</strong> κ . τ . λ .] See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:29">John 7:29</span> . This reason binds His testimony to that of the Father; for He came forth from the Father, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span> , and was returning to Him.

<p>“ <em> Lumen</em> ,” says Augustine (Tract. in Joan. xxxv. 4) “ <em> et alia demonstrat et seipsum.… Testimonium sibi perhibet lux: aperit sanos oculos et sibi ipsa testis est, ut cognoscatur lux</em> .”
	</p>
<p>Then again, he only who <em> knows</em> can witness: and Jesus only <em> knew</em> this.
	</p>
<p>Notice <strong> ἦλθον</strong> and <strong> ἔρχομαι</strong> , <strong> I know whence I</strong> <em> came:</em> this goes back to the ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span> ; <strong> but ye know not whence I</strong> <em> come</em> , ‘do not recognize even My present mission.’
	</p>
<p>We must not for a moment understand <strong> κἂν ἐγὼ μαρτ</strong> . with Grotius, “ <em> even though I should witness</em> ,” &amp;c.: “ <em> etiamsi nulla essent de me prœgressa prophetarum, nulla Joannis Baptistœ testimonia</em> .”
	</p>
<p>It does not <em> suppose a case</em> , but <em> allows the fact</em> .</p>
