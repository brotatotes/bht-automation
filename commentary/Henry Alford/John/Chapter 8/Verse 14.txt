 14.   ὅτι οἶδα κ . τ . λ .] See on ch. John 7:29 . This reason binds His testimony to that of the Father; for He came forth from the Father, ch. John 16:28 , and was returning to Him.
	“  Lumen ,” says Augustine (Tract. in Joan. xxxv. 4) “  et alia demonstrat et seipsum.… Testimonium sibi perhibet lux: aperit sanos oculos et sibi ipsa testis est, ut cognoscatur lux .”
	Then again, he only who  knows can witness: and Jesus only  knew this.
	Notice  ἦλθον and  ἔρχομαι ,  I know whence I  came: this goes back to the ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν of ch. John 1:1 ;  but ye know not whence I  come , ‘do not recognize even My present mission.’
	We must not for a moment understand  κἂν ἐγὼ μαρτ . with Grotius, “  even though I should witness ,” &c.: “  etiamsi nulla essent de me prœgressa prophetarum, nulla Joannis Baptistœ testimonia .”
	It does not  suppose a case , but  allows the fact .
