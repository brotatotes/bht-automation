 ‘The end of all<i> testimony</i>, is the forming, or pronouncing, of<i> judgment</i>. Ye do this by fleshly rules, concerning me and my mission: I judge no man, i.e. it is not the object nor habit of this My mission on earth; but even if I be called on to exercise judgment, my judgment is decisive:’ the word meaning not exactly<i> true</i> in its ordinary meaning, but rather,<b> genuine</b>; which a judgment can only be by being<i> true</i> and final; see ch. v. 30 and note.
