<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] The time and place of this discourse are not definitely marked; but in all probability they were the same as before. Only no stress must be laid on the <strong> οὖν</strong> as connected with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:20">John 8:20</span> , for it is only the accustomed carrying forward by the Evangelist of the great self-manifestation of Jesus.

<p><strong> ζητ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> με</strong> includes the idea ‘and shall not find me,’ which is expressed in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:34">John 7:34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:36">John 7:36</span> : <strong> ye shall continue seeking Me</strong> .

<p><strong> καὶ ἐν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἁμ</strong> <strong> .… and shall die</strong> (perish) <strong> in</strong> (not <em> because of</em> (Lampe, Kuinoel)) <strong> your sin.</strong> This sin is not <em> unbelief</em> , for, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:24">John 8:24</span> , it is clearly <em> distinguished from that:</em> but, ‘your <em> state of sin, unremoved</em> , and therefore <em> abiding and</em> <em> proving your ruin</em> ’ (see on Joh 8:24 ).

<p>The words do not refer to the destruction of Jerusalem, but to <em> individual perdition</em> . In these discourses in John, the <em> public</em> judgment of the Jews is not prominently brought forward, as in the other Evangelists.
	</p>
<p><strong> ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπ</strong> <strong> …</strong> is the <em> consequence</em> , not the <em> cause</em> (by any absolute decree) of their dying in their sins (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:34">John 7:34</span> ; Joh 13:33 ). This latter sense would have required ὅπου <strong> γάρ</strong> <strong> .</strong></p>
