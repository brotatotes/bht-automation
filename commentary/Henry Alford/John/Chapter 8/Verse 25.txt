<b> 25.]</b> Their question follows on the words “<i>I am from above</i>,” ver. 23, and on the dubious elliptical expression<i> I am (he)</i> of the last verse. It is intended to bring out a plain answer on which their enmity might fasten.<br><br> Our Lord’s reply has been found very difficult, from reasons which can hardly be explained to the English reader. The A.V., “<i>even the same that I said unto you from the beginning</i>,’ cannot well be right. The verb rather means to<b> speak</b> or<b> discourse</b>, than to<i> say</i>: the connecting particle cannot well be rendered “<i>even</i>:” and the word rendered “<i>from the beginning</i>” far more probably means “<b>essentially</b>,” or “<b>in very deed</b>.”<br><br> This being premised, the sentence must be rendered (literally) thus:<b> Essentially, that which I also discourse unto you</b>: or,<b> In very deed, that same which I speak unto you</b>. He is the Word—His<i> discourses are the revelation of Himself</i>. And there is especial propriety in this:—When Moses asked the name of God, ‘<i>I am that which I AM</i>,’ was the mysterious answer; the hidden essence of. the yet unrevealed One could only be expressed by self-comprehension; but when God manifest in the flesh is asked the same question, it is ‘I am that which I SPEAK?’ what He<i> reveals</i> Himself to be, that He<i> is</i> (see on next verse). The above sense is maintained by De Wette, and strikingly expanded and illustrated by Stier. See an account, and discussion, of other proposed interpretations, in my Greek Test.
