<p><strong> 25.</strong> ] Their question follows on <strong> ἐγὼ ἐκ τῶν ἄνω εἰμί</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:23">John 8:23</span> , and the dubious elliptical expression <strong> ἐγώ εἰμι</strong> of the last verse. It is intended to bring out a plain answer on which their enmity might fasten.

<p>Our Lord’s reply has been found difficult, principally from the ambiguity of ὅτι and ὅ τι . No sense can however be given by ὅτι which will at all harmonize with the context, notwithstanding Luthardt’s defence of it. Lücke’s interpretation (edn. 3) after Euthym [125] , “ <em> Why do I speak with you at all?</em> ” is not only ungrammatical, but most alien from the whole character of our Lord’s discourses. I assume then that ὅ τι is to be read. Then comes another question: what does <strong> λαλῶ</strong> mean? It has been usually rendered ‘ <em> say</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> tell;’ ‘even the same that I said unto you from the beginning</em> ,’ E. V. But as De Wette has observed, λαλῶ will not bear this. It is never ‘ <em> to say</em> ’ simply, but ‘ <em> to discourse</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> to hold converse</em> ,’ ‘ <em> to speak</em> .’ Again, what is <strong> τὴν ἀρχήν</strong> ? not to be taken substantively (as Aug [126] , Ambr [127] , Vulg. <em> principium</em> ), so as to mean ‘ <em> The beginning</em> , as I, &amp;c.’ (so recently, Bp. Wordsw.): but adverbially, with <em> all Greek interpreters</em> (see reff.). And adverbially it may mean (1) ‘ <em> in the beginning</em> ,’ ‘ <em> from the beginning</em> ,’ but not ‘ <em> firstly:</em> ’ (2) ‘ <em> generally</em> ,’ ‘ <em> at all</em> ,’ ‘ <em> omnino</em> ,’ usually with a negative clause, but sometimes with an affirmative. Thus Soph. Antig. 92, ἀρχὴν δὲ θηρᾶν οὐ πρέπει τἀμήχανα : Herod. i. 9, ἀρχὴν γὰρ ἐγὼ μηχανήσομαι οὕτω : iv. 25, τοῦτο οὐκ ἐνδέκομαι τὴν ἀρχήν : Plato, Lysis, p. 265, πῶς οὖν οἱ ἀγαθοὶ τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ἡμῖν φίλοι ἔσονται τὴν ἀρχήν ; See many more examples in Hermann on Viger, p. 722. The common rendering takes the first of these meanings; but the above remarks on λαλῶ will set that rendering aside; and together with the assumption of λαλῶ = ἔλεξα , the meaning, ‘ <em> in the beginning</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> at first</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> from the beginning</em> ,’ falls to the ground. We have then the second meaning of τὴν ἀρχήν , <strong> generally,</strong> or ‘traced up to its principle,’ for such is the account to be given of this meaning of the word.

	</p>
<p>The rendering of καί , ‘ <em> even</em> ,’ and placing it before τὴν ἀρχ ., as done in E. V., is ungrammatical. It must be taken with λαλῶ , being inseparable from it by its position between the relative ὅ τι and the verb: as in the clause, ὃς καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτόν .

<p>This being premised, the sentence must be rendered (literally) thus: <strong> Essentially, that which I also discourse unto you</strong> : or <strong> In very deed, that same which I speak unto you</strong> . He is the <strong> λόγος</strong> His <em> discourses</em> are the <em> revelation of Himself</em> . And there is especial propriety in this: When Moses asked the name of God, “ <em> I am that which</em> I AM,” was the mysterious answer; the hidden essence of the yet unrevealed One could only be expressed by self-comprehension; but when God manifest in the flesh is asked the same question, it is ‘I am that which I SPEAK:’ what He <em> reveals</em> Himself to be, that He <em> is</em> (see on next verse). The above sense is maintained by De Wette, and strikingly expanded and illustrated by Stier, iv. 378 ff., edn. 2. The meaning maintained by Meyer, “ <em> Do ye ask, what I have been long telling you?</em> ” is ingenious, but seems to be by implication refuted by what has been said above. He gives a good <em> résume</em> of the interpretations.</p>
