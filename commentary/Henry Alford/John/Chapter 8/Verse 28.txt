<p><strong> 28.</strong> ] This connects ( <strong> οὖν</strong> being the continuation of the foregoing, see above on Joh 8:21 ) with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:26">John 8:26</span> , and also with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:27">John 8:27</span> , as the <strong> τότε γνώσεσθε</strong> shews, referring to the <strong> οὐκ ἔγνωσαν</strong> <strong> .</strong> On <strong> ὑψ</strong> <strong> .</strong> see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:14">John 3:14</span> . ‘When ye shall have been the instruments of accomplishing that death by which He shall enter into His glory:’ for the latter idea is clearly implied here.

<p><strong> τότε γνώσ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Perhaps, in different ways: some, by the power of the Holy Spirit poured out after the exaltation of Christ, and to their own salvation; others by the judgments which were to follow ere long, and to their own dismay and ruin.

<p>The construction and connexion of the following appears to be this: <strong> καὶ ἀπ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἐμαυτοῦ</strong> <strong> …</strong> depends on <strong> ὅτι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and is an expansion of <strong> ἐγώ εἰμι</strong> : whereas Joh 8:29 is an independent assertion.

<p>The interchange of <strong> ποιῶ</strong> and <strong> λαλῶ</strong> is remarkable. The construction is not elliptical, so that <strong> ποιῶ κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λαλῶ</strong> should be understood in both cases; but the declaration of Joh 8:25 is still in the Lord’s mind, His <strong> ποιεῖν</strong> being all <em> a declaration of the Father</em> , a <strong> λαλεῖν</strong> in the widest sense. Cf. Bengel: “cognoscetis ex <em> re</em> , quod nunc ex verbo non creditis.”</p>
