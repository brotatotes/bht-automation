<p><strong> 33.</strong> ] The answerers are the πεπιστευκότες , not some others among the hearers, as many Commentators (Lampe, Kuinoel, De Wette, Lücke, edn. 3) have maintained; see, as a proof of this, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:36">John 8:36</span> , addressed to these same persons.

<p><strong> σπέρμα Ἀβ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐσμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:9">Matthew 3:9</span> . The assertion <strong> οὐδενὶ δεδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πώπ</strong> <strong> .</strong> was so contrary to historical truth, that we must suppose some technical meaning to have been attached to <strong> δεδουλεύκαμεν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> in which it may have been correct. The words cannot be meant of <em> that generation only</em> , for πώποτε connects with σπέρμα Ἀβ . ἐσ ., and generalizes the assertion.

<p>As usual (see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:4">John 3:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:11">John 4:11</span> ; Joh 6:52 ), they take the words of our Lord in their outward literal sense. Perhaps this was not always an <em> unintentional</em> misunderstanding.</p>
