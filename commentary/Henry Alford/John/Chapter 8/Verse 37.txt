 37. ] ‘Ye are Abraham’s seed, according to the flesh and the covenant: but’ and here the distinction appears ‘ye ποιεῖτε τὴν ἁμαρτίαν by seeking to kill Me, because My  λόγος (see above on Joh 8:31 )  οὐ χωρεῖ does not work (spread, go forward, ‘ne marche pas’)  in you’ (not,  among you). Herodian, ver. 3. 31, says of a report, ὥστε εἰς πᾶν  χωρῆσαι τὸ στρατιωτικόν , ‘it  spread through the whole army.’ Such expressions as τὰ πράγματα χωρεῖ κατὰ λόγον , Polyb. xxiii. 15. 12, ταῦτα καλῶς κατὰ νοῦν ἐχώρει αὐτῷ , ib. x. 15. 4, πῶς οὖν οὐ χωρεῖ τοὖργον ; Aristoph. Pax 464, seem also to illustrate this meaning.
