<b> 41. We were not born of fornication</b>] Stier remarks, that they now let fall Abraham as their father, being convicted of unlikeness to him. They see that a<i> spiritual</i> paternity must be meant, and accordingly refer to God as their Father. This consideration will rule the sense of the words<b> not born of fornication</b>, which must therefore be spiritual also. And spiritually the<b> children of fornication</b> (see Hos. ii. 4) are idolaters. Ishmael cannot well be alluded to; for they would not call the relation between Abraham and Hagar one of<i> fornication</i>. Still less can there be, as Origen thought, any allusion on the part of the Jews to our Lord giving Himself out as being miraculously born, but being in reality that which they would insinuate: for our Lord never proclaimed this of Himself. There may possibly be a reference to the<i> Samaritans</i> (ver. 48), who completely answered in the spiritual sense to the children of fornication: see Deut. xxxi. 16; Isa. i. 21; Ezek. xvi. 15 ff; xx. 30 al.
