	 ἐκ πορν  . ] Stier remarks, that they now let fall Abraham as their father, being convicted of unlikeness to him. They see that a  spiritual paternity must be meant, and accordingly refer to God as their Father. This consideration will rule the sense of  ἐκ πορν  ., which must therefore be spiritual also. And spiritually the  τέκνα πορνείας  , ref. Hosea, are idolaters. πολύθεος ὁ ἐκ πόρνης , τυφλώττων περὶ τὸν ἀληθῆ πατέρα , καὶ διὰ τοῦτο πολλοὺς ἀνθ ʼ ἑνὸς γονεῖς αἰνιττόμενος . Philo de Migr. Abr. 13, vol. i. p. 447. Ishmael cannot well be alluded to; for they would not call the relation between Abraham and Hagar one of πορνεία . Still less can Origen’s interpretation be adopted, ἔλεγον Ἡμεῖς μᾶλλον ἕνα πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν θεόν , ἤπερ σύ , ὁ φάσκων μὲν ἐκ παρθένου γεγεννῆσθαι , ἐκ πορνείας δὲ γεγεννημένος , καὶ διὰ τὸ αὐχεῖν τὸ ἐκ παρθένου γεγεννῆσθαι λέγων ἕνα πατέρα ἔχειν μόνον , τὸν θεόν (tom. John 20:14 , p. 327), for our Lord never proclaimed this of Himself. There may possibly be a reference to the  Samaritans ( Joh 8:48 ), who completely answered in the spiritual sense to the children of fornication: see Deuteronomy 31:16 ; Isaiah 1:21 ; Ezekiel 16:15 ff; Eze 20:30 alli [130] .
