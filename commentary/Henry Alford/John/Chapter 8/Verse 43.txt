 43. ]  λαλιὰν γινώσκειν is to  understand the idiom or dialect in which a man speaks,  λαλ  . being his  manner of speech : see Matthew 26:73 , and Song of Solomon 4:3 , LXX.  Why do ye not understand my speech? as E. V. But this of course does not here refer to the mere outward expression of the Lord’s discourses, but to the  spiritual idiom in which He spoke, and which can only be spiritually understood. Then  ὁ λόγος ὁ ἐμός is the  matter of those discourses, the Word itself.
	The connexion of the two clauses is,  Why , &c.?  Because ye  cannot  receive , hear with the inner ear (see reff., and ch. Joh 6:60 ),  that which I say . And the verification and ground of this ‘cannot’ is in the next verse. Meyer remarks, that in questions and answers, the emphatic words come  last being here  γινώσκετε and  τὸν λόγον τ  .   ἐμόν  .
