<b> 44.</b>] This verse is one of the most decisive testimonies for the<i> objective personality</i> of the devil. It is quite impossible to suppose an accommodation to Jewish views, or a metaphorical form of speech, in so solemn and direct an assertion as this.<br><br><b> ye like to do</b>] The rendering of the A.V. here, as in several other places where the same expression is used in the original (compare for instance ch. v. 40; Matt. xi. 27; Luke xi. 31), is wholly inadequate and misleading. The words “<i>Ye will do</i>” convey to the mind of the reader a mere<i> future</i>, whereas the original means,<b> your will is to do, you love,</b> or,<b> are inclined, to do.</b> The expression indicates, as in ch. v. 40, the<i> freedom of the human will, as the foundation of the condemnation of the sinner.</i><br><br><b> a murderer</b>] The most obvious reference seems to be, to the murder of Abel by Cain:—see the Apostle’s own comment on these words, 1 John iii. 12, 15. But this itself was only a result of the introduction of death by sin, which was the work of the devil: Adam and Eve were the<i> first</i> whom he murdered. But then again both these were only<i> manifestations</i> of the fact here stated by divine omniscience respecting him: that he was<i> a murderer.</i><br><br><b> from the beginning,</b> the author and bringer in of that hate which is<i> equivalent to murder,</i> 1 John iii. 15.<br><br> The mention of<b> murder</b> is introduced because the Jews went about to kill Jesus; and the typical parallel of Cain and Abel is certainly hinted at in the words.<br><br> The A.V. “<i>abode</i>,” is ungrammatical, the original word being<i> present</i> in sense. Still, it is not a<i> mere</i> present, but a present dependent on and commencing with an implied past fact. And that fact here is, the<i> fall</i> of the devil, which was not an insulated act, but in which state of apostasy from the truth he standeth,—it is his condition.<br><br><b> the truth</b> is<i> objective:</i><i> the</i><b> truth</b> of God:—in this<b> he standeth not,</b><i> because</i><b> there is no truth</b> ( ‘<i>truthfulness,</i>’<i> subjective</i>)<b> in him.</b> His<i> lie</i> has become his very nature, and therefore he is thoroughly alien from the truth of God. He shewed this when he spoke a lie to our first mother.<br><br><b> of his own,</b> not, ‘<i>according to his character,</i>’—but ‘out of his own resources,’ ‘treasures:’ see Matt. xii. 35.<br><br><b> the father thereof</b>] i.e. either<b> of that which is false,</b>—the<b> lie</b>, implied in the word<b> liar</b>, which has just preceded,—or, of the<i> liar generally</i>. The former is<i> not the fact,</i>—for the devil is not the father o<b> f that which is false,</b> but<b> of liars,</b> by being himself one whose very nature has become<i> a lie.</i> Certainly by this he has become the author, promoter, of falsehood among men; but this kind of paternity is not here in question: the object being to shew that he was the father of these lying Jews. I therefore hold the latter interpretation, with Bengel, Meyer, and Stier.
