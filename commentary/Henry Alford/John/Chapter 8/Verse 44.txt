<p><strong> 44.</strong> ] The first article τοῦ is important, and to be rendered (against Meyer) as in E. V., <strong> your father the devil</strong> . This verse is one of the most decisive testimonies for the <em> objective personality</em> of the devil. It is quite impossible to suppose an accommodation to Jewish views, or a metaphorical form of speech, in so solemn and direct an assertion as this.
	</p>
<p><strong> θέλετε</strong> ποιεῖν is important, and should have been in E. V. more marked: <strong> Your will is to do</strong> : or, as A.V.R. “ <strong> ye love to do</strong> ” [or, <strong> are inclined to do</strong> ]. It indicates, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:40">John 5:40</span> , the <em> freedom of the human will</em> , as the <em> foundation of the condemnation of the sinner</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀνθρωποκτόνος</strong> ] The most obvious reference seems to be, to the murder of Abel by Cain: see the Apostle’s own comment on these words, 1Jn 3:12 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:15">1 John 3:15</span> . But this itself was only a result of the introduction of death by sin, which was the work of the devil: Adam and Eve were the <em> first</em> whom he murdered. But then again both these were only <em> manifestations</em> of the fact here stated by divine omniscience respecting him: that he was ἀνθρωποκτόνος .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀπ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἀρχῆς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the author and bringer in of that hate which is ἀνθρωποκτονία , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:15">1 John 3:15</span> .
	</p>
<p>The mention of <strong> murder is</strong> introduced because the Jews went about to kill Jesus; and the <em> typical</em> parallel of Cain and Abel is certainly hinted at in the words: see Lücke’s note, ii. 338 ff., and Stier, iv. 414 (edn. 2) ff.

<p><strong> οὐχ ἕστηκεν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not ‘ <em> abode</em> not,’ E. V.; a sense which ἕστηκα will not bear, being always <em> present</em> in meaning, and = ‘I have placed myself,’ i.e. I <em> stand</em> : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:47">Matthew 12:47</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:6">Matthew 20:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:5">Mark 11:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:33">Acts 7:33</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span> ; Rom 11:20 alli [131] . fr.: whereas the pluperfect, εἱστήκειν , ‘I had placed myself,’ i.e. I <em> stood</em> , is <em> imperfect</em> in sense: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46">Matthew 12:46</span> . And that this place forms no exception, is shewn by ὅτι οὐκ <strong> ἔστιν</strong> (not ἦν ) immediately following. But as the account of this <em> present</em> sense shews, it is not a <em> mere</em> present, but a present dependent on and commencing with an implied past fact. And that fact here is, the <em> fall</em> of the devil, which was not an insulated act, but in which state of apostasy from the truth he <strong> ἕστηκεν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> it is his <em> status</em> . So Euthym [132] : ἐμμένει , ἀναπαύεται .

<p><strong> ἡ ἀλήθεια</strong> <strong> ,</strong> as De Wette remarks, is <em> objective: the</em> <strong> truth</strong> of God: in this <strong> he standeth not</strong> , <em> because</em> <strong> there is no truth</strong> (‘ <em> truthfulness,’ subjective</em> ) <strong> in him</strong> . His <em> lie</em> has become his very nature, and therefore he is thoroughly alien from the truth of God. To take <strong> ὅτι</strong> as ‘not the cause, but the proof’ ( <em> for</em> , i.e. ‘for we see it by this, that’ …) is not only to do violence to construction, but to overthrow the whole sense of the passage.

<p><strong> τὸ ψεῦδος</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <strong> a lie</strong> ; generic: we in English have retained the article in the expression ‘to speak the truth,’ but not in the corresponding one. He ἐλάλει τὸ ψεῦδος to Eve.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐκ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἰδ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> <strong> of his own</strong> , as E. V., not, ‘ <em> according to his character</em> ’ (De Wette), but ‘out of his own resources,’ ‘treasures:’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:35">Matthew 12:35</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁ πατ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> ] i.e. either τοῦ ψεύδους (absolutely, or as understood in ψεύστης , Orig [133] , Euthym [134] , Theophyl., &amp;c. Nitzsch (Theol. Zeitschrift, 1822), De Wette, Lücke, Wordsw., and Winer, § 22. 3. b), or τοῦ ψεύστου (= τῶν ψευστῶν ), <em> of the liar generally</em> . The former is <em> not the fact</em> , for the devil is not the father <strong> τοῦ ψεύδους</strong> <strong> ,</strong> but <strong> τῶν ψευστῶν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> by being himself one whose very nature has become τὸ ψεῦδος . Certainly by this he has become the author, promoter, of falsehood among men; but this kind of paternity is not here in question: the object being to shew that he was the father of these lying Jews. I therefore hold the latter interpretation, with Bengel, Meyer, and Stier.

<p>The construction of this passage with the art. before πατήρ has presented insuperable difficulty to Bp. Middleton and others: see Midd. in loc. The rendering which he proposes is this: “When (any of you) speaks that which is false, he speaks after the manner of his kindred ( ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων !), for he is a liar, and so also is his father,” i.e. the devil. To which the late Prof. Scholefield proposes an emendation, to take away the comma after ἐστίν , and translate, “For his father also is a liar,” not knowing, apparently, that this was the ancient heretical interpretation according to which the πατὴρ αὐτοῦ was the Demiurge: see Meyer, edn. 3, and Hilgenfeld, referred to by him as supporting this rendering. It is really almost incredible that learned men, students of our Lord’s discourses, should seriously uphold an interpretation so utterly absurd and preposterous. It is only an instance how the judgment may be warped by the adoption of canons respecting the article grounded on insufficient observation. The instances which Middleton adduces to prove that according to the ordinary rendering, the article must be omitted before πατήρ , none of them touch the question. The article here is <em> emphatic</em> , and could not be omitted, any more than in the sentence ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἄρτος τῆς ζωῆς . The simple account to be given of this construction, is that it = ὅτι ψεύστης ἐστίν , καὶ ὁ πατὴρ <strong> αὐτῶν</strong> : but by ψεύστης being singular, the pronoun is attracted into the singular also.</p>
