<b> 46.</b>] The meaning here of<b> sin</b> is to be strictly adhered to, and not softened into ‘<i>error in argument,</i>’ or ‘<i>falsehood.</i>’ This would be to introduce, in this most, solemn part of our Lord’s discourse, a vapid tautology. The question is an appeal to His<i> sinlessness of life</i>, as evident to them all,—as a pledge for His truthfulness of word: which word asserted, be it remembered, that<i> He was sent from God.</i> And when we recollect that He who here challenges men to convict him of sin, never could have upheld<i> outward</i> spotlessness merely (see Matt. xxiii. 26–28), the words amount to a declaration of His absolute sinlessness, in thought, word, and deed. Or, the connexion may be as stated by Enthymius: “<i>If it is not because I speak the truth that ye disbelieve me, tell me, which of you convicts me of any sin done by me, on account of which you may have a pretext for disbelieving?</i>”<br><br><b> If I say the truth</b>] and<b> if</b> it be thence (from the impossibility of convicting me of sin) evident, that<b> I speak the truth</b>,<i> why</i><b> do ye not believe me?</b> (not “<i>believe on me,</i>” but simply<b> believe me, give credence to me.</b>)
