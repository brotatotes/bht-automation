 46. ]  ἁμαρτία here is strictly  sin : not ‘  error in argument ,’ or ‘  falsehood .’ These two latter meanings are found in classical Greek, but never in the N.T. or LXX. And besides, they would introduce in this most solemn part of our Lord’s discourse, a vapid tautology. The question is an appeal to His  sinlessness of life , as evident to them all, as a pledge for His truthfulness of word: which word asserted, be it remembered, that  He was sent from God . And when we recollect that He who here challenges men to convict him of sin, never could have upheld  outward spotlessness merely (see Mat 23:26-28 ), the words amount to a declaration of His absolute sinlessness, in thought, word, and deed. Or, the connexion may be as stated by Euthym [135] : εἰ μὴ διότι τὴν ἀλήθειαν λέγω ἀπιστεῖτέ μοι , εἴπατε , τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐλέγχει με περὶ ἁμαρτίας ὑπ ʼ ἐμοῦ γενομένης , ἵνα δόξητε δι ʼ ἐκείνην ἀπιστεῖν ;
	 [135] Euthymius Zigabenus, 1116
	 εἰ ἀλ  .   λέγω ] And  if it be thence (from the impossibility of convicting me of sin) evident, that  I speak the truth ,  why  do ye not believe Me? (not πιστ .  εἰς ἐμέ , but simply  μοι  ,  give credence to Me .)
	Joh 8:47 gives the answer to the  διὰ τί  , and concludes the discourse with the final disproof of their assertion, John 8:41 , with, as it were, a ‘quod erat demonstrandum.’ This verse is cited 1 John 4:6 .
