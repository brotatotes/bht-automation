<p><strong> 46.</strong> ] <strong> ἁμαρτία</strong> here is strictly <strong> sin</strong> : not ‘ <em> error in argument</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> falsehood</em> .’ These two latter meanings are found in classical Greek, but never in the N.T. or LXX. And besides, they would introduce in this most solemn part of our Lord’s discourse, a vapid tautology. The question is an appeal to His <em> sinlessness of life</em> , as evident to them all, as a pledge for His truthfulness of word: which word asserted, be it remembered, that <em> He was sent from God</em> . And when we recollect that He who here challenges men to convict him of sin, never could have upheld <em> outward</em> spotlessness merely (see Mat 23:26-28 ), the words amount to a declaration of His absolute sinlessness, in thought, word, and deed. Or, the connexion may be as stated by Euthym [135] : εἰ μὴ διότι τὴν ἀλήθειαν λέγω ἀπιστεῖτέ μοι , εἴπατε , τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐλέγχει με περὶ ἁμαρτίας ὑπ ʼ ἐμοῦ γενομένης , ἵνα δόξητε δι ʼ ἐκείνην ἀπιστεῖν ;

	</p>
<p><strong> εἰ ἀλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λέγω</strong> ] And <strong> if</strong> it be thence (from the impossibility of convicting me of sin) evident, that <strong> I speak the truth</strong> , <em> why</em> <strong> do ye not believe Me?</strong> (not πιστ . <strong> εἰς ἐμέ</strong> , but simply <strong> μοι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <strong> give credence to Me</strong> .)

<p>Joh 8:47 gives the answer to the <strong> διὰ τί</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and concludes the discourse with the final disproof of their assertion, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:41">John 8:41</span> , with, as it were, a ‘quod erat demonstrandum.’ This verse is cited <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:6">1 John 4:6</span> .</p>
