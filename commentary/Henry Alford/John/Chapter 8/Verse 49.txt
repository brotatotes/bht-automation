<b> 49.</b>] The former term of reproach Jesus passes over, and mildly answers (1 Pet. ii. 23) the malicious charge of having a devil, by an appeal to his whole life and teaching (see ch. iv. 34), which was not the work of one having a devil. There is no<i> retort</i><i> of the charge</i> in the emphatic<b> I</b> (it is not<i> I</i> but<i> you</i> that have a devil), as Cyril and Lücke imagine. At present the<b> I</b>, followed by<b> you</b>, both emphatic, only brings out the two parties into stronger contrast.<br><br><b> and ye do dishonour me</b>] ‘Our mutual relation is not that which you allege, but this: that I honour Him that sent me, and ye, in dishonouring me, dishonour Him.’ It is the same contrast, the heiug (sprung) “<i>of</i> (from)<i> God</i>” and “<i>not of</i><i> God,</i>” as before, ver. 47, which lies at the root.
