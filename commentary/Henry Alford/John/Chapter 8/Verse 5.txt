 5. ] I will just remark that the very fact of their questioning thus, ‘Moses commanded, … but what sayest  Thou? ’ belongs to the  last days of the Lord’s ministry, and cannot well be introduced chronologically where it here stands: nor does John any where introduce these questions between the law of Moses and Jesus; but the synoptic Gospels often do.
	The command here mentioned is not to be found, unless ‘putting to death’ generally, is to be interpreted as =  stoning: compare Exodus 31:14 ; Exodus 35:2 , with Numbers 15:35-36 , in which the special order given by God would sanction such a view. But the Rabbis taught “omne mortis supplicium in scriptura absolute positum esse  strangulationem .” Tract. Sanhedr. ch. 10. (Lücke, De Wette.) The passage Ezekiel 16:38 ; Eze 16:40 proves nothing, or proves too much; for it is added, “and thrust thee through with their swords.”
	I would rather suppose that from Deuteronomy 22:21 ; Deuteronomy 22:23-24 , an inference was drawn  what kind of a death was intended in Deuteronomy 22:22 , the crime being regarded as the same; “  he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife .” We have similar indefiniteness in ib. John 8:25 , where evidently the same punishment is meant: see the whole matter discussed in Lücke, ii. 257 ff.
