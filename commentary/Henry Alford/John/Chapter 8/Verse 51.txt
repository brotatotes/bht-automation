<b> 51.</b>] There is no pause (De Wette) between ver. 50 and this. This is the direct carrying on of the discourse, arising out of<b> judgeth</b> in the last verse, and forming a new attempt of grace to plead with them, as Lampe calls it. Ye are<i> now</i> children of the devil, but if ye keep My word, ye shall be rescued from that<i> murderer.</i><br><br><b> to keep my word</b>, as “<i>to continue in my word,</i>” ver. 31, is not only outward obedience, but the endurance in, and obedience of faith.<br><br><b> to behold death,</b> as<b> to taste of death</b>, is a Hebrew way of speaking for<i> to die</i>, and must not be pressed to mean, ‘shall not<i> feel</i> (the bitterness of) death, in a temporal sense, as Stier has done. The<i> death of the body</i> is not reckoned as<i> death</i>, any more than the<i> life of the body</i> is<i> life</i>, in our Lord’s discourses; see ch. xi. 25, 26, and notes. Both words have a deeper meaning.
