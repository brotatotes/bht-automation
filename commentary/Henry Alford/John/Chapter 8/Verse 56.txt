<b> 56.</b>] The Lord does not deny them their<i> outward</i> title of children of Abraham:—it. is of spiritual things that He has been speaking, in refusing them the reality of it.<br><br><b> rejoiced to see</b>] literally,<b> rejoiced,</b><b> that He should see.</b> The intent is to shew that Abraham did in his time keep Christ’s word, viz. by a<i> prospective realizing faith;</i> and<i> therefore</i> that he, in the sense of ver. 51,<i> had not seen death.</i> This is expressed by<b> and he saw it, and was glad:</b> see below. But what is the meaning of<b> My day?</b> Certainly, the day of Christ’s appearance in the flesh.<i> When that was over,</i> and the attention was directed to another and future appearance, the word eame to he used of His<i> second coming,</i> 1 Cor. i. 8, &c. &c. But this, as well as<i> the day of His Cross</i>, is out of the question<i> here</i>;—and the word was used by the Rabbis for the time of the Messiah’s appearance. So we have it, Luke xvii. 22, 26: but here, as there, the expression must not be limited<i> exclusively</i> to the former appearance. From the sense, it is evident that Abraham saw by faith and will see in fact, not the first coming only, but that which it introduces and implies, the second also. Technically however, in the form of the sentence here, the First is mainly in view. And to<i> see</i> that day, is to be present at, witness, it;—to have experience of it.<br><br><b> and he saw it, and was glad,</b> viz. in his Paradisiacal state of bliss. And his ‘seeing of Christ’s day’ was not<i> by revelation</i>, but<i> actual</i>—the seeing of a witness. ‘Abraham then has not seen death, but lives through my word;—having believed and rejoiced in the promise of Me, whom he has now seen manifest in the flesh.’
