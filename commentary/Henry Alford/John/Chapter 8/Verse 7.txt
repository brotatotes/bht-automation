<b> 7</b>.] The expression, “<i>without sin</i>,” is not here used in the general sense, meaning,<i> entirely sinless</i>, nor in the strictest, ‘<i>free from the crime of adultery</i>’ (it can hardly be that any of the Pharisees should have held themselves<i> sinless</i>,—or that<i> all</i> should have been<i> implicated in adultery</i>):—but—as the word “<i>a sinner</i>,” in Luke vii. 37,—of the<i> sin of uncleanness</i> generally. Stier, who contends strongly for the<i> genuineness</i> of this narrative<i> in this place</i>, finds in ver. 46 an allusion to this saying. I cannot say that his attempts to establish a connexion with the subsequent discourse are to me at all satisfactory: I am much more inclined to think with Luthardt, that the whole arrangement and plan of our Gospel is broken by the insertion of this passage.
