<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] <strong> ἀναμάρτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is common in the classics: see instances in Lücke. It is not here used in the general sense, ‘ <em> without sin</em> ’ (E. V.), nor in the strictest, ‘ <em> free from the crime of adultery</em> ’ (it can hardly be that any of the Pharisees should have held themselves <em> sinless</em> , or that all should have been <em> implicated in adultery</em> ): but as ἁμαρτωλός , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:37">Luke 7:37</span> , of the <em> sin of uncleanness</em> generally. Stier, who contends strongly for the <em> genuineness</em> of this narrative <em> in this place</em> , finds in Joh 8:46 an allusion to this saying. I cannot say that his attempts to establish a connexion with the subsequent discourse are to me at all satisfactory: I am much more inclined to think with Luthardt (i. 16), that the whole arrangement and plan of our Gospel is broken by the insertion of this passage. The Lord Jesus was not sent to be a ruler and a judge in this or that particular case of crime, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:14">Luke 12:14</span> ; but the Ruler and Judge of <em> all:</em> and His answer expresses this, by convicting them <em> all</em> of sin before Him. τόν (see digest), if genuine, refers to the <em> first</em> stone, which by Deu 17:7 the <em> witnesses</em> were to cast.</p>
