 7. ]  ἀναμάρτ  . is common in the classics: see instances in Lücke. It is not here used in the general sense, ‘  without sin ’ (E. V.), nor in the strictest, ‘  free from the crime of adultery ’ (it can hardly be that any of the Pharisees should have held themselves  sinless , or that all should have been  implicated in adultery ): but as ἁμαρτωλός , Luke 7:37 , of the  sin of uncleanness generally. Stier, who contends strongly for the  genuineness of this narrative  in this place , finds in Joh 8:46 an allusion to this saying. I cannot say that his attempts to establish a connexion with the subsequent discourse are to me at all satisfactory: I am much more inclined to think with Luthardt (i. 16), that the whole arrangement and plan of our Gospel is broken by the insertion of this passage. The Lord Jesus was not sent to be a ruler and a judge in this or that particular case of crime, see Luke 12:14 ; but the Ruler and Judge of  all: and His answer expresses this, by convicting them  all of sin before Him. τόν (see digest), if genuine, refers to the  first stone, which by Deu 17:7 the  witnesses were to cast.
