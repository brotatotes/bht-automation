<b> 9</b>.] They had said, ver. 5, “<i>such women</i>”—they now perceive that they themselves were<i> such men</i>. There is no historical difficulty in this conduct of the Pharisees, as Olshausen finds;—they were struck by the power of the word of Christ. It was a case somewhat analogous to that in which His saying, “<i>I am he</i>,” struck His foes to the ground, ch. xviii. 6.<br><br> The variations of reading are very wide in the latter part of the verse. We can hardly (with some) lay any stress on “<i>beginning at the eldest</i>,” as indicating the<i> natural order</i> of conviction of sin. If the consciences of older sinners have heavier loads on them, deed of darkness had been detected in the night. But not to dwell on other objections to this view,—e. g. that such an allusion to the woman would be wholly out of character after our Lord’s previous treatment of her,—how come these Phari-sees, who on the hypothesis of the above Commentators are<i> the same as those who accused the woman, to be again so soon present</i>? Was this at all likely? We cannot escape from this difficulty with Stier, by supposing a multitude of the people to have been witnesses on both occasions: the “<i>Pharisees</i>” of the one must surely extend through the other, if<i> this con-nexion</i> is to be maintained.<br><br> On the other hand, this discourse comes in very well after ch. vii. 52. The last saying of Jesus (ch. vii. 37, 38) had referred to a festal usage then just over; He now adds another of the same kind. It was the custom during the first night, if not during every night, of the feast of tabernacles, to light up two large golden chandeliers in the court of the women, the light of which illuminated all Jerusalem. All that night they held a festal dance by the light.<br><br> Now granted that this was on the first night only,—what is there improbable in the supposition that our Lord—standing in the very place where the candlesticks had been or perhaps actually were—should have alluded to that practice, as He did to the outpouring of water in ch. vii. 87, 38? Surely to say in both cases, as Lücke and De Wette do, that the allusion could not have been made unless the usage<i> took place on that day</i>, is mere trifling.<i> While the feast lasted</i>, and the remembrance of the ceremonies was fresh, the allusion would be perfectly natural. See on ch. i. 9, and xi. 9, 10. See also Isa. xlii. 6; Mal. iv. 2; and on “<i>the light of life</i>,” ch. i. 4, and vi. 48.
