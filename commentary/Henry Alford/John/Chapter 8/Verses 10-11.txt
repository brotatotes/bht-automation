<p><strong> 10, 11.</strong> ] <strong> πλήν</strong> (v. r.) is only found here in John, Gosp. and Epp.

<p><strong> κατακρίνω</strong> also is not found elsewhere in John, who uses κρίνω in its strict sense for it. The question is evidently so worded for the sake of οὐδὲ ἐγώ σε κατακρίνω : but it expresses the truth in the depth of their hearts. The Lord’s challenge to them would lead to a condemnation <em> by comparison</em> with themselves, if they condemned at all: which they had not done. The words of Jesus were in fact a far deeper and more solemn testimony against the sin than could be any mere penal sentence. And in judging of them we must never forget that He who thus spoke knew the hearts, and what was the peculiar state of this woman as to penitence. We must not apply in all cases a sentence, which requires <em> His divine knowledge</em> to make it a just one. <strong> ]</strong></p>
