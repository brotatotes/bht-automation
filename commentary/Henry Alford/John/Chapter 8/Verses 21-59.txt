<p><strong> 21 59.</strong> ] <em> Further discourses of Jesus. The Jews attempt to stone Him</em> . This forms the great conclusion of the series of discourses to the Jews. In it our Lord testifies more plainly still to His divine origin and sinlessness, and to the cause of their unbelief; until at last their enmity is worked up to the highest pitch, and they take up stones to cast at Him. It may be divided into four parts: (1) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:21-24">John 8:21-24</span> , <em> announcing to them the inevitable consequence of persistence in their unbelief on His withdrawal from them:</em> (2) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:25-29">John 8:25-29</span> , <em> the things which He has to say and judge of them, and the certainty of their own future recognition of Him and His truthfulness:</em> (3) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:30-47">John 8:30-47</span> , <em> the first springing up of faith in many of them is by Him corrected and purified from Jewish pride, and the source of such pride and unbelief detected:</em> (4) <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48-58">John 8:48-58</span> , <em> the accusation of the Jews in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48">John 8:48</span></em> , <em> gives occasion to Him to set forth very plainly His own divine dignity and pr≈ì-existence</em> .</p>
