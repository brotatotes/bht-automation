 39, 40. ] There is a distinction between  σπέρμα and  τέκνα  . The former our Lord grants that they were ( Joh 8:37 ), but the latter (by implication see below on the construction) He denies them. See Romans 9:7 , οὐ γὰρ πάντες οἱ ἐξ Ἰσραήλ , οὗτοι Ἱσραήλ · οὐδ ʼ ὅτι εἰσὶν  σπέρμα Ἁβραάμ , πάντες  τέκνα  . The latter betokens  likeness , true genuine descent in character and habits.
	The reading in the text is remarkable as connecting together the present ἔστε and the imperfect  ἐποιεῖτε  . In such a case there must be a suppressed change of meaning between the protasis and the apodosis. The εἰ ἔστε concedes, in a certain sense: the ἐποιεῖτε denies, by making an assumption at variance with present fact. The sentence is in fact a combination of a protasis of one form with an apodosis of another. It might have been, (a) εἰ ἔστε …, ποιεῖτε ; or, (b) εἰ ἦτε …, ἐποιεῖτε . But as it stands, protasis (a) is joined with apodosis (b): and thereby the τέκνα τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ εἶναι in any worthy sense is denied, while in the mere formal sense it is conceded.
