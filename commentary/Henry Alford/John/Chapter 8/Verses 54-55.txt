<p><strong> 54, 55.</strong> ] The argument in these verses is: ‘The same God who is the God of Abraham, is my Father; He it is who honours (glorifies) me, and it is His word that I keep. I was promised by Him to Abraham.’

<p><strong> δοξάσω</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ‘glorify myself to this high designation, of being able to deliver from death.’

<p><strong> ὃν λέγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Whom you are in the habit of calling <em> your</em> God (for so of course the θεὸς ἡμῶν imports) i.e. the God of Israel. A most important identification, from the mouth of our Lord Himself, of <em> the Father</em> , with the <em> God of Israel</em> in the O.T. The <strong> καί</strong> here is not ‘ <em> but</em> ,’ nor ‘ <em> although;</em> ’ the sense is, <strong> of Whom ye say ‘He is our God,’ and know Him not</strong> . Then what follows sets forth the contrast between them, the pretended children of Abraham, who know not Abraham’s God (the <em> liars</em> ), and Him who knows Him, and keeps His word, so that His word works in and by Him; yea, He <em> is</em> ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ . His <em> allowing their denial</em> of this state of knowledge and union would be <em> as great a lie in Him</em> , as their <em> assumption</em> of it was <em> in them</em> .

<p>ὅμοιος <strong> ὑμῶν</strong> (instead of the more usual ὑμῖν ) signifies the being ‘one of them;’ as we say, ‘the like of them.’</p>
