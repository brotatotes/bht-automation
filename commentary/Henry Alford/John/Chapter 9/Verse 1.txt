<b> 1.</b>] If the concluding words of ch. viii. in the ordinary text are genuine, this would appear to have happened on the same day as the incidents there related, which is hardly likely, for we should thus have the whole history from eh. vii. 37 (omitting ch. vii. 53â€“viii, 12), belonging to one day, and that day a sabbath (ver. 14). And besides, the circumstances under which Jesus here appears are too usual and tranquil to have succeeded immediately to His escape in ch. viii. 59. I would rather therefore suppose that there is a break before this verse: how long, we cannot of course say. Thus we have the commencement of a new narrative here, as in ch.<br><br> vi. 1, and vii. 1.<br><br> The blind man was sitting begging (ver. 8), possibly proclaiming the fact of his having been so born; for otherwise the disciples could hardly have asked the following question. The incident may have been in the neighbourhood of the temple (Acts iii. 2): but doubtless there were other places where beggars sat, besides the temple entrances.
