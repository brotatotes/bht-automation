<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] This, if the concluding words of ch. 8. in the rec [141] . are genuine, would appear to have happened on the same day [as the incidents there related], which is hardly likely, for we should thus have the whole incidents from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span> (omitting ch. Joh 7:53 to Joh 8:12 ), belonging to one day, and that day a sabbath ( Joh 9:14 ). And besides, the circumstances under which Jesus here appears are too usual and tranquil to have succeeded immediately to His escape in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:59">John 8:59</span> . I would rather therefore suppose that there is a break before this verse: how long, we cannot of course say. Thus we have the commencement of a new narrative here, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1">John 6:1</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1">John 7:1</span> . This is the view of Lücke, Tholuck, and De Wette; Olshausen, Meyer, and Stier believe it to have been the same day; and the former refers the ἦν σάβ . ( Joh 9:14 ) to its being the last day of the feast (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span> , where see note).

<p>The blind man was sitting begging ( Joh 9:8 ), possibly proclaiming the fact of his having been so born; for otherwise the disciples could hardly have asked the following question. The incident may have been in the neighbourhood of the temple ( Act 3:2 ): but doubtless there were other places where beggars sat, besides the temple entrances.</p>
