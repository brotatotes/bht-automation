 11. ]  ἀνέβλ  ., strictly speaking, is in-appropriate in the case of one  born blind. Lücke refers to Aristotle as using the word thus, and cites Pausanias, who speaks of Ὀφιονέα … τὸν ἐκ γενετῆς τυφλόν , whom ἐπέλαβε τῆς κεφαλῆς ἄλγημα ἰσχυρόν , καὶ  ἀνέβλεψεν ἀπ ʼ αὐτοῦ . Sight being natural to men, the deprivation of it is regarded as a  loss , and the reception of it, though never enjoyed before, as a  recovery . So Grotius: “nec male  recipere quis dicitur, quod communiter tributum humanæ naturæ ipsi abfuit.” There is no emphasis on μου here (as Bp. Wordsw.) nor in John 9:15 ; John 9:30 : nor on σου in John 9:10 ; John 9:17 ; John 9:26 . See on Matthew 16:18 , and compare Luke 12:18 .
