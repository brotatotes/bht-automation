<b> 2.</b>] According to Jewish ideas, every infirmity was the punishment of sin (see ver. 34). From Exod. xx. 5, and the prevailing views on the subject, the disciples may have believed that the man was visited for the sins of his parents: but how could<i> he himself have sinned</i> before his birth? Beza and Grotius refer the question to the doctrine of the transmigration of souls, that he may have sinned in a former state of existence; this however is disproved by the consideration adduced by Lightfoot, that the Pharisees believed that the<i> good souls only</i> passed into other bodies, which would exclude this case. Lightfoot, LÃ¼cke, and Meyer refer it to the possibility of sin<i> in the womb</i>; Tholuck to<i> predestinated sin</i>, punished by anticipation: De Wette to the general doctrine of the pre-existence of souls, which prevailed both among the Rabbis and Alexandrians: see Wisd. viii, 19, 20.
