<p><strong> 24. </strong> <strong> δὸς δ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θεῷ</strong> ] Not, ‘Give God the praise’ (E. V.), i.e. ‘the glory of thy healing:’ for the Pharisees want to overawe the man by their authority, and make him deny the miracle altogether. The words are a form of <em> adjuration</em> (see ref. Josh.), <em> to tell the truth</em> , q. d. ‘Remember that you are in God’s presence, and speak as unto Him.’</p>
