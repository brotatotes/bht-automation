 24.   δὸς δ  .   τ  .   θεῷ ] Not, ‘Give God the praise’ (E. V.), i.e. ‘the glory of thy healing:’ for the Pharisees want to overawe the man by their authority, and make him deny the miracle altogether. The words are a form of  adjuration (see ref. Josh.),  to tell the truth , q. d. ‘Remember that you are in God’s presence, and speak as unto Him.’
