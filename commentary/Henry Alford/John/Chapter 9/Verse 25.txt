 25.   ὤν ] See on John 9:8 . The man shrewdly evades the inference and states again the simple fact. Bear in mind, that  ὤν must here be strictly kept to its  present sense , as being joined with a  present verb βλέπω : the rule for the construction of a pres. part. being, that it is contemporaneous with the verb which rules the time of the sentence. So that we must render, not ‘  whereas I WAS  blind, now I see ,’ as E. V.: but as A.V.R.,  being a blind man [or,  though a blind man ],  now I see. The shrewd and naïve disposition of the man furnishes the key to the ænigmatical expression. He puts it to them as the problem, the fact of which he knows for certain but the reason of which it was for them to solve, that he, whom they all knew as a blind man, now saw. So that the  ὤν carries not so much present matter of fact, as common designation and title.
