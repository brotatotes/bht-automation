There certainly seems to be some reference to its being the sabbath; see the similar expressions in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:17">John 5:17</span> . From <strong> ὅταν</strong> <strong> …,</strong> in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:5">John 9:5</span> , it seems evident that <strong> ἡμέρα</strong> is the appointed course of the working of Jesus on earth, and <strong> νύξ</strong> the close of it (see the parallel, ch. Joh 11:9-10 ). It is true, that, according to John’s universal diction, the death of Jesus is <em> His</em> glorification; but the similitude <em> here</em> regards the <em> effect on the world</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:5">John 9:5</span> ; and the language of Rom 13:12 is in accordance with it, as also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:53">Luke 22:53</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span> .</p>
