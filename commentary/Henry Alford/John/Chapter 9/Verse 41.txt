<p><strong> 41.</strong> ] The distinction in expression between the two clauses must be carefully borne in mind. Our Lord is referring primarily to the unbelief of the Pharisees and their rejection of Him. And He says, ‘If ye were really blind (not, ‘ <em> confessed yourselves</em> blind:’ Kuinoel, Stier, De Wette), ye would not have incurred guilt; but now ye say, “We see;” ye believe ye have the light, and boast that ye know and use the light; and <em> therefore</em> your guilt abideth, remaineth on you.’ Observe there is a middle clause understood, between ‘ye would never have incurred guilt,’ and ‘your guilt remaineth;’ and that is, ‘ <em> ye have incurred guilt;</em> ’ which makes it necessary to take the <strong> λέγετε ὅτι βλέπομεν</strong> as in a certain sense implying βλέπετε : viz. ‘by the Scriptures being committed to you, by God’s grace, which ought to have led you to faith in me.’</p>
