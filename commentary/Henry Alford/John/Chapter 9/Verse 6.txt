 6. ] See reff. Mark. The virtue especially of the saliva  jejuna , in cases of disorders of the eyes, was well known to antiquity. Pliny, [143] . [144] . xxviii. 7, says, “Lippitudines matutina quotidie velut inunctione arceri.” In both accounts (Suet. Vesp. 7: Tacitus, Hist. iv. 8) of the restoring of a blind man to sight attributed to Vespasian, the use of this remedy occurs. See also Wetstein in loc. (Trench, Miracles, 293 note, edn. 2). The use of clay also for healing the eyes was not unknown. Serenus Samonicus (in the time of Caracalla) says: “Si tumor insolitus typho se tollat inani, Turgentes oculos vili circumline cœno.”

C. xv.), denoted J or I by Wetstein and others; two are at Vienna (Imperial Library, Cod. Theol. Gr. Numbers 2:0 Lambec.), to which the notation N was formerly restricted; and six in the Vatican (No. 3785), called by Scholz Γ . Edited by Tischendorf in his Monumenta Sacra, 1846.” (Tregelles.) To these must now be added some further fragments collated by Tischendorf for his eighth edition.
	No rule can be laid down which our Lord may seem to have observed, as to using, or dispensing with, the ordinary human means of healing. He Himself determined by considerations which are hidden from us. Whatever the means used, the healing was not in  them , but in Him alone. The ‘conductor’ of the miraculous power was generally the  faith of the recipient: and if such means served to awaken that faith, their use would be accounted for.
