<b> 6.</b>] See Mark vii. 33; viii. 23. The virtue especially of the<i> fasting</i> saliva, in cases of disorders of the eyes, was well known to antiquity. In the accounts of the restoring of a blind man to sight attributed to Vespasian, the use of this remedy occurs. The use of<i> clay</i> also for healing the eyes was not unknown. No rule can be laid down which our Lord may seem to have observed, as to using, or dispensing with, the ordinary human means of healing. He Himself determined, by considerations which are hidden from us. Whatever the means used, the healing was not in<i> them</i>, but in Him alone. The ‘conductor’ of the miraculous power was generally the<i> faith</i> of the recipient: and if such means served to awaken that faith, their use would be accounted for.
