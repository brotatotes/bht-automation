The similitude would not find any proprietary as applied to the<i> planets</i>, properly so called: for there can be no allusion to the astronomical fact of their being naturally opaque bodies, as Bengel imagines. Many Commentators have supposed that the similitude is to be understood of teachers, who would enlighten others, and yet are doomed to darkness themselves: so Œeumenius, comparing the transformation into an angel of light, 2 Cor. xi. 14. But the context does not justify this. Rather should we say, these professing Christians, by their profession lights in the world, instead of letting that light shine on more and more into the perfect day, are drifting about in strange errors of doctrine and practice till it will be utterly extinguished in eternal darkness).<br><br> being the sacred number may have been in view, as Bengel: “The word is not without mystery, seeing that immunity from death and the sacred number concur.” Several similar designations are quoted: e.g. Philo alleges Moses to have been the seventh generation from Abraham. A rabbinical writer on Numb. xxv. 12, says, “Phineas was the seventh progeny from Jacob our father”),<b> saying, Behold, the Lord</b> ( “the name Jehovah [of which the Lord is the rendering] was already known in the time of Enoch,” Bengel)<b> came</b> (the historic tense of prophecy)<b> among</b> (in, as surrounded by)<b> His holy myriads</b> (of angels: see Deut. xxxiii 2: Zech. xiv. 5, Heb. xii, 22),<b> to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the impious concerning all their works of impiety which they impiously did, and concerning all the hard things which impious sinners spoke against Him.</b>—I have discussed in the Introduction the question as to the source of this citation, and its relation to the present apocryphal book of Enoch. I will only here set down the passage as it at present stands in De Sacy’s version: “And He came with ten thousands of His holy ones, to hold judgment: on them, and destroy the impious, and fight with all carnal men for all things which sinners and impious men have done and wrought against Him.”
