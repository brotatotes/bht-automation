<b>to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the impious concerning all their works of impiety which they impiously did, and concerning all the hard things which impious sinners spoke against Him.</b>—I have discussed in the Introduction the question as to the source of this citation, and its relation to the present apocryphal book of Enoch. I will only here set down the passage as it at present stands in De Sacy’s version: “And He came with ten thousands of His holy ones, to hold judgment: on them, and destroy the impious, and fight with all carnal men for all things which sinners and impious men have done and wrought against Him.”
