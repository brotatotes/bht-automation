<b> 19.</b>]<i> Last characteristics of these men.</i><b> These are they that separate</b> (or “are separating,” viz. from the Church, having no real sympathy with the spirit of the Gospel:—that draw lines of distinction, by walking after their own desires, not in the path of the Church’s obedience, thus separating both themselves from you, and you from themselves),<b> sensual</b> (we have no English word for the quality here implied in the Greek word<i> psychíkos</i>; and our biblical psychology is, by this defect, entirely at fault. The<b> psyche</b> is the centre of the personal being, the “I” of each individual. It is in each man bound to the man’s higher part, and to the body, man’s lower part; drawn upwards by the one, downwards by the ether. He who gives himself up to the lower appetites, is<i> fleshly</i>: he who by communion of his<i> spirit</i> with God’s Spirit is employed in the higher aims of his being, is<i> spiritual</i>. He who rests midway, thinking only of self and self’s interests, whether animal or intellectual, is the<b> psychikos</b>, the selfish man, the man in whom the spirit is sunk and degraded into subordination to the subordinate<b> psyche</b>. In the lack of any adequate word, I have retained the “sensual” of the A.V., though the impression which it gives is a wrong one: “selfish” would be as bad, for the<b> psychikos</b> may be an amiable and generous man; “animal” would be worse: “intellectual,” worse still. If the word were not so ill-looking in our language, “psychic” would be a great gain),<b> not having the spirit</b> (see above, not directly the Holy Spirit of God, but the higher spiritual life of man’s spirit in communion with the Holy Spirit. These men have not indeed ceased to have a spirit, as a part of their own tripartite nature: but they have ceased to possess it in any worthy sense: it is degraded beneath and under the power of the<b> psyche</b>, the personal life, so as to have no real vitality of its own).
