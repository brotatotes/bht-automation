<b>keep yourselves</b> (in the original, said of the one great life-long act to be accomplished by the<i> building up</i> and<i> praying</i>)<b> in the love of God</b> (within that region of peculiar love wherewith God regards all who are built up on the faith and sustained by prayer:<b> of God</b> being a subjective genitive, “God's love,” not objective, the love towards God. The expression is very like “<i>abide in my love,</i>” John xv. 9, where “<i>I also loved you</i>” preceding fixes the meaning to be Christ’s love to them),<b> looking for</b> (present. participle, as in Tit. ii, 13, where see note. It is to be the habit of the life, as those other present participles,<i> building up</i> and<i> praying</i>)<b> the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ</b> (viz. that which He will shew at His coming. Huther remarks that<i> mercy</i>, more usually predicated of the Father, is in the addresses of the Pastoral Epistles, and of 2 John, attributed to the Father and Son jointly)<b> unto eternal life</b> (these words may be joined with<b> mercy</b>,—that mercy, whose issue shall be eternal life; or with<b> looking for</b>,—as the issue and aim of the expectation; or with<b> keep yourselves</b>,—as the final terminus of that watchful guarding. Perhaps the right choice between the three will be to combine the two last: for<b> keep yourselves</b> is subordinate and conditional to<b> looking for</b>: “keep yourselves... in expectation of... unto”). The direct and studied reference to the Blessed Trinity will not escape the reader.
