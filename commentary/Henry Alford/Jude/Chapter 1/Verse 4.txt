<b> 4.</b>]<b> For there crept in</b> (not “<i>are... crept in:</i>” the past tense explains the arising of the occasion of his thus writing. On<b> crept in</b>, see 2 Pet. ii. 1, and note: also Gal. ii. 4. Secrecy, and lack of legitimate introduction, are plainly expressed in the word. “<i>Crept in,</i>” viz. into the Christian church)<b> of old certain men</b> (it las been observed that the term<b> certain men</b> has a tinge of contempt about it), [<b>men</b>]<b> who have been of old written down in prophecy</b> (to what time and fact are we to refer such designation of them? Clearly not to God’s eternal purpose, in this place, from the term<b> of old</b>, which, as Huther remarks, is never used of that purpose, but points to some fact<i> in time</i>. And if so, then the previous writing down of these men can only point to the Old Test. prophecies. What special description of them is intended, might be difficult to say were it not for the quotation below, ver. 17, from the prophecy of Enoch. The warnings contained in the historical facts adduced below may also be meant. It may be observed that the ultra-predestinarians, Beza and Calvin, find, as we might expect, strong defence for their views in their interpretation here. Beza indeed gathers from this place, “that this eternal decree of God comprehended not only the event, but even principally, the persons themselves involved in it”)<b> to this judgment</b> (what judgment, or rather result of judgment? that presently to be mentioned: the sentence which St. Jude has in his mind, and proceeds in the following verses to unfold.<b> judgment</b>, as so often, though not the same as<i> condemnation</i>, yet gets the condemnatory meaning from the character of the context),<b> impious, changing the grace of our God</b> (i. e. the gift of grace, the state of salvation, in which our sins are forgiven us and we are admitted into the freedom of God's children. Of<b> our</b> God; drawing closer the bond of God’s true children to Him and one another, and thus producing greater abhorrence of those who have thus abused His grace)<b> into lasciviousness</b> (the words<i> might</i> mean, “perverting the grace of our God in the direction of, for the purposes of lasciviousness:” but the meaning of the verb used is simply to change, not to pervert: and we therefore must understand, as above, that they made the state of grace and Christian liberty into a state of [moral] licence and wantonness),<b> and denying</b> (see 2 Pet. ii, 1)<b> the only Master, and our Lord Jesus Christ</b> (in 2 Pet. ii. 1<b> Master</b> is used of Christ: which circumstance might tempt us to refer it to Christ here also. But probability seems to weigh on the other side. In every other place [Luke ii, 29, Acts iv. 24, Rev. vi. 10, Jer. iv. 10 in the Septuagint translation]<b> Master</b> is used of God: 2) the addition “<i>only</i>” seems to bind this meaning to it here: 3) the denial of God by disobeying His law is the explanatory resumption of the last clause: 4) Master and Lord are hardly distinguishable, if both applied to Christ).
