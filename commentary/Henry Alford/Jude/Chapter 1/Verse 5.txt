<b> 5.</b>]<i> First example:</i> unbelieving Israel in the wilderness. See Heb. iii. 16–iv. 5.<b> But</b> (solemn contrast to the conduct just mentioned)<b> I wish to remind you, knowing as ye do</b> (better here than “although ye know,” on account of the term “<i>once for all</i>” which follows. The A.V. is altogether wrong)<b> once for all</b> (i. e. having once for all received the Knowledge of)<b> all things</b> (all that refers to that of which I am speaking: the clause carries with it a latent admonition, to apply other examples for yourselves),<b> that Jesus</b> (critical principles seem to require this remarkable reading. It is not entirely precedented by 1 Cor. x. 4: for there St. Paul uses not the personal human name, but “<i>Christ,</i>” in which there is no such difficulty. The only account to be given seems, that, the Person designated by the two names being the same, they became sometimes convertibly used in popular exhortation),<b> having saved the people</b> (on the fact, see Exod. xiv. 19, xxxiii. 20. 23, xxxii. 2, Isa. lxiii. 9, in which last place however the Septuagint version has “<i>Out of all their affliction not an ambassador, nor yet an angel, but he himself named them”</i>)<b> out of the land of Egypt, secondly</b> (not as A.V., “<i>afterward,</i>” but it indicates a second deed of the Lord, His first-mentioned having been the deliverance out of Egypt)<b> destroyed them that believed not</b> (viz. by forbidding their entrance into the land of promise [see Heb. iii. 18], and slaying them in the wilderness. This example is not mentioned in 2 Pet. ii., but instead of it, the judgment of the flood).
