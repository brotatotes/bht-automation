<b> 6.</b>]<i> Second example:</i> the rebel angels. See 2 Pet. ii. 4.<b> And</b> (the connexion with the foregoing is very close)<b> angels, those which kept not</b> (<b>angels</b> is probably indefinite, and then what follows designates those angels who are meant)<b> their own dignity</b> (some interpret as A.V., “<i>first estate,</i>” “original condition;” some again, “<i>the government which was over them,</i>” viz. that of God. But seeing that angels are often in the New Test. called “<i>governments,</i>” or “<i>powers,</i>” as they also were among the Jews, and that such meaning answers best to the parallel clause which follows, there can be little doubt that the rendering<i> government</i>, or<i> principality</i>, or<i> dignity</i>, is right. The fact alluded to is probably that which is obscurely indicated in Gen. vi. 2. See Introduction),<b> but left their own</b> [<b>proper</b>]<b> habitation</b> (viz. heaven),<b> He hath kept</b> (in sharp contrast to “<i>which kept not</i>”)<b> against the judgment of the great day</b> (at the end of the world)<b> in eternal bonds under darkness</b> (the darkness being considered as brooding over them, and they under it. There is apparently a difference, which we cannot explain, between the description of the rebel angels here and in the parallel place, 2 Pet. ii. 4, and that in the rest of the New Test., where the devil and his angels are said to be powers of the air, and to go about tempting men. But perhaps we are wrong in absolutely identifying the evil spirits mentioned here with those spoken of in 2 Peter).
