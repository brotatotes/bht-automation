See 2 Pet. ii. 6.<b> How</b> (not “<i>even as,</i>” as A.V.)<b> Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, following fornication in like manner to these</b> (i. e. to the angels above mentioned. The manner was similar, because tho angels committed fornication with another race than themselves, thus also<i> going away after strange flesh</i>),<b> and going away after</b> (it was a departure from the appointed course of nature, and seeking after that which was unnataral)<b> other flesh</b> (than that appointed by God for the fulfilment of natural desire.

But in all probability Sodom and Gomorrah must be numbered among those whose sin went further even than this: compare Lev. xviii. 22–25. See 2 Pet. ii. 10),<b> are</b><b> set forth as an example, undergoing</b> (to this day, present participle; alluding to the natural phenomena of the Dead Sea)<b> the just punishment of eternal fire</b> (the sense is, undergoing the punishment, as even now be seen, of eternal fire: of that fire which shall never be quenched).
