<p><strong> 9</strong> .] <strong> But Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed concerning the body of Moses, dared not</strong> (by the context, from reverence for Satan’s former glory) <strong> bring against him a judgment of evil speaking</strong> (i. e. as E. V., a railing accusation: a sentence savouring of, belonging to, βλασφημία ; not as Calov., “ultionem de blasphemia sumere:” the blasphemy is not one spoken <em> by</em> , but <em> against</em> , the devil), <strong> but said, The Lord rebuke thee</strong> (the source of the tradition to which St. Jude here refers as familiar to his readers, is not known with any certainty, Origen, περὶ ἀρχῶν , iii. 2. 1, vol. i. p. 138, says, “primo quidem in Genesi serpens Evam seduxisse describitur: de quo in Adscensione Mosis, cujus libelli, meminit in Epistola sua Apostolus Judas, Michael archangelus cum diabolo disputans de corpora Mosis, ait …” Œc. h. l. says, λέγεται τὸν Μιχαὴλ τὸν ἀρχάγγελον τῇ τοῦ Μωϋσέως ταφῇ δεδιηκονηκέναι , τοῦ διαβόλου τοῦτο μὴ καταδεχομένου , ἀλλ ʼ ἐπιφέροντος ἔγκλημα αὐτῷ τοῦ Αἰγυπτίου φόνου , ὡς αὐτοῦ ὄντος τοῦ Μωϋσέως , καὶ διὰ τοῦτο μὴ συγχωρεῖσθαι αὐτὸν τυχεῖν ἐντίμου ταφῆς . No such tradition is found in any apocryphal or rabbinical book now extant. In the targum of Jonathan in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+34:6">Deuteronomy 34:6</span> , it is stated that the grave of Moses was given into the special custody of Michael. See also several Rabbinical legends having more or less reference to the point in Wetstein. Some, mentioned as early as Severus in the Catena, have given an allegorical interpretation, understanding by τὸ σῶμα Μωϋσέως the law, or Jewish polity, or even people: and, thus interpreting, fix the occasion very variously: at the giving of the law ( τινές in Severus): at the siege under Hezekiah, or the rebuilding under Zerubbabel (Starck, in Wolf). All such explanations are of course out of the question: and the literal matter of fact alone to be held fast. It is, however, remarkable, that the same words, ἐπιτιμήσαι ( ἐν ) σοι κύριος , are spoken by the angel ( κύριος , LXX) to the devil in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:1-3">Zechariah 3:1-3</span> . This has led some, e. g. Bed e , to imagine, that this was the occasion referred to, when Joshua and Satan stood as adversaries concerning the deliverance of Israel from captivity. Another and more curious explanation is given in the Catena: ὅτε ἤγαγεν ( ὁ Μιχαὴλ ) Μωϋσῆν ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἔνθα μετεμορφώθη ὁ κύριος , τότε ἔλεγεν ὁ διάβολος τῷ Μιχαήλ , ἐψεύσατο ὁ θεὸς εἰσαγαγὼν τὸν Μωϋσῆν , ἔνθα ὤμοσε μὴ εἰσελθεῖν αὐτόν . The whole matter is thoroughly discussed, and every source of illustration exhausted, in Rampf, Der Brief Judæ u. s. w. pp. 201 253. His conclusion, in which I entirely agree, is that St. Jude took the incident from primitive tradition, which tradition slightly modified, is also given by the prophet Zechariah. That the incident is related as matter of fact, and not as an “argumentum ad hominem,” is evident by the very form of it. That, being thus related as matter of fact, it <em> is</em> matter of fact, is a conclusion which will or will not be made, according as we are or are not persuaded of the authenticity of our Epistle as a part of canonical Scripture: and according as we esteem that canonical Scripture itself).</p>
