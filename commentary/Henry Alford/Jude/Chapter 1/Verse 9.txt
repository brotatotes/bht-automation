<b> 9.</b>]<b> But Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed concerning the body of Moses, dared not</b> (by the context, from reverence for Satan’s former glory)<b> bring against him a judgment of evil speaking</b> (i. e. as<br><br> A.V.<i> a railing accusation:</i> a sentence savouring of, belonging to,<i> evil speaking</i>),<b> but said, The Lord rebuke thee</b> (the source of the tradition to which St. Jude here refers as familiar to his readers, is not known with any certainty. Origen says, “In the Ascension of Moses, of which book the Apostle Jude makes mention in his Epistle, Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil concerning the body of Moses, says...” No such tradition is found in any apocryphal or rabbinical book now extant. In the targum of Jonathan on Deut. xxxiv. 6, it is stated that the grave of Moses was given into the special custody of Michael. Some have given an allegorical interpretation, understanding by<b> the body of Moses</b> the law, or Jewish polity, or even people: and, thus interpreting, fix the occasion very variously: at the giving of the law: at the siege under Hezekiah, or the rebuilding under Zerubbabel. All such explanations are of course out of the question: and the literal, matter of fact alone to be held fast. It is, however, remarkable, that the same words,<b> The Lord rebuke thee</b>, are spoken by the angel to the devil in Zech. iii. 1–3. This has led some, e.g. Bede, to imagine, that this was the occasion referred to, when Joshua and Satan stood as adversaries concerning the deliverance of Israel from captivity. The only straightforward conclusion is, that St. Jude took the incident from primitive tradition, which tradition, slightly modified, is also given by the prophet Zechariah. That the incident is related as matter of fact, and not as an “argumentum ad hominem,” is evident by the very form of it. That, being thus related as matter of fact, it<i> is</i> matter of fact, is a conclusion which will or will not be made, according as we are or are not, persuaded of the authenticity of our Epistle as a part of canonical Scripture: and according as we esteem that canonical Scripture itself).
