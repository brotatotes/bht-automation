<p><strong> 14, 15</strong> .] <em> Prophecy of Enoch respecting them</em> : see below. <strong> Yea, and</strong> ( <strong> δὲ καί</strong> are better taken together, applying to the whole sentence, than separated, joining καί with τούτοις , “of these as well as of others,” for no other prophecies of Enoch are alluded to) <strong> of these</strong> ( <strong> προφητεύειν</strong> is usually joined with περί : here and in ref. only ( γεγραμμένα ) with a dat. It is the dat. of reference, answering to πρὸς αὐτούς , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:12">Mark 12:12</span> : see Winer, edn. 6, § 31. 4) <strong> prophesied Enoch seventh from Adam</strong> (“ut vaticinii antiquitatem commendet,” Calv. Possibly also the fact of seven being the sacred number may have been in view, as Bengel: “mysterii non expers, in quo immunitas a morte et numerus sanctus concurrunt.” Cf. Wetstein’s note, in which several similar designations are quoted: e. g. Philo, Vit. Mos. i. 2, vol. ii. p. 81, alleges Moses to have been the seventh generation from Abraham. R. Berbai, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:12">Numbers 25:12</span> , says, “Erat autem Phineas septima progenies a Jacobo patre nostro,” &amp;c.), <strong> saying, Behold, the Lord</strong> (“Jam Henochi tempore nomen Jehovah notum erat,” Bengel) <strong> came</strong> (the historic tense of prophecy) <strong> among</strong> (in, as surrounded by) <strong> His holy myriads</strong> (of angels: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+33:2">Deuteronomy 33:2</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:5">Zechariah 14:5</span> , Heb 12:23 ), <strong> to execute judgment</strong> (reff.) <strong> upon all, and to convict all the impious concerning all their works of impiety which they impiously did, and concerning all the hard things which impious sinners spoke against Him</strong> . I have discussed in the prolegomena the question as to the source of this citation, and its relation to the present apocryphal book of Enoch. I will only here set down the passage as it at present stands in De Sacy’s version: “Et venit cum myriadibus sanctorum, ut faciat judicium super eos et perdat impios et litiget cum omnibus carnahbus pro omnibus quæ fecerunt et operati sunt contra eum peccatores et impii.”</p>
