 14, 15 .]  Prophecy of Enoch respecting them : see below.  Yea, and (  δὲ καί are better taken together, applying to the whole sentence, than separated, joining καί with τούτοις , “of these as well as of others,” for no other prophecies of Enoch are alluded to)  of these (  προφητεύειν is usually joined with περί : here and in ref. only ( γεγραμμένα ) with a dat. It is the dat. of reference, answering to πρὸς αὐτούς , Mark 12:12 : see Winer, edn. 6, § 31. 4)  prophesied Enoch seventh from Adam (“ut vaticinii antiquitatem commendet,” Calv. Possibly also the fact of seven being the sacred number may have been in view, as Bengel: “mysterii non expers, in quo immunitas a morte et numerus sanctus concurrunt.” Cf. Wetstein’s note, in which several similar designations are quoted: e. g. Philo, Vit. Mos. i. 2, vol. ii. p. 81, alleges Moses to have been the seventh generation from Abraham. R. Berbai, on Numbers 25:12 , says, “Erat autem Phineas septima progenies a Jacobo patre nostro,” &c.),  saying, Behold, the Lord (“Jam Henochi tempore nomen Jehovah notum erat,” Bengel)  came (the historic tense of prophecy)  among (in, as surrounded by)  His holy myriads (of angels: cf. Deuteronomy 33:2 : Zechariah 14:5 , Heb 12:23 ),  to execute judgment (reff.)  upon all, and to convict all the impious concerning all their works of impiety which they impiously did, and concerning all the hard things which impious sinners spoke against Him . I have discussed in the prolegomena the question as to the source of this citation, and its relation to the present apocryphal book of Enoch. I will only here set down the passage as it at present stands in De Sacy’s version: “Et venit cum myriadibus sanctorum, ut faciat judicium super eos et perdat impios et litiget cum omnibus carnahbus pro omnibus quæ fecerunt et operati sunt contra eum peccatores et impii.”
