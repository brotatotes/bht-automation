 17, 18 .]  Exhortation to remember how the Apostles forewarned them of these men .  But ye, beloved (see again below, Jud 1:20 ),  remember the words which were before spoken (not “prophesied:” see reff.)  by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ (this can hardly be cited as evidence on one side or the other on the question whether St. Jude himself was an Apostle. He  might use the expression, being himself an Apostle: be is certainly more likely to have used it, not being one. According to the critical text, St. Peter uses the same expression, without the ἡμῶν , 2 Peter 3:2 : and whichever view is taken as to the genuineness or otherwise of 2 Peter, there could be no intention by such an expression to exclude either the real or the pretended St. Peter from the number of the Apostles),  that they told you (whether by writing, or by word of mouth, does not appear: so that we cannot say, with Bengel, “ergo hi, ad quos Judas scribit, cæteros quoque Apostolos audierant.” It is worthy of remark that he does not say ἔλεγον  ἡμῖν , but  ὑμῖν ; hereby again not indeed making it certain that he included himself among the Apostles, but making it very uncertain, whether he intends to  exclude himself)  that at the last of the time (see notes on 2 Peter 3:3 : Hebrews 1:1 : 1 Peter 1:20 ; = at the end of the world, in the last age of the Church)  there shall be scoffers (men who sport with what is holy and good; the λοιμοί of Psalms 1:1 . The prophecy is contained in 2 Timothy 3:1 , 1 Timothy 4:1 , Acts 20:29 , and doubtless formed a constant subject of viva voce warning. 2 Peter 3:1-2 , can hardly be supposed to be referred to, for that place is, as this, a reminiscence of things before said by the Apostles, and nearly in the same words),  walking according to their own lusts of impieties (  ἀσεβειῶν , gen. after ἐπιθυμίας , indicating the direction, or perhaps the character, of those desires. Cf. the same words above, Jud 1:16 ).
