<p><strong> 17, 18</strong> .] <em> Exhortation to remember how the Apostles forewarned them of these men</em> . <strong> But ye, beloved</strong> (see again below, Jud 1:20 ), <strong> remember the words which were before spoken</strong> (not “prophesied:” see reff.) <strong> by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ</strong> (this can hardly be cited as evidence on one side or the other on the question whether St. Jude himself was an Apostle. He <em> might</em> use the expression, being himself an Apostle: be is certainly more likely to have used it, not being one. According to the critical text, St. Peter uses the same expression, without the ἡμῶν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:2">2 Peter 3:2</span> : and whichever view is taken as to the genuineness or otherwise of 2 Peter, there could be no intention by such an expression to exclude either the real or the pretended St. Peter from the number of the Apostles), <strong> that they told you</strong> (whether by writing, or by word of mouth, does not appear: so that we cannot say, with Bengel, “ergo hi, ad quos Judas scribit, cæteros quoque Apostolos audierant.” It is worthy of remark that he does not say ἔλεγον <strong> ἡμῖν</strong> , but <strong> ὑμῖν</strong> ; hereby again not indeed making it certain that he included himself among the Apostles, but making it very uncertain, whether he intends to <em> exclude</em> himself) <strong> that at the last of the time</strong> (see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:3">2 Peter 3:3</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span> ; = at the end of the world, in the last age of the Church) <strong> there shall be scoffers</strong> (men who sport with what is holy and good; the λοιμοί of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:1">Psalms 1:1</span> . The prophecy is contained in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:1">2 Timothy 3:1</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:29">Acts 20:29</span> , and doubtless formed a constant subject of viva voce warning. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:1-2">2 Peter 3:1-2</span> , can hardly be supposed to be referred to, for that place is, as this, a reminiscence of things before said by the Apostles, and nearly in the same words), <strong> walking according to their own lusts of impieties</strong> ( <strong> ἀσεβειῶν</strong> , gen. after ἐπιθυμίας , indicating the direction, or perhaps the character, of those desires. Cf. the same words above, Jud 1:16 ).</p>
