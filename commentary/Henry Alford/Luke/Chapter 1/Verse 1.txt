<b> 1. many]</b> Much depends on the meaning of this word, as guiding, or modifying, our opinion on the relation and sources of our Gospel histories. (1) That<i> the writers of our present Gospels exclusively</i> cannot be meant, is evident; since, even<i> supposing St. Luke to have</i><i> seen all three Gospels</i>, one (that of St. John) was wholly, and another (that of St. Matthew) was in greater the production of an<i> eye-witness and minister of the word</i>, which would leave only one for the<b> many</b>. (2) Apocryphal Gospels<i> exclusively</i> cannot be meant: for they would not be<i> ‘narrations concerning matters fully believed among us,’</i> nor<i> ‘delivered by eye-witnesses and ministers of the word,’</i> a great part of their contents being<i> excluded</i> by this very author from his<i> own</i><b> narration</b>. (3) A combination of these two<i> may</i> be intended—e. g. of the later sort,<i> the Gospel according to the Hebrews,—</i>of the former,<i> that according to St. Mark,</i> but then also how shall we make out the<b> many?</b> Our present apocryphal Gospels arose far later than any likely date which can be assigned to St. Luke’s Gospel see Introduction to Luke. (4) I believe the only probable interpretation of the words to be, that many persons, in charge of Churches, or otherwise induced, drew up, here and there, statements (<i>narratives</i>) of the<i> testimony of eye-witnesses and ministers of the word</i> (see below), so far as they themselves had been able to collect them. (I do<i> not</i> believe that either the Gospel of St. Matthew or that of St. Mark<i> is to be reckoned</i> among these; or if they are, that St. Luke had seen or used them.) That such narratives should not have come down to us, is no matter of surprise: for (1) they would be absorbed by the more complete and sanctioned accounts of our present Evangelists; and (2) Church tradition has preserved very few fragments of authentic information of the apostolic age. It is probable that in almost every Church where an eye-witness preached, his testimony would be taken down, and framed into some narrative, more or less complete, of the life and sayings of the Lord. This does not necessarily imply the insufficiency of such narrations, as some have imagined. The fact of that failure is indeed implied in St. Luke’s description of his own work—but that, more because<i> it possessed completeness</i> (whereas they were fragmentary) than from any difference in kind.<br><br><b> to set forth in order]</b> more Properly,<b> to draw up, to arrange.</b><br><br><b> a declaration] a setting forth:</b> and so if in relation to<i> things past</i>,<b> a narration—history</b>.<br><br><b> surely believed]</b> According to some, this word means<i> fulfilled</i>.
