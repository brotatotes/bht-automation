<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> ἐπειδήπερ</strong> ] This compound, of rare occurrence, is in keeping with the rhetorical style of the preface. See Hartung, Partikellehre, i. p. 342. Valcknaer quotes from Ulpian a similar exordium: ἐπειδήπερ περὶ τούτου πολλοὶ ἐπεχείρησαν ἀπολογήσασθαι .
	</p>
<p><strong> πολλοί</strong> ] Much depends on the meaning of this word, as guiding, or modifying, our opinion on the relation and sources of our Gospel histories. (1) That <em> the writers of our present Gospels exclusively</em> cannot be meant, is evident; since, even <em> supposing Luke to have seen all three Gospels</em> , one (that of John) was wholly, and another (that of Matthew) was in greater part, the production of an <em> eye-witness and minister of the word</em> , which would leave only <em> one</em> for the <strong> πολλοί</strong> <strong> .</strong> (2) Apocryphal Gospels <em> exclusively</em> cannot be meant: for they would not be ‘ <em> narrations concerning matters fully believed among us</em> ,’ nor ‘ <em> delivered by eye-witnesses and ministers of the word</em> ,’ a great part of their contents being <em> excluded</em> by this very author from his <em> own</em> διήγησις . (3) A combination of these two <em> may</em> be intended e.g. of the latter sort, <em> the Gospel according to the Hebrews</em> , of the former, <em> that according to Mark</em> , but then also how shall we make out the <strong> πολλοί</strong> ? Our present apocryphal Gospels arose far later than any likely date which can be assigned to Luke’s Gospel: see Prolegomena to Luke, § iv. (4) I believe the only probable interpretation of the words to be, that many persons, in charge of Churches, or otherwise induced, drew up, here and there, statements ( <em> narratives</em> , διηγ .) of the <em> testimony of eye-witnesses</em> and ὑπηρ . τ . λ . (see below), so far as they themselves had been able to collect them. (I do <em> not</em> believe that either the Gospel of Matt. or that of Mark <em> are to be reckoned</em> among these; or if they are, that Luke had seen or used them.) That such narratives should not have come down to us, is no matter of surprise: for (1) they would be absorbed by the more complete and sanctioned accounts of our present Evangelists; and (2) Church tradition has preserved very few fragments of authentic information of the apostolic age. It is probable that in almost every Church where an eye-witness preached, his testimony would be taken down, and framed into some διήγησις , more or less complete, of the life and sayings of the Lord.

<p><strong> ἐπεχείρησαν</strong> ] <strong> have undertaken;</strong> or, as E. V., <strong> taken in hand.</strong> This does not necessarily imply the <em> insufficiency</em> of such διηγήσεις , as Orig [1] , Ambr [2] , Theophyl., &amp;c. have imagined. Nor is any such failure implied (as Bp. Wordsw.) in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:13">Acts 19:13</span> , where the <em> aorist</em> also is used. The failure then was not in the ὀνομάζειν , but in the issue. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:29">Acts 9:29</span> , the failure is conveyed by the <em> imperfect</em> tense, not necessarily by the verb itself. The fact of that failure is indeed implied in Luke’s description of his own work but that, more because <em> it possessed completeness</em> (whereas they were fragmentary) than from any difference in kind.

<p><strong> ἀνατάξασθαι</strong> ] <strong> to draw up</strong> <strong> to arrange.

<p><strong> διήγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> a setting forth:</strong> and so if in relation to <em> things past</em> , <strong> a narration history.</strong> The word is clearly explained in Plato, Rep. iii. p. 392: ἆρ ʼ οὐ πάντα ὅσα ὑπὸ μυθολόγων ἢ ποιητῶν λέγεται , διήγησις οὖσα τυγχάνει ἢ γεγονότων ἢ ὄντων ἢ μελλόντων ; Τί γάρ , ἔφη , ἄλλο ; Ἆρα οὖν οὐχὶ ἤτοι ἁπλῇ διηγήσει ἢ διὰ μιμήσεως γιγνομένῃ ἢ δι ʼ ἀμφοτέρων περαίνουσιν :
	</p>
<p><strong> πεπληρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> , according to some, ‘ <em> fulfilled</em> .’ De Wette supports this by the meaning of πληρόω <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:25">Acts 12:25</span> , which is beside the purpose. The more likely rendering is that of E. V., <strong> certainly believed.</strong> (Meyer would render it, ‘which have <em> found their completion</em> among <em> us</em> ,’ i.e. ‘us of the apostolic times;’ meaning ‘ <em> Theophilus and himself</em> ,’ &amp;c. This, I think, gives too emphatic a sense to <strong> ἐν ἡμῖν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> which can only mean as ordinarily, ‘ <em> among us</em> ,’ unless accompanied with some qualifying expression. His objection to the ordinary explanation, that the participle ought, according to it, to be subjective to the πράγματα , surely is of no force.) See reff. and note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:5">2 Timothy 4:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:17">2 Timothy 4:17</span> .
	</p>
<p>The use of the cognate noun πληροφορία supports this view: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5">1 Thessalonians 1:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:11">Hebrews 6:11</span> . There does not appear to be any reference to the filling of the sails of a ship, as Bp. Wordsw. The word with its cognates occurs only in a figurative sense, derived from “filling full” without any special reference.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἡμῖν</strong> ] <strong> among us Christians,</strong> i.e. you and me, and all members of the Church of Christ so also the ἡμῖν in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:2">Luke 1:2</span> .</p>
