 11. ] The  altar of incense , Exodus 30:1 , must not be confounded with the  large altar of burnt-offering: that stood  outside the holy place , in the court of the priests. It was during the sacrifice on the great altar that the daily burning of the incense took place: one of the two priests, whose lot it was to offer incense, brought fire from off the altar of burnt-offering to the altar of incense, and then left the other priest there alone, who, on a signal from the priest presiding at the sacrifice, kindled the incense: see Exodus 40:5 ; Exodus 40:26 .
	This is no  vision , but an actual  angelic appearance . The right is the  favourable side: see Matthew 25:33 . “We must understand the right as regarded the officiating priest, who stood with his face to the altar. It would thus be on the N. side of the holy place, where the table of shew-bread stood, whereas on the S. side was the golden candlestick.” Bleek.
