<b> 11.]</b> the<i> altar of incense,</i> Exod. xxx. 1, must not be confounded with the<i> large altar of burnt-offering: that</i> stood<i> outside the holy place,</i> in the court of the priests. It was during the sacrifice on the great altar that the daily burning of the incense took place: one of the two priests, whose lot it was to offer incense, brought fire from off the altar of burnt-offering to the altar of incense, and then left the other priest there alone, who, on a signal from the priest presiding at the sacrifice, kindled the incense: see Exod. xl. 5, 26.
