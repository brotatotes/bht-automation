 17. ]  ἐνώπ  .   αὐτοῦ i.e. κυρίου τοῦ θ . αὐτῶν , manifest in the flesh. De Wette denies this interpretation, as contrary to all analogy: and yet himself explains the expression by saying that what the Messiah does, is in Scripture  ascribed to God as its doer (similarly Meyer). But  why? because Messiah is GOD WITH US. This expression is besides used (see Zec 14:5 ) in places where the undoubted and sole reference is to the Messiah. See Bleek’s note, in which he decides for this view, as against that which refers αὐτοῦ  directly to the Messiah as the Son of God.
	 ἐν πν  .   κ  .   δυν  . ] As a type, a partial fulfilment, of the personal coming of Elias in the latter days (see note on Mat 11:13-14 ). Bleek remarks that it was not in the wonder-working agency of Elias that John was like him, for “John did no miracle,” but in the power of his uttered persuasion.
	 ἐπιστρ  .… ] The first member only of the sentence corresponds with Malachi, and that not verbatim. The angel gives the  exposition of the second member, καὶ καρδίαν ἀνθρώπου πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ , for of course that must be understood in the better sense, of the good prevailing, and the bad becoming like them.
	 ἀπειθής  , as in reff., not  unbelieving , but  disobedient. On the verb ἀπειθεῖν , see note, Hebrews 3:18 , and on ἀπείθεια , note, Ephesians 2:2 .
	 ἐν is elliptic for εἰς τὸ εἶναι ἐν … see reff.
