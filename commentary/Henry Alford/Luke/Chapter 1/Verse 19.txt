<p>The <em> names</em> of the angels, say the Rabbis, came up with Israel from Babylon. We first read of both Michael and Gabriel in the book of Daniel. But we are not therefore to suppose that they were borrowed from any heathen system, as Strauss and the rationalists have done; the fact being, that the persons and order of the angels were known long before, and their <em> names</em> formed matter of subsequent revelation to Daniel: see Professor Mill’s Vindication of Luke , 1, § 4, and note A; also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jos+5:13-15">Joshua 5:13-15</span> .

They are called <em> seven</em> in Tobit (ibid.): see Dr. Mill’s Tract, as above.</p>
