 19. ]  Γαβριήλ = נַּבִרִיאֵל , Man of God: see Daniel 8:16 ; Daniel 9:21 , also Tob 12:15 .
	The  names of the angels, say the Rabbis, came up with Israel from Babylon. We first read of both Michael and Gabriel in the book of Daniel. But we are not therefore to suppose that they were borrowed from any heathen system, as Strauss and the rationalists have done; the fact being, that the persons and order of the angels were known long before, and their  names formed matter of subsequent revelation to Daniel: see Professor Mill’s Vindication of Luke , 1, § 4, and note A; also Joshua 5:13-15 .
	 ὁ παρεστ  .   ἐν  .   τ  .   θ  ., one of the chief angels near the throne of God. They are called  seven in Tobit (ibid.): see Dr. Mill’s Tract, as above.
