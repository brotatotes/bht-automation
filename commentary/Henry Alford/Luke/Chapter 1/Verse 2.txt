<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> καθὼς παρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The Apostles, &amp;c., delivered these matters <em> orally</em> to the Churches in their teaching (see below on <strong> κατηχ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ) and others drew up accounts from that catechetical instruction. It appears from this, that Luke <em> was not aware of any</em> <strong> διήγησις</strong> <em> drawn up by an eye-witness or</em> <strong> ὑπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λ</strong> <strong> .</strong> <em> Their</em> account of these matters was a παράδοσις , <em> from which</em> the διηγήσεις were drawn up. <em> He cannot therefore have seen</em> (or, having seen, not recognized as such, which is highly improbable) <em> the Gospel of Matthew</em> .

<p><strong> ὑπηρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> see reff., <strong> ministering servants</strong> but in connexion with ἀπ ʼ ἀρχῆς . The fanciful idea of “remiges in navi, sc. ecclesia,” cited by Wordsw. from Valckn., is out of the question. ὑπηρέτης had long lost trace of its original derivation, in its more common meaning; and it would be abhorrent from good taste to suppose St. Luke to have used it with so pedantic an allusion.

Bleek, in his posthumous “Erklärung der drei ersten Evv.,” Leipz. 1862, also objects to the personal sense as too precise and definite for the rhetorical generalities of St. Luke in this passage) nor ‘ <em> the matter</em> ,’ so that ὑπ . τ . λ . would signify those who by their labours contributed to bring the matter about, ‘qui ipsi interfuerunt rebus, tanquam pars aliqua’ for this is alien from Luke’s usage of ὑπηρ . see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16">Acts 26:16</span> ; but, <strong> the word</strong> , ‘the <em> word preached:</em> ’ so that ὑπηρέτης τ . λόγ . = διάκονος τ . λόγ . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span> .
