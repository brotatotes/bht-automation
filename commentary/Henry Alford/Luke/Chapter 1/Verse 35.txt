The Holy Ghost</b>—the creative Spirit of God, of whom it is said, Gen. i. 2, that He “<i>moved upon the face of the waters.</i>” But as the world was not created<i> by the Holy Ghost,</i> but<i> by the Son,</i> so also the Lord was not begotten<i> by the Holy Ghost,</i> but<i> by the Father;</i> and that,<i> before the worlds.</i> “No more is here to be attributed to the Spirit, than what is necessary to cause the Virgin to perform the actions of a mother..... As Christ was made of the substance of the Virgin, so He<i><b> was not made of the substance of the Holy Ghost,</b></i><b></b> Whose<i></i> essence<i> cannot at all be made.</i> And because the Holy Ghost did not beget Him by any communication of His essence, therefore He is not the Father of Him, though He were conceived by Him.” (Pearson on the Creed, p. 165, 166.)<br><br><b> shall overshadow thee]</b> The figure is perhaps from a<i> bird</i> (as Grotius: see Ps. xci. 4), or from a<i> cloud:</i> see Mark ix. 7.<br><br><b> holy thing]</b> Some render<i> that which shall be born</i> (of thee)<i> shall be called holy, the Son of God.</i> But it is more simple to take it as A.V.,<b> that holy thing,</b>&c.<b> 36. thy kinswoman]</b> What<i> What</i> relation, nowhere appears in Scripture; and traditions are not worth recounting. But we must take the word in the narrower sense, not in the wider reference of Rom. ix. 3. Elisabeth was<i> of</i><i> the tribe of Levi:</i> but this need not hinder connexion by marriage with other tribes. Aaron himself married into Judah, Exod. vi. 23. We find in Judges xvii. 7 a young man of the family of Judah who was a Levite. Philo says, “Moses ordered the high priest to marry not only a virgin, but one of priestly descent... but the other priests were permitted to marry other than the daughters of priests.”<b> 38.]</b> Her own faithful and humble assent is here given to the divine announcement which been made to her. I believe that her conception of the Lord is to be dated<i> from the utterance of these words.</i> So Euthymius, and similarly Irenæus, Tertullian, Athanasius, Maldonatus, Grotius. Lightfoot, holding a different opinion, says,<i> “I own, that it is the general opinion, that the Virgin conceived at Nazareth, in the instant when the Angel spoke with her.”</i> She was no unconscious vessel of the divine will, but (see ver. 45), in humility and faith, a fellow-worker with the purpose of the Father; and therefore<i> her own unity with that purpose was required,</i> and 1s here recorded.
