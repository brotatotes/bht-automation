 36.   συγγενής ] On the συγγεν  ίς in the var. readd., we may remark, that these fem. terminations of common adjectives belong to later Greek. συγγενίς , ἐσχάτως βάρβαρον , Pollux iii. 50. It is found in Plutarch, Quæst Rom. (vi. 314), &c. See Lobeck on Phrynichus, p. 452†. Cf. μοιχαλίς , Mat 12:39 reff.
	 What relation, no where appears in Scripture: and traditions are not worth recounting. But we must take the word in the narrower sense, not in the wider reference of Romans 9:3 . Elisabeth was  of the tribe of Levi: but this need not hinder connexion by marriage with other tribes. Aaron himself married into Judah, Exodus 6:23 . We find in Judges 17:7 a young man of the family of Judah who was a Levite. Philo de Monarch. ii. 11 (vol. ii. p. 229), says, προσέταξε τῷ μὲν ἀρχιερεῖ μνᾶσθαι μὴ μόνον γυναῖκα παρθένον , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἱέρειαν ἐξ ἱερέων … ἐπετράπη δὲ τοῖς ἄλλοις καὶ μὴ ἱερέων γαμεῖν θυγατέρας .
