 39. ] The situation of Elisabeth was not before this known to Mary; and on the intelligence of it from the angel, she arose and went to congratulate her kinswoman.
	But before this the events related in Mat 1:18-25 had happened.
	Mary being betrothed to Joseph, had no communications with him, except through the  pronubæ ; who, on the first indications of her pregnancy, represented it to him. This would not take longer time than the expression  ἐν ταῖς ἡμ  .   ταύ  . might include possibly three or four weeks. Then happened Matthew 1:19-20 ; and immediately Joseph took her home. As a betrothed virgin she could not travel; but now immediately, and perhaps for the very reason of the circumstances under which Joseph had taken her home, she visits Elisabeth, remaining with her about three months, Luke 1:56 . So that we have, five months, during which Elisabeth hid herself, + the sixth month, during which takes place the Annunciation, the discovery of Mary’s pregnancy, her taking home by Joseph, + three months visit of Mary = nine months, nearly her full time: see Luke 1:57 .
	 πόλιν Ἰούδα may possibly mean “  the city of Juttah ,” which ( Jos 21:16 ) was given, together with Hebron (in the hill country of Judæa: ib. Jos 21:11 ), and other neighbouring cities, to the children of Aaron the priest.
	But it may also mean  ‘a city of Judah;’ and this is perhaps more likely, as no place of residence is mentioned for Zacharias in Luke 1:23 , and one would hardly be introduced so abruptly here. See for Ἰούδα thus used, Matthew 2:6 ; Joshua 21:11 .
	It is  not Jerusalem; for that would hardly have been described as in the hill country; and from Luke 1:23 ; Luke 1:65 , the Evangelist clearly indicates some other place than Jerusalem as the residence of the parents of John.
