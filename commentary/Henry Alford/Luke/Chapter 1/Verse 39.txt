<b> 39.]</b> The situation of Elisabeth was not before this known to Mary; and on the intelligence of it from the angel, she arose and went to congratulate her kinswoman.<br><br> But before this the events related in Matt. i. 18–25 had happened.<br><br> Mary being betrothed to Joseph, had no communications with him, except through the bridesmaids; who, on the first indications of her pregnancy, represented it to him. This would not take longer time than the expression might include—possibly three or four weeks. Then happened Matt. i. 19, 20; and immediately Joseph took her home. As a betrothed virgin she could not travel: but now immediately, and perhaps for the very reason of the circumstances under which Joseph had taken her home, she visits Elisabeth—remaining with her about three months, ver. 56. So that we have, five months, during which Elisabeth hid herself, together with the sixth month, during which takes place the Annunciation, the discovery of Mary’s pregnancy, her taking home by Joseph, together with three months visit of Mary, making up together nine months, nearly her full time: see ver. 57.<br><br> The words rendered<b> a city of Juda</b> may possibly mean<i> “the city of Juttah,”</i> which (Josh. xxi. 16) was given, together with Hebron (in the hill country of Judæa: ib. ver. 11), and other neighbouring cities, to the children of Aaron the priest.<br><br> But it may also mean<b></b><i> ‘a city of Juda;’</i> and this is perhaps more likely, as no place of residence is mentioned for Zacharias in<br><br> ver. 23,—and one would hardly be introduced so abruptly here.<br><br> It is<i> not</i><i> Jerusalem;</i> for that would hardly have been described as in the<i> hill country</i>; and from vv. 23, 65, the Evangelist clearly indicates some other place than Jerusalem as the residence of the parents of John.
