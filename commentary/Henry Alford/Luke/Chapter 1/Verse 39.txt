<p><strong> 39.</strong> ] The situation of Elisabeth was not before this known to Mary; and on the intelligence of it from the angel, she arose and went to congratulate her kinswoman.
	</p>
<p>But before this the events related in Mat 1:18-25 had happened.
	</p>
<p>Mary being betrothed to Joseph, had no communications with him, except through the <em> pronubæ</em> ; who, on the first indications of her pregnancy, represented it to him. This would not take longer time than the expression <strong> ἐν ταῖς ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ταύ</strong> <strong> .</strong> might include possibly three or four weeks. Then happened <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:19-20">Matthew 1:19-20</span> ; and immediately Joseph took her home. As a betrothed virgin she could not travel; but now immediately, and perhaps for the very reason of the circumstances under which Joseph had taken her home, she visits Elisabeth, remaining with her about three months, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:56">Luke 1:56</span> . So that we have, five months, during which Elisabeth hid herself, + the sixth month, during which takes place the Annunciation, the discovery of Mary’s pregnancy, her taking home by Joseph, + three months visit of Mary = nine months, nearly her full time: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:57">Luke 1:57</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> πόλιν Ἰούδα</strong> may possibly mean “ <em> the city of Juttah</em> ,” which ( Jos 21:16 ) was given, together with Hebron (in the hill country of Judæa: ib. Jos 21:11 ), and other neighbouring cities, to the children of Aaron the priest.
	</p>
<p>But it may also mean <em> ‘a city of Judah;’</em> and this is perhaps more likely, as no place of residence is mentioned for Zacharias in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:23">Luke 1:23</span> , and one would hardly be introduced so abruptly here. See for Ἰούδα thus used, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:6">Matthew 2:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jos+21:11">Joshua 21:11</span> .
	</p>
<p>It is <em> not Jerusalem;</em> for that would hardly have been described as in the hill country; and from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:23">Luke 1:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:65">Luke 1:65</span> , the Evangelist clearly indicates some other place than Jerusalem as the residence of the parents of John.</p>
