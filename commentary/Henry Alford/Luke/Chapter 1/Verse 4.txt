Acts 21:21 ; Acts 21:24 , where it simply signifies hearing by report. But we may answer that in Acts 18:25 , where the same construction occurs, this is the most likely sense.
	 λόγων is not to be  rendered ‘things:’  neither it, nor ῥῆμα ,  nor דָּבָר ,  ever has this meaning , as is commonly but erroneously supposed. In all the commonly-cited examples of this, ‘  things expressed in words ’ are meant: here,  the histories,  accounts. (See Prolegg. to the Gospels, i. 3.)
