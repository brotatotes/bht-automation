 42. ]  εὐλογ  . has a double meaning: that of  blessed ,  from above blessed among women, i.e.  beyond other women; and  praised ,  from below i.e. called blessed  by women. The former is the best rendering here: and then  ἐν γ  . will be the Hebrew superlative, as in Jeremiah 29:15 (49:15) and Song of Solomon 1:8 .
