<b> 42.]</b> The word rendered Blessed has a double meaning: that of<i> blessed,—from above</i>—blessed among women, i.e.<i> beyond</i> other women; and<i> praised,—from below</i>—i. e. called blessed<i> by</i> women. The former is the best rendering: and then<b> among women</b> will be the Hebrew superlative, as in Jer. xlix. 15, and Song of Sol. i. 8.
