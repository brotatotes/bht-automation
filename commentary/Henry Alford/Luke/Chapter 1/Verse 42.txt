<p><strong> 42.</strong> ] <strong> εὐλογ</strong> <strong> .</strong> has a double meaning: that of <em> blessed</em> , <em> from above</em> blessed among women, i.e. <em> beyond</em> other women; and <em> praised</em> , <em> from below</em> i.e. called blessed <em> by</em> women. The former is the best rendering here: and then <strong> ἐν γ</strong> <strong> .</strong> will be the Hebrew superlative, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+29:15">Jeremiah 29:15</span> (49:15) and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="so+1:8">Song of Solomon 1:8</span> .</p>
