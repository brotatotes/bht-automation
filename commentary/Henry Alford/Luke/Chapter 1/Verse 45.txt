(so also the Vulgate Erasmus, Beza, Meyer),<b> blessed is she that believed</b>,<b> for</b>&c.—or as in margin of A.V.,<b> blessed is she that believed that there shall be.</b> The last is maintained by Bengel and De Wette, and supported by Acts xxvii. 25. I much prefer the former rendering, as agreeable likewise to the analogy of Scripture,<i></i> where<i> faith, in the recipient</i> of the divine purposes, is so often represented as a<i> co-ordinate cause</i> of the fulfillment of those purposes. Lightfoot well suggests, that there may have been present to the mind of Elisabeth the<i> unbelief</i><i> of her husband</i>, as contrasted with Mary’s faith.
