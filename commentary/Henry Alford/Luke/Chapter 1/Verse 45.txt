 45. ] Either (as E. V., Vulg., Erasm., Beza, Meyer)  blessed is  she that believed, for, &c., or  blessed is she that believed that there shall be, &c. The last is maintained by Bengel and De Wette, and supported by Acts 27:25 . But I own it seems to me very improbable here; the sense and the period would both suffer; and the usage of these first chapters is to  render a reason by ὅτι : see Luke 1:37 ; Luke 1:48-49 ; Luke 1:68 .
	De Wette and Bleek urge against it, that we should thus look for σοί and not αὐτῇ . But surely the preceding ἡ πιστεύσασα , rendering the sentence axiomatic, would prepare the way for the demonstrative pronoun of the third person, on either view of ὅτι . I much prefer the former rendering, as agreeable likewise to the analogy of Scripture, where  faith, in the recipient of the divine purposes, is so often represented as a  co-ordinate cause of the fulfilment of those purposes. Lightf. well suggests, that there may have been present to the mind of Elisabeth the  unbelief of her husband , as contrasted with Mary’s faith.
