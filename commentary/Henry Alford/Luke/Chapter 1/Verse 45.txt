<b> 45.]</b> The words may be rendered either as in A.V. (so also the Vulgate Erasmus, Beza, Meyer),<b> blessed is she that believed</b>,<b> for</b>&c.—or as in margin of A.V.,<b> blessed is she that believed that there shall be.</b> The last is maintained by Bengel and De Wette, and supported by Acts xxvii. 25. I much prefer the former rendering, as agreeable likewise to the analogy of Scripture,<i></i> where<i> faith, in the recipient</i> of the divine purposes, is so often represented as a<i> co-ordinate cause</i> of the fulfillment of those purposes. Lightfoot well suggests, that there may have been present to the mind of Elisabeth the<i> unbelief</i><i> of her husband</i>, as contrasted with Mary’s faith.<br><br> As connected with the defense of the hymns contained in these two chapters, we may observe,<i> taking the very lowest ground</i>, that there is nothing improbable, as matter of fact, in holy persons, full of the thoughts which run through the O.T. prophecies, breaking out into such songs of praise as these, which are grounded on and almost expressed in the words of Scripture. The Christian believer however will take a<i> higher view than this</i>, and attribute to the mother of our Lord that same inspiration of the Holy Spirit which filled Elisabeth (ver. 41) and Zacharias (ver. 67).
