<p><strong> 45.</strong> ] Either (as E. V., Vulg., Erasm., Beza, Meyer) <strong> blessed is</strong> <strong> she that believed, for,</strong> &amp;c., or <strong> blessed is she that believed that there shall be,</strong> &amp;c. The last is maintained by Bengel and De Wette, and supported by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:25">Acts 27:25</span> . But I own it seems to me very improbable here; the sense and the period would both suffer; and the usage of these first chapters is to <em> render a reason</em> by ὅτι : see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:37">Luke 1:37</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:48-49">Luke 1:48-49</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:68">Luke 1:68</span> .

<p>De Wette and Bleek urge against it, that we should thus look for σοί and not αὐτῇ . But surely the preceding ἡ πιστεύσασα , rendering the sentence axiomatic, would prepare the way for the demonstrative pronoun of the third person, on either view of ὅτι . I much prefer the former rendering, as agreeable likewise to the analogy of Scripture, where <em> faith, in the recipient</em> of the divine purposes, is so often represented as a <em> co-ordinate cause</em> of the fulfilment of those purposes. Lightf. well suggests, that there may have been present to the mind of Elisabeth the <em> unbelief of her husband</em> , as contrasted with Mary’s faith.</p>
