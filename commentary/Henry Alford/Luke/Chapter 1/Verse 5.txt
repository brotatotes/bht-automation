By this word we must not understand St. Luke to lay claim to any<i> especial chronological accuracy</i> in<i> writing;</i>—which indeed is not found in his Gospel.

The name was a very common one. The conjectures about him are endless, and entirely without value. It appears by the title given him, that he was a person of dignity, and of course, from ver. 4, he was a convert to Christianity.<br><br> The idea of the name being not a proper, but a<i> feigned one</i>, designating ‘those who loved God’ (found as early as Epiphanius, and adopted again recently), is far-fetched and improbable.<br><br><b> 5. of the course of Abia (Abijah)]</b> This was the<i> eighth</i> of the<i> four-and-twenty courses</i> of the priests (see ref. 1 Chron.). These courses kept their names and order, though not their descent, after the captivity. The courses were of a<i> week's</i> duration each.<br><br><b> Elisabeth]</b> This is the Septuagint rendering, Exod. vi. 23, of Elisheba, the wife of Aaron: signifying,<i> God</i> (is my)<i> oath:</i> i.e. a swearer by,—worshipper of, God. John was thus of priestly descent by both parents.
