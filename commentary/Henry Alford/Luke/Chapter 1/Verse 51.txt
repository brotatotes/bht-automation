<p><strong> 51.</strong> ] The dative <strong> διανοίᾳ</strong> apparently expresses the realm in which the ὑπερηφανία is shewn. Bleek quotes from Symmachus, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+75:6">Psalms 75:6</span> , ὑπερήφανοι τῇ καρδίᾳ : but it is τὴν καρδίαν : the LXX however in the same place has ἀσύνετοι τῇ καρδίᾳ .

<p>Luk 1:55 is not rendered in the E. V. according to the construction; from Psa 97:3 it will be seen that <strong> μνησθῆναι ἐλέους τῷ Ἀβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> are to be joined together, and therefore καθὼς … ἡμῶν will be parenthetical. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mic+7:20">Micah 7:20</span> .</p>
