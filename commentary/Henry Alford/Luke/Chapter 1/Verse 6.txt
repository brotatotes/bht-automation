 6. ]  πορ  .   ἐν  , a Hebraism, as also  προβ  .   ἐν τ  .   ἡμέραις  , Luke 1:7 , and  ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἱερ  .…   ἔ λ  αχεν , Luke 1:8-9 . This last is a construction frequent in Luke. In the phrase  ἐντολαῖς κ  .   δικαιώμασιν (see reff.), we must not press any difference between the terms. δικαίωμα , as Bleek remarks, is used of an ordinance of God, laying down what is δίκαιον for men.
