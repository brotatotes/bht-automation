 78. ]  ἀνατολή is (see reff.) the LXX rendering for צֶמַח a  branch or  sprout and thus, ‘  that which springs up or rises ,’ as  Light: which, from the clauses following, seems to be the meaning here.
	 ἐξ ὕψ  . may be taken with  ἀνατ  ., as in E. V.: or perhaps with the verb  ἐπιφᾶναι  . But however taken, the expression is not quite easy to understand. The word had come apparently to be a name for the Messiah: thus in ref. Zech. ἰδοὺ ἀνήρ , Ἀνατολὴ ὄνομα αὐτῷ : and then figures arising from the meaning of the word itself, became mixed with that which was said of Him. The day-spring does not come ἐξ ὕψους , but from beneath the horizon; but the Messiah  does . Again the ἐπιφᾶναι κ . τ . λ . of the next verse belongs to the day-spring, and only figuratively to the Messiah. See Bleek’s long note.
