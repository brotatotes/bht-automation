<b> 78. dayspring]</b><i> The springing up,</i> or,<i> the East,</i> is in Jer. xxiii. 5, Zech. iii. 9, vi. 12, the LXX rendering for the Hebrew word for a<i> branch</i> or<i> sprout</i>—and thus, ‘<i>that which springs up or rises,</i>’ as<i> Light:</i>—which, from the clauses following, seems to be the meaning here.
