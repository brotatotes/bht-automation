<b> 78. dayspring]</b><i> The springing up,</i> or,<i> the East,</i> is in Jer. xxiii. 5, Zech. iii. 9, vi. 12, the LXX rendering for the Hebrew word for a<i> branch</i> or<i> sprout</i>—and thus, ‘<i>that which springs up or rises,</i>’ as<i> Light:</i>—which, from the clauses following, seems to be the meaning here.<br><br><b> from on high</b> may be taken with<b> dayspring</b>, as in A.V.:—or perhaps with the verb<b> to give light</b>. But however taken, the expression is not quite easy to understand. The word had come apparently to be a name for the Messiah: thus in Zech. iii. 9 (LXX, see above), behold a man, his name is<i> “the springing up,”</i> or<i> “the East”</i> (the A.V. has<i> the branch</i>): and then figures arising from the meaning of the word itself, became mixed with that which was said of Him. The dayspring does not come<i> from on high</i>, but from beneath the horizon; but the Messiah<i> does</i>. Again,<i> to</i><i> give light</i>, &c. of the next verse belongs to the dayspring, and only figuratively to the Messiah.
