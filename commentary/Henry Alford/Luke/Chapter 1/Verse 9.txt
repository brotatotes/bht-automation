There also we are told that the people were outside (in the courts of the men and women):—their prayers were offered<i> while the incense was burnt,</i> as the<i> smoke was symbolical</i> of the ascent of prayer, Rev. viii. 3, 4.<br><br> It appears, from the allot-ment having been just mentioned, to have been the<i> morning</i> incense burning. Theophylact and others understand the whole as describing the entry into the Holy of holies on the great day of Atonement, Levit. xvi. But this is manifestly an error: for it would necessitate Zacharias having been<i> high priest</i>, which he never was; and in this case there would have been no casting of lots.
