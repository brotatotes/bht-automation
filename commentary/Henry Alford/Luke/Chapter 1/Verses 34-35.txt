<p><strong> 34, 35.</strong> ] This question differs from that raised by Zacharias above. It is merely an enquiry after the <em> manner in which</em> so wonderful a thing should take place; not, <em> how shall I know this?</em> it <em> takes for granted that it shall be</em> , and only asks, <em> How?

<p><strong> πνεῦμα ἅγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> the Holy Spirit</strong> the creative Spirit of God, of whom it is said, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:2">Genesis 1:2</span> , that He ἐπεφέρετο ἐπάνω τοῦ ὕδατος . But as the world was not created <em> by the Holy Ghost</em> , but <em> by the Son</em> , so also the Lord was not begotten <em> by the Holy Ghost</em> , but <em> by the Father:</em> and that, <em> before the worlds</em> . “No more is here to be attributed to the Spirit, than what is necessary to cause the Virgin to perform the actions of a mother.… As Christ was made of the substance of the Virgin, so He <em> was not made of the substance of the Holy Ghost</em> , Whose essence <em> cannot at all be made</em> . And because the Holy Ghost did not beget Him by any communication of His essence, therefore He is not the Father of Him, though He were conceived by Him.” (Pearson on the Creed, p. 165, 166.)

<p><strong> ἅγιον</strong> ] Some take this for the predicate of <strong> τὸ γενν</strong> <strong> .,</strong> ‘shall be called holy, the Son of God.’ But it is more simple to take it as E. V., <strong> that holy thing,</strong> &amp;c., making <strong> τὸ γενν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἅγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> the subject, and <strong> υἱ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> the predicate. On the latter expression, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:3">Matthew 4:3</span> .</p>
