	As connected with the defence of the hymns contained in these two chapters, we may observe,  taking the very lowest ground , that there is nothing improbable, as matter of fact, in holy persons, full of the thoughts which permeate the O.T. prophecies, breaking out into such songs of praise as these, which are grounded on and almost expressed in the words of Scripture (see Dr. Mill, Historical character of Luke 1:0 vindicated, p. 40 ff.). The Christian believer however will take a  higher view than this , and attribute to the mother of our Lord, that same inspiration of the Holy Spirit which filled Elisabeth ( Luk 1:41 ) and Zacharias ( Luk 1:67 ).
