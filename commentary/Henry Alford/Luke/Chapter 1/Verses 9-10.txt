 9, 10.   τοῦ θυμιᾶσαι (not θυμιάσαι )] This was the  most honourable office which was allotted among the priests each day, and the same person could not serve it more than once. On the manner of casting the lots, see Lightfoot in loc.
	 τοῦ θ  .   εἰσελθών =  to go in and to burn incense. The gen.  τοῦ is in government after the verb ἔλαχεν : see Winer, § 44. 4.  a . This verb commonly governs an accusative, but now and then a genitive: see Kühner, § 521: and cf. Il. ω . 76.
	 τὸν ναόν  ] the holy place: see Hebrews 9:1-6 , and Exodus 30:7 .
	An account of John Hyrcanus the high-priest having a vision at the time of offering incense occurs Jos. Antt. xiii. 10. 3: φασὶ γὰρ ὅτι κατ ʼ ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν καθ ʼ ἣν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ τῷ Κυζικηνῷ συνέβαλον , αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ ναῷ θυμιῶν μόνος , ὢν ὁ ἀρχιερεύς , ἀκούσειε φωνῆς ὡς οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ νενικήκασιν ἀρτίως τὸν Ἀντίοχον . καὶ τοῦτο προελθὼν ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ παντὶ τῷ πλήθει φανερὸν ἐποίησε · καὶ συνέβη οὕτως γενέσθαι . Here also we have the people outside (in the courts of the men and women): their prayers were offered  while the incense was burnt , as the  smoke was symbolical of the ascent of prayer, Revelation 8:3-4 .
	It appears, from the allotment having been just mentioned, to have been the  morning incense burning. So Meyer. Theophylact and others understand the whole as describing the entry into the Holy of holies on the great day of Atonement, Leviticus 16:0 . But this is manifestly an error: for it would necessitate Zacharias having been high-priest, which he never was; and in this case there would have been no casting of lots.
