<p><strong> ἀνέδ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> an official word: see reff. Bleek has observed, that ὁ κύριος , of our Lord, in narration, is peculiar to St. Luke, and to narrations which he alone gives. Cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:13">Luke 7:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:39">Luke 11:39</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:15">Luke 13:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:5-6">Luke 17:5-6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:6">Luke 18:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:31">Luke 22:31</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61">Luke 22:61</span> . But this is only true of the Synoptic Gospels. It occurs in the fragment at the end of St. Mark ( Mar 16:19 ), and in John ( Joh 4:1 reff.). In the Acts, the usage is very general: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:47">Luke 2:47</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:9">Luke 5:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:14">Luke 5:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1">Luke 9:1</span> , &amp;c. and in St. Paul’s Epistles: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:14">1 Corinthians 6:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:17">1 Corinthians 6:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:10">1 Corinthians 7:10</span> , &amp;c.

<p>[ <strong> καὶ</strong> ] <strong> ἑτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἑβδ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not ‘ <em> other seventy also</em> ,’ <strong> but others</strong> [ <strong> also</strong> ], <strong> seventy in number.</strong> The <strong> ἑτέρους</strong> may refer, either to the Twelve, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:1">Luke 9:1</span> , or perhaps, from the similarity of their mission, to the ἄγγελοι in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:52">Luke 9:52</span> . But perhaps the first is more probable, from the similarity of the discourses.
	</p>
<p>The number of seventy might perhaps have reference to the <em> seventy elders</em> of Israel, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:1">Exodus 24:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:16">Numbers 11:16</span> : all sorts of fanciful analogies have been found out and insisted on (and moreover forced into the text), which are not worth recounting.
