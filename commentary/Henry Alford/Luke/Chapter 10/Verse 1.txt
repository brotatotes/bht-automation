 1. ]  μετὰ ταῦτα chronological  after these things, not ‘  besides these things ,’ as Schleiermacher and Olsh. render it.
	 ἀνέδ  ., an official word: see reff. Bleek has observed, that ὁ κύριος , of our Lord, in narration, is peculiar to St. Luke, and to narrations which he alone gives. Cf. ch. Luke 7:13 ; Luke 11:39 ; Luke 12:42 ; Luke 13:15 ; Luke 17:5-6 ; Luke 18:6 ; Luke 22:31 ; Luke 22:61 . But this is only true of the Synoptic Gospels. It occurs in the fragment at the end of St. Mark ( Mar 16:19 ), and in John ( Joh 4:1 reff.). In the Acts, the usage is very general: see Luke 2:47 ; Luke 5:9 ; Luke 5:14 ; Luke 9:1 , &c. and in St. Paul’s Epistles: see 1 Corinthians 6:14 ; 1 Corinthians 6:17 ; 1 Corinthians 7:10 , &c.
	[  καὶ ]  ἑτ  .   ἑβδ  ., not ‘  other seventy also ,’  but others [  also ],  seventy in number. The  ἑτέρους may refer, either to the Twelve, ch. Luke 9:1 , or perhaps, from the similarity of their mission, to the ἄγγελοι in ch. Luke 9:52 . But perhaps the first is more probable, from the similarity of the discourses.
	The number of seventy might perhaps have reference to the  seventy elders of Israel, Exodus 24:1 ; Numbers 11:16 : all sorts of fanciful analogies have been found out and insisted on (and moreover forced into the text), which are not worth recounting.
