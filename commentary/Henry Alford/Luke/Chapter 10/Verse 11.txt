<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <strong> ἀπομασσόμεθα ὑμῖν</strong> can hardly be with Wordsw., “ <em> we wipe off from ourselves on you:</em> ” the dat. pron. holds too slight and unemphatic a place for this, and is merely a dativus incommodi: ‘ <em> against you</em> ,’ as E. V. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:51">Acts 13:51</span> , where <strong> ἐπ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> αὐτούς</strong> represents the same, and is similarly rendered in E. V.</p>
