<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] In these words, which our Lord had uttered before (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:21">Matthew 11:21</span> ff.), He takes His solemn farewell of the cities where the greatest number of His miracles had been done, and discourses uttered: they being awful examples of the <strong> ἡ πόλις ἐκείνη</strong> just described. It is wonderful how De Wette can write of these four verses <em> falsche Reminiscenz</em> , s. z. Mat 11:20 and this when he believes Luke to have had Matt. before him.</p>
