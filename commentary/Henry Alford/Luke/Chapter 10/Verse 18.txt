 18. ] This verse has been generally misunderstood, and its force lost, by imagining it to refer to some triumph  just gained , which our Lord announces as the reason for their newly manifested power. The truth is, that in this brief speech He sums up  proleptically , as so often in the discourses in John, the whole great conflict with and defeat of the Power of evil, from the first even till accomplished by His own victory. The  ἐθεώρ  .   τ  .   σ  . refers to the original fall of Satan, when he lost his place as an angel of light, not keeping his first estate; which fall however had been proceeding ever since step by step, and shall do so, till all things be put under the feet of Jesus who was made lower than the angels. And this  ἐθεώρουν belongs to the period before the foundation of the world when He abode in the bosom of the Father. He is to be (see Luk 10:22 ) the Great Victor over the Adversary, and this victory began when Satan fell from heaven. (I would not altogether erase the foregoing interpretation: but surely it is grammatically more correct, with Bleek, to refer the imperfect to the time just past, to the Lord’s prophetic sight at the time of the ministering of the Seventy. Cf. Act 18:5 for a similar imperfect. If this view be correct, the words do not refer to any “  triumph just gained ,” but to the Lord’s glorious anticipations of final triumph, felt during the exercise of power by His servants.)
	 ὡς ἀστ  . ] Not the suddenness only of the fall, but the brightness of the fallen Angel is thus set forth. The description is not figurative, but literal; i.e. as far as divine words can be said to be literal, being accommodated to our sensuous conceptions. See on this verse, Isaiah 14:9-15 , to which the words have a reference; and Revelation 12:7-12 .
