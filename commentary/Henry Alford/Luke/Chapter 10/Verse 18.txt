<b> 18.</b>] We may understand these words in two ways: (1) we may say, that in this brief speech our Lord sums up<i> by anticipation</i>, as so often in the discourses in John, the whole great conflict with and defeat of the power of evil, from the first, even till accomplished by His own victory. The words,<b> I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven</b>, refer to the original fall of Satan, when he lost his place as an angel of light, not keeping his first estate; which fall however had been proceeding ever since step by step, and shall do so, till all things be put under the feet of Jesus, who was made lower than the angels. And this<b> I beheld</b> belongs to the period before the foundation of the world when He abode in the bosom of the Father. He is to be (see ver. 22) the great Victor over the Adversary, and this victory when Satan fell from heaven. At the same time it may be doubted whether it is not (2) grammatically more correct, to refer the imperfect tense,<b> I beheld, was beholding</b>, to the time just past,—to the Lord’s prophetic sight at the time of the ministering of the Seventy. If this view be correct, the words do not refer to any “<i>triumph just gained,</i>” but to the Lord’s glorious anticipations of final triumph, felt during the exercise of power by His servants.<br><br><b> as lightning</b>] Not the suddenness only of the fall, but the brightness of the fallen Angel is thus set forth. The description is not figurative, but literal; i. e, as far as divine words can be said to be literal, being accommodated to our sensuous conceptions. See on this verse, Isa. xiv. 9–15, to which the words have a reference; and Rev. xii. 7–12.
