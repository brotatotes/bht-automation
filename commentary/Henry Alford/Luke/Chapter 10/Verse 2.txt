<p>If <strong> ἐκβάλλῃ</strong> were read, the <em> pres.</em> , as usual, would have the force of the continually repeated act: as it is, the <em> aor.</em> (as in [84] Matt.) indicates the <em> whole mission</em> , considered as one great act.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [84] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
