 20. ] The connexion is ‘seeing that the power which I grant to you is so large, arising from my victory over the enemy, make not one particular department of it your cause of joy, nor indeed the  mere subjection of evil to you at all but this, the positive and infinite side of God’s mercy and goodness to you, that He hath  placed you among His redeemed ones .’
	 τὰ πνεύμ  . is something different from  τὰ δαιμόνια in those words above, and denotes a wider range of influence influence over  spirit for good whereby the πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας are subjected to the believers in Christ.
	The  ἐγγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς is an expression in various forms frequent in Scripture, and is opposed to ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς γραφήτωσαν , Jeremiah 17:13 , said of the rebellious. But no immutable predestination is asserted by it; in the very first place where it occurs, Exodus 32:32-33 , the contrary is implied, see Psalms 69:28 ; Isaiah 4:3 ; Daniel 12:1 ; Philippians 4:3 ; Hebrews 12:23 ; Revelation 3:5 ; Revelation 13:8 ; Revelation 20:12 ; Revelation 20:15 . The  τὰ ὀνόμ  .   ὑμ  . seems to be a reference to  ἐν τῷ ὀν  .   σου above, which perhaps was with them a  medium of self-praise , as so often with Christians. Our Lord says, ‘the true cause of joy for you is, not the power shewn forth by or in you  in My Name , but that you,  your names , are in the book of life’ as testified by the πνεῦμα which συμμαρτυρεῖ τῷ πν . ἡμῶν ὅτι ἐσμὲν τέκνα θεοῦ , Romans 8:16 . And this brings us to Luke 10:21 , where our Lord rejoices in the revelation of these things even to the babes of the earth by the will and pleasure of the Father:  these things not, the power over the enemy but all that is implied in  ἐγγέγραπται ἐν τ  .   οὐρ  .
	This, which is the true cause of joy to the believer, causes even the Saviour Himself to triumph, anticipating Isaiah 53:11 .
