<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] The connexion is ‘seeing that the power which I grant to you is so large, arising from my victory over the enemy, make not one particular department of it your cause of joy, nor indeed the <em> mere subjection of evil to you at all</em> but this, the positive and infinite side of God’s mercy and goodness to you, that He hath <em> placed you among His redeemed ones</em> .’
	</p>
<p><strong> τὰ πνεύμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is something different from <strong> τὰ δαιμόνια</strong> in those words above, and denotes a wider range of influence influence over <em> spirit</em> for good whereby the πνευματικὰ τῆς πονηρίας are subjected to the believers in Christ.

<p>The <strong> ἐγγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</strong> is an expression in various forms frequent in Scripture, and is opposed to ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς γραφήτωσαν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:13">Jeremiah 17:13</span> , said of the rebellious. But no immutable predestination is asserted by it; in the very first place where it occurs, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:32-33">Exodus 32:32-33</span> , the contrary is implied, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:28">Psalms 69:28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:3">Isaiah 4:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+4:3">Philippians 4:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+3:5">Revelation 3:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12">Revelation 20:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:15">Revelation 20:15</span> . The <strong> τὰ ὀνόμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> seems to be a reference to <strong> ἐν τῷ ὀν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σου</strong> above, which perhaps was with them a <em> medium of self-praise</em> , as so often with Christians. Our Lord says, ‘the true cause of joy for you is, not the power shewn forth by or in you <em> in My Name</em> , but that you, <em> your names</em> , are in the book of life’ as testified by the πνεῦμα which συμμαρτυρεῖ τῷ πν . ἡμῶν ὅτι ἐσμὲν τέκνα θεοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span> . And this brings us to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span> , where our Lord rejoices in the revelation of these things even to the babes of the earth by the will and pleasure of the Father: <em> these things</em> not, the power over the enemy but all that is implied in <strong> ἐγγέγραπται ἐν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οὐρ</strong> <strong> .

<p>This, which is the true cause of joy to the believer, causes even the Saviour Himself to triumph, anticipating <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11">Isaiah 53:11</span> .</p>
