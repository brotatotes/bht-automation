<b> 20.</b>] The connexion is— ‘seeing that the power Which I grant to you is so large, arising from my victory over the enemy,—make not one particular department of it your cause of joy, nor indeed the<i> mere subjection of evil to you at all</i>—but this,—the positive and infinite side of God’s mercy and goodness to you, that He hath<i> placed you among His redeemed ones.</i>’<br><br><b> the spirits</b> is something different from<b> the devils</b> (<b>dæmons</b>) in those words above, and denotes a wider range of influence—influence over<i> spirit</i> for good—whereby the “<i>spiritual things of wickedness</i>” (so literally in Eph. vi. 12) are subjected to the believers in Christ.<br><br><b> written in heaven</b> is an expression in various forms frequent in Scripture, and is opposed to “<i>written in earth,</i>” Jer. xvii. 13, said of the rebellious.
