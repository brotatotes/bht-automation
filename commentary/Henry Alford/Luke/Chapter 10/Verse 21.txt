<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] The words <strong> τῷ ἁγίῳ</strong> cannot well be excluded from the text; the expression as thus standing, forms an ἅπαξ λεγ ., but is agreeable to the analogy of Scripture: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span> ; Heb 9:14 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span> ; see also Rom 14:17 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:6">1 Thessalonians 1:6</span> . The ascription of praise, and the verses following, are here <em> in the very closest connexion</em> , and it is perfectly unimaginable that they should have been inserted in this place arbitrarily. The same has been said of their occurrence in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span> ; and, from no love of harmonizing or escaping difficulties, but from a deep feeling of the inner spirit of both discourses, I am convinced that our Lord did utter, <em> on the two separate occasions</em> , these weighty words; and I find in them a most instructive instance of the way in which such central sayings were repeated by Him. It was not a <em> rejoicing</em> before (in Matt.), but a <em> confession:</em> compare the whole discourse and notes.

<p>That the introductory words <strong> ἐν αὐτῇ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὥρᾳ</strong> , = ἐν ἐκ . τῷ καιρῷ , may have been introduced from one passage into the other, and perhaps by some one who imagined them the same, I would willingly grant, if needful; not that, in the presence of such truths, such a trifle is worth mention, but that the shallow school of modern critics <em> do mention</em> , and <em> rest upon</em> such. On <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21-22">Luke 10:21-22</span> , see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25-27">Matthew 11:25-27</span> , observing here the gradual narrowing of the circle to which our Lord addresses himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:22">Luke 10:22</span> , <strong> στραφ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> μ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> then Luk 10:23 the same, with κατ ʼ ἰδίαν added.</p>
