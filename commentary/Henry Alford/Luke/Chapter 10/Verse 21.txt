<b> 21.</b>] The words<b> the holy</b>, before<b> spirit</b>, cannot well be excluded from the text; the expression as thus standing, is alone in the New Testament, but is agreeable to the analogy of Scripture: compare Rom. i. 4: Heb. ix. 14: 1 Pet. iii. 18: see also Rom. xiv. 17: 1 Thess. i. 6.<br><br> The ascription of praise, and the verses following, ure here<i> in the very closest connexion</i>, and it is perfectly unimaginable that they should have been inserted in this place arbitrarily. The same has been said of their occurrence in Matt. xi. 25; and, from no love of harmonizing or escaping difficulties, but from a deep feeling of the inner spirit of both discourses, I am convinced that our Lord did utter,<i> on the two separate occasions</i>, these weighty words; and I find in them a most instructive instance of the way in which such central sayings were repeated by Him. It was not a<i> rejoicing</i> before (in Matthew), but<i> only</i> a<i> confession</i>: compare the whole discourse and notes. That the introductory words<b> in that hour</b>, or “<i>at that time,</i>” may have been introduced from one passage into the other, and perhaps by some one who imagined them the same, I would willingly grant, if needful; not that, in the presence of such truths, such a trifle is worth mention, but that the shallow school of modern critics<i> do mention</i>, and<i> rest upon</i> such. On vv. 21, 22, see notes on Matt. xi. 25–27, observing here the gradual narrowing of the circle to which our Lord addresses himself, ver. 22 (margin),—then ver. 23 the same, with<b> privately</b> added.
