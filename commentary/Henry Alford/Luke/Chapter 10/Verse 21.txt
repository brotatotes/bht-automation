 21. ] The words  τῷ ἁγίῳ cannot well be excluded from the text; the expression as thus standing, forms an ἅπαξ λεγ ., but is agreeable to the analogy of Scripture: cf. Romans 1:4 ; Heb 9:14 ; 1 Peter 3:18 ; see also Rom 14:17 ; 1 Thessalonians 1:6 . The ascription of praise, and the verses following, are here  in the very closest connexion , and it is perfectly unimaginable that they should have been inserted in this place arbitrarily. The same has been said of their occurrence in Matthew 11:25 ; and, from no love of harmonizing or escaping difficulties, but from a deep feeling of the inner spirit of both discourses, I am convinced that our Lord did utter,  on the two separate occasions , these weighty words; and I find in them a most instructive instance of the way in which such central sayings were repeated by Him. It was not a  rejoicing before (in Matt.), but a  confession: compare the whole discourse and notes.
	That the introductory words  ἐν αὐτῇ τ  .   ὥρᾳ , = ἐν ἐκ . τῷ καιρῷ , may have been introduced from one passage into the other, and perhaps by some one who imagined them the same, I would willingly grant, if needful; not that, in the presence of such truths, such a trifle is worth mention, but that the shallow school of modern critics  do mention , and  rest upon such. On Luke 10:21-22 , see notes on Matthew 11:25-27 , observing here the gradual narrowing of the circle to which our Lord addresses himself, Luke 10:22 ,  στραφ  .   πρ  .   τ  .   μ  ., then Luk 10:23 the same, with κατ ʼ ἰδίαν added.
