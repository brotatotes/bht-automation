<b> 23.</b>] This verse should not be marked off from ver. 22 by a new paragraph, as is done in the A.V.: much less, as in the Gospel for the 13th Sunday after Trinity, joined with what follows: except perhaps that the lesson taught us by its occurring there is an appropriate one, as shewing us how the<i> grace of Christian love</i>, which is the subject of the following parable, fulfils and abounds over, legal obedience. It is in connexion with the preceding, and comes as the conclusion after the thanksgiving in ver. 21. A similar saying of our Lord occurs Matt. xiii. 16, 17, but uttered altogether on a different occasion and in a different connexion.
