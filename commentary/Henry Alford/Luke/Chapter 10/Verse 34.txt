<b>oil and wine</b>] These were usual remedies for wounds in the East; Galen, cited by Wetstein, prescribes thus for a wound in the head. “<i>Rub down the tenderest leaves of the olive,—pour in oil and red wine, and make a plaster:</i>”—see also Isa. i. 6.<br><br><b> on his own beast</b>, thereby denying himself the use of it.<br><br> This is the only place where<i> an inn</i>, as we understand the word,<i> a house for reception of travellers kept by a host</i>, as distinguished from an empty caravan-serai, is mentioned. The Rabbinical writers frequently speak of such, but under a name adopted from this Greek word. Bleek remarks that this serves to shew, that there<i> were</i> such inns in, that neighbourhood, though certainly they were not frequent.
