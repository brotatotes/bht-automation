<b> 36.</b>] It will be observed that our Lord not only elicits the answer from the questioner himself, but that it comes<i> in an inverted form</i>. The lawyer had asked,<i> to whom</i> he was to understand himself obliged to fulfil the duties of neighbourship? but the answer has for its subject<i> one who fulfilled them to another</i>. The reason of this is to be found,—partly in the relation of neighbourship being<i> mutual</i>, so that if this man is my neighbour, I am his also;—but chiefly in the intention of our Lord to bring out a strong contrast, by putting the hated and despised Samaritan in the<i> active</i> place, and thus to reflect back the<b> likewise</b> more pointedly. “Observe, that the<b> was</b><i> neighbour</i>, is literally<b> became</b> neighbour. The neighbour Jews became strangers, the stranger Samaritan became neighbour, to the wounded traveller. It is not place, but love, which makes neighbonrhood.” Wordsworth.
