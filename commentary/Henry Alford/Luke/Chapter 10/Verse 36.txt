 36. ] It will be observed that our Lord not only elicits the answer from the questioner himself, but that it comes  in an inverted form . The lawyer had asked,  to whom he was to understand himself obliged to fulfil the duties of neighbourship? but the answer has for its subject  one who fulfilled them to another . The reason of this is to be found, partly in the relation of neighbourship being  mutual , so that if this man is my neighbour, I am his also; but chiefly in the intention of our Lord to bring out a strong contrast by putting the hated and despised Samaritan in the  active place, and thus to reflect back the  ὁμοίως more pointedly. “Observe γεγονέναι , to have  become neighbour. The neighbour Jews became strangers, the stranger Samaritan became neighbour, to the wounded traveller. It is not place, but love, which makes neighbourhood.” Wordsworth.
