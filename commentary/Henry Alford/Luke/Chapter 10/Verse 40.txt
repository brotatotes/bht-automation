 40. ]  περιεσπ  . (as also the form  παρακαθεσθεῖσα above) is a word of later Greek. We have in Dion. Hal. ix. 43, περισπᾷ περὶ τὰς ἔξω στρατείας τὸν δῆμον : and in Jos. Antt. ver. 1. 4, πρὸς τοσαύτας ὑπηρεσίας διασπώμενος . See also Diod. Sic. i. 74: Polyb. xv. 3. 4. It exactly answers to the Latin ‘torqueor’ used in the same connexion by Horace, Sat. ii. 8. 67, and to a midland provincial expression ‘  to be put about ,’ meaning to be ‘distracted with officious care.’ See Phryn. ed. Lobeck, p. 415, who gives ἄσχολος εἶναι for the corresponding classical expression.
	 ἐπιστ  ., generally, but not always, used by Luke of a  sudden coming into presence . It looks here as if our Lord were teaching in another apartment from that where the διακονία was going on: this appears also in the  κατέλειπεν  .
