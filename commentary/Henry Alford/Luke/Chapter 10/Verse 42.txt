one thing</b>] Perhaps we should not express the two words more definitely, for fear of narrowing the wide sense in which are spoken. I can hardly doubt that our Lord, in the<i> first and most obvious</i> meaning indicated that simpler preparation would have been all that was needful, but the<b> many</b> leads to the<b> one</b>, and that to the<b> good part</b>, the “<i>one</i>” being the middle term of comparison between the<i> natural</i> “<i>many</i>” and the<i> spiritual</i> “<i>good part.</i>” So that the whole will imply—only<i> within</i> the circle of Christ’s disciples, those who act from love (mistaken or otherwise) to Him—much as John vi. 27,—and will set before us the bread which perisheth on one hand, and that which endureth to everlasting life on the other. The<b> good portion</b> is the<i> one thing</i> which is needful—see John vi. 53,—the<i> feeding on the bread of life by faith</i>; which faith cometh by hearing, hearing by the<i> word of Christ</i>, which Mary was now receiving into her soul, and which (John vi. 54) shall never be taken away, but result in ever-lasting life.<br><br> The two types of character have ever been found in the Church; both, caring for Him, and for love to Him doing what they do: but the one busy and restless, anxious, and stirring; the other quiet and humble, content to sit at His feet and learn. We see here which of the two He praises. But on the other hand we must not derive any argument hence against an active Christian life of doing good:<i> this is</i>, in fact, to sit at His feet and learn—to take His yoke on us, and learn of Him. It is the bustling about the<i> many things</i> of which there is no need, which is blamed; not the working out the fruits of the Spirit, which are needful, being parts themselves of the<i> good part</i>.
