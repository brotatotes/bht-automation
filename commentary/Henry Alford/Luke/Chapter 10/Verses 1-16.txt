 1 16. ] MISSION OF THE SEVENTY. It is well that Luke has given us also the sending of  the Twelve; or we should have had some of the Commentators asserting that this was  the same mission. The discourse addressed to the Seventy is in substance the same as that to the Twelve, as the similarity of their errand would lead us to suppose it would be. But there is, as Stier has well remarked (iii. 89, edn. 2), this weighty difference. The discourse in Matthew 10:0 in its three great divisions (see notes there), speaks plainly of an office founded, and a ministry appointed, which was to involve a work, and embrace consequences,  co-extensive , both in space and duration,  with the world . Here, we have  no such prospective view unfolded. The whole discourse is confined to the  first division there ( Luk 10:1-15 ), and relates entirely to  present duties .
	Their sending out was not to prove and strengthen their own faith, as Hase supposes (Leben J. p. 194), but to prepare the way for this solemn journey of the Lord, the object of which was the announcement of the near approach of the kingdom of God, and the termination of it, the last events at Jerusalem. Their mission being thus temporary, and expiring with their return, it is not to be wondered at that we  hear nothing of them in the Acts . This last is surely an absurd objection to bring against the historic truth of their mission, seeing that the Acts are written  by this same Evangelist , and the omission is therefore an argument  for , and not against, that truth.
