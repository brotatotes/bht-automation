 17 24. ] RETURN OF THE SEVENTY. As in ch. Luke 9:6-10 , Luke attaches the return of the Seventy very closely to their mission. They probably were not many days absent. They say nothing of the reception of their message, or it is not brought out in the Gospel, as not immediately belonging to the great central object of narration; they rejoice that more power seems to be granted to them than even His words promised, seeing that He commissioned them only to heal the sick, not to cast out devils, as He did the Apostles, ch. Luke 9:1 . That this was a ground of joy not to be  prominently brought forward , is the purport of our Lordâ€™s answer; the whole of which as far as Luk 10:24 incl. is in the strictest connexion, and full of most weighty and deep truth.
