 38 42. ] ENTERTAINMENT OF OUR LORD AT THE HOUSE OF MARTHA AND MARY. It surely never could be doubted who this Martha and Mary were, nor where this took place, but that the harmonizing spirit has so beclouded the sight of our critics. Bengel believes them  not to be the sisters of Lazarus , but another Martha and Mary somewhere else; and this in spite of the deep psychological identity of characters which meets us in Joh 11:12
	Greswell, still more strangely, believes the  persons to be the same , but that they had  another residence in Galilee, and endeavours to establish this from John 11:1 (where he says ἀπό only indicates residence, ἐκ origin; and the κώμη is not Bethany, but the village in Galilee: see notes there). I shall, as elsewhere, take the text in its most obvious and simple interpretation, and where nothing definite is inserted  in it , throw light on it from what we know from other sources. And I believe most readers will agree with me in taking these for the sisters of Lazarus, and the village for Bethany. “As regards the name  Martha , it is in Aramæan מרתא , from מר  dominus , and answers to the Greek κυρία .” Bleek.
