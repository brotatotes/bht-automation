 41, 42. ] The repetition of her name indicates reproof.
	 μεριμνᾷς expresses the inner anxiety (from μερίζω ),  θορυβάζῃ the outer bustle and confusion. The latter word is not elsewhere found in Greek.
	 πολλά  , many things.
	 ἑνός  , of one  thing; perhaps we should not express the two words more definitely, for fear of narrowing the wide sense in which they are spoken. I can hardly doubt that our Lord, in the  first and  most obvious meaning, indicated that simpler preparation would have been all that was needful, but the  πολλά leads to the  ἕν  , and that to the  ἀγαθὴ μερίς  , the ἕν being the middle term of comparison between the  natural πολλά and the  spiritual ἀγαθὴ μερίς . So that the whole will imply only  within the circle of Christ’s disciples, those who act from love (mistaken or otherwise) to Him much as John 6:27 , and will set before us the bread which perisheth on one hand, and that which endureth to everlasting life on the other. The  ἀγαθὴ μερίς  , the good portion, is the ἕν which is needful see John 6:53 , the  feeding on the bread of life by faith; which faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the ῥῆμα χριστοῦ , which Mary was now receiving into her soul, and which ( Joh 6:54 ) shall never be taken away, but result in everlasting life.
	The two types of character have ever been found in the Church; both, caring for Him, and for love to Him doing what they do: but the one busy and restless, anxious and stirring; the other quiet and humble, content to sit at His feet and learn. We see here which of the two He praises. But on the other hand we must not derive any argument hence against an active Christian life of doing good:  this is , in fact, to sit at His feet and learn to take His yoke on us, and learn of Him. It is the bustling about the πολλά of which there is no need, which is blamed: not the working out the fruits of the Spirit, which are needful, being parts themselves of the ἀγαθὴ μερίς .
