Our Lord sets forth the certainty of our obtaining the Holy Spirit, (<i>the unspeakable gift</i>, in which all other<i> good gifts</i> are included,) from our Father, by another ‘à fortiori’ argument, drawn from the love of earthly parents, so far less careful and tenderly wise than He is over His children.<br><br> For the rest, see notes on Matt. vii. 7 ff. The<i> egg</i> and<i> scorpion</i> are added here. The<i> serpent</i> and<i> scorpion</i> are the<i> positively mischievous</i>: the samples, ch. x. 19, of the “<i>power of the enemy:</i>”—the<i> stone</i>, that which is simply<i> unfit for food</i>. So that God’s answers to our prayers consist of neither useless nor mischievous things, but of His best gift—His Holy Spirit—in all the various and fitting manifestations of His guidance, and consolation, and teaching, in our lives. This is (because this takes of and imparts to us by leading us continually to Him who is) the “bread” of the parable;—the “<i>father of the family</i>”<b> is the Father from Heaven</b>, with whom however the night is as the day, who never slumbers nor sleeps. It has been noticed how by the hungry traveller coming to the man, may be imported, in the depth of the parable, the awakening in a man’s own soul (which is so precious to him) of that hunger which he has nothing to satisfy, and which none but God can satisfy. The reader may, as in the foregoing parable, follow out this clue for himself (provided it be done soberly) with much interest and profit.<br><br> Notice that when<i> we address</i> God (Matt. vi. 9), He is “<i>Our Father</i> (which is) in<i> heaven</i>”—when<i> He answers us,</i> He is<i> the Father</i> from<i> heaven</i>. In the former case, we go up into Him and His abode; in the latter He comes down to us.
