 17.   εἰδώς ] So Matt. also, Luke 11:25 .
	 οἶκ  .   ἐπὶ οἶκ  . ] The ordinary rendering  and house (  divided )  against house, falleth, is certainly right. Before Meyer charged this interpretation with having entirely arisen out of harmonistic considerations, he should have ascertained whether such an expression as a  kingdom falling οἶκος ἐπὶ οἶκον is even tolerable. The ruling idea of the saying having been given by the  βασ  .   ἐφ  ʼ   ἑαυτήν  , the emphatic pronoun need not be expressed again. Similarly we have, 1 Corinthians 2:11 , τίς οἶδεν ἀνθρώπων τὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου , εἰ μὴ τὸ πν . τοῦ ἀνθρώτου τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ ; the ὁ ἄνθρ . being the same throughout.
