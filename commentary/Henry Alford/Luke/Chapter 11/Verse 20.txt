 20. ]  ἐν δακτύλῳ θ  . = ἐν πνεύματι θ . Matt. No distinction can be established, as Gresw. attempts. The one expression explains the other. What was done (Hebraistically speaking) by the  finger of God, was done by the Spirit of God. We have much greater variations than this in sayings demonstrably the same. And as to what the same author maintains about the relative magnitude of the works of the  finger, hand , and  arm of God, a reference to ref. Ps., where the  heavens are ‘the works of Thy  fingers ,’ will sufficiently shew how little reliance is to be placed on such subtleties.
