<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] <strong> ἐν δακτύλῳ θ</strong> <strong> .</strong> = ἐν πνεύματι θ . Matt. No distinction can be established, as Gresw. attempts. The one expression explains the other. What was done (Hebraistically speaking) by the <em> finger</em> of God, was done by the Spirit of God. We have much greater variations than this in sayings demonstrably the same. And as to what the same author maintains about the relative magnitude of the works of the <em> finger, hand</em> , and <em> arm</em> of God, a reference to ref. Ps., where the <em> heavens</em> are ‘the works of Thy <em> fingers</em> ,’ will sufficiently shew how little reliance is to be placed on such subtleties.</p>
