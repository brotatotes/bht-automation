<b> 21.</b>] This parabolic sentence is in close connexion with many prophetic sayings, Isa. xl. 10 marg., liii. 12, and most pointedly Isa. xlix. 24, 25. It will be remembered that the Baptist called the Lord by this name, a stronger, or one who is mightier—placing after it, it is true, “<i>than I</i>,” but still using it as indicative of the Almightiness of the Son of God, rather than in comparison with himself.<br><br> The strong man is the adversary, Satan; his palace this present world,—John xii. 81; xiv. 80; xvi. 11. His goods or tools, or spoils—are<i> the sons of men</i>,—2 Tim. ii, 26; 1 John v. 19 (margin). With these he is clothed and armed, or rather with their<i> evil capacities</i>, which he furbishes and brightens for his use: with this<i> whole armour of the devil</i>, compare by way of contrast, the “<i>whole armour of God</i>,” Eph. vi. 11–20. Without these arms and tools he would be powerless: the evil one must have evil men—something receptive of evil—to work upon. But these the Stronger than he takes from him, and divides his spoils, Isa. lii. 12. He<i> divides his spoils</i>—turns to His own use and that of His followers all that good which the enemy had corrupted into evil.<br><br> The Stronger had already come into the strong man’s house—the the<i> Saviour</i>, into the world—and was robbing him of his captives, and making them into His own disciples—e. g. Mary Magdalene and others: but the work was not fully completed yet, till the Lord, by and in His death, overcame him that had the power of death, i.e. the devil. And that His great victory is still proceeding;—He is still taking from him one and another,—rescuing the sons of men by the power of His Gospel, till the end, when He shall (Rev. xx. 1 ff) bind him in the abyss; and though he be loosed for the final conflict by His sufferance, shall cast him overthrown into the lake of fire forever. Rev. xx. 14.
