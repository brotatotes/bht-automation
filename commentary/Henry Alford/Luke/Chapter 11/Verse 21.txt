<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] This parabolic sentence is in close connexion with many prophetic sayings, Isa 40:10 mar [85] ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12">Isaiah 53:12</span> , and most pointedly <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:24-25">Isaiah 49:24-25</span> . It will be remembered that the Baptist called the Lord by this name, ὁ ἰσχυρότερος placing after it, it is true, <strong> μου</strong> <strong> ,</strong> but still using it as indicative of the Almightiness of the Son of God, rather than in comparison with himself.

<p>The <strong> ἰσχυρός</strong> is the adversary, Satan; his <strong> αὐλή</strong> <strong> ,</strong> this present world, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:30">John 14:30</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:11">John 16:11</span> . His goods, or tools, or spoils, <strong> τὰ ὑπάρχοντα</strong> = τὰ σκεύη = τὰ σκῦλα , are <em> the sons of men</em> , 2Ti 2:26 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19">1 John 5:19</span> (Greek). With these is he clothed and armed, or rather with their <em> evil capacities</em> , which he furbishes and brightens for his use: with the πανοπλία τοῦ διαβόλου , compare by way of contrast, the πανοπλία τοῦ θεοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11-20">Ephesians 6:11-20</span> . Without these arms and tools he would be powerless: the evil one must have evil men something receptive of evil to work upon. But these the ἰσχυρότερος takes from him, and divides his spoils, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12">Isaiah 53:12</span> . He <em> divides his spoils</em> turns to His own use and that of His followers all that good which the enemy had corrupted into evil.

<p>The Stronger had already come into the strong man’s house the <em> Saviour</em> , into the <em> world</em> and was robbing him of his captives, and making them into His own disciples e.g. Mary Magdalene and others: but the work was not fully completed yet, till the Lord, by and in His death, overcame him that had the power of death, i.e. the devil. And that His great victory is still proceeding; He is still taking from him one and another, rescuing the sons of men by the power of His gospel, till the end, when He shall (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:1">Revelation 20:1</span> ff.) bind him in the abyss; and though he be loosed for the final conflict by His sufferance, shall cast him overthrown into the lake of fire for ever. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span> .</p>
