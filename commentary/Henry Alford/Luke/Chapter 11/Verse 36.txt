<b> 36.]</b> It has been said of this verse by a very able expositor (De Wette) that it is “<i>tautological</i>:<i> the second member contains the same assertion</i><i> as the first</i>.”—Let us examine this. ‘When thine eye is single (ver. 34),—i. e.<i> simple</i>,—straight and single-seeing,—thy whole body will be light.’ Then (ver. 36),— ‘if<i> this</i><i> be so</i>,—if thy whole body be light, having no part dark,—then it shall all be light as when a lamp with its brightness illuminates thee.’ Of what is our Lord speaking? Of<i> His teaching</i>, as apprehended by the simple, single-seeing soul. If then the soul be so,—having no part darkened by prejudice or selfish lusts, and approach thus to His teaching, it shall be wholly illuminated by it, as by the candle of the Lord, searching its inward parts. So this saying, which, even as it stands, is not tautological,—for the second clause expresses the further result and waxing onward of the shining light, arising from the singleness of the eye,—becomes, in its spiritual significance, a weighty declaration of truth, answering to ch. viii. 16:—see also John viii. 12.
