<b> 37. to dine]</b> This meal, as also that in John xxi. 12, 15, was not what we now understand by<i> dinner</i>, an afternoon meal, but the first meal of the day, the breakfast or dejeuner in the prime of the morning. We may retain<b> dine</b> (indeed we have no other fitting word) provided we remember this.
