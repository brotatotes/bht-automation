<b> 39.]</b> There is not the least improbability or incongruity in our Lord’s having thus spoken<i> as a guest at a meal</i> (as some of the German Commentators maintain);—His solemn work of reproof and teaching was never suspended out of mere compliment,—nor were the intentions of the Pharisees towards Him so friendly as these invitations seem to imply. They were given mostly from deference to popular opinion, and from no love to Him;—sometimes even with a directly hostile object. See vv. 53, 54, and compare also ch. vii. 44–46. Observe also, that the<i> severest parts</i> of the discourse in Matthew (vv. 13–22, 33) were not uttered on this occasion.
