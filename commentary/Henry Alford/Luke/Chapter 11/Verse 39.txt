<b> 39.]</b> There is not the least improbability or incongruity in our Lord’s having thus spoken<i> as a guest at a meal</i> (as some of the German Commentators maintain);—His solemn work of reproof and teaching was never suspended out of mere compliment,—nor were the intentions of the Pharisees towards Him so friendly as these invitations seem to imply. They were given mostly from deference to popular opinion, and from no love to Him;—sometimes even with a directly hostile object. See vv. 53, 54, and compare also ch. vii. 44–46. Observe also, that the<i> severest parts</i> of the discourse in Matthew (vv. 13–22, 33) were not uttered on this occasion.<br><br><b> Now</b>, i.e. as instanced by your present conduct—<b>Here is an instance of your</b>, &c.<br><br><b> the cup and the platter</b>—understand, ‘in the proverb’—or perhaps the application is left to be enthymematically filled up, for the next clause presupposes it.<br><br><b> the outside</b> and<b> the inward part</b><i> of a man</i>, are not the outside and inside of the body—but the outside apparent<i> conduct</i>, and the inner unseen.<i> motives</i>.<br><br> Some difficulty has been found in the parallelism of<b> the outside of the cup and platter</b> and<b> your inward part</b>. But the fact is, that the parable and its interpretation are intermixed throughout the whole, the mind of the hearer being left to find its own way in allotting each its part.
