<b> 41.</b>] Many Commentators, from whom I am compelled entirely to differ, understand this as<i> ironical</i>— ‘<i>but</i><i> ye give alms of their contents, and, behold, all things are clean</i> (in your estimation)<i> to you.’</i> But this would be altogether irrelevant to the matter in hand, which was reproof to the Pharisees for their care<i> about outward cleanliness, when the inside was left unclean</i>. It would also be altogether contrary to our Lord’s usual habit of speaking about giving alms, to make Him cast a slur on it, as this would do: see Mark x. 21; ch. xii. 33, where the expression is very similar to this.
