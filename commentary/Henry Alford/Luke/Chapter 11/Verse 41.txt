 41. ] Here again I am compelled entirely to differ from Stier, who, with Erasmus, Lightfoot, Kuinoel, Schleiermacher, &c., understands this as  ironical ‘  but ye give alms of their contents, and behold, all things are clean (in your estimation)  to you .’ But (1) this is inconsistent with the imperative  δότε  . (2) It would require ἐκ τῶν ἐνότων , for the Pharisees did not give  τὰ ἐνόντα in this sense. (3) It would be altogether irrelevant to the matter in hand, which was reproof to the Pharisees for their care  about outward cleanliness, when the inside was left unclean . (4) It would be inconsistent with the emphatic position of  τὰ ἐνόντα  , which are thus pointed out as the  true material , out of which to give alms. It would be altogether contrary to our Lord’s usual habit of speaking about giving alms, to make Him cast a slur on it, as this would do: see Mark 10:21 ; ch. Luke 12:33 , where the expression is very similar to this.
	The command is  a rebuke for their covetousness (see ch. Luk 16:14 ), which follows in close connexion with  ἁρπαγή and  πονηρία  , Luke 11:39 . The  τὰ ἐνόντα are the  contents of the vessel , which vessel (Luke 11:39 : see note above) is  ὑμεῖς  : = therefore, in its meaning, the τὰ ὑπάρχοντα of ch. Luke 12:33 , and the  πάντα καθαρά ἐστιν answers to the  θησαυρὸς ἐν οὐρανῷ of that verse, the  result of which is the  καρδία ἐν οὐρανῷ : and such persons being  καθαροὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ , to them, as τοῖς καθαροῖς ,  πάντα καθαρά ( Tit 1:15 ).
