<b> 41.</b>] Many Commentators, from whom I am compelled entirely to differ, understand this as<i> ironical</i>— ‘<i>but</i><i> ye give alms of their contents, and, behold, all things are clean</i> (in your estimation)<i> to you.’</i> But this would be altogether irrelevant to the matter in hand, which was reproof to the Pharisees for their care<i> about outward cleanliness, when the inside was left unclean</i>. It would also be altogether contrary to our Lord’s usual habit of speaking about giving alms, to make Him cast a slur on it, as this would do: see Mark x. 21; ch. xii. 33, where the expression is very similar to this.<br><br> The command is<i> a rebuke for their covetousness</i> (see ch. xvi. 14), which follows in close connexion with<i> ravening</i> (<i>plunder</i>)<i> and wickedness</i>, ver. 39.<br><br><b> such things as ye have</b> (literally,<b> the things inside</b>) are the<i> contents of the vessel</i>, which vessel (ver. 39: see note above) is<i> the men themselves</i>: and is therefore equivalent in its meaning to that<b> ye have</b> of ch. xii. 33,—and the<b> all things are clean answers</b> to the<b> treasure in heaven</b> of that verse, the<i> result</i> of which is the “<i>heart in heaven</i>:” and such persons being<b> pure</b><i> in heart</i>,—to them, as<i> to</i><i> the pure</i>,<b> all things are pure</b> (Titus i. 15).
