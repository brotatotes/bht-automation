<b> 44.</b>] See Matthew, ver. 27;â€”but here the point of comparison is different.<i> There</i> (see note)<i> the sepulchres</i><i> are whited, that men may not pass over them unawares</i>: and the comparison is to the outside fairness, and inside abomination.<i> Here</i>, the graves<i> are not seen</i>, and men thinking they are walking on clean ground<i> are defiled</i> by passing over them. Perhaps the difference of expression may have been occasioned by the greater wealth and splendour and display of the Pharisees<i> in the metropolis</i>, where Matt. xxiii. was spoken.
