 44. ] See Matthew 23:27 ; but here the point of comparison is different.  There (see note)  the sepulchres are whited, that men may not pass over them unawares: and the comparison is to the outside fairness, and inside abomination.  Here , the graves  are not seen , and men thinking they are walking on clean ground  are defiled by passing over them. Perhaps the difference of expression may have been occasioned by the greater wealth and splendour and display of the Pharisees  in the metropolis , where Matthew 23:0 was spoken.
	 οἱ ἄνθρ  .   οἱ περ  .   ἐπ  ., the men who walk over them …;   οἱ ἄνθρ  .   περ  .   ἐπ  ., men, when they walk over them.
