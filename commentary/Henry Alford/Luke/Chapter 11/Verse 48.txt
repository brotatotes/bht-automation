<b> 48.]</b> See on Matthew, vv. 34–36.<br><br> We have here a remarkable variation of expression in ver. 49,<b> the wisdom of God</b><b> said is</b> expressed by “<i>I</i>” in Matthew. Various explanations have been given of this. The difficulty is not the variation just noticed, so much as that<i> no such passage</i> exists in the O.T. But I have little doubt that the true explanation is this:—<i>the whole saying</i> is a reference to 2 Chron. xxiv. 18–22, and so marked a one, that I am surprised that no Commentators but Olahausen and Stier should have observed it, and they not thoroughly. That passage opens with remarks of the sacred historian on the delinquency of Judah and Jerusalem after the death of Jehoiada the priest: then ver. 19, ‘<i>He sent prophets to them, to bring them again to the Lord: and they testified against them: but they would not give ear. And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them…And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord…And when he died, he said, The Lord look upon it</i>, and require it.’ The words in our text are not indeed a citation, but an<i> amplification</i> of ver. 19 there—a paraphrase of them, giving the true sense of what the wisdom of God in-tended by them;—enlarging the mere historical notice which laid hold of God’s purpose only by one thread let down to the earth, into the<i> divine revelation of the whole purpose</i> of God as the counsel of His will in heaven. In Matthew, the Lord:<i> Jesus Himself</i>, as became the solemnity of that final and awful close of His testimony to His own who received Him not, stands forth as the doer of this work, the sender of the Prophets and Apostles. (On ‘<i>son of Barachias</i>, see on Matthew, ver. 35.)
