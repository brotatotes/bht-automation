<b> 5.</b>] Now follows a parable on continuing instant in prayer, of the same nature as that in ch. xviii. 2. ff. In both parables, the argument is that called à fortiori;’ “if<i> selfish man</i> can be won by prayer and importunity to give, and<i> unjust man</i> to do right, much more certainly shall the<i> bountiful</i> Lord bestow, and the<i> righteous</i> Lord do justice,” Trench; who further remarks, that here intercessory prayer is the subject of the parable; there,<i> personal</i>. And, that we must remember that all reluctance on the part of God to answer our prayers is not real, but<i> apparent</i> only, and arises from deeper reasons working for our good: whereas the reluctance in these two parables is<i> real</i>, arising from selfishness and contempt of justice.
