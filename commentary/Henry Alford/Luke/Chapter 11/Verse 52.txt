<b> 52. ye took away the key of knowledge]</b><i> “Ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men</i>,” Matthew, ver. 13, which words are the best explanation of our text:—<b>the key of knowledge</b> (i. e. not<i> of</i>, as<i> admitting to</i>, knowledge—but the key<i> is</i> the know-ledge), being that right understanding of the Law and Prophets, which should shew Him to the people, of whom they testified; this the expounders of Scripture had taken away, neither themselves entering, nor permitting those to enter who were otherwise doing so,—and thus shutting the kingdom of heaven in men’s faces.
