 52. ]  ἤρ  .   τὴν κλ  .   τῆς γν  . = κλείετε τὴν βασ. τ. οὐ . ἔμπροσθεν τ. ἀνθ . Matthew 23:14 , which words are the best explanation of our text:  the key of knowledge (i.e. not  of , as  admitting to , knowledge but the key  is the knowledge), being that right understanding of the Law and Prophets, which should shew Him to the people, of whom they testified; this the expounders of Scripture had taken away, neither themselves entering, nor permitting those to enter who were otherwise doing so, and thus shutting the kingdom of heaven in men’s faces.
