<p><strong> 1 13.</strong> ] JESUS TEACHES THE DISCIPLES TO PRAY. The locality and time of the following incident are alike indefinite. The only limits are those of the great journey which is the subject of this section. There is no reason for supposing this to be the <em> only occasion</em> on which the Lord delivered this prayer to His disciples. In the Sermon on the Mount, it stands in close connexion with what goes before; and here also. In so weighty a summary of His teaching as that was, He was not likely, when speaking of prayer, to omit it; when asked by His disciples to teach them to pray, He was not likely to depart from the form once given them. Such are ordinary probabilities, antecedent to every question affecting the two Gospels: and those critics who throw aside all such, are <em> far more prejudiced</em> in reality, than those who allow them full weight. “The peculiar and abridged form in Luke,” says Meyer, “ <em> is a proof that the apostolic Church did not use the Lord’s prayer as a form</em> .” Rather, we may say, a proof of the fidelity with which our Evangelist reproduced his original reports, not correcting them as others after him did (see var. readd.) to suit the forms most probably in use. If the apostolic Church did not use the Lord’s Prayer as a form, <em> when did its use begin</em> , which we find in every known Liturgy? (See Bingham, Antiqq xiii. 7.)</p>
