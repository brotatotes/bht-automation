 37 54. ] DISCOURSE AGAINST THE PHARISEES. There can be no antecedent improbability in the supposition that our Lord spoke on various occasions, and with various incidental references, the component parts of that great anti-pharisaic discourse contained in Matthew 23:0 .  That was spoken in the temple, during the last week of His ministry; it formed the  solemn close of His public teaching , and at the end of it He departed out of the temple to return no more. I do not think it possible to suppose any part of that discourse in Matthew to be related otherwise than in its true place; all probability is against such an idea, and so is the character of the reports of discourses in that Gospel, in general so strictly coherent and exact. There is then but one supposition left, unless we suppose Luke to have put together at random a number of fragments, and to have inserted them here,  creating an occasion for them (for it amounts to this), which is equally inconceivable. And that is, that our Lord  spoke at this meal , the occasion being the wonder of the Pharisee at His not washing before sitting down to meat,  parts of that discourse , with which He afterwards solemnly closed His public ministry. See throughout, notes on Matthew 23:0 .
