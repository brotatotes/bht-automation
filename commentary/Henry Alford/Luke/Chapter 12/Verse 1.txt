 1.   πρῶτον ] I am not convinced by Olsh., De Wette, and Meyer, that this belongs to  προσέχ  .… Every instance which they quote of πρῶτον being thus used, is where  some definite matter is subsequent to the thing said or done; e.g. Matthew 6:33 . But here is no  such matter: πρ . would only mean, ‘  earnestly ,’ ‘  be sure that you ’ … which meaning I do not think it bears. I have therefore coupled it with  τοὺς μ  .   αὐτ  ., as distinguishing this section from what follows spoken  to the crowd , Luke 12:13 ff. On the rest, see on Matthew 16:6 .
