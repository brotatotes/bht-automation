<p><strong> οὐκ ἐν τ</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] <strong> not, because a man has abundance, does his life</strong> (therefore) <strong> consist in his goods.</strong> That is, <strong> no man’s life</strong> ἐστιν ἐκ τῶν ὑπαρχ . <strong> consists in what he possesses</strong> ( οὐκ ἐπ ʼ ἄρτῳ μόνῳ ζήσεται ἄνθρωπος ); … <strong> nor</strong> ἐν τῷ περισσεύειν τινί , <strong> by his having abundance, can this be made to be the case.</strong> Man’s life is of <em> God</em> , not of <em> his goods, however abundant they may be</em> . And this is the lesson conveyed by the following parable, and lying at the foundation of the still higher lesson conveyed in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:21">Luke 12:21</span> .

<p><strong> ζωή</strong> is <em> life</em> in the pregnant sense, emphatically <strong> his life;</strong> including time and eternity. This is self-evident from the parable and its application.</p>
