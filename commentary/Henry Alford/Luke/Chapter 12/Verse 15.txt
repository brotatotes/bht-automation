<b> 15.] them. i.e.</b><i> the multitude.</i> He saw into the covetousness of the man’s disposition, and made it an instructive warning for His hearers.<br><br><b> all covetousness]</b> There is a meaning in<b> all—every kind of covetousness</b>.<i> This kind</i>, of which they had an example before them, was by no means one of the worst; but<i> all</i> kinds must be avoided.<br><br><b> not, because a man hath abundance, doth his life</b> (therefore)<b> consist in the things which he possesseth</b>. That is,<b> no man’s life consists in what he possesseth</b>; ( “<i>man shall not live by bread alone”)</i>...<b> nor by his not having abundance, can this be made to be the case.</b> Man’s life is of<i> God</i>, not of<i> his goods, however abundant they may be</i>. And this is the lesson conveyed by the following parable, and lying at the foundation of the still higher lesson conveyed in ver. 21.<br><br> The word<b> life</b> is used in the pregnant sense, emphatically<b> his life</b>; including time and eternity. This is self-evident the parable and its application.
