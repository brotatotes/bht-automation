<b> 18.]</b> “His folly is<i> fourfold</i>:—he forgets the Giver, ( ‘<i>my</i> fruits,<i> my</i> goods,’)—he greedily reserves all for<i> himself</i>,—he imagines such things to be food for his<i> soul</i>—he forgets<i> death</i>, which is every day possible.” Stier. A very striking similarity is found in Ecclesiasticus xi. 18, 19, “There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and pinching, and this is the portion of his reward: whereas be saith, I have found rest, and now will eat continually of my goods: and yet he knoweth not what time shall come upon him, and that he must leave these things to others, and die.” Stier thinks this a convincing proof that our Lord did occasionally refer to the Apocrypha.
