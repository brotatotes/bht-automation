By supposing merely a<i> divine decree</i> to be meant,<i> without personal communication</i>, as Grotius, Kuinoel, and Trench do, we lose the impressive part of the parable, where the man’s selfishness and folly is brought into immediate contact with the solemn truth of his approaching death, which certainly our Lord intends us to contemplate.<br><br><b> Thou fool</b>, opposed to his<i> worldly prudence</i>;—<b>this night</b>, to the<br><br><b> many years</b>;—the<b> soul</b> in the one case, at its ease, eating, drinking, and making merry, to the<b> soul</b> in the other, demanded, rendered up, judged.<br><br><b> they require thy soul]</b> Not strictly equivalent to “<i>Thy soul shall be required</i>,” as A.V.; there are those whose business it is, even<i> the angels</i>, the ministers of the divine purposes: see ch. vi. 38 and note. The merely impersonal sense may be defended: but this saying seems so solemn, as to require something more.<br><br><b> which thou hast provided</b>; or,<b> madest ready</b>; but<i> not for thyself</i>.
