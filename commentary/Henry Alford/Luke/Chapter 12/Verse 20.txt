By supposing merely <strong><em> a divine decree</em></strong> to be meant, <em> without personal communication</em> , as Grotius, Kuinoel, and Trench do, we lose the impressive part of the parable, where the man’s selfishness and folly is brought into immediate contact with the solemn truth of his approaching death, which certainly our Lord intends us to contemplate.

<p><strong> ἄφρων</strong> <strong> ,</strong> opposed to his <em> worldly prudence;</em> <strong> ταύτῃ τῇ ν</strong> <strong> .</strong> to the <strong> ἔτη πολλά</strong> <strong> ;</strong> the <strong> ψυχή</strong> in the one case, at its ease, eating, drinking, and making merry, to the <strong> ψυχή</strong> in the other, demanded, rendered up, judged.

<p><strong> αἰτοῦσιν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not strictly impersonal; there are those whose business it is, even <em> the angels</em> , the ministers of the divine purposes: see ch. Luk 6:38 and note. The merely impersonal sense may be defended: cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:48">Luke 12:48</span> : but this saying seems so solemn, as to require something more.

<p><strong> ἃ ἡτοίμασας</strong> <strong> , which thou madest ready;</strong> but <em> not for thyself</em> .</p>
