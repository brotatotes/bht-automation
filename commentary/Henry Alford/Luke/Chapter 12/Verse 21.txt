<b> 21.]</b><b> So</b>: so, in utter confusion, and sudden destitution cf all help and provision for eternity.<b> for himself</b>...<b> toward God…]</b> The meaning of these expressions will be brought out thus: He who is rich<i> for himself</i>, laying up treasure<i> for himself</i>, is by so much robbing his real inward life, his life in and toward God, of its resources: he is laying up store for, providing for, the<i> flesh</i>; but the<i> spirit</i>, that which God looketh into and searcheth, is stripped of all its riches.<br><br> These words may also, as remarked on ch. vi. 20, shew that St. Luke does not, as supposed by some recent critics, use ‘riches’ as merely<i> this world’s wealth</i>, but with a deeper spiritual meaning.
