 39. ] I am surprised that Schleiermacher can have imagined (transl. p. 198) that this verse has been inserted so as to break the connexion, and by a later hand. Nothing can be more exact and rigid than the connexion as it now stands. Our Lord transfers, to shew the unexpected nature of his coming, and the necessity of watchfulness, the relation between  Himself and the  servants , to that between the  thief and the  οἰκοδεσπότης  . For the purposes of this verse,  they represent the οἰκοδεσπότης collectively, as put in charge with the Lord’s house and household (thus the verse is intimately connected with Luk 12:42 ): and in the further application, individually each as the οἰκοδεσπότης of his own σκεῦος , to be kept with watchfulness against that day:  He is represented by the thief ἰδοὺ ἔρχομαι ὡς κλέπτης , Revelation 16:15 ; Revelation 3:3 .
	Olshausen’s view, that the οἰκοδ . is the ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμ . τούτου , is surely quite out of keeping with the main features of the parable. That  he should be put in the place of the watching servants (  καὶ ὑμεῖς ) seems impossible: besides that the  πιστὸς οἰκονόμος below is this very οἰκοδ ., being such in the absence of his Lord, but the  οἰκονόμος when He appears.
