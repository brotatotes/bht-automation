<b> 39.</b>] I am surprised that it should have been imagined that this verse has been inserted so as to break the connexion, and by a later hand. Nothing can be more exact and rigid than the connexion as it now stands. Our Lord transfers, to shew the unexpected nature of his coming, and the necessity of watchfulness, the relation between<i> Himself</i> and the<i> servants</i>, to that between the<i> thief</i> and the<b> master of the house</b>. For the purposes of this verse,<i> they</i> represent the master of the house—collectively, as put in charge with the Lord’s house and household (thus the verse is intimately connected with ver. 42):—and in the further application, individually—each as the householder of his own trust, he kept with watchfulness against that day:—<i>He</i> is represented by the thief—Rev. xvi. 15; iii. 3. Olshausen’s view, that the<b> master of the house</b> is the “<i>prince of this world</i>,” is surely quite out of keeping with the main features of the parable. That<i> he</i> should be put im the place of the watching servants seems impossible:"besides that the<b> faithful steward</b> below is this very “<i>master of the house</i>,” being such in the absence of his Lord, but the<b> steward</b> when He appears.
