<b> 42 ff.</b>] Our Lord does not answer the question directly, but proceeds with His discourse, so as to furnish it with an answer;—viz. that in its highest sense it applies to his Apostles and ministers, inasmuch as to them moet has been given as the<i> stewards</i>—but that its application is gradationally downwards through all those who know their Master’s will, even to the lowest, whose measure both of responsibility and of reward is more limited. For the comment on vv. 42–46 see on Matt. xxiv. 45–51. Notice that<b> unbelievers</b> here is “<i>hypocrites</i>” in Matthew.
