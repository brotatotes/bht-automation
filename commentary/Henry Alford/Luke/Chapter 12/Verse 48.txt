<b>But he that knew not</b>] The case is of one (a disciple in the Sed reference, but then generally of all men) who bonâ fide is ignorant of his Lord’s will. That such persons<i> shall be punished</i>, is both the sentence of the<b> law</b>, see Levit. v. 17–19, and an inference from the truth set forth ver. 57, and Rom. i. 19, 20, 32; ii. 14, 15,—that the<i> natural conscience</i> would have prevented the<b> not doing</b>. (Observe that the two classes,<i> not included here</i>, are “<i>he that knew and did</i>,” and “<i>he that knew not and did</i>,” as far as that can be said [see Rom. ii. 14];—the reference<i> here</i> being only to the<b> did not</b> in both cases, or rather to the “<i>did not</i>” in the first case and its equivalent “<i>did things worthy of stripes</i>” in the second.) But the difficulty seems to be to assign a<i> spiritual meaning</i> to the words,<b> shall be beaten with few stripes</b>.<i> That such will ES the case</i>, would<i> à priori</i> be consonant to the justice of the Judge of all the earth: and we have it here declared, that<i> it shall</i><i> be so</i>: but<i> how</i>, is not revealed to us. It is in vain for the sinner to encourage himself in sin from such a declaration as this: for the very knowledge of the declaration excludes him from the exemption. “Our ears have heard the voice divine; We cannot be as they.” (Christian Year.)<br><br><b> much is given.... shall be much required</b>] The second<b> much</b> is not the<b> much</b> that has been given, but a proportionable amount of result of diligence, a<b> much</b> which he is to render.<br><br><b> more</b>] perhaps,<i> more than from others</i>: but more likely<i> more than had been deposited with him</i>, viz. that, and the interest of it;—see Matt. xxv. 15 ff.
