<b> 49. fire</b>] It is extraordinary that the official announcement of the Baptist (ch. iii. 16)— “<i>He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire</i>”—connected with the mention of a baptism here,—with the promise Acts i. 5, and the appearance Acts ii. 3, so strikingly expressed as “<i>cloven (divided</i>, the very same word in the original)<i> tongues as of fire</i>”—have not kept the Commentators in general (Bleek is an exception) from falling into the blunder of imagining here that the<i> fire</i> is synonymous with, and means no more than, the<i> discord</i> and<i> division</i> which follow. The fire is,<i> the gift of the Holy Spirit</i>,—the great crowning result of the sufferings and triumph of the Lord Jesus. To follow this out in all its references belongs to another place:—see notes on Mark ix. 49, and Acts ii. 3. This fire, in its purifying and separating effects on the mass of mankind, causes the<b> division</b> afterwards spoken of.
