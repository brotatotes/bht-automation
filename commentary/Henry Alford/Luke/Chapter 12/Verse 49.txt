<b> 49. fire</b>] It is extraordinary that the official announcement of the Baptist (ch. iii. 16)— “<i>He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire</i>”—connected with the mention of a baptism here,—with the promise Acts i. 5, and the appearance Acts ii. 3, so strikingly expressed as “<i>cloven (divided</i>, the very same word in the original)<i> tongues as of fire</i>”—have not kept the Commentators in general (Bleek is an exception) from falling into the blunder of imagining here that the<i> fire</i> is synonymous with, and means no more than, the<i> discord</i> and<i> division</i> which follow. The fire is,<i> the gift of the Holy Spirit</i>,—the great crowning result of the sufferings and triumph of the Lord Jesus. To follow this out in all its references belongs to another place:—see notes on Mark ix. 49, and Acts ii. 3. This fire, in its purifying and separating effects on the mass of mankind, causes the<b> division</b> afterwards spoken of.<br><br> The<i> construction</i> of the latter words in this verse has been ever a matter of dispute, while the<i> meaning</i> is on all hands nearly agreed. The three prevalent explanations of it are: (1) That adopted in margin, which is apparently Origen’s,<b> And what will I?</b><b> would that it were already kindled!</b>This abrupt ejaculation might seem unlike the usual character of our Lord’s discourses: but we have a similar question in John xii. 27, and under corresponding circumstances, of<i> His soul being troubled</i>. (2)<b> And how I wish that it were already kindled!</b>To this, which is adopted by Theophylact, and some distinguished moderns, chief objection is, that the words of the original will not bear it: see in my Greek Test. (3) That of Euthymius, Beza, and the A.V.,<b> What will I, if it be already kindled?</b> i.e. “<i>What more do I await in the world, seeing that it is already kindled?</i>” But this presents a great difficulty as regards the context; for, by ver. 50, it evidently was not kindled: and even if this were overcome, the expression, evidently a<i> deep one of personal anxiety</i> (and be it remembered who said it), would be vapid and unmeaning in the extreme. All things then being considered, I prefer the<i> first</i> explanation.
