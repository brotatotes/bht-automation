 50. ] The symbolic nature of Baptism is here to be borne in mind.  Baptism =  Death . The figure in the Sacrament is the  drowning , the  burial , in the water, of the  old man and the  resurrection of the  new man: see 1 Peter 3:20-22 , and notes.  The Lord’s Baptism was  His Death , in which the Body inherited from the first Adam ( ἐν ὁμοιώματι σαρκὸς ἁμαρτίας ) was buried, and the new Body ( τὸ σῶμα τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ ) raised again: see Romans 6:1-11 , but especially Luke 12:10 . And He was  straitened (the best possible rendering) till this was accomplished: i.e. in anxiety and trouble of spirit.
	The δέ here implies,  but first, i.e. before that  fire can be shed abroad. Here we have then, as Stier expresses it, a ‘passio inchoata’ of our Lord; the first utterance of that deep anguish, which afterwards broke forth so plentifully, but coupled at the same time with holy zeal for the great work to be accomplished.
