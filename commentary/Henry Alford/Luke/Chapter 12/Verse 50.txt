<p><strong> 50.</strong> ] The symbolic nature of Baptism is here to be borne in mind. <em> Baptism</em> = <em> Death</em> . The figure in the Sacrament is the <em> drowning</em> , the <em> burial</em> , in the water, of the <em> old man</em> and the <em> resurrection</em> of the <em> new man:</em> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:20-22">1 Peter 3:20-22</span> , and notes. <em> The Lord’s Baptism</em> was <em> His Death</em> , in which the Body inherited from the first Adam ( ἐν ὁμοιώματι σαρκὸς ἁμαρτίας ) was buried, and the new Body ( τὸ σῶμα τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ ) raised again: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:1-11">Romans 6:1-11</span> , but especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:10">Luke 12:10</span> . And He was <strong> straitened</strong> (the best possible rendering) till this was accomplished: i.e. in anxiety and trouble of spirit.

<p>The δέ here implies, <strong> but first,</strong> i.e. before that <em> fire</em> can be shed abroad. Here we have then, as Stier expresses it, a ‘passio inchoata’ of our Lord; the first utterance of that deep anguish, which afterwards broke forth so plentifully, but coupled at the same time with holy zeal for the great work to be accomplished.</p>
