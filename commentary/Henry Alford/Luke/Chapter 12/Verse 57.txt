<b> 57.</b>] In what follows, our Lord takes occasion from the<i> request about the inheritance</i>, which had begun this discourse, to pass to infinitely more solemn matters. There is, I think, no denying that the “<i>judging what is right</i>” and the “<i>thine adversary</i>” have a reference to that request, in the ability and duty of every man to ‘judge what is right:’—but the sense of the words far outruns that reference, and treats of loftier things. ‘<i>Why do ye not discern of yourselves your true state—that which is just—the justice of your case as before God?</i><i> You are going</i> (the course of your life is the journey)<i> with your adversary</i> (the just and holy law of God)<i> before the magistrate</i> (God Himself);<i> therefore by the way take pains to be delivered from Him</i> (by repentance, and faith in the Son of God, see Ps. ii. 12),<i> lest he drag thee to the judge</i> (who adjudges the case and inflicts the fine; that is, the Son to whom alt judgment is committed),<i> and the judge deliver thee to the</i><i> exactor</i> (see Matt. xiii. 41),<i> and the exactor cast thee into prison’</i> (ditto, ver. 42).
