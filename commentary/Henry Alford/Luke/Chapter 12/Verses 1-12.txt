 1 12. ] WARNING AGAINST HYPOCRISY. A discourse spoken immediately or very soon after the former, and in connexion with it; consisting for the most part of sayings repeated from other occasions, and found nearly verbatim in Matt. It is impossible that there should be any reasonable doubt of this view, when we remember that some of them have appeared before, or appear again, in this very Gospel.
	While our Lord was in the house of the Pharisee, the multitudes appear to have assembled together again. If so,  ἐν οἷς will mean,  during which things, viz. those related above.
	He comes forth to them (ch. Luk 11:53 ) in the spirit of the discourse which He has just completed, and cautions his disciples against that part of the character of the Pharisees which was most dangerous  to them . The connexion of these twelve verses may be thus enunciated:  Beware of hypocrisy ( Luk 12:1 ),  for all shall be made evident in the end ( Luk 12:2 ),  and ye are witnesses and sharers in this unfolding of the truth ( Luk 12:3 ).  In this your work, ye need not fear men; for your Father has you in His keeping ( Luk 12:4-7 )  and the confession of my name is a glorious thing ( Luk 12:8 ),  but the rejection of it ( Luk 12:9 ),  and especially the ascription of my works to the evil one ( Luk 12:10 ),  a fearful one. And in this confession ye shall be helped by the Holy Spirit in the hour of need ( Luk 12:11-12 ).
