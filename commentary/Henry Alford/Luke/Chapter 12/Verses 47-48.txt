<p><strong> 47, 48.</strong> ] <em> Primarily</em> , in reference to the question in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:41">Luke 12:41</span> , <strong> οἱ γνόντες</strong> <strong> = </strong> <strong> ἡμεῖς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the disciples.
	</p>
<p><strong> οἱ μὴ γνόντες</strong> = <strong> πάντες</strong> , the multitude: but the application is not limited to this: the truth is one of universal extent. The 47th verse needs little explanation: after both πολλάς and ὀλίγας , <strong> πληγάς</strong> is to be supplied, see reff.: and cf. Aristoph. Nub. 959, ἐπετρίβετο τυπτόμενος πολλάς .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἑτοιμ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not ἑαυτόν , but, <strong> matters,</strong> πρὸς τ . θ . αὐ .: almost in the absolute sense of ‘making ready:’ it refers back to the γίνεσθε ἕτοιμοι of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:40">Luke 12:40</span> ; this readiness being not only preparing <em> himself</em> , but the matters over which he has charge, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:35">Luke 12:35</span> . There is reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+25:2">Deuteronomy 25:2</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁ δὲ μὴ γν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The case is of one (a disciple in the first reference, but then generally of all men) who bona fide is ignorant of his Lord’s will. That such persons <em> shall be punished</em> , is both the sentence of the law, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+5:17-19">Leviticus 5:17-19</span> , and an inference from the truth set forth <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:57">Luke 12:57</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:19-20">Romans 1:19-20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:32">Romans 1:32</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14-15">Romans 2:14-15</span> , that the <em> natural conscience</em> would have prevented the μὴ ποιῆσαι . (Observe that the two classes, <em> not included here</em> , are ὁ γνοὺς καὶ ποιήσας , and ὁ μὴ γνοὺς καὶ ποιήσας , as far as that can be said (see Rom 2:14 ); the reference <em> here</em> being only to the μὴ ποιήσας in both cases, or rather to the μὴ π . in the first case and its equivalent π . ἄξια πληγῶν in the second.) But the difficulty seems to be to assign <em> a spiritual meaning</em> to the <strong> δαρήσεται ὀλίγας</strong> <strong> .</strong> <em> That such will be the case</em> , would <em> à priori</em> be consonant to the justice of the Judge of all the earth: and we have it here declared, that <em> it shall be so:</em> but <em> how</em> , is not revealed to us. It is in vain for the sinner to encourage himself in sin from such a declaration as this: for the very knowledge of the declaration excludes him from the exemption. “Our ears have heard the voice divine; We cannot be as they.” (Christian Year.)

<p><strong> παντὶ ᾧ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> attr. for παρὰ παντός , ᾧ .
	</p>
<p><strong> πολὺ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> πολύ</strong> ] The second πολύ is not the πολύ that has been given, but a proportionable amount of result of diligence, a πολύ which he is to render.
	</p>
<p><strong> περισσ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Perhaps, <em> more than from others:</em> but more likely <em> more than had been deposited with him</em> , viz. that, and the interest of it: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:15">Matthew 25:15</span> ff.</p>
