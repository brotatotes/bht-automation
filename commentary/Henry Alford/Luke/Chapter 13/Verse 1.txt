The way of speaking here shews that it was well known to the writer. It must have occurred at some feast in Jerusalem, on which occasions riots often took place (see Jos. Antt. xvii. 9. 3; 10. 2), and in the outer court of the temple. Such slaughters were frequent, and would not be particularly recorded by the historians. This mingling of their blood with their sacrifices seems to have been thought by the narrators evidence that they were very depraved sinners: for this was their argument, and is unconsciously that of many at this day, ‘the worse the affliction, the more deserved:’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+42:21">Genesis 42:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:4">Acts 28:4</span> .</p>
