<b> 15. Ye hypocrites</b>] The Lord saw the real thoughts of his heart, that they were false, and inconsistent with his pretended zeal, and addressed the multitude as represented by him, their leader. A man hardly could give forth a doctrine so at variance with common sense and common practice, without some by-end, with which he covered his violation of truth. That by-end<i> here</i> was enmity to and jealousy of Jesus.<br><br> The instance chosen<i> exactly fits</i> the circumstances. A beast tied to the manger is confined down as this poor woman was.
