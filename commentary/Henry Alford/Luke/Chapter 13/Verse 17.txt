<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] So far am I from thinking a description of this kind to be a mere general close, put in by the Evangelist, that I would take it as an accurate and graphic account of the immediate effect of our Lord’s power and irresistible words, and the following parables as spoken <em> immediately thereupon</em> , shewing the people the ultimate conquest which the Kingdom of God should obtain over all opposition, however strong. On the parables themselves, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:31-33">Matthew 13:31-33</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> [18 21.</strong> ] These two parables, found in Matthew as above, and the former of them in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:30-32">Mark 4:30-32</span> , seem to have been again spoken by our Lord at this time, in reference to the progress of His Gospel indicated in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:17">Luke 13:17</span> . <strong> οὖν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:18">Luke 13:18</span> , is important, as pointing out the connexion. <strong> ]</strong></p>
