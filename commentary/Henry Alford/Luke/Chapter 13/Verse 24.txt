The description of<i> the broad and narrow ways</i> is not here inserted, as probably by this time, the<b> narrow</b><b> door</b> (or<b> gate</b> was a familiar image. In what follows we must not understand, ‘shall seek to enter<i> by</i><i> it</i>, and shall not be able:’—the emphasis of the command is,<b> seek to enter</b> at the<i> narrow door:</i><b> for many shall seek to</b><i><b> enter</b></i> (else-where),<b> and shall not be able</b>. After<b> enter</b> is to be supplied, in both places,<i> into salvation</i>, or<i> into the Kingdom of God</i>.
