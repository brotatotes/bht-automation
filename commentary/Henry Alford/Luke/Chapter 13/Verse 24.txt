<p><strong> ζητ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἰς</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οὐκ ἰσχ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not, ‘shall seek to enter <em> by it</em> , and shall not be able:’ the emphasis of the command is, <strong> seek to enter</strong> <em> at the strait door:</em> <strong> for many shall seek to </strong> <strong><em> enter</em></strong> (elsewhere), <strong> and shall not be able.</strong> After <strong> εἰσελθ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> is to be supplied in both places, εἰς σωτηρίαν , or εἰς τ . βασ . τ . θεοῦ .
