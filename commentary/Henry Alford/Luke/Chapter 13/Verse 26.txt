	Both these are  ἐνώπιόν σου merely,  in His presence; very different from the drinking  μεθ  ʼ   ὑμῶν of which He speaks Matthew 26:29 , and from the δειπνήσω μετ ʼ αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς μετ ʼ ἐμοῦ , Revelation 3:20 .
	 ἐν τ  .   πλ  .   ἡμ  .   ἐδ  ., applicable directly to those to whom the words were spoken; and further, in its fuller sense, to all among whom the gospel is preached, even till the end.
