<b> 26. We have eaten and drank in thy presence]</b> As applied to the<i> then assembled crowd</i>, these words refer to the miracles of feeding,—<br><br>perhaps also to His having so often sat at meat in the houses of various persons (the drinking must not be as meaning anything different from the<i> eating</i>:—the expression is a general one for taking a meal); as applied to Christians, to the eating and drinking whereof those miracles were anticipatory. Both these are merely in<i> His presence</i>;—very different from the drinking ‘with you” of which He speaks Matt. xxvi. 29, and from<i> “I will sup with him and he with me,”</i> Rev. iii. 20.<br><br><b> thou hast taught in our streets]</b> Applicable directly to those to whom the words were spoken; and further, in its fuller sense, to all among whom the Gospel is preached, even till the end.
