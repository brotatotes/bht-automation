<p><strong> 26. </strong> <strong> ἐφάγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐνώπ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σου κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐπ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] As applied to the <em> then assembled crowd</em> , these words refer to the miracles of feeding, perhaps also to His having so often sat at meat in the houses of various persons (the <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐπίομεν</strong> must not be pressed as meaning any thing different from <strong> ἐφάγ</strong> <strong> .:</strong> the expression is a general one for taking a meal); as applied to <em> Christians</em> , to <em> the eating and drinking</em> whereof those miracles were anticipatory.
	</p>
<p>Both these are <strong> ἐνώπιόν σου</strong> merely, <em> in His presence;</em> very different from the drinking <strong> μεθ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ὑμῶν</strong> of which He speaks <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:29">Matthew 26:29</span> , and from the δειπνήσω μετ ʼ αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς μετ ʼ ἐμοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+3:20">Revelation 3:20</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐδ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> applicable directly to those to whom the words were spoken; and further, in its fuller sense, to all among whom the gospel is preached, even till the end.</p>
