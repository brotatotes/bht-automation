<p><strong> 27. </strong> <strong> ἐργάται ἀδικ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This unusual expression seems to mean, <em> persons engaged in the hire and receiving the wages</em> of unrighteousness: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span> , where οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι τ . ἀνομίαν answers to it. This meaning of ἐργάτης is peculiar: see reff.</p>
