<p>These Pharisees appear to have been sent by Herod for the purpose of getting rid of Jesus out of his jurisdiction. Considering his character, it is hardly possible that he should really have wished to kill <em> one who was so popular;</em> he refused to do so when Jesus was in his power afterwards in Jerusalem; but, as great multitudes were now following Him about, and superstitious fears, as we know, agitated Herod, he wished to be quit of Him, and took this means of doing so. I think this view is necessary to justify the epithet applied to Herod, which certainly implies <em> cunning on his part</em> . Stier thinks the Pharisees <em> invented</em> the tale about Herod: but then how can the <em> epithet applied to him</em> be explained? I cannot for a moment believe, as he does, that our Lord saw through the lie of the Pharisees, and yet <em> adopted</em> it, meaning the ἀλώπηξ to signify themselves. “That Jesus in a public discourse uses such an expression of the ruler of his country, is not to be judged of by the manners, and ways of speech, of our times. The free-spokenness of the ancient world, which we meet with especially in the Hebrew prophets, allowed such strong expressions, without any thing peculiarly offensive being found in them.” Bleek.</p>
