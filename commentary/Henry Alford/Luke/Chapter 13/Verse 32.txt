but, as great multitudes were now following Him about, and superstitious fears, as we know, agitated Herod, he wished to be quit of Him, and took this means of doing so. I think this view is necessary to justify the epithet applied to Herod, which certainly implies<i> cunning on his part.</i> Stier thinks the Pharisees<i> invented</i> the tale about Herod: but then how can the<i> epithet applied to him</i> be explained? I cannot for a moment believe, as he does, that our Lord saw through the lie of the Pharisees, and yet<i> adopted</i> it, meaning the fox to signify themselves. “That Jesus in a public discourse uses such an expression of the ruler of his country, is not to be judged of by the manners, and ways of speech, of our times. The free-spokenness of the ancient world, which we meet with especially in the Hebrew prophets, allowed such strong expressions, without any thing peculiarly offensive being found in them.” Bleak.<br><br>The interpretation of this answer is difficult, for two reasons— (1) that the signification of the<b> to day, to morrow,</b> and<b> the third day</b> is doubtful— (2) that the meaning of<b> I am perfected</b> is also doubtful.<br><br> The days mentioned are ordinarily supposed to be proverbially used;<b> to day,</b> for his present working—<b>to morrow,</b> for that between the present time and his arrival at Jerusalem—<b>the third day,</b> for that arrival, and the end of his work and course by his Death.<br><br> Against this, is (1) the positive use of the<i> three days,</i> in an affirmative sentence,—of which no instance can be brought where the proverbial meaning is implied:— (2) the verb<b> journey,</b> proceed on my mission, belonging to<i> all three</i> in ver. 33, whereas thus it only belongs to the two first.<br><br> The interpretation adopted by Meyer (and Bleek) is this:—In three days (literal days) the Lord’s working of miracles in Galilee would be ended, which had excited the apprehension of Herod: and then He would leave the territory, not for fear of Herod, but because He was going to Jerusalem to die. The objection to this is, that the sense—of<i> ending these present works of healing, &c.</i> does not seem a sufficient one for<b> I am perfected,</b> which, as applied to the Lord, surely must include His Death. I own that neither of the above interpretations satisfies me,—and still less the various modifications of them which have been proposed. Nor can I suggest any less open to objection:—but merely state my conviction, (1) that the days mentioned must have some<i> definite reference to three actual days:</i> (2) that<b> perfected</b> is used in the solemn sense elsewhere attached to the word: see John iv. 34,<i> “finish:”</i> v. 36, xvii. 4; Acts xx. 24; 2 Cor. xii. 9; Heb. ii. 10, v. 9, vii. 28, especially; x. 14, xi. 40, are 28; in all which places it is used in the original.<br><br> If this Gospel had been a chronological calendar of our Lord’s journey, the meaning would probably have been clear: but<b> as we</b> have none such, it is, and I believe must remain, obscure. Dr. Wordsworth’s note is much to the point: “It must be remembered that Herod was ruler of Peræa as well as of Galilee: and that John the Baptist had been put to death at Machærus, where Herod had a palace about ten miles E. of Jericho, and thirty E. of Jerusalem. St. Matt. xix. 1, and St. Mark, x. 1, 46, speak of our Lord being in Peræa, whence He passed over the river Jordan, and so came to Jericho, and thence to Bethany and Jerusalem for His Passion. Herod had put John to death not in Galilee but in Peræa; and if our Lord was now, as seems probable, in Peræa or near it, it was very likely that the Pharisees should endeavour to intimidate Him with a threat of Herod’s anger.”<br><br><b> the day</b><b> following</b> means the same as<i> “the third day”</i> above.
