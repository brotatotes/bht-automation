For<i> “for,”</i> which<i> there</i> accounts for the<i> desolation</i> of the temple, then for the last time left by our Lord,<i> does not appear here,</i> but<b> and</b> (or<b> but</b>) introducing<b> a fresh</b> saying,<i> having</i> I believe<i> another</i><b> meaning:</b> and the words “from<i> henceforth</i>,” which follow<i> “ye shall not see me”</i> there, marking that<i> moment</i> as the<b> commencement</b> of the dereliction, are here omitted. Surely these differences indicate an uttering of the words<i> prophetically,</i> previous to their utterance in the act of departure. Our Lord overleaps in prophetic foresight the death Just set forth as certain, and speaks of the ages to come, during which holy city should be desolate and trodden down of the Gentiles.
