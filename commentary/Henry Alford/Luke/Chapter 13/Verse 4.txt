Our Lord introduces this incident as shewing that whether the hand of man or (so-called) accidents, lead to inflictions of this kind, it is in fact but one Hand which doeth it all—Amos iii. 6. There is also a transference from the Galilæans—a despised people—to the<i> inhabitants of Jerusalem</i>, on whom the fulness of God’s wrath was to be poured out in case of impenitence. Of the incident itself, or of the<i> tower in Siloam</i> (the word here meaning probably the<i> district</i> in which the fountain, John ix. 7, was situated,—though on the whole matter, and the situation of the fountain itself, there is considerable uncertainty), we know nothing. See also Neh. iii. 15.
