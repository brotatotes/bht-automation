They were many. Moses, the Prophets, the Baptist, the Lord Himself, the Apostles and Teachers after Him. But what<i> one Personality</i> might be set forth as pervading all these, ‘striving with man’ in them all—as being<b> the vine-dresser?</b> Clearly it seems to me,<i> the Holy Spirit of God</i>.
