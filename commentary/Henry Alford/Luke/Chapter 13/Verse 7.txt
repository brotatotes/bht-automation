<b> 7. three years</b>] I have little doubt that an<i> allusion</i> is intended to the<i> three years of our Lord’s ministry</i>. The objection to this, that the cutting down ought then to have taken place<i> at the end of</i><b> this year</b>, does not apply; for all is left indefinite in the request and the implied answer. In the individual application,<i> many thousands did bear fruit this very year</i>; and of those who did not, who shall say<i> when</i> the Spirit ceased pleading with them, and the final sentence went forth?<br><br><b> why moreover cumbereth it the ground?</b>] i.e. Why, besides bearing no fruit, is it a impoverishing the soil—rendering the neighbouring ground useless?
