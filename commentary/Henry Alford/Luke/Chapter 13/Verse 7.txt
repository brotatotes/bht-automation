 7.   τρία ἔτη ] I have little doubt (against Bleek, alli [91] .) that an  allusion is intended to the  three years of our Lord’s ministry .

In the individual application,  many thousands did bear fruit this very year; and of those who did not, who shall say  when the Spirit ceased pleading with them, and the final sentence went forth?
