 9. ] After  καρπόν  , λείπει , τὸ εὖ ἔχει , Euthym [92] ; but not without reason: to fill up the aposiopesis  did not belong to the purpose of this parable .
	 [92] Euthymius Zigabenus, 1116
	 εἰς τὸ μέλλον  , not ἔτος (Meyer), but indefinite (see reff.),  hereafter: and purposely so; because,  in the collective sense , the sentence lingered.
	 ἐκκόψεις  , THOU  shalt cut it down not ἐκκόψω ; and I find in this an additional proof of the correctness of the foregoing interpretation. It is the κύριος τ . ἀμπελῶνος who ὅταν ἔλθῃ , κακοὺς κακῶς ἀπολέσει αὐτούς .
	 All judgment is committed to THE SON: it is not the work of the Holy Spirit to cut down and destroy, for He is the Giver of  life .
	The above interpretation is partially given by Stier, who has however in my view (in his 2nd edn. also) quite missed the ἀμπελουργός , understanding by him  the husbandmen in Matthew 21:0 , forgetting that they are  destroyed in the sequel of that parable, and that their position, that of the  tenants of the vineyard, does not appear at all in this, any more than does the ἀμπελουργός in that.
