<b> 9.</b>] After<b> fruit</b> there is a breaking off, and<b> well</b> is to be supplied: but not without reason: to fill up the sentence<i> did not belong to the purpose of this parable</i>.<br><br><b> hereafter</b>] This word belongs to<b> bear fruit</b>, not as in A.V., to the latter clause of the verse. We must remember, that as regards the Jews<i> in the collective sense</i>, the sentence lingered 40 years.<br><br> THOU<b> shalt cut it down</b>—not, “<i>I</i> will cut it down;” and I find in this an additional proof of the correctness of the foregoing interpretation. It is the “<i>lord of the vineyard</i>” who<i> “when He cometh</i>,<i> shall wretchedly destroy those wretches</i>.”<i> All judgment is committed</i> to THE Son:—it is not the work of the Holy Spirit to cut down and destroy, for He is the Giver of<i> life</i>.<br><br> The above interpretation is rtially given by Stier, who has however in my view quite missed the<i> vine-dresser</i>, understanding by him<i> the husbandmen in Matt</i>. xxi., forgetting that they are<i> destroyed</i> in the sequel of that parable, and that their position, that of the<i> tenants</i> of the vineyard, does not appear at all in this, any more than does the<i> vine-dresser</i> in that.
