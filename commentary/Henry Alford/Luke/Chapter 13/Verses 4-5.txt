<p><strong> 4, 5.</strong> ] Our Lord introduces this incident as shewing that whether the band of man or (so called) accidents, lead to inflictions of this kind, it is in fact but one Hand which doeth it all <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="am+3:6">Amos 3:6</span> . There is also a transference from the Galilæans a despised people to the <em> inhabitants of Jerusalem</em> , on whom the fulness of God’s wrath was to be poured out in case of impenitence. Of the incident itself, or of the <em> tower in Siloam</em> (probably the district in which the fountain, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:7">John 9:7</span> , was situated, though on the whole matter, and the situation of the fountain itself, there is considerable uncertainty), we know nothing.

J. ver. 4. 2: see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ne+3:15">Nehemiah 3:15</span> . In B. J. vi. 7. 2, he uses μέχρι τοῦ Σιλωάμ , as here, meaning apparently a district of the city: see on John l. c.

<p><strong> ὀφειλέται</strong> <strong> , sinners,</strong> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span> ; perhaps the same thought may be traced as pervading the saying, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:58-59">Luke 12:58-59</span> , of the last chapter. (No such idea as that the tower was a <em> prison for debtors</em> is for a moment to be thought of.)

<p><strong> ὡσαύτως</strong> ] See on ὁμοίως above, <strong> similarly</strong> in the ruin of your whole city. This does not render it necessary that these words should have been spoken to actual dwellers in Jerusalem: for nearly the whole nation was assembled there at the time of the siege.</p>
