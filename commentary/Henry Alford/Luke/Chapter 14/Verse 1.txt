	 τ  .   ἀρχ  . [  τ  . ]  Φ  ., of the chief men of the Pharisees; or, if the  τῶν be omitted,  of the Pharisees who were rulers. Though the Pharisees had no official rulers as such, they had men to whom they looked up, as Hillel, Schammai, Gamaliel, &c. (Meyer.)

Again, ‘observa diem Sabbati, non Judaicis deliciis …’ in Psalms 32:2 , Enarr. ii. § 6.
