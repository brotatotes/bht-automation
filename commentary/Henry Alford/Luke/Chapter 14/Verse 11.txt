 11.] As an example of the first clause, see Isa. xiv. 13–15; of the second, Phil. ii. 6–11. 13–14.) The<i> composition of the company before Him</i> seems to have given occasion for this saying of our The Pharisee his host had doubtless, with the view (of watching Him) mentioned in ver. 1, invited the principal persons of the place, and with the intention of<i> courting their favour,</i> and<i> getting a return.</i> The Lord rebukes in him this spirit;—and it has been well remarked, that the intercourse and civilities of social life among<i> friends</i> and<i> neighbours</i> are here<i> presupposed,</i> (inasmuch as for them there takes place a<i> recompense,</i> and they are struck off the list by this means,) with this caution,—that our means are not to be<i> sumptuously laid out upon them,</i> but upon<i> something far better,</i>—the providing for the poor and maimed and lame and blind. When we will make s sacrifice, and provide at some cost, let us not throw our money away, as we should if a recompense is made to us in this world: but give it to the poor, i.e. lend it to the Lord; and then, as in ver. 14, there will be a recompense at the resurrection of the just, which shall not be a mere equivalent, but a rich reward.
