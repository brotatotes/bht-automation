<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] I think with Stier (iii. 202, edn. 2), that our Lord here speaks <em> in his own Person:</em> <strong> ὑμῖν</strong> will fit no circumstance in the parable; for the householder and his servant are alone: the guests are not present.
	</p>
<p>Our Lord speaks, with His usual λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν , <em> to the company present:</em> and half continuing the parable, half expounding it, substitutes <em> Himself</em> for the master of the feast, leaving it hardly doubtful who <strong> ἄνδρες ἐκεῖνοι οἱ κεκλημένοι</strong> are.</p>
