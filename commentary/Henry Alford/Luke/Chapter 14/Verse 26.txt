hate not</b>] It is well to enquire what sense this word here bears. That no such thing as<i> active hatred</i> can be meant, is plain: our Lord himself is an example to the contrary, John xix. 25–27; the<i> hate</i> is the<i> general,</i> not<i> personal,</i> feeling of alienation in the inmost heart,—so that this world’s relationships, as belonging<i> to the state things in this world,</i> are not the<i> home</i> and<i> rest</i> of the heart. This is evident from the<b> yea, and his own life also,</b> which follows. Let the<i> hate begin here,</i> and little explanation will be further wanted. This addition also shews that the saying<b> was</b> not meant only for those times, in which more perhaps of the disruption of earthly ties was required, but for<i> all time:</i> for<i> his</i><i> own life</i> is equally dear to every man in every age. It hardly need be observed that<i> this hate</i> is not only consistent with, but<i> absolutely necessary</i> to the very highest kind of love. It is that element in love which<b> makes a man a wise and Christian friend,</b>—not for time only, but for eternity.
