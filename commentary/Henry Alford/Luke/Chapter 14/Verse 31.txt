This same lesson is even more pointedly set before us in the following parable, which,<b> as well as</b> the other, is frequently misunderstood. The<i> two kings</i> here are,—the<i> man desirous to become a disciple,</i> to work out his salvation,—and GOD, with whose just and holy law he is<i> naturally at variance;</i>—it is his adversary,” see ch. xii. 58, and note:—these two are to<b> engage in war;</b> and the question for each man to cit down and ask himself is, ‘Can I, with (the word may probably mean<i> clad</i> in,—surrounded by, all that I have, all my instrument of war) my ten thousand, stand the charge of Him who cometh against me with (the preposition is different, and may represent<i> only as many as He pleases to bring with Him</i> for the purpose, see Ps. xviii. 17, A.V.) twenty thousand?’—see Job xv. 24–26.
