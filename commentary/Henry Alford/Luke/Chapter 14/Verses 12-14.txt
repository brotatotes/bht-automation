 12 14. ] The  composition of the company before Him seems to have given occasion for this saying of our Lord. The Pharisee his host had doubtless, with the view (of watching Him) mentioned in Luke 14:1 , invited the principal persons of the place, and with the intention of  courting their favour , and  getting a return . The Lord rebukes in him this spirit; and it has been well remarked, that the intercourse and civilities of social life among  friends and  neighbours are here  pre-supposed , (inasmuch as for them there takes place an ἀνταπόδομα , and they are struck off the list by this means,) with this caution, that our means are not to be  sumptuously laid out upon them , but upon  something far better , the providing for the poor and maimed and lame and blind. When we will make a sacrifice, and provide at some cost, let us not throw our money away, as we should if an ἀνταπόδομα is made to us in this world: but give it to the poor, i.e. lend it to the Lord; and then, as in Luke 14:14 , there will be an ἀνταπόδ . ἐν τ . ἀναστ . τ . δικ ., which shall not be a mere equivalent, but a rich reward.
