<p><strong> 12 14.</strong> ] The <em> composition of the company before Him</em> seems to have given occasion for this saying of our Lord. The Pharisee his host had doubtless, with the view (of watching Him) mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:1">Luke 14:1</span> , invited the principal persons of the place, and with the intention of <em> courting their favour</em> , and <em> getting a return</em> . The Lord rebukes in him this spirit; and it has been well remarked, that the intercourse and civilities of social life among <em> friends</em> and <em> neighbours</em> are here <em> pre-supposed</em> , (inasmuch as for them there takes place an ἀνταπόδομα , and they are struck off the list by this means,) with this caution, that our means are not to be <em> sumptuously laid out upon them</em> , but upon <em> something far better</em> , the providing for the poor and maimed and lame and blind. When we will make a sacrifice, and provide at some cost, let us not throw our money away, as we should if an ἀνταπόδομα is made to us in this world: but give it to the poor, i.e. lend it to the Lord; and then, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:14">Luke 14:14</span> , there will be an ἀνταπόδ . ἐν τ . ἀναστ . τ . δικ ., which shall not be a mere equivalent, but a rich reward.
