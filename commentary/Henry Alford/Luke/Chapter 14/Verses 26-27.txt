 26, 27. ] See Matthew 10:37-38 , and note. The remark there made of the  strangeness of this sound of  the Cross , still applies: our Lord had not yet announced his death  by crucifixion .
	 μισεῖ ] It is well to enquire what sense this word here bears. That no such thing as  active hatred can be meant, is plain: our Lord himself is an example to the contrary, John 19:25-27 ; the  hate is the  general , not  personal , feeling of alienation in the inmost heart, so that this world’s relationships, as belonging to  the state of things in this world , are not the  home and  rest of the heart. This is evident from the  ἔτι τε κ  .   τ  .   ἑαυ  .   ψυχήν which follows. Let the  hate begin here , and little explanation will be further wanted. This addition also shews that the saying was not meant only for those times, in which more perhaps of the disruption of earthly ties was required, but  for all time: for ἡ ἑαυτοῦ ψυχή is equally dear to every man in every age. It hardly need be observed that  this hate is not only consistent with, but  absolutely necessary to the very highest kind of love. It is that element in love which makes a man a  wise and Christian friend , not for time only, but for eternity.
	Beware of thinking, with Wordsw., that in εἶναί μου μαθητής , there is any emphasis on μου . Rather is it in the  least emphatic place in the sentence, in order to throw all the stress on the verb εἶναι : cf. ἵνα γεμισθῇ μου ὁ οἶκος , Luke 14:23 ; καταφαγών σου τὸν βίον , ch. Luke 15:30 . In Luke 14:33 , the collocation is different, and μου has a secondary emphasis. See remarks on this idea of Wordsworth’s, in note on Matthew 16:18 .
