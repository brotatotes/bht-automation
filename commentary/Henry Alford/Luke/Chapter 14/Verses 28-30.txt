<p><strong> 28 30.</strong> ] Peculiar to Luke. <em> The same caution</em> is followed out in this parable. This is to be borne in mind, or it will be misinterpreted. The ground of the parable is, that <em> entire self-renunciation</em> is requisite, to become a disciple of Christ. This man wishes to build a tower: to raise that building (see 1Co 3:11-15 ), which we must rear on the one Foundation, and which shall be tried in the day of the Lord. He is advised to count the cost, to see whether he have enough thoroughly to finish it. If he begin, lay the foundation, however seemingly well it may be done, it is <em> not well done</em> , because he has not enough to complete it: and the attempt can only lead to shame. So it is with one who would be Christâ€™s disciple: but with this weighty difference, lying in the background of the parable that in his case the counting the cost must <em> always</em> issue in a discovery of the utter inadequacy of his own resources, and the going <em> out of himself</em> for strength and means to build.</p>
