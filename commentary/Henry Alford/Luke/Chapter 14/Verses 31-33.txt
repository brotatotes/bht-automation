 31 33. ] This same lesson is even more pointedly set before us in the following parable, which, as well as the other, is frequently misunderstood. The  two kings here are, the  man desirous to become a disciple , to work out his salvation, and GOD, with whose just and holy law he is  naturally at variance; it is his ἀντίδικος , see ch. Luke 12:58 , and note: these two are going to engage in war: and the question for each man to sit down and ask himself is, ‘Can I, with (  ἐν  ,  clad in ,  surrounded by, all that I have , all my instrument of war) my ten thousand, stand the charge of Him who cometh against me with (  μετά  , being  only as many as He pleases to bring with Him for the purpose, see Psalms 68:17 , E. V.) twenty thousand?’ see Job 15:24-26 .
	Here the inadequacy of man’s resources is  plainly set forth , not left, as in the former parable, to be inferred.
	Then, finding that he has no hope of prevailing,  ἔτι αὐτοῦ πόῤῥω ὄντος  , while there is yet time, he sends an embassy, and sues for peace, abandoning the conflict: throwing himself upon the mere mercy and grace of God;  ἀποτασσόμενος πᾶσιν τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ ὑπάρχουσιν  , in both cases.
	The ordinary misinterpretation of this parable is in taking the king with twenty thousand to be the ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου τούτου which  destroys all the sense: for with him the  natural man is at peace , but the  disciple of Christ at war .
