The  οὖν and  καί  , here restored to the text, are both valuable; the former as importing the recurrence of a saying known before, the latter as giving force to the supposition. The  salt , in Scripture symbolism, is the whole life-retaining antiseptic influence of the Spirit of God: this, working in the εἶναί μου μαθητής , is good: but if even this be corrupted if the mere appearance of this, and not the veritable salt (which is the  savour ), be in you wherewith, &c.?
