 11. ]  ἄνθ  .   τις  our heavenly Father , the Creator and Possessor of all:  not Christ , who ever represents Himself  as a Son , although frequently as a possessor or lord.
	 δύο υἱούς  ,  not , in any  direct or primary sense of the Parable,  the Jews and the Gentiles: that there may be an ulterior application to this effect, is only owing to the parable grasping the  great central truths , of which the Jew and Gentile were, in their relation, illustrations, and of which such illustrations are furnished wherever such differences occur.
	The two parties standing in the  foreground of the parabolic mirror are,  the Scribes and Pharisees as the elder son, the  publicans and sinners as the younger; all,  Jews: all belonging to God’s family. The mystery of the admission of the Gentiles into God’s Church was not yet made known in any such manner as that they should be represented as of one family with the Jews; not to mention that this interpretation fails in the very root of the Parable; for in strictness the Gentile should be the  elder , the Jew not being constituted in his superiority till 2000 years after the Creation.
	The upholders of this interpretation forget that when we speak of the Jew as elder, and the Gentile as younger, it is in respect not of birth, but of  this very return to and reception into the Father’s house, which is  not to be considered yet . Bp. Wordsworth’s objections (in loc.) do not touch the reasons here given. The relations of elder and younger have a peculiar fitness for the characters to be filled by them, and are I believe chosen on that account; νεώτερον δὲ ὀνομάζει τὸν ἁμαρτωλὸν ὡς νηπιόφρονα καὶ εὐεξαπάτητον .
