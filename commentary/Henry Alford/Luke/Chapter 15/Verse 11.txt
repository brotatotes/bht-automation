<b> 11.</b>]<b> a certain man</b>—<i>Our heavenly Father,</i> the Creator and Possessor of all:<i> not Christ,</i> who ever represents Himself<i> as a son</i>, although frequently as a possessor or lord.<br><br><b> two sons</b>,<i> not</i>, in any<i> direct</i> or primary sense of the Parable,<i> the Jews and the Gentiles:</i> that there may be an ulterior application to this effect, is only owing to the parable grasping the<i> great central truths</i>, of which the Jew and Gentile were, in their relation, illustrations,—and of which such illustrations are furnished wherever such differences occur.<br><br> The two parties standing in the<i> foreground</i> of the parabolic mirror are,<i> the Scribes and Pharisees</i> as the elder son, the<i> publicans and sinners</i> as the younger;—all,<i> Jews:</i> all, belonging to God’s family. The mystery of admission of Gentiles into God’s Church was not yet made known in any such manner as that they should be represented as of one family with the Jews;—not to mention that this interpretation fails in the very root of the parable; for in strictness the Gentile should be the<i> elder,</i> the Jew not being constituted in his superiority till 2000 years after the Creation.<br><br> The upholders of this interpretation forget that when we speak of the Jew as elder, and the Gentile as younger, it is in respect not of birth, but of<i> this very</i> return to and reception into the Father’s house, which is<i> not to be considered yet.</i> The objections of these interpreters do not touch the reasons here given. The relations of elder and younger have a peculiar fitness for the characters to be filled by them, and are I believe chosen on that account; as Euthymius says, “He names the sinner the younger, as being childish in mind and easily led astray.”
