<p>Such a request as this is shewn by Orientalists to have been known in the East, though not among the Jews.

<p><strong> βίος</strong> <strong> = </strong> <strong> οὐσία</strong> : no distinction is implied, as some (Paulus, Stier) have thought. The first-born had <em> two-thirds</em> of the property, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+21:17">Deuteronomy 21:17</span> . The father, as implied in the parable, reserves to himself the power during his life over the portion of the first-born, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:31">Luke 15:31</span> .

<p>The parable sets before us very strikingly the <em> permission of free will</em> to man.</p>
