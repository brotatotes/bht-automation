 14.   λιμὸς ἰσχ  . ] On λιμός fem., see note on ref. Acts.
	This famine is the shepherd seeking his stray sheep the woman sweeping to find the lost. The famine, in the interpretation, is to be  subjectively taken; he begins to  be in want (no stress on αὐτός , which is inserted on account of the change of subject from the last clause), to  feel the emptiness of soul which precedes either utter abandonment or true penitence.
