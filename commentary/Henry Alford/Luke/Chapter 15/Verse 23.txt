<b> 23. the fatted calf</b>] So Judg. vi. 25. Gideon is commanded to kill<i> thy father’s young bullock of seven years old</i> (rendered by the LXX<i> thy father fatted</i><i> calf</i>): some calf fatted for a particular feast or anniversary, and standing in the stall. No allusion must be thought of to the<i> sacrificing of Christ:</i>—which would be<i> wholly out of place</i> here,—and is<i> presupposed</i> in whole parable.
