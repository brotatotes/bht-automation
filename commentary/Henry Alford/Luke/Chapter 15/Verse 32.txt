We may remark that the difficulties which have been found in the latter part of the parable, from the<i> uncontradicted</i> assertion in ver. 29, if the<i> Pharisees</i> are meant,—and the great pride and uncharitableness shewn, if<i> really righteous persons</i> are meant,—are considerably lightened by the consideration, that the contradiction of that assertion would have been<i> beside the purpose of the parable</i><i>;</i> that it was the very thing on which the Pharisees prided themselves; that, besides, it<i> is</i> sufficiently contradicted<i> in fact</i>, by the spirit and words of the elder son. He was breaking his Father’s commandment even when he made the assertion,—and the making it is part of his hypocrisy.
