<b> 4.]</b> It is the<i> Owner Himself</i> who goes to seek, see Ezek. ver. 11—<i>God in Christ</i>. The<b> hundred sheep</b> are the house of Israel, see Matt. x. 6; but in<i> present</i> application, mankind: (not, ‘<i>believers in Christ</i>;’ see on ver. 7.)<br><br> The argument is to<i> their self-interest</i>: but the act on the part of the good Shepherd is, from the nature of the case, one of<i> love</i>; or, as Stier remarks, also human love for<i> his own</i>; for in Him, Love, and His glory, are one and the same thing.<br><br><b> the</b><b> ninety and nine]</b> These pass altogether into the background, and are lost sight of. The character of the good Shepherd is a sufficient warrant for their being well cared for. The<b> wilderness</b> is not a barren place, but one abounding in pastures (John vi. 10, compared with Matt. xiv. 15).
