<p><strong> 7. </strong> <strong> λέγω ὑμῖν</strong> ] In these words the Lord often introduces His revelations of the unseen world of glory: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:10">Matthew 18:10</span> .

<p>On these <strong> δίκαιοι</strong> <strong> ,</strong> see note at <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:12-13">Matthew 9:12-13</span> . They are the <em> subjectively</em> righteous, and this saying respects their own view of themselves. (Or if it be required that the words should be literally explained, seeing that these ninety-nine <em> did not err</em> , then I see no other way but to suppose them, in the deeper meaning of the parable, to be the <em> worlds that have not fallen;</em> and the one that has strayed, our human nature, in this our world.) But we have yet to enquire, <em> what sort of sinner</em> this parable represents: for each of the three sets before us a <em> different type</em> of the sinner sunk in his sin. Bengel, in distinguishing the three, says, ‘Ovis, drachma, filius perditus peccator (1) stupidus, (2) sui plane nescius, (3) sciens et voluntarius.’ This one is the <em> stupid</em> and <em> bewildered</em> sinner, erring and straying away in ignorance and self-will from his Shepherd, but sought by the Shepherd, and fetched back with joy.</p>
