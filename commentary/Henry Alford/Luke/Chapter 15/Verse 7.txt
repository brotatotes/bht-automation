<b> 7. I say unto you]</b> In these words the Lord often introduces His revelations of the unseen world of glory: see Matt. xviii. 10.<br><br> On these<b> just persons</b>, see note at Matt. ix. 12, 13. They are the<i> subjectively</i> righteous, and this saying respects their own view of themselves. (Or if it be required that the words should be literally explained, seeing that these ninety-nine<i> did not err</i>,—then I see no other way but to suppose them, in the deeper meaning of the parable, to be the<i> worlds that have not fallen</i>;—and the one that has strayed, our human nature, in this our world.) But we have yet to enquire,<i> what sort of sinner</i> this parable represents; for each of the three sets before us a<i> different type</i> of the sinner sunk in his sin. Bengel, in distinguishing the three, says, “The sheep, the drachma, the prodigal son;—signify respectively, (1) the stupid sinner,— (2) the sinner wholly unconscious of the fact and of himself,— (3) the sinner conscious and of purpose.” This one is the stupid and bewildered sinner, erring and straying away in ignorance and self-will from his Shepherd, but sought the Shepherd, and fetched back with joy.
