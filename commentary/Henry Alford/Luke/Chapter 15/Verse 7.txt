 7.   λέγω ὑμῖν ] In these words the Lord often introduces His revelations of the unseen world of glory: see Matthew 18:10 .
	On these  δίκαιοι  , see note at Matthew 9:12-13 . They are the  subjectively righteous, and this saying respects their own view of themselves. (Or if it be required that the words should be literally explained, seeing that these ninety-nine  did not err , then I see no other way but to suppose them, in the deeper meaning of the parable, to be the  worlds that have not fallen; and the one that has strayed, our human nature, in this our world.) But we have yet to enquire,  what sort of sinner this parable represents: for each of the three sets before us a  different type of the sinner sunk in his sin. Bengel, in distinguishing the three, says, ‘Ovis, drachma, filius perditus peccator (1) stupidus, (2) sui plane nescius, (3) sciens et voluntarius.’ This one is the  stupid and  bewildered sinner, erring and straying away in ignorance and self-will from his Shepherd, but sought by the Shepherd, and fetched back with joy.
