 9. ]  αἱ φίλαι κ  .   γείτονες are invited but there is  no return home now nor in the explanation, Luke 15:10 , is there any ἐν οὐρανῷ , because the Spirit  abides in the Church because the  angels are present in the Church , see 1 Corinthians 11:10 : nor is it ἔσται (as in Luk 15:7 at the return of the Redeemer then future), but  γίνεται the ministering spirits rejoice over every soul that is brought out of the dust of death into God’s treasure-house by the searching of the blessed Spirit.
	In this parable then we have set before us the sinner who is unconscious of  himself and  his own real worth; who is lying, though in reality a precious coin, in the mire of this world, lost and valueless, till he is searched out by the blessed and gracious Spirit. And that such a search will be made, we are here assured.
