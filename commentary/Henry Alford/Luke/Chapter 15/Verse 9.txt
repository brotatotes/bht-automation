<b> 9.</b>]<b> her</b> (female)<b> friends her neighbours</b> are invited—but there is<i> no return home</i> now—nor in the explanation, ver. 10, is there any “<i>in heaven,</i>” because the Spirit<i> abides in the Church</i> because the<i> angels are present in the</i><i> Church,</i> see 1 Cor. xi. 10:—nor is it “<i>shall be</i>” (as in ver. 7 at the return of the Redeemer then future), but is—the ministering spirits rejoice over every soul that is brought out of the dust of death into God’s treasure-house by the searching of the blessed Spirit.<br><br> In this parable then we have set before us the sinner who is unconscious of<i> himself</i> and<i> his own real</i><i> worth</i>; who is lying, though in reality a precious coin, in the mire of this world, and valueless, till he is searched out by the blessed and gracious Spirit. And that such a search will be made, we are here assured.<br><br> We have here the and welcome reception of the returning sinner (sinner under the most aggravating circumstances) in the bosom of his heavenly Father: and agreeably to the circumstances under which the discourse was spoken, the<b> just men</b> who murmured at publicans and sinners are represented under the figure of the elder son:—see below. The parable certainly was spoken on the same occasion as the preceding, and relates to the same subject. Those who for the sake of upholding the patristic interpretation deny this, seem to me to have entirely missed the of the parable: see below.
