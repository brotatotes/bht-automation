 11 32. ] THE PRODIGAL SON.  Peculiar to Luke . ‘If we might venture here to make comparisons, as we do among the sayings of  men , this parable of the Lord would rightly be called,  the crown and pearl of all His parables .’ Stier, iii. 227, edn. 2.
	We have here the glad and welcome reception of the returning sinner (sinner under the most aggravating circumstances) in the bosom of his heavenly Father: and agreeably to the circumstances under which the discourse was spoken, the δίκαιοι who murmured at the publicans and sinners are represented under the figure of the elder son: see below. The parable certainly was spoken on the same occasion as the preceding, and relates to the same subject. Bp. Wordsworth, who for the sake of upholding the patristic interpretation denies this, seems to me to have entirely missed the scope of the parable: see below.
