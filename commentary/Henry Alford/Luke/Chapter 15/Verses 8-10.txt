<p><strong> 8 10.</strong> ] THE LOST PIECE OF MONEY. In the following wonderful parable, we have the next class of sinners set before us, sought for and found by the power and work of the Spirit in the Church of Christ. It will be seen, as we proceed, how perfectly this interpretation comes out, not as a fancy, but as the <em> very kernel and sense</em> of the parable. The <strong> γυνή</strong> cannot be <em> the Church absolutely</em> , for the Church herself is a lost sheep at first, sought and found by the Shepherd. Rather is the <strong> οἰκία</strong> here the Church as will come out by-and-by, and the <strong> γυνή</strong> the <em> indwelling Spirit</em> , working in it. All men belong to this Creator-Spirit; all have been <em> stamped with the image of God</em> . But the sinner lies in the dust of sin and death and corruption ‘sui plane nescius.’ Then the Spirit, lighting the candle of the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+20:27">Proverbs 20:27</span> ; Zep 1:12 ), searching every corner and sweeping every unseen place, <em> finds out</em> the sinner; restores him to his true value as made for God’s glory. This lighting and sweeping are to be understood of the office of the Spirit in the Church, in its various ways of seeking the sinner by the preaching of repentance, by the Word of God read, &amp;c. Then comes the joy again.</p>
