<b> 1.</b>]<b> he said also</b>—a continuation, I believe, of the foregoing:—certainly closely connected in subject with it, as is the second parable in this chapter also: see below.<br><br><b> unto his disciples</b>, not to the<i> Twelve only</i>, but to the<i> multitude of the disciples</i>; and more immediately perhaps to the<i> Publicans</i>, whose reception by Him had been the occasion of this discourse. I say this because I believe them to hold<i> a</i> place, though not a principal or an exclusive one, in the application of the parable which follows.<br><br><b> There was a certain rich man....</b>] The history of this parable is, in itself, purely<i> worldly</i>. The<i> master</i> is a<i> son of this world</i>, as well as his steward:<i> bear this in mind:</i>—the whole parabolic machinery is<i> from the standing-point</i><i> of the children of this world.</i> In the interpretation, this rich man is<i> the Almighty Possessor of all things</i>. This is the<i> only tenable view</i>. Meyer, who supposes him to be<i> Mammon</i> (defending it by the consideration that<i> dismissal from his service</i> is equivalent to<i> being received into everlasting habitations</i>, which it<i> is not</i>—see below), is involved in inextricable difficulties further on. Olshausen’s view, that he represents the<i> Devil</i>, the<i> prince of this world</i>, will be found equally untenable. Schleiermacher’s, that the<i> Romans</i> are intended, whose stewards the Publicans were, and that the debtors are the Jews, hardly needs refuting;—certainly not<i> more</i> refuting, than any consistent exposition will of itself furnish.<br><br><b> a steward</b>, a general overlooker—very much what we understand by<i> an agent,</i> or ‘a man of business,’ or, in the larger sense,<b> a steward</b>. They were generally of old,<i> slaves:</i> but this man is a<i> freeman</i>, from vv. 3, 4. This steward represents especially the<i> Publicans</i>, but also<i> all the disciples</i>, i.e.<i> every man in Christ’s Church</i>. We are all God’s stewards, who commits to our trust His property:—each one’s office is of larger or smaller trust and responsibility, according to the measure entrusted to him. I say,<i> especially the Publicans</i>, because the Twelve, and probably others, had<i> relinquished all and followed Christ</i>, and therefore the application of the parable to them would not be<i> so direct:</i> and also because I cannot but put together with this parable and consider as perhaps prompted by it or the report of it, the profession of Zacchæus, ch. xix. 8. Others have supposed the steward to represent the<i> Pharisees</i>—but then the parable should have been<i> addressed to them</i>, which it was not: and this view entirely fails in the application.<br><br><b> was accused unto him</b>: it is the same word in the original which generally represents<i> false</i> or<i> wrongful</i> accusation. This it was not here, but it<i> was</i><i> malicious</i>: and the reason why the word has come so generally to signify<i> ‘wrongful</i> accusation,’ is, that malicious charges are so frequently slanderous. The steward himself does not deny it.<br><br> The charge against him was not, that he<i> had wasted</i> (A. V.), but<b> was wasting</b>, his master’s goods. In this charge (spiritually) we may see the real guilt of every man who is entrusted with the goods of our Heavenly Father. We are all ‘scattering his goods’ If some one is to be found to answer to<i> the accusers</i>, the analogy of ‘the Accuser of the brethren’ is too striking to escape us.
