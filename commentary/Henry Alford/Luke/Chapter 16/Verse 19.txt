<b> 19.]</b><b> Now</b> connects this directly with what goes before; being an answer, not immediately to<i> any thing</i><i> said</i> by the Pharisees, but to their<i> scoffs</i> at Him;—as if He had said, ‘<i>hear now a parable.</i>’<br><br><b> a certain rich man.]</b> Tertullian thought that<i> Herod</i> was meant, and by Lazarus<i> John</i>; and this view has been taken by others also: but surely with no probability. Our Lord might hint with stern rebuke at the present notorious crime of Herod, but can hardly be thought to have spoken thus of him. That the circumstances<i> will in some measure apply to these two</i>, is owing, as above in ch. xv., to the parable taking the<i> general case</i>, of which theirs was a particular instance. Others have thought that the rich man sets forth the Jews and the poor man the Gentiles. In my view, the very name of the poor man (see below) is a sufficient answer to this.<br><br> Observe, that this rich man is<i> not accused of any fragrant crimes</i>:—he lives, as the world would say,<i> as became his means and station</i>; he does not oppress nor spoil other men: he is simply a<b> son of this generation</b>, in the highest form.<br><br><b> purple and fine linen</b>, the Tyrian costly purple—and the fine linen (for under clothing) from Egypt.
