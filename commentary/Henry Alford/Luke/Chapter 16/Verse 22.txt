<b> 22.]</b> The<i> burial</i> of Lazarus is not mentioned, “on account of the neglect attending the burial of beggars,” as Euthymius.<br><br><b> was carried by the angels]</b> In the whole of this description, the following canon of interpretation may be safely laid down:—Though it is unnatural to suppose that our Lord would in such a parable formally<i> reveal</i> any<i> new truth</i> respecting the state of the dead,—yet, in conforming himself to the ordinary language current on these subjects, it is impossible to suppose that He, whose essence is Truth, could have assumed as existing any thing which does not exist. It would destroy the truth of our Lord’s sayings, if we could conceive Him to have used popular language which<i> did not</i><i> point at truth</i>. And accordingly, where<i> such</i> language was current, we find Him not adopting, but protesting against it: see Matt. xv. 5.<br><br> The bearing of the spirits of the just into bliss by the holy angels is only analogous to their other employments: see Matt. xiii. 41: Heb, i. 14.<br><br><b> Abraham’s bosom]</b> The above remark does not apply here—for this, a form of speech among the Jews, was not even by themselves understood in its strict literal sense; and though the<i> purposes of the parable</i> require this, ver. 23, no one would think of pressing it into a truth, bot all would see in it the graphic filling up of a state which in itself is strictly actual. The expression<b> Abraham's bosom</b> signified the h<i> appy side of Hadës</i>, where all the Fathers were conceived as resting in bliss.<br><br> No preeminence is signified as in John xiii. 23;—<i>all the blessed</i> are spoken of as in Abraham’s bosom. See also John i. 18.<br><br> The death of the rich man<i> last</i> should be remarked; Lazarus was taken soon from his sufferings; Dives was left longer, that he might have space to repent.<br><br><b> and was buried]</b> There can be no doubt that the<i> funeral</i> is mentioned as being congruous to his station in life,—and, as Trench observes, ‘in a sublime irony,’—implying that he had all things<i> properly cared for</i>; the purple and fine linen which he wore in life, not spared at his obsequies.
