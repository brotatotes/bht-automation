 23.   ἐν τ  .   ᾅδῃ ] Hades, שְׁאוֹל , is the abode of  all disembodied spirits till the resurrection; not, the place of torment, much less  hell , as understood commonly, in the E. V.
	Lazarus was  also in Hades , but separate from Dives; one on the blissful, the other on the baleful side. It is the  gates of Hades, the imprisonment of death , which shall not prevail against the Church ( Mat 16:18 ); the Lord holds the  key of Hades , ( Rev 1:18 ); Himself went into the same Hades, of which Paradise is a part.
	 ἐν βασάνοις not  eternal condemnation; for the judgment has not yet taken place; men can only be judged  in the body , for the deeds  done in the body: but,  the certainty and anticipation of it .
	 ἐπάρας  , not necessarily  to a higher place , though that  may be meant: see reff.
