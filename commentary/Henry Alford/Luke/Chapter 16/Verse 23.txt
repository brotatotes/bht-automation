<b> 23. in Hadës]</b> Hadës, in Hebrew Sheöl, is the abode of<i> all disembodied</i><i> spirits</i> till the resurrection; not, the place of torment,—much less<i> hell</i>, as understood commonly, in the A.V. Lazarus was<i> also in Hadës</i>, but separate from Dives; one on the blissful, the other on the baleful side. It is the<i> gates of</i><i> Hadës, the imprisonment of death,</i> which shall not prevail against the Church (Matt. xvi. 18);—the Lord holds the<i> key of Hadës</i> (Rev. i. 18):—Himself went into the same Hadës, of which Paradise is a part.<br><br><b> in torments</b>—<i>not eternal condemnation;</i>—for the judgment has not yet taken place; men can only be judged<i> in the body,</i> for the deeds<i> done in the body</i>:—but,<i> the certainty and anticipation of it.</i><br><br><b> he lift up his eyes</b>, not necessarily<i> to a higher place</i>, though that<i> may</i> be meant.
