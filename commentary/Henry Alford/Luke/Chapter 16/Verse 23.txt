<p><strong> 23. </strong> <strong> ἐν τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ᾅδῃ</strong> ] Hades, שְׁאוֹל , is the abode of <em> all disembodied spirits</em> till the resurrection; not, the place of torment, much less <em> hell</em> , as understood commonly, in the E. V.
	</p>
<p>Lazarus was <em> also in Hades</em> , but separate from Dives; one on the blissful, the other on the baleful side. It is the <em> gates of Hades, the imprisonment of death</em> , which shall not prevail against the Church ( Mat 16:18 ); the Lord holds the <em> key of Hades</em> , ( Rev 1:18 ); Himself went into the same Hades, of which Paradise is a part.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν βασάνοις</strong> not <em> eternal condemnation;</em> for the judgment has not yet taken place; men can only be judged <em> in the body</em> , for the deeds <em> done in the body:</em> but, <em> the certainty and anticipation of it</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐπάρας</strong> <strong> ,</strong> not necessarily <em> to a higher place</em> , though that <em> may</em> be meant: see reff.</p>
