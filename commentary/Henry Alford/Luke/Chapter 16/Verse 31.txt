They would not hear Moses and the Prophets:—Christ rose from the dead, but He did not go to<i> them</i>;—this verse is not<i> so</i> worded, ‘they would have rejected Him, had He done so;’—the<i> fact</i> merely is here supposed, and that in the very phrase which so often belongs to His own resurrection. They were not persuaded—did not believe, though One rose from the dead. To deny altogether this allusion, is to rest contented with merely the surface of the parable.<br><br> Observe, Abraham does not say, ‘they will not<i> repent</i>’—but, ‘they will not<i> believe, be persuaded:</i>’ which is another and a deeper thing.<br><br> Luther does not seem to conclude rightly, that this<i> disproves</i> the possibility of appearances the dead. It only says, that such appearances will not bring about<i> faith</i> in the human soul: but that they may not serve other ends in God’s dealings with men, it does not assert. There is no gulf between the<i> earth</i> and Hadës: and the very form of Abraham’s answer, setting forth no impossibility in this second case, as in the former, would seem to imply its<i> possibility,</i> if requisite.<br><br> We can hardly pass over the identity of the<i> name</i> LAZARUS with that of him who<i> actually was recalled from the dead,</i> but whose return, far from persuading the Pharisees, was the immediate exciting cause of their crowning act of unbelief.
