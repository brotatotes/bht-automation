 8. ]  ὁ κύριος of course,  the lord of the steward . The E. V. ought to have been expressed  his lord, and there would have been no ambiguity.
	 τ  .   ο κ  .   τῆς ἀδ  ., not ‘  the steward for his injustice ,’ but (see reff.)  the unjust steward. He is not praised ‘for his  injustice: ’ see below.
	 ὅτι φρονίμως ἐπ  .,  because he had acted shrewdly, cleverly for his own interest . The point brought out is not merely the shrewdness of the steward, but  his lord , whose injury was wrought by this very shrewdness,  praising it:  for , our Saviour adds,  the sons of this world, to which category  both belonged  he who conceived and  he who praised the shrewdness  are  more shrewd,   εἰς τ  .   γ  .   τ  .   ἑαυ  ., for the purposes of  their  self-interest,  than the sons of light. But this very  τὴν ἑαυ  . indicates that there  is a better and a higher  γενεά  ,  the family of light (John 12:36 ; Romans 13:12 ; Eph 5:8 ; 1Th 5:5 ), whose interests require a higher and better wisdom and foresight. It is hardly necessary to add that the  discovery of the steward’s trick by the master is essential to the parable, as exemplifying the φρονίμως and φρονιμώτεροι . Had the master (as Wordsw.) merely seen the  result , that the debtors received him into their houses, the praise could hardly have been put in this form. The aor. ἐποίησεν too seems to point at the past device, rather than the permanent result.
