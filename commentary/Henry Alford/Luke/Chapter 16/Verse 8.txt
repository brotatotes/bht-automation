<p><strong> 8.</strong> ] <strong> ὁ κύριος</strong> of course, <em> the lord of the steward</em> . The E. V. ought to have been expressed <strong> his lord,</strong> and there would have been no ambiguity.

<p><strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ο κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῆς ἀδ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not ‘ <em> the steward for his injustice</em> ,’ but (see reff.) <strong> the unjust steward.</strong> He is not praised ‘for his <em> injustice:</em> ’ see below.

<p><strong> ὅτι φρονίμως ἐπ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> <em> because he had acted shrewdly, cleverly for his own interest</em> . The point brought out is not merely the shrewdness of the steward, but <em> his lord</em> , whose injury was wrought by this very shrewdness, <em> praising it:</em> <strong> for</strong> , our Saviour adds, <strong> the sons of this world,</strong> to which category <em> both</em> belonged <em> he who conceived</em> and <em> he who praised</em> the shrewdness <strong> are</strong> <strong> more shrewd, </strong> <strong> εἰς τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἑαυ</strong> <strong> ., for the purposes of</strong> <em> their</em> <strong> self-interest,</strong> <strong> than the sons of light.</strong> But this very <strong> τὴν ἑαυ</strong> <strong> .</strong> indicates that there <em> is a better and a higher</em> <strong> γενεά</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <em> the family of light</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:36">John 12:36</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:12">Romans 13:12</span> ; Eph 5:8 ; 1Th 5:5 ), whose interests require a higher and better wisdom and foresight. It is hardly necessary to add that the <em> discovery</em> of the steward’s trick by the master is essential to the parable, as exemplifying the φρονίμως and φρονιμώτεροι . Had the master (as Wordsw.) merely seen the <em> result</em> , that the debtors received him into their houses, the praise could hardly have been put in this form. The aor. ἐποίησεν too seems to point at the past device, rather than the permanent result.</p>
