<b> 9.</b>] We now pass to the application at once—from the mouth of our Lord Himself. All that is dishonest and furtive in the character of the steward belonged entirely to him as a<i> son of this world:</i> but even in this character there was a point to praise and imitate. And the dishonesty itself is not inserted without purpose—viz. to shew us<i> how little the sons of this world scruple to use it, and how natural it is to them. Now, however,</i> we stand on higher ground:<i> to the pure, all things are pure:</i>—in bringing up the example into the purer air which the children of light breathe, its grosser parts drop off, and the finer only remain.<br><br> Notice the emphasis, which ought always to be observed in reading,<i> And I say unto</i><b> you.</b> It seems to recognize a necessary difference in the two situations:— ‘although<i> you</i> are children of the light and the day, and<i> can do no such furtive acts, yet</i> I<i> say to</i> YOU’..... This view will explain how we may make<b> friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,</b> just as we can make an example for ourselves out of the<b> steward of unrighteousness</b>—that which is of itself<b> of unrighteousness</b>—which belongs to, is part of a system of,<i> unrighteousness</i>—which is the very<i> root of all evils,</i> the result, and the aptest concretion, of that system of<i> mine</i> and<i> thine</i> (see ch. xv. 12) which is itself the result of sin having entered into the world. And we are to use this mammon of unrighteousness to make ourselves,—not palaces, nor barns, nor estates, nor treasures,—but<i> friends;</i> i.e. to bestow it on the poor and needy— (see ch. xii. 33, which is the most striking parallel to our text—<i> “when it fails,”</i> with<i> “a treasure which shall not fail”</i>)<b> that when it shall fail,—they,</b> i.e. the friends— (compare the joy in heaven ch. xv. 7, 10, and Baxter’s remark cited there by Stier— ‘Is there joy in heaven at thy conversion, and will there be none at thy glorification?’)<b> may receive you into the</b> (or their)<b> everlasting tabernacles</b>. See also ch, xiv. 13, 14.<br><br> God repays in their name. They receive us there with joy, if they are gone before us: they receive us there by making us partakers of their prayers, ‘which move the Hand that moves the world,’ even during this life.<br><br> Deeds then of charity and mercy are to be our spiritual shrewdness, by which we may turn to our account the<i> unjust mammon,—</i>providing ourselves with friends out of it;—and the debtors are here perhaps to be taken in their literal, not parabolic sense—we are to lighten their burdens by timely relief—the only way in which a son of light can change the hundred into fifty, or fourscore: see Isa. lviii. 6–8.
