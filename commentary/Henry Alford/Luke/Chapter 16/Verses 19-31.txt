<p><strong> 19 31.</strong> ] Our Lord, in this closing parable, grasps the whole covetous and self-seeking character of the Pharisees, shews them a case in which it is carried to the utmost, by one who ‘ <em> made no friends</em> ’ with the unrighteous Mammon; places in contrast with it a case of extreme destitution and poverty, the very thing which the φιλάργυρος most abhorred; and then passes over into the region beyond the grave, shewing them the contrast there also and ending with a mysterious prophetic hint at the final rejection of the Kingdom of God and Himself by those for whom the law and prophets were insufficient to bring them to repentance. And while it does not appear that the φιλαργυρία of the Pharisees shewed itself in this particular way, our Lord here grasps the depravity by its root, which is, <em> a godless and loveless self-seeking</em> saying in the heart, ‘There is no God’ and acting accordingly.
