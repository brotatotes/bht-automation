There may have been reasons unknown to us; but one we can plainly see, and that is, to bring out for the Church the lesson which the history yields. In their going away, in the absence of Jesus they are healed: what need to go back and give Him thanks? Here was a trial of their <em> love: faith</em> they had, enough to go, and enough to be cleansed: but <em> love</em> (with the one exception) gratitude, they had not.
