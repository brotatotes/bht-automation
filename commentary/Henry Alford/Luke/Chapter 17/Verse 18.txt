<p><strong> 18. </strong> <strong> ὁ ἀλλογ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οὗτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The Samaritans were <em> Gentiles;</em> not a <em> mixed race</em> , as is sometimes erroneously supposed. They had a <em> mixed religion</em> , but were themselves originally from other countries: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:24-41">2 Kings 17:24-41</span> . There may have been a reason for the nine Jews not returning, that they held the ceremonial duty imposed on them to be paramount, which the Samaritan might not rate so highly. That he was going to Mount Gerizim does not appear: from his being found with Jews, he probably would act as a Jew.</p>
