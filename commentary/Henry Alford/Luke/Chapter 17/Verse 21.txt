<b> 21.]</b> Its coming shall be so gradual and unobserved, that none during its waxing onward shall be able to point here or there for a proof of its coming,—<b>for behold the kingdom of God is (already) among you</b>. The misunderstanding which rendered these words ‘<i>within you</i>’ meaning this in a spiritual sense, ‘<i>in your hearts</i>,’ should have been prevented by reflecting that they are addressed. to the<i> Pharisees</i>, in whose hearts it certainly<i> was</i> not. Nor could the expression in this connexion well bear this spiritual meaning<i> potentially</i>—i. e. is in its nature, within your hearts. The words are too express and emphatic for this. The kingdom of God was<i> begun among them</i>, and continues thus making its way in the world, without observation of men; so that whenever men can say ‘lo here!or, lo there!’—whenever great ‘revivals’ or ‘triumphs of the faith’ can be pointed to, they stand self-condemned as<i> not belonging to that kingdom</i>. Thus we see that every such marked event in the history of the Church is by God’s own hand as it were<i> blotted</i> and<i> marred</i>, so as not to deceive us into thinking that the kingdom has come. So it was at the Pentecostal era:—so at that of Constantine;—so at the Reformation.
