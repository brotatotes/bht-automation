 21.   οὐδὲ ἐρ  .… ] Its coming shall be so gradual and unobserved, that none during its waxing onward shall be able to point here or there for a proof of its coming.
	 ἰδοὺ γάρ ]  for behold the kingdom of God is (already) among you. The misunderstanding which rendered these words ‘  within you ,’ meaning this in a spiritual sense, ‘  in your hearts ,’ should have been prevented by reflecting that they are addressed to the  Pharisees , in whose hearts it certainly  was not. Nor could the expression in this connexion well bear this spiritual meaning  potentially i.e. is in its nature, within your hearts. The words are too express and emphatic for this. We have the very expression, Xen. Anab. i. 10. 3, ἀλλὰ καὶ ταύτην ἔσωσαν ( οἱ Ἕλληνες ) καὶ ἄλλα ὁπόσα  ἐντὸς αὐτῶν καὶ χρήματα καὶ ἄνθρωποι ἐγένοντο πάντα ἔσωσαν : see also John 1:26 ; John 12:35 , both of which are analogous expressions. See the two renderings compared in Bleek’s note.
	The kingdom of God was  begun among them , and continues thus making its way in the world, without observation of men; so that whenever men can say ‘lo here or lo there,’ whenever great ‘revivals’ or ‘triumphs of the faith’ can be pointed to, they stand self-condemned as  not belonging to that kingdom . Thus we see that every such marked event in the history of the Church is by God’s own hand as it were  blotted and  marred , so as not to deceive us into thinking that the kingdom has come. So it was at the Pentecostal era: so at that of Constantine; so at the Reformation.
	The meaning ‘among you,’ includes of course the deeper and personal one ‘within each of you,’ but the two are not convertible.
