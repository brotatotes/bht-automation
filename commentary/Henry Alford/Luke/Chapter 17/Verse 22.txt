<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] This saying is <em> taken up from</em> ἐντὸς ὑμῶν ἐστίν . ‘ <em> He is among you, who is the Bridegroom</em> , <em> the Son of Man;</em> ’ during whose presence ye cannot mourn, but when He shall be taken from you, you shall wish in vain for one of these days of His presence.

<p>Stier (iii. 362) thinks this addressed to the Pharisees also, and to apply to their recognizing too late in their future misery the Messiahship of Jesus: but this does not appear from the text.

<p>Meyer tries to prove this interpretation altogether wrong, from the ἐν τ . ἡμέραις τ . υἱ . τ . ἀνθ ., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:26">Luke 17:26</span> . But the words have the general meaning of <em> the days of the Son of Man’s presence</em> , and this extends on to His <em> future</em> presence, or παρουσία , as well. Of course, if they <em> hereafter</em> desired to see one of the days of His presence, it would be a second or future presence.</p>
