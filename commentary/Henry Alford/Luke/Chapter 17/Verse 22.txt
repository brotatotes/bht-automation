 22. ] This saying is  taken up from ἐντὸς ὑμῶν ἐστίν . ‘  He is among you, who is the Bridegroom ,  the Son of Man; ’ during whose presence ye cannot mourn, but when He shall be taken from you, you shall wish in vain for one of these days of His presence.
	Stier (iii. 362) thinks this addressed to the Pharisees also, and to apply to their recognizing too late in their future misery the Messiahship of Jesus: but this does not appear from the text.
	Meyer tries to prove this interpretation altogether wrong, from the ἐν τ . ἡμέραις τ . υἱ . τ . ἀνθ ., Luke 17:26 . But the words have the general meaning of  the days of the Son of Man’s presence , and this extends on to His  future presence, or παρουσία , as well. Of course, if they  hereafter desired to see one of the days of His presence, it would be a second or future presence.
