 5. ]  πρόσθ  .   ἡμ  .   πίστ  ., ‘  increase our faith ,’ of the E. V., is not exact:  give us more faith, is more literal and simpler. Wordsw.’s rendering, “Give faith in addition to our other privileges, powers, and virtues,” is not so probable, seeing 1) that faith is not the crowning item in such a list, but the first and most elementary: and 2) that, had this been intended, it would most probably have been expressed πρόσθ . ἡμῖν καὶ πίστιν .
	This is the only example in the Gospels in which  the Apostles are marked out as requesting or saying any thing to the Lord. They are amazed at the greatness of the faith which is to overcome σκάνδαλα and forgive ἁμαρτήματα as in Luke 17:3-4 : and pray that  more faith may be added to them.
