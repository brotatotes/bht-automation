<b>The Pharisee stood</b> (in the ordinary place)<b> and prayed thus with himself</b>:—such a prayer he would not dare to put up aloud. The Church has admirably fitted to this parable the declaration of thankfulness in 1 Cor. xv. 9, 10 (the two being the Epistle and Gospel for the Eleventh Sunday after Trinity), also made<i> by a Pharisee</i>, and also on the ground ‘<i>that he was not as other men:</i>’—but how different in its whole spirit and effect!There, in the deepest humility, he ascribes it to the<i> grace of God</i> that he laboured more abundantly than they all;—<b>yet</b><i><b> not</b><b> I</b></i><b>, but the grace of God that was with me.</b>
