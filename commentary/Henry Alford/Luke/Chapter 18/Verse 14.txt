Therefore he who would seek justification before God must seek it by humility and not by self-righteousness.<br><br><b> every one that exalteth himself</b> has been illustrated in the demeanour of the Pharisee;—<b>shall be abased</b>, in his failure to obtain justification from God:—<b>he that humbleth himself,</b> in that of the Publican;—<b>shall be exalted</b>, in his obtaining the answer to his prayer, which was<i> this justification</i>. Thus the particular instance is bound up with the general truth.
