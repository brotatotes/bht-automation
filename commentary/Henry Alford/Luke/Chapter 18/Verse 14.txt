 14. ] The sense is, One returned home in the sight of God with his prayer answered, and that prayer had grasped the true object of prayer, the forgiveness of sins (so that  δεδ  . is in the usual sense of the Epistles of Paul,  justified before God see reff.), the other prayed not for it, and obtained it not. Therefore he who would seek justification before God must seek it by humility and not by self-righteousness.
	 ὅτι πᾶς ὁ ὑψῶν ἑαυτ  . has been illustrated in the demeanour of the Pharisee;  ταπεινωθ  . in his failure to obtain justification from God:  ταπεινῶν ἑαυτόν in that of the Publican;  ὑψωθήσ  . in his obtaining the answer to his prayer, which was  this justification . Thus the particular instance is bound up with the general truth.
