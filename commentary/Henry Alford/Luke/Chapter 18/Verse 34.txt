<b> 34.</b>] Peculiar to Luke.<b> none of these things</b>â€”i. e. neither the Sufferings nor the Resurrection.<b> All was as</b> yet hidden from them, and it seems not to have been till very shortly before the event itself that they had any real expectation of its happening.<br><br> I have on Matthew spoken of the discrepancy of his narrative from the two others. The supposition that they were two miracles is perfectly monstrous: and would at once destroy the credit of St. Matthew as a truthful narrator. If farther proof of their identity were wanting to any one, we might find it in the fact that so many expressions are common to Mark and Luke: compare the wording of the two accounts. In Matthew of course they are in the plural, as he has<i> two</i> blind men.
