 4. ]  ἐπὶ χρ  .… for some time, not, ‘  for a long time .’ τλῆτε , φίλοι , καὶ μείνατ ʼ ἐπὶ χρόνον , Il. β . 299:  for a while, E. V.
	The point of this part of the parable is, the extortion of  right from  such a man by importunity.  His act was not an act of justice, but of injustice; his very ἐκδίκησις was ἀδικία , because he did it from  self-regard , and  not from a sense of duty . He, like the steward above, was τῆς  ἀδικίας  ,  belonging to, being of , the iniquity which prevails in the world.
