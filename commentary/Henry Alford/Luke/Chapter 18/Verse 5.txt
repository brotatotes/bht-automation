	 ὑπωπιάζῃ  , from ὑπώπιον , the part of the cheek immediately beneath the eyes, signifies literally  to smite in the face; and proverbially (see reff.),  to mortify or  incessantly annoy. It answers exactly to the Latin  obtundo , which Terence has in this sense, ‘  Ne me obtundas hac de re sæpius ,’ Adelph. i. 2. 33; and alli [103] . fr. Livy, ‘  Neque ego obtundam, sæpius eadem nequicquam agendo ,’ ii. 15. The Greek word does not appear to be any where used in this sense; so that the use of it here may be a Latinism, as Grotius thought. Meyer interprets it literally ‘  lest at last she should become desperate and come and strike me in the face .’ It has been observed that the Apostles acted from this very motive when they besought the Lord to send away the Syrophœnician woman, ‘for she  cried after them .’ Matthew 15:23 .
