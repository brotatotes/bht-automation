 1 8. ] THE UNJUST JUDGE. This parable, though not perhaps spoken in immediate unbroken sequence after the last discourse, evidently arose out of it: perhaps was the fruit of a conversation with the disciples about the day of His coming and the mind with which they must expect it. For observe that in its  direct application it is ecclesiastical; and not individual, but by a legitimate accommodation. The widow is the Church; the judge, her God and Father in heaven. The argument, as in the parable of the steward τῆς ἀδικίας , so in this of the κριτὴς τῆς ἀδικίας , is  à fortiori: ‘If such be the power of earnest entreaty, that it can win right even from a man sunk in selfishness and fearing neither God nor men, how much more will the right be done by the just and holy God in answer to the continued prayers of his elect:’ even though, when this very right is asserted in the world by the coming of the Son of Man, He may hardly find among his people the power to believe it though few of them will have shewn this unweariedness of entreaty which the poor widow shewed?
