 35 43. ] HEALING OF A BLIND MAN AT THE ENTRANCE INTO JERICHO. Matthew 20:29-34 .Mark 10:46-52; Mark 10:46-52 , where see notes.
	I have on Matt. spoken of the discrepancy of his narrative from the two others. The supposition that they were two miracles is perfectly monstrous; and would at once destroy the credit of Matthew as a truthful narrator. If further proof of their identity were wanting to any one, we might find it in the fact that the following expressions are common to Mark and Luke. In Matt. of course they are in the plural, as he has  two blind men. ἐκάθητο παρὰ τ . ὁδὸν ἐπαιτῶν ( προσαίτης ἐκαθ . π . τ . ὁδ .) Ιησοῦς ὁ Ναζωραῖος (- αρηνός ) ἐπετίμων αὐτῷ ἵνα σιγήσῃ ( σιωπ -) αὐτὸς ( ὁ ) δὲ πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἔκραζεν υἱὲ Δ . ἐλέησόν με τί σοι θέλεις ποιήσω ( θ . π . σ .) κύριε ( ῥαββουνί Mark as usual) ἵνα ἀναβλέψω ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε .
