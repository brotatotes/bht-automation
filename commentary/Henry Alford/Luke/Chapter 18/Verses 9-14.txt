 9 14. ] THE PHARISEE AND THE PUBLICAN. This parable is spoken not  to the Pharisees, for our Lord would not in their presence have chosen a Pharisee as an example: nor  concerning the Pharisees, for then it would have been  no parable but to the people, and with reference to some among them (then and always)  τοὺς πεπ  .   ὅτι εἰσὶν δίκ  ., who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised other men.
	The parable describes an every day occurrence: the parabolic character is given by the concurrence and grouping of the two, and by the fact that each of these represents psychologically a class of persons.
