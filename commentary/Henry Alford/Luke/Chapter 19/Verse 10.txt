<b> 10.</b>] For, the greater sinner<br><br> sinner he may have been, the more does he come under the description of those (sheep) whom the good Shepherd came to<b> seek and save</b> (Matt. xv. 24).<br><br> Many modern Commentators maintain that the two parables represent one and the same: if so, we must at once give up, not only the pretensions to<i> historical</i> accuracy on the part of our Gospels (see ver. 11), but all idea that they furnish us with the words of our Lord any where:<i> for the whole structure and incidents of the two are essentially different.</i> If oral tradition thus varied before the Gospels were written, in<i> the report of our Lordâ€™s spoken words,</i> how can we know that He spoke<i> any thing which they relate?</i> If the Evangelists themselves<i> altered, arranged, and accommodated</i> those discourses, not only is the above the case, but their honesty is likewise impugned.<br><br> Besides, we shall here find the parable, in its very root and point of comparison,<i> individual and dis-tinct.</i> Compare throughout the notes on Matthew.
