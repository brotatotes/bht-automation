<b> 13. ten</b>] See on Matt. xxv. 1. The giving the<i><b> mina</b></i><i> to each,</i> is a totally different thing from giving to one<i> five,</i> to another<i> two,</i> and to a third<i> one</i> talent. The sums given are here all the<i> same,</i> and all<i> very small.</i> The (Attic) mina is, of a talent, and equal to about£3 of our money, In Matthew the man gives his whole<i> property</i> to his servants; here he makes trial of them with these small sums (<i> “a very little,”</i> see ver. 17).
