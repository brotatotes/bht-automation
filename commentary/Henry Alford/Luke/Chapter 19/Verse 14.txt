<b> 14.</b>] The nobleman, son of a king, literally,<b> one high born,</b> is the Lord Jesus; the kingdom is that over his own citizens, the Jews. They sent a message after Him; their cry went up to Heaven, in the persecutions of his servants, &c.;<b> we will not have this man to reign over us.</b> The parable has a double import: suited both to the disciples<i> (his own servants),</i> and the multitude<i> (his citizens).</i>
