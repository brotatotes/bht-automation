<b> 44.</b>] The verb rendered<i> shall lay thee even with the ground is used in two meanings:—shall level thy buildings to the foundation, and dash thy children against the ground.</i><br><br><b> thy children</b>] Not<i> infants</i> merely; the meaning is general.<br><br><b> Shall not leave in thee one stone upon another</b>]<br><br> see Matt. xxiv. 2 and note there.<br><br><i> ‘because of thy sins and rebellions;’</i>—t<b> hose might be all blotted out, hadst thou known, recognized, the time of thy visit by Me.</b><br><br><b> visitation</b> is a word of ambiguous meaning, either for good or for evil. It brings at once here before us the<i> coming seeking fruit,</i> ch. xiii. 7—and the<i> returning of the Lord of the vineyard,</i> ch. xx.<br><br> 16. It is however the first or favourable meaning of<i> visitation,</i> that is here prominent.
