<p><strong> 11 27.</strong> ] PARABLE OF THE MINÆ. <em> Peculiar to Luke</em> . By the introductory words, the parable must have been spoken <em> in the house of Zacchæus</em> , i.e. perhaps in the open room looking into the court, where probably many of the multitude were assembled.

<p>A parable very similar in some points to this was spoken by our Lord His last great prophetic discourse, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:14-30">Matthew 25:14-30</span> .
	</p>
<p>Many modern Commentators (Calv., Olsh., Meyer (on Matt.), but not Schleierm. or De Wette) maintain that the two parables represent one and the same: if so, we must at once give up, not only the pretensions to <em> historical</em> accuracy on the part of our Gospels, (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:11">Luke 19:11</span> ,) but all idea that they furnish us with the words of our Lord any where: for <em> the whole structure and incidents of the two are essentially different</em> . If oral tradition thus varied before the Gospels were written, <em> in the report of our Lord’s spoken words</em> , how can we know that He spoke <em> any thing which they relate?</em> If the Evangelists themselves <em> altered, arranged</em> , and <em> accommodated</em> those discourses, not only is the above the case, but their honesty is likewise impugned (see Prolegomena to Gospels). Besides, we shall here find the parable, in its very root and point of comparison, <em> individual and distinct</em> . Compare throughout the notes on Matt.</p>
