<b>{11}Christ the Lord]</b> This is the only place where these words come together. In ch. xxiii. 2 we have<i> “Christ a King,”</i> and in Acts ii. 36<i> “Lord and King.”</i> (In Col. iii. 24 we have, in a somewhat different meaning [said to servants], “<i>ye serve the Lord Christ</i>.”)<i></i> And I see no way of understanding this<b> Lord</b>, but as corresponding to the Hebrew JEHOVAH.
