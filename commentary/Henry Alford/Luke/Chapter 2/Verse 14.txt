<b> 14.]</b> It has been disputed whether<b> Glory to</b> means<b> There is</b>, or<b> Let there be, glory to God</b>. But there can be no doubt<i> that the sense of both these is included.</i><b> among men of good pleasure]</b> This reading is found in the greater part of the ancient authorities and Fathers, including the Alexandrine, Vatican, and Sinaitic MSS. It does not mean, as the Roman Catholic interpreters generally explain it,<i> “men of good will,”— “those that like it,”</i> which would be untenable in Greek as well as in theology. The only admissible rendering is, ‘<i>Among men of God’s good pleasure,</i>’ i.e. among the elect people of God.
