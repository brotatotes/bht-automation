It would then appear, either that<i> this</i><i> very enrolment took place under Quirinus,</i><br><br>—or that<i> the first</i> did so, and this was subsequent to it. Now<i> both of these senses</i> till recently seemed to be<i> inadmissible</i>. For Quirinus was not known to have been governor of Syria till the year of Rome 758, after the banishment of Archelaus, and the addition of his territory to the province of Syria. And the birth of our Lord occurred<i> at least eight years before this,</i> previous to Herod’s death, and when<i> Sentius Saturninus was governor of Syria</i>. But it has been made highly probable, by A.W. Zampt of Berlin, that Quirinus was TWICE governor of Syria. The substance of his researches is given at length in the note in my Greek Testament. The result of it is, that Zumpt fixes the time of his<i> first governorship</i> at from B.C. 4 to B.C. 1. It is true this does not quite remove our difficulty. But it brings it within such narrow limits, that any slight error in calculation, or even the latitude allowed by the words<b> was first made</b> might well cover it. I may mention it as remarkable, that Justin Martyr (Century 2) three times distinctly asserts that<i> our Lord was born under Quirinus</i>, and<i> appeals to the register then made</i>, as if from it the fact might, if necessary, be confirmed.<br><br> We conclude then, that an assessment or enrolment of names with a view to ascertain the population of the empire,<i> was commanded and put in force at this time</i>. It was unaccompanied (probably) by any payment of money. We know that Augustus drew up an account or<i> summary of the whole empire</i>, which took many years to arrange and complete, and of which the enrolment of the inhabitants of the provinces would naturally form a part. Of the data for this compilation, the enrolment in our text might be one.<br><br> That<i> Judæa was not a Roman province at this time,</i> is no objection to our text; for the compilation of Augustus contained the “<i>kingdoms</i>” of the Roman empire, as well as the provinces.
