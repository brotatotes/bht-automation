<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] HIS CIRCUMCISION. The second <strong> καί</strong> must not be rendered ‘ <em> also</em> .’ It is simply redundant, as in reff. The Lord was made like unto His brethren (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span> ; Heb 4:15 ) in all weakness and bodily infirmity, from which legal uncleanness arose. The body which He took on Him, though not a body of sin, was mortal, subject to the consequence of sin, in the likeness of sinful flesh: but incorruptible by the indwelling of the Godhead ( 1Pe 3:18 ). In the fulfilment therefore of His great work of redemption He became subject to legal rites and purifications not that they were absolutely <em> necessary</em> for <em> Him</em> , but were included in those things which were πρέποντα for Him in His humiliation and ‘making perfect:’ and in His lifting up of that human nature, <em> for which</em> all these things were <em> absolutely necessary</em> ( Gen 17:14 ), into the Godhead.</p>
