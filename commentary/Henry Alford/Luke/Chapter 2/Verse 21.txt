In the fulfillment therefore of His great work of redemption, He became subject to legal rites and purifications—not that they were absolutely<i> necessary</i> for<i> Him</i>, but were included in those things which were becoming for Him, in his humiliation and ‘making perfect:’ and in His lifting up of that human nature,<i> for which</i> all these things were<i> absolutely necessary</i> (Gen. xvii. 14), into the Godhead.
