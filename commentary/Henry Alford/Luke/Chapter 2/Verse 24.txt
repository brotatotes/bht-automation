<b> 24.]</b> The offering (ref. Lev.) was,<i> a lamb for a burnt-offering</i>,<i> and a pigeon for a sin-offering:</i> but if the parties were too poor to bring a lamb, then<i> two pigeons</i>. But we are not hereby justified in-assuming<i> extreme poverty</i> to have been the condition of our Lordâ€™s family. This nowhere appears Gospel history.
