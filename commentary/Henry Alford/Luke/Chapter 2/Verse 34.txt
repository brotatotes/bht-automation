 34. ]  κεῖται εἰς  , is appointed for see reff.: not (Meyer) ‘  lies here, in my arms .’
	 πτῶσιν  , as a stone of stumbling and rock of offence (Isaiah 8:14 ; Rom 9:33 ), at which they should fall through unbelief.
	 ἀνάστ  ., rising up in the sense of ch. Luk 1:52  by faith and holiness; or, the  πτῶσις and  ἀνάστ  . may refer to  the same persons; as it is said by our Lord, ‘He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.’ I prefer this last interpretation, as cohering best with the next verse: see note on it.
