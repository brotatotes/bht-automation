<b> 35.]</b> This prophecy I do not believe to have its chief reference to the<i> deep sorrows</i> of the mother of our Lord<i> on beholding His sufferings</i>, much less to her<i> future death by martyrdom;</i> least of all to the Crucifixion, which by shedding the blood of her Son, would also pierce her heart and drain it of its life-blood and make it childless. None of these interpretations satisfy us: for the words stand in a totally different connexion and one far worthier of the honor of that holy woman, and of the spiritual character of Symeonâ€™s prophecy: that prophecy is, of the struggle of many in Israel through repentance to faith in this Saviour; among which number even<i> His mother herself was to be included.</i> The sharp pangs of sorrow for sin must pierce her heart<i> also</i> (cf. esp. Acts ii. 37); and the general end follows;<i> that reasonings out of many hearts may be revealed;</i> that they who receive the Lord Jesus may be manifest, and they who reject Him: see John ix. 39. We may find moreover, in the traces of her connexion with our Lord in the Evangelic history, the piercing and dividing of her soul, and in the last notice of her in Acts i., the triumph of her faith after the Ascension.
