<b> 39.]</b> Certainly the obvious inference from this verse is, that Joseph and Mary returned from Jerusalem to Nazareth direct. But it is only an<i> inference</i>, and not the assertion of the text. This part of the Gospel History is one where the Harmonists, by their arbitrary reconcilements of the two Evangelistic accounts, have given great advantage to the enemies the<br><br> faith.<i> As the two accounts now stand</i>, it is wholly impossible to suggest any satisfactory method of<i> uniting them;</i> every one who has attempted it has, in some part or other of his hypothesis, violated probability and common sense. But, on the other hand, it is equally impossible definitely to say, that they<i> could not</i> be reconciled by<i> a thorough knowledge of the facts themselves;</i> and such an assertion, whenever made, shews great ignorance of the origin and course of oral narration. How many things will a relator say, being unaware of certain important circumstances outside his narrative,<i> which seem to preclude</i> those circumstances? How often will points of time be apparently brought close together in such a narration,—between which, events most weighty to the history have occurred? The<i> only</i> inference these two accounts, which<i> is inevitable</i>, is, that they are<i> wholly</i><i> independent</i> of one another. If St. Luke had seen the Gospel of St. Matthew, or vice versâ, then the variations are<i> utterly</i><i> inexplicable;</i> and the greatest absurdities of all are involved in the writings of those who<i> assume this</i>, and<i> then proceed</i><i> to harmonize</i>. Of the dwelling at Nazareth before the Nativity, of the circumstances which brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem, of the Presentation in the temple, St. Matthew’s account knows nothing; of the visit of the Magi, the murder of the Innocents, the flight to Egypt, St. Luke’s is unaware. In all the main circumstances of the Conception and Nativity<i> they agree, or are easily and naturally</i> reconciled (see further in note on John vii. 42).
