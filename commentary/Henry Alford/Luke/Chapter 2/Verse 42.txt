<b> 42.]</b> At the age of twelve, a boy was called by the Jews<i> ‘son of the law,’</i> and first incurred legal obligation. At that time, then, commences the<i> second step</i> (see note on ver. 52) of the life of the Lord, the time when the<i> things becoming</i> for Him began; his course of blameless legal obedience (see note on ver. 21) in his own person and by his own will. Now first (ver. 49) appear those higher consciousnesses to have found expression, which unfolded within Him, till the fall time of his public ministry arrived. It cannot be inferred from this narrative, that it was the<i> first time</i> the holy Child had accompanied them to the Passover.
