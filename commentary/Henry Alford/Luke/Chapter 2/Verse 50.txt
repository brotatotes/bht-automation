they understood not]</b> Both Joseph and His mother knew<i> in some sense</i>,<i> Who</i> He was: but were not prepared to hear<i> so direct an appeal</i> to God as His Father: understood not the deeper sense of these wonderful words. Still (ver. 51) they appear to have awakened in the mind of His mother a remembrance of<i> “He shall be called the Son of God,”</i> ch. i. 35. And probably, as Stier remarks, the unfolding of His childhood had been so gradual and natural, that even they had not been forcibly reminded by any strong individual notes, of that which He was, and which now shewed itself.<br><br> It is a remarkable instance of the blindness of the rationalistic Commentators to the richness and depth of Scripture narrative, that they hold this<b> understood</b><b> not</b> to be altogether inconceivable, as coming after the angelic announcement to Mary. Can they suppose that she<i> understood</i> that announcement itself? The right interpretation is,<i> they understood not the deeper sense:</i> see ch. xviii. 34.
