<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] Now that <strong> πρωτότοκον</strong> has disappeared from the text of St. Matthew [ Luk 1:25 ], it must be here remarked, that although the term may undoubtedly be used of an only child, such use is necessarily always connected with the expectation of others to follow, and can no longer have place when the whole course of events is before the writer and no others <em> have followed</em> . The combination of this consideration with the fact that brethren of our Lord are brought forward in this Gospel in close connexion with His mother, makes it as certain as any implied fact can be, that those brethren were the children of Mary herself.

<p>Ancient tradition states the birthplace of our Lord to have been a <em> cave:</em> thus Justin Martyr, Dial. 78, p. 175, ἐπειδὴ Ἰωσὴφ οὐκ εἶχεν ἐν τῇ κώμῃ ἐκείνῃ ποῦ καταλῦσαι , ἐν <strong> σπηλαίῳ τινὶ</strong> σύνεγγυς τῆς κώμης κατέλυσε · καὶ τότε , ὄντων αὐτῶν ἐκεῖ , ἐτετόκει ἡ Μαρία τὸν χριστόν , καὶ ἐν φάτνῃ αὐτὸν ἐτεθείκει . And Origen, against Celsus, i. 51, p. 367: ἀκολούθως τῇ ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ περὶ τῆς γενέσεως αὐτοῦ ἱστορίᾳ δείκνυται <strong> τὸ ἐν Βηθλεὲμ σπήλαιον</strong> ἔνθα ἐγεννήθη , καὶ ἡ ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ φάτνη ἔνθα ἐσπαργανώθη . Similarly Eusebius, Athanasius, and others. This tradition is nowise inconsistent with our text for caves are used in most rocky countries as stables. Bleek has noticed that Justin Martyr refers to a prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+33:16">Isaiah 33:16</span> ( οὗτος οἰκήσει ἐν ὑψηλῷ σπηλαίῳ πέτρας ἰσχυρᾶς , LXX), and is disposed to think with Calov., alli [18] ., that the tradition may have arisen from this. But is not the converse much more likely?

<p><strong> καταλύματι</strong> <strong> , a public inn,</strong> or place of reception for travellers; not ‘ <em> a room</em> in a private house,’ for then the expression would be, ‘They found no κατάλυμα .’ Of what sort this inn was, does not appear. It probably differs from πανδοχεῖον , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:34">Luke 10:34</span> , in not being kept by an host, πανδοχεύς : see note there.</p>
