 3 5. ] There is a mixture here of Roman and Jewish customs, which is not at all improbable, considering the circumstances. In the Roman census, men, women, and children were all obliged to go and be enrolled. Dion. Hal. iv. 15, ἃπαντας ἐκέλευσε ( ὁ Τύλλιος ) τοὺς ὁμοπάγους κατὰ κεφαλὴν ὡρισμένον νόμισμά τι συνεισφέρειν , ἕτερον μέν τι τοὺς ἄνδρας , ἕτερον δέ τι τὰς γυναῖκας , ἄλλο δέ τι τοὺς ἀνήβους . But then this census was made at their  dwelling-place , not at that of their  extraction . The latter practice springs from the Jewish genealogical habits, and its adoption in this case  speaks strongly for the accuracy of the chronology . If this enrolment was by order of Augustus, and for the whole empire, it of course would be made so as to include  all , after the Roman manner: but inasmuch as it was made  under the Jewish king Herod , it was done  after the Jewish manner , in taking this account of each  at his own place of extraction .
	Mary being apparently  herself sprung from the lineage of David (see ch. Luk 1:32 ), might on this account go to Bethlehem, being, as some suppose, an inheritress; but this does not seem to be the Evangelist’s meaning, but that, after the Roman manner, she  accompanied her husband .
	No stress must be laid on  ἐμνηστ  ., as if she were  only the  betrothed wife of Joseph at this time; she had been taken to his house before this: the history in our text happening during the time indicated by Matthew 1:25 .
