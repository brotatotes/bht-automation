<b> 20.</b>] Spies: literally,<b> men suborned,</b><i> instructed and arranged for that purpose.</i><br><br><b> that they might....</b>]<i> they,</i> not the spies, but the chief priests.<br><br> The A.V., in rendering<b> his words,</b> has mistaken the construction of the clause. It is,<b> that they might lay hold of him by some saying;</b><i> “catch him by a word,”</i> as St. Mark. unto the ruling (Roman)<b> power</b> (genus),<b> unto the authority of the governor</b> (species). The form of the sentence in the original renders the separation of the two necessary.
