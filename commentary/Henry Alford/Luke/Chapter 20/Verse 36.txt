 36. ] The  ἰσάγγ  .   γάρ εἰσιν is alleged, not as shewing them to be ἀπαθεῖς κ . ἀφιλήδονοι (Euthym [108] ), but as setting forth their  immortality .
	 [108] Euthymius Zigabenus, 1116
	 υἱοὶ θ  . is here used, not in its  ethical sense , as applied to believers in this world, but its  metaphysical sense , as denoting the  essential state of the blessed after the resurrection: ‘they are, by their resurrection,  essentially partakers of the divine nature, and so cannot die.’ When Meyer says that the Lord  only speaks of the  risen , and has not here in His view the ‘quick’ at the time of His coming, it must be remembered that the ‘change’ which shall pass on them ( 1Co 15:51-54 ) shall put them into precisely the same ἀφθαρσία as the risen (compare ibid. Luk 20:42 ).
