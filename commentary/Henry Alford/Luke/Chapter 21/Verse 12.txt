<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] Why the words <strong> πρὸ δὲ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> π</strong> <strong> .</strong> should have made any difficulty, I am at a loss to imagine. The prophecies of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:7-8">Matthew 24:7-8</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:8">Mark 13:8</span> , and Luk 21:10-11 here, are a parenthetical warning of what shall happen <em> before the</em> <strong> τέλος</strong> <strong> .</strong> And then having stated, ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων ταῦτα , these things shall be the <em> very beginning of the actual pangs themselves</em> (see note on Matt.), the prophetic chronology is resumed from οὔπω τὸ τέλος in all three accounts; here, by distinct statement, πρὸ δὲ τούτων πάντων : in Mark by implication, βλέπετε δὲ ὑμ . ἑαυ . παρ . ὑμ ., by which δέ , the following words are thrown back to the βλέπετε before: in Matthew by the gathering up of the parenthetical announcements as πάντα ταῦτα , and thus casting them off, as the ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων belonging to the τέλος , before the discourse proceeds with the <strong> τότε</strong> taken up from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:6">Luke 21:6</span> . The whole difficulty has arisen from not rightly apprehending the force of <strong> ὠδίνων</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <em> as the death-throes of the end</em> .</p>
