 12. ] Why the words  πρὸ δὲ τ  .   π  . should have made any difficulty, I am at a loss to imagine. The prophecies of Matthew 24:7-8 , Mark 13:8 , and Luk 21:10-11 here, are a parenthetical warning of what shall happen  before the  τέλος  . And then having stated, ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων ταῦτα , these things shall be the  very beginning of the actual pangs themselves (see note on Matt.), the prophetic chronology is resumed from οὔπω τὸ τέλος in all three accounts; here, by distinct statement, πρὸ δὲ τούτων πάντων : in Mark by implication, βλέπετε δὲ ὑμ . ἑαυ . παρ . ὑμ ., by which δέ , the following words are thrown back to the βλέπετε before: in Matthew by the gathering up of the parenthetical announcements as πάντα ταῦτα , and thus casting them off, as the ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων belonging to the τέλος , before the discourse proceeds with the  τότε taken up from Luke 21:6 . The whole difficulty has arisen from not rightly apprehending the force of  ὠδίνων  ,  as the death-throes of the end .
