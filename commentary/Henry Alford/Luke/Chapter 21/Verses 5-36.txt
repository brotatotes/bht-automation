 5 36. ] PROPHECY OF HIS COMING, AND OF THE TIMES OF THE END. Matthew 24:1-51 ( Mat 25:1-46 ). Mark 13:1-37 . See notes on both, but especially on Matt. Meyer says truly in loc. that there is no trace in Luke of the discourse being delivered on  the Mount of Olives but he adds, that it belongs to the discourses  in the temple , which begin ch. Luke 20:1 , and that therefore Luke alone mentions ἀναθήματα . He seems to have overlooked the  break at Luke 21:7 , corresponding to the change of scene. All three speak of the  opening incident as happening while He was departing from the temple; and Matt. and Mark, of the enquiry being made  afterwards , on the Mount of Olives, i.e. in the evening, when He had retired thither ( Luk 21:37 ).
