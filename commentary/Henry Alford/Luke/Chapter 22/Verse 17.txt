 17. ] Some (e.g. De Wette) suppose that it is here implied that our Lord  did not drink of the cup Himself . But surely this cannot be so. The two members of the speech are strictly parallel: and if He desired to  eat the Passover with them, He would also  drink of the cup , which formed a usual part of the ceremonial. This seems to me to be implied in  δεξάμενος  : λαβών is the word used by all  afterwards , when He did  not partake of the bread and wine. This most important addition in our narrative, amounts I believe to a solemn declaration of the  fulfilment of the Passover rite , in both its usual divisions, the eating the flesh of the lamb, and drinking the cup of thanksgiving. Henceforward, He who fulfilled the Law for man will no more eat and drink of it. I remark this, in order further to observe that  this division of the cup is not only not  identical with , but has  no reference to , the subsequent one in Luke 22:20 . That was the  institution of a new rite; this the  abrogation  of an old one , now fulfilled, or about to be so, in the person of the true Lamb of God.
	This is generally supposed to have been the  first cup in the Passover-meal, with which the whole was introduced.
	On the possible connexion of this speech of our Lord with the celebration of the Passover at this particular time, see note on Matthew 26:17 .
	After these verses, in order of time, follows  the washing of the disciples’ feet in John 13:1-20 , referred to in our Luke 22:27 .
