<b> 25.</b>] See on Matt. xx. 25. The expression<b> here they that exercise authority upon</b> (over)<b> them are called benefactors,</b> also seems to be connected with what had just taken place. ‘Among<i> them,</i> the<i> benefactors</i> are those who<i> exercise authority—</i>but among<i> you,</i> I, your<i> benefactor</i> (see vv. 19, 20),<i> do not so,</i> but am in the midst of you as your servant.’ Ptolemy Euergetes (the benefactor) at once occurs to us;—numerous other examples are given by Wetstein.
