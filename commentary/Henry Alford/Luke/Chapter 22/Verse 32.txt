<b> 32. but I have prayed for thee</b>] As Peter was the foremost (the rest are here addressed through him), so he was in the greatest danger. It must not be supposed that our Lord’s prayer was not heard, because Peter’s faith<i> did fail,</i> in his denial; this word<b> fail</b> here implies a<i> total extinction,</i> which Peter's faith<i> did not suffer.</i> Though the<b> you all</b> included Judas, he is not included in the<i> prayer</i>; see John xvii. 6–12. We may notice here, that our Lord speaks of the total failure of even an<i> Apostle’s faith,</i> as<i> possible.</i><br><br><b> when thou hast turned again</b>] There can, I think, be little doubt that this word is here used in the general N.T. sense, of<i> returning as a penitent after</i> sin, turning to God,—and not in the almost expletive meaning which it has in such passages as Joel ii. 14; Acts vii. 42.<b> strengthen</b> (or<b> confirm</b>)] The use of this word, and the cognate substantive,<i> thrice by St. Peter in his two epistles,</i> 1 Pet. v. 10; 2 Pet. i. 12; iii. 17, and in the first passage in a connexion with the mention of<i> Satan’s temptations,</i> is remarkable.
