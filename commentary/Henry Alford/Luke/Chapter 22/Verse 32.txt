<b> 32. but I have prayed for thee</b>] As Peter was the foremost (the rest are here addressed through him), so he was in the greatest danger. It must not be supposed that our Lord’s prayer was not heard, because Peter’s faith<i> did fail,</i> in his denial; this word<b> fail</b> here implies a<i> total extinction,</i> which Peter's faith<i> did not suffer.</i> Though the<b> you all</b> included Judas, he is not included in the<i> prayer</i>; see John xvii. 6–12. We may notice here, that our Lord speaks of the total failure of even an<i> Apostle’s faith,</i> as<i> possible.</i>
