<p><strong> 32.</strong> ] <strong> ἐγὼ δὲ ἐδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> π</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σοῦ</strong> ] As Peter was the <em> foremost</em> (the rest are here addressed through him), so he was in the greatest danger. It must not be supposed that our Lord’s prayer was not heard, because Peter’s faith <em> did fail</em> , in his denial; <strong> ἐκλίπῃ</strong> implies a <em> total extinction</em> which Peter’s faith <em> did not suffer</em> .
	</p>
<p>Though the <strong> ὑμᾶς</strong> included Judas, he is not included in the <em> prayer:</em> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:6-12">John 17:6-12</span> . We may notice here, that our Lord speaks of the total failure of <em> even an Apostle’s faith</em> , as <em> possible</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐπιστρέψας</strong> ] There can, I think, be little doubt that this word is here used in the general N.T. sense, of <em> returning as a penitent</em> after sin, turning to God; and not in the almost expletive meaning which it has in such passages as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+84:6">Psalms 84:6</span> , ὁ θεός , σὺ ἐπιστρέψας ζωώσεις ἡμᾶς (although even here it may have a somewhat similar sense to the above see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:14">Joel 2:14</span> ; Act 7:42 ).
	</p>
<p><strong> στήρισον</strong> ] The use of this word and the cognate substantive <em> thrice by Peter in his two epistles</em> (see reff.), and in the first passage in a connexion with the mention of <em> Satan’s temptations</em> , is remarkable.</p>
