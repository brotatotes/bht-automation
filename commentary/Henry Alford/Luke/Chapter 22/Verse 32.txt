 32. ]  ἐγὼ δὲ ἐδ  .   π  .   σοῦ ] As Peter was the  foremost (the rest are here addressed through him), so he was in the greatest danger. It must not be supposed that our Lord’s prayer was not heard, because Peter’s faith  did fail , in his denial;  ἐκλίπῃ implies a  total extinction which Peter’s faith  did not suffer .
	Though the  ὑμᾶς included Judas, he is not included in the  prayer: see John 17:6-12 . We may notice here, that our Lord speaks of the total failure of  even an Apostle’s faith , as  possible .
	 ἐπιστρέψας ] There can, I think, be little doubt that this word is here used in the general N.T. sense, of  returning as a penitent after sin, turning to God; and not in the almost expletive meaning which it has in such passages as Psalms 84:6 , ὁ θεός , σὺ ἐπιστρέψας ζωώσεις ἡμᾶς (although even here it may have a somewhat similar sense to the above see Joel 2:14 ; Act 7:42 ).
	 στήρισον ] The use of this word and the cognate substantive  thrice by Peter in his two epistles (see reff.), and in the first passage in a connexion with the mention of  Satan’s temptations , is remarkable.
