This is the only place in the Gospels where our Lord addresses Peter by the name peter. And it is remarkable, as occurring in the very place where He firewarns him of his approaching denial of Himself.<br><br> The meaning of our Lord in this much-controverted passage appears to be, to<i> forewarn the Apostles of the outward dangers which will await them henceforward</i><i> in their mission</i>:—unlike the time when He sent them forth without earthly appliances, upheld by His special Providence, they must now make use of common resources for sustenance, yea, and even of the sword itself for defence.
