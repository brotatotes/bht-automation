 36. ]  αἴρειν was the very word used in the prohibition before.
	There is a question what should be supplied after  μὴ ἔχων  . Very many authorities make μάχαιραν understood (as in E. V.); but the simpler construction and better sense is to place μὴ ἔχων in contrast with ἔχων ,  he who has a purse, &c.,  and he who has none, let him &c., see reff. Thus the sense will be complete for he who  has a purse , can buy a sword,  without selling his garment .
	 μάχαιρα must be here used in the sense of  a sword, compare Luke 22:49 : and not a  knife to eat with , which some have understood. The ‘sword of the Spirit’ (Olshausen and others) is  wholly out of the question . The saying is both a description to them of their altered situation with reference to the world without, and a declaration that self-defence and self-provision would henceforward be necessary. It forms a  decisive testimony, from the mouth of the Lord Himself, against the views of the Quakers and some other sects on these points . But it does not warrant  aggression by Christians, nor, as some R. Catholics (see the bull “Unam sanctam” of Boniface VIII., cited in Wordsw. ad loc.),  spreading the gospel by the sword .
