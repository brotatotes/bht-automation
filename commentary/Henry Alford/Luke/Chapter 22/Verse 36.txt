<b> 36.</b>]<b> take</b> was the very word used in the prohibition before. There is a question how this sentence, which is elliptical in the original, should be filled up. Very many authorities make a<i> sword</i> understood after<i> “hath not”</i> (as in A.V.);—but the simpler construction and better sense is to place<b> hath not</b> in contrast with<b> hath, He that hath a purse, &c., and he that hath none, let him, &c.</b> Thus the sense will be complete,—for he who<i> has a purse,</i> can buy a sword,<i> without selling his garment.</i> The ‘sword of the Spirit’ (Olshausen and others)<i> is wholly out of the question</i> in interpreting this command. The saying is both a description to them of their altered situation with reference to the world without, and a declaration that self-defence and self-provision would henceforward be necessary. It forms a<i> decisive testimony, from the mouth of the Lord Himself, against the views of the Quakers and some other sects on these points.</i> But it does not warrant<i> aggression</i> by Christians, nor, as some R. Catholics,<i> spreading the Gospel the sword.</i>
