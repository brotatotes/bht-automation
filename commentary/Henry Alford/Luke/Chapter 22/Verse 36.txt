<p><strong> 36.</strong> ] <strong> αἴρειν</strong> was the very word used in the prohibition before.

<p>There is a question what should be supplied after <strong> μὴ ἔχων</strong> <strong> .</strong> Very many authorities make μάχαιραν understood (as in E. V.); but the simpler construction and better sense is to place μὴ ἔχων in contrast with ἔχων , <strong> he who has a purse,</strong> &amp;c., <strong> and he who has none, let him</strong> &amp;c., see reff. Thus the sense will be complete for he who <em> has a purse</em> , can buy a sword, <em> without selling his garment</em> .

<p><strong> μάχαιρα</strong> must be here used in the sense of <strong> a sword,</strong> compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:49">Luke 22:49</span> : and not a <em> knife to eat with</em> , which some have understood. The ‘sword of the Spirit’ (Olshausen and others) is <em> wholly out of the question</em> . The saying is both a description to them of their altered situation with reference to the world without, and a declaration that self-defence and self-provision would henceforward be necessary. It forms a <em> decisive testimony, from the mouth of the Lord Himself, against the views of the Quakers and some other sects on these points</em> . But it does not warrant <em> aggression</em> by Christians, nor, as some R. Catholics (see the bull “Unam sanctam” of Boniface VIII., cited in Wordsw. ad loc.), <em> spreading the gospel by the sword</em> .</p>
