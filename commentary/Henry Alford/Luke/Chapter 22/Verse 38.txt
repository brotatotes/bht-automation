The road from Jericho to Jerusalem (see ch. Luk 10:30 ) was much infested with robbers; and it was the custom for the priests, and even the quiet and ascetic Essenes, to  carry weapons when travelling. Chrysostom (Hom. in Matt. lxxxiv. vol. vii. p. 797) gives a curious explanation of the two swords: εἰκὸς οὖν καὶ μαχαίρας εἶναι ἐκεῖ διὰ τὸ ἀρνίον .
