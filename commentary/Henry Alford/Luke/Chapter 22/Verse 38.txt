<b> 38.</b>] Two of them were armed,—either from excess of zeal to defend Him, excited by His announcement of His sufferings during this feast,—or, perhaps because they had brought their weapons from Galilee as protection by the way. The road from Jericho to Jerusalem (see ch. x. 30) was much infested with robbers;—and it was the custom for the priests, and even for the quiet and ascetic Essenes, to<i> carry weapons</i> when travelling. Chrysostom gives a curious explanation of the two swords,—that it was probable they had knives to cut up the Paschal lamb. This certainly agrees with the number of the disciples sent to get ready the Passover: but it has nothing else to recommend it. They exhibit their swords, misunderstanding His words, and supposing them to apply to that night. Our Lord breaks off the matter with<b> It is enough,</b>—not<i> ‘they are sufficient;’</i>—but,<b> It is well,—we are sufficiently provided—</b> ‘it was not to this that My words referred.’ The rebuke is parallel with, though milder than, the one in Mark viii. 17,—as the misunderstanding was somewhat similar.
