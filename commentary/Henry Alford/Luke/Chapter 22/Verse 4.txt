The Levitical guard of the temple would be consulted, because, it had been of late especially<i> in the temple</i> that our Lord had become obnoxious to them (see ver. 53 and ch. xxi. 37, 38). The words<b> covenanted</b> and<b> promised</b> here seem clearly to imply that the money was<i> not now paid, but afterwards,</i> when the treachery was accomplished;â€”see note on Matt. xxvi. 15.<br><br> The concluding words of the verse may bear either the meaning in the text or that in the margin.
