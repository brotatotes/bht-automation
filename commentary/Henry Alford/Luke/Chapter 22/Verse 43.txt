<b> 43.</b>] With the early and weighty evidence cited in my Gr. Test. in favour of verses 43, 44, it is impossible that they should have been an apocryphal insertion. The was perhaps expunged by the orthodox, who imagined they found in it an inconsistency with the divine nature of our Lord. We have reason to be thankful, that orthodoxy has been better understood since. The strengthening by means of the angel is<i> physical—</i>and the appearance likewise. It is strange how Olshausen can have so far deceived himself as to imagine that<b> appeared unto him</b> can imply a merely inward and spiritual accession of strength from above. It is strange likewise that the analogy of the ministration of angles in the Lord’s former temptation should not have occurred to those modern Commentators who have objected to this circumstance as improbable.<br><br> This strengthening probably took place<i> between the first and the second prayer;—</i>and the effect of it is, that<b> He</b><b> prayed more earnestly,</b> ver. 44, and arrived at the entire resignation expressed in the second and third Payer of St. Matthew’s narrative.
