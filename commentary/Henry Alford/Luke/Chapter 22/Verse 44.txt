<p><strong> 44.</strong> ] The intention of the Evangelist seems clearly to be, to convey the idea that the sweat was (not <em> fell</em> like, but <em> was</em> ) <em> like drops of blood;</em> i.e. <em> coloured with blood</em> , for so I understand the ὡσεί , as just distinguishing the drops <em> highly coloured with blood</em> , from <em> pure blood</em> . Aristotle, speaking of certain morbid states of the blood, says, ἐξυγραινομένου δὲ λίαν νοσοῦσιν · γίνεται γὰρ ἰχωροειδές , καὶ διοῤῥοῦται , οὕτως ὥστε ἤδη τινὲς <strong> ἴδισαν αἱματώδη ἱδρῶτα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> Hist. Anim. iii. 19. To suppose that it only <em> fell like drops of blood</em> (why not drops of any thing else? and drops of blood <em> from what</em> , and <em> where?</em> ) is to nullify the force of the sentence, and make the insertion of αἵματος not only superfluous but absurd.

<p>We must not forget, in asking on what testimony this rests, that the marks of such drops would be visible after the termination of the agony. An interesting example of a sweat of blood under circumstances of strong terror, accompanied by loss of speech, is given in an article by Dr. Schneider in Casper’s Wochenschrift for 1848: and cited in the Medical Gazette for December of that year.</p>
