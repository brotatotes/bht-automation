<b> 44.</b>] The intention of the Evangelist seems clearly to be, to convey the idea that the<b> sweat was</b> (not<i> fell</i> like, but<i> was</i>)<i> like drops of blood;</i>—i. e.<i> coloured with blood,</i>—for so I understand the<b> as it were,</b> as just distinguishing the drops<i> highly coloured with blood,</i> from<i> pure blood.</i> Aristotle, speaking of certain morbid states of the blood, says, “when the blood is watery, grievous disease ensues: for it becomes serous and milky, to such an extent that some have been known to<i> perspire a bloody sweat.”</i> To suppose that it only<i> fell like drops of blood</i> (why not drops of any thing else? and drops of blood<i> from</i><i> what,</i> and<i> where?</i>) is to nullify the force of the sentence.<br><br> We must not forget, in asking on what testimony this rests, that the marks of such drops would be visible after the termination of the agony. An interesting example of a sweat of blood under circumstances of strong terror, accompanied loss of speech, is cited in the Medical Gazette for December, 1848. It occurred in the case of certain Norwegian sailors in a tremendous storm.
