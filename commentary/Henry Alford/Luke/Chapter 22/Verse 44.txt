 44. ] The intention of the Evangelist seems clearly to be, to convey the idea that the sweat was (not  fell like, but  was )  like drops of blood; i.e.  coloured with blood , for so I understand the ὡσεί , as just distinguishing the drops  highly coloured with blood , from  pure blood . Aristotle, speaking of certain morbid states of the blood, says, ἐξυγραινομένου δὲ λίαν νοσοῦσιν · γίνεται γὰρ ἰχωροειδές , καὶ διοῤῥοῦται , οὕτως ὥστε ἤδη τινὲς  ἴδισαν αἱματώδη ἱδρῶτα  , Hist. Anim. iii. 19. To suppose that it only  fell like drops of blood (why not drops of any thing else? and drops of blood  from what , and  where? ) is to nullify the force of the sentence, and make the insertion of αἵματος not only superfluous but absurd.
	We must not forget, in asking on what testimony this rests, that the marks of such drops would be visible after the termination of the agony. An interesting example of a sweat of blood under circumstances of strong terror, accompanied by loss of speech, is given in an article by Dr. Schneider in Casper’s Wochenschrift for 1848: and cited in the Medical Gazette for December of that year.
