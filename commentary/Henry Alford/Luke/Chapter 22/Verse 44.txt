<b> 44.</b>] The intention of the Evangelist seems clearly to be, to convey the idea that the<b> sweat was</b> (not<i> fell</i> like, but<i> was</i>)<i> like drops of blood;</i>—i. e.<i> coloured with blood,</i>—for so I understand the<b> as it were,</b> as just distinguishing the drops<i> highly coloured with blood,</i> from<i> pure blood.</i> Aristotle, speaking of certain morbid states of the blood, says, “when the blood is watery, grievous disease ensues: for it becomes serous and milky, to such an extent that some have been known to<i> perspire a bloody sweat.”</i> To suppose that it only<i> fell like drops of blood</i> (why not drops of any thing else? and drops of blood<i> from</i><i> what,</i> and<i> where?</i>) is to nullify the force of the sentence.
