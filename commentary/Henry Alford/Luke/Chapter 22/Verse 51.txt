<b> 51.</b>]<b> Suffer ye thus far</b> I understand as addressed, not to the disciples, but to the multitude, or rather<i> to those who were holding Him;</i>—His hands were held,—and<b> He says, Suffer, permit me, thus far:</b> i.e. to touch the ear of the wounded person. If this interpretation be correct, it furnishes an additional token of the truthfulness of our narrative; for the previous laying hold of Jesus has not been mentioned here, but in Matthew (ver. 50) and Mark (ver. 46).
