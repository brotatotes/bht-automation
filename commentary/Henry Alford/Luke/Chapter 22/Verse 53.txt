<b> 53.</b>] There is an important addition here to the other reports of our Lord’s speech;—<b>but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</b> It stands here instead of the declaration that<i> this was done that the Scriptures might be fulfilled</i> (Matthew, ver. 66: Mark, ver. 49). The inner sense of those words is indeed implied here—but we cannot venture to<b> say</b> that our report is of the same saying,<br><br> Our Lord here distinguishes between the power exercised over Him by<i> men,</i> and that by<i> the Evil One:</i>—but so as to make the<i> power</i> which rules over them to be that of darkness—while His own assertion of this shews that all was by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. In the word<b> darkness</b> there is also an allusion to the time—midnight. Compare with this declaration of the power of darkness over Him, the declaration, in ch. iv. 13, that the devil left Him<i> “for a season.”</i>
