<p><strong> 53.</strong> ] There is an important addition here to the other reports of our Lord’s speech; <strong> ἀλλὰ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> σκότους</strong> <strong> .</strong> It stands here instead of the declaration that <em> this was done that the Scriptures might be fulfilled</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:56">Matthew 26:56</span> : Mar 14:49 ). The inner sense of those words is indeed implied here but we cannot venture to say that our report is of the same saying.
	</p>
<p>Our Lord here distinguishes between the power exercised over Him by <em> men</em> , and that by <em> the Evil One:</em> but so as to make the ἐξουσία which rules over <em> them</em> to be that of darkness while His own assertion of this shews that all was by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. In the word <strong> σκότος</strong> there is also an allusion to the time midnight. Compare with this declaration of the power of darkness over Him, the declaration, in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:13">Luke 4:13</span> , that the devil left Him ἄχρι καιροῦ .</p>
