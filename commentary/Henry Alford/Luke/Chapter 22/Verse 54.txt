 54. ] Matthew 26:57 . Mark 14:53 . Joh 18:13 . Our narrative leaves it undecided  who this high-priest was , inasmuch as, ch. Luke 3:2 ,  Annas and Caiaphas are mentioned as high-priests. From John we find that it was  Annas; who having questioned Jesus, sent Him bound to Caiaphas, before whom His trial took place. Luke omits this trial altogether or perhaps gives the substance of it in the account ( Luk 22:66-71 ) of the morning assembly of the Sanhedrim. See notes on Matt.
