<b> 61.</b>] See extract from Robinson’s notes on Matthew, ver. 69. If, as there supposed, the trail was going on<i> in an open chamber looking on the court,</i> the look might well have been given from a considerable distance.<i> We</i> need not enquire,<i> how</i> our Lord could hear what<b> was</b> going on round the fire in the court, as some Commentators have done. But even were such an enquiry necessary, I see no difficulty in answering it. The anathemas of Peter, spoken to<i> those who stood by</i> with vehemence and the crowing of the cock,—were not these audible? But our Lord needed not these to attract His attention.
