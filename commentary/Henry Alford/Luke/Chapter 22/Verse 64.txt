<b> 64.</b>] Matt. xxvi. 57. Mark xiv. 53. John xviii. 13. Our narrative leaves it undecided<i> who this high priest was,</i> inasmuch as, ch. iii, 2,<i> Annas and Caiaphas</i> are mentioned as high priests. From St. John we find that it<i> was Annas;</i> who having questioned Jesus, sent Him bound to Caiaphas, before whom His trial took place. St. Luke omits this trial altogether—or perhaps gives the substance of it in the account (vv. 66–71) of the morning assembly of the Sanhedrim. See notes on Matthew.
