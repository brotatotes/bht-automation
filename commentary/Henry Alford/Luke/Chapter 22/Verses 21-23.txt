 21 23. ] ANNOUNCEMENT OF A BETRAYER. See notes on Matthew 26:20-25 . I would not venture absolutely to maintain that this announcement is  identical with that one; but I own the arguments of Stier and others to prove them distinct, fail to convince me. The expression  πλὴν ἰδού bears marks of verbal accuracy, and inclines us to believe that this announcement was made  after the institution of the cup , as here related. ‘Notwithstanding this My declaration of love, in giving My Body and Blood for you, there is one here present who shall betray Me.’
	 ἐπὶ τ  .   τρ  ., viz. in dipping into the dish with the Lord.
	 πορεύεται ] A somewhat similar πορεύεσθαι to this occurs ch. Luke 13:33 ; but that is used of our Lord’s ministerial progress; this of His progress through suffering to glory.
