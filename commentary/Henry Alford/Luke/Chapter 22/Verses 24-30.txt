<p><strong> 24 30.</strong> ] DISPUTE FOR PRE-EMINENCE. OUR LORD’S REPLY. Without attempting to decide the question whether this incident is strictly narrated in order of time, or identical with one of those strifes on this point related <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:1">Matthew 18:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:20">Matthew 20:20</span> , I will offer one or two remarks on it as it here stands. (1) Its having happened at this time is not altogether unaccountable. They had been just enquiring <em> among themselves</em> ( Luk 22:23 ), <em> who among them should do this thing</em> . May it not reasonably be supposed, that some of them (Judas <em> at least</em> ) would be anxiously employed in <em> self-justification</em> , and that this would lead, in some part of the table, to a dispute of the kind here introduced? The natural effect of the Lord’s rebuke would be to give rise to a different spirit among them, and the question “ <em> Lord, is it I?</em> ” may have been the offspring of this better mind; but see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:20-25">Matthew 26:20-25</span> . (2) It is surprising to find the very declaration of our Lord on the former strife related in this Gospel (ch. Luk 9:46-48 ), repeated as having been made <em> at this Paschal meal</em> , by John ( Joh 13:20 ). May not this lead us to suppose that there has been a transposition of some of the circumstances regarding these various contentions among the Apostles, and that these words occurring in John may possibly <em> point to a strife of this kind?</em> (3) The ἐγώ εἰμι ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν ὡς ὁ διακονῶν is too clear an allusion to the <em> washing of their feet by the Lord</em> , to have escaped even those Commentators who are slow to discern such hints (e.g. De Wette). The appeal, if <em> it had taken place</em> , is natural and intelligible; but not otherwise. (4) The diction is repeatedly allusive to their <em> then</em> employment: ἀνακείμενος διατίθεμαι ἔσθειν καὶ πίνειν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου all these have reference to things present, or words spoken, during that meal.
	</p>
<p>I therefore infer that the strife <em> did happen at this time, in the order related here</em> .</p>
