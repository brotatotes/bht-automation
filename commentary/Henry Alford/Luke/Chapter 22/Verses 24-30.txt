 24 30. ] DISPUTE FOR PRE-EMINENCE. OUR LORD’S REPLY. Without attempting to decide the question whether this incident is strictly narrated in order of time, or identical with one of those strifes on this point related Matthew 18:1 ; Matthew 20:20 , I will offer one or two remarks on it as it here stands. (1) Its having happened at this time is not altogether unaccountable. They had been just enquiring  among themselves ( Luk 22:23 ),  who among them should do this thing . May it not reasonably be supposed, that some of them (Judas  at least ) would be anxiously employed in  self-justification , and that this would lead, in some part of the table, to a dispute of the kind here introduced? The natural effect of the Lord’s rebuke would be to give rise to a different spirit among them, and the question “  Lord, is it I? ” may have been the offspring of this better mind; but see note on Matthew 26:20-25 . (2) It is surprising to find the very declaration of our Lord on the former strife related in this Gospel (ch. Luk 9:46-48 ), repeated as having been made  at this Paschal meal , by John ( Joh 13:20 ). May not this lead us to suppose that there has been a transposition of some of the circumstances regarding these various contentions among the Apostles, and that these words occurring in John may possibly  point to a strife of this kind? (3) The ἐγώ εἰμι ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν ὡς ὁ διακονῶν is too clear an allusion to the  washing of their feet by the Lord , to have escaped even those Commentators who are slow to discern such hints (e.g. De Wette). The appeal, if  it had taken place , is natural and intelligible; but not otherwise. (4) The diction is repeatedly allusive to their  then employment: ἀνακείμενος διατίθεμαι ἔσθειν καὶ πίνειν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου all these have reference to things present, or words spoken, during that meal.
	I therefore infer that the strife  did happen at this time, in the order related here .
