 31 34. ] APPEAL TO PETER: HIS CONFIDENCE, AND OUR LORD’S REPLY. (See Matthew 26:30-35 ; Mark 14:26-31 ; John 13:36-38 .) The speech appears to  proceed continuously . There are marks in these words of our Lord, of close connexion with what has gone before.  His way which the Father διέθετο to Him, is  to His kingdom but it is  through πειρασμοί .

Such sudden and earnest addresses spring forth from deep love and concern awakened for another.
