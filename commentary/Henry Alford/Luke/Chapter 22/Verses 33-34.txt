<p><strong> 33, 34.</strong> ] Whether these words are in close connexion with the preceding, may I think be doubted. They may represent the same reply of our Lord as we have recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:38">John 13:38</span> . One thing seems clear, without any attempt at minutely harmonizing: that <em> two announcements were made</em> by our Lord to Peter of his future denial, occasioned by <em> two very different professions of his</em> . One, <em> during the last meal</em> , i.e. before going out, and occasioned by Peter’s professed readiness to go to prison and to death (= to lay down his life) for and with the Lord: the other, <em> on the way to the Mount of Olives</em> , after the declaration that all should be offended, and occasioned by Peter’s profession that though all should be offended, yet would not he. Nothing is more natural or common than the repetition, by the warm-hearted and ardent, of professions like these, in spite of warning: and when De Wette calls such an interpretation <em> eine Nothhulfe</em> , all that we can say is to disclaim any wish to clear up difficulties, except by going into their depths and examining them honestly and diligently. If the above view be correct, I conceive that the account in John of this profession and our Lord’s answer, being in strict coherence, and arising out of the subject of conversation, must be taken as the <em> exact</em> one: and Luke must be supposed to have inserted them here <em> without being aware of the intermediate remarks</em> which led to them.

<p>This is the only place in the Gospels where our Lord addresses Peter by the name Πέτρε . And it is remarkable as occurring in the very place where He forewarns him of his approaching denial of Himself.</p>
