 39 46. ] CHRIST’S AGONY AT THE MOUNT OF OLIVES. Matthew 26:36-46 . Mark 14:32-42 . Joh 18:1 . For all comment on the general narrative, see notes on Matthew. Our account is compendious, combines the three prayers of our Lord into one, and makes no mention of the Three Apostles being taken apart from the rest. On the other hand it inserts the very important additional details of Luke 22:44-45 , besides the particularity of ὡσεὶ λίθου βολήν , Luke 22:41 .
