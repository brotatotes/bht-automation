 47 53. ] BETRAYAL AND APPREHENSION OF JESUS. Matthew 26:47-56 . 2 John 1:2-11; 2 John 1:2-112 John 1:2-11 . Our narrative is here distinguished even more than before by minute and striking details (see on the whole the notes to Matt.).
	The first of these is the address to Judas Luke 22:48 , calling the traitor by name, and setting before him the whole magnitude of his crime in the very words in which the treason had lately (Matthew 26:45 ; Mar 14:41 ) and so often (Matthew 26:2 ; Matthew 20:18 ; Mat 17:22 ) been announced.
	Another is in Luke 22:49 , where the disciples seeing  τὸ ἐσόμενον  , ask  Κύριε  ,   εἰ πατάξ  .   ἐν μαχαίρῃ  ; which question refers to, and is the filling up of their misunderstanding of our Lord in Luke 22:38 .
	Again Luk 22:51 is peculiar to Luke.
