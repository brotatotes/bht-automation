<p><strong> 47 53.</strong> ] BETRAYAL AND APPREHENSION OF JESUS. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:47-56">Matthew 26:47-56</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:2-11">2 John 1:2-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:2-11">2 John 1:2-11</span><span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:2-11">2 John 1:2-11</span> . Our narrative is here distinguished even more than before by minute and striking details (see on the whole the notes to Matt.).
	</p>
<p>The first of these is the address to Judas <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:48">Luke 22:48</span> , calling the traitor by name, and setting before him the whole magnitude of his crime in the very words in which the treason had lately (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:45">Matthew 26:45</span> ; Mar 14:41 ) and so often (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:2">Matthew 26:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:18">Matthew 20:18</span> ; Mat 17:22 ) been announced.
	</p>
<p>Another is in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:49">Luke 22:49</span> , where the disciples seeing <strong> τὸ ἐσόμενον</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ask <strong> Κύριε</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> εἰ πατάξ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν μαχαίρῃ</strong> <strong> ;</strong> which question refers to, and is the filling up of their misunderstanding of our Lord in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:38">Luke 22:38</span> .
	</p>
<p>Again Luk 22:51 is peculiar to Luke.</p>
