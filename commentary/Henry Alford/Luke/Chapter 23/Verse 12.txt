<b> 12.</b>] The cause of the quarrel is uncertain: apparently something concerning Herod’s power of jurisdiction, which was conceded by Pilate in this sending Jesus to him, and again waived by Herod in sending Him back again. From chap. xiii. 1, Pilate appears to have encroached on that jurisdiction. The remarks of some Commentators about their<i> uniting in enmity against Christ,</i> are quite beside the purpose. The prosent feeling of Pilate was any thing but hostile to the person of Christ: and Herod, by his treatment of Him, shews that he thought Him beneath his judicial notice.<br><br> This remission of Jesus to Herod seems not to have been in the possession of either of the other three Evangelists. It is worthy of notice that they all relate the mocking by the soldiers of Pilate, which St. Luke omits, whereas he gives it as taking place before Herod. This is one of the very few cases where the nature of the history shews that<i> both</i> happened.<br><br> Let the student ask himself, How could St. John, if he composed his Gospel with that of St. Luke before him, have here given us a narrative in which so important a fact as this is not only not related, but absolutely<i> cannot find any place of insertion? Its real place</i> is after John yer. 38;—but obviously nothing was further from the mind of that Evangelist, for he represents Pilate as speaking continuously.
