 25.  τὸν δ  .   σ  . κ . τ . λ .] The description is inserted for the sake of contrast; see Acts 3:14 . Luke omits the scourging and mocking of Jesus. It is  just possible that he might have omitted the mocking, because he had related a similar incident before Herod; but how shall we say this of the scourging, if he had seen any narratives which contained it? The break between Luk 23:25-26 is harsh in the extreme, and if Luke had any materials wherewith to fill it up, I have no doubt he would have done so.
