<b> 28.</b>]<b> turning unto them—</b>after He<b> was</b> relieved from the burden of the cross. This word comes from an eyewitness.<br><br><b> for me</b>—His future course was not one to be bewailed—see especially on this saying, Heb. xii. 2,—<i> “who for the Joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame.”</i> Nor again were His sacred sufferings a mere popular tragedy for street-bewailing; the sinners should weep for<i> themselves,</i> not for Him.<b> for yourselves, and for your children...</b>—see Matthew ver. 25, where the people called down the vengeance of His blood on themselves<i> “and upon our children.” Many of those who now bewailed Him perished$n the siege of Jerusalem.</i> Those who now were young wives, would not be more than<i> sixty</i> when (A. D. 70) the city was taken. But to<i> their children</i> more especially belonged the miseries of which the Lord here<br><br> speaks.
