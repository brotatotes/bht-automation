<b> 3.</b>] This question is related in all four Gospels. Bat in John the answer is widely different from the distinct affirmation in the other three, amounting perhaps to it in substance—at all events affirming that He was ‘a King’—which was the form of their charge. I believe therefore that the Three give merely the general import of the Lord’s answer, which St. John relates in full. It is hardly possible, if Jesus had affirmed the fact so strongly and barely as the Three relate it, that Pilate should have made the avowal in ver. 4—which St. John completely explains.<br><br><b> 34</b>] Spoken<br><br> apparently<i> during the act of the crucifixion,</i> or immediately that the crosses were set up. Now, first, in the fullest sense, from the wounds in His Hands and Feet, is His Blood shed, for the<b> forgiveness</b> of sins (Matt. xxvi. 28), and He inaugurates His intercessional office by a prayer for His murderers—<i> “forgive them.”</i> This also is a fulfilment of Scripture, Isa. liii. 12,—where the contents of our verses 33, 34 are remarkably pointed out.<br><br> His<i> teaching</i> ended at ver. 31. His<i> High Priesthood</i> is now begun. His first three sayings on the Cross are<i> for others:</i> see ver. 43: John xix. 26, 27.<br><br><b> Father</b>] He is the<i> Son of God,</i> and He speaks in the fulness of this covenant relation,— “<i>I knew that Thou always hearest Me”</i>—it is not merely<i> a prayer</i>—but<i> the</i> prayer of the Great Intercessor, which is always heard. Notice that even on the Cross, there is no alienation, no wrath of condemnation, between the Father and the Son.<br><br><b> forgive them</b>]<i> Who are here intended?</i> Doubtless, first and directly,<i> the four soldiers,</i> whose work it had been to crucify Him. The words<b> they know not what they are doing</b> point directly at this: and it is surely a mistake to suppose that they<i> wanted no forgiveness,</i> because they were merely<i> doing their duty.</i> Stier remarks, “This is only a misleading fallacy, for they were sinners even as others, and their obedient and unsuspecting performance of their duty was not without a sinful pleasure in doing it, or at all events formed part of their entire standing as sinners, included in that<i> sin of the world,</i> to which the Lord here ascribes His Crucifixion.” But not only to<i> them,</i> but to them as the representatives of that sin of the world, does this prayer apply. The persons pointed at by<b> they</b> are<i> all mankind,</i>—the Jewish nation, as the next moving agent in His death,—but all of us,—inasmuch as for our sins He was bruised.<br><br><b> for they know not what they do,</b> primarily, as before, spoken of the<i> soldiers,</i>—then of the<i> council,</i> who delivered Him up, see John xi. 49,<b> “ye know nothing,”</b>—then of<i> all,</i> whose sin is from lack of knowledge of the truth, of<i> what sin is,</i> and what it<i> has done,</i>—even the crucifixion of the Lord. But certainly from this intercession is excluded<i> that one sin</i>—strikingly brought out by the passage thus cited as committed by him who said it, viz. Caiaphas,—and hinted at again by our Lord, John xix. 11—and perhaps also by the awful answer Matt. xxvi. 64,— ‘thou<i> saidst</i> it’—viz. in prophecy, John xi. 49; see also Matt. xxvi. 25,—and on the sin alluded to, Matt. xii. 31: 1 John v. 16. Observe that between the two members of this prayer lies the work of the Spirit leading to repentance—the prayer that they may have their eyes opened, and<i> know</i> what they have done: which is the necessary subjective condition of forgiveness of sins, see 2 Tim. ii. 25, 26.
