<p><strong> 30.</strong> ] This is cited from the next chapter of Hosea (ref.).

<p>It was partially and primarily accomplished, when multitudes of the Jews towards the end of the siege sought to escape death by hiding themselves in the subterranean passages and sewers under the city.… οὓς δ ʼ ἐν τοῖς ὑπονόμοις ἀνηρεύνων , καὶ τὸ ἔδαφος ἀναῤῥηγνύντες ὅσοις μὲν ἐνετύγχανον ἀνεῖλον . εὑρέθησαν δὲ καὶ ἐκεῖ νεκροὶ πλείους δισχιλίων , Jos. B. J. vi. 9. 4. But the words are too solemn, and too often used in a more awful connexion, for a further meaning to escape our notice: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:10">Isaiah 2:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:19">Isaiah 2:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:21">Isaiah 2:21</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+6:16">Revelation 6:16</span> , where is the striking expression ἀπὸ τῆς ὀργῆς <strong> τοῦ ἀρνίου</strong> of Him who now was the victim about to be offered. And the whole warning as every other respecting the destruction of Jerusalem looks through the type to the antitype, the great day of His wrath. <em> Now</em> , <strong> ἔρχονται ἡμέραι</strong> then <strong> ἦλθεν ἡ ἡμέρα</strong> ἡ μεγάλη τῆς ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+6:17">Revelation 6:17</span> .

<p>It is interesting to see how often David, who had passed so long in hiding among the rocks of the wilderness from Saul, calls the Lord <em> his Rock</em> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:2">Psalms 18:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:46">Psalms 18:46</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+42:9">Psalms 42:9</span> , &amp;c.). They who have this defence, will not need to call on the rocks to hide them.</p>
