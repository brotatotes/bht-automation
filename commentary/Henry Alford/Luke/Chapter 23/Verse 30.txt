<b> 30.</b>] This is cited from the next chapter of Hosea (x. 8). It was partially and primarily accomplished, when multitudes of the Jews towards the end of the siege sought to escape death by hiding themselves in the subterranean passages and sewers under the city, as related by Josephus: who adds that more than two thousand were found dead in these hiding-places, besides those who were detected there and killed.... But the words are too solemn, and too often used in a more awful connexion, for a further meaning to escape our notice: see Isa. ii. 10, 19, 21, and Rev. vi. 16, where is the striking expression “<i>from the wrath</i> of<b> the Lamb</b>”—of Him who now was the victim about to be offered. And the whole warning—as every other respecting the destruction of Jerusalem—looks through the type to the antitype, the great day of His wrath. Now,<b> the days are coming—</b>then “<b>the</b> great day of His<i> wrath</i><b> is come,</b>” Rev. vi.<br><br> 17. It is interesting to see how often David, who had passed as long in hiding among the rocks of the wilderness from Saul, calls the Lord<i> his Rock</i> (see Ps. xviii. 2, 46; xlii. 9, &c.). They who have this defence, will not need to call on the rocks to hide them.
