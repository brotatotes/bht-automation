 31. ] This verse  the solemn close of our Lord’s teaching on earth compares His own sufferings with that awful judgment which shall in the end overtake sinners, the unrepentant human kind the  dry tree . These things  ταῦτα were  a judgment on sin; He  bore our sins; He, the vine, the  green tree , the fruit-bearing tree, of Whom His people are the branches, if He, if they in Him and in themselves, are so treated, so tried with sufferings,  what shall become of them who are cast forth as a branch and are withered? Read 1 Peter 4:12-18 ; Luk 23:18 is a paraphrase of our text. Theophylact’s comment is excellent: εἰ ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν ἐν ἐμοὶ ἐγκάρπῳ καὶ ἀειθαλεί καὶ ἀειζώῳ διὰ τὴν θεότητα , τί γένηται ἐν ὑμῖν ἀκάρποις καὶ πάσης δικαιοσύνης ζωοποιοῦ ἐστερημένοις ;
	The explanations which make the green-tree = the young, and the dry = the old (Bengel), or the green-tree = the women, comparatively innocent, the dry = the guilty (Baumgarten-Crusius), at the destruction of Jerusalem seem to me unworthy of the place which the words hold, though the latter agrees with the symbolism of Ezekiel 20:47 , compared with Luke 21:4 .
