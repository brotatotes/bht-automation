<p><strong> 31.</strong> ] This verse <em> the solemn close of our Lord’s teaching on earth</em> compares His own sufferings with that awful judgment which shall in the end overtake sinners, the unrepentant human kind the <em> dry tree</em> . These things <strong> ταῦτα</strong> were <em> a</em> judgment on sin; He <em> bore our sins;</em> He, the vine, the <em> green tree</em> , the fruit-bearing tree, of Whom His people are the branches, if He, if they in Him and in themselves, are so treated, so tried with sufferings, <em> what shall become of them who are cast forth as a branch and are withered?</em> Read <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:12-18">1 Peter 4:12-18</span> ; Luk 23:18 is a paraphrase of our text. Theophylact’s comment is excellent: εἰ ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν ἐν ἐμοὶ ἐγκάρπῳ καὶ ἀειθαλεί καὶ ἀειζώῳ διὰ τὴν θεότητα , τί γένηται ἐν ὑμῖν ἀκάρποις καὶ πάσης δικαιοσύνης ζωοποιοῦ ἐστερημένοις ;

<p>The explanations which make the green-tree = the young, and the dry = the old (Bengel), or the green-tree = the women, comparatively innocent, the dry = the guilty (Baumgarten-Crusius), at the destruction of Jerusalem seem to me unworthy of the place which the words hold, though the latter agrees with the symbolism of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+20:47">Ezekiel 20:47</span> , compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:4">Luke 21:4</span> .</p>
