<b> 31.</b>] This verse—<i>the solemn close of our Lord’s teaching on earth</i>—compares His own sufferings with that awful judgment which shall in the end overtake sinners, the unrepentant human kind—the<i> dry tree.</i><b> These things</b>—were a judgment on sin;—He<i> bore</i><i> our sins</i>;—He,—the vine, the<i> green tree,</i> the fruit-bearing tree,—of Whom His people are the branches,—if He, if they in Him and in themselves, are so treated, so tried with sufferings,<i> what shall become of them who are cast forth as a branch and are withered?</i> Read 1 Peter iv. 12–18;—ver. 18 is a paraphrase of our text. Theophylact’s comment is excellent: “If they do these things to Me, fruitful and ever-flourishing and immortal from my Godhead, what will happen to you, unfruitful, and void of all life-giving righteousness?”—The explanations which make the<i> green tree</i> mean the young, and the<i> dry,</i> the old,—or the<i> green tree</i> mean the women comparatively innocent, the<i> dry</i>, the guilty, at the destruction of Jerusalem,—seem to me unworthy of the place which the words hold, though the latter agrees with the symbolism Ezek. xx. 47, compared with xxi. 4.<b> 32.</b>] Since the publication of the first edition of this work, the additional evidence of the Sinaitic MS. has made it appear that we ought to read the text simply,<b> two other malefactors:</b> not, as I maintained before,<b> “two others, male-Factors.”</b>
