<p><strong> 34.</strong> ] Spoken apparently <em> during the act of the crucifixion</em> , or immediately that the crosses were set up. Now first, in the fullest sense, from the wounds in His Hands and Feet, is His Blood shed, εἰς <strong> ἄφεσιν</strong> ἁμαρτιῶν ( Mat 26:28 ), and He inaugurates His intercessional office by a prayer for His murderers, <strong> ἄφες</strong> αὐτοῖς . This also is a fulfilment of Scripture, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12">Isaiah 53:12</span> ; where the contents of our Luk 23:33-34 are remarkably pointed out.

<p>His <em> teaching</em> ended at <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:31">Luke 23:31</span> . His <em> High-Priesthood</em> is now begun. His first three sayings on the Cross are <em> for others:</em> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:43">Luke 23:43</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:26-27">John 19:26-27</span> .

<p><strong> πάτερ</strong> ] He is the <em> Son of God</em> , and He speaks in the fulness of this covenant relation. ἐγὼ ᾔδειν ὅτι πάντοτέ μου ἀκούεις : it is not merely <em> a prayer</em> but <em> the</em> prayer of the Great Intercessor, which is always heard. Notice that though on the Cross, there is no alienation, no wrath of condemnation, between the Father and the Son.

<p><strong> ἄφες αὐτοῖς</strong> <em> who are here intended?</em> Doubtless, first and directly, <em> the four soldiers</em> , whose work it had been to crucify Him. The <strong> ποιοῦσιν</strong> points directly at this: and it is surely a mistake to suppose that they <em> wanted no forgiveness</em> , because they were merely <em> doing their duty</em> . Stier remarks, “This is only a misleading fallacy, for they were sinners even as others, and their obedient and unsuspecting performance of their duty was not without a sinful pleasure in doing it, or at all events formed part of their entire standing as sinners, included in that <em> sin of the world</em> , to which the Lord here ascribes His Crucifixion” (vi. 403, edn. 2). But not only to <em> them</em> , but to them as the representatives of that sin of the world, does this prayer apply. The nominative to <strong> ποιοῦσιν</strong> is οἱ ἄνθρωποι <em> mankind</em> , the Jewish nation, as the next moving agent in His death, but all of us, inasmuch as for our sins He was bruised.

<p><strong> οὐ γὰρ οἴδασιν τί ποιοῦσιν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> primarily, as before, spoken of the <em> soldiers</em> , then of the <em> council</em> , who delivered Him up, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:49">John 11:49</span> , ὑμεῖς <strong> οὐκ οἴδατε</strong> οὐδέν , then of <em> all</em> , whose sin is from lack of knowledge of the truth, of <em> what sin is</em> , and what it <em> has done</em> even the crucifixion of the Lord. But certainly from this intercession is excluded <em> that one sin</em> strikingly brought out by the passage thus cited as committed by him who said it, viz. Caiaphas, and hinted at again by our Lord, Joh 19:11 and perhaps also by the awful answer <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:64">Matthew 26:64</span> , σὺ <strong> εἶπας</strong> ‘thou <em> saidst</em> it’ viz. in prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:49">John 11:49</span> ; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:25">Matthew 26:25</span> , and on the sin alluded to, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:31">Matthew 12:31</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:16">1 John 5:16</span> .

<p>Observe that between the two members of this prayer lies the work of the Spirit leading to repentance the prayer that they may have their eyes opened, and <em> know</em> what they have done: which is the necessary subjective condition of forgiveness of sins, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25-26">2 Timothy 2:25-26</span> .</p>
