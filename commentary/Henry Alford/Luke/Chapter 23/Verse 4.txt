<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] The preceding question had been asked <em> within</em> the pr√¶torium a fact which our narrator does not adduce, representing the whole as a continuous conversation in presence of the Jews: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:38">John 18:38</span> . We may remark (and on this see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:18">Matthew 27:18</span> ; Mar 15:10 ) that Pilate must have known well that a man who had really done that, whereof Jesus was accused, would be <em> no such object of hatred to the Sanhedrim</em> . This knowledge was doubtless accompanied (as the above-cited verses imply) with a previous acquaintance with some of the sayings and doings of Jesus, from which Pilate had probably formed his own opinion that He was <em> no such King</em> as His foes would represent Him. This is now confirmed by His own words (as related by John); and Pilate wishes to dismiss Him, finding no fault in Him.</p>
