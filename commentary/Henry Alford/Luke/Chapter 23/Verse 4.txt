<b> 4.</b>] The preceding question had been<b> asked within</b> the pretorium—a fact which our Narrator does not adduce,—representing the whole as a continuous conversation in presence of the Jews; see John, ver. 38. We may remark (and on this see Matthew, ver. 18: Mark, ver. 10) that Pilate must have known well that a man who had really done that, whereof Jesus was accused, would be<i> no such object of hatred to the Sanhedrim.</i> This knowledge was doubtless accompanied (as the above-cited verses imply) with a previous acquaintance with some of the sayings and doings of Jesus, from which Pilate had probably formed his own opinion that He was<i> no such King</i> as His foes would represent Him. This is now confirmed by His own words (as related by St. John); and Pilate wishes to dismiss Him, finding no fault in Him.
