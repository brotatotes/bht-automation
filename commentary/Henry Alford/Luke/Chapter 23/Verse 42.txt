<b> 42.</b>] The thief had heard of the announcements which Jesus had made,—or at all events of the popular rumour concerning his Kingdom. His faith lays hold on the truth that this<i> is</i> the King of the Jews in a higher and immortal sense. There is nothing so astounding in this man’s faith<i> dogmatically</i> considered, as has been thought; he merely<i> joins</i> the common belief of the Jews of a Messianic Kingdom, in which the ancient Fathers were to rise, &c.,—with the conviction, that<i> Jesus is the Messiah.</i> What is<i> really</i> astounding, is the<i> power</i> and<i> strength</i> of that faith, which, amidst shame and pain and mockery, could thus lift itself to the apprehension of the<i> Crucified</i> as this King. This thief would fill a conspicuous place in a list of the triumphs of faith supplementary to Heb. xi.<br><br><b> in thy kingdom</b>] The A.V., following the Latin Vulgate (so also Luther), renders this<i> “into thy kingdom,”</i> which is a sad mistake,<b> as</b> it destroys the force of the expression. It is in<b> thy kingdom—with thy kingdom,</b> so<i> “shall come in His glory,”</i> Matt. xxv. 31, which we (A. V.) have translated rightly. The above mistake entirely loses the solemn sense of<b> comest</b>—making it merely<i> ‘comest into,’</i> just as we say to<i> “come into”</i> an estate: whereas it is the chief word in the clause, and<i> “is Thy kingdom”</i> its qualification, at thy coming in thy kingdom.<br><br> It will be seen that there is no necessity for supposing the man to have been<i> a disciple,</i> as some have done.<br><br> It is remarkable how, in three following sayings, the Lord appears<b> as</b> Prophet, Priest, and King: as<i> Prophet,</i> to the<i> daughters of Jerusalem;—</i>as<i> Priest,</i> interceding for forgiveness;—as<i> King,</i> acknowledged by the penitent thief, and answering his prayer.
