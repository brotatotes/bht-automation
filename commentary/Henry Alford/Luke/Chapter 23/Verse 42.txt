 42. ] The thief had heard of the announcements which Jesus had made, or at all events of the popular rumour concerning his Kingdom. His faith lays hold on the truth that this  is the King of the Jews in a higher and immortal sense. There is nothing so astounding in this man’s faith  dogmatically considered, as De Wette thinks; he merely  joins the common belief of the Jews of a Messianic Kingdom, in which the ancient Fathers were to rise, &c., with the conviction, that  Jesus is the Messiah . What is  really astounding, is the  power and  strength of that faith, which, amidst shame and pain and mockery, could thus lift itself to the apprehension of  the Crucified as this King. This thief would fill a conspicuous place in a list of the triumphs of faith supplementary to Hebrews 11:0 .
