 46. ] The use of  φωνῇ μεγάλῃ shews that  this was the cry to which Matt. and Mark allude. The words are from the LXX, varying however from the common reading παραθήσομαι , and giving the verb in the present, which is also the rendering of the Hebrew ( אַפְקִיד ).
	These words have in them an important and deep meaning. They accompany that, which in our Lord’s case was strictly speaking the  act of death. It was  His own act not ‘feeling the approach of death,’ as some, not apprehending the matter, have commented; but a  determinate delivering up of His spirit to the Father . παρέδωκεν τὸ πνεῦμα , John: see Joh 10:18 οὐδεὶς αἴρει αὐτὴν ἀπ ʼ ἐμοῦ , ἀλλ ʼ ἐγὼ  τίθημι αὐτὴν ἀπ  ʼ   ἐμαυτοῦ  . None of the Evangelists say ‘He  died: ’ although that expression is ever after used of His death stated as one great fact: but it is, ἀφῆκεν τὸ πν ., Matt.; ἐξέπνευσεν , Mark, Luke; παρέδωκεν τὸ πνεῦμα , John.
	The  πνεῦμα here is the  Personality the human soul informed by the Spirit,  in union: not separated, so that His soul went to Hades, and His spirit to the Father (Olshausen). Both are delivered into the hand of the Father by Whom quickened (but ζωοποιηθεὶς πνεύματι of 1Pe 3:18 is to be rendered ‘quickened  in the spirit’  by the Father is understood in ζωοποιηθείς ) He worked His great victory over death and Hell.
	See again 1 Peter 3:18-19 , and notes, and Romans 8:10-11 .
	The latter part of the verse in Psalms 31:0 , ‘  for Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of truth ,’ is not applicable here. The whole Psalm is not strictly prophetic, but is applied by the Lord to Himself.
