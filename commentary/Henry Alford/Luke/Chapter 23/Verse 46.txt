<b> 46.</b>] The use of<b> with a loud voice</b> shews that<i> this was the cry</i> to which St. Matthew and St. Mark allude. The words uttered are from the LXX, varying however from the common reading<i> “I will commend,”</i> and giving the verb in the<i> present,</i> which is also the rendering of the Hebrew.<br><br> These words have in them an important and deep meaning. They accompany that, which in our Lord’s case was strictly speaking the<i> act</i> of death. It was<i> His own act—not</i> ‘feeling the approach of death,’ as some, not apprehending the matter, have commented; but a<i> determinate delivering up of His spirit to the Father.— “He delivered up His spirit,”</i> John: see John x. 18— “<i>no man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.”</i> None of the Evangelists say<i> ‘He died.’</i> although that expression is ever after used of His death stated as one great fact:—but it is,<i> “yielded up His spirit,”</i> Matthew;<i> “breathed His last,”</i><br><br> Mark, Luke;<i> “delivered up His spirit,”</i> John, The spirit here is the<i> Personality</i>—the human soul informed by the Spirit,<b> in union</b>:—not separated, so that His soul went to Hadés, and His spirit to the Father, as Olshausen thinks. Both are delivered into the hand of the Father; by Whom quickened, He worked His great victory over death and Hell. See again 1 Pet. iii, 18, 19 and notes, and Rom. viii. 10, 11.<br><br> The latter part of the verse in Ps. xxxi.<i> ‘for Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of truth,’</i> is not applicable here. The whole Psalm is not strictly prophetic, but is applied by the Lord Himself.
