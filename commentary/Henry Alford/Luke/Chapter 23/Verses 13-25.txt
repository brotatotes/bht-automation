<p><strong> 13 25.</strong> ] FURTHER HEARING BEFORE PILATE, WHO STRIVES TO RELEASE HIM, BUT ULTIMATELY YIELDS TO THE JEWS. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:15-26">Matthew 27:15-26</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:6-15">Mark 15:6-15</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:39-40">John 18:39-40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:39-40">John 18:39-40</span> . Our account, while entirely distinct in <em> form</em> from the others, is in <em> substance</em> nearly allied to them. In a few points it approaches John very nearly, compare Luk 23:18 with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:40">John 18:40</span> , also ἕνα <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:17">Luke 23:17</span> , with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:39">John 18:39</span> .

<p>The second declaration of our Lord’s innocence by Pilate is in John’s account united with the first, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:38">Luke 23:38</span> . In the three first Gospels, as asserted in our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:14">Luke 23:14</span> , the questioning takes place in the presence of the Jews: not so, however, in John (see Joh 18:28 ).</p>
