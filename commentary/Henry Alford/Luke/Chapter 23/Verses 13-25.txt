 13 25. ] FURTHER HEARING BEFORE PILATE, WHO STRIVES TO RELEASE HIM, BUT ULTIMATELY YIELDS TO THE JEWS. Matthew 27:15-26 . Mark 15:6-15 .John 18:39-40; John 18:39-40 . Our account, while entirely distinct in  form from the others, is in  substance nearly allied to them. In a few points it approaches John very nearly, compare Luk 23:18 with John 18:40 , also ἕνα Luke 23:17 , with John 18:39 .
	The second declaration of our Lord’s innocence by Pilate is in John’s account united with the first, Luke 23:38 . In the three first Gospels, as asserted in our Luke 23:14 , the questioning takes place in the presence of the Jews: not so, however, in John (see Joh 18:28 ).
