<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] This verse cannot well be interpolated from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:0">John 20:0</span> , for the only reason for the insertion would be, to tally with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:24">Luke 24:24</span> , and in that case it certainly <em> would not mention Peter alone</em> . That Cleopas says, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:24">Luke 24:24</span> , <strong> some of</strong> [ <strong> them that were with</strong> ] <strong> us went,</strong> &amp;c. must not be pressed too much, although it does certainly look as if he knew of more than one (see note there). The similarity in diction to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:5">John 20:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:10">John 20:10</span> ( παρακύψας βλέπει τὰ ὀθόνια κείμενα , and ἀπῆλθ . πρὸς ἑαυτ ., being common to the two passages) indicates a common origin, and, if I mistake not, one distinct from the rest of the narrative in this chapter. The meaning of <strong> πρὸς ἑαυτόν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> as belonging to ἀπῆλθεν and not to θαυμάζων , is fixed by the expression in John, l. c.</p>
