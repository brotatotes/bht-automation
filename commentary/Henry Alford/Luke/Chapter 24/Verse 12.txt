<b> 12.</b>] This verse cannot well have been interpolated from John xx., for the only reason for the insertion would be, to tally with ver. 24, and in that case it certainly<i> would not men-tion Peter alone.</i> That Cleopas bak ver. 24,<b> certain of them that were with us went,</b>&c. must not be pressed too much, although it does certainly look as if he knew of more than one (see note there). The similarity in diction to John xx. 5, 10— (<i> “stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves,”</i> and<i> “went away home,”</i> being common to the two passages) indicates a common origin, and, if I mistake not, one distinct from the rest of the narrative in this chapter.
