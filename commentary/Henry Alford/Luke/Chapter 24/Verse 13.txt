One of them, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:18">Luke 24:18</span> , was called Kleopas (= Κλεόπατρος , probably a different name from Κλωπᾶς , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:25">John 19:25</span> ( חלפי ): see note on Mat 10:3 ). Who the other was, is idle to conjecture. Origen, in several places, calls him Simon; apparently from having read λέγοντες in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:34">Luke 24:34</span> , and referring ὤφθη τ .

Wieseler (Chron. vol. i. p. 431) believes the two to have been, James the son of Alphæus or Clopas or Cleopas (but see above) journeying <em> with his father</em> , and the appearance on the road to Emmaus to be the same as ὤφθη Ἰακώβῳ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:7">1 Corinthians 15:7</span> . Our narrative seems to have been from the report of Cleopas.

<p><strong> Ἐμμαούς</strong> ] Joseph., B. J. vii. 6. 6, mentions this Emmaus as sixty stades from Jerusalem. There were two other places of the same name: (1) a town afterwards called Nicopolis, twenty-two Roman miles from Jerusalem, where Judas Maccabæus defeated the Syrian general Gorgias: see 1Ma 3:40-57 . (2) Another Emmaus is mentioned Jos. B. J. iv. 1. 3, πρὸ τῆς Τιβεριάδος where he adds, μεθερμηνευομένη δὲ Ἀμμαοῦς θερμὰ λέγοιτ ʼ ἄν , ἔστι γὰρ ἐν αὐτῇ πηγὴ θερμῶν ὑδάτων πρὸς ἄκεσιν ἐπιτήδειος . This was the case also with the other places of the name. Our Emmaus is now called Cubeibi (?).</p>
