<b> 13.</b>]<b> of them,</b> not of the<i> Apostles</i>—the last mentioned were<i> “the eleven, and all the rest,”</i> ver. 9: see also ver. 22,<i> “of us”</i> (<i> “of our company”</i>). One of them ver. 18, was walled kleopas (equivalent to Kleopatros, probably a different name from Clopas, John xix. 25: see note on Matt. x. 3). Who the other was, is idle to conjecture. Origen, in several places, calls him Simon; apparently from having understood<i> “saying”</i> in ver. 34 to refer to the two from Emmaus, and referring<i> “hath appeared unto Simon”</i> to the present appearance. Epiphanius says it was Nathanael; Theophylact, St. Luke himself. This may shew what such reports are worth. Wieseler believes the two to have been, James the son of Alphæus or Clopas or Cleopas (but see above) journeying<i> with his father,</i> and the appearance on the road to Emmaus to be the same as<i> “was seen of James,”</i> 1 Cor. xv. 7. Our narrative seems to have been from the report of Cleopas.<br><br><b> Emmaus</b>] Josephus also mentions this Emmaus as sixty furlongs from Jerusalem. There were two other places of the same name: (1) a town afterwards called Nicopolis, twenty-two Roman miles from Jerusalem, where Judas Maccabeus defeated the Syrian general Gorgias: see 1 Macc. iii. 40–57. (2) Another Emmaus is mentioned by Josephus as being<i> in front of the sea of Tiberias:</i> and he adds, that Emmaus means, that there were warm springs there. This was the case also with the other places of the name. Our Emmaus is now called Cubeibi (?).
