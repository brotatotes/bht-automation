 13. ]  ἐξ αὐτῶν  , not of the  Apostles the last-mentioned were οἱ ἕνδεκα καὶ πάντες οἱ λοιποί , Luke 24:9 : see also Luke 24:22 , ἐξ ἡμῶν . One of them, Luke 24:18 , was called Kleopas (= Κλεόπατρος , probably a different name from Κλωπᾶς , John 19:25 ( חלפי ): see note on Mat 10:3 ). Who the other was, is idle to conjecture. Origen, in several places, calls him Simon; apparently from having read λέγοντες in Luke 24:34 , and referring ὤφθη τ . Σ . to the present appearance. Epiphanius says it was Nathanael; Theophylact, Luke himself. This may shew what such reports are worth. Wieseler (Chron. vol. i. p. 431) believes the two to have been, James the son of Alphæus or Clopas or Cleopas (but see above) journeying  with his father , and the appearance on the road to Emmaus to be the same as ὤφθη Ἰακώβῳ , 1 Corinthians 15:7 . Our narrative seems to have been from the report of Cleopas.
	 Ἐμμαούς ] Joseph., B. J. vii. 6. 6, mentions this Emmaus as sixty stades from Jerusalem. There were two other places of the same name: (1) a town afterwards called Nicopolis, twenty-two Roman miles from Jerusalem, where Judas Maccabæus defeated the Syrian general Gorgias: see 1Ma 3:40-57 . (2) Another Emmaus is mentioned Jos. B. J. iv. 1. 3, πρὸ τῆς Τιβεριάδος where he adds, μεθερμηνευομένη δὲ Ἀμμαοῦς θερμὰ λέγοιτ ʼ ἄν , ἔστι γὰρ ἐν αὐτῇ πηγὴ θερμῶν ὑδάτων πρὸς ἄκεσιν ἐπιτήδειος . This was the case also with the other places of the name. Our Emmaus is now called Cubeibi (?).
