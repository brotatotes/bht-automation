<b> 13.</b>]<b> of them,</b> not of the<i> Apostles</i>—the last mentioned were<i> “the eleven, and all the rest,”</i> ver. 9: see also ver. 22,<i> “of us”</i> (<i> “of our company”</i>). One of them ver. 18, was walled kleopas (equivalent to Kleopatros, probably a different name from Clopas, John xix. 25: see note on Matt. x. 3). Who the other was, is idle to conjecture. Origen, in several places, calls him Simon; apparently from having understood<i> “saying”</i> in ver. 34 to refer to the two from Emmaus, and referring<i> “hath appeared unto Simon”</i> to the present appearance. Epiphanius says it was Nathanael; Theophylact, St. Luke himself. This may shew what such reports are worth. Wieseler believes the two to have been, James the son of Alphæus or Clopas or Cleopas (but see above) journeying<i> with his father,</i> and the appearance on the road to Emmaus to be the same as<i> “was seen of James,”</i> 1 Cor. xv. 7. Our narrative seems to have been from the report of Cleopas.
