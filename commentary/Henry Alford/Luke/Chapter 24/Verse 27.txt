<b> 27.</b>]<b> beginning</b> belongs to<i> both</i> the. following clauses. A similar expression is found Acts iii. 24. He began with Moses first;—He began with each as He came to them.<br><br><b> the things concerning himself.</b> De Wette remarks, “It were much to be wished that we knew what prophecies of the death and triumph of Christ. are here meant. There are but few that point to the subject.” But I take<i> the things concerning himself</i> to mean something very different from mere<i> prophetical passages.</i> The<i> whole Scriptures</i> are a<i> testimony to Him:</i> the whole history of the chosen people, with its types, its law, and its prophecies, is a<i> shewing forth Him:</i> and it<b> was</b> here the<i> whole</i>—<b>all the scriptures,</b>—that He laid out before them. This general leading into the meaning of the whole,<i> as a whole,</i> fulfilled in Him, would be much more opportune to the place, and time occupied, than a direct exposition of selected passages.<br><br><b> the things concerning himself</b> is right: not, ‘the<i> parts</i> concerning Him.’<br><br> Observe the testimony which this verse gives to the divine authority, and the Christian interpretation of the Old Testament Scriptures: so that the denial of the references to Christ’s death and glory in the O.T. is henceforth<i> nothing less than a denial of His own teaching.</i>
