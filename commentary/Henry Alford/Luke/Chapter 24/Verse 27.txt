There are but few that point to the subject.” But I take the  τὰ περὶ ἑαυτοῦ to mean something very different from mere  prophetical passages . The  whole Scriptures are a  testimony to Him: the whole history of the chosen people, with its types, and its law, and its prophecies, is a  shewing forth of Him: and it was here the  whole ,  πᾶσαι αἱ γρ  ., that He laid out before them. This general leading into the meaning of the whole,  as a whole , fulfilled in Him, would be much more opportune to the place, and the time occupied, than a direct exposition of selected passages.
