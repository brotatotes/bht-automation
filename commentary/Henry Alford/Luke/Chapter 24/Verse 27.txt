<p><strong> τὰ π</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἑαυτοῦ</strong> ] De Wette remarks, “It were much to be wished that we knew what prophecies of the death and triumph of Jesus are here meant. There are but few that point to the subject.” But I take the <strong> τὰ περὶ ἑαυτοῦ</strong> to mean something very different from mere <em> prophetical passages</em> . The <em> whole Scriptures</em> are a <em> testimony to Him:</em> the whole history of the chosen people, with its types, and its law, and its prophecies, is a <em> shewing forth of Him:</em> and it was here the <em> whole</em> , <strong> πᾶσαι αἱ γρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> that He laid out before them. This general leading into the meaning of the whole, <em> as a whole</em> , fulfilled in Him, would be much more opportune to the place, and the time occupied, than a direct exposition of selected passages.

<p><strong> The</strong> <em> things</em> <strong> concerning Himself</strong> (E. V.) is right: not, ‘the <em> parts</em> concerning Himself.’

<p>Observe the testimony which this verse gives to the divine authority, and the Christian interpretation, of the O.T. Scriptures: so that the denial of the references to Christ’s death and glory in the O.T. is henceforth <em> nothing less than a denial of His own teaching</em> .</p>
