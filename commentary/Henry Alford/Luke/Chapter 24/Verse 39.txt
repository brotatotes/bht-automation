<b> 39.</b>] There seems to be some doubt whether the reference to His hands and feet were on account of the<i> marks of the nails,</i> to prove His<i> identity,</i>â€”or as being the<i> uncovered parts</i> of His body, and to prove his<i> corporeity.</i> Both views seem supported by the text, and I think both were united. The sight of the Hands and Feet, which they recognized as His, might at once convince them of the<i> reality</i> the appearance, and the identity of the Person. The account of St. John confirms the idea that He showed them the marks of the nails, both by<i> His side</i> being added, and by the expressions of Thomas which followed. The same seems also implied in our ver. 40.
