<b> 39.</b>] There seems to be some doubt whether the reference to His hands and feet were on account of the<i> marks of the nails,</i> to prove His<i> identity,</i>—or as being the<i> uncovered parts</i> of His body, and to prove his<i> corporeity.</i> Both views seem supported by the text, and I think both were united. The sight of the Hands and Feet, which they recognized as His, might at once convince them of the<i> reality</i> the appearance, and the identity of the Person. The account of St. John confirms the idea that He showed them the marks of the nails, both by<i> His side</i> being added, and by the expressions of Thomas which followed. The same seems also implied in our ver. 40.<br><br> The assertion of the Lord must not be taken as representing merely ‘the popular notion concerning spirits’ (Dr. Burton);<i> He who is the Truth, does not speak thus of that which He knows, and has created.</i> He declares to us the truth, that those appearances to which He was now likened by the disciples, and spirits in general, have not flesh and bones. Observe<b> flesh and bones</b>—but not<i> blood.</i> This the resurrection Body probably<i> had not,</i>—as being the<i> animal life:—</i>see notes on John vi. 51,<br><br> and John xx. 27.
