<b> 4.</b>] The narrative does not, as the A.V. (<i> “stood by them”</i>), determine the<i> position</i> of the angels. It says merely that they<b> came upon them,</b> or that they<b> appeared to them;</b> the same Greek word is used in ch. ii. 9. On the<i> two</i> angels here, see note on Mark ver. 5; to which I will just add, that the Harmonistic view, as represented by Greswell, strangely enough puts together the angel in Matthew, and the angel in Mark, and makes the<i> two</i> angels in Luke: see Acts i. 10.
