<b> 44.</b>] Certainly, from the form of the beginning of this verse, which implies immediate sequence, St. Luke, at the time of writing his Gospel, was not in possession of records of any Galilæan appearances of the Lord, nor indeed of any later than this one. That he corrects this in Acts i., shews him meantime to have become acquainted with some other sources of information, not however perhaps including the Galilæan appearances.<br><br> The following discourse apparently contains a summary of many things said during the last forty days before the ascension;—they cannot have been said<i> on this evening;</i>—for after the command in ver. 49, the disciples would not have gone away into Galilee. Whether<i> the Evangelist regarded</i> it as a summary, is to me extremely doubtful. Knowing apparently of no Galilæan appearances, he seems to relate the command of ver. 49, both here and in the Acts, as intended to apply to the<i> whole time</i> between the Resurrection and the Ascension.<br><br><b> These are my words</b>... i.e. ‘behold the realization of My words,’&c.<br><br><b> which I spake:</b> see ch. xviii. 31–33; xxii. 37; Matt. xxvi. 56 al.; but doubtless He had often said things to them on these matters, which have not been recorded for us.
