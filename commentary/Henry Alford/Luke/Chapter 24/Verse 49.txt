 49. ] This promise is explained ( Act 1:5 ) to be the  baptism with the Holy Ghost , and the time is limited to ‘not many days hence.’
	 ἐγὼ ἐξαποστ  . ] The procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son is clearly here declared, as well as that from the Father. And consequently we find Peter, in Acts 2:33 , referring back to  these very words , in ascribing the outpouring of the Spirit to the now exalted Saviour. In that verse, the ἐγώ of this is filled up by τῇ δεξιᾷ τοῦ θεοῦ ὑψωθείς the proper supplement of it here also.
	The promise itself is not found in the three Gospels, but expressly and frequently in John 14-16; see Luke 14:16-26 ; Luke 15:26 ; Luke 16:7-11 ; Luke 16:13-14 .
	The present,  ἐξαποστέλλω  , is not = a future, but implies that the actual work is done, and the state brought in, by which that sending is accomplished; viz. the giving of the πᾶσα ἐξουσία ἐν οὐρανῷ κ . ἐπὶ γῆς , Matthew 28:18 .

	The word Ἱερουσ . is probably interpolated by some who, believing these words to represent the Galilæan discourse, placed it here for an explanation: or perhaps Act 1:4 gave occasion to it. This command must have been (historically) uttered  after the return from Galilee: see above.
	 ἐνδύσ  . ] Though the verb is used in the O.T. (see Judges 6:34 ; 2Ch 24:20 ; 1Ch 12:18 ) of  inspiration by the Spirit , it here has its full meaning, of  abiding upon and characterizing , as a garment does the person: this, as Stier remarks, was the true and complete clothing of the nakedness of the Fall.
