<b> 50.</b>] The Ascension appears to be related as taking place<i> after the</i> above<i> words were spoken</i>—but there is an uncertainty and want of specification about the narrative, which forbids us to conclude that it is intended as following immediately upon them. This, however, can only be said as taking the other Gospels and Acts i. into account: if we had<i> none but the Gospel of St. Luke,</i> we should certainly say that the Lord ascended<i> after the appearance to the Apostles and others, on the evening of the day of His resurrection.</i><br><br><b> he led them out,</b> i.e. probably, from the words<i> “in the city”</i> just having occurred, outside<i> Jerusalem:</i> but the<i> “out”</i> might only apply to the house in which they were: see Matt. xxvi. 75.<br><br><b> as far as to Bethany</b>—not quite to the village itself, but over the brow of tho Mount of Olives, where it descends on Bethany: see Acts i. 12. (The synonymousness of these two expressions may shew that the same is meant, when, Mark xi. 11, our Lord is said to have gone out at night to<i> Bethany,</i> and Luke xxi. 37,<i> to the Mount of Olives.)</i>
