<b> 51.</b>]<b> he was parted from them</b>—not,<i> ‘He went a little distance from them previous to His ascension,’</i>—as Meyer would interpret it; but the two verbs belong to one and the same incident,—<b>he was parted from them and borne up into heaven.</b> We need not understand,<i> ‘by an angel,’</i> or<i> ‘by a cloud;’</i> the<i> absolute</i> passive is best.<br><br> The tense is<i> imperfect,</i> signifying the continuance of<i> the going up</i> during the<i> “worshipping”</i> of the next verse.<br><br> The more particular account of the Ascension is given Acts i. 9–12, where see notes. That account is in perfect accordance with this, but supplementary to it.
