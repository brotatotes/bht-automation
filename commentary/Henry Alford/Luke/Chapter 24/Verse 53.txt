<b> 53.</b>]<b> continually,</b>—not ‘<i>all</i> their time;’—daily, at the hours of prayer: see Acts i. 13, 14; iii. 1.<br><br> A few words must be appended here in vindication of THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ASCENSION. To those who doubt<i> the fact of an Ascension at all,</i> I have nothing to say, standing as I do altogether on different ground from them.<br><br><i> The Lord Himself foretold</i> His Ascension, John vi. 62; xx. 17:—it<b> was</b> immediately after His disappearance from the earth<i> expressly announced by the Apostles,</i> Acts ii. 33, 34; v. 31:<i>—continued to be an article of their preaching and teaching,</i> 1 Pet. iii. 22; Eph. ii. 6; iv. 10; 1 Tim. iii. 16. So<i> far</i> should we have been assured of it, even had we<i> not possessed</i> the testimonies of St. Luke here and in the Acts:—for the fragment superadded to the Gospel of St. Mark<i> merely states the fact, not the manner of it.</i> But, to take first the<i> à priori</i> view,—<i>is it probable that our Lord would have left so weighty a fact in His history on earth, without witnesses?</i> And might we not<br><br> have concluded from the wording of John vi. 62, that our Lord must have intended an ascension<i> in the sight of some of those to whom He spoke,</i> and that the Evangelist himself<i> gives that hint, by recording those words without comment, that he had seen it?</i><br><br> Then again, is there any thing in the bodily state of our Lord after His Resurrection, which raises any even the least, difficulty here? He appeared suddenly, and vanished suddenly, when He pleased:—when it pleased Him, He ate, He spoke, He walked; but his Body was the Body of the Resurrection;—only not yet his<i> Body of Glory</i> (Phil. iii. 21), because He had<i> not yet assumed</i> that glory: but that He<i> could</i> assume it, and did assume it at his Ascension, will be granted by all who believe in Him as the Son of God. So that it seems, on<i> à priori grounds,</i> probable that,<i> granted the fact of the Ascension,</i> it did take place in some such manner as our accounts relate:—<i>in the sight of the disciples, and by the uplifting of the risen Body of the Lord towards that which is to those on this earth the visible heaven.</i>
