<b> 1.]</b> These dates are consistent with the<i> accurate tracing down</i> which St. Luke predicates of himself, ch. i. 3. In Matt. iii. 1 we have the same events indicated as to time by only “<i>In those days.</i>” The fifteenth year of the<i> sole principate</i> of Tiberius began Aug. 19, in the year of Rome 781, and reckoning backwards thirty years from that time (see ver. 23), we should have the birth of our Lord in 751, or about then; for “<i>about</i> thirty” will admit of some latitude. But Herod the Great died in the beginning of the year 750, and our Lord’s birth must be fixed<i> some months</i><i> at least before</i> the death of Herod. If then it be placed in 749, He would have been at least thirty-two at the time of His baptism, seeing that it took some time after the beginning of John’s ministry. This difficulty has led to the supposition that this fifteenth year is not to be dated from the<i> sole</i>, but from the<i> associated</i> principate of Tiberius, which commenced most probably at the end of 764. According to this, the fifteenth of Tiberius will begin at the end of 779—and our Lord’s birth would be 749 or 750: which will agree with the death of Herod. This latter explanation has usually been adopted. Our present æra was fixed by Dionysius Exiguus, in the sixth century, and places the birth of our Lord in 754. It may be doubted, however, whether in all these reckonings more accuracy has not been sought than the Gospel narrative warrants any expectation of our finding. The “<i>about</i> thirty” is a wide expression, and might cover any age from thirty (see note on ver. 23) to thirty-two or thirty-three.
