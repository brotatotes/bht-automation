<b> 1.]</b> These dates are consistent with the<i> accurate tracing down</i> which St. Luke predicates of himself, ch. i. 3. In Matt. iii. 1 we have the same events indicated as to time by only “<i>In those days.</i>” The fifteenth year of the<i> sole principate</i> of Tiberius began Aug. 19, in the year of Rome 781, and reckoning backwards thirty years from that time (see ver. 23), we should have the birth of our Lord in 751, or about then; for “<i>about</i> thirty” will admit of some latitude. But Herod the Great died in the beginning of the year 750, and our Lord’s birth must be fixed<i> some months</i><i> at least before</i> the death of Herod. If then it be placed in 749, He would have been at least thirty-two at the time of His baptism, seeing that it took some time after the beginning of John’s ministry. This difficulty has led to the supposition that this fifteenth year is not to be dated from the<i> sole</i>, but from the<i> associated</i> principate of Tiberius, which commenced most probably at the end of 764. According to this, the fifteenth of Tiberius will begin at the end of 779—and our Lord’s birth would be 749 or 750: which will agree with the death of Herod. This latter explanation has usually been adopted. Our present æra was fixed by Dionysius Exiguus, in the sixth century, and places the birth of our Lord in 754. It may be doubted, however, whether in all these reckonings more accuracy has not been sought than the Gospel narrative warrants any expectation of our finding. The “<i>about</i> thirty” is a wide expression, and might cover any age from thirty (see note on ver. 23) to thirty-two or thirty-three.<br><br> See on Matt. ii. 2, where it appears probable from astronomical considerations, that our Lord was born as early as U.C. 747.<br><br><b> Pontius Pilate....]</b> Pilate was only<i> Procurator</i> of Judæa: the word<b> governor</b> being used promiscuously of the leading officers of the Roman government. PONTIUS PILATE was the sixth procurator from the deposition of Archelaus, and came to Judæa about the year of Rome 779. He held the province ten years, and was sent to Rome to answer for his conduct by Vitellius, prefect of Syria, in 789, the year of the death of Tiberius. See chronological table in the Introduction to the Acts.<br><br><b> Herod]</b> See note on Matt. xiv. 1. HEROD ANTIPAS became tetrarch of Galilee after the death of his father Herod, in the year of Rome 750, and continued till he was deposed in 792.<b> Philip]</b> Son of Herod the Great by Cleopatra, a woman of Jerusalem. He was brought up at Rome, and after his father’s death in 750, was made tetrarch of Batanza, Gaulonitis, Trachonitis, Panias, Auranitis (Batanæa and Auranitis make up Ituræa), and continued till his death in 786 or 787. He built Cæsarea Philippi. He was by far the best of Herod’s sons, and ruled his portion mildly and well. He must not be confounded with<i> his half-brother Philip</i>, whose wife Herodias Herod Antipas seduced. This latter was disinherited by his father, and lived in privacy. See note on Matt. xiv. 1.<br><br><b> Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene]</b> ABILENE, the district round Abila, a town eighteen miles north of Damascus, now, according to Pococke, Nebi Abel. It must not be confounded with Abila in Decapolis. Josephus mentions it as among the districts which Claudius gave to king Agrippa I. under the name of<i> Abila of Lysanias,</i> and in another place as<i> the Kingdom called that of Lysanias.</i> See farther in note in my Greek Testament. It seems to have been a district patrimonially in possession of rulers bearing this name.
