<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] <strong> στρατευόμενοι</strong> properly, <strong> men on march:</strong> see Lexx.: but this need not be pressed, only that they were soldiers, serving in an army. Who these were, we have no means of determining. Certainly not soldiers of the army which Herod Antipas sent against Aretas, his father-in-law: see notes on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:1">Matthew 14:1</span> ff.

<p><strong> διασείειν</strong> prim., <em> to shake violently</em> . So Plato, τὰς ἶνας εἰς ἀταξίαν διέσεισε , Tim [34] p. 85: also met., <em> to confound</em> , διασείσειν τὰ Ἀθηναίων φρονήματα ὥστε μηδίσαι , Herod. vi. 109. The meaning here, to <strong> oppress</strong> or <strong> vex,</strong> corresponding to the Lat. <em> concutere</em> , seems to be confined to ecclesiastical use. Macarius, Hom. xliii. p. 139, ed. Migne, has it in this sense: ὥσπερ εἰσὶν οἱ τελῶναι καθεζόμενοι εἰς τὰς στενὰς ὁδούς , καὶ κατέχοντες τοὺς παριόντας καὶ διασείοντες .

<p><strong> συκοφ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The way in which <em> soldiers</em> would be likely to act the part of informers, would be by laying vexatious charges of disaffection against persons. In assigning a derivation for this verb, notice Liddell and Scott’s remark (after Passow): “The literal signif. is not found in any ancient writer, and is perhaps altogether an invention.”</p>
