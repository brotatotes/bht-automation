 2. ] ANNAS (= Ananus, Jos. Antt. xviii. 2. 2) the high-priest, was deposed by Valerius Gratus (U.C. 779), and after several changes, Joseph or Caiaphas (Joseph. as above), his son-in-law ( Joh 18:13 ), was made high-priest. It would appear from this verse (and the use of the singular,  -  εως  , renders the inference more stringent. Cf. also St. Luke’s own phrase, Act 4:6 ) that Annas, as  ex-high-priest , and possibly retaining in the view of the Jews the  legitimate high-priesthood , was  counted still as having the office: he certainly ( Joh 18:13 )  exercised the power , and had influence enough to procure the actual high-priesthood for  five of his sons , after his own deposition, Jos. Antt. xx. 9. 1.
	A substitute, or deputy to the high-priest (called by the Talmudists סְנַן כֹּהֲנַיָּא ), appears to have been usual, see 2 Kings 25:18 ; and Annas would thus be able to evade the Roman appointment and keep the authority.
