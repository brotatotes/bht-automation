<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] ANNAS (= Ananus, Jos. Antt. xviii. 2. 2) the high-priest, was deposed by Valerius Gratus (U.C. 779), and after several changes, Joseph or Caiaphas (Joseph. as above), his son-in-law ( Joh 18:13 ), was made high-priest. It would appear from this verse (and the use of the singular, <strong> -</strong> <strong> εως</strong> <strong> ,</strong> renders the inference more stringent. Cf. also St. Luke’s own phrase, Act 4:6 ) that Annas, as <em> ex-high-priest</em> , and possibly retaining in the view of the Jews the <em> legitimate high-priesthood</em> , was <em> counted still as having the office:</em> he certainly ( Joh 18:13 ) <em> exercised the power</em> , and had influence enough to procure the actual high-priesthood for <em> five of his sons</em> , after his own deposition, Jos. Antt. xx. 9. 1.

<p>A substitute, or deputy to the high-priest (called by the Talmudists סְנַן כֹּהֲנַיָּא ), appears to have been usual, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+25:18">2 Kings 25:18</span> ; and Annas would thus be able to evade the Roman appointment and keep the authority.
