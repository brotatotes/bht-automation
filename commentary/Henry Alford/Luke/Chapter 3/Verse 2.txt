It would appear from this verse (and the use of the singular—see margin—renders the inference more stringent. Compare also St. Luke's own phrase, Acts iv. 6) that Annas, as<i> ex-high priest,</i> and possibly retaining in the view of the Jews the<i> legitimate high priesthood,</i> was<i> counted still as having the office:</i> he certainly (John xviii. 13)<i> exercised the power,</i>—and had influence enough to procure the actual high priesthood for<i> five of his sons,</i> after his own deposition, Jos.
