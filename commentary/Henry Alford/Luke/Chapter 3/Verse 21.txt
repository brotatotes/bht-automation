</b>Matt. iii, 13–17. Mark i. 9–11. St. Luke’s account is much more concise than usual, and wholly independent of the others; see note on Mark i. 10: we have here however three additional particulars—1. that<i> all the people had been baptised</i><i> before</i> the Lord’s baptism: 2. that He<i> was praying</i> at the time of the descent of the Spirit: 8. that the Spirit appeared<i> in a bodily form.</i> On (3), see note at Matt. iii. 16,§2.
