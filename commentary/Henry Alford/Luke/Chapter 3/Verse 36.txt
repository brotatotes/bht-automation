<p><strong> 36. </strong> <strong> Καϊνάμ</strong> ] This name does not exist in our present Hebrew text, but in the LXX, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+10:24">Genesis 10:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+11:12-13">Genesis 11:12-13</span> , and furnishes a curious instance of one of two things either (1) the corruption of our present Hebrew text in these chronological passages; or (2) the incorrectness of the LXX, and notwithstanding that, the high reputation which it had obtained in so short a time. Lightfoot holds the latter alternative: but I own I think the former more probable. See on the whole question of the appearance of this second Cainam(n) among the ancestors of our Lord, Lord A. Hervey’s work above cited, ch. 8, in which, with much research and acuteness, he has endeavoured to shew that the name was probably interpolated here, and got from hence into the LXX. Certainly it appears not to have existed in the earliest copies of that version.</p>
