Luke’s account is much more concise than usual, and wholly independent of the others; see note on Mark 1:10 ; we have here however three additional particulars 1. that  all the people had been baptized before the Lord’s baptism: 2. that He  was praying at the time of the descent of the Spirit: 3. that the Spirit appeared  in a bodily form . On (1) we may remark that this is necessarily the meaning of ἐν τῷ βαπ . for Luke when he means ‘during,’ &c. invariably uses the  present; see for the past tense with ἐν τῷ reff. and ch. Luke 14:1 ; Luke 19:15 ; Luk 24:30 for the present, ch. Luke 5:1 ; Luke 8:5 , &c., and for a comparison of the two, ch. Luke 8:40 ; Luke 8:42 .
