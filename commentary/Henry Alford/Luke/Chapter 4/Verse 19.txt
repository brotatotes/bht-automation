<b> 19. the acceptable year of the Lord</b>] See Levit. xxv. 8–17, where in ver. 10 we find that liberty was proclaimed to all in the land in the year of jubilee. No countenance is given by this expression to the extraordinary inference from it of some of the Fathers (Clement of Alexandria, Origen), that the Lord’s public ministry lasted<i> only a year, and something over.</i> Compare John ii. 13; vi. 4; xiii. 1.
