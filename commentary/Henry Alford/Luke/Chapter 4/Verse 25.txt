<b> 25.</b>] Our Lord brings forward instances where the two greatest prophets in Israel were<i> not directed to act in accordance with the proverb,</i> ‘Physician,<br><br> heal thyself:’ but their miraculous powers exerted on those who were strangers to God’s inheritance.<br><br><b> three years and six months</b>] So also in James v. 17;—but in 1 Kings xviii. 1 we find that it was is<i> in the third year</i> that the Lord commanded Elijah to shew himself to Ahab, for He would send rain on the earth. But it does not appear from what time this third year is reckoned,—or at what time of the year, with reference to the usual former and latter rains, the drought caused by Elijah’s prayer began [it apparently had begun some time before the prophet was sent to be miraculously sustained, as this very fact implies failure of the ordinary means of sustenance]; and thus, without forming any further hypothesis, we have latitude enough given for the three and a half years, which seems to have been the exact time. This period is one often recurring in Jewish record and in prophecy: see Daniel vii. 25; xii. 7: Rev. xi. 2, 3; xii. 6, 14; xiii. 5. Lightfoot produces more instances from the Rabbinical writers. “The period of<i> three years and a half,</i> = 42 months or 1260 days, had an ominous sound in the ears of an Israelite, being the time of this famine, and of the duration of the desolation of the temple under Antiochus.” Wordsw.
