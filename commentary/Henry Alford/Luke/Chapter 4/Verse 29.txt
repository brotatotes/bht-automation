The same sort of rage possessed the Jews, Acts xxii. 22, on a similar truth being announced to them. This whole occurrence, whenever it happened in our Lord’s ministry, was but a foreshadowing of His treatment afterwards from the nation of the Jews—a foretaste of<i> “He came unto his own, and his own received him snot”</i> (John i. 11).<br><br>The modern Nazareth is at a distance of about two English miles from what is called the Mount of Precipitation; nor is it built literally on the<i> brow</i> of that mount or hill. But (1) neither does the narrative preclude a considerable distance having been traversed, during which they had our Lord in their custody, and were hurrying with him to the edge of the ravine; nor (2) is it at all necessary to suppose the city built on the<i> brow,</i> but only on the mountain, or range of hills, of which the<i> brow</i> forms a part—which it is.
