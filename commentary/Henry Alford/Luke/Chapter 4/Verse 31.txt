 31 f. ] Mark 1:21-22 . The view maintained with regard to the foregoing occurrence in the preceding notes, of course precludes the notion that it was the  reason of our Lord’s change of habitation to Capernaum . In fact that change, as remarked on Luke 4:14 , had been made  some time before: and it is hardly possible that such an expression as ἦλθ . εἰς τὴν Ν . οὗ ἦν τεθραμμένος should be used, if He still resided there. The words  πόλιν τῆς Γ  . come in unnaturally after the mention of Καφαρν . in Luke 4:23 , and evidently shew that  this was originally intended to be the first mention of the place.
	What may have been the reason of the change of abode is quite uncertain. It seems to have included the whole family, except the sisters, who may have been married at Nazareth, see note on John 2:12 , and Matthew 4:13 .
	 κατῆλθ  ., κατέβη John 2:12 , because Nazareth lay high, and Capernaum on the sea of Galilee. The expression καὶ οὐχ ὡς οἱ γραμματεῖς (Mark) is not added by Luke: see Matthew 7:29 .
