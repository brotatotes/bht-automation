<b> 31 f.</b>]<b> Mark</b> i. 21, 22. The view maintained with regard to the foregoing occurrence in the preceding notes, of course precludes the notion that it<b> was</b> the<i> reason of our Lord’s change of habitation to Capernaum.</i> In fact that change, as remarked on ver. 14, had been made<i> some time before:</i> and it is hardly possibly that such an expression as<i> “He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up,”</i> should be used, if He still resided there. The words<b> a city of Galilee</b> come in unnaturally after the mention of Capernaum in ver. 23, and evidently shew<br><br> that<i> this</i> was originally intended to be the first mention of the place.<br><br> What may have been the reason of the change of abode is quite uncertain. It seems to have included the whole family, except the sisters, who may have been married at Nazareth,—see note on John ii. 12, and Matt. iv. 18.<b> came down,</b>—see also John ii. 12,—because Nazareth lay high, and Capernaum on the sea of Galilee.
