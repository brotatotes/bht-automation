The view maintained with regard to the foregoing occurrence in the preceding notes, of course precludes the notion that it was the <em> reason of our Lord’s change of habitation to Capernaum</em> . In fact that change, as remarked on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:14">Luke 4:14</span> , had been made <em> some time before:</em> and it is hardly possible that such an expression as ἦλθ . εἰς τὴν Ν . οὗ ἦν τεθραμμένος should be used, if He still resided there. The words <strong> πόλιν τῆς Γ</strong> <strong> .</strong> come in unnaturally after the mention of Καφαρν . in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:23">Luke 4:23</span> , and evidently shew that <em> this</em> was originally intended to be the first mention of the place.

<p>What may have been the reason of the change of abode is quite uncertain. It seems to have included the whole family, except the sisters, who may have been married at Nazareth, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:12">John 2:12</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:13">Matthew 4:13</span> .

The expression καὶ οὐχ ὡς οἱ γραμματεῖς (Mark) is not added by Luke: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:29">Matthew 7:29</span> .</p>
