 1 13. ] TEMPTATION OF JESUS. Matthew 4:1-11 .Mark 1:12-13; Mark 1:12-13 .
	Luk 4:1 is peculiar to Luke, and very important. Our Lord was now full of the Holy Ghost, and in that fulness He is led up to combat with the enemy. He has arrived at the fulness of the stature of perfect man, outwardly and spiritually. And as when His Church was inaugurated by the descent of the Spirit in His fulness, so now, the first and fittest weapon for the combat is “the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” The discourse of Peter in Acts 2:0 , like our Lord’s replies here, is grounded in the testimony of the Scripture.
	The accounts of Matt. and Luke (Mark’s is principally a compendium) are distinct: see notes on Matt. and Mark.
