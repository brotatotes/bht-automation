<p><strong> 28 30.</strong> ] The same sort of rage possessed the Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:22">Acts 22:22</span> , on a similar truth being announced to them. This whole occurrence, whenever it happened in our Lord’s ministry, was but a foreshadowing of His treatment afterwards from the whole nation of the Jews a foretaste of εἰς τὰ ἴδια ἦλθεν , καὶ οἱ ἴδιοι αὐτὸν οὐ παρέλαβον ( Joh 1:11 ). The expression of St. Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span> , πώρωσις ἀπὸ μέρους τῷ Ἰσραὴλ γέγονεν , has been regarded as corresponding with the judicial infliction on these Nazarenes, by means of which our Lord passed out from among them. But see my note, and Ellicott’s, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:18">Ephesians 4:18</span> , from which it appears that πώρωσις cannot mean <em> blindness</em> at all.

<p>The modern Nazareth is at a distance of about two English miles from what is called the Mount of Precipitation; nor is it built literally on the <em> brow</em> of that mount or hill. But (1) neither does the narrative preclude a considerable distance having been traversed, during which they had our Lord in their custody, and were hurrying with Him to the edge of the ravine; nor (2) is it at all necessary to suppose the city built on the ὀφρύς , but only on the mountain, or range of hills, of which the ὀφρύς forms a part which it is: see Robinson, iii. 187.

<p>Our Lord’s passing through the midst of them is <em> evidently miraculous:</em> the circumstances were different from those in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:59">John 8:59</span> , where the expression is ἐκρύβη καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τ . ἱεροῦ : see note there. Here, the Nazarenes had Him actually <em> in their custody</em> .</p>
