<p><strong> 10. </strong> <strong> ἔσῃ ζωγρῶν</strong> ] Compare, and indeed throughout this miracle, the striking parallel, and yet contrast, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:0">John 21:0</span> with its injunction, <em> ‘feed My lambs,’ ‘shepherd My sheep,’</em> given to the same Peter; its net which <em> did not burst:</em> and the minute and beautiful appropriateness of each will be seen: this, at, or near, the commencement of the Apostolic course; that, at how different, and how fitting a time!
	</p>
<p>It is perhaps too subtle, and hardly accordant with the rules of emphasis, to find (with Me [48] . and Stier) a fitness in <strong> ζωγρῶν</strong> as expressing the ethical catching of men. I prefer taking it as the word common to both acts merely as <strong> catch</strong> .
