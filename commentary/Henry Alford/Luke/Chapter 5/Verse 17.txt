	 δύν  .   κυρ  . ] Does this mean  the power of God or  the power of the Lord , i.e. Jesus? Me [49] . remarks that Luke uses κύριος frequently for Jesus, but always with the article: see ch. Luke 7:13 ; Luke 10:1 ; Luke 11:39 ; Luke 12:42 , alli [50] . fr.: but the same word, without the article, for  the Most High; see ch. Luke 1:11 ; Luke 1:38 ; Luke 1:58 ; Luke 1:66 ; Luke 2:9 ; Luke 4:19 ; whence we conclude that the meaning is,  the power of God (working in the Lord Jesus)  was in the direction of His healing: i.e. wrought so that He exercised the powers of healing: and then a case follows. For construction, see reff.

	 αὐτόν has apparently been altered to αὐτούς from its difficulty. It might indeed be said that - ους may have been altered to - ον from the apparent difficulty of all these mentioned needing healing.
