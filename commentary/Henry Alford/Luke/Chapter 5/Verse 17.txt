<p><strong> δύν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κυρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Does this mean <em> the power of God</em> or <em> the power of the Lord</em> , i.e. Jesus? Me [49] . remarks that Luke uses κύριος frequently for Jesus, but always with the article: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:13">Luke 7:13</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:39">Luke 11:39</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:42">Luke 12:42</span> , alli [50] . fr.: but the same word, without the article, for <em> the Most High;</em> see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:11">Luke 1:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:38">Luke 1:38</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:58">Luke 1:58</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:66">Luke 1:66</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:9">Luke 2:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:19">Luke 4:19</span> ; whence we conclude that the meaning is, <strong> the power of God</strong> (working in the Lord Jesus) <strong> was in the direction of His healing:</strong> i.e. wrought so that He exercised the powers of healing: and then a case follows. For construction, see reff.

<p><strong> αὐτόν</strong> has apparently been altered to αὐτούς from its difficulty. It might indeed be said that - ους may have been altered to - ον from the apparent difficulty of all these mentioned needing healing. So uncertain are merely subjective considerations either way: and so necessary is it to adhere in such cases, where any uncertainty exists, simply and faithfully to antiquity, as our best existing guide.</p>
