 36. ] The latter part of this verse is peculiar, and is to be thus understood: ‘  if he does, he both will rend the new garment ’ (by taking out of it the ἐπίβλημα ), ‘  and the piece from the new garment will not agree with the old .’ The common interpretation (which makes τὸ καινόν the nom. to σχίσει , and understands τὸ παλαιόν as its accus.) is inconsistent with the construction, in which τὸ καινόν is to be coupled with ἱμάτιον , not with ἐπίβλημα . In Matt. and Mark the mischief done is differently expressed. Our text is very significant, and represents to us the spoiling of both systems by an attempt to engraft the new upon the old: the  new loses its completeness; the  old , its consistency.
