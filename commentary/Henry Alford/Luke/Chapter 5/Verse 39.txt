<p><strong> 39.</strong> ] This peculiar and important addition at once stamps our report with the very highest character for accuracy. Its apparent difficulty has perhaps caused its omission from Cod. [52] and mss. of the old Latin version. It contains the <em> conclusion of the discourse</em> , and the <em> final answer</em> to the question in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:33">Luke 5:33</span> , which is not given in Matt. and Mark. The <strong> πιόντες παλαιόν</strong> are <em> the Jews</em> , who had long been habituated to the old system; the <strong> νέος</strong> is the new wine (see on Matt.) of the <em> grace and freedom of the Gospel:</em> and our Lord asserts that this new wine was <em> not palatable</em> to the Jews, who said <strong> ὁ παλαιὸς χρηστός ἐστιν</strong> <strong> .</strong> Observe (against De Wette, &amp;c.) that even with the common reading χρηστότερος there is <em> no objective comparison whatever</em> here between the old and new wine; the whole stress is on <strong> θέλει</strong> and <strong> λέγει γάρ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and the import of χρηστότερος is <em> subjective:</em> <em> in the view of him who utters it</em> . And even if we were to assume such an objective comparison, it makes no difficulty. In time, the <em> new</em> wine will become <em> older:</em> the man will become habituated to its taste, and the wine itself mellowed: and the comparison between the wines is not then which is the <em> older</em> , but which is intrinsically the <em> better</em> .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [52] The CODEX CANTABRIGIENSIS, or BEZÆ, so called because it was presented by Beza in 1581 to the University Library at Cambridge; where it is now exposed to view in a glass case. He procured it in 1562, from the monastery of St. Irenæus at Lyons. It is on parchment, and contains the Gospels and Acts, with a Latin version. Its lacunæ, which are many, will be perceived by the inner marginal letters in this edition. It once contained the Catholic Epistles: 3Jn 1:11-14 in Latin is all that now remains. It was edited with very accurate imitative types, at the expense of the University of Cambridge, by Dr. Kipling, in 1793. A new edition carefully revised and more generally accessible was published by Mr. Scrivener in 1864, and has been collated for this Edition. In the introduction some ten or twelve correctors are distinguished, whose readings are found in the notes at the end of the volume. The text of the Codex Bezæ is a very peculiar one, deviating more from the received readings and from the principal manuscript authorities than any other. It appears to have been written in France, and by a Latin transcriber ignorant of Greek, from many curious mistakes which occur in the text, and version attached. It is closely and singularly allied to the ancient Latin versions, so much so that some critics have supposed it to have been altered from the Latin: and certainly many of the phænomena of the MS. seem to bear out the idea. Where D differs in unimportant points from the other Greek MSS., the difference appears to be traceable to the influence of Latin forms and constructions. It has been observed, that in such cases it frequently agrees with the Latin codex <em> e</em> (see the list further on). Its peculiarities are so great, that in many passages, while the sense remains for the most part unaltered, hardly three words together are the same as in the commonly received text. And that these variations often arise from capricious alteration, is evident from the way in which the Gospels, in parallel passages, have been more than commonly interpolated from one another in this MS. The concurrence with the ancient Latin versions seems to point to a very early state of the text; and it is impossible to set aside the value of D as an index to its history; but in critical weight it ranks the lowest of the leading MSS. Its age has been very variously given: the general opinion now is that it was written in the <em> latter end of the fifth or the sixth century</em> .

<p>Stier observes (i. 328), that the saying is a lesson for ardent and enthusiastic converts not to be disappointed, if they cannot at once instil their spirit into others about them.

<p>As regards the <em> readings</em> , the sentence seems to have been tampered with by some who wished to make it more obvious, and to bring out the <em> comparison</em> more strongly: εὐθέως being inserted, better to correspond with the fact, and the matter in question, and the comparative substituted for the positive: but the sentence loses much of its point and vigour by the change: the old wine is not <em> better than the new</em> (which has <em> not been tasted</em> ), but merely <strong> good,</strong> i.e. <em> good enough:</em> therefore no new is desired.</p>
