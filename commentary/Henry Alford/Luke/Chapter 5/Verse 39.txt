<b> 39.</b>] This peculiar and important addition at once stamps our report with the very highest character for accuracy. Its apparent difficulty has perhaps caused its omission from some of our ancient authorities. It contains the<i> conclusion of the discourse,</i> and the<i> final answer</i> to the question in ver. 33, which is not given in Matthew and Mark. The<i> persons who had drunk the old wine are the Jews</i>, who had long been habituated to the old system;—the new is the new wine (see on Matthew) of the<i> grace and freedom of the Gospel:</i> and our Lord asserts that this new wine was not<i> palatable</i> to the Jews, who said the<b> old is better</b> (or,<b> good</b>). Observe that there is<i> no objective comparison whatever</i> here between the old and new wine; the whole stress is on<b> desireth</b> and<b> for he saith,</b> and the import of<b> better is</b><i> subjective:</i>—<i>in the view of him who utters it.</i> And even if we were to assume such an objective comparison, it makes no difficulty. In time, the<i> new</i> wine will become<i> older;</i>—the man will become habituated to its taste, and the wine itself mellowed: and the comparison between the wines is not then which is the<i> older,</i> but which is intrinsically the<i> better.</i><br><br> Stier observes, that the saying isa lesson for ardent and enthusiastic converts not to be disappointed, if they cannot at once instil their spirit into others about them.
