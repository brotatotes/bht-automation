<b> 8.</b>]<b> Depart from me, i.e. from my ship.</b> The speech is in exact keeping with the quick discernment, and expression of feeling, of Peter's character. Similar sayings are found Exod. xx. 18, 19; Judg. xiii. 22; 1 Kings xvii. 18; Isa. vi. 5; Dan. x. 17.<br><br> This sense of unworthiness and self-loathing is ever the effect, in the depths of a heart not utterly hardened, of the Divine Power and presence. “Below this, is the utterly profane state, in which there is no contrast, no contradiction felt, between the holy and the unholy, between God and man. Above it, is the state of grace, in which the contradiction is felt, between the deep gulf perceived, which divides between sinful man and an holy God,—yet it is felt that this gulf is bridged over,—that it is possible for the two to meet,—that in One, who is sharer with both, they have already been brought together.” Trench on the Miracles. The same writer remarks of the miracle itself, “Christ here appears as the<i> ideal man,</i> the second Adam of the eighth Psalm; ‘Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; thou hast put all things under His feet.... the fowl of the air, and the fish of the<b> sea,</b> and whatsoever walketh through the paths of the seas’ (vv. 6, 8).”
