 17 26. ] HEALING OF A PARALYTIC. Matthew 9:2-8 . Mark 2:1-12 . This miracle is introduced by the indefinite words, καὶ ἐγ . ἐν μιᾷ τ . ἡμ .: see reff. In Mat 8:5 to Matthew 9:1 , a series of incidents are interposed. Our Lord there appears to have returned from the country of the Gadarenes and the miracle on the dæmoniac there, to ‘  His own city ,’ i.e. Capernaum. The order in Mark is the same as here, and his narrative contains the only decisive note of sequence (ch. Luk 4:35 ), which determines his order and that in the text to have been the actual one, and the events in Matthew 8:0 to be related out of their order.
