<b> 12.</b>]<b> in these days</b> is vague in date, and may belong to any part of the period of our Lord’s ministry now before us. I believe it to be a form of acknowledgment on the part of the Evangelist, that<i> he did not determine exactly into what part of this period to bring the incident so introduced.</i> Indeed the whole of this paragraph is of a supplementary and indefinite character, serving more as a preface to the discourse which follows, than as this and the cognate, though independent, account of Mark.<br><br><b> went out</b>—viz. from Capernaum.<br><br><b> the mountain</b>—see on Matt. v. 1.<br><br><b> to pray</b>—see note on ch. v. 16.<br><br><b> and continued all night in his prayer to God</b>] This is the right rendering. The fancy that by the words rendered<i> “in his prayer to God”</i> is meant in a house of prayer, is quite baseless.
