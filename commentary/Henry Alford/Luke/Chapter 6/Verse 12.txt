<b> 12.</b>]<b> in these days</b> is vague in date, and may belong to any part of the period of our Lordâ€™s ministry now before us. I believe it to be a form of acknowledgment on the part of the Evangelist, that<i> he did not determine exactly into what part of this period to bring the incident so introduced.</i> Indeed the whole of this paragraph is of a supplementary and indefinite character, serving more as a preface to the discourse which follows, than as this and the cognate, though independent, account of Mark.
