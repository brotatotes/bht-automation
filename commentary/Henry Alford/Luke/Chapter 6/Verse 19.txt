Comparing these expressions with other passages in St. Luke himself, we must have concluded,<i> even without St. Matthew's re-port,</i> that they bore<i> a spiritual</i> sense; see ch. xvi. 11, where he speaks of<i> ‘the true</i> riches,’ and ch. xii. 21, where we have<b> rich towards</b><b> God</b>.
