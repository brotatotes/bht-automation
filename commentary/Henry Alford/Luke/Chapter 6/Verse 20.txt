 20.   εἰς τοὺς μ  . ] The discourse was spoken to the disciples generally, to the Twelve particularly, to the people prospectively; and its subject, both here and in Matt., is,  the state and duties of a disciple of Christ .
	 πτωχοί ] To suppose that Luke’s report of this discourse refers  only to this world’s poverty, &c. and the blessings to anticipated  outward prosperity in the Messiah’s Kingdom (De Wette, Meyer), is surely quite a misapprehension. Comparing these expressions with other passages in Luke himself, we must have concluded,  even without Matthew’s report , that they bore a  spiritual sense: see ch. Luke 16:11 , where he speaks of ‘  the true riches,’ and ch. Luke 12:21 , where we have  εἰς θεὸν πλουτῶν . And who would apply such an interpretation to our Luk 6:21 ?
	See on each of these beatitudes the corresponding notes in Matt.
	 ἡ βασ  .   τ  .   θ  . = ἡ βασ . τ . οὐρανῶν Matt., but it does not thence follow that αὐρανοί = θεός , but the two are different ways of designating the same kingdom the one by its situation  in heaven , where its πολιτεία is ( ἡ ἄνω Ἰερουσαλήμ , Gal 4:26 ), the other by  Him , whose it is.
