<b> 26.</b>] Not said to the<i> rich,</i> but to the<i> disciples.</i> The very warning conveyed<b> false prophets</b> shews this, and should have prevented the blunder from being made. The mention of<i> “prophets”</i> and<i> “false prophets”</i> has reference to the disciples’ office as the salt of the earth. The address in ver. 27 is not (Meyer) a turning of the discourse to His own disciples, but<b> I say unto you which hear</b> is equivalent to<i> “But I say unto you,”</i> which introduces the same command Matt. iv. 44,—and<b> that hear</b> serves the purpose of the<b> I—to you who now hear me.</b> The discourse being in an abridged form, the strong antithesis could not be brought out.
