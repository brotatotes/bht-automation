The address in Luk 6:27 is not (Meyer) a turning of the discourse to His own disciples, but  ὑμῖν λέγω τοῖς ἀκούουσιν = ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω ὑμῖν , which introduces the same command Matthew 5:44 , and τοῖς ἀκούουσιν serves the purpose of the ἐγώ  to you who now hear Me. The discourse being mutilated, the strong antithesis could not be brought out.
