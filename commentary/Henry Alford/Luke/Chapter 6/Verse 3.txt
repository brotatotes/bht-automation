<b> 3.</b>]<b> Have ye not so much as this?</b> i.e. ‘Are ye so utterly ignorant of the spirit of Scripture?’ See Mark xii. 10, where the same expression occurs. In one of our ancient authorities, the Cambridge MS., the following is the form of ver. 5:<b> On the same day he beheld a certain man working on the sabbath, and said unto him, O man, if thou knowest what thou art doing, blessed art thou: but if thou knowest not, accursed, and a transgressor of the law.</b> This remarkable substitution seems to be an interpolation, but hardly an invention of a later time. Its form and contents speak for its originality, and, I am disposed to believe, its authenticity.
