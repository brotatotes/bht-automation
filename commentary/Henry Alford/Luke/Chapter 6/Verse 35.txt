<b> 35. hoping for nothing</b>] The original word is a difficult one. Three renderings of it have been given— (1) the ordinary one, as in the text,<i> not expecting any payment from them:</i> so Euthymius and others. This meaning of the word is unexampled, though agreeing with the context. (2)<i> ‘causing no one to despair,’</i> i.e. refusing no one; so the ancient Syriac version renders it. (3)<i> ‘not despairing,’</i> i.e.<i> ‘without anxiety about the result.’</i> This last sense of the word is best supported by examples.

But surely this is sufficiently answered by your Father in the next verse, where the actual present sonship to our heavenly Father is a reason why we should imitate Him.
