<b> 39.</b>] From this verse to the end is in the closest connexion, and it it impossible that it should consist of sayings thrown together and uttered at different times.<br><br> The connexion with what went before is not so evident, indeed the<b> spake a parable unto them seems to shew a break.</b> The parabolic saying, implying the unfitness of an uncharitable and unjustly condemning leader (the Lord was speaking<b> primarily to His Apostles</b>) to perform his office, leads to the assertion [ver. 40] that no Christian ought to assume in this respect an office of judging which<i> his Master never assumed;</i> but rather will every well-instructed Christian strive to be humble as his Master was. Then follows the reproof of vv. 41–43; and vv. 44, 45 and 46–49 shew us, expanded in different images, what<i> the beam</i> in the eye is, to which our first efforts must be directed.<br><br><b> Can the blind lead the blind?]</b><br><br> See this in quite another connexion, Matt. xv. 14, where Peter answers,<i> “Declare unto us this parable”</i>—meaning apparently<i> the last uttered words,</i> which the Lord however explains not specifically, but by entering into the whole matter. I believe this<i> parable</i> to have been one of the usual and familiar sayings of our Lord.
