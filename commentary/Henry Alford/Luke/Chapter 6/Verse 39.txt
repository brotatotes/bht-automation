<p><strong> 39.</strong> ] From this verse to the end is in the closest connexion, and it is impossible that it should consist of sayings thrown together and uttered at different times.

<p>The connexion with what went before is not so evident, indeed the εἶπεν δὲ π . αὐτ . seems to shew a break. The parabolic saying, implying the unfitness of an uncharitable and unjustly condemning leader (the Lord was speaking <em> primarily to His Apostles</em> ) to perform his office, leads to the assertion ( Luk 6:40 ) that no Christian ought to assume in this respect an office of judging which <em> his Master never assumed;</em> but rather will every well-instructed Christian strive to be humble as his Master was. Then follows the reproof of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:41-43">Luke 6:41-43</span> ; and Luk 6:44-49 shew us, expanded in different images, what <em> the beam</em> in the eye is, to which our first efforts must be directed.

<p><strong> τυφλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] See this in quite another connexion, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:14">Matthew 15:14</span> , where Peter answers, φράσον ἡμῖν τὴν παραβολὴν [ ταύτην ] meaning apparently <em> the last uttered words</em> , which the Lord however explains not specifically, but by entering into the whole matter. I believe this παραβολή to have been one of the usual and familiar sayings of our Lord.</p>
