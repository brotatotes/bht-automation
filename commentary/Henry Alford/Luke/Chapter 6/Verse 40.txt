<p><strong> 40.</strong> ] See above. <strong> κατηρτισμένος</strong> (see reff.) <strong> fully instructed perfect,</strong> in the sense of ‘well-conditioned,’ knowing what is his duty, and consistently endeavouring to do it. De Wette, Kuinoel, &amp;c., have given a strange rendering of this clause, making <strong> κατηρτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὡς ὁ δ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> the predicate ‘every disciple will be instructed as his Master.’ But if I mistake not, the position of κατηρτ . as first in the sentence forbids this rendering.</p>
