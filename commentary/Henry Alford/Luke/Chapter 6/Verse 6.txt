<b> 6.</b>] The circumstances related in ch. xiv. 1–6 are very similar to these; and there St. Luke has inserted the question of Matthew, vv. 11, 12. I should be disposed to think that St. Mark and St. Luke have preserved the exact narrative here. St. Matthew, as we eee, describes the<i> watching</i> of the Pharisees (<b>their thoughts,</b> or reasonings, ver. 8) as<i> words actually spoken,</i> and relates that<i> they</i> asked the question: which certainly arises from an imperfect report of what took place, the question itself being verbatim that which our Lord asked on that other occasion, Luke xiv. 3, and followed by a similar appeal about an animal. There can hardly be a doubt that in St. Matthew’s narrative the two occurrences are blended: and this may have taken place from the very circumstance of the question about an animal having been asked on both occasions; St. Luke omitting it here, because he reports it there—St. Matthew joining to it the question asked there, because he was not aware of another similar incident.<br><br><b> right hand</b> is a mark of accuracy, and from an eye-witness.
