 6. ] The circumstances related in ch. Luk 14:1-6 are very similar to these; and there Luke has inserted the question of Matthew 12:11-12 . I should be disposed to think that Mark and Luke have preserved the exact narrative here. Matthew, as we see, describes the  watching of the Pharisees ( τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς αὐτῶν , Luke, Luk 6:8 ) as  words actually spoken , and relates that  they asked the question: which certainly arises from an imperfect report of what took place, the question itself being verbatim that which our Lord asked on that other occasion, Luke 14:3 , and followed by a similar appeal about an animal. There can hardly be a doubt that in Matthew’s narrative the two occurrences are blended: and this may have taken place from the very circumstance of the question about an animal having been asked on both occasions; Luke omitting it here, because he reports it there Matthew joining to it the question asked there, because he was not aware of another similar incident.
