<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] The circumstances related in ch. Luk 14:1-6 are very similar to these; and there Luke has inserted the question of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:11-12">Matthew 12:11-12</span> . I should be disposed to think that Mark and Luke have preserved the exact narrative here. Matthew, as we see, describes the <em> watching</em> of the Pharisees ( τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς αὐτῶν , Luke, Luk 6:8 ) as <em> words actually spoken</em> , and relates that <em> they</em> asked the question: which certainly arises from an imperfect report of what took place, the question itself being verbatim that which our Lord asked on that other occasion, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:3">Luke 14:3</span> , and followed by a similar appeal about an animal. There can hardly be a doubt that in Matthew’s narrative the two occurrences are blended: and this may have taken place from the very circumstance of the question about an animal having been asked on both occasions; Luke omitting it here, because he reports it there Matthew joining to it the question asked there, because he was not aware of another similar incident.
