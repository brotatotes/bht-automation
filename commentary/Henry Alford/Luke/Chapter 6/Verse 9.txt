<p><strong> 9.</strong> ] The words in the re [57] . text, ἐπ . ὑμᾶς τί ἔξεστιν , admit of two constructions according as they are punctuated: ‘I will ask you <em> what is allowable on the sabbath, to do good, or to do evil?</em> ’ ( ἐπ . ὑμ . τί ἔξ . κ . τ . λ .); or, ‘I will ask you a certain thing: <em> Is it</em> ,’ &amp;c. ( ἐπ . ὑμ . τι · ἔξ . κ . τ . λ .) This latter is preferable, both on account of the future ἐπερ ., and of its similarity to ἐρωτήσω ὑμᾶς κἀγὼ λόγον , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:3">Luke 20:3</span> . But the reading in the text is much preferable to either. After the question, Mark adds οἱ δὲ ἐσιώπων as they did after the question just referred to in ch. 20, because they were in a dilemma, and either answer would have convicted them.
