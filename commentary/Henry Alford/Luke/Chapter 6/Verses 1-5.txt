 1 5. ] THE DISCIPLES PLUCK EARS OF CORN ON THE SABBATH. Matthew 12:1-8 . Mark 2:23-28 . Between the discourse just related here and in Mark, and this incident, Matthew interposes  the raising of Jaeirusâ€™s daughter, the healing of the two blind and one dumb, the mission of the twelve, and the message of John . I need not insist on these obvious proofs of independence in the construction of our Gospels.
	On the question of the arrangements, see on Matt.
