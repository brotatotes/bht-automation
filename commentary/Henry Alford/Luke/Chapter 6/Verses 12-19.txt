 12 19. ] CALLING AND NAMES OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES.  Peculiar (in this form)  to Luke: see Matthew 12:15-21 ; Mark 3:13-19 . We may observe that Matt. does not relate the  choosing of the Apostles, but only takes occasion to give a list of them on their being sent out, ch. Luke 10:1 ff.; and that Mark and Luke agree in the time of their being chosen, placing it immediately after the healing on the sabbath, but with no very definite note of time.
