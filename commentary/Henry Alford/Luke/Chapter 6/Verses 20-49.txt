 20 49. ] SERMON ON THE MOUNT (?).  Peculiar (in this form)  to Luke , answering to Matthew 5-7. On the whole question of the identity or diversity of the two discourses, see on Matthew 5:1 . In Matthew I cannot doubt that we have  the whole discourse much as it was spoken; the connexion is intimate throughout; the arrangement wonderfully consistent and admirable. Here, on the other hand, the discourse is only reported in fragments there is a wide gap between Luke 6:26-27 , and many omissions in other parts; besides which, sayings of our Lord, belonging apparently to other occasions, are inserted: see Luke 6:39-40 ; Luke 6:45 . At the same time we must remember, that such gnomic sayings would probably be frequently uttered by Him, and might very likely form part of this discourse originally. His teaching was not studious of novelty like that of men, but speaking with authority, as He did, He would doubtless utter again and again the same weighty sentences when occasion occurred. Hence may have arisen much of the difference of arrangement observable in the reports because sayings known to have been uttered together at one time, might be thrown together with sayings spoken at another, with some one common link perhaps connecting the two groups.
