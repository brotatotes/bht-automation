<p><strong> 11. </strong> <strong> ἐν τῇ ἑξῆς</strong> ] With regard to the variety of reading here, Schulz remarks that St. Luke, when χρόνῳ is understood, uses <strong> ἐν τῷ καθεξῆς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:1">Luke 8:1</span> . On the other hand Meyer observes that when ἡμέρᾳ is understood, he never prefixes ἐν : see reff.: so that internal as well as external evidence is divided.

<p>NAIN occurs no where else in the Bible. It was a town of Galilee not far from Capernaum, a few miles to the south of Mount Tabor, ‘on the northern slope of the rugged and barren ridge of Little Hermon,’ Stanley. A poor village has been found in this situation with ruins of old buildings. See Robinson, iii. 226. The κώμη καλουμένη Ναΐν (or Ναΐς ) of Josephus, B. J. iv. 9. 4, on the borders of Idumea, is a different place. See Winer, Realw.; and Stanley’s description, Sinai and Palestine, p. 357, edn. <strong> 3.
