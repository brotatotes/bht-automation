 11.   ἐν τῇ ἑξῆς ] With regard to the variety of reading here, Schulz remarks that St. Luke, when χρόνῳ is understood, uses  ἐν τῷ καθεξῆς  , see ch. Luke 8:1 .

	NAIN occurs no where else in the Bible. It was a town of Galilee not far from Capernaum, a few miles to the south of Mount Tabor, ‘on the northern slope of the rugged and barren ridge of Little Hermon,’ Stanley. A poor village has been found in this situation with ruins of old buildings. See Robinson, iii. 226. The κώμη καλουμένη Ναΐν (or Ναΐς ) of Josephus, B. J. iv. 9. 4, on the borders of Idumea, is a different place. See Winer, Realw.; and Stanley’s description, Sinai and Palestine, p. 357, edn.  3.
