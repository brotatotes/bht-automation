Man, as a conscious being, can never be a<i> mere means</i> to an end, which would here be the case, if we suppose the consolation of the mother to have been the only object for which the young man<b> was raised</b>.” He goes on to say that the hidden intent was probably the spiritual awakening of the youth; which would impart a deeper meaning to<b> delivered him to his mother</b>, and make her joy to be a true and abiding one.
