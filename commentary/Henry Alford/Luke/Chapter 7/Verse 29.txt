It has been imagined that these words are a continuation of our Lord’s discourse, but surely they would thus be most unnatural. They are evidently a parenthetical insertion of the Evangelist, expressive not of what had taken place during John’s baptism, but of the present effect of our Lord’s discourse on the then assembled multitude. Their whole diction and form is<i> historical</i>, not belonging to discourse. See likewise a grammatical objection to this rendering in my Greek Test.
