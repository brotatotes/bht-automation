<b> 36.]</b> The exact time and place are indeterminate—the occasion of St. Luke's inserting the history here may have been the<b> friend of publicans and sinners</b> in<b></b> ver. 34. Wieseler places it<i> at Nain</i>, which certainly is the last<i> city</i> that has been named: but it is more natural to suppose<b> in the city</b> to refer only to<b> the house</b> before—the city where the house was. Meyer thinks that the definite article points out Capernaum. The position of the words<b> in the city</b> in the amended text requires a different rendering from ‘a woman in the city which was a sinner.’ We must either render, ‘which was a sinner in the city,’ i.e. known as such in the place by public repute,—carrying on a sinful occupation in the place,—or (2) regard<b> which was in the city</b> as parenthetic, ‘a woman which was in the city, a sinner.’ The latter seems prefer-able.
