Our Lord would, after the ordinary custom of persons at table, be reclining on a couch, on the left side, turned towards the table, and His feet would be behind Him. She seems to have embraced His feet (see Matt. xxviii. 9), as it was also the Jews’ custom to do by way of honour and affection to their Rabbis (see Wetstein on this passage), and kissed them, and in doing so to have shed abundant tears, which, falling on them, she wiped off with her hair. From the form of expression in the original (see in my Greek Test.), it does not appear that this latter was an<i> intentional</i> part of her honouring our Lord. It was the tears, implied in the word<b> weeping,—the tears which she shed</b>,—not<i> ‘her tears,’</i> which would be otherwise expressed. The<i> ointment</i> here has a peculiar interest, as being the offering by a penitent of that which had been an accessory in her unhallowed work of sin.
