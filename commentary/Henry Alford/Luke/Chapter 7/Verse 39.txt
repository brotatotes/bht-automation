 39.   εἶπ  .   ἐν ἑαυ λέγων ] This phraseology is perhaps a mark of translation from the Hebrew.
	The Pharisee  assumes that our Lord did not know who, or of what sort, this woman was, and thence doubts His being a prophet (see Luk 7:16 ); the possibility of His  knowing this and permitting it , never so much as occurs to him. It was the  touching by an unclean person which constituted the defilement. This is all that the Pharisee fixes on: his  offence is merely technical and ceremonial.
