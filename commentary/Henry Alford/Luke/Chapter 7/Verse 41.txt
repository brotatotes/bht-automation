<b> 41.]</b> We must remember that our Lord is here setting forth the matter<i> primarily</i> with reference to Simon’s subjective view of himself, and therefore not strictly as re-gards the actual comparative sinfulness of these two before God. Though however not to be pressed,<i> the case may have been so:</i> and, I am inclined to think,<i> was so.</i> The clear light of truth in which every word of His was spoken, will hardly allow us to suppose that such an admission would have been made to the Phrisee, if it had not really been so in fact. But see more below.<br><br><b> two debtors]</b> The<i> debtors</i> are the prominent persons in the parable—the creditor is necessary indeed to it, but is<i> in the background.</i> And this remark is important—for on bearing it carefully in mind the right understanding of the parable depends. The Lord speaks<i> from the position of the debtors,</i> and applies to their case the considerations of ordinary gratitude and justice And in doing so it is to be noticed, that He makes an assumption for the purpose of the parable:—<i>that sin</i> is proportionate to<i> the sense of sin,</i> just as a debt is felt to the amount of the debt. The disorganisation of our moral nature, the deadly sedative effect of sin in lulling the conscience, which renders the greatest sinner the least ready for penitence,<i> does not here come</i><i> into consideration;</i> the examples being two persons,<i> both aware of their debt</i>. This assumption itself is<i> absolutely necessary for the parable</i>: for if forgiveness is to awaken love in proportion to the magnitude of that which is forgiven,<i> sin</i> in such a connexion must be the<i> subjective debt</i> which is<i> felt</i> to exist, not the<i> objective</i> one, the magnitude of which<i> we</i> never can know, but God only: see on ver. 47 below.<br><br><b> five hundred</b>...<b> fifty</b>—a very different ratio from the ten thousand talents and the hundred pence (denarii) in Matt. xviii. 21–35, because there it is intended to shew us how insignificant our sins towards one another are in comparison with the offence of us all before
