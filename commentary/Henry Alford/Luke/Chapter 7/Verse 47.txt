<b> 47.]</b> This verse has been found very difficult to fit into the lesson conveyed by the Parable. But I think there need be little difficulty, if we regard it thus. Simon had been offended at the uncleanness of the woman who touched our Lord. He, having given the Pharisee the instruction contained in the parable, and having drawn the contrast the contrast between the woman’s conduct and his, now assures him, ‘Wherefore, seeing this is so, I say unto thee, she is no longer unclean—her many sins are forgiven:<i> for</i> (thou seest that)<i> she loved much:</i> her conduct towards Me shews that love, which is a token that her sins are forgiven.’ Thus the clauses are not connected by the causative particle, ‘<i>because</i> she loved much; but, as rightly rendered in A.V.,<b> for she loved much</b>: ‘<i>for she has shewn that love, of which thou mayest conclude, from what thou hast heard, that it is the effect of a sense of forgiveness.’</i> Thus Bengel says, “The remission of sins, not<i></i> imagined by Simon, is proved by its fruit, ver. 42, which latter is evident and meets the eye, whereas the other is hidden from us:”—and Calovius, “Christ was using that kind of proof which is called<i> à posteriori</i>.” But there is a deeper consideration in this solution, which the words of the Lord in ver. 48 bring before us. The<i> sense</i> of forgiveness of<i> sin</i> is not altogether correspondent to the sense of forgiveness of<i> a debt</i>. The latter must be altogether past, and a back on, to awaken, gratitude: the former, by no means so. The<i> expectation</i>, the<i> desire</i>, and<i> hope</i> of forgiveness, the<i> faith</i> of ver. 50, awoke this love; just as in our Christian life, the love daily awakened by a sense of forgiveness, yet is gathered under and summed up in a general faith and expectation, that ‘in that day’ all will be found to have been forgiven. The<i> remission</i> (forgiveness)<i> of sins</i>, into which we have baptized, and in which we live, yet waits for that great “<i>Thy sins are forgiven thee</i>” which He will then pronounce.
