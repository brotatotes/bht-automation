 36 50. ] ANOINTING OF JESUS’ FEET BY A PENITENT WOMAN.  Peculiar to Luke . It is hardly possible to imagine that this history can relate to the same incident as that detailed Matthew 26:6 ; Mark 14:3 ; John 12:3 ; although such an opinion has been entertained from the earliest times. Origen on Matthew 26:6 ff., vol. iii. p. 892, mentions and controverts it. It has been held in modern times by Grotius, Schleiermacher, Ewald, and Hug: and recently by Bleek. But the  only particular common to the two (unless indeed we account the  name of the host to be such, which is hardly worth recounting), is  the anointing itself; and  even that is not strictly the same . The  character of the woman , the  description of the host , the  sayings uttered , the  time , all are different. And if the probability of this occurring twice is to be questioned, we may fairly say, that an action of this kind, which had been once commended by our Lord, was  very likely to have been repeated , and especially at such a time as ‘six days before the last Passover,’ and by one anointing Him for His burial.
	I may add, that there is not the least reason for supposing the woman in this incident to have been Mary Magdalene. The introduction of her  as a new person so soon after (ch. Luk 8:2 ), and what is there stated of her, make the notion exceedingly improbable.
