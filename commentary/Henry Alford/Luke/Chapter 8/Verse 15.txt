But there is in this very receptivity a wide difference between men; some being false-hearted, hating the truth, deceiving themselves,—others being earnest and simple-minded, willing to be taught, and humble enough to receive ‘with meekness the engrafted word. It is of these that our Lord here speaks; of this kind was Nathanael, the Israelite indeed in whom was no guile, John i. 48: see also John xviii. 37, “Every one that is of the truth, heareth My voice,” and Trench on the Parables, in loc.<br><br><b> in patience</b>—<i>consistently</i>, through the course of a life spent in duties, and amidst discouragements—<i> “he that endureth unto the</i><i> the end</i>,<i> the same shall be be saved</i>,” Matt. xxiv. 13
