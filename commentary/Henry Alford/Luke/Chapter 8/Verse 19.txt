THE MOTHER AND BRETHREN OF JESUS SEEK TO SEE HIM. Matt. xii, 46–50. Mark iii. 31–35. The incident is introduced here without any precise note of sequence; not so in St. Matthew, who says, after the discourse in ch. xii., “<i>while he was yet speaking to the multitudes</i>”…and St. Mark<i> “There came then”…</i>having before stated, ver. 21, that His relations went out to lay hold of Him,—for they said, “He is beside Himself.” We must conclude therefore that<i> they</i> have it<i> in the exact place</i>, and that St. Luke only inserts it among the events of this series of discourses, as indeed it was, but<i> without fixing its place.</i> His account is abridged, and without marks of an eyewitness, which the others have.
