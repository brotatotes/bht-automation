	I put to any reader the question, whether it were possible for either Mark or Luke to have drawn up their account from Matt., or with Matt. before them, seeing that he mentions  two possessed throughout? Would no notice be taken of this? Then indeed would the Evangelists be but poor witnesses to the truth, if they could consciously allow such a discrepancy to go forth. Of the discrepancy itself, no solution has been proposed which can satisfy any really critical mind. That  one should have been prominent, and the spokesman is of course  possible , but such a hypothesis does not help us one whit. Where  two healings take place, narrators do not commonly, being fully aware of this, relate in the singular: and this is the phænomenon to be accounted for. It is at least reasonable to assign accuracy in such a case to the more detailed and chronologically inserted accounts of Mark and Luke.
