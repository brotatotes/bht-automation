<p><strong> 31. </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἄβυσσον</strong> ] This word is sometimes used for Hades in general ( Rom 10:7 ), but more usually in Scripture for the abode of damned spirits: see reff. This last is certainly meant here for the request is co-ordinate with the fear of torment expressed above (see Greswell on the Parables, v. (pt. 2) 365, and note on ch. Luk 16:23 ). But, as Bp. Wordsw. remarks, we must distinguish between ἄβυσσος , the ad interim place of torment, and the lake of fire into which the devil will be cast by Christ at the end: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:3">Revelation 20:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span> .</p>
