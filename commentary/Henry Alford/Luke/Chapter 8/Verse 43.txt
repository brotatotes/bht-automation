 43. ]  προσαναλ  ., ‘having,  besides all her suffering , spent,’ &c. But, see notes on μὴ προσεῶντος τοῦ ἀνέμου , Acts 27:7 , and on συμμαρτυρεῖν , Romans 2:15 ; Romans 8:16 ; Romans 9:1 ,  προς  - may denote the  direction or tendency of her spending. Mark adds, that she grew nothing better, but rather worse. The omission of this clause, ἰατρ . προσαν . ὅλ . τ . β ., in some of the best MSS., is curious. I have not ventured to exclude it, on account of the characteristic ἅπαξ λεγόμενον  προσαναλώσασα , which seems to betray St. Luke’s hand. The  ἀπ  ʼ instead of ὑπ ʼ, which latter may have come from the ὑπὸ πολλῶν ἰατρῶν of St. Mark, conveys a slightly differing sense. ὑπό is more of direct agency, ἀπό of ultimate derivation. She could get no relief from any system of treatment adopted by any.
