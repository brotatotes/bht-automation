<p><strong> 43.</strong> ] <strong> προσαναλ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> ‘having, <em> besides all her suffering</em> , spent,’ &amp;c. But, see notes on μὴ προσεῶντος τοῦ ἀνέμου , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:7">Acts 27:7</span> , and on συμμαρτυρεῖν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1">Romans 9:1</span> , <strong> προς</strong> <strong> -</strong> may denote the <em> direction</em> or tendency of her spending. Mark adds, that she grew nothing better, but rather worse. The omission of this clause, ἰατρ . προσαν . ὅλ . τ . β ., in some of the best MSS., is curious. I have not ventured to exclude it, on account of the characteristic ἅπαξ λεγόμενον <strong> προσαναλώσασα</strong> , which seems to betray St. Luke’s hand. The <strong> ἀπ</strong> <strong> ʼ</strong> instead of ὑπ ʼ, which latter may have come from the ὑπὸ πολλῶν ἰατρῶν of St. Mark, conveys a slightly differing sense. ὑπό is more of direct agency, ἀπό of ultimate derivation. She could get no relief from any system of treatment adopted by any.</p>
