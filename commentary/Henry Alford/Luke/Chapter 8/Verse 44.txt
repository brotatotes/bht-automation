 44. ] Her inner thoughts are given in Mark 5:28 .
	There was doubtless a weakness and error in this woman’s view; she imagined that healing power flowed as it were magically out of the Lord’s person; and she touched the fringe of his garment as the most  sacred , as well as the most accessible part: see Matthew 23:5 ; Numbers 15:37-40 . But she  obtained what she desired . She sought it, though in error, yet  in faith . And she obtained it, because this faith was known and recognized by the Lord. It is most true objectively, that there did go forth healing virtue from Him, and from his Apostles (see Mark 6:56 ; Luke 6:19 ; Acts 5:15 ; Act 19:12 ), but it is also true that, in ordinary cases, only those were receptive of this whose faith embraced the truth of its existence, and ability to heal them. The error of her view was overborne, and her weakness of apprehension of truth covered, by the strength of her faith. And this is a most encouraging miracle for us to recollect, when we are disposed to think despondingly of the ignorance or superstition of much of the Christian world: that He who accepted this woman for her faith even in error and weakness, may also accept them.
