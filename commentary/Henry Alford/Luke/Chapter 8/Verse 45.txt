<b> 45.</b>] We are not to imagine that our Lord<i> was</i><i> ignorant</i> of the woman, or any of the circumstances. The question is asked to draw out what followed.<br><br> See, on the part of Jesus Himself, an undeniable instance of this, in ch. xxiv. 19—and note there. The healing took place<i> by His will</i>, and<i> owing to is recognition of her faith:</i> see similar questions, Gen. iii. 9, and 2 Kings v. 25.<br><br><b> Peter and they that were with him</b>] A detail contained only here.<br><br> On the latter part of this verse many instructive remarks have been made in sermons—see Trench, Mir., p. 192, note (edn. 2)—to the effect that many press round Christ, but few touch Him, only the faithful. Thus Augustine, “Even thus is it now with His body, i.e. His Church. She is touched by the faith of few, thought crowded by the mob of the many.” And Chrusostom, “The believer on the Saviour toucheth Him, but the unbeliever throngeth and vexeth Him.” It is difficult to imagine how the miracle should be, as Dr. Wordsworth calls it, “a solemn warning to all who crowd on Christ:” or how such a forbidding to come to Him should be reconciled with “<i>Come unto Me all...</i>” Rather should we say, seeing it was one of those that thus crowded on Him who obtained grace from Him, that it is a blessed encouragement to us not only to crowd on Him, but even to touch Him: so to crowd on Him as never to be content till we have grasped if it be but His garment for ourselves: not to despise or discourage any of the least of those who “make familiar addresses to Him in (so called) religious hymns,” seeing that thus some of them may touch Him to the healing of their souls. I much fear that if my excellent friend had been keeping order among the multitude on the way to the house of Jairus, this poor woman would never have been allowed to get near to Jesus. But I hope and trust that he and I shall rejoice together one day in His presence amidst a greater crowd, whom no man can number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues.
