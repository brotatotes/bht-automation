<b> 47.</b>] It is not necessary (though perhaps probably), from the<b> when all denied</b>, ver. 45, that<i> the woman</i> should also have denied with them. She may have hidden herself among the crowd. Our Lord (Mark, ver. 32) looked around to see “<i>her that had done this thing,</i>”—a wonderful precision of expression, by which His absolute knowledge of the whole matter is set before us.<br><br><b> trembling:</b> and more, “<i>knowing what was done to her,</i>” Mark; which is implied here. All this is omitted in Matthew; and if we had only his account, we should certainly<i> derive the wrong lesson</i> from the miracle; for there we miss altogether the reproof, and the shame to which the woman is put; and the words of our Lord look like an encomium on her<i> act itself</i>. Her confession<b> before all the people</b>, is very striking<i> Himself openly confessed, and not only secretly sought:</i> that our Christian life is not, as it is sometimes called, merely ‘<i>a thing between ourselves and God;</i>’ but a<i> good confession</i>, to be witnessed before all.
