<b> 51.</b>] Our Lord had entered the house, where He found “<i>a tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly,</i>” Mark: “<i>the minstrels and people making a noise,</i>” Matthew, who were all following Him into the chamber of death. On this<i> He declared who were to follow Him,</i> and uttered the words “<i>Give place</i>”&c. Matthew.–Then He entered with His three Apostles and the parents. I say this, not for the sake of harmonizing, but to bring out the sequence in our narrative here, which unless we get the right meaning for<b> suffered no man to go in</b>, seems disturbed.
