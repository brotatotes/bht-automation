<b> 55.</b>]<b> her spirit came again:</b> see Judges xv. 19, 1 Kings xvii. 21, in the former of which places death<i> had not</i> taken place, but in the latter it<i> had</i>; so that no inference adverse to her actual death can be derived from the use of the word.<br><br> The command<i> to give her to eat</i>, shews that she was restored to actual life with its wants and weaknesses; and in that incipient state of convalescence, which would require nourishment. The testimony of Mark here precludes all idea of a recovery from a mere paroxysm— “<i>and she walked.</i>” One who “<i>lay at the point of death</i>” at the time of the father’s coming, and then died, so that it could be said of the minstrels and others who had time to assemble, “<i>knowing that she was dead,</i>”—could not, supposing that they were mistaken and she was only in a trance,<i> have risen up and walked</i>, and been in a situation to take meat, in so short a time after. Every part of the narrative combines to declare that the death was real, and the miracle a<i> raising from the dead</i>, in the strictest sense.
