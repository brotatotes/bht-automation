<p><strong> 19 21.</strong> ] THE MOTHER AND BRETHREN OF JESUS SEEK TO SEE HIM. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46-50">Matthew 12:46-50</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31-35">Mark 3:31-35</span> . The incident is introduced here without any precise note of sequence; not so in Matt., who says, after the discourse in ch. 12, ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος τοῖς ὄχλοις … and Mark καὶ ἔρχονται … having before stated, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:21">Luke 8:21</span> , that His relations went out to lay hold of Him, for they said, “He is beside Himself.” We must conclude therefore that <em> they</em> have it <em> in the exact place</em> , and that Luke only inserts it among the events of this series of discourses, as indeed it was, but <em> without fixing its place</em> . His account is abridged, and without marks of an eyewitness, which the others have.</p>
