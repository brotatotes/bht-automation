 10. ] He went  in a ship (Matt., Mark, John), of which our Evangelist seems not to have been aware; for we should gather from our text that it was  by land . A great difficulty also attends the mention of Bethsaida here. At first sight, it would appear to be the well-known Bethsaida, on the western bank of the lake, not far from Capernaum. But (1) our Lord was  on this side before , see ch. Luke 8:37 ; and (2) Mark ( Mar 6:45 ) relates that  after the miracle of the loaves He caused His disciples to cross over to Bethsaida. But there were  two places of this name: another Bethsaida (Julias) lay at the top of the lake, on the Jordan: see Stanley, p. 381, edn. 3: Van de Velde, index, sub voce. Now it is very likely that our Lord may have crossed the lake to  this Bethsaida, and St. Luke, finding that the miracle happened near Bethsaida, and  not being aware of the crossing of the lake , may have left the name thus without explanation, as being that of the other Bethsaida. Mark gives us the exact account: that the Lord and the disciples, who went  by sea , were perceived by the multitude who went  by land , πεζῇ , and arrived before Him. How any of these accounts could have been compiled with a knowledge of the others, I cannot imagine.
