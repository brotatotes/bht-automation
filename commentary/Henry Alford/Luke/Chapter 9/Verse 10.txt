<b> 10.</b>] He went<i> in a ship</i> (Matthew, Mark, John), of which our Evangelist seems not to have been informed; for we should gather from our text that it was<i> by land</i>. A great difficulty also attends the mention of Bethsaida here. At first sight, it would appear to be the well-known Bethsaida, on the western bank of the lake, not far from Capernaum. But (1) our Lord was<i> on this side before</i>,—see ch. viii. 37; and (2) Mark (vi. 45) relates that<i> after</i> the miracle of the loaves He caused His disciples to cross over to Bethsaida. But there were<i> two places</i> of this name:—another Bethsaida (Julias) lay at the top of the lake, on the Jordan: see Stanley, p. 381, edn. 3. Now it is very likely that our Lord may have crossed the lake to<i> this</i> Bethsaida, and St. Luke, finding that the miracle happened near Bethsaida, and<i> not being informed of the crossing Of the lake</i>, may have left the name thus without explanation, as being that of the other Bethsaida. St. Mark gives us the exact account: that the Lord and the disciples, who went<i> by sea</i>, were perceived by the multitude who went<i> by land</i>, and arrived before Him. How any of these accounts could have been compiled with a knowledge of the others, I cannot imagine.
