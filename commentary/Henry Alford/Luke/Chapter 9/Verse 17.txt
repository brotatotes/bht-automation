 17. ]  κλασ  . in Matt. is joined with τὸ περισσεῦον , in Mark with κοφίνους πλήρεις : here it may be taken with  τὸ περισ  . (ordinarily, and De Wette) or  κόφ  . (Meyer), but best, it appears to me, the  latter , because the article is not expressed as in Matt.
	Immediately after this miracle, Matt., Mark, and John relate the walking on the sea, which, and the whole series of events following as far as Matthew 16:12 , the healings in the land of Gennesaret, the discourse about unwashen hands, the Syrophœnician woman, the healing of multitudes by the sea of Galilee, the feeding of the 4000, the asking of a sign from Heaven, and the forgetting to take bread, are  wholly omitted by our Evangelist. Supposing him to have had Matt. before him, how is this to be explained?
	It is also an important observation, that the omission by Luke of the second miracle of feeding is not to be adduced against its historical reality, as has been done by Schleiermacher (transl. p. 144), since it is only omitted as  occurring in the midst of a large section, which the accounts gathered by Luke did not contain . We see also, that the characteristic  κοφίνους of the first feeding is preserved, without any confusion of terms: σπυρίδας being always used in relating and referring to the second, Matthew 15:37 ; Matthew 16:10 ; Mark 8:8 ; Mark 8:20 .
