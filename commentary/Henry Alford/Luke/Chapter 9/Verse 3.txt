 3. ]  μήτε  [  ἀνὰ  ]   δύο χ  .   ἔχειν a mixed construction; the former clause having been in the second person, this is added as if it had been in the infin., αἴρειν . The infinitive  for the imperative would not be in place here, see Winer, Gram. § 43, 5. d, edn. 6.
	It is remarkable that in [72] Mark, there is also a mixed construction, ἵνα μηδὲν αἴρωσιν … ἀλλ ʼ ὑποδεδεμένους … καὶ μὴ ἐνδύσησθε … (On  ἀνά  , see reff.)
	 [72] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
