<p><strong> 48.</strong> ] The discourse as here related has the closest connexion and harmony. The dispute had been, who (among the Twelve) should be greatest, i.e. greatest <em> in the kingdom of heaven:</em> for other greatness is not to be thought of, the minds of the disciples being always on this, as just about to appear (against De Wette and Meyer); and our Lord reminds them that no such precedence is to be thought of among those sent in His name; for that even a little child, if thus sent, is clothed with His dignity; and if there be any distinction among such, it is this, that he who is like that child, humblest and least, i.e. nearest to the spirit of his Lord, <em> he is the greatest</em> .

<p>“ <em> The whole discourse in Luke is</em> <em> without connexion</em> .” De Wette, strangely enough: who also says, κ . ὃς ἐὰν ἐμὲ δέξ .… is borrowed from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:40">Matthew 10:40</span> ; and that ὁ γὰρ μικρ .… οὗτος ἔσται … ought to stand at the beginning of the discourse, as in Matt. I quote this as one among continually recurring specimens of the criticism which would cut our precious, and most truthful Gospels into fragments without meaning or connexion. We live in times when such criticisms are making way among shallow minds: let the student judge from the above sample, what they are generally worth.
