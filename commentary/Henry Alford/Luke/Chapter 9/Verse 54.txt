 54. ] The disciples whom He named ‘sons of thunder,’ Mark 3:17 . They  saw some insult of manner, or actual refusal to allow the Lord to enter their village. That a collision of this kind did take place is plain from the last verse, and implied from the occasion alluded to by the two Apostles, where the fire was invoked in the presence of the offending persons.  It happened also in Samaria.

	It is exceedingly difficult to determine the true reading in this passage, which seems to have been more than usually tampered with, or wrongly written. It is hardly conceivable that the shorter text, as edited by Tischd [79] ., … ἀναλῶσαι αὐτούς ; στραφεὶς δὲ ἐπετίμησεν αὐτοῖς . καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν … should have been the original, and all the rest, insertion. Homœoteleuton may have had some share in the omission of the latter debated portion, from  ΚΑΙΕΙΠ to  ΚΑΙΕΠ  : but this does not touch ὡς καὶ Ἡλ . ἐπ . It has been suggested that those words may have been removed as involving indirect censure of Elias: but surely this lay too far off to create any offence. And their  insertion into the text is quite inexplicable. In this great uncertainty, I have thought the candid way is to let my edited text reflect such uncertainty, and I have therefore printed these latter debatable words in the same type as the text, and have annotated on them. Let it be remembered that in both cases, versions far more ancient than our oldest MSS. contain these words.
