<b> 55.</b>]<b> Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of</b>] Besides the<i> mistaken</i> ways of explaining these words of our Lord (e. g. ‘<i>Do not see what a [bad] spirit you are shewing?</i>’) there are two senses which they<i> may</i> bear. (1) Affirmative, as in A.V.— “Ye think ye are influenced by the same spirit as once influenced Elias... but ye are in error. Ye have indeed a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge; the offspring of human partiality, not of divine inspiration,” Grotius; or (2) interrogative— ‘<i>Know ye not what manner of spirit ye, belong to (are of)?</i>’ the spirit meant being the Holy Spirit. ‘The Spirit in Elias was a fiery and judicial spirit, as befitted the times and the character of God’s dealings then; but the Spirit in Me and mine is of a different kind—a spirit of love and forgiveness,’<br><br> The latter of these is perhaps better suited to the context; but the former is more according to the usage of the expression<b> Ye know (not)</b> in the gospels: see note in my Greek Testament. I have therefore punctuated according to the former sense: which, indeed, seems more naturally followed by the<b> for</b> of the clause following.<br><br> it is very interesting to remember that this same John came down to Samaria (Acts viii. 14–17) with Peter, to confer the gift of the Holy Spirit on the Samaritan believers.
