 55. ]  [  οὐκ οἴδατε οἵου πνεύματός ἐστε  . Besides the  mistaken ways of explaining these words of our Lord (e.g. ‘  Do you not see what a (  bad )  spirit you are shewing? ’ Bornemann) there are two senses which they  may bear. (1) Affirmative, as in E. V., ‘putatis vos agi Spiritu tali quali olim Elias … sed erratis. Habetis quidem ζῆλον sed οὐ κατ ʼ ἐπίγνωσιν , et qui proinde humani est affectus, non divinæ motionis.’ Grot.; or (2) interrogative ‘  Know ye not what manner of spirit ye belong to (  are of )  ? ’ the spirit meant being the Holy Spirit. ‘The Spirit in Elias was a fiery and judicial spirit, as befitted the times and the character of God’s dealings then; but the Spirit in Me and mine is of a different kind a spirit of love and forgiveness.’
	The latter of these is perhaps better suited to the context: but we seem to want an example in the Gospels of ( οὐκ ) οἴδατε used interrogatively: see Matthew 7:11 [80] ; Matthew 20:22 ; Matthew 20:25 [81] ; Matthew 24:42 [82] ; Matthew 25:13 ; Matthew 26:2 : Mark 4:13 (doubtful, but the construction is direct): ch. Luke 12:56 ; John 8:14 ; Joh 14:4 alli [83] . I have therefore punctuated according to the former sense: which, indeed, seems more naturally followed by the γάρ of the clause following.
	 [80] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .

	It is very interesting to remember that this same John came down to Samaria ( Act 8:14-17 ) with Peter, to confer the gift of the Holy Spirit on the Samaritan believers.]
