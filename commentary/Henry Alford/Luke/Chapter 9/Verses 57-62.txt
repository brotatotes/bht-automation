<p><strong> 57 62.</strong> ] Matthew ( Mat 8:19-22 ) relates the contents of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:57-60">Luke 9:57-60</span> , but at a totally different period of our Lordâ€™s ministry, viz. His crossing the lake to go to Gadara. It is quite impossible to decide which Evangelist has placed the incidents in their proper chronological place. When we once begin to speculate on such things, it is easy to find a fitness, on whichever side of the argument we range ourselves. Only (see notes on Matt.) we must not adopt the wretched subterfuge of the harmonists, and maintain that the two events took place <em> twice, each time consecutively, and each time with the same reply from our Lord</em> .</p>
