 61, 62. ] Peculiar to Luke.
	 τοῖς εἰς  …, a mixture of two constructions ἀπέρχεσθαι  εἰς τ . οἶκ . μου καὶ ἀποτάξ . τοῖς ἐν τ . οἴκῳ μου . The meaning is, to  bid farewell to the persons , not  to set in order the things , as some have rendered it. The answer of our Lord again seems to refer to the sending out into the harvest (ch. Luk 10:2 ), for which the present seventy were as it were the ploughmen, first breaking up the ground. The saying itself is to be explained simply from agricultural operations for he who has his hand on the plough, guiding it, must look on the furrow which his share is making if he look behind, his work will be marred. Hesiod’s precept is very similar, ἔργ . ii. 60, ἰθείην αὔλακ ʼ ἐλαύνοι ,  μηκέτι παπταίνων μεθ  ʼ   ὁμήλικας ἀλλ ʼ ἐπὶ ἔργῳ θυμὸν ἔχων .
	 εὔθετος , not ‘  fit ,’ but  well adapted, ‘the right sort of workman.’ The sense is more immediately applicable to the  ministry of the gospel of Christ, which will least of all things bear a divided service and backward looks, but of course affects also every private Christian, inasmuch as he too has a work to do, ground to break, and a harvest to reap.
