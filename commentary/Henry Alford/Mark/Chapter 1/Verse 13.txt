<b>Satan</b>:<i> the devil</i>, Matthew, Luke: see note, Matt. iv. 1. It seems to have been permitted to the evil one to tempt our Lord<i> during the whole of the 40 days</i>, and of this we have here, as in Luke an implied assertion. The additional intensity of temptation at the<i> end</i> of that period, is expressed in Matthew by the tempter<i> coming</i> to Him—becoming visible and audible. Perhaps the<i> being with the beasts</i> may point to one form of temptation, viz. that of<i> terror</i>, which was practised on Him:—but of the<i> inward trials</i>, who may speak? There is nothing here to<i> contradict</i> the fast spoken of in Matthew and Luke, as some have maintained. Our Evangelist, Perhaps implies it in the last words of ver. 13. remarkable that those Commentators who are fondest of maintaining that Mark constructed his narrative out of those of Matthew and Luke, are also most keen in pointing out what they call irreconcilable differences between him and them. No apportionment of these details to the various successive parts of the temptation is given by our Evangelist. They are simply stated to have happened, commpendiously.
