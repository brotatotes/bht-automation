The time is fulfilled]</b> See Gal. iv. 4. “The end of the old covenant is at hand;.... the Son is born, grown up, anointed (in his baptism), tempted, gone forth, the testimony of his witness is given, and now He witnesses Himself; now begins that last speaking of God,<i> by His Son</i>, (Heb. i. 1), which henceforth shall be proclaimed in all the world till the end comes.” Stier.<br><br><b> and believe the gospel]</b> These words are in Mark only. They furnish us an interesting characteristic of the difference between the preaching<i> of John</i>, which was that of repentance—and<i> of our Lord</i>, which was repentance<i> and faith</i>. It is not<i> in Himself as the Saviour</i> that this faith is<i> yet</i> preached: this He did not proclaim till much later in his ministry: but in<i> the fulfilment of the time and approach of the kingdom of God.</i><br><br> Almost verbatim as Matthew. The variations are curious: after Simon, Mark omits<i> which was called Peter</i>:—although the name was prophetically given by our Lord before this, in John 1. 48, it perhaps was not<i> actually</i> given, till the twelve became a distinct body, see ch. iii. 16.<br><br> The<i> “walked by”</i> and the<i> “casting a net into the sea”</i> are noticed by Meyer as belonging to the graphic delineation which this Evangelist loves.
