<p><strong> 15. </strong> <strong> πεπλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὁ καιρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span> . “The end of the old covenant is at hand; … the Son is born, grown up, anointed (in his baptism), tempted, gone forth, the testimony of his witness is given, and now He witnesses Himself; now begins that last speaking of God, <em> by His Son</em> ( Heb 1:1 ), which henceforth shall be proclaimed in all the world till the end comes.” Stier, R. J. i. 57.

<p><strong> καὶ πιστ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] These words are in Mark only. They furnish us an interesting characteristic of the difference between the preaching <em> of John</em> , which was that of repentance and <em> of our Lord</em> , which was repentance <em> and faith</em> . It is not <em> in Himself as the Saviour</em> that this faith is <em> yet</em> preached: this He did not proclaim till much later in his ministry: but in <em> the fulfilment of the time and approach of the kingdom of God</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν</strong> is not <em> instrumental</em> (as Fritzsche), ‘ <em> by means of</em> the Gospel:’ but <strong> in the Gospel,</strong> which, in its completion, sets forth Jesus Christ as the object of faith. “The object of the faith is conceived as that on which the faith lays hold.” Meyer.</p>
