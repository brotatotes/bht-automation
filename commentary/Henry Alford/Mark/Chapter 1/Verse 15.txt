 15.   πεπλ  .   ὁ καιρ  . ] See Galatians 4:4 . “The end of the old covenant is at hand; … the Son is born, grown up, anointed (in his baptism), tempted, gone forth, the testimony of his witness is given, and now He witnesses Himself; now begins that last speaking of God,  by His Son ( Heb 1:1 ), which henceforth shall be proclaimed in all the world till the end comes.” Stier, R. J. i. 57.
	 καὶ πιστ  . ] These words are in Mark only. They furnish us an interesting characteristic of the difference between the preaching  of John , which was that of repentance and  of our Lord , which was repentance  and faith . It is not  in Himself as the Saviour that this faith is  yet preached: this He did not proclaim till much later in his ministry: but in  the fulfilment of the time and approach of the kingdom of God .
	 ἐν is not  instrumental (as Fritzsche), ‘  by means of the Gospel:’ but  in the Gospel, which, in its completion, sets forth Jesus Christ as the object of faith. “The object of the faith is conceived as that on which the faith lays hold.” Meyer.
