<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [5] The CODEX RESCRIPTUS DUBLINENSIS, in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. Contains, of the N.T., the Gospel of Matthew. It was discovered (under the cursive writing of a copy of Chrysostom de Sacerdotio, extracts from Epiphanius, &amp;c.) by Dr. Barrett, who published all that he could read in not very exact copper-plate facsimile at the expense of the college in 1801. Tregelles, in 1853, by the aid of a chemical mixture was able to decipher the portions which had baffled Barrett, and carefully recollated the whole. It has many lacunæ, which will be seen by the letters in our inner margin. The date assigned to it is the <em> sixth century</em> .
