<p><strong> 23. </strong> <strong> ἄνθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν πν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The use of the prep. in this connexion is unusual: see reff. I think the best account of it is, that it falls under a large class of usages of ἐν , expressing the <em> element in which</em> the man lived and moved, as possessed and interpenetrated by the evil spirit, as in the common expressions ἐν κυρίῳ , ἐν χριστῷ , cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:2">2 Corinthians 12:2</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:28">Acts 17:28</span> .</p>
