 27. ]  πρὸς ἑαυτούς is not, each man within himself, but amounts to πρὸς ἀλλήλους , see reff. Meyer well remarks, that the reason of the reflexive pronoun being used, is probably to be found in the narrative representing what was said  among themselves , not to Jesus and his disciples.
	We may either take καινή with κατ ʼ ἐξουσίαν , ‘  new in respect of power ,’ as Meyer: or regard καινή and κατ ʼ ἐξουσίαν as two separate predicates of διδαχή . The latter view is preferable as more borne out by the adverbial use of κατά with nouns signifying  power in the reff. Render then  a teaching new and powerful.
