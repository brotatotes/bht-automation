 38. ]  ἐξῆλθ  . = ἀπεστάλην , Luke: not ‘  undertook this journey :’ He had  not yet begun any journey , and it cannot apply to ἐξῆλθεν above, for that was not to any city, nor to preach. The word has its more solemn sense, as in reff. John, though of course not understood  then by the hearers. To deny this, as Meyer, is certainly not safe.
