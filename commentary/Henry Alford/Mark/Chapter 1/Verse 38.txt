<p><strong> 38.</strong> ] <strong> ἐξῆλθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> = ἀπεστάλην , Luke: not ‘ <em> undertook this journey</em> :’ He had <em> not yet begun any journey</em> , and it cannot apply to ἐξῆλθεν above, for that was not to any city, nor to preach. The word has its more solemn sense, as in reff. John, though of course not understood <em> then</em> by the hearers. To deny this, as Meyer, is certainly not safe.</p>
