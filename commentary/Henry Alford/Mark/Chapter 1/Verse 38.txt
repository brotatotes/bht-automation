<b> 38.] came I forth</b> = “<i>was I sent,</i>” Luke: not “<i>undertook this journey:</i>” He had<i> not yet begun any journey</i>, and it cannot apply to “<i>went out</i>” above, for that was not to any city, nor to preach. The word has its more solemn sense, as in John xvi. 28, though of course not understood<i> then</i> by the hearers. To deny this is certainly not safe.
