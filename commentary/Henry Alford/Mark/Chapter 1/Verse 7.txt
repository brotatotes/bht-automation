<b> 7.]</b><b> to stoop down and unloose...</b> the sion is common to Mark, Luke, and John (i. 27). It amounts to the same as<i> bearing the shoes</i>-for he who did the last would necessarily be also employed in loosing and taking off the sandal. But the variety is itself indicative of the independence of Matthew and Mark of one another. St. John used the two expressions at different times, and our witnesses have reported both. Stoop down is added by St. Mark, who, as we shall find, is more minute in circumstantial detail than the other Evangelists.
