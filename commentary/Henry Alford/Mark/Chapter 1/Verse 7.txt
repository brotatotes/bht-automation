<p><strong> 7. </strong> <strong> κύψας λῦσαι</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] The expression is common to Mark, Luke, and John ( Mar 1:27 ). It amounts to the same as <em> bearing the shoes</em> for he who did the last would necessarily be also employed in loosing and taking off the sandal. But the variety is itself indicative of the independence of Matt. and Mark of one another. John used the two expressions at different times, and our witnesses have reported both. <strong> κύψας</strong> is added by Mark, who, as we shall find, is more minute in circumstantial detail than the other Evangelists.</p>
