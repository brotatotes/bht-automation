<p>It seems to have been permitted to the evil one to tempt our Lord <em> during the whole of the</em> 40 <em> days</em> , and of this we have here, as in Luke, an implied assertion. The additional intensity of temptation at the <em> end</em> of that period, is expressed in Matt. by the tempter <em> coming to</em> Him becoming visible and audible. Perhaps the <em> being with the beasts</em> may point to one form of temptation, viz. that of <em> terror</em> , which was practised on Him: but of the <em> inward trials</em> who may speak?

<p>There is nothing here to <em> contradict</em> the fast spoken of in Matt. and Luke, as De W. maintains. Our Evangelist perhaps implies it in the last words of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:13">Mark 1:13</span> . It is remarkable that those Commentators who are fondest of maintaining that Mark constructed his narrative out of those of Matt. and Luke (De W., Meyer) are also most keen in pointing out what they call irreconcileable differences between him and them. No apportionment of these details to the various successive parts of the temptation is given by our Evangelist. They are simply stated to have happened, compendiously.</p>
