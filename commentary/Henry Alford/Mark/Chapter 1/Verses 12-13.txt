 12 ,  13. ]  ἐκβάλλω = ἀνάγω Matt., = ἄγω Luke. It is a more forcible word than either of these to express the mighty and cogent impulse of the Spirit.
	 σατανᾶ = διαβ . Matt., Luke: see note, Matthew 4:1 .
	It seems to have been permitted to the evil one to tempt our Lord  during the whole of the 40  days , and of this we have here, as in Luke, an implied assertion. The additional intensity of temptation at the  end of that period, is expressed in Matt. by the tempter  coming to Him becoming visible and audible. Perhaps the  being with the beasts may point to one form of temptation, viz. that of  terror , which was practised on Him: but of the  inward trials who may speak?
	 οἱ ἄγγ  ., as  τῶν θηρ . generic.
	There is nothing here to  contradict the fast spoken of in Matt. and Luke, as De W. maintains. Our Evangelist perhaps implies it in the last words of Mark 1:13 . It is remarkable that those Commentators who are fondest of maintaining that Mark constructed his narrative out of those of Matt. and Luke (De W., Meyer) are also most keen in pointing out what they call irreconcileable differences between him and them. No apportionment of these details to the various successive parts of the temptation is given by our Evangelist. They are simply stated to have happened, compendiously.
