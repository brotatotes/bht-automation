<p><strong> 16 20.</strong> ] CALLING OF PETER, ANDREW, JAMES, AND JOHN. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:18-22">Matthew 4:18-22</span> . Almost verbatim as Matt. The variations are curious: after Σίμωνα , Mark omits τὸν λεγ . Πέτρ .: although the name was prophetically given by our Lord before this, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:43">John 1:43</span> , it perhaps was not <em> actually</em> given, till the twelve became a distinct body, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:16">Mark 3:16</span> .
	</p>
<p>Matt. has εἰς τὴν θ ., for our ἐν τ . θ ., an inconceivable variation if one copied the other, as is also ἀμφιβάλλ . for βάλλ . ἀμφίβληστρον .
	</p>
<p>The παράγων παρά , and the ἀμφιβ . ἐν τ . θαλ . are noticed by Meyer as belonging to the graphic delineation which this Evangelist loves.</p>
