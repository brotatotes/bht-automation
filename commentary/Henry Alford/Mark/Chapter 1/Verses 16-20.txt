 16 20. ] CALLING OF PETER, ANDREW, JAMES, AND JOHN. Matthew 4:18-22 . Almost verbatim as Matt. The variations are curious: after Σίμωνα , Mark omits τὸν λεγ . Πέτρ .: although the name was prophetically given by our Lord before this, in John 1:43 , it perhaps was not  actually given, till the twelve became a distinct body, see ch. Mark 3:16 .
	Matt. has εἰς τὴν θ ., for our ἐν τ . θ ., an inconceivable variation if one copied the other, as is also ἀμφιβάλλ . for βάλλ . ἀμφίβληστρον .
	The παράγων παρά , and the ἀμφιβ . ἐν τ . θαλ . are noticed by Meyer as belonging to the graphic delineation which this Evangelist loves.
