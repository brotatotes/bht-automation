<p><strong> 23 28.</strong> ] This account occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:33-37">Luke 4:33-37</span> , nearly verbatim: for the variations, see there. It is very important for our Lord’s official life, as shewing that He rejected and forbade all testimony to his Person, <em> except that which He came on earth to give</em> . The dæmons <em> knew Him</em> , but <em> were silenced</em> . (See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:7">Mark 5:7</span> .) It is of course utterly impossible to understand such a testimony as that of the <em> sick person</em> , still less of the <em> fever</em> or <em> disease</em> .</p>
