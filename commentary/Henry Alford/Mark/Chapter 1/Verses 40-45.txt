<p><strong> 40 45.</strong> ] CLEANSING OF A LEPER. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:2-4">Matthew 8:2-4</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:12-14">Luke 5:12-14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:12-14">Luke 5:12-14</span> . The account here is the fullest, and evidently an original one, from an eye-witness. St. Luke mentions ( Mar 1:15 ) the spreading of the fame of Jesus, without assigning the cause as in our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:45">Mark 1:45</span> . See note on Matt.</p>
