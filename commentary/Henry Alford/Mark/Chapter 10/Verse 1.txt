 1.   καὶ πέραν ] Our Lord retired, after His discourses to the Jews in John 10:0 and before the raising of Lazarus, to Bethany (John 1:28 ; Joh 10:40 ) beyond Jordan, and thence made his last journey to Jerusalem; so that in the strictest sense of the words He did come  into the borders of Judæa and beyond Jordan.
	Matt. has πέραν τ . Ἰορ . without the copula. See Luke 17:11 . Here a large portion of the sayings and doings of Jesus is omitted: cf. Matthew 18:10 ; Matthew 19:3 ; Luk 9:51 to Luke 18:15 ; John 7:1 ff.
