<b> 12.]</b> This verse corresponds to “<i>whoso marrieth her that is put away committeth adultery</i>” in Matthew, ver 9—but it is<i> expressed</i> as if the<i> woman</i> were the active party, and put away her husband, which was allowed by Greek and Roman law (see 1 Cor. vii. 13), but not by Jewish (see Deut. xxiv. 1: Jos. Antt. xv. 7. 10). This alteration in the verbal expression may have originated in the source whence Mark’s report was drawn.
