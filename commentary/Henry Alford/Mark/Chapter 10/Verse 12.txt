<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] This verse corresponds to ὁ ἀπολελυμένην γαμήσας μοιχᾶται in Mat 19:9 but it is <em> expressed</em> as if the <em> woman</em> were the active party, and put away her husband, which was allowed by Greek and Roman law (see 1Co 7:13 ), but not by Jewish (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+24:1">Deuteronomy 24:1</span> ; Jos. Antt. xv.7.10). This alteration in the verbal expression may have originated in the source whence Mark’s report was drawn. On μοιχᾶται , Grotius remarks, ‘Mulier, cum domina sui non sit, si, marito relicto, ad aliud matrimonium se conferat, omnino adulterium committit, non interpretatione aliqua, aut per consequentiam, sed <em> directe</em> : ideo non debuit hic addi, ἐπ ʼ αὐτόν .’</p>
