<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] We can hardly read our Lord’s solemn saying, without seeing that it reaches further than the mere then present occasion. It might one day become a question whether the new Christian covenant of repentance and faith could take in the unconscious infant, as the old covenant did: whether when Jesus was no longer on earth, little children might be brought to Him, dedicated to his service, and made partakers of his blessing? Nay, in the pride of the human intellect, this question was sure one day to be raised: and our Lord furnishes the Church, by anticipation, with an answer to it for all ages. Not only may the little infants be brought to Him, but in order for us who are mature to come to Him, we must cast away all that wherein our maturity has caused us to differ from them, and <em> become</em> LIKE THEM. Not only is Infant Baptism <em> justified</em> , but it is (abstractedly considered; not as <em> to preparation</em> for it, which from the nature of the case is precluded) the NORMAL PATTERN OF ALL BAPTISM; none can enter God’s kingdom, except <em> as an infant</em> . In adult baptism, the <em> exceptional case</em> (see above), we strive to secure that state of simplicity and childlikeness, which in the infant we have ready and undoubted to our hands.</p>
