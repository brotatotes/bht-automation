<b> 16.]</b> The word may be rendered he<b> fervently blessed them</b>.<br><br> The dilemma, as regards the Socinians, has been well put (see Stier ii. 283, note):—<i>either</i>, “There is none but God: Christ is good: therefore Christ is GOD;”—<i>or</i>, “There is none good but God: therefore Christ is not God; therefore Christ IS NOT GOOD.”<br><br> With regard to other points the variations in the narratives are trifling, but instructive— “<i>if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He saith unto Him, which?</i>” (Matthew) = “<i>thou knowest the commandments</i>” (Mark and Luke) without any break in the discourse. Similarly, in Matthew, the young (Matthew) ruler (Luke) asks, ver. 20, “<i>what lack I yet?</i>” but in Mark and Luke, Jesus says to him (and here with the remarkable addition of “<i>beholding him, loved him</i>”) “one thing thou lackest.” Such notices as these shew the point at which, not short of which nor beyond which, we may expect the Evangelists to be in accord: viz. in that<i> inner truthfulness of faithful report</i> which reflects to us the teaching of the Lord, but does not depend on slavish, literal exactitude; which latter if we require, we overthrow their testimony, and most effectually do the work of our adversaries.
