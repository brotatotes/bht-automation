Here our report is most important. To it and St. Luke we owe<b> now in this time</b>, without which the promise might be understood of a<i> future life only</i>:—and to it alone we owe the<i> particularizing of the returns</i> made, and the words<b> with persecutions</b>, which light up the whole passage, and shew that it is the inheritance of the earth<i> in the higher sense</i> by the meek which is spoken of;—see 1 Cor. iii. 21, 22.<br><br> Observe<i> mothers</i>—nature gives us only one—but love, many (see Rom. xvi, 13). We do not read<i> fathers</i>, perhaps because of our high and absorbing relation to our Father in heaven; compare Matt. xxiii. 9. On<i> and the gospel’s</i>, Dr. Wordsworth observes, “see above, viii. 35, where this phrase (not found in the other Evangelists, see Matt. xvi. 25: Luke ix. 24) is inserted by St. Mark. Perhaps it made a greater impression upon<i> his</i> mind, because he had formerly shrunk from suffering<i> for the Gospel's sake</i>. (See Acts xiii. 13; xv. 38.) St. Mark also alone here inserts our Lord’s words,<b> with persecutions</b>, perhaps from a recollection that he had been once affrighted by persecution from doing the work of the Gospel: and desiring to prepare others to encounter trials which for a time had mastered himself.”<br><br> Here follows in Matthew the parable of the Labourers in the vineyard, ch. xx. 1–16.<br><br> This was (see Matt. xvi. 21; xvii. 22) the<i> third</i> declaration of His sufferings which the Lord had made to the disciples, and it was His<i> going before them</i>, accompanied most probably by something remarkable in his gait and manner—a boldness and determination perhaps, an eagerness, denoted in Luke xii. 50, which struck them with astonishment and fear.<br><br> “Though very little is said in the Gospels concerning our Lord’s external appearance and deportment, there are frequent indications of its<i> effects on others</i>. We do not see His glory in itself,—it could not be described,—but we read the reflection of it in them. See Matt. ix. 9, the call of St. Matthew: Matt. xxi. 12, the purging of the temple: Mark ix. 15, the feeling and behaviour of the crowd towards Him after the Transfiguration. The climax is at the betrayal, John xviii. 6, when, after His utterance of those words— ‘I am he,’—the soldiers start back, and fall to the ground.” Dr. Wordsworth.
