Here our report is most important. To it and St. Luke we owe<b> now in this time</b>, without which the promise might be understood of a<i> future life only</i>:—and to it alone we owe the<i> particularizing of the returns</i> made, and the words<b> with persecutions</b>, which light up the whole passage, and shew that it is the inheritance of the earth<i> in the higher sense</i> by the meek which is spoken of;—see 1 Cor. iii. 21, 22.
