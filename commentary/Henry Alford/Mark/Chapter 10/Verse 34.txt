 34. ]  ἐμπτ  . Mark and Luke: σταυρῶσαι ,  Matt. only , which is remarkable, as being the first intimation, in plain terms, of the death He should die. The ἄρας τὸν στ ., so often alluded to, might have had now for them a deep meaning but see Luke 18:34 . After  τοῖς ἔθν  . the subject of the verbs (  ἐμπ  .,   μαστ  . &c.) is τὰ ἔθνη .
