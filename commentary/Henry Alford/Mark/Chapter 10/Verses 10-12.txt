 10 12. ] In Matt. this saying forms part of the discourse  with the Jews . Here again Mark furnishes us with the  exact circumstantial account of the matter. On the addition, Matthew 19:10-12 , see notes there.
	We may notice, that Mark omits Matt.’s κατὰ πᾶσαν αἰτίαν in Mark 10:2 , and his μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ in Mark 10:11 ; as also does Luke ( Luk 16:18 ). The one omission seems to involve the other. The report here gives the enquiry without this particular exception. As a general rule, Mark, so accurate in circumstantial details, is less exact than Matt. in preserving the order and connexion of the discourses.
