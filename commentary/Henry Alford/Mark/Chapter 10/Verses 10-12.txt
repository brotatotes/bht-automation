<p><strong> 10 12.</strong> ] In Matt. this saying forms part of the discourse <em> with the Jews</em> . Here again Mark furnishes us with the <em> exact circumstantial</em> account of the matter. On the addition, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:10-12">Matthew 19:10-12</span> , see notes there.
	</p>
<p>We may notice, that Mark omits Matt.’s κατὰ πᾶσαν αἰτίαν in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:2">Mark 10:2</span> , and his μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:11">Mark 10:11</span> ; as also does Luke ( Luk 16:18 ). The one omission seems to involve the other. The report here gives the enquiry without this particular exception. As a general rule, Mark, so accurate in circumstantial details, is less exact than Matt. in preserving the order and connexion of the discourses.</p>
