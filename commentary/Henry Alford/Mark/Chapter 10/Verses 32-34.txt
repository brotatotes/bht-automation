 32 34. ] FULLER DECLARATION OF HIS SUFFERINGS AND DEATH. Matthew 20:17-19 . Luke 18:31-34 . (The remarkable particulars of Mar 10:32 are only found here.)
	This was (see Matthew 16:21 ; Mat 17:22 ) the  third declaration of His sufferings which the Lord had made to the disciples, and it was His  going before them , accompanied most probably by something remarkable in his gait and manner a boldness and determination perhaps, an eagerness, denoted in Luke 12:50 , which struck them with astonishment and fear. See an interesting note here in Wordsw.
	Observe, that ἦσαν and ἀναβαίνοντες must not be taken together. “They were in the way, as they went up to Jerusalem.”
