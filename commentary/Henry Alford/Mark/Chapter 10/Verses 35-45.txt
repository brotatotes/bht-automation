<p><strong> 35 45.</strong> ] AMBITIOUS REQUEST OF THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE: OUR LORDâ€™S REPLY. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:20-28">Matthew 20:20-28</span> , where see notes throughout, and especially on the difference in our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:35">Mark 10:35</span> . The two accounts of the discourse are almost verbatim the same, and that they came from one source is very apparent. Even here, however, slight deviations occur, which are unaccountable, if the one had actually before him the writing of the other. Besides, we have the whole additional particular of the baptism, with which He was to be baptized: see note on Matt.</p>
