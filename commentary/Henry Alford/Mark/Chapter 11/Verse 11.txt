	I am by no means certain that the solution proposed in the notes on Matt. is the right one, but I cannot suggest a better. When Mark, as here, relates an occurrence throughout, with such signs of an eyewitness as in Mark 11:4 , it is  very difficult to suppose that he has transposed any thing ; whereas Matt. certainly does not speak here so exactly, having transposed the anointing in Bethany: see notes on Matthew 26:2 ; Matthew 26:6 .
