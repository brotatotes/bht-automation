<b> 11.]</b> See Matthew, ver. 12, and notes on ver. 1: also on John ii. 13–18.<br><br> I am by no means certain that the solution proposed in the notes on Matthew is the right one, but I cannot suggest a better. When St. Mark, as here, relates an occurrence throughout, with such signs of an eye-witness as in ver. 4, it is<i> very difficult to suppose that he has transposed any thing</i>; whereas St. Matthew certainly does not speak here so exactly, having transposed the anointing in Bethany: see notes on Matt. xxvi. 2, 6.<br><br> The times and order of the events are here more exact than in St. Matthew, who seems to place the withering of ‘the tree<i> immediately after</i> the word spoken by our Lord.
