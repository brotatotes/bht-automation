<p><strong> ὁ γἀρ κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> οὐκ ἦν ς</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The ellipsis may be supplied, <strong> for the season was not (one) of figs,</strong> or, <strong> for the season was not (that) of figs,</strong> i.e. <em> not yet the season for figs</em> . The latter suits the context best. The tree was <em> precocious</em> , in being clothed with leaves: and if it had had on it <em> winter figs</em> , which remain on from the autumn, and ripen early the next season, they would have been <em> ripe at this time</em> . But there were none it was a <em> barren tree</em> . On the <em> import</em> of this miracle, see notes on Matt.</p>
