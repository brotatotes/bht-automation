<b> 13. the time of figs was not yet]</b> The sentence, which in the original is elliptical (<b>for the season was not of figs</b>, or<b> for it was not a season of figs</b>), may be supplied,—<b>for the season was not (one) of figs</b>,—or,<b> for the season was not (that) of figs</b>, i.e.<i> not yet the season for figs</i>. The latter suits the context bost. The tree was<i> precocious</i>, in being clothed with leaves: and if it had bad on it<i> winter figs</i>, which remain on from the autumn, and ripen early the next season, they would have been<i> ripe at this time</i>. But there were none—it was a<i> barren tree</i>. On the<i> import</i> of this miracle, see notes on Matthew.
