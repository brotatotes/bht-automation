 13. ]  εἰ ἄρα  ,  si forte , si rebus ita comparatis: see Klotz ad Devar. ii. p. 178.
	 ὁ γἀρ κ  .   οὐκ ἦν ς  . ] The ellipsis may be supplied,  for the season was not (one) of figs, or,  for the season was not (that) of figs, i.e.  not yet the season for figs . The latter suits the context best. The tree was  precocious , in being clothed with leaves: and if it had had on it  winter figs , which remain on from the autumn, and ripen early the next season, they would have been  ripe at this time . But there were none it was a  barren tree . On the  import of this miracle, see notes on Matt.
