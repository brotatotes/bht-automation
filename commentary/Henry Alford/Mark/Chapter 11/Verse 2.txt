<b>As far as ye shall find</b>, the agreement in Matthew, Mark, and Luke is nearly verbal; after that, Mark and Luke only mention the<i> foal</i>, and add,<b> on which never man sat</b>. Compare with this, Luke xxiii. 53. Our Lord’s birth, triumph, and burial were to be, in this, alike. Meyer observes of this part of the history, ‘A later tradition, sprung from the<i> sacred destination</i> of the beast (for beasts never et worked were used for sacred purposes, Num. xix. 2: Deut. xxi. 3: 1 Sam. vi. 7).’ But does it never strike such annotators, that this very usage would lead not only to the<i> narrative being so constructed</i>, but to the<i> command itself having been so given</i>?
