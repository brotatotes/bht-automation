 3.   ὁ κύρ  …   ὧδε ] The pres. ἀποστέλλει , is used of future things whose occurrence is undoubted; see Matthew 17:11 ; Mat 11:3 alli [35] .: but the words are somewhat ambiguous. From the ancient interpolation of πάλιν , it seems that they were understood  all to belong to ὁ κύριος ‘  the Lord hath need of it, and will immediately send it [  back ].’ Lachm., by printing the words without a stop, evidently adopts this rendering: and Origen, tom. xvi. in Matt. § 16, vol. iii. p. 741, favours it. But verisimilitude seems to me to be against it: and the final clause in Mark 11:6 , καὶ ἀφῆκαν αὐτούς , appears to correspond with this. So that I would understand it as in E. V.:  and straightway he (the speaker or owner)  will send it hither.
