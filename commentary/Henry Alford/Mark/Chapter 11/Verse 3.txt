<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> ὁ κύρ</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ὧδε</strong> ] The pres. ἀποστέλλει , is used of future things whose occurrence is undoubted; see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:11">Matthew 17:11</span> ; Mat 11:3 alli [35] .: but the words are somewhat ambiguous. From the ancient interpolation of πάλιν , it seems that they were understood <em> all to belong to</em> ὁ κύριος ‘ <em> the Lord hath need of it, and will immediately send it</em> [ <em> back</em> ].’ Lachm., by printing the words without a stop, evidently adopts this rendering: and Origen, tom. xvi. in Matt. § 16, vol. iii. p. 741, favours it. But verisimilitude seems to me to be against it: and the final clause in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:6">Mark 11:6</span> , καὶ ἀφῆκαν αὐτούς , appears to correspond with this. So that I would understand it as in E. V.: <strong> and straightway he</strong> (the speaker or owner) <strong> will send it hither.
