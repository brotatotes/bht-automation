<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] The report of one of those sent: qu. Peter?

<p><strong> ἄμφοδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> (a road leading round a place) is probably <strong> the street</strong> : see reff. Wordsw. interprets it, ‘ <em> the back way, which led round the house</em> :’ But there does not appear to be any reason for supposing the ἀμφι - to refer to the <em> house</em> , rather than to the whole block, or neighbourhood, of houses, round about which the street led. [Archbp. Trench, on the A.V. p. 116. would render it “ <em> a way round</em> ,” “ <em> a crooked lane</em> .”]</p>
