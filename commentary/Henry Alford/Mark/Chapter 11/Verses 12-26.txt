 12 26. ] THE BARREN FIG-TREE. THE CLEANSING OF THE TEMPLE. Matthew 21:12-22 . Our account here bears strong marks of being that of a beholder and hearer: e.g.  ἐξελθ  .   αὐ  .   ἀπὸ Βηθ  .,   μακρόθεν  ,   ἔχουσαν φύλλα  ,   καὶ ἤκουον οἱ μαθ  .   αὐτ  .
	The times and order of the events are here more exact than in Matt., who places the withering of the tree  immediately after the word spoken by our Lord.
