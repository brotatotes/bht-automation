<b> 26. in the history the Bush (so also in Luke)]</b> The words may in the original mean either, ‘<i>in the chapter</i> containing the history of God appearing in the Bush,’ or,<i> ‘when he was at</i> the Bush.’ The former is the more probable, on account of the construction of the verse in our text. In Luke, if we had his account alone, the other rendering might be admissible, ‘Moses testified, at the Bush:’ but this will not answer in our text.
