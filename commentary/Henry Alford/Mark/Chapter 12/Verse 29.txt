In this citation the Vat. reading διανοίας and the Alex. καρδίας are <em> combined:</em> and ἰσχύος ═ δυνάμεως . “Thou shalt love the Lord with spirit, soul, and body:” with the inner spirit, and the outer life. This is <em> faith working by love:</em> for κ . ὁ θ . ἡμῶν is the language of <em> faith</em> .</p>
