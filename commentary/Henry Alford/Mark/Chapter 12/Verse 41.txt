<b> 41. the treasury]</b> This is usually understood of<i> thirteen chests</i>, which stood in the court of the women, into which were thrown contributions for the temple, or the tribute (of Matt. xvii. 24). But it is hardly likely that<i> they</i> would be called<i> the treasury</i>, and we hear of a<i> building</i> by this name in Josephus. Lucke believes<i> some part the court of the women</i> to be intended, perhaps a chamber in connexion with these chests.
