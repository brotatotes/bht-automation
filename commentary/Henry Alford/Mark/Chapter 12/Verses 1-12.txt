1 12.] PARABLE OF THE VINEYARD LET OUT TO HUSBANDMEN. This parable is, for the most part, identical with that in Matthew 21:33-46 , and Luke 20:9-19 . The  number , and  treatment of the servants sent, is enlarged on here; and in Mar 12:4 there occurs the singular word  κεφαλαιόω  , which appears to be used by a solœcism for κεφαλίζω , ‘  to wound in the head .’ Some have rendered it, ‘  they made short work with him ,’ which is the more usual sense of the word, but not probable here; for they  did not kill him, but disgracefully used him.
	I must not allow any opportunity to pass of directing attention to the  sort of difference, in similarity, between these three reports, and observing that no origin of that difference is imaginable, except the  gradual deflection of accounts from a common, or a parallel, source .
