 38 40. ] DENUNCIATION OF THE SCRIBES. Luke 20:45-47 . These verses, nearly verbatim the same in the two Evangelists, and derived from a common report, are an abridgment of the discourse which occupies the greater part of Matthew 23:0 with the additions of  θελ  .   ἐν στολ  .   περιπ  ., and  οἱ κατέσθ  .…   κρῖμα (see [40] Matt., text, and var. readd.).

They  devoured widows’ houses , by attaching them to themselves, and so persuading them to minister to them of their substance. A trace of this practice (but there out of gratitude and love) on the part of the Jewish women, is found in Luke 8:2-3 . What words can better describe the corrupt practices of the so-called priesthood of Rome, than these of our Lord? The  πρόφασις was, to make their sanctity appear to these women, and so win their favour.
