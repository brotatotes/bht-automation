<p><strong> 38 40.</strong> ] DENUNCIATION OF THE SCRIBES. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:45-47">Luke 20:45-47</span> . These verses, nearly verbatim the same in the two Evangelists, and derived from a common report, are an abridgment of the discourse which occupies the greater part of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:0">Matthew 23:0</span> with the additions of <strong> θελ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν στολ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> περιπ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> and <strong> οἱ κατέσθ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> κρῖμα</strong> (see [40] Matt., text, and var. readd.). The words <strong> ἐν τῇ διδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> seem to imply that Mark <em> understood it as a compendium</em> .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [40] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .

<p><strong> ἀσπασμούς</strong> and the following accusatives are governed. by <strong> θελόντων</strong> <strong> .
	</strong></p>
<p><strong> οἱ κατέσθοντες</strong> may either be dependent on the preceding by a broken construction, or may be the beginning of a new sentence of exclamation, as Meyer takes it. The former is to me the more probable, and I have punctuated accordingly. It is a change of construction not without example in the classics: Herod. i. 51, Λακεδαιμονίων φαμένων εἶναι ἀνάθεμα , οὐκ ὀρθῶς λέγοντες . See also reff. The art. points them out graphically. They <em> devoured widows’ houses</em> , by attaching them to themselves, and so persuading them to minister to them of their substance. A trace of this practice (but there out of gratitude and love) on the part of the Jewish women, is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:2-3">Luke 8:2-3</span> . What words can better describe the corrupt practices of the so-called priesthood of Rome, than these of our Lord? The <strong> πρόφασις</strong> was, to make their sanctity appear to these women, and so win their favour.
