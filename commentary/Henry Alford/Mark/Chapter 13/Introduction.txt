CHAP.  13. ] JESUS PROPHESIES OF HIS COMING, AND OF THE TIMES OF THE END. Matthew 24:0 .Luke 21:5-36; Luke 21:5-36 . The accounts are apparently distinct, and each contains some fragments which have escaped the others. On the  matter of the prophecy, I have fully commented in Matt., where see notes: also those on Luke.
