<p><strong> 30. </strong> <strong> ἡ γενεὰ αὕτη</strong> ] See on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:34">Matthew 24:34</span> . Meyer, who is strongly for the literal and exact γενεά , states in a note that γενεά never <em> absolutely means</em> ‘nation,’ but that it may by the context acquire this <em> sense accidentally</em> from its meaning as <em> race, ‘progenies</em> .’ This is exactly what is here wanted. Never were a nation so completely one <strong> γενεά</strong> <strong> ,</strong> in all accuracy of meaning, as the Jewish people.</p>
