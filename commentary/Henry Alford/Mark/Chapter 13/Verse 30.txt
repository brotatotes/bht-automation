 30.   ἡ γενεὰ αὕτη ] See on Matthew 24:34 . Meyer, who is strongly for the literal and exact γενεά , states in a note that γενεά never  absolutely means ‘nation,’ but that it may by the context acquire this  sense accidentally from its meaning as  race, ‘progenies .’ This is exactly what is here wanted. Never were a nation so completely one  γενεά  , in all accuracy of meaning, as the Jewish people.
