<b> 32.]</b> This is one of those things which the Father hath<i> put in his own power</i>, Acts i. 7, and with which<i> the Son</i>, in his mediatorial office, is not acquainted: see on Matthew. We must not deal unfaithfully with a plain and solemn assertion of our (and what can be more so than<b> nor even the Son</b>, in which by the<b> nor even</b> He is<i> not below</i> but<i> above</i> the angels?) by such evasions as “He does not know it so as to<b> reveal</b> it to us,” or as Aug., “He did not so know it as then to indicate it to the disciples.” Of such a sense there is not a hint in the context: nay, it is altogether alien from it. The account given by the orthodox Lutherans, as represented by Meyer, that our Lord knew this by<i> possession</i>, but not by<i> use</i>, is right enough, if at the same time it is carefully remembered, that it was this possession of which He emptied Himself when He became man for us, and which it belongs to the very essence of His mediatorial kingdom to hold in subjection to the Father.<br><br> The<b> porter</b> is the<b> door-porter</b>, whose office it would be to look out for approaching travellers,—answering especially to the ministers of the word, who are (Ezek. xxxiii.)<i> watchmen</i> to God’s church.
