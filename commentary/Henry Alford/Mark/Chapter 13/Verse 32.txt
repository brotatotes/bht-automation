 32. ] This is one of those things which the Father hath  put in his own power , Acts 1:7 , and with which  the Son , in his mediatorial office, is not acquainted: see on Matt. We must not deal unfaithfully with a plain and solemn assertion of our Lord (and what can be more so than οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός , in which by the οὐδέ He is  not below but  above the angels?) by such evasions as “He does not know it so as to  reveal it to us,” Wordsw. (“non ita sciebat ut tunc discipulis indicaret.” Aug [42] de Trin. xii. 3 (it should be i. 12 (23), vol. viii.)). Of such a sense there is not a hint in the context: nay, it is altogether alien from it. The account given by the orthodox Lutherans, as represented by Meyer, that our Lord knew this κατὰ κτῆσιν , but not κατὰ χρῆσιν , is right enough if at the same time it is carefully remembered, that it was this κτῆσις of which He emptied Himself when He became man for us, and which it belongs to the very essence of His mediatorial kingdom to hold in subjection to the Father.
