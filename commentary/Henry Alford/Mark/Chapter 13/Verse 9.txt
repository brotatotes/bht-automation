 9. ]  ἀρχαί is put forward for emphasis the  mere beginnings.
	 ὑμεῖς likewise has the emphasis let  your care be …
	 εἰς συναγ  ., a pregnant construction ‘  ye shall be taken into the synagogues and beaten there .’ So also in Mark 13:16 . Bp. Wordsw. explains the εἰς , “Ye will be exposed before the eyes of congregations in synagogues, for their pleasure:” and  ἐν συν . would mean, “in the buildings, without any reference to the people in them.” But how will this apply to ὁ εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν ὤν Mar 13:16 ? Meyer, with Lachmann alli [41] ., would punctuate after συναγωγάς , and take δαρήσεσθε by itself. This is most improbable, especially when we remember that the synagogues were the places where the scourging was inflicted (see Act 22:19 ), not to mention the objection to taking the verb thus by itself, which seems to me (against Meyer) alien from the character of the discourse.
