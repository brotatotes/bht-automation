<p><strong> εἰς συναγ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> a pregnant construction ‘ <em> ye shall be taken into the synagogues and beaten there</em> .’ So also in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:16">Mark 13:16</span> . Bp. Wordsw. explains the εἰς , “Ye will be exposed before the eyes of congregations in synagogues, for their pleasure:” and <strong> ἐν</strong> συν . would mean, “in the buildings, without any reference to the people in them.” But how will this apply to ὁ εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν ὤν Mar 13:16 ? Meyer, with Lachmann alli [41] ., would punctuate after συναγωγάς , and take δαρήσεσθε by itself. This is most improbable, especially when we remember that the synagogues were the places where the scourging was inflicted (see Act 22:19 ), not to mention the objection to taking the verb thus by itself, which seems to me (against Meyer) alien from the character of the discourse.
