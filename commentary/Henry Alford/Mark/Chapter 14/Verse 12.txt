 12. ]  ὅτε τὸ π  .   ἔθυον  , like Luke’s expression  ᾗ ἔδει θύεσθαι τὸ π ., denotes the  ordinary day , when they (i.e. the Jews) sacrificed the Passover; for that the Lord ate His Passover on that day, and at the usual time, is the  impression conveyed by the testimony of the three Evangelists: see notes on Matthew 26:17 , and Luke 22:7 .
	We may notice that if this Gospel, as traditionally reported, was drawn up under the superintendence of Peter, we could hardly have failed to have the  names of the two disciples given; nor again would our narrator have missed (and the omission is an important one) the fact that  the Lord first gave the command , to go and prepare the Passover which  Luke  only relates.
	It becomes a duty to warn students of the sacred word against fanciful interpretations. A respected Commentator of our own day explains the pitcher of water, which led the way to the room where the last Supper was celebrated, to mean “the baptismal grace” which we have “in earthen vessels,” which “leads on to other graces, even to the Communion of Christ’s Body and Blood.”
