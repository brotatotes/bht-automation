<p><strong> 19.</strong> ] <strong> εἷς κατά</strong> (or καθ ʼ) <strong> εἷς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> a later Greek phrase in which the preposition serves merely as an adverb of distribution, is treated by Winer, § 37. 3. The <strong> ἄλλος</strong> following is used as if not εἷς κατὰ εἷς but only εἷς had been used. Meyer remarks that such broken construction is suitable to the <em> graphic</em> tendency of our Evangelist.</p>
