<b> 3. spikenard]</b> The original, literally rendered, is as Bishop Jeremy Taylor has it in his Life of Christ,§15, “nard pistick.” But it is quite uncertain what this epithet “pistick” means. The discussion may be seen in my Greek Testament. Here I can only state that the two possible explanations are (1)<i> genuine</i>,<i> unadulterated;</i> and (2)<i> liquid</i>, or<i> drinkable</i>. There clearly appears to have been a certain sort of ointment which they<i> drank</i>: see citations as above. The word is nowhere found in the classics, only here and in the parallel place in St. John, and some later writers.
