<b> 3. spikenard]</b> The original, literally rendered, is as Bishop Jeremy Taylor has it in his Life of Christ,§15, “nard pistick.” But it is quite uncertain what this epithet “pistick” means. The discussion may be seen in my Greek Testament. Here I can only state that the two possible explanations are (1)<i> genuine</i>,<i> unadulterated;</i> and (2)<i> liquid</i>, or<i> drinkable</i>. There clearly appears to have been a certain sort of ointment which they<i> drank</i>: see citations as above. The word is nowhere found in the classics, only here and in the parallel place in St. John, and some later writers.<br><br><b> brake the box</b> can hardly mean only having broken the resin with which the cork was sealed. In ch v. 4, John xix, 36, Rev. ii. 27, the word is of<i> breaking</i>, properly so called: and I see no objection to supposing that the box (i. e. of course the narrow neck of it) was crushed in the hand, and the ointment thus poured over His head. The feet would then (John xii. 3) be anointed with what remained on the hands of Mary, or in the broken vase (see note on Luke vii. 38).
