<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> νάρδου πιστικῆς</strong> ] It seems impossible to assign any certain, or even probable meaning, to <strong> πιστικῆς</strong> (a word found here and in John’s narrative only). The Vulg. and the lat. mss. <em> c ff</em> 2 <em> q</em> render it “ <em> spicati</em> .” The ancient Commentators give us nothing but conjecture. Euthymius and Theophylact interpret it “ <em> genuine:</em> ” καταπεπιστευμένην εἰς καθαρότητα , Euth.; ἄδολον καὶ μετὰ πίστεως κατασκευασθεῖσαν , Theophyl.; ‘ <em> veram et absque dolo</em> ,’ Jerome. Augustine supposes it to refer to some <em> place</em> from which the nard came. Origen’s comment on the passage is lost. The expression no where occurs in the classics, nor in Clement of Alex., who gives a long account (Pædagog. ii. 8, pp. 76 79 [43] ) of <em> ointments</em> . The word can therefore hardly signify <em> any particular kind of ointment</em> technically so called.
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [43] By these symbols are designated the portions of two ancient MSS., discernible (as also are fragments of Ulphilas’ gothic version) under the later writing of a volume known as the Codex Carolinus in the Ducal Library at Wolfenbüttel. P (GUELPHERBYTANUS A) contains fragments of each of the Gospels. Q (GUELPH. B) fragments of Luke and John. Both are probably of the <em> sixth century</em> . They were edited by F. A. Knittel in 1762; and, more thoroughly, by Tischendorf in 1860 [1869], Monumenta Sacra, vol. iii. [vi.]
	</p>
<p>The modern interpretations of the word are principally of two kinds: the first, agreeing with Euth. and Theophyl., ‘ <em> genuine</em> ,’ ‘ <em> unadulterated;</em> ’ which sense however of the word does not any where else occur. It is used transitively for πειστικός , ‘ <em> persuasive</em> ,’ by Aristotle (Rhet. i. 2), and in some later writers for πιστός , as ὁ πιστικώτατος τῶν θεραπόντων , Cedrenus, Annal., cited by Lücke on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3">John 12:3</span> . Euseb. also uses the word (Demonstr. Evang. ix. vol. iv. p. 684, ed. Migne), but in the sense of ‘ <em> pertaining to the faith</em> ,’ as his Latin translator renders it, or, as Lücke thinks, perhaps ‘ <em> potable</em> ,’ as a derivative of πιστός (from πίνω ).
	</p>
<p>This brings us to the second modern interpretation, which makes πιστικός ‘ <em> liquid</em> ,’ ‘ <em> potable</em> ,’ and derives it as above. There certainly was <em> a kind of ointment which they drank;</em> for Athenæus (xv. 39, p. 689) quotes from Hicesius, τῶν μύρων ἃ μέν ἐστι χρίματα , ἃ δ ʼ ἀλείμματα . καὶ ῥόδινον μὲν <strong> πρὸς πότον ἐπιτήδειον</strong> , ἔτι δὲ μύρσινον , μήλινον · τοῦτο δέ ἐστι καὶ εὐστόμαχον καὶ ληθαργικοῖς χρήσιμον … καὶ ἡ στακτὴ <strong> δ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἐπιτήδειος πρὸς πότον</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ἔτι δὲ <strong> νάρδος</strong> . The only objection to this interpretation is, that the word is no where found which however is not so decisive as in the last case, for, as πιστικός from πιστός , ‘faithful,’ so there might be πιστικός from πιστός , ‘potable’ and from being a term confined to dealers in ointments, it might have escaped notice elsewhere.
	</p>
<p>Lücke (from whom the substance of this note is derived) seems to incline to Augustine’s conjecture (see above): but then surely the name would be <em> more common</em> , as ‘balm of Gilead,’ &amp;c.
	</p>
<p>The uncertainty being so great, the best rendering would be to leave the word <em> untranslated</em> , as Jer. Taylor does in his “Life of Christ” (sect. 15): ‘Nard Pistick.’ Bp. Wordsw. sees in the word the mystical sense, that “offerings to Christ should be … the fruits of a lively and loving πίστις , or faith, in Him.”
	</p>
<p><strong> συντρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὴν ἀλάβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> can hardly mean only having broken the resin with which the cork was sealed. In ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:4">Mark 5:4</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:36">John 19:36</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span> , the word is used of <em> breaking</em> , properly so called: and I see no objection to supposing that the ἀλάβαστρον was crushed in the hand, and the ointment thus poured over His head. The feet would then ( Joh 12:3 ) be anointed with what remained on the hands of Mary, or in the broken vase (see note on Luk 7:38 ).</p>
