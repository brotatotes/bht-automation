 41.   ἀπέχει ] Scil. your γρηγορεῖν μετ ʼ ἐμοῦ . The Lord had no need of it any more, now that the hour had come: not, as Bengel, Kuinoel, alli [45] ., ‘Satis somnorum est:’ this, as Meyer observes, is refuted by the καθεύδετε λοιπόν . This meaning of ἀπέχει ,  sufficit , is found in very few and late, but those quite sufficient examples. Meyer mentions Pseud.-Anacreon, Od. xxviii. 33,  ἀπέχει  , βλέπω γὰρ αὐτήν : and Cyril on Haggai 2:9 , ἐμὸν φησὶ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ ἐμὸν τὸ χρυσίον · τουτέστιν  ἀπέχει  , καὶ πεπλήρωμαι , καὶ δεδέημαι τῶν τοιούτων οὐδενός .
