	 σύσσημον is a word belonging to later Greek. We have in Diod. Sic. xx. 42, ἦρε τὸ συγκείμενον πρὸς μάχην  σύσσημον  , ἀσπίδα κεχρυσωμένην . See other examples in Kypke.
	 ἀπάγετε ἀσφαλῶς ] It does not quite appear whether  ἀσφαλῶς is to be subjectively taken, ‘  with confidence; ’ or objectively, ‘  safely .’ Some suppose that it has an ironical meaning q. d. ‘He will know how to rescue himself take care that you keep Him safe.’ This of course depends upon the view taken of the whole character and purpose of Judas, on which see notes at Matthew 26:14 ; Matthew 27:3 .
