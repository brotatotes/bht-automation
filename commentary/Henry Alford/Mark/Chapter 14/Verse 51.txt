<b> 51.]</b> It is impossible to determine, and therefore idle to enquire,<i> who this was</i>. Epiphanius, in recounting the traditional austerities of James the brother of the Lord, says, “that he never wore a second inner garment, but strictly used one wrapper of linen only, as it says in the Gospel, The young man fled and left the linen cloth with which he was girt.” Chrysostom and others supposed it to have been St. John: and there have been other conjectures. It seems to have been some attached disciple of the Lord (probably well known to the readers of Mark), who had gone to his nightly rest, and had been aroused by the intelligence. The<i> disciples</i> were not laid hold of:—this perhaps was throwing some obstacle in the way of the removal of Jesus: or he may have been laid hold of merely in wantonness, from his unusual garb.
