 53.   ἀρχιερέα ]  Caiaphas, de facto , and in the view of our narrator; so Matt. and Luke: but Jesus was  first taken before  Annas , who was  de jure the high-priest: see John 18:12-23 . It is not easy to interpret  συνέρχονται αὐτῷ  . Meyer, relying on the fact that the dative after συνέρχεσθαι is always one of companionship, maintains that αὐτῷ refers to our Lord ‘  there come with him .’ And so Winer, Exodus 6:0 , § 31. 5 ad fin. But surely this is very precarious. For 1) St. Mark uses this verb once only besides here, and then absolutely. And there could be no difficulty in taking it thus here and applying αὐτῷ to the High-priest as a dative of  direction . And 2) could it be said of one whom they ἀπήγαγον , that he ἔρχεται to the High-priest? I venture therefore to prefer the usual construction of the words, ‘  there come together to him .’ The E. V. has ‘  with him were assembled; ’ and so Winer in former editions of his Grammar.
