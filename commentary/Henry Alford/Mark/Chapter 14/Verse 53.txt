<p><strong> 53. </strong> <strong> ἀρχιερέα</strong> ] <em> Caiaphas, de facto</em> , and in the view of our narrator; so Matt. and Luke: but Jesus was <em> first</em> taken before <em> Annas</em> , who was <em> de jure</em> the high-priest: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:12-23">John 18:12-23</span> . It is not easy to interpret <strong> συνέρχονται αὐτῷ</strong> <strong> .</strong> Meyer, relying on the fact that the dative after συνέρχεσθαι is always one of companionship, maintains that αὐτῷ refers to our Lord ‘ <em> there come with him</em> .’ And so Winer, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+6:0">Exodus 6:0</span> , § 31. 5 ad fin. But surely this is very precarious. For 1) St. Mark uses this verb once only besides here, and then absolutely. And there could be no difficulty in taking it thus here and applying αὐτῷ to the High-priest as a dative of <em> direction</em> . And 2) could it be said of one whom they ἀπήγαγον , that he ἔρχεται to the High-priest? I venture therefore to prefer the usual construction of the words, ‘ <em> there come together to him</em> .’ The E. V. has ‘ <em> with him were assembled;</em> ’ and so Winer in former editions of his Grammar.</p>
