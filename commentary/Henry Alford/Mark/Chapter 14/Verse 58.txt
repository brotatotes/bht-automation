<p><strong> 58.</strong> ] <strong> ἡμεῖς</strong> and <strong> ἐγώ</strong> are emphatic. Some have imagined (De Wette, Meyer) that they find in these words <strong> χειροπ</strong> <strong> .</strong> and <strong> ἀχειρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> traces of later Christian tradition, and an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:48">Acts 7:48</span> ; but such conjectures are at best very unsafe, and the words are quite as likely to have been uttered by the Lord as they here stand. The allusion is probably to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+2:34">Daniel 2:34</span> .</p>
