 72.   ἐπιβαλών ] No entirely satisfactory meaning has yet been given for this word. 1) Hammond and Palairet supply τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς τῷ Ἰησοῦ but besides this being most fanciful,  the fact was not so: see Luke 22:61 . Luke 22:2 ) The vulgate, Syriac [50] ., Euth., Thl., Luth., Kuin., take ἐπιβαλὼν ἔκλαιεν for ἐπέβαλεν κλαίειν , ‘  he began to weep .’ But granting that this is a later meaning of the word (Kuin. cites ἐπέβαλε τερετίζειν , cantillare cœpit, Diog. Laërt. vi. 2. 4, and Suid [51] has ἐπέβαλεν · ἤρξατο ), yet this participial construction will not bear that interpretation. Acts 11:4 , which Kuin. cites to support it, has quite another meaning see note there. 3) Grot., Le Clerc, alli [52] . render it ‘  addens flevit ’ i.e. he continued weeping (so ἐπιβαλὼν ἐρωτᾶν Theophr. Char. 8. ἐπιβαλών φησι Diod. Sic. p. 345 B); but then his  beginning to weep would have been noticed before. Grot. wants to give it the sense of ‘  prœterea .’ 4) Beza, Raphel, Bretschn., Wahl, alli [53] . say, ‘  quum se foras projecisset ;’ but although ἐπιβάλλειν τινί or ἐπί τι may mean ‘  to rush upon ’ (see 1Ma 4:2 ), it cannot stand  alone in this meaning. The chief support of this sense is the ἐξελθὼν ἔξω of Matt. and Luke: but this cannot decide the matter. 5) Thl. alli [54] . supply τὸ ἱμάτιον τῇ κεφαλῇ , ‘  casting or drawing his mantle over his head ,’ but this, without any precedent for such an ellipsis, although it suits the sense very well, appears fanciful. 6) Wets [55] . alli [56] . take it for ‘  attendere ,’ and some supply τῇ ἀλεκτοροφωνίᾳ , others τῷ ῥήματι : Wets [57] . and Kypke have however shewn that the word is used  absolutely in this sense, in Polyb. and other late writers. One example given by Kypke is much to the point: ‘ ἀεὶ μὲν γινώσκει , ἄλλως δὲ καὶ ἄλλως ἐπιβάλλει , καὶ μᾶλλόν ἐστιν ὅτε καὶ ἧττον , semper quidem cognoscit, sed diversis modis res animadvertit, imo magis interdum et minus:’ Hierocl. in carm. Pythag. p. 14.

	The above list is taken mainly from De Wette (Exeg. Handb. p. 247), who while preferring this last sense, yet thinks that it was before expressed in ἀνεμνήσθη . But ἐπιβαλών contains more than ἀνεμν .:  that was the  bare momentary remembrance the ῥῆμα  occurred to him;  this is the  thinking , or, as we sometimes say,  casting it over ; going back step by step through the sad history. This sense, though not wholly satisfactory, appears to me the best.
	In  ἔκλαιεν  , Bp. Wordsw. well points out the imperf. “wept, and continued weeping: something more than ἔκλαυσε .”
