<p><strong> 72. </strong> <strong> ἐπιβαλών</strong> ] No entirely satisfactory meaning has yet been given for this word. 1) Hammond and Palairet supply τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς τῷ Ἰησοῦ but besides this being most fanciful, <em> the fact was not so:</em> see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61">Luke 22:61</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:2">Luke 22:2</span> ) The vulgate, Syriac [50] ., Euth., Thl., Luth., Kuin., take ἐπιβαλὼν ἔκλαιεν for ἐπέβαλεν κλαίειν , ‘ <em> he began to weep</em> .’ But granting that this is a later meaning of the word (Kuin. cites ἐπέβαλε τερετίζειν , cantillare cœpit, Diog. Laërt. vi. 2. 4, and Suid [51] has ἐπέβαλεν · ἤρξατο ), yet this participial construction will not bear that interpretation. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:4">Acts 11:4</span> , which Kuin. cites to support it, has quite another meaning see note there. 3) Grot., Le Clerc, alli [52] . render it ‘ <em> addens flevit</em> ’ i.e. he continued weeping (so ἐπιβαλὼν ἐρωτᾶν Theophr. Char. 8. ἐπιβαλών φησι Diod. Sic. p. 345 B); but then his <em> beginning</em> to weep would have been noticed before. Grot. wants to give it the sense of ‘ <em> prœterea</em> .’ 4) Beza, Raphel, Bretschn., Wahl, alli [53] . say, ‘ <em> quum se foras projecisset</em> ;’ but although ἐπιβάλλειν τινί or ἐπί τι may mean ‘ <em> to rush upon</em> ’ (see 1Ma 4:2 ), it cannot stand <em> alone</em> in this meaning. The chief support of this sense is the ἐξελθὼν ἔξω of Matt. and Luke: but this cannot decide the matter. 5) Thl. alli [54] . supply τὸ ἱμάτιον τῇ κεφαλῇ , ‘ <em> casting or drawing his mantle over his head</em> ,’ but this, without any precedent for such an ellipsis, although it suits the sense very well, appears fanciful. 6) Wets [55] . alli [56] . take it for ‘ <em> attendere</em> ,’ and some supply τῇ ἀλεκτοροφωνίᾳ , others τῷ ῥήματι : Wets [57] . and Kypke have however shewn that the word is used <em> absolutely</em> in this sense, in Polyb. and other late writers. One example given by Kypke is much to the point: ‘ ἀεὶ μὲν γινώσκει , ἄλλως δὲ καὶ ἄλλως ἐπιβάλλει , καὶ μᾶλλόν ἐστιν ὅτε καὶ ἧττον , semper quidem cognoscit, sed diversis modis res animadvertit, imo magis interdum et minus:’ Hierocl. in carm. Pythag. p. 14.

<p>The above list is taken mainly from De Wette (Exeg. Handb. p. 247), who while preferring this last sense, yet thinks that it was before expressed in ἀνεμνήσθη . But ἐπιβαλών contains more than ἀνεμν .: <em> that</em> was the <em> bare momentary remembrance</em> the ῥῆμα <em> occurred</em> to him; <em> this</em> is the <em> thinking</em> , or, as we sometimes say, <strong> casting it over</strong> ; going back step by step through the sad history. This sense, though not wholly satisfactory, appears to me the best.
