 1, 2. ] CONSPIRACY OF THE JEWISH AUTHORITIES AGAINST JESUS. Matthew 26:1-5 .Luke 22:1-2; Luke 22:1-2 . The account of the events preceding the passion in our Gospel takes a middle rank between those of Matt. and Luke. It contains very few words which are not to be found in one or other of them; but at the same time the variations from both are so frequent and irregular, as in my opinion wholly to preclude the idea that Mark had ever seen either. The minute analysis of any passage in the three will, I think, convince an unprejudiced examiner of this.
	On the chronological difficulties which beset this part of the Gospel history, see note on Matthew 26:17 .
