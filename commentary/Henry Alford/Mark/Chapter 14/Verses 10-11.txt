<p><strong> 10, 11.</strong> ] COMPACT OF JUDAS WITH THE CHIEF PRIESTS TO BETRAY HIM. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:14-16">Matthew 26:14-16</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:3-6">Luke 22:3-6</span> .

The ὁ before εἷς untranslatable in English: ‘ <em> that</em> one of the twelve’ is too strongly demonstrative: and yet ὁ is demonstrative, and expresses much.</p>
