<p><strong> 3 9.</strong> ] THE ANOINTING AT BETHANY. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:1-8">3 John 1:1-8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:1-8">3 John 1:1-8</span><span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:1-8">3 John 1:1-8</span> . (On <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36-50">Luke 7:36-50</span> , see note there.) The whole narrative has remarkable points of similarity with that of John, and is used by Professor Bleek (Beiträge zur Evangelienkritik, p. 83) as one of the indications that Mark <em> had knowledge of and used</em> the Gospel of John. My own view, as explained in the general Prolegomena, leads me to a different conclusion.

<p>I have already remarked (note on Mat 26:3 ), that while Matt. seems to have preserved trace of the parenthetic nature of this narrative, by his <strong> τοῦ δὲ Ἰ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γενομένου</strong> ( Mar 14:6 ), and <strong> τότε πορευθείς</strong> ( Mar 14:14 ), such trace altogether fails in our account. It proceeds <em> as if continuous</em> .</p>
