<p><strong> 17.</strong> ] We have here a curious instance of a word used in two accounts in the same part of the narrative, but applied to different things, in <strong> περιτιθέασιν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> here said of the <em> crown of thorns</em> , in Matt. of the <em> robe</em> (see Prolegg. ch. i. § iii., iv.).
	</p>
<p><strong> πορφύρα</strong> is vaguely used, to signify different shades of red, and is especially convertible with <em> crimson</em> = κοκκίνη Matt.</p>
