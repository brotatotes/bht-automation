<b> 25. the third hour]</b> This date is in agreement with the subsequent account, ver. 33, and its parallel in Matthew and Luke, but, as now standing unexplained,<i> inconsistent with John</i>, xix. 14, where it is said to have been about the sixth hour at the time of the exhibition of our Lord by Pilate. I own I see no satisfactory way of reconciling these accounts, unless there has been (see note on John) some very early erratum in our copies, or unless it can be shewn<i> from other grounds than the difficulty before us</i>, that John’s<i> reckoning of time</i> differs from that employed in the other Evangelists. The difficulty is of a kind in no way affecting the authenticity of the narrative, nor the truthfulness of each Evangelist; but requires some solution to the furnishing of which we are not competent. It is preposterous to imagine that two<i> such accounts as these</i> of the proceedings of<i> so eventful a day</i> should differ by<i> three whole hours</i> in their apportionment of its occurrences. So that it may fairly be presumed, that<i> some different method of calculation</i> has given rise to the present discrepancy. Meanwhile the chronology of our<i> text</i>,—as being carried on through the day, and as allowing time both for the trial, and the events of the crucifixion,—is that which will I believe be generally concurred in. All the other solutions (so called) of the difficulty are not worth relating.
