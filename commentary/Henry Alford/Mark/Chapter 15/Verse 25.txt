 25.   ὥρα τρίτη ] This date is in agreement with the subsequent account, Mark 15:33 , and its [59] in Matt. and Luke, but, as now standing unexplained,  inconsistent with John , John 19:14 , where it is said to have been about the  sixth hour at the time of the exhibition of our Lord by Pilate. I own I see no satisfactory way of reconciling these accounts, unless there has been (see note on John) some very early erratum in our copies, or unless it can be shewn  from other grounds than the difficulty before us , that John’s  reckoning of time differs from that employed in the other Evangelists. The difficulty is of a kind in no way affecting the authenticity of the narrative, nor the truthfulness of each Evangelist; but requires some solution to the furnishing of which  we are not competent . It is preposterous to imagine that two  such accounts as these of the proceedings of  so eventful a day should differ by  three whole hours in their apportionment of its occurrences. So that it may fairly be  presumed , that  some different method of calculation has given rise to the present discrepancy. Meanwhile the chronology of  our text , as being carried on through the day, and as allowing time both for the trial, and the events of the crucifixion, is that which will I believe be generally concurred in.
	 [59] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
	All the other solutions (so called) of the difficulty are not worth relating.
