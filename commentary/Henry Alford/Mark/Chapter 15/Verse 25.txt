<p><strong> 25. </strong> <strong> ὥρα τρίτη</strong> ] This date is in agreement with the subsequent account, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:33">Mark 15:33</span> , and its [59] in Matt. and Luke, but, as now standing unexplained, <em> inconsistent with John</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:14">John 19:14</span> , where it is said to have been about the <em> sixth hour</em> at the time of the exhibition of our Lord by Pilate. I own I see no satisfactory way of reconciling these accounts, unless there has been (see note on John) some very early erratum in our copies, or unless it can be shewn <em> from other grounds than the difficulty before us</em> , that John’s <em> reckoning of time</em> differs from that employed in the other Evangelists. The difficulty is of a kind in no way affecting the authenticity of the narrative, nor the truthfulness of each Evangelist; but requires some solution to the furnishing of which <em> we are not competent</em> . It is preposterous to imagine that two <em> such accounts as these</em> of the proceedings of <em> so eventful a day</em> should differ by <em> three whole hours</em> in their apportionment of its occurrences. So that it may fairly be <em> presumed</em> , that <em> some different method of calculation</em> has given rise to the present discrepancy. Meanwhile the chronology of <em> our text</em> , as being carried on through the day, and as allowing time both for the trial, and the events of the crucifixion, is that which will I believe be generally concurred in.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [59] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .

<p>All the other solutions (so called) of the difficulty are not worth relating.</p>
