 42.   παρασκ  .,   ὅ ἐστι προσάβ  . ] The Friday afternoon ( ἡ παρασκ ., “the name by which Friday is now generally known in Asia and Greece.” Wordsw.) before  sunset , at which time the Sabbath would begin, and the taking down, &c.  would be unlawful . The three Evangelists do not imply that this παρασκ . had any thing  especial in it, as John does John 19:31 . It is very remarkable, that  ἐπεί occurs only here in this Gospel, but is found in the corresponding clause of John 19:31 , shewing perhaps in this place a  community of source in two accounts otherwise so essentially distinct.
