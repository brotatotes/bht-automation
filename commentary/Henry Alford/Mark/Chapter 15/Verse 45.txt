<p><strong> 45. </strong> <strong> ἐδωρήσατο</strong> ] The passage cited (Meyer, De Wette) from Cicero (in Verrem, Mar 15:45 ) to shew that it was customary to give money on such occasions, is not to the point; ‘mortis celeritatem pretio redimere cogebantur parentes’ is not said of the body <em> after death</em> , but of a fee given to the officer, ‘ne diu crucietur.’</p>
