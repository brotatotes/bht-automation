That the same person is<i> so</i> called here, and<b> Mary of James</b> in the next verse, points to a<i> difference of origin</i> in the two accounts here, of the<i> Crucifixion</i> and<i> Resurrection</i>.<br><br> The mother of the Lord had in all probability previously departed: see notes on Matt. xxvii. 56 and John xix. 27.<br><br> St. Luke generalizes, and says,<i> the women who came with Him from Galilee</i>.<br><br> Some have understood by<b> Mary of Joses</b> or<b> Jose</b> or<b> Joseph</b> (for all are read here in the MSS.), the<i> wife</i> or<i> daughter</i> of Joseph of Arimathea—some, the<i> mother of the Lord</i>: but both unnecessarily, and without proof.
