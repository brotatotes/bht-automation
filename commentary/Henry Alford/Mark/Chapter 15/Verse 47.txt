 47. ]  Μ  .   ἡ Ἰωσῆτος understand,  mother: see Mark 15:40 . That she is so called here, and  Μαρία ἡ τοῦ Ἰακώβου in the next verse, points to a  difference of origin in the two accounts here, of the  Crucifixion and  Resurrection .
	The mother of the Lord had in all probability previously departed: see notes on Mat 27:56 and John 19:27 .
	Luke generalizes, and says,  the women who came with Him from Galilee .
	Some have understood by  Μ  .   Ἰωσῆτος or  Ἰωσῆ or  Ἰωσήφ , the  wife or  daughter of Joseph of Arimathæa some, the  mother of the Lord: but both unnecessarily, and without proof. The perf. τεθεῖται is to shew that they came up after the burial had taken place; the pres. ( τίθεται , re [61] .) would imply that they were present at the entombment. So Meyer.
