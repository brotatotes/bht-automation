 1 5. ] JESUS IS LED AWAY TO PILATE, AND EXAMINED BY HIM. Matthew 27:1-2 ; Matthew 27:11-14 .Luke 23:1-5; Luke 23:1-5 .John 18:28-38; John 18:28-38 . Our account is very nearly related to that in Matt.: see notes there. The  ὅλον τὸ σ  . is a touch of accuracy. From ch. Mar 14:53 we know that πάντες were assembled. Lightfoot quotes from Maimonides Sanhedr. 3 b., “Synedrium septuaginta unius seniorum non necesse habet ut sedeant omnes … cum vero necesse est ut congregentur omnes, congregentur omnes.”
