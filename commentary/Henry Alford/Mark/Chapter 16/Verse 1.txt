<b> 1. when the sabbath was past]</b> It was strictly<i> when the Sabbath was ended</i>, i.e. at sunset, that they bought the spices. St. Luke xxiii. 55, places it on the evening<i> before</i> the Sabbath; a slight but valuable discrepancy, as shewing the independence of the accounts. To suppose<i> two parties</i> of women (Greswell) or to take<b> bought</b> as<i> pluperfect</i> (as the A.V.) is equally arbitrary and unwarranted.
