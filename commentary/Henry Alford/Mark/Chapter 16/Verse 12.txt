 12. ]  μετὰ ταῦτα is  not found in Mark , though many opportunities occurred for using it. This verse epitomizes the events on the journey to Emmaus, Luke 24:13-35 .
	 περιπατοῦσιν ἐφανερώθη , though in  general accord with Luke’s narrative, is not accurate in detail. It was not  as they walked , but  as they sat at meat that He was manifested to them.
	 ἐν ἑτέρᾳ μορφῇ a slight difference from Luke 24:15-16 , which relates as the reason why they did not know Him, that  their eyes were holden , his being  in his usual form being declared by αὐτὸς ὁ Ἰησοῦς : but see notes there.
