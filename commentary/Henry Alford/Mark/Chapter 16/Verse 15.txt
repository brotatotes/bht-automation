It only once occurs in Matthew, viz. xxvi. 13.<br><br><b> the whole creation]</b> Not to<i> men</i> only, although men only can hear the<i> preaching</i> of the Gospel;<i> all creation</i> is redeemed by Christ—see Col. i. 15, 23; Rom. viii. 19–23. “Men, primarily, ver. 16: the rest of the creatures secondarily. As wide as the curse extends, reaches the blessing. The creation by the Son, is the foundation of redemption and of the kingdom.” Bengel.<br><br> This word<b> creation</b>, or creature, appears never in the N.T. to be used of<i> mankind alone</i>.
