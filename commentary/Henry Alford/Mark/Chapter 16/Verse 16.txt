Unbelief—by which is meant the rejection of the Gospel in heart and life, not weakness or doubt as in ver. 14—shall condemn a man, whether<i> baptized</i> or<i> unbaptized</i>. And, conversely, it follows that our Lord does not set forth here the<i> absolute</i>, but only the<i> general</i> necessity of Baptism to salvation; as the Church of England also teaches. But that general necessity extends to all to whom Baptism is<i> accessible</i>; and it was well said “<i>not the privation, but the contempt of Baptism, condemns.</i>”<br><br> These words cannot be taken, as those in Matt. xxviii, 19, 20, as setting forth the order in which faith and baptism must always come;<i> belief</i> and<i> disbelief</i> are in this verse the great leading subjects, and<b> believeth</b> must on that account stand first. On<b> he that believeth... shall be saved</b>, compare Acts xvi. 31. This is a solemn declaration of the doctrine of ‘salvation by faith,’ from the Lord Himself; but such a faith as is expanded, Matt. xxviii. 20, into teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; which is its<i> proper fruits</i>.<br><br><b> shall be damned</b>, i.e. in the most solemn sense: for the<i> sin of unbelief:</i>—for those are now spoken of who<i> hear</i> the Gospel preached, and<i> reject</i> it.
