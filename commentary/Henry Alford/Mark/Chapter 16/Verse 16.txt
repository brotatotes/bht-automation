 16. ] These past participles must be noticed, as carrying on the thought to a time  beyond the work of the preacher: when  σωθ  . and  κατακρ  . shall take place; and reserving the division of mankind into these two classes, till that day.
	On  βαπτ  . see note on Matthew 28:19 .
	There is no καὶ μὴ βαπτ . in the second clause here. Unbelief by which is meant the rejection of the gospel in heart and life, not weakness or doubt as in Mar 16:14 shall condemn a man, whether  baptized or unbaptized . And, conversely, it follows that our Lord does not set forth here the  absolute , but only the  general necessity of Baptism to salvation; as the Church of England also teaches. But that general necessity extends to all to whom Baptism is  accessible; and it was well said ‘Non privatio Baptismi, sed contemtus, damnat.’
	These words cannot be taken, as those in Matthew 28:19-20 , as setting forth the  order in which faith and baptism must always come;  belief and  disbelief are in this verse the great leading subjects, and  πιστεύσας must on that account stand first.
	On  ὁ πιστ  .   σωθ  . compare Acts 16:31 . This is a solemn declaration of the doctrine of ‘salvation by faith,’ from the Lord Himself; but such a faith as is expanded, Matthew 28:20 , into διδάσκοντες αὐτοὺς  τηρεῖν πάντα ὅσα ἐνετειλάμην ὑμῖν : which is its  proper fruits .
	 κατακρ  ., ‘will be  condemned; ’ i.e. in the most solemn sense: for the  sin of unbelief: for those are now spoken of who  hear the gospel preached, and  reject it.
