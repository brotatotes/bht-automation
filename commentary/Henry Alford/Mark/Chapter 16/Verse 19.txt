<b> 19.]</b> The connecting particle, rendered<b> so then</b>,—<b>the Lord,</b>—and t<b> he Lord Jesus</b>, which some MSS. read here, are alike<i> foreign to the diction of Mark</i>, speaking of the Lord: we have<i> the Lord</i> in the message (common to all three Gospels) ch. xi. 3—but that manifestly is no example.<br><br><b> after the Lord had spoken</b> can only in fairness mean, ‘<i>when He had spoken these words.</i>’ All endeavours of the Harmonists to include in them “<i>not only these words, but all that He spake</i>” (Euthymius) will have no weight with an honest reader, who looks to the<i> evident sense of his author alone</i>, and disregards other considerations. That other words were spoken, we know; but that<i> this author intended us to infer that</i>, surely is not deducible from the text, and is too often allowed in such cases to creep fallaciously in as an inference. We never shall read or comment on Scripture with full profit, till all such subterfuges are abandoned, and the Gospel evidence treated in the clear light of intelligent and honest faith. We have an example of this last in Theophylact’s exposition, “<i>when He had thus spoken.</i>”<br><br><b> was received up]</b> I should hardly say that the author of this fragment necessarily implies an ascension’<i> from the place</i> where they were then assembled. The whole of these two verses is of a compendious character, and<b> as sat on the right hand of God</b> must be understood as setting forth a fact not comprehended in the cycle of the writer’s observation, but certain in the belief of all Christians, so this may very well speak of the<i> fact</i> as happening, not necessarily then and there, but (see remarks above)<i> after these words were spoken;</i> provided always that these words are recognized as<i> the last</i> in the view and information of our Evangelist. I say this not with any harmonistic view, but because the words themselves seem to require it. (See on the Ascension, notes on Luke xxiv. 51 ff)
