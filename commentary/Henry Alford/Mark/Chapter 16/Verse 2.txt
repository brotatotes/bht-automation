<b> 2. when the sun was risen]</b> This does not agree with Matthew, “<i>as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week</i>”—Luke, “<i>at early (or deep) dawn;</i>” or John, “w<i> hen it was yet dark:</i>”—nor indeed with “<i>very early in the morning</i>” of our narrative itself. If the sun was up, it would be between 6 and 7 o’ clock; which in the East especially, where even public business was transacted<i> very early</i>, could not be so called. Even Greswell virtually acknowledges a difficulty here.
