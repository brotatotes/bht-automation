<b> 20.] went forth</b>—not, from the chamber where they were assembled—which would not answer to<b> preached every where</b>, but would require some immediate action of that very to correspond to it (see Matt. xii. 14);—but used in the more solemn sense of Rom. x. 18 (cited from Ps. xviii. 4 LXX). “<i>their sound is gone forth into all lands:</i>” see reff.<br><br><b> every where]</b> No inference can be drawn from this word as to the date of the fragment. In Acts ix. 82 Peter is said to have “<i>passed throughout</i> all (quarters)...:”—the expression being only<i> a general one</i>, indicating their performance, in their time and d», of our Lord’s words, into all the world<br><br><b> the Lord</b>, i.e. Jesus: see Matt. xxviii. 20: Heb. ii. 3, 4, which last passage some have absurdly supposed, to have been seen and used by our Evangelist. The two words rendered following (here and in ver. 17) are compound verbs, and<i> both foreign to the diction of St. Mark</i>, often as he uses the simple verb.<br><br> A few concluding remarks may be added respecting vv. 9–20. (1) For the external evidence, see as above. As to its<i> genuineness as a work of the Evangelist Mark</i>, (2) internal evidence is, I think,<i> very weighty against St. Mark’s being the author</i>. No less than<i> twenty-one words and expressions occur in it</i> (and some of them several times), which are<i> never elsewhere used</i> by St. Mark,—whose adherence, to his own peculiar phrases is remarkable. (3) The inference therefore seems to me to be, that i<i> t is an authentic fragment, placed as a completion of the Gospel in very early times</i>: by whom written, must course remain wholly uncertain; but coming to us with very weighty sanction, and having strong claims on our reception and reverence.
