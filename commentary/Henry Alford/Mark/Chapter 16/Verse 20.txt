 20. ]  ἐξελθόντες not, from the chamber where they were assembled (Meyer) which would not answer to ἐκήρυξαν πανταχοῦ , but would require some immediate action of that very day to correspond to it (see Mat 12:14 ); but used in the more solemn sense of Romans 10:18 (cited from Psa 18:4 LXX), εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἐξῆλθεν ὁ φθόγγος αὐτῶν : see reff.
	 πανταχοῦ ] No inference can be drawn from this word as to the date of the fragment. In Act 9:32 Peter is said διερχόμενον διὰ πάντων κατελθεῖν …: the expression being only  a general one , indicating their performance, in their time and degree, of our Lord’s words,  εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἅπαντα  .

	 ἐπακολ  . and  παρακολ  . ( Mar 16:17 ) are  both foreign to the diction of Mark often as he uses the simple verb.
	A few concluding remarks may be added respecting Mark 16:9-20 . (1) For the external evidence, see var. readd. As to its  genuineness as a work of the Evangelist Mark , (2) internal evidence is, I think, very weighty  against Mark’s being the author . No less than  twenty-one words and expressions occur in it (and some of them several times), which are  never elsewhere used by Mark, whose adherence to his own peculiar phrases is remarkable. (3) The inference therefore seems to me to be, that  it is an authentic fragment, placed as a completion of the Gospel in very early times: by whom written, must of course remain wholly uncertain; but coming to us with very weighty sanction, and having strong claims on our reception and reverence.]
