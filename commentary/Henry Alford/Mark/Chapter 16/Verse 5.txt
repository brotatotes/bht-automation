 5. ] In Matt., an  angel , sitting on the stone which he had rolled away. Here he is described  as he appeared , and we are left to infer  what he was. In Luke,  two angels ἐπέστησαν αὐταῖς in the tomb. The incident to which these accounts point, must be distinct from that related John 20:11 , which was  after Mary Magdalene returned from the city . It is not worth while to detail the attempts which have been made to reconcile these various reports of the incident: they present curious examples of the ingenuity, and (probably unconscious) disingenuousness, of the Harmonists. I may mention that Greswell supposes the angels in Matt. and Mark to be distinct, and accounts for the  ἐξεθαμβήθησαν in our text thus: ‘After seeing one angel  without already, they were probably less prepared than before to see another so soon after  within ’ (Dissert, vol. iii. p. 187).
