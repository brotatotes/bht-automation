<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] In Matt., an <em> angel</em> , sitting on the stone which he had rolled away. Here he is described <em> as he appeared</em> , and we are left to infer <em> what</em> he was. In Luke, <em> two angels</em> ἐπέστησαν αὐταῖς in the tomb. The incident to which these accounts point, must be distinct from that related <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:11">John 20:11</span> , which was <em> after Mary Magdalene returned from the city</em> . It is not worth while to detail the attempts which have been made to reconcile these various reports of the incident: they present curious examples of the ingenuity, and (probably unconscious) disingenuousness, of the Harmonists. I may mention that Greswell supposes the angels in Matt. and Mark to be distinct, and accounts for the <strong> ἐξεθαμβήθησαν</strong> in our text thus: ‘After seeing one angel <em> without</em> already, they were probably less prepared than before to see another so soon after <em> within</em> ’ (Dissert, vol. iii. p. 187).</p>
