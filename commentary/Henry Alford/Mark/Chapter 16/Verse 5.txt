<b> 5.] In Matthew</b>—an angel, sitting on the stone which he had rolled away. Here he is described<i> as he appeared</i>, and we are left to infer<i> what</i> he was. In Luke,—<i>two angels</i> appeared to them in the tomb. The incident to which these accounts point, must be distinct from that related John xx. 11, which was<i> after Mary Magdalene returned from the city</i>. It is not worth while to detail the attempts which have been made to reconcile these various reports of the incident: they present curious examples of the ingenuity, and (probably unconscious) disingenuousness, of the Harmonists. I may mention that Greswell supposes the angels in Matthew and Mark to be distinct, and accounts for<b> were affrighted</b> in our text thus: ‘After seeing one angel<i> without</i> already, they were probably less prepared than before to see another so soon after<i> within</i>.’
