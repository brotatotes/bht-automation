<b> 8.]</b> The idea of our narrative here is, that the women<i> fled</i> in terror from the sepulchre, and<i> did not deliver the message at the time</i>,â€”for they were afraid. All attempts to reconcile this with the other Gospels are futile. It is a manifest evidence that our narrative is here suddenly broken off, and (perhaps?) that no more information about the women was in the possession of its author. The subsequent verses are quite disconnected from this; and contain the substance of their writer's information respecting the other appearances of the Lord.
