<p><strong> 3, 4.</strong> ] It had been rolled away by an angel, Matt.

<p><strong> ἦν γὰρ μέγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σφ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is stated as a reason why <em> they could see that it was rolled away on looking up</em> , possibly at some distance. This explanation is according to Mark’s manner of describing minute circumstantial incidents; but to refer this clause back as the <em> reason why</em> they questioned who should remove the stone, is not only harsh, but inconsistent with the usage of this Gospel.</p>
