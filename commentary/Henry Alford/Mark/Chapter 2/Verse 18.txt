<p><strong> 18.</strong> <strong> καὶ ἦσαν</strong> κ . τ . λ .] Mark here gives a notice for the information of his readers, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:3">Mark 7:3</span> , which places shew that his Gospel was not written for the use of Jews. It appears from this account, which is here the more circumstantial, that the Pharisees and disciples of John asked the question in <em> the third person</em> , as <em> of others</em> . In Matt. it is <em> the disciples of John</em> , and they join ἡμεῖς καὶ οἱ Φαρ . In Luke, it is the <em> Pharisees and Scribes</em> , and they ask as here. Me [7] . understands it, that the disciples of John and the Pharisees were <em> at that particular time keeping a fast</em> , and that this gave occasion to the question. The verb subst. with the part. <em> may</em> mean this, and Mark himself apparently uses it so, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:32">Mark 10:32</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:4">Mark 14:4</span> : but much more frequently it describes a practice or state, e.g. ἦν γὰρ ἔχων κτήματα πολλά , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:22">Matthew 19:22</span> , οἱ ἀστ . ἔσονται ἐκ τ . οὐρ . πίπτοντες , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:25">Mark 13:25</span> . See also ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:6">Mark 1:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:22">Mark 1:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:39">Mark 1:39</span> . I cannot think that the fact of their being <em> at that time keeping a fast</em> would be thus expressed: it certainly would be <em> further specified</em> .
