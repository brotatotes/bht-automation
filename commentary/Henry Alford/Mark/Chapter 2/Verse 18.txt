 18.  καὶ ἦσαν κ . τ . λ .] Mark here gives a notice for the information of his readers, as in ch. Mark 7:3 , which places shew that his Gospel was not written for the use of Jews. It appears from this account, which is here the more circumstantial, that the Pharisees and disciples of John asked the question in  the third person , as  of others . In Matt. it is  the disciples of John , and they join ἡμεῖς καὶ οἱ Φαρ . In Luke, it is the  Pharisees and Scribes , and they ask as here. Me [7] . understands it, that the disciples of John and the Pharisees were  at that particular time keeping a fast , and that this gave occasion to the question. The verb subst. with the part.  may mean this, and Mark himself apparently uses it so, ch. Mark 10:32 , and Mark 14:4 : but much more frequently it describes a practice or state, e.g. ἦν γὰρ ἔχων κτήματα πολλά , Matthew 19:22 , οἱ ἀστ . ἔσονται ἐκ τ . οὐρ . πίπτοντες , ch. Mark 13:25 . See also ch. Mark 1:6 ; Mark 1:22 ; Mark 1:39 . I cannot think that the fact of their being  at that time keeping a fast would be thus expressed: it certainly would be  further specified .
