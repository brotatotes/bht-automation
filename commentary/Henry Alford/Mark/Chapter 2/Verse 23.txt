<p><strong> ὁδὸν ποιεῖν τίλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is matter of detail and minute depiction. The interpretation of this narrative given by Meyer, which I still believe to be an entirely mistaken one, I cannot pass over so slightly as I did in my first edition. He urges the strict classical sense of ὁδὸν ποιεῖν , ‘ <em> to make a way,’ viam munire</em> , or <em> sternere</em> , and insists on the sense conveyed by our narrative being, as distinguished from those in [9] Matt., Luke, that the disciples <em> made a way for themselves through the wheat field by plucking the ears of corn</em> , further maintaining, that there is no allusion <em> here</em> to their having eaten the grains of wheat, as in [10] Matt. Luke. But (1) the foundation on which all this is built is insecure. For ὁδὸν ποιεῖν in the LXX does undoubtedly mean ‘ <em> to make one’s journey</em> ,’ representing the Heb. עָשָׂה דֶּרֶךְ , in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jdg+17:8">Judges 17:8</span> (examples are also quoted in the lexx. from Xenophon (the romancer)’s Ephesiaca and from Polyænus). And (2) as to no allusion being made to their having eaten the corn, how otherwise could the χρείαν ἔχειν have been common to the disciples and to David? Could it be said that any <em> necessity</em> compelled them to clear the path by pulling up the overhanging stalks of corn? How otherwise could the remarkable addition in our narrative, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:27">Mark 2:27</span> , at all bear upon the case? Fritzsche’s rendering, ‘cœperunt viam exprimere spicas evellendo,’ which he explains, ‘to mark the way by plucking ears, and strewing them in it,’ is still worse. The classical sense of ὁδὸν ποιεῖν must evidently not be pressed: it here ὁδὸν ποιεῖσθαι .
