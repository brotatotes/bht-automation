<b> 26.]</b><b> In the days of Abiathar the high priest</b>: i.e. necessarily in the original,<b> during the high priesthood of Abiathar.</b> But in 1 Sam. xxi., from which this ac-count is taken, Ahimelech, not Abiathar, is the High Priest. There is however considerable confusion in the names about this part of the history:<i> Ahimelech himself is called Ahiah</i>, 1 Sam. xiv. 3; and whereas (1 Sam. xxii. 20) Ahimelech<i> has a son Abiathar</i>, in 2 Sam. viii. 17, Ahimelech<i> is the son of Abiathar</i>, and in 1 Chron. xviii. 16,<i> Abimelech</i>. Amidst this varia-tion, we can hardly undertake to explain the difficulty in the text. In some MSS. the words are omitted; in others they are altered, to give the words strictly the sense ‘In the time of Abiathar the High Priest,’ so that the difficulty might be avoided by understanding the event to have happened in the time of (but not necessarily during the high priesthood of) Abiathar (who was afterwards) the High Priest. But supposing the reading to be so, what author would in an ordinary narrative think of designating an event thus? Who for instance would speak of the defeat of the Philistines at Ephesdammim, where Goliath fell, as happening<i> in the time of David the king</i>? Who would ever understand, ‘<i>in the time of Elisaus the prophet</i>, as importing, in matter of fact, any other period than that of the<i> prophetic course</i> of Elisha? Yet this is the way in which the difficulties of the Gospels have been attempted to be healed over. With the restoration of the true reading (see my Greek Test.), even this resource fails.
