 27. ]  τὸ σάβ  …   διὰ τὸ ς  . is peculiar to Mark, and highly important. The Sabbath was an ordinance  for man ; for man’s rest, both actually and typically, as setting forth the rest which remains for God’s people ( Heb 4:9 ). But He who is now speaking has taken on Himself  Manhood , the whole nature of Man; and is  rightful lord over creation as  granted to man , and  of all that is made for man , and therefore  of the Sabbath . The whole dispensation of  time is created for  man , for  Christ as He is man , and is  in his absolute power . There is a remarkable parallel, in more than the mere mode of expression, in 2 Mace. Mark 5:19 : οὐ διὰ τὸν τόπον τὸ ἔθνος , ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸ ἔθνος τὸν τόπον ὁ κύριος ἐξελέξατο .
