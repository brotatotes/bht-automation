The interpretation of this narrative given by Meyer, I believe to be an entirely mistaken one. He the strict sense of ‘<i>to make a way</i>,’ and insists on the Lae sade by our narrative being, as distinguished from those in Matthew, Luke, that the disciples<i> made a way for them-selves through the wheat field, by plucking the ears of corn</i>, further maintaining, that there is no allusion<i> here</i> to their having eaten the grains of wheat, as in Matthew, Luke. But (1) the foundation on which all this is built is insecure. The same Greek expression in the LXX does undoubtedly mean ‘<i>to make one’s journey</i>.’ And (2) as to no allusion being made to their having eaten the corn, how otherwise could the ‘<i>had need</i>’ have been common to the disciples and to David. Could it be said that any<i> necessity</i> compelled them to clear the path by pulling up the overhanging stalks of corn? How otherwise could the remarkable addition in our narrative, ver. 27, at all bear upon the case? Fritzache’s rendering, ‘to mark the way by plucking ears and strewing them in it,’ is still worse.<br><br><b> 28.]</b><b> also</b>, as well as of His other domains elements of lordship and power.
