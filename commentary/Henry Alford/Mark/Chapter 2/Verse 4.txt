<b></b>It would appear that Jesus was speaking to the crowd from the upper story of the house, they being assembled in the court, or perhaps (but less probably) in the street. Those who bore the paralytic ascended the stairs which led direct from the street to the flat roof of the house, and let him down through the tiles (Luke). See the extract from Dr. Robinson, describing the Jewish house, in note on Matt. xxvi. 69.
