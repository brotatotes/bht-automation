 13 22. ] THE CALLING OF LEVI. FEAST AT HIS HOUSE: QUESTION CONCERNING FASTING. Matthew 9:9-17 . Luke 5:27-39 . I have discussed the question of the identity of Matthew and Levi in the notes on Matt.
	The three accounts are in matter nearly identical, and in diction so minutely and unaccountably varied, as to declare here, as elsewhere, their independence of one another, except in having had some common source from which they have more or less deflected. (These remarks do not apply to the diversity of the names Matthew and Levi, which must be accounted for on other grounds. See, as throughout the passage, the notes on Matt.)
