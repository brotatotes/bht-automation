 11.   ὅταν  …   ἐθεώρουν ] See ref. The indic. is sometimes found with ὅταν in the N.T., see Revelation 4:9 , but generally amidst variety of readings: Matthew 10:19 ; Mark 11:25 ; Luke 13:28 ; Romans 2:14 . Meyer thus accounts for it that in later Greek the ἅν became completely attached to the ὅτε , and the  whenever was treated as merely an expression of time so that in German it would not be  menn sie Jhn irgend sahen , but  menn irgend sie Jhn sahen .
	The unclean spirits are here spoken of in the person of those possessed by them, and the two fused together: for as it was impossible that  any but the spirits could have  known that He was the Son of God, so it was the material body of the possessed which fell down before Him, and  their voice which uttered the cry: see note on Matthew 8:32 . The notion of the semi-rationalists, that the sick  identified themselves with the dæmons (Meyer), is at once refuted by the universal agreement of the testimony given on such occasions,  that Jesus was the Son of God .
