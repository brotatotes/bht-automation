 21. ] Peculiar to Mark.
	 οἱ παρ  ʼ   αὐτοῦ  = his relations, beyond a doubt for the sense is resumed in Mark 3:31 : see reff.
	 ἐξῆλθ  . (perhaps  from Nazareth , or, answering to John 2:12 ,  from Capernaum ),  set out: see ch. Mark 5:14 . They heard of his being so beset by crowds: see Mark 3:7-11 .
	 ἔλεγον ] i.e. His relations not τινἐς .
	 ἐξέστη ]  He is mad: thus E. V.; and the sense requires it. They had doubtless heard of the accusation of his  having a dæmon : which we must suppose not to have first begun after this, but to have been going on throughout this course of miracles.
	The understanding this that  his disciples went out to repress  the crowd , for they said, ‘  It is mad ,’ is as contrary to Greek as to sense. It would require at least αὐτούς and ἐξέστησαν , or τὸν ὄχλον for αὐτόν , and would even then give no intelligible meaning.
