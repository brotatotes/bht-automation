<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] Peculiar to Mark.

<p><strong> οἱ παρ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> <strong> = his relations,</strong> beyond a doubt for the sense is resumed in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:31">Mark 3:31</span> : see reff.

<p><strong> ἐξῆλθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> (perhaps <em> from Nazareth</em> , or, answering to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:12">John 2:12</span> , <em> from Capernaum</em> ), <strong> set out:</strong> see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:14">Mark 5:14</span> . They heard of his being so beset by crowds: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:7-11">Mark 3:7-11</span> .

<p><strong> ἔλεγον</strong> ] i.e. His relations not τινἐς .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐξέστη</strong> ] <strong> He is mad:</strong> thus E. V.; and the sense requires it. They had doubtless heard of the accusation of his <em> having a dæmon</em> : which we must suppose not to have first begun after this, but to have been going on throughout this course of miracles.

<p>The understanding this that <em> his disciples</em> went out to repress <em> the crowd</em> , for they said, ‘ <em> It is mad</em> ,’ is as contrary to Greek as to sense. It would require at least αὐτούς and ἐξέστησαν , or τὸν ὄχλον for αὐτόν , and would even then give no intelligible meaning.</p>
