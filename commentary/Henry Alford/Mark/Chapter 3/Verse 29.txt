<b> 29. guilty of eternal sin]</b> Beza explains<i> eternal</i> by ‘<i>never to be wiped out</i>.’ It is to the critical treatment of the sacred text that we owe the restoration of such important and deep-reaching expressions as this. It finds its parallel in<i> ye shall die</i><b> in your sins</b>, John viii. 24. Kuinoel’s idea, quoted and adopted by Wordsw., that<b> sin</b> means<i> the punishment of sin</i>, seems to be entirely unfounded. And as to its being “a Novatian error to assert that sin is eternal” (Wordsw.), it is at all events a legitimate inference from “<i>hath never forgiveness</i>” (literally,<i> remission</i>). If a sin remains unremitted for ever, what is it but eternal?
