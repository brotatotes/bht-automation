 29.   αἰωνίου ἁμαρτήματος ] Beza explains αἰωνίου by ‘  nunquam delendi .’ It is to the critical treatment of the sacred text that we owe the restoration of such important and deep-reaching expressions as this. It finds its parallel in ἀποθανεῖσθε ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν , John 8:24 .
	Kuinoel’s idea, quoted and adopted by Wordsw., that ἁμάρτημα means in the LXX  the punishment of sin , seems to be entirely unfounded. And as to its being “a Novatian error to assert that sin is αἰώνιον ” (Wordsw.), it is at all events a legitimate inference from οὐκ ἔχει ἄφεσιν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα . If a sin remains unremitted for ever, what is it but eternal?
	Mar 3:30 explains the ground and meaning of this awful denunciation of the Lord.
