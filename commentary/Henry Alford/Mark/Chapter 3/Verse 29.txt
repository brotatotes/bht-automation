<p><strong> 29. </strong> <strong> αἰωνίου ἁμαρτήματος</strong> ] Beza explains αἰωνίου by ‘ <em> nunquam delendi</em> .’ It is to the critical treatment of the sacred text that we owe the restoration of such important and deep-reaching expressions as this. It finds its parallel in ἀποθανεῖσθε ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:24">John 8:24</span> .

<p>Kuinoel’s idea, quoted and adopted by Wordsw., that ἁμάρτημα means in the LXX <em> the punishment of sin</em> , seems to be entirely unfounded. And as to its being “a Novatian error to assert that sin is αἰώνιον ” (Wordsw.), it is at all events a legitimate inference from οὐκ ἔχει ἄφεσιν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα . If a sin remains unremitted for ever, what is it but eternal?
