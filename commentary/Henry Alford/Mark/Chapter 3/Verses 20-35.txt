<p><strong> 20 35.</strong> ] CHARGES AGAINST JESUS, OF MADNESS BY HIS RELATIONS, OF DÆMONIACAL POSSESSION BY THE SCRIBES. HIS REPLIES. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:22-37">Matthew 12:22-37</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:46-50">Matthew 12:46-50</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:14-26">Luke 11:14-26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:19-21">Luke 8:19-21</span> . Our Lord <em> had just cast out a deaf and dumb spirit</em> (see notes on Matt.) in the open air ( Mat 10:23 ), and now they retire into the house. The omission of this, wholly inexplicable if Mark had had either Matt. or Luke before him, belongs to the fragmentary character of his Gospel. The common accounts of the compilation of this Gospel are most capricious and absurd. In one place, Mark omits a discourse ‘ <em> because it was not his purpose to relate discourses</em> ;’ in another he gives a discourse, omitting the occasion which led to it, as here. The <em> real fact being</em> , that the sources of Mark’s Gospel are generally of <em> the highest order</em> , and <em> most direct</em> , but the <em> amount of things contained</em> very scanty and discontinuous: see Prolegg. ch. iii. § viii.</p>
