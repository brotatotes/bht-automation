 7 12. ] A GENERAL SUMMARY OF OUR LORD’S HEALING AND CASTING OUT DEVILS BY THE SEA OF GALILEE.  Peculiar in this shape  to Mark ; but probably answering to Matthew 12:15-21 .Luke 6:17-19; Luke 6:17-19 . The description of the multitudes, and places whence they came, sets before us, more graphically than any where else in the Gospels, the composition of the audiences to which the Lord spoke, and whom He healed. The repetition of  πλῆθος πολύ ( Mar 3:8 ) is the report of one who  saw the numbers from Tyre and Sidon coming and going.
