<p><strong> 7 12.</strong> ] A GENERAL SUMMARY OF OUR LORD’S HEALING AND CASTING OUT DEVILS BY THE SEA OF GALILEE. <em> Peculiar</em> in this shape <em> to Mark</em> ; but probably answering to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:15-21">Matthew 12:15-21</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:17-19">Luke 6:17-19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:17-19">Luke 6:17-19</span> . The description of the multitudes, and places whence they came, sets before us, more graphically than any where else in the Gospels, the composition of the audiences to which the Lord spoke, and whom He healed. The repetition of <strong> πλῆθος πολύ</strong> ( Mar 3:8 ) is the report of one who <em> saw</em> the numbers from Tyre and Sidon coming and going.</p>
