	 ἄνθρωπος ] Some difficulty has been felt about the interpretation of this  man , as to whether it is  Christ or  his ministers . The former certainly seems to be excluded by the  καθεύδῃ  , and  ὡς οὐκ οἶδεν αὐτός  , Mark 4:27 ; and perhaps the latter by  ἀποστ  .   τὸ δρ  ., Mark 4:29 . But I believe the parable to be one taken simply from human things, the sower being quite in the background, and the whole stress being on the SEED its power and its development. The  man then is just the  farmer or husbandman, hardly admitting an  interpretation , but necessary to the machinery of the parable.

It looks like a combination of ὡς ἄνθρ . βαλών , and ὡς ἐὰν ἄνθρ . βάλῃ .
