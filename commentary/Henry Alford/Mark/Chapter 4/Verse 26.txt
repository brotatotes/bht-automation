<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] Observe <strong> ἔλεγεν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> without αὐτοῖς implying that He is now proceeding with his teaching to the <em> people</em> : cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:33">Mark 4:33</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἄνθρωπος</strong> ] Some difficulty has been felt about the interpretation of this <em> man</em> , as to whether it is <em> Christ</em> or <em> his ministers</em> . The former certainly seems to be excluded by the <strong> καθεύδῃ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and <strong> ὡς οὐκ οἶδεν αὐτός</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:27">Mark 4:27</span> ; and perhaps the latter by <strong> ἀποστ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὸ δρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:29">Mark 4:29</span> . But I believe the parable to be one taken simply from human things, the sower being quite in the background, and the whole stress being on the SEED its power and its development. The <em> man</em> then is just the <em> farmer</em> or husbandman, hardly admitting an <em> interpretation</em> , but necessary to the machinery of the parable.
	</p>
<p>Observe, that in this case it is not τὸν σπόρον <strong> αὐτοῦ</strong> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:5">Luke 8:5</span> , and the agent is only hinted at in the most general way, e.g. ἀποστ . τ . δρέπ ., without a nom. case expressed. If a meaning must be assigned, the best is “human agency” in general. (It will be seen from this note, that I regard the exposition given in my first edition as a mistaken one.)

<p><strong> βάλῃ</strong> <strong> , shall have cast</strong> past tense, whereas <strong> καθεύδῃ</strong> and <strong> ἐγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> are <em> present</em> . The construction seems to be, <strong> The Kingdom of God is thus, that a man shall have cast,</strong> i.e. <em> shall be as though he have cast</em> : but it is not easy, and, as far as I know, unexampled. It looks like a combination of ὡς ἄνθρ . βαλών , and ὡς ἐὰν ἄνθρ . βάλῃ .</p>
