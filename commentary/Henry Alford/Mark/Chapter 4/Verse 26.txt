<b> 26.]</b> Observe<b> said</b>, without<i> unto them</i>—implying that He is now proceeding with his teaching to the<i> people:</i> compare ver. 33.<br><br><b> a man]</b> Some difficulty has been felt about the interpretation of this<i> man</i>, as to whether it is<i> Christ</i> or<i> his ministers</i>. The former certainly seems to be excluded by<b> should sleep</b>, and<b> he knoweth not how</b>, ver. 27; and perhaps the latter by<b> putteth in the sickle</b>, ver. 29. But I believe the parable to be one taken simply from human things,—the sower being quite in the background, and the whole stress being on the SEED—its power and its development. The<i> man</i> then is just the farmer or husbandman, hardly admitting an<i> interpretation</i>, but necessary to the machinery of the parable.<br><br> Observe, that in this case it is not<i> his seed</i> as in Luke viii. 5,—and the agent is only hinted at in the most general way. If a meaning must be assigned, the best is “human agency” in general.
