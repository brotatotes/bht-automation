 1 9. ] PARABLE OF THE SOWER. No fixed mark of date. Matthew 13:1-9 . Luke 8:4-8 . There is the same intermixture of absolute verbal identity and considerable divergence, as we have so often noticed: which is wholly inexplicable on the ordinary suppositions. In this case the vehicles of the parable in Matt. and Mark (see Matthew 13:1-3 ; Mar 4:1-2 ) bear a strong, almost verbal, resemblance.  Such a parable would be carefully treasured in all the Churches as a subject of catechetical instruction: and, in general, in proportion to the popular nature of the discourse, is the resemblance stronger in the reports of it.
