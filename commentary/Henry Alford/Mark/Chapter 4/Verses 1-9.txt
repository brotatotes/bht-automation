<p><strong> 1 9.</strong> ] PARABLE OF THE SOWER. No fixed mark of date. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1-9">Matthew 13:1-9</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:4-8">Luke 8:4-8</span> . There is the same intermixture of absolute verbal identity and considerable divergence, as we have so often noticed: which is wholly inexplicable on the ordinary suppositions. In this case the vehicles of the parable in Matt. and Mark (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1-3">Matthew 13:1-3</span> ; Mar 4:1-2 ) bear a strong, almost verbal, resemblance. <em> Such a parable</em> would be carefully treasured in all the Churches as a subject of catechetical instruction: and, in general, in proportion to the popular nature of the discourse, is the resemblance stronger in the reports of it.</p>
