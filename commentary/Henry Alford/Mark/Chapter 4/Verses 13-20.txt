 13 20. ] EXPLANATION OF THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER. In  τὴν παρ  .   ταύτην  , the general question which had been asked Mark 4:10 (  τὰς παραβολάς ), is tacitly assumed to have had special reference to the one which has been given at length. Or we may understand, that the question of Mar 4:10 took the form which is given in [12] Matt.: διὰ τί ἐν παραβολαῖς λαλεῖς αὐτοῖς ; in which case the τάς must be generic:  asked Him concerning parables ; or  His parables. The three explanations (see Matthew 13:18-23 ; Luk 8:9-15 ) are very nearly related to one another, with however differences enough to make the common hypotheses quite untenable. Matt. and Mark agree nearly verbatim, Matt. however writing throughout in the singular ( ὁ σπαρεὶς κ . τ . λ .). Mark has some additions, e.g.  ὁ σπείρων τὸν λόγον σπ  ., Mark 4:14 , after ἡ ἀπ . τοῦ πλ ., Mark 4:19 ,  καὶ αἱ π  .   τὰ λ  .   ἐπιθ  . : and some variations, e.g.  σατανᾶς for Matt.’s ὁ πονηρός , and Luke’s ὁ διάβ .
	 [12] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
	Such matters are  not trifling , because they shew the  gradual deflection of verbal expression in different versions of the  same report , nor is the  general agreement of Luke’s, which seems to be from a different hearer.
