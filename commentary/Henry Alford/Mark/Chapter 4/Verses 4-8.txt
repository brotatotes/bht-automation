<p><strong> 4 8.</strong> ] Matt. and Mark agree nearly verbally. In Mar 4:7 Mark adds <strong> καὶ καρπὸν οὐκ ἔδωκεν</strong> <strong> ,</strong> and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:8">Mark 4:8</span> , <strong> ἀναβαίνοντα κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐξανόμενον</strong> <strong> .</strong> On this latter, Meyer remarks, that the two present partt. are predicates of καρπόν , which therefore must not be understood here of the fruit properly so called, the corns of wheat in the ears, but of the haulm, the first fruit of the successful seed. The corns first come in after ἔφερεν .</p>
