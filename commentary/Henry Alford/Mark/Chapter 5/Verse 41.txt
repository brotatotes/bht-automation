	The accuracy of Mark’s reports, not, as has been strangely suggested (see Webst. and Wilk. p. 174), the wish to indicate that our Lord did not use mystic magical language on such occasions, often gives occasion to the insertion of the  actual Syriac and Aramaic words spoken by the Lord: see ch. Mark 7:11 ; Mark 7:34 ; Mark 14:36 .  Talitha, in the ordinary dialect of the people, is a word of endearment addressed to a young maiden: = κοράσιον . So that the words are equivalent to  Rise, my child. On the nom. with the article standing as a vocative, see Winer, § 29. 2.

This however it lost, as the present use and that in Luke and Luk 12:32 sufficiently shew.
