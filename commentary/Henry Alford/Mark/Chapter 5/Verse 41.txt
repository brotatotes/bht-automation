<p>The accuracy of Mark’s reports, not, as has been strangely suggested (see Webst. and Wilk. p. 174), the wish to indicate that our Lord did not use mystic magical language on such occasions, often gives occasion to the insertion of the <em> actual Syriac and Aramaic words</em> spoken by the Lord: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:11">Mark 7:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:34">Mark 7:34</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:36">Mark 14:36</span> . <strong> Talitha,</strong> in the ordinary dialect of the people, is a word of endearment addressed to a young maiden: = κοράσιον . So that the words are equivalent to <strong> Rise, my child.</strong> On the nom. with the article standing as a vocative, see Winer, § 29. 2. Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 67, remarks that the idiom had originally something harsh in it, being used only in emphatically imperative addresses. This however it lost, as the present use and that in Luke and Luk 12:32 sufficiently shew.</p>
