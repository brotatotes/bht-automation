The accuracy of St. Mark’s reports,—not, as has been strangely suggested, the wish to indicate that our Lord did not use mystic magical language on such occasions,—often gives occasion to the insertion of the<i> actual Syriac and Aramaic words</i> spoken by the Lord: see ch. vii. 11, 34; xiv. 36.<b> Talitha</b>, in the ordinary dialect of the people, is a word of endearment addressed to a young maiden. So that the words are equivalent to<b> Rise, my child</b>. Peculiar to Mark.
