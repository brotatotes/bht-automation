Rather are all such tracings of discrepancies to their source, most interesting and valuable. Nor can I consent for a moment to accept here the very lame solution (repeated by Bp. Wordsw.), which supposes  one of the dæmoniacs not to be mentioned by Mark and Luke: in other words, that the  least circumstantial account is in possession of an additional particular which gives a new aspect to the  whole : for the  plural , used here and in Luke of the  many dæmons in one man , is there used of the  two men , and their separate dæmons.
