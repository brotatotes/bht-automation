<p><strong> 21 43.</strong> ] RAISING OF JAEIRUSâ€™S DAUGHTER, AND HEALING OF A WOMAN WITH AN ISSUE OF BLOOD. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:18-26">Matthew 9:18-26</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:41-56">Luke 8:41-56</span> . The same remarks apply to these three accounts as to the last. Matt. is even more concise than there, but more like an eye-witness in his narration (see notes on Matt. and Luke); Mark the fullest of the three.</p>
