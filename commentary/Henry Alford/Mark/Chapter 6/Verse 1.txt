 1. ]  ἐξῆλθ  .   ἐκεῖθ  ., not,  from the house of Jaeirus , by the expression τὴν πατρίδα αὐτ . in the corresponding clause. I may go out of my own house  into a neighbour’s , but I do not say, I go  out of my own house into Lincolnshire: the two members of such a sentence must  correspond : I go  out of Leicestershire into Lincolnshire so, as corresponding to τ . πατρίδ . αὐτ ., ἐκεῖθεν must mean  from that city , i.e. Capernaum. This against Meyer, who tries on this misinterpretation to ground a difference between Matt. and Mark.
