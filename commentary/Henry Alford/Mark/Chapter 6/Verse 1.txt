<b> 1.] went out from thence</b>, not,<i> from the house of Jairus</i>, by the expression his<b> own country</b> in the corresponding clause. I may go out of my own house<i> into a neighbour’s</i>, but I do not say, I go<i> out of my own house</i> into Lincolnshire: the two members of such a sentence must<i> correspond</i>:—I go<i> out of Leicestershire</i> into Lincolnshire—so, as corresponding to<b> his own country</b>,<b> from thence</b> must mean from<i> that city</i>, i.e. Capernaum. This against those who try on this misinterpretation to ground a difference between St. Matthew and St. Mark.
