<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] <strong> ἐξῆλθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐκεῖθ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not, <em> from the house of Jaeirus</em> , by the expression τὴν πατρίδα αὐτ . in the corresponding clause. I may go out of my own house <em> into a neighbour’s</em> , but I do not say, I go <em> out of my own house</em> into Lincolnshire: the two members of such a sentence must <em> correspond</em> : I go <em> out of Leicestershire</em> into Lincolnshire so, as corresponding to τ . πατρίδ . αὐτ ., ἐκεῖθεν must mean <em> from that city</em> , i.e. Capernaum. This against Meyer, who tries on this misinterpretation to ground a difference between Matt. and Mark.</p>
