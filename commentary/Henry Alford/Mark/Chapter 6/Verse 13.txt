 13.   ἤλειφον ἐλαίῳ ] This oil was not used  medicinally , but as  a vehicle of healing power committed to them ; a symbol of a deeper thing than the oil itself could accomplish. That such anointing has nothing in common with the extreme unction of Romanists, see proved in note on James 5:14 .
	See for instances of such symbolic use of external applications, 2 Kings 5:14 ; Mark 8:23 ; John 9:6 , &c.
