 3.   ὁ τέκτων ] This expression does not seem to be used at random, but to signify that the Lord had  actually worked at the trade of his reputed father. Justin Martyr, Dial. § 88, p. 186, says ταῦτα γὰρ τὰ τεκτονικὰ ἔργα εἰργάζετο ἐν ἀνθρώποις ὤν , ἄροτρα καὶ ζυγά . Cf. the conflicting but apparently careless assertion of Orig [19] in the var. readd. See also the anecdote told by Theodoret, H. E. iii. c. 18, p. 940.
