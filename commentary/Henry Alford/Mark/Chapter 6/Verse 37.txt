<b> 37.]</b> This verse is to me rather a decisive proof that (see above) Mark had<i> not seen</i> John’s account; for how could he, having done so, and with his love for accurate detail, have so generalized the particular account of Philip’s question? That generalization was<i> in the account which he used</i>. and the circumstance was more exactly related by John, as also the following one concerning Andrew. The dividing of the<i> fishes</i>, and (ver. 43) the taking up fragments from the<i> fishes</i>, are both peculiar and characteristic of Mark: but it would have been most inconsistent with his precision to have omitted “<i>besides women and children</i>” in ver. 44, had he had it before him.
