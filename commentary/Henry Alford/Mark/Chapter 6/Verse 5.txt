<p><strong> 5. </strong> <strong> οὐκ ἐδύνατο</strong> ] The <em> want of ability</em> spoken of is not <em> absolute</em> , but <em> relative</em> : οὐχ ὅτι αὐτὸς ἀσθενὴς ἦν , ἀλλ ʼ ὅτι ἐκεῖνοι ἄπιστοι ἦσαν . Thl. The same voice, which could still the tempests, could any where and under any circumstances have commanded diseases to obey; but in most cases of human infirmity, it was our Lord’s practice to require <em> faith</em> in the recipient of aid: and that being wanting, the help <em> could not</em> be given. However, from what follows, we find that <em> in a few instances</em> it <em> did</em> exist, and the help was given accordingly.</p>
