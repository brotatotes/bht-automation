 5.   οὐκ ἐδύνατο ] The  want of ability spoken of is not  absolute , but  relative : οὐχ ὅτι αὐτὸς ἀσθενὴς ἦν , ἀλλ ʼ ὅτι ἐκεῖνοι ἄπιστοι ἦσαν . Thl. The same voice, which could still the tempests, could any where and under any circumstances have commanded diseases to obey; but in most cases of human infirmity, it was our Lord’s practice to require  faith in the recipient of aid: and that being wanting, the help  could not be given. However, from what follows, we find that  in a few instances it  did exist, and the help was given accordingly.
