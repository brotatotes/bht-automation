<p><strong> 56.</strong> ] In <strong> ὅπου ἂν εἰσεπορεύετο</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> ὅσοι ἂν ἥπτοντο</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the ἅν belongs not so much to the verbs, which are certain and definite, as to the indefinites ὅπου and ὅσοι , rendering them more indefinite, and spreading the assertion over every several occasion of the occurrence. See remarks on this in Klotz, Devar. ii. p. 145 f.: and cf. reff. and Lucian, Dial. mort. ix. 2, μακάριος ἦν αὐτῶν ὅντινα ἂν καὶ μόνον προσέβλεψα .</p>
