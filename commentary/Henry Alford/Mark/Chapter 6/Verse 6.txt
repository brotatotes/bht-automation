 6.   ἐθαύμαζεν ] This need not surprise us, nor be construed otherwise than as a literal description of the Lord’s mind: in the mystery of his humanity, as He was compassed by human infirmity, grew in wisdom, learned obedience, knew not the day nor the hour (ch. Mar 13:32 ), so He might  wonder at the unbelief of His countrymen. Observe, owing to the  διὰ with an accus., that their unbelief is not here said to be the  object , but the  cause , of the Lord’s wonder.
	 καὶ περιῆγεν ] See Matthew 9:35 .
