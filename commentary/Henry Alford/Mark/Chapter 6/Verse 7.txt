 7.]   δύο δύο (see reff.) is a Hebraism: see Winer, § 37. 3. The Greek expression would be κατά , or ἀνὰ δύο , as in [20] Luke. Winer observes that the Syriac version always renders this latter expression by doubling the cardinal number. These  couples are pointed out in Matt.’s list of the Apostles  not however in Mark’s , which again shews the total absence of  connecting design in this Gospel, such as is often assumed.
	 [20] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
