This is one of the very few points of comparison between the  four Gospels during the ministry of our Lord. And here again I believe Mark’s report to be an original one, and of the  very highest authority. Professor Bleek (Beiträge zur Evangelienkritik, p. 200) believes that Mark has  used the Gospel of John , on account of the 200 denarii in our Mar 6:37 and John 6:7 ; and that he generally compiles his narrative from Matt. and Luke (ibid. p. 72 75), which has been elsewhere shewed to be utterly untenable. I believe Mark’s to be an  original full account ; Matt.’s a compendium of  this same account , but drawn up independently of Mark’s: Luke’s a compendium of  another account : John’s an  independent narrative of his own as an eye-witness .
