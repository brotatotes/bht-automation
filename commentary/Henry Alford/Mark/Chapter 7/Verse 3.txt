 3.   πυγμῇ ] This word has perplexed all the Commentators. Of the various renderings which have been given of it, two are excluded by their not being grammatical (1) that which makes it mean ‘  up to the elbow ’ (Euthym [26] and Thl.); ‘  including the hand as far as the wrist ’ Lightf.: (2) ‘  having clenched the hand,’ ‘facto pugno ’ (Grot. and others).
	 [26] Euthymius Zigabenus, 1116
	The two meanings between which our choice lies are, (3) ‘  frequently ’ (as E. V. ‘oft,’ and Vulg. ‘crebro’), taking πυγμῇ = πυκνῇ = πυκνῶς , which however is not very probable: or (4), to which I most incline, and which Kuinoel gives, ‘  sedulo,’ ‘fortiter ,’  diligently;   πυγμή  , he observes, meaning ‘the fist,’ answers in the LXX to the word אֶגְרֹף , see reff. But this same word אֶגְרֹף is used to signify  strength and  fortitude , and  strong men are called in the Rabbinical writings בעלי אגרופין , ‘lords of fists.’ And the Sy [27] . interpreter renders it by the same word as he does ἐπιμελῶς , Luke 15:8 .
