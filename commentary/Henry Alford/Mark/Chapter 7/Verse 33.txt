<p><strong> 33. </strong> <strong> ἀπολ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] No reason that we know can be assigned why our Lord should <em> take aside</em> this man, and the blind man, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:23">Mark 8:23</span> ; but how many might there be which we do not know, such as some peculiarity in the <em> man himself</em> , or the <em> persons around</em> , which influenced His determination.
	</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the <em> same medium</em> of conveying the miraculous cure is used also in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:23">Mark 8:23</span> . By the symbolic use of external means, our Lord signified the healing virtue for afflicted human kind, which resides in and proceeds from Him incarnate in our flesh. He uses either his own touch, something from Himself, or the cleansing element to which He so often compares his word.</p>
