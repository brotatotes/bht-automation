<p><strong> 4. </strong> <strong> ἀπ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἀγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] i.e. (as indeed some MSS. insert: see var. readd.) ὅταν ἔλθωσιν . Winer, § 66. 2 note, takes ἀπ ʼ ἀγορᾶς with ἐσθίωσιν , justifying it by Arrian, Epict. iii. 19. 5, φαγεῖν ἐκ βαλανείου .
	</p>
<p><strong> βαπτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is variously understood, of <em> themselves</em> , or the <em> meats bought</em> . It certainly refers to <em> themselves</em> ; as it would not be any unusual practice to wash things bought in the market: but probably not to washing their <em> whole bodies</em> : see below.
	</p>
<p><strong> ξεστ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> not from ξέω , to polish, but a corruption of <em> sextarius</em> . See the passage of Josephus cited in the reff.
	</p>
<p><strong> χαλκ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> <em> brazen vessels</em> ; earthen ones, when unclean, were to be <em> broken</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+15:12">Leviticus 15:12</span> .
	</p>
<p>These <strong> βαπτισμοί</strong> <strong> ,</strong> as applied to <strong> κλινῶν</strong> (meaning probably here <em> couches</em> (triclinia) <em> used at meals</em> ), were certainly <em> not immersions</em> , but sprinklings or affusions of water. On the whole subject, see Lightfoot ad loc.</p>
