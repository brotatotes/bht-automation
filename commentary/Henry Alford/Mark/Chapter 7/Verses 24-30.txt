 24 30. ] THE SYROPHŒNICIAN WOMAN. Matthew 15:21-28 . Omitted by Luke. A striking instance of the independence of the two narrations. Mark, who is much more copious in particulars,  omits a considerable and important part of the history: this would be most arbitrarily and indeed inexcusably done, if the common account of his having  combined and epitomized Matt. and Luke is to be taken.
	Our Lord’s retirement was  to avoid the Pharisees : see notes on Matt. throughout.
