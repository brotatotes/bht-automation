<b> 14.]</b> The subject to the verb<b> forgot</b> is<i> the disciples</i> unexpressed: see next verse. The<b> leaven of Herod</b> here seems to answer to the<i> leaven of the Sadducees</i> in Matthew. But we must not infer from this that Herod was a Sadducee. He certainly was a bad and irreligious man, which would be quite enough ground for such a caution. We have a specimen of the morals of his court in the history of John the Baptist’s martyrdom. In the<i> last</i><b> not yet</b>, ver. 21, Meyer sees a<i> new</i> climax, and refers the<i> not yet</i> to the moment even after the reminiscence of vv. 18–20. It doubtless be so, and the idea would well accord with the graphic precision of St. Mark.
