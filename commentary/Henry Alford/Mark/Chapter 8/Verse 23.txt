<b> 23.]</b> The leading of this blind man out of the town appears as if it had been from<i> some local reason</i>. In ver. 26 we find him forbidden expressly to enter into or tell it<i> in</i> the<i> town</i>, and with a repetition of<b> town</b>, which looks as if the place had been somehow unworthy of such a work being done there. (This is a serious objection against Meyer’s reason, that the<i> use of spittle</i> on both occasions occasioned the same privacy here and in ch. vii 33.) Or we may perhaps find the reason in our Lord’s<i> immediate</i><i> departure</i> to such a distance (ver. 27); and say, that He did not wish multitudes to gather about and follow Him.
