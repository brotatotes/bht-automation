 23. ] The leading of this blind man out of the town appears as if it had been from  some local reason . In Mar 8:26 we find him forbidden expressly to enter into or tell it  in the town , and with a repetition of  κώμη  , which looks as if the place had been somehow unworthy of such a work being done there. (This is a serious objection against Meyer’s reason, that the  use of spittle in both miracles occasioned the same privacy here and in ch. Mark 7:33 .) Or we may perhaps find the reason in our Lord’s  immediate departure to such a distance ( Mar 8:27 ); and say, that He did not wish multitudes to gather about and follow Him.
	 πτύσας  …   ἐπιθεὶς  … ] See above on ch.Mark 7:33 .
	We cannot say what may have induced our Lord to perform this miracle  at twice certainly not the reason assigned by Dr. Burton, “that a blind man would not, on suddenly recovering his sight, know one object from another, because he had never seen them before,” and so would require a double miracle; a second to open the eyes of  his mind also , to comprehend what he saw. This assumes the man to have been  born blind, which he was not, from Mark 8:24 ; for how should he know  how trees appeared? and besides, the case of the man born blind in John 9:0 required no such double healing. These things were  in the Lord’s power , and He ordered them as He pleased from present circumstances, or for our instruction.
