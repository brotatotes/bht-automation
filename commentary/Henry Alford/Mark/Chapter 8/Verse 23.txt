<b> 23.]</b> The leading of this blind man out of the town appears as if it had been from<i> some local reason</i>. In ver. 26 we find him forbidden expressly to enter into or tell it<i> in</i> the<i> town</i>, and with a repetition of<b> town</b>, which looks as if the place had been somehow unworthy of such a work being done there. (This is a serious objection against Meyer’s reason, that the<i> use of spittle</i> on both occasions occasioned the same privacy here and in ch. vii 33.) Or we may perhaps find the reason in our Lord’s<i> immediate</i><i> departure</i> to such a distance (ver. 27); and say, that He did not wish multitudes to gather about and follow Him.<br><br><b> when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him...</b> see above on ch. vii. 33.<br><br> We cannot say what may hare induced our Lord to form this miracle<i> at twice</i>—certainly not the reason assigned by Dr. Burton, “that a blind man would not, on suddenly recovering his sight, know one object from another, because he had never seen them before,” and so would require a double miracle;—a second to open the eyes of<i> his mind also</i>, to comprehend what he saw. This assumes the man to have been<i> born</i> blind, which he was not from ver. 24; for how should he know<i> how trees appeared?</i> and besides, the case of the man born blind in John ix. required no such double healing. These things were<i> in the Lord’s power</i>, and He them as He pl from present circumstances, or for our instruction.
