<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] <strong> I see men, because I see them walking as it were trees</strong> ; i.e. not distinct in individual peculiarity, but as trees in the hedge-row flit by the traveller. It is a minute mark of truth, that he describes the appearance of persons as he doubtless had often had occasion to do during the failing of sight which had ended in his blindness. By no possibility can the words convey, as Wordsw., three different stages of returning vision: “I see men. I see them standing still, and dimly, as trees. I see them walking.” For thus the <strong> ὅτι</strong> is altogether passed over, and περιπατοῦντας taken out of its government, and most unnaturally made into a sentence by itself.</p>
