CONFESSION OF PETER. Matt. xvi. 13–20. Luke ix. 18–21. With the exception of the introduction in Luke, which describes the Lord to have been<i> alone praying, and joined by his disciples,</i>—and the omission of the praise of and promise to Peter by both St. Mark and St. Luke, the three are in exact accordance. On this latter omission no stress must therefore be laid as to the character of<i> Mark's Gospel</i>, as has been done.
