<b> 31–IX. 1.]</b> ANNOUCEMENT OF HIS APPROACHING DEATH AND RESURRECTION. REBUKE OF PETER. Matt. xvi. 21–28. Luke ix. 22–27. St. Luke omits the rebuke of Peter. St. Mark adds, ver. 32,<b> he spake that saying openly</b>: and, in the rebuke of Peter, that the Lord said the words<b> looking on his disciples</b>. In vv. 34, 35, the agreement is close, except that St. Luke adds<i> daily after his cross</i>, and St. Mark<i> and the Gospel’s after my sake</i>, ver. 35 [it is perhaps worthy of remark that St. Mark writes<b> follow me</b> in ver. 34: possibly from the information of him, to whom it was said, “What is that to thee?<b> Follow thou me,</b>” John xxi. 22]; and informs us in ver. 34, that our Lord said these words,<i> having called the multitude with his disciples</i>. This Meyer calls<i> a contradiction to Matthew and Luke</i>,—and thinks it arose from a misunderstanding of St. Luke’s “<i>he said to them all.</i>” Far rather should I say that our account represents every detail to the life, and that the “<i>to them all</i>” contains<i> traces of it</i>. What wonder that a crowd should here, as every where else, have collected about Him and the disciples?
