 14 21. ] WARNING AGAINST THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES AND OF HEROD. Matthew 16:5-12 . Our account is fuller and more circumstantial, relating  that they had but one loaf in the ship, Mark 8:14 ; inserting the  additional reproofs , Mark 8:18 , and the reference to the two miracles of feeding more at length, Mark 8:19-21 . Mark however omits the  conclusion in Matt., that  they then understood that He spake to them of the doctrine, &c . Possibly this was a conclusion drawn in the mind of the narrator, not altogether identical with that to be drawn from our account here for the  leaven of Herod could not be  doctrine (  καὶ τ  .   ζ  .   Ἡρ  ., Mar 8:15 Mark only), but must be understood of the irreligious lives and fawning worldly practices of the hangers-on of the court of Herod.
