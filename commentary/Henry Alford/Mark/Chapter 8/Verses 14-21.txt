<p><strong> 14 21.</strong> ] WARNING AGAINST THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES AND OF HEROD. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:5-12">Matthew 16:5-12</span> . Our account is fuller and more circumstantial, relating <em> that they had but one loaf</em> in the ship, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:14">Mark 8:14</span> ; inserting the <em> additional reproofs</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:18">Mark 8:18</span> , and the reference to the two miracles of feeding more at length, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:19-21">Mark 8:19-21</span> . Mark however omits the <em> conclusion</em> in Matt., that <em> they then understood that He spake to them of the doctrine, &amp;c</em> . Possibly this was a conclusion drawn in the mind of the narrator, not altogether identical with that to be drawn from our account here for the <em> leaven of Herod</em> could not be <em> doctrine</em> ( <strong> καὶ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ζ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἡρ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> Mar 8:15 Mark only), but must be understood of the irreligious lives and fawning worldly practices of the hangers-on of the court of Herod.</p>
