 27 30. ] CONFESSION OF PETER. Matthew 16:13-20 . Luke 9:18-21 . With the exception of the introduction in Luke, which describes the Lord to have been  alone praying, and joined by his disciples , and the omission of the praise of and promise to Peter by both Mark and Luke, the three are in exact accordance. On this latter omission no stress must therefore be laid as to the character of  Markâ€™s Gospel , as has been done. (Thl. in 1. cited by De W.)
