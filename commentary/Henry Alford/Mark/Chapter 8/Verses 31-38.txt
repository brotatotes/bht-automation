<p><strong> 31 9:1.</strong> ] ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS APPROACHING DEATH AND RESURRECTION. REBUKE OF PETER. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21-28">Matthew 16:21-28</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:22-27">Luke 9:22-27</span> . Luke omits the rebuke of Peter. Mark adds, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:32">Mark 8:32</span> , παῤῥησίᾳ τ . λ . ἐλάλει : and, in the rebuke of Peter, that the Lord said the words ἰδὼν τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ . In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:34-35">Mark 8:34-35</span> , the agreement is close, except that Luke adds καθ ʼ ἡμέραν , after τὸν στ . αὐτοῦ , and Mark καὶ τοῦ εὐαγγ . after ἐμοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:35">Mark 8:35</span> (it is perhaps worthy of remark that St. Mark writes ἀκολουθεῖν in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:34">Mark 8:34</span> : possibly from the information of him, to whom it was said, τί πρός σε ; σύ μοι ἀκολούθει , Joh 21:22 ); and informs us, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:34">Mark 8:34</span> , that our Lord said these words, <em> having called the multitude with his disciples</em> . This Meyer calls <em> a contradiction to Matt. and Luke</em> , and thinks it arose from a misunderstanding of Luke’s πάντας . Far rather should I say that our account represents every detail to the life, and that the πρὸς πάντας contains <em> traces of it</em> . What wonder that a crowd should here, as every where else, have collected about Him and the disciples?</p>
