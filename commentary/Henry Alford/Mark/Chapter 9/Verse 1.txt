 31 9:1. ] ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS APPROACHING DEATH AND RESURRECTION. REBUKE OF PETER. Matthew 16:21-28 . Luke 9:22-27 . Luke omits the rebuke of Peter. Mark adds, Mark 8:32 , παῤῥησίᾳ τ . λ . ἐλάλει : and, in the rebuke of Peter, that the Lord said the words ἰδὼν τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ . In Mark 8:34-35 , the agreement is close, except that Luke adds καθ ʼ ἡμέραν , after τὸν στ . αὐτοῦ , and Mark καὶ τοῦ εὐαγγ . after ἐμοῦ , Mark 8:35 (it is perhaps worthy of remark that St. Mark writes ἀκολουθεῖν in Mark 8:34 : possibly from the information of him, to whom it was said, τί πρός σε ; σύ μοι ἀκολούθει , Joh 21:22 ); and informs us, in Mark 8:34 , that our Lord said these words,  having called the multitude with his disciples . This Meyer calls  a contradiction to Matt. and Luke , and thinks it arose from a misunderstanding of Luke’s πάντας . Far rather should I say that our account represents every detail to the life, and that the πρὸς πάντας contains  traces of it . What wonder that a crowd should here, as every where else, have collected about Him and the disciples?
