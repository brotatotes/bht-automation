But not to mention that such a sentence would be without example in our Lordâ€™s discourses, the sense given by it is meagre in the extreme. As it stands in the text, it forms a counter-question to that of the Apostles in ver. 11.<i> They asked</i><b> Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?</b> Our Lord answers-it by telling them that it is even so; and returns the question by another:<b> And how is it (also) written of the Son of Man, that he, &c?</b> Then comes the conclusion in ver. 13 with<b> But I say unto you,</b> stating that Elias<i> has come</i>, and leaving it therefore to be inferred that the sufferings of the Son of Man were close at hand. Notice how the<b> it is written of</b>, twice occurring, binds both together. Just as the first coming of the Son of Man is to suffer and to die, so has the first coming of Elias been as it was written of him; but there is a future coming of Elias to restore all things, and of the Son of Man in glory.
