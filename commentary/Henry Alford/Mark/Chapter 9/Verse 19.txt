<b> 19.] O faithless generation</b>, not addressed to<i> the man</i>, as unbelieving,—nor to the disciples,—but<i> generally</i>, to the race and generation among whom the Lord’s ministry was fulfilled. The additional words “<i>and perverse</i>” (Matthew, Luke) are probably from Deut. xxxii. 5; see further ib. ver. 20, where “<i>faithless</i>” is also expressed by “<i>children in whom is no faith</i>.” The question is not asked in a spirit of longing to be gone from them, but of holy impatience of their hardness of heart and unbelief. In this the father, disciples, Scribes, and multitude are equally involved.<br><br> “The kingdom of Satan, in small and great, is ever stirred into a fiercer activity by the coming near of the kingdom of Christ. Satan has great wrath, when his time is short” (Trench, Mir. 365). Vv. 21–27 are peculiar to Mark.
