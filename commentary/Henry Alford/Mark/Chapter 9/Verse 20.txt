 20. ]  ἰδών is out of strict concord with  πνεῦμα , but has regard to its personal signification: see also Mar 9:26 below. This construction is often found in the Apocalypse (reff.).
	“The kingdom of Satan, in small and great, is ever stirred into a fiercer activity by the coming near of the kingdom of Christ. Satan has great wrath, when his time is short.” (Trench, Mir. 365.)
	Mar 9:21-27 are peculiar to Mark.
