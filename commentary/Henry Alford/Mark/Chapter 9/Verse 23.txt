<b> 23.]</b> The most probable rendering of the original here is,<b> Jesus said to him the saying, “If thou canst believe, all things are,</b>”&c.: a saying which doubtless He often uttered on similar occasions, Some, omitting the<b> believe</b>, would set an interrogation after<b> canst</b>, and suppose our Lord to be citing the Father's words: “<i>didst thou say, ‘If thou canst?’—all things are</i>,”&c. Others, as Dr. Burton, suppose it to mean:— ‘Believe what you have expressed by your<b> if thou canst</b>,’&c. But both these renderings involve methods of construction and expression not usual in the Gospels. The<b> if thou canst believe</b> is a manifest reference to the<b> if thou canst do any thing</b> before, and meant to convey a reproof, as the father’s answer testifies. The sentence, also, unless I am mistaken, is meant to convey an intimation that the healing was not to be<i> an answer</i> to that challenge, so that<i> the Lord’s power</i> was to be challenged and proved,—but an answer to<i> faith</i>, which (of course by laying hold on Him who is Almighty)<i> can do all things</i>.
