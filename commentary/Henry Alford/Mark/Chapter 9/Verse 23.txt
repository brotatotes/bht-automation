<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] In <strong> τὸ εἰ δ</strong> <strong> . [</strong> <strong> πισ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ], the <strong> τό</strong> involves the sense in some difficulty. The most probable rendering is to make it designatory of the whole sentence, <strong> Jesus said to him the saying, “If thou canst believe, all things are,”</strong> &amp;c.: a saying which doubtless He often uttered on similar occasions, Kuinoel quotes a similar construction from Polyænus, iii. 9. 11, Ἰφικράτης ὑπολαβὼν ἔφη τὸ τίς ἂν ἤλπισε τοῦτο ἔσεσθαι . Some (e.g. Tischd [34] .) omitting the πιστεῦσαι would set an interrogation after δύνῃ , and suppose our Lord to be citing the father’s words: “ <em> didst thou say, ‘if thou canst?’ all things are</em> ,” &amp;c. Others, as Dr. Burton, suppose it to mean τὸ ‘ εἰ δύνῃ ʼ πίστευσαι ’ (imperative): ‘Believe what you have expressed by your εἴ τι δύνῃ , &amp;c.’ But both these renderings involve methods of construction and expression not usual in the Gospels. The εἰ δύνῃ is a manifest reference to the εἴ τι δύνῃ before, and meant to convey a reproof, as the father’s answer testifies. The sentence, also, unless I am mistaken, is meant to convey an intimation that the healing was not to be <em> an answer</em> to the εἴ τι δύνῃ , so that <em> the Lord’s power</em> was to be challenged and proved, but an answer to <em> faith</em> , which (of course by laying hold on Him who πάντα δύναται ) <em> can do all things</em> .
