 23. ] In  τὸ εἰ δ  . [  πισ  . ], the  τό involves the sense in some difficulty. The most probable rendering is to make it designatory of the whole sentence,  Jesus said to him the saying, “If thou canst believe, all things are,” &c.: a saying which doubtless He often uttered on similar occasions, Kuinoel quotes a similar construction from Polyænus, iii. 9. 11, Ἰφικράτης ὑπολαβὼν ἔφη τὸ τίς ἂν ἤλπισε τοῦτο ἔσεσθαι . Some (e.g. Tischd [34] .) omitting the πιστεῦσαι would set an interrogation after δύνῃ , and suppose our Lord to be citing the father’s words: “  didst thou say, ‘if thou canst?’ all things are ,” &c. Others, as Dr. Burton, suppose it to mean τὸ ‘ εἰ δύνῃ ʼ πίστευσαι ’ (imperative): ‘Believe what you have expressed by your εἴ τι δύνῃ , &c.’ But both these renderings involve methods of construction and expression not usual in the Gospels. The εἰ δύνῃ is a manifest reference to the εἴ τι δύνῃ before, and meant to convey a reproof, as the father’s answer testifies. The sentence, also, unless I am mistaken, is meant to convey an intimation that the healing was not to be  an answer to the εἴ τι δύνῃ , so that  the Lord’s power was to be challenged and proved, but an answer to  faith , which (of course by laying hold on Him who πάντα δύναται )  can do all things .
