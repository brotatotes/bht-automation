 24. ] Nothing can be more touching and  living than this whole most masterly and wonderful narrative. The poor father is drawn out into a sense of the unworthiness of his distrust, and “the little spark of faith which is kindled in his soul reveals to him the abysmal deeps of unbelief which are there.” (Trench, p. 367.) “Thus,” remarks Olshausen (B. Comm. i. 534), “does the Redeemer shew himself to the father as a μαιευτὴς πίστεως first, before He heals his son. In the struggle of his anxiety, the strength of Faith is  born , by the aid of Christ, in the soul empty of it before.”
	There is strong analogy in the Lord’s treatment of the father here, for the  sponsorial engagement in infant baptism. The  child is by its infirmity  incapacitated ; it is therefore  the father’s faith which is tested, and when that is proved, the child is healed. The fact is, that the analogy rests far deeper: viz. on the ‘inclusion’ of ‘the old man’ in Adam and the ‘new man’ in Christ: see Romans 5:12-21 . It may be well to remind the reader that there is nothing “more pathetic and expressive” (Wordsw.) in μου τῇ ἀποστίᾳ than in τ .  ἀπ  . μου : see on Matthew 16:18 .
