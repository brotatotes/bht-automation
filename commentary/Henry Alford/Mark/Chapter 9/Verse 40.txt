<p><strong> 40.</strong> ] This saying is not inconsistent with that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:30">Matthew 12:30</span> . They do not refer to the same thing. This is said of <em> outward conformity</em> that, of <em> inward unity of purpose</em> two widely different things. On that saying, see note there. On this, we may say all those who, notwithstanding outward differences of communion and government, <em> believe in and preach</em> Jesus Christ, without bitterly and uncharitably opposing each other, are hereby declared to be <em> helpers forward of each other’s work</em> . O that all Christians would remember this! Stier (Red. J. iii. 24) strongly deprecates the reading ἡμῶν ἡμῶν ; “The <strong> us</strong> in the mouth of our Lord here confuses and destroys nearly the whole purport of his weighty saying. For this is the very fault of the disciples, that they laid down outward and visible communion with <em> them</em> as the decisive criterion of communion with the Lord: and this very fault the Lord rebukes with his repudiatory ὑμῶν .” Still, there is a propriety, a tempering the rebuke with a gracious reminiscence of their unity with Him, and something exceedingly suiting the χριστοῦ ἐστέ below, in ἡμῶν ἡμῶν . In the divided state of the critical evidence, the reading must be ever doubtful.</p>
