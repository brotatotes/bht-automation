</b>These solemn repetitions of former declarations (see Matt. v. 29; xviii. 8, 9) are by no means to be regarded as arbit: insertions by this or that Evangelist, but as the truth of what was uttered by our Lord.<br><br> Vv. 44, 46, 48 are only in Mark; they are cited from Isaiah (see Isa. lxvi. 24), where the prophecy is of the<i> carcases of those who have transgressed against the Lord</i>. This triple repetition gives sublimity, and leaves no doubt of the discourse having been<i> verbatim</i> thus uttered. See note on Matt. v. 22.
