 49. ] In order to understand this difficult verse, it will be necessary first to examine its connexion and composition. (1) What is  γάρ ? It connects it with the solemn assertions in Mark 9:43-48 ,  καλόν ἐστίν σε  … and furnishes a  reason why it is better for us to cut off and cast away, &c.  πᾶς then is  every one , absolutely: referring back both to the σε , and the  αὐτῶν above  πᾶσα θυσία is (not  opposed to (Meyer), but)  parallel with  πᾶς  , and  καί equivalent to  just as . (2) This being stated, let us now enquire into  the symbolic terms used. FIRE is the  refiner’s fire of Malachi 3:2 , to which indeed there seems to be a reference; the fire of Mat 3:11 and Acts 2:3 ; of Ezekiel 28:14 (see my Hulsean Lectures for 1841, pp. 9 12). Fire is  the symbol of the divine purity and presence : our God is a  consuming fire , not only to his foes, but to his people: but in  them , the fire shall only burn up what is impure and requires purifying out, 1 Corinthians 3:13 ; 1Pe 1:7 ; 1 Peter 4:12 ; 1 Peter 4:17 . This very fire shall be to them as  a preserving salt . The SALT of the covenant of God (ref. Levit.) was to be mixed with  every sacrifice ; and it is with fire that  all men are to be salted . This fire is the divine purity and judgment  in the covenant , whose promise is, ‘I will dwell among them.’ And in and among this purifying fire shall the people of God ever walk and rejoice everlastingly. Revelation 21:23 . This is the right understanding of Isaiah 33:14-15 , ‘Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? &c. He that walketh in righteousness,’ &c. And thus the connexion with the preceding verses is, ‘it is better for thee to cut off,’ &c. ‘for it is  part of the salting of thee, the living sacrifice ( Rom 12:1 ), that every offence and scandal must be burnt out of thee before thou canst enter into life.’
