<b> 49.]</b> In order to understand this difficult verse, it will be necessary first to examine its connexion and composition. (1) What is<b> for</b>? It connects it with the solemn assertions in vv. 43–48,<b> it is better for thee</b>…, and furnishes a<i> reason why</i> it<b> is</b> better for us to cut off and cast away, &c.<br><br><b> every one</b> then is to be taken absolutely: referring back both to the<b> thee</b>, and the their above—<b>every sacrifice is</b> (not<i> opposed</i> to [Meyer], but)<i> parallel</i><i> with</i><b> every one</b>, and<b> and</b> equivalent to<b> just as</b>. (2) This being stated, let us now enquire into the symbolic terms used. FIRE, is the<i> refiner’s fire</i> of Mal. iii. 2, to which indeed there seems to be a reference; the fire of Matt. iii. 11 and Acts ii. 3; of Ezek. xxviii. 14 (see my Hulsean Lectures for 1841, pp 9–12). Fire is<i> the symbol of the divine purity and presence:</i>—our God is a<i> consuming fire</i>, not only to his foes, but to his people: but in<i> them</i>, the fire shall burn up only what is impure and requires purifying out, 1 Cor. iii. 13: 1 Pet. i. 7; iv. 12, 17. This very fire shall be to them as<i> a preserving salt</i>, The SALT of the covenant of God (Lev. ii. 18) was to be mixed with<i> every sacrifice</i>; and it is with fire that<i> all men are to be salted</i>. This fire is the divine purity and judgment<i> in the covenant</i>, whose promise is, ‘I will dwell among them.’ And in and among this purifying fire shall the people of God ever walk and rejoice everlastingly. Rev. xxi. 23. This is the right understanding of Isa. xxxiii. 14, 15, ‘Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?&c. He that walketh in righteousness,’&c. And thus the connexion with the preceding verses is,— ‘it is better for thee to cut off,’&c.— ‘for it is<i> part of the salting of thee, the living sacrifice</i> (Rom. xii. 1), that every offence and scandal must be burnt out of thee before thou canst enter into life.’ It is perhaps necessary to add that this is simply the explanation of our Lord’s words as they stand, in their symbolism and connexion. When Mr. Elliott objects to it as a ‘fearful comment,’ he has to do with<i> those words</i>, not with me. Surely, nothing but the most amazing power of misunderstanding can suppose the explanation inconsistent with such texts as Rom. viii. 1, 34: 1 John ii. 1, 2.
