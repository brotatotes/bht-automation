<b> 50.]</b> The connexion of this (elsewhere said in other references, Matt. v. 13: Luke xiv. 34) is now plain. If this fire which is to purify and act as a preserving salt to you, have, from the nullity and vapidity of the grace of the covenant in you,<i> no such power</i>,—it can only<i> consume</i>—the salt has lost its savour—the covenant is void—you will be cast out, as it is elsewhere added, and tho fire will be no longer the fire of<i> purification</i>, but of<i> wrath eternal</i>.<br><br> I will just add that the interpretation of the sacrifice as the<i> condemned</i>—and the fire and salt as<i> eternal fire</i>,—except in the case of the salt having lost its savour,<i> is contrary to the whole symbolism of</i><i> Scripture</i>, and to the exhortation with which this verse ends: ‘Have this of God—this spirit of adoption—this pledge of the covenant, in yourselves;—and,’ with reference to the strife out of which the discourse sprung,— ‘have peace with one another.’
