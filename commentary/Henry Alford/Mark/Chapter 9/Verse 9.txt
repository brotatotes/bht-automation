Two remarkable additions occur in our text;—ver. 10, which indicates<i> apostolic authority</i>, and that of<i> one of the Three</i>;—and the last clause of ver. 12.<br><br><b> what the rising from the dead should mean</b> does not refer to the<i> Resurrection generally</i>, for it was an article of Jewish belief, and connected with the times of the Messiah; but to<i> His Resurrection as connected with his Death; the whole</i> was enigmatical to them.
