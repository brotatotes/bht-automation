 33 50. ] DISCOURSE RESPECTING THE GREATEST AMONG THEM. Matthew 18:1-9 . Luke 9:46-50 . Here again the three accounts are  independent , and differ in some particulars unimportant in themselves, but very instructive for a right comparison of the three Gospels. First take Luke’s account.  The disciples had been disputing; our Lord knowing the strife of their hearts, took a child , &c. Then compare Mark  our Lord asked them, on coming into a house, what had been the subject of their dispute; they were silent from shame; He sat down, delivered his sentence to the twelve, and then took the child , &c. Lastly turn to Matt. There,  the disciples themselves referred the question to our Lord, and He took the child , &c. Who can forbear seeing in these narratives the unfettered and independent testimony of three witnesses, consistent with one another in the highest form and spirit of truthfulness, but differing in the mere letter? Mark’s account is again the richest and fullest, and we can hardly doubt that if the  literal exact detail of fact is in question, we have it here.
