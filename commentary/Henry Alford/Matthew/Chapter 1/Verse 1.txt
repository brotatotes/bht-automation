Here however it appears that it refers exclusively to the genealogy, by “<i>Jesus Christ</i>” being used in the enunciation, and the close being “<i>Jesus</i> which is called<i> Christ</i>.” Then ver. 17 forms a conclusion to it, and ver. 18 passes on to other matter.<br><br><b> Jesus</b>] See on ver. 21.<br><br><b> Christ</b>] The word is equivalent to the Hebrew<i> Messiah</i>,<b> anointed</b>. It is used of kings, priests, prophets, and of the promised Deliverer. It is here used (see ver. 16) in that sense in which it became affixed to Jesus as the name of our Lord. It does not once thus occur in the progress of the Evangelic<i> history</i>; only in the prefatory parts of the Gospels, here and vv. 16, 17, 18: Mark i. 1: John i. 17, and once in the mouth of our Lord Himself, John xvii. 3; but continually in the Acts and Epistles.
