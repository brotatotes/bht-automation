<p><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> βίβλος γενέσεως</strong> ] Not always used of a pedigree only: see reff. Here however it appears that it refers exclusively to the genealogy, by Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ being used in the enunciation, and the close being Ἰησοῦς ὁ λεγόμενος χριστός . Then Mat 1:17 forms a conclusion to it, and Mat 1:18 passes on to other matter.

<p><strong> χριστοῦ</strong> ] = מָשִׁיחַ , <strong> anointed.</strong> In reff. it is used of kings, priests, prophets, and of the promised Deliverer. Theophylact says, λέγεται ὁ κύριος , <strong> χριστός</strong> <strong> ·</strong> καὶ <strong> ὡς βασιλεύς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ἐβασίλευσε γὰρ κατὰ τῆς ἁμαρτίας · καὶ <strong> ὡς ἱερεύς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> προσήγαγε γὰρ ἑαυτὸν θῦμα ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν · ἐχρίσθη δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς κυρίως τῷ ἀληθινῷ ἐλαίῳ , τῷ ἁγίῳ πνεύματι . It is here used (see Mat 1:16 ) in that sense in which it became affixed to Ἰησοῦς as the name of our Lord. It does not once thus occur in the progress of the Evangelic <em> history;</em> only in the prefatory parts of the Gospels, here and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:16-18">Matthew 1:16-18</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:1">Mark 1:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:17">John 1:17</span> , and once in the mouth of our Lord himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span> (on Pilate’s words, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:17">Matthew 27:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:22">Matthew 27:22</span> , see note there); but passim in the Acts and Epistles. This may serve to shew that the evangelic memoirs themselves were of earlier date than their incorporation into our present Gospels.

<p><strong> υἱοῦ</strong> both times refers to our Lord. בֶּן דָּוִד (Ben-David) was an especial title of the Messiah: see reff. That He should be <em> son of Abraham</em> , was too solemn a subject of prophecy to be omitted here, even though implied in the other. These words serve to shew the character of the Gospel, as written <em> for Jews:</em> οὐδὲν γὰρ οὕτως ἀνέπαυε τοὺς ἐξ Ἰουδαίων πεπιστευκότας , ὡς τὸ μαθεῖν ὅτι ἐκ σπέρματος Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Δαυὶδ ἦν ὁ χριστός . Euthymius. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:23">Luke 3:23</span> ff., carries his genealogy further back.</p>
