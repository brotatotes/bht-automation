<p><strong> 13. </strong> <strong> Ζοροβ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> Ἀβιούδ</strong> ] Abiud is not mentioned as a son of the Zerubbabel in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:1-24">1 Chronicles 3:1-24</span> .
	</p>
<p>Lord A. Hervey, p. 122 ff., has made it probable that Abiud is identical with the Hodaiah of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:24">1 Chronicles 3:24</span> , and the Juda of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:26">Luke 3:26</span> . Dr. Mill (p. 178, note) mentions this conjecture, but does not adopt it. The objection, that thus the first generation after Zerubbabel would be omitted, need not have much weight, after the omission of three generations in the last tesseradecade. I cannot but recommend to the student the perusal of Lord A. Hervey’s work. Whether or not we may be inclined to adopt his conjectures on so intricate and uncertain a subject as the reconciling of the genealogies, too much praise cannot be given to the spirit of combined Christian reverence and enlightened critical courage in which it is treated throughout.
