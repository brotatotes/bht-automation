<b> 17. fourteen generations</b>] If we carefully observe Matthew’s arrangement, we shall have no difficulty in completing the three “<i>fourteens</i>.” For the first is from Abraham to David, of course inclusive. The second from David (again inclusive) to the<i> migration</i>; which gives no name, as before, to be included in both the second and third periods, but which is mentioned simultaneously with the begetting of Jechonias, leaving him for the third period. This last, then, takes in from Jechonias to JESUS CHRIST inclusive. So that the three stand thus, according to the words of this verse: (1) from Abraham to David. (2) From David to the migration to Babylon, i.e. about the time when Josiah begat Jechonias. (3) From the migration (i. e. from Jechonias) to Christ.
