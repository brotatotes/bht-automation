<p><strong> 17. </strong> <strong> γενεαὶ δεκατέσσαρες</strong> ] If we carefully observe Matthew’s arrangement, we shall have no difficulty in completing the three tesseradecades. For the first is from Abraham to David, of course inclusive. The second from David (again inclusive) to the <em> migration;</em> which gives no name, as before, to be included in both the second and third periods, but which is mentioned simultaneously with the begetting of Jechonias, leaving him for the third period. This last, then, takes in from Jechonias to JESUS CHRIST inclusive. So that the three stand thus, according to the words of this verse: (1) ἀπὸ Ἀβραὰμ ἕως Δαυίδ . (2) ἀπὸ Δαυὶδ ἕως τ . μετ . Βαβ ., i.e. about the time when Josiah begat Jechonias. (3) ἀπὸ τ . μετ . Βαβ . (i.e. from Jechonias) ἕως τοῦ χριστοῦ . We may safely say, that the <strong> πᾶσαι</strong> <em> does not</em> , as Meyer, imply that Matthew intended to give the genealogy complete, and was not aware of the omissions. For why should this be so? May it not just as well be said, that having, for the convenience of his readers, reduced the genealogy to this form, he then says to them, “So then you have from Abraham to David, 14 generations, &amp;c.?”</p>
