<b> 21. Jesus</b>] The same name as Joshua, the former deliverer of Israel. Philo says, “Jesus is, being interpreted, ‘The salvation of the Lord.’”<br><br><b> He</b>] emphatically:<b> He alone</b>: best rendered, perhaps, ‘<i>it is He that</i>.’<br><br><b> his people</b>] In primary sense,<i> the Jews</i>, of whom alone Joseph could have understood the words: but in the larger sense, all who believe on Him: an explanation which the tenor of prophecy (cf. Gen. xxii. 18: Deut. xxxii. 21), and the subsequent admission of the Gentiles, warrant. Cf. a similar use of ‘Israel’ by St. Peter, Acts v. 31.<br><br><b> from their sins</b>] It is remarkable that in this early part of the evangelic history, in the midst of pedigrees, and the disturbances of thrones by the supposed temporal King of the Jews, we have so clear an indication of the<i> spiritual nature of the office of Christ</i>. One circumstance of this kind outweighs a thousand cavils against the historical reality of the narration. If I mistake not, this announcement reaches further into the deliverance to be wrought, by Jesus, than any thing mentioned by the Evangelist subsequently. It thus bears the internal impress of a message from God, treasured up and related in its original formal terms.— “Sins” is not put for the<i> punishment of sin</i>, but is the sin itself—<b>the practice of sin</b>, in its most pregnant sense. ‘How suggestive it is,’ remarks Bishop Ellicott, ‘that while to the loftier spirit of Mary the name of Jesus is revealed with all the prophetic associations of more than David’s glories—to Joseph, perchance the aged Joseph, who might have long seen and realized his own spiritual needs, and the needs of those around him, it is specially said, thou shalt call his name Jesus:<i> for He shall save his people from their sins.</i>’ Historical Lectures on the Life of our Lord, p. 56.
