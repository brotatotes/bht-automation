<p><strong> 22. </strong> <strong> τοῦτο δὲ ὃλον</strong> ] It is impossible to interpret ἵνα in any other sense than <strong> in order that.</strong> The words τοῦτο δὲ ὅ . γέγ . and the uniform usage of the N.T., in which ἵνα is never used except in this sense, forbid any other. Nor, if rightly viewed, does the passage require any other. Whatever may have been the partial fulfilment of the prophecy in the time of Ahaz, its reference to a different time, and a higher deliverance, is undeniable: and then, whatever causes contributed to bring about τοῦτο ὅλον , might be all summed up in the fulfilment of the divine purpose, of which that prophecy was the declaration. The accomplishment of a promise formally made is often alleged as the cause of an action extending wider than the promise, and purposed long before its utterance. And of course these remarks apply to every passage where ἵνα or ὅπως πληρωθῇ are used. Such a construction can have but one meaning. If such meaning involve us in difficulty regarding the prophecy itself, far better leave such difficulty, in so doubtful a matter as the interpretation of prophecy, unsolved, than create one in so simple a matter as the rendering of a phrase whose meaning no indifferent person could doubt.

<p><strong> πληρωθῇ</strong> ] The immediate and literal fulfilment of the prophecy seems to be related in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:1-4">Isaiah 8:1-4</span> . Yet there the child was <em> not</em> called Emmanuel: but in Mat 1:8 that name is used as applying to one of far greater dignity. Again, Isa 9:6 seems to be a reference to this prophecy, as also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:3">Micah 5:3</span> .</p>
