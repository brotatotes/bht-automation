 23.   ἡ παρθένος ] Such is the rendering of the LXX. The Hebrew word is the more general term הָעַלְמָה . and is translated by Aquil., Symm., and Theodot. ἡ νεᾶνις . De Wette cites the LXX rendering as a proof that the prophecy was then understood of the Messiah. But is it not much more probable that Aquila and the others rendered it νεᾶνις to  avoid this application? Can it be shewn that the birth of the Messiah from a παρθένος  was matter of previous expectation? Certainly Pearson (on the Creed, art. iii.) fails to substantiate this.
	 καλέσουσιν ] This indefinite plural is surely not without meaning here.  Men shall call i.e. it shall be a name by which He shall be called one of his appellations. The change of person from καλέσεις , which could not well have been cited here, seems to shew, both that the prophecy had a literal fulfilment at the time, and that it is here quoted in a form suited to its greater and final fulfilment. The Hebrew has קָרָאת , ‘  thou shalt call ’ (fem.).
	 Ἐμμανουήλ ] = עִמָּנוּ אֵל ,  God (  is )  with us. In Isaiah, prophetic primarily of deliverance from the then impending war; but also of final and glorious deliverance by the manifestation of God in the flesh.
	 ὅ ἐστιν μεθ  . ] This addition is by some used to shew that Matthew wrote his Gospel in Greek, not in Hebrew, in which it would not be likely to occur. On the other hand, it is said, it might have been inserted by the person who translated the Gospel into Greek. See Prolegomena, and John 4:25 .
