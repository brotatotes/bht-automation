<p><strong> 10. </strong> <strong> ἄξιος γάρ</strong> ] This is a common truth of life men give one who works for them his food and more; here uttered however by our Lord in its highest sense, as applied to the workmen in His vineyard. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:13-14">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:8">2 Corinthians 11:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:8">3 John 1:8</span> . It is (as Stier remarks, vol. i. p. 352, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+2:0">Exodus 2:0</span> ) a gross perversion and foolish bondage to the letter, to imagine that ministers of congregations, or even missionaries among the heathen, at this day are bound by the <em> literal</em> sense of our Lord’s commands in this passage. But we must not therefore imagine that they are not bound by the <em> spirit</em> of them. This literal first mission was but a foreshadowing of the spiritual subsequent sending out of the ministry over the world, which ought therefore <em> in spirit</em> every where to be conformed to these rules.</p>
