 10.   ἄξιος γάρ ] This is a common truth of life men give one who works for them his food and more; here uttered however by our Lord in its highest sense, as applied to the workmen in His vineyard. See 1 Corinthians 9:13-14 ; 2 Corinthians 11:8 ; 3 John 1:8 . It is (as Stier remarks, vol. i. p. 352, Exodus 2:0 ) a gross perversion and foolish bondage to the letter, to imagine that ministers of congregations, or even missionaries among the heathen, at this day are bound by the  literal sense of our Lord’s commands in this passage. But we must not therefore imagine that they are not bound by the  spirit of them. This literal first mission was but a foreshadowing of the spiritual subsequent sending out of the ministry over the world, which ought therefore  in spirit every where to be conformed to these rules.
