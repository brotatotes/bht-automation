<b> 10. for the workman...</b>] This is a common truth of life—men give one who works for them his food and more; here uttered however by our Lord in its highest sense, as applied to the workmen in His vineyard. See 1 Cor. ix. 13, 14: 2 Cor. xi. 8: 3 John 8. It is (as Stier remarks, vol. i.p. 352, ed. 2) a gross perversion and foolish bondage to the letter, to imagine that ministers of congregations, or even missionaries among the heathen, at this day are bound by the<i> literal</i> sense of our Lord’s commands in this passage. But we must not therefore imagine that they are not bound by the<i> spirit</i> of them. This literal first mission was but a foreshadowing of the spiritual subsequent sending out of the ministry over the world, which ought therefore<i> in spirit</i> every where to be conformed to these rules.
