 11.   ἄξιος ]  Inclined to receive you and your message, worthy that you should become his guest: so ἄξιος is used with reference to the matter treated of in the context, see reff. Such persons in this case would be of the same kind as those spoken of Act 13:48 as τεταγμένοι εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον . The precept in this verse is very much more fully set forth by Luke 10:7 ff.
	 ἕως ἂν ἐξέλθητε ]  Until ye depart out of the city.
