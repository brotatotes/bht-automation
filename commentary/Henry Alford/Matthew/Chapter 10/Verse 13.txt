 13.   ἡ εἰρήνη ὑμ  . ] The peace mentioned in the customary Eastern salutation שָׁלוֹם לָךְ . Luke has εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ ( Mat 10:5 ). Compare with the spirit of Matthew 10:10-13 , ch. Matthew 7:6 . Stier remarks (Reden Jesu, i. p. 355, Exodus 2:0 ), that the spirit of these commands binds Christian ministers to all accustomed courtesies of manner in the countries and ages in which their mission may lie. So we find the Greek χαίρειν instead of the Jewish form of greeting, Acts 15:23 ; James 1:1 . And the same spirit forbids that repelling official pride by which so many ministers lose the affections of their people. And this is to be  without any respect to the worthiness or otherwise of the inhabitants of the house. In the case of  unworthiness , ‘let your peace return (see Isa 45:23 ) to you,’ i.e. ‘be as though you had never spoken it,’ μηδὲν ἐνεργησάτω , ἀλλὰ ταύτην μεθ ʼ ἑαυτῶν λαβόντες ἐξέλθετε .
