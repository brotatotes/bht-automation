<b> 13.</b>] The peace mentioned is that in the customary Eastern salutation, Peace be with you. Luke has<i> Peace be to this house</i> (x. 5). Compare with the spirit of vv. 10–13,—ch. vii. 6. Stier remarks that the spirit of these commands binds Christian ministers to all accustomed courtesies of manner in the countries and ages in which their mission may lie. So we find the Greek salutation instead of the Jewish form of greeting, Acts xv. 23: James i. 1. And the same spirit forbids that repelling official pride by which so many ministers lose the affections of their people. And this is to be<i> without any respect to the worthiness or otherwise</i> of the inhabitants of the house. In the case of<i> unworthiness</i>, ‘let your peace return (See Isa. xlv. 23) to you,’ i.e. ‘be as though you had never spoken it.”
