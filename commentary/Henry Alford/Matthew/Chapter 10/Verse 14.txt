<b> 14.</b>] See Acts, in the references. A solemn act which might have two meanings: (1) as Luke x. 11 expresses at more length,— ‘We take nothing of yours with us, we free ourselves from all contact and communion with you;’ or (2),—which sense probably lies beneath both this and ver. 13, ‘We free ourselves from all participation in your condemnation: will have nothing in common with those who have rejected God’s message.’ See 1 Kings ii. 5, where the<i> shoes on the feet</i> are mentioned as<i> partakers in the guilt of blood</i>. It was a custom of the Pharisees, when they entered Judæa from a Gentile land, to do this act, as renouncing all communion with Gentiles: those then who would not receive the apostolic message were to be treated as no longer Israelites, but Gentiles. Thus the verse forms a kind of introduction to the next portion of the discourse, where the future mission to the Gentiles is treated of.<br><br> The<b> or city</b> brings in the alternative; “house, if it be a house that rejects you, city, if a whole city.”
