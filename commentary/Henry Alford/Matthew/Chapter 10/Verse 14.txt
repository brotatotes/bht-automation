 14. ] See Acts 13:51 ; Acts 18:6 . A solemn act which might have two meanings: (1) as Luk 10:11 expresses at more length, ‘We take nothing of yours with us, we free ourselves from all contact and communion with you;’ or (2), which sense probably lies beneath both this and Matthew 10:13 , ‘We free ourselves from all participation in your condemnation: will have nothing in common with those who have rejected God’s message.’ See 1 Kings 2:5 , where the  shoes on the feet are mentioned as  partakers in the guilt of blood . It was a custom of the Pharisees, when they entered Judæa from a Gentile land, to do this act, as renouncing all communion with Gentiles: those then who would not receive the apostolic message were to be treated as no longer Israelites, but Gentiles. Thus the verse forms a kind of introduction to the next portion of the discourse, where the future mission to the Gentiles is treated of. The  ἢ τῆς πόλεως ἐκ  . brings in the alternative; “house, if it be a house that rejects you, city, if a whole city.”
