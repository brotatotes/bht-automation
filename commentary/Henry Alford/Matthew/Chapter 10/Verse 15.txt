<b> 15.</b>] The<i> first</i><b> verily I say unto you</b>; with which expression our Lord<i> closes each portion</i> of this discourse.<br><br><b> day of judgment</b>, i.e.<i> of final</i> judgment, = “<i>that day</i>” Luke x. 12. It must be noticed that this denunciatory part, as also the command to shake off the dust, applies<i> only to the people of Israel</i>, who had been long prepared for the message of the Gospel by the Law and the Prophets, and recently more particularly by John the Baptist; and in this sense it may still apply to the rejection of the Gospel by professing Christians; but as it was not then applicable to the Gentiles, so neither now can it be to the heathen who know not God.
