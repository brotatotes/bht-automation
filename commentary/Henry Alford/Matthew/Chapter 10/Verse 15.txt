<p><strong> ἡμέρα κρίσεως</strong> <strong> ,</strong> the day of final judgment, = ἡμέρα ἐκείνη , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:12">Luke 10:12</span> . The omission of the articles does not alter the definiteness of the meaning; as in the case also of υἱὸς θεοῦ . See note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:3">Matthew 4:3</span> .

<p>It must be noticed that this denunciatory part, as also the command to shake off the dust, applies <em> only to the people of Israel</em> , who had been long prepared for the message of the Gospel by the Law and the Prophets, and recently more particularly by John the Baptist; and in this sense it may still apply to the rejection of the Gospel by professing Christians: but as it was not then applicable to the Gentiles, so neither now can it be to the heathen who know not God.</p>
