The former verse was of<i> Jewish</i> persecution; this, of<i> Gentile</i>: the concluding words shew that the scope of both, in the divine purposes, as regarded the Apostles, was the same, viz.<b> for a testimony</b>.

It was a testimony in the best sense to Sergius Paulus, Acts xiii. 7, but<i> against</i> Felix, Acts xxiv. 25; and this double power ever belongs to the word of God as preached—it is a “<i>two-edged sword</i>” Rev. i. 16; ii. 12).
