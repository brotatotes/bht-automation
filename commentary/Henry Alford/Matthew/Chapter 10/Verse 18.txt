 18. ]  καὶ  .…   δέ implies,  yea and moreover; assuming what has just been said and passing on to something more. The words are always separated, except in the Epic poets. See Viger, ed. Herm. p. 545 (note), 844: Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 181 f.: Klotz ad Devar. p. 645.
	 ἡγεμόνας Proconsuls, Proprætors, Procurators, as (Pontius Pilate,) Felix, Festus, Gallio, Sergius Paulus.
	 βασιλεῖς  , as (Herod,) Agrippa. The former verse was of  Jewish persecution; this, of  Gentile: the concluding words shew that the scope of both, in the divine purposes, as regarded the Apostles, was the same, viz. εἰς μαρτ . αὐτ . κ . τ . ἔθν . The  μαρτ  . is in both senses a testimony  to , and  against them (see ch. Matthew 8:4 , note), and refers to both bets of persecutors:  αὐτοῖς  , to  them , i.e. the Jews (not the ἡγ . καὶ βασ . for they are in most cases Gentiles themselves),  καὶ τοῖς ἔθν  . It was a testimony in the best sense  to Sergius Paulus, Acts 13:7 , but  against Felix, Acts 24:25 ; and this double power ever belongs to the word of God as preached it is a δίστομος ῥομφαία (Revelation 1:16 ; Rev 2:12 ).
