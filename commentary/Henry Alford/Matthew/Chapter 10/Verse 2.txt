<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] We have in the N.T. <em> four</em> catalogues of the Apostles: the present one, at <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:16">Mark 3:16</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:14">Luke 6:14</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:13">Acts 1:13</span> . All seem to follow one common outline, but fill it up very differently. The following table will shew the agreements and differences

(3) That in the <em> first</em> class the two arrangements are ( α ), that of Matt. and Luke (Gospel), <em> Peter</em> and <em> Andrew, brothers; James</em> and <em> John, brothers;</em> i.e. according to their order of calling and connexion, and with reference to their being sent out in couples, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7">Mark 6:7</span> ; ( β ) Mark and Luke (Acts), <em> Peter, James, John</em> , (the three principal,) and <em> Andrew;</em> i.e. according to their personal pre-eminence. In the <em> second</em> class ( γ ), that of Matt., Mark, and Luke (Gospel), <em> Philip</em> and <em> Bartholomew, Matthew</em> and <em> Thomas</em> (or, as given by Matthew himself, <em> Thomas</em> and <em> Matthew</em> ), i.e. in <em> couples:</em> ( δ ) Luke (Acts), <em> Philip, Thomas, Barth., Matthew</em> (reason uncertain). In the <em> third</em> class ( ε ), Matt. and Mark, <em> James, the</em> (son?) <em> of Alphœus</em> and ( <em> Lebb</em> .) <em> Thaddæus, Simon the Cananœan</em> and <em> Judas Iscariot;</em> i.e. in <em> couples:</em> ( ζ ) Luke (Gosp. and Acts) <em> James the</em> (son?) <em> of Alphœus, Simon Zelotes, Judas</em> Ἰακώβου and <em> Judas Iscariot</em> (uncertain). ( η ) Thus in <em> all four</em> , the leaders of the three classes are <em> the same</em> , viz. <em> Peter, Philip</em> , and <em> James the</em> (son?) <em> of Alphœus;</em> and the <em> traitor</em> is always last. (4) It would appear then that the only difficulties are these two: the identity of Lebbæus with Thaddæus, and with Judas Ἰακώβου , and of Simon καναναῖος with Simon ὁ καλ . ζηλωτής. These will be discussed under the names.VacantΣίμων ὁ ζηλωτήςΣίμων ὁ καλ. ζηλωτήςΘαδδαῖοςΒαρθολομαῖοςΘωμᾶςἸωάννηςἈνδρέαςἸάκωβος

<p><strong> πρῶτος</strong> ] Not only as regards arrangement, or mere priority of calling, but as <em> primus inter pares</em> . This is clearly shewn from James and John and Andrew being set next, and Judas Iscariot the last, in all the catalogues. We find Simon Peter, not only in the lists of the Apostles, but also in their history, prominent on various occasions before the rest. Sometimes he <em> speaks in their name</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:27">Matthew 19:27</span> ; Luk 12:41 ); sometimes <em> answers when all are addressed</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span> [111] ); sometimes our Lord addresses him as <em> principal</em> , even among the three favoured ones (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:40">Matthew 26:40</span> ; Luk 22:31 ); sometimes he is addressed by others as <em> representing the whole</em> (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:24">Matthew 17:24</span> ; Act 2:37 ). He appears as the <em> organ of the Apostles</em> after our Lord’s ascension (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:14">Acts 2:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:8">Acts 4:8</span> ; Act 5:29 ): the first speech, and apparently that which decided the Council, is spoken by him, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7">Acts 15:7</span> . All this accords well with the bold and energetic character of Peter, and originated in the unerring discernment and appointment of our Lord Himself, who saw in him a person adapted to take precedence of the rest in the founding of His Church, and shutting (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:3">Acts 5:3</span> ; Act 5:9 ) and opening (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:14">Acts 2:14</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:41">Acts 2:41</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:5">Acts 10:5</span> ; Act 10:46 ) the doors of the kingdom of Heaven. That however no such idea was current among the Apostles as that he was destined to be the <em> Primate of the future Church</em> is as clear as the facts above mentioned. For (1) <em> no trace of such a pre-eminence is found in all the Epistles of the other Apostles;</em> but when he is mentioned, it is either, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:5">1 Corinthians 9:5</span> , as one of the Apostles, one example among many, but in no wise the chief; or as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7-8">Galatians 2:7-8</span> , with a distinct account of a peculiar province of duty and preaching being allotted to him, viz. the apostleship of the circumcision, (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span> ,) as distinguished from Paul, to whom was given the apostleship of the uncircumcision: or as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span> , as one of the principal στύλοι , together with James and John; or as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11">Galatians 2:11</span> , as subject to rebuke from Paul as from an equal. And (2) <em> wherever by our Lord Himself the future constitution of His Church is alluded to, or by the Apostles its actual constitution, no hint of any such primacy is given</em> , (see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> ,) but the whole college of Apostles are spoken of as absolutely equal. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:27-28">Matthew 19:27-28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:26">Matthew 20:26</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span> , and many other places. Again (3) <em> in the two Epistles which we have from his own hand, there is nothing for, but every thing against, such a supposition</em> . He exhorts the πρεσβύτεροι as being their συμπρεσβύτερος ( 1Pe 5:1 ): describes himself as τῆς μελλούσης ἀποκαλύπτεσθαι δόξης κοινωνός : addresses his second Epistle τοῖς ἰσότιμον ἡμῖν λαχοῦσιν πίστιν ( 2Pe 1:1 ): and makes not the slightest allusion to any pre-eminence over the other Apostles.

When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt.

<p>So that πρῶτος here must be understood as signifying the prominence of Peter among the Apostles, as well as his early calling. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span> .)

<p><strong> ὁ λεγόμενος Πέτρος</strong> ] Or Κηφᾱς , כֵּיפָא , so named by our Lord Himself (John as above) at His first meeting with him, and again more solemnly, and with a direct reference to the meaning of the name, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> Ἀνδρέας</strong> ] He, in conjunction with John (see note on Joh 1:37-41 ), was a disciple of the Baptist, and both of them followed our Lord, on their Master pointing Him out as the Lamb of God. They did not however from that time constantly accompany Him, but received a more solemn calling (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:17-22">Matthew 4:17-22</span> ; Luk 5:1-11 ) in the narrative of which Peter is prominent, and so πρῶτος called as an Apostle, at least, of those four.
