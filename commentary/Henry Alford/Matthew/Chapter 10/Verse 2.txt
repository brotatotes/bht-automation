<b> 2.</b>] We have in the N.T.<i> four</i> catalogues of the Apostles: the present one,—and those at Mark iii. 16,—Luke vi. 14,—Acts i. 13. All seem to follow one common out-line, but fill it up very differently. The following table will shew the agreements and differences:—<br><br><br><br> From this it appears (1), that in all four<i> three classes</i> are enumerated, and that each class contains (assuming at present the identity of Lebbæus with Thaddæus, and of Thaddæus with Judas (the brother of James), the<i> same persons</i> in all four, but in different order, with the following exceptions:—that (2)<i> Peter, Philip, James</i> (the son?)<i> of Alph</i> æ<i> us</i>, and<i> Judas Iscariot</i> hold the same places in all four. (3) That in the<i> first</i> class the two arrangements are (<i>a</i>) that of Matt. and Luke (Gospel),—<i>Peter</i> and<i> Andrew, brothers</i>;<i> James</i> and<i> John, brothers</i>;—i. e. according to their order of calling and connexion, and with reference to their being sent out in couples, Mark vi. 7: (<i>b</i>) Mark and Luke (Acts),—<i>Peter, James, John,</i> (the three principal,) and<i> Andrew</i>;—i. e. according to their personal pre-eminence. In the<i> second</i> class (<i>c</i>), that of Matt., Mark, and Luke (Gospel),—<i>Philip</i> and<i> Bartholomew, Mat-thew and Thomas</i>,—i. e. in<i> couples</i>: (<i>d</i>) Luke (Acts),—<i>Philip, Thomas, Barth. Matthew</i> (reason uncertain). In the<i> third</i> class (<i>e</i>), Matt. and Mark,—<i>James</i> (the son?)<i> of Alph</i> æ<i> us</i> and (<i>Lebb.</i>)<i> Thaddeus, Simon the Canan</i> æ<i> an and Judas Iscariot</i>; i.e. in<i> couples</i>: (<i>f</i>) Luke (Gosp. and Acts)<i> James</i> (the son?)<i> of Alph</i> æ<i> us, Simon Zelo-tes, Judas</i> (the brother?)<i> of James and Judas Iscariot</i> (uncertain). (<i>g</i>) Thus in<i> all four</i>, the leaders of the three classes are<i> the same</i>, viz.<i> Peter, Philip, and James</i> (the son?)<i> of Alph</i> æ<i> us</i>; and the traitor is always last. (4) It would appear then that the only difficulties are these two: the identity of Lebbæus with Thaddæus, and with Judas (the brother?) of James, and of Simon the Cananæan with Simon Zelotes. These will be discussed under the names.<br><br><b> The first</b>] Not only as regards arrangement, or mere priority of calling, but as first in rank among equals. This is clearly shewn from James and John and Andrew being set next, and Judas Iscariot the last, in all the catalogues. We find Simon Peter, not only in the lists of the Apostles, but also in their history, prominent on various occasions before the rest. Sometimes he<i> speaks in their name</i> (Matt. xix. 27: Luke xii. 41); sometimes<i> answers when all are addressed</i> (Matt. xvi. 16||); sometimes our Lord addresses him as<i> principal</i>, even among the three favoured ones (Matt. xxvi. 40: Luke xxii. 31); sometimes he is addressed by others as<i> representing the whole</i> (Matt. xvii. 24: Acts ii. 37). He appears as the<i> organ of the Apostles</i> after our Lord’s ascension (Acts i. 15; ii. 14; iv. 8; v. 29): the first speech, and apparently that which decided the Council, is spoken by him, Acts xv. 7. All this accords well with the bold and energetic character of Peter, and originated in the unerring discernment and appointment of our Lord Himself, who saw in him a person adapted to take precedence of the rest in the founding of His Church, and shutting (Acts v. 3, 9) and opening (Acts ii. 14, 41; x. 5, 46) the doors of the kingdom of Heaven. That however no such idea was current among the Apostles as that he was destined to be the<i> Primate of the future Church</i>, is as clear as the facts above mentioned. For (1)<i> no trace of such a pre-eminence is found in all the Epistles of the other Apostles</i>; but when he is mentioned, it is either, as 1 Cor. ix. 5, as one of the Apostles, one example among many, but in no wise the chief;—or as in Gal. ii. 7, 8, with a distinct account of a peculiar province of duty and preaching being allotted to him, viz. the apostleship of the circumcision (see 1 Pet. i. 1,) as distinguished from Paul, to whom was given the apostleship of the uncircumcision;—or as in Gal. ii. 9, as one of the principal<i> pillars</i>, together with James and John;—or as in Gal. ii, 11, as subject to rebuke from Paul as from an equal. And (2)<i> wherever by our Lord Himself the future constitution of His Church is alluded to, or by the Apostles its actual constitution, no hint of any such primacy is given</i> (see note on Matt. xvi. 18), but the whole college of Apostles are spoken of as absolutely equal. Matt. xix. 27, 28; xx. 26, 28: Eph. ii. 20, and many other places. Again (3)<i> in the two Epistles which we have from his own hand, there is nothing for, but every thing against, such a supposition</i>. He exhorts the presbyters as being their co-presbyter (1 Pet. v. 1): describes himself as a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: addresses his second Epistle to them that have obtained the like precious faith with ourselves (2 Pet. i. 1): and makes not the slightest allusion to any pre-eminence over the other Apostles.<br><br> So that<b> first</b> here must be understood as signifying the prominence of Peter among the Apostles, as well as his early calling.

They did not however from that time constantly accompany Him, but received a more solemn calling (see Matt. iv. 17–22: Luke v. 1–11)—i the narrative of which Peter is prominent, and so<i> first</i> called as an Apostle, at least of those four.<br><br><b> James (the son) of Zebedee, and John his brother</b>] Partners in the fishing trade with Peter and Andrew, Luke v. 10.
