The view<i> here</i> is, that disciples must<i> not expect a better lot</i> than their Master, but be well satisfied if they have no worse. The threefold relation of our Lord and His followers here brought out may thus be exemplified from Scripture:<i> disciple and teacher</i>, Matt. v. 1; xxiii. 8: Luke vi. 20;<i> servant</i> and<i> lord</i>, John xiii. 13: Luke xii. 35–48: Rom. i. 1: 2 Pet. i. 1: Jude l;<i> master of the house and household</i>, Matt. xxvi. 26–29||: Luke xxiv. 30: Matt. xxiv. 45 ff.||.
