 25.   Βεελζεβούλ ] (Either בַּעַל זֶבֶל , ‘lord of dung,’ or as in 2 Kings 1:2 , בַּעַל זְבוּב , ‘lord of flies,’ a god worshipped at Ekron by the Philistines; there is however another derivation more probable than either of these, upheld by Meyer (referring to Buxtorf, Lex. Talm. p. 333), from בַּעַל and זְבוּל , a house, by which it would exactly correspond to οἰκοδεσπότης ) A name by which the prince of the devils was called by the Jews, ch. Matthew 12:24 , to which accusation, probably an usual one (see ch. Mat 9:34 ), and that in John 8:48 , our Lord probably refers. In those places they had not literally called  Him Beelzebub, but He speaks of their mind and intention in those charges. They may however have literally done so on other unrecorded occasions.
