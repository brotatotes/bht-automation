<b> 25. Beelzebub</b>] (or—bul) (Either ‘lord of dung,’—or, as in 2 Kings i. 2, ‘lord of flies,”—a god worshipped at Ekron by the Philistines; there is however another derivation more probable than either of these, from<i> baal</i>, lord, and<i> zeboul</i>, a house, by which it would exactly correspond to the term used.)—A name by which the prince of the devils was called by the Jews, ch, xii. 24,—to which accusation, probably an usual one (see ch. ix. 34), and that in John viii. 48, our Lord probably refers. In those places they had not literally called<i> Him</i> Beelzebub, but He speaks of their mind and intention in those charges. They may however have literally done so on other unrecorded occasions.
