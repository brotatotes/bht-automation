 26.   μὴ οὖν ] The force of this is: ‘Notwithstanding their treatment of Me your Master, Mine will be victory and triumph; therefore ye, My disciples, in your turn, need not fear.’ Compare Romans 8:37 .
	 οὐδὲν γάρ ἐστιν ] This solemn truth is again and again enounced by our Lord on different occasions, and with different references. See Luke 8:17 ; Luke 12:2 . The former part of the verse drew comfort and encouragement from the  past: this from the  future . ‘All that is hidden must be revealed (1) it is God’s purpose in His Kingdom that the everlasting Gospel shall be freely preached, and this purpose ye serve. (2) Beware then of hypocrisy (see Luk 12:2 ) through fear of men, for all such will be detected and exposed hereafter: and (3) fear them not, for, under whatever aspersions ye may labour from them, the day is coming which shall clear you and condemn them, if ye are fearlessly doing the work of Him that sent you’ (ch. Mat 13:43 ). τίνος γὰρ ἕνεκεν ἀλγεῖτε ; ὅτι γόητας ὑμᾶς καλοῦσι καὶ πλάνους ; ἀναμείνατε μικρόν , καὶ σωτῆρας ὑμᾶς καὶ εὐεργέτας τῆς οἰκουμένης προσεροῦσιν ἅπαντες . Chrys. Hom. xxxiv. 1, p. 390.
