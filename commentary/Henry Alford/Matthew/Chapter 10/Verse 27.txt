<b> 27.</b>]<i> An expansion of the duty of freeness and boldness of speech implied in the last verse</i>. The words may bear<i> two meanings</i>: either (1) that which Chrysostom gives, taking the expressions relatively, of His speaking to them only, and in a little corner of Palestine, as compared with the subsequent publicity of the Word; or (2) as this part of the discourse relates to the<i> future</i> principally, the<i> secret speaking</i> may mean the communication which our Lord would hold with them hereafter by His Spirit, which they were to preach and proclaim. See Acts iv. 20. These senses do not exclude one another, and are possibly both implied.
