<b> 28.</b>] On the<i> latter part</i> of this verse much question has of late been raised, which never was, as far as I have been able to find, known to the older interpreters. Stier designates it as ‘the only passage of Scripture whose words may equally apply to God and the enemy of souls.’ He himself is strongly in favour of the<i> latter</i> interpretation, and defends it at much length; but I am<i> quite unable to assent to his opinion</i>. It seems to me<i> at variance with the connexion of the discourse</i>, and with the<i> universal tone of Scripture regarding Satan</i>. If such a phrase as “<i>to fear the devil</i>” could be instanced as equivalent to “<i>to guard against the devil,</i>” or if it could be shewn that any where power is attributed to Satan analogous to that indicated by “<i>able to destroy both soul and body in hell,</i>” I then should be open to the doubt whether he might not here be intended; but seeing that “<b>fear not,</b>” indicating terror, is changed into “<i>fear</i>” so usually followed by “God” in a higher and holier sense (there is<i> no such contrast</i> in ver. 26, and therefore that verse cannot be cited as ruling the meaning of this), and that GOD ALONE is throughout the Scripture the<i> Almighty dispenser of life and death both temporal and eternal</i>, seeing also that Satan is ever represented as the<i> condemned</i> of God, not one able to destroy, I must hold by the general interpretation, and believe that both here and in Luke xii. 3–7 our Heavenly Father is intended, as the right object of our fear. As to this being inconsistent with the character in which He is brought before us in the next verse, the very change of meaning in “<i>fear</i>” would lead the mind on, out of the terror before spoken of, into that better kind of fear always indicated by that expression when applied to God, and so prepare the way for the next verse. Besides, this sense is excellently in keeping with ver. 29 in another way. ‘Fear Him who is the only Dispenser of Death and Life:<i> of death, as here; of life</i>, as in the case of the sparrows for whom He cares.’ ‘Fear Him, above men: trust Him, in spite of men.’<br><br> In preparing the 2nd edn. of my Greek Test., I carefully reconsidered the whole matter, and went over Stier’s arguments with the connexion of the discourse before me, but found myself more than ever persuaded that it is quite impossible, for the above and every reason, to apply the words to the enemy of souls. The similar passage, James iv. 12, even in the absence of other considerations, would be decisive. Full as his Epistle is of our Lord’s words from this Gospel, it is hardly to be doubted that in “<i>there is one lawgiver</i> [<i>and judge</i>]<i> who is able to save and to destroy,</i>” he has this very verse before him. The depth of this part of the discourse I take to be, the setting before Christ’s messengers their Heavenly Father as the sole object of childlike trust and childlike fear—the former from His love,—the latter from His power,—His<i> power</i> to destroy, it is not said<i> them</i>, but absolute,<i> body and soul</i>, in hell. Here is the true depth of the discourse: but if in the midst of this great subject, our Lord is to be conceived as turning aside, upholding as an object of fear the chief enemy, whose ministers and subordinates He is at the very moment, commanding us<i> not to fear</i>, and speaking of<i> him</i> as<i> he that is able to destroy both soul and body in hell</i>, to my mind all true and deep connexion is broken.
