<b> 3. Philip, and Bartholomew</b>] Philip was called by our Lord the second day after the visit of Andrew and John, and the day after the naming of Peter. He was also of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter, James and John.<br><br> Andrew and Philip are Greek names. See John xii. 20–22.<br><br><b> Bartholomew</b>, i.e. in Heb.,<i> son of Talmai or Tolom</i> æ<i> us</i>, has been generally supposed to be the same with<i> Nathanael of Cana in Galilee</i>; and with reason: for (1) the name Bartholomew is not his own name, but a patronymic:— (2) He follows next in order, as<i> Nathanael</i>, in John i. 46, to the Apostles just mentioned, with the same formula which had just been used of Philip’s own call (ver. 44),— “<i>Philip findeth Nathanael:</i>”— (3) He is there, as here, and in Mark and Luke (Gospel),<i> in connexion with Philip</i> (that he was his<i> brother</i>, was conjectured by Dr. Donaldson; but rendered improbable by the fact that John, in the case of Andrew a few verses above, expressly says “<i>he findeth his own brother Simon,</i>” whereas in ver. 46 no such specification occurs):— (4) in John xxi. 2, at the appearance of our Lord on the shore of the sea of Tiberias, Nathanael is mentioned as present, where seven apostles ( “<i>disciples</i>”) are recounted.<br><br><b> Thomas, and Matthew the Publican</b>] Thomas, in Greek Didymus (the twin). John xi. 16; xx. 24; xxi. 2.<br><br><b> Matthew the publican</b> is clearly by this appellation identified with the Matthew of ch. ix. 9. We hear nothing of him, except in these two passages. Dr. Donaldson believed Matthew and Thomas to have been twin brothers. Eusebins preserves a tradition that Thomas’s real name was Judas.<br><br><b> James (the son) of Alphæus</b>] From John xix. 25, some infer (but see note there), that Mary the (wife) of Clopas was sister of Mary the mother of our Lord. From Mark xv. 40, that Mary was the mother of James “<i>the little,</i>” which may be this James. Hence it would appear, if these two passages point to the same person, that Alphæus = Clopas. And indeed the two Greek names are but different ways of expressing the Hebrew name. If this be so, then this James the Less<i> may possibly be “the brother of the Lord”</i> mentioned Gal. i. 19 apparently as an apostle, and one of “<i>His brethren</i>” mentioned Matt. xiii. 55 (where see note) (?). But on the difficulties attending this view, see note on John vii. 5.<br><br><b> Lebbæus</b>] Much difficulty rests on this name, both from the various readings, and the questions arising from the other lists. The received reading appears to be a conjunction of the two ancient ones, Lebbæus and Thaddæus: the latter of these having been introduced from Mark: where, however, one of the ancient MSS. has<i> Lebbæus</i>. Whichever of these is the true reading, the Apostle himself has generally been supposed to be identical with “<i>Judas of James</i>” in both Luke’s catalogues, i.e. (see note there) Judas the brother (Dr. Donaldson supposed<i> son</i>: see note on Luke xxiv. 13) of James, and so son of Alpheus, and commonly supposed to be (?) one of the brethren of the Lord named Matt. xiii. 55. In John xiv. 22 we have a ‘Judas, not Iscariot,’ among the Apostles: and the catholic epistle is written by a ‘Judas brother of James.’ What in this case the names Lebbæus and Thaddæus are, is impossible to say. So that the whole rests on conjecture; which however does not contradict any known fact, and may be allowed as the only escape from the difficulty.
