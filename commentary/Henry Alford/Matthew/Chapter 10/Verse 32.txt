<p><strong> 32. </strong> <strong> ὁμολ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν ἐμοί</strong> ] A Hebraistic or rather perhaps Syriac mode of expression (De Wette) for, ‘shall make me the object of His acknowledgment among and before men.’ The context shews plainly that it is a practical consistent confession which is meant, and also a practical and enduring denial. The Lord will not confess the confessing Judas, nor deny the denying Peter; the traitor who denied Him in act is denied: the Apostle who confessed Him even to death will be confessed. Cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:12">2 Timothy 2:12</span> . We may observe that both in the Sermon on the Mount (ch. Mat 7:21-23 ) and here, <em> after mention of the Father</em> , our Lord describes <em> Himself</em> as the Judge and Arbiter of eternal life and death.</p>
