<b> 32. confess me</b>] The context shews plainly that it is a practical consistent confession which is meant, and also a practical and enduring denial. The Lord will not confess the confessing Judas, nor deny the denying Peter; the traitor who denied Him in act is denied: the Apostle who confessed Him even to death will be confessed. Cf. 2 Tim. ii. 12. We may observe that both in the Sermon on the Mount (ch. vii. 21â€“23) and here,<i> after mention of the Father</i>, our Lord describes<i> Himself</i> as the Judge and Arbiter of eternal life and death.
