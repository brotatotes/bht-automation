 32.   ὁμολ  .   ἐν ἐμοί ] A Hebraistic or rather perhaps Syriac mode of expression (De Wette) for, ‘shall make me the object of His acknowledgment among and before men.’ The context shews plainly that it is a practical consistent confession which is meant, and also a practical and enduring denial. The Lord will not confess the confessing Judas, nor deny the denying Peter; the traitor who denied Him in act is denied: the Apostle who confessed Him even to death will be confessed. Cf. 2 Timothy 2:12 . We may observe that both in the Sermon on the Mount (ch. Mat 7:21-23 ) and here,  after mention of the Father , our Lord describes  Himself as the Judge and Arbiter of eternal life and death.
