<p><strong> 38.</strong> ] How strange must this prophetic announcement have seemed to the Apostles! It was no Jewish proverb (for crucifixion was not a Jewish punishment), no common saying, which our Lord here and so often utters. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:24">Matthew 16:24</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:21">Mark 10:21</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:23">Luke 9:23</span> . He does not here plainly mention <em> His</em> Cross; but leaves it to be understood, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:25">Matthew 10:25</span> . This is one of those sayings of which Joh 12:16 was eminently true. Neander (Leben Jesu, p. 546, note) quotes from Plutarch, de sera numinis vindicta, c. ix., καὶ τῷ μὲν σώματι τῶν κολαζομένων ἕκαστος κακούργων ἐκφέρει τὸν αὑτοῦ σταυρόν (meaning, as he explains it, a <em> guilty conscience</em> ), as a proof that our Lord used this saying without any conscious reference to His own Death. But he confesses that if the ὑψοῦν of Joh 12:32 is to be understood as there interpreted ( Mat 10:33 ), he should be ready to allow the allusion here also. Seeing then that we do thus understand it, his inference has no value for us. Besides which, the passage of Plutarch does not even prove the expression to have been proverbial.</p>
