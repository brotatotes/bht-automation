<p><strong> 39.</strong> ] <strong> ψυχὴν</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> αὐτήν</strong> refer to the <em> same thing</em> , but in somewhat different senses. The <em> first</em> ψυχή is the <em> life of this world</em> , which we here all count so dear to us; the <em> second</em> , implied in αὐτήν , the <em> real life of man</em> in a blessed eternity.

<p><strong> εὑρών</strong> = φιλῶν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:25">John 12:25</span> = σῶσαι θέλων , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:34">Mark 8:34</span> . The past participles are used proleptically, with reference to that day when the loss and gain shall become apparent. But εὑρών and ἀπολέσας are again somewhat different in position: the first implying <em> earnest desire</em> to save, but not so the second any will or voluntary act to destroy. This is brought out by the ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ , which gives the ruling providential arrangement whereby the ἀπολέσας is brought about. But besides the primary meaning of this saying as regards the laying down of life literally for Christ’s sake, we cannot fail to recognize in it a far deeper sense, in which he who loses his life shall find it. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:23">Luke 9:23</span> , the taking up of the cross is to be καθ ʼ ἡμέραν ; in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:24">Matthew 16:24</span> [118] Mark ἀπαρνησάσθω ἑαυτόν is joined with it. Thus we have the crucifying of the life of this world, the death to sin spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4-11">Romans 6:4-11</span> , and life unto God. And this life unto God is the real, true ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ , which the self-denier shall find, and preserve unto life eternal. See Joh 12:25 and note.
