<b> 39. his life... it</b>] refer to the<i> same thing</i>, but in somewhat different senses. The first “<b>life</b>” is the<i> life of this world</i>, which we here all count so dear to us; the<i> second</i>, implied in “<b>it,</b>”<i> the real life of man</i> in a blessed eternity.<br><br><b> hath found</b> = “<i>loveth.</i>” John xii. 25 = “will save,’ Mark viii. 35. The past participles are used in anticipation, with reference to that day when the loss and gain shall become apparent. But “<b>hath found</b>” and “<b>hath lost</b>” are again somewhat different in position: the first implying<i> earnest desire</i> to save, but not so second any will or voluntary act to destroy. This is brought out by the<b> for my sake</b>, which gives the ruling providential arrangement whereby the<i> losing</i> is brought about. But besides the primary meaning of this saying as regards the laying down of life literally for Christ’s sake, we cannot fail to recognize in it a far deeper sense, in which he who loses his life shall find it. In Luke ix. 23, the taking up of the cross is to be “<i>daily</i>;” in ch. xvi. 24||Mk. “<i>let him deny himself</i>” is joined with it. Thus we have the crucifying of the life of this world,—the death to sin spoken of Rom. vi. 4–11, and life unto God. And this life unto God is the real, true<b> life</b>, which the self-denier shall find, and preserve unto life eternal. See John xii. 25 and note.
