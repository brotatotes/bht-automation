 39. ]  ψυχὴν  …   αὐτήν refer to the  same thing , but in somewhat different senses. The  first ψυχή is the  life of this world , which we here all count so dear to us; the  second , implied in αὐτήν , the  real life of man in a blessed eternity.
	 εὑρών = φιλῶν , John 12:25 = σῶσαι θέλων , Mark 8:34 . The past participles are used proleptically, with reference to that day when the loss and gain shall become apparent. But εὑρών and ἀπολέσας are again somewhat different in position: the first implying  earnest desire to save, but not so the second any will or voluntary act to destroy. This is brought out by the ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ , which gives the ruling providential arrangement whereby the ἀπολέσας is brought about. But besides the primary meaning of this saying as regards the laying down of life literally for Christ’s sake, we cannot fail to recognize in it a far deeper sense, in which he who loses his life shall find it. In Luke 9:23 , the taking up of the cross is to be καθ ʼ ἡμέραν ; in ch. Matthew 16:24 [118] Mark ἀπαρνησάσθω ἑαυτόν is joined with it. Thus we have the crucifying of the life of this world, the death to sin spoken of Romans 6:4-11 , and life unto God. And this life unto God is the real, true ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ , which the self-denier shall find, and preserve unto life eternal. See Joh 12:25 and note.
	 [118] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
