 4.   Σίμων ὁ καναν  . ] This is not a local name, but is derived from קַנִאָן (Hebr. קַנָּא ) = ζηλωτής (Luke, Gosp. and Acts). We may therefore suppose that before his conversion he belonged to the sect of the Zealots, who after the example of Phinehas ( Num 25:7-8 ) took justice into their own hands, and punished offenders against the law. This sect eventually brought upon Jerusalem its destruction.
	 Ἰούδας ὁ ἰσκ  . ] Son of Simon (John 6:71 ; ( Mat 12:4 v. r.) Matthew 13:2 ; Mat 13:26 ). Probably a native of Kerioth in Juda, Joshua 15:25 , אִישׁ קְרִיּוֹת , a man of Kerioth, as ἴστοβος , i.e. אִישׁ טוֹב , a man of Tob, Joseph. Antt. vii. 6. 1. That the name ἴσκ . cannot be a surname, as Bp. Middleton supposes, the expression Ἰούδας Σίμωνος ἰσκαριώτης , used in all the above places of John, clearly proves. Dr. Donaldson assumed it as certain that the Simon last mentioned was the father of Judas Iscariot. But surely this is very uncertain, in the case of so common a name as Simon.
