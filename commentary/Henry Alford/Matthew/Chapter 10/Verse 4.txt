<b> 4. Simon the Canan√¶an</b>] This is not a local name, but is derive from<i> Canan</i>, which is equivalent to Zelotes (Luke, Gospel and Acts). We may therefore suppose that before his conversion he belonged to the sect of the Zealots, who after the example of Phinehas (Num. xxv. 7, 8) took justice into their own hands, and punished offenders against the law. This sect eventually brought upon Jerusalem its destruction.
