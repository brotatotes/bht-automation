We may therefore suppose that before his conversion he belonged to the sect of the Zealots, who after the example of Phinehas (Num. xxv. 7, 8) took justice into their own hands, and punished offenders against the law. This sect eventually brought upon Jerusalem its destruction.<br><br><b> Judas Iscariot</b>] Son of Simon (John vi. 71; [xii. 4 various reading;] xiii. 2, 26). Probably a native of Kerioth in Juda, Josh. xv. 25.<i> Ish Kerioth</i>, a man of Kerioth, as<i> Istobus</i>, a man of Tob, Joseph. Antt. vii. 6. 1. That the name Iscariot cannot be a surname, as Bp. Middleton supposes, the expression “<i>Judas Iscariot the son of Simon,</i>” used in all the above places of John, clearly proves. Dr. Donaldson assumed it as certain that the Simon last mentioned was the father of Judas Iscariot. But surely this is very uncertain, in the case of so common a name as Simon.
