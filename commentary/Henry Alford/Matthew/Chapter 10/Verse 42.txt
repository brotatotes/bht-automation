 42.   τῶν μικρῶν ] To whom this applies is not very clear. Hardly (De Wette) to the despised and meanly-esteemed for Christ’s sake. I should rather imagine some  children may have been  present; for of such does our Lord generally use this term, see ch. Matthew 18:2-6 . Though perhaps the expression may be meant of lower and less advanced converts, thus keeping up the gradation from προφήτης . This however hardly seems likely: for how could a disciple be in a downward gradation from δίκαιος ?
	I may observe that Meyer denies the existence of the Rabbinical meaning of  disciples commonly attributed to קטנים , little ones. In the passage from Bereschith Rabba quoted by Wetstein to support it, the word, he maintains, from the context, means  parvuli, children , not  disciples .
	 τὸν μισθ  .   αὐτ  . ]  His (i.e. the doer’s)  reward: not, ‘the reward of  one of these little ones ,’ as before μισθ . προφ ., μισθ . δικαίου : the article here makes the difference: and the expression is reflective.
