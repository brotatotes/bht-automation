<b> 42. these little ones</b>] To whom this applies is not very clear. Hardly, as some think, to the despised and meanly-esteemed for Christ’s sake. I should rather imagine some<i> children</i> may have been<i> present</i>: for of such does our Lord elsewhere use this term, see ch. xviii. 2–6. Though perhaps the expression may be meant of lower and less advanced converts, thus keeping up the gradation from the<i> prophet</i>. This however hardly seems likely: for how could a disciple be in a downward gradation from<i> a righteous man</i>?
