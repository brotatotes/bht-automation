<p><strong> 42. </strong> <strong> τῶν μικρῶν</strong> ] To whom this applies is not very clear. Hardly (De Wette) to the despised and meanly-esteemed for Christ’s sake. I should rather imagine some <em> children</em> may have been <em> present;</em> for of such does our Lord generally use this term, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:2-6">Matthew 18:2-6</span> . Though perhaps the expression may be meant of lower and less advanced converts, thus keeping up the gradation from προφήτης . This however hardly seems likely: for how could a disciple be in a downward gradation from δίκαιος ?

<p>I may observe that Meyer denies the existence of the Rabbinical meaning of <em> disciples</em> commonly attributed to קטנים , little ones. In the passage from Bereschith Rabba quoted by Wetstein to support it, the word, he maintains, from the context, means <em> parvuli, children</em> , not <em> disciples</em> .

<p><strong> τὸν μισθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> His</strong> (i.e. the doer’s) <strong> reward:</strong> not, ‘the reward of <em> one of these little ones</em> ,’ as before μισθ . προφ ., μισθ . δικαίου : the article here makes the difference: and the expression is reflective.</p>
