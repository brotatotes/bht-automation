<b> 5. saying</b>] If we compare this verse with ch. xi. 1, there can be little doubt that this discourse of our Lord was<i> delivered at one time</i> and that, the<i> first sending of the Twelve</i>. How often its solemn injunctions may have been repeated on similar occasions we cannot say: many of them reappear at the sending of the Seventy in Luke x. 2 ff.<br><br> Its primary reference is to the<i> then mission of the Apostles to prepare His way</i>; but it includes, in the germ instructions prophetically delivered for the ministers and missionaries of the Gospel<i> to the end of time</i>. It may be divided into THREE GREAT PORTIONS, in each of which different departments of the subject are treated, but which follow in natural sequence on one another. In the FIRST of these (vv. 5–15), our Lord, taking up the position of the messengers whom He sends from the declaration with which the Baptist and He Himself began their ministry,<i> “The Kingdom of heaven is at hand,</i>” gives them commands,<i> mostly literal, and of present import, for their mission to the cities of Israel</i>. This portion concludes with a denunciation of judgment against that unbelief which should reject their preaching. The SECOND (vv. 16–23) refers to the general mission of the Apostles as<i> developing itself, after the Lord should be taken from them, in preaching to Jews and Gentiles</i> (vv. 17, 18), and subjecting them to persecutions (vv. 21, 22). This portion ends with the end of the apostolic period properly so called, ver. 23 referring primarily to the destruction of Jerusalem. In this portion there is a foreshadowing of what shall be the lot and duty of the teachers of the Gospel to the end, inasmuch as the ‘coming of the Son of Man’ is ever typical of His final coming to judgment. Still the direct reference is to the Apostles and their mission, and the other only by inference. The THIRD (vv. 24–42), the longest and weightiest portion, is spoken<i> directly</i> (with occasional reference only to the Apostles and their mission [ver. 40])<i> of all disciples of the Lord</i>,—their position,—their encouragements,—their duties,—and finally concludes with the last great reward (ver. 42).<br><br> In these first verses, 5, 6,—we have the<i> location</i>; in 7, 8, the<i> purpose</i>; in 9, 10, the<i> fitting out</i>; and in 11–14, the<i> manner of proceeding</i>,—of their mission: ver. 15 concluding with a prophetic denouncement, tending to impress them with a deep sense of the importance of the office entrusted to them.<br><br><b> Samaritans</b>] The Samaritans were the Gentile inhabitants of the country between Judæa and Galilee, consisting of heathens whom Shalmaneser king of Assyria brought from Babylon and other places. Their religion was a mixture of the worship of the true God with idolatry (2 Kings xvii. 24–41). The Jews had no dealings with them, John iv. 9. They appear to have been not so unready as the Jews to receive our Lord and His mission (John iv. 39–42: Luke ix. 51 ff., and notes);—but<i> this</i> prohibition rested on judicial reasons. See Acts xiii. 46. In Acts i. 8 the prohibition is expressly taken off: ‘Ye shall be witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judæa, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost of the earth.’ And in Acts viii. 1, 5, 8, we find the result. See ch. xv. 21–28.
