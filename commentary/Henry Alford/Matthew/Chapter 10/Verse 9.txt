<b> 9. Provide neither...</b>] All the words following depend on this verb, and it is explained by the parallel expressions in Mark and Luke. They were to make no preparations for the journey, but to take it in dependence on Him who sent them, just as they were. This forbidden provision would be of three kinds (1)<i> Money</i>: in Mark (vi. 8) (literally) “<i>brass,</i>” in Luke (ix. 3) “<i>silver:</i>” here all the three current in order of value, connected by the<b> nor</b>, introducing a climax—no gold, nor yet silver, nor yet brass—in their girdles (so, literally, Luke x. 4). In the Greek it is, ‘no gold, nor even silver, nor even brass.’ So again in ver. 10. (2)<i> Food</i>: here<b> scrip</b>, in Mark “<i>no scrip, no bread:</i>” similarly Luke. (3) Clothing—<b>neither two coats:</b> so Mark and Luke.—<b>neither shoes;</b> in Mark expressed by “<i>be shod with san, dals:</i>” explained in Luke x. 4 by “<i>carry no shoes,</i>” i.e. a<i> second</i> pair.—<b>nor yet a</b><b> staff</b> = “<i>save a staff only</i>” Mark. They were not to procure<i> expressly for this journey</i> even a staff: they were to take with them their usual staff only. The missing of this explanation has probably led to the reading<i> staves</i> both here and in Luke. If it be genuine, it does not mean<i> two staves</i>; for who would ever think of taking a<i> spare</i> staff? but a<i> staff</i> each. The whole of this prohibition was temporary only; for their then journey, and no more. See Luke xxii. 35, 36.
