 9.   μὴ κτήσησθε ] All the words following depend on this verb, and it is explained by the parallel expressions in Mark and Luke, ἵνα μηδὲν αἴρωσιν and μηδὲν αἴρετε εἰς τὴν ὁδόν . They were to make no preparations for the journey, but to take it in dependence on Him who sent them, just as they were. This forbidden provision would be of three kinds (1)  Money: in Mark ( Mar 6:8 ) χαλκόν , in Luke ( Luk 9:3 ) ἀργύριον : here all the three current metals in order of value, connected by the μηδέ introducing a climax no gold, nor yet silver, nor yet brass (so again in Mat 10:10 ) in their ζῶναι (= βαλάντια Luk 10:4 ). (2)  Food: here  πήρα ( θήκη τῶν ἄρτων , Suidas), in Mark μὴ ἄρτον , μὴ πήραν : similarly Luke. (3) Clothing  μηδὲ δύο χιτ  .: so Mark and Luke  μηδὲ ὑποδ  .; in Mark expressed by ὑποδεδεμένους σανδάλια : explained in Luke 10:4 , by μὴ βαστάζετε ὑποδ ., i.e. a  second pair.  μηδὲ ῥάβδον = εἰ μὴ ῥάβδ . μόνον Mark, i.e., the former depending on κτήσησθε , the latter on αἴρωσιν εἰς ὁδόν , which has not quite the precision of the other. They were not to procure  expressly for this journey even a staff: they were to take with them their usual staff only. The missing of this explanation has probably led to the reading ῥάβδους both here and in Luke. If it be genuine, it does not mean δύο ῥάβδ .; for who would ever think of taking a  spare staff? but a ῥάβδος each. The whole of this prohibition was temporary only; for their then journey, and no more. See Luke 22:35-36 .
