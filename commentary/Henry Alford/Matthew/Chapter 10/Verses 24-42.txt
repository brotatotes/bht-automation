 24 42. ] THIRD PART OF THE DISCOURSE. See note on Matthew 10:5 . It treats of (I.) the  conflicts ( Mat 10:24-26 ),  duties ( Mat 10:26-28 ), and  encouragements ( Mat 10:28-32 ) of all Christ’s disciples. (II.) The  certain issue of this fight in victory; the  confession by Christ of those who confess Him , set in strong light by the contrast of those who deny Him ( Mat 10:32-33 ); the  necessity of conflict to victory , by the nature of Christ’s mission ( Mat 10:34-37 ), the  kind of self-devotion which he requires ( Mat 10:37-39 ): concluding with the  solemn assurance that no reception of His messengers for His sake, nor even the smallest labour of love for Him, shall pass without its final reward . Thus we are carried on to the end of time and of the course of the Church.
