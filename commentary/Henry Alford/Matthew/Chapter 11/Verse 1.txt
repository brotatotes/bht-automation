Mat 10:1  to Matthew 11:1  .] MISSION OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES. Mark 6:7-13 ; Luke 9:1-6 , for the  sending out of the Apostles: Mark 3:13-19 ; Luke 6:13-16 , for their  names . On the characteristic differences between this discourse and that delivered to the Seventy (Luke 10:1 ff.) see notes there.
	Notice, that this is not the  choosing , but merely the  mission of the twelve. The choosing had taken place some time before, but is not any where distinctly detailed by the Evangelists.
