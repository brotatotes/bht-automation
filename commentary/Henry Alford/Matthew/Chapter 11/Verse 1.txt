<b> XI. 1. thence</b>] No fixed locality is assigned to the foregoing discourse. It was not delivered at Capernaum, but<i> on a journey</i>, see ch. ix. 35,<br><br><b> their</b><i> cities</i> is also indeterminate, as in ch. iv. 23; ix. 35.<br><br> The idea of his objective faith being shaken by his imprisonment is quite inconsistent not only with John’s character, but with our Lord’s discourse in this place, whose description of him seems almost framed to guard against such a supposition.<br><br> The last hypothesis above mentioned is hardly probable, in the form in which it is put. We can scarcely imagine that John can have doubted who this Person was, or have been confounded by the discordant rumours which reached him about His wonderful works. But that<i> one form</i> of this hypothesis is the right one, I am certainly disposed to believe, until some more convincing considerations shall induce me to alter my view. (4) The form to which I allude is this: John having heard all these reports, being himself fully convinced Who this Wonderworker was, was becoming impatient under the slow and unostentatious course of our Lord’s self-manifestation, and desired to obtain from our Lord’s own mouth a declaration which should set such rumours at rest, and (possibly) which mighht serve for a public profession of His Messiahship, from which hitherto He had seemed to shrink. He thus incurs a share of the same rebuke which the mother of our Lord received (John ii. 4); and the purport of the answer returned to him is, that the hour was not yet come for such an open declaration, but that there were sufficient proofs given by the works done, to render all inexcusable, who should be offended in Him. And the return message is so far from being a satisfaction designed for the<i> disciples</i>, that they are sent back like the messenger from Gabii to Sextus Tarquinius, with indeed a significant narrative to relate, but no direct answer; they were but the intermediate transmitters of the symbolic message, known to Him who sent it, and him who received it.<br><br> It is a fact not to be neglected in connexion with this solution of the difficulty, that John is said to have heard of the works, not<i> of Jesus</i>, but<b> of (the) Christ</b>: the only place where that name, standing alone, is given to our Lord in this Gospel. So that it would seem as if the Evangelist had purposely avoided saying<i> of Jesus</i> to shew that the works were reported to John not as those of the Person whom he had known as Jesus, but of the Deliverer—the Christ; and that he was thus led to desire a distinct avowal of the identity of the two. I have before said that the opening part of the ensuing discourse seems to have been designed to prevent, in the minds of the multitude, any such unworthy estimations of John as those above cited. The message and the answer might well beget such suspicions, and could not from the nature of the case be explained to them in that deeper meaning which they really bore; but the character of John here given would effectually prevent them, after hearing it, from entertaining any such idea.
