<b> 10. thy</b>] Our Lord here changes the person of the original prophecy, which is<i> my</i>. And that He does so, making that which is said by Jehovah of Himself, to be addressed to the Messiah, is, if such were needed (compare also Luke i. 16, 17, and 76), no mean indication of His own eternal and co-equal God-head. It is worthy of remark that all three Evangelists quote this prophecy<i> similarly changed</i>, although St. Mark has it in an entirely different place. Also, that the high dignity and honor, which our Lord here predicates of the Baptist, has a further reference: He was thus great above all others,<i> because he was the forerunner of Christ</i>. How great then above all others and him, must HE be.
