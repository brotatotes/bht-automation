 10.   σου ] Our Lord here changes the person of the original prophecy, which is μου . And that He does so, making that which is said by Jehovah of Himself, to be addressed to the Messiah, is, if such were needed (compare also Luke 1:16-17 ; Luk 1:76 ), no mean indication of His own eternal and co-equal Godhead. It is worthy of remark that all three Evangelists quote this prophecy  similarly changed , although St. Mark has it in an entirely different place. The student should compare the passage in the LXX with the three citations, h. l., Mark 1:2 , and Luke 7:27 . Also, that the high dignity and honour which our Lord here predicates of the Baptist, has a further reference: He was thus great above all others,  because he was the forerunner of Christ . How great then above all others and him, must HE be.
