<b> 11. hath... risen</b>] Not merely a word of course, but especially used of prophets and judges, see reff., and once of our Saviour Himself, Acts v. 30.<br><br><b> he that is least</b>] This has been variously rendered and understood. Chrysostom and other ancient interpreters, put the pause after “<i>least,</i>” and take the words “<i>in the Kingdom of heaven</i>” with what follows: understanding “<i>he that is least</i>” of our Lord. But such an interpretation is surely adverse to the spirit of the whole discourse. We may certainly say that our Lord in such a passage as this would not designate Himself as “<i>he that is least</i>” compared with John, in any sense: nor again is it our Lord’s practice to speak of Himself as one<i> in the Kingdom of heaven</i>, or of His own attributes as belonging to or dependent on that new order of things which this expression implies, and which was<i> in Him</i> rather than He in it. Again, the analogy of such passages as Matt. v. 19; xviii. 1, would lead us to connect the preceding adjective<i> least</i> with<i> in the Kingdom of heaven</i>, and not the following. The other, the usual interpretation, I am convinced, is the right one:<b> but he that is least in the of heaven, is greater than he</b>.<br><br> There is very likely an allusion to Zech. xii. 8: “He that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David.”<br><br> Thus the parallelism is complete:<i> John</i>, not inferior to any born of women—but<i> these, even the least of them</i>, are born of<i> another birth</i> (John i. 12, 13; iii. 5).<i> John</i>, the nearest to the King and the Kingdom—<i>standing on the threshold</i>—but<i> never having himself entered; these,</i> “<i>in the Kingdom,</i>” subjects and citizens and indwellers of the realm,<i> whose citizenship is in heaven</i>. He, the<i> friend of the Bridegroom:</i> they, however weak and unworthy members,<i> His Body, and His Spouse</i>.
