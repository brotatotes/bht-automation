<b> 12.</b>] The sense of this verse has been much disputed. (1) the verb rendered “<i>suffereth violence</i>” has been taken in a<i> middle sense</i>; ‘<i>forcibly introduces itself, breaks in with violence,</i>’ as in the similar passage Luke xvi. 16. Certainly such a sense agrees better with “<i>is preached</i>” which we find in Luke, than the passive explanation: but it seems inconsistent with the latter half of the verse to say that<i> it breaks in by force</i>, and then that<i> others break by force into it</i>. (2) the verb is taken<i> passively</i>; ‘<b>suffereth violence.</b>’ And thus the construction of the verse is consistent: ‘and the violent take it by force.’ Believing this latter interpretation to be right, we now come to the question,<i> in what sense are these words spoken?</i> Is the verb in a good or a bad sense? Does it mean, ‘<i>is taken by force,</i>’ and the following, ‘<i>and men violently press in for their share of it, as for plunder;</i>’—or does it mean, ‘<i>is violently resisted, and violent men tear it to pieces?</i>’ (viz. its opponents, the Scribes and Pharisees?) This latter meaning bears no sense as connected with the discourse before us. The subject is not the<i> resistance made</i> to the kingdom of heaven, but<i> the difference between a prophesied and a present</i> kingdom of heaven. The fifteenth verse closes this subject, and the complaints of the arbitrary prejudices of ‘this generation’ begin with ver. 16. We conclude then that these words imply<b> From the days of John the Baptist un!now</b> (i. e. inclusively, from the beginning of his preaching),<b> the kingdom of heaven is pressed into, and violent persons—</b>eager, ardent multitudes<b>—seize on it.</b> Of the truth of this, notwithstanding our Lord’s subsequent reproaches for unbelief, we have abundant proof from the multitudes who follow and outwent Him, and thronged the doors where He was, and would (John vi. 15) take Him by force to make Him a king. But our Lord does not mention this so much to commend the<i> violent persons</i>, as to shew the undoubted fact<i> that He that should come was come</i>:—that the kingdom of heaven, which before had been the subject of distant prophecy, a closed fortress, a treasure hid, was now<i> undoubtedly upon earth</i> (Luke xvii. 21 and note), laid open to the entrance of men, spread out that all might take. Thus this verse connects with ver. 28, “<i>Come unto Me all,</i>” and with Luke xvi. 16, “<i>every man presseth into it.</i>” Compare also with this throwing open of the kingdom of heaven for all to press into, the stern prohibition in Exod. xix. 12, 13, and the comment on it in Heb. xii. 18–24.
