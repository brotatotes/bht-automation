	 ὁμοία ἐστὶν παιδίοις  : as children in their games imitate the business and realities of life, so these in the great realities now before them shew all the waywardness of children. The similitude is to two bodies of children, the one inviting the other to play, first at the imitation of a wedding, secondly at that of a funeral; to neither of which will the others respond. Stier remarks that the great condescension of the preaching of the Gospel is shewn forth in this parable, where the man sent from God, and the eternal Word Himself, are represented as children among children, speaking the language of their sports. Compare Hebrews 2:14 . It must not be supposed that the two bodies of children are two divisions of the Jews, as some (e.g. Olsh.) have done: the children who  call are the  Jews , those  called to , the  two Preachers; both belonging, according to the flesh, to ἡ γενεὰ αὕτη , but neither of them corresponding to the kind of  mourning (in John’s case) with which the Jews would have them mourn, or the kind of  joy (in the Lord’s case) with which the Jews would have them rejoice. The converse application, which is commonly made, is against the  ὁμοία ἐστὶν  παιδίοις , by which the first παιδία must be the  children of this generation; and nothing can be more perplexed than to render ὁμοία ἐστίν ‘  may be illustrated by ,’ and invert the persons in the parable. Besides which, this interpretation would lay the waywardness to the charge of the  Preachers , not to that of the Jews.
