<b> 16. But</b>] Implying ‘the men of this generation have ears, and hear not; will not receive this saying: are arbitrary, childish, and prejudiced, not knowing their own mind.’<br><br><b> whereunto shall I liken</b>] See similar questions in Mark iv. 30: Luke xiii. 18, 20; and note on ch. vii. 24.<br><br><b> like unto children</b>: as children in their games imitate the business and realities of life, so these in the great realities now before them shew all the waywardness of children. The similitude is to two bodies of children, the one inviting the other to play, first at the imitation of a wedding, secondly at that of a funeral;—to neither of which will the others respond. Stier remarks that the great condescension of the preaching of the Gospel is shewn forth in this parable, where the man sent from God, and the eternal Word Himself, are represented as children among children, speaking the language of their sports. Compare Heb. ii. 14. It must not be supposed that the two bodies of children are two divisions of the Jews, as some (e. g. Olsh.) have done: the children who<i> call</i> are the<i> Jews</i>,—those<i> called to</i>, the<i> two Preachers</i>; both belonging, according to the flesh, to<b> this generation</b>,—but neither of them corresponding to the kind of<i> mourning</i> (in John’s case) with which the Jews would have them mourn, or the kind of<i> joy</i> (in the Lord’s case) with which the Jews would have them rejoice. The converse application, which is commonly made, is against the<b> is like unto children</b>, by which the first<i> children</i> must be the<i> children of this generation</i>; and nothing can be more perplexed than to understand<i> is like unto</i> as meaning ‘<i>may be illustrated by,</i>’ and invert the persons in the parable. Besides which, this interpretation would lay the waywardness to the charge of the<i> Preachers</i>, not to that of the Jews.
