<b> 20. Then began he</b>] This expression betokens a change of subject, but not of locality or time. The whole chapter stands in such close connexion, one part arising out of another (e. g. this out of ver. 16–19), and all pervaded by the same great undertone, which sounds forth in vv. 28–30, that it is quite impossible that this should be a collection of our Lord’s sayings uttered at different times. I would rather regard the<b> then began he</b> as a token of the report of an ear-witness, and as pointing to a pause or change of manner on the part of our Lord. See note on Luke x. 13.
