It is nowhere mentioned except here and in the similar place of Luke.<br><br><b> Bethsaida</b>] Called a<i> city</i>, John i. 45,—a<i> village</i> (literally), Mark viii. 23,—<i>in Galilee</i>, John xii. 21:—<i>on the western bank of the lake of Gennesaret, near the middle, not far from Capernaum</i>; the birth-place of Simon Peter, Andrew, and Philip. Both this and Chorazin appear to be put as examples of the lesser towns in which our Lord had wrought his miracles (the<i> towns</i>, literally,<i> village-towns</i>, of Mark i. 38), as distinguished from Capernaum, the chief town (ver. 23) of the neighbourhood.<br><br><b> Tyre and Sidon</b>] These wealthy cities, so often the subject of prophecy, had been chastised by God’s judgment under Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander, but still existed (Acts xii. 20; xxi. 3, 7; xxvii. 3).<b> repented... in sackcloth and ashes</b> is probably an allusion to Jonah iii. 6, or to general Eastern custom.
