 21.   Χοραζείν ] According to Jerome (cited by Winer, Realwörterbuch)  a town of Galilee, two (according to Eusebius  twelve , but most likely an error in the transcription)  miles from Capernaum . It is no where mentioned except here and in the similar place of Luke. The etymology is uncertain. Some would read χώρα ζίν .
	 Βηθσαϊδάν ] Called πόλις John 1:45 , κώμη Mark 8:23 ,  in Galilee John 12:21 ;  on the western bank of the lake of Gennesaret, near the middle, not far from Capernaum; the birth-place of Simon Peter, Andrew, and Philip. Both this and Chorazin appear to be put as examples of the lesser towns in which our Lord had wrought His miracles (the κωμοπόλεις of Mar 1:38 ), as distinguished from Capernaum, the chief town ( Mat 11:23 ) of the neighbourhood.
	 Τύρῳ κ  .   Σιδῶνι ] These wealthy cities, so often the subject of prophecy, had been chastised by God’s judgment under Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander, but still existed (Acts 12:20 ; Acts 21:3 ; Acts 21:7 ; Act 27:3 ).
	 ἐν σάκ  .   κ  .   σποδῷ μετ  . is probably an allusion to Jonah 3:6 , or to general Eastern custom.
