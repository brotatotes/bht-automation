 23. ] The sense has been variously interpreted. Some suppose it to allude to the  distinguished honour conferred on Capernaum by our Lord’s residence there. So Euthymius: ἡ Καπερναοὺμ ἔνδοξος γέγονε διὰ τὸ κατοικεῖν ἐν αὐτῇ τὸν χριστὸν καὶ τὰ πολλὰ τῶν θαυμάτων ἐν αὐτῇ τελέσαι . Others (as Grotius) to the  rich fisheries carried on at Capernaum, by means of which the town was proud and prosperous. Jerome says, ‘Ideo ad inferna descendes, quia contra prædicationem meam superbissime restitisti.’ He also mentions the first interpretation. Others, as Stier (Reden Jesu, i. 491), refer the expression to the  lofty situation of Capernaum, which however is very uncertain. The first interpretation appears to me the most probable, seeing that our Lord chose that place to be the principal scene of His ministry and residence, ἡ ἰδία πόλις ch. Matthew 9:1 . The very sites of these three places are now matter of dispute among travellers. See Robinson, vol. iii. pp. 283 300. Dr. Thomson, “The Land and the Book,” p. 359, was sure he found Chorazin in the ruins bearing the name Khorazy, lying in a side valley of the Wady Nashif, which runs down to the lake on the East of Tell Hûm (Capernaum). And this, in spite of Dr. Robinson’s rejection of the identification.
	 ἐν Σοδόμοις ] The comparison between sinful Israel and Sodom is common in the O.T. See Deuteronomy 32:32 ; Isaiah 1:10 ; Lamentations 4:6 ; Ezekiel 16:46-57 .
	 ἔμεινεν ἄν ] This declaration of the Lord of all events, opens to us an important truth, that the destruction of Sodom was brought about, not by a necessity in the divine purposes still less by a connexion of natural causes but by the iniquity of its inhabitants, who, had they turned and repented, might have averted their doom. The same is strikingly set before us in the history of Jonah’s preaching at Nineveh.
