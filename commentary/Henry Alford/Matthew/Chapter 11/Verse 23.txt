<b> 23.</b>] The sense has been variously interpreted. Some suppose it to allude to the<i> distinguished honour conferred on</i> Capernaum by our Lord’s residence there. Others to the<i> rich fisheries carried on at</i> Capernaum, by means of which the town was proud and prosperous. Others refer the expression to the<i> lofty situation of</i> Capernaum, which however is very uncertain. The first interpretation appears to me the most probable, seeing that our Lord chose that place to be the principal scene of His ministry and residence, “<i>his own city,</i>” ch. ix. 1. The very sites of these three places are now matter of dispute among travellers. See Robinson, vol. iii, pp. 283–300. Dr. Thomson, “The Land and the Book,” p. 359, was sure he found Chorazin in the ruins bearing the name Khorazy, lying in a side valley of the Wady Nashif, which runs down to the lake on the East of Tell Hûm (Capernaum). And this, in spite of Dr. Robinson’s rejection of the identification.
