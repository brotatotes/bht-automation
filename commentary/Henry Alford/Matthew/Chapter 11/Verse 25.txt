<b> 25.</b>] This is certainly a continuation of the foregoing discourse; and the<b> answered</b>, which seems to have nothing to refer to, does in reality refer to the words which have immediately preceded. The<b> at that time</b> is not<i> chronological</i>, but gives additional solemnity to what follows. There may have been a slight break in the discourse; the older interpreters, and others, insert the return of the Apostles: but I do not see any necessity for it. The whole ascription of praise is an<i> answer</i>: an answer to the mysterious dispensations of God’s Providence above recounted. With regard to the arrangement in Luke, see note on Luke x. 21.<br><br><b> I thank thee</b>] Not merely, ‘<i>I praise Thee,</i>’ but in the force of the Greek word,<b> I confess to Thee</b>, ‘<i>I recognize the justice of Thy doings;</i>’ viz. in the words<b> Even so, Father</b>, &c. Stier remarks that this is the<i> first public mention</i> by our Lord of His Father; the words in ch. x. 32, 33 having been addressed to the twelve (but see John ii. 16). We have two more instances of such a public address to His Father, John xi. 41; xii, 28; and again Luke xxiii. 34. It is to be observed that He does not address the Father as<i> His</i> Lord, but as Lord<i> of heaven and earth</i>: as<i> He who worketh all thinge after the counsel of His will</i>, Eph. i. 11.<br><br><b> hast hid.... hast revealed</b>] more properly,<b> didst hide</b>, and<b> didst reveal</b>, in the deeper and spiritual sense of the words; the time pointed at being that in the far past, when the divine decrees as to such hiding and revealing were purposed. See 1 Cor. ii. 9–12.<br><br><b> these things</b>,<i> these mysterious arrangements</i>, by which the sinner is condemned in his pride and unbelief, the humble and childlike saved, and God justified when He saves and condemns. These are ‘<i>revealed</i>’ to those who can in a simple and teachable spirit, as<i> babes</i>, obey the invitation in vv. 28–30, but ‘<i>hidden</i>’ from the wise and clever of this world, who attempt their solution by the inadequate instrumentality of the mere human understanding. See 1 Cor. i, 26–31.
