<b> 27.</b>] In one other place only in the three first Gospel (besides the similar passage, Luke x. 22) does the expression<b> the Son</b> occur; viz. Mark xiii. 32. The spirit of this verse, and its form of expression, are quite those of the Gospel of John; and it serves to form a link of union between the three synoptic Gospels and the fourth, and to point to the vast and weighty mass of discourses of the Lord which are not related except by John. We may also observe another point of union:—<i>this very truth</i> (John iii. 35) had been part of the testimony<i> borne to Jesus by the Baptist</i>—and its repetition here, in a discourse of which the character and office of the Baptist is the suggestive groundwork, is a coincidence not surely without meaning. The verse itself is in the closest connexion with the preceding and following, and is best to be understood in that connexion:<b> all things were delivered to me</b> answers to “<i>thou hast revealed</i>” in ver. 25 (on the tenses, see note above, ver. 25), only “<i>revealed</i>” could not be used of the Eternal Son, for He is Himself the Revealer;—<b>no man</b> (no one)<b> knoweth the Son....</b>, none but the Almighty Father has full entire possession of the mystery of the Person and Office of the Son: it is a depth hidden from all being but His, Whose Purposes are evolved in and by it:<b> neither... the Father...</b> nor does any fully apprehend, in the depths of his being, the love and grace of the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son, by the Eternal Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, will reveal Him. Then in close connexion with the<b> to whomsoever the Son will</b>, which by itself might seem to bring in an arbitrariness into the divine counsel, follows, by the Eternal Son Himself, the<b> Come unto me, all...,</b> the wonderful and merciful generalization of the call to wisdom unto salvation.
