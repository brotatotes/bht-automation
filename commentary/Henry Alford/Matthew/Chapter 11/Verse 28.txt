 28. ] This is the great and final answer to the question σὺ εἶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος , ἢ ἕτερον προσδοκῶμεν ; …  δεῦτε πρός με πάντες . As before, we may observe the closest connexion between this and the preceding. As the Son is  the great Revealer , and as the ᾧ ἐὰν βούληται is by His grace extended to  all the weary all who feel their need so He here  invites them to receive this revelation , μάθετε ἀπ ʼ ἐμοῦ . But the way to this heavenly wisdom is by quietness and confidence, rest unto the soul, the reception of the divine grace for the pardon of sin, and the breaking of the yoke of the corruption of our nature. No  mere man could have spoken these words. They are parallel with the command in Isaiah 45:22 , which is spoken by Jehovah Himself.
	 κοπιῶντες καὶ πεφορτισμένοι  , the active and passive sides of human misery, the  labouring and the  burdened , are invited. Doubtless, outward and bodily misery is not shut out; but the promise,  ἀνάπαυσις ταῖς ψυχαῖς  , is only a spiritual promise. Our Lord does not promise to those who come to Him  freedom from toil or burden, but  rest in the soul , which shall make all yokes easy, and all burdens light. The main invitation however is to those burdened with the yoke of sin, and of the law, which was added because of sin. All who feel that burden are invited.
