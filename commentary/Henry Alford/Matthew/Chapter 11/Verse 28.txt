<b> 28.</b>] This is the great and final answer to the question,<i> Art thou He that should come, or do we look for another</i>? As before, we may observe the closest connexion between this and the preceding. As the Son is<i> the great Revealer</i>, and as the<i> to whomsoever He will</i> is by His grace extended to<i> all the weary</i>—all who feel their need—so He here<i> invites them to receive this revelation</i>,<b> learn of Me</b>. But the way to this heavenly wisdom is by quietness and confidence, rest unto the soul, the reception of the divine grace for the pardon of sin, and the breaking of the yoke of the corruption of our nature.<br><br> No<i> mere man</i> could have spoken these words. They are parallel with the command in Isa. xlv. 22, which is spoken by Jehovah Himself.<br><br><b> labour are heavy laden</b>] the active and passive sides of human misery, the<i> labouring</i> and the<i> burdened</i>, are invited. Doubtless, outward and bodily misery is not shut out; but the promise,<b> rest to your souls</b>, is only a spiritual promise. Our Lord does not promise to those who come to Him<i> freedom from</i> toil or burden, but<i> rest in the soul</i>, which shall make all yokes easy, and all burdens light. The main invitation however is to those burdened with the yoke of sin, and of the law, which was added because of sin. All who feel that burden are invited.
