 29. ]  μάθετε ἀπ  ʼ   ἐμοῦ  , both ‘  from My example ,’ which however is the lower sense of the words, and ‘  from My teaching ,’ from which alone the ἀνάπαυσις can flow; the ἀποκάλυψις of Matthew 11:25 ; Matthew 11:27 .
	 εὑρήσετε ἀνάπ  .   τ  .   ψ  .   ὑμ  . quoted from Jer 6:16 Heb. Thus we have it revealed here, that the rest and joy of the Christian soul is,  to become like Christ; to attain by His teaching this πραότης and ταπεινότης of His.
	Olshausen makes an excellent distinction between ταπεινὸς τῇ καρδίᾳ , an attribute of divine Love in the Saviour, and ταπεινὸς or πτωχὸς τῷ πνεύματι , ch. Matthew 5:3 : Proverbs 29:23 , which can only be said of sinful man, knowing his unworthiness and need of help.
	 καρδία is  only here used of Christ. (Stier on John 14:1 .)
