<b> 30.</b>]<b> easy</b>, ‘not exacting;’ answering to ‘<i>kind,</i>’ spoken of persons, Luke vi. 35. See 1 John v. 3. Owing to the conflict with evil ever incident to our corrupt nature even under grace, the<i> rest</i> which Christ gives is yet to be viewed as a yoke and a burden, seen on this its painful side, of conflict and sorrow: but it is a<i> light yoke</i>; the inner rest in the soul giving a peace which passeth understanding, and bearing it up against all. See 2 Cor. iv. 16.
