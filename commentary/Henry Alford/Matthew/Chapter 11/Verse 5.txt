<b> 5.</b>] The words<b> the dead are raised up</b> have occasioned some difficulty; but surely without reason. In Luke, the raising of the widow’s son at Nain immediately precedes this message; and in this Gospel we have had the ruler’s daughter raised. These miracles might be referred to by our Lord under the words<b> the dead are raised up</b>; for it is to be observed that He bade them tell John not only what things they saw, but what things they<i> had heard</i>, as in Luke.<br><br> It must not be forgotten that the words here used by our Lord have an inner and spiritual sense, as betokening the blessings and miracles of divine grace on the souls of men, of which His outward and visible miracles were symbolical. The words are mostly cited from Isa. xxxv. 5, where the same spiritual meaning is conveyed by them. They are quoted here, as the words of Isa. liii. are the Evangelist in ch. viii. 17, as applicable to their partial external fulfilment, which however, like themselves, pointed onward to their greater spiritual completion.<br><br><b> the poor have the gospel preached to them (are evangelized)</b>] Stier remarks the coupling of these miracles together, and observes that with<b> the dead are raised</b>, this is united, as being a thing hitherto unheard of and strange, and an especial fulfilment of Isa. lxi. 1.
