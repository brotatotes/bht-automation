<b> 5.</b>] The words<b> the dead are raised up</b> have occasioned some difficulty; but surely without reason. In Luke, the raising of the widow’s son at Nain immediately precedes this message; and in this Gospel we have had the ruler’s daughter raised. These miracles might be referred to by our Lord under the words<b> the dead are raised up</b>; for it is to be observed that He bade them tell John not only what things they saw, but what things they<i> had heard</i>, as in Luke.
