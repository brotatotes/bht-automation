<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] The words <strong> νεκροὶ ἐγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> have raised some difficulty; but surely without reason. In Luke, the raising of the widow’s son at Nain immediately precedes this message; and in this Gospel we have had the ruler’s daughter raised. These miracles might be referred to by our Lord under the words νεκ . ἐγ .; for it is to be observed that He bade them tell John not only what things they saw, but what things they <em> had heard</em> , as in Luke.
	</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that the words here used by our Lord have an inner and spiritual sense, as betokening the blessings and miracles of divine grace on the souls of men, of which His outward and visible miracles were symbolical. The words are mostly cited from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:5">Isaiah 35:5</span> , where the same spiritual meaning is conveyed by them. They are quoted here, as the words of Isa 53:1-12 are by the Evangelist in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:17">Matthew 8:17</span> , as applicable to their partial external fulfilment, which however, like themselves, pointed onward to their greater spiritual completion.

<p><strong> εὐαγγελίζονται</strong> is passive, see reff. and 2Ki 18:31 in the LXX. In ref. Luke it is also passive, but with the thing preached as its subject. Stier remarks the coupling of these miracles together, and observes that with νεκ . ἐγ . is united <strong> πτωχοὶ εὐαγγελίζονται</strong> <strong> ,</strong> as being a thing hitherto unheard of and strange, and an especial fulfilment of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span> .</p>
