<b> 7.</b>] The following verses set forth to the people the real character and position of John; identifying him who cried in the wilderness with him who now spoke from his prison, and assuring them that there was the same dignity of office and mission throughout. They are not spoken till after the departure of the disciples of John, probably because they were not meant for them or John to hear, but for the people, who on account of the question which they had heard might go away with a mistaken depreciation of John. And our Lord, as usual, takes occasion, from reminding them of the impression made on them by Johnâ€™s preaching of repentance, to set forth to them deep truths regarding His own Kingdom and Office.
