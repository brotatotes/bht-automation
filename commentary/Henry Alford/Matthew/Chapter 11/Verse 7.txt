 7. ] The following verses set forth to the people the real character and position of John; identifying him who cried in the wilderness with him who now spoke from his prison, and assuring them that there was the same dignity of office and mission throughout. They are not spoken till after the departure of the disciples of John, probably because they were not meant for them or John to hear, but for the people, who on account of the question which they had heard might go away with a mistaken depreciation of John. ὁ πολὺς ὄχλος ἐκ τῆς ἐρωτήσεως τῶν Ἰωάννου μαθητῶν πολλὰ ἂν ἄτοπα ὑπενόησεν οὐκ εἰδὼς τὴν γνώμην μεθ ʼ ἧς ἔπεμψε τοὺς μαθητάς . καὶ εἰκὸς ἦν διαλογίζεσθαι πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς καὶ λέγειν Ὁ τοσαῦτα μαρτυρήσας μετεπείσθη νῦν , καὶ ἀμφιβάλλει εἴτε οὗτος εἴτε ἕτερος εἴη ὁ ἐρχόμενος ; ἆρα μὴ στασιάζων πρὸς τὸν Ἰησοῦν ταῦτα λέγει ; ἆρα μὴ δειλότερος ὑπὸ τοῦ δεσμωτηρίου γενόμενος ; ἆρα μὴ μάτην καὶ εἰκῆ τὰ πρότερα εἴρηκεν ; ἐπεὶ οὖν πολλὰ τοιαῦτα εἰκὸς ἦν αὐτοὺς ὑποπτεύειν , ὅρα πῶς αὐτῶν διορθοῦται τὴν ἀσθένειαν , καὶ ταύτας ἀναιρεῖ τὰς ὑποψίας . Chrysostom, Hom. xxxvii. 1, p. 414. And our Lord, as usual, takes occasion, from reminding them of the impression made on them by John’s preaching of repentance, to set forth to them deep truths regarding His own Kingdom and Office.
