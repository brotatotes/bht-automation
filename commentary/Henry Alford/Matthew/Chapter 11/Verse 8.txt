 8.   ἀλλά ] If it was not that, …; so in Demosth. Coron. p. 233, τί γὰρ καὶ βουλόμενοι μετεπέμπεσθ ʼ ἂν αὐτούς ; ἐπὶ τὴν εἰρήνην ; ἀλλ ʼ ὑπῆρχεν ἅπασιν .  ἀλλ  ʼ ἐπὶ τὸν πόλεμον : see Klotz, Devar. p. 5.
	 τί ἐξήλθατε ] The repetition of this question, and the order of the suggestive answers, are remarkable. The first sets before them the scene of their desert pilgrimage the banks of Jordan with its reeds (as Dr. Burton quotes from Lucian Hermotim., κάλαμος ἐπ ʼ ὄχθῃ παραποταμίῳ πεφυκὼς καὶ πρὸς πᾶν τὸ πνέον σαλευόμενος ); but no such trifles were the object of the journey: this suggestion is rejected without an answer. The second reminds them that it was a  man but not one in soft clothing, for such are not found in deserts. The third brings before them the real object of their pilgrimage in his holy office, and even amplifies that office itself. So that the great Forerunner is made to rise gradually and sublimely into his personality, and thus his preaching of repentance is revived in their minds.
	 ἐν μαλακοῖς ] Contrast this with the garb of John as described ch. Matthew 3:4 . Such an one, in soft raiment, might be the forerunner of a proud earthly prince, but not the preacher of repentance before a humble and suffering Saviour; might be found as the courtly flatterer in the palaces of kings, but not as the stern rebuker of tyrants, languishing in their fortress dungeons.
