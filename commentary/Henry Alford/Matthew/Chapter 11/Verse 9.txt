<b> 9.</b>] We read, ch. xxi. 26, that ‘all accounted John as a prophet.’—John was more than a prophet, because he did not write of, but<i> saw</i> and<i> pointed out</i>, the object of his prophecy;—and because of his proximity to the kingdom of God. He was moreover more than a prophet, because he himself was the subject as well as the vehicle of prophecy. But with deep humility he applies to himself only that one, of two such prophetic passages, which describes him as<i> a voice of one crying</i>, and omits the one which gives him the title of<i> my messenger</i>, here cited by our Lord.
