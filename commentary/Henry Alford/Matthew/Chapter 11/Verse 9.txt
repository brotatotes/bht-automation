 9.   προφήτην ] We read, ch. Matthew 21:26 , that ‘all accounted John as a prophet.’
	 περισσότερον is neuter (as always in N.T.), not masculine; as πλεῖον , ch. Matthew 12:41-42 . E. V. rightly,  more than a prophet.
	John was more than a prophet, because he did not write of, but  saw and  pointed out , the object of his prophecy; and because of his proximity to the Kingdom of God. He was moreover more than a prophet, because he himself was the subject as well as the vehicle of prophecy. But with deep humility, he applies to himself only that one, of two such prophetic passages, which describes him as φωνὴ βοῶντος , and omits the one which gives him the title of ὁ ἄγγελός μου , here cited by our Lord.
