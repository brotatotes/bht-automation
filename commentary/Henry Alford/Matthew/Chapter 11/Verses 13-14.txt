<p><strong> 13, 14.</strong> ] The whole body of testimony as yet has been <em> prophetic</em> , the Law and Prophets, from the first till Zacharias the priest and Simeon and Anna prophesied; and according to the declaration of prophecy itself, John, in the spirit and power of Elias, was the forerunner of the great subject of all prophecy. Neither this nor the testimony of our Lord, ch. Mat 17:12 is inconsistent with John’s own denial that he was Elias, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:21">John 1:21</span> . For (1) the question there was evidently asked as assuming a <em> re-appearance of the actual Elias upon earth:</em> and (2) our Lord cannot be understood in either of these passages as meaning that the prophecy of Mal 4:5 received its <em> full completion</em> in John. For as in other prophecies, so in this, we have a partial fulfilment both of the coming of the Lord and of His forerunner, while the great and complete fulfilment is yet future at the great day of the Lord. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:1">Malachi 4:1</span> .

<p><strong> ὁ μέλλων ἔρχεσθαι</strong> here may not be = ὃς ἔμελλεν ἔρχεσθαι (as Bengel, ‘sermo est tanquam e prospectu testamenti veteris in novum’), but is perhaps <em> strictly future</em> , <strong> who shall come.</strong> Compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:11">Matthew 17:11</span> , where the future is used. The <strong> εἰ θέλετε δέξασθαι</strong> must be taken as referring to the partial sense of the fulfilment implied: for it was (and is to this day) the belief of the Jews that Elias in person should come before the end.</p>
