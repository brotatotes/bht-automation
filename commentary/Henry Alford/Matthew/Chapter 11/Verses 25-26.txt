<p><strong> 25, 26.</strong> ] This is certainly a continuation of the foregoing discourse; and the <strong> ἀποκριθείς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> which seems to have nothing to refer to, does in reality refer to the words which have immediately preceded. The <strong> ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ κ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is not <em> chronological</em> , but gives additional solemnity to what follows. There may have been a slight break in the discourse; the older interpreters, and Meyer, insert the return of the Apostles; but I do not see any necessity for it. The whole ascription of praise is an <em> answer:</em> an answer to the mysterious dispensations of God’s Providence above recounted. With regard to the arrangement in Luke, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:21">Luke 10:21</span> .

Stier remarks that this is the <em> first public mention</em> by our Lord of His Father; the words in ch. Mat 10:32-33 having been addressed to the twelve (but see Joh 2:16 ). We have two more instances of such a public address to His Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:41">John 11:41</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:28">John 12:28</span> ; and again <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:34">Luke 23:34</span> . It is to be observed that He does not address the Father as <em> His</em> Lord, but as Lord <em> of heaven and earth;</em> as ὁ τὰ πάντα ἐνεργῶν κατὰ τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span> .

<p><strong> ταῦτα</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <em> these mysterious arrangements</em> , by which the sinner is condemned in his pride and unbelief, the humble and childlike saved, and God justified when He saves and condemns. These are ‘revealed’ to those who can in a simple and teachable spirit, as νήπιοι , obey the invitation in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:28-30">Matthew 11:28-30</span> , but ‘hidden’ from the wise and clever of this world, who attempt their solution by the inadequate instrumentality of the mere human understanding.
