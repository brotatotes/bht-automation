<p><strong> 10.</strong> ] This narrative is found in Mark and Luke with considerable variation in details from our text, those two Evangelists agreeing however with one another. In both these accounts, they ( <em> the Scribes and Pharisees</em> , Luke) were watching our Lord to see whether He would heal on the Sabbath: and He ( <em> knowing their thoughts</em> , Luke) ordered the man to stand forth in the midst, and asked <em> them</em> the question here given. The question about the animal does not occur in either of them, but in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:5">Luke 14:5</span> , on a similar occasion. The additional particulars given are very interesting. By Luke, it was the <em> right</em> hand; by Mark, <em> our Lord looked round on them</em> μετ ʼ ὀργῆς , συνλυπούμενος ἐπὶ τῇ πωρώσει τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν : and the <em> Herodians were joined with the Pharisees</em> in their counsel against Him. See notes on Luke.
