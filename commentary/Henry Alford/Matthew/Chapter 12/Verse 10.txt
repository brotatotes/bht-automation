<b> 10.</b>] This narrative is found in Mark and Luke with considerable variation in details from our text, those two Evangelists agreeing however with one another. In both these accounts, they (<i>the Scribes and Pharisees</i>, Luke) were watching our Lord to see whether He would heal on the Sabbath:—and He (<i>knowing their thoughts</i>, Luke) ordered the man to stand forth in the midst, and asked<i> them</i> the question here given. The question about the animal does not occur in either of them, but in Luke xiv. 5, on a similar occasion. The additional particulars given are very interesting. By Luke,—it was the<i> right</i> hand; by Mark,—<i>our Lord looked round on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts</i>:—And the<i> Herodians were joined with the Pharisees</i> in their counsel against Him. See notes on Luke.
