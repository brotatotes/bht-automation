 10. ] This narrative is found in Mark and Luke with considerable variation in details from our text, those two Evangelists agreeing however with one another. In both these accounts, they (  the Scribes and Pharisees , Luke) were watching our Lord to see whether He would heal on the Sabbath: and He (  knowing their thoughts , Luke) ordered the man to stand forth in the midst, and asked  them the question here given. The question about the animal does not occur in either of them, but in Luke 14:5 , on a similar occasion. The additional particulars given are very interesting. By Luke, it was the  right hand; by Mark,  our Lord looked round on them μετ ʼ ὀργῆς , συνλυπούμενος ἐπὶ τῇ πωρώσει τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν : and the  Herodians were joined with the Pharisees in their counsel against Him. See notes on Luke.
