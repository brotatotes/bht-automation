 17. ] On  ἵνα πληρωθῇ  , see note on ch. Matthew 1:22 . Neither it nor ὅπως πλ . must be understood ‘  and thus was fulfilled ,’ as Webster and Wilkinson: both are used only of the purpose, not of the result, here or any where. It is strange that any should be found, at this period of the progress of exegesis, to go back to a view which is both superficial and ungrammatical. The prophecy is partly from the LXX, partly an original translation. The LXX have Ἰακὼβ ὁ παῖς μου … Ἰσραὴλ ὁ ἐκλεκτός μου …, but the Rabbis generally understood it of the Messiah.
