<b> 17.</b>] On<b> that it might be fulfilled</b>, see note on ch. i. 22. It must not be understood ‘<i>and thus was fulfilled:</i>’ it is used only of the<i> purpose</i>, not of the<i> result</i>, here or any where. It is strange that any should be found, at this period of the progress of exegesis, to go back to a view which is both superficial and ungrammatical. The prophecy is partly from the LXX, partly an original translation. The LXX have ‘Jacob my servant... Israel my chosen...,’ but the Rabbis generally understood it of the Messiah.
