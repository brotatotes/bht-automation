<b> 25.</b>] The Pharisees said this covertly to some among the multitude; see Luke, vv. 15, 17. “There is at first sight a difficulty in the argument which our Saviour draws from the oneness of the kingdom of Satan: viz. that it seems the very idea of this kingdom, that it should<i> be this anarchy</i>; blind rage and hate not only against God, but each part of it warring against every other part. And this is most deeply true, that hell is as much in arms against itself as against Heaven: neither does our Lord deny that<i> in respect of itself</i> that kingdom is infinite contradiction and division: only He asserts that in relation to the<i> kingdom of goodness</i> it is at one: there is one life in it and one soul in relation to that. Just as a nation or kingdom may embrace within itself infinite parties, divisions, discords, jealousies, and heartburnings: yet, if it is to subsist as a nation at all, it must not,<i> as regards other nations</i>, have lost its sense of unity; when it does so, of necessity it falls to pieces and perishes.” Trench, Miracles, p. 58. We may observe (1) that our Lord here in the most solemn manner re-asserts and confirms the truths respecting the kingdom of evil which the Jews also held. The<i> kingdoms</i> are so set parallel with one another, that the denial of the reality of the one with its<i> chief</i>, or the supposing it founded merely in assent on the part of our Lord to Jewish notions, inevitably brings with it the same conclusions with regard to the other. They are both<i> real</i>, and so is the conflict between them. (2) That our Lord here appeals not to<i> an insulated case</i> of casting out of devils, in which answer might have been made, that the craft of Satan might sometimes put on the garb and arts of an adversary to himself for his own purposes,—but to the<i> general and uniform tenor of all such acts</i> on his part, in which He was found as the continual Adversary of the kingdom of Satan. (3) That our Lord proceeds to shew that the axiom is true of all human societies, even to a family, the smallest of such. (4) That He does<i> not</i> state the same of an individual man, ‘<i>Every man divided against himself falleth,</i>’ rests upon deeper grounds, which will be entered on in the notes on vv. 30, 31.
