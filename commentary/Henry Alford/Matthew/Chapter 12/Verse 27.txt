<b> 27.</b>] The interpretation of this verse has been much disputed; viz. as to whether the casting out by the sons of the Pharisees (<b>scholars,—disciples;</b> see 2 Kings ii. 3 and passim) were real or pretended exorcisms. The occurrence mentioned Luke ix. 49 does not seem to apply; for there John says,<i> Master, we saw one casting out devils</i><b> in thy Name</b>, which hardly could have been the case with those here referred to. Nor again can the<i> vagabond Jews, exorcists</i>, of Acts xix. 13 be the same as these, inasmuch as they also named over the possessed<i> the name of the Lord Jesus</i>: or at all events it can be no such invocation which is<i> here</i> referred to. In Josephus (Antt. viii. 2. 5) we read that Solomon “left forms of exorcism, by which they cast out demons so that they never return. And,” he adds, “this kind of cure is very common among us to this day.” It is highly necessary to institute this enquiry as to the reality of their exorcisms: for it would leave an unworthy impression on the reader, and one very open to the cavils of unbelief, were we to sanction the idea that our Lord would have solemnly compared with his own miracles, and drawn inferences from, a system of imposture, which on that supposition, these Pharisees<i> must have known</i> to be such. I infer then that the<i> sons of the Pharisees did really cast</i> out devils, and I think this view is confirmed by what the multitudes said in ch. ix. 33, where upon the dumb speaking after the devil was cast out they exclaimed, “<i>It never was so seen in Israel:</i>” meaning that this was a more complete healing than they had ever seen before. The difficulty has arisen mainly from forgetting that miracles,<i> as such</i>, are<i> no test of truth</i>, but have been permitted to, and prophesied of, false religions and teachers. See Exodus vii. 22; viii. 7: ch. xxiv. 24, &c.: Deut. xiii. 1–5. There is an important passage in Justin Martyr, in which he says that the Name of the Son of God Himself never failed to cast out dæmons, whereas those of the Jewish kings, prophets, and patriarchs, failed. “But,” he adds, “if you used the Name of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, perhaps it might prevail.” Irenæus says that by this invocation the Jews cast out dæmons even in his time. Jerome, Chrysostom, and others understood “<i>your sons</i>” to mean<i> the Apostles</i>.
