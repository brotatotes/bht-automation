<b> 30.</b>] These words have been variously understood. Chrysostom and Euthymius understand them to refer to the devil: Bengel, Schleiermacher, and Neander, to the Jewish exorcists named above. Grotius and others understand it as merely a general proverb, and the “<i>me</i>” to mean ‘<i>any one,</i>’ and here to apply to Satan, the sense being, ‘<i>If I do not promote Satan's kingdom, which I have proved that I do not, then I must be his adversary.</i>’ But this is on all accounts improbable: see below on<i> gathereth</i> and<i> scattereth</i>. We must regard it as a saying setting forth to us generally the entire and complete disjunction of the two kingdoms, of Satan and God. There is and can be in the world<i> no middle party:</i> they who are not with Christ, who do not gather with Him,—are against Him and his work, and as far as in them lies are undoing it. See Rom. viii. 7. And thus the saying connects itself with the following verse:—this being the case,<b> Wherefore</b><i> I say unto you</i>,—the sin of an open belying of the present power of the Holy Spirit of God working in and for His Kingdom, assumes a character surpassingly awful. This saying is no way inconsistent with that in Mark ix. 40: Luke ix. 50. That is not a conversion of this, for the terms of the respective propositions are not the same. See note on Mark ix. 40.<br><br> As usual, this saying of our Lord reached further than the mere occasion to which it referred, and spoke forcibly to those many half-persuaded hesitating persons who flattered themselves that they could strike out a line avoiding equally the persecution of men and the rejection of Christ. He informed them (and informs us also) of the impossibility of such an endeavour.<br><br> In the<b> gathereth</b> there is an allusion to the idea of gathering the harvest: see ch. xiii. 30: John xi. 52, and for<b> scattereth</b>, John x. 12, in all which places the words exactly bear out their sense here.<br><br> No<i> sure</i> inference can be drawn from the words<b> neither in the world to come</b>—with regard to forgiveness of sins in a future state. Olshausen remarks that a parallel on the other side is found in ch. x. 41, 42, where the<i> recognition</i> of divine power in those sent from God is accompanied with promise of eternal reward. He himself however understands the passage (as many otHers have done) to imply forgiveness on repentance<i> in the imperfect state of the dead</i> before the judgment, and considers it to be cognate with 1 Pet. iii. 18 ff. Augustine speaks very strongly: “It could not be said with truth of any, that ‘it shall not be forgiven them neither in this world nor either in the world to come,’ unless there were some who are to be forgiven not in this world, but in the world to come.” See, on the whole subject, note on 1 Pet. iii. 18 ff. In the almost entire silence of Scripture on any such doctrine, every principle of sound interpretation requires that we should hesitate to support it by two difficult passages, in neither of which does the plain construction of the words absolutely require it.<br><br> The expressions<b> this world</b> (equivalent to “<i>this present world,</i>” Tit. ii, 12: 2 Tim. iv. 10; “<i>this time,</i>” Mark x. 30; “<i>the course (age) of this world,</i>” Eph. ii. 2; “<i>this present evil world,</i>” Gal. i. 4) and<b> the world to come</b> (see Mark x. 30; equivalent to “<i>that world,</i>” Luke xx. 35; “<i>the ages to come,</i>” Eph. ii. 7) were common among the Jews, and generally signified respectively the time before and after the coming of the Messiah. In the N.T. these significations are replaced by—<i>the present life</i>, and<i> that to come</i>: the present mixed state of wheat and tares, and the future completion of Messiah’s Kingdom after the great harvest. These terms seem to differ from “<i>the kingdom of heaven,</i>” or “<i>of God,</i>” in never being spoken of, or as in, individuals, but as an age of time belonging to the universal Church.<br><br><b> idle</b> is perhaps best taken here in its milder and negative sense, as not yet determined on till the judgment: so that our Lord’s declaration is a deduction “a minori,” and if of every<i> idle</i> saying, then how much more of every<i> wicked</i> saying!
