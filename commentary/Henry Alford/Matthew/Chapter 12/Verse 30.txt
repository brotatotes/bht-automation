<b> 30.</b>] These words have been variously understood. Chrysostom and Euthymius understand them to refer to the devil: Bengel, Schleiermacher, and Neander, to the Jewish exorcists named above. Grotius and others understand it as merely a general proverb, and the “<i>me</i>” to mean ‘<i>any one,</i>’ and here to apply to Satan, the sense being, ‘<i>If I do not promote Satan's kingdom, which I have proved that I do not, then I must be his adversary.</i>’ But this is on all accounts improbable: see below on<i> gathereth</i> and<i> scattereth</i>. We must regard it as a saying setting forth to us generally the entire and complete disjunction of the two kingdoms, of Satan and God. There is and can be in the world<i> no middle party:</i> they who are not with Christ, who do not gather with Him,—are against Him and his work, and as far as in them lies are undoing it. See Rom. viii. 7. And thus the saying connects itself with the following verse:—this being the case,<b> Wherefore</b><i> I say unto you</i>,—the sin of an open belying of the present power of the Holy Spirit of God working in and for His Kingdom, assumes a character surpassingly awful. This saying is no way inconsistent with that in Mark ix. 40: Luke ix. 50. That is not a conversion of this, for the terms of the respective propositions are not the same. See note on Mark ix. 40.
