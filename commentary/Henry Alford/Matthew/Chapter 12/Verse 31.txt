<b>Wherefore, because this is the case</b>: see last note. Notice again the<b> I say unto you</b>, used by our Lord when He makes some revelation of things hidden from the sons of men: see ch. vi. 29, and xviii. 10, 19: and ver. 36 below. The distinction in these much controverted verses seems to be, between 1) the sin and blasphemy which arises from culpable ignorance and sensual blindness, as that of the fool who said in his heart ‘There is no God,’—of those who, e.g. Saul of Tarsus, opposed Jesus as not being the Christ; which persons, to whatever degree their sin may unhappily advance, are capable of enlightenment, repentance, and pardon:—and (2) the blasphemy of those who, acknowledge God, and seeing his present power working by his Holy Spirit,<i> openly oppose</i> themselves to it, as did, or as were very near doing (for our Lord does not actually imply that they<i> had</i> incurred this dreadful charge), these Pharisees. They may as yet have been under the veil of ignorance; but this their last proceeding, in the sight of Him who knows the hearts, approximated very near to, or perhaps reached, this awful degree of guilt. The principal misunderstanding of this passage has arisen from the prejudice which possesses men’s minds owing to the use the words, ‘the<i> sin</i> against the Holy Ghost.’ It is not a particular species of sin which is here condemned, but a definite act shewing a<i> state</i> of sin, and that state a wilful determined opposition to the present power of the Holy Spirit; and this as shewn by its fruit,<i> blasphemy</i>. The declaration, in substance, often occurs in the N.T. See 1 John v. 16, and note on “<i>sin</i>” there: 2 Tim. iii. 8: Jude 4, 12, 13: Heb. x. 26–31; vi. 4–8.
