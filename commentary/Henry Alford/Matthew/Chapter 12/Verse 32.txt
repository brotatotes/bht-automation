No<i> sure</i> inference can be drawn from the words<b> neither in the world to come</b>—with regard to forgiveness of sins in a future state. Olshausen remarks that a parallel on the other side is found in ch. x. 41, 42, where the<i> recognition</i> of divine power in those sent from God is accompanied with promise of eternal reward. He himself however understands the passage (as many otHers have done) to imply forgiveness on repentance<i> in the imperfect state of the dead</i> before the judgment, and considers it to be cognate with 1 Pet. iii. 18 ff. Augustine speaks very strongly: “It could not be said with truth of any, that ‘it shall not be forgiven them neither in this world nor either in the world to come,’ unless there were some who are to be forgiven not in this world, but in the world to come.” See, on the whole subject, note on 1 Pet. iii. 18 ff. In the almost entire silence of Scripture on any such doctrine, every principle of sound interpretation requires that we should hesitate to support it by two difficult passages, in neither of which does the plain construction of the words absolutely require it.<br><br> The expressions<b> this world</b> (equivalent to “<i>this present world,</i>” Tit. ii, 12: 2 Tim. iv. 10; “<i>this time,</i>” Mark x. 30; “<i>the course (age) of this world,</i>” Eph. ii. 2; “<i>this present evil world,</i>” Gal. i. 4) and<b> the world to come</b> (see Mark x. 30; equivalent to “<i>that world,</i>” Luke xx. 35; “<i>the ages to come,</i>” Eph. ii. 7) were common among the Jews, and generally signified respectively the time before and after the coming of the Messiah. In the N.T. these significations are replaced by—<i>the present life</i>, and<i> that to come</i>: the present mixed state of wheat and tares, and the future completion of Messiah’s Kingdom after the great harvest. These terms seem to differ from “<i>the kingdom of heaven,</i>” or “<i>of God,</i>” in never being spoken of, or as in, individuals, but as an age of time belonging to the universal Church.
