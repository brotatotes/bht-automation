not, as generally understood, equivalent to ‘<i>represent..... as:</i>’ for then the clause ‘<i>for out&c.</i>’ loses its meaning:—but literally,<b> make</b>. The verse is a parable, not merely a similitude. ‘There are but two ways open: either<i> make</i> the<i> tree and its fruit</i> both<i> good,</i> or both<i> bad: for</i> by the fruit the tree is known.’ How<i> make</i>, the parable does not say: but let us remember, the Creator speaks, and sets forth a law of his own creation, with which our judgments must be in accord. This verse resumes again the leading argument, and sets forth the inconsistency of the Pharisees in representing Him as in league with evil, whose works were uniformly good. But the words have a double reference: to our Lord Himself, who could not be evil, seeing that His works were good; and (which leads on to the next verse) to the Pharisees, who could not speak good things, because their works were evil.
