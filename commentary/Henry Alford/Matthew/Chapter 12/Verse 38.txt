It seems that the first part of the discourse gave rise, as here related, to the request for a sign (from Heaven); but, as we might naturally expect, and as we learn from St. Luke, on the part of  different persons from those who made the accusation . In consequence of our Lord declaring that his miracles were wrought by the Holy Ghost, they wish to see some decisive proof of this by a sign, not from Himself, but  from Heaven .
	The account in ch. Mat 16:1-4 manifestly relates to a different occurrence: see notes there. Cf. John 6:30-31 ; John 12:28 .
