<b> 38.</b>] St. Luke (xi. 15, 16) places the accusation of casting out devils by Beelzebub and this request together, and then the discourse follows. It seems that the first of the discourse gave rise, as here related, to the request for a sign (from Heaven); but, as we might naturally expect, and as we learn from St. Luke, on the part of<i> different persons from those who made the accusation</i>. In consequence of our Lord declaring that His miracles were wrought by the Holy Ghost, they wish to see some decisive proof of this by a sign, not from Himself, but<i> from Heaven</i>. The account in ch. xvi. 1â€“4 manifestly relates to a different occurrence: see notes there. Cf. John vi. 30, 31; xii. 28.
