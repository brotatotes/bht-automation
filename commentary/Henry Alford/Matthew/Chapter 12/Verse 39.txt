<b> 39.</b>]<b> adulterous</b> (see reff.), because they been the peculiar people of the Lord, and so in departing from Him had broken the covenant of<i> marriage</i>, according to the similitude so common in the prophets.<br><br> The expression<b> there shall no sign be given to it</b> does not, as has been maintained, exclude our Lord’s miracles from being<i> signs</i>: but is the direct answer to their request in the sense in which we know they used the word, ‘a sign, not<i> wrought Him, and so able to be suspected of magic art</i>, but one<i> from Heaven.</i>’ Besides, even if this were not so, how can the refusing to work a miracle to<i> satisfy them</i>, affect the nature or signification of those wrought on different occasions, and with a totally different view? The<i> sign of Jonas</i> is the most remarkable foreshadowing in the O.T. of the resurrection of our Lord. It was of course impossible that His resurrection should be represented by an actual resurrection, as his birth was by births (Isaac, Samson, Samuel, Mahershalalhashbaz), and His death by deaths (Abel; the substitute for Isaac; Zechariah the prophet; the daily and occasional sacrifices); so that we find the events symbolic of his resurrection (Joseph’s history; Isaac’s sacrifice; Daniel’s and Jonah’s deliverance), representing it in a figure (lit., “<i>a parable,</i>” Heb. xi. 19). In the case before us the figure was very remarkable, and easily to be recognized in the O.T. narrative. For Jonah himself calls the belly of the sea monster (Jonah ii. 2), ‘the belly of Hades,’ =<i> the heart of the earth</i> here. And observe, that the type is not of our Lord’s<i> body being deposited in the tomb</i> of Joseph of Arimathea, for neither could that be called ‘the heart of the earth,’ nor could it be said that ‘the Son of Man’ was there during the time; but of our Lord’s<i> personal descent into the place of departed souls</i>:—see Eph. iv. 9: 1 Pet. iii, 19, and note on Luke xxiii. 43.
