<b> 41.</b>] In this verse there is no reference to the<i> sign</i> of Jonas<i> spoken of above</i>, but to a different matter, another way in which he should be a sign to this generation. See Luke xi. 29 f., and note. (But the preaching of Jonas to the Ninevites was a sign after<i> his</i> resurrection: so shall the preaching of the Son of Man by His Spirit in His Apostles be after His resurrection. Stier.)
