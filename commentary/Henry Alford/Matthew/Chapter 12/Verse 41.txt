<b> 41.</b>] In this verse there is no reference to the<i> sign</i> of Jonas<i> spoken of above</i>, but to a different matter, another way in which he should be a sign to this generation. See Luke xi. 29 f., and note. (But the preaching of Jonas to the Ninevites was a sign after<i> his</i> resurrection: so shall the preaching of the Son of Man by His Spirit in His Apostles be after His resurrection. Stier.)<br><br> On the adjective, here and ver. 42, being in the<i> neuter</i>, see above, ver. 6, note.<br><br><b> There is more than Jonas here</b>] No matter so worthy of arousing repentance had ever been revealed or preached as the Gospel: no matter so worthy of exciting the earnest attention of all. And the Lord<i> Himself</i>, the Announcer of this Gospel, is greater than all the sons of men: his<i> preaching</i>, greater than that of Jonah: his<i> wisdom</i>, than that of Solomon.
