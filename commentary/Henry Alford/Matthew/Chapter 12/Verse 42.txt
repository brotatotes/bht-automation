<b> 42. The queen of the south</b>] Josephus calls her the woman who then reigned over Egypt and Ã†thiopia, i.e. over Meroe (whose queens were usually called Candace. Plin. Hist. vi. 29). Abyssinian tradition agrees with this account, calls her Maqueda, and supposes her to have embraced the Jewish religion in Jerusalem. The Arabians on the other hand also claim her, calling her Balkis, which latter view is probably nearer the truth, Sheba being a tract in Arabia Felix, near the shores of the Red Sea, near the present Aden, abounding in spice and gold and precious stones.
