<p><strong> 46.</strong> ] In Mar 3:21 we are told that his relations <em> went out to lay hold on Him, for they said, He is beside Himself:</em> and that the reason of this was his continuous labour in teaching, which <em> had not left time so much as to eat</em> . There is nothing in this care for his bodily health (from whatever source the act may have arisen on the part of his <em> brethren</em> , see Joh 7:5 ) inconsistent with the known state of his <em> mother’s</em> mind (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:19">Luke 2:19</span> ; Luk 2:51 ).

<p>They stood ἔξω , i.e. outside the throng of hearers around our Lord; or, perhaps, outside the house. He meets their message with a reproof, which at the same time conveys assurance to His humble hearers. He came for <em> all men</em> , and though He was born of a woman, He who is the second Adam, taking our entire humanity on Him, is not on that account more nearly united to her, than to all those who are united to Him by the Spirit; nor bound to regard the call of earthly relations so much as the welfare of those whom He came to teach and to save.

<p>It is to be noticed that our Lord, though He introduces the additional term ἀδελφή into his answer, does not (and indeed could not) introduce πατήρ , inasmuch as He never speaks of an earthly Father. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:49">Luke 2:49</span> .

<p>All these characteristics of the mother of our Lord are deeply interesting, both in themselves, and as building up, when put together, the most decisive testimony against the fearful superstition which has assigned to her the place of a goddess in the Romish mythology. Great and inconceivable as the honour of that meek and holy woman was, we find her repeatedly (see Joh 2:4 ) the object of rebuke from her divine Son, and hear Him here declaring, that the honour is one which the humblest believer in Him has in common with her.

<p>Stier remarks (Reden Jesu, ii. 57 note), that the juxtaposition of <em> sister</em> and <em> mother</em> in the mouth of our Lord makes it probable that the <em> brethren</em> also were his actual brothers according to the flesh: see note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:55">Matthew 13:55</span> .</p>
