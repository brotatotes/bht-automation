 9.   μεταβὰς ἐκεῖθεν ] This change of place is believed by Greswell to have been a journey back to Galilee after the Passover. (Diss. viii. vol. ii.) It is true that no such change is implied in Mark and Luke; but the words here point to a journey undertaken, as in ch. Matthew 11:1 ; Matthew 15:29 , the only other places in this Gospel where the expression occurs. In John 7:3 , the cognate expression μετάβηθι ἐντεῦθεν is used of a journey from Galilee to Judæa. So that certainly it is not implied here (as Meyer, a [120] ., suppose) that the incident took place on the  same day as the previous one. We know from Luk 6:1-49 that it was on another (the next?) sabbath.
