<b> 9. when he was departed thence</b>] This change of place is believed by Greswell to have been a journey back to Galilee after the Passover. (Diss. viii. vol. ii.) It is true that no such change is implied in Mark and Luke; but the words here point to a journey undertaken, as in ch. xi. 1; xv. 29, the only other places in this Gospel where the expression occurs. In John vii. 3, the cognate expression, “<i>Depart hence,</i>” is used of a journey from Galilee to Judæa. So that certainly it is not implied here (as Meyer, al., suppose) that the incident took placo on the<i> same day</i> as the previous one. We know from Luke vi. that it was on another (the next?) sabbath.
