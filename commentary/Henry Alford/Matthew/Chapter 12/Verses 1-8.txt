 1 8. ] THE DISCIPLES PLUCK EARS OF CORN ON THE SABBATH. OUR LORD’S ANSWER TO THE PHARISEES THEREON. Mark 2:23-28 . Luke 6:1-5 . In Mark and Luke this incident occurs after the discourse on fasting related Mat 9:14 sq.; but in the former without any definite mark of time: St. Mark has ἐγένετο παραπορεύεσθαι αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς σάββασιν κ . τ . λ .: St. Luke ἐγέν . δὲ ἐν σαββάτῳ [ δευτεροπρώτῳ ] κ . τ . λ ., on which see note there. The expression  ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ is, I conceive, a more definite mark of connexion than we find in the other Gospels, but cannot here be fixed to the meaning which it clearly has in ch. Matthew 11:25 , where the context determines it. We can merely say that it seems to have occurred about the same time as the last thing mentioned in the same journey or season.
	The plucking the ears was allowed Deuteronomy 23:25 , but in the Talmud expressly forbidden on the Sabbath. (Lightfoot in loc.) It was also (Leviticus 23:14 , apparently, but this is by no means certain: see note on Luke) forbidden until the sheaf of first-fruits had been presented to God, which was done on the second day of the feast of unleavened bread at the Passover. This incident, on that supposition, must have occurred between that day and the harvest. It is generally supposed to have been on the first Sabbath after the Passover. For a fuller discussion of the time and place, see note on Luke as before.
