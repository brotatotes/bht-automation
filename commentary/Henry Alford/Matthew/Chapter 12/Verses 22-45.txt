 22 45. ] ACCUSATION OF CASTING OUT DEVILS BY BEELZEBUB, AND OUR LORD’S DISCOURSE THEREON. DEMAND OF A SIGN FROM HIM: HIS FURTHER DISCOURSE. Mark 3:20-30 . Luke 11:14-36 , where also see notes. This account is given by Luke later in our Lord’s ministry, but without any fixed situation or time, and with less copiousness of detail. See also ch. Matthew 9:32 , and notes there. St. Mark ( Mar 3:23-29 ) gives part of the discourse which follows, but without any determinate sequence, and omitting the miracle which led to it.
