<p><strong> 41, 42. </strong> <strong> πλεῖον Ἰωνᾶ ὧδε</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> πλεῖον Σολ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὧδε</strong> ] On the neuter, see above, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:6">Matthew 12:6</span> , note. <strong> There is more than Jonas here.</strong> No matter so worthy of arousing repentance had ever been revealed or preached as the Gospel: no matter so worthy of exciting the earnest attention of all. And the Lord <em> Himself</em> , the Announcer of this Gospel, is greater than all the sons of men: his <em> preaching</em> , greater than that of Jonah: his <em> wisdom</em> , than that of Solomon.</p>
