<b> 1. In that day</b>] These words may mean literally, as rendered in the A.V.,<i> the same day</i>. But it is not absolutely necessary. The words certainly do bear that meaning in Mark iv. 35, and important consequences follow (see note there); but in Acts viii. 1 they are as evidently indefinite. The instances of their occurrence in John (xiv. 20; xvi. 23, 26) are not to the point, their use there being prophetical.
