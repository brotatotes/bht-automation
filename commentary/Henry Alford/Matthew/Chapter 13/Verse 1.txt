 1.   ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ] These words may mean literally  in the same day , But it is not absolutely necessary. The words certainly do bear that meaning in Mark 4:35 , and important consequences follow (see note there): but in Act 8:1 they are as evidently indefinite. The instances of their occurrence in John (John 14:20 ; John 16:23 ; Joh 16:26 ) are not to the point, their use there being prophetical.
	 ἀπὸ τῆς οἰκ  . perhaps implies that the foregoing discourse was delivered  in a house , as some have thought: but the article need not (any more than τό before πλοῖον , see notes on ch. Matthew 9:1 ; Mat 9:28 ) imply  any particular house .
