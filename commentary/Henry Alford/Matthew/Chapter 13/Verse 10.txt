<b> 10.</b>]<b> the disciples</b> = “<i>they that were about him with the twelve,</i>” Mark. This question took place during a pause in our Lord’s teaching, not when He had entered the house, ver. 36. The question shews the<i> newness of this method of teaching to the disciples</i>. It is not mentioned in Mark: only the enquiry into the meaning of the parable just spoken: nor in Luke: but the answer implies it.
