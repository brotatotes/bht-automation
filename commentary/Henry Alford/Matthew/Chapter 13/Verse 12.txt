 12. ] In this saying of the Lord is summed up the  double force the  revealing and  concealing properties of the parable. By it, he who  hath , he who not only hears with the ear, but understands with the heart, has more given to him; and it is for this main purpose undoubtedly that the Lord spoke parables: to be to His Church revelations of the truth and mysteries of His Kingdom. But His present purpose in speaking them, as further explained below, was the quality possessed by them, and declared in the latter part of this verse, of hiding their meaning from the hard-hearted and sensual. By them, he who  hath not , in whom there is no spark of spiritual desire nor meetness to receive the engrafted word, has taken from him even that which he hath (“  seemeth to have ,” Luke); even the poor confused notions of heavenly doctrine which a sensual and careless life allow him, are further bewildered and darkened by this simple teaching, into the depths of which he cannot penetrate so far as even to ascertain that they exist. No practical comment on the latter part of this saying can be more striking, than that which is furnished to our day by the study of the German rationalistic (and, I may add, some of our English harmonistic) Commentators; while at the same time we may rejoice to see the approximate fulfilment of the former in such commentaries as those of Olshausen, Neander, Stier, and Trench. In ch. Matthew 25:29 , the fuller meaning of this saying, as applied not only to hearing, but to the whole spiritual life, is brought out by our Lord.
