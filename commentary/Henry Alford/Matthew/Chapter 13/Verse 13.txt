<b> 13.</b>]<b> because they seeing see not</b>, &c. = (in Mark, Luke; similarly below) “<i>that seeing they may... not....</i>”&c. In the deeper view of the purpose of the parable, both of these run into one. Taking the saying of ver. 12 for our guide, we have “<i>whosoever hath not,</i>”— “<i>because seeing they see not,</i>”—and “<i>from him shall be taken away even that he hath,</i>”— “<i>that seeing they may not see.</i>” The difficulties raised on these variations, and on the prophecy quoted in vv. 14, 15, have arisen entirely not keeping this in view.
