In the deeper view of the purpose of the parable, both of these run into one. Taking the saying of ver. 12 for our guide, we have “<i>whosoever hath not,</i>”— “<i>because seeing they see not,</i>”—and “<i>from him shall be taken away even that he hath,</i>”— “<i>that seeing they may not see.</i>” The difficulties raised on these variations, and on the prophecy quoted in vv. 14, 15, have arisen entirely not keeping this in view.<br><br><b> is fulfilled</b>]<b> is being fulfilled</b>, ‘finds one of the stages of its fulfilment:’ a partial one having taken place in the contemporaries of the prophet.

This citation gives no countenance to the fatalist view of the passage, but rests the whole blame on the hard-heartedness and unreadiness of the hearers, which is of itself the cause why the very preaching of the word is a means of further darkening and condemning them (see 2 Cor. iv. 3, 4).
