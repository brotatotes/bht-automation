<b> 18.</b>]<b> Hear</b>, in the sense of the verse before—<b>hear the true meaning</b> of, ‘<i>hear in your hearts.</i>’ With regard to the Parable itself, we may remark that its great leading idea is that “<i>mystery of the Kingdom,</i>” according to which the grace of God, and the receptivity of it by man, work ever together in bringing forth fruit. The<i> seed</i> is one and the same every where and to all: but<i> seed does not spring up without earth, nor does earth bring forth without seed</i>; and the success or failure of the seed is the consequence of the adaptation to its reception, or otherwise, of the spot on which it falls. But of course, on the other hand, as the enquiry, “Why is this ground rich, and that barren?” leads us up into the creative arrangements of God,—so a similar enquiry in the spiritual interpretation would lead us into the inscrutable and sovereign arrangements of Him who ‘preventeth us that we may have a good will, and worketh with us when we have that will’ (Art. X. of the Church of England). See, on the whole, my Sermons before the University of Cambridge, February, 1858.
