<b> 19.</b>] In Luke we have an important preliminary declaration, implied indeed here also: “<i>the seed is the word of God.</i>” This<i> word</i> is in this parable especially meant of the word<i> preached</i>, though the word<i> written</i> is not excluded: nor the word<i> unwritten</i>—the providences and judgments, and even the creation, of God. (See Rom. x. 17, 18.) The similitude in this parable is alluded to in 1 Pet. i. 23: James i. 21. The sower is first the Son of Man (ver. 37), then His ministers and servants (1 Cor. iii. 6) to the end. He sows over all the field, unlikely as well as likely places; and commands His sowers to do the same, Mark xvi. 15. Some, Stier says, have objected to the parable a want of truthful correspondence to reality, because sowers do not thus waste their seed by scattering it where it is not likely to grow; but, as he rightly answers,—the simple idea of the parable must be borne in mind, and its limits not transgressed— ‘a sower went out<i> to sow</i>’—his SOWING—sowing over all places, is the idea of the parable. We see him only as a<i> sower</i>, not as an economist. The parable is not about<i> Him</i>, but about the<i> seed</i> and<i> what happens to it</i>. He is the fit representative of<i> God, who giveth liberally to all men, and upbraideth not</i>, James i. 5.
