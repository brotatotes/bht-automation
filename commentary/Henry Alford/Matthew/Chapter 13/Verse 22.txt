<b> 22.</b>] In this<i> third</i> sort,<i> all as regards the soil is well</i>; the seed goes deep, the plant springs up; all is as in the next case, with but one exception, and that,<i> the bearing of fruit</i>—<b>becometh unfruitful</b> =<i> bring no fruit to perfection</i> (Luke). And this because the seeds or roots of thorns are in, and are suffered to spring up in the heart, and to overwhelm the plant. There is a divided will, a half-service (see on ch. vi. 25) which ever ends in the prevalence of evil over good. This class is not confined to the<i> rich</i>:<b> riches</b> in Scripture is not riches<i> absolutely</i>, as possessed, but riches<i> relatively</i>, as estimated by the desire and value for them. St. Mark adds,<i> and the lusts of (the) other things</i>, viz. the<i> other things</i> which shall be added to us if we seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. The identity of the<i> seeds sown</i> with the individuals of these classes, as maintained above, is strikingly shewn in Luke here:<i> that which fell among, thorns, (these) are they</i>&c. (viii. 14.) We may notice: (I) That there is in these three classes a PROGRESS, and that a<i> threefold</i> one:— (1) in TIME:—the first receives a hindrance<i> at the very outset</i>: the seed never springs up:—the second<i> after it has sprung up</i>, but<i> soon</i> after:—the third<i> when it has</i><i> entered, sprung up, and come to maturity: or while it is so coming</i>.— (2) in APPARENT DEGREE. The climax is<i> apparently</i> from<i> bad</i> to<i> better</i>;—the first<i> understand</i> not: the second<i> understand and</i> feel: the third<i> understand, feel, and practise</i>. But also (3) in REAL DEGREE, from<i> bad</i> to<i> worse</i>. Less awful is the state of those who<i> understand not</i> the word and lose<i> it immediately</i>, than that of those who<i> feel it, receive it with joy</i>, and in time of trial<i> fall away</i>: lees awful again this last, than that of those who<i> understand, feel, and practise</i>, but are<i> fruitless and impure</i>. It has been noticed also that the first is more the fault of<i> careless inattentive</i> CHILDHOOD; the second of<i> ardent shallow</i> YOUTH; the third of<i> worldly self-seeking</i> AGE. (II) That these classes do<i> not</i> EXCLUDE<i> one another</i>. They are great general divisions, the outer circles of which fall into one another, as they very likely might in the field itself, in their different combinations.
