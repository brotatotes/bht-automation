<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] In this <em> third</em> sort, <em> all as regards the soil is well;</em> the seed goes deep, the plant springs up; all is as in the next case, with but one exception, and that, <em> the bearing of fruit</em> <strong> ἄκαρπος γίνεται</strong> = οὐ τελεσφοροῦσι Luke. And this because the seeds or roots of thorns are in, and are suffered to spring up in, the heart, and to overwhelm the plant. There is a divided will, a half-service ( μέριμνα from μερίζω , see on ch. Mat 6:25 ) which ever ends in the prevalence of evil over good. This class is not confined to the <em> rich:</em> πλοῦτος in Scripture is not riches <em> absolutely</em> , as possessed, but riches <em> relatively</em> , as estimated by the desire and value for them. Mark adds καὶ αἱ περὶ τὰ λοιπὰ ἐπιθυμίαι , viz. the τὰ λοιπά which shall be added to us if we seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. The identity of the <em> seeds sown</em> with the individuals of these classes, as maintained above, is strikingly shewn in Luke here: τὸ δὲ εἰς τὰς ἀκάνθας πεσόν , <strong> οὗτοί εἰσιν</strong> οἱ ἀκούσαντες κ . τ . λ . (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:14">Matthew 8:14</span> .) We may notice: (I) That there is in these three classes a PROGRESS, and that a <em> threefold</em> one: (1) in TIME: the first receives a hindrance <em> at the very outset:</em> the seed never springs up: the second <em> after it has sprung up</em> , but <em> soon</em> after: the third <em> when it has entered, sprung up, and come to maturity:</em> or <em> while it is so</em> <em> coming</em> . (2) in APPARENT DEGREE. The climax is <em> apparently</em> from <em> bad</em> to <em> better;</em> the first <em> understand not:</em> the second <em> understand and feel:</em> the third <em> understand, feel, and practise</em> . But also (3) in REAL DEGREE, from <em> bad</em> to <em> worse</em> . Less awful is the state of those who <em> understand not</em> the word and <em> lose it immediately</em> , than that of those who <em> feel it, receive it with joy</em> , and in time of trial <em> fall away:</em> less awful again this last, than that of those who <em> understand, feel, and practise</em> , but are <em> fruitless and impure</em> .

<p>It has been noticed also that the first is more the fault of <em> careless inattentive</em> CHILDHOOD; the second of <em> ardent shallow</em> YOUTH; the third of <em> worldly self-seeking</em> AGE. (II) That these classes do <em> not</em> EXCLUDE <em> one another</em> . They are great general divisions, the outer circles of which fall into one another, as they very likely might in the field itself, in their different combinations.</p>
