<b> 3. in parables</b>] The senses of this word in the N.T. are various. My present concern with it is to explain its meaning as applied to the “<i>parables</i>” of our Lord. (1) The<i> Parable</i> is not a<i> Fable</i>, inasmuch as the Fable is concerned only with the maxims of worldly prudence, whereas the parable conveys spiritual truth. The<i> Fable</i> in its form rejects probability, and teaches through the<i> fancy</i>, introducing speaking ant or even inanimate things; whereas the<i> Parable</i> adheres to probability, and teaches through the<i> imagination</i>, introducing only things which may possible happen. “<i>A parable is a story of that which purports to have happened,–has not actually happened, but might have happened.</i>” (2) Nor is the Parable a<i> Myth</i>: inasmuch as in Mythology the course of the story is set before us<i> as the truth</i>, and simple minds receive it as the truth, only the reflective mind penetrating to the distinction between the vehicle an the thing conveyed; whereas in the Parable these two stand distinct from one another to all minds, so that none but the very simplest would ever believe in the Parable as fact. (3) Nor is the Parable a<i> Proverb</i>: though the Greek word (<i>parabolé</i>) is used for<i> both</i> in the N.T. (Luke iv. 23; v. 36: Matt. xv. 14, 15.) It is indeed more like a Proverb than either of the former; being an expanded Proverb, and a Proverb a concentrated parable, or fable, or result of human experience expressed without a figure. Hence it will be seen that the Proverb ranges far wider than the parable, which is an expansion of only one particular case of a proverb. Thus ‘<i>Physician heal thyself</i>’ would, if expanded, make a parable; “<i>dog eat dog,</i>” a fable; “<i>honesty is the best policy,</i>” neither of these. (4) Nor is the Parable an<i> Allegory</i>: inasmuch as in the Allegory the imaginary persons and actions are placed in the very places and footsteps of the real ones, and stand there instead of them, declaring all the time by their names or actions who and what they are. Thus the Allegory is self-interpreting, and the persons in it are invested with the attributes of those represented; whereas in the Parable the courses of action related and understood run indeed parallel, but the persons are strictly confined to their own natural places and actions, which are, in their relation and succession, typical of higher things. (5) It may well hence be surmised what a Parable<i> is</i>. It is a<i> serious narration, within the limits of probability, of a course of action pointing to some moral or spiritual Truth</i>; and derives its force from real analogies impressed by the Creator of all things on His creatures. The great Teacher by Parables therefore is He who needed not that any should testify of man; for He knew what was in man, John ii. 25: moreover, He<i> made</i> man, and orders the course and character of human events. And this is the reason why none can, or dare, teach by parables, except Christ. We do not, as He did, see the inner springs out of which flow those laws of eternal truth and justice, which the Parable is framed to elucidate.<i> Our</i> parables would be in danger of perverting, instead of guiding aright. The Parable is especially adapted to different classes of hearers at once: it is understood by each according to his measure of understanding. See note on ver. 12.<br><br> The seven Parables related in this chapter cannot be regarded as a collection made by the Evangelist as relating to one subject, the Kingdom of Heaven, and its development; they are clearly indicated by ver. 53 to have been all spoken on<i> one and the same occasion</i>, and form indeed a complete and glorious whole in their inner and deeper sense. The<i> first four</i> of these parables appear to have been spoken<i> to the multitude from the ship</i> (the interpretation of the parable of the sower being interposed); the<i> last three, to the disciples in the house</i>.<br><br> From the expression<b> he began</b> in the parallel place in St. Mark, compared with the question of the disciples in ver. 10,—and with ver. 34—it appears that this was the<i> first beginning of our Lord's teaching by parables,</i> expressly so delivered, and properly so called. And the natural sequence of things here agrees with, and confirms Matthew’s arrangement against those who would place (as Ebrard) this chapter before the Sermon on the Mount. He there spoke<i> without parables</i>, or mainly so; and continued to do so till the rejection and misunderstanding of his teaching led to His judicially adopting the course here indicated,<i> without a parable spake He not (nothing) unto them</i>. The other order would be inconceivable; that after such parabolic teaching, and such a reason assigned for it, the Lord should, that reason remaining in full force, have deserted his parabolic teaching, and opened out his meaning as plainly as in Sermon on the Mount.<br><br><b> 3.</b>] For the explanation of the parable see on vv. 19–23.<b> 4. by the way side</b>]<b> by</b> (by the side of, along the line of) the<b> path</b> through the field.
