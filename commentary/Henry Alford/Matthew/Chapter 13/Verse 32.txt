<b> 32. least of all</b>] literally,<b> less than all</b>. The words are not to be pressed to their literal sense, as the mustard seed was a well-known Jewish type for any thing exceedingly small. e mustard tree attains to a size in Judæa. See citations from Lightfoot in my Greek Test. This parable, like most others respecting the kingdom of God, has a<i> double reference—general and individual</i>. (1) In the<i> general</i> sense, the insignificant beginnings of the kingdom are set forth: the little babe cast in the manger at Bethlehem; the Man of sorrows with no place to lay His Head; the crucified One; or again the hundred and twenty names who were the seed of the Church after the Lord had ascended; then we have the Kingdom of God waxing onward and spreading its branches here and there, and different nations coming into it, “He must increase,” said the great Forerunner. We must beware however of imagining that the<i> outward Church-form</i> is this Kingdom. It has rather<i> reversed</i> the parable, and is the worldly power waxed to a great tree and the Churches taking under the shadow of it. It may be, where not corrupted by error and superstition, subservient to the growth of the heavenly plant: but is not itself that plant. It is at best no more than (to change the figure) the scaffolding to aid the building, not the building itself, (2) The<i> individual</i> application of the parable points to the small beginnings of divine grace; a word, a thought, a passing sentence, may prove to be the little seed which eventually fills and shadows the whole heart and being, and calls ‘all thoughts, all passions, all delights’ to come and shelter under it.
