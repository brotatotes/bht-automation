<b> 33.</b>] FOURTH PARABLE. THE LEAVEN. Luke xiii. 20, 21. Difficulties have been raised as to the interpretation of this parable which do not seem to belong to it. It has been questioned whether<b> leaven</b> must not be taken in the sense in which it so often occurs in Scripture, as symbolic of<i> pollution</i> and<i> corruption</i>. See Exod. xii. 15, and other enactments of the kind, passim in the law; and ch. xvi. 6: 1 Cor. v. 6, 7. And some few have taken it thus, and explained the parable of the<i> progress of corruption and deterioration</i> in the outward visible Church. But then, how is it said that the<i> Kingdom of Heaven is like</i> this leaven? For the construction is not the same as in ver. 24, where the similitude is to the<i> whole course of things related</i>, but answers to “<i>a grain of mustard seed which a man took,</i>”&c.: so “<i>leaven, which a woman took,</i>”&c. Again, if the progress of the Kingdom of Heaven be<i> towards corruption, till the whole is corrupted</i>, surely there is an end of all the blessings and healing influence of the Gospel on the world. It will be seen that such an interpretation cannot for a moment stand, on its<i> own</i> ground; but much less when we connect it with the parable preceding. The two are intimately related.<i> That</i> was of the<i> inherent self-developing power</i> of the Kingdom of Heaven, as a seed, containing in itself the principle of expansion;<i> this</i>, of the<i> power which it possesses of penetrating and assimilating a foreign mass</i>, till all be taken up into it. And the comparison is not only to the<i> power</i>, but to the<i> effect</i> of leaven also, which has its<i> good</i> as well as its bad side, and for that good is used: viz. to make wholesome and fit for use that which would otherwise be heavy and insalubrious. Another striking point of comparison is in the fact that leaven, as used ordinarily, is a<i> piece of the leavened loaf</i> put amongst the new dough, just as the Kingdom of Heaven is the renewal of humanity by the righteous Man Christ Jesus.
