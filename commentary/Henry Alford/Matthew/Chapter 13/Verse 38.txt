<b> 38.</b>] This verse has been variously interpreted, notwithstanding that its statements are so plain. The consideration of it will lead us into that of the general nature and place of the parable itself.<b> The field is the world</b>; if understood of the Church, then the Church only as<i> commensurate with the world, Go ye into</i><b> all the world</b>,<i> and preach the gospel to every creature</i> (Mark xvi. 15); THE CHURCH<i> standing for</i> THE WORLD, not, the<i> world</i> for the<i> Church</i>. And the parable has, like the former ones, its various references to various counter-workings of the Evil One against the grace of God. Its two principal references are, (1)<i> to the whole history of the world</i> from beginning to end; the coming of sin into the world by the malice of the devil,—the mixed state of mankind, notwithstanding the development of God’s purposes by the dispensations of grace—and the final separation of the good and evil at the end. The very declaration ‘the harvest is the<i> end</i> of the world’ suggests the original sowing as the<i> beginning</i> of it. Yet this sowing is not in the fact, as in the parable,<i> one only</i>, but repeated again and again.<br><br> In the parable the Lord gathers as it were the whole human race into<i> one lifetime</i>, as they will be gathered in one harvest, and sets that forth as simultaneous, which has been scattered over the ages of time. But (2) as applying principally to the<i> Kingdom of heaven</i>, which lay in the future and with the Lord’s incarnation, the parable sets forth to us<i> the universal sowing of</i> GOOD SEED<i> by the Gospel</i>: it sows<i> no bad seed</i>: all this is done by the enemy, and further we may not enquire. Soon, even as soon as Acts v. in the History of the Church, did the tares begin to appear; and in remarkable coincidence with the wheat bringing forth fruit (see Acts iv. 32–37). Again, see Acts xiii. 10, where Paul calls Elymas by the very name, “<i>son of the devil.</i>” And ever since, the same has been the case; throughout the whole world, where the Son of Man sows good seed, the Enemy sows tares. And<i> it is not the office</i>, however much it may be the desire, of the servants of the householder, the labourers in His field, to<i> collect or root up</i> these tares, to put them out of the world literally, or of the Church spiritually (save in some few exceptional cases, such as that in Acts v.);<i> this is reserved for another time and for other hands</i>,—for the<i> harvest</i>, the<i> end</i>; for the<i> reapers</i>, the<i> angels</i>. (3) It is also most important to notice that, as the Lord here gathers up ages into one season of seed time and harvest, so He also gathers up the various changes of human character and shiftings of human will into<i> two distinct classes</i>. We are not to suppose that the wheat can never become tares, or the tares wheat: this would be to contradict the purpose of Him who willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be converted and live; and this gracious purpose shines through the command “<i>let both grow together</i>”—let time be given (as above) for the<i> leaven to work</i>. As in the parable of the sower, the various classes were the<i> concentrations of various dispositions</i>, all of which are frequently found in one and the same individual, so here the line of demarcation between wheat and tares, so fixed and impassable<i> at last</i>, is<i> during the probation time</i>, the time of<i> growing together, not yet determined</i> by Him who<i> will have to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth</i>. In the very first example, that of our first parents, the good seed degenerated, but their restoration and renewal was implied in the promises made to them, indeed in their very punishment itself; and we their progeny are by nature the children of wrath, till renewed by the same grace. The parable is delivered by the Lord as<i> knowing all things</i>, and<i> describing by the final result</i>; and gives no countenance whatever to predestinarian error. (4) The parable has an historical importance, having been much in the mouths and writings of the Donatists, who, maintaining that the Church is a perfectly holy congregation, denied the applicability of this this Scripture to convict them of error, seeing that it is spoken not of the Church, but of the world: missing the deeper truth which would have led them to see that, after all, the world<i> is the Church</i>, only overrun by these very tares.<b> the good seed,</b><b> (these) are the sons</b> strikingly sets sets forth again the identity of the seed, in its growth, with those who are the<i> plants</i>: see above on ver. 19.<br><br><b> the sons of the kingdom</b>] not in the same sense as in ch. viii. 12,—SONS<i> there</i>, by covenant and external privilege:<i> here</i>,—by the effectual grace of adoption: the KINGDOM,<i> there</i>, in mere paradigm, on this imperfect earth:<i> here</i>, in its true accomplishment, in the new heavens and earth wherein dwelleth righteousness: but in their state among the tares, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God.
