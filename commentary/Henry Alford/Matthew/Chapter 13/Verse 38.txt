<b> 38.</b>] This verse has been variously interpreted, notwithstanding that its statements are so plain. The consideration of it will lead us into that of the general nature and place of the parable itself.<b> The field is the world</b>; if understood of the Church, then the Church only as<i> commensurate with the world, Go ye into</i><b> all the world</b>,<i> and preach the gospel to every creature</i> (Mark xvi. 15); THE CHURCH<i> standing for</i> THE WORLD, not, the<i> world</i> for the<i> Church</i>. And the parable has, like the former ones, its various references to various counter-workings of the Evil One against the grace of God. Its two principal references are, (1)<i> to the whole history of the world</i> from beginning to end; the coming of sin into the world by the malice of the devil,—the mixed state of mankind, notwithstanding the development of God’s purposes by the dispensations of grace—and the final separation of the good and evil at the end. The very declaration ‘the harvest is the<i> end</i> of the world’ suggests the original sowing as the<i> beginning</i> of it. Yet this sowing is not in the fact, as in the parable,<i> one only</i>, but repeated again and again.
