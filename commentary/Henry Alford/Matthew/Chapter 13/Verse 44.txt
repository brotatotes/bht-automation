<p><strong> 44.</strong> ] FIFTH PARABLE. THE HIDDEN TREASURE. <em> Peculiar to Matthew</em> . This and the following parable are closely connected, and refer to two distinct classes of persons who become possessed of the treasure of the Gospel. Notice that these, as also the seventh and last, are spoken <em> not to the multitude but to the disciples</em> .
	</p>
<p>In this parable, a man, labouring perchance for another, or by accident in passing, finds a treasure which has been hidden in a field; from joy at having found it he goes, and selling all he has, buys the field, thus (by the Jewish law) becoming the possessor also of the treasure. Such hiding of treasure is common even now, and was much more common in the East (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+41:8">Jeremiah 41:8</span> (cf. Hitzig in loc.): <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="job+3:21">Job 3:21</span> ; Pro 2:4 ).
	</p>
<p>This sets before us the case of a man who unexpectedly, without earnest seeking, finds, in some part of the outward Church, the treasure of true faith and hope and communion with God; and having found this, for joy of it he becomes possessor, not of the treasure without the field (for that the case supposes impossible) but of the field at all hazards, to secure the treasure which is in it: i.e. he possesses himself of the means of grace provided in that branch of the Church, where, to use a common expression, he has “gotten his good:” he makes that field his own.</p>
