We hear of no emotion, no great joy of heart, as before; but the same decision of conduct: he sells all and buys it. He chooses vital Christianity, at whatever cost, for his portion. But here is no<i> field</i>. The pearl is bought pure—by itself. It is found, not unexpectedly in the course of outward ordinances, with which therefore it would become to the finder inseparably bound up,—but by diligent search, spiritual and immediate, in its highest and purest form. Trench instances Nathanael and the Samaritan woman as examples of the finders without seeking:—Augustine, as related in his Confessions (we might add St. Paul, see Phil. iii. 7), of the diligent seeker and finder. Compare with this parable Prov. ii. 3–9, and to see what kind of buying is<i> not</i> meant, Isa. lv. 1: ch, xxv. 9, 10. Also see Rev. iii. 18.
