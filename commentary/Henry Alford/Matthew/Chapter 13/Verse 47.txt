<b> 47.</b>] The net spoken of is a drag, or<b> draw-net</b>, drawn over the bottom of the water, and permitting nothing to escape it. The leading idea of this parable is the ultimate separation of the holy and unholy in the Church, with a view to the selection of the former for the master’s use. We may notice that the<i> fishermen</i> are kept out of view and never mentioned: the comparison not extending to them. A net is cast into the sea and gathers of every kind (of<i> fish</i>: not of<i> things</i>, as mud, weeds, &c., as some suppose); when this is full, it is drawn to shore, and the good collected into vessels, while the bad (the legally unclean, those out of season, those putrid or maimed) are cast away. This net is the<i> Church gathering from the sea</i> (a common Scripture similitude for nations: see Rev. xvii. 15: Isa. viii. 7: Ps. lxv. 7)<i> of the world, all kinds</i> (see Rev. vii. 9); and when it is full, it is drawn to the<i> bank</i> (the limit of the ocean, as the<i> end</i> (literally,<i> consummation</i>] is the limit of the<i> world</i>, [literally,<i> age</i>]), and the<i> angels</i> (not the same as the fishers; for in the parable of the tares the<i> servants</i> and<i> reapers</i> are clearly distinguished) shall gather out the wicked from among the just, and cast them into everlasting punishment. It is plain that the comparison must not be strained beyond its limits, as our Lord shews us that the earthly here gives but a faint outline of the heavenly. Compare the mere “<i>cast</i><i> away</i>” of the one, with the fearful antitype of vv. 49, 50.<br><br> And this is true of<b> every</b> scribe:<i> Every</i> real spiritually-learned scribe of the Kingdom of Heaven is able, from the increasing stores of his genuine experimental knowledge of the word (not merely from books or learning, or the Bible itself, but<i> out of his treasure</i>), to bring forth things new and old.<br><br> The<b> therefore</b> is an expression of<i> consequence</i>, but not a strong one: answering nearly to our<b> Well, then</b>.<br><br> This is perhaps the fittest place to make a few<i> general remarks</i> on this wonderful cycle of Parables. We observe, (1) How naturally they are evolved from the objects and associations surrounding our Lord at the time (see on this the very interesting section of Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, ch. xiii.§2, p. 420 ff, “On the Parables”). He sat in a boat in the sea, teaching the people who were on the land. His eye wandered ever the rich plain of Gennesaret:—the field-paths, the stony places, the neglected spots choked with wild vegetation, the plots of rich and deep soil, were all before him. The same imagery prevails in the parable of the tares of the field, and in that of the mustard seed; and the result of the tilling of the land is associated with the leaven in the lump. Then He quits the sea-shore and enters the house with the disciples. There the link to the former parable is the exposition of the tares of the field. From the working of the land for seed to finding a treasure in a field the transition is easy—from the finding without seeking to seeking earnestly and finding, easy again: from the seed to the buried treasure, from the treasure to the pearl,—the treasure of the deep,—again simple and natural. The pearl recalls the sea; the sea the fishermen with their net; the mixed throng lining the beach, the great day of separation on the further bank of Time. (2) The seven Parables compose, in their inner depth of connexion, a great united whole, beginning with the first sowing of the Church, and ending with the consummation. We must not, as Stier well remarks, seek, with Bengel, &c., minutely to apportion the series prophetically, to various historical periods: those who have done so (see Trench, p. 142, edn. 4) have shewn caprice and inconsistency; and the<i> parable</i>, though in its manifold depths the light of prophecy sometimes glimmers, has for its main object to<i> teach</i>, not to foretell. More than a general outline, shewn by the prominence of those points to which the respective parables refer, in the successive periods of the Church, we can hardly expect to find. But as much we unquestionably do find. The apostolic age was (1) the greatest of all the seed times of the Church: then (2) sprang up the tares, heresies manifold, and the attempts to root them out, almost as pernicious as the heresies themselves: nay, the so-called<i> Church Catholic</i> was for ages employed in rooting up the wheat also. Notwithstanding this (3) the little seed waxed onward—the kingdoms of the earth came gradually in— (4) the leaven was secretly penetrating and assimilating. Then is it, (5) during the period of dissensions, and sects, and denominations, that here and there by this man and that man the treasure shall be found: then is it, (6) during the increase of secular knowledge and cultivation of the powers of the intellect, that merchantmen shall seek goodly pearls up and down the world, and many shall find, each for himself, the Pearl of Price. And thus we are carried on (7) through all the ages during which the great net has been gathering of every kind, to the solemn day of inspection and separation, which will conclude the present state.<br><br><b> 53, 54.</b>)<b> his own country</b>, viz. Nazareth. Perhaps the proceedings of ch. viii 18–ix. 34 are to be inserted between those two verses. In Mark iv. 35, the stilling of the storm and voyage to the Gadarenes are bound to the above parables by what appears a distinct note of sequence: ‘<i>the same day, when the even was come.</i>’ The teaching was on the Sabbath (Mark).
