<p><strong> 47.</strong> ] <strong> σαγήνη</strong> is a drag, or <strong> draw-net</strong> , drawn over the bottom of the water, and permitting nothing to escape it. The leading idea of this parable is the ultimate separation of the holy and unholy in the Church, with a view to the selection of the former for the master’s use. We may notice that the <em> fishermen</em> are kept out of view and never mentioned: the comparison not extending to them. A net is cast into the sea and gathers of every kind (of <em> fish:</em> not of <em> things</em> , as mud, weeds, &amp;c., as Stier supposes); when this is full, it is drawn to shore, and the good collected into vessels, while the bad (the legally unclean, those out of season, those putrid or maimed) are cast away. This net is the <em> Church gathering from the sea</em> (a common Scripture similitude for nations: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:7">Isaiah 8:7</span> ; Psa 65:7 ) <em> of the world, all kinds</em> (see Rev 7:9 ); and when it is full, it is drawn to the <em> bank</em> (the limit of the ocean, as the συντέλεια is the limit of the αἰών ), and the <em> angels</em> (not the same as the fishers, as Olshausen maintains; for in the parable of the tares the <em> servants</em> and <em> reapers</em> are clearly distinguished) shall gather out the wicked from among the just, and cast them into everlasting punishment. It is plain that the comparison must not be strained beyond its limits, as our Lord shews us that the earthly here gives but a faint outline of the heavenly. Compare the mere ἔξω ἔβαλον of the one, with the fearful antitype of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:49-50">Matthew 13:49-50</span> .
