<b> 55. his brethren</b>] It is an enquiry of much interest and some difficulty, who these were. After long examination of the evidence on the subjects I believe that the truth will best be attained by disencumbering the mind in the first place of all<i> à priori considerations</i>, and<i> traditions</i> (which last are very inconsistent and uncertain), and fixing the attention on the<i> simple testimony of Scripture itself</i>. I will trace “<i>His brethren,</i>” or “<i>the brethren of the Lord,</i>” through the various mentions of them in the N.T., and then state the result; placing at the end of the note the principal traditions on the subject, and the difficulties attending them. (I) The expression “<i>His brethren,</i>” occurs<i> nine times</i> in the Gospels, and<i> once</i> in the Acts. Of these the<i> three first</i> are in the narratives of the coming of His mother and brethren to speak with Him, Matt. xii. 46: Mark iii, 31: Luke viii. 19: the<i> two next</i> are the present passage and its||in Mark vi. 3, where they are mentioned in connexion with His mother and sisters; the<i> four others</i> are in John ii. 12; vii. 3, 5, 10; in the<i> first</i> of which He and his mother and brethren and disciples are related to have gone down to Capernaum: and in the<i> three last</i> His brethren are introduced as urging Him to shew Himself to the world, and it is stated that they did not believe on Him. The<i> last</i> is in Acts i. 14, where we read that the Apostles ‘continued in prayer and supplication with the women, and with Mary the mother of Jesus,<i> and with his brethren,</i>” In another place, 1 Cor. ix. 5, Paul mentions “<i>the other Apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas.</i>” Such are all the places where the meaning is<i> undoubted</i>, that persons called, and being in some usual sense,<i> brethren of the Lord</i>, are mentioned. (Besides these the Lord, Himself uses the words “<i>my brethren,</i>” Matt. xxviii. 10; John xx. 17, but apparently with a wider meaning, including at least the eleven Apostles in the term, as He does in Matt. xii. 49, and parallels.) Now I would observe (<i>a</i>) that in all the mentions of them in the Gospels, except those in John vii., they are<i> in connexion with His mother</i>: the same being the case in Acts i. 14. (<i>b</i>) That it is nowhere asserted or implied that any of them were<i> of the number of the Twelve</i>; but from John vii. 5, following upon vi. 70 (by “<i>after these things,</i>” vii. 1), they are<i> excluded from that number</i>. St. John would certainly not have used the words “<i>for neither did his brethren believe on him,</i>” had<i> any of them</i> believed on Him at that time (see this substantiated in note there):—and again in Acts i. 14, by being mentioned after the Apostles have been enumerated by name, and after the mother of Jesus, they are indicated at that time also to have been<i> separate from the twelve</i>, although,<i> then</i> certainly believing on Him. (<i>c</i>) Their<i> names</i>, as stated here and in Mark vi. 3, were JACOB (JAMES), JOSEPH, (or JOSES), SIMON, and JUDAS, all of them among the commonest of Jewish names. Of JOSEPH (or JOSES;— certainly not the Joseph Barnabas Justus of Acts i. 23: see ib. ver. 21) and SIMON (not Simon Cananæus or Zelotes: see above)<i> we know from Scripture nothing</i>. Of the<i> two others</i> we have the following traces— (<i>d</i>) JACOB (JAMES) appears in the apostolic narrative as<i> the Lord’s brother</i>, Gal. i. 19: he is there called an<i> apostle</i>. This however determines nothing as to his having been among<i> the Twelve</i> (which is a very different matter); for<i> Paul and Bareabas are called apostles</i>, Acts xiv. (4) 14, and Paul always calls himself such. See also Rom. xvi. 7; 1 Thess. ii. 7 compared with i. 1. That he is identical with the James of Gal. ii. 9, whom Paul mentions with Cephas and John as having given him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, fourteen years after the visit in ch. i. 19, does not appear for certain, but has been pretty generally assumed. (See this whole subject, discussed in the Introduction to the Epistle of James.) (<i>e</i>) The JUDE who has left an epistle, and was brother of James, not only does not call himself an apostle, ver. 1 (as neither does James, nor indeed John himself, so that this cannot be urged), but in ver. 17 (see note there) seems to draw 8 distinction between himself and the Apostles. Whether this indicates that the James and Jude, the authors of the Epistles, were two of these<i> brethren of the Lord</i>, is uncertain; but it may at least be mentioned in the course of our enquiry.
