<b> 55. his brethren</b>] It is an enquiry of much interest and some difficulty, who these were. After long examination of the evidence on the subjects I believe that the truth will best be attained by disencumbering the mind in the first place of all<i> à priori considerations</i>, and<i> traditions</i> (which last are very inconsistent and uncertain), and fixing the attention on the<i> simple testimony of Scripture itself</i>. I will trace “<i>His brethren,</i>” or “<i>the brethren of the Lord,</i>” through the various mentions of them in the N.T., and then state the result; placing at the end of the note the principal traditions on the subject, and the difficulties attending them. (I) The expression “<i>His brethren,</i>” occurs<i> nine times</i> in the Gospels, and<i> once</i> in the Acts. Of these the<i> three first</i> are in the narratives of the coming of His mother and brethren to speak with Him, Matt. xii. 46: Mark iii, 31: Luke viii. 19: the<i> two next</i> are the present passage and its||in Mark vi. 3, where they are mentioned in connexion with His mother and sisters; the<i> four others</i> are in John ii. 12; vii. 3, 5, 10; in the<i> first</i> of which He and his mother and brethren and disciples are related to have gone down to Capernaum: and in the<i> three last</i> His brethren are introduced as urging Him to shew Himself to the world, and it is stated that they did not believe on Him. The<i> last</i> is in Acts i. 14, where we read that the Apostles ‘continued in prayer and supplication with the women, and with Mary the mother of Jesus,<i> and with his brethren,</i>” In another place, 1 Cor. ix. 5, Paul mentions “<i>the other Apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas.</i>” Such are all the places where the meaning is<i> undoubted</i>, that persons called, and being in some usual sense,<i> brethren of the Lord</i>, are mentioned. (Besides these the Lord, Himself uses the words “<i>my brethren,</i>” Matt. xxviii. 10; John xx. 17, but apparently with a wider meaning, including at least the eleven Apostles in the term, as He does in Matt. xii. 49, and parallels.) Now I would observe (<i>a</i>) that in all the mentions of them in the Gospels, except those in John vii., they are<i> in connexion with His mother</i>: the same being the case in Acts i. 14. (<i>b</i>) That it is nowhere asserted or implied that any of them were<i> of the number of the Twelve</i>; but from John vii. 5, following upon vi. 70 (by “<i>after these things,</i>” vii. 1), they are<i> excluded from that number</i>. St. John would certainly not have used the words “<i>for neither did his brethren believe on him,</i>” had<i> any of them</i> believed on Him at that time (see this substantiated in note there):—and again in Acts i. 14, by being mentioned after the Apostles have been enumerated by name, and after the mother of Jesus, they are indicated at that time also to have been<i> separate from the twelve</i>, although,<i> then</i> certainly believing on Him. (<i>c</i>) Their<i> names</i>, as stated here and in Mark vi. 3, were JACOB (JAMES), JOSEPH, (or JOSES), SIMON, and JUDAS, all of them among the commonest of Jewish names. Of JOSEPH (or JOSES;— certainly not the Joseph Barnabas Justus of Acts i. 23: see ib. ver. 21) and SIMON (not Simon Cananæus or Zelotes: see above)<i> we know from Scripture nothing</i>. Of the<i> two others</i> we have the following traces— (<i>d</i>) JACOB (JAMES) appears in the apostolic narrative as<i> the Lord’s brother</i>, Gal. i. 19: he is there called an<i> apostle</i>. This however determines nothing as to his having been among<i> the Twelve</i> (which is a very different matter); for<i> Paul and Bareabas are called apostles</i>, Acts xiv. (4) 14, and Paul always calls himself such. See also Rom. xvi. 7; 1 Thess. ii. 7 compared with i. 1. That he is identical with the James of Gal. ii. 9, whom Paul mentions with Cephas and John as having given him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, fourteen years after the visit in ch. i. 19, does not appear for certain, but has been pretty generally assumed. (See this whole subject, discussed in the Introduction to the Epistle of James.) (<i>e</i>) The JUDE who has left an epistle, and was brother of James, not only does not call himself an apostle, ver. 1 (as neither does James, nor indeed John himself, so that this cannot be urged), but in ver. 17 (see note there) seems to draw 8 distinction between himself and the Apostles. Whether this indicates that the James and Jude, the authors of the Epistles, were two of these<i> brethren of the Lord</i>, is uncertain; but it may at least be mentioned in the course of our enquiry.<br><br> I shall now state the result of that enquiry, which has been based on Scripture testimony only. (1) That there were<i> four persons known as “His brethren,”</i> or “<i>the brethren of the Lord,</i>” NOT OF THE NUMBER OF THE TWELVE. (2) That these persons are found in all places (with the above exception) where their names occur in the Gospels,<i> in immediate connexion with Mary, the mother of the Lord</i>. [It is a strange phænomenon in argument, that it should have been maintained by an orthodox writer, that my inference from this<i> proves too much</i>, because Joseph is here introduced as<i> His father</i>: as if a mistake of the Jews with regard to a supernatural fact, which they could not know, invalidated their cognizance of a natural fact which they knew full well.] (3) That not a word is any where dropped to prevent us from inferring that these<i> brethren</i> were His relations<i> in the same literal sense</i> as we know<i> His mother</i> to have been; but that His own saying, where He distinguishes His relations according to the flesh from His disciples (ch. xii. 50 and parallels), seems to<i> sanction that inference</i>. (4) That nothing is said from which it can be inferred whether Joseph had been married before he appears in the Gospel history;—or again, whether these<i> brethren</i> were, according to the flesh, older or younger than our Lord. (5) That the silence of the Scripture narrative leaves it free for Christians to believe these to have been<i> real</i> (younger)<i> brethren and sisters of our Lord, without incurring any imputation of unsoundness of belief as to His miraculous conception</i>. That such an imputation has been cast, is no credit to the logical correctness of those who have made it, who set down that, because this view<i> has been taken</i> by impugners of the great Truth just mentioned,<i> therefore</i> it eventually leads, or may fairly be used towards the denial of it; for no attempt is made to shew its connexion with such a conclusion. The fact is, that the two matters, the<i> miraculous conception of the Lord Jesus</i> by the Holy Ghost, and<i> the subsequent virginity of His mother, are</i> ESSENTIALLY AND ENTIRELY DISTINCT; see note on Matt. i. 25: see also respecting a supposed difficulty attending this view, note on John xix. 27. (II) I will now state the principal<i> traditionary</i> views respecting the brethren of the Lord. (1) That they were<i> all sons of Alpheus</i> (or Clopas)<i> and Mary the sister of the mother of our Lord</i>; and so<i> cousins</i> of Jesus, and called agreeably to Jewish usage<i> His brothers</i>. This is the view taken in a remarkable fragment of Papias, adopted by Jerome, and very generally received in ancient and modern times. But it seems to me that a comparison of the Scripture testimonies cited above will prove it untenable. One at least of the sons of this Alphæus was an apostle,<i> of the number of the twelve</i>, viz. James the son of Alphæus (see all the lists, on ch. x. 3); which (see above) would<i> exclude him from the number of the brethren of the Lord</i>. But even if<i> one</i> of the four could be thus detached (which, from John vii. 5, I cannot believe), it is generally assumed that “<i>Judas of James</i>” (so in the Greek) (see Luke’s two lists as above) is Jude the<i> brother</i> of James; and if so, this would be<i> another</i> son of Alphæus, and another subtraction from the number who did not believe on Hin. Again Matthew (see note on Matt. ix. 9), if identical with Levi (Mark ii. 14), was<i> another son of Alpheus</i>; which would make a fifth brother, and leave therefore,<i> out of five, three believing on Him at the time when it was said, “neither did his brethren believe on Him.”</i> This view besides labours under the difficulty arising from these brethren accompanying and being found in connexion with Mary the mother of our Lord, whereas throughout that time<i> their own mother was living</i>. The way in which the assertors of this view explain John vii. 5, is either by supposing that all the brethren are not<i> there</i> implied, or that all are not<i> here</i> mentioned; both suppositions, it seems to me, very unlikely (compare e.g. John’s minute accuracy where an exception was to be made, ch. vi. 23, 24). (2) That they were<i> children of Joseph by a former marriage</i> (or even by a later one with Mary wife of Clopas, to raise up seed to his dead<i> brother</i>,—as Clopas is said to have been: but this needs no refutation). This view was taken by several early Fathers, and mentioned by Origen, who says respecting it, “<i>those who maintain this, wish to uphold the perpetual virginity of Mary.</i>” This however, while<i> by no means impossible</i>, and in some respects agreeing with the<i> apparent</i> position of these brothers as older (according to the flesh) than the Lord (John vii. 3), has no countenance whatever in Scripture, either in their being called sons of any other woman, or in any distinct mention of Joseph as their father, which surely in this case would be required. (III) On the<i> à priori considerations</i> which have influenced opinions on this matter, see note on Matt. i. 25; and on the<i> traditional literature</i>, see the references given in my Greek Testament. Neander brings out the importance of the view which I have above, under (I), endeavoured to justify, asshewing that the account of the miraculous conception is<i> not mythical</i>, in which case all would have been arranged to suit the views of virginity from which it had arisen,—but<i> strictly historical</i>, found as it is with no such arrangements or limitations.
