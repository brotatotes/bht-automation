	 βαρέως ἤκουσαν  , heard heavily,  sluggishly and imperfectly .
	 ἐκάμμυσαν  , closed (Heb. ‘  smeared over ’)  their eyes. All this have they done: all this is increased in them by their continuing to do it, and all lest they should (and so that they cannot) hear, see, understand, and be saved.

This citation gives no countenance to the fatalist view of the passage, but rests the whole blame on the hard-heartedness and unreadiness of the hearers, which is of itself the cause why the very preaching of the word is a means of further darkening and condemning them (see 2Co 4:3-4 ). On the fut. indic. after μήποτε , “verentis ne quid futurum sit, sed indicantis simul, putare se ita futurum esse ut veretur,” see Winer, § 56. 2: Herm. ad Soph. Aj. 272.
