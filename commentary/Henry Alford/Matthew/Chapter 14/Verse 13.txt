<b> 13.</b>] There is some difficulty here in conceiving how the narration is to proceed continuously. The death of the Baptist is evidently retrospectively and parenthetically inserted; and yet the retirement of our Lord in this verse seems to be the immediate consequence of his hearing of that occurrence. But this may well have been so: for (1) the disciples of John would be some days in bringing the news from Machærus to Capernaum, and the report mentioned in ver. 1 might reach Herod meantime; (2) the expression with which that report is introduced, “<i>At that time,</i>” extends it over a considerable space of time; and (3) the message which the disciples of John brought to our Lord wight have included both particulars, the death of their Master, and the saying of Herod respecting Himself.
