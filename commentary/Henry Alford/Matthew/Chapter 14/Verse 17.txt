it was<i> Andrew who spoke</i> in ver. 17, and the five loaves and two fishes were<i> brought by a lad</i>: John vi. 8, 9. They were<i> barley loaves</i> and<i> (salt) fish</i>; ibid. And we have (perhaps, but see note there) the vast concourse accounted for in John by the fact that the<i> Passover was at hand</i>, and so they were collected on their journey to Jerusalem.<br><br> See a very similar miracle in 2 Kings iv. 42â€“44; only then there were twenty barley loaves and an hundred men. See also Numbers xi. 21, 22.
