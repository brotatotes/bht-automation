<b> 19. blessed</b>] St. Luke supplies “<i>them</i>,” i.e. the loaves and fishes: St. John has for it<b> gave thanks</b>. Both are one. The thanks to heaven is the blessing on the meat. This miracle was one of symbolic meaning for the Twelve, who had just returned from their mission, as pointing to the “<i>freely ye received, freely give</i>” of ch. x. 8 in a higher sense than they then could have understood it:—but see the symbolic import of the miracle treated in the notes to John vi.<br><br> Meyer well remarks, that the<i> process</i> of the miracle is thus to be conceived:—the Lord blessed, and gave the loaves and fishes to the disciples,<i> as they were</i>; and then,<i> during their distribution of them</i>, the miraculous increase took place, so that they broke and distributed enough for all. The<i> cophinus</i> (which is the word here rendered<i> basket</i>) was the usual accompaniment of the Jew: see quotation from Juvenal in my Gr. Test. Reland supposes that the basket was to carry their own meats on a journey, for fear of pollution by eating those of the Gentiles.
