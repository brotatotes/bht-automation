In Luke ix. 7 it is said that Herod<i> was perplexed because it was said of some that John was risen from the dead</i>. There is no inconsistency in these accounts: the report originated with others: but if Herod was perplexed concerning it, he, in the terrors of a guilty conscience; doubtless gave utterance to these words himself. There is no evidence that Herod was a Sadducee, or a disbeliever in the resurrection as then held by the Pharisees. See also note on Mark viii. 14.<br><br> There is no allusion here to the transmigration of souls, but to the veritable bodily resurrection, and supposed greater power acquired by having passed through death. This is an incidental confirmation of John x. 41, where we read that John<i> wrought no miracle while living</i>.
