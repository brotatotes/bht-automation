<b> 2.</b>]<b> he himself</b> is emphatic; equivalent in English to “<i>it is he and no other, that</i>”... In Luke ix. 7 it is said that Herod<i> was perplexed because it was said of some that John was risen from the dead</i>. There is no inconsistency in these accounts: the report originated with others: but if Herod was perplexed concerning it, he, in the terrors of a guilty conscience; doubtless gave utterance to these words himself. There is no evidence that Herod was a Sadducee, or a disbeliever in the resurrection as then held by the Pharisees. See also note on Mark viii. 14.
