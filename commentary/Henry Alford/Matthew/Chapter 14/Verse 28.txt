<b> 28.</b>] This narrative respecting Peter is peculiar to Matthew. It is in very strict accordance with his warm and confident character, and has been called almost a ‘rehearsal’ of his denial afterwards. It contains one of the most pointed and striking revelations which we have of<i> the nature and analogy of faith</i>; and a notable example of the power of the higher spiritual state of man over the inferior laws of matter, so often brought forward by oy Lord. See ch. xvii. 20; xxi. 21.
