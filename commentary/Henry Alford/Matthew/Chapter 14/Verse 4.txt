 4. ] The marriage was unlawful for these three reasons: (1)  The former husband of Herodias , Philip,  was still living . This is expressly asserted by Josephus, Antt. xviii. 5. 4, Ἡρωδιάς , ἐπὶ συγχύσει φρονήσασα τῶν πατρίων , Ἡρώδῃ γαμεῖται τοῦ ἀνδρὸς τῷ ὁμοπατρίῳ ἀδελφῷ ,  διαστᾶσα ζῶντος . (A reply to the attempt made by some to interpret these last words, ‘  having previously been divorced from him while living ,’ is hardly needed, in the presence of the two unqualified synchronous participles, φρονήσασα and διαστᾶσα . Besides, the part.  is not  ἀπο στᾶσα ,  as erroneously quoted by the  Bp. of Exeter [Philpotts]: see his published speech of Feb. 25, 1851, note.) The same is surely implied by the whole narrative, and the word μετοικίσασθαι , Antt. xviii. 5. 1. (2)  The former wife of Antipas was still living , and fled to her father Aretas on hearing of his intention to marry Herodias: Jos. ibid. (3)  Antipas and Herodias were already related to one another within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity . For θυγάτηρ ἦν Ἀριστοβούλου , καὶ οὗτος ἀδελφὸς αὐτῶν (of Antipas and Philip), Jos. ib. See the Bp.’s note, and a reply to it in substance the same as the foregoing, in the Quarterly Journal of Sacred Lit. for Oct. 1852 and Jan. 1853. I may add that the remark of Josephus (Antt. xviii. 5. 4), that Salome’s birth had taken place previously to the infidelity of Herodias, is not given, as understood by the Bp. (after Tertullian, adv. Marcion. iv. 34, vol. ii. p. 443), as the technical reason why her conduct was ἐπὶ συγχύσει τῶν πατρίων , but as a moral aggravation of her unnatural crime. It was unlawful by Leviticus 18:16 .
