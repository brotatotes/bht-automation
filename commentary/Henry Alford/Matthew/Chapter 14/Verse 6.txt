<p><strong> 6. </strong> <strong> γενεσίοις</strong> ] <strong> the birthday.</strong> This name was given in classical Greek to <em> an anniversary celebration of the memory of the dead</em> . So Herod., iv. 26, having described such a celebration among the Issedones, adds, παῖς δὲ πατρὶ τοῦτο ποιέει κατάπερ οἱ Ἕλληνες τὰ <strong> γενέσια</strong> . Phrynichus, Hesych [134] , and Ammonius lay it down that γενέσια is <em> not to be used for</em> γενέθλια , a <em> birthday</em> . But the adj. was certainly so used in later Greek: e.g. ἄγοντες τ . γενέσιον ἡμέραν τ . παιδίου , Jos. Antt. xii. 4. 7 (in Dio Cassius xlvii. 18, lvi. 46, lxvii. 2, usually cited, the γενέσια , though bearing this meaning, are in each case in honour of a <em> dead</em> person). See Suicer, Thes. under γενέθλια , and Lobeck’s note, Phryn. p. 103. Heins., Grot., a [135] ., hold that the word here means the feast of Herod’s <em> accession:</em> but they give no proof that it ever had such a meaning. Among the seasons kept by the Gentiles, enumerated in the Rabbinical work Avoda Sara, we have גנוסיא של מלכים : see Lightfoot in loc. [On the dative “compare the examples quoted by Jelf, § 699.” Moulton’s Winer, p. 276, note 1.]

<p>A great feast was given to the nobility of Galilee, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:21">Mark 6:21</span> . The damsel’s name was Salome (Jos. Antt. xviii. 5. 4), daughter of Herodias by her former husband Philip. She afterwards married her uncle Philip, tetrarch of Ituræa and Trachonitis: and he dying childless, she became the wife of her cousin Aristobulus, son of Herod king of Chalcis, by whom he had three sons, Herod, Agrippa, and Aristobulus. The dance was probably a pantomimic dance.</p>
