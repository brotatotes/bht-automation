A great feast was given to the nobility of Galilee, Mark vi. 21. The damsel’s name was Salome, daughter of Herodias by her former husband Philip. She afterwards married her uncle Philip, tetrarch of Ituræa and Trachonitis: and he dying childless, she became the wife of her cousin Aristobulus son of Herod, king of Chalcis, by whom she had three sons, Herod, Agrippa, and Aristobulus.
