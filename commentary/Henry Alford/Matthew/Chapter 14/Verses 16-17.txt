 16, 17. ]  δότε αὐτοῖς ὑμεῖς φ  ., which is common to the three first Evangelists, is considerably expanded in the more detailed account of John 3:1-36 ; John 4:1-54 ; John 5:1-47 ; John 6:1-71 ; John 7:1-53 ; it was  Andrew who spoke in our Matthew 14:17 , and the five loaves and two fishes were  brought by a lad: John 6:8-9 . They were  barley loaves and (  salt )  fish; ibid. And we have (perhaps, but see note there) the vast concourse accounted for in John by the fact that  the Passover was at hand , and so they were collected on their journey to Jerusalem.
	See a very similar miracle in 2 Kings 4:42-44 ; only then there were twenty barley loaves and an hundred men. See also Numbers 11:21-22 .
