<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] The <strong> plant</strong> is the teaching of the Pharisees, altogether of human, and not of divine planting. That this is so, is clear by ἄφετε αὐτούς following, and by the analogy of our Lord’s parabolic symbolism, in which <em> seed, plant</em> , &amp;c., are compared to <em> doctrine</em> , which however in its growth becomes identified with, and impersonated by, its recipients and disseminators. See this illustrated in notes on the parable of the sower, ch. 13 ‘ φυτόν , naturâ: φυτεία , curâ.’ Bengel.
