<b> 22. a Canaanitish woman of those districts came out</b>] i.e. from her house, or town, or village. They were going by the way, see ver. 23.<br><br> The inhabitants of these parts are called Canaanites, Num. xiii. 29; Judg. i. 30, 32, 33; Exod. vi. 15; Josh. v. 1. St. Mark calls her “<i>a Greek,</i>” i.e. a heathen by religion, and “<i>a Syro-Phenician by nation:</i>” and describes her only as having come to our Lord<i> in the house</i>. But by the account in our text, she had been crying after the Lord and the disciples by the way previously; and St. Mark’s account must be understood to begin at ver. 25. From Mark iii. 8, Luke vi. 17, we learn that, the fame of our Lord had been spread in these parts, and multitudes from thence had come to Him for healing. It was not this woman’s dwelling-place, but her<i> descent</i>, which placed the bar between her and our Lord’s ministrations. The expression “<i>Son of David</i>” shews her acquaintance with Jewish expressions and expectations; but the whole narrative is against the supposition, that she may have been a proselyte of the gate.
