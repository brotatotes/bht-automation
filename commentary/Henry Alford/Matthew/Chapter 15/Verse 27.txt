<b> 27.</b>] The sense of the original is not given by ‘<i>yet</i>’ in the E.V. The woman, in her humility,<i> accepts</i> the appellation which our Lord gives her, and<i> grounds her plea upon an inference from it</i>. Her words also have a reference to “<i>let the children first be filled,</i>” expressed by Mark vii. 27. It is,<b> Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat:</b> or,<b> for the dogs too eat</b>. Our Lord, in the<br><br> use of the familiar diminutive, has expressed not the<i> uncleanness</i> of the dog 20 much, as his<i> attachment to and dependence on the human family</i>: she lays hold on this favourable point and makes it her own, ‘If we are dogs, then may we fare as such;—be fed with the crumbs of Thy mercy.’ She was, as it were, under the edge of the table—close on the confines of Israel’s feast. Some say that the<i> crumbs</i> are the pieces of bread on which the hands were wiped; but the “<i>which fall</i>” looks more like accidental falling, and the Greek word better expresses<i> minute</i> crumbs.
