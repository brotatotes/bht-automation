<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] The sense of <strong> καὶ γάρ</strong> is not given by ‘ <em> yet</em> ’ in the E. V. The woman, in her humility, <em> accepts</em> the appellation which our Lord gives her, and <em> grounds her plea upon an inference from it</em> . Her words also have a reference to ἄφες πρῶτον χορτασθῆναι τὰ τέκνα , expressed by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:27">Mark 7:27</span> . The Vulgate has rightly, ‘Etiam Domine: <em> nam et</em> catelli edunt.’ <strong> Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat:</strong> or, <strong> for the dogs too eat</strong> Our Lord in the use of the familiar diminutive, has expressed not the <em> uncleanness</em> of the dog so much, as his <em> attachment to and dependence on the human family:</em> she lays hold on this favourable point and makes it her own, ‘if we are dogs, then may we fare as such; be fed with the crumbs of Thy mercy.’ She was, as it were, under the edge of the table close on the confines of Israel’s feast.

<p>Some say that the ψίχια are the pieces of bread on which the hands were wiped, εἰς ὃ τὰς χεῖρας ἀποματτόμενοι εἶτα κυσὶν ἔβαλλον (Eustathius, cited by Trench on Mir. p. 342); but the πιπτόντων looks more like accidental falling, and the ψίχια like minute crumbs.</p>
