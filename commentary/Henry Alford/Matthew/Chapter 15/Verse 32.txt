<b> 32.</b>] The modern German interpreters assume the identity of this miracle with that narrated in ch. xiv. 14 ff. If this be so, then our Evangelists must have<i> invented</i> the speech attributed to our Lord in ch. xvi. 9, 10. But as Ebrard justly remarks, every circumstance which could vary, does vary, i in the two accounts. The situation in the wilderness, the kind of food at hand, the blessing and breaking, and distributing by means of the disciples, these are<i> common to the two accounts</i>, and were likely to be so: but<i> here</i> the matter is introduced by our Lord Himself with an expression of pity for the multitudes who had continued with Him three days: here also the provision is greater, the numbers are less than on the former occasion. But there is one small token of authenticity which marks these two accounts as referring to two distinct events, even had we not such direct testimony as that of ch. xvi. 9, 10. It is, that whereas the baskets in which the fragments were collected on the other occasion are called by all four Evangelists<i> cophini</i>, those used for that purpose after this miracle are in both Matt. and Mark<i> spyrides</i>. And when our Lord refers to the two miracles,<i> the same distinction is observed</i>; a particularity which could not have arisen except as pointing to a matter of fact, that, whatever the distinction be, which is uncertain, different kinds of baskets were used on the two occasions, Perhaps the strangest reason for supposing the two identical is an imagined difficulty in the questions of the disciples, “<i>Whence should we have</i>”&c., so soon after the former miracle; as if the same slowness to believe and trust in divine power were not repeatedly found among men, and instanced in Scripture itself;—compare Exod. xvi. 13 with Num. xi. 21, 22: and read in Exod. xvii. 1–7 the murmurings of the Israelites immediately after their deliverance at the Red Sea. And even could we recognize this as a difficulty, it is not necessarily implied in the text. Our Lord puts the matter to them as a question, without the slightest intimation of His intention to supply the want supernaturally. They make answer in the same spirit, without venturing (as indeed it would have been most unbecoming in them to do, see John ii. 3, 4) to suggest the working of a miracle.
