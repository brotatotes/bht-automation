Marco præmissa, p. 413) shews  Magdala to have been only a sabbathday’s journey from Chamnath Gadara on the Jordan, and on the east side of the lake: but probably he is mistaken, for most travellers (see Winer, Realwörterbuch, in v.) place it about three miles from Tiberias, on the west side of the lake, where is now a village named Madschel.  Dalmanutha , mentioned by Mark ( Mar 8:10 ), seems to have been a village in the neighbourhood.
