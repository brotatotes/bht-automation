 5. ] Lightfoot on this verse shews that the expression cited by our Lord did not always bind the utterer to consecrate his property to religious uses, but was by its mere utterance sufficient to absolve him from the duty of caring for his parents: see further on the word Corban in Mark 7:11 . The construction of this and the following ver. is:  But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, That from which thou mightest have been benefited by me, is an offering (consecrated to God; see above).… (understand,  is free ). [  And ]  such an one will certainly not honour his father [  or his mother ]. So [138] Mark, οὐκέτι ἀφίετε κ . τ . λ .
	 [138] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
	The joining of [ καὶ ] οὐ μὴ κ . τ . λ . to the ὃς ἄν above, and making the aposiopesis after μητ . αὐτοῦ , is inconsistent with the usage of οὐ μή , which contains in itself an apodosis, being an elliptical construction for οὐ δέος μή or the like; see Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. p. 155 ff. The  future ind . after οὐ μή makes the certainty more apparent: so καὶ τοῦτο γὰρ εὖ εἰδέναι χρὴ ὅτι οὐ μὴ δυνήσεται Κῦρος εὑρεῖν .… Xen. Cyr. viii. 1. 5. See more examples in Hartung, ib. Of course the apodosis is  our Lord’s saying, not that of the Pharisees.
