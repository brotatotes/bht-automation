<b> 5.</b>] Lightfoot on this verse shews that the expression cited by our Lord did not always bind the utterer to consecrate his property to religious uses, but was by its mere utterance sufficient to absolve him from the duty of caring for his parents: see further on the word Corban in Mark vii. 11. The construction of this and the following verse is:<b> But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, That from which thou mightest have been benefited by me, is an offering</b> (consecrated to God; see above).... (understand,<b> is free</b>).<b> [And] such an one will certainly not honour his [father or his mother]</b>.
