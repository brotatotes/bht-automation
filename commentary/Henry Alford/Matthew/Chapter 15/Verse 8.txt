 8. ] The portion of Isaiah from which this citation is made (ch. 24 35) sets forth, in alternate threatenings and promises, the punishment of the mere nominal Israel, and the salvation of the true Israel of God. And, as so often in the prophetic word, its threats and promises are for all times of the Church; the particular event then foretold being but one fulfilment of those deeper and more general declarations of God, which shall be ever having their successive illustrations in His dealings with men.
	The prophecy is nearly according to the LXX, which compare. The citation in Mark is (if the spurious words in the rec [139] . here be cancelled) verbatim the same with that in the text. Stier however maintains (vol. ii. p. 142) that the words in question ought to be supplied in Mark, because ἐγγίζει is wanted to oppose to πόῤῥω ἀπέχει , and στόματι to connect with στόμα in Matthew 15:11 .
