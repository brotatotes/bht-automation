 1.   σημεῖον ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ] see notes at ch. Matthew 12:38 . There is no ground for supposing that this narrative refers to the same event as that. What can be more natural than that the adversaries of our Lord should have met His miracles again and again with this demand of a sign  from heaven? For in the Jewish superstition it was held that dæmons and false gods could give signs  on earth , but only the true God signs  from heaven . In the apocryphal Epistle of Jeremiah, 16:67, we read of the gods of the heathen, σημεῖά τε ἐν ἔθνεσιν ἐν οὐρανῷ οὐ μὴ δείξωσιν .… And for such a notion they alleged the bread from heaven given by Moses (see Joh 6:31 ), the staying of the sun by Joshua ( Jos 10:12 ), the thunder and rain by Samuel (1 Samuel 12:17 , compare Jer 14:22 ), and Elijah ( Jam 5:17-18 ). And thus we find that immediately after the first miraculous feeding the same demand was made, John 6:30 , and answered by the declaration of our Lord that He was the true bread from heaven. And what more natural likewise, than that our Lord should have uniformly met the demand by the same answer, the  sign of Jonas , one so calculated to baffle his enemies and hereafter to fix the attention of His disciples? Here however that answer is accompanied by other rebukes sufficiently distinctive.
	It was now probably the evening (see Mark 8:10 , εὐθύς ) and our Lord was looking on the glow in the west which suggested the remark in Matthew 16:2 . On the practice of the Jews to  demand a sign , see 1 Corinthians 1:22 .
