<b> 13. Cæsarea Philippi</b>] A town in Gaulonitis at the foot of Mount Libanus, not far from the source of the Jordan, a day’s journey from Sidon, once called Laish (Judg. xviii. 7, 29) and afterwards Dan (ibid.), but in later times Paneas, or Panias, from the mountain Panium, under which it lay. The tetrarch Philip enlarged it and gave it the name of Cæsarea. In after times King Agrippa further enlarged it and called it Neronias in honour of the Emperor Nero. This must not be confounded with the Cæsarea of the Acts, which was Cæsarea Stratonis, on the Mediterranean. See Acts x. 1, and note. The following enquiry took place<i> by the way</i>, Mark viii. 27. St. Luke gives it without note of place, but states it to have been asked on the disciples joining our Lord, who was praying alone, Luke ix. 18.<br><br> The reading of the last words of the verse is somewhat uncertain. Some of the oldest authorities have,<b> Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</b> Some would render as if our Lord had said, ‘W<i> ho say men that I am? the Son of Man?</i>’ i.e.<i> the Messiah?</i> but this is inadmissible, for the answer would not then have been expressed as it is, but<i> affirmatively</i> or<i> negatively</i>. Equally inadmissible is Olshausen’s rendering, ‘Me, who am, as ye are aware, the Son of Man?’ an expression, Olshausen says, by which the disciples would be led to the idea of the<i> Son of God</i>. But then this would destroy the simplicity of the following question,<b> But who say ye that I am?</b> because it would put into their mouths the answer intended to be given. The A.V. has beyond doubt the right rendering of<i> this reading</i>: and<b> the Son of Man</b> is a pregnant expression, which we now know to imply the<i> Messiahship in the root of our human nature</i>, and which even then was taken by the Jews as =<i> the Son of God</i>, (see Luke xxii. 69, 70,) which would serve as a test of the faith of the disciples, according to their understanding of it.
