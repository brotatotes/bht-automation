<b> 13. Cæsarea Philippi</b>] A town in Gaulonitis at the foot of Mount Libanus, not far from the source of the Jordan, a day’s journey from Sidon, once called Laish (Judg. xviii. 7, 29) and afterwards Dan (ibid.), but in later times Paneas, or Panias, from the mountain Panium, under which it lay. The tetrarch Philip enlarged it and gave it the name of Cæsarea. In after times King Agrippa further enlarged it and called it Neronias in honour of the Emperor Nero. This must not be confounded with the Cæsarea of the Acts, which was Cæsarea Stratonis, on the Mediterranean. See Acts x. 1, and note. The following enquiry took place<i> by the way</i>, Mark viii. 27. St. Luke gives it without note of place, but states it to have been asked on the disciples joining our Lord, who was praying alone, Luke ix. 18.
