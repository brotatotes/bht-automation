<b> 14.</b>] It is no contradiction to this verdict that some called him<i> the Son of David</i> (ch. ix. 27; xii. 23; xv. 22); for either these were or were about to become His disciples, or are quoted as examples of rare faith, or as in ch. xii, 23, it was the passing doubt on the minds of the multitude, not their settled opinion. The same may be said of John vii. 26, 31; iv. 42. On our Lord’s being taken for John the Baptist, see ch. xiv. 2, from which this would appear to be the opinion of the<i> Herodians</i>.<br><br><b> one of the prophets</b>] “<i>that one of the old prophets is risen again,</i>” Luke ix. 19. It was not a metempsychosis, but a bodily resurrection which was believed. On Elias, see note at ch. xi. 14. Jeremiah is mentioned first as being accounted by the Jews first in the prophetic canon. The confession is not made in the terms of the other answer: it is not ‘we say’ or ‘I say,’ but<b> Thou art</b>. It is the expression of: an inward conviction wrought by God’s Spirit. The excellence of this confession is, that it brings out both the human and the divine nature of the Lord:<b> the Christ</b> is the Messiah, the Son of David, the anointed King:<b> the Son of the living God</b> is the Eternal Son, begotten of the Eternal Father, not ‘Son of God’ in any inferior figurative sense, not<i> one of</i> the sons of God, of angelic nature, but THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD, having in Him the Sonship and the divine nature<i> in a sense in which they could be in none else</i>. This was a view of the Person of Christ quite distinct from the Jewish Messianic idea, which appears to have been that he should be a man born from men, but selected by God for the office on account of his eminent virtues. This distinction accounts for the solemn blessing pronounced in the next verse.
