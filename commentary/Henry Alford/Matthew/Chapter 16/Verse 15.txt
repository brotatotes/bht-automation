The confession is not made in the terms of the other answer: it is not ‘we say’ or ‘I say,’ but<b> Thou art</b>. It is the expression of: an inward conviction wrought by God’s Spirit. The excellence of this confession is, that it brings out both the human and the divine nature of the Lord:<b> the Christ</b> is the Messiah, the Son of David, the anointed King:<b> the Son of the living God</b> is the Eternal Son, begotten of the Eternal Father, not ‘Son of God’ in any inferior figurative sense, not<i> one of</i> the sons of God, of angelic nature, but THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD, having in Him the Sonship and the divine nature<i> in a sense in which they could be in none else</i>. This was a view of the Person of Christ quite distinct from the Jewish Messianic idea, which appears to have been that he should be a man born from men, but selected by God for the office on account of his eminent virtues. This distinction accounts for the solemn blessing pronounced in the next verse.
