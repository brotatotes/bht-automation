 16. ] τί οὖν τὸ στόμα τῶν ἀποστόλων ὁ Πέτρος , ὁ πανταχοῦ θερμός , ὁ τοῦ χοροῦ τῶν ἀποστόλων κορυφαῖος ; πάντων ἐρωτηθέντων αὐτὸς ἀποκρίνεται , Chrysost. Hom. liv. 1, p. 546. The confession is not made in the terms of the other answer: it is not ‘we say’ or ‘I say,’ but  Thou art. It is the expression of an inward conviction wrought by God’s Spirit. The excellence of this confession is, that it brings out both the human and the divine nature of the Lord:  ὁ χριστός is the Messiah, the Son of David, the anointed King:  ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ζῶντος is the Eternal Son, begotten of the Eternal Father, not ‘Son of God’ in any inferior figurative sense, not  one of the sons of God, of angelic nature, but THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD, having in Him the Sonship and the divine nature  in a sense in which they could be in none else . This was a view of the Person of Christ quite distinct from the Jewish Messianic idea, which appears to have been (Justin Mart. Dial. § 48, p. 144) that he should be a man born from men, but selected by God for the office on account of his eminent virtues. This distinction accounts for the solemn blessing pronounced in the next verse.
	 τοῦ ζῶντος must not for a moment be taken here as it sometimes is used, (e.g. ref. Acts,) as merely distinguishing the true God from dead idols; it is here emphatic, and imparts force and precision to  υἱός  .
	That Peter, when he uttered the words, understood by them in detail all that we now understand, is not of course here asserted: but that they were his testimony to the true Humanity and true Divinity of the Lord, in that sense of deep truth and reliance, out of which springs the Christian life of the Church.
