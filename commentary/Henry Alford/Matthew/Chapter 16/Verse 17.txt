<b> 17.</b>]<b> Blessed art thou</b>, as in ch. v. 4, &c., is a solemn expression of blessing, an inclusion of him to whom it is addressed in the kingdom of heaven, not a mere word of praise. And the reason of it is, the fact that the Father had revealed the Son to him (see ch. xi. 25–27); cf. Gal. i. 15, 16, in which passage the occurrence of the word “<i>reveal</i>” seems to indicate a reference to this very saying of the Lord. The whole declaration of St. Paul in that chapter forms a remarkable parallel to the character and promise given to St. Peter in our text,—as establishing Paul’s claim to be another such<i> rock</i> or<i> pillar</i> as Peter and the other great Apostles, because the Son had been revealed in him not of man nor by men, but by God Himself. The name<b> Simon Bar-jona</b> is doubtless used as indicating his fleshly state and extraction, and forming the greater contrast to his spiritual state, name, and blessing, which follow. The same ‘Simon son of Jonas’ is uttered when he is reminded, by the thrice repeated enquiry, ‘Lovest thou me?’ of his frailty, in his previous denial of his Lord.
