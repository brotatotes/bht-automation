<b> 18.</b>] The name<b> Peter</b> (not now first given, but prophetically bestowed by our Lord on His first interview with Simon, John i. 43) or<i> Cephas</i>, signifying a rock, the termination being only altered from Petra to Petros to suit the masculine appellation, denotes the<i> personal position of this Apostle in the building of the Church of Christ</i>. He was the first of those<i> foundation-stones</i> (Rev. xxi. 14) on which the living temple of God was built: this building itself beginning on the day of Pentecost by the laying of<i> three thousand living stones</i> on this very foundation. That this is the simple and only interpretation of the words of our Lord, the whole usage of the New Testament shews: in which not doctrines nor confessions, but<i> men</i>, are uniformly the pillars and stones of the spiritual building. See 1 Pet. ii. 4–6: 1 Tim. iii. 15 (where the pillar is not Timotheus, but the congregation of the faithful) and note: Gal. ii. 9: Eph. ii. 20: Rev. iii. 12. And it is on Peter, as by divine revelation making this confession, as thus under the influence of the Holy Ghost, as standing out before the Apostles in the strength of this faith, as himself founded on the one foundation,<b> Jesus Christ</b>, 1 Cor. iii. 11—that the Jewish portion of the Church was built, Acts ii.—v., and the Gentile, Acts x., xi. After this last event, we hear little of him; but during this, the first building time, he is never lost sight of: see especially Acts i. 15; ii. 14, 37; iii. 12; iv. 8; v. 15, 29; ix. 34, 40; x. 25, 26. We may certainly exclaim with Bengel, “<i>All this may be said with safety; for what has this to do with Rome?</i>” Nothing can be further from any legitimate interpretation of this promise, than the idea of a perpetual primacy in the successors of Peter; the very notion of<i> succession</i> is precluded by the form of the comparison, which concerns the person, and<i> him</i> only, so fur as it involves a<i> direct</i> promise. In its other and general sense, as applying to all those living stones (Peter’s own expression for members of Christ’s Church) of whom the Church should be built, it implies, as Origen excellently comments on it, saying, that all this must be understood as said not only to Peter, as in the letter of the Gospel, but to every one who is such as Peter here shewed himself, as the spirit of the Gospel teaches us. The application of the promise to St. Peter has been elaborately impugned by Dr. Wordsworth. His zeal to appropriate the rock to Christ has somewhat overshot itself. In arguing that the term can apply to none but God, he will find it difficult surely to deny all reference to a rock in the name Peter. To me, it is equally difficult, nay impossible, to deny all reference, in “upon this rock,” to the preceding word<b> Peter</b>. Let us keep to the plain straightforward sense of Scripture, however that sense may have been misused by Rome.<br><br><b> church</b>] This word occurs but in one place besides in the Gospels, ch. xviii. 17, and there in the same sense as here, viz.<b> the congregation of the faithful</b>: only there it is one portion of that congregation, here the whole.<br><br> The<b> gates of hell</b> (<b>Hades</b>), by a well-known Oriental form of speech, is equivalent to the<i> power of the kingdom of death</i>. The form is still preserved when the Turkish empire is known as ‘the Ottoman Porte.’ is promise received a remarkable literal fulfilment in the person of Peter in Acts xii. 6–18, see especially ver. 10.<br><br> The meaning of the promise is, that over the Church so built upon him who was by the strength of that confession the Rock, no adverse power should ever prevail to extinguish it.
