<b> 19.</b>] Another personal promise to Peter, remarkably fulfilled in his being<i> the first to admit both Jews and Gentiles into the Church</i>; thus using the power of the keys to open the door of salvation. As an instance of his shutting it also, witness his speech to Simon Magus, Acts viii. 21.<br><br><b> whatsoever thou shalt bind, &c.</b>] This same promise is repeated in ch. xviii. 18, to<i> all the disciples generally,</i> and to<i> any two or three gathered together in Christ’s name</i>. It was first however verified, and in a remarkable and prominent way, to Peter. Of the<i> binding</i>, the case of Ananias and Sapphira may serve as an eminent example: of the<i> loosing</i>, the “<i>Such as I have, give I thee,</i>” to the lame man at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple. But strictly considered, the binding and loosing belong to the<i> power of legislation</i> in the Church committed to the Apostles, in accordance with the Jewish way of using the words<i> bind</i> and<i> loose</i> for<i> prohibit</i> and<i> allow</i>. They cannot relate to the<i> remission and retention of sins</i>, for though to<i> loose sins</i> certainly appears to mean<i> to forgive sins, to bind sins</i> for<i> retaining</i> them would be altogether without example, and, I may add, would bear no meaning in the interpretation: it is<i> not the sin</i>, but the<i> sinner</i>, that is<i> bound</i>, “<i>liable to eternal sin</i>” (so in text) (Mark iii. 29). Nor can the ancient custom of fastening doors by means of cord be alluded to; for the expressions clearly indicate<i> something bound</i> and<i> something loosed</i>, and not merely the power of the keys just conferred. The meaning in John xx. 23, though an expansion of this in one particular direction (see note there), is not to be confounded with this.
