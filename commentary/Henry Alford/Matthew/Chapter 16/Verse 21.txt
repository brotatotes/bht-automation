<p>On the prophecy of the <em> resurrection</em> , some have objected that the disciples and friends of our Lord appear <em> not to have expected it</em> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:2">John 20:2</span> ; Luk 24:12 ). But we have it directly asserted (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:10">Mark 9:10</span> ; Mar 9:32 ) that they <em> did not understand</em> the saying, and therefore were not likely to make it a ground of expectation. Certainly enough was known of such a prophecy to make the Jews set a watch over the grave ( Mat 27:63 ), which of itself answers the objection. Meyer in loc. reasons about the state of the disciples after the crucifixion just as if they had not suffered any remarkable overthrow of their hopes and reliances, and maintains that they <em> must</em> have remembered this precise prophecy if it had been given by the Lord. But on the other hand we must remember how slow despondency is to take up hope, and how many of the Lord’s sayings must have been completely veiled from their eyes, owing to their non-apprehension of His sufferings and triumph as a <em> whole</em> . He Himself reproaches them with this very slowness of belief after His resurrection. It is in the highest degree improbable that the precision should have been given to this prophecy <em> after the event</em> , as Meyer supposes: both from the character of the Gospel History in general (see Prolegomena), and because of the carefulness and precision in the words added by Mark; see above.</p>
