<b> 22.</b>] The same Peter, who but just now had made so noble and spiritual a confession, and received so high a blessing, now shews the weak and carnal side of his character, becomes a stumbling-block in the way of his Lord, and earns the very rebuff with which the Tempter before him had been dismissed. Nor is there any thing improbable in this; the expression of spiritual faith may, and frequently does, precede the betraying of carnal weakness; and never is this more probable than when the mind has just been uplifted, as Peter's was, by commendation and lofty promise.<br><br><b> took (hold of) him</b>]<i> by the dress</i> or<i> hand</i>, or perhaps took him aside privately.<br><br> The “<i>Be it far from thee</i>” of the A.V. is literally<b> (God be) gracious</b> (or,<b> propitious) to thee</b>.<br><br><b> this shall not be unto thee</b>] It is an authoritative declaration, as it were, on Peter’s part.<b> This shall not happen to thee</b>, implying that he<i> knew better</i>, and could ensure his divine Master against such an event. It is this spirit of confident rejection of God’s revealed purpose which the Lord so sharply rebukes.
