 22. ] The same Peter, who but just now had made so noble and spiritual a confession, and received so high a blessing, now shews the weak and carnal side of his character, becomes a stumbling-block in the way of his Lord, and earns the very rebuff with which the Tempter before him had been dismissed. Nor is there any thing improbable in this, as Schleiermacher would have us believe (Translation of the Essay on St. Luke, p. 153); the expression of spiritual faith may, and frequently does, precede the betraying of carnal weakness; and never is this more probable than when the mind has just been uplifted, as Peter’s was, by commendation and lofty promise.

	 ἵλεώς σοι ] Supply εἴη ὁ θεός . ἵλεως with a dative is practically equivalent to the Hebrew חָלִילָה לְּ , for which (see reff., especially 1Ch 11:19 compared with the Heb.) the LXX have sometimes used it.
	 οὐ μὴ ἔσται ] I cannot think with Winer (§ 56. 3) that this means, ‘absit, ne accidat;’ it is an authoritative declaration, as it were, on Peter’s part,  This shall not happen to Thee, implying that he  knew better , and could ensure his Divine Master against such an event. It is this spirit of confident rejection of God’s revealed purpose which the Lord so sharply rebukes. On οὐ μή with the future, see note on ch. Matthew 15:6 : and consult Winer, as above.
