 23. ] As it was Peter’s  spiritual discernment , given from above, which made him a foundation-stone of the Church, so is it his  carnality , proceeding from want of unity with the divine will, which makes him an adversary now. Compare ch. Matthew 4:10 , also Ephesians 6:12 .
	 σκάνδαλον εἶ ἐμοῦ ]  Thou art my stumbling-block (not merely  a stumbling-block to me; the definite article is omitted before a noun thrust forward for emphasis, but in English it must be supplied), my πέτρα σκανδάλου (in Peter’s own remarkable words, 1 Peter 2:7-8 , joined too with the very expression, ὃν  ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες , which, as above noticed, occurs in this passage in Mark and Luke). Wordsw.’s note here, “our blessed Lord keeps up the metaphor of πέτρος , or a stone: thou who wert just now, by thy faith in confessing Me,  a lively stone , art now by thy carnal weakness  a stumbling stone to Christ,” seems to shew that his strong repudiation of any allusion to  πέτρος in the  πέτρα of Mat 16:18 has not carried full conviction to its writer. Before this rebuke St. Mark inserts καὶ ἰδὼν τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ , that the reproof might be before them all.
