<b> 23.</b>] As it was Peter’s<i> spiritual discernment</i>, given from above, which made him a foundation-stone of the Church, so is it his<i> carnality</i>, proceeding from want of unity with the divine will, which makes him an adversary now. Compare ch. iv. 10, also Eph. vi. 12.<br><br><b> thou art an offence unto me</b>] literally,<b> Thou art my stumbling-block</b> (not merely a stumbling-block to me), “rock (<i>petra</i>)<i> of offence</i>,” in Peter’s own remarkable words, 1 Pet. ii. 7, 8,—joined too with the very expression,<i> which the builders disallowed</i> (<b>rejected</b>), which, as above noticed, occurs in this passage in Mark and Luke. Before this rebuke St. Mark inserts “<i>when he had turned about and looked on his disciples,</i>” that the reproof might be before them all.
