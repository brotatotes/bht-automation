<b> 27.</b>] A further revelation of this important chapter respecting the Son of Man. He is to be JUDGE OF ALL—and, as in ch. xiii. 41, is to appear with<i> His</i> angels, and in the glory of His Father—the “<i>glory which thou hast given me,</i>” John xvii. 22. Mark and Luke place here, not this declaration, but that of our ch. x. 33. Our Lord doubtless joined the two. Compare ch. xxiv. 30; xxv. 31.
