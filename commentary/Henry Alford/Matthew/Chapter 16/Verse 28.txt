<b> 28.</b>] This declaration refers, in its full meaning, certainly<i> not to the transfiguration which follows</i>, for that could in no sense (except that of being a<i> foretaste</i>: compare Peter's own allusion to it, 2 Pet. i. 17, where he evidently treats it as such) be named ‘the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom,’ and the expression,<b> some... shall not taste cf death, till...</b>, indicates a distant event,—but<i> to the destruction of Jerusalem</i>, and the full manifestation of the Kingdom of Christ by the annihilation of the Jewish polity; which event, in this aspect as well as in all its terrible attendant details, was a<i> type</i> and<i> earnest</i> of the final coming of Christ. See John xxi. 22, and compare Deut. xxxii. 36 with Heb. x. 30. This dreadful destruction was indeed judgment beginning at the house of God. The interpretation of Meyer, &c., that our Lord referred to His<i> ultimate glorious coming</i>, the time of which was hidden from Himself (see Mark xiii. 32: Acts i. 7), is self-contradictory on his own view of the Person of Christ. That our Lord, in His humanity in the flesh,<i> did not know</i> the day and the hour, we have from His own lips: but that<i> not knowing it</i>, He should have uttered a determinate and solemn prophecy of it, is utterly impossible. His<b> verily I say unto you</b> always introduces His solemn and authoritative revelations of divine truth. The fact is, there is a reference back in this discourse to that in ch. x., and the<i> coming</i> here spoken of is the same as that in ver. 23 there. Stier well remarks that this cannot be the great and ultimate coming, on account of the terms of the announcement, which imply that they<i> should taste</i> of death<i> after they had seen</i> it, and would therefore be inapplicable to the final coming. This is denied by Wordsworth, who substitutes for the simple sense of “<i>shall not taste of death,</i>” the far-fetched one, “shall not feel its bitterness,” “shall not taste of the death of the<i> soul</i>,” and then, thus interpreting, gives the prophecy, as it seems to me, the very opposite of its plain sense: “they will not taste of death till I come:<i> much less will they taste of it then.</i>”
