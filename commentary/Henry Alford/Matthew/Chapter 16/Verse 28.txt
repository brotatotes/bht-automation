<p><strong> 28.</strong> ] This declaration refers, in its full meaning, certainly <em> not to the transfiguration which follows</em> , for that could in no sense (except that of being a <em> foretaste;</em> cf. Peter’s own allusion to it, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:17">2 Peter 1:17</span> , where he evidently treats it as such) be named ‘the Son of Man coming in His Kingdom,’ and the expression, <strong> τινὲς</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> οὐ μὴ γ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> indicates a distant event, but <em> to the destruction of Jerusalem</em> , and the full manifestation of the Kingdom of Christ by the annihilation of the Jewish polity; which event, in this aspect as well as in all its terrible attendant details, was a <em> type</em> and <em> earnest</em> of the final coming of Christ. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:22">John 21:22</span> , and compare Deu 32:36 with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:30">Hebrews 10:30</span> . This dreadful destruction was indeed judgment beginning at the house of God. The interpretation of Meyer, &amp;c., that our Lord referred to His <em> ultimate glorious</em> παρουσία , the time of which was hidden from Himself (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:32">Mark 13:32</span> ; Act 1:7 ), is self-contradictory on his own view of the Person of Christ.

<p>That our Lord, in His humanity in the flesh, <em> did not know</em> the day and the hour, we have from His own lips: but that <em> not knowing it</em> , He should have uttered a determinate and solemn prophecy of it, is utterly impossible. His <strong> ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν</strong> always introduces His solemn and authoritative revelations of divine truth. The fact is, there is a reference back in this discourse to that in ch. 10, and the <em> coming</em> here spoken of is the same as that in Mat 16:23 there. Stier well remarks that this cannot be the great and ultimate coming, on account of οὐ μὴ γεύσ . θανάτου ἕως ἂν ἴδωσιν , which implies that they <em> should taste</em> of death <em> after they had seen</em> it, and would therefore be inapplicable to the final coming (Reden Jesu, ii. 224). This is denied by Wordsw., who substitutes for the simple sense of οὐ μὴ γεύσ . θαν . the fanciful expositions, “shall not feel its bitterness,” “shall not taste of the death of the <em> soul</em> ,” and then, thus interpreting, gives the prophecy the very opposite of its plain sense: “they will not taste of death till I come: <em> much less will they taste of it then</em> .” It might be difficult to account for such a curious wresting of meaning, had he not added, “the signification of ἕως ἄν here may be compared to ἕως οὗ in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:25">Matthew 1:25</span> .” “Latet anguis in herba.”</p>
