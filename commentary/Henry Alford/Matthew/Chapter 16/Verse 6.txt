 6.   τῆς ζύμης ] see beginning of note on ch. Matthew 13:33 . It is from the penetrating and diffusive power of leaven that the comparison, whether for good or bad, is derived. In Luke 12:1 , where the warning is given on a wholly different occasion, the leaven is explained to mean,  hypocrisy; which is of all evil things the most penetrating and diffusive, and is the charge which our Lord most frequently brings against the Jewish sects.
	In Mark we read, καὶ τῆς ζύμης Ἡρώδου . The Herodians were more a political than a religious sect, the dependants and supporters of the dynasty of Herod, for the most part Sadducees in religious sentiment. These, though directly opposed to the Pharisees, were yet united with them in their persecution of our Lord, see ch. Matthew 22:16 : Mark 3:6 . And their leaven was the same,  hypocrisy , however it might be disguised by external difference of sentiment. They were all unbelievers at heart.
