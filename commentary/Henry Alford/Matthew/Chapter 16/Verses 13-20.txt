<p><strong> 13 20.</strong> ] CONFESSION OF PETER. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:27-30">Mark 8:27-30</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:18-21">Luke 9:18-21</span> . Here St. Luke rejoins the synoptic narrative, having left it at ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:22">Matthew 14:22</span> . We here begin the <em> second great division</em> of our Saviourâ€™s ministry on earth, introductory to His sufferings and death. Up to this time we have had no distinct intimation, like that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span> , of these events. This intimation is brought in by the solemn question and confession now before us. And as the former period of His ministry was begun by a declaration from the Father of His Sonship, so this also, on the Mount of Transfiguration.</p>
