 13 20. ] CONFESSION OF PETER. Mark 8:27-30 . Luke 9:18-21 . Here St. Luke rejoins the synoptic narrative, having left it at ch. Matthew 14:22 . We here begin the  second great division of our Saviourâ€™s ministry on earth, introductory to His sufferings and death. Up to this time we have had no distinct intimation, like that in Matthew 16:21 , of these events. This intimation is brought in by the solemn question and confession now before us. And as the former period of His ministry was begun by a declaration from the Father of His Sonship, so this also, on the Mount of Transfiguration.
