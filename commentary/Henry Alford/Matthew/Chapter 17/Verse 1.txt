<b> 1.]</b><i> “About an eight days after these sayings,”</i> Luke ix. 28. The one computation is inclusive, the other not; or perhaps, from the<i> “about”</i> being inserted, the one is precise, the other roughly stated. The time of the transfiguration was probably<i> night</i>, for the following reasons. (1) St. Luke informs us that the Lord had gone up to the mount<i> to pray</i>; which He usually did at night (Luke vi. 12; xxi. 87; xxii. 89: Matt. xiv. 28, 24 al.). (2) All the circumstances connected with the glorification and accompanying appearances would thus be more prominently seen. (3) The Apostles were<i> asleep</i>, and are described, Luke, ver. 32, as<i> ‘having kept awake through it.’</i> (4) They<i> did not descend till the next day</i> (Luke, ver. 37), which would be almost inexplicable had the event happened by day, but a matter of course if by night.
