<p><strong> 24. </strong> <strong> οἱ τὰ δίδρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λαμβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This <strong> tribute</strong> , hardly properly so called, was a sum paid annually by the Jews of twenty years old and upwards, <em> towards the temple</em> in Jerusalem. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:13">Exodus 30:13</span> ; 2Ki 12:4 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:6">2 Chronicles 24:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:9">2 Chronicles 24:9</span> . The LXX reckon according to the Alexandrian <em> double drachma</em> , and have therefore, as in the first of the above places, ἥμισυ τοῦ διδράχμου : but Josephus and Philo reckon as here, and Aquila, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+38:26">Exodus 38:26</span> , and an anonymous interpreter (see Hexapla), and apparently Jerome, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:22">Genesis 24:22</span> , translate בֶּקַע by δίδραχμ .
	</p>
<p>Josephus (B. J. vii. 6. 6) says of Vespasian, φόρον δὲ τοῖς ὅπου δήποτ ʼ οὖσιν Ἰουδαίοις ἐπέβαλε , δύο δραχμὰς ἕκαστον κελεύσας ἀνὰ πᾶν ἔτος εἰς τὸ καπετώλιον φέρειν , ὥσπερ πρότερον εἰς τὸν ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις νεὼν συνετέλουν . See, for more particulars, Winer, RWB., art. <em> Sekel</em> .

<p>It does not quite appear whether this payment was <em> compulsory</em> or not; the question here asked would look as if it were <em> voluntary</em> , and therefore <em> by some declined</em> .
	</p>
<p>Many Commentators both ancient and modern, and among them no less names than Clement Alex., Origen, Jerome, and Augustine, have entirely missed the meaning of this miracle, by interpreting the payment as a <em> civil</em> one, which it certainly was not.
	</p>
<p><strong> οἱ τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> λαμβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> are not the <em> publicans</em> , but <strong> they who received</strong> <em> the</em> <strong> didrachma</strong> , i.e. one for each person. Peter answered in the affirmative, probably because he had known it paid before.</p>
