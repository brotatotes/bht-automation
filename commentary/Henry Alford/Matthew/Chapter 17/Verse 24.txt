 24.<b> the two drachmas</b>] This was a sum paid annually by the Jews of twenty years old and upwards,<i> towards the temple</i> in Jerusalem. Exod. xxx. 18: 2 Kings xii. 4: 2 Chron. xxiv. 6, 9. Josephus says of Vespasian, “He levied a tribute on the Jews all over the world, compelling each man to pay two drachmas yearly into the Capitol, as they formerly used to do to the temple at Jerusalem.” It does not quite appear whether this payment was<i> compulsory</i> or not; the question here asked would look as if it were<i> voluntary</i>, and therefore<i> by some declined.</i>
