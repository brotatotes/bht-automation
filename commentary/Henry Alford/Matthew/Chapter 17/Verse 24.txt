 24.   οἱ τὰ δίδρ  .   λαμβ  . ] This  tribute , hardly properly so called, was a sum paid annually by the Jews of twenty years old and upwards,  towards the temple in Jerusalem. Exodus 30:13 ; 2Ki 12:4 ; 2 Chronicles 24:6 ; 2 Chronicles 24:9 . The LXX reckon according to the Alexandrian  double drachma , and have therefore, as in the first of the above places, ἥμισυ τοῦ διδράχμου : but Josephus and Philo reckon as here, and Aquila, Exodus 38:26 , and an anonymous interpreter (see Hexapla), and apparently Jerome, Genesis 24:22 , translate בֶּקַע by δίδραχμ .
	Josephus (B. J. vii. 6. 6) says of Vespasian, φόρον δὲ τοῖς ὅπου δήποτ ʼ οὖσιν Ἰουδαίοις ἐπέβαλε , δύο δραχμὰς ἕκαστον κελεύσας ἀνὰ πᾶν ἔτος εἰς τὸ καπετώλιον φέρειν , ὥσπερ πρότερον εἰς τὸν ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις νεὼν συνετέλουν . See, for more particulars, Winer, RWB., art.  Sekel .
	It does not quite appear whether this payment was  compulsory or not; the question here asked would look as if it were  voluntary , and therefore  by some declined .
	Many Commentators both ancient and modern, and among them no less names than Clement Alex., Origen, Jerome, and Augustine, have entirely missed the meaning of this miracle, by interpreting the payment as a  civil one, which it certainly was not.
	 οἱ τ  .   δ  .   λαμβ  . are not the  publicans , but  they who received  the  didrachma , i.e. one for each person. Peter answered in the affirmative, probably because he had known it paid before.
