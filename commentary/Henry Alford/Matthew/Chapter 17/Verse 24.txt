 24.<b> the two drachmas</b>] This was a sum paid annually by the Jews of twenty years old and upwards,<i> towards the temple</i> in Jerusalem. Exod. xxx. 18: 2 Kings xii. 4: 2 Chron. xxiv. 6, 9. Josephus says of Vespasian, “He levied a tribute on the Jews all over the world, compelling each man to pay two drachmas yearly into the Capitol, as they formerly used to do to the temple at Jerusalem.” It does not quite appear whether this payment was<i> compulsory</i> or not; the question here asked would look as if it were<i> voluntary</i>, and therefore<i> by some declined.</i><br><br> Many Commentators both ancient and modern, and among them no less names than Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Jerome, and Augustine, seem to have missed the meaning of this miracle, by interpreting the payment as a<i> civil</i> one, which it certainly was not. Peter answered in the affirmative, probably because he had known it paid before.<br><br><b> tribute</b> is here the rendering of<i> census</i>, money’ taken according to the reckoning of the<i> census</i>,<b>—</b><i>a capitation tax.</i><br><br><b> strangers,</b> all who are not their children, those out of their family.
