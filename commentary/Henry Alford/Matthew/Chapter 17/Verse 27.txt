Our Lord’s words amount to this:<b>—</b> “that, notwithstanding this immunity,<i> we</i> (graciously including the Apostle in the earthly payment, and omitting the distinction between them, which was not now to be told to any), that we may not offend them, will pay what is required<b>—</b>and shall find it furnished by God’s special providence for us.” In the foreknowledge and power which this miracle implies, the Lord recalls Peter to that great confession (ch. xvi. 16), which his hasty answer to the collectors shews him to have again in part forgotten.<br><br> Of course the miracle is to be understood in its literal historic sense.
