 1. ] In Mark we learn that this discourse arose out of a dispute among the disciples  who should be the greatest . It took place soon after the last incident. Peter had returned from his fishing: see Matthew 18:21 . The dispute had taken place before, on the way to Capernaum. It had probably been caused by the mention of the Kingdom of God as at hand in ch. Matthew 16:19 ; Matthew 16:28 , and the preference given by the Lord to the Three. In Mark it is our Lord who  asks them what they were disputing about , and they are silent.
