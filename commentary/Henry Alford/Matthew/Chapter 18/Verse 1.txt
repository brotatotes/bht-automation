 1.] In Mark we learn that this discourse arose out of a dispute among the disciples<i> who should be the greatest.</i> It took place soon after the last incident. Peter had returned from his fishing: see ver. 21. The dispute had taken place before, on the way to Capernaum. It had probably been caused by the mention of the Kingdom of God as at hand in ch. xvi. 19, 28, and the preference given by the Lord to the Three. In Mark it is our Lord<i> who asks them what they were disputing about,</i> and they are silent.<br><br><b> At that same time</b> need not necessarily refer to the incident last related. It may equally well be understood as indicating the presence in the mind of the querist of something that had Passed in the preceding dispute.
