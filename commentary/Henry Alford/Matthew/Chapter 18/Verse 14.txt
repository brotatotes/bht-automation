 14.] This verse sets forth to us the<i> work of the Son as accomplishing the will of the Father;</i>—for it is unquestionably the Son who is the Good Shepherd, searching for the lost, ver. 11. For similar declarations see Ezek. xviii. 28; xxxiii. 11: 2 Pet. iii. 9. The inference from this verse is— ‘then whoever despises or scandalizes one of these little ones, acts in opposition to the will of your Father in Heaven.’ Observe, when the dignity of the little ones was asserted, it was<b> my</b><i> Father</i>; now that a motive directly acting on the conscience of the Christian is urged, it is<b> your</b> Father.
