	 τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ  , by what follows, certainly not ‘the Jewish synagogue’ (for how could Mat 18:18-20 be said in any sense  of it? ), but  the congregation of Christians; i.e. in early times, such as in Acts 4:32 , the  one congregation, in after times, that congregation of which thou and he are members.

But this is not, as Words., the effect of the article only; the predicate ἐθνικός conveys plainly enough, that it is  as a heathen , not as a man, that he is here introduced.
