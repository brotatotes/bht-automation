<p><strong> 17. </strong> <strong> παρακούσῃ</strong> ] a stronger word than μὴ ἀκ ., implying something of <em> obduracy</em> .

<p><strong> τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> by what follows, certainly not ‘the Jewish synagogue’ (for how could Mat 18:18-20 be said in any sense <em> of it?</em> ), but <strong> the congregation</strong> of Christians; i.e. in early times, such as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:32">Acts 4:32</span> , the <em> one</em> congregation, in after times, that congregation of which thou and he are members. That it cannot mean <em> the Church as represented by her rulers</em> , appears by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:19-20">Matthew 18:19-20</span> , where <em> any</em> collection of believers is gifted with the power of deciding in such cases. Nothing could be further from the spirit of our Lord’s command than proceedings in what were oddly enough called ‘ecclesiastical’ courts.

<p><strong> ἔστω σοὶ</strong> κ . τ . λ .] ‘let him no longer be accounted as a brother, but as one of those without,’ as the Jews accounted Gentiles and Publicans.

<p>Yet even then <em> not with hatred</em> , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span> , and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:6-7">2 Corinthians 2:6-7</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:14-15">2 Thessalonians 3:14-15</span> . The articles <strong> ὁ</strong> ἐθν ., <strong> ὁ</strong> τελ ., are <em> generic;</em> the expressions being the singulars of οἱ ἐθνικοί , οἱ τελῶναι . And thus the quality expressed by ἐθνικός and τελώνης , rather than the individual who may happen to bear these characters, is prominent in the sentence: the ἐθν . or the τελ ., inasmuch and as far as he is ἐθν . or τελ . But this is not, as Words., the effect of the article only; the predicate ἐθνικός conveys plainly enough, that it is <em> as a heathen</em> , not as a man, that he is here introduced.</p>
