<b> 18.</b>] This verse re-asserts in a wider and more general sense the grant made to Peter in ch. xvi. 19. It is here not only to him as the first stone, but to the whole building. See note there, and on John xx. 23, between which and our ch. xvi. 19 this is a middle point. This refers to that entire accordance of hearty faith, which could hardly have place except also in accordance with the divine will. It was apparently misunderstood by the Apostles James and John;—see St. Mark’s account, ch. x, 36, in which they nearly repeat these words. Notice again the<b> [verily]</b><b> I say unto you:</b> see on ch. xvi. 28.
