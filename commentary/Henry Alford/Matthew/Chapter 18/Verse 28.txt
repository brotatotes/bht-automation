<b> 28.]</b> Perhaps we must not lay stress on<b> went out,</b> as indicating any wrong frame of mind already begun, as some do:—the sequel shews how completely he had ‘gone out’ from the presence of his Lord. At all events the word corresponds to the time when the trial of our principle takes place: when we ‘go out’ from the presence of God in prayer and spiritual exercises, into the world. We may observe, that<i> forgiveness of sin</i> does not imply<i> a change of heart or principle in the sinner.</i><br><br> The fellow-servant is probably not in the same station as himself, but none the less a fellow-servant. The insignificance of the sum is to shew us how trifling any offence against one another is in comparison to the vastness of our sin against God. Chrysostom finely remarks: “He paid no regard even to the words by which he owed his own deliverance,—the petition which won for him the forgiveness of those ten thousand talents: he recognized not the harbour where he escaped his impending shipwreck: the posture of the suppliant did not remind him of his lord’s kindness: but rejecting all such considerations in his avarice and his cruelty and his unforgiveness, he was more cruel than wild beast seizing and throttling his fellow-servant. What doest thou, O man? Seest thou not that thou art exacting from<i> thyself?</i> drawing the sword against<i> thyself,</i> retorting upon thyself the denial, and refusing for thyself the free forgiveness?”<br><br><b> that thou owest</b> must be understood as a haughty expression of one ashamed to meet the mention of the paltry sum really owing, and by this very expression generalizing his unforgiving treatment to all who owed him aught.
