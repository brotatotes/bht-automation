 28. ] Perhaps we must not lay stress on ἐξελθών , as indicating any wrong frame of mind already begun, as Theophylact does: the sequel shews how completely he had ‘gone out’ from the presence of his Lord. At all events the word corresponds to the time when the trial of our principle takes place: when we ‘go out’ from the presence of God in prayer and spiritual exercises, into the world. We may observe, that  forgiveness of sin does not imply  a change of heart or principle in the sinner .
	The fellow-servant is probably not in the same station as himself, but none the less a fellow-servant. The insignificance of the sum is to shew us how trifling any offence against one another is in comparison to the vastness of our sin against God. Chrysostom finely remarks: ὁ δὲ οὐδὲ τὰ ῥήματα ᾐδέσθη δι ʼ ὧν ἐσώθη · καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς ταὐτὰ εἰπὼν ἀπηλλάγη τῶν μυρίων ταλάντων · καὶ οὐδὲ τὸν λιμένα ἐπέγνω δι ʼ οὗ τὸ ναυάγιον διέφυγεν · οὐ τὸ σχῆμα τῆς ἱκετηρίας ἀνέμνησεν αὐτὸν τῆς τοῦ δεσπότου φιλανθρωπίας · ἀλλὰ πάντα ἐκεῖνα ὑπὸ τῆς πλεονεξίας καὶ τῆς ὠμότητος καὶ τῆς μνησικακίας ἐκβαλών , θηρίου παντὸς χαλεπώτερος ἦν , ἄγχων τὸν σύνδουλον . τί ποιεῖς , ἄνθρωπε ; σεαυτὸν ἀπαιτῶν οὐκ αἰσθάνῃ , κατὰ σεαυτοῦ τὸ ξίφος ὠθῶν , καὶ τὴν ἀπόφασιν καὶ τὴν δωρεὰν ἀνακλούμενος ; Hom. lxi. 4, p. 616.

The εἴ τι ὀφείλεις , which is beyond doubt the true reading, must be understood as a haughty expression of one ashamed to meet the mention of the paltry sum really owing, and by this very expression generalizing his unforgiving treatment to all who owed him aught.
