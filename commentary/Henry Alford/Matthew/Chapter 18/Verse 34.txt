<b> 34. the tormentors]</b> not merely the<i> prison-keepers,</i> but<b> the torturers.</b> Remember he was to have been sold into slavery before, and now<i> his punishment is to be greater.</i> The condition following would amount in the case of the sum in the parable to<i> perpetual</i> imprisonment. So Chrysostom, “that is, forever; for he will never repay.” See note on ch. v. 26.<br><br> There is a difficulty made, from the punishment of this debtor for<i> the very debt which had been forgiven,</i> and the question has been asked, ‘whether sins once remitted come back again.’ But it is the spiritual meaning which has here ruled the form of the parable. He who falls from a state of grace falls into a state of condemnation, and is overwhelmed with ‘all that debt,’ not of this or that actual sin formerly remitted, but of a<i> whole state</i> of enmity to God.<br><br> Meyer well remarks, that the motive held up in this parable could only have full light cast on it by the great act of Atonement which the Lord was about to accomplish. We may see from that consideration, how properly it belongs to this last period of His ministry.
