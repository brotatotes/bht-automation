 6. ] Here St. Mark and St. Luke insert the saying of John respecting one casting out dæmons in Jesus’ name, who followed not with the Apostles: which it appears gave rise to the remark in this verse. St. Luke however goes on no further with the discourse: St. Mark inserts also our ch. Matthew 10:42 .
	The verbs  κρεμασθῇ  ,   καταποντισθῇ  , may perhaps be understood in their strict tenses: it is better for him that a millstone  should have been hanged, &c., and he drowned.…  before the day when he gives this offence . But this is somewhat doubtful. The aorists more probably, as so often, denote an act complete in itself and accomplished at once: without any strict temporal reference. The punishment here mentioned,  drowning , may have been practised in the sea of Galilee (‘secundum ritum provinciæ ejus loquitur, quo majorum criminum ista apud veteres Judæos pœna fuerit, ut in profundum ligato saxo demergerentur.’ Jerome in loc.). De Wette however denies this, saying that it was not a Jewish punishment; but it certainly was a Roman, for Suetonius mentions it as practised by Augustus on the rapacious attendants of Caius Cæsar (Aug [146] ch. xlvii.): and a Macedonian (Diod. Sic. xvi. 35, ὁ δὲ Φίλιππος τὸν μὲν Ὀνόμαρχον ἐκρέμασε , τοὺς δ ʼ ἄλλους ὡς ἱεροσύλους  κατεπόντισε ). Compare also Livy i. 51, where Turnus Herdonius (“novo genere leti,” it is true) “dejectus ad caput aquæ Ferentinæ, crate superne injecta, saxisque congestis, mergitur.”
