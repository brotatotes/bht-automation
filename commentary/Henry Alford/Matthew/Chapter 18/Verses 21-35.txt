 21 35. ] REPLY TO PETER’S QUESTION RESPECTING THE LIMIT OF FORGIVENESS; AND BY OCCASION, THE PARABLE OF THE FORGIVEN BUT UNFORGIVING SERVANT. See Luke 17:3-4 . It is possible that Peter may have asked this question in virtue of the power of the keys before (ch. Mat 16:19 ) entrusted to him, to direct him in the use of them: but it seems more likely, that it was asked as in the person of any individual: that Peter wished to follow the rules just laid down, but felt a difficulty as to the limit of his exercise of forgiveness.
	The Rabbinical rule was, to forgive  three times and no more; this they justified by Amos 1:3 , &c.: Job 33:29-30 LXX, and mar [150] . E. V. The expression ‘seven times’ is found Proverbs 24:16 , in connexion with sinning and being restored: see also Leviticus 26:18-28 . In our Lord’s answer we have most likely a reference to Genesis 4:24 .
	 [150] Margin. ‘marg-eccles’ denotes that the reading cited is given on the margin as an alteration to be made in reading the passage in church, e.g. the name of our Lord, where the pronoun would otherwise stand at the beginning of a ‘Gospel for the day.’
	 Seventy times seven, not ‘  seven and seventy times ,’ is the rendering. οὐκ ἀριθμὸν τιθεὶς ἐνταῦθα , ἀλλὰ τὸ ἄπειρον καὶ διηνεκὲς καὶ ἀεί . Chrys. Hom. lxi. 1, p. 611.
