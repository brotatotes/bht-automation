THE BRINGING OF CHILDREN TO JESUS. Mark x. 13–16. Luke xviii. 16–17. After the long divergence of ch. ix. 51—xviii. 14, Luke here again falls into the synoptic narrative. This incident is more fully related in Mark, where see notes.<br><br> Our Evangelist has<b> that he should put his hands on them, and pray</b> (see Gen. xlviii. 14: Acts vi. 6), where the other two have only<i> ‘that He should touch them.’</i> The connexion in which it stands here and in Mark seems to be<b> natural,</b><i> immediately after the discourse on marriage.</i> Some further remarks of our Lord, possibly on the fruit of marriage, may have given rise to the circumstance.
