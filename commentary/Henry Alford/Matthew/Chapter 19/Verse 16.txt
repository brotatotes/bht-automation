<b> 16.]</b> From Luke ver. 18 we learn that he was<i> a ruler:</i> from Mark ver. 17, that he<i> ran</i> to our Lord. The spirit in which he came,—which does not however appear here so plainly as in the other gospels, from the omission of<i> “good,”</i> and the form of our Lord’s answer,—seems to have been that of excessive admiration for Jesus as a man of eminent virtue, and of desire to know from Him by what work of exceeding merit he might win eternal life. This spirit He reproves, by replying that there is but One Good, and that the walking by His grace in the way of holiness is the path to life. On the question and answer, as they stand in the received text,—and on their doctrinal bearing, see notes to Mark. This passage furnishes one of the most instructive and palpable cases of the smoothing down of apparent discrepancies by correcting the Gospels out of one another and thus reducing them to conformity.
