Our Lord takes him on his own shewing. As St. Mark and St. Luke add,<i> “One thing is wanting to thee.”</i> Supposing thy statement true, this topstone has yet to be laid on the fabric. But then it is to be noticed, that part of that one thing is Come and follow me (<i>taking up thy cross,</i> Mark). Stier remarks, that this was a test of his observance of the<i> first commandment</i> of the first table: of breaking which he is by the result convicted.
