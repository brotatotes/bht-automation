<b> 27.]</b> The disciples, or rather Peter speaking for them, recur to the<i> “shalt have treasure in heaven”</i> said to the young man, and enquire what<i> their</i> reward shall be, who have done all that was required of them. He does not ask respecting<i> salvation,</i> but<i> some</i><i> pre-eminent reward,</i> as is manifest by the answer. The ‘all’ which the Apostles had left, was not in every case contemptible. The sons of Zebedee had hired servants (Mark i. 20), and Levi (Matthew?) could make a great feast in his house, But whatever it was, it<i> was their all.</i><br><br> On ver. 29, Stier remarks that the family relations are mentioned by St. Matthew in the order in which<i> they</i><i> would be left.</i> On the other points requiring notice, see note on Mark x. 29, 30.
