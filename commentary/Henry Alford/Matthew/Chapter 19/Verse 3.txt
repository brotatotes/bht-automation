 3.] This was a question of dispute between the rival Rabbinical schools of Hillel and Shammai; the former asserting the right of arbitrary divorce, from Deut. xxiv. 1, the other denying it except in case of adultery. It was also, says De Wette, a delicate question in the place where our Lord now was,—in the dominions of Herod Antipas.<br><br> for every cause;—i. e.<i> is any charge which a man may choose to bring against his wife to justify him in divorcing her?</i><br><br> (2) That He cites both from the first and second chapters of Genesis, and in immediate connexion; thus shewing them to be consecutive parts of a continuous narrative,—which, from their different diction, and apparent repetition, they have sometimes been supposed not to be.<br><br> (3) That he quotes as<i> spoken by the Creator</i> the words in Gen. ii. 24, which were actually said by Adam; they must therefore be understood as said in prophecy, by divine inspiration, which indeed the terms made use of in them would require, since the relations alluded to by those terms did not yet exist.
