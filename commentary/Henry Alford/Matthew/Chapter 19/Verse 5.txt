 5.  εἰς σάρκα μίαν ] εἶναι εἰς is not Greek, but a Hebraism, הָיָה לְ (Meyer). Stier remarks, that the essential bond of marriage consists  not in unity of spirit and soul , by which indeed the marriage state should ever be hallowed and sweetened, but without which it still exists in all its binding power: the wedded pair are ONE FLESH, i.e. ONE MAN  within the limits of their united life in the flesh , for  this world: beyond this limit, the marriage is broken by the  death of the flesh . And herein alone lies the justification of a  second marriage, which in no way breaks off the unity of love in spirit with the former partner, now deceased. Vol. ii. p. 267, edn. 2.
