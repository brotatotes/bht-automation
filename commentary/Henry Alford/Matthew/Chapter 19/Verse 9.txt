Only that<b> fornication,</b> which<i> itse [f breaks marriage,</i> can be a ground for dissolving it. The question, whether demonstrated<i> approaches</i> to fornication, short of the act itself, are to be regarded as having the same power, must be dealt with cautiously, but at the same time with full remembrance that our Lord does not confine the guilt of such sins to the outward act only: see ch. v. 28. St. Mark gives this last verse (9) as spoken<i> to the disciples in the house;</i> and his minute accuracy in such matters of detail is well known. This enactment by our Lord is a formal repetition of what He had said before in the Sermon on the Mount, ch. v. 32. Some expositors (principally modern) have fallen into the mistake of supposing that the dictum applies to the marrying a woman divorced on account of fornication. But the full English way of rendering the sentence, would be,<b> a woman thus divorced,</b> viz. not on account of fornication.
