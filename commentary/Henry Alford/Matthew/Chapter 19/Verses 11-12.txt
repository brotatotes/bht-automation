<p><strong> 11, 12.</strong> ] <strong> τὸν λόγον τοῦτον</strong> <strong> , this saying of yours</strong> , viz. οὐ συμφέρει γαμῆσαι . The <strong> γάρ</strong> in Mat 19:12 shews that the sense is carried on: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:18">Matthew 1:18</span> .
	</p>
<p>Our Lord mentions the <em> three exceptions</em> , the οἷς δέδοται οὐ γαμῆσαι . 1. Those who from natural incapacity, or if not that, inaptitude, <em> have no tendencies</em> towards marriage: 2. Those who by actual physical deprivation, or compulsion from men, <em> are prevented</em> from marrying: 3. Those who in order to do the work of God more effectually (as e.g. Paul), <em> abstain</em> from marriage, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span> . The εὐνοῦχοι and εὐνουχίζω in the two first cases are to be taken both literally and figuratively in the latter, figuratively only. It is to be observed that our Lord does not here utter a word from which any superiority can be attributed to the state of celibacy: the imperative in the last clause being not a command but a permission, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span> . His estimate for us of the expediency of celibacy, as a general question, is to be gathered from the parable of the talents, where He visits with severe blame the burying of the talent for its safer custody. The remark is Neander’s, and the more valuable, as he himself lived and died unmarried. See his Leben Jesu, edn. 4, p. 584.</p>
