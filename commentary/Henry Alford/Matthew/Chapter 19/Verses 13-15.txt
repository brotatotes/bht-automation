 13 15. ] THE BRINGING OF CHILDREN TO JESUS. Mark 10:13-16 . Luke 18:15-17 . After the long divergence of ch. Luk 9:51 to Luke 18:14 , Luke here again falls into the synoptic narrative. This incident is more fully related in Mark, where see notes.
	Our Evangelist gives τὰς χ . ἐπιθ . αὐτ . κ . προσεύξ . (see Genesis 48:14 ; Act 6:6 ), where the other two have only ‘  that He should touch them .’ The connexion in which it stands here and in Mark seems to be natural,  immediately after the discourse on marriage . Some further remarks of our Lord, possibly on the fruit of marriage, may have given rise to the circumstance.
