 4 6. ] On these verses we may remark (1) that our Lord refers to the Mosaic account of the Creation as  the historical fact of the first creation of man; and grounds his argument on the  literal expressions of that narrative. (2) That He cites both from the first and second chapters of Genesis, and in immediate connexion; thus shewing them to be consecutive parts of a continuous narrative, which, from their different diction, and apparent repetition, they have sometimes been supposed not to be. (3) That He quotes as  spoken by the Creator the words in Genesis 2:24 , which were actually said by Adam; they must therefore be understood as said in prophecy,  divino afflatu , which indeed the terms made use of in them would require, since the relations alluded to by those terms did not yet exist. Augustin. de Nupt. ii. 4 (12), vol. x. pt. i., ‘Deus utique per hominem dixit quod homo prophetande prædixit.’ (4) That the force of the argument consists in the  previous unity of male and female, not indeed organically, but by implication, in Adam. Thus it is said in Genesis 1:27 , not ἄνδρα καὶ γυναῖκα ἐποίησεν αὐτούς , but ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ ἐπ . αὐ .  He made them (man, as a race)  male (not,  a male)  and female: but then the male and female were implicitly shut up in one; and therefore after the creation of woman from man, when one man and one woman were united in marriage they should be  one flesh , ἕνεκεν τούτου ,  because woman was taken out of man. The answer then is, that  abstractedly , from the nature of marriage,  it is indissoluble .
