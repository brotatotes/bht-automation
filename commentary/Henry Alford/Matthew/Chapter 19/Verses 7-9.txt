 7 9. ] In this second question, the Pharisees imagine that they have overthrown our Lord’s decision by a  permission of the law, which they call a  command (compare ἐνετείλατο , Matthew 19:7 , with ἐπέτρεψεν , Mat 19:8 ). But He answers them that this was done by Moses  on account of their hardness and sinfulness , as a  lesser of evils , and belonged to that dispensation which παρεισῆλθεν , Romans 5:20 ; τῶν παραβάσεων χάριν προσετέθη , Galatians 3:19 . This He expresses by the ὑμῶν , ὑμῖν , ὑμῶν , as opposed to ἄνθρωπος , and to ἀπ ʼ ἀρχῆς . Only that πορνεία , which  itself breaks marriage , can be a ground for dissolving it. The question, whether demonstrated  approaches to πορνεία , short of the act itself, are to be regarded as having the same power, must be dealt with cautiously, but at the same time with full remembrance that our Lord does not confine the guilt of such sins to the outward act only: see ch. Matthew 5:28 . St. Mark gives this last verse (9) as spoken  to the disciples in the house; and his minute accuracy in such matters of detail is well known. This enactment by our Lord is a formal repetition of what He had said before in the Sermon on the Mount, ch. Matthew 5:32 . Notice, as on ch. Matthew 5:32 , ἀπολελυμένην without the art., and thus logically confined to the case of her who has been divorced μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ . This not having been seen, expositors (e.g. of late Bp. Wordsworth) have fallen into the mistake of supposing that the dictum applies to the marrying a woman divorced ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ , which grammatically would require τὴν ἀπολελυμένην . The proper English way of rendering the word as it now stands, would be,  a woman thus divorced, viz., μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ .
