<p><strong> ἐν ἡμέραις Ἡρώδου</strong> ] HEROD THE GREAT, son of Antipater, an Idumean, by an Arabian mother, made king of Judæa on occasion of his having fled to Rome, being driven from his tetrarchy by the pretender Antigonus. (Jos. Antt. xiv. 14. 4.) This title was confirmed to him after the battle of Actium by Octavianus. He sought to strengthen his throne by a series of cruelties and slaughters, putting to death even his wife Mariamne, and his sons Alexander and Aristobulus. His cruelties, and his affectation of Gentile customs, gained for him a hatred among the Jews, which neither his magnificent rebuilding of the temple, nor his liberality in other public works, nor his provident care of the people during a severe famine, could mitigate. He died miserably, five days after he had put to death his son Antipater, in the seventieth year of his age, the thirty-eighth of his reign, and the 750th year of Rome. The events here related took place a short time before his death, but necessarily more than forty days; for he spent the last forty days of his life at Jericho and the baths of Callirrhoe, and therefore would not be found by the magi at Jerusalem. The history of Herod’s reign is contained in Josephus, Antt. books xiv. xvii.

<p><strong> μάγοι ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν</strong> ] <strong> Magi from the East;</strong> (not ἀπ . ἀνατ . παρεγ .) The absence of the art. after μάγοι is no objection to this interpretation. In fact it could not have been here expressed, because the <em> concrete</em> noun μάγοι is not <em> distributed:</em> as neither could it in such an expression as ἄνθρωπος ἐν πνεύματι ἀκαθάρτῳ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:23">Mark 1:23</span> . In the case of an anarthrous <em> abstract</em> noun, the art. <em> may follow</em> , but may also be omitted, cf. χαρὰ ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span> ; the distinction being, that χ . ἡ ἐν πν . ἁγ . would specify, among various kinds of joy, <em> that one</em> , which is ἐν πν . ἁγ ., whereas χ . ἐν πν . ἁγ . merely asserts the fact that the joy <em> is</em> ἐν πν . ἁγ ., without suggesting any comparison with other kinds. De W. remarks, that if ἀπὸ ἀνατ . belonged to παρεγ ., it would probably <em> follow</em> that verb, as ἐξ ὁδοῦ does, ref. Luke. I may add, that παραγίνομαι occurs with a preposition and a substantive twelve times in the N.T., and <em> in no case are they prefixed</em> .

<p>It would be useless to detail all the conjectures to which this history has given rise. From what has been written on the subject it would appear, (1) That ἀνατολαί may mean either <em> Arabia, Persia, Chaldæa</em> , or <em> Parthia, with the provinces adjacent</em> . See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jdg+6:3">Judges 6:3</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:2">Isaiah 41:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+46:11">Isaiah 46:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+23:7">Numbers 23:7</span> . Philo (leg. ad Caium 34, vol. ii. p. 584) speaks of ἔθνη τὰ ἑῷα καὶ ἡγεμόνες αὐτῶν Παρθυαῖοι . In all these countries there were magi, at least persons who in the wider sense of the word were now known by the name. The words in Mat 2:2 seem to point to some land not very near Judæa, as also the result of Herod’s enquiry as to the date, shewn in ἀπὸ διετοῦς . (2) If we place together ( α ) the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+24:17">Numbers 24:17</span> , which could hardly be unknown to the Eastern astrologers, and ( β ) the assertion of Suetonius (Vesp. c. 4), ‘Percrebuerat Oriente toto <em> vetus et constants</em> opinio, esse in fatis, ut eo tempore Judæa profecti rerum potirentur,’ and Tacitus, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:13">Matthew 2:13</span> , ‘Pluribus persuasio inerat, antiquis sacerdotum literis contineri, eo ipso tempore fore ut valesceret Oriens, profectique Judæa rerum potirentur,’ and ( γ ) the prophecy, also likely to be known in the East, of the seventy weeks in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+9:24">Daniel 9:24</span> ; we can, I think, be at no loss to understand how any remarkable celestial appearance at this time should have been interpreted as it was. (3) There is no ground for supposing the magi to have been <em> three</em> in number (as first, apparently, by Leo the Great, A.D., 450; “tribus igitur magis in regione Orientis stella novæ claritatis apparuit,” Serm. xxxi. 1, vol. i. p. 112), or to have been <em> kings</em> . The <em> first</em> tradition appears to have arisen from the number of their gifts; the <em> second</em> , from the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:3">Isaiah 60:3</span> . (Tertullian seems to deduce it from the similar prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+72:10">Psalms 72:10</span> . “Reges Arabum et Saba munera afferent illi: nam et magos reges fere habuit Oriens.” Adv. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jude+1:9">Jude 1:9</span> , vol. i. p. 619: adv. Marc. iii. 13, p. 339.)</p>
