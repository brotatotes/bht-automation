<b> 1. Bethlehem of Judæa</b>] There was another Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebulun, near the sea of Galilee, Josh. xix. 15. The name Bethlehem-Judah is used, Judges xvii. 7, 8, 9: 1 Sam. xvii. 12. Another name for our Bethlehem was Ephrath; Gen. xxxv. 19; xlviii. 7; or Ephrata, Micah v. 2. It was six Roman miles to the south of Jerusalem, and was known as ‘the city of David,’ the origin of his family, Ruth i. 1, 19.<br><br><b> in the days of Herod</b>] HEROD THE GREAT, son of Antipater, an Idumæan, by an Arabian mother, made king of Judæa on occasion of his having fled to Rome, being driven from his tetrarchy by the pretender Antigonus. This title was confirmed to him after the battle of Actium by Octavianus. He sought to strengthen his throne by a series of cruelties and slaughters, putting to death even his wife Mariamne, and his sons Alexander and Aristobulus. His cruelties, and his affectation of Gentile customs, gained for him a hatred among the Jews, which neither his magnificent rebuilding of the temple, nor his liberality in other public works, nor his provident care of the people during a severe famine, could mitigate. He died miserably, five days after he had put to death his son Antipater, in the seventieth year of his age, the thirty-eighth of his reign, and the 750th year of Rome. The events here related took place a short time before his death, but necessarily more than forty days; for he spent the last forty days of his life at Jericho and the baths of Callirrhoe, and therefore would not be found by the magi at Jerusalem. The history of Herod’s reign is contained in Josephus, Antt. books xiv.—xvii.<br><br> It would be useless to detail all the conjectures to which this history has given rise. From what has been written on the subject it would appear, (1) That<b> the East</b> may mean either<i> Arabia, Persia,</i><i> Chald</i> æ<i> a, or Parthia, with the provinces adjacent</i>. See Judges vi. 3: Isa. xli. 2; xlvi. 11: Num. xxiii. 7. Philo speaks of “the Eastern nations and their leaders the Parthians.” In all these countries there were<b> magi</b>, at least persons who in the wider sense of the word were now known by the name. The words in ver. 2 seem to point to some land not very near Judæa, as also the result of Herod’s enquiry as to the date, shewn in “two years old.” (2) If we place together (<i>a</i>) the prophecy in Num. xxiv. 17, which could hardly be unknown to the Eastern astrologers,—and (<i>b</i>) the assertion of Suetonius “that there prevailed an ancient and consistent opinion in all the East, that it was fated that at that time those should go forth from Judæa who should rule the empire:”—and of Tacitus, to the same effect and nearly in the same words,—and (<i>c</i>) the prophecy, also likely to be known in the East, of the seventy weeks in Daniel ix. 24;—we can, I think, be at no loss to understand how any remarkable celestial appearance at this time should have been interpreted as it was. (3) There is no ground for supposing the magi to have been<i> three</i> in number (as first, apparently, by Leo the Great, A.D. 450); or to have been<i> kings</i>. The<i> first</i> tradition appears to have arisen from the number of their gifts: the<i> second</i>, from the prophecy in Isa. lx. 3. Tertullian seems to deduce it from the similar prophecy in Ps. lxxii. 10, for, he says, the Magi were most commonly kings in the East.
