<p><strong> 11. </strong> <strong> μετὰ Μαρίας</strong> ] No stress must be laid on the omission of Joseph here. In the parallel account as regarded the shepherds, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:16">Luke 2:16</span> , he is mentioned. I would rather regard the omission here as indicating a <em> simple matter of fact</em> , and contributing to shew the truthfulness of the narrative: that Joseph <em> happened not to be present</em> at the time. If the meaning of τὴν οἰκίαν is to be pressed (as in a matter of detail I think it should), it will confirm the idea that Joseph and Mary, probably under the idea that the child was to be brought up at Bethlehem, <em> dwelt there some time</em> after the Nativity. Epiphanius supposes that Mary was at this time on a visit to her kindred at Bethlehem (possibly at a passover) as much as two years after our Lord’s birth. (Hærr. xx. xxx. 29, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+8:0">Leviticus 8:0</span> , vol. i. pp. 48, 154, 430.) But if Mary had kindred at Bethlehem, how could she be so ill-provided with lodging, and have (as is implied in Luk 2:7 ) sought accommodation at an inn? And the supposition of two years having elapsed, derived probably from the διετοῦς of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:16">Matthew 2:16</span> , will involve us in considerable difficulty. There seems to be no reason why the magi may not have come within the forty days before the Purification, which itself may have taken place in the interval between their departure and Herod’s discovery that they had mocked him. No objection can be raised to this view from the ἀπὸ διετοῦς of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:16">Matthew 2:16</span> : see note there. The general idea is, that the Purification was <em> previous</em> to the visit of the magi. Being persuaded of the historic reality of these narratives of Matt. and Luke, we shall find no difficulty in also believing that, <em> were we acquainted with all the events as they happened, their reconcilement would be an easy matter;</em> whereas now the two independent accounts, from not being aware of, seem to exclude one another. This will often be the case in ordinary life; e.g. in the giving of evidence. And nothing can more satisfactorily shew the veracity and independence of the narrators, where their testimony to the main facts, as in the present case, is consentient. (I must caution the reader against the misunderstanding of these last remarks in Bishop Ellicott’s Lectures on the Life of our Lord, p. 70, note 4; and indeed of my own views as regards apparently irreconcilable narrative in the Gospels, generally throughout his notes to that work.)

<p><strong> θησαυρούς</strong> ] <em> chests</em> or <em> bales</em> , in which the gifts were carried during their journey. The ancient Fathers were fond of tracing in the gifts symbolical meanings: ὡς βασιλεῖ τὸν χρυσόν , ὡς δὲ τεθνηξομένῳ τὴν σμύρναν , ὡς δὲ θεῷ τὸν λιβανωτόν . Origen, ag. Celsus, i. 60, vol. i. p. 375, and similarly Irenæus, iii. 9. 2, p. 184: χρυσὸν αὐτῷ γεννηθέντι βασιλείας σύμβολον προσεκόμισαν οἱ μάγοι . (Clem. Alex [10] Pæd. ii. 8 (63), p. 206 [11] .) We cannot conclude from these gifts that the magi came from <em> Arabia</em> , as they were common to all the East. Strabo says, xvi. p. 1129, Wets [12] ., that the best frankincense comes from the borders of Persia.

P (GUELPHERBYTANUS A) contains fragments of each of the Gospels. Q (GUELPH. B) fragments of Luke and John. Both are probably of the <em> sixth century</em> . They were edited by F. A. Knittel in 1762; and, more thoroughly, by Tischendorf in 1860 [1869], Monumenta Sacra, vol. iii. [vi.]
