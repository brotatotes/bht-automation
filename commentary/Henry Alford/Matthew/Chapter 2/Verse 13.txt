 13.   ἐγερθεὶς παρ  . ]  Arise and take with thee; not, ‘  When thou hast arisen (  in the morning ),  take .’ The command was immediate; and Joseph made no delay. He must be understood, on account of νυκτός below, as having arisen the same night and departed forthwith. The words ἐγερθεὶς παρέλαβεν are also used in Matthew 2:20-21 , where  no haste is necessarily implied. Egypt, as  near , as  a Roman province and independent of Herod , and  much inhabited by Jews , was an easy and convenient refuge.
	 τοῦ ἀπολ  . is not a Hebraism, but pure Greek, implying  the purpose . See Soph. Trach. 57, and Hermann’s note. Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 357, notices that it is rarely found in earlier Greek writers, but more common as we advance to the middle and later Attic. A few instances occur in Xenophon, more in Demosthenes, and abundance in after-writers. See on the usage, Winer, edn. 6, § 44. 4. b.
