<b> 15. Out of Egypt</b>] This citation shews the almost universal application in the N.T. of the prophetic writings to the expected Messiah, as the general antitype of all the events of the typical dispensation. We shall have occasion to remark the same again and again in the course of the Gospels. It seems to have been a received axiom of interpretation (which has, by its adoption in the N.T., received the sanction of the Holy Spirit Himself, and now stands for our guidance), that the subject of all allusions, the represented in all parables and dark sayings, was He who was to come, or the circumstances attendant on His advent and reign.—The words are written in Hosea<i> of the children of Israel</i>, and are rendered from the Hebrew.—A similar expression with regard to Israel is found in Exod. iv. 22, 23.<br><br><b> that it might be fulfilled</b> must not be explained away: it never denotes the event or mere result, but always the<i> purpose</i>.
