 17.   τὸ ῥηθ  .   διὰ Ἱερ  . ] Apparently, an accommodation of the prophecy in Jeremiah 31:15 , which was originally written of the Babylonish captivity. We must not draw any fanciful distinction between τότε ἐπληρώθη and ἵνα πληρωθῇ , but rather seek our explanation in the acknowledged system of prophetic interpretation among the Jews, still extant in their Rabbinical books, and now sanctioned to us by N.T. usage; at the same time remembering, for our caution, how little even now we understand of the full bearing of prophetic and typical words and acts. None of the expressions of this prophecy must be closely and literally pressed. The link of connexion seems to be  Rachel’s sepulchre , which (Genesis 35:19 ; see also 1Sa 10:2 ) was ‘  in the way to Bethlehem; ’ and from that circumstance, perhaps, the inhabitants of that place are called  her children . We must also take into account the close relation between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which had long subsisted. Ramah was six miles to the  north of Jerusalem, in the tribe of Benjamin (Jeremiah 40:1 ; “Er-Ram, marked by the village and green patch on its summit, the most conspicuous object from a distance in the approach to Jerusalem from the South, is certainly ‘Ramah of Benjamin.’ ” Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 213); so that neither must this part of the prophecy be strictly taken.
