<b> 2. his star</b>] There is a question, whether this expression of the magi,<b> we have seen his star</b>,<i> points to any miraculous appearance</i>, or to something observed in the course of their watching the heavens.<i> We know the magi to have been devoted to astrology</i>: and on comparing the language of our text with this undoubted fact, I confess that it appears to me the most ingenuous way, fairly to take account of that fact in our exegesis, and<i> not to shelter ourselves from an apparent difficulty by the hypothesis of a miracle</i>. Wherever supernatural agency is asserted, or may be reasonably inferred, I shall ever be found foremost to insist on its recognition, and impugn every device of rationalism or semi-rationalism; but it does not therefore follow that I should consent to attempts, however well meant,<i> to introduce miraculous interference where it does not appear to be borne out by the narrative</i>. The principle on which this commentary is conducted, is that of<i> honestly endeavouring to ascertain the sense of the sacred text, without regard to any preconceived systems, and fearless of any possible consequences</i>. And if the scientific or historical researches of others seem to contribute to this, my readers will find them, as far as they have fallen within my observation, made use of for that purpose. It seems to me that the preliminary question for us is, Have we here in the sacred text a miracle, or have we some natural appearanc√© which God in His Providence used as a means of indicating to the magi the birth of His Son? Different minds may feel differently as to the answer to this question. And, seeing that much has been said and written on this note in no friendly spirit, I submit that it is not for any man to charge another, who is as firm a believer in the facts related in the sacred text as he himself can be, with weakening that belief, because he feels an honest conviction that it is here relating, not a miracle, but a natural appearance. It is, of course, the far<i> safer</i> way, as far as reputation is concerned, to introduce miraculous agency wherever possible: but the present Editor aims at truth, not popularity.
