<b> 2. his star</b>] There is a question, whether this expression of the magi,<b> we have seen his star</b>,<i> points to any miraculous appearance</i>, or to something observed in the course of their watching the heavens.<i> We know the magi to have been devoted to astrology</i>: and on comparing the language of our text with this undoubted fact, I confess that it appears to me the most ingenuous way, fairly to take account of that fact in our exegesis, and<i> not to shelter ourselves from an apparent difficulty by the hypothesis of a miracle</i>. Wherever supernatural agency is asserted, or may be reasonably inferred, I shall ever be found foremost to insist on its recognition, and impugn every device of rationalism or semi-rationalism; but it does not therefore follow that I should consent to attempts, however well meant,<i> to introduce miraculous interference where it does not appear to be borne out by the narrative</i>. The principle on which this commentary is conducted, is that of<i> honestly endeavouring to ascertain the sense of the sacred text, without regard to any preconceived systems, and fearless of any possible consequences</i>. And if the scientific or historical researches of others seem to contribute to this, my readers will find them, as far as they have fallen within my observation, made use of for that purpose. It seems to me that the preliminary question for us is, Have we here in the sacred text a miracle, or have we some natural appearancé which God in His Providence used as a means of indicating to the magi the birth of His Son? Different minds may feel differently as to the answer to this question. And, seeing that much has been said and written on this note in no friendly spirit, I submit that it is not for any man to charge another, who is as firm a believer in the facts related in the sacred text as he himself can be, with weakening that belief, because he feels an honest conviction that it is here relating, not a miracle, but a natural appearance. It is, of course, the far<i> safer</i> way, as far as reputation is concerned, to introduce miraculous agency wherever possible: but the present Editor aims at truth, not popularity.<br><br> Now we learn from astronomical calculations, that a remarkable conjunction of the planets of our system took place a short time before the birth of our Lord. In the year of Rome 747, on the 29th of May, there was a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in the 20th degree of the constellation Pisces, close to the first point of Aries, which was the part of the heavens noted in astrological science as that in which the signs denoted the greatest and most noble events. On the 29th of September, in the same year, another conjunction of the same planets took place, in the 16th of Pisces: and on the 5th of December, a third, in the 15th degree of the same sign. Supposing the magi to have seen the<i> first</i> of these conjunctions, they saw it actually<b> in the East</b>; for on the 29th of May<i> it would rise</i> 3½ hours before sunrise. If they then took their journey, and arrived at Jerusalem in a little more than<i> five</i> months (the journey from Babylon took Ezra<i> four</i> months, see Ezra vii. 9), if they performed the route from Jerusalem to Bethlehem in the evening, as is implied, the<i> December conjunction</i>, in 15°of Pisces, would be before them<i> in the direction of Bethlehem</i>, 1½ hour east of the meridian at sunset. These circumstances would seem to form a remarkable coincidence with the history in our text. are in no way inconsistent with the word<b> star</b>, which cannot surely (see below) be pressed to its mere literal sense of one single star, but understood in its wider astrological meaning: nor is this explanation of<i> the star directing them to Bethlehem</i> at all repugnant to the plain words of vv. 9, 10, importing its motion from S.E. towards S.W., the direction of Bethlehem. We may further observe, that<i> no part of the text respecting the star, asserts, or even implies, a miracle</i>; and that the very slight apparent inconsistencies with the above explanation are no more than the<i> report of the magi</i> themselves, and the<i> general belief of the age</i> would render unavoidable. If this<i> subservience of the superstitions of astrology to the Divine purposes</i> be objected to, we may answer with Wetstein, “We must infer therefore that these men came to their conclusion from the rules of their art: which though beyond all doubt futile, vain, and delusive, might yet be sometimes permitted to hit on a right result. Hence appears the wonderful wisdom of God, who used the wickedness of men to bring Joseph into Egypt,—who sent the King of Babylon against the Jews by auguries and divinations (Ezek. xxi. 21, 22), and in this instance directed the magi to Christ by astrology.”<br><br> It may be remarked that Abarbanel the Jew, who knew nothing of<i> this</i> conjunction, relates it as a tradition, that no conjunction could be of mightier import than that of Jupiter and Saturn, which planets were in conjunction A.M. 2365, before the birth of Moses, in the sign of Pisces; and thence remarks that that sign was the most significant one for<i> the Jews</i>. From this consideration he concludes that the conjunction of these planets in that sign, in his own time (A. D. 1463), betokened the near approach of the birth of the Messiah. And as the Jews did not invent astrology, but learnt it from the Chaldæans, this idea, that a conjunction in Pisces betokened some great event in Judæa, must have prevailed among Chaldæan astrologers.<br><br> It is fair to notice the influence on the position maintained in this note of the fact which seems to have been substantiated, that the planets did not, during the year B.C. 7, approach each other so as to be mistaken by any eye for one star: indeed not “within double the apparent diameter of the moon.” I submit, that even if this were so, the inference in the note remains as it was. The<i> conjunction of the two planets</i>, complete or incomplete, would be that which would bear astrological significance, not their looking like one star. The two bright planets seen in the east,—the two bright planets standing over Bethlehem,—these would on each occasion have arrested the attention of the magi; and this appearance would have been denominated by them<b> his star</b>.<br><br><b> in the east</b>] i.e. either in the<i> Eastern country from which they came,</i> or in the<i> Eastern quarter of the heavens.</i><br><br><b> to worship him</b>] i.e.<i> to do homage to him</i>, in the Eastern fashion of prostration.
