<p><strong> 20. </strong> <strong> τεθνήκασιν γάρ</strong> ] The plural here is not merely idiomatic, nor, as Wordsw., “for lenity and forbearance, in speaking of the dead;” but perhaps a citation from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:19">Exodus 4:19</span> , where the same words are spoken to Moses ( ζητεῖν τὴν ψυχήν ═ בִּקֵּשׁ נֶפֶשׁ ): or, as Meyer, betokening, not the number, but the category. Cf. Soph. Œd. Col. 966. Herod the Great died of a dreadful disease at Jericho, in the seventieth year of his age, and the thirty-eighth of his reign, A.U.C. 750. Jos. B. J. i. 33. 8.</p>
