<b> 23. that it might be fulfilled</b>]<b></b> These words refer to the<i> divine</i> purpose in the event, not to that of Joseph in bringing it about.<br><br><b> which was spoken by the prophets</b>] These words are nowhere verbatim to be found, nor is this asserted by the Evangelist; but that the sense of<i> the prophets</i> is such. In searching for such sense, the following hypotheses have been made—none of them satisfactory:— (1) Euthymius says, “Do not enquire what prophets said this: for you will not find out: because many of the prophetic books have perished, some in the captivities, some by neglect of the Jews, some also by foul play.” So also Chrysostom and others. Bar the expression “<i>by the prophets</i>” seems to have a wider bearing than is thus implied. (2) Others say, the general sense of the prophets is, that Christ should be a<i> despised person, as the inhabitants of Nazareth were</i> (John i. 47). But surely this part of the Messiah’s prophetic character is not general or prominent enough, in the absence of any direct verbal connexion with the word in our text, to found such an interpretation on: nor, on the other hand, does it appear that an inhabitant of Nazareth, as such, was despised; only that the obscurity of the town was, both by Nathanael and the Jews, contrasted with our Lord’s claims. (3) The<i> Nazarites</i> of old were men holy and consecrated to God; e.g. Samson (Judg. xiii. 5), Samuel (1 Sam. i. 11), and to this the words are referred by Tertullian, Jerome, and others. But (<i>a</i>) our Lord did not (like John the Baptist) lead a life in accordance with the Nazarite vow, but drank wine, &c., and set himself in marked contrast with John in this very particular (ch. xi. 18, 19); and (b) the word here is not<i> Nazarite</i>, but<i> Nazarene</i>, denoting an inhabitant of Nazareth. (4) There may be an allusion to the Hebrew “<i>Netser,</i>” a branch, by which name our Lord is called in Isa. xi. 1, and from which word it appears that the name Nazareth is probably derived. So “<i>learned Hebrews</i>” mentioned by Jerome on Isa. xi. 1, and others. But this word is only used in the place cited; and in by far the more precise prophecies of the Branch, Zech. iii. 8; vi. 12: Jer. xxiii. 5; xxxiii. 15, and Isa. iv. 2, the word “<i>Tsemach</i>” is used.—I leave it, therefore, as an unsolved difficulty.
