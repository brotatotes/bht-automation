For the Sanhedrim consisting of seventy-one members, and comprising Priests, Levites, and Israelites, under the term “<i>chief priests</i>” are contained the two first of these, and under “<i>scribes of the people</i>” the third.<br><br><b> the chief priests</b> are most likely the High Priest and those of his race,—any who had served the office,—and perhaps also the presidents of the twenty-four courses (1 Chron. xxiv. 6).<br><br><b> the scribes</b> consisted of the teachers and interpreters of the Divine law, the<i> lawyers</i> of St. Luke. But the<i> elders of the people</i> are usually mentioned with these two classes as making up the Sanhedrim. See ch. xvi. 21; xxvi. 3, 59. Possibly on this occasion the chief priests and scribes only were summoned, the question being one of Scripture learning.
