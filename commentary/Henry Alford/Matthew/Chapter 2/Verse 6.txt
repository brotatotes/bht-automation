<p><strong> 6. </strong> <strong> καὶ σύ</strong> ] This is a free paraphrase of the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span> . It must be remembered that though the words are the answer of the Sanhedrim to Herod, and not a citation of the prophet by the Evangelist, yet they are adopted by the latter as correct. Lightfoot renders the Hebrew, ‘parvum est ut sis inter chiliadas,’ and adds, that the Chaldee paraphrast, who may possibly have been present at this very council, renders the words ‘intra pauxillum es ut præficiaris.’

<p><strong> γῆ Ἰούδα</strong> ] γῆ need not be supposed to be put for πόλις : the <em> district</em> may be intended, as described in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:16">Matthew 2:16</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἡγεμόσιν</strong> ] or χιλιάσιν (LXX). The tribes were divided into chiliads, and the names of the chiliads inscribed in the public records of their respective cities. In Jdg 6:15 Gideon says ἰδοὺ ἡ χιλιάς μου ἠσθένησεν ἐν Μανασσῇ , on which R. Kimchi (cited by Lightfoot) annotates, “Some understand Alphi to mean ‘my father,’ as if it were Alluph, whose signification is ‘prince or lord.’ ” And thus, it appears, did the Sanhedrim understand the word (which is the same) in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mic+5:2">Micah 5:2</span> . The word באלפי , without points, may mean either בְּאַלְפֵי , ἐν χιλιάσιν , or בְּאַלֻּפֵי , ἐν ἡγεμόσιν .

<p><strong> ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ ἐξ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] It has been remarked that the singular Latin expression, which occurs both in Tacitus and Suetonius (see the passages above in note on μάγοι ἀπ . ἀν .) ‘ <em> Judæa profecti</em> ,’ may have been derived from these words of the LXX.</p>
