<b> 9.</b>]<b> stood over</b> may mean ‘<i>over that part of Bethlehem where the young child was,</i>’ which they might have ascertained by enquiry. Or it may even mean, ‘<i>over the whole town of Bethlehem.’</i> If it is to be understood as standing<i> over the house</i>, and thus<i> indicating</i> to the magi the<i> position of the object of their search</i>, the whole incident must be regarded as miraculous, But this is not necessarily implied, even if the words of the text be literally understood; and in a matter like astronomy, where popular language is so universally broad, and the Scriptures so generally use popular language, it is surely not the letter, but the spirit of the narrative with which we are concerned.
