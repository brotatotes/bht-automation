AMBITIOUS REQUEST OF THE MOTHER OF THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE; OUR LORD’ S REPLY. Mark x. 35–45; not related by Luke. This request seems to have arisen from the promise made to the twelve in ch. xix. 28. In Mark’s account, the<i> two brethren themselves</i> make the request. But the<i> narration</i> in the text is the more detailed and exact; and the two immediately coincide, by our Lord<i> addressing His answer</i> to the two Apostles (ver. 22). The difference is no greater than is perpetually to be found in narrations of the same fact, persons being often related to have done<i> themselves</i> what, accurately speaking, they did<i> by another.</i> The mother’s name was<i> Salome;</i>—she had followed our Lord from Galilee,—and afterwards witnessed the crucifixion, see Mark xv. 40. Probably the two brethren had directed this request<i> through</i><i> their mother,</i> because they remembered the rebuke which had followed their former contention about precedence.
