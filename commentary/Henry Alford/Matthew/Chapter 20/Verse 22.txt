	The ‘  cup ’ is a frequent Scripture image for joy or sorrow: see Psalms 23:5 ; Psalms 116:13 ; Isaiah 51:22 ; Matthew 26:42 .  It here seems to signify more the  inner and spiritual bitterness, resembling the agony of the Lord Himself, and the  baptism , which is an important addition in Mark, more the  outer accession of persecution and trial, through which we must pass to the Kingdom of God. On the latter image see Psalms 42:7 ; Psalms 69:2 ; Psalms 124:4 .
	Stier rightly observes that this answer of our Lord contains in it  the kernel of the doctrine of the Sacraments in the Christian Church: see Rom 6:1-7 ; 1 Corinthians 12:13 , and note on Luke 12:50 .
