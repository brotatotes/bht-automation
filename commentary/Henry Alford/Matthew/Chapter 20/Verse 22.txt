<b> 22.]</b> One at least of these brethren saw<i> the Lord on His Cross—on His right and hand the crucified thieves.</i> Bitter indeed must the remembrance of this ambitious prayer have been at that moment!Luther remarks, ‘The flesh ever seeks to be glorified, before it is crucified: exalted, before it is abased.’<br><br> The<i> ‘cup’</i> is a frequent Scripture image for joy or sorrow: see Ps. xxiii. 5; cxvi. 13: Isa. li. 22: Matt. xxvi. 42.<i> It</i> here seems to signify more the<i> inner</i> and spiritual bitterness, resembling the agony of the Lord Himself,—and the<i> baptism,</i> which is an important addition in Mark, more the<i> outer</i> accession of persecution and trial,—through which we must pass to the Kingdom of God. On the latter image see Ps. xlii. 7; lxix. 2; oxxiv. 4<br><br> Stier rightly observes that this answer of our Lord contains in it<i> the kernel of the doctrine of the Sacraments</i> in the Christian Church: see Rom. vi. 1–7: 1 Cor. xii. 18, and note on Luke xii. 50.<br><br> Some explain in their answer as if they understood the Lord to speak of<i> drinking out of the royal cup, and washing in the royal ewer:</i> but the words<b> are ye able to drink,</b> and<b> we are able,</b> indicating a<i> difficulty,</i> preclude this.
