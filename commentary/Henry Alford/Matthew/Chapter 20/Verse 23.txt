<b> 23.]</b> The<i> one</i> of these brethren was the<i> first of the Apostles to drink the cup Of suffering, and be baptized with the baptism of blood,</i> Acts xii. 1, 2: the<i> other had the longest experience among them of a life of trouble and persecution.</i><br><br> The last clause of the verse may be understood as in the text, ‘is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father;’ So Meyer, al.; or, ‘is not mine to give,<i> except</i> to those for whom,’&. So Chrysostom and others. If however we understand after but ‘it shall be given<i> by Me,’</i> the two interpretations come to the same.<br><br><b> a ransom for many,</b> is a plain declaration of the sacrificial and vicarious nature of the death of our Lord. The principal usages (in the Greek Scriptures) of the word rendered<b> ransom</b> are the following:— (1) a payment as equivalent for a life destroyed; (2) the price of redemption of<b> a slave;</b> (3) ‘propitiation for.’<br><br><b> many</b> here is equivalent to<i> “all”</i> 1 Tim. ii. 6. No stress is to be laid on this word<i> “many”</i> as not being<i> “all”</i> here; it is placed in opposition to the<i> one</i> life which is given—the<i> one</i> for<i> many</i>—and not with any distinction from<i> “all.”</i> (I may observe once for all, that in the usage of these two words, as applied to our redemption by Christ,<i> “all”</i> is the OBJECTIVE,<i> “many”</i> the SUBJECTIVE designation of those for whom Christ died. He<i> died for all,</i> as outward matter of fact; but as matter of individual participation, the great multitude ‘whom no man can number,<i> “many,”</i> will be the saved by Him in the end.) ‘As the Son of man came to give His life for many and to serve many, so ye, being many, should be to each one the object of service and self-denial.’<br><br> JERICHO, 150 stadia (18 rom. miles) N.E. of Jerusalem (Jos. B.J. iv. 8 3), and 60 (7. 2 rom. miles) w. from the Jordan (Jos. ibid.), in the tribe of Benjamin (Josh. xviii. 21), near the borders of Ephraim (Josh. xvi. 7). The environs were like an oasis surrounded by high and barren limestone mountains,—well watered and fertile, rich in palm-trees (Deut. xxxiv. 8: Judg. i. 16; iii, 18), roses (Ecclus. xxiv. 14), and balsam (Jos. Antt. iv. 6. 1 al.). After its destruction by Joshua, its rebuilding was prohibited under a curse (Josh. vi. 26) which was incurred by Hiel the Bethelite in the days of Ahab (1 Kings xvi. 84): ie. he<i> fortified</i> it, for it was an inhabited city before (see Judg. iii. 18: 2 Sem. x. 5). We find it the seat of a school of the prophets, 2 Kings ii. 4 ff. After the captivity we read of it, Ezra ii. 34; Neh. vii. 36: and in 1 Macc. ix. 50 we read that Jonathan strengthened its fortifications. It was much embellishedby Herod the Great, who had a palace there (Jos. Antt. xvi. 5. 2 al.), and at this time was one of the principal cities of Palestine, and the residence of a<i> chief publication</i> on account of the balsam trade (Luke xix. 1). At present there is on or near the site only a miserable village, Richa or Ericha.
