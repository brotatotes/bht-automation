<p><strong> 8.</strong> ] By the Mosaic law ( Deu 24:15 ) the wages of an hired servant were to be paid him <em> before night</em> . This was at the twelfth hour, or sunset: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:12">Matthew 20:12</span> . I do not think the <strong> ἐπίτροπος</strong> must be pressed as having a spiritual meaning. If it has, it represents <em> Christ</em> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span> , and ch. Mat 11:27 ).

<p><strong> ἀρξάμενος</strong> is not merely expletive, but definite, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:5">Luke 23:5</span> .</p>
