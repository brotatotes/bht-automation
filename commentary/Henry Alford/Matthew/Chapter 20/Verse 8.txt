I do not think the<b> steward</b> must be pressed as having a spiritual meaning. If it has, it represents<i> Christ</i> (see Heb. iii. 6, and ch. xi. 27).<br><br><b> beginning</b> is not merely expletive, but definite, as in Luke xxiii. 5.<br><br><b> go thy way</b> hardly denotes (as Stier in his 1st edn.) expulsion and separation from the householder and his employment: it is here only a word of course, commanding him to do what a paid labourer naturally should do.
