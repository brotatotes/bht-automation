 20 28. ] AMBITIOUS REQUEST OF THE MOTHER OF THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE; OUR LORD’S REPLY. Mark 10:35-45 . Not related by Luke. This request seems to have arisen from the promise made to the twelve in ch. Matthew 19:28 . In Mark’s account, the  two brethren themselves make the request. But the  narration in the text is the more detailed and exact; and the two immediately coincide, by our Lord  addressing His answer to the two Apostles ( Mat 20:22 ). The difference is no greater than is perpetually to be found in narrations of the same fact, persons being often related to have done  per se what, accurately speaking, they did  per alterum . The mother’s name was  Salome ; she had followed our Lord from Galilee, and afterwards witnessed the crucifixion, see Mark 15:40 . Probably the two brethren had directed this request  through  their mother , because they remembered the rebuke which had followed their former contention about precedence.
