 26 28. ]  μέγας  .…   πρῶτος  , i.e. in the  next life , let him be διάκ . and δοῦλος  here . Thus also the  ἦλθεν  , Matthew 20:28 , applies to the coming of the Son of man  in the flesh only .
	 λύτρον ἀντὶ πολ  . is a plain declaration of the sacrificial and vicarious nature of the death of our Lord. The principal usages of λύτρον are the following: (1) a payment as equivalent for a life destroyed, Exodus 21:30 ; (2) the price of redemption of a slave, Leviticus 25:51 a [155] .; (3) ‘propitiation for,’ as in Proverbs 13:8 , where Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion have ἐξίλασμα .

	 λύτρον ἀντὶ πολλῶν here = ἀντίλυτρον ὑπὲρ πάντων 1 Timothy 2:6 . No stress is to be laid on this word πολλῶν as not being πάντων here; it is placed in opposition to the  one life which is given the  one for  many and not with any distinction from πάντων . (I may observe once for all, that in the usage of these two words, as applied to our redemption by Christ, πάντων is the OBJECTIVE, πολλῶν the SUBJECTIVE designation of those for whom Christ died. He  died for all , objectively; subjectively, the great multitude whom no man could number, πολλοί , will be the saved by Him in the end.) ‘As the Son of man came to give His life for many and to serve many, so ye, being many, should be to each one the object of service and self-denial.’ Hofmann, Schriftbeweis, ii. 1, p. 197, argues for ἀντὶ πολλῶν being taken with δοῦναι , not with λύτρον . But Meyer well remarks, 1) that the sense of ἀντί will not be altered by this, and 2) that this sense is clearly marked by λύτρον to be that of  substitution , not, as Hofm., that of compensation merely.
