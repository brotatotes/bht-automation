It is impossible to suppose that St. Matthew or St. John, or any one but moderately acquainted with the events which he undertook to relate, should have made such a gross error in chronology, as must be laid to the charge of one or other of them, if these two occurrences were<i> the same.</i> I rather view the omission of the first in the synoptic accounts as in remarkable consistency with what we otherwise gather from the three Gospels—that their narrative is<i> exclusively Galilean</i> (with one exception, Luke iv. 44 in our text),<i> until this last journey to Jerusalem,</i> and consequently the first cleansing is passed over by them.
