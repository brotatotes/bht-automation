<b> 13.]</b> Stier remarks that the verse quoted from Jeremiah is in connexion with the charge of<i> murder,</i> and the<i> shedding of innocent blood</i> (see Jer. vii. 6). On the intention of this act of our Lord, see notes on John ii. 15. It was a purely Messianic act; see Mal. iii. 1â€“3.<br><br> Psalm viii. is frequently cited in the N.T. of Christ: see 1 Cor. xv. 27: Heb. ii. 6: Eph. i. 22. In understanding such citations as this, and that in ver. 4, we must bear in mind the important truth, thet the external fulfilment of a prophecy is often itself only a type and representation of that inner and deeper sense of the prophecy which belongs to the spiritual dealings of God.
