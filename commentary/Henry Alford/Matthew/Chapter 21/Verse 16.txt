Psalm viii. is frequently cited in the N.T. of Christ: see 1 Cor. xv. 27: Heb. ii. 6: Eph. i. 22. In understanding such citations as this, and that in ver. 4, we must bear in mind the important truth, that the external fulfilment of a prophecy is often itself only a type and representation of that inner and deeper sense of the prophecy which belongs to the spiritual dealings of God.
