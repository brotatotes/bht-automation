<b> 17.]</b> If this is to be literally understood of the<i> village</i> (and not of a district round it, including part of the Mount of Olives; see Luke xxi. 37), this will be the<i> second night spent at Bethany.</i> I would rather of the two understand it<i> literally,</i> and that the spending the nights<i> on the Mount of Olives</i> did not begin till the<i> next night</i> (Tuesday).<br><br> The cursing of the fig-tree<i> had in fact taken place on the day before,</i> and the withering of it was<i> now noticed.</i> St. Mark separates the two accounts, which are here given together. We must remember that this miracle was<i> wholly typical and parabolical.</i> The fig-tree was THE JEWISH PEOPLE—full of the leaves of an useless profession, but without fruit:—and further, all hypocrites of every kind, in every age. It is true, as De Wette observes, that no trace of a parabolic meaning appears in the narrative (and yet strangely enough, he himself a few lines after, denying the truth of the miracle, accounts for the narrative by supposing it to have<i> arisen out of a parable</i> spoken by our Lord); but neither does there in that of the driving out the buyers and sellers from the temple, and in those of many other actions which we know to have been symbolic.
