This assurance has occurred before in ch. xvii. 20. That truest and<i> highest faith,</i> which implies a mind and will perfectly in unison with that of God, can, even in its least degree, have been in Him only who spoke these words. And by it, and its elevating power over the functions and laws of inferior natures we may reverently believe that His most notable miracles were wrought. It is observable, that such a state of mind entirely precludes the idea of an<i> arbitrary</i> exercise of power—none such can therefore be intended in our Lord’s assertion—but we must understand,— “if expedient.” Though we cannot reach this faith in its fulness, yet every approach to it (ver. 21) shall be endued with some of its wonderful power,—in obtaining requests from God. See the remarkable and important addition in Mark xi. 25, 26.<br><br><b> 23. the chief priests and the elders of the people</b> St. Mark and St. Luke add<i> the scribes,</i> and so make up the members of the Sanhedrim. It was an<i> official message,</i> sent with a view to make our Saviour declare Himself to be a prophet sent from God—in which case the Sanhedrim had power to take cognizance of His proceedings, as of a professed Teacher."Thus the Sanhedrim sent a deputation to John on his appearing as a Teacher, John i. 19. The question was<i> the result of a combination to destroy Jesus,</i> Luke xix. 47, 48. They do not now ask, as in John ii. 18,<i> What sign shewest Thou</i><br><br><i> unto us, seeing thou doest these things?</i> for they had had many signs, which are now included in their<i> “these things.”</i> The second question is an expansion of the first.
