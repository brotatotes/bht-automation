 28. ]  τί δὲ ὑ  .   δ  .: a formula of connexion but doubtless here intended to help the questioners to the true answer of their difficulty about John’s baptism. The following parable (peculiar to Matthew) refers, under the image of the two sons, to two classes of persons, both summoned by the great Father to “work in His vineyard” (see ch. Mat 20:1 );  both Jews and of His family. The  first answer the summons by a direct and open refusal these are the  open sinners , the publicans and harlots, who disobey God to His face. But afterwards, when better thoughts are suggested, they repent, and go. The  second class (no stress is to be laid on the  order of calling the parable merely mentions that the call was made  ὡσαύτως it is the mistaken desire to set the chronology right which has given rise to such confusion in the readings) receive the summons with a respectful assent (not unaccompanied with a self-exaltation and contrast to the other, implied in the emphatic  ἐγώ ) having however no intention of obeying (there is no mention of a  change of mind in this case): but go not. These are  the Scribes and Pharisees , with their shew of legal obedience, who “said, and did not” (ch. Mat 23:3 ). It will of course admit of wider applications to Jews and Heathens, or any similar pair of classes who may thus be compared.
