<b> 28.] But what think ye?</b> a formula of connexion—but doubtless here intended to help the questioners to the true answer of their difficulty about John’s baptism. The following parable (peculiar to Matthew) refers, under the image of the two sons, to two classes of persons, both summoned by the great Father to “work in His vineyard” (s00 ch. xx. 1);<i> both Jews,</i> and of His family. The<i> first</i> answer the summons by a direct and open refusal—these are the<i> open sinners,</i> the publicans and harlots, who disobey God to His face. But afterwards, when better thoughts are suggested, they repent, and go. The<i> second</i> class receive the summons with a respectful assent (not unaccompanied with a self-exaltation and contrast to the other, implied in the emphatic I, sir)—having however no intention of obeying (there is no mention of a<i> change of mind</i> in this case): but go not. These are<i> the Scribes and Pharisees,</i> with their shew of legal obedience, who “said, and did not” (ch. xxiii. 3). It will of course admit of wider applications—to Jews and Heathens, or any similar pair of classes who may thus be compared.
