<b> 37.]</b> See Luke ver. 18: Mark ver. 6. Our Lord sets forth His heavenly Father in haman wise deliberating, “<i>What shall I do?”</i> (Luke) and<i> “it may be they will reverence him,”</i> to signify His gracious adoption, for man’s sake, of every means which may turn sinners to repentance. The difference here is fully made between the Son and all the other messengers; see Mark,—<i> “having yet therefore one Son, his wellbeloved..:”</i> and, as Stier remarks, this is the real and direct answer to the question in ver. 23. The Son appears here, not in his character of Redeemer, but in that of a preacher—a messenger demanding the fruits of the vineyard. (See ch. iv. 17.)
