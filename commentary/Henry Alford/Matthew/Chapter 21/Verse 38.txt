 38.   οὗτός ἐστιν ] So Nicodemus, John 3:2 ,  οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἀπὸ θ . ἐλήλυθας διδάσκαλος , even at the beginning of His ministry; how much more then after three years spent in His divine working. The latent consciousness that Jesus  was the Messiah , expressed in the prophecy of Caiaphas (John 11:49-52 ; cf. the σὺ εἶπας of our ch. Mat 26:64 ), added no doubt to the guilt of the Jewish rulers in rejecting and crucifying Him, however this consciousness may have been accompanied with ἄγνοια of one kind or other in all of them, see Act 3:17 and note.
	 ὁ κληρον  . ] This the Son is in virtue of  His human nature : see Hebrews 1:1-2 .
	 δεῦ  .   ἀποκτ  .   αὐτ  . ] The very words of the LXX, ref. Gen., where Joseph’s brethren express a similar resolution: and no doubt used by the Lord in reference to that history, so deeply typical of His rejection and exaltation. This resolution had actually been taken, see John 11:53 ; and that immediately after the manifestation of His power as the Son of God ( πάτερ , εὐχαριστῶ σοι κ . τ . λ . Joh 11:41 ), in the raising of Lazarus, and also immediately ( οὖν ) after Caiaphas’s prophecy.
	 καὶ σχ  . ] see John 11:48 . As far as this, the parable is History: from this point, Prophecy.
