<b> 39.]</b> This is partly to be understood of our Lord being given up to the heathen to be judged; but also literally, as related by all three Evangelists. See also John xix. 17, and Heb. xiii. 11, 12. In Mark the order is different,<i> “they killed him, and cast him out Of the vineyard.”</i><br><br> The<b> which,</b> applied to persons, is not equivalent to<i> who:</i> it means, of<b> a kind, who:</b><i> “who”</i> would identify,<i> “which”</i> classifies. They do not specify<i> who,</i> but only<i> of what sort,</i> the new tenants will be. The clause is peculiar to Matthew. We may observe that our Lord here makes<b> when the lord... cometh</b><i> coincide with the destruction of Jerusalem,</i> which is incontestably the overthrow of the wicked husbandmen. This passage forms therefore an important key to our Lord’s prophecies, and a decisive justification for those who, like myself, firmly hold that<i> the coming of the Lord</i> is in many places to be identified, primarily, with that overthrow.
