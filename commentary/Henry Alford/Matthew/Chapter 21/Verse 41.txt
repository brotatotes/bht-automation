St. Mark and St. Luke omit the important words<b> they say unto him,</b> though St. Luke has given us the key to them, in telling us that the parable was spoken in the hearing of the people, who seem to have made the answer. Perhaps however the Pharisees may have made this answer, having<i> missed,</i> or<i> pretended</i> to miss,<i> the sense of the parable;</i> but from the strong language used, I incline to the former view. Whichever said it, it was a self-condemnation, similar to that in ch. xxvii. 25: the<i> last form,</i> as Nitzsch finely remarks (cited by Stier), of the divine warnings to men, ‘when they themselves speak of the deeds which they are about to do, and pronounce judgment upon them.’ So striking, even up to the last moment, is the mysterious union of human free-will with divine foresight (see Acts ii. 23: Gen. 1. 20), that after all other warnings frustrated, the conscience of the sinner himself interposes to save him from ruin. In the original the adverb rendered<i> “miserably”</i> is that belonging to the adjective rendered<i> “wicked.”</i> This could hardly be given in a version in English: it may be<i> represented</i> by some such expression as,<i> “He will destroy them wretchedly, wretches as they are.”</i><br><br> The<b> which,</b> applied to persons, is not equivalent to<i> who:</i> it means, of<b> a kind, who:</b><i> “who”</i> would identify,<i> “which”</i> classifies. They do not specify<i> who,</i> but only<i> of what sort,</i> the new tenants will be. The clause is peculiar to Matthew. We may observe that our Lord here makes<b> when the lord... cometh</b><i> coincide with the destruction of Jerusalem,</i> which is incontestably the overthrow of the wicked husbandmen. This passage forms therefore an important key to our Lord’s prophecies, and a decisive justification for those who, like myself, firmly hold that<i> the coming of the Lord</i> is in many places to be identified, primarily, with that overthrow.
