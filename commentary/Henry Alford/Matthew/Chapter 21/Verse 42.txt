<b> 42.]</b> A citation from<i> the same Psalm of triumph from which the multitudes had taken their Hosannas.</i> This verse is quoted with the same signification in Acts iv. 11: 1 Pet. ii. 6, 7, where also the cognate passage lsa. xxvii. 16 is quoted, as in Rom. ix. 33. The builders answer to the husbandmen, and the addition is made in this changed similitude to shew them<i> that though they might reject and kill the Son, yet He would be victorious in the end.</i>
