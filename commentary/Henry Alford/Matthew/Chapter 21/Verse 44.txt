 44. ] A reference to Isaiah 8:14-15 , and Daniel 2:44 , and  a plain identification of the stone there mentioned with that in Psalms 118:1-29 . The stone is  the whole kingdom and power of the Messiah summed up in Himself .
	 ὁ πεσὼν  .… he that  takes offence , that  makes it a stone of stumbling ,  shall be broken: see Luke 2:34 ; but  on whomsoever, as its enemy,  it shall come in vengeance , as prophesied in Daniel, λικμήσει αὐτόν ,  it shall dash him in pieces. Meyer maintains that the meaning of λικμ . is not this, but literally ‘  shall winnow him ,’ throw him off as chaff (see ref. Job). But the confusion in the parable thus occasioned is quite unnecessary. The result of winnowing is complete separation and dashing away of the worthless part: and it is surely far better to understand this  result as the work of the falling of the stone, than to apply the words to a part of the operation for which the  falling of a stone is so singularly unsuited.
