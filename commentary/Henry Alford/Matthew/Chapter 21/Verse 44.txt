<b> 44.]</b> A reference to Isa. viii. 14, 15, and Dan. ii. 44, and<i> a plain identification of the stone there mentioned with that in</i> Ps. cxviii. The stone is<i> the whole kingdom and power of the Messiah summed up in Himself.</i><br><br><b> he that hath fallen....]</b> he that<i> takes offence, that makes it a stone of stumbling,</i> (or perhaps, he that<i> is superimposed on it,</i> as a stone in the building: but not so probably, as the<i> breaking</i> would want due interpretation,)<b> shall be broken:</b> see Luke ii. 34: but<b> on whomsoever,</b> as its enemy,<i> it shall come in vengeance,</i> as prophesied in Daniel,<b> it shall dash him in pieces.</b> Meyer maintains that the meaning of the word is not this, but literally<i> ‘shall winnow him,’</i> throw him off as chaff. But the confusion thus occasioned in the parable is quite unnecessary. The result of winnowing is complete separation and dashing away of the worthless part: and it is surely far better to understand this<i> result</i> as the work of the falling of the stone, than to apply the words to a part of the operation for which the<i> falling of a stone</i> is so singularly unsuited.
