Hosanna]</b> from Psalm cxviii. 25; = “save now,” a formula originally of supplication, but conventionally of gratulation, so that it is followed by<i> “to&c.”</i> and by “in the highest,” meaning, ‘may it be in heaven!’ see 1 Kings i. 36: Luke ii. 14, where however it is an<i> assertion,</i> not a wish. Luke has<i> “the king that cometh,”</i> John<i> “the king of Israel that cometh.”</i>
