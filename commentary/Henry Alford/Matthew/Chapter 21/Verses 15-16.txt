<p>Psa 8:1-9 is frequently cited in the N.T. of Christ: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:27">1 Corinthians 15:27</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6">Hebrews 2:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span> . In understanding such citations as this, and that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:4">Matthew 21:4</span> , we must bear in mind the important truth, that the external fulfilment of a prophecy is often itself only a type and representation of that inner and deeper sense of the prophecy which belongs to the spiritual dealings of God. Those who can, should by all means consult Stier’s admirable remarks on this truth, vol. ii. p. 340 f. edn. 2.</p>
