 18 22. ] THE CURSE OF THE BARREN FIG-TREE. Mark 11:12-14 ; Mark 11:20-26 , where see notes. St. Luke omits the incident.
	The cursing of the fig-tree  had in fact taken place on the day before , and the withering of it was  now noticed . St. Mark separates the two accounts, which are here given together. We must remember that this miracle was  wholly typical and parabolical . The fig-tree was THE JEWISH PEOPLE full of the leaves of an useless profession, but without fruit: and further, all hypocrites of every kind, in every age. It is true, as De Wette observes, that no trace of a parabolic meaning appears in the narrative (and yet, strangely enough, he himself a few lines after, denying the truth of the miracle, accounts for the narrative by supposing it to have  arisen out of a parable spoken by our Lord); but neither does there in that of the driving out the buyers and sellers from the temple, and in those of many other actions which we know to have been symbolic.
