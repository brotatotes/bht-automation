 2, 3. ]  τὴν κ  .   τ  .   ἀπ  ., i.e. Bethphage. Mark and Luke mention the πῶλος only, adding “  whereon never yet man sat ” (see note on Mark): John ὀνάριον . Justin Martyr (Apolog. i. 32, p. 63) connects this verse with the prophecy in Genesis 49:11 , δεσμεύων πρὸς ἄμπελον τὸν πῶλον αὐτοῦ , καὶ τῇ ἕλικι τὸν πῶλον τῆς ὄνου αὐτοῦ .
