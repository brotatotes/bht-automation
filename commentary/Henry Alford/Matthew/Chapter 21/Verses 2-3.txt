<p><strong> 2, 3.</strong> ] <strong> τὴν κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀπ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> i.e. Bethphage. Mark and Luke mention the πῶλος only, adding “ <em> whereon never yet man sat</em> ” (see note on Mark): John ὀνάριον . Justin Martyr (Apolog. i. 32, p. 63) connects this verse with the prophecy in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:11">Genesis 49:11</span> , δεσμεύων πρὸς ἄμπελον τὸν πῶλον αὐτοῦ , καὶ τῇ ἕλικι τὸν πῶλον τῆς ὄνου αὐτοῦ .

<p><strong> ὁ κύριος</strong> <strong> ,</strong> here, ‘the LORD,’ <strong> Jehovah</strong> (see reff.): most probably a general intimation to the owners, that they were wanted <em> for the service of God</em> . I cannot see how this interpretation errs against decorum, as Stier (ii. 332, edn. 2) asserts. The meanest animals might be wanted for the service of the Lord Jehovah. And after all, what difference is there as to <em> decorum</em> , if we understand with him ὁ κύρ . to signify “the King Messiah”? The two disciples were perhaps Peter and John: compare Mar 14:13 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:8">Luke 22:8</span> .</p>
