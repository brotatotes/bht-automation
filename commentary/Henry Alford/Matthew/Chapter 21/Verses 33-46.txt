 33 46. ] PARABLE OF THE VINEYARD LET OUT TO HUSBANDMEN. Mark 12:1-12 .Luke 20:9-19; Luke 20:9-19 . This parable is in intimate connexion with Isaiah 5:1 ff., and was certainly intended by our Lord as an express application of that passage to the Jews of His time. Both Mark and Luke open it with an ἤρξατο λέγειν …, as a fresh beginning, by our Lord, of a series of parables. Luke adds, that it was spoken πρὸς τὸν λαόν . Its subject is, of course,  the continued rejection of God’s prophets by the people of Israel, till at last they rejected and killed His only Son . The  οἰκοδεσπότης ἐφύτευσεν ἀμπελῶνα  : i.e. ‘  selected it out of all His world, and  fenced it in , and  dug a receptacle for the juice (in the rock or ground, to keep it cool, into which it flowed from the press above, through a grated opening),  and built a tower (of recreation or observation to watch the crops).’ This exactly coincides with the state of the Jewish nation, under covenant with God as His people. All these expressions are in Isaiah 5:1-30 . The  letting out to husbandmen was probably that kind of letting where the tenant pays his rent  in kind , although the καρποί  may be understood of money. God began about 430 years after the Exodus to send His prophets to the people of Israel, and continued even till John the Baptist; but all was in vain; they “persecuted the prophets,” casting them out, and putting them to death. (See Nehemiah 9:26 ; Matthew 23:31 ; Matthew 23:37 ; Hebrews 11:36-38 .)
	The  different sendings must not be pressed; they probably imply the  fulness and sufficiency of warnings given , and set forth the longsuffering of the householder; and the increasing rebellion of the husbandmen is shewn by their increasing ill-treatment of the messengers. Meyer understands αὐτοῦ after καρπούς , Matthew 21:34 , to mean  His fruits; i.e. in  money .
