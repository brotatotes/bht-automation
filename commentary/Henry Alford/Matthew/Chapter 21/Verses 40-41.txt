 40, 41. ] See Isaiah 5:5 . All means had been tried, and nothing but judgment was now left. Mark and Luke omit the important words λέγουσιν αὐτῷ , though Luke has given us the key to them, in telling us that the parable was spoken in the hearing of the  people , who seem to have made the answer. Perhaps however the Pharisees (as suggested by Trench, Parables, in loco) may have made this answer, having  missed , or (as Olshausen thinks, Biblisch. Comm. i. p. 793, and Stier, R. J. ii. 363)  pretended to miss,  the sense of the parable ; but from the strong κακοὺς κακῶς , I incline to the former view. Whichever said it, it was a self-condemnation, similar to that in ch. Matthew 27:25 : the  last form , as Nitzsch finely remarks (cited by Stier, ib.), of the divine warnings to men, ‘when they themselves speak of the deeds which they are about to do, and pronounce judgment upon them.’ So striking, even up to the last moment, is the mysterious union of human free-will with divine foresight (see Acts 2:23 ; Gen 1:20 ), that after all other warnings frustrated, the conscience of the sinner himself interposes to save him from his sin.
	The expression κακοὺς κακῶς ἀπολ . is one of the purest Greek: ἀπό σ ʼ ὀλῶ κακὸν κακῶς , Aristoph. Plut. 65, and indeed passim in the best writers.

We may observe that our Lord here makes  ὅταν ἔλθῃ ὁ κύριος  coincide with the destruction of Jerusalem , which is incontestably the overthrow of the wicked husbandmen. This passage forms therefore an important key to our Lord’s prophecies, and a decisive justification for those who, like myself, firmly hold that  the coming of the Lord is in many places to be identified, primarily, with that overthrow.
