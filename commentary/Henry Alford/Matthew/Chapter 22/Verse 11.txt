<b></b>This second part of the parable is in direct reference to the word of prophecy, Zeph. i. 7, 8:<i> “The Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests. And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice, that I will punish.... all such as are clothed with strange apparel.”</i> The coming of the King to see his guests is the final and separating Judgment of the Church, see ch. xxv. 19,—when that distinction shall be made, which God’s ministers have no power nor right to make in admissions into the visible Church. Yet as Trench remarks (Parables, p. 207), this coming of the King is not<i> exclusively</i> the final one, but every trying and sifting judgment adumbrates it in some measure.
