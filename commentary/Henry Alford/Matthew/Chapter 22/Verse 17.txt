<b> 17.</b>] The<b> tribute</b> here spoken of was a poll-tax, which had been levied since Judæa became a province of Rome.<br><br> The<b> tribute money</b> was a denarius: see on ch. xx. 2. It was a saying of the Rabbis, quoted by Lightfoot and Wetstein, that ‘wherever any king’s money is current, there that king is lord.’ The Lord’s answer convicts them, by the matter of fact that this money was current among them, of subjection to (Tiberius) Cæsar, and recognition of that subjection:<b> Pay therefore</b>, He says,<b> the things which are Cæsar’s to Cæsar, and</b> (not perhaps without reference to the Herodians, but also with much deeper reference)<b> the things that are God’s, to God.</b> These weighty words, so much misunderstood, bind together, instead of separating, the political and religious duties of the followers of Christ. See Jer. xxvii. 4–18: Rom. xiii. 1: 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14: John xix. 11. The second clause comprehends the first, and gives its true foundation: as if it had been, ‘this obedience to Cæsar is but an application of the general principle of obedience to God, of Whom is all power.’ The latter clause thus reaches infinitely deeper than the former: just as our Lord in Luke x. 41, 42 declares a truth reaching far beyond the occasion of the meal.<i> Man is the coinage,</i> and<i> bears the image</i>, of God (Gen. i. 27): and this image<i> is not lost by the fall</i> (Gen. ix. 6: Acts xvii. 29: James iii. 9. See also notes on Luke xv. 8, 9). We owe then<i> ourselves</i> to God: and this solemn duty is implied, of giving ourselves to Him, with all that we have and are. The answer also<i> gives them the real reason why they were now under subjection to Cæsar:</i> viz.<i> because had fallen from their allegiance to God</i>. ‘The question was as if an adulterer were to ask, whether it were lawful for him to pay the penalty of his adultery.’ (Claudius, cited by Stier.) They had again and again rejected their theocratic inheritance;—they refused it in the wilderness;—they would not have God to reign over them, but a king;—therefore were they subjected to foreigners (see 2 Chron. xii. 8).
