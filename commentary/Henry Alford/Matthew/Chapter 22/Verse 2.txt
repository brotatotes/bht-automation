<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] The <em> householder</em> of the former parable is the KING here, who ποιεῖ γάμους for his Son. <strong> γάμοι</strong> are not always necessarily ‘a marriage,’ but any great celebration, as accession to the throne, or coming of age, &amp;c. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="es+1:5">Esther 1:5</span> , LXX. Meyer (in loc.) denies this, but does not refer to the passage of Esther just cited, which to my mind is decisive. Est 9:22 is not satisfactorily explained on his interpretation, viz. that the LXX translate freely and exegetically, but is another instance in point. Here however the notion of a marriage is <em> certainly included</em> ; and the interpretation is, <em> the great marriage supper</em> ( Rev 19:9 ) <em> of the Son of God</em> : i.e. His full and complete union to His Bride the Church in glory: which would be to the guests the ultimate result of accepting the invitation. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25-27">Ephesians 5:25-27</span> . The difficulty, of the <em> totality of the guests</em> in this case constituting <em> the Bride</em> , may be lessened by regarding the ceremony as an enthronization, in which the people are regarded as being espoused to their prince. On the whole imagery, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:1-17">Psalms 45:1-17</span> .</p>
