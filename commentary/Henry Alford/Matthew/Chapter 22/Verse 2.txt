 2. ] The  householder of the former parable is the KING here, who ποιεῖ γάμους for his Son.  γάμοι are not always necessarily ‘a marriage,’ but any great celebration, as accession to the throne, or coming of age, &c. See Esther 1:5 , LXX. Meyer (in loc.) denies this, but does not refer to the passage of Esther just cited, which to my mind is decisive. Est 9:22 is not satisfactorily explained on his interpretation, viz. that the LXX translate freely and exegetically, but is another instance in point. Here however the notion of a marriage is  certainly included ; and the interpretation is,  the great marriage supper ( Rev 19:9 )  of the Son of God : i.e. His full and complete union to His Bride the Church in glory: which would be to the guests the ultimate result of accepting the invitation. See Ephesians 5:25-27 . The difficulty, of the  totality of the guests in this case constituting  the Bride , may be lessened by regarding the ceremony as an enthronization, in which the people are regarded as being espoused to their prince. On the whole imagery, cf. Psalms 45:1-17 .
