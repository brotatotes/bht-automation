These first<i> servants</i> are then<i> the first messengers of the Gospel,</i>—John the Baptist, the Twelve, and the Seventy,—who preached, saying ‘The Kingdom of heaven at hand.” And even our Lord Himself must in some sort be here included, inasmuch as He<i> took the form of a servant,</i> and preached this same truth, with however the weighty addition of<b> Come unto Me.</b>
