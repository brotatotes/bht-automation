Our Lord does not cite the strong testimonies of the Prophets, as Isa. xxvi. 19: Ezek. xxxvii. 1–14: Dan. xii. 2, but says, as in Luke (xx. 37), ‘<i>even Moses has shewn</i>,’&c., leaving those other witnesses to be supplied. The books of Moses were the great and ultimate appeal for all doctrine: and thus the assertion of the Resurrection comes from the very source whence their difficulty had been constructed. On the passage itself, and our Lord’s interpretation of it, much has been written. Certain in it is, that our Lord brings out in this answer a depth of meaning in the words, which without it we could not discover. Meyer finely says, “Our Lord here testifies of the conscious intent of God in speaking the words. God uttered them, He tells us, to Moses, in the consciousness of the still enduring existence of His peculiar relation to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” The groundwork of our Lord’s argument seems to me to be this:—The words “I am thy God’ imply a<i> covenant;</i> there is<i> another side</i> to them: “thou art Mine” follows upon “I am thine.” When God therefore declares that He<i> is the God</i> of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, He declares<i> their continuance</i>, as the other parties in this covenant. It is an assertion which<i> could not be made of an annihilated being of the past</i>. And notice also, that Abraham’s (&c.)<i> body</i> having had upon it<i> the seal of the covenant</i>, is included in this. Stier remarks that this is a weighty testimony against the so-called ‘sleep of the soul’ in the intermediate state. Compare “<i>for all live unto Him</i>” Luke xx. 38. Thus the burden of the Law, ‘I AM THE LORD THY GOD,’ contains in it the seed of immortality, and the hope of the resurrection.
