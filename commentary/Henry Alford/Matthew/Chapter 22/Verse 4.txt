<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] We now come to a different period of the Evangelic announcement. Now, all is ready: <em> the sacrifice</em> , or the meat for the feast, <em> is slain</em> . We can hardly help connecting this with the declarations of our Lord in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51-59">John 6:51-59</span> , and supposing that this second invitation is the preaching of the Apostles and Evangelists <em> after the great sacrifice was offered</em> . That <em> thus</em> the slaying of the Lord is not the <em> doing of the invited</em> , but is mentioned as <em> done for the Feast</em> , is no real difficulty. Both sides of the truth may be included in the parable, as they are in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span> , and indeed wherever it is set forth. The discourse of Peter in that chapter is the best commentary on πάντα ἕτοιμα · δεῦτε εἰς τοὺς γ .

<p>Meyer well remarks that ‘ ἄριστον is not = δεῖπνον , but is the meal at noon with which the course of marriage festivities <em> began</em> .’ This will give even greater precision to the meaning of the parable as applying to these preparatory foretastes of the great feast, which the Church of God now enjoys. As the former parable had an O.T. foundation, so this: viz. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+9:1">Proverbs 9:1</span> ff.</p>
