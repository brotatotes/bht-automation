<b> 7.]</b> The occurrence of this verse before the opening of the Feast to the Gentiles has perplexed some interpreters: but it is strictly exact: for although the Gospel was preached to the Gentiles forty years before the destruction of Jerusalem, yet the final rejection of the Jews and the<i> substitution of the Gentiles</i> did not take till that event.<br><br><b> his armies]</b> The Roman armies; a similar expression for the unconscious instruments of God’s anger is used Isa. x. 5; xiii. 5: Jer. xxv. 9: Joel ii. 25.<br><br><b> their city]</b> no longer<i> His,</i> but<i> their city.</i> Compare<i> your house,</i> ch. xxiii. 38. Thi is a startling introduction of the<i> interpretation into the parable;</i> we knew not before that they had<i> a city.</i><br><br><b> were:</b> the past tense passes them by as done with.<b> The highways</b> here spoken of are the places of resort at the meetings of streets, the squares, or confluences of ways. De Wette and Meyer are wrong in saying that they are not in the city, ‘for that was destroyed:’ it is not<i> the city of the murderers, but that in which the feast is supposed to be held,</i> which is spoken of: not jerusalem, but God’s world.<br><br><b> bad and good]</b> Both the open sinners and the morally good together. See ch. xiii. 47, where the net collects<i> of every kind.</i> Stier remarks, that we might expect, from ch. xxi. 31, to find the guest who by and by is expelled,<i> among the good.</i> Here, so to speak, the<i> first act</i> of the parable closes; and here is the situation of the Church at this day;—collected out of all the earth, and containing both bad and good.<br><br><b> was filled</b> is emphatic.<br><br> With regard to the<b> wedding garment</b>, we must not, I think, make too much of the usually cited Oriental custom of presenting the guests with such garments at feasts. For (1) it is not distinctly proved that such a custom existed; the passages usually quoted (Gen. xiv. 22: Judg. xiv. 12: 2 Kings v. 22) are nothing to the purpose; 2 Kings x. 22 shews that the worshippers of Baal were provided with vestments, and<i> at a feast:</i> and at the present day those who are admitted to the presence of Royalty in the East are clothed with a<i> caftan:</i> but all this does not make good the assumption: and (2) even granting it, it is not to be pressed, as being manifestly not the salient point of this part of the parable. The guest was bound to provide himself with this proper habit, out of respect to the feast and its Author:<i> how</i> this was to be provided, does not<i> here</i> appear, but does<i> elsewhere</i>. The garment is<i> the imputed</i><i> and inherent righteousness of the Lord Jesus</i>, put on<i> symbolically</i> in Baptism (Gal. iii. 27), and<i> really</i> by a true and living faith (ib. ver. 26),—without which none can appear before God in His Kingdom of glory;—Heb. xii. 14: Phil. iii. 7, 8: Eph. iv. 24: Col. iii, 10: Rom. xiii. 14:—which truth could not be put forward here, but at its subsequent manifestation threw its great light over this and other such similitudes and expressions. This guest imagines<i> his own garment</i> will be as acceptable, and therefore neglects to provide himself.
