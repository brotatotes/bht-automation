<b>The highways</b> here spoken of are the places of resort at the meetings of streets, the squares, or confluences of ways. De Wette and Meyer are wrong in saying that they are not in the city, ‘for that was destroyed:’ it is not<i> the city of the murderers, but that in which the feast is supposed to be held,</i> which is spoken of: not jerusalem, but God’s world.
