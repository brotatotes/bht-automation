 1 14. ] PARABLE OF THE MARRIAGE OF THE KING’S SON.  Peculiar to Matthew . A parable resembling this in several particulars occurs in Luke 14:15-24 , yet we must not hastily set it down as the same. Many circumstances are entirely different: the locality and occasion of delivery different, and in both cases stated with precision. And the difference in the style of the parables is correspondent to the two periods of their utterance. That in Luke is delivered earlier in our Lord’s ministry, when the enmity of the Pharisees had yet not fully manifested itself: the refusal of the guests is more courteous, their only penalty,  exclusion ; here they  maltreat the servants , and are  utterly destroyed . This binds the parable in close connexion with that of the wicked husbandmen in the last chapter, and with this period of our Lord’s course.
