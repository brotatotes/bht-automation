 11, 12. ] This second part of the parable is in direct reference to the word of prophecy, Zephaniah 1:7-8 ; cf. especially Matthew 22:8 , καὶ ἔσται ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θυσίας κυρίου καὶ ἐκδικήσω .… ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐνδεδυμένους ἐνδύματα ἀλλότρια . The coming of the King to see his guests is the final and separating Judgment of the Church, see ch. Matthew 25:19 , when that distinction shall be made, which God’s ministers have no power nor right to make in admissions into the visible Church. Yet as Trench remarks (Parables, p. 207), this coming of the King is not  exclusively the final one, but every trying and sifting judgment adumbrates it in some measure. With regard to the  ἔνδυμα γάμου  , we must not, I think, make too much of the usually cited Oriental custom of presenting the guests with such garments at feasts. For (1) it is not distinctly proved that such a custom existed; the passages usually quoted (Genesis 45:22 ; Judges 14:12 ; 2Ki 5:22 ) are nothing to the purpose; 2Ki 10:22 shews that the worshippers of Baal were provided with vestments, and  at a feast : and at the present day those who are admitted to the presence of Royalty in the East are clothed with a  caftan : but all this does not make good the assumption: and (2) even granting it, it is not to be pressed, as being manifestly not the punctum saliens of this part of the parable. The guest was bound to provide himself with this proper habit, out of respect to the feast and its Author:  how this was to be provided, does not  here appear, but does  elsewhere . The garment is  the imputed and inherent righteousness of the Lord Jesus , put on  symbolically in Baptism ( Gal 3:27 ), and  really by a true and living faith (ib. Gal 3:26 ), without which none can appear before God in His Kingdom of Glory; Hebrews 12:14 ; Philippians 3:7-8 ; Ephesians 4:24 ; Colossians 3:10 ; Romans 8:14 : which truth could not be put forward  here , but at its subsequent manifestation threw its great light over this and other such similitudes and expressions. This guest imagines  his own garment will be as acceptable, and therefore neglects to provide himself. See 1 John 5:10 ; Isaiah 64:6 ; Isaiah 61:10 ; Revelation 19:8 .
