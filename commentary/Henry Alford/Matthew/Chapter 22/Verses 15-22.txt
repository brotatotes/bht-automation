 15 22. ] REPLY CONCERNING THE LAWFULNESS OF TRIBUTE TO CÆSAR. Mark 12:13-17 . Luke 20:20-26 . On the  Herodians , see above, ch. Matthew 16:6 . By the union of these two hostile parties they perhaps thought that the ἐγκάθετοι (Luke), who were to feign themselves honest men, Luke 20:20 , would be more likely  to deceive our Lord . For this also is their  flattery here designed. ‘The devil never lies so foully, as when he speaks the truth.’ Meyer compares that other οἴδαμεν ὅτι , John 3:2 . The application may have been as if to settle a dispute which had sprung up between the Pharisees, the strong theocratic repudiators of Roman rule, and the Herodians, the hangerson of a dynasty created by Cæsar. In case the answer were  negative , these last would be witnesses against Him to the governor ( Luk 20:20 ); as indeed they became, with false testimony, when they could not get true, Luke 23:2 ; in case it were  affirmative , He would be compromised with the Roman conquerors, and could not be the people’s deliverer, their expected Messias; which would furnish them with a pretext for stirring up the multitudes against Him (see Deu 17:15 ).
