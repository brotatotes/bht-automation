<p><strong> 15 22.</strong> ] REPLY CONCERNING THE LAWFULNESS OF TRIBUTE TO CÆSAR. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:13-17">Mark 12:13-17</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:20-26">Luke 20:20-26</span> . On the <em> Herodians</em> , see above, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:6">Matthew 16:6</span> . By the union of these two hostile parties they perhaps thought that the ἐγκάθετοι (Luke), who were to feign themselves honest men, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:20">Luke 20:20</span> , would be more likely <em> to deceive our Lord</em> . For this also is their <em> flattery</em> here designed. ‘The devil never lies so foully, as when he speaks the truth.’ Meyer compares that other οἴδαμεν ὅτι , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span> . The application may have been as if to settle a dispute which had sprung up between the Pharisees, the strong theocratic repudiators of Roman rule, and the Herodians, the hangerson of a dynasty created by Cæsar. In case the answer were <em> negative</em> , these last would be witnesses against Him to the governor ( Luk 20:20 ); as indeed they became, with false testimony, when they could not get true, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:2">Luke 23:2</span> ; in case it were <em> affirmative</em> , He would be compromised with the Roman conquerors, and could not be the people’s deliverer, their expected Messias; which would furnish them with a pretext for stirring up the multitudes against Him (see Deu 17:15 ).</p>
