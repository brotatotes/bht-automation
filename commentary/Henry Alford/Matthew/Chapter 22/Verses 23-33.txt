<p><strong> 23 33.</strong> ] REPLY TO THE SADDUCEES RESPECTING THE RESURRECTION. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:18-27">Mark 12:18-27</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:27-40">Luke 20:27-40</span> . From <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:8">Acts 23:8</span> , the Sadducees denied resurrection, angel, and <em> spirit</em> ; consequently the <em> immortality of the soul, as well as the resurrection of the body</em> . This should be borne in mind, as our Lord’s answer is directed against both errors. It is a mistake into which many Commentators (including Wordsw. on the authority of Jerome) have fallen, to suppose that the Sadducees recognized only the Pentateuch: they acknowledged <em> the prophets also</em> , and rejected tradition only (see this abundantly proved by Winer, Realwörterbuch, Sadducäer).</p>
