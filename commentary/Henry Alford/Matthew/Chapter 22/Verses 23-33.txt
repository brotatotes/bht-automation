 23 33. ] REPLY TO THE SADDUCEES RESPECTING THE RESURRECTION. Mark 12:18-27 . Luke 20:27-40 . From Acts 23:8 , the Sadducees denied resurrection, angel, and  spirit ; consequently the  immortality of the soul, as well as the resurrection of the body . This should be borne in mind, as our Lord’s answer is directed against both errors. It is a mistake into which many Commentators (including Wordsw. on the authority of Jerome) have fallen, to suppose that the Sadducees recognized only the Pentateuch: they acknowledged  the prophets also , and rejected tradition only (see this abundantly proved by Winer, Realwörterbuch, Sadducäer).
