 34 40. ] REPLY CONCERNING THE GREAT COMMANDMENT. Mark 12:28-34 . In the more detailed account of Mark (Luke has a similar incident in another place, Luk 10:25 ), this question does not appear as that of one  maliciously tempting our Lord: and his seems to me the view to be taken, as there could not be any evil consequences to our Lord, whichever way He had answered the question. See the notes there.
