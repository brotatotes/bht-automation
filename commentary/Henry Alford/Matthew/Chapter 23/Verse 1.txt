<b> 1.</b>] Much of the matter of this discourse is to be found in Luke xi. and xiii. On its appearance there, see the notes on those passages. There can, I think, be no doubt that it was delivered, as our Evangelist here relates it, all at one time, and in these the last days of our Lord’s ministry. On the notion entertained by some recent critics, of St. Matthew having arranged the scattered sayings of the Lord into longer discourses, see Introduction to Matthew. A trace of this discourse is found in Mark xii. 38–40: Luke xx. 45–47. In the latter place it is spoken<i> to</i> the disciples,<i> in hearing of</i> the crowd: which (see ver. 8 ff.) is the exact account of the matter. It bears many resemblances to the Sermon on the Mount, and may be regarded as the solemn close, as that was the opening, of the Lord’s public teaching. It divides itself naturally into three: (1) introductory description of the Scribes and Pharisees, and contrast to Christ’s disciples (vv. 1–12): (2) solemn denunciations of their hypocrisy (vv. 14–33): (3) conclusion, and mournful farewell to the temple and Jerusalem.
