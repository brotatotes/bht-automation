 1. ] Much of the matter of this discourse is to be found in Luke 11:1-54 ; Luke 13:1-35 . On its appearance there, see the notes on those passages. There can, I think, be no doubt that it was delivered, as our Evangelist here relates it, all at one time, and in these the last days of our Lord’s ministry. On the notion entertained by some recent critics, of St. Matthew having arranged the scattered sayings of the Lord into longer discourses, see Prolegomena to Matthew. A trace of this discourse is found in Mark 12:38-40 ; Luke 20:45-47 . In the latter place it is spoken  to the disciples,  in hearing of the crowd: which (see Matthew 23:8 ff.) is the exact account of the matter. It bears many resemblances to the Sermon on the Mount, and may be regarded as the solemn close, as that was the opening, of the Lord’s public teaching. It divides itself naturally into three parts: (1) introductory description of the Scribes and Pharisees, and contrast to Christ’s disciples ( Mat 23:1-12 ): (2) solemn denunciations of their hypocrisy ( Mat 23:14-33 ): (3) conclusion, and mournful farewell to the temple and Jerusalem.
