<b> 13.</b>] In Luke xi. 52 it is added “<i>ye have taken away the key of knowledge</i>”—the Key being, not the Key<i> of,</i> i.e.<i> admitting to,</i> Knowledge, but the Key<i> which is the Knowledge itself</i>, the true simple interpretation of Scripture, which would have admitted them, and caused them to admit others, into the Kingdom of Heaven, by the recognition of Him of whom the Scriptures testify; whereas now by their perverse interpretations they had shut out both themselves—and others from it. See a notable instance of this latter in John ix. 24. They shut the door as it were in men’s faces who were entering. [On the interpolated ver. 14, see notes on Mark (xii. 40). It is wanting in almost all the oldest authorities. It appears to have been inserted here by the copyists from Mark, as above, or from Luke xx. 47.]
