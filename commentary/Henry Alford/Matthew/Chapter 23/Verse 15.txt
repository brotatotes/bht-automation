<b> 15.</b>] And with all this betrayal of your trust as<i> the teachers of Israel</i> (John iii. 10 literally),<i> as if all your work at home were done.</i> This was their work of supererogation—not commanded them, nor in the spirit of their law. The Lord speaks not here of those pious Godfearing men, who were found dwelling among the Jews, favouring and often attending their worship—but of the<i> proselytes of righteousness</i>, so called, who by persuasion of the Pharisees, took on them the<i> whole Jewish law and its observances</i>. These were rare—and it was to the credit of our nature that they were. For what could such a proselyte, made by such teachers, become? A disciple of hypocrisy merely—neither a sincere heathen nor a sincere Jew—doubly the child of hell: condemned by the religion which he had left—condemned again by that which he had taken.
