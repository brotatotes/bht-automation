<b> 15.</b>] And with all this betrayal of your trust as<i> the teachers of Israel</i> (John iii. 10 literally),<i> as if all your work at home were done.</i> This was their work of supererogation—not commanded them, nor in the spirit of their law. The Lord speaks not here of those pious Godfearing men, who were found dwelling among the Jews, favouring and often attending their worship—but of the<i> proselytes of righteousness</i>, so called, who by persuasion of the Pharisees, took on them the<i> whole Jewish law and its observances</i>. These were rare—and it was to the credit of our nature that they were. For what could such a proselyte, made by such teachers, become? A disciple of hypocrisy merely—neither a sincere heathen nor a sincere Jew—doubly the child of hell: condemned by the religion which he had left—condemned again by that which he had taken.<br><br> The reading<b> dwelt</b> in ver. 21 is remarkable; God did sot then dwell in the Temple, nor had He done so since the Captivity.<br><br><b> these</b>—these last, are the great points on which your exertions should have been spent—and then, if for the sake of these they be observed, the others should not be neglected. The gold here is probably not the ornamental gold, but the Corban—the sacred treasure. They were fools and blind, not to know and see, that no<i> inanimate thing can witness an oath</i>, but they all these things are called in to do so because of<i> sanctity</i> belonging to them, of which God<i> is the primary source</i>:—the<i> order</i> likewise of the<i> things hallowed</i> being, in their foolish estimate of them,<i> reversed</i>: for the<i> gold</i> must be les than the<i> temple which hallows it,</i> and the<i> gift</i> than the<i> altar</i>—not as if this were of any real consequence, except to shew their folly—for vv. 20–22,<i> every oath</i> is really an<i> oath by God</i>. But these men were servants only of the temple ( “<i>your house</i>, ver. 38) and the altar, and had forgotten God. “<i>The straining the gnat</i> is not a mere proverbial saying. The jews (as do now the Buddists in Ceylon and Hindustan) strained their wine, &c., carefully that they might not violate Levit. xi. 20, 23, 41, 42 (and, it might be added, Levit, xvii. 10–14). The<i> “strain af a gnat</i>” in our present auth. vers. for “strain out a gnat of the earlier English vers. seems not to have been a mistake, as sometimes supposed but a deliberate alteration, meaning, “strain [out the wine] at [the occurrence of] a gnat.” The camel is not only<i> opposed</i>, as of immense size, but is also joined with the other as being equally clean.<br><br> are fall of] the straining out of the gnat is a cleansing pertaining to the<i> outside</i>, as compared with the<i> inner composition of the wine itself,</i> of which the cup is fall: see Rev. xviii. 3. The exterior is not in reality pure when the interior is foul: it is not ‘a clean cup,’ unless both exterior and interior be clean. Observe, the emphasis is on be: “that its exterior also may not appear to be, but really<i> become</i>, pure.”
