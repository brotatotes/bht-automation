It was doubtful, whether Levit. xxvii. 30 applied to every smallest garden herb: but the<b> Pharisees</b>, in their over-rigidity in externals, stretched it to this, letting go the heavier, more difficult and more important (see ver. 4) matters of the Law. In the threefold enumeration, our Lord refers to Micah vi. 8 (see also Hosea xii. 6)—where<i> to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God,</i> are described as being better than all offerings.<br><br><b> these</b>—these last, are the great points on which your exertions should have been spent—and then, if for the sake of these they be observed, the others should not be neglected. The gold here is probably not the ornamental gold, but the Corban—the sacred treasure. They were fools and blind, not to know and see, that no<i> inanimate thing can witness an oath</i>, but they all these things are called in to do so because of<i> sanctity</i> belonging to them, of which God<i> is the primary source</i>:—the<i> order</i> likewise of the<i> things hallowed</i> being, in their foolish estimate of them,<i> reversed</i>: for the<i> gold</i> must be les than the<i> temple which hallows it,</i> and the<i> gift</i> than the<i> altar</i>—not as if this were of any real consequence, except to shew their folly—for vv. 20–22,<i> every oath</i> is really an<i> oath by God</i>.
