 35.] that, not ‘in such a way that,’ as some: but strictly in order that.<b> righteous</b> (or<i> innocent</i>)<b> blood</b> is a common expression in the O.T. See 2 Kings xxi. 16; xxiv. 4: Jer. xxvi. 15; and more especially Lam. iv. 13, which perhaps our Lord referred to in speaking this.<br><br><b> all the.... blood]</b> Thus in Babylon, Rev. xviii. 24, is found<i> the blood of all that were slain upon the earth</i>. Every such signal judgment is the judgment for a series of long-crying crimes—and these judgments do not exhaust God’s anger, Isa. ix. 12, 17, 21. The<i> murder of Abel</i> was the<i> first</i> in the strife between unrighteousness and holiness, and as these Jews represent, in their conduct both in former times and now, the murderer of the<br><br> Who<b> Zacharias son of Barachias</b> is has been much disputed. We may conclude with certainty that it cannot be (as Augustine and Greswell suppose)<i> a future Zacharias,</i> mentioned by Josephus, as son of Baruch, and slain in the temple just before the destruction of Jerusalem—for our Lord evidently speaks of an event<i> past</i>, and never<i> prophesies</i> in this manner elsewhere. Origen has preserved a tradition, that<i> Zacharias father of John the Baptist</i> was slain by them in the temple; but in the absence of all other authority, this must be suspected as having arisen from the difficulty of the allusion here. Most likely (see Lightfoot in loc., and note on Luke xi. 49) it is<i> Zacharias the son of Jehoiada</i>, who was killed there, 2 Chron. xxiv. 21, and of whose blood the Jews had a saying, that it never was washed away till the temple was burnt at the captivity.<br><br><b> son of Barachias</b> does not occur in Luke xi. 51, and perhaps was not uttered by the Lord Himself, but may have been inserted by mistake, as<i> Zachariah the prophet was son of Barachiah,</i> see Zech. i. 1.<br><br><b> between the temple and the altar]</b> He was killed in the<i> priest’s court</i>, where the altar of burnt-offerings was. On ver. 36, see note on ch. xxiv. 34, It is no objection to the interpretation there maintained that the<i> whole period</i> of the Jewish course of crime is not filled up by it: the death of Abel can by no explanation be brought within its limits or responsibility and our Lord’s saying reaches far deeper than a mere announcement of their responsibility for what<i> they themselves had done.</i> The Jews stood in<i> the central point of God's dealings with men</i>; and as they were the chosen for the election of grace, so, rejecting God and His messengers, they became, in an especial and awful manner, vessels of wrath.<br><br> Our Lord mentions this<i> last murder</i>, not as being the<i> last</i> even before His own day, but<i> because it was connected specially with the cry of the dying man,</i> ‘The Lord look upon it<i> and require it</i>.’ Compare Gen. iv. 10. This death of Zacharias<i> was the</i><i> last</i> in the<i> arrangement of the Hebrew Canon</i> of the O.T., though<i> chronologically</i> that of Urijah, Jer. xxvi. 23, was later.
