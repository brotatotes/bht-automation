Every such signal judgment is the judgment for a series of long-crying crimes and these judgments do not exhaust God’s anger, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:12">Isaiah 9:12</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:17">Isaiah 9:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:21">Isaiah 9:21</span> .

<p>The <em> murder of Abel</em> was the <em> first</em> in the strife between unrighteousness and holiness, and as these Jews represent, in their conduct both in former times and now, the murderer of the first, they must bear the vengeance of the whole in God’s day of wrath.

<p>Who <strong> Zacharias son of Barachias</strong> is has been much disputed. We may conclude with certainty that it cannot be (as Aug [162] and Greswell suppose) a <em> future</em> Zacharias, mentioned by Josephus, B. J. iv. 5. 4, as son of Baruch, and slain in the temple just before the destruction of Jerusalem for our Lord evidently speaks of an event <em> past</em> , and never <em> prophesies</em> in this manner elsewhere. Origen has preserved a tradition (in Matt. Comm. Series, 24, vol. iii. p. 846), that <em> Zacharias father of John the Baptist</em> was slain by them in the temple; but in the absence of all other authority, this must be suspected as having arisen from the difficulty of the allusion here. Most likely (see Lightfoot in loc. and note on Luk 11:49 ) it is <em> Zacharias the son of Jehoiada</em> , who was killed there, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:21">2 Chronicles 24:21</span> , and of whose blood the Jews had a saying, that it never was washed away till the temple was burnt at the captivity.

<p><strong> υἱοῦ Βαραχίου</strong> does not occur in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:51">Luke 11:51</span> , and perhaps was not uttered by the Lord Himself, but may have been inserted by mistake, as <em> Zacharias the prophet</em> was son of Barachiah, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="zec+1:1">Zechariah 1:1</span> ; a circumstance suppressed by Bp. Wordsworth in his elaborate account of the mystical reason of the patronymic being used here, as “signifying Son of the Blessed, which was a name of Christ Himself.” See his note.

It is no objection to the interpretation there maintained, that the <em> whole period</em> of the Jewish course of crime is not filled up by it: the <em> death of Abel</em> can by no explanation be brought within its limits or responsibility; and our Lord’s saying reaches far deeper than a mere announcement of their responsibility for what <em> they themselves had done</em> . The Jews stood in the <em> central point of God’s dealings with men</em> ; and as they were the chosen for the election of grace, so, rejecting God and His messengers, they became, in an especial and awful manner, vessels of wrath.

<p>Our Lord mentions <em> this last murder</em> , not as being the <em> last</em> even before His own day, but <em> because it was connected specially with the cry of the dying man</em> , ‘The Lord look upon it <em> and require it</em> .’ Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:10">Genesis 4:10</span> . This death of Zacharias <em> was the last</em> in the <em> arrangement of the Hebrew Canon</em> of the O.T., though <em> chronologically</em> that of Urijah, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+26:23">Jeremiah 26:23</span> , was later.</p>
