<b> 4.</b>] The warning was,<i> imitate</i> them not—for they do not themselves what they enjoin on others. And this verse must be strictly connected with ver. 3. The<b> burdens</b> then are not, as so often misinterpreted,<i> human traditions</i> and observances;—but the<i> severity of the law</i>, which they enforce on others, but do not observe (see Rom. ii. 21–23): answering to the<b> weightier</b><i> matters of the law</i> of ver. 23. The irksomeness and unbearableness of these rites did not belong to the Law<i> in itself</i>, as rightly explained, but were created by the rigour and ritualism of these men, who followed the letter and lost the spirit; who spent all their labour in enforcing and amplifying ceremonies.<br><br><b> phylacteries</b> were strips of parchment with certain of Scripture, viz. Exod. xiii. 11–16 and 1–10: Deut. xi. 13–21; vi. 4–9, written on them, and worn on the forehead between the eyes, on the left side next the heart, and on the left arm. The name in the text was given because they were considered as charms. They appear not to have been worn till after the captivity; and are still in use among the rabbinical Jews. Their use appears to have arisen from a superstitious interpretation of Exod. xiii. 9: Deut. vi. 8, 9. See Joseph. Antt. iv. 8. 13. The<b> hems</b> or<i> fringes</i>, were commanded to be worn for a memorial, Num. xv. 38. See note on ch. ix. 20.<br><br><b> Rabbi:</b> i.e. ‘<i>my master:</i>’ an expression used, and reduplicated as here, by scholars to their masters, who were never called by their own name by their scholars. So the Lord says, John xiii. 13, “<i>ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am.</i>” The Teacher is probably not<i> Christ</i>, as supplied here in the received text, but the Holy Spirit (see John xiv. 26: Jer. xxxi. 33, 34: Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27), only<i> not here named</i>, because this promise was only given in private<i> to the disciples</i>. If this be so, we have God, in His Triunity, here declared to us as the only Father, Master, and Teacher of Christians; the only One, in all these relations, on whom they can rest or depend. They are all<i> brethren:</i> all substantially equal—<i>none by office or precedence nearer to God than another; none standing between his brother and God</i>. ‘And the duty of all Christian teachers is to bring their hearers to the confession of the Samaritans in John iv. 42: “<i>Now we believe, not because of thy saying, for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that this is the Saviour of the world.</i>”’
