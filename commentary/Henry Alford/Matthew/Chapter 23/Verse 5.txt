But whatever they<i> do</i> perform, has but one motive.<br><br><b> phylacteries</b> were strips of parchment with certain of Scripture, viz. Exod. xiii. 11–16 and 1–10: Deut. xi. 13–21; vi. 4–9, written on them, and worn on the forehead between the eyes, on the left side next the heart, and on the left arm. The name in the text was given because they were considered as charms. They appear not to have been worn till after the captivity; and are still in use among the rabbinical Jews. Their use appears to have arisen from a superstitious interpretation of Exod. xiii. 9: Deut. vi. 8, 9. See Joseph. Antt. iv. 8. 13. The<b> hems</b> or<i> fringes</i>, were commanded to be worn for a memorial, Num. xv. 38. See note on ch. ix. 20.
