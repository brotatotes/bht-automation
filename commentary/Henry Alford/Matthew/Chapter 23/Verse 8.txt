The prohibition is against loving, and in any religious matter, using such titles, signifying dominion over the faith of others. It must be understood in the spirit and not in the letter. Paul calls Timotheus his ‘<i>son</i>’ in the faith, 1 Tim. i. 2, and exhorts the Corinthians (1 Cor. xi. 1) to be followers of him as he of Christ. To understand and follow such commands in the slavery of the letter, is to fall into the very Pharisaism against which our Lord is uttering the caution. See (e. g.) Barnes’s note here.<br><br><b> Rabbi:</b> i.e. ‘<i>my master:</i>’ an expression used, and reduplicated as here, by scholars to their masters, who were never called by their own name by their scholars. So the Lord says, John xiii. 13, “<i>ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am.</i>” The Teacher is probably not<i> Christ</i>, as supplied here in the received text, but the Holy Spirit (see John xiv. 26: Jer. xxxi. 33, 34: Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27), only<i> not here named</i>, because this promise was only given in private<i> to the disciples</i>. If this be so, we have God, in His Triunity, here declared to us as the only Father, Master, and Teacher of Christians; the only One, in all these relations, on whom they can rest or depend. They are all<i> brethren:</i> all substantially equal—<i>none by office or precedence nearer to God than another; none standing between his brother and God</i>. ‘And the duty of all Christian teachers is to bring their hearers to the confession of the Samaritans in John iv. 42: “<i>Now we believe, not because of thy saying, for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that this is the Saviour of the world.</i>”’
