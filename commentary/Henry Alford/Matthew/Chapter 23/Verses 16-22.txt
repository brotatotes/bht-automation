<p><strong> 16 22.</strong> ] The Lord <em> forbade all swearing</em> to His own disciples, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:34">Matthew 5:34</span> ; and by the very same reasoning because every oath is really and eventually an oath by God shews these Pharisees the validity and solemnity of every oath. “This subterfuge became notorious at Rome. ‘Ecce negas, jurasque mihi per templa Tonantis; Non credo: jura, verpe, per Anchialum,’ = am chai aloh (as God liveth). Martial xi. 94” (F. M.). The gold here is probably not the ornamental gold, but the Corban the sacred treasure. (This Meyer doubts, because the question here is not of <em> vows</em> . But in the absence of any examples of an oath <em> by the gold of the temple</em> , it is just as likely as the other interpretation.) They were <strong> fools and blind,</strong> not to know and see, that <em> no inanimate thing can witness an oath</em> , but that all these things are called in to do so because of <em> sanctity</em> belonging to them, of which <em> God is the primary source</em> the <em> order</em> likewise of the <em> things hallowed</em> , being, in their foolish estimate of them, <em> reversed</em> : for, the <em> gold</em> must be less than the <em> temple which hallows it</em> , and the <em> gift</em> than the <em> altar</em> not as if this were of any real consequence, except to shew their folly for, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:20-22">Matthew 23:20-22</span> , <em> every oath</em> is really an <em> oath by God</em> . But these men were servants only of the temple ( ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν , Mat 23:38 ) and the altar, and had forgotten God.

<p><strong> κατοικήσαντι</strong> (not κατοικοῦντι is remarkable: God did <em> not then</em> dwell in the Temple, nor had He done so since the Captivity. (This <em> may</em> perhaps be so: but grammatically it is hardly probable. Rather should I say now, with Meyer, that the aor. refers to the one definite act by which God took possession of the temple as His dwelling-place on its dedication by Solomon; without any allusion to present circumstances.)</p>
