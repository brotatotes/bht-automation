 16 22. ] The Lord  forbade all swearing to His own disciples, ch. Matthew 5:34 ; and by the very same reasoning because every oath is really and eventually an oath by God shews these Pharisees the validity and solemnity of every oath. “This subterfuge became notorious at Rome. ‘Ecce negas, jurasque mihi per templa Tonantis; Non credo: jura, verpe, per Anchialum,’ = am chai aloh (as God liveth). Martial xi. 94” (F. M.). The gold here is probably not the ornamental gold, but the Corban the sacred treasure. (This Meyer doubts, because the question here is not of  vows . But in the absence of any examples of an oath  by the gold of the temple , it is just as likely as the other interpretation.)
