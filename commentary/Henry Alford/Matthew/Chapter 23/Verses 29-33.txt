 29 33. ] The guilt resting on these present Pharisees, from being the last in a progressive series of generations of such hypocrites and persecutors, forms the matter of the last Woe. The burden of this hypocrisy is, that they, being one with their fathers, treading in their steps, but vainly disavowing their deeds, were, by the very act of building the sepulchres of the prophets, joined with their prophet-persecuting acts, convicting themselves of continuity with their fathers’ wickedness. See, as clearly setting forth this view, Luke 11:47-48 . ‘(Sit licet divus, dummodo non vivus). Instead of the penitent confession, “We have sinned, we and our fathers,” this last and worst generation in vain protests against their participation in their fathers’ guilt, which they are meanwhile developing to the utmost, and filling up its measure ( Act 7:52 ).’ Stier (ii. 453). Again notice the emphasis, which is now markedly on νἱοί ; thus bringing out that relation in all its fulness and consequences.
	 πληρώσατε  , imper.,  fill ye also (as well as they)  the measure (of iniquity)  of your fathers.
	Mat 23:33 repeats almost verbatim the first denunciation of the Baptist in this, the last discourse of the Lord: thus denoting the unchanged state of these men, on whom the whole preaching of repentance had now been expended. One weighty difference however there is: then it was,  τίς ὑπέδειξεν ὑμῖν φυγεῖν ; the wonder was,  how they bethought themselves of escaping now,  πῶς φύγητε  ; how shall ye escape?
