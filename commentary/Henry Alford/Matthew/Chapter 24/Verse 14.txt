 14. ] We here again have the  pregnant meaning of prophecy. The Gospel had been preached through the whole ‘orbis terrarum,’ and every nation had received its testimony, before the destruction of Jerusalem: see Colossians 1:6 ; Colossians 1:23 ; 2 Timothy 4:17 . This was necessary not only as regarded the Gentiles, but to give to God’s people the Jews, who were scattered among all these nations,  the opportunity of receiving or rejecting the preaching of Christ . But in the wider sense, the words imply that the Gospel shall be preached in  all the world, literally taken , before the great and final end come. The  apostasy of the latter days , and the  universal dispersion of missions , are the two great signs of the end drawing near.
