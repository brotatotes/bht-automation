<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] We here again have the <em> pregnant</em> meaning of prophecy. The Gospel had been preached through the whole ‘orbis terrarum,’ and every nation had received its testimony, before the destruction of Jerusalem: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:17">2 Timothy 4:17</span> . This was necessary not only as regarded the Gentiles, but to give to God’s people the Jews, who were scattered among all these nations, <em> the opportunity of receiving or rejecting the preaching of Christ</em> . But in the wider sense, the words imply that the Gospel shall be preached in <em> all the world, literally taken</em> , before the great and final end come. The <em> apostasy of the latter days</em> , and the <em> universal dispersion of missions</em> , are the two great signs of the end drawing near.</p>
