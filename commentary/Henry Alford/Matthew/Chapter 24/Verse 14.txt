<b> 14.</b>] We here again have the<i> pregnant</i> meaning of prophecy. The Gospel had been preach rough the whole<i> Roman world</i>, and every nation had received its testimony, before the destruction of Jerusalem: see Col. i. 6, 23: 2 Tim. iv. 17. This was necessary not only as regarded the Gentiles, but to give to Godâ€™s people the Jews, who were scattered among all these nations, the opportunity of<i> receiving or rejecting the preaching of Christ.</i> But in the wider sense, the words imply that the Gospel shall be preached in<i> all the world, literally taken</i>, before the great and final end come. T<i> he apostasy of the latter days, and the universal dispersion of missions</i>, are the two great signs of the end drawing near.
