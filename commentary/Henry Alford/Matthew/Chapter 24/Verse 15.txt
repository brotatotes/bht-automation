 15.<b> the abomination of desolation]</b> The Greek words are the LXX rendering of the Hebrew of Dan. xii. 11. The similar expression in ch. xi. 31, is rendered in the same manner by the LXX. To what<i> exactly</i> the words in Daniel apply, is not clear. Like other prophecies it is probable that they are pregnant with several interpretations, and are not yet entirely fulfilled. They were interpreted of<i> Antiochus Epiphanes</i> by the Alexandrine Jews; thus 1 Macc. i. 54 we read “<i>they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar</i>.” Josephus refers the prophecy to the<i> desolation by the Romans.</i> The principal Commentators have supposed, that<i> the eagles of the Roman legions</i> are meant, which were as abomination inasmuch as they were idols worshipped by the soldiers. These, they say, stood<i> in the holy place</i>, or a holy place, when the Roman armies encamped round Jerusalem under Cestius Gallus first, A.D. 66, then under Vespasian, A.D. 68, then lastly under Titus, A.D. 70. Of these the first is generally taken as the sign meant. Josephus relates, B.J. ii. 20. 1, that after Cestius was defeated, “many of the principal Jews removed from the city, as from a sinking ship.” But, without denying that this<i> time</i> was that of the sign being given, I believe that all such interpretation of its meaning are wholly inapplicable The error has mainly arisen from supposing that the parallel warning of St. Luke (ver. 20), “When see Jerusalem encompassed with armies, then her desolation draweth nigh,” is identical in meaning with our text and that of St. Mark. The two first evangelist, writing for Jews, or as Jews, give the<i> inner or domestic</i> sign of the approaching calamity: which was to be seen in<i> the temple</i>, and was to be the<i> abomination</i> (always used of something caused by the Jews themselves, see 2 Kings, xxi. 2–15: Ezek. v. 11; vii. 8, 9; viii. 6–16) which should<i> cause the desolation</i>,—the last drop in the cup of iniquity. Luke, writing for Gentiles, gives the<i> outward state of things</i> corresponding to this inward sign. That the<i> Roman eagles cannot be meant</i>, is apparent: for the sign would thus be<i> no sign</i>, the Roman eagles having been seen on holy ground for<i> many years past</i>, and at the very moment when these words were uttered. Also holy place must mean<i> the temple</i>: see reff.
