<b> 15. the abomination of desolation</b>] The Greek words are the LXX rendering of the Hebrew of Dan. xii. 11. The similar expression in ch. xi. 31, is rendered in the same manner by the LXX. To what<i> exactly</i> the words in Daniel apply, is not clear. Like other prophecies it is probable that they are pregnant with several interpretations, and are not yet entirely fulfilled. They were interpreted of<i> Antiochus Epiphanes</i> by the Alexandrine Jews; thus 1 Macc. i. 54 we read “<i>they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar</i>.” Josephus refers the prophecy to the<i> desolation by the Romans.</i> The principal Commentators have supposed, that<i> the eagles of the Roman legions</i> are meant, which were as abomination inasmuch as they were idols worshipped by the soldiers. These, they say, stood<i> in the holy place</i>, or a holy place, when the Roman armies encamped round Jerusalem under Cestius Gallus first, A.D. 66, then under Vespasian, A.D. 68, then lastly under Titus, A.D. 70. Of these the first is generally taken as the sign meant. Josephus relates, B.J. ii. 20. 1, that after Cestius was defeated, “many of the principal Jews removed from the city, as from a sinking ship.” But, without denying that this<i> time</i> was that of the sign being given, I believe that all such interpretation of its meaning are wholly inapplicable The error has mainly arisen from supposing that the parallel warning of St. Luke (ver. 20), “When see Jerusalem encompassed with armies, then her desolation draweth nigh,” is identical in meaning with our text and that of St. Mark. The two first evangelist, writing for Jews, or as Jews, give the<i> inner or domestic</i> sign of the approaching calamity: which was to be seen in<i> the temple</i>, and was to be the<i> abomination</i> (always used of something caused by the Jews themselves, see 2 Kings, xxi. 2–15: Ezek. v. 11; vii. 8, 9; viii. 6–16) which should<i> cause the desolation</i>,—the last drop in the cup of iniquity. Luke, writing for Gentiles, gives the<i> outward state of things</i> corresponding to this inward sign. That the<i> Roman eagles cannot be meant</i>, is apparent: for the sign would thus be<i> no sign</i>, the Roman eagles having been seen on holy ground for<i> many years past</i>, and at the very moment when these words were uttered. Also holy place must mean<i> the temple</i>: see reff.<br><br> Now in searching for some event which may have given such alarm to the Christians. Josephus’s unconscious admission is important. The party of the Zelots, as we learn, had taken possession of the temple. In the next section he tells us that they chose one Phannius as their high priest, an ignorant and profane fellow, brought out of the field. I own that the above-cited passages strongly incline me to think that if not this very impiety, some similar one, about ora little before this time, was the sign spoken of by the Lord. In its place in Josephus, this very event<i> seems</i> to stand a little too late for our purpose (4. D. 67, a year after the investment by Cestius): but the narrative occurs in a description of the atrocities of the Zelote, and<i> without any fixed date</i>, and they had been in possession of the temple from the very first. So that this or some similar abomination may have about this time filled up the cup of iniquity and given the sign to the Christians to depart. Whatever it was, it was a<i> definite, well-marked event,</i> for the flight was to be immediate,<br><br><i> on one day</i> (see ver. 20), and universal from all parts of Judaea. Putting then St. Luke’s expression and the text together, I think that some<i> internal desecration of, the holy place by the Zelots</i> coincided with the approach of Cestius, and thus, both from without and within, the Christians were warned to escape. See Luke xxi. 20.<br><br><b> whoso readeth, let him understand]</b> This I believe to have been an ecclesiastical note, which, like the doxology in ch. vi. 13, has found its way into the text. If the two first Gospels were published before the destruction of Jerusalem, such an admonition would be very intelligible. Thewords<i> ‘may</i> be part of our Lord’s discourse directing attention to the prophecy of Daniel (see 2 Tim. ii. 7: Dan. xii. 10); but this is not likely, especially<i> as the reference to Daniel</i> does not occur in Mark, where these words are also found. They<i> cannot</i> well be the words of the Evangelist, inserted to bespeak attention, as this in the three first Gospels is wholly without example.
