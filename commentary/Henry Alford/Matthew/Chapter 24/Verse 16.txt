The Christian Jews are said to have fled to<i> Pella</i>, a town described by Josephus as the northernmost boundary of Perea. Eusebius says they were directed thither by a certain prophetic intimation, which however cannot be this; as Pella is<i> not on the mountains</i>, but beyond them (but in order to reach it would not they have to fly exactly over [so literally here] the mountains? See note on ch. xviii, 12):â€”Epiphanius, that they were warned an angel.
