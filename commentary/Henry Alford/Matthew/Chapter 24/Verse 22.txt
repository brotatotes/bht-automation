 22.] If God had not in his mercy shortened (by His decree) those days ( ‘<i>the days of vengeance</i>,’ Luke xxi. 22),<i> the whole nation</i> (in the ultimate fulfilment,<i> all flesh</i>) would have perished; but for the sake of the chosen ones,—the believing,—or those who should believe,—or perhaps the preservation of the chosen race whom God hath not cast off, Rom. xi. 1,—they shall be shortened. It appears that besides<i> the cutting short in the Divine counsels,</i> which must be hidden from us, various causes combined to shorten the siege. (1) Herod Agrippa had begun strengthening the walls of Jerusalem in a way which if finished would have rendered them able to resist all human violence, but was stopped by orders from Claudius, A. D 42 or 43, Jos. Antt. xix. 7. 2. (2) The Jews, being divided into factions among themselves, had totally neglected any preparations o stand a siege (3) The magazines of corn and provision were burnt just before the arrival of Titus; the words of Josephus are remarkable on this: “Within a little all the corn was burnt, which would have lasted them many years of siege.” 4) Titus arrived suddenly, and the Jews voluntarily abandoned parts of the fortification (Jewish Wars, vi. 8. 4). (5) Titus himself confessed, “God has fought for us, and He it is who has deprived the Jews of these their fortifications: for what could human hands or engines do against these towers?” Some such providential shortening of the great days of tribulation, and hastening of God’s glorious Kingdom, is here promised for the<i> latter times.</i>
