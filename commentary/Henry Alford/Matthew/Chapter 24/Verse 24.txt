 24.<b> For many...]</b> This was the first danger awaiting them: not of being drawn away from Christ, but of<i><b> imagining: that these persons were Himself</b></i>. Of such before the destruction of Jerusalem we have no distinct record; doubtless there were such: but (see above) I believe the prophecy and warning to have a further reference to the latter times, in which its complete fulfilment must be looked for. The persons usually cited as fulfilling this (Theudas, Simon, Magus, Barchochab, &c.) are all too early or too late, and not correspondent to the condition, in<b> My name,</b> ‘with My name as the<i> ground</i> of their pretences.’ See Greswell on the Parables, v. 380 note. St. Luke gives an addition (ver. 8) to the speech of the<i> false Christs</i>, “<i>and the time is at hand.</i>”<br><br><b> earthquakes</b>] The principal<i> earthquakes</i> occurring between this prophecy and the destruction of Jerusalem were, (1) a great earthquake’ in Crete, A.D. 46 or 47; (2) one at Rome on the day when Nero assumed the manly toga A.D. 51; (8) one at Apamea in Phrygia, mentioned by Tacitus, A.D. 53; (4) one at Laodicea in Phrygia, A.D. 60; (5) one in Campania. Seneca, in the year ‘A. D. 58, writes:— ‘How often have cities of Asia and Achaea fallen with one fatal shock!how many cities have been swallowed up in Syria, how many in Macedonia!How often has Cyprus been wasted by this calamity!How often has Paphos become a ruin!News has often been brought us of the demolition of whole cities at once.”<br><br> The prophecy, mentioning in<i> divers</i><b> places</b> (<b>place for place</b>,—i. e. here and there, each in its particular locality; as we say, “up and down”), does not seem to imply that the earthquakes should be in Judaea or Jerusalem. We have an account of one in Jerusalem, in Josephus, which Mr. Greswell (as above) places about Nov. A.D. 67. On the additions in Luke xxi. 11, see notes there and on this whole passage see the prophecies in 2 Chron. xv. 5–7, and Jer. li. 45, 46.<br><br><b> the beginning of sorrows</b> (literally<b> of birth pangs</b>)] in reference to the<i> regeneration</i> (ch. xix, 28), which is to precede the<i> consummation of this age.</i> So Paul in Rom. viii. 22, the whole creation..<i>. travaileth together until now.</i> The death-throes of the Jewish state the ‘regeneration’ of the universal Christian Church, as the death-throes of this world the new heavens and new earth.<br><br><b> ye shall be hated]</b> See Acts xxviii. 22. Tacitus says that Nero, for the conflagration of Rome, persecuted the Christians, ‘<i>a race of men detested for their crimes</i>;’ also see 1 Pet. ii, 12; iii, 16; iv. 14–16. In chap. x. 22, from which these verses are repeated, we have only “<i>of all</i>” (men)—here<b> nations</b> is added, giving particularity to the prophecy.
