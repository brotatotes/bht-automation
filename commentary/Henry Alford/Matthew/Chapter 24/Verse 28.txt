 28. ] The stress is on  ὅπου ἐάν and  ἐκεῖ  , pointing out the  universality . In the similar discourse, Luke 17:37 , before this saying, the disciples ask, ‘Where, Lord?’ The answer is, first,  at Jerusalem : where the corrupting body lies, thither shall the vultures (literally) gather themselves together, coming as they do from far on the scent of prey. Secondly, in its final fulfilment,  over the whole world ; for that is the πτῶμα now, and the ἀετοί the angels of vengeance. See Deuteronomy 28:49 , which is probably here referred to; also Hosea 8:1 ; Habakkuk 1:8 . The interpretation (Theophylact, Euthym [167] , Calvin, Bp. Wordsw., &c) which makes the πτῶμα  our Lord , and the ἀετοί  the elect , is quite beside the purpose. The mystical defence of it may be seen in Wordsw.’s notes. Neither is any allusion (Lightfoot, Ham., Wetstein, Wolf, &c.) to the  Roman eagles to be for a moment thought of. The ἀετοί are the  vultures (vultur percnopterus, Linn.), usually reckoned by the ancients as belonging to the eagle kind, Plin. Nat. Hist. ix. 3.
