<p><strong> 28.</strong> ] The stress is on <strong> ὅπου ἐάν</strong> and <strong> ἐκεῖ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> pointing out the <em> universality</em> . In the similar discourse, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:37">Luke 17:37</span> , before this saying, the disciples ask, ‘Where, Lord?’ The answer is, first, <em> at Jerusalem</em> : where the corrupting body lies, thither shall the vultures (literally) gather themselves together, coming as they do from far on the scent of prey. Secondly, in its final fulfilment, <em> over the whole world</em> ; for that is the πτῶμα now, and the ἀετοί the angels of vengeance. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+28:49">Deuteronomy 28:49</span> , which is probably here referred to; also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ho+8:1">Hosea 8:1</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="hab+1:8">Habakkuk 1:8</span> . The interpretation (Theophylact, Euthym [167] , Calvin, Bp. Wordsw., &amp;c) which makes the πτῶμα <em> our Lord</em> , and the ἀετοί <em> the elect</em> , is quite beside the purpose. The mystical defence of it may be seen in Wordsw.’s notes. Neither is any allusion (Lightfoot, Ham., Wetstein, Wolf, &amp;c.) to the <em> Roman eagles</em> to be for a moment thought of. The ἀετοί are the <em> vultures</em> (vultur percnopterus, Linn.), usually reckoned by the ancients as belonging to the eagle kind, Plin. Nat. Hist. ix. 3.
