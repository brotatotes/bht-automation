 29.   εὐθέως ] All the difficulty which this word has been supposed to involve has arisen from confounding the  partial fulfilment of the prophecy with its  ultimate one. The important insertion in Luke ( Luk 21:23-24 ) shews us that the θλῖψις includes ὀργὴ τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ , which is yet being inflicted: and the treading down of Jerusalem by the Gentiles, still going on (see note there): and immediately after  that tribulation which shall happen  when the cup of Gentile iniquity is full , and  when the Gospel shall have been preached in all the world for a witness,  and rejected by the Gentiles , ( πληρωθῶσιν καιροὶ ἐθνῶν ,) shall the coming of the Lord Himself happen. On the indefiniteness of this assigned period in the prophecy, see note on Matthew 24:3 . (The expression in Mark is equally indicative of a considerable interval; ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις μετὰ τὴν θλῖψιν ἐκείνην .) The fact of His coming and its attendant circumstances being known to Him, but the exact time unknown, He speaks  without regard to the interval , which would be employed in His waiting till all things are put under His feet: see Revelation 1:1 ; Revelation 22:6-20 .
	In what follows,  from this verse , the Lord speaks mainly and directly of  His great second coming . Traces there are (as e.g. in the literal meaning of Mat 24:34 ) of slight and indirect allusions to the destruction of Jerusalem; as there were in the former part to the great events of which that is a foreshadowing: but no direct mention. The contents of the rest of the chapter may be set forth as follows: ( Mat 24:29 )  signs which shall immediately precede ( Mat 24:30 )  the coming of the Lord to judgment, and ( Mat 24:31 )  to bring salvation to His elect. The certainty of the event, and its intimate connexion with its premonitory signs ( Mat 24:32-33 );  the endurance ( Mat 24:34 )  of the Jewish people till the end even till Heaven and Earth ( Mat 24:35 )  pass away. But ( Mat 24:36 )  of the day and hour none knoweth. Its suddenness ( Mat 24:37-39 )  and decisiveness ( Mat 24:40-41 ),  and exhortation ( Mat 24:42-44 )  to be ready for it. A parable setting forth the blessedness of the watching, and misery of the neglectful servant ( Mat 24:45 end), and forming a point of transition to the parables in the next chapter.
	 ὁ ἥλιος σκοτ  . ] The darkening of the material lights of this world is used in prophecy as a type of the occurrence of trouble and danger in the fabric of human societies, Isaiah 5:30 ; Isaiah 13:10 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; Jeremiah 4:28 ; Ezekiel 32:7-8 ; Amos 8:9-10 ; Micah 3:6 . But the type is not only in the  words of the prophecy, but also in the events themselves. Such prophecies are to be understood  literally , and indeed without such understanding would lose their truth and significance. The physical signs shall happen (see Joel 2:31 ; Haggai 2:6 ; Haggai 2:21 , compared with Heb 12:26-27 ) as accompaniments and intensifications of the awful state of things which the description typifies. The  Sun of this world and the church (Malachi 4:2 ; Luke 1:78 ; John 1:9 ; Ephesians 5:14 ; 2Pe 1:19 ) is the Lord Jesus the Light is the Knowledge of Him. The moon human knowledge and science, of which it is said ( Psa 36:9 ), ‘In thy light shall we see light:’ reflected from, and drinking the beams of, the Light of Christ. The stars see Dan 8:10 are the leaders and teachers of the Church. The Knowledge of God shall be obscured the Truth nigh put out worldly wisdom darkened the Church system demolished, and her teachers cast down. And all this in the midst of the fearful signs here (and in Luke 21:25-26 , more at large) recounted: not  setting aside , but  accompanying , their  literal fulfilment .

Typically, the influences which rule human society, which make the political weather fair or foul, bright or dark; and encourage the fruits of peace, or inflict the blight and desolation of war.
