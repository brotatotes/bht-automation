 29. Immediately] All the difficulty which this word has been supposed to involve has arisen from confounding the<i> partial</i> fulfilment of the prophecy with its<i> ultimate</i> one. The important insertion in Luke (xxi. 23, 24) shews us that the<i> tribulation</i> includes<i> wrath upon this people</i>, which is yet being inflicted: and the treading down of Jerusalem by the Gentiles, still going on (see note there): and immediately after that tribulation which shall happen<i> when the cup of Gentile iniquity is Sull, and when the Gospel shall have been preached in all the world</i> for a witness,<i> and rejected by the Gentiles,</i> (in Luke, “<i>the</i><i> times of the Gentiles be fulfilled</i>,”) shall the coming of the Lord Himself happen. On the indefiniteness of this assigned period in the prophecy, see note on ver. 3. (The expression in Mark is equally indicative of a considerable interval: “In those days,<i> after that tribulation</i>.”) The fact of His coming, and its attendant circumstances, being known to Him, but the-exact time unknown,—He speaks<i> without regard to the interval</i>, which would be employed in His waiting till all things are put under His feet: see Rev. i. 1; xxii. 6–20. In what follows,<i> from this verse</i>, the Lord speaks mainly and directly of<i> His great second coming.</i> Traces there are (as e.g. in the literal meaning of ver. 84) of slight and indirect allusions to the destruction of Jerusalem;—as there were in the former part to the great events of which that is a foreshadowing:—but no direct mention. The contents of the rest of the chapter may be set forth as follows: (ver. 29)<i> signs which shall immediately precede</i> (ver. 30)<i> the coming of the Lord to judgment, and</i> (ver. 31)<i> to bring salvation to His elect. The certainty of the event, and its intimate connexion with its premonitory signs</i> (vv. 32, 33)<i>; the enduracne (ver. 84) of the Jewish people till the end—even till Heaven and Earth (ver. 35) pass away. But (ver. 36) of the day and hour none knoweth. Its suddenness (vv. 37–39) and decisiveness (vv. 40, 41),—and exhortation (vv. 42–44) to be ready for it. A parable setting forth the blessedness of the watching, and misery of the neglectful servant</i> (vv. 45—end), and forming a point of transition to the parables in the next chapter.<br><br><b> shall the sun be darkened]</b> The darkening of the material lights of this world is in prophecy as a type of the occurrence of trouble and danger in the fabric of human societies, Isa. v. 30; xiii. 10; xxxiv. 4: Jer. iv. 28: Ezek. xxxii. 7, 8: Amos viii. 9, 10: Micah iii. 6. But the type is not only in the words of the proxy, but also in the events themselves, Such prophecies are to be understood<i> literally</i>, and indeed without such understanding would lose their truth and significance. The physical signs shall happen (see Joel ii. 31: Hagg. ii. 6, 21, compared with Heb. xii. 26, 27) as accompaniments and intensifications of the awful state of things which the description typifies. The<i> Sun</i> of this world and the church (Mal. iv. 2: Luke i. 78: John i. 9: Eph. v. 14: 2 Pet. i. 19) is the Lord Jesus—the<i> Light</i>, is the Knowledge of Him. The<i> moon</i>—human knowledge and science, of which it is said (Ps. xxxvi. 9), ‘In thy light shall we see light:’ reflected from, and drinking the beams of, the Light of Christ. The<i> stars</i>—see Dan. viii. 10—are the leaders and teachers of the Church. The Knowledge of God shall be obscured—the Truth nigh put out—worldly wisdom darkened—the Church system demolished, and her teachers cast down. And all this in the midst of the fearful signs here (and in Luke, vv. 25, 26, more at large) recounted: not<i> setting aside, but accompanying, their literal fulfilment,</i><br><br><b> the powers of the heavens]</b> not the stars, just mentioned;—nor<i> the angels</i>, spoken of by and by, ver. 31: but most probably the greater heavenly bodies, which rule the day and night, Gen. i. 16, and are there also distinguished from the stars. See notes on 2 Pet. iii. 10–12, where the stars seem to be<i> included in the elements.</i> Typically, the influences which rule human society, which make the political weather fair or foul, bright or dark; and encourage the fruits of peace, or inflict the blight and desolation of war.
