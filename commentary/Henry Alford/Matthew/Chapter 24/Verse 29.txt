 29. Immediately] All the difficulty which this word has been supposed to involve has arisen from confounding the<i> partial</i> fulfilment of the prophecy with its<i> ultimate</i> one. The important insertion in Luke (xxi. 23, 24) shews us that the<i> tribulation</i> includes<i> wrath upon this people</i>, which is yet being inflicted: and the treading down of Jerusalem by the Gentiles, still going on (see note there): and immediately after that tribulation which shall happen<i> when the cup of Gentile iniquity is Sull, and when the Gospel shall have been preached in all the world</i> for a witness,<i> and rejected by the Gentiles,</i> (in Luke, “<i>the</i><i> times of the Gentiles be fulfilled</i>,”) shall the coming of the Lord Himself happen. On the indefiniteness of this assigned period in the prophecy, see note on ver. 3. (The expression in Mark is equally indicative of a considerable interval: “In those days,<i> after that tribulation</i>.”) The fact of His coming, and its attendant circumstances, being known to Him, but the-exact time unknown,—He speaks<i> without regard to the interval</i>, which would be employed in His waiting till all things are put under His feet: see Rev. i. 1; xxii. 6–20. In what follows,<i> from this verse</i>, the Lord speaks mainly and directly of<i> His great second coming.</i> Traces there are (as e.g. in the literal meaning of ver. 84) of slight and indirect allusions to the destruction of Jerusalem;—as there were in the former part to the great events of which that is a foreshadowing:—but no direct mention. The contents of the rest of the chapter may be set forth as follows: (ver. 29)<i> signs which shall immediately precede</i> (ver. 30)<i> the coming of the Lord to judgment, and</i> (ver. 31)<i> to bring salvation to His elect. The certainty of the event, and its intimate connexion with its premonitory signs</i> (vv. 32, 33)<i>; the enduracne (ver. 84) of the Jewish people till the end—even till Heaven and Earth (ver. 35) pass away. But (ver. 36) of the day and hour none knoweth. Its suddenness (vv. 37–39) and decisiveness (vv. 40, 41),—and exhortation (vv. 42–44) to be ready for it. A parable setting forth the blessedness of the watching, and misery of the neglectful servant</i> (vv. 45—end), and forming a point of transition to the parables in the next chapter.
