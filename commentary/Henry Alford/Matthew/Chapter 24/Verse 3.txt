 3.] From Mark we learn that it was Peter and James and John and Andrew who asked this question. With regard to the question itself, we must, I think, be careful not to press the clauses of it too much, so as to make them bear separate meanings corresponding to the arrangements of our Lord's discourse. As expressed in the other Evangelists, the question was concerning the time, and the sign, of<i> these things</i> happening, viz. the overthrow of the temple and desolation of Judæa, with which, in the then idea of the Apostles, our Lord’s coming and the end of the world were connected. Against this mistake He warns them, vv. 6, 14,—Luke ver. 24,—and also in the two first parables in our ch. xxv. For the understanding of this necessarily difficult prophetic discourse, it must be borne in mind that the whole is spoken in the pregnant language of prophecy, in which various fulfillments are involved.
