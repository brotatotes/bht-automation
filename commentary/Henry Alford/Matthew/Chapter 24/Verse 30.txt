 30.] This then, so emphtically placed and repeated, is a<i> definite declaration of time</i>,—not a mere sign of sequence or coincidence, as e.g. in ver. 23:—when these things shall have been somewhile filling men’s hearts with fear,—THEN shall&c. It is quite uncertain what the sign shall be:—plainly, not<i> the Son of Man Himself,</i> as some explain it (even Bengel, generally so valuable in his explanations, says, “<i>He Himself shall be the sign of Himself</i>,” and quotes Luke ii. 12 as confirming this view; but there the swaddling clothes and the manger were the ‘sign,’ not the Child), nor any<i> outward marks on His body</i>, as His wounds; for both these would confuse what the prophecy keeps distinct—the seeing of the<i> sign</i> of the Son of Man, and all tribes of the earth mourning, and afterwards seeing the<i> Son of Man Himself</i>. This is manifestly s<i> ome sign in the Heavens,</i> by which all shall know that the Son of Man is at hand. The<i> Star of the Wise Men</i> naturally occurs to our thoughts—but a star would not be a sign which all might read.
