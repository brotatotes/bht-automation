<b> 30.</b>] This then, so emphtically placed and repeated, is a<i> definite declaration of time</i>,—not a mere sign of sequence or coincidence, as e.g. in ver. 23:—when these things shall have been somewhile filling men’s hearts with fear,—THEN shall&c. It is quite uncertain what the sign shall be:—plainly, not<i> the Son of Man Himself,</i> as some explain it (even Bengel, generally so valuable in his explanations, says, “<i>He Himself shall be the sign of Himself</i>,” and quotes Luke ii. 12 as confirming this view; but there the swaddling clothes and the manger were the ‘sign,’ not the Child), nor any<i> outward marks on His body</i>, as His wounds; for both these would confuse what the prophecy keeps distinct—the seeing of the<i> sign</i> of the Son of Man, and all tribes of the earth mourning, and afterwards seeing the<i> Son of Man Himself</i>. This is manifestly s<i> ome sign in the Heavens,</i> by which all shall know that the Son of Man is at hand. The<i> Star of the Wise Men</i> naturally occurs to our thoughts—but a star would not be a sign which all might read.<br><br> On the whole I think no sign completely answers the conditions, but that<i> of the Cross</i>:—and accordingly we find the Fathers mostly thus ‘ing the passage. But as our Lord Himself does not answer the question, “<i>What is the sign of thine appearing</i>?” we may safely leave the matter.<br><br><b> all the tribes of the earth]</b> See Zech. xii. 10–14, where the mourning is confined to the families of Israel:—here, it is universal: see Rev. i. 7; also vi. 15–17. This coming of the Son of Man is not that spoken of ch. xxv. 31, but that in 1 Thess. iv. 16, 17, and Rev. xix. 11 ff.,—<i>His coming at the commencement of the millennial reign to establish His Kingdom:</i> see Dan. vii. 13, 14.<br><br> The power is the<i> power of the Kingdom</i>, not, the host heaven.
