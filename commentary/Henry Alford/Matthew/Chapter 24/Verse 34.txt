As regards the parable,—there is a reference to the<i> withered fig-tree which the Lord cursed</i>: and as that, in its judicial unfruitfulness, emblematized the Jewish people, so here the putting forth of the fig-tree from its state of winter dryness, symbolizes the<i> future reviviscence</i> of that race, which the Lord (ver. 34) declares shall not<b> pass away</b> till all fulfilled. That this is the true meaning of that verse, must appear, when we recollect that it forms the conclusion of this parable, and is itself joined, by<i> this generation</i><b> passing away,</b> to the verse following. We cannot, in seeking for its ultimate fulfilment,<i> go back</i> to the taking of Jerusalem and make the words apply to it.<br><br> As this is one of the points on which the rationalizing interpreters lay most stress to shew that the prophecy has<i> failed</i>, I have taken pains to shew, in my Gr. Test., that the word here rendered<b> generation</b> has the meaning of<i> a race or family of people.</i> In all the there cited, the word necessarily that signification: having it is true a more pregnant meaning, implying that the character of one generation<i> stamps</i><i> itself upon the race</i>, as here in this verse also. The continued use of<b> pass away</b> (the word is the same in verses 34, 35) should have saved the Commentators from the blunder of imagining that the then living generation was meant, seeing that the prophecy is by the next verse carried on to the end of all things: and that, as matter of fact, the Apostles and ancient Christians<i> did continue to expect the Lord’s coming, after that generation had passed away</i>. But, as Stier well remarks, “there are men foolish enough now to say, heaven and earth will never pass away, but the words of Christ pass away in course of time—; of this, however, we wait the proof.” ii. 505.<br><br><b> all these things</b>—<i>all</i> the signs hitherto recounted—so that both these words,<b> and ye</b> (in ver. 33), have their partial, and their<i> full</i> meanings.<br><br><b> it is near</b>—viz.<b> the end.</b> On ver. 35 see Ps. cxix. 89: Isa. xl. 8; li. 6: Ps. cii. 26,
