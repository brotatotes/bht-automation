 36.]<b> that day,</b> viz. of heaven and earth away; or, perhaps referring to ver 30 ff.<b> day and hour</b>—and how the exact time—<b>as we say</b>, ‘the hour and minute.’ The very im nt addition to this verse in Mark, and in some ancient MSS. here,<b> neither the Son,</b> is indeed included in “<i>but my Father only</i>,” but could hardly have been inferred from it, had it not been expressly stated: ch, xx. 23. All attempts to soften or explain away this weighty truth must be resisted: it will not do to say with some Commentators, “He knows it not<i> as regards us</i>,” which, however well meant, is a mere evasion:—in the course of humiliation undertaken by the Son, in which He increased in wisdom (Luke ii. 52), learned obedience (Heb. v. 8), uttered desires in prayer (Luke vi. 12, &c.),—<i>this matter was hidden from Him:</i> and as I have already remarked, this is carefully to be borne in mind, in explaining the prophecy before us.
