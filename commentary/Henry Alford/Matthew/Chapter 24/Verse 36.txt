 36. ]  ἡμ  .   ἐκ  ., viz. of heaven and earth passing away; or, perhaps referring to Matthew 24:30 ff.
	 ἡμ  .   κ  .   ὥρ  ., the exact time as we say, ‘the hour and minute.’ The very important addition to this verse in Mark, and in some ancient MSS. here (but see digest),  οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός  , is indeed included in εἰ μὴ ὁ πατήρ [ μου ] μόνος , but could hardly have been inferred from it, had it not been expressly stated: ch. Matthew 20:23 . All attempts to soften or explain away this weighty truth must be resisted; it will not do to say with some Commentators, ‘nescit ea  nobis ,’ which, however well meant, is a mere evasion: in the course of humiliation undertaken by the Son, in which He increased in wisdom ( Luk 2:52 ), learned obedience ( Heb 5:8 ), uttered desires in prayer (Luke 6:12 , &c.),  this matter was hidden from Him : and as I have already remarked, this is carefully to be borne in mind, in explaining the prophecy before us.
