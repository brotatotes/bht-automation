 36.]<b> that day,</b> viz. of heaven and earth away; or, perhaps referring to ver 30 ff.<b> day and hour</b>—and how the exact time—<b>as we say</b>, ‘the hour and minute.’ The very im nt addition to this verse in Mark, and in some ancient MSS. here,<b> neither the Son,</b> is indeed included in “<i>but my Father only</i>,” but could hardly have been inferred from it, had it not been expressly stated: ch, xx. 23. All attempts to soften or explain away this weighty truth must be resisted: it will not do to say with some Commentators, “He knows it not<i> as regards us</i>,” which, however well meant, is a mere evasion:—in the course of humiliation undertaken by the Son, in which He increased in wisdom (Luke ii. 52), learned obedience (Heb. v. 8), uttered desires in prayer (Luke vi. 12, &c.),—<i>this matter was hidden from Him:</i> and as I have already remarked, this is carefully to be borne in mind, in explaining the prophecy before us.<br><br> The expression ing may serve to shew that it is a mistake to imagine that we have in Gen. ix. 20 the account of the first wine and its effects. The security here spoken of is in no wise inconsistent with the anguish and fear prophesied, Luke xxi. 25, 26. They<i> say</i>, there is peace, and occupy themselves as if there were: but fear is at their hearts. On the addition in Luke xxi. 34–36, see notes there.<br><br> These verses set forth that, as in the times of Noah, men and women shall be employed in their ordinary work: see Exod. xi. 5: Isa, xlvii. 2. They also shew us that the elect of God will<i> to the last be mingled in companionship and partnership with the children of this world</i> (see Mark i. 19, 20). We may notice, that these verses do not refer to the same as vv. 16–18. Then it is a question of<i> voluntary flight</i>;<i> now of being taken</i> (by the angels, ver. 81: the ‘<i>present tense</i> graphically sets the incident before us; or perhaps describes the rule of proceeding. It is interesting to know that the word “<i>taken</i>” is the same verb in the original as “<i>receive</i>” in John xiv. 3)<i> or left.</i> Nor again do they refer to the great judgment of ch. xxv. 31, for then (ver. 32)<i> all</i> shall be summoned: but they refer to the millennial dispensation, and the gathering of the elect to the Lord<i> then</i>. The “women grinding at the mill” has been abundantly illustrated by travellers, as even now seen in the<b> East</b>. See especially The Land and the Book, pp. 526, 7.<br><br><b> Who then is]</b> A question asked<i> that each one may put it to himself</i>,—and to signify the high honour of such an one.<br><br><b> faithful and wise]</b> Prudence in a servant can be only the consequence of<i> faithfulness to his master</i>. This verse is especially addressed to the Apostles and Ministers of Christ. The give them (their)<b> meat</b> ( =<i> portion of meat</i>, Luke xii. 42) answers to the description of the<i> workman that need not be ashamed</i> in 2 Tim. ii. 16. On ver. 47, compare ch, xxv. 21: 1 Tim. iii. 13: Rev. iii. 21; which last two passages answer to the promise here, that<i> each</i> faithful servant shall be over<i> all</i> his master’s goods. That promotion shall not be like earthly promotion, wherein the eminence of one excludes that of another,—but rather like the diffusion of love, in which, the more each has, the more there is for all.<br><br><b> delayeth]</b> then manifestly,<i> a long delay is in the mind of the Lord</i>: see above on ver. 29.<i> Notice that this servant also is one set over the houschold—one who says my lord</i>—and began well—but now begins to, &c.—falls away from his truth and faithfulness;—the sign of which is that he begins (lit. shall have begun) to<i> lord it over the elect</i> (1 Pet. v. 3), and to revel with the children of the world. In consequence, though he have not lost his<i> belief</i> ( “my<i> lord</i>”), he shall be placed those who believed not, the hypocrites
