Our Lord had given this parabolic exhortation before, Luke xii. 42–46. Many of these His last sayings in public are solemn repetitions of, and references to, things already said by Him. That this was the case in the present instance, is almost demonstrable, from the implicit allusion in Luke xii. 36, to the<i> return from the wedding</i>, which is here expanded into the parable of ch. xxv. 1 ff. How much more natural that our Lord should have preserved in his parabolic discourses the same leading ideas, and again and again gathered his precepts round them,—than that the Evangelists should have thrown into utter and inconsistent confusion, words which would have been treasured up so carefully by them that heard them;—to say nothing of the promised help of the Spirit to bring to mind all that He had said to them.<br><br><b> Who then is]</b> A question asked<i> that each one may put it to himself</i>,—and to signify the high honour of such an one.<br><br><b> faithful and wise]</b> Prudence in a servant can be only the consequence of<i> faithfulness to his master</i>. This verse is especially addressed to the Apostles and Ministers of Christ. The give them (their)<b> meat</b> ( =<i> portion of meat</i>, Luke xii. 42) answers to the description of the<i> workman that need not be ashamed</i> in 2 Tim. ii. 16. On ver. 47, compare ch, xxv. 21: 1 Tim. iii. 13: Rev. iii. 21; which last two passages answer to the promise here, that<i> each</i> faithful servant shall be over<i> all</i> his master’s goods. That promotion shall not be like earthly promotion, wherein the eminence of one excludes that of another,—but rather like the diffusion of love, in which, the more each has, the more there is for all.
