<b>wars and rumors of wars</b> there certainly were during this period; but the prophecy must be interpreted rather of those of which the<i> Hebrew Christians would be most likely to hear</i> as a cause of terror. Such undoubtedly were the<i> three threats of war against the Jews</i> by Caligula, Claudius, and Nero; of the first of which Josephus says, “that it would have brought extermination to the Jewish nation, had it not been for Caligula’s death.” Luke couples with wars “<i>commotions</i>,”—and to this<b> nation against nation</b> seems also to point.
