There were serious disturbances,— (1) at Alexandria, which gave rise to the complaint against and deposition of Flaccus, and Philo’s work against him (A. D. 38), in which the Jews as a nation were the especial objects of persecution; (2) at Seleucia about the same time, in which more than 50, 000 Jews were killed; (3) at Jamnia, a city on the coast of Judæa near Joppa. Many other such national tumults are recorded by Josephus. In one place he calls the sedition<i> a preface be the siege.</i><b> famine</b>, and<i> pestilence</i>, which is coupled to it in Luke, are usual companions. With regard to the<i> first</i>, Greswell shews that the famine prophesied of in the Acts (xi. 28) happened in the ninth of Claudius, A.D. 49. It was great at Rome,—and therefore probably Egypt and Africa, on which the Romans depended so much for supplies, were themselves much affected by it. Suetonius of<i> continual droughts</i>; and Tacitus of<i> dearth of crops, and thence famine</i>, about the same time. There was a famine in Judæa in the reign of Claudius (the true date of which however Mr. Greswell believes to be the third of Nero), mentioned by Josephus. And as to<i> pestilences</i>, though their occurrence might, as above, be inferred from the other, we have distinct accounts of a pestilence at Rome (A. D. 65) in Suetonius and Tacitus, which in a single autumn carried. off 30, 000 persons at Rome. But sach matters as these are not often related by historians, unless of more than usual severity.<br><br><b> earthquakes</b>] The principal<i> earthquakes</i> occurring between this prophecy and the destruction of Jerusalem were, (1) a great earthquake’ in Crete, A.D. 46 or 47; (2) one at Rome on the day when Nero assumed the manly toga A.D. 51; (8) one at Apamea in Phrygia, mentioned by Tacitus, A.D. 53; (4) one at Laodicea in Phrygia, A.D. 60; (5) one in Campania. Seneca, in the year ‘A. D. 58, writes:— ‘How often have cities of Asia and Achaea fallen with one fatal shock!how many cities have been swallowed up in Syria, how many in Macedonia!How often has Cyprus been wasted by this calamity!How often has Paphos become a ruin!News has often been brought us of the demolition of whole cities at once.”<br><br> The prophecy, mentioning in<i> divers</i><b> places</b> (<b>place for place</b>,—i. e. here and there, each in its particular locality; as we say, “up and down”), does not seem to imply that the earthquakes should be in Judaea or Jerusalem. We have an account of one in Jerusalem, in Josephus, which Mr. Greswell (as above) places about Nov. A.D. 67. On the additions in Luke xxi. 11, see notes there and on this whole passage see the prophecies in 2 Chron. xv. 5–7, and Jer. li. 45, 46.
