<b>Then, at this time,—during this period</b>, not ‘after these things have happened.” These words serve only definitely to fix the time of the indefinite<i> then</i>, here and in ver. 10. The<i> then</i> in ver. 14 is, from the construction of the sentence, more definite. For kill you, Luke has<i> some of you shall they cause to be put to death</i>, viz. the Apostles. This ign was early given. James the brother of John was put to death, A.D. 44. P<i> eter and Paul</i> (traditionally) and J<i> ames the Lord’s brother</i>, before the destruction of Jerusalem: and possibly others.<br><br><b> ye shall be hated]</b> See Acts xxviii. 22. Tacitus says that Nero, for the conflagration of Rome, persecuted the Christians, ‘<i>a race of men detested for their crimes</i>;’ also see 1 Pet. ii, 12; iii, 16; iv. 14–16. In chap. x. 22, from which these verses are repeated, we have only “<i>of all</i>” (men)—here<b> nations</b> is added, giving particularity to the prophecy.
