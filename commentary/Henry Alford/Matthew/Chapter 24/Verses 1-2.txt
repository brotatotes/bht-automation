 1, 2. ] St. Mark expresses their remarks on the buildings; see note there: they were probably occasioned by Mat 24:38 of the last chapter. Josephus writes, B. J. vii. 1. 1, κελεύει Καῖσαρ ἤδη τήν τε πόλιν ἅπασαν καὶ τὸν νεὼν κατασκάπτειν .… τὸν δ ʼ ἄλλον ἅπαντα τῆς πόλεως περίβολον οὕτως ἐξωμάλισαν οἱ κατασκαπτοντες , ὡς μηδὲ πώποτ ʼ οἰκισθῆναι πίστιν ἂν ἔτι παρασχεῖν τοῖς προσελθοῦσιν . There is no difficulty in οὐ here used interrogatively. See a similar case John 6:70 . Meyer has abandoned his former view that we should read οὗ , “where ye see, &c.,” and takes the common interpretation. He notices some curious renderings in his note: “Do not look (so wonderingly) on.… ( μὴ βλ .),” Paulus; “Do ye not wonder at …?” Chrys. a [163] ., and De W.: “Ye see not  all this …” viz. not the desolation that shall come. Grulich, de loci Matthew 24:1-2 , interp. Torg. 1839: “Ye do not see: all this, I say to you, shall not.…” Bornemann.
