<p><strong> 16 18.</strong> ] The Christian Jews are said (Euseb. H. E. iii. 5) to have fled to <em> Pella</em> , a town described by Josephus (B. J. iii. 3. 3) as the northernmost boundary of Peræa. Eusebius says they were directed thither by a certain prophetic intimation ( τινὰ χρησμόν ), which however cannot be <em> this</em> ; as Pella is not <em> on the mountains</em> , but beyond them (but in order to reach it would not they have to fly exactly <strong> ἐπὶ</strong> τὰ ὄρη over, along, across them? See note on ch. Mat 18:12 ): Epiphanius (de mensuris et pond. § 15, vol. ii. p. 171) that they προεχρηματίσθησαν ὑπὸ ἀγγέλου .</p>
