 1.]<i> Then—at the period spoken of at the end of the last chapter</i>, viz. the coming of the Lord to His personal reign—not His final coming to judgment.<br><br><b> ten virgins]</b> The subject of this parable is not, as of the last, the distinction between the faithful and unfaithful<b> servants</b>; no<i> outward</i> distinction here exists—all are virgins—all companions of the bride—all furnished with brightly-burning lamps—all, up to a certain time, fully ready to meet the Bridgegroom—the difference consists in<i> some having made a provision</i> for feeding the lamps in case of delay, and<i> the others none</i>—and the moral of the parable<i> is the blessedness of endurance unto the end.</i> “The point of the parable consists,” as Calvin remarks, in this, “that it is not enough to have been<i> once</i> girt and prepared for duty, unless we endure even to the end,” There is no question here of apostasy, or unfaithfulness—but of the<i> want of provision</i> to keep the light bright against the coming of the bridegroom, however delayed.<br><br><i> Ten</i> was a favourite number with the Jews—ten men formed a congregation in a synagogue. In a passage from Rabbi Salomo, cited by Wetsteine he mentions ten lamps or torches as the usual number in marriage processions: see also Luke xix. 13.<br><br><b> to meet the bridegroom]</b> It would appear that these virgins had left their own homes, and were waiting somewhere for the bridegroom to come,—probably at the house of the bride; for the object of the marriage procession was to<i> fetch the bride to the bridegroom's house.</i> Meyer however supposes that in this case the wedding was to be<i> held</i> in the bride’s house, on account of the thing signified—the coming of the Lord to His Church;—but it is better to take the ordinary custom, and interpret accordingly, where we can. In both the wedding parables (see ch. xxii.) the<i> bride</i> does not appear for she, being the Church, is in fact the aggregate of the guests in the one case, and of the companions in the other. We may perhaps say that she is here, in the strict interpretation, the Jewish Church, and these ten virgins Gentile congregations accompanying her. This<b> went forth</b> is<i> not their final going out</i> in ver. 6, for only half of them did so,—but<i> their leaving their own homes:</i> compare<b> took</b>, in vv. 3, 4 The interpretation is—these are souls come out from the world into the Church, and there waiting for the coming of the Lord—not hypocrites, but<i> faithful souls, bearing their lamps</i> (<b>their own lamps;</b> so, literally: compare 1 Thess. iv. 4)—the inner spiritual life fed with the oil of God’s Spirit (see Zech. iv. 2–12: Acts x. 38: Heb. i. 9). All views of this parable which represent the foolish virgins as having only a<i> dead faith</i>, only the lamp without the light, the body without the spirit, &c., are<i> quite beside the purpose;</i>—the lamps (see ver. 8) were<i> all burning</i> at first, and for a certain time.<br><br> Whether the<i> equal partition</i> of wise and foolish have any deep meaning we cannot say; it<i> may</i> be so.
