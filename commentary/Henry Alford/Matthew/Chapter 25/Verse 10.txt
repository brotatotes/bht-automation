</b>We are<i> not told that they could not buy</i>—that the shops were shut—but simply that it was<i> too late</i>—<i>for that time</i>. For it is<i> not the final coming of the Lord to judgment, when the day of grace will be past</i>, that is spoken of,—except in so far as it is hinted at in the background, and in the individual application of the parable (virtually, not actually) coincides, to each man, with the day of his death.<i> This feast is the marriage supper</i> of Rev. xix. 7–9 (see also ib. xxi. 2);<i> after which</i> these improvident ones gone to buy their oil shall be<i> judged in common with the rest of the dead</i>, ibid. xx. 12, 13.
