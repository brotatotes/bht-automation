<b> 14.]</b> The ellipsis is rightly supplied in the A.V.,<b> For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man</b>, &c. We have this parable and the preceding one alluded to in very few words by Mark xiii. 34–36. In it we have the active side of the Christian life, and its danger, set before us, as in the last the contemplative side. There, the foolish virgins failed,<i> from thinking their part too easy</i>—here the wicked servant fails,<i> from</i><i> thinking his too hard</i>. The parable is still concerned with<i> Christians</i> (his own servants), and<i> not the world at large</i>. We must remember the relation of master and slave, in order to understand his delivering to them his property, and punishing them for not fructifying with it.
