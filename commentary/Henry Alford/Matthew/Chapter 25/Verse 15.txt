<b> 15.]</b> In Luke each<i> receives the same</i>, but the<i> profit made by each is different</i>: see notes there. Here, in fact, they<i> did each receive the same</i>, for they received<i> according to their ability</i>—their character and powers. There is no Pelagianism in this, for each man’s powers are themselves the gift of God.
