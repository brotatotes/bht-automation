<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] In Luke ═ ὅτι ἐν ἐλαχίστῳ πιστὸς ἐγένου , ἴσθι ἐξουσίαν ἔχων ἐπάνω δέκα πόλεων where see note. (I cannot imagine with Meyer that εὖ is to be taken with ἐπὶ ὀλίγα ἦς π ., or that it will not bear the sense of ‘Well done!’ Although εὖγε is the more usual word, we have (see Passow) in later Greek such expressions as μαλ ʼ εὖ , which is as near as possible to that meaning.)

<p>The <strong> χαρά</strong> here is not a <em> feast</em> , as sometimes interpreted, but that <strong> joy</strong> spoken of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span> , and Isa 53:11 that joy of the Lord arising from the completion of his work and labour of love, of which the first Sabbatical rest of the Creator was typical <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:31">Genesis 1:31</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:2">Genesis 2:2</span> , and of which his faithful ones shall in the end partake: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:3-11">Hebrews 4:3-11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span> .

<p>Notice the identity of the praise and portion of him who had been faithful in less, with those of the <em> first</em> . The words are, as has been well observed, “not, ‘good and successful servant,’ but ‘good and faithful servant:’ ” and faithfulness does not depend on <em> amount</em> .</p>
