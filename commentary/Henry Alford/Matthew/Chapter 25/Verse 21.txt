The joy here is not a<i> feast</i>, as sometimes interpreted, but that joy spoken of Heb. xii. 2, and Isa. liii. 11—that joy of the Lord arising from the completion of His work and labour of love, of which the first Sabbatical rest of the Creator was typical— Gen. i. 31; ii. 2,—and of which His faithful ones shall in the end<b> partake:</b> see Heb. iv. 3–11: Rev. iii. 21.<br><br> Notice the identity of the praise and portion him who a been faithful in less, with those of the<i> first</i>. The words are, as has been well observed, “not, ‘good and successful servant,’ but ‘good and faithful servant:’” and faithfulness does not depend on<i> amount</i>.
