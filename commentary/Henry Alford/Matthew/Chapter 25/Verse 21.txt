<b> 21.]</b> See the corresponding sentence in Luke xix. 17, and note. The joy here is not a<i> feast</i>, as sometimes interpreted, but that joy spoken of Heb. xii. 2, and Isa. liii. 11—that joy of the Lord arising from the completion of His work and labour of love, of which the first Sabbatical rest of the Creator was typical— Gen. i. 31; ii. 2,—and of which His faithful ones shall in the end<b> partake:</b> see Heb. iv. 3–11: Rev. iii. 21.<br><br> Notice the identity of the praise and portion him who a been faithful in less, with those of the<i> first</i>. The words are, as has been well observed, “not, ‘good and successful servant,’ but ‘good and faithful servant:’” and faithfulness does not depend on<i> amount</i>.<br><br><b> reaping where thou hast not sown]</b> The connexion of thought in this our Lord’s<i> last</i> parable, with His<i> first</i> (ch. xiii. 3–9), is remarkable. He looks for fruit where He has sown—<i>this is truth</i>: but not beyond the power of the soil by Him enabled—<i>this is man’s lie</i>, to encourage himself in idleness.<br><br><b> I was afraid]</b> See Gen. iii. 10. But that pretended fear, and this insolent speech, are<i> inconsistent</i>, and betray the falsehood of his answer.<br><br><b> thou hast that is thine]</b> This is also false—it was not so—for there was<i> his lord’s time</i>,—and<i> his own labour, which was his lord’s</i>—<i>to be accounted for.</i><br><br><b> thou knewost, &c.</b> is not concessive, but hypothetical;—God is<i> not really</i> such a Master.<br><br><b> the exchangers</b>, in Luke (xix. 23) “<i>the bank</i>” (exchange).<br><br> There was a saying very current among the early Fathers, “<i>Be ye worthy exchangers,</i>” which some of them seem to attribute to the Lord, some to one of the Apostles. It is supposed by some to be taken from this place, and it is just possible it may have been: but it more likely was traditional, or from some apocryphal gospel. Suicer discusses the question, and inclines to think that it was a way of expressing the general moral of the two parables in Matt. and Luke.<br><br> But, in the<i> interpretation</i>, who are these<b> exchangers?</b> The explanation (Olsh., and adopted by Trench, Parables, p. 247) of their being those<i> stronger characters</i> who may lead the more timid to the useful employments of gifts which they have not energy to use, is objectionable (1) as not answering to the<i> character addressed</i>—he was not timid, but false and slothful:—and (2) nor to the<i> facts of the case:</i> for it is impossible to employ the grace given to one through<i> another's</i> means, without working one’s self.<br><br> I rather take it to mean, ‘If thou hadst really been afraid, &c., slothful as thou art, thou mightest at least, without trouble to thyself, have provided that I should have not been defrauded of the interest of my money—but now thou art both slothful and wicked, in having done me this injustice.’ Observe there would have been no praise due to the servant—but “<i>that which is mine</i>” would not have lost its<i> increase</i>. The<i> machinery of religious and charitable societies in our day</i> is very much in the place of the<i> exchangers</i>. Let the subscribers to them take heed that they be not in the degraded case of this servant, even if his excuse had been genuine.<br><br> Compare, for the better understanding of the distinction and connexion of these ‘two comings’ of the Lord, 1 Thess. iv. 16, 17, and 2 Thess. i. 7–10.<br><br> This description is not a parable, though there are in it parabolic passages, eg.<b> as a shepherd&c.</b>: and for that very reason, that which is illustrated by those likenesses is<i> not itself parabolic</i>. It will heighten our estimation of the wonderful sublimity of this description, when we recollect that it was spoken by the Lord<i> only three days before his sufferings</i>.
