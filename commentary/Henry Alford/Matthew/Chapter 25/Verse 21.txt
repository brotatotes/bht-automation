 21. ] In Luke ═ ὅτι ἐν ἐλαχίστῳ πιστὸς ἐγένου , ἴσθι ἐξουσίαν ἔχων ἐπάνω δέκα πόλεων where see note. (I cannot imagine with Meyer that εὖ is to be taken with ἐπὶ ὀλίγα ἦς π ., or that it will not bear the sense of ‘Well done!’ Although εὖγε is the more usual word, we have (see Passow) in later Greek such expressions as μαλ ʼ εὖ , which is as near as possible to that meaning.)
	The  χαρά here is not a  feast , as sometimes interpreted, but that  joy spoken of Hebrews 12:2 , and Isa 53:11 that joy of the Lord arising from the completion of his work and labour of love, of which the first Sabbatical rest of the Creator was typical Genesis 1:31 ; Genesis 2:2 , and of which his faithful ones shall in the end partake: see Hebrews 4:3-11 ; Revelation 3:21 .
	Notice the identity of the praise and portion of him who had been faithful in less, with those of the  first . The words are, as has been well observed, “not, ‘good and successful servant,’ but ‘good and faithful servant:’ ” and faithfulness does not depend on  amount .
