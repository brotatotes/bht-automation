</b>St. Luke prefixes “<i>out of thine own mouth will I judge thee</i>,”—viz. ‘because, knowing the relation between us, that of absolute power on my part over thee,—if thou hadst really thought me such an hard master,<b> thou oughtest&c.</b>, in order to avoid utter ruin. But this was<i> not</i> thy real thought—thou wert<b> wicked and slothful</b>.’<br><br><b> thou knewest, &c.</b> is not concessive, but hypothetical;—God is<i> not really</i> such a Master.
