<b> 31. in his glory]</b> This expression, repeated again at the end of the verse, is quite distinct from<i> with power and great glory</i> ch. xxiv. 30: see Rev. xx. 11. This<i> His glory</i> is that also of all his saints, with whom He shall be accompanied: see Jude ver. 14. In this his coming<i> they are with the angels</i>, and<i> as</i> the angels: see Rev. xix. 14 (compare ver. 8): Zech. xiv. 5.
