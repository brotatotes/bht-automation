<b> 34.]</b> THE KING—here for the first and only time does the Lord give Himself this name: see Rev. xix. 16: Rom. xiv. 9.<br><br><b> Come]</b> Whatever of good these persons had done, was all<i> from Him</i> from whom cometh every good gift—and the<i> fruit of his Spirit</i>. And this Spirit is only purchased for man by the work of the Son, in whom the Father is well pleased: and to whom all judgment is committed. And thus<i> they are the blessed of the Father</i>, and those for whom this kingdom is prepared. It is not to the purpose to say that those<b> blessed of…</b>must be the elect of God in the<i> stricter sense</i> (<b>the Father</b>)—and that, because the Kingdom has been prepared for them from the foundation of the world. For evidently this would, in the divine omniscience, be true of every single man who shall come to salvation, whether belonging to those who shall be found worthy to share the first resurrection or not. The Scripture assures us of<i> two resurrections</i>: the<i> first,</i> of<i> the dead in Christ</i>, to meet Him and reign with Him, and hold (1 Cor. vi. 2) judgment over the world: the<i> second</i>, of<i> all the dead</i>, to be judged according to their works, And to what purpose would be a judgment, if<i> all were to be condemned</i>? And if any escape condemnation, to them might the words of this verse be used: so that this objection to the interpretation does not apply.<br><br><i> Election to life</i> is the universal doctrine of Scripture; but<i> not the reprobation of the wicked:</i> see below, on ver. 41. On<b> from the foundation of the world,</b> see John xvii. 24: 1 Pet. i. 20.
