These were not torches, nor wicks fastened on staves, as some have supposed, but properly<i> lamps:</i> and the oil vessels (which is most important to the parable) were<i> separate from</i><b> the lamps.</b> The lamps being the hearts lit with the flame of heavenly love and patience, supplied with the oil of the Spirit,—now comes in the difference between the wise and foolish:—the one<i> made no provision for the supply</i> of this—the others<i> did</i>. How so? The wise ones<i> gave all diligence to make their calling and election sure</i> (2 Pet. i. 10 and 5–8), making their bodies, souls, and spirits (their<i> vessels</i>, 2 Cor. iv. 7) a means of supplying spiritual food for the light within, by seeking, in the appointed means of grace, more and more of God’s Holy Spirit.
