</b>It is very important to observe the distinction between the blessing, ver. 34, and the curse here. ‘Blessed—<i>of my Father:</i>’—but not ‘cursed of my Father.’ because all man’s salvation is of God—all his condemnation<i> from himself</i>. ‘The Kingdom,<i> prepared for you:’</i> but ‘the fire, which has been prepared for<i> the devil and his angels</i>’ [greater definiteness could not be given than by the words in the original: that particular fire, that eternal fire, created for a special purpose]—not, for<i> you:</i> because<i> there is election to life</i>—but there is<i> no reprobation to death:</i> a<i> book of Life—</i>but<i> no book of Death</i>; no hell<i> for</i> man—because the blood of Jesus hath purchased life<i> for all</i>: but they who will<i> serve the devil, must share with him in the end.</i><br><br> The<i> repetition</i> of all these particulars shews how exact even for every individual the judgment will be. Stier excellently remarks, that the<i> curse</i> shews the<i> termination of the High Priesthood of Christ</i>, in which office He only intercedes and blesses. Henceforth He is King and Lord—his enemies being now for ever put under his feet.
