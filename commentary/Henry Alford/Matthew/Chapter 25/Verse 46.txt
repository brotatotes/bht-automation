<b> 46.]</b> See John v. 28, 29; and as taking up the prophetic history at this point, Rev. xxi. 1–8. Observe, the<i> same epithet</i> is used in the original for<b> punishment</b> and<b> life</b>—which are here<i> contraries</i>—for the<i> life</i> here spoken of is not bare<i> existence</i>, which would have<i> annihilation</i> for its opposite; but<i> blessedness</i> and<i> reward</i>, to which<i> punishment</i> and<i> misery</i> are antagonist terms. As regards the interpretation of this chapter, the coincidence of these portions of Scripture prophecy with the process of the great things in Rev. xx. and xxi. is never to be overlooked, and should be our guide to their explanation, however distrustful we may be of its certainty. Those who set this coincidence aside, and interpret each portion by itself, without connexion with the rest, are clearly wrong. The only alternative view seems to be that which regards this as the judgment at the time of Israel’s deliverance, previous to the Millennium. This has been urged on me lately by a very able correspondent: but I cannot see how it agrees with the great features of the description as pointed out above.
