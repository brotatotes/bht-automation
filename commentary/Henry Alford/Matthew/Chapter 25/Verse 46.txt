 46. ] See John 5:28-29 ; and as taking up the prophetic history at this point, Revelation 21:1-8 . Observe, the  same epithet is used for κόλασις and ζωή which are here  contraries for the ζωή here spoken of is not bare  existence , which would have  annihilation for its opposite; but  blessedness and  reward , to which  punishment and  misery are antagonist terms.
	I thought it proper to state in the 3rd edition, that I did not feel by any means that full confidence which I once did, in the exegesis, quoad prophetical interpretation, given of the three portions of this chap. 25. But I had no other system to substitute: and some of the points here dwelt on seemed to me as weighty as ever. I very much questioned whether the thorough study of Scripture prophecy would not make me more and more distrustful of all human systematizing, and less willing to hazard strong assertion on any portion of the subject.
	At the same time, the coincidence of these portions with the process of the great last things in Revelation 20:1-15 ; Rev 21:1-27 is never to be overlooked, and should be our guide to their explanation, however distrustful we may be of its certainty. Those who set this coincidence aside, and interpret each portion by itself, without connexion with the rest, are clearly wrong.
