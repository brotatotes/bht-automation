<b>delayed:</b> compare ch. xxiv. 48, where the Greek verb rendered<i> delayeth</i> is the same. The same English rendering ought to have been kept here. But the thought of the foolish virgins is very different from that of the wicked servant: his— ‘there will be plenty of time, my Lord tarrieth;'—theirs, ‘surely He will soon be here, there is no need of a store of oil.’ This may serve to shew how altogether diverse is the ground of the two parables.<br><br><b> they all slumbered and slept</b>] I believe no more is meant here than that all, being weak by nature, gave way to drowsiness: as indeed the wakefulness of the holiest Christian, compared with what it should be, is a sort of slumber:—but, the while, how much difference was there between them!Some understand this verse of sleep in death. But, not to mention that this will not fit the machinery of the parable (see below on ver. 8), it would assume (<b>they all</b>) that none of the faithful would be living on earth when the Lord comes.
