<p><strong> 10 12.</strong> ] We are <em> not told that they could not buy</em> that the shops were shut but simply that it was <em> too late for that time</em> . For it is <em> not the final coming of the Lord to judgment, when the day of grace will be past</em> , that is spoken of, except in so far as it is hinted at in the background, and in the individual application of the parable (virtually, not actually) coincides, to each man, with the day of his death. <em> This feast</em> is the <em> marriage supper</em> of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7-9">Revelation 19:7-9</span> (see also ib. Rev 19:2 ); <em> after which</em> these improvident ones gone to buy their oil shall be <em> judged in common with the rest of the dead</em> , ibid. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:12-13">Matthew 20:12-13</span> .

<p>Observe here, <strong> οὐκ οἶδα ὑμ</strong> <strong> .</strong> is very different, as the whole circumstances are different, from οὐδέποτε ἔγνων ὑμ . in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span> , where the ἀποχωρεῖτε ἀπ ʼ ἐμοῦ binds it to the πορεύεσθε ἀπ ʼ ἐμοῦ in our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span> , and to the time of the <em> final judgment</em> , spoken of in that parable. (See the note at the end of the chapter.)</p>
