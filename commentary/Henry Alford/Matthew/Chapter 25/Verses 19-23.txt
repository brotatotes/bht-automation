<p><strong> 19 23. </strong> <strong> μετὰ πολὺν χρόνον</strong> ] Here again, as well as in the χρονίζ . of Mat 25:5 and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:48">Matthew 24:48</span> , we have an intimation that the interval would be <em> no short one</em> .
	</p>
<p>This proceeding <em> is not</em> , strictly speaking, <em> the last judgment</em> , but still <em> the same as that in the former parable; the beginning of judgment at the house of God</em> the judgment of the <em> millennial advent</em> . This, to the servants of Christ ( τοὺς ἰδίους δούλους , Mat 25:14 ), is <em> their</em> final judgment but not that of the rest of the world. We may observe that this great <em> account</em> differs from the coming of the bridegroom, inasmuch as this is altogether concerned with a course of action <em> past</em> that with a present state of preparation. This holds, in the individual application, of <em> the account after the resurrection</em> : that, at the utmost (and not in the direct sense of the parable even so much), of being ready for his summons at death.</p>
