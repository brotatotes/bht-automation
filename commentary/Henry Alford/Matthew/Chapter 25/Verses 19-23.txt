 19 23.   μετὰ πολὺν χρόνον ] Here again, as well as in the χρονίζ . of Mat 25:5 and ch. Matthew 24:48 , we have an intimation that the interval would be  no short one .
	This proceeding  is not , strictly speaking,  the last judgment , but still  the same as that in the former parable; the beginning of judgment at the house of God the judgment of the  millennial advent . This, to the servants of Christ ( τοὺς ἰδίους δούλους , Mat 25:14 ), is  their final judgment but not that of the rest of the world. We may observe that this great  account differs from the coming of the bridegroom, inasmuch as this is altogether concerned with a course of action  past that with a present state of preparation. This holds, in the individual application, of  the account after the resurrection : that, at the utmost (and not in the direct sense of the parable even so much), of being ready for his summons at death.
