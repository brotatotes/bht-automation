<p><strong> 37 40.</strong> ] The answer of these δίκαιοι appears to me to shew plainly (as Olshausen and Stier interpret it) that they are <em> not</em> to be understood as being the covenanted servants of Christ. Such an answer it would be impossible for <em> them</em> to make, who had done all distinctly <em> with reference to Christ</em> , and for his sake, and with his declaration of ch.

See the remarkable difference in the answer of the faithful servants, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:20">Matthew 25:20</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:22">Matthew 25:22</span> . <em> The saints</em> are <em> already in his glory</em> judging the world with Him ( 1Co 6:2 ) accounted as parts of, representatives of, Himself ( Mat 25:40 ) in this judgment <em> they</em> are not the judged (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span> ; 1Co 11:31 ). But <em> these</em> who <em> are</em> the judged, <em> know not</em> that all their deeds of love have been done <em> to and for Christ</em> they are overwhelmed with the sight of the grace which has been working in and for them, and the glory which is now their blessed portion. And notice, that it is not the <em> works, as such</em> , but the <em> love</em> which prompted them that love which <em> was their faith</em> , which felt its way, though in darkness, to Him who is Love, which is commended.
