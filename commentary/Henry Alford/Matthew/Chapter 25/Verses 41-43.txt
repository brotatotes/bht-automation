 41 43. ] It is very important to observe the distinction between the blessing, Matthew 25:34 , and the curse here. ‘Blessed  of my Father :’ but not ‘cursed of my Father,’ because all man’s salvation  is of God all his condemnation  from himself . ‘The Kingdom,  prepared for you ;’ but ‘the fire, which has been prepared for  the devil and his angels ’ (notice  τὸ πῦρ  τὸ αἰών .  τὸ ἡτοιμ … greater definiteness could not be given: that particular fire, that eternal fire, created for a special purpose) not, for  you : because  there is election to life but there is  no reprobation to death : a  book of Life but  no book of Death ; no hell  for man because the blood of Jesus hath purchased life  for all : but they who will  serve the devil, must share with him in the end .
	The  repetition of all these particulars shews how exact even for every individual the judgment will be. Stier excellently remarks, that the  curse shews the  termination of the High Priesthood of Christ , in which office He only intercedes and blesses. Henceforth He is King and Lord his enemies being now for ever put under his feet.
