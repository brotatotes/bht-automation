<p><strong> 10. </strong> <strong> ἔργ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γὰρ καλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> εἰργ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Stier remarks that this is a stronger expression than ἔργ . ἀγαθὸν ἐποίησεν would have been. See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:16">Matthew 5:16</span> . It was not only ‘a good work,’ but a noble act of love, which should be spoken of in all the churches to the end of time. On <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:11">Matthew 26:11</span> , see notes on Mark, where it is more fully expressed.</p>
