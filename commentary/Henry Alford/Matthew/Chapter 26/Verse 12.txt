All the company surely knew well that His death, and that by crucifixion, was near at hand: can we suppose one who so closely observed his words as Mary, not to have been possessed with the thought of that which was about to happen? The “<i>she is come aforehand to anoint</i>” of Mark (xiv. 8), and the “<i>against the day of my burying hath she kept this</i>” of John (xii. 7), point even more strongly to her intention.
