<b> 13.]</b> The only case in which our Lord has made such a promise. We cannot but be struck with the majesty of this prophetic announcement: introduced with the peculiar and weighty<b> verily I say unto you,</b>—conveying, by implication, the whole mystery of the<b> gospel</b> which should go forth from His Death as its source,—looking forward to the end of time, when it have been preached in the whole world,—and specifying the fact that this deed should be recorded wherever it is preached. We may notice (1) that this announcement is a distinct prophetic recognition by our Lord of the existence of<i> written records</i>, in which the deed should be related; for in no other conceivable way could the universality of mention be brought about: (2) that we have here (if indeed we needed it) a convincing argument against that view of our three first Gospels which supposes them to have been compiled from an original document; for if there had been such a document, it must have contained this narrative, and no one using such a Gospel could have failed to insert this narrative, accompanied by such a promise, in his own work,—which St. Luke has not done: (3) that the same consideration is equally decisive against St. Luke having used, or even seen, our present Gospels of Matthew and Mark. (4) As regards the practical use of the announcement, we see that though the honourable mention of a noble deed is thereby recognized by our Lord as a legitimate source of joy to us, yet by the very nature of the case all regard to such mention as a<i> motive</i> is excluded. The motive was<i> love alone.</i>
