<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] <strong> ἔστησαν</strong> may be either <strong> weighed out,</strong> or <strong> appointed.</strong> That the money was <em> paid</em> to Judas (ch. Mat 27:3 ) is no decisive argument for the former meaning; for it may have been paid on the delivery of Jesus to the Sanhedrim. The συνέθεντο of Luke and ἐπηγγείλαντο of Mark would lead us to prefer the other.

<p><strong> τριάκοντα ἀργύρια</strong> ] thirty shekels, = the price of the life of a servant, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+21:32">Exodus 21:32</span> . Between three and four pounds of our money. St. Matthew is the only Evangelist who mentions the sum. De Wette and others have supposed that the mention of thirty pieces of silver with the verb ἔστησαν , has arisen from the prophecy of Zechariah (ref.), which St. Matthew clearly has in view. The others have simply ἀργύριον . It is just possible that the thirty pieces may have been merely <em> earnest-money</em> : but a difficulty attends the supposition; if so, Judas would have been entitled to the <em> whole</em> on our Lord being delivered up to the Sanhedrim (for this was all he undertook to do); whereas we find (ch. Mat 27:3 ) that, after our Lord’s condemnation, Judas brought only the thirty pieces back, and nothing more. See note there.</p>
