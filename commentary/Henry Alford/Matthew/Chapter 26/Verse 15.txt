<b> 15.]</b> The verb rendered<i> covenanted…for</i>, may mean either<b> weighed out</b>, or<b> appointed</b>. That the money was<i> paid</i> to Judas (ch. xxvii. 8) is no decisive argument for the former meaning; for it may have been paid on the delivery of Jesus to the Sanhedrin. The “<i>covenanted</i>” of St. Luke and “<i>promised</i>” of St. Mark would lead us to prefer the other.
