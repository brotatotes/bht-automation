<b> 15.]</b> The verb rendered<i> covenanted…for</i>, may mean either<b> weighed out</b>, or<b> appointed</b>. That the money was<i> paid</i> to Judas (ch. xxvii. 8) is no decisive argument for the former meaning; for it may have been paid on the delivery of Jesus to the Sanhedrin. The “<i>covenanted</i>” of St. Luke and “<i>promised</i>” of St. Mark would lead us to prefer the other.<br><br><b> thirty pieces of silver]</b> Thirty shekels, the price of the life of a servant, Exod. xxi. 32. Between three and four pounds of our money. St. Matthew is the only Evangelist who mentions the sum. De Wette and others have supposed that the accurate mention of the<i> thirty pieces of silver</i> has arisen from the prophecy of Zechariah (xi. 12), which St. Matthew clearly has in view. The others have simply “<i>money</i>.” It is just possible that the thirty pieces may have merely<i> earnest-money</i>: but a difficulty attends the supposition; if so, Judas would have been entitled to the<i> whole</i> on our Lord being delivered up to the Sanhedrim (for this was all he undertook to do); whereas we find (ch. xxvii. 8) that, after our Lord’s condemnation, Judas brought only the thirty pieces back, and nothing more. See note there.<br><br> The solutions which have been proposed are the following: (1) that the Passover which our Lord and his disciples ate, was not the ordinary, but an<i> anticipatory</i> one, seeing that He himself was about to be sacrificed as the true Passover at the legal time. To this it may be objected, that such an anticipation would have been wholly unprecedented and irregular, in a matter most strictly laid down by the law; and that in the three Gospels there is no allusion to it, but rather every thing (see above) to render it improbable. (2) That our Lord and his disciples ate the Passover, but at the time observed by<i> a certain portion of the Jews</i>, while He himself was sacrificed at the time<i> generally</i> observed. This solution is objectionable, as wanting any historical testimony whereon to ground it, being in fact a pure assumption. Besides, it is clearly inconsistent with Mark xiv. 12: Luke xxii. 7, cited above. A similar objection lies against (3) the notion that<i> our Lord</i> ate the Passover at the strictly legal,<i> the Jews</i> at an inaccurate and illegal time. (4) Our Lord ate only a<i> commemorative</i> Passover, such as the Jews now celebrate, and not a sacrificial Passover (Grotius). But this is refuted by the absence of any mention of a commemorative Passover<i> before the destruction of Jerusalem</i>; besides its inconsistency with the above-cited passages. (5) Our Lord<i> did not eat the Passover at all</i>. But this is plainly not a<i> solution</i> of the difficulty, but a setting aside of one of the differing accounts: for the three Gospels manifestly give the impression that He<i> did</i> eat it. (6) The solution offered by Chrysostom, on our ver. 58, is at least ingenious. The Council, he says, did not eat their Passover at the proper time, but “<i>on another day, and broke the law, because of their eagerness about this execution…they chose even to neglect the Passover, that they might fulfil their murderous desire.</i>” This had been suggested before in a scholium of Eusebius. But St. John’s habit of noticing and explaining all such exceptional circumstances, makes it very improbable. I may state, as some solutions have been sent me by correspondents, that I have seen nothing besides the above, which justifies any extended notice.<br><br> I will conclude this note by offering a few hints which, though not pointing to any particular solution, ought I think to enter into the consideration of the question. (<i>a</i>) That, on the evening of the 13th (i. e. the beginning of the 14th) of Nisan, the Lord<i> ate a meal with his disciples</i>, at which the announcement that one of them should betray Him was made: after which He went into the garden of Gethsemane, and was betrayed (Matt., Mark, Luke, John):— (<i>b</i>) That, in<i> some sense or other</i>, this meal<i> was regarded as the eating of the Passover</i> (Matt., Mark, Luke). (The same may be inferred even from John; for some of the disciples must have gone into the praetorium, and have heard the conversation between our Lord and Pilate [John xviii. 33–38]: and as they were equally bound with the other Jews to eat the Passover, would equally with them have been incapacitated from so doing by having incurred defilement,<i> had they not eaten theirs previously</i>. It would appear too, from Joseph of Arimathea<i> going to Pilate</i> during the<i> preparation</i> [Mark xv. 42, 43], that<i> he also had eaten his passover</i>.) (<i>c</i>) That it was<i> not the ordinary passover of the Jews</i>: for (Exod. xii. 22) when at was eaten, none might go out of the house until morning; whereas, not only did Judas go out during the meal (John xiii. 29), but our Lord and the disciples went out when the meal was finished. Also when Judas went out, it was understood that he was gone to<i> buy</i>, which could not have been the case, had it been the night of eating the Passover, which in all years was sabbatically hallowed. (<i>d</i>) St. John, who omits all mention of the Paschal nature of this meal, also omits all mention of the distribution of the symbolic bread and wine. The latter act was, strictly speaking, anticipatory: the Body was not yet broken, nor the Blood shed (but see note on ver. 26, end). Is it possible that the words in Luke xxii. 15, 16 may have been meant by our Lord as an express declaration of the anticipatory nature of that Passover meal likewise? May they mean, ‘I have been most anxious to eat this Paschal meal with you to-night (before I suffer), for I shall not eat it to-morrow,—I shall not eat of it any more with you?’ May a hint to the same effect be intended in ‘my time is at hand’ (ver. 18), as accounting for the time of making ready—may the present tense itself (<i>I will keep</i> is literally<i> I keep</i>) have the same reference?<br><br> I may remark that the whole of the narrative of St. John, as compared with the others, satisfies me that<i> he can never have seen their accounts</i>. It is inconceivable, that one writing for the purpose avowed in John xx. 31, could have found the three accounts as we have them, and have made no more allusion to the discrepancy than the faint (and to all appearance undesigned) ones in ib. ch. xii. 1; xiii. 1, 29; xviii. 28.
