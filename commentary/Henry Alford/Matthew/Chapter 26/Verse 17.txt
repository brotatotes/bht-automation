<b> 17. the first day of…unleavened bread]</b> If this night had been the ordinary time of sacrificing the Passover, the day preceding would not indeed have been strictly the first day of unleavened bread; but there is reason to suppose that it was accounted so. The putting away leaven from the houses was of the work of the day, and the eating of the unleavened bread actually commenced in the evening. Thus Josephus mentions eight days as constituting the feast,—including this day in it.
