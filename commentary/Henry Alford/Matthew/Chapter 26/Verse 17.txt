<b> 17. the first day of…unleavened bread]</b> If this night had been the ordinary time of sacrificing the Passover, the day preceding would not indeed have been strictly the first day of unleavened bread; but there is reason to suppose that it was accounted so. The putting away leaven from the houses was of the work of the day, and the eating of the unleavened bread actually commenced in the evening. Thus Josephus mentions eight days as constituting the feast,—including this day in it.<br><br><b> Where wilt thou]</b> The ‘making ready’ would include the following particulars; the ration of the guest-chamber itself (which however in this case was already done, see Mark xiv. 15 and note);—the lamb already kept up from the 10th (Exod. xii. 3) had to be slain in the fore-court of the temple (2 Chron. xxxv. 5);—the unleavened bread, bitter herbs, &c., prepared;—and the room arranged. This report does not represent the whole that passed: it was<i> the Lord who sent</i> the two disciples; and<i> in reply</i> this enquiry was made (Luke).
