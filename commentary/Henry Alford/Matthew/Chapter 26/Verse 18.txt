<p><strong> 18.</strong> ] The person spoken of was unknown even by name, as appears from Mark and Luke, where he is to be found by the <em> turning in of a man with a pitcher of water</em> . The Lord spoke not from any previous arrangement, as some have thought, but in virtue of His knowledge, and command of circumstances. Compare the command ch. Mat 21:2 sq., and that in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:27">Matthew 17:27</span> . In the words <strong> πρὸς τὸν δεῖνα</strong> here must be involved the additional circumstance mentioned by Mark and Luke, but perhaps unknown to our narrator: see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:10">Luke 22:10</span> , where the fullest account is found.

<p>The words <strong> ὁ διδάσκ</strong> <strong> .,</strong> common to the three accounts, do not imply that the man was <em> a disciple of our Lord</em> . It was the common practice during the feast for persons to receive strangers into their houses gratuitously, for the purpose of eating the Passover: and in this description of Himself in addressing a stranger, our Lord has a deep meaning, as (perhaps, but see note) in ὁ κύριος in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:3">Matthew 21:3</span> . ‘Our Master and thine says.’ It is His form of ‘pressing’ for the service of the King of this earth, the things that are therein.

<p><strong> ὁ καιρός μου</strong> is not ‘the <em> time of the feast</em> ,’ but <strong> my time,</strong> i.e. for suffering: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:8">John 7:8</span> a [169] . freq. There is no reason for supposing from this expression that ὁ δεῖνα was aware of its meaning. The bearers of the message were; and the words, to the receiver of it, bore with them a weighty subjective reason, which, with such a title as ὁ διδάσκαλος prefixed, he was bound to respect. For these words we are indebted to St. Matthew’s narrative.
