<b> 18.]</b> The person spoken of was unknown even by name, as appears from Mark and Luke, where he is to be found by the<i> turning in of a man with a pitcher of water</i>. The Lord spoke not from any previous arrangement, as some have thought, but in virtue of His knowledge, and command of circumstances. Compare the command ch. xxi. 2f., and that in ch. xvii. 27. In the words to<b> such a man</b> here must be involved the additional circumstance mentioned by St. Mark and St. Luke, but perhaps unknown to our narrator: see note on Luke xxii. 10, where the fullest account is found.
