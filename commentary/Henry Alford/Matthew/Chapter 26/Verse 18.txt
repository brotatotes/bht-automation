<b> 18.]</b> The person spoken of was unknown even by name, as appears from Mark and Luke, where he is to be found by the<i> turning in of a man with a pitcher of water</i>. The Lord spoke not from any previous arrangement, as some have thought, but in virtue of His knowledge, and command of circumstances. Compare the command ch. xxi. 2f., and that in ch. xvii. 27. In the words to<b> such a man</b> here must be involved the additional circumstance mentioned by St. Mark and St. Luke, but perhaps unknown to our narrator: see note on Luke xxii. 10, where the fullest account is found.<br><br> The term<b> the Master</b>, common to the three accounts, does not imply that the man was<i> a disciple of our Lord</i>. It was the common practice during the feast for persons to receive strangers into their houses gratuitously, for the purpose of eating the Passover: and in this description of Himself in addressing a stranger, our Lord has a deep meaning, as (perhaps, but see note) in<i> the Lord</i> in ch. xxi. 3,— ‘Our Master and thine says.’ It is His form of ‘pressing’ for the service of the King of this earth, the things that are therein.<br><br><b> My time</b> is not ‘the<i> time of the feast</i>,’ but<b> my</b> own<b> time</b>, i.e. for suffering: see John vii. 8, and often. There is no reason for supposing from this expression that the man addressed was aware of its meaning. The bearers of the message were; and the words, to the receiver of it, bore with them a weighty reason of their own, which, with such a title as the Master prefixed, he was bound to respect. For these words we are indebted to St. Matthew's narrative,
