 18. ] The person spoken of was unknown even by name, as appears from Mark and Luke, where he is to be found by the  turning in of a man with a pitcher of water . The Lord spoke not from any previous arrangement, as some have thought, but in virtue of His knowledge, and command of circumstances. Compare the command ch. Mat 21:2 sq., and that in ch. Matthew 17:27 . In the words  πρὸς τὸν δεῖνα here must be involved the additional circumstance mentioned by Mark and Luke, but perhaps unknown to our narrator: see note on Luke 22:10 , where the fullest account is found.
	The words  ὁ διδάσκ  ., common to the three accounts, do not imply that the man was  a disciple of our Lord . It was the common practice during the feast for persons to receive strangers into their houses gratuitously, for the purpose of eating the Passover: and in this description of Himself in addressing a stranger, our Lord has a deep meaning, as (perhaps, but see note) in ὁ κύριος in ch. Matthew 21:3 . ‘Our Master and thine says.’ It is His form of ‘pressing’ for the service of the King of this earth, the things that are therein.
	 ὁ καιρός μου is not ‘the  time of the feast ,’ but  my time, i.e. for suffering: see John 7:8 a [169] . freq. There is no reason for supposing from this expression that ὁ δεῖνα was aware of its meaning. The bearers of the message were; and the words, to the receiver of it, bore with them a weighty subjective reason, which, with such a title as ὁ διδάσκαλος prefixed, he was bound to respect. For these words we are indebted to St. Matthew’s narrative.
