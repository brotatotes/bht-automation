<b> 27. gave it]</b><b> He</b> gave, not to each, but once for all: in remarkable coincidence with Luke xxii. 17.<i> take this and divide it amongst yourselves.</i> This was<i> after the meal was ended</i>:<i> likewise also the cup after supper.</i> (Luke and 1 Cor.) As remarked above, it is quite uncertain whether our Lord followed minutely the Jewish practices, and we cannot therefore say whether the cup was one of wine and water mixed. It hardly follows from the expression of ver. 29, of this<i> fruit of the vine</i>, that it was of unmixed wine. The word<b> likewise</b> (in Luke and 1 Cor.) contains our details of<i> taking and giving thanks</i> in it.<b> Drink ye all of it</b>] Peculiar to Matthew, preserved however in substance by Mark’s “<i>and they all drank of it</i>.” The<b> all</b> is remarkable, especially with reference to the practice of the Church of Rome, which forbids the cup to the laity. Calvin remarks: “<i>Why did He simply command them to eat the bread, while of the cup He commanded them all to drink?</i> It is as if He had intended to anticipate the craft of Satan.” It is on all accounts probable, and this command confirms the probability, that Judas<i> was present</i>, and<i> partook of both parts</i> of this first communion. The expressions are such throughout as to lead us to suppose that the same persons,<i> the Twelve</i>, were present. On the circumstance mentioned John xiii. 30, which has mainly contributed to the other opinion, see note there.<br><br><b> 28. for this is my blood of the [new] testament]</b> So St. Mark also, omitting<i> for</i> and<i> new.</i> In Luke and 1 Cor. there is an important verbal difference.<i> This cup is the new testament in my blood</i>. But if we consider the matter closely, the<i> real</i> difference is but trifling, if any, Let us recur to the paschal rite. The lamb (<i>Christ our passover</i>) being killed, the blood (the blood of the covenant [testament], Exod. xxiv. 8) is sprinkled on the doorposts, and is a sign to the destroying angel to spare the house. The<i> blood of the covenant</i> is the blood of the lamb. So also in the new covenant. The blood of the Lamb of God, slain for us, being not only as in the former case, sprinkled on, but actually<i> partaken spiritually and assimilated by</i> the faithful soul, is the<i> blood of the new covenant;</i> and the sacramental cup, is, signifies, sets forth (1 Cor. xi. 26), this covenant<i> in His blood,</i> i.e. consisting in a participation in His blood. With this explanation let us recur to the words in our text. First it will be observed that there is not here that absolute assertion which “<i>this is My body</i>” conveyed. It is not “<i>this is my blood</i>” absolutely. Wine,<i> in general</i>, does not represent by itself the effects (on the creation) of the blood of Christ; it, like every other nourishment of the body, is nourishment to us<i> by and in Him,</i> forasmuch as in Him all things consist: but there is no peculiar propriety whereby it is to us his Blood alone. But it is<i> made so by a covenant office</i> which it holds in his own declaration. Without shedding of blood, was no remission of sins under the old covenant: and<i> blood</i> was, throughout, the covenant sign of forgiveness and acceptance. Now all this blood of sacrifice finds its true reality and fulfilment in the blood of Christ, shed for the remission of sins. This is the very promise of the new covenant, see Heb. viii. 8–13, as distinguished from the old: the<i> remission of sins</i>, once for all,—whereas the old had<i> continual</i> offerings, which could not do this, Heb. x. 3, 4. And of this remission, the result of the outpouring of the blood of Christ,—<i>first and most</i><i> generally</i> in bringing all creation into reconciliation with the Father (see Col. i. 20),—<i>secondly and individually</i>, in the application by faith of that blood to the believing soul,—do the faithful in the Lord’s Supper partake.<br><br><b> which is</b> [<b>being</b>]<b> shed for many</b> (for<i> you</i>, Luke)] On the present participle, see above. The situation of the words in Luke is remarkable; for the<i> cup</i> is the subject of the sentence, and<i> the new testament</i> the predicate. See note there.<br><br><b> many]</b> See note, ch. xx. 28. Compare also Heb. ix. 28.<br><br><b> for the remission of sins]</b> Peculiar to Matthew: see above. The connexion is not “<i>Drink it... for the remission of sins</i>.” In the Sacrament, not the forgiveness of sins itself, but the refreshing and confirming<i> assurance of that state of forgiveness</i> is conveyed. The disciples (with one exception) were clean<i> before the institution:</i> John xiii. 10, 11. St. Paul, in 1 Cor. xi. 25, repeats the<i> Do this as oft as</i><i> ye drink it in remembrance of Me.</i> On the words<i> as oft as ye drink it</i>, see note there.<br><br> In concluding this note, I will observe that it is not the office of a Commentator to enter the arena of controversy respecting<i> transubstantiation</i>, further than by his interpretation his opinions are made apparent. It will be seen how entirely opposed to such a dogma is the view above given of the Sacrament. Once introduce it, and it<i> utterly destroys both the verity of Christ's Body</i>, and<i> the sacramental nature of the ordinance</i>. That it has done so, is proved (if further need be) by the<i> mutilation</i><i> of the Sacrament</i>, and disobedience to the divine command, in the Church of Rome. See further notices of this in notes on 1 Cor. x. 16, and on John vi.
