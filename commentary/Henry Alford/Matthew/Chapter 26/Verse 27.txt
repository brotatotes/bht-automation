 27. ]  ἔδωκεν  , aor. He gave, not to each, but once for all: in remarkable coincidence with Luke 22:17 , λάβετε τοῦτο κ . διαμερίσατε ἑαυτοῖς . This was  after the meal was ended : ὡσαύτως καὶ τὸ ποτήριον μετὰ τὸ δειπνῆσαι . (Luke and 1 Cor.) As remarked above, it is quite uncertain whether our Lord followed minutely the Jewish practices, and we cannot therefore say whether the cup was one of wine and water mixed. It hardly follows from the expression of Matthew 26:29 , ἐκ τούτου τοῦ γεν . τ . ἀμπ ., that it was of unmixed wine. The word  ὡσαύτως (in Luke and 1 Cor.) contains our λαβὼν καὶ εὐχαρ . ἔδωκ .

The  πάντες is remarkable, especially with reference to the practice of the Church of Rome, which forbids the cup to the laity. Calvin remarks: “Cur de pane simpliciter dixit ut ederent; de calice, ut  omnes biberent? Ac si Satanæ calliditati ex destinato occurrere voluisset.” (Cited in Stier, vi. 115.) It is on all accounts probable, and this command confirms the probability, that Judas  was present , and  partook of both parts of this first communion. The expressions are such throughout as to lead us to suppose that the same persons, οἱ δώδεκα , were present. On the circumstance mentioned John 13:30 , which has mainly contributed to the other opinion, see note there.
