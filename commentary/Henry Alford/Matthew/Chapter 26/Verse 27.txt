<b> 27. gave it]</b><b> He</b> gave, not to each, but once for all: in remarkable coincidence with Luke xxii. 17.<i> take this and divide it amongst yourselves.</i> This was<i> after the meal was ended</i>:<i> likewise also the cup after supper.</i> (Luke and 1 Cor.) As remarked above, it is quite uncertain whether our Lord followed minutely the Jewish practices, and we cannot therefore say whether the cup was one of wine and water mixed. It hardly follows from the expression of ver. 29, of this<i> fruit of the vine</i>, that it was of unmixed wine. The word<b> likewise</b> (in Luke and 1 Cor.) contains our details of<i> taking and giving thanks</i> in it.<b> Drink ye all of it</b>] Peculiar to Matthew, preserved however in substance by Mark’s “<i>and they all drank of it</i>.” The<b> all</b> is remarkable, especially with reference to the practice of the Church of Rome, which forbids the cup to the laity. Calvin remarks: “<i>Why did He simply command them to eat the bread, while of the cup He commanded them all to drink?</i> It is as if He had intended to anticipate the craft of Satan.” It is on all accounts probable, and this command confirms the probability, that Judas<i> was present</i>, and<i> partook of both parts</i> of this first communion. The expressions are such throughout as to lead us to suppose that the same persons,<i> the Twelve</i>, were present. On the circumstance mentioned John xiii. 30, which has mainly contributed to the other opinion, see note there.
