 29. ] This declaration I believe to be distinct from that in Luke 22:18 . That was spoken over the first cup this over one of the following. In addition to what has been said on Luke, we may observe, (1) that our Lord  still calls the sacramental cup τὸ γέν . τῆς ἀμπ ., although by Himself pronounced to be his blood: (2) that these words  carry on the meaning and continuance of this eucharistic ordinance, even into the new heavens and new earth. As Thiersch excellently says, in his Lectures on Catholicism and Protestantism, ii. 276 (cited by Stier, vi. 160), “The Lord’s Supper points not only to the past, but to the future also. It has not only a commemorative, but also a prophetic meaning. In it we have not only to shew forth the Lord’s death,  until He come , but we have also  to think of the time when He shall come to celebrate his holy Supper with His own, new, in his Kingdom of Glory. Every celebration of the Lord’s Supper is a foretaste and prophetic anticipation of the  great Marriage Supper which is prepared for the Church at the second appearing of Christ. This import of the Sacrament is declared in the words of the Lord, οὐ μὴ πίω ἀπ ʼ ἄρτι κ . τ . λ . These words ought never to be omitted in any liturgical form of administering the Communion.”
