<p><strong> 32.</strong> ] In this announcement our Lord seems to have in mind the remainder of the verse in Zechariah: “and I will turn ( הֵשִׁיב , reducere manum, i.e. impiis sublatis curam agere, &amp;c. Schröder) mine hand upon the little ones.” As this could not be <em> cited</em> in any intelligible connexion with present circumstances, our Lord gives the announcement of its fulfilment, in a promise to <em> precede</em> them ( προάγ ., a pastoral office, see Joh 10:4 ) into Galilee, whither they should naturally return after the feast was over: see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:7">Matthew 28:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:10">Matthew 28:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:16">Matthew 28:16</span> . Schleiermacher thinks it “extremely improbable that Jesus, if He foresaw so exactly the days of His resurrection, and therefore could not but know that He should see his disciples again more than once in Jerusalem, should here have said that He would lead them into Galilee” (English Translation, p. 298). I confess that I see no improbability in the case; but the three references to this promise just quoted make it surely in the highest degree improbable that it should have been <em> subsequently foisted in</em> . We do not find such elaborate attempts to preserve the appearance of consistency in our Gospels. The reader who sees in it the reference to prophecy, will form a very different opinion.</p>
