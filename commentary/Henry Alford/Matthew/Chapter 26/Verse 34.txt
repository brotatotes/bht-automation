<b> 34.]</b> The very words<i> in their order</i> are, I doubt not, reported by St. Mark,— “<i>This day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</i>” The contrast to Peter’s boast, and the climax, is in these words the strongest; and the inference also comes out most clearly, that they likewise were not now said for the first time.<br><br> The<i> first</i> cock-crowing is at midnight: but inasmuch as<i> few hear it</i>,—when the word is used<i> generally</i>, we mean the<i> second</i> crowing, early in the morning, before dawn. If this view be taken, the cock-crowing and double cock-crowing amount to the same—only the latter is the<i> more precise</i> expression. It is most likely that Peter understood this expression as only a<i> mark of time</i>, and therefore received it, as when it was spoken before, as merely an expression of distrust on the Lord’s part; it was this solemn and circumstantial repetition of it which afterwards struck upon his mind, when the sign itself was literally fulfilled.<br><br> A question has been raised whether<i> cocks were usually kept</i> or even allowed in Jerusalem. No such bird is mentioned in the O.T., and the Mischna states that the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests every where, kept no fowls, because they scratched up unclean worms. But the Talmud is here not consistent with itself: and Lightfoot brings forward a story which proves it. And there might be many kept by the resident Romans, over whom the Jews had no power.<br><br> We must not overlook the spiritual parabolic import of this warning. Peter stands here as a representative of all disciples who deny or forget Christ—and the watchful bird that cries in the night is that warning voice which ‘speaketh once, yea twice,’ to call them to repentance: see Rom. xiii. 11, 12.
