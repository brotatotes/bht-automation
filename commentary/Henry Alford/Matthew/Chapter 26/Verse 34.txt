 34. ] The very words  in their order are, I doubt not, reported by St. Mark ἀμὴν λ . σοι ὅτι σήμερον ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ πρὶν ἢ δὶς ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι τ . με ἀπ . The contrast to Peter’s boast, and the climax, is in these words the strongest; and the inference also comes out most clearly, that they likewise were not now said for the first time. The  first cock-crowing is at midnight; but inasmuch as  few hear it , when the word is used  generally , we mean the  second crowing, early in the morning, before dawn. If this view be taken, the ἀλέκτ . φων . and δὶς ἀλ . φ . amount to the same only the latter is the  more precise expression. It is most likely that Peter understood this expression as only a  mark of time , and therefore received it, as when it was spoken before, as merely an expression of distrust on the Lord’s part; it was this solemn and circumstantial repetition of it which afterwards struck upon his mind when the sign itself was literally fulfilled.
	A question has been raised whether  cocks were usually kept or even allowed in Jerusalem. No such bird is mentioned in the O.T., and the Mischna states that the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests every where, kept no fowls, because they scratched up unclean worms. But the Talmud is here not consistent with itself: and Lightfoot brings forward a story which proves it. And there might be many kept by the resident Romans, over whom the Jews had no power.
	We must not overlook the spiritual parabolic import of this warning. Peter stands here as a representative of all disciples who deny or forget Christ and the watchful bird that cries in the night is that warning voice which ‘speaketh once, yea twice,’ to call them to repentance: see Romans 13:11-12 .
