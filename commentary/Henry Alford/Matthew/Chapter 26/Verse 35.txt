<b> 35.]</b> This<b> though I must</b> again appears to have the precision of a repeated asseveration. St. Mark has the stronger expression<i> “he spake the more vehemently,”</i> which even more clearly indicates that the<i> die with thee</i> not now first said. The rest said it, but not so earnestly perhaps;—at all events, Peter's confidence cast theirs into the shade.<br><br> The right understanding of the whole important narration must be acquired by bearing in mind the<i> reality of the manhood of our Lord, in all its abasement and weakness:</i>—by following out in Him the analogy which per the characteristics of human suffering—the strength of the resolved spirit, and calm of the resigned will, continually broken in upon by the inward giving way of human feebleness, and limited power of endurance. But as in us, so in the Lord, these seasons of dread and conflict stir not the ruling<i> will</i>, alter not the firm resolve. This is moat manifest in His<i> first</i> prayer—<i>if it be possible</i>— ‘if consistent with that work which I have covenanted to do.’ Here is the reserve of the will to suffer—<i>it is never stirred</i> (see below). The conflict however of the Lord differs from ours in this,—that in<i> us</i>, the ruling<i> will</i> itself is<i> but</i> a phase of our<i> human</i> will, and may be and is often carried away by the excess of depression and suffering; whereas in<i> Him</i> it was the<i> divine Personality</i> in which the<i> higher Will of the covenant was eternally fixed</i>,—struggling with the flesh now overwhelmed with an horrible dread, and striving to escape away (see the whole of Ps. lv.). Besides that, by that uplifting into a superhuman circle of<i> Knowledge</i>, with which the indwelling of the Godhead endowed His humanity, His flesh, with all its capacities and apprehensions, was brought<i> at once</i> into immediate and simultaneous contact with every circumstance of horror and pain that awaited Him (John xviii. 4), which is never the case with us. Not only are the objects of dread<i> gradually</i> unveiled to our minds, but<i> hope</i> is ever suggesting that things may not be so bad as our fears represent them.<br><br> Then we must not forget, that as the<i> flesh</i> gave way under dread of suffering, so the<i> human</i><i> soul</i> was troubled with all the attendant circumstances of that suffering—betrayal, desertion, shame (see Ps. lv. again, vv. 12–14, 20, 21; xxxviii. 11, 12; lxxxviii. al.). Nor again must we pass over the last and deepest mystery of the Passion—the consideration, that upon the holy and innocent Lamb of God rested the burden of<i> all</i> human sin—that to Him, death, as the punishment of<i> sin</i>, bore a dark and dreadful meaning, inconceivable by any of us, whose inner will is tainted by the<i> love</i> of sin. See on this part of the Redeemer’s agony, Ps. xl. 12; xxxviii. 1–10. See also as a comment on the whole, Heb. v. 7–10, and notes there.<br><br> The three accounts do not differ in any important particulars. St. Luke merely gives a general summary of the Lord’s prayers and his sayings to the disciples, but inserts (see below) two details not found in the others. St. Mark’s account and St. Matthew’s are very nearly related, and have evidently sprung from the same source.
