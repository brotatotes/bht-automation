St. John informs us that it was<i> a garden</i>. The name signifies ‘<i>an oil press</i>.’ It was at the foot of the Mount of Olives, in the valley of the Kedron, the other side of the brook from the city (John xviii. 1).<br><br><b> while I go and pray]</b> Such is the name which our Lord gives to that which was coming upon Him, in speaking to the Eight who were not to witness it.<i> All conflict of the holy soul is prayer:</i> all its struggles are continued communion with God. In Gen. xxii. 5, when Abraham’s faith was to be put to so sore a trial, he says, ‘I and the lad will<i> go yonder and worship</i>.’ Our Lord (almost on the same spot) unites in Himself, as the priest and victim, as Stier strikingly remarks, Abraham’s Faith and Isaac’s Patience.<br><br><b> yonder—</b>probably some spot deeper in the garden’s shade. At this time the gorge of the Kedron would be partly in the moonlight, partly shaded by the rocks and buildings of the opposite side.<br><br> It may have been from the moonlight into the shade that our Lord retired to pray.
