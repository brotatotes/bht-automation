The expression is said to be  proverbial (see ref. Jonah): but we must remember that though with  us men , who see from below, proverbs are merely bold guesses at truth, with  Him , who sees from above, they are  the truth itself , in its very purest form. So that although when used  by a man , a proverbial expression is not to be pressed to literal exactitude, when used  by our Lord , it is, just  because it is a proverb, to be searched into and dwelt on all the more. The expression  ἡ ψυχή μου  , in this sense, spoken by our Lord, is only found besides in John 12:27 . It is the  human soul , the seat of the affections and passions, which is troubled with the anguish of the body; and it is distinguished from the πνεῦμα , the  higher spiritual being . Our Lord’s soul was crushed down even to death by the weight of that anguish which lay upon Him and that  literally so that He (as regards his humanity)  would have died , had not strength (  bodily strength, upholding his human frame) been ministered from on high by an angel (see note on Luk 22:43 ).
