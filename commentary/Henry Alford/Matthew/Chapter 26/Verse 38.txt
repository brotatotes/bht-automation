<b> 38.]</b> Our Lord’s whole inmost life must have been one of<i> continued trouble of spirit</i>—He was a<i> man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief</i>—but there was an<i> extremity of anguish</i> now, reaching even to the<i> utmost limit of endurance</i>, so that it seemed that<i> more</i> would be<i> death itself</i>. The expression is said to be<i> proverbial</i> (see Jonah iv. 9): but we must remember that though with<i> us men</i>, who see from below, proverbs are merely bold guesses at truth,—with<i> Him</i>, who sees from above, they are<i> the truth itself</i>, in its very purest form. So that although when used<i> by a man</i>, a proverbial expression is not to be to literal exactitude,—when<i> by our Lord</i>, it is, just<i> because</i> it is a proverb, to be searched into and dwelt on all the more.<br><br> The expression<b> my soul</b>, in this sense, spoken by our Lord, is only found besides in John xii. 27. It is the<i> human soul</i>, the seat of the affections and passions, which is troubled with the anguish of the body; and it is distinguished from the<b> spirit</b>, the<i> higher spiritual being</i>. Our Lord’s soul was crushed down even to death by the weight of that anguish which lay upon Him—and that<i> literally</i>—so that He (as regards his humanity)<i> would have died</i>, had not strength (<i>bodily</i> strength, upholding his human frame) been ministered from on high by an angel (see note on Luke xxii. 43).<br><br><b> watch with me]</b> not<i> pray with me</i>, for in that work the Mediator must be<i> alone</i>; but (see above)<i> watch</i> with Me—just (if we may compare<i> our</i> weakness with His) as we derive comfort in the midst of a terrible storm, from knowing that some are awake and with us, even though their presence is no real safeguard.
