<b> 38.]</b> Our Lord’s whole inmost life must have been one of<i> continued trouble of spirit</i>—He was a<i> man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief</i>—but there was an<i> extremity of anguish</i> now, reaching even to the<i> utmost limit of endurance</i>, so that it seemed that<i> more</i> would be<i> death itself</i>. The expression is said to be<i> proverbial</i> (see Jonah iv. 9): but we must remember that though with<i> us men</i>, who see from below, proverbs are merely bold guesses at truth,—with<i> Him</i>, who sees from above, they are<i> the truth itself</i>, in its very purest form. So that although when used<i> by a man</i>, a proverbial expression is not to be to literal exactitude,—when<i> by our Lord</i>, it is, just<i> because</i> it is a proverb, to be searched into and dwelt on all the more.
