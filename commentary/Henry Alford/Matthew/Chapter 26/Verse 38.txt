<p><strong> 38.</strong> ] Our Lord’s whole inmost life must have been one of <em> continued trouble of spirit</em> He was a <em> man of sorrows</em> , and <em> acquainted with grief</em> but there was an <em> extremity of anguish</em> now, reaching even to the <em> utmost limit of endurance</em> , so that it seemed that <em> more</em> would be <em> death itself</em> . The expression is said to be <em> proverbial</em> (see ref. Jonah): but we must remember that though with <em> us men</em> , who see from below, proverbs are merely bold guesses at truth, with <em> Him</em> , who sees from above, they are <em> the truth itself</em> , in its very purest form. So that although when used <em> by a man</em> , a proverbial expression is not to be pressed to literal exactitude, when used <em> by our Lord</em> , it is, just <em> because</em> it is a proverb, to be searched into and dwelt on all the more. The expression <strong> ἡ ψυχή μου</strong> <strong> ,</strong> in this sense, spoken by our Lord, is only found besides in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:27">John 12:27</span> . It is the <em> human soul</em> , the seat of the affections and passions, which is troubled with the anguish of the body; and it is distinguished from the πνεῦμα , the <em> higher spiritual being</em> . Our Lord’s soul was crushed down even to death by the weight of that anguish which lay upon Him and that <em> literally</em> so that He (as regards his humanity) <em> would have died</em> , had not strength ( <em> bodily</em> strength, upholding his human frame) been ministered from on high by an angel (see note on Luk 22:43 ).

<p><strong> γρηγορεῖτε μετ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ἐμοῦ</strong> ] not προσεύχεσθε μετ ʼ ἐμοῦ , for in that work the Mediator must be <em> alone</em> ; but (see above) <em> watch</em> with Me just (if we may compare <em> our</em> weakness with His) as we derive comfort in the midst of a terrible storm, from knowing that some are awake and with us, even though their presence is no real safeguard.</p>
