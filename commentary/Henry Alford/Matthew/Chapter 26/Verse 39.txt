<b> 39.] went a little farther</b> (Matt., Mark):<i> was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast</i>, Luke, who in this description is the more precise. The verb, in the original, implies something more than<i> mere removal</i> from them—something of the<i> reluctance</i> of parting.<br><br> The distance would be very small, not above forty or fifty yards. Hence the disciples might well catch the leading words of our Lord's prayers, before drowsiness overpowered them. Luke has however only<i> kneeled down</i>, which is not so full as our account.<br><br><b> prayed]</b> Stier finely remarks: ‘This<b> was</b> in truth a different prayer from that which went before, which John has recorded.’ But still in the same spirit, uttered by the same Son of God and Redeemer of men. The<i> glorifying</i> (John xvii. 1) begins with suffering, as the previous words,<i> the hour is come</i>, might lead us to expect. The ‘power over all flesh’ shews itself first as power of the conflicting and victorious spirit over<i> his own flesh</i>, by virtue of which He is ‘one of us.’<br><br> St. Mark expresses the<i> substance</i> of the prayer, and interprets<i> cup</i> by<i> hour</i>. St. Luke’s report differs only in verbal expression from St. Matthew’s. In the address, we have here and in Luke<b> Father</b>—in Mark<i> Abba,</i><i> Father</i>. In all, and in the prayer itself, there is the deepest feeling and apprehension in the Redeemer’s soul of<i> his Sonship</i><i> and the unity of the Father</i>—the most entire and holy submission to His Will. We must not for a moment think of the Father’s<i> wrath</i> abiding on Him as the cause of his suffering. Here is no fear of wrath,—but, in the depth of His human anguish, the very tenderness of filial love.<br><br> The variation in Mark and Luke in the substance of the prayer, though slight, is worthy of remark.<br><br><b> if it be possible,</b>—<i>all things are possible with thee,—if thou be willing</i>. All these three find their union in one and the same inward feeling. That in the text expresses, ‘If, within the limits of thy holy will, this may be;’—that in Mark, ‘All things are (absolutely) possible to Thee—Thou<i> canst</i> therefore—but not what I will, but what thou<i> wilt:’</i>—that in Luke, ‘If it be thy<i> will</i> to remove, &c. (Thou canst): but not my will, but thine be done.’<i> The very words used</i> by our Lord, the Holy Spirit has not seen fit to give us; shewing us, even in this solemn instance, the comparative indifference of the<i> letter</i>, when we have the inner<i> spirit</i>. That our Lord should have uttered<i> all three</i> forms of the prayer, is not for a moment to be thought of; and such a view could only spring out of the most petty and unworthy appreciation of the purpose of Scripture narrative.<br><br><b> pass from me]</b> as we should say of a threatening cloud, ‘It has<i> gone over.</i>’ But what is the<i> cup</i> or<i> hour</i>, of which our Lord here prays that it may<i> pass by?</i> Certainly, not the mere present feebleness and prostration of the bodily frame: not any mere section of his sufferings—but<i> the whole</i>—the betrayal, the trial, the mocking, the scourging, the cross, the grave, and all besides which our thoughts cannot reach. Of this all, His soul, in humble subjection to the higher Will, which was absolutely united and harmonious with the will of the Father, prays that if possible it may pass over. And this prayer<i> was heard</i>—see Heb. v. 7— “<i>in that he feared</i>”—on account of His pious resignation to the Father’s will, or<i> on the ground of</i> it, so that it prevailed—He was strengthened from Heaven. He did indeed drink the cup to the dregs—but He was<i> enabled</i> to do it, and this<i> strengthening</i> was the answer to his prayer.<br><br><b> nevertheless not as I will....]</b> The Monothelite heresy, which held<i> but one will</i> in the Lord Jesus, is here plainly convicted of error. The distinction is clear, and marked by our Lord Himself. In his<i> human soul</i>, He willed to be freed from the dreadful things before Him—but this human will was overruled by the<i> inner and divine purpose</i>—the will at unity with the Father’s will.
