<b> 41.]</b> St. Luke gives this command at the beginning and end of the whole; but his account is manifestly only a compendium, and not to be pressed chronologically. The command has respect to the immediate trial which was about to try them, and (for<b> watch</b> is a word of<i> habit</i>, not merely, as “<i>arise</i>” Eph. v. 15, or “<i>awake to righteousness</i>” 1 Cor. xv. 34, one of immediate import) also to the<i> general duty of all disciples in all time.</i><br><br><b> enter into temptation</b> is not to c<i> ome into</i> temptation merely, to be<i> tempted</i>: this lies not in our own power to avoid, and its happening is rather joy than sorrow to us—see James i. 2, where the word is “<i>fall into</i>”—but it implies an<b> entering into temptation</b> with the<i> will</i>, and<i> entertaining</i> of the temptation. Compare<i> “fall into temptation”</i> used in<i> this</i> sense, 1 Tim. vi. 9.<br><br><b> the spirit...]</b> I cannot doubt that this is said by our in its most general meaning, and that<i> He himself is included</i> in it. At that moment He was giving as high and pre-eminent an example of its truth, as the disciples were affording a low and ignoble one. He, in the willingness of the spirit—yielding Himself to the Father’s will to suffer and die, but weighed down by the weakness of the flesh: they having professed, and really<i> having</i>, a willing spirit to suffer with Him, but, even in the one hour’s watching, overcome by the burden of drowsiness. Observe it is here<b> spirit</b>, not<i> soul</i>; and compare ver. 38 and note. To enter further into the depths of this assertion of our Lord would carry us beyond the limits of annotation: but see Stier’s remarks, vi. 237–242.
