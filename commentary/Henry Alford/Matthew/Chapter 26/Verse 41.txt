 41. ] Luke gives this command at the beginning and end of the whole; but his account is manifestly only a compendium, and not to be pressed chronologically. The command has respect to the immediate trial which was about to try them, and (for  γρηγ  . is a word of  habit , not merely, as ἐγείρω Ephesians 5:15 , or ἐκνήφω 1 Corinthians 15:34 , one of immediate import) also to the  general duty of all disciples in all time .
	 εἰσελθεῖν εἰς π  . is not to  come into temptation merely, to be  tempted : this lies not in our own power to avoid, and its happening is rather joy than sorrow to us see James 1:2 , where the word is περιπέσητε but it implies an  entering into temptation with the  will , and  entertaining of the temptation. Grotius compares ἐμπίπτειν εἰς πειρασμόν 1 Timothy 6:9 . ‘Plenius Hebræi dicunt, intrare in manum tentationis, hoc est, in ejus potestatem atque dominium, ita ut ab ea subjugemur atque absorbeamur’ (Witsius, Exerc. in Orat. Dom. p. 196, cited by Stier, vi. 237).
	 τὸ μὲν πν  . ] I cannot doubt that this is said by our Lord in its most general meaning, and that  He Himself is included in it. At that moment He was giving as high and pre-eminent an example of its truth, as the disciples were affording a low and ignoble one. He, in the willingness of the spirit yielding Himself to the Father’s Will to suffer and die, but weighed down by the weakness of the flesh: they, having professed, and really  having , a willing spirit to suffer with Him, but, even in the one hour’s watching, overcome by the burden of drowsiness. Observe it is here  πνεῦμα  , not ψυχή ; and compare Mat 26:38 and note. To enter further into the depths of this assertion of our Lord would carry us beyond the limits of annotation: but see Stier’s remarks, vi. 237 242.
