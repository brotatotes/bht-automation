</b>The clause<b> Sleep on now, &c.</b>, has been variously understood. To take it interrogatively (<i> “are ye sleeping”&c.?</i>), does not improve the sense, and makes an unnatural break in the sentence, which proceeds indicatively afterwards. It seems to me that there can be but two ways of interpreting it—and both with an imperative construction. (1) Either it was said<i> bona fide</i>,— “Since ye are not able to watch with Me, now ye may sleep on—for my hour is come, and I am about to be taken from you’—which sense however is luded by the “<i>Rise, let us be going</i>” below: or (2) it was said with an understanding of ‘<i>if you can</i>,’ as Bengel; if you hear not Me arousing you, there will speedily come others who<i> will</i> arouse you. “Meanwhile, sleep, if ye will.”<br><br><b> behold, the hour is at hand]</b> “<i>it is enough, the hour is come,</i>” Mark. ‘<i>It is enough</i>’—enough of reproof to them for drowsiness—enough of exhortations to watch and pray—that was now coming which would cut all this short. This<i> first</i><b> behold</b> is hardly to be taken literally of the<i> appearance</i> a Judas and his band; it merely announces the approach of<i> the hour</i>, of which the Lord had so often spoken: but at the utterance of the<i> second</i>, it seems that they were<i> in sight</i>, and that may be taken literally.<br><br> This expression,<i> into the hands of</i><b> sinners</b>, should be noticed, as an echo of the Redeemer’s anguish—it was the contact with<i> sin</i>,—and death, the wages of<i> sin</i>,—which all through His trial pressed heavily on His soul.
