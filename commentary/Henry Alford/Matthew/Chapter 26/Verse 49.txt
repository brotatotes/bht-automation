<b> 49.]</b><b> forthwith</b>—see above on ver. 47. The<i> purpose</i> of the kiss, supposing it to have taken place<i> after</i> John vv. 4–8, (and it is surely out of the question to suppose it to have taken place before, contrary to the plain meaning of John ver. 4,) has been doubted. Yet I think on a review of what had happened, it is very intelligible—not perhaps as some have supposed, to shew that Jesus could be approached with safety—but at all events as the<i> sign agreed on</i> with the Roman soldiers, who probably did not personally know Him, and who besides would have had their orders from the city, to take Him whom Judas should kiss. Thus the kiss would be necessary in the course of their military duty, as their authorization,—notwithstanding the previous declaration by Jesus of Himself. The word in the original implies, ‘<b>kissed</b><b> him eagerly</b>,’ with ostentation, as a studied and prearranged sign.
