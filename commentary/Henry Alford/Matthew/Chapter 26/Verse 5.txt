Not during the feast]</b> This expression must be taken as meaning the whole period of the feastâ€”the seven days. On the<i> feast-day</i> (A. V.), i.e. the day on which the passover was sacrificed, they could not lay hold of and slay any one, as it was a day of sabbatical obligation (Exod. xii. 16). See note on ver. 17.
