 50. ] In Luke we have Ἰούδα , φιλήματι τὸν υἱὸν τ . ἀνθ . παραδίδως , which sense is involved in the text also: that variation shewing perhaps that one of the accounts is not from an eye-witness.

	 ἐφ  ʼ   ὃ πάρει can hardly be a question. No such use of the simple relative ὅς has ever been adduced: “pronomen ὅς pro interrogativo τίς usurpari, falsa est Hoogeveeni opinio, ad Viger. Matthew 26:14 , alienissimo Demosthenis loco (p. 779) abutentis.” Lobeck on Phryn. p. 57 note. It therefore must be either an exclamation, as Fritzsche, “ad qualem rem perpetrandam ades!” which would be equally alien from the usage of ὅς , exclamations of this sort in Greek being expressed in an interrogative form: or an aposiopesis; as Euthym [175] , δι ʼ ὃ παραγέγονας , ἤγουν τὸ κατὰ σκοπὸν πράττε , τοῦ προσχήματος ἀφιέμενος . And to this I should incline. “Friend, there needs not this shew of attachment: I know thine errand, hoc age.” But the command itself is suppressed. See Meyer’s note, who also takes this view. On any understanding of the words, it is an appeal to the conscience and heart of Judas, in which sense (see above) it agrees with the words spoken in Luke: see note there. The fact that at this period our Lord was laid hold of and secured (by hand not yet  bound ) by the band, is important, as interpreting Luke’s account further on.
