 50.] In Luke we have “<i>Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</i>”—which sense is involved in the text also: that variation shewing perhaps that one of the accounts is not an eye-witness.<br><br><b> Friend</b>—see ch. xxii. 12 and note. It is more than doubtful whether the words that follow can properly be rendered as a<i> question</i>. More likely do they mean, “Friend, there needs not this shew of attachment: I know thine errand,—do thy purpose.” But the command itself is suppressed. On any understanding of the words, it is an appeal to the conscience and heart of Judas, in which sense (see above) it agrees with the words spoken in Luke:—see note there. The fact that at this period our Lord was laid hold of and secured (by hand—not yet<i> bound</i>) by the band, is important, as interpreting St. Luke’s account farther on.
