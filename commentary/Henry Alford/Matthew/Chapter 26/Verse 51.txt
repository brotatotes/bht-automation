<b> 51.]</b> The<b> one of them... was</b><i> Peter</i>;—John ver. 10. Why he was not mentioned, is idle to enquire: one supposition only must be avoided—that there is any<i> purpose</i> in the omission. It is absurd to suppose that the mention of his name in a book current only among Christians, many years after the fact, could lead to his apprehension, which did not take place<i> at the time</i>, although he was recognized as the striker in the palace of the High Priest, John ver. 26. The real reason of the non-apprehension was that the servant was<i> healed</i> by the Lord.<br><br> This is the first opposition to ‘Thy will be done.’ St. Luke expresses it, that they<i> saw what would happen</i>—and asked, ‘Lord, shall we smite with the sword?’ Then, while the other (for there were but two swords in the company) was waiting for the reply, the rash Peter, in the very spirit of ch. xvi. 22, smote with the sword—the weapon of the flesh:—an outbreak of the natural man no less noticeable than that more-noticed one which followed before morning.<br><br> All four Evangelists agree in this account. Luke and John are most exact—the latter giving the name of the slave,—Malchus.<br><br> The aim was a deadly one, and Peter narrowly escaped being one “w<i> ho had committed murder in the insurrection</i>.” From Luke, ver. 51, we learn that our Lord said “<i>Suffer</i><i> ye thus far</i>” (on the meaning of which see note there), touched the ear, and healed it.<br><br><b> 52.) thy sword</b>—not<i> mine</i>, nor on my side.<br><br><b> his place</b> = “<i>the sheath</i>,” John. The sheath is<i> the place for the Christian’s sword</i>— “a sword out of its sheath is not in its place, unless as ministering to the divine anger,” Bengel; see note on Luke xxii. 36. Our Lord does not say ‘<i>Cast away</i> thy sword;’ only in His willing self-sacrifice, and in that kingdom which is to be evolved from his work of redemption, is the sword altogether out of place.<br><br><b> for all&c.]</b> Peculiar to Matthew. There is no allusion, as Grotius and some of the ancients thought, to the Jews perishing by the Roman sword: for the very persons who were now taking Him<i> were Romans</i>. The saying is<i> general</i>—and the stress is on<b> take</b>—it was this that Peter was doing— ‘taking up the sword’ of his own will; taking that vengeance which belongs to God, into his own hand.<br><br><b> shall perish with the sword</b> is a command; not merely a future, but an<i> imperative</i> future; a repetition by the Lord in this solemn moment of Gen. ix. 6. This should be thought of by those well-meaning but shallow persons, who seek to abolish the punishment of death in Christian states.<br><br> John adds the words “<i>the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</i>” on which see notes there.<br><br><b> 53, 54</b> are peculiar to Matthew.
