 51. ] The  εἷς (or εἷς τις of Luke) was  Peter ; John 18:10 . Why he was not mentioned, is idle to enquire: one supposition only must be avoided that there is any  purpose in the omission. It is absurd to suppose that the mention of his name in a book current only among Christians, many years after the fact, could lead to his apprehension, which did not take place  at the time , although he was recognized as the striker in the palace of the High-priest, John 18:26 . The real reason of the non-apprehension was, that the servant was  healed by the Lord.
	This is the first opposition to ‘Thy will be done.’ Luke expresses it, that they  saw what would happen and asked, ‘Lord, shall we smite with the sword?’ Then, while the other (for there were but two swords in the company) was waiting for the reply, the rash Peter, in the very spirit of ch. Matthew 16:22 , smote with the sword the weapon of the flesh: an outbreak of the natural man no less noticeable than that more-noticed one which followed before morning. All four Evangelists agree in this account. Luke and John are most exact the latter giving the name of the slave, Malchus.
	The aim was a deadly one, and Peter narrowly escaped being one ὅστις ἐν τῇ στάσει φόνον πεποιήκει . From Luke 22:51 , we learn that our Lord said ἐᾶτε ἕως τούτου (on the meaning of which see note there), touched the ear and healed it.
