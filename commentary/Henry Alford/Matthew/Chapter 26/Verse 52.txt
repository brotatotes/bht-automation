	 τὸν τόπον αὐτῆς = τὴν θήκην John. The sheath is  the place for the Christian’s sword ‘gladius extra vaginam non est in loco suo, nisi ubi subservit iræ divinæ,’ Bengel: see note on Luke 22:36 . Our Lord does not say ‘  Cast away thy sword;’ only in His willing self-sacrifice, and in that kingdom which is to be evolved from his work of redemption, is the sword altogether out of place.
	 πάντες γὰρ κ.τ.λ. ] Peculiar to Matthew. There is no allusion, as Grotius and some of the ancients thought, to the Jews perishing by the Roman sword (‘crudeles istos et sanguinarios, etiam to quiescente, gravissimas Deo daturos pœnas suo sanguine,’ Grot., Euthym [176] ): for the very persons who were now taking Him  were Romans . The saying is  general and the stress is on  λαβόντες it was this that Peter was doing ‘taking up the sword’ of his own will; taking that vengeance which belongs to God, into his own hand.

	 ἐν μαχαίρῃ ἀπολ  . is a command; not merely a future, but an  imperative future; a repetition by the Lord in this solemn moment of Genesis 9:6 . This should be thought of by those well-meaning but shallow persons, who seek to abolish the punishment of death in Christian states.
	John adds the words τὸ ποτήριον ὃ δέδωκέν μοι ὁ πατήρ , οὐ μὴ πίω αὐτό ; on which see notes there.  53, 54 are peculiar to Matthew.
