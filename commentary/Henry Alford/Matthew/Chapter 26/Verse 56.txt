<b> 56.]</b> It is doubted whether these words are a continuation of our Lord’s speech, or a remark inserted by St. Matthew. The use of “<i>all this was</i> (<i>is</i>)<i> done</i>” in this Gospel would lead us to the latter conclusion: but when we reflect that thus our Lord’s speech would lose all its completeness, and that St. Mark gives in different words the speech going on to this same purport, we must I think decide for the other view. Besides, if the remark were St. Matthew’s, we should expect some particular citation, as is elsewhere his practice: see ch. i. 22; xxi 4. Mark gives it elliptically, “<i>but</i> (so literally)<i> that the scriptures might be fulfilled</i>.” The Passion and Death of Christ were especially the fulflment of the Scriptures. In this they all found their central point. Compare his dying words on the Cross,—<i>It is finished</i>,—with thie his assertion. On the addition in Luke, see note there.
