<b> 57. Caiaphas the high priest]</b> He was<i> High Priest of that year</i>, Annas having been deposed, and since then the High Priests having been frequently changed by the Roman governors.<br><br><b> where the scribes...]</b> Probably they had assembled by a preconcerted design, expecting their prisoner. This was<i> a</i> meeting of the Sanhedrim, but not the regular assembly, which condemned him and handed Him over to Pilate. That took place<i> in the morning</i>, Luke xxii. 66–71 (where see note).<br><br> We have not here the more complete detail of John xviii. 15–19. The<b> palace</b> is one and the same great building, in which both Annas and Caiaphas lived. This is evident from a comparison of the narratives of Peter’s denial: see below. The circumstance of a fire being lighted and the servants sitting round it, mentioned by the other three Evangelists, is here omitted.
