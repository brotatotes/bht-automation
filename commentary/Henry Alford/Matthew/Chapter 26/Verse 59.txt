<b> 59. false witness]</b> “As they thought, evidence, but in reality, false witness,” Euthymius. But is this quite implied? Is it not the intention of the Evangelist to represent that they<i> sought false witness</i>, not that they would not take true if they could get it, but that<i> they knew it was not to be had?</i>
