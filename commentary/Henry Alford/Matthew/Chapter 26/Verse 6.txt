<b> 6. Simon the leper]</b> Not at this time a leper, or he could not be at his house receiving guests. It is at least<i> possible</i>, that he may have been healed by our Lord. Who he was, is wholly uncertain. From Martha serving (John xii. 2), it would appear as if she were at home in the house (Luke x. 88 sqq.); and that Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat need not necessarily imply that he was a<i> guest</i> properly so called. He had been probably (see John xii. 9) absent with Jesus at Ephraim, and on this account, and naturally for other reasons, would be an object of interest, and one of the sitters at table.
