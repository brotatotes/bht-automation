 65. ] In Leviticus 21:10 (see also Lev 10:6 ) the High-priest is ordered  not to rend his clothes ; but that appears to apply only to  mourning for the dead . In 1Ma 11:71 , and in Josephus, B. J. ii. 15. 4, we have instances of High-priests rending their clothes. On rending the clothes at hearing blasphemy, see 2 Kings 18:37 .
