<p><strong> 65.</strong> ] In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+21:10">Leviticus 21:10</span> (see also Lev 10:6 ) the High-priest is ordered <em> not to rend his clothes</em> ; but that appears to apply only to <em> mourning for the dead</em> . In 1Ma 11:71 , and in Josephus, B. J. ii. 15. 4, we have instances of High-priests rending their clothes. On rending the clothes at hearing blasphemy, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+18:37">2 Kings 18:37</span> .</p>
