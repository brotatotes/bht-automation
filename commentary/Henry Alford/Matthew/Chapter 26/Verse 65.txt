<b> 65.]</b> In Levit. xxi. 10 (see also Levit. x. 6) the High Priest is ordered<i> not to rend his clothes;</i> but that appears to apply only to<i> mourning or the dead.</i> In 1 Macc. xi. 71, and in Josephus, B.J. ii. 15. 4, we have instances of High Priests rending their clothes. On rending the clothes at hearing blasphemy, see 2 Kings xviii. 37.
