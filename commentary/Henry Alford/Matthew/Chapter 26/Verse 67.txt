<b> 67.]</b> Luke gives these indignities, and in the same place as here, adding, what indeed might have been suspected that it was not the members of the Sanhedrim, but<i> the men who held Jesus in custody</i>, who inflicted them on Him.<br><br> The word rendered<i> buffeted</i> means<i> to strike with the fist</i>.<br><br> The following verb (<b>smote</b><i> him</i>) is, generally,<i> to strike a flat blow with the back of the hand</i>—but also, and probably here, since another set of persons are described as doing it,<i> to strike with a staff.</i><br><br><br><br> On this table I would make the following remarks:—that<i> generally</i>,— (1) supposing the four accounts to be<i> entirely independent of one another</i>,—we are<i> not</i><i> bound to require accordance</i>, nor would there in all probability be any such accordance,<i> in the recognitions of Peter by different persons</i>. These may have been<i> many</i> on<i> each occasion</i> of denial, and independent narrators may have fixed on different ones among them. (2)<i> No reader</i>, who is not slavishly bound to the inspiration of the<i> letter, will require that the actual words spoken by Peter should in each case be identically reported</i>. See the admirable remarks of Augustine, cited on ch. viii. 25: and remember, that the<i> substantive fact of a denial</i> remains the same, whether<i> I know not what thou sayest,</i><i> I know him not,</i> or<i> I am not</i>, are reported to have been Peter’s answer. (3) I do not see that we are obliged to limit the narrative to<i> three sentences</i> from Peter's mouth, each expressing a denial,<i> and no more</i>. On<i> three occasions</i> during the night he was recognized,—on<i> three occasions he was a denier</i> of his Lord: such a statement may well embrace<i> reiterated</i><i> expressions of recognition</i>, and<i> reiterated</i> and<i> importunate denials,</i> on<i> each</i> occasion. And these remarks being taken into account, I premise that all difficulty is removed from the synopsis above given: the only resulting inferences being, (a)<i> that the narratives are genuine truthful accounts of facts underlying them all:</i> and (b)<i> that they are, and must be, absolutely and entirely independent of one another.</i><br><br> For (1) the four accounts of the FIRST denial are remarkably coincident. In<i> all four</i>, Peter was in the outer hall, where the fire was made (see on ver. 69):<i> a maid servant</i> (Mt. Mk. L.),—<i>the maid servant who kept the door</i> (John) taxed him (in<i> differing words in each</i>, the comparison of which is very instructive) with being a disciple of Jesus: in all four he denies, again in differing words. I should be disposed to think this first recognition to have been<i> but one</i>, and the variations to be owing to the independence of the report. (2) In the narratives of the SECOND denial of our first preliminary remark is well exemplified. The same maid (Mk. possibly: but not necessarily—perhaps, the<i> maiden</i> in the<i> vestibule</i> or<i> porch</i>) other<i> maid</i> (Mt.),<i> another</i> (<i>male</i>)<i> servant</i> (Luke), the<i> standers-by generally</i> (John), charged him: again, in differing words. It seems he had retreated from the fire as if going to depart altogether (see note, ver. 69), and so attracted the attention both of the group at the fire and of the porteress. It would appear to me that for some reason, John was not so precisely informed of the details of this as of the other denials. The “<i>going out</i>” (Mt. Mk.) is a super-added detail, of which the “<i>standing and warming himself</i>” (John) does not seem to be possessed. (3) On the THIRD occasion,<i> the standers-by recognize him as a Galilean</i> (<i>simply</i>, Mk. [txt.], Luke:<i> by his dialect</i>, Mt., an interesting additional particular),—and<i> a kinsman of Malchus</i> crowns the charge by<i> identifying</i> him in a way which might have proved most perilous, had not Peter immediately withdrawn. This third time again, his denials are differently reported:—but here, which is most interesting, we have in Matt.’ s and Mark’s “<i>he began to curse and to swear</i>” a very plain intimation, that he spoke<i> not one sentence only</i>, but a<i> succession of vehement denials.</i><br><br> It will be seen, that for fair comment on the fourfold testimony, we must not commit the mistake of requiring the recognitions, and the recognizers, in each case, to have been identical in the four. Had they been thus identical, in a case of this kind, the four accounts<i> must have sprung from a common source</i>, or have been<i> corrected to one another:</i> whereas their present varieties and coincidences are most valuable as indications of<i> truthful independence</i>. What I wish to impress on the minds of my readers is, that in narratives which have sprung from such truthful independent accounts, they must be prepared sometimes (as e.g. in the details of the day of the Resurrection) for discrepancies which,<i> at our distance, we cannot satisfactorily arrange:</i> now and then we may, as in<i> this</i> instance, be able to do so with something like verisimilitude:—in some cases,<i> not at all</i>. But whether we can thus arrange them or not, being thoroughly persuaded of the holy truthfulness of the Evangelists, and of the divine guidance under which they wrote, our faith is in no way shaken by such discrepancies. We value them rather, as testimonies to independence: and are sure, that if for one moment we could be put in<i> complete possession</i><i> of all the details as they happened,</i> each account would find its justification, and the reasons of all the variations would appear. And this I firmly believe will one day be the case. (See the narrative of Peter’s denials ably treated in an article in the “Christian Observer” for Feb. 1853.)
