<b> 69.]</b> “An oriental house is usually built round a quadrangular interior court; into which there is a passage (sometimes arched) through the front part of the house, closed next the street by a heavy folding gate, with a small wicket for single persons, kept by a porter. In the text, the interior court, often paved or flagged, and open to the sky, is the ‘<i>hall</i>,’ where the attendants made a fire; and the passage beneath the front of the house from the street to this court, is the<i> pro-aulion</i> (<i> ‘porch</i>,’ Mark xiv. 68), or<i> pylon</i> (<i> ‘porch</i>,’ ver. 71). The place where Jesus stood before the High Priest may have been an open room or place of audience on the ground floor, in the rear or on one side of the court; such rooms open in front, being customary.” Robinson.
