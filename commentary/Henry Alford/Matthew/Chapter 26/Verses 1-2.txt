The public office of our Lord as a  Teacher having been now fulfilled, His  priestly office begins to be entered upon. He had not completed  all his discourses, for He delivered, after this, those contained in John 14:1-31 ; John 15:1-27 ; John 16:1-33 ; Joh 17:1-26 but  not in public ; only to the inner circle of his disciples. From this point commences THE NARRATIVE OF HIS PASSION.
