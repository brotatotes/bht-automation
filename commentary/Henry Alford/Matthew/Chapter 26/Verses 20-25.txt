 20 25. ] JESUS, CELEBRATING THE PASSOVER, ANNOUNCES HIS BETRAYER. Mark 14:17-21 . Joh 13:21 ff. Our Lord and the twelve were a full Paschal company;  ten persons was the ordinary and minimum number. Here come in (1)  the expression of our Lord’s desire to eat this Passover before His suffering , Luke 22:15-16 ; (2)  the division of this first cup , ib. Luke 22:17 , Mat 18:3 )  the washing of the disciples’ feet , John 13:1-20 (? see note, Joh 13:22 ). I mention these, not that I have any desire to reduce the four accounts to a harmonized narrative, for that I believe to be impossible, and the attempt wholly unprofitable; but because they are  additional circumstances, placed by their narrators at this period of the feast. I shall similarly notice all such additional matter, but without any idea of harmonizing the apparent discrepancies of the four (as appears to me) entirely distinct and independent reports.
