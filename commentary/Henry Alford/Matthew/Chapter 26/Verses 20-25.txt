<p><strong> 20 25.</strong> ] JESUS, CELEBRATING THE PASSOVER, ANNOUNCES HIS BETRAYER. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:17-21">Mark 14:17-21</span> . Joh 13:21 ff. Our Lord and the twelve were a full Paschal company; <em> ten</em> persons was the ordinary and minimum number. Here come in (1) <em> the expression of our Lord’s desire to eat this Passover before His suffering</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:15-16">Luke 22:15-16</span> ; (2) <em> the division of this first cup</em> , ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:17">Luke 22:17</span> , Mat 18:3 ) <em> the washing of the disciples’ feet</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:1-20">John 13:1-20</span> (? see note, Joh 13:22 ). I mention these, not that I have any desire to reduce the four accounts to a harmonized narrative, for that I believe to be impossible, and the attempt wholly unprofitable; but because they are <em> additional</em> circumstances, placed by their narrators at this period of the feast. I shall similarly notice all such additional matter, but without any idea of harmonizing the apparent discrepancies of the four (as appears to me) entirely distinct and independent reports.</p>
