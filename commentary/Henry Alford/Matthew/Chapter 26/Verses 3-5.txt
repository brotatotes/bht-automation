 3 5. ] CONSPIRACY OF THE JEWISH AUTHORITIES. Mark 14:1 .Luke 22:2; Luke 22:2 . This assembling has no connexion with what has just been related, but follows rather on the end of ch. 23.
	ὁ λεγόμενος Κ . is in Jos. Antt. xviii. 2. 2, Ἰώσηπος ὁ καὶ Καϊάφας . Valerius Gratus, Procurator of Judæa, had appointed him instead of Simon ben Kamith. He continued through the procuratorship of Pontius Pilate, and was displaced by the proconsul Vitellius, A.D. 37. See note on Luke 3:2 , and chronological table in Prolegg. to Acts, Vol. II.
	 τοῦ λεγ  . does not mean ‘surnamed,’ but (see Mat 26:14 ) implies that  some name is to follow, which is more than, or different from, the real one of the person.
	 μὴ ἐν τ  .   ἑ  . ] This expression must be taken as meaning the whole period of the feast the seven days. On the  feast-day , i.e. the day on which the Passover was sacrificed (E. V.), they could not lay hold of and slay any one, as it was a day of sabbatical obligation ( Exo 12:16 ). See note on Matthew 26:17 .
