 36 46. ] OUR LORD’S AGONY AT GETHSEMANE. Mark 14:32-42 .Luke 22:39-46; Luke 22:39-46 . John 18:1 . The account of the temptation, and of the agony in Gethsemane is peculiar to the three first Evangelists. But it does not therefore follow that there is, in their narratives, any inconsistency with St. John’s setting forth of the Person of Christ. For it must be remembered, that, as we find in  their accounts frequent manifestations of the  divine nature , and indications of  future glory , about, and during this conflict, so in St. John’s account, which brings out more the divine side of our Lord’s working and speaking, we find frequent allusions to his  human weakness and  distress of spirit . For examples of the first, see Matthew 26:13 ; Matthew 26:24 ; Matthew 26:29 ; Matthew 26:32 ; Matthew 26:53 , and [171] in Mark and Luke; and Luke 22:30 ; Luke 22:32 ; Luke 22:37 ; Luke 22:43 ; of the latter, John 12:27 ; John 13:21 ; John 14:30 ; John 16:32 .
	 [171] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated  at the head of the note on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is  qualified , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &c., it is signified that the word occurs  in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others .
	The right understanding of the whole important narration must be acquired by bearing in mind the  reality of the manhood of our Lord, in all its abasement and weakness : by following out in Him the analogy which pervades the characteristics of human suffering the strength of the resolved spirit, and calm of the resigned will, continually broken in upon by the inward giving way of human feebleness, and limited power of endurance. But as in us, so in the Lord, these seasons of dread and conflict stir not the ruling  will , alter not the firm resolve. This is most manifest in His  first prayer εἰ δυνατόν ἐστιν ‘if consistent with that work which I have covenanted to do.’ Here is the reserve of the  will to suffer  it is never stirred (see below). The conflict however of the Lord differs from ours in this, that in  us , the ruling  will itself is  but a phase of our  human will, and may be and is often carried away by the excess of depression and suffering; whereas in  Him it was the  divine Personality in which the  higher Will of the covenant purpose was eternally fixed , struggling with the flesh now overwhelmed with an horrible dread, and striving to escape away (see the whole of Psa 55:1-23 ). Besides that, by that uplifting into a superhuman circle of  Knowledge , with which the indwelling of the Godhead endowed his humanity, his flesh, with all its capacities and apprehensions, was brought  at once into immediate and simultaneous contact with every circumstance of horror and pain that awaited Him ( Joh 18:4 ), which is never the case with us. Not only are the objects of dread  gradually unveiled to our minds, but  hope ( ἐλπὶς κινδύνῳ παραμύθιον οὖσα , Thuc. ver. 103) is ever suggesting that things may not be so bad as our fears represent them.
	Then we must not forget, that as the  flesh gave way under dread of suffering, so the  human ψυχή was troubled with all the attendant circumstances of that suffering betrayal, desertion, shame (see Psa 55:1-23 again, Psalms 55:20-21; Psalms 55:20-21 ; Psalms 38:11-12 ; Psalms 88:0 alli [172] .). Nor again must we pass over the last and deepest mystery of the Passion the consideration, that upon the holy and innocent Lamb of God rested the burden of  all human sin that to Him, death, as the punishment of  sin , bore a dark and dreadful meaning, inconceivable by any of us, whose inner will is tainted by the  love of Sin. See on this part of the Redeemer’s agony, Psalms 40:12 ; Psalms 38:1-10 a [173] .

	The three accounts do not differ in any important particulars. Luke merely gives a general summary of the Lord’s prayers and his sayings to the disciples, but inserts (see below) two details not found in the others. Mark’s account and Matthew’s are very nearly related, and have evidently sprung from the same source.
