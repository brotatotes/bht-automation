<p><strong> 45, 46.</strong> ] The clause <strong> καθεύδετε λ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀναπ</strong> <strong> .</strong> has been variously understood. To take it interrogatively does not improve the sense, and makes an unnatural break in the sentence, which proceeds indicatively afterwards. It seems to me that there can be but two ways of interpreting it and both with an imperative construction. (1) Either it was said <em> bonafide</em> , ‘since ye are not able to watch with Me, now ye may sleep on for my hour is come, and I am about to be taken from you’ which sense however is precluded by the ἐγείρεσθε ἄγωμεν below: or (2) it was said with an understanding of ‘ <em> if you can</em> ’ as Bengel; ‘si me excitantem non auditis, brevi aderunt alii qui vos excitent. Interea dormite, si vacat.’ (Only let us beware of the so-called “deeper sense,” suggested by Wordsw. here, “Now you may hope for sleep and rest (? cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:37">Mark 13:37</span> ; 1Th 5:6-7 ), for I am about to die.”)

<p><strong> ἰδοὺ ἤγγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> = ἀπέχει · ἦλθεν Mark. The ἀπέχει implies, ‘ <em> It is enough</em> ’ enough of reproof to them for drowsiness enough of exhortations to watch and pray that was now coming which would cut all this short. This <em> first</em> ἰδού is hardly to be taken literally of the <em> appearance</em> of Judas and his band; it merely announces the approach of <em> the hour</em> , of which the Lord had so often spoken: but at the utterance of the <em> second</em> , it seems that they were <em> in sight</em> , and that may be taken literally.

<p>This expression, παραδ . εἰς χεῖρας <strong> ἁμαρτωλῶν</strong> , should be noticed, as an echo of the Redeemer’s anguish it was the contact with <em> sin</em> , and death, the wages of <em> sin</em> , which all through His trial pressed heavily on His soul.</p>
