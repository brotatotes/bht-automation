<p><strong> 47 56.</strong> ] BETRAYAL AND APPREHENSION OF JESUS. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:43-52">Mark 14:43-52</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:47-53">Luke 22:47-53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:2-11">3 John 1:2-11</span><span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:2-11">3 John 1:2-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:2-11">3 John 1:2-11</span> . Mark’s account has evidently been derived from the same source originally as Matthew’s, but both had gained some important additions before they were finally committed to writing. Luke’s is, as before, an abridged narrative, but abounding with new circumstances not related by the others. John’s account is at first sight very dissimilar from either: see text above cited, and notes there. It may suffice now to say, that all which <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:1-54">John 4:1-54</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:1-47">John 5:1-47</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:1-71">John 6:1-71</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:1-53">John 7:1-53</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:1-59">John 8:1-59</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:1-41">John 9:1-41</span> , relates, must have happened <em> on the first approach of the band</em> and is connected with our ἐγείρεσθε ἄγωμεν . Some particulars also must have happened, which are omitted by <em> all</em> : viz. the rejoining of the eight Apostles ( <em> not</em> alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:46">Luke 22:46</span> , as Greswell supposes), and the preparing <em> them</em> for what was about to take place. On the other hand, John gives a hint that something had been passing <em> in</em> the garden, by his word ἐξῆλθεν , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:4">Matthew 26:4</span> . The two first Evangelists were evidently unaware of any such matter as that related by John, for they (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:49">Matthew 26:49</span> ; Mar 14:45 ) introduce <em> the Kiss</em> by an <strong> εὐθέως</strong> <strong> .</strong></p>
