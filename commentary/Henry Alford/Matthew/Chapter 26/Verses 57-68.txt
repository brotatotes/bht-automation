 57 68. ] HEARING BEFORE CAIAPHAS. Mark 14:53-65 . (Luke 22:54 ; Luke 22:63-65 .) John 18:24 . Previous to this took place a hearing  before Annas, the  real High-priest (see note on Luk 3:2 ), to whom the Jews took Jesus first; who enquired of Him about his disciples and his teaching ( Joh 18:19-23 ), and then ( Joh 18:24 ) sent Him bound to Caiaphas. Only John,  who followed , relates this first hearing. See notes on John 18:12-24 , where this view is maintained. It may be sufficient here just to indicate the essential differences between  that hearing and  this . On that occasion no witnesses were required, for it was merely a private unofficial audience. Then the High-priest questioned and our Lord replied: whereas now, under false witness and reproach, He (as before Herod) is silent.
