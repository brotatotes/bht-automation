<p><strong> 6 13.</strong> ] THE ANOINTING AT BETHANY. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:3-9">Mark 14:3-9</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1-8">John 12:1-8</span> . On <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:36-50">Luke 7:36-50</span> , see note there. This history of the anointing of our Lord is here inserted <em> out of its place</em> . It occurred <em> six days before the Passover</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span> . It perhaps can hardly be said that in its position <em> here</em> , it accounts in any degree for the subsequent application of Judas to the Sanhedrim ( Mat 26:14-16 ), since his name is not even mentioned in it: but I can hardly doubt that it originally was placed where it here stands by those who were aware of its connexion with that application. The paragraphs in the beginning of this chapter come in regular sequence, thus: Jesus announces his approaching Passion: the chief priests, &amp;c. meet and plot His capture, but <em> not during</em> the feast: <em> but when Jesus was in Bethany</em> , &amp;c. occasion was given for an offer to be made to them, which led to its being effected, after all, during the feast. On the rebuke given to Judas at this time having led to his putting into effect his intention of betraying our Lord, see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:4">John 12:4</span> . The trace of what I believe to have been the original reason of the anointing being inserted in this place, is still further lost in Mark, who instead of τοῦ δὲ Ἰησ . γενομένου .… has καὶ ὄντος αὐτοῦ .… just as if the narrative were continued, and at the end instead of our τότε πορευθείς .… has καὶ ὁ Ἰούδας .… as if there were no connexion between the two. It certainly cannot be said of St. Matthew (De Wette, Neander, Stier) that he relates the anointing as <em> taking place two days before the Passover</em> : of St. Mark it <em> may</em> be said.

<p>It may be observed that St. Luke relates nothing of our Lord’s visits to Bethany.</p>
