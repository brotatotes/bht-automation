<b> 19.</b>] The<b> judgment seat</b> was in a place called in Hebrew Gabbatha, the Pavement—John xix. 13, where however Pilate is not related to have gone thither, till<i> after</i> the scourging and mocking of the soldiers, But he may have sat there when he came out in some of his previous interviews with the Jews.<br><br><b> his wife</b>] It had become the custom in Augustus’s time for the governors of Provinces to take their wives with them abroad; under Tiberius, Cæcina attempted to<b> pass a law</b> forbidding it, but<b> was</b> vehemently opposed (by Drusus among others) and put down. We know nothing more of this woman than is here related. Tradition gives her the name of Procla, or Claudia Procula. In the apocryphal gospel of Nicodemus, c. 2, we read that Pilate called the Jews and said to them,<i> “Ye know how that my wife is a worshipper of God, and is rather of your religion than mine. They say unto him, Yea, we know it.”</i><br><br><b> that just man</b> is a term which shews that she knew the character for purity and sanctity which Jesus had. In the gospel of Nicodemus, the Jews are made to reply, “<i>Did we not tell thee that he is a magician? behold, he hath sent a dream-token to thy wife.”</i>
