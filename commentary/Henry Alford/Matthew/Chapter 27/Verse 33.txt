 33. ]  Γολγοθᾶ  , in Chaldee גֻּלְגָּלתָא , in Hebrew גֻּלְגּלֶת , a skull: the name is by Jerome, and generally, explained from its being the usual place of executions and  abounding with skulls not however  unburied , which was not allowed. This last consideration raises an objection to the explanation, and as the name does not import κρανί  ων τόπος , but κρανί  ου τ . or simply  κρανίον (Luke), many, among whom are Reland, Paulus, Lücke, De Wette, Meyer, &c., understand it as applying to the  shape of the hill or rock. But neither does this seem satisfactory, as we have no analogy to guide us (Meyer’s justification of the name from κράνιον , or κρανεῖον , a wood near Corinth, does not apply: for that is so called from κράνον , the  cornel tree De Wette), and no such hill or rock is known to have existed.
	As regards the  situation , we await some evidence which may decide between the conflicting claims of the commonly-received site of Calvary and the Holy Sepulchre, and that upheld by Mr. Ferguson, who holds that the Dome of the Rock, usually known as the Mosque of Omar, is in reality the spot of our Lord’s entombment.
