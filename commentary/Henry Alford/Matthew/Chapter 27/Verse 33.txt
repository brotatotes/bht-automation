<b> 33.</b>]<b> Golgotha,</b> a skull: the name is by Jerome, and generally, explained from its being the usual place of executions, and<i> abounding with skulls—</i>not however<i> unburied,</i> which was not allowed. This last consideration raises an objection to the explanation,—and as the name does not import a<i> place</i> of<b> skulls,</b> but a<i> place of</i> a skull or simply<b> a skull</b> (Luke), many understand it as applying to the<i> shape</i> of the hill or rock. But neither does this seem satisfactory, as we have no analogy to guide us, and no such hill or rock is known to have existed. As regards the<i> situation,</i> we await some evidence which may decide between the conflicting claims of the commonly-received site of Calvary and the Holy Sepulchre, and that upheld by Mr. Ferguson, who holds that the Dome of the Rock, usually known as the Mosque of Omar, is in reality the spot of our Lord’s entombment.
