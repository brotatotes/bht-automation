<b> 35. they crucified him</b>] The cross was an upright pale or beam, intersected by a transverse one at right angles, generally in the shape of a T. In this case, from the ‘title’ being placed<i> over the Head,</i> the upright beam probably projected above the horizontal one, as usually represented✝, To this cross, the criminal, being stripped of his clothes, was fixed by nails driven through the hands and (not always, nor perhaps generally, though certainly not seldom—see note at Luke xxiv. 39) through the feet, separate or united. The body was not<i> supported by</i> the nails, but by a piece of wood which passed between the legs. On the rest of the verse, see notes on John. The words omitted in the text as not found in<i> any of the ancient manuscripts,</i> are clearly interpolated from John, ver. 24, with just the phrase<i> which was spoken by the prophet</i> assimilated to St. Matthew's usual form of citation.
