<b> 37.</b>] St. Matthew finishes relating what the soldiers did, and then goes back to the course of the narrative. The ‘title’ appears to have been<i> written by Pilate</i> (see John, ver. 19) and sent to be affixed on the cross. It is not known whether the affixing of this title was customary. In Dio Cassius and others, we read of such a title being hung round the neck of a criminal on his way to execution. On the difference in the four Gospels as to the<i> words of the inscription itself,</i> it is hardly worth while to comment, except to remark, that the advocates for the verbal and literal exactness of each gospel may here find an<i> undoubled</i> example of the absurdity of their view, which may serve to guide them in less plain and obvious cases. (See this further noticed in the Introduction.)<i> A title was written, con-taining certain words;</i> not<i> four titles, all different,</i> but<i> one,</i> differing probably from all of these four, but certainly from three of them. Let us bear this in mind, when the narratives of words spoken, or events, differ in a similar manner. Respecting the title, see further on John, vv. 20–22.
