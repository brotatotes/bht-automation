 37. ]  ἐπέθ  . is not to be taken as a plusq. perf. Matthew finishes relating what the soldiers did, and then goes back to the course of the narrative. ‘The soldiers’ need not even be the nominative case to ἐπέθ . The ‘title’ appears to have been  written by Pilate (see Joh 19:19 ) and sent to be affixed on the cross. It is not known whether the affixing of this title was customary. In Dio Cassius (cited by Meyer, but incorrectly), we read of such a title being hung round the neck of a criminal on his way to execution. So also Suet. Domit. 10, “canibus objecit, cum hoc titulo, ‘Impie locutus parmularius:’ ” and Caligula 32, “præcedente titulo, qui caussam pœnæ indicaret.”
	On the difference in the four Gospels as to the  words of the inscription itself it is hardly worth while to comment, except to remark, that the advocates for the verbal and literal exactness of each Gospel may here find an  undoubted example of the absurdity of their view, which may serve to guide them in less plain and obvious cases. (See this further noticed in the Prolegg. ch. i. § vi. 18.)  A title was written, containing certain words ; not  four titles, all different , but  one , differing probably from all of these four, but certainly from three of them. Let us bear this in mind when the narratives of words spoken, or events, differ in a similar manner. Respecting the title, see further on John 18:20-22 .
