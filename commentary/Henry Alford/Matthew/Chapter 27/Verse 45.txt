<b> 45.</b>] According to Mark, ver. 25,<br><br> it was the<i> third hour</i> when they crucified Him. If so, He had been on the cross three hours, which in<i> April</i> would answer to about the same space of time in our day—i. e. from 9–12 A.M. On the difficulty presented by St. John’s declaration ch. xix. 14, see notes there and on Mark.<br><br><b> darkness</b>—this was no<i> eclipse of the sun,</i> for it was<i> full moon</i> at the time—nor any partial obscuration of the sun such as sometimes takes place before an earthquake—for it is clear that no<i> earthquake in the ordinary sense of the word</i> is here intended. Those whose belief leads them to reflect WHO was then suffering, will have no difficulty in accounting for these signs of sympathy in Nature, nor in seeing their applicability. The consent, in the same words, of all three Evangelists, must silence all question as to the universal belief of this darkness as a<i> fact;</i> and the early Fathers appeal to the testimony of profane authors for its truth. The omission of it in St. John’s Gospel is of no more weight than the numerous other instances of such omission. See Amos viii. 9, 10.<br><br><b> over all the earth</b>] The<i> same word</i> in the original is rendered<i> earth</i> in Luke, but<i> land</i> here and in Mark. This would seem to be pure caprice on the part of our translators; and might mislead. Whether these words are to be taken in all their strictness is doubtful. Of course, over the<i> whole globe</i> the darkness would not be supernatural—as it would be night<i> naturally over half of it.</i> The question is, are we to understand t<i> hat part of it over which there was day?</i> I believe<i> we are;</i> but see no strong objection to any limitation, provided<i> the fact itself,</i> as happening at Jerusalem, is<i> distinctly recognized.</i> This last is<i> matter of testimony,</i> and the three Evangelists are<i> pledged to its truth:</i> the present words hardly stand on the same ground, not being matter of<i> testimony</i> properly so called.
