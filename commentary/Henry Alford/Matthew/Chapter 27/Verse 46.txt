<b> 46.</b>] See Ps. xxii. 1, The words are Chaldee, and not Hebrew. Our Lord spoke them in the ordinary dialect, not in that of the sacred text itself. The weightiest question is,<i> In what sense did He use them?</i> His inner consciousness of union with God must have been complete and indestructible—but, like His higher and holy will, liable to be obscured by human weakness and pain, which at this time was at its very highest. We must however take care not to ascribe<i> all</i> his suffering to<i> bodily pain,</i> however cruel: his<i> soul was tn immediate contact with ‘and prospect of death—the wages of sin,</i> which He had<i> taken on Him, but never committed</i>—and the conflict at Gethsemane was renewed. ‘He himself,’ as the Berlenberg Bible remarks (Stier), ‘becomes the expositor of the darkness, and shews what it imports.’ In the words however,<i> ‘My God’</i>—there speaks the same union with the divine Will, and abiding in the everlasting covenant purpose, as in those, ‘Not my will, but thine.’
