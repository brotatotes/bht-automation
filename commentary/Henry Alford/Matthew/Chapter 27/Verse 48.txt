<b> 48.</b>] This was on account of the words<i> ‘I thirst,’</i> uttered by our Lord: see John, ver. 28. St. Mark’s account is somewhat different: there<i> the same person</i> gives the vinegar and utters the scoff which follows. This is quite intelligible—contempt mingied with pity would doubtless find a type among the bystanders. There is no need for assuming that the<i> soldiers offering vinegar</i> in Luke, ver. 37, is the same incident as this. Since then, the bodily state of the Redeemer had greatly changed: and what was then offered in mockery, might well be now asked for in the agony of death, and received when presented. I would not however absolutely deny that St. Luke<i> may</i> be giving a less precise detail; and may represent this incident by his ver. 37. The<b> vinegar</b> is the<i> posca,</i> sour wine, or vinegar and water, the ordinary drink of the Roman soldiers. On the other particulars, see notes on John.
