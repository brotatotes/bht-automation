<b> 50.</b>] It has been doubted whether<b> it is finished</b> of John (ver. 50), and<b> Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit</b> of Luke (ver. 46), are to be<i> identified with this crying out,</i> or to be taken as<i> distinct from it.</i> But a nearer examination of the case will set the doubt at rest. The<i> “delivered up”</i> of John (ib.)<i> implies the speech in Luke;</i> which accordingly was that uttered in this<i> loud voice.</i> “<i>It is finished”</i> was said before; see notes on John.
