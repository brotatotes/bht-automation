The whole transaction was<i> supernatural</i> and<i> symbolic:</i> no other interpretation of it will satisfy even ordinary common sense. Was the earthquake a<i> mere coincidence?</i> This not even those assert, who deny all symbolism in the matter. Was it a mere<i> sign of divine wrath</i> at what was done—a mere<i> prodigy,</i> like those at the death of Cæsar? Surely no Christian believer can think this. Then<i> what was it?</i> What but the<i> opening of the tombs</i>—the symbolic declaration, that<i> the Death</i> which bad happened had broken the bands of death for ever? These following clauses, which have no mythical nor apocryphal character, require this explanation to be fully understood. The graves were opened<i> at the moment of the death</i> of the Lord; but inasmuch as He is the firstfruits from the dead—<i>the</i> Resurrection and the Life—the bodies of the saints in them<i> did not arise till He rose,</i> and having appeared to many after his resurrection,—possibly during the forty days,—went up with Him into His glory. Moses and Elias, who were before in glory, were not<i> from the dead,</i> properly speaking: see note on ch. xvii. 1.
