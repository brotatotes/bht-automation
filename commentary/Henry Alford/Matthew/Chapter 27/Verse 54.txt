The circumstances of our vv. 51–53, except the rending of the veil, are not in the possession St. Mark, of the minute accuracy of whose account I have no doubt.<i> His</i> report is that of<i> one man—</i>and that man, more than probably, a<i> convert</i>. St. Matthew’s is of<i> many,</i> and represents their general impression. St. Luke’s is also<i> general.</i><br><br><b> those things that wero done</b> points to the crying out, as indeed does the “<i>so</i>” in Mark:—but see notes there.<br><br><b> was the Son of God</b>—which the Centurion had heard that<i> He gare Himself out for,</i> John xix. 7, and our ver.<br><br> 43. It cannot be doubtful, I think, that he used these words<i> in the Jewish sense—</i>and with some idea of that which they implied.

There must have been also<i> another group,</i> of His<i> disciples,</i> within sight;—e. g.
