<b> 54.</b>]<b> the earthquake and those that were done</b> is represented by<i> “that he so gave up the ghost,”</i> Mark. Does the latter of these look as if compiled from the former? The circumstances of our vv. 51–53, except the rending of the veil, are not in the possession St. Mark, of the minute accuracy of whose account I have no doubt.<i> His</i> report is that of<i> one man—</i>and that man, more than probably, a<i> convert</i>. St. Matthew’s is of<i> many,</i> and represents their general impression. St. Luke’s is also<i> general.</i>
