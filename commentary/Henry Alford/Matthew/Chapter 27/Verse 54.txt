 54. ]  τὸν σεισμὸν καὶ τὰ γιν  . = ὅτι οὕτως ἐξέπνευσεν Mark. Does the latter of these look as if compiled from the former? The circumstances of our Matthew 27:51-53 , except the rending of the veil, are not in the possession of Mark, of the minute accuracy of whose account I have no doubt.  His report is that of  one man and that man, more than probably, a  convert . Matthew’s is of  many , and represents their general impression. Luke’s is also  general .
	 τὰ γινόμενα points to the crying out, as indeed does the οὕτως in Mark: but see notes there.
	 υἱὸς θεοῦ ἦν which the Centurion had heard that  He gave Himself out for , John 19:7 , and our Matthew 27:43 . It cannot be doubtful, I think, that he used these words  in the Jewish sense and with some idea of that which they implied. When Meyer says that he must have used them in a heathen sense, meaning a  hero or demigod , we must first be shewn that υἱὸς θεοῦ was  ever so used . I believe Luke’s to be a different report: see notes there.
