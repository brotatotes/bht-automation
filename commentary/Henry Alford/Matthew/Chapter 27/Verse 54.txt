<p><strong> 54.</strong> ] <strong> τὸν σεισμὸν καὶ τὰ γιν</strong> <strong> .</strong> = ὅτι οὕτως ἐξέπνευσεν Mark. Does the latter of these look as if compiled from the former? The circumstances of our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:51-53">Matthew 27:51-53</span> , except the rending of the veil, are not in the possession of Mark, of the minute accuracy of whose account I have no doubt. <em> His</em> report is that of <em> one man</em> and that man, more than probably, a <em> convert</em> . Matthew’s is of <em> many</em> , and represents their general impression. Luke’s is also <em> general</em> .

<p><strong> τὰ γινόμενα</strong> points to the crying out, as indeed does the οὕτως in Mark: but see notes there.

<p><strong> υἱὸς θεοῦ ἦν</strong> which the Centurion had heard that <em> He gave Himself out for</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:7">John 19:7</span> , and our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:43">Matthew 27:43</span> . It cannot be doubtful, I think, that he used these words <em> in the Jewish sense</em> and with some idea of that which they implied. When Meyer says that he must have used them in a heathen sense, meaning a <em> hero or demigod</em> , we must first be shewn that υἱὸς θεοῦ was <em> ever so used</em> . I believe Luke’s to be a different report: see notes there.</p>
