<b> 54.</b>]<b> the earthquake and those that were done</b> is represented by<i> “that he so gave up the ghost,”</i> Mark. Does the latter of these look as if compiled from the former? The circumstances of our vv. 51–53, except the rending of the veil, are not in the possession St. Mark, of the minute accuracy of whose account I have no doubt.<i> His</i> report is that of<i> one man—</i>and that man, more than probably, a<i> convert</i>. St. Matthew’s is of<i> many,</i> and represents their general impression. St. Luke’s is also<i> general.</i><br><br><b> those things that were done</b> points to the crying out, as indeed does the “<i>so</i>” in Mark:—but see notes there.<br><br><b> was the Son of God</b>—which the Centurion had heard that<i> He gare Himself out for,</i> John xix. 7, and our ver.<br><br> 43. It cannot be doubtful, I think, that he used these words<i> in the Jewish sense—</i>and with some idea of that which they implied. When Meyer says that he must have used them in a heathen sense, meaning a<i> hero or demigod,</i> we must first be shewn that<i> “Son of God”</i> was<i> ever so used.</i> I believe St. Luke’s to be a different report: see notes there.
