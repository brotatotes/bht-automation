<b> 59.</b>] John (ver. 39) mentions<i> the arrival of Nicodemus</i> with an hundred pound weight of myrrh and aloes, in which also the Body was wrapped. The Three seem not to be in possession of this—nor St. Matthew and St. John of the subsequent design of the women to embalm It. What wonder if, at such a time, one party of disciples should not have been aware of the doings of another? It is possible that the women, who certainly<i> knew what had been done</i> with the Body (see ver. 61), may have intended to bestow on it more elaborate care, as whatever was doné this night was<i> hurried,</i>—see John, vv. 41, 42.
