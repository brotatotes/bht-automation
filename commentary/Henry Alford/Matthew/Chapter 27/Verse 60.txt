 60. ] Matt. alone relates that it was Joseph’s  own tomb. John, that it was  in a garden , and  in the place where He was crucified . All, except Mark, notice the  newness of the tomb. John does not mention that it  belonged to Joseph but the expression ἐν ᾧ οὐδέπω οὐδεὶς ἐτέθη looks as if he knew more than he has thought it necessary to state. His reason for the Body being laid there is, that  it was near , and the Preparation rendered haste necessary. But then we may well ask, How should the body of an executed person be laid in a new tomb, without the consent of the owner being first obtained? And who so likely to provide a tomb, as he whose pious care for the Body was so eminent?
	All that we can determine respecting the sepulchre from the data here furnished is, (1) That it was not a  natural cave, but an  artificial excavation in the rock. (2) That it was not cut  downwards , after the manner of a grave with us, but  horizontally, or nearly so , into the face of the rock this I conceive to be implied in προσκυλίσας λίθ . μέγ . τῇ θύρᾳ τοῦ μν ., as also by the use of παρακύπτω John 20:5 ; John 20:11 , and εἰσῆλθεν , ib. John 20:5-6 . (3) That it was  in the spot where the crucifixion took place. Cyr-jer. speaks of τὸ μνῆμα τὸ πλησίον , ὅπου ἐτέθη , κ . ὁ ἐπιτεθεὶς τῇ θύρᾳ λίθος , ὁ μέχρι σήμερον παρὰ τῷ μνημείῳ κείμενος . Cateches. xiii. 39, p. 202. On ἐλατόμησεν , the aor. in a relative clause, see above, Mat 27:55 note.
