<b> 60.</b>] St. Matthew alone relates that it was Joseph’s<i> own</i> tomb. St. John, that it was<i> in a garden,</i> and<i> in the place where He was crucified.</i> All, except St. Mark, notice the<i> newness</i> of the tomb. St. John does not mention that it<i> belonged to Joseph—</i>but the expression<i> “in which was never man yet laid”</i> looks as if he knew more than he has thought it necessary to state. His reason for the Body being laid there is, that<i> it was near,</i> and the Preparation rendered haste necessary. But then we may well ask, How should the body of an executed person be laid in a new tomb, without the consent of the owner being first obtained? And who so likely to provide a tomb, as he whose pious care for the Body was so eminent?<br><br> All that we can determine respecting the sepulchre from the data here furnished is, (1) That it was not a<i> natural</i> cave, but an<i> artificial excavation</i> in the rock. (2) That it was not cut<i> downwards,</i> after the manner of a grave with us, but<i> horizontally,</i> or<i> nearly</i> so, into the face of the rock—this I conceive to be implied in<i> “rolled a great stone to the door,”</i> as also by the use of<i> “stooping down,”</i> John xx. 5, 11, and<i> “went in,”</i> ib. 5, 6.<br><br> (3) That it<b> was</b><i> in the spot</i> where the crucifixion took place. Cyril of Jerusalem speaks of “the tomb close by, where He was laid, and the stone which was put on the door, which to this day (about 380 A.D.) lies by the tomb.”
