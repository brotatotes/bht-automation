<p><strong> 60.</strong> ] Matt. alone relates that it was Joseph’s <em> own</em> tomb. John, that it was <em> in a garden</em> , and <em> in the place where He was crucified</em> . All, except Mark, notice the <em> newness</em> of the tomb. John does not mention that it <em> belonged to Joseph</em> but the expression ἐν ᾧ οὐδέπω οὐδεὶς ἐτέθη looks as if he knew more than he has thought it necessary to state. His reason for the Body being laid there is, that <em> it was near</em> , and the Preparation rendered haste necessary. But then we may well ask, How should the body of an executed person be laid in a new tomb, without the consent of the owner being first obtained? And who so likely to provide a tomb, as he whose pious care for the Body was so eminent?

<p>All that we can determine respecting the sepulchre from the data here furnished is, (1) That it was not a <em> natural</em> cave, but an <em> artificial excavation</em> in the rock. (2) That it was not cut <em> downwards</em> , after the manner of a grave with us, but <em> horizontally, or nearly so</em> , into the face of the rock this I conceive to be implied in προσκυλίσας λίθ . μέγ . τῇ θύρᾳ τοῦ μν ., as also by the use of παρακύπτω <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:5">John 20:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:11">John 20:11</span> , and εἰσῆλθεν , ib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:5-6">John 20:5-6</span> . (3) That it was <em> in the spot</em> where the crucifixion took place. Cyr-jer. speaks of τὸ μνῆμα τὸ πλησίον , ὅπου ἐτέθη , κ . ὁ ἐπιτεθεὶς τῇ θύρᾳ λίθος , ὁ μέχρι σήμερον παρὰ τῷ μνημείῳ κείμενος . Cateches. xiii. 39, p. 202. On ἐλατόμησεν , the aor. in a relative clause, see above, Mat 27:55 note.</p>
