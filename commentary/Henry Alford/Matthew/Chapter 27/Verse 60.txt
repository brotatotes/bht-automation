<b> 60.</b>] St. Matthew alone relates that it was Joseph’s<i> own</i> tomb. St. John, that it was<i> in a garden,</i> and<i> in the place where He was crucified.</i> All, except St. Mark, notice the<i> newness</i> of the tomb. St. John does not mention that it<i> belonged to Joseph—</i>but the expression<i> “in which was never man yet laid”</i> looks as if he knew more than he has thought it necessary to state. His reason for the Body being laid there is, that<i> it was near,</i> and the Preparation rendered haste necessary. But then we may well ask, How should the body of an executed person be laid in a new tomb, without the consent of the owner being first obtained? And who so likely to provide a tomb, as he whose pious care for the Body was so eminent?
