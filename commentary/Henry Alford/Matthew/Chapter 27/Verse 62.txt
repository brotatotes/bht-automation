<b> 62. the next day</b>] not on that night, but on the next day. A difficulty has been found in its being called the day<i> after the Preparation,</i> considering that it was<i> itself the sabbath,</i> and the<i> greatest sabbath in the year</i>. But I believe the expression to be carefully and purposely used. The chief priests, &c. did not go to Pilate on the sabbath,—but<i> in the evening, the termination of the sabbath.</i> Had the Evangelist said<i> “which is the sabbath,”</i> the incongruity would at once appear of such an application being made on the sabbath—and he therefore designates the day as the first after that, which, as the day of the Lord’s death, the<i> preparation</i>, was uppermost in his mind.
