<b> 9.]</b> The citation is not from Jeremiah (see ref.), and is probably quoted from memory and precisely; we have similar instances in two places in the apology of Stephen, Acts vii. 4, 16,—and in Mark ii, 26. Various means of evading this have been resorted to, which are not worth recounting. Jer. xviii. 1, 2, or perhaps Jer. xxxii. 6–12, may have given rise to it: or it may have arisen from a Jewish idea [see Wordsworth here],<i> “that Zechariah had the spirit of Jeremiah.”</i> The quotation here is very different from the Septuagint,—and not much more like the Hebrew. I put it to any faithful Christian to say, whether of the two presents the greater obstacle to his faith, the solution given above, or that given by a commentator of our own day, that the name of one prophet is here substituted for that of another, to teach us not to regard the prophets as the<i> authors</i> of their prophecies, but to trace them to divine Inspiration.
