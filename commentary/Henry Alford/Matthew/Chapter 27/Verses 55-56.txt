	 ἡ Μαγδ  ., from Magdala: see note on ch. Matthew 15:39 . She is not to be confounded with Mary who anointed our Lord, John 12:1 , nor with the woman who did the same, Luke 7:36 ; see Luke 8:2 .
	 Μαρ  .   ἡ τ  .   Ἰακ  . ] The wife of Alphæus or Clopas, John 19:25 ; see note on ch. Matthew 13:55 .

Both  omit Mary the mother of Jesus : but we must remember, that if we are to take the group as described at this moment,  she was not present , having been, as I believe (see note on Joh 19:27 ), led away by the beloved Apostle immediately on the speaking of the words, ‘Behold thy mother.’ And if this view be objected to, yet she could not be named here, nor in Mark, except separately from these three for she could not well have been one of the διακονοῦσαι αὐτῷ .
	There must have been also  another group , of His  disciples , within sight; e.g. Thomas, who said, ‘Except I see in his hands the print of the nails,’ &c., and generally those to whom He afterwards shewed his hands and feet as a proof of his identity.
