<b> 1. In the end of the sabbath</b>] There is some little difficulty here, because the end of the sabbath (and of the week) was at<i> sunset the night before.</i> It is hardly to be supposed that St. Matthew means the<i> evening</i> of the sabbath, though<i> “dawn”</i> is used of the day beginning at sunset (Luke xxiii. 54, and note). It is best to interpret a doubtful expression in unison with the other testimonies, and to suppose that here both the<i> day</i> and the<i> breaking of the day</i> are taken in their<i> natural,</i> not their<i> Jewish</i> sense.<br><br><b> Mary Magdalene and the other Mary</b>] In Mark,<i> Salome also.</i> St. John speaks of<i> Mary Magdalene</i><i> alone</i>. See notes there.<br><br><b> to see the sepulchre]</b> It was to<i> anoint</i> the Body, for which purposes they had bought, since the end of the Sabbath, ointments and spices, Mark.<br><br> In Mark it is<i> after the rising of the sun;</i> in John,<i> while yet dark;</i> in Luke,<i> at dim dawn;</i> the two last agree with our text.
