 1.   ὀψὲ δὲ σαβ  . ] not, ‘  at the end of the week .’ The words σαββάτων and μίαν σαββ . are opposed, both being  days .  At the end of the Sabbath. There is some little difficulty here, because the end of the sabbath (and of the week) was at  sunset the night before . It is hardly to be supposed that St. Matthew means the  evening of the sabbath, though ἐπέφωσκε is used of the day beginning at sunset (Luke 23:54 , and note). It is best to interpret a doubtful expression in unison with the other testimonies, and to suppose that here both the  day and the  breaking of the day are taken in their  natural , not their  Jewish sense.
	 μίαν σαβ . is a Hebraism; the Rabbinical writings use אהד , שני , שלישי , &c., affixing בשבת to each, for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, &c.

	 θεωρ  .   τ  .   τ  . ] It was to  anoint the Body, for which purposes they had bought, since the end of the Sabbath, ointments and spices, Mark.
	In Mark it is  after the rising of the sun ; in John,  while yet dark ; in Luke,  at dim dawn : the two last agree with our text.
