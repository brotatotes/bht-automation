<b> 1. In the end of the sabbath</b>] There is some little difficulty here, because the end of the sabbath (and of the week) was at<i> sunset the night before.</i> It is hardly to be supposed that St. Matthew means the<i> evening</i> of the sabbath, though<i> “dawn”</i> is used of the day beginning at sunset (Luke xxiii. 54, and note). It is best to interpret a doubtful expression in unison with the other testimonies, and to suppose that here both the<i> day</i> and the<i> breaking of the day</i> are taken in their<i> natural,</i> not their<i> Jewish</i> sense.
