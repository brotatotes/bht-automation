The repetition of this injunction by the Lord has been thought to indicate that this is a portion of another narrative inwoven here, and may possibly belong to the same incident as that in Matthew 28:7 .

There is perhaps more probability that this may be the same appearance as that in John 20:11-18 , on account of μή μου ἅπτου there and τοὺς ἀδελφ . μου , but in our present imperfect state of information, this must remain a  mere probability.
