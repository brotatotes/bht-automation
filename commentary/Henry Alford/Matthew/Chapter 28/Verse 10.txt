<b> 10.] my brethren</b>; so also to Mary Magdalene, John xx. 17.<br><br> The repetition of this injunction by the Lord has been thought to indicate that this is a portion of another narrative inwoven here, and may possibly belong to the same incident as that in ver. 7. But all probability is against this: the passages are distinctly consecutive, and moreover both are in the well-known style of St. Matthew (e. g., “<i>behold</i>” in both). There is perhaps more probability that this may be the same appearance as that in John xx. 11–18, on account of “<i>touch me not</i>,” there, and “<i>my brethren</i>,”—but in our present imperfect state of information, this must remain a<i> mere</i> probability.
