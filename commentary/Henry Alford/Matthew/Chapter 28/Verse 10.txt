The repetition of this injunction by the Lord has been thought to indicate that this is a portion of another narrative inwoven here, and may possibly belong to the same incident as that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:7">Matthew 28:7</span> . But all probability is against this: the passages are distinctly consecutive, and moreover both are in the well-known style of Matthew (e.g. καὶ ἰδού in both). There is perhaps more probability that this may be the same appearance as that in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:11-18">John 20:11-18</span> , on account of μή μου ἅπτου there and τοὺς ἀδελφ . μου , but in our present imperfect state of information, this must remain a <em> mere</em> probability.</p>
