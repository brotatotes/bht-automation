<b> 19.] therefore</b> is not found, or found in varying forms, in many of the ancient authorities. It is probably a gloss, but an excellent one. It is the glorification of the Son by the Father through the Spirit, which is the foundation of the Church of Christ in all the world. And when we baptize into the Name (i. e. into the fulness of the consequence of the objective covenant, and the subjective confession) of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, it is<i> this</i> which forms the ground and cause of our power to do so—that this flesh of man, of which God hath made<b> all the nations</b>, is<i> glorified in the Person of our Redeemer</i>, through whom we all have access by one Spirit to the Father.<br><br><b> Go.... and make disciples]</b> Demonstrably, this was not understood as spoken to the Apostles<i> only</i>, but to all the brethren. Thus we read (Acts viii. 2, 4),<i> “they were all scattered abroad.... except the Apostles:—they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.”</i> There is peculiar meaning in<b> make disciples of.</b> All<i> power</i> is given me—go therefore and...<i> subdue?</i> Not so: the purpose of the Lord is to bring men to the<i> knowledge of the truth</i>—to work on and in their hearts, and lift them up to be partakers of the Divine Nature. And therefore it is not<i> ‘subdue,’</i> but<b> make disciples of</b> (see below).<br><br><b> all the nations</b> again is closely connected with<i> “all in earth.”</i><br><br><b> all the nations]</b> including the Jews. It is absurd to imagine that in these words of the Lord there is implied a<i> rejection of the Jews</i>, in direct variance with his commands elsewhere, and also with the world-wide signification of<i> “in earth,”</i> above. Besides, the (temporary) rejection of the Jews consists in this, that they are<i> numbered among all the nations</i>, and not a peculiar people any longer: and are become, in the providence of God, the subjects of that preaching, of which by original title they ought to have been the promulgators. We find the first preachers of the gospel, so far from excepting the Jews, uniformly bearing their testimony to them<i> first</i>. With regard to the difficulty which has been raised on these words,—that if they had been thus spoken by the Lord, the Apostles would never have had any doubt about the admission of the Gentiles into the Church,—I would answer that the Apostles<i> never had any doubt whatever</i> about<i> admitting</i> Gentiles,—only whether they should not be<i> circumcised</i> first. In this command, the prohibition of ch. x. 5 is for ever removed.<br><br><b> baptising them]</b> Both these present participles are the conditions of the imperative preceding. The<i> making disciples</i> consists of two the<i> initiatory</i>, admissory<i> rite</i>, and the<i> subsequent teaching</i>. It is much to be that the inadequate rendering, ‘<i>teach</i>,’ has in our Bibles clouded the meaning of these important words. It will be observed that in our Lord’s words, as in the Church, the process of ordinary discipleship is<i> from baptism to instruction</i>—i. e. is,<i> admission in infancy to the covenant</i>, and<i> growing up into observing all things commanded by Christ</i>—the<i> exception</i> being, what circumstances rendered so frequent in the early church,<i> instruction before baptism</i> in the case of<i> adults</i>. On this we may also remark, that baptism, as known to the Jews, included, just as it does in the Acts (ch. xvi. 15, 88),<i> whole households—wives and children</i>.<br><br> As regards the command itself, no unprejudiced reader can doubt that it regards the<i> outward rite</i> of BAPTISM, so well known in this gospel as having been practised by John, and received by the Lord Himself. And thus it was immediately, and has been ever since, understood by the Church. As regards all attempts to explain away this sense, we may say—even setting aside the testimony furnished by the Acts of the Apostles,—that it is in the highest degree improbable that our Lord should have given, at a time when He was summing up the duties of His Church in such weighty words, a command couched in figurative or ambiguous language—one which He must have known would be interpreted by His disciples, now long accustomed to the rite and its name, otherwise than He intended it.<br><br><b> into the name…]</b> Reference is apparently made to the Baptism of the Lord himself, where the whole Three Persons of the Godhead were in manifestation.<br><br> Not the<i> names</i>—but<b> the name</b>—setting forth the Unity of the Godhead.<br><br><b> into]</b> It is unfortunate again here that our English Bibles do not give us the force of this word. “<i>In</i>” should have been<b> into</b>, (as in Gal. iii. 27 al.,) both here and in 1 Cor. x. 2, and wherever the expression is used. It imports, not only a<i> subjective recognition</i> hereafter by the child of the truth implied in the Name, &c., but an<i> objective admission</i> into the covenant of Redemption—a<i> putting on of Christ</i>. Baptism is the<i> contract of espousal</i> (Eph. v. 26) between Christ and His Church. Our word ‘<i>in</i>’ being retained both here and in our formula of Baptism, it should always be remembered that t<i> he Sacramental declaration is contained in this word</i>; that it answers (as Stier has well observed, vii. 268) to the “<i>This is my Body</i>,” in the other Sacrament. On the difference between the<i> baptism of John</i> and<i> Christian baptism</i>, see notes on ch. iii. 11: Acts xviii. 25; xix. 1–5.
