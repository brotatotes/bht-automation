	 καὶ ἰδοὺ  …   ἐγένετο must mean that the women were  witnesses of the earthquake , and  that which happened .
	 σεισμός was not  properly an earthquake, but was the sudden opening of the tomb by the descending Angel, as the  γάρ shews. The rolling away was not done naturally, but by a shock, which = σεισμός .
	It must not be supposed that the Resurrection of our Lord took place  at this time , as sometimes imagined, and represented in paintings. It  had taken place before ;  ἠγέρθη κ  .  τ  .  λ  . are the words of the Angel. It was not  for Him , to whom (see John 20:19 ; Joh 20:26 ) the stone was  no hindrance , but  for the women and His disciples , that it was rolled away.
