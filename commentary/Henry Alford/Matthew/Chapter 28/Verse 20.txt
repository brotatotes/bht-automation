In these words, inasmuch as the then living disciples<i> could not teach all nations</i>, does the Lord<i> found the office of Preachers</i> in His Church, with all that belongs to it,—the duties of the<i> minister</i>, the<i> school-teacher</i>, the<i> scripture reader</i>. This ‘<i>teaching</i>’ is not merely the<i> preaching</i> of the gospel—not mere proclamation of the good news—but the whole catechetical office of the Church upon and in the baptized.
