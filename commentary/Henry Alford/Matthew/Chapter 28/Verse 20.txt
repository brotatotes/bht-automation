<b> 20.]</b> Even in the case of the adult, this teaching must,<i> in greater part</i>, follow his baptism; though as we have seen (on ver. 19), in<i> his</i> exceptional case,<i> some of it</i> must<i> go before</i>. For this teaching is nothing less than the building up of the whole man into the obedience of Christ. In these words, inasmuch as the then living disciples<i> could not teach all nations</i>, does the Lord<i> found the office of Preachers</i> in His Church, with all that belongs to it,—the duties of the<i> minister</i>, the<i> school-teacher</i>, the<i> scripture reader</i>. This ‘<i>teaching</i>’ is not merely the<i> preaching</i> of the gospel—not mere proclamation of the good news—but the whole catechetical office of the Church upon and in the baptized.<br><br><b> and, lo,...]</b> These words imply and set forth the<i> Ascension</i>, the manner of which is not related by our Evangelist.<br><br><b> I</b>, in the fullest sense: not the<i> Divine presence, as distinguished from the Humanity</i> of Christ. His Humanity is with us likewise. The vine lives in the branches. Stier remarks the contrast be-tween this ‘<i>I am with you</i>,’ and the view of Nicodemus (John iii. 2) ‘no man can do these miracles—except<i> God be with him</i>.’<br><br><b> with you]</b> mainly,<i> by the promise of the Father</i> (Luke xxiv. 49)<i> which He has poured out on his Church</i>. But the presence of the Spirit is the effect of the presence of Christ—and the presence of Christ is part of the<i> gift of all power</i> above—the effect of the well-pleasing of the Father. So that the mystery of His name<i> Emmanuel</i> (with which, as Stier remarks, this Gospel begins and ends) is fulfilled—God is<i> with us</i>. And—<b>all the (</b><i>appointed</i><b>) days</b>—for they are numbered by the Father, though by none but Him.<br><br><b> unto the end of the world</b>—that time of which they had heard in so many parables, and about which they had asked, ch. xxiv. 3—literally,<b> the completion of the state of time</b>. After that, He will be no more properly speaking<i> with us</i>, but we<i> with Him</i> (John xvii. 24) where He is.<br><br> To understand<b> with you</b> only of the Apostles and their (?) successors, is to destroy the whole force of these most weighty words.<br><br> The command is to<i> the</i> UNIVERSAL CHURCH—to be performed, in the nature of things, by her<i> ministers</i> and<i> teachers</i>, the manner of which is not here prescribed. but to be learnt in the unfoldings of Providence recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, who by his special ordinance were the founders and first builders of that Church—but whose office,<i> on that very account</i>,<i> precluded the idea of succession or renewal</i>.<br><br> That St. Matthew does not record the fact or manner of<i> the Ascension</i>, is not to be used as a ground for any presumptions regarding the authenticity of the records of it which we possess. The narrative here is<i> suddenly brought to a termination</i>: that in John ends with an express declaration of its incompleteness. What reasons there may have been for the omission, either subjective, in the mind of the author of the Gospel, or objective, in the fragmentary character of the apostolic reports which are here put together, it is wholly out of our power, in this age of the world, to determine. As before remarked, the<i> fact itself</i> is here and elsewhere in this Gospel (see ch. xxii. 44; xxiv. 30; xxv. 14, 31; xxvi. 64) clearly<i> implied</i>.
