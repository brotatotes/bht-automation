<b> 5.</b>] In Mark,<i> a young man in a white robe was sitting in the tomb on the right hand:</i> in Luke,<i> two men in shining raiment</i> (see Acts i. 10)<i> appeared to them.</i> St. John relates, that Mary Magdalene looked into the tomb and saw (but this must have been afterwards) two angels in white sitting one at the head, the other at the feet where the Body had lain. All attempts to<i> deny</i> the angelic appearances, or<i> ascribe them to later tradition,</i> are dishonest and absurd. That related in John is as definite as either of the others, and he certainly had it from Mary Magdalene herself.
