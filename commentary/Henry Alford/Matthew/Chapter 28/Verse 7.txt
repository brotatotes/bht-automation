 7. ] This appearance in Galilee had been foretold before his death, see ch. Matthew 26:32 . It is to be observed that Matthew records  only this one appearance to the Apostles, and in Galilee. It appears strange that this should be the entire testimony of Matthew: for it seems hardly likely that he would omit those important appearances in Jerusalem when the Apostles were assembled, John 20:19 ; John 20:26 , or that one which was closed by the Ascension. But perhaps it may be in accord with his evident design of giving the general form and summary of each series of events, rather than their characteristic details. See below on Matthew 28:20 .
	 ὅτι is recitative.
	The  προάγει here is not to be understood as implying the  journeying on the part of our Lord himself. It is cited from His own words, ch. Matthew 26:32 , and there, as here, merely implies that  He would be there when they arrived . It has a reference to the collecting of the flock which had been scattered by the smiting of the Shepherd: see John 10:4 .
	 ἐκεῖ αὐτὸν ὄψεσθε is determined, by κἀκεῖ με ὄψονται below, to be  part of the message to the disciples : not spoken to the women directly, but certainly indirectly including them. The idea of their being  merely messengers to the Apostles, without bearing any share in the promise, is against the spirit of the context: see further in note on Matthew 28:17 .
	 ἰδοὺ εἶπον ὑμῖν is to give solemnity to the command. These words are peculiar to Matthew, and are a mark of accuracy.
