<b> 7.</b>] This appearance in Galilee had been foretold before his death, see ch. xxvi. 32. It is to be observed that St. Matthew records<i> only this one</i> appearance to the Apostles, and in Galilee. It appears strange that this should be the entire testimony of St. Matthew: for it seems hardly likely that he would omit those important appearances in Jerusalem when the Apostles were assembled, John xx. 19, 26, or that one which was closed by the Ascension. But perhaps it may be in accord with his evident design of giving the general form and summary of each series of events, rather than their characteristic details. See below on ver. 20.<br><br> The<b> goeth before</b> here is not to be understood as implying the<i> journeying</i> on the part of our Lord Himself. It is cited from His own words, ch. xxvi. 32, and there, as here, merely implies that<i> He would be there when they arrived.</i> It has a reference to the collecting of the flock which had been scattered by the smiting of the Shepherd; see John x. 4.<br><br><b> there shall ye see him</b> is determined, by<i> “there shall they see me,”</i> below, to be<i> part of the message to the disciples:</i> not spoken to the women directly, but certainly indirectly including them. The idea of their being<i> merely</i> messengers; to the Apostles, without bearing any share in the promise, is against the spirit of the context: see further in note on ver. 17.<br><br><b> lo, I have told you</b> is to give solemnity to the command. These words are peculiar to Matthew, and are a mark of accuracy.
