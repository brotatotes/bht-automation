It is to be observed that St. Matthew records<i> only this one</i> appearance to the Apostles, and in Galilee. It appears strange that this should be the entire testimony of St. Matthew: for it seems hardly likely that he would omit those important appearances in Jerusalem when the Apostles were assembled, John xx. 19, 26, or that one which was closed by the Ascension. But perhaps it may be in accord with his evident design of giving the general form and summary of each series of events, rather than their characteristic details. See below on ver. 20.
