<b> 9.</b>] Neither St. Mark nor St. Lake recounts, or seems to have been aware of, this appearance. St. Mark even says<i> “they said nothing to any man: for they were afraid.”</i> But (see above) it does not therefore follow that the narratives are inconsistent. St. Mark’s account (see note there) is evidently broken off suddenly; and St. Luke's (see also note there) appears to have been derived from one of those who went to Emmaus, who had evidently but an imperfect knowledge of what happened before they left the city. This being taken into account, we may fairly require that the judgment should be suspended in lack of further means of solving the difficulty.
