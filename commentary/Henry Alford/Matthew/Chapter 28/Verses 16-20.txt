 16 20. ] APPEARANCE OF THE LORD ON A MOUNTAIN IN GALILEE. This journey into Galilee was  after the termination of the feast , allowing  two first days of the week , on which the Lord appeared to the assembled Apostles (John 20:19 ; Joh 20:26 ), to elapse. It illustrates the imperfect and fragmentary nature of the materials out of which our narrative is built, that the appointment of this mountain as a place of assembly for the eleven  has not been mentioned , although  τὸ ὄρος οὗ seems to imply that it has. Stier well remarks (Reden Jesu, vii. 209) that in this verse Matthew gives a hint of  some interviews having taken place previously to this in Galilee. And it is important to bear this in mind, as suggesting, if not the solution, at least the  ground of solution, of the difficulties of this passage. Mat 28:17 seems to present an instance of this imperfect and fragmentary narrative. The impression given by it is that the majority  of the eleven worshipped Him, but some doubted (not,  whether they should worship Him ; which is absurd and not implied in the word. On  οἱ δέ  , cf. ch. Matthew 26:67 . ᾧχοντο εἰς Δεκέλειαν , οἱ δ ʼ ἐς Μέγαρα , Xen. Hell. i. 2. 14: see also Anab. i. 5. 13). This however would hardly be possible,  after the two appearances at Jerusalem in John 20:1-31 . We are therefore obliged to conclude that  others were present . Whether these others were the ‘500 brethren at once’ of whom Paul speaks 1 Corinthians 15:6 , or some other disciples, does not appear. Olshausen and Stier suppose, from the previous announcement of this meeting, and the repetition of that announcement by the angel, and by our Lord, that it probably included  all the disciples of Jesus; at least, all who would from the nature of the case be brought together.
