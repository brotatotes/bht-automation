<b> 1. In those days</b>] The last matter mentioned was the dwelling at Nazareth; and though we must not take the connexion strictly as implying that<i> Joseph</i> dwelt there all the intermediate thirty years, “<i>those days</i>” must be understood to mean that we take up the persons of the narrative where we left them; i.e. dwelling at Nazareth.<br><br><b> came</b>] literally,<b> comes forward—</b> ‘makes his appearance.’ Euthymius asks the question,<i> whence?</i> and answers it,<i> from the recesses of the wilderness</i>. But this can hardly be, owing to the “<i>in the wilderness</i>” following. The verb is used absolutely. The title “John<i> the Baptist</i>” shews that St. Matthew was writing for those who well knew John the Baptist as an historical personage. Josephus, in mentioning him, calls him “<i>John who is called the Baptist.</i>” John was strictly speaking a<i> prophet</i>; belonging to the legal dispensation; a rebuker of sin, and preacher of repentance. The expression in St. Luke, “<i>the word of God came to John,</i>” is the usual formula for the divine commission of the Prophets (Jer. i. 1: Ezek. vi. 1; vii. 1, &c.). And the effect of the Holy Spirit on John was more in accordance with the O.T. than the N.T. inspiration; more of a sudden overpowering influence, as in the Prophets, than a gentle indwelling manifested through the individual character, as in the Apostles and Evangelists.—The baptism of John was of a deeper significance than that usual among the Jews in the case of proselytes, and formed an integral part of his divinely appointed office. It was emphatically the baptism of<i> repentance</i> (Luke iii. 3), but not that of<i> regeneration</i> (Titus iii. 5).<br><br> We find in Acts xviii. 24–26; xix. 1–7, accounts of persons who had received the baptism of John, who believed, and (in Apollos’s case) taught accurately the things (i. e. facts concerning the Lord; but required instruction (in doctrine), and rebaptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus. Whether the baptism practised by the disciples before the Resurrection was of the same kind, and required this renewal, is uncertain. The fact of our Lord Himself having received baptism from John, is decisive against the identity of the two rites, as also against the idea derived from Acts xix. 4, that John used the formula “<i>I baptize thee in the name of Him who is to come.</i>” His whole mission was calculated, in accordance with the office of the law, which gives the knowledge of sin (Rom. iii. 20), to bring men’s minds into that state in which the Redeemer invites them (ch. xi. 28), as weary and heavy laden, to come to Him.<br><br><b> in the wilderness</b>] Where also he had been brought up, Luke i. 80. This tract was not strictly a<i> desert</i>, but thinly peopled, and abounding in pastures for flocks. This<i> wilderness</i> answers to “<i>all the country round about Jordan</i>” in Luke iii. 3. See note on ch. iv. 1.
