<p><strong> 11. </strong> <strong> ἐν ὕδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] ἐν is not redundant, but signifies the <em> vehicle</em> of baptism, as in ἐν πν . ἁγ . κ . πυρί afterwards.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐρχόμενος</strong> ] The present participle is used of a certain and predetermined future event; “he that is to come.” See on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:4">Matthew 2:4</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> τὰ ὑποδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> βαστάσαι</strong> ] Lightfoot (from Maimonides) shews that it was the token of a slave having become his master’s property, to <em> loose</em> his shoe, to <em> tie</em> the same, or to <em> carry</em> the necessary articles for him to the bath. The expressions therefore in all the Gospels amount to the same.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν πν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἁγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πυρί</strong> ] This was literally fulfilled at the day of Pentecost: but Origen and others refer the words to the baptism of the <em> righteous by the Holy Spirit</em> , and of <em> the wicked by fire</em> . I have no doubt that this (which I am surprised to see upheld by Neander, De Wette, and Meyer) is a mistake in the present case, though apparently (to the superficial reader) borne out by <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:12">Matthew 3:12</span> . The <em> double</em> symbolic reference of fire, elsewhere found, e.g. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:50">Mark 9:50</span> , as purifying the good and consuming the evil, though <em> illustrated</em> by these verses, is hardly to be pressed into the interpretation of πυρί in this verse, the prophecy <em> here</em> being solely of that higher and more perfect baptism to which that of John was a mere introduction. To separate off πν . ἁγίῳ as belonging to one set of persons, and πυρί as belonging to another, when both are united in ὑμᾶς , is in the last degree harsh, besides introducing confusion into the whole. The members of comparison in this verse are <em> strictly parallel</em> to one another: the <em> baptism by water</em> , the end of which is μετάνοια , a mere transition state, a note of preparation, and the <em> baptism by the Holy Ghost and fire</em> , the end of which is ( Mat 3:12 ) <em> sanctification</em> , the entire aim and purpose of man’s creation and renewal. So Chrys.: τῇ ἐπεξηγήσει τοῦ πυρὸς πάλιν τὸ σφοδρὸν καὶ ἀκάθεκτον τῆς χάριτος ἐνδεικνύμενος . Thus the <em> official superiority</em> of the Redeemer (which is all that our Evangelist here deals with) is fully brought out. The superiority of <em> nature</em> and <em> pre-existence</em> is reserved for the fuller and more dogmatic account in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1-51">John 1:1-51</span> .</p>
