Thus in Job xxxix. 12, “he will bring home thy seed, and<i> gather thy barn</i>” (literally).

See “The Land and the Book,” p. 538 ff., where there is an illustration. “Very little use is now made of the<i> fan</i>, but I have seen it employed to<i> purge the floor</i> of the refuse dust, which the owner throws away as useless,” p. 540.<br><br><b> chaff</b>] Not only<i> the chaff</i>, but also<i> the straw</i>: see reff.: ‘all that is not wheat.’
