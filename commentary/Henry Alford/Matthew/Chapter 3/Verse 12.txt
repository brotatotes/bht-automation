<p><strong> 12. </strong> <strong> οὗ τὸ πτύον</strong> ] οὗ … αὐτοῦ , a very common redundancy. See reff. οὗ is not ‘ <em> whose</em> ,’ which is implied in τό : it belongs (against Meyer) to χειρί , not to πτύον , and the sense is just as if it had stood, οὗ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὸ πτύον . In the Rabbinical work Midrash Tehillim, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:1-12">Psalms 2:1-12</span> , is found: ‘Advenit trituratio, stramen projiciunt in iguem, paleam in ventum, sed triticum conservant in area: sic nationes mundi erunt sicut conflagratio furni: ast Israel conservabitur solus.’ (Quoted by Lightfoot on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span> .)

<p><strong> τὴν ἅλωνα</strong> ] <em> The contents of the barn-floor</em> . (De Wette, &amp;c.) Thus in ref. Job, εἰσοίσει δέ σου ( σοι [23] , not [24] ) τὸν ἅλωνα . Or perhaps owing to διακαθ . ( <strong> shall cleanse from one end to the other</strong> ) the <em> floor itself</em> , which was an open hard-trodden space in the middle of the field. See “The Land and the Book,” p. 538 ff., where there is an illustration. “Very little use is now made of the <em> fan</em> , but I have seen it employed to <em> purge the floor</em> of the refuse dust, which the owner throws away as useless.” p. 540.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [23] The Codex Boreeli, once possessed by John Boreel, Dutch ambassador in London under James I. It was lost for many years, till found at Arnheim by Heringa, a professor at Utrecht. It is now in the public library at the latter place. Heringa wrote a dissertation on it, so copious as to serve for an edition of the codex itself. This dissertation was published by Vinke in 1843. Contains the four Gospels with many lacunæ, which have increased since Wetstein’s time. Tischendorf in 1841 examined the codex and compared it with Heringa’s collation. Tischendorf assigns it to the <em> ninth century:</em> Tregelles, to the <em> tenth</em> .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [24] The MS. referred to by this symbol is that commonly called the Alexandrine, or CODEX ALEXANDRINUS. It once belonged to Cyrillus Lucaris, patriarch of Alexandria and then of Constantinople, who in the year 1628 presented it to our King Charles I. It is now in the British Museum. It is on parchment in four volumes, of which three contain the Old, and one the New Testament, with the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians. This fourth volume is exhibited open in a glass case. It will be seen by the letters in the inner margin of this edition, that the first 24 chapters of Matthew are wanting in it, its first leaf commencing ὁ νυμφίος , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span> : as also the leaves containing ἵνα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:50">John 6:50</span> , to καὶ σύ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:52">John 8:52</span> . It is generally agreed that it was written at Alexandria; it does not, however, <em> in the Gospels</em> , represent that commonly known as the Alexandrine text, but approaches much more nearly to the Constantinopolitan, or generally received text. The New Testament, according to its text, was edited, in uncial types cast to imitate those of the MS., by Woide, London, 1786, the Old Testament by Baber, London, 1819: and its N.T. text has now been edited in common type by Mr. B. H. Cowper, London, 1861. The date of this MS. has been variously assigned, but it is now pretty generally agreed to be the <em> fifth century</em> .
