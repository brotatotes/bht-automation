<p><strong> 13. </strong> <strong> τοῦ βαπτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Why should our Lord, who was <em> without sin</em> , have come to <em> a baptism of repentance?</em> Because He was <em> made sin for us:</em> for which reason also He suffered the curse of the law. It became Him, being <em> in the likeness of sinful flesh</em> , to go through those appointed rites and purifications which belonged to that flesh. There is no more strangeness in His having been baptized by John, than in His keeping the Passovers. The one rite, as the other, belonged to <em> sinners</em> and <em> among the transgressors He was numbered</em> . The prophetic words in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:12">Psalms 40:12</span> , spoken in the person of our Lord, indicate, in the midst of sinlessness, the most profound apprehension of the sins of that nature which He took upon him. I cannot suppose the baptism to have been sought by our Lord merely <em> to honour John</em> (Kuinöel), or as <em> knowing that it would be the occasion of a divine recognition</em> of his Messiahship (Paulus), and thus preordained by God (Meyer): but <em> bona fide</em> , as bearing the infirmities and carrying the sorrows of mankind, and thus beginning here the triple baptism of water, fire, and blood, two parts of which were now accomplished, and of the third of which He himself speaks, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:50">Luke 12:50</span> , and the beloved Apostle, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:8">1 John 5:8</span> , where πνεῦμα = πῦρ .
	</p>
<p>His baptism, as it was our Lord’s <em> closing</em> act of obedience under the Law, in His hitherto concealed life of legal submission, His πληρῶσαι πᾶσ . δικ ., so was His <em> solemn inauguration and anointing for the higher official life of mediatorial satisfaction</em> which was now opening upon Him. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3-4">Romans 1:3-4</span> . We must not forget that the <em> working out of perfect righteousness in our flesh</em> by the entire and spotless keeping of God’s law ( Deu 6:25 ), was, in the main, <em> accomplished during the thirty years previous to our Lord’s official ministry</em> .</p>
