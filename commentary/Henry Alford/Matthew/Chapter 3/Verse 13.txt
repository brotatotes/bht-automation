<b> 13. to be baptized</b>] Why should our Lord, who was<i> without sin</i>, have come to<i> a baptism of repentance?</i> Because He was<i> made sin for us</i>: for which reason also He suffered the curse of the law. It became Him, being<i> in the likeness of sinful flesh</i>, to go through those appointed rites and purifications which belonged to that flesh. There is no more strangeness in His having been baptized by John, than in His keeping the Passovers. The one rite, as the other, belonged to sinners—and<i> among the transgressors He was numbered</i>. The prophetic words in Ps, xl. 12, spoken in the person of our Lord, indicate, in the midst of sinlessness, the most profound apprehension of the sins of that nature which He took upon him. I cannot suppose the baptism to have been sought by our Lord merely t<i> o honour John</i>, or as<i> knowing that it would be the occasion of a divine recognition</i> of his Messiahship, and thus pre-ordained by God: but<i> bonâ fide</i>, as bearing the infirmities and carrying the sorrows of mankind, and thus beginning here the triple baptism of water, fire, and blood, two parts of which were now accomplished, and of the third of which He himself speaks, Luke xii. 50, and the beloved Apostle, 1 John v. 8.—His baptism, as it was our Lord’s<i> closing</i> act of obedience under the Law, in His hitherto concealed life of legal submission, His fulfilling all righteousness, so was His<i> solemn inauguration and anointing for the higher official life of mediatorial satisfaction</i> which was now opening upon Him. See Rom. i. 3, 4. We must not forget that the<i> working out of perfect righteousness in our flesh</i> by the entire and spotless keeping of God’s law (Deut. vi. 25), was, in the main,<i> accomplished during the thirty years previous to our Lord’s official ministry.</i><br><br><b> 14. forbad</b>) Rather,<b> tried to hinder</b>: the word implies the active and earnest preventing, with the gesture, or hand, or voice. There is only an<i> apparent</i> inconsistency between the speech of John in this sense, and the assertion made by him in John i, 33, ‘I knew him not.’ Let us regard the matter in this light:—John begins his ministry by a commission from God, who also admonishes him, that He, whose Forerunner he was, would be in time revealed to him by a special sign. Jesus comes to be baptized by him. From the nature of his relationship to our Lord, he could not but know those events which had accompanied his birth, and his subsequent life of holy and unblamable purity and sanctity. My impression from the words of this verse certainly is, that he<i> regarded Him as the Messiah</i>. Still, his belief wanted that full and entire assurance which the occurrence of the predicted sign gave him, which the word<b> knew</b> implies, and which would justify him in announcing Him to his disciples as the Lamb of God.
