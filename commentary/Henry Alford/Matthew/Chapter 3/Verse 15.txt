<b> 15. now</b>] The exact meaning is difficult. It cannot well be that which the A.V. at first sight gives, that something was to be done<i> now</i>, inconsistent with the actual and hereafter-to-be-manifested relation of the two persons, Rather— ‘<i>though what has been said</i> (ver,] 4)<i> is true, yet the time is</i><i> not come for that</i>:—<b>as yet, now,</b><i> are we is another relation</i> (viz. our Lord as the<i> fulfiller</i> of the law, John as a<i> minister</i> of it),<i> therefore suffer it</i>.’ “This ‘<i>now</i>’ is spoken from the Lord’s foreknowledge, that this relation of subjection to John was only temporary, that hereafter their relative situations would be inverted.” Meyer. Stier remarks that now was fulfilled the prophetic announcement of Ps. xl. 7, 8.<br><br><b> us</b>] not for me, but for me and thee. I cannot help thinking that this word glances at the relationship and previous acknowledged destinations of the speakers. It has however a wider sense, as spoken by Him who is now first coming forth officially as the<i> Son of Man</i>, extending over<i> all those whose baptism plants them in his likeness</i>, Rom. vi.<br><br><b> righteousness</b>]<b> requirements of the law</b>. See ch. vi. 1, where the sense is general, as here.
