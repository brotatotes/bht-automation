 15.   ἀποκριθείς ] Bp. Wordsworth remarks, on this, the first occurrence of this very common form, that it is stigmatized by the grammarians as a solecism. The passage is in Phrynichus, Eclog. ed. Lobeck, p. 108, ἀποκριθῆναι διττὸν ἁμάρτημα . ἔδει γὰρ λέγειν ἀποκρίνασθαι , καὶ εἰδέναι ὅτι τὸ διαχωρισθῆναι σημαίνει , ὥσπερ οὖν καὶ τὸ ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ , τὸ συγκριθῆναι , εἰς ἓν καὶ ταὐτὸν ἐλθεῖν . εἰδὼς οὖν τοῦτο , ἐπὶ μὲν τὸ ἀποδοῦναι τὴν ἐπερώτησιν , ἀποκρίνεσθαι λέγε , ἐπὶ δὲ τοῦ διαχωρισθῆναι , τὸ ἀποκριθῆναι .
	 ἄρτι ] The exact meaning is difficult. It cannot well be that which the E. V. at first sight gives, that something was to be done  now , inconsistent with the actual and hereafter-to-be-manifested relation of the two persons. Rather ‘  though what has been said ( Mat 3:14 )  is true, yet the time is not come for that:  as yet, ἄρτι ,  now,  are we in another relation (viz. our Lord as the  fulfiller of the law, John as a  minister of it),  therefore suffer it .’ So Chrysostom: οὐ διηνεκῶς ταῦτα ἔσται , ἀλλ ʼ ὄψει με ἐν τούτοις οἷς ἐπιθυμεῖς · ἄρτι μέντοι ὑπόμεινον τοῦτο (Hom. xii. 1, p. 161), ‘This ἄρτι is spoken from the Lord’s foreknowledge, that this relation of subjection to John was only temporary, and that hereafter their relative situations would be inverted.’ Meyer. Stier remarks (Reden Jesu, vol. i. p. 14, edn. 2), that now was fulfilled the prophetic announcement of Psalms 40:7-8 .
	 ἡμῖν ] not for μοί , but for μοὶ καὶ σοί . I cannot help thinking that this word glances at the relationship and previous acknowledged destinations of the speakers. It has however a wider sense, as spoken by Him who is now first coming forth officially as the  Son of Man , extending over  all those whose baptism plants them in his likeness , Romans 6:1-23 . See Stier, ibid.
	 δικαιοσύνην ]  requirements of the law. See ch. Matthew 6:1 , where the sense is general, as here.
