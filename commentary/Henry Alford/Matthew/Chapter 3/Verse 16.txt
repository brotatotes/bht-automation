<b> 16. baptised</b>] On this account I would make the following remarks. (1) The appearance and voice seem to have been manifested to<i> our Lord and the Baptist only</i>. They may have been<i> alone</i> at the time: or, if not, we have an instance in Acts ix. 7, of such an appearance being confined to one person, while the others present were unconscious of it. We can hardly however, with some of the Fathers, say, that it was “<i>a spiritual beholding,</i>”—or that “<i>the appearance was a vision, not reality.</i>” (2) The Holy Spirit descended not only in the<i> manner</i> of a dove, but<i> in bodily shape</i> (||Luke): which I cannot understand in any but the literal sense, as THE BODILY SHAPE OF A DOVE, seen by the Baptist. There can be no objection to this, the straightforward interpretation of the narrative, which does not equally apply to the Holy Spirit being<i> visible at all</i>, which John himself asserts Him to have been (John i. 32–34), even more expressly than is asserted here. Why the Creator Spirit may not have assumed an organized body bearing symbolical meaning, as well as any other material form, does not seem clear. This was the ancient, and is the<i> only honest</i> interpretation. All the modern explanations of the “<i>like a dove,</i>” as importing the<i> manner</i> of coming down belong to the vain rationalistic attempt to reduce down that which is miraculous. The express assertion of St. Luke, and the fact that all four Evangelists have used the same expression, which they would not have done if it were a mere medium of comparison, are surely a sufficient refutation of this rationalizing (and, I may add, blundering) interpretation. (3) Two circumstances may be noticed respecting the manner of the descent of the Spirit: it was,<i> as a dove</i>:—the Spirit as manifested in our Lord was<i> gentle</i> and<i> benign</i>. This was not a sudden and temporary descent of the Spirit, but a<i> permanent</i> though special anointing of the Saviour for his holy office. It ‘<i>abode upon Him,</i>’ John i. 32. And from this moment His ministry and mediatorial work (in the active official sense) begins. Immediately, the Spirit carries Him away to the wilderness: the day of His return thence (possibly; but see notes on John i. 29) John points Him out as the Lamb of God: then follows the calling of Andrew, Peter, Philip, and Nathanael, and the third day after is the first miracle at the marriage in Cana. But we must not imagine any<i> change</i> in the nature or person of our Lord to have taken place at his baptism. The anointing and crowning are but<i> signs</i> of the official assumption of the power which the king has by a right independent of, and higher than these. (4) The whole narrative is in remarkable parallelism with that of the Transfiguration. There we have our Lord supernaturally glorified in the presence of two great prophetic personages, Moses and Elias, who speak of His decease,—on the journey to which He forthwith sets out (ch. xvii. 22, compared with xix. 1); and accompanied by the same testimony of the voice from heaven, uttering the same words, with an addition accordant with the truth then symbolized. (5) In connexion with apocryphal additions, the following are not without interest:<i> When Jesus had gone down to the water, a flame was lit up in the Jordan: and when He had come up from the water, lo, the heavens</i>, &c.
