 2.   μετανοεῖτε ] Used by the Baptist in the O.T. sense of  turning to God as His people , from the spiritual idolatry and typical adultery in which the faithless among the Jews were involved. This, of course, included personal amendment in individuals. See Luke 3:10-14 . Josephus describes John, Antt. xviii. 5. 2, as τοὺς Ἰουδαίους κελεύοντα ἀρετὴν ἐπασκοῦντας καὶ τῇ πρὸς ἀλλήλους δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ πρὸς τὸν θεὸν εὐσεβείᾳ χρωμένους βαπτισμῷ συνιέναι .
	 ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ] An expression peculiar in the N.T. to St. Matthew. The more usual one is ἡ βασ . τοῦ θεοῦ : but ἡ β . τῶν οὐρ . is common in the Rabbinical writers, who do not however, except in one or two places, mean by it  the reign of the Messiah , but  the Jewish religion the  theocracy . Still, from the use of it by St. Matthew here, and in ch. Matthew 4:17 ; Matthew 10:7 , we may conclude that it was used by the Jews, and understood, to mean  the advent of the Christ , probably from the prophecy in Daniel 2:44 ; Daniel 7:13-14 ; Daniel 7:27 .
	It has been observed by recent critics, that wherever the term βασ . τ . οὐρ . (or its equivalent) is used in the N.T., it signifies, not the Church, nor the Christian religion, but strictly the  kingdom of the Messiah which is to be revealed hereafter . I should doubt this being  exclusively true. The state of Christian men  now is undoubtedly a part of the bringing in of the kingdom of Christ, and, as such, is included in this term. See Mark 12:34 , and note on ch. Matthew 5:3 .
