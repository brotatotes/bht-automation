<b> 2. Repent</b>] Used by the Baptist in the O.T. sense of<i> turning to God as His people</i>, from the spiritual idolatry and typical adultery in which the faithless among the Jews were involved. This, of course, included personal amendment in individuals. See Luke iii. 10–14. Josephus describes John as “ ‘commanding the Jews to practise virtue, and justice to their neighbour, and piety towards God, and thus to receive his baptism.”<br><br><b> the kingdom of heaven</b>] An expression peculiar in the N.T. to St. Matthew. The more usual one is “<i>the Kingdom of God:</i>” but “<i>the Kingdom of heaven</i>” is common in the Rabbinical writers, who do not however, except in one or two places, mean by it<i> the reign of the Messiah</i>, but<i> the Jewish religion—the theocracy</i>. Still, from the use of it by St. Matthew here, and in ch. iv. 17, x. 7, we may conclude that it was used by the Jews, and understood, to mean<i> the advent the Christ</i>, probably from the prophecy in Dan. ii. 44; vii. 13, 14, 27.
