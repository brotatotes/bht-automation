 3.   οὗτος γάρ ἐστιν ]  Not the words of the Baptist , meaning ἐγὼ γάρ εἰμι , as in John 1:23 , but  of the Evangelist; and ἐστιν is not for ἦν , but is the prophetic present, representing to us the place which the Baptist fills in the divine purposes. Of  γάρ  , Bengel says well, “Causa cur Johannes ita exoriri tum debuerit uti Mat 3:1-2 describitur, quia sic prædictum erat.” The words ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ belong in the Hebrew to ἑτοιμάσατε , but in the LXX and here to βοῶντος . The primary and literal application of this prophecy to  the  return from captivity is very doubtful. If it  ever had such an application, we may safely say that its predictions were so imperfectly and sparingly fulfilled in that return, or any thing which followed it, that we are necessarily directed onward to its greater fulfilment the announcement of the kingdom of Christ. Euthymius remarks, ὁδὸν δὲ κυρίου καὶ τρίβους αὐτοῦ καλεῖ τὰς ψυχάς , ὧν ἐπιβαίνειν ἔμελλεν ὁ λόγος τοῦ εὐαγγελίου , ἃς καὶ προτρέπεται ἑτοιμάζειν , ἤγουν καθαίρειν , τῷ ἐργαλείῳ τῆς μετανοίας ἀνασπῶντας μὲν τὰς ἀκάνθας τῶν παθῶν , ἐκρίπτοντας δὲ τοὺς λίθους τῆς ἁμαρτίας , καὶ οὕτως εὐθείας καὶ ὁμαλὰς αὐτὰς ἀπεργάζεσθαι πρὸς ὑποδοχὴν αὐτοῦ .
