<b> 7. Pharisees and Sadducees</b>] These two sects, according to Josephus, Antt. xiii. 5. 9, originated at the same period, under Jonathan the High Priest (B. C. 159–144). The PHARISEES, deriving their name probably from “<i>Parash,</i>” ‘he separated,’ took for their distinctive practice the strict observance of the law and all its requirements, written and oral. They had great power over the people, and are numbered by Josephus, as being, about the time of the death of Herod the Great, above 6000. We find in the Gospels the Pharisees the most constant opponents of our Lord, and His discourses frequently directed against them. The character of the sect as a whole was<i> hypocrisy</i>; the outside acknowledgment and honouring of God and his law, but inward and practical denial of Him; which rendered them the enemies of the simplicity and genuineness which characterized our Lord’s teaching. Still, among them were undoubtedly pious and worthy men, honourably distinguished from the mass of the sect; John iii. 1: Actsv. 34, The various points of their religious and moral belief will be treated of as they occur in the text of the Gospels.
