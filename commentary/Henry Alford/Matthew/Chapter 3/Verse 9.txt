<b> 9. think not to say</b>] Not merely equivalent to “<i>say not</i>:” but,<b> Do not fancy you may say</b>, &c. The expression<b> to say within yourselves</b>, as similar expressions in Scripture (e. g. Ps. x. 6, 11; xiv. 1: Eccl. i. 16; ii. 15, al. fr.), is used to signify the act by which outward circumstances are turned into thoughts of the mind.<br><br><b> of these stones</b>] The pebbles or shingle on the beach of the Jordan. He possibly referred to Isa. li. 1, 2. This also is prophetic, of the admission of the Gentile church. See Rom. iv. 16: Gal iii. 29. Or we may take the interpretation which Chrysostom prefers, also referring to Isa. li. 1, 2:<i> Think not that your perishing will leave Abraham without children: for God is able to raise him up children even from stones, as He created man out of dust at the beginning,</i> The<i> present</i> tenses, “<i>is laid,</i>” “<i>is cut down,</i>” imply the law, or habit, which now and henceforward, in the kingdom of heaven prevails: ‘<i>from this time it is so.</i>’<br><br><b> ll. whose shoes,</b>&c.) Lightfoot shews that it was the token of a slave having become his master’s property, to<i> loose</i> his shoe, to<i> tie</i> the same, or to<i> carry</i> the necessary articles for him to the bath. The expressions therefore in all the Gospels amount to the same.<br><br><b> with the Holy Ghost, and with fire</b>] This was literally falfilled at the day of Pentecost: but Origen and others refer the words to the baptism of the<i> righteous by the Holy Spirit</i>, and<i> of the wicked by fire</i>. I have no doubt that this this is a mistake in the present case, though apparently (to the superficial reader) borne out by ver. 12. The<i> double</i> symbolic reference of fire, elsewhere found, e.g. Mark ix. 50, as purifying the good and consuming the evil, though<i> illustrated</i> by these verses, is hardly to be pressed into the interpretation of<i> fire</i> in this verse, the prophecy<i> here</i> being solely of that higher and more perfect baptism to which that of John was a mere introduction. To separate off “<i>with the Holy Ghost</i>” as belonging to one set of persons, and “<i>with fire</i>” as belonging to another, when both are united in “<i>you,</i>” is in the last degree harsh, besides introducing confusion into the whole. The members of comparison in this verse are<i> strictly parallel</i> to one another: the<i> baptism by water</i>, the end of which is “<i>repentance,</i>” a mere transition state, a note of preparation,—and the<i> baptism by the Holy Ghost and fire</i>, the end of which is (ver. 12)<i> sanctification</i>, the entire aim and purpose of man’s creation and renewal. Thus the<i> official superiority</i> of the Redeemer (which is all that our Evangelist here deals with) is fully brought out. The superiority of<i> nature</i> and<i> pre-existence</i> is reserved for the fuller and more dogmatic account in John i.
