<p><strong> 1 12.</strong> ] PREACHING AND BAPTISM OF JOHN. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:1-8">Mark 1:1-8</span> . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:1-17">Luke 3:1-17</span> . Here the <em> synoptic narrative</em> begins, its extent being the same as that specified by Peter in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span> , ‘ <em> from the baptism of John unto that same day that He was taken up from us</em> .’ For a critical comparison of the narratives in the various sections, see notes on St. Mark. In <em> this</em> Gospel, I have generally confined myself to the <em> subject matter</em> .</p>
