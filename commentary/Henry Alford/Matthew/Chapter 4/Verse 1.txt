<b> 1. led up of (by) the spirit</b>] The Spirit carried Him away, (see Acts viii. 39,) “<i>driveth him,</i>” Mark i. 12. Had St. Luke’s “<i>was led in</i> (thus literally)<i> the Spirit</i>” been our<i> only</i> account, we might have supposed what took place to have been done<i> in a vision</i>: but the expressions in the two other Evangelists entirely preclude this. The<i> desert</i> here spoken of may either be the traditional place of the Temptation near Jericho (thence called<i> Quarantaria</i>: it is described in “The Land and the Book,” p. 617, as a high and precipitous mountain, with its side facin the plain perpendicular, and apparently as high as the rock of Gibraltar, and with caverns midway below, hewn in the rock), or as scripture parallelism between Moses, Elias, and our Lord, leads one to think, the<i> Arabian desert of Sinai</i>.<b> to be tempted</b>] The express<i> purpose</i> of His being<i> led up</i>. Hence it is evident that our Lord this time wes not ‘led up’ of his own will and design: but, as a part of the conflict with the Power of Darkness, He was<i> brought</i> to the Temptation. As He had been subject to his earthly parents at Nazareth, so now He is subject, in the outset of his official course, to His Heavenly Parent, and is by His will thus carried up to be tempted. In reverently considering the nature and end of this temptation, we may observe, (1) That the whole is<i> undoubtedly an objective historical narrative</i>, recording an actual conflict between our Redeemer and the Power of Evil. (2) That it is undetermined by the<i> letter</i> of the sacred text, whether the Tempter appeared<i> in a bodily shape</i>, or,<i> as a spirit</i>, was permitted to exert a certain power, as in ver. 5, and ver. 8, over the person of our Lord, even as the Holy Spirit did in ver. 1. If the latter were the case, the words spoken at the various of the temptation, were suggested by this Evil Power to the soul of our Redeemer. But (3) such an interpretation, while it cannot justly be accused of unreality by any who do not reject belief in the spiritual world, hardly meets the expressions of the text, “<i>came</i> (approached)<i> to him,</i>” ver. 9, and “<i>leaveth him</i>” ver. 11. Nor do the two members of ver. 11 correspond to one another in this case, for the angels must have been visible and corporeal, as in the parallel case at Gethsemane, Luke xxii. 43.
