<b> 10.</b>] Our Lord at once repels him openly; not that He did not<i> know him before</i>,—but because he had<i> thus openly</i> tempted Him; but not even this of His own power or will; He adds,<i> for</i> it is written,—again, as Man, appealing to the word of God.—From this time, our Lord is<i> known</i> by the devils, and casts them out by a word. Mark i. 24, 34; iii. 11; v. 7.
