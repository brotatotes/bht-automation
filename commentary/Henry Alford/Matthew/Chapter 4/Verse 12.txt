<b> 12. delivered up</b>] This seems to have been the usual and well-known term for the imprisonment of John. The same word in the original is also the usual one for the betrayal and apprehension of our Lord Himself.<br><br><b> departed</b>]<b> re-tired, withdrew</b>; see ch. ii. 22, and note. No notice is given<i> whence</i> this withdrawal took place. The narrative is evidently taken up after an interval, and without any intention that it should follow closely on ver. 11. Wieseler sees in this a proof that St. Matthew recognized a ministry in Jud√¶a during the interval. I cannot quite think this, but certainly he does not<i> exclude</i> it.
