	 Καφαρναούμ ] This town, on the borders of the lake of Gennesaret, was central in situation, and in the most populous and frequented part of Galilee. It besides was the residence of four at least of the Apostles, Andrew and Peter, and James and John and probably of Matthew. The town was named from a fountain, πρὸς γὰρ τῇ τῶν ἀέρων εὐκρασίῃ καὶ πηγῇ διάρδεται γονιμωτάτῃ , Καφαρναοὺμ αὐτὴν οἱ ἐπιχώριοι καλοῦσι (Joseph. B. J. iii. 10. 8), כְּפַר נַחוּם ,  vicus consolationis . It is from this time called ‘  His own city ,’ ch. Matthew 9:1 , see also ch. Matthew 17:24 .
