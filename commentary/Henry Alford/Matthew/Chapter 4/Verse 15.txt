 15. ] This prophecy is spoken with direct reference to the days of the Messiah. It is here freely rendered from the Hebrew, without any regard to the LXX, which is wholly different. This, coming so immediately after a string of quotations literally from the LXX, seems to mark the beginning of a new portion of the Gospel, agreeably to what was said before.
	 ὁδὸν θαλάσσης ] the country round the coast of the lake. All the members of this sentence are in apposition with one another: thus  πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδ  . is not a description of the land before spoken of, which was not thus situated, but of a different tract. The later meaning of מֵעֵבֶר לַיַּרְדֵּן , as signifying the tract to the west of the Jordan, and which naturally sprung up during the captivity, is not to be thought of in Isaiah, who wrote before that event. See 1Ch 26:30 in the Hebrew, where, however, the E. V. renders ‘on  this side Jordan westward.’ Meyer [in edd. 1, 2; in edd. 3, 4, 5 he renders ὁδ . θαλ . ‘  seawards .’ See Moulton’s Winer, p. 289, note 4] strangely makes ὁδὸν θαλ . the objective after εἶδεν understood, and construes ‘  the land of Zabulon and Nepthalim saw the way of the sea on the other side of the Jordan: Galilee of the Gentiles, &c. saw a great light: ’ i.e. ‘the light which went forth from Capernaum when Jesus dwelt there, is represented as sending its bright beams over the Galilæan sea, so that Zabulon and Nephthalim by this light could see the way leading along the other side of the sea.’
	 Γαλ  .   τ  .   ἐθν  . ]  Galilee superior , near to Tyre and Sidon, which was inhabited by a variety of nations.
