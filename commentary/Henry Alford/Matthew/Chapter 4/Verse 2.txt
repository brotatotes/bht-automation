 2.   νηστεύσας ] Not in the wider ecclesiastical sense of the word, but its strict meaning, of  abstaining from all food whatever; οὐκ ἔφαγεν οὐδὲν ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις , Luke 4:2 . Similarly Moses, Exodus 34:28 , ἦν ἐναντίον κυρίου τεσσαράκοντα ἡμ . κ . τεσ . νύκ .· ἄρτον οὐκ ἔφαγε , καὶ ὕδωρ οὐκ ἔπιε , and Elias ἐπορεύθη ἐν ἰσχύϊ τῆς βρώσεως ἐκείνης τεσ . ἡ . καὶ τεσ . ν ., 3 Kings Matthew 19:8 .
	 ὕστερον ἐπείν  . ] Then probably  not during the time itself . The period of the fast, as in the case of Moses, was spent in a spiritual ecstasy, during which the wants of the natural body were suspended.
