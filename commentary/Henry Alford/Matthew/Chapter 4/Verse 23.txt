 23.   συναγωγαῖς ] These were the places of religious assembly among the Jews after the return from the captivity. Tradition, and the Targums, ascribe a very early origin to synagogues; and Deuteronomy 31:11 , and Psalms 74:8 , are cited as testimonies of it. But the former passage does not necessarily imply it: and it is doubtful whether that Psalm was not itself written after the captivity. They are generally supposed to have originated in Babylon, and thence to have been brought, at the return, into the mother land. See Nehemiah 8:1-8 . At the Christian era there were synagogues in every town, and in some larger towns several. See Acts 9:2 ; Acts 9:20 . In Jerusalem, according to the Rabbinical writings, there were upwards of 450. (See Acts 6:9 , and note.) The people assembled in them on sabbath and festival days, and in later times also on the second and fifth days of each week, for public prayer and the hearing of portions of Scripture. τῶν ἱερέων δέ τις ὁ παρὼν ἢ τῶν γερόντων εἷς ἀναγινώσκει τοὺς ἱεροὺς νόμους αὐτοῖς καὶ καθ ʼ ἕκαστον ἐξηγεῖται μέχρι σχεδὸν δείλης ὀψίας . Philo, Fragm. vol. ii. p. 630 (Euseb. Prep. Evang. viii. 7, vol. iii. p. 359). See Luke 4:16 ; Acts 13:15 . The officers of the synagogues were (1) the ἀρχισυναγωγός , Luke 8:49 ; Luke 13:14 ; Acts 18:8 ; Acts 18:17 , who had the care of public order, and the arrangement of the service; (2) the Elders, πρεσβύτεροι Luke 7:3 , ἀρχισυναγωγοί Mark 5:22 ; Acts 13:15 , who seem to have formed a sort of council under the presidency of the ἀρχισυναγωγ  ός ; (3) the  legatus or  angelus ecclesiæ , who was the reader of prayers, and also secretary and messenger of the synagogues; (4) the ὑπηρέτης ( Luk 4:20 ), or chapel clerk, whose office was to prepare the books for reading, to sweep, open, and shut the synagogue. Besides these, there appear to have been alms-gatherers. The synagogue was fitted up with seats, of which the first row ( πρωτοκαθεδρίαι ) were an object of ambition with the scribes (ch. Mat 23:6 ). A pulpit for the reader, lamps, and a chest for keeping the sacred books, appear to complete the furniture of the ancient synagogue. Punishments, e.g. scourging, were inflicted in the synagogues. (See ch. Matthew 10:17 ; Matthew 23:34 : Luke 9:49 ; Acts 22:19 ; Acts 26:11 .) The catechizing also of children seems to have taken place there (Lightfoot, xi. 281), as also disputations on religious questions. Our Lord was allowed to read and teach in the synagogues, although of mean extraction according to the flesh, because of His miracles, and His supposed character as the professed leader and teacher of a religious sect.
