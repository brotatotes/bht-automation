<p><strong> 24. </strong> <strong> Συρίαν</strong> ] Answering to ὅλην τὴν περίχωρον τῆς Γαλιλαίας , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:28">Mark 1:28</span> . On <strong> βάσανος</strong> <strong> ,</strong> see Lexx. Our word ‘ <em> trial</em> ’ has undergone a change of meaning very similar. On the δαιμονιζόμενοι see note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:28">Matthew 8:28</span> . The σεληνιαζόμενοι were probably <em> epileptics:</em> see an instance in ch. Mat 17:14 and [31] .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [31] When, in the Gospels, and in the Evangelic statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23-25">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</span> , the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place</em> in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated <em> at the head of the note</em> on the paragraph. When the sign (║) is <em> qualified</em> , thus, ‘║ Mk.,’ or ‘║ Mt. Mk.,’ &amp;c., it is signified that the word occurs <em> in the parallel place in that Gospel or Gospels, but not in the other or others</em> .</p>
