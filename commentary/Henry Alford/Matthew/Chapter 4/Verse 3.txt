<b> 3. when the tempter came</b>] From the words of both St. Mark and St. Luke, it appears that our Lord was tempted<i> also during the forty days</i>. Whether the words of St. Mark, “<i>he was with the wild beasts,</i>” allude to<i> one kind</i> of temptation, is uncertain: see note on Mark i. 13.—The words “<i>came to him</i>” need not be understood of the<i> first</i> approach, but the first<i> recorded</i>— ‘at a certain time the tempter approaching, &c’<br><br><b> If thou be</b>] “thinking to beguile Him with his flattery,” Chrys. Or, as Euthymius, “thinking that He would be irritated by this address, as being reproached with not being the Son of God.” At all events, there is no<i> doubt</i> expressed, as some think.<br><br><b> Son of God</b>] Our Lord does not give way to the temptation, so as to meet him with an open declaration, ‘I am the Son of God:’ thus indeed He might have asserted his lordship over him, but not have been<i> his Conqueror for us</i>. The first word which He uses against him, reaches far deeper: ‘<i>Man</i> shall not live,’&c. “This, like the other text, is taken from the history of Israel’s temptation in the wilderness: for Israel represents, in a foreshadowing type, the Son of Man, the servant of God Righteousness, the one that was<i> to come</i>, in whom alone that nature which in all men has degenerated into sin, ‘<i>fulfils all righteousness</i>’ Adam stood not,—Israel according to the flesh stood not,—when the Lord their God tempted them: but rather, after Satan’s likeness, tempted their God: but now the second Adam is come, the true Israel, by whose obedience the<i> way of life</i> is again made known and opened— “that man truly liveth on and in the eternal word of God.’ Stier’s “Words of the Lord Jesus.” Observe also how our Lord resists Satan<i> in His humanity</i>; 3 at once here numbering Himself with<i> men</i>, by adducing “<i>man</i>” as including His own case; and not only so, but thus speaking out the mystery of his humiliation, in which He had foregone his divine Power, of his own will.—By ‘<i>every word</i> (or ‘<i>thing,</i>’ for the noun is not expressed in the original)<i> that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</i>’ we must understand,<i> every arrangement of the divine will</i>; God, who ordinarily sustains<i> by bread</i>, can, if it please Him, sustain by<i> any other means</i>, as in the case alluded to.
