 4. ] Our Lord does not give way to the temptation, so as to meet him with an open declaration, ‘I am the Son of God:’ thus indeed He might have asserted his Lordship over him, but not have been  his Conqueror for us . The first word which He uses against him, reaches far deeper: ‘  Man shall not live, &c.’ “This, like the other text, is taken from the history of Israel’s temptation in the wilderness: for Israel represents, in a foreshadowing type, the Son of Man, the servant of God for Righteousness, the one ἐρχόμενος , in whom alone that nature which in all men has degenerated into sin, πληροῖ πᾶσαν δικαιοσύνην . Adam stood not, Israel according to the flesh stood not, when the Lord their God tempted them: but rather, after Satan’s likeness, tempted their God: but now the second Adam is come, the true Israel, by whose obedience the  way of life is again made known and opened ‘that man truly liveth on and in the eternal word of God.’ ” Stier’s Reden Jesu, vol. i. p. 16 (edn. 2). Observe also how our Lord resists Satan  in His humanity; at once here numbering Himself with  men , by adducing ὁ ἄνθρωπος as including His own case; and not only so, but thus speaking out the mystery of his humiliation, in which He had foregone his divine Power, of his own will. By ‘  every word (or ‘  thing ,’ for ῥῆμα is not expressed in the original)  that proceedeth out of the mouth of God ,’ we must understand,  every arrangement of the divine will; God, who ordinarily sustains by  bread , can, if it please Him, sustain  by any other means , as in the case alluded to. Compare John 4:32 ; John 4:34 .
