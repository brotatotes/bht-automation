<p><strong> 5. </strong> <strong> τότε παρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Power being most probably given to the tempter over the person of our Lord. In St. Luke, this temptation stands <em> third</em> . The real order is evidently that in the text; for otherwise our Lord’s final answer, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:10">Matthew 4:10</span> , would not be in its place. It may be observed, that St. Luke makes no assertion as to succession, only introducing each temptation with καί : whereas τότε and πάλιν here seem to mark succession. Bishop Ellicott, for psychological reasons, which must be most untrustworthy when opposed to the express assertion of the sacred text ( <strong> τότε</strong> ἀφίησιν αὐτόν ), follows the order in St. Luke. For <strong> ἁγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πόλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> see reff. <strong> ἔστησεν</strong> by the same power by which he brought Him.

<p><strong> πτερύγιον</strong> ] Abundant instances have been produced to shew that πτέρον was applied to a <em> pointed roof</em> or <em> gable</em> . Now the LXX use πτέρυξ and πτερύγιον as synonymous with πτέρον ; why may not the same be done in the N.T.? The general opinion, that our Lord was placed on <em> Herod’s royal portico</em> , described in Jos. Antt. xv. 11. 5, is probably right; and the <strong> τό</strong> is in no way inconsistent with it. That portico overhung the ravine of Kedron from a dizzy height, ὡς , εἴ τις ἀπ ʼ ἄκρου τοῦ ταύτης τέγους , ἄμφω συντιθεὶς τὰ βάθη , διοπτεύοι , σκοτοδινιᾷν , οὐκ ἐξικνουμένης τῆς ὄψεως εἰς ἀμέτρητον τὸν βυθόν . The argument that it was probably <em> on the other side, next the court</em> , is grounded on the perfectly gratuitous assumption, that an <em> exhibition to the people</em> was intended. There is no authority for this in the text; the temptation being one not of ambition, but of <em> presumption</em> . The inference from Eusebius, who, quoting Hegesippus, (Hist. ii. 23,) describes James the Just as set on and thrown from τὸ πτερύγιον τοῦ ναοῦ , among the people, is not decisive: for this term might embrace either side, as ‘the cornice,’ or ‘the parapet’ would.</p>
