 5.   τότε παρ  . ] Power being most probably given to the tempter over the person of our Lord. In St. Luke, this temptation stands  third . The real order is evidently that in the text; for otherwise our Lord’s final answer, Matthew 4:10 , would not be in its place. It may be observed, that St. Luke makes no assertion as to succession, only introducing each temptation with καί : whereas τότε and πάλιν here seem to mark succession. Bishop Ellicott, for psychological reasons, which must be most untrustworthy when opposed to the express assertion of the sacred text (  τότε ἀφίησιν αὐτόν ), follows the order in St. Luke. For  ἁγ  .   πόλ  . see reff.  ἔστησεν by the same power by which he brought Him.
	 πτερύγιον ] Abundant instances have been produced to shew that πτέρον was applied to a  pointed roof or  gable . Now the LXX use πτέρυξ and πτερύγιον as synonymous with πτέρον ; why may not the same be done in the N.T.? The general opinion, that our Lord was placed on  Herod’s royal portico , described in Jos. Antt. xv. 11. 5, is probably right; and the  τό is in no way inconsistent with it. That portico overhung the ravine of Kedron from a dizzy height, ὡς , εἴ τις ἀπ ʼ ἄκρου τοῦ ταύτης τέγους , ἄμφω συντιθεὶς τὰ βάθη , διοπτεύοι , σκοτοδινιᾷν , οὐκ ἐξικνουμένης τῆς ὄψεως εἰς ἀμέτρητον τὸν βυθόν . The argument that it was probably  on the other side, next the court , is grounded on the perfectly gratuitous assumption, that an  exhibition to the people was intended. There is no authority for this in the text; the temptation being one not of ambition, but of  presumption . The inference from Eusebius, who, quoting Hegesippus, (Hist. ii. 23,) describes James the Just as set on and thrown from τὸ πτερύγιον τοῦ ναοῦ , among the people, is not decisive: for this term might embrace either side, as ‘the cornice,’ or ‘the parapet’ would.
