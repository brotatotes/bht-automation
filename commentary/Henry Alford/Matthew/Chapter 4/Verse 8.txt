<b> 8.</b>] The enquiry where and what this mountain was, is entirely nugatory, no data being furnished by the text.<br><br><b> sheweth him all the k. of the world</b>] The additional words in Luke, “<i>in a moment of time,</i>” are valuable as pointing out to us clearly the supernatural character of the vision. If it be objected, that in that case there was no need for the ascent of the mountain,—I answer, that such natural accessories are made use of frequently in supernatural revelations: see especially Rev. xxi. 10. The attempts to restrict “the world” to<i> Palestine</i>, (which was, besides, God’s peculiar portion and vineyard,<i> as distinguished from</i> the Gentile world,) or<i> the Roman</i> empire, are mere subterfuges: as is also the giving to “sheweth” the sense of “points out the direction of.”<br><br> In this last temptation the enemy reveals himself openly, as the Prince of this world, and as the father of lies: for though power is given him over this world and its sons, his assertion here is most untrue.
