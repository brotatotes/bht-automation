 12.   ὁ μισθὸς ὑμ  . ] A reward, not of debt, but of grace, as the parable in ch. Matthew 20:1 ff. clearly represents it. ‘An expression,’ as De Wette observes, ‘taken from our earthly commerce, and applied to spiritual things;’ in which however we must remember, that the principal reference is to God as the giver, and not to us as the deservers: see the parable above cited, where the μισθός is not what was  earned , but what was  covenanted . ‘Deus est debitor noster non ex commisso, sed ex promisso.’ Aug [40] (Tholuck.) These words,  ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς  , must not be taken as having any bearing on the question as to the  future habitation of the glorified saints. Their use in this and similar expressions is not  local , but  spiritual , indicating the blessed state when ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν shall have fully come. The local question is to be decided by wholly different testimonies of Scripture; by the general tenor of prophecy, and the analogies of the divine dealings: and all of these seem to point rather to this earth, purified and renewed, than to  the heavens in any ordinary sense of the term, as the eternal habitation of the blessed.

	 ἐδίωξαν ] For instance, Jeremiah was scourged, Jeremiah 20:2 ; Zechariah son of Jehoiada was stoned, 2 Chronicles 24:21 ; Isaiah, according to Jewish tradition, was sawn asunder by Manasseh.
	The reasoning implied in γάρ may be thus filled up: “and great will be  their reward in heaven.”
