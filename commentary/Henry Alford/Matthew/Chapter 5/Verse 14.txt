<b> 14. the light of the world</b>] And yet only in a lower and derivative sense; Christ Himself being “<i>the true light which lighteth every man,</i>” John i. 9; “the light of the world,” viii. 12. His ministers are “<i>candles,</i>” John v. 35, and “lights,” Phil. ii. 15,<i> receiving</i> their light, and only burning<i> for a time</i>: lights<i> lighted</i>, whereas He is Light<i> lighting</i>, as Augustine. And here too, light in this verse = candle in ver. 15, where the comparison is resumed. so also Eph. v. 8:—<b>light</b>,<i> as partaking of His Light</i>: for every thing lighted (see note, ib. ver. 13) is light.
