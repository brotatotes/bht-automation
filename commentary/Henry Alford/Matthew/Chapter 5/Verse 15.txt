 15.   μόδιον ] A Latin word (the art. is by many supposed to express that the μόδιος is a vessel usually found in the house: but it is rather to be regarded as the sign of the  generic singular , as in κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον , ch. Mat 15:20 ) called by the more general name σκεῦος , Luke 8:16 .
	 καίουσιν  , i.e.  men in general: shewing, in the spiritual reference of the parable, that these lights of the world are ‘  lighted ’ by Him for whose use they are. See above.
