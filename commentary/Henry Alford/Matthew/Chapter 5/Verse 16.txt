<b> 16. so</b>] i.e.<i> like a candle on a candlestick—like a city on a hill</i>; not merely, ‘so... that,’ as our English version seems rather to imply. By rendering in like manner, the ambiguity will be avoided. The sense of this verse is as if it were “<i>that, seeing your good works they may&c.</i>”... the<i> latter</i> verb, and not the former, carrying the purpose of the action. Thus the praise and glory of a well-lighted and brillant feast would be given, not to the lights, but to the master of the house; and of a stately city on a hill, not to the buildings, but to those who built them.
