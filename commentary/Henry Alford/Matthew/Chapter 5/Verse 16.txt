<b> 16. so</b>] i.e.<i> like a candle on a candlestick—like a city on a hill</i>; not merely, ‘so... that,’ as our English version seems rather to imply. By rendering in like manner, the ambiguity will be avoided. The sense of this verse is as if it were “<i>that, seeing your good works they may&c.</i>”... the<i> latter</i> verb, and not the former, carrying the purpose of the action. Thus the praise and glory of a well-lighted and brillant feast would be given, not to the lights, but to the master of the house; and of a stately city on a hill, not to the buildings, but to those who built them.<br><br> The whole of this division of our Lord’s sermon is addressed to<i> all His followers</i>, not exclusively to the ministers of his word. All servants of Christ are the salt of the earth, the light of the world (Phil. ii. 15). And all that is here said applies to us all. But à fortiori does it apply in its highest sense, to those who are, among Christians, selected to teach and be examples; who are as it were the towers and pinnacles of the city, not only not hid, but seen far and wide above the rest.
