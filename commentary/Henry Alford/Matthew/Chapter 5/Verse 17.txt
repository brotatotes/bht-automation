<b> 17. I am come</b>] more properly,<b> I came</b>. Observe how our Lord, through the whole sermon, sets forth Himself, in his proceeding forth from God, as truly “<i>He that was to come.</i>”<br><br><b> the law, or the prophets</b>] It is a question whether our Lord includes the<i> prophecies</i>, properly so called, in His meaning here. I think<i> not</i>: for no person professing himself to be the Messiah would be thought to<i> contradict the prophecies</i>, but<i> to fulfil them</i>. Neither, it appears, does He<i> here</i> allude to the<i> sacrificial</i> and<i> typical</i> parts of the law, but to the<i> moral</i> parts of both the law and the prophets; which indeed he proceeds to cite and particularize. If however we prefer to include both ceremonial and moral in this assertion, we may understand it in its more general sense, as applying, beyond the instances here given, to His typical fulfilment of the law, which could not as yet be unfolded.<br><br><b> to fulfil</b>] This verb implies more than the<i> mere fulfilling</i>: it has the sense of<b> filling out</b> or expanding: i.e. here, giving a deeper and holier sense to—fulfilling in the<i> spirit</i>, which is nobler than the letter. Theophylact compares the ancient law to a<i> sketch</i>, which the painter does not wipe out, but fills in. The gnostic Marcion characteristically enough maintained that the Judaizing Christians had altered this verse, and that it originally stood,—think ye that I came to<i> fulfil</i>, &c.? I came to<i> destroy</i>, not to<i> fulfil</i>.
