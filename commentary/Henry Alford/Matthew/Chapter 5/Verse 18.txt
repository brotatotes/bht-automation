<b> 18. verily</b>] literally,<b> Amen</b>: equivalent to “<i>truly</i>” in St. Luke, ix. 27; xii. 44; xxi. 3.<b> jot (Iota)</b> is the Hebrew Jod, the smallest letter in the alphabet:<b> tittles</b>, literally<b> horns</b>,<i> horn-like projections</i>, are the little turns of the strokes by which one Hebrew letter differs from another similar to it. The Rabbinical writings have many sayings similar in sentiment to this, but spoken of the<i> literal</i> written law.<br><br> It is important to observe in<i> these days</i> how the Lord here<i> includes</i><i> the O.T. and all its unfolding of the divine purposes regarding Himself, in His teaching</i> of the citizens of the kingdom of heaven. I say this, because it is always in<i> contempt and setting aside of the O.T.</i> that rationalism has begun. First,<i> its historical truth</i>—then<i> its theocratic dispensation</i> and the<i> types</i> and<i> prophecies</i> connected with it, are swept away; so that Christ came to fulfil nothing, and becomes only a teacher or a martyr: and thus the way is paved for a similar rejection of the N.T.;—beginning with the narratives of the birth and infancy, as theocratic myths—advancing to the denial of His miracles—then attacking the truthfulness of His own sayings which are grounded on the O.T. as a revelation from God—and so finally leaving us nothing in the Scriptures but, as a German writer of this school has expressed it, ‘a mythology not so attractive as that of Greece.’ That this is the course which unbelief<i> has run</i> in Germany, should be a pregnant warning to the decriers of the O.T. among ourselves. It should be a maxim for every expositor and every student, that Scripture is a<i> whole</i>, and stands or falls together. That this is now beginning to be deeply felt in Germany, we have cheering testimonies in the later editions of their best Commentators, and in the valuable work of Stier on the discourses of our Lord. [Since however these words were first written, we have had lamentable proof in England, that their warnings were not unneeded. The course of unbelief which has issued in the publication of the volume entitled “Essays and Reviews,” has been in character and progress, exactly that above described: and owing to the injudicious treatment which has multiplied tenfold the circulation of that otherwise contemptible work, its fallacies are now in the hands and mouths of thousands, who, from the low standard of intelligent Scriptural knowledge among us, will never have the means of answering them. 1862. To this it may now be added, that even a Bishop of the Church of England has come before the world as a champion of that unbelief, in its first phase as described above. We may hope that his work, judging from the blunders already in the renderings of Hebrew words on which his arguments are founded, will soon be added to the catalogue of attacks by which the enemies of our holy faith have damaged nothing save their own reputation and influence. 1863.]
