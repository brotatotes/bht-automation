<b> 19.</b>] There is little difficulty in this verse, if we consider it in connexion with the verse preceding, to which it is bound by the<b> therefore</b> and the<b> these</b>, and with the following, to which the<b> for</b> (ver. 20) unites it. Bearing this in mind, we see (1) that<b> break</b>, on account of what follows in ver. 20 and after, must be taken in the higher sense, as referring to the<i> spirit</i> and not the letter:<b> whosoever shall break</b> (have broken), in the sense presently to be laid down. (2) That<b> these least commandments</b> refers to<b> one jot or tittle</b> above, and means one of these minute commands which seem as insignificant, in comparison with the greater, as the<i> jot</i> and<i> tittle</i> in comparison with great portions of writing. (3) That<b> shall be called least</b> does not mean ‘<i>shall be excluded from,</i>” inasmuch as the question is not of<i> keeping or not keeping</i> the commandments of in a legal sense, but of<i> appreciating, and causing others to appreciate</i>, the import and weight of even the most insignificant parts of God’s revelation of Himself to man; and rather therefore applies to teachers than to Christians in general, though to them also through the “<i>break</i>” and “<i>do.</i>” (4) That<i> no deduction can be drawn from these words, binding the Jewish law, or any part of it, as such, upon Christians</i>. That this is so, is plainly shewn by what follows, where our Lord proceeds to pour upon the letter of the law the fuller light of the spirit of the Gospel: thus lifting and expanding (not destroying) every jot and tittle of that precursory dispensation into its fall meaning in the life and practice of the Christian; who, by the indwelling of the divine Teacher, God’s Holy Spirit, is led into all truth and purity. (5) That<i> these words of our Lord are decisive against such persons,</i> whether ancient or modern<i>, as would set aside the Old Testament as without significance, or inconsistent with the New</i>. See the preceding note, and the Book of Common Prayer, Article vii.<br><br> On<b> shall be called</b>, see note on ver. 9.<br><br><b> 20.</b>) An expansion of the idea contained<b> fulfil</b>, ver. 17, and of the difference between<b> break</b>, which the Scribes and Pharisees did by enforcing the letter to the neglect of the spirit—and<b> do and teach</b>, in which particulars Christians were to exceed the Pharisees, the punctilious observers, and the Scribes, the traditional expounders of the law.<br><br><b> righteousness</b>,<i> purity of heart and life</i>, as set forth by example in the doing, and by precept in the teaching. The whole of the rest of our Lord’s sermon is a comment on, and illustration of, the assertion in this verse.<br><br><b> scribes</b>] Persons devoted to the work of reading and expounding the law, whose office seems first to have become frequent after the return from Babylon. They generally appear in the N.T. in connexion with the Pharisees: but it appears from Acts xxiii. 9, that there were Scribes attached to the other sects also. In Matt. xxi. 15, they appear with the chief priests; but it is in the<i> temple</i>, where (see also Luke xx. 1) they acted as a sort of police. In the description of the assembling of the great Sanhedrim (Matt. xxvi. 3: Mark xiv. 53; xv. 1) we find it composed of c<i> hief priests</i>,<i> elders</i>, and<i> Scribes</i>: and in Luke xxii. 66, of<i> chief priests</i> and<i> Scribes</i>. The Scribes uniformly opposed themselves to our Lord; watching Him to find matter of accusation, Luke vi. 7; xi. 53, 54; perverting His sayings, Matt. ix. 3, and His actions, Luke v. 30; xv. 2; seeking to entangle Him by questions, Matt. xxii. 35 (see note there); Luke x. 25; xx. 21; and to embarrass Him, Matt. xii. 38. Their authority as expounders of the law is recognized by our Lord Himself, Matt. xxiii. 1, 2; their adherence to the oral traditionary exposition proved, Matt. xv. 1 ff.; the respect in which they were held by the people shewn, Luke xx. 46; their existence indicated not only in Jerusalem, but also in Galilee, Luke v. 17,—and in Rome, Josephus, Antt. xviii. 3. 5. They kept schools and auditories for teaching the youth, Luke ii. 46; Acts v. 34, compared with xxii. 3; are called by Josephus<i> expounders of our patriarchal laws</i>, Antt. xvii. 6. 2;<i> sophists</i>, B.J. i. 33. 2. The literal rendering is “<b>shall abound more than the Scribes and Pharisees,</b>” i.e. more than that<i> of the S.</i> and<i> P.</i> Notice, that not only the<i> hypocrites</i> among the Scribes and Pharisees are here meant; but the declaration is, “Your righteousness must be of a<i> higher order</i> than any yet attained, or conceived, by Scribe or Pharisee.”<br><br><b> ye shall in no case enter, &c.</b>] A very usual formula (see ch. vii. 21; xviii. 3; xix. 17, 23, 24: John iii. 5 al.); implying exclusion from the blessings of the Christian state, and from the inheritance of eternal life.
