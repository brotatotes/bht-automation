<b> 19.</b>] There is little difficulty in this verse, if we consider it in connexion with the verse preceding, to which it is bound by the<b> therefore</b> and the<b> these</b>, and with the following, to which the<b> for</b> (ver. 20) unites it. Bearing this in mind, we see (1) that<b> break</b>, on account of what follows in ver. 20 and after, must be taken in the higher sense, as referring to the<i> spirit</i> and not the letter:<b> whosoever shall break</b> (have broken), in the sense presently to be laid down. (2) That<b> these least commandments</b> refers to<b> one jot or tittle</b> above, and means one of these minute commands which seem as insignificant, in comparison with the greater, as the<i> jot</i> and<i> tittle</i> in comparison with great portions of writing. (3) That<b> shall be called least</b> does not mean ‘<i>shall be excluded from,</i>” inasmuch as the question is not of<i> keeping or not keeping</i> the commandments of in a legal sense, but of<i> appreciating, and causing others to appreciate</i>, the import and weight of even the most insignificant parts of God’s revelation of Himself to man; and rather therefore applies to teachers than to Christians in general, though to them also through the “<i>break</i>” and “<i>do.</i>” (4) That<i> no deduction can be drawn from these words, binding the Jewish law, or any part of it, as such, upon Christians</i>. That this is so, is plainly shewn by what follows, where our Lord proceeds to pour upon the letter of the law the fuller light of the spirit of the Gospel: thus lifting and expanding (not destroying) every jot and tittle of that precursory dispensation into its fall meaning in the life and practice of the Christian; who, by the indwelling of the divine Teacher, God’s Holy Spirit, is led into all truth and purity. (5) That<i> these words of our Lord are decisive against such persons,</i> whether ancient or modern<i>, as would set aside the Old Testament as without significance, or inconsistent with the New</i>.
