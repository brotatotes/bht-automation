 2.   ἀνοίξας τὸ στ  .   αὐ  . ] as in reff., a solemn introduction to some discourse or advice of importance.
	 αὐτούς ] i.e. τοὺς μαθητάς . The discourse (see Matthew 5:13-14 ; Matthew 5:20 ; Matthew 5:48 ; ch. Matthew 6:9 ; Mat 7:6 ) was spoken directly to the disciples, but (see Mat 7:28-29 ) also generally to the multitudes. It is a divine commentary on the words with which His own and the Baptist’s preaching opened: μετανοεῖτε · ἤγγικεν γὰρ ἡ βασ . τ . οὐρανῶν . It divides itself into various great sections, which see below.
