 20. ] An expansion of the idea contained in πληρῶσαι , Matthew 5:17 , and of the difference between λύσῃ , which the Scribes and Pharisees did by enforcing the letter to the neglect of the spirit and ποιήσῃ καὶ διδάξῃ , in which particulars Christians were to exceed the Pharisees, the punctilious observers, and the Scribes, the traditional expounders of the law.
	 δικαιοσύνη  ,  purity of heart and life , as set forth by example in the ποιοῦντες , and by precept in the διδάσκοντες . The whole of the rest of our Lord’s sermon is a comment on, and illustration of, the assertion in this verse.
	 γραμματέων ] Persons devoted to the work of reading and expounding the law (Heb. סֹפֵר ), whose office seems first to have become frequent after the return from Babylon. They generally appear in the N.T. in connexion with the Pharisees: but it appears from Acts 23:9 , that there were Scribes attached to the other sects also. In Matthew 21:15 , they appear with the chief priests; but it is in the  temple , where (see also Luk 20:1 ) they acted as a sort of police. In the description of the assembling of the great Sanhedrim (Matthew 26:3 ; Mark 14:53 ; Mar 15:1 ) we find it composed of ἀρχιερεῖς , πρεσβύτεροι , and γραμματεῖς ; and in Luke 22:66 , of ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ γραμματεῖς . The Scribes uniformly opposed themselves to our Lord; watching Him to find matter of accusation, Luke 6:7 ; Luke 11:53-54 ; perverting His sayings, Matthew 9:3 , and His actions, Luke 5:30 ; Luke 15:2 ; seeking to entangle Him by questions, Matthew 22:35 (see note there): Luke 10:25 ; Luke 20:21 ; and to embarrass Him, Matthew 12:38 . Their authority as expounders of the law is recognized by our Lord Himself, Matthew 23:1-2 ; their adherence to the oral traditionary exposition proved, Matthew 15:1 ff.; the respect in which they were held by the people shewn, Luke 20:46 ; their existence indicated not only in Jerusalem but also in Galilee, Luke 5:17 , and in Rome, Josephus, Antt. xviii. 3. 5. They kept schools and auditories for teaching the youth, Luke 2:46 ; Acts 5:34 , compared with Matthew 22:3 ; are called by Josephus πατρίων ἐξηγηταὶ νόμων , Antt. xvii. 6. 2; σοφισταί , B. J. i. 33. 2. The construction πλεῖον τῶν γραμματέων καὶ τῶν Φαρισαίων elliptically for πλ . τῆς δικαιοσύνης τ . γρ . κ . τ . Φ ., is illustrated in Kühner (Gram. ii. § 749) under the name of ‘comparatio compendiaria,’ by Hom. Il. φ . 191, κρείσσων δ ʼ αὖτε Διὸς γενεὴ ποταμοῖο τέτυκται ; Pindar, Olymp. i. init., μηδ ʼ Ὀλυμπίας ἀγῶνα φέρτερον αὐδάσομεν , &c. Notice, that not only the  hypocrites among the Scribes and Pharisees are here meant; but the declaration is, “Your righteousness must be of a  higher order than any yet attained, or conceived, by Scribe or Pharisee.”
	 οὐ μὴ εἰσέλ  . ] A very usual formula (see ch. Matthew 7:21 ; Matthew 18:3 ; Matthew 19:17 ; Matthew 19:23-24 : Joh 3:5 alli [47] .): implying exclusion from the blessings of the Christian state, and from the inheritance of eternal life.
