<b> 21. Ye have heard</b>] viz. by the reading of the law in the synagogues, and the expositions of the Scribes.<br><br><b> by them of old time</b>] In this case, Moses and his traditional expounders are classed together; but the words may also be rendered, ‘<i>to</i> the ancients,’—which last interpretation seems to me to be certainly the right one. Meyer has well observed that “it was said to them of old time” corresponds to “but I say to you,” and the “I” to the understood subject of “was said.” He has not, however, apprehended the deeper truth which underlies the omission of the<i> subject</i> of<i> was said</i>, that it was the<i> same person</i> who said both. It will be noticed that our Lord does not here speak against the<i> abuse</i> of the law by tradition, but that every instance here given is either from<i> the law itself</i>, or<i> such traditional teaching as was in accordance with it</i> (e. g. the latter part of this verse is only a formal expansion of the former). The contrasts here are not between<i> the</i><i> law misunderstood and the law rightly understood</i>, but between the<i> law and its ancient exposition</i>, which in their letter, and as given, were<i> empty</i>,—and<i> the same as spiritualized, fulfilled, by Christ</i>: not between<i> two lawgivers</i>, Moses and Christ, but between<i> they of old time</i> and<i> you</i>; between (the idea is Chrysostom’s) the children by the same husband, of the<i> bondwoman</i> and of the<i> freewoman</i>. The above remarks comprise a brief answer to the important but somewhat misapprehended question, whether a impugned the Mosaic law itself, or only its inadequate interpretation by the Jewish teachers? There is no inconsistency in the above view with the assertion in ver. 19: the just and holy and true law was necessarily restricted in meaning and degraded in position, until He came, whose office it was to fulfil and glorify it.<br><br><b> the judgment</b>] viz. the courts in every city, ordered Deut. xvi. 18, and explained by Josephus Antt. iv. 8. 14 to consist of seven men, and to have the power of life and death. But “<i>the judgment</i>” in the next verse (see note) is the court of judgment in the Messiah’s kingdom.
