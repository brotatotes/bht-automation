<p><strong> 23 f. </strong> <strong> οὖν</strong> ] an inference from the guilt and danger of all bitterness and hostility of mind towards another, declared in the preceding verse. Chrysostom remarks: καθάπερ σοφὸς ἰατρὸς οὐ μόνον τὰ προφυλακτικὰ τῶν νοσημάτων τίθησιν , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ διορθωτικά , οὕτω καὶ αὐτὸς ποιεῖ . τὸ μὲν γὰρ κωλύειν καλεῖν μωρόν , προφυλακτικόν ἐστι τῆς ἔχθρας · τὸ δὲ κελεύειν καταλλαγῆναι , τῶν μετὰ τήν ἔχθραν γενομένων νοσημάτων ἀναιρετικόν . Hom. xvi. 10, p. 218. The whole of his comment on this verse is excellent. The <strong> δῶρον</strong> is any kind of gift sacrificial or eucharistic.

<p><strong> ἔχει τὶ κατὰ σοῦ</strong> is remarkable, as being purposely substituted for the converse. It is not <em> what complaints we have against others</em> that we are to consider at such a time, but <em> what they have against us;</em> not what ground <em> we have given</em> for complaint, but what complaints <em> they</em> , as matter of fact, <em> make</em> against us. See the other side dealt with, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:25">Mark 11:25</span> .

<p>Tholuck has shewn at length (p. 187, ff.) that the distinction attempted to be set up between διαλλάσσω as implying a <em> mutual</em> , and καταλλάσσω , a merely <em> one-sided</em> reconciliation, has no foundation in fact. Our διαλλάγηθι is simply <strong> become reconciled</strong> <em> thyself</em> , without being influenced by the status of the other towards thee. Remove the offence, and make friendly overtures to thy brother. <strong> πρῶτον</strong> belongs to ὕπαγε , not to διαλλάγηθι , (1) because ὕπ . πρῶτον is opposed to τότε ἐλθών , the <em> departure</em> to the <em> return</em> , not διαλλάγηθι to πρόσφερε ; (2) by the analogy of the usage of such adverbs with imperatives. Compare ch. Mat 7:5 and the similar passage, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:42">Luke 6:42</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:33">Matthew 6:33</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:30">Matthew 13:30</span> : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:27">Mark 7:27</span> . No conclusion whatever can be drawn from this verse as to the admissibility of the term <em> altar</em> as applied to the Lord’s Table under the Christian system. The whole language is Jewish, and can only be understood of Jewish rites. The <em> command</em> , of course, applies in full force as to reconciliation before the Christian offering of praise and thanksgiving in the Holy Communion; but further nothing can be inferred.</p>
