<b> 23.</b>] The sense is: ‘There were among the Jews three well-known degrees of guilt, coming respectively under the cognizance of the local and the su e courts; and after these is set the Gehenna of fire, the end of the malefactor, whose corpse, thrown out into the valley of Hinnom, was devoured by the worm or the flame. Similarly, in the spiritual kingdom of Christ, shall the sins even of thought and word be brought into judgment and punished, each according to its degree of guilt, but even the least of them before no less a tribunal than the judgment-seat of Christ.’ The most important thing to keep in mind is, that there is no distinction of<i> kind</i> between these punishments, only of<i> degree</i>. In the thing compared, the “<i>judgment</i>” inflicted death by the sword, the “<i>council</i>” death by stoning, and the disgrace of the “<i>Gehenna of fire</i>” followed as an intensification of the horrors of death; but the punishment is one and the same—<i>death</i>. So also in the subject of the similitude,<i> all the punishments are spiritual; all result in eternal death; but with various degrees</i> (the nature of which is as yet hidden from us), as the degrees of guilt have been. So that the distinction drawn by the Romanists between<i> venial</i> and mortal sins, finds not only no countenance, but direct confutation from this passage. The words here mentioned must not be superstitiously supposed to have any damning power in themselves (see below), but to represent<i> states of anger and hostility</i>, for which an awful account hereafter must be given.<br><br><b> Raca</b>] i.e.<b> empty</b>; a term denoting contempt, and answering to “<i>O vain man,</i>” James ii. 20.<br><br><b> Moreh</b>] Two interpretations have been given of this interpretations have been given i word. Either it is (1), as usually understood, a Greek word, ‘<i>Thou fool</i>’ and used by our Lord Himself of Scribes and Pharisees, ch. xxiii. 17, 19,—and “<i>fools</i>” (literally “<i>senseless</i>”) of the disciples, Luke xxiv. 25; or (2) a Hebrew word signifying ‘<i>rebel,</i>’ and the very word for uttering which Moses and Aaron were debarred from entering the land of promise:... ‘Hear now, ye rebels,’ Num. xx. 10. In presence of this doubt, it is best to leave the word untranslated, as was done with<b> Raca</b> before.<br><br><b> hell fire</b>] more properly,<b> the Gehenna of fire</b>. To the S.E. of Jerusalem was a deep and fertile valley, called ‘<i>the vale of Hinnom</i>’ and rendered “Gehenna,” Josh xviii. 16 LXX. In this valley (also called Tophet, Isa. xxx. 33: Jer. vii. 31) did the idolatrous Jews burn their children to Moloch, and Josiah (2 Kings xxiii. 10) therefore polluted it; and thenceforward it was the place for the casting out and burning all offal, and the corpses of criminals; and therefore its name, “<i>the Gehenna of fire,</i>” was used to signify the place of everlasting punishment.<br><br><b> 23 f. Therefore</b>] An inference from the guilt and danger of all bitterness and hostility of mind towards another declared in the preceding verse.<br><br><b> thy gift</b>, is any kind of gift—sacrificial or eucharistic.<br><br><b> hath ought against thee</b> is remarkable, as being purposely substituted for the converse. It is not<i> what complaints we have against others</i> that we are to consider at such a time, but<i> what they have against us</i>; not what ground<i> we have given</i> for complaint, but what complaints<i> they</i>, as matter of fact,<i> make</i> against us.—See the other side dealt with, Mark xi. 25.
