<b> 24.</b>]<b> be reconciled</b>: i.e.<b> become reconciled</b>—<i>thyself</i>, without being influenced by the status of the other towards thee. Remove the offence, and make friendly overtures to thy brother.<b> first</b> belongs to “<i>go thy way,</i>” not to “<i>be reconciled:</i>” “first go thy way” is opposed to “then come,” the<i> departure</i> to the<i> return</i>, not “be reconciled” to “offer.” No conclusion whatever can be drawn from this verse as to the admissibility of the term<i> altar</i> as applied to the Lord’s table under the Christian system. The whole language is Jewish, and can only be understood of Jewish rites. The<i> command</i>, of course, applies in full force as to reconciliation re the Christian offering of praise and thanksgiving in the Holy Communion; but further nothing can be inferred.
