The sense may be given: ‘As in worldly affairs, it is prudent to make up a matter with an adversary before judgment is passed, which may deliver a man to a hard and rigorous imprisonment, so reconciliation with an offended brother in this life is absolutely necessary before his wrong cry against us to the Great Judge, and we be cast into eternal condemnation.’
	The  ἀντίδικος  , in its  abstract personification , is the  offended law of God , which will cry against us in that day for  all wrongs done to others; but in its  concrete representation it is the  offended brother , who is to us that law, as long as he has its claim upon us. The  ὁδός  , in the interpretation, is the way in which all men walk, the ὁδὸς πάσης τῆς γῆς of 3 Kings Matthew 2:2 , the ὁδὸς ᾗ οὐκ ἐπαναστραφήσομαι of Job 16:22 .

So Chrys.: πρὸ μὲν γὰρ τῆς εἰσὸδου σὺ κύριος εἶ τοῦ παντός · ἐὰν δὲ ἐπιβῇς ἐκείνων τῶν προθύρων , οὐδὲ σφόδρα σπουδάζων δυνήαῃ τὰ καθ ʼ ἑαυτὸν ὡς βούλει διαθεῖναι . Hom. xvi. 10, p. 219.
