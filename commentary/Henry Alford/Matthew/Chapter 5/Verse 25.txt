<b> 25.</b>] The whole of this verse is the earthly example of a spiritual duty which is understood, and runs parallel with it. The sense may be given: ‘As in worldly affairs, it is prudent to make up a matter with an adversary before judgment is passed, which may deliver a man to a hard and rigorous imprisonment, so reconciliation with an offended brother in this life is absolutely necessary before his wrong cry against us to the Great Judge, and we be cast into eternal condemnation.’—The adversary, in its<i> abstract personification</i>, is the<i> offended law of God</i>, which will cry against us in that day for<i> all</i> wrongs done to others; but in its<i> concrete representation</i> it is the<i> offended brother</i>, who is to us that law, as long as he has its claim upon us. The<b> way</b>, in the interpretation, is the way in which all men walk, the “<i>way of all the earth</i>” of 1 Kings ii. 2, the “<i>way whence I shall not return</i>” of Job. xvi. 22. In the civil process, it represents the attempt at arbitration or private arrangement before coming into court.
