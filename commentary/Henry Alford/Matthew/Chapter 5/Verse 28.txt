<b> 28. whosoever looketh..</b>] The precise meaning should in this verse be kept in mind, as the neglect of it may lead into error. Our Lord is speaking of the sin of<i> adultery</i>, and therefore, however the saying may undoubtedly apply by implication to cases where this sin is out of the question—e. g. to the impure beholding of an<i> un</i> married woman with a view to fornication (it being borne in mind that spiritually, and before God, all fornication<i> is</i> adultery, inasmuch as the unmarried person is bound in loyalty and chastity to<i> Him</i>: see Stier below)—yet the<i> direct</i> assertion in this verse must be understood as applying to the cases where<i> this</i> sin is in question. And, again, the<b> looketh on... to lust after</b>, must not be interpreted of the casual evil thought which is checked by holy watchfulness, but the gazing<i> with a view to feed that desire</i>. And again,<b> hath adulterously used her already in his heart</b>, whatever it may undoubtedly<i> imply</i> respecting the guilt incurred in God’s sight, does not<i> directly state</i> any thing; but plainly understood, affirms that the man who can do this—viz. ‘gaze with a view to feed unlawful desire’—has already in his heart passed the barrier of criminal intention; made up his mind, stifled his conscience; in thought, committed the deed. But perhaps there is justice in Stier’s remark, that our Lord speaks here after the O.T. usage, in which, both in the seventh commandment and elsewhere,<i> adultery</i> also<i> includes fornication</i>; for marriage is the becoming one flesh,—and therefore every such union, except that after the manner and in the state appointed by God, is a violation and contempt of that holy ordinance. The rendering of the A.V., “<i>hath committed adultery with her,</i>” is objectionable, as making her a party to the sin, which the original does not.
