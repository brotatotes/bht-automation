<p><strong> 28. </strong> <strong> πᾶς ὁ βλέπων</strong> ] The precise meaning should in this verse be kept in mind, as the neglect of it may lead into error. Our Lord is speaking of the sin of <em> adultery</em> , and therefore, however the saying may undoubtedly apply by implication to cases where this sin is out of the question e.g. to the impure beholding of an <em> un</em> married woman with a view to fornication (it being borne in mind that spiritually, and before God, all fornication <em> is</em> adultery, inasmuch as the unmarried person is bound in loyalty and chastity to <em> Him</em> . See Stier below) yet the <em> direct</em> assertion in this verse must be understood as applying to the cases where <em> this</em> sin is in question. And, again, the βλέπων πρὸς τὸ ἐπιθ . must not be interpreted of the casual evil thought which is checked by holy watchfulness, but the gazing <em> with a view to feed that desire</em> (for so πρὸς τό with an inf. must mean). And again, ἤδη ἐμ . αὐτ . ἐν τῇ κ . αὐτ ., whatever it may undoubtedly <em> imply</em> respecting the guilt incurred in God’s sight, does not <em> directly state</em> any thing; but, plainly understood, affirms that the man who can do this viz. ‘gaze with a view to feed unlawful desire’ has already in his heart passed the barrier of criminal intention; made up his mind, stifled his conscience; in thought, committed the deed. But perhaps there is justice in Stier’s remark, Reden Jesu, i. 129 (edn. 2), that our Lord speaks here after the O.T. usage, in which, both in the seventh commandment and elsewhere, <em> adultery</em> also <em> includes fornication;</em> for marriage is the becoming one flesh, and therefore every such union, except that after the manner and in the state appointed by God, is a violation and contempt of that holy ordinance.</p>
