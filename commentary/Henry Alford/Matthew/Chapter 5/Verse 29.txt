An admonition, arising out of the truth announced in the last verse, to<i> withstand the first springs and occasions of evil desire, even by the sacrifice of what is most useful and dear to us</i>. We may observe here, that our Lord grounds His precept of the most rigid and decisive<i> self-denial</i> on the considerations of the<i> truest self-interest</i>,â€”<b>it is profitable for thee</b>. See ch. xviii. 8, 9, and notes.
