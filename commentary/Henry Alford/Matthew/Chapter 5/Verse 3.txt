<b> 3. the poor in spirit</b>] “He said not, the poor in possessions, but ‘in spirit:’ i.e. the lowly in purpose and in soul.” Euthymius. “What is ‘the poor in spirit?’ the humble and contrite in heart.” Chrys.—The meaning of<i> voluntary poverty</i>, as that of the religious orders, given by some of the Fathers, and many; Romish interpreters, is<i> out of the question</i>. As little can the<i> bare literal</i> sense of the words, which Julian scoffed at, be understood: viz. those who are<i> ill-furnished in mind</i>, and uneducated. See Rev. iii. 17. The idea (De Wette) is not improbable, that our Lord may have had a reference to the poor and subjugated Jewish people around him, once members of the theocracy, and now expectants of the Messiah’s temporal kingdom; and, from their condition and hopes, taken occasion to preach to them the deeper spiritual truth.<br><br><b> their’s is the kingdom of heaven</b>] See Luke iv. 17–21: James ii. 5. The kingdom must here be understood in its widest sense: as the combination of all rights of Christian citizenship in this world, and eternal blessedness in the next, ch. vi. 33. But Tholuck well observes, that all the senses of “<i>the kingdom of God,</i>” or “<i>of heaven,</i>” or “<i>of Christ,</i>” are only different sides of the same great idea—the<i> subjection of all things to God in Christ.</i>
