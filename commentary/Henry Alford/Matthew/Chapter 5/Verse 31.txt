<b> 31 32.</b>] THIRD EXAMPLE.<i> The law of divorce</i>. See note on ch. xix. 7–9. Lightfoot gives a form of the “<i>writing of divorcement</i>” which was a divorcement a<i> mensâ et thoro</i>, and placed the woman absolutely in her own power, to marry whom she pleased. In Deut. xxiv. 1, the allowable reason of divorce is ‘some uncleanness.’ This the disciples of Shammai interpreted only of adultery; those of Hillel of any thing which amounted to uncleanness in the eyes of the husband.
