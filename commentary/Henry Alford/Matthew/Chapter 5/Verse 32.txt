<b> 32.</b>]<b> fornication</b> must be taken to mean sin, not only before marriage, but after it also, in a wider sense, as including<i> adultery</i> likewise. In the similar places, Mark x. 11; Luke xvi. 18, this exception does not occur; see however our ch. xix. 9. The figurative senses of<i> fornication</i> cannot be admissible here, as the law is one having reference to a definite point in actual life; and this, its aim and end, restricts the meaning to that kind of fornication immediately applicable to the case. Otherwise this one strictly guarded exception would give indefinite and universal latitude.
