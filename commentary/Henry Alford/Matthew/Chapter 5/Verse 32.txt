<b> 32.</b>]<b> fornication</b> must be taken to mean sin, not only before marriage, but after it also, in a wider sense, as including<i> adultery</i> likewise. In the similar places, Mark x. 11; Luke xvi. 18, this exception does not occur; see however our ch. xix. 9. The figurative senses of<i> fornication</i> cannot be admissible here, as the law is one having reference to a definite point in actual life; and this, its aim and end, restricts the meaning to that kind of fornication immediately applicable to the case. Otherwise this one strictly guarded exception would give indefinite and universal latitude.<br><br><b> causeth her to commit adultery</b>] viz. by her second marriage, thus put within her power.<br><br><b> and whosoever</b>] How far<i> the marriage of the innocent party after separation</i> (on account of fornication) is<i> forbidden</i> by this or the similar passage ch. xix. 9, is a weighty and difficult question. By the Roman Church such marriage is<i> strictly forbidden</i>, and the authority of Augustine much cited, who strongly upholds this view, but not without misgivings later in life. On the other hand, the Protestant and Greek Churches<i> allow</i> such marriage. Certainly it would appear, from the literal meaning of our Lord’s words, that it<i> should not be allowed</i>: for if by such divorce the marriage be altogether dissolved, how can the<i> woman</i> be said to commit adultery by a second marriage? or how will St. Paul’s precept (1 Cor. vii. 11) find place? for stating this as St. Paul does, prefaced by the words “<i>not I, but the Lord,</i>” it must be understood, and has been taken, as<i> referring to this very verse</i>, or rather (see note there) to ch. xix. 6 ff., and consequently can only suppose fornication as the cause. Besides which, the tenor of our Lord’s teaching in other places (see above) seems to set before us the state of marriage as absolutely<i> indissoluble as such</i>, however he may sanction the expulsion<i> a mensâ et thoro</i> of an unfaithful wife. Those who defend the other view suppose<b> divorced</b> to mean,<i> unlawfully divorced</i>, not for fornication: and certainly this is not improbable. We may well leave a matter in doubt, of which Augustine could say, that it was so obscure, that error on either side is venial.
