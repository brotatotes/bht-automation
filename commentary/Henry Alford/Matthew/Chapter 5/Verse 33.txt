 (1) That the Jews held all those oaths<i> not to be binding</i>, in which the<i> sacred name of God did not directly occur</i>:—see Philo and Lightfoot cited in my Gr. Test. A stress is to be laid on this technical distinction in the quotation made by our Lord; and we must understand as belonging to the quotation, ‘but whatever thou shalt swear not to the Lord may be transgressed.’ (2) Then our Lord passes so far beyond this rule, that He lays down (including in it the understanding that all oaths must, be kept<i> if made</i>, for that they are all Ultimately referable to swearing by God) the rule of the Christian community, which is<i> not to swear at all</i>; for that every such means of strengthening a man’s simple affirmation arises out of the evil in human nature, is rendered requisite by the distrust that sin has induced, and is, therefore, out of the question among the just and true and pure of heart. See James v. 12, and note there, as explanatory why, in both cases, swearing by the name of God is not specified as forbidden.
