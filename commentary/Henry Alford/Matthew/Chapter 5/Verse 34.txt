In the words, ‘Swear not at all,’ our Lord does not so much make a positive enactment by which all swearing is to individuals forbidden, e.g. on solemn occasions, and for the satisfaction of others, (for that would be a mere technical Pharisaism, wholly at variance with the spirit of the Gospel, and inconsistent with the example of<i> God himself</i>, Heb. vi. 13–17; vii. 21;<i> of the Lord when on earth, whose “verily verily I say unto you”</i> was a solemn asseveration, and who at once respected the solemn adjuration of Caiaphas, ch. xxvi. 63, 64; of<i> His Apostles</i>, writing under the guidance of His Spirit, see Gal. i. 20: 2 Cor. i. 23: Rom. i. 9: Phil. i. 8, and especially 1 Cor. xv. 31; of<i> His holy angels</i>, Rev. x. 6,) as declare to us, that the<i> proper state</i> of Christians is, to<i> require no oaths</i>; that when<i> evil</i> is expelled from among them, every<i> yea</i> and<i> nay</i> will be as decisive as an oath, every promise as binding as a vow. We observe (<i>a</i>) that these verses imply the unfitness of<i> vows</i> of every kind as rules of Christian action; (<i>b</i>) that the greatest regard ought to be had to the scruples of those, not only sects, but individuals, who object to taking an oath, and every facility given in a Christian state for their ultimate entire abolition.
