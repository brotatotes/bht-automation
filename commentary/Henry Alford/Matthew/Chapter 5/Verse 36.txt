And, indeed, men generally regard it as such now, even unconsciously.<br><br><b> Yea, yea; Nay, nay</b>] The similar place, James v. 12, admirably illustrates this— “<i>let your yea be yea, and your nay nay:</i>”—let these only be used, and they in simplicity and unreservedness.<br><br><b> cometh of evil</b>] The gender of evil is ambiguous, as it may be also in the Lord’s prayer, ch. vi, 13: but see note there. It is quite immaterial to the<i> sense</i>, in which gender we understand it; for the evil of man’s corrupt nature is in Scripture spoken of as the<i> work of “the evil One,”</i> and is<i> itself “that which is evil.”</i> See John viii. 44: 1 John iii. 8.
