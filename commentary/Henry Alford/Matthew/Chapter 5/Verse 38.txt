<b> 38.</b>] That is,<i> such was the public enactment of the Mosaic law</i>, and, as such, it implied a private spirit of retaliation which should seek such redress; for the example evidently refers to<i> private</i> as well as public retribution. Here again our Lord appears to speak of the<i> true state and perfection of a Christian community</i>,—not to forbid, in those mixed and but half-Christian states, which have ever divided so-called Christendom among them, the infliction of judicial penalties for crime. In fact Scripture speaks, Rom. xiii. 4, of<i> the minister of such infliction</i> as the<i> minister</i><i> of God</i>. But as before, our Lord shews us the<i> condition to which</i> a Christian community should<i> tend</i>, and to further which every private Christian’s own endeavours should be directed. It is quite beside the purpose for the world to say, that these precepts of our Lord are too highly pitched for humanity, and so to find an excuse for violating them. If we were disciples of His in the true sense, these would, in their<i> spirit</i>, as indicative of frames of mind, be<i> strictly observed</i>; and,<i> as far</i> as we are His disciples, we shall<i> attain to such their observance</i>.<br><br> Here again, our Lord does not<i> contradict</i> the Mosaic law, but<i> expands</i> and<i> fulfils</i> it, declaring to us that the necessity for it would be altogether removed in the complete state of that kingdom which He came to establish.<br><br> Against the notion that<b> an eye for an eye</b>&c. sanctioned all kinds of private revenge, Augustine remarks that the ancient precept was rather intended to allay, than to stimulate anger; as a limit to vindictiveness, not a licence.
