<b> 39.</b>] Here again, we have our divine Lawgiver legislating, not in the bondage of the letter, so as to stultify His disciples, and in many circumstances to turn the salt of the earth into a means of corrupting it,—but in the freedom of the spirit, laying down those great principles which ought to regulate the inner purposes and consequent actions of His followers. Taken<i> slavishly</i> and<i> literally</i>, neither did our Lord Himself conform to this precept (John xviii. 22, 23), nor His Apostles (Acts xxiii. 3). But<i> truly</i>, and in the<i> spirit</i>, our blessed Redeemer obeyed it: ‘He gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, and hid not his face from shame and spitting’ (Isa. 1. 6): and his Apostles also, see 1 Cor. iv. 9–13.<br><br><b> evil</b>] i.e. here<b> the evil man</b>; ‘him who injures thee.’ Or, perhaps, in the indefinite sense, as before,<b> evil</b>, generally, ‘when thus directed against thee.’ Only, the other possible meaning there, ‘<i>the evil One,</i>’ is precluded here. “<i>Resist the devil,</i>” James iv. 7: but not<i> this particular form</i> of his working (viz. malice directed against thyself) so as to revenge it on another.<br><br><b> take away</b>, i.e. in pledge for a debt: see Exod. xxii. 6.<br><br><b> coat</b>, the inner and less costly garment;<b> cloke</b>, the outer and more valuable, used also by the poor as a coverlet by night (Exod. as above). In Luke vi. 29 the order is inverted, and appears to be that in which the two garments would be taken from the body, that verse referring to abstraction by<i> violence</i>. See the apostolic comment on this precept, 1 Cor. vi. 7.<br><br><b> compel</b>] The original word is one derived from the Persian name of the post-couriers who carried the government despatches: and is thence used of any compulsory “<i>pressing</i>” to go on service. ‘The Jews particularly objected to the duty of furnishing posts for the Roman government; and Demetrius, wishing to conciliate the Jews, promised, among other things, that their beasts of burden should not be pressed for service. Hence our Saviour represents this as a burden.’ Josephus. The billeting of the Roman soldiers and their horses on the Jews was one kind of this compulsion.
