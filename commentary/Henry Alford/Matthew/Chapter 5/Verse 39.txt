 39.   μὴ ἀντιστῆναι ] Here again, we have our divine Lawgiver legislating, not in the bondage of the letter so as to stultify His disciples, and in many circumstances to turn the salt of the earth into a means of corrupting it, but in the freedom of the spirit, laying down those great principles which ought to regulate the inner purposes and consequent actions of His followers. Taken  slavishly and  literally , neither did our Lord Himself conform to this precept ( Joh 18:22-23 ), nor his Apostles ( Act 23:3 ). But  truly , and in the  spirit , our blessed Redeemer obeyed it; ‘He gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, and hid not his face from shame and spitting’ ( Isa 50:6 ): and his Apostles also, see 1 Corinthians 4:9-13 .
	 τῷ πονηρῷ ]  the evil man; ‘him who injures thee.’ Or, perhaps, in the indefinite sense, as before, evil, generally, ‘when thus directed against thee.’ Only, the other possible meaning there, ‘  the evil one ,’ is precluded here. ἀντίστητε τῷ διαβόλῳ : but not  this particular form of his working (viz. malice directed against thyself) so as to revenge it on another.
