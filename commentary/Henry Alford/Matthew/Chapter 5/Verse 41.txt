compel</b>] The original word is one derived from the Persian name of the post-couriers who carried the government despatches: and is thence used of any compulsory “<i>pressing</i>” to go on service. ‘The Jews particularly objected to the duty of furnishing posts for the Roman government; and Demetrius, wishing to conciliate the Jews, promised, among other things, that their beasts of burden should not be pressed for service. Hence our Saviour represents this as a burden.’ Josephus. The billeting of the Roman soldiers and their horses on the Jews was one kind of this compulsion.
