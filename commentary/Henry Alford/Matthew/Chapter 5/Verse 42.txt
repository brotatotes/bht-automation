 42. ] The proper understanding of the command in this verse may be arrived at from considering the way in which the Lord Himself, who declares, ‘If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it’ ( Joh 14:14 ), performs this promise to us. It would obviously be, not a promise of love, but a sentence of condemnation to us, understood in its bare literal sense; but our gracious Saviour, knowing what is good for us, so answers our prayers, that we never are sent empty away; not always, indeed, receiving  what we ask, but that which in the very disappointment we are constrained thankfully to confess is better than our wish. So, in his humble sphere, should the Christian giver act. To give every thing to every one the sword to the madman, the alms to the impostor, the criminal request to the temptress would be to act as the enemy of others and ourselves. Ours should be a higher and deeper charity, flowing from those inner springs of love, which are the sources of outward actions sometimes widely divergent; whence may arise both the timely concession, and the timely refusal. As Chrysostom observes on a former verse, μὴ τοίνυν ἁπλῶς τὰ πράγματα ἐξετάσωμεν , ἀλλὰ καὶ καιρὸν καὶ αἰτίαν καὶ γνώμην καὶ προσώπων διαφοράν , καὶ ὅσα ἂν αὐτοῖς ἕτερα συμβαίνῃ , πάντα μετὰ ἀκριβείας ζητῶμεν · οὐδὲ γάρ ἐστιν ἑτέρως ἐφίκεσθαι τῆς ἀληθείας . Hom. xvii. 6, p. 231.
