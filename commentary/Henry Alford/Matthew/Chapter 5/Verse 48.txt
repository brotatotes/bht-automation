<p><strong> 48. </strong> <strong> ἔσεσθε</strong> ] Not altogether imperative in meaning, but including the imperative sense: such shall be the state, the aim of Christians.

<p><strong> τέλειοι</strong> ] <strong> complete,</strong> in your love of others; not one-sided, or exclusive, as these just mentioned, but all-embracing, and God-like ═ οἰκτίρμονες , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:36">Luke 6:36</span> . <strong> ὑμεῖς</strong> is emphatic. No countenance is given by this verse to the ancient Pelagian or the modern heresy of perfectibility in this life. Such a sense of the words would be utterly at variance with the whole of the discourse. See especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span> , in which the imperfections and conflicts of the Christian are fully recognized. Nor, if we consider this verse as a solemn conclusion of the second part of the Sermon, does it any the more admit of this view, asserting as it does that likeness to God in inward purity, love, and holiness, must be the continual aim and end of the Christian in all the departments of his moral life. But how far from having attained this likeness we are, St. Paul shews us ( Php 3:12 ); and every Christian feels, just <em> in the proportion in which he has striven after it</em> . Augustine argues for the true sense of this and similar passages of Scripture against the Pelagians at length, De peccatorum meritis et remissione, lib. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ch+12:0">2 Chronicles 12:0</span> (17 20), and De perfectione justitiæ hominis, ch. 8, 9, vol. x. οἱ μὲν ἀγαπῶντες τοὺς ἀγαπῶντας αὐτοὺς ἀτελεῖς εἰσιν εἰς ἀγάπην , οἱ δὲ τοὺς ἐχθρούς , τέλειοι . Euthym [52] On the sense see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:15">1 Peter 1:15</span> .

<p>Thol. quotes from Plato, Theæt. p. 176, διὸ καὶ πειρᾶσθαι χρὴ ἐνθένδε ἐκεῖσε φεύγειν ὅτι τάχιστα · φυγὴ δὲ ὁμοίωσις θεῷ κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν · ὁμοίωσις δὲ δίκαιον καὶ ὅσιον μετὰ φρονήσεως γενέσθαι .</p>
