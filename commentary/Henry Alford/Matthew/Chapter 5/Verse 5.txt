<b> 5. the meek</b>] A citation from Ps. xxxvii. 11. The usual dividers and allotters of the earth being mighty and proud conquerors, and the Messiah being expected as such a conqueror, this announcement that the meek should inherit the earth, struck at the root of the temporal expectations of power and wealth in the Messiah’s kingdom. This meekness is not mere outward lowliness of demeanour, but that true<i> meekness</i> of Eph. iv. 2, whose active side is love, and its passive side long-suffering. On the promise, compare Isa. lvii. 13–15; lx. 21; 1 Cor. iii. 22. That kingdom of God which begins in the hearts of the disciples of Christ, and is not “of (sprung from)<i> this world,</i>” shall work onwards till it shall become<i> actually a kingdom over this earth</i>, and its subjects shall<i> inherit the earth</i>: first in its millennial, and finally in its renewed and blessed state for ever.
