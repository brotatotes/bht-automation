 5.   οἱ πραεῖς ] A citation from Psalms 37:11 . The usual dividers and allotters of the earth being mighty and proud conquerors, and the Messiah being expected as such a conqueror, this announcement, that the meek should inherit the earth, struck at the root of the temporal expectations of power and wealth in the Messiah’s kingdom. This meekness is not mere outward lowliness of demeanour, but that true πραΰτης of Ephesians 4:2 , whose active side (Stier) is ἀγάπη , and its passive side μακροθυμία . On the promise, compare Isaiah 57:13-15 ; Isaiah 60:21 ; 1 Corinthians 3:22 . That kingdom of God which begins in the hearts of the disciples of Christ, and is not  ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου τούτου , shall work onwards till it shall become  actually a kingdom over this earth , and its subjects shall  inherit the earth: first in its millennial, and finally in its renewed and blessed state for ever.
