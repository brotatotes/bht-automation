<b> 6.</b>] See Ps. cvii. 9; lxv. 4; xxii. 26: Isa. xli. 17. This<i> hunger and thirst</i> is the true sign of that new life on which those born of the Spirit (John iii. 3, 5) have entered; and it is after<i> righteousness</i>, i.e.<i> perfect conformity to the holy will of God</i>. This was<i> His</i> meat, John iv. 34, They shall be<i> satisfied—in the new heaven and new earth, in which dwelleth righteousness</i>, 2 Pet. iii. 13. Compare the remarkable parallel Ps. xvii. 15. This hunger and thirst after righteousness, is admirably set forth in the three first petitions of the Lord’s prayer,— ‘Hallowed be Thy name—Thy kingdom come—Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.’
