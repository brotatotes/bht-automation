 6. ] See Psalms 107:9 ; Psalms 65:4 ; Psalms 22:26 ; Isaiah 41:17 . This  hunger and thirst is the true sign of that new life on which those born of the Spirit (John 3:3 ; Joh 3:5 ) have entered; and it is after δικαιος ., i.e.  perfect conformity to the holy will of God . This was  His meat, John 4:34 . ‘lllo cibo saturabuntur de quo ipse Dominus dicit, Meus cibus est ut faciam voluntatem Patris mei, quod est, justitia: et illa aqua, de qua quisquis biberit, ut Idem dicit, fiet in eo fons aquæ salientis in vitam æternam.’ Aug [37] in loc. (vol. iii. pt. 2, Migne). But he elsewhere says (in Ev. Joh. Tract. 26. 1 (vol. iii. pt. 2)), after quoting this verse, ‘Justitiam vero nobis esse Christum, Paulus Apostolus dicit. Ac per hoc qui esurit Hunc Panem, esuriat Justitiam: sed justitiam quæ de cœlo descendit, justitiam quam dat Deus, non quam sibi facit homo.’ (Chrysostom confines himself to the moral explanation, as also Euthymius.) They shall be  satisfied in the new heaven and new earth , ἐν οἷς  δικαιοσύνη κατοικεῖ , 2 Peter 3:13 . Cf. the remarkable parallel, Ps. 16:15 (LXX), ἐγὼ δὲ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ ὀφθήσομαι τῷ προσώπῳ σου , χορτασθήσομαι ἐν τῷ ὀφθῆναι τὴν δόξαν σου . This hunger and thirst after righteousness is admirably set forth in the three first petitions of the Lord’s prayer, ‘Hallowed be Thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.’
