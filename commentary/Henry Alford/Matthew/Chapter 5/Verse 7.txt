 7.   ἐλεήμονες ] οὐχὶ διὰ χρημάτων μόνον ἐστὶν ἐλεεῖν , ἀλλὰ καὶ λόγου · κἂν μηδὲν ἔχῃς , διὰ δακρύων . ποικίλος γὰρ ὁ τῆς ἐλεημοσύνης τρόπος , καὶ πλατεῖα αὕτη ἡ ἐντολή . ἐλεηθήσονται δέ , ἐνταῦθα μὲν παρὰ ἀνθρώπων · ἐκεῖ δὲ παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ . Euthymius, expanding Chrysostom. This beatitude comprises every degree of sympathy and mutual love and help; from that fulness of it which is shed abroad in those who have been forgiven much, and therefore love much, down to those first beginnings of the new birth, even among those who know not the Lord, which are brought out in ch. Matthew 25:37-40 , where see notes.
