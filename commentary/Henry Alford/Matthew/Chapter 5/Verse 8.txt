<p><strong> 8. </strong> <strong> καθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῇ καρδίᾳ</strong> ] See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+24:4">Psalms 24:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+24:6">Psalms 24:6</span> . It is no Levitical cleanness, nor mere moral purity, that is here meant: but that <em> inner purity</em> , which ( Act 15:9 ) is brought about τῇ πίστει , has its fruit ( 1Ti 1:5 ) in <em> love;</em> which is, as in καθαρὸν φῶς , καθαρὰ χαρά , &amp;c., opposed to all διψυχία ( Jam 1:8 ), and all hypocrisy and outward colouring; so that the καθ . τῇ κ . are οἱ ῥεραντισμένοι τὰς καρδίας ἀπὸ συνειδήσεως πονηρᾶς ( Heb 10:22 ). ‘Hoc est mundum cor, quod est simplex cor: et quemadmodum lumen hoc videri non potest nisi oculis mundis, ita nec Deus videtur nisi mundum sit illud quo videri potest.’ (Aug [38] in loc.) But there is also allusion to the nearer vision of God attained by progressive sanctification, of which St. Paul speaks, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span> , begun indeed in this life, but not perfected till the next, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span> . Read the magnificent conclusion of Augustine De Civit. Dei, xxii. 29 (vol. vii. Migne), in which he enters more deeply into the meaning of this verse.
