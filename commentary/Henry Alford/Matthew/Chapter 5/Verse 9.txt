 9.   εἰρηνοποιοί ] More than ‘  the peaceful ’ (‘pacifici,’ Vulg.). It is doubtful whether the word ever has this meaning. Thus Euthymius, mostly after Chrysostom: οἱ μὴ μόνον αὐτοὶ μὴ στασιάζοντες , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἑτέρους στασιάζοντας συνάγοντες εἰς εἰρήνην · υἱοὶ δὲ θεοῦ κληθήσονται , ὡς μιμησάμενοι τὸν μονογενῆ υἱὸν αὐτοῦ · ᾧ γέγονεν ἔργον συναγαγεῖν τὰ διεστῶτα καὶ καταλλάξαι τὰ ἐκπεπολεμωμένα . But even thus we do not seem to reach the full meaning, which probably is, “  they that work peace; ” not confining the reference to the reconciliation of persons at variance: see note on James 3:18 ; and, for the more special meaning, Xen. in reff.
	 κληθήσονται ]  implies the reality, as in Matthew 5:19 ;  shall (not only be, but also)  be called, i.e. recognized, in the highest sense, both generally, and by the Highest Himself, as such. Cf. Maldonatus: ‘plus etiam quiddam mihi videtur  vocari quam  esse significare: nempe ita aliquid esse, ut appareat, ut omnium ore celebretur.’ Let it ever be remembered, according to the order of these beatitudes, and the assertion of James 3:17 , that the wisdom from above is  πρῶτον ἁγνή ,  ἔπειτα εἰρηνική , implying no compromise with evil. And it is in the working out of this ἁγνότης that Luk 12:51 is especially true.
