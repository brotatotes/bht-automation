<b> 9. peacemakers</b>] More than ‘<i>the peaceful</i>’ (Vulg.). is doubtful whether the word ever has this meaning. Thus Euthymius, mostly after Chrysostom: They who not only are themselves not men of strife, but make peace between others when at strife. They shall be called sons of God, because they have imitated His only Son; whose office it is to bring together the separated and to reconcile those at variance. But even thus we do not seem to reach the full meaning, which probably is, “<i>they that work peace;</i>” not confining the reference to the reconciliation of persons at variance: see note on James iii. 18.<br><br><b> shall be called</b>]<i> implies</i> the reality, as in ver. 19;<b> shall</b> (not only be, but also)<b> be called</b>, i.e. recognized, in the highest sense, both generally, and by the Highest Himself, as such. Let it ever be remembered, according to the order of these beatitudes, and the assertion of James iii. 17, that the wisdom from above is<b> first</b><i> pure</i>,<b> then</b><i> peaceable</i>, implying no compromise with evil. And it is in the working out of this purity that Luke xii. 51 is especially true. St. Augustine remarks, that martyrs are made not by the mere fact of suffering, but by the<i> cause</i> for which they suffer. And therefore it is added, ‘<i>for righteousness’ sake.</i>’
