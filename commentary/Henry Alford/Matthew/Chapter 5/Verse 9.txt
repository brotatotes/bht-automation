<b> 9. peacemakers</b>] More than ‘<i>the peaceful</i>’ (Vulg.). is doubtful whether the word ever has this meaning. Thus Euthymius, mostly after Chrysostom: They who not only are themselves not men of strife, but make peace between others when at strife. They shall be called sons of God, because they have imitated His only Son; whose office it is to bring together the separated and to reconcile those at variance. But even thus we do not seem to reach the full meaning, which probably is, “<i>they that work peace;</i>” not confining the reference to the reconciliation of persons at variance: see note on James iii. 18.
