<p><strong> 31, 32.</strong> ] THIRD EXAMPLE. <em> The law of divorce</em> . See note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:7-9">Matthew 19:7-9</span> . Lightfoot, Hor. Hebr., gives a form of the ἀποστάσιον , which was a divorcement <em> a vinculo matrimonii</em> , and placed the woman absolutely in her own power, to marry whom she pleased, unless the husband inserted a special clause to bar this. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="de+24:1">Deuteronomy 24:1</span> , the allowable reason of divorce is ‘some uncleanness.’ This the disciples of Shammai interpreted only of adultery; those of Hillel of any thing which amounted to uncleanness in the eyes of the husband.</p>
