Trench observes (Serm. on Mount, p. 55), ‘Men had learned to think that, if only God’s name were avoided, there was no irreverence in the frequent oaths by heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem, by their own heads, and these brought in on the slightest need, or on no need at all; just as now-a-days the same lingering half-respect for the Holy Name will often cause men, who would not be wholly profane, to substitute for that name sounds that nearly resemble, but are not exactly it, or the name, it may be, of some heathen deity.’ Observe that the predicates, θρόνος , ὑποπόδιον , πόλις , being placed for emphasis before the copulæ, are without articles: it would be ὅτι ἐστὶν ὁ θρόνος , &c.
