 40, 41. ] See note on Matthew 5:39 .  κριθῆναι imports  legal contention only , and is thus distinguished from the violence in Matthew 5:39 . (Meyer, against Tholuck (but not in edn. 3) and De Wette.)  λαβεῖν  , i.e. in pledge for a debt: see Exodus 22:26 .  χιτῶνα  , the inner and less costly garment;  ἱμάτιον  , the outer and more valuable, used also by the poor as a coverlet by night (Exod. ubi supra). In Luk 6:29 the order is inverted, and appears to be that in which the two garments would be taken from the body, that verse referring to abstraction by  violence . See the apostolic comment on this precept, 1 Corinthians 6:7 .
	 ἀγγαρεύσει ] Herod. viii. 98, after describing the Persian post-couriers, adds, τοῦτο τὸ δράμημα τῶν ἵππων καλέουσι Πέρσαι ἀγγαρήϊον . Æschylus, Agam. 285 (Dindorf), says of the beacons which brought the intelligence of the capture of Troy to Mycenæ, φρυκτὸς δὲ φρυκτὸν δεῦρ ʼ ἀπ ʼ ἀγγάρου πυρὸς ἔπεμπεν . ‘The Jews particularly objected to the duty of furnishing posts for the Roman government; and Demetrius, wishing to conciliate the Jews, promised, among other things, κελεύω δὲ μηδὲ ἀγγαρεύεσθαι τὰ Ἰουδαίων ὑποζύγια (Jos. Antt. xiii. 2. 3). Hence our Saviour represents this as a burden; and in the same manner Epictetus says, ἂν δὲ ἀγγαρεία ᾖ καὶ στρατιώτης ἐπιλάβηται , ἄφες , μὴ ἀντίτεινε μηδὲ γόγγυζε .’ Dr. Burton. The ἐπισταθμία , or billeting of the Roman soldiers and their horses on the Jews, was one kind of this ἀγγαρεία .
