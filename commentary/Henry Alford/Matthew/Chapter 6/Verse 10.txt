<p><strong> 10. </strong> <strong> ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου</strong> ] ‘Ut in nobis veniat, optamus; ut in illo inveniamur, optamus.’ Aug [64] Serm. lvi. c. 4 (5), vol. v. pt. i. <strong> Thy kingdom</strong> here is the fulness of the accomplishment of the kingdom of God, so often spoken of in prophetic Scripture; and by implication, all that process of events which lead to that accomplishment. Meyer, in objecting to all ecclesiastical and spiritual meanings of ‘Thy kingdom,’ forgets that the one for which he contends exclusively, <em> the Messianic kingdom</em> , does in fact include or imply them all.

<p><strong> γενηθήτω τὸ θ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σου</strong> ] i.e. not, ‘may our will be absorbed into thy will;’ but may it be conformed to and subordinated to thine. The literal rendering is, <strong> Let thy will be done, as in heaven,</strong> (so) <strong> also on earth.

<p>These last words, <strong> ὡς ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς</strong> <strong> ,</strong> <em> may</em> be regarded as applying to the whole of the three preceding petitions, as punctuated in the text. A slight objection may perhaps be found in the circumstance, that the kingdom of God cannot be said to have <em> come</em> in heaven, seeing that it has always been fully established there, and thus the accuracy of correspondence in the particulars will be marred. It is true, this may be escaped by understanding, May thy kingdom <em> come</em> on earth, so as to be as fully established, as it is already in heaven. So that I conceive we are at liberty to take the prayer either way.</p>
