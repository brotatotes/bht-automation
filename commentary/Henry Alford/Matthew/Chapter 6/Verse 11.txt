<b> 11. our daily bread</b>]<b> our—as</b> ‘<i>created for us,</i>’ ‘provided for our use by Thee.’ The word rendered<b> daily</b> has been very variously explained. For a discus-sion of the probable derivations and meanings, I must refer to my Gr. Test. I have there seen reason to prefer the sense<b> required for our subsistence—proper for our sustenance</b>. So that the expression will be equivalent to St. James’s “<i>things which are needful for the body</i>” (ii. 16), and the expressions are rendered in the Syriac version by the same word. Thus only,<b> this day</b> has its proper meaning. The<i> “day by day</i>” in Luke xi. 3 is different; see there. It is a question, how far the expression may be understood<i> spiritually</i>—of the Bread of Life. The answer is easy: viz. that we may safely thus understand it, provided we keep in the foreground its primary, physical meaning, and view the other as involved by implication in that. To understand the expression of the Eucharist<i> primarily</i>, or even of spiritual feeding on Christ, is to miss the plain reference of the petition to our daily physical wants. But not to recognize those spiritual senses, is equally to miss the great truth, that the “<i>we</i>” whose bread is prayed for, are not<i> mere</i> animals, but com; of body, soul, and spirit, all of which want daily nourishment by Him from whom all blessings flow.<br><br><b> our debts</b>] i.e.<b> sins</b>, short-comings, and therefore ‘debts:’ answers to “<i>trespasses,</i>” ver. 14.
