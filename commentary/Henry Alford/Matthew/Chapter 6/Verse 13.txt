<b> 13.</b>] The sentiment is not in any way inconsistent with the Christian’s joy when he “<i>falls into divers temptations,</i>” James i. 2, but is a humble self-distrust and shrinking from such trial in the prospect. The<b> leading into temptation</b> must be understood in its plain literal sense: so<i> will make with the temptation also a way to escape</i>, 1 Cor. x. 13. There is no discrepancy with James i. 13, which speaks not of the providential bringing about of, but the actual solicitation of, the temptation. Some have attempted to fix on<i> leading into</i> and<i> entering into</i> temptation, the meaning of<i> bringing into the power of</i>, and<i> entering into, so as to be overcome by</i>, temptation. But this surely the words will not bear.<br><br><b> But</b> must not be taken as equivalent to ‘<i>but if thou dost, deliver,</i>’&c.; but is rather the opposition to the former clause, and forms in this sense, but one petition with it,— ‘b<i> ring us not into conflict with evil, nay rather deliver (rid) us from it altogether</i>’ In another view, however, as expressing the deep desire of all Christian hearts to be delivered from<i> all evil</i> (for the adjective is here certainly neuter; the introduction of the mention of the ‘evil one’ would seem here to be incongruous. Besides, compare the words of St. Paul, 2 Tim. iv. 18, which look very like a reminiscence of this prayer: see note there) these words form a seventh and most affecting petition, reaching far beyond the last. They are the expression of the yearning for redemption of the sons of God (Rom. viii. 28), and so are fitly placed at the end of the prayer, and as the sum and substance of the personal petitions.<br><br> The<i> doxology</i> must on every ground of sound criticism be omitted. Had it formed part of the original text, it is absolutely inconceivable that almost all the ancient authorities should with one consent have omitted it. They could have had no reason for doing so; whereas the habit of terminating liturgical prayers with ascriptions of praise would naturally suggest some such ending, and make its insertion almost certain in course of time. And just correspondent to this is the evidence. We find,<i> absolutely no trace of it in early times</i>, in any family of MSS. or in any expositors. The ancient Syriac version<i> has</i> it, but whether it<i> always had</i>, is another question. It is quite open for us to regard it with Euthymius as “<i>a solemn ending, added by the holy lights and leaders of the Church,</i>” and to retain it as such in our liturgies; but in dealing with the sacred text we must not allow any<i> à priori</i> considerations, of which we are such poor judges, to outweigh the almost unanimous testimony of antiquity. The inference to be drawn from the words of St. Paul, 2 Tim. iv. 18, is rather against, than for the genuineness of the doxology. The fact that he there adds a doxology, different from that commonly read here, seems to<br><br> testify to the practice, begun thus early, of concluding the Lord’s prayer with a solemn ascription of glory to God. This eventually fell into one conventional form, and thus got inserted in the sacred text.<br><br><b> 16–18.</b>) THIRD EXAMPLE.<i> Fasting</i>. Another department of the spiritual life, in which<i> reality in the sight of God</i>, and not appearance in the sight of man, must be our object. While these verses determine nothing as to the manner and extent of Christian fasting, they clearly recognize it as a solemn duty, ranking it with almsgiving and prayer; but requiring it, like them, (see ch. ix. 14–17,) to spring out of reality, not mere formal prescription.
