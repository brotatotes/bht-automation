<b> 13.</b>] The sentiment is not in any way inconsistent with the Christian’s joy when he “<i>falls into divers temptations,</i>” James i. 2, but is a humble self-distrust and shrinking from such trial in the prospect. The<b> leading into temptation</b> must be understood in its plain literal sense: so<i> will make with the temptation also a way to escape</i>, 1 Cor. x. 13. There is no discrepancy with James i. 13, which speaks not of the providential bringing about of, but the actual solicitation of, the temptation. Some have attempted to fix on<i> leading into</i> and<i> entering into</i> temptation, the meaning of<i> bringing into the power of</i>, and<i> entering into, so as to be overcome by</i>, temptation. But this surely the words will not bear.
