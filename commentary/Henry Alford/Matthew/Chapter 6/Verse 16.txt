<b> 16. disfigure</b>] The word literally means<i> make to disappear</i>. Hence some have explained it,<i> hide, cover up</i>, viz. in mourning costume. But in later Greek the meaning was to<i> disfigure</i>. One writer uses it of women who paint their faces. The allusion is therefore not to<i> covering</i> the face, which could only be regarded as a sign of<i> mourning</i>, but to the squalor of the uncleansed face, and hair of the head and beard, as the contrast of washing and anointing shews.
