 16.   ἀφανίζουσιν ] “Chrys. διαφθείρουσι , ἀπολλύουσι : Homb., Hammond,  colorem auferre , comparing Antiochus, Hom. 55  de invidia , τὸ πρόσωπον ἐξαφανίζει ,  pallorem inducit : Erasm., Fritzsche,  e conspectu tollere : Elsner, Meyer,  to hide, cover up , viz. in mourning costume. But in later Greek the meaning is  deformare , to disfigure, (which the  exterminare of the vul [80] . may also mean,) as is shewn in many examples cited by Le Clerc h. l., Valcknär on Phœniss. 373, Schäfer ad Dion, de comp. verb. p. 124. In Stobæus, Serm. lxxiv. 62, Nicostratus uses it of women who paint: πόῤῥω δ ʼ ἂν εἴη καὶ τοῦ δεηθῆναι γυνὴ ὑγιαίνουσα καὶ ψιμυθίου καὶ ὑπ ʼ ὁφθαλμῷ ὑπογραφῆς καὶ ἄλλου χρώματος ζωγραφοῦντος καὶ  ἀφανίζοντος τὰς ὄψεις ‘which be-paints and  disfigures the faces.’ The allusion is therefore not to  covering the face, which could only be regarded as a sign of  mourning , but to the squalor of the uncleansed face and hair of the head and beard, as the contrast of washing and anointing shews.” Tholuck: and this certainly appears to be the right view, especially when we compare Mat 6:19-20 below. But he seems too hastily to have assumed the meaning in the passage from Stobæus: for there the verb may just as well signify  covering, plastering over , as disfiguring. The Etym. Mag. says ἀφανίσαι οἱ παλαι οὐχὶ τὸ  μολῦναι ὡς νῦν , ἀλλὰ τὸ τελέως ἀφανῆ ποιῆσαι . Suidas, on the other hand, ἀφανίσαι οὐ τὸ μολῦναι καὶ χρᾶναι δηλοῖ , ἀλλὰ τὸ ἀνελεῖν καὶ ἀφανὲς ποιῆσαι : but it is possible that he may be speaking of its  classical sense, as suggested by Le Clerc, who does not however, as Tholuck asserts,  cite any examples of the other meaning.
