<b> 21.</b>] The connexion with the foregoing is plain enough to any but the shallowest reader. ‘The heart is, where the treasure is.’ But it might be replied, ‘I will have a treasure on earth and a treasure in heaven also: a divided affection.’ This is dealt with, and its impracticability shewn by a parable from nature.<br><br><b> single</b>, i.e.<b> clear</b>, untroubled in vision, as the eye which presents a well-defined and single image to the brain.<br><br><b> evil</b>, i.e.<b> perverse</b>, as the eye which dims and distorts the visual images.<br><br><b> full of light</b>, rather,<i> in full light</i>, as an object in the bright sunshine;<b> full of darkness</b>, rather, as an object in the deep shade.<br><br><b> If therefore&c.</b>] Render, as in margin, If then the LIGHT w<b> hich is in thee is darkness, how dark is the</b> DARKNESS!i. e. ‘if the<i> conscience</i>, the eye and<i> light</i> of the soul, be<i> darkened</i>, in how<i> much grosser</i> darkness will all the<i> passions and faculties</i> be, which are of themselves<i> naturally dark!</i>’ This interpretation is that of nearly all the ancient fathers and versions. Stier expands it well: “As the body, of itself a dark mass, has its light from the eye, so we have here compared to it the sensuous, bestial life of men, their appetites, desires, and aversions, which belong to the lower creature. This dark region—human nature under the gross dominion of the flesh—shall become spiritualized, enlightened, sanctified, by the spiritual light: but if<i> this light</i> be darkness, how great must then the darkness of the<i> sensuous life</i> be!” The A.V., which agrees with the usual modern interpretation, makes the words a mere expression of the greatness of the darkness thereby occasioned, and thus loses the force of the sentence.
