 24. ] And this division in man’s being  cannot take place he is and must be  one light  or dark serving God  or Mammon.
	 δουλεύειν ] Not merely ‘  serve ,’ but in that closer sense in which he who serves is the δοῦλος of, i.e. belongs to, and obeys entirely, ὁ Ἰὼβ πλούσιος ἦν · ἀλλ ʼ οὐκ ἐδούλευε τῷ μαμωνᾷ , ἀλλ ʼ εἶχεν αὐτὸς καὶ ἐκράτει , καὶ δεσπότης , οὐ δοῦλος ἦν . Chrysost. Hom. xxi. 1, p. 269. See Romans 6:16-17 .
	 ἢ γαρ  …   ἢ  … is not a repetition; but the suppositions are the reverse of one another: as Meyer expresses it, ‘He will either hate A and love B, or cleave to A and despise B:’ ὁ εἷς and ὁ ἕτερος keeping their individual reference in both members.  μισεῖν and  ἀγαπᾷν must be given their full meaning, or the depth of the saying is not reached: the sense ‘minus diligo, posthabeo’ (Bretschneider) for μισεῖν would not bring out the opposition and division of the nature of man by the attempt.
	 μαμωνᾷ ] Chaldee, מָמוֹנָא , (from אָמַן , confisus est,)  riches. ‘Congruit et Punicum nomen, nam lucrum Punice mammon dicitur.’ August, in loc. Mammon does not appear to have been the name of any Syrian deity, as Schleusner asserts. Tholuck has shewn that the idea rests only on the testimony of Papias, an obscure grammarian of the eleventh century. Schl. refers to Tertullian, who, however, says nothing of the kind (see adv. Marc. iv. 33, vol. ii. pp. 439 ff., which must be the place meant, but not specified by Schl.).
