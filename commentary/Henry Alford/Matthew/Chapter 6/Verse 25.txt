 25.   διὰ τοῦτο ] A direct inference from the foregoing verse: the plainer, since  μεριμνάω (the root being μερίζω ) is ‘to be distracted,’ ‘to have the mind drawn two ways.’ The E. V., ‘  Take no thought ,’ does not express the sense, but gives rather an exaggeration of the command, and thus makes it unreal and nugatory.  Be not anxious, would be far better. In Luk 12:29 we have μὴ μετεωρίζεσθε , where see note.  τῇ ψυχῇ = περὶ τῆς ψυχῆς , dat. commodi. See Matthew 6:28 .
