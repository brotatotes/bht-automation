<p><strong> 25. </strong> <strong> διὰ τοῦτο</strong> ] A direct inference from the foregoing verse: the plainer, since <strong> μεριμνάω</strong> (the root being μερίζω ) is ‘to be distracted,’ ‘to have the mind drawn two ways.’ The E. V., ‘ <em> Take no thought</em> ,’ does not express the sense, but gives rather an exaggeration of the command, and thus makes it unreal and nugatory. <strong> Be not anxious,</strong> would be far better. In Luk 12:29 we have μὴ μετεωρίζεσθε , where see note. <strong> τῇ ψυχῇ</strong> = περὶ τῆς ψυχῆς , dat. commodi. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:28">Matthew 6:28</span> .
