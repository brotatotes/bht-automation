<b> 26.</b>] The two examples, of the birds and the lilies, are not parallel in their application. The first is an argument from the less to the greater; that our heavenly Father, who feeds the birds, will much more feed us: the second, besides this application, which (ver. 30) it also contains, is a reproof of the vanity of anxiety about clothing, which, in all its pomp of gorgeous colours, is vouchsafed to the inferior creatures, but not attainable by, as being unworthy of, us. Notice, it is not said “<i>Sow not, reap not, gather not into barns;</i>”—the birds are not our example to follow in their habits, for God hath made us to differ from them—the doing all these things is part of our “how much better are ye,” and increases the force of the<i> à fortiori</i>; but it is said, “<i>be not anxious,</i>”— “<i>be not in suspense</i>” Luke xii, 24).<br><br><b> your</b><i> Father</i>, not<i> their</i> Father:—thus by every accessory word does our Lord wonderfully assert the truths and proprieties of creation, in which<i> we</i>, his sons, are His central work, and the rest for<i> us</i>.<br><br><b> of the air</b>, and after-wards<b> of the field</b>, as Tholuck remarks, are not superfluous, but serve to set forth the wild and uncaring freedom of the birds and lants. I may add,—also to set forth their lower rank in the scale of creation, as<i> belonging to</i> the air and the field. Who could say of all mankind, “<i>the men of the world?</i>” Thus the<i> à fortiori</i> is more plainly brought out.
