 27. ] These words do not relate to the  stature , the adding a cubit to which (= a foot and a half) would be a very great addition, instead of a very small one, as is implied here, and expressed in Luke 12:26 , εἰ οὖν  οὐδὲ ἐλάχιστον δύνασθε , κ . τ . λ ., but to the  time of life of each hearer; as Theophylact on Luke 12:26 , ζωῆς μέτρα παρὰ μόνῳ τῷ θεῷ , καὶ οὐκ αὐτύς τις ἕκαστος ἑαυτῷ ὁριστὴς τῆς ζωῆς . So Hammond, Wolf, Rosenm., Kuinoel, Olsh., De Wette, Meyer, Stier, Tholuck, &c. &c.: and the  context seems imperatively to require it: for the object of food and clothing is not to  enlarge the body , but to prolong life. The application of measures of space to time is not uncommon. See Psalms 39:5 ; Job 9:25 ; 2 Timothy 4:7 . In Stobæus, xcviii. 13, we have cited from Mimnermus, ἡμεῖς δ ʼ οἷά τε φύλλα φύει πολυάνθεμος ὥρη | ἔαρος , ὅτ ʼ αἶψ ʼ αὐγὴ αὔξεται ἠελίου , | τοῖς ἴκελοι , πήχυιον ἐπὶ χρόνον ἄνθεσιν ἥβης | τερπόμεθα . Alcæus (Athen [84] x. 7) says, δάκτυλος ἁμέρα : and Diog. Laert. viii. 16 (Thol.) σπιθαμὴ τοῦ βίου .
