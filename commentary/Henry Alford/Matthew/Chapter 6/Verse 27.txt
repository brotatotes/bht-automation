<b> 27.</b>] These words do not relate to the<i> stature</i>, the adding a cubit to which ( = a foot and a half) would be a very great addition, instead of a very small one, as is implied here, and expressed in Luke xii. 26, “<i>if then ye be not able to do that thing which<b> i</b><b> s</b></i><b> least</b>,”—but to the<i> time of life</i> of each hearer; as Theophylact on Luke xii. 26, “The measure of life is with God alone, and each man cannot set the measure of his own age.” So the best Commentators: and the<i> context</i> seems imperatively to require it; for the object of food and clothing is not to<i> enlarge the body</i>, but to prolong life. The application of measures of space to time is not uncommon. See Ps. xxxix. 5: Job ix. 25: 2 Tim. iv. 7. Mimnermus, a Greek poet, speaks of “<i>a cubit's length of time.</i>” See other examples in my Gr. Test.
