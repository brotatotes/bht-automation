<b> 29.</b>] We here have the declaration of the Creator Himself concerning the relative glory and beauty of all human pomp, com-ed with the meanest of His own works. 2 Chron. ix. 15–28. And the mean-ing hidden beneath the text should not escape the student. As the beauty of the flower is unfolded by the divine Creator Spirit from<i> within</i>, from the laws and capacities of its<i> own</i> individual life, so must all true adornment of man be un-folded<i> from within</i> by the same Almighty Spirit. See 1 Pet. iii. 3, 4. As nothing from without can defile a man, (ch. xv. 11,) so neither can any thing from without adorn him. Our Lord introduces with<b> “I say unto you”</b> His revelations of omniscience: see ch. xviii. 10, 19.
