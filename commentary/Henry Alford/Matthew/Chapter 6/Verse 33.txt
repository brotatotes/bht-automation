 33.   ζητεῖτε πρῶτον ] Not with any reference to seeking all these things  after our religious duties, e.g. beginning with prayer days of avarice and worldly anxiety, but  make your great object, as we say,  your first care.
	 δικαιοσύνην ] Not here the  forensic righteousness of justification , but the  spiritual purity inculcated in this discourse. τήν δικ .  αὐτοῦ answers to ἡ τελειότης αὐτοῦ , spoken of in ch. Matthew 5:48 , and is another reference to the being as our Heavenly Father is. In the Christian life which has been since unfolded, the righteousness of justification is a  necessary condition of likeness to God; but it is not the δικ . αὐτ .  here meant.  ταῦτα πάντα  , these things, all of them the emphasis being on the genus  all such things:   πάντα ταῦτα  , all these things ‘  the whole of the things mentioned ’ the emphasis being on πάντα , the fact that  all without exception are included. See Winer, § 18. 4.
	 προστεθ  . ] There is a traditional saying of our Lord, αἰτεῖτε τὰ μεγάλα , καὶ τὰ μικρὰ ὑμῖν προστεθήσεται · καὶ αἰτεῖτε τὰ ἐπουράνια , καὶ τὰ ἐπίγεια προστεθήσεται ὑμῖν . Fabric. Cod. Apocr. i. 329. (Meyer.)
