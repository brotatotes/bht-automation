<b> 9.</b>] There is very slender proof of what is often asserted, that our Lord took nearly the whole of this prayer from existing Jewish formalæ. Not that such a view of the matter would contain in it any thing irreverent or objectionable; for if pious Jews had framed such petitions, our Lord, who came to fulfil every thing that was good under the Old Covenant, might, in a higher sense and spiritual meaning, have recommended the same forms to His disciples. But such does not appear to have been the fact. Lightfoot produces only the most general common-place parallels for the petitions, from the Rabbinical books.<br><br> With regard to the prayer itself we may remark, 1. The whole passage, vv. 7–15, is digressive from the subject of the first part of this chapter, which is the discouragement of the performance of religious duties to be seen of men, and is resumed at ver. 16. Neander therefore supposes that this passage has found its way in here as a sort of accompaniment to the preceding verses, but is in reality the answer of our Lord to the request in Luke xi. 1, more fully detailed than by that Evangelist. But to this I cannot assent, believing our Lord’s discourses as given by this evangelist to be no collections of scattered sayings, but veritable reports of continuous utterances. That the request related in Luke should afterwards have been made, and similarly answered, is by no means improbable. (That he should have thus related it<i> with this gospel before him</i>, is more than improbable.) 2. It has been questioned whether the prayer was led in the very earliest times as a set form delivered for liturgical use by our Lord. The variations in Luke have been regarded as fatal to the supposition of its being used liturgically at the time when these Gospels were written. But see notes on Luke xi. 1. It must be confessed, that we find very few traces of such use in early times. Tholuck remarks, “It does not occur in the Acts, nor in any writers before the third century. In Justin Martyr we find, that the minister prays ‘according to his power’... Cyprian and Tertullian make the first mention of the prayer as a ‘<i>lawful and ordinary prayer.</i>’” An allusion to it has been supposed to exist in 2 Tim. iv. 18, where see note. 3. The view of some that our Lord gave this, selecting it out of forms known and in use, as a prayer<i> ad interim, till the effusion of the Spirit of prayer</i>, is inadmissible, as we have no traces of any such temporary purpose in our Saviour’s discourses, and to suppose any such would amount to nothing less than to set them entirely aside. On the contrary, one work of the Holy Spirit on the disciples was, to<i> bring to their mind all things whatsoever He said unto them</i>, the depth of such sayings only then first being revealed to them by Him who<i> took of the things of Christ and shewed them to them</i>, John xiv. 26.<br><br><b> After this manner</b>]<b> thus</b>. Considering that other manners of praying have been spoken of above, the “<i>vain repetition</i>” and the “<i>much speaking,</i>” the word, especially in its present position of primary emphasis, cannot well be otherwise understood than ‘<i>in these words,</i>’ as a<i> specimen</i> of the<i> Christian’s</i> prayer (the<b> ye</b> holds the second place in emphasis), no less than its<i> pattern</i>. This, which would be the<i> inference</i> from the context here, is decided tor us by Luke xi. 2,<b> when ye pray, say—.</b><br><br><b> Our Father</b>] This was a form of address almost unknown to the Old Covenant: now and then hinted at, as reminding the children of their rebellion (Isa. i. 2: Mal. i. 6), or mentioned as a last resource of the orphan and desolate creature (Isa. lxiii. 16); but never brought out in its fulness, as indeed it could not be, till He was come by whom we have received the adoption of sons. “The prayer is a fraternal one; He saith not,<b> My</b> Father, as if prayed for himself only: bat Our Father, as embracing in one prayer all who are known as brethren in Christ.” Aug.<br><br><b> which art in heaven</b>] These opening words of the Lord’s Prayer set clearly before us the state of the Christian, as believing in, depending upon, praying to, a real<i> objective personal</i> GOD, lifted above himself; to approach whom he must lift up his heart, as the eye is lifted up from earth to heaven. This strikes at the root of all<i> pantheistic</i> error, which regards the spirit of man as identical with the Spirit of God,—and at the root of all<i> deism</i>, testifying us it does our relation to and covenant dependence on our heavenly Father.<br><br> The<i> local heavens</i> are no farther to be thought of here, than as Scripture, by a parallelism of things natural and spiritual deeply implanted in our race, universally speaks of<i> heaven</i> and<i> heavenly</i>, as applying to the habitation and perfections of the High and Holy One who inhabiteth Eternity.<br><br><b> Hallowed be thy name</b>] De Wette observes: ‘God’s ‘Name is not merely His appellation, which we speak-with the mouth, but also and principally the idea which we attach to it,—His Being, as far as it is confessed, revealed, or known.’ The ‘Name of God’ in Scripture is used to signify that revelation of Himself which He has made to men, which is all that we know of Him: into the depths of His Being, as it is, no human soul can penetrate. Soe John xvii. 6: Rom. ix. 17.<b> Hallow</b> here is in the sense of<b> keep holy, sanctify in our hearts</b>, as in ref. 1 Pet.
