<b> 9.</b>] There is very slender proof of what is often asserted, that our Lord took nearly the whole of this prayer from existing Jewish formal√¶. Not that such a view of the matter would contain in it any thing irreverent or objectionable; for if pious Jews had framed such petitions, our Lord, who came to fulfil every thing that was good under the Old Covenant, might, in a higher sense and spiritual meaning, have recommended the same forms to His disciples. But such does not appear to have been the fact. Lightfoot produces only the most general common-place parallels for the petitions, from the Rabbinical books.
