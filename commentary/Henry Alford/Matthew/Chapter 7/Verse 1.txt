<p><strong> 1.</strong> ] This does not prohibit <em> all</em> judgment (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:20">Matthew 7:20</span> , and 1Co 5:12 ); but, as Augustine (de Serm. Dom. ii. c. 18 (59), vol. iii.) says, ‘Hoc loco nihil aliud nobis præcipi existimo, nisi ut ea facta quæ dubium est quo animo fiant, in meliorem partem interpretemur.’

<p><strong> κρίνειν</strong> has been taken for κατακρίνειν here ( κρίσιν ἐνταῦθα τὴν κατάκρισιν νόησον . Euthym [85] So also Theophylact, Tholuck, Olshausen); and this seems necessary, at least in so far that κρίνειν should be taken as implying an <em> ill judgment</em> . For if the command were merely ‘not to form authoritative judgments of others’ (as given in edn. 1 of this work), the second member, ἵνα μὴ κριθῆτε , would not, in its right interpretation, as applying to <em> God’s</em> judgment of <em> us</em> , correspond. And the μὴ καταδικάζετε , which follows in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:37">Luke 6:37</span> , is perhaps to be taken rather as an epexegesis of κρίνετε , than as a climax after it.

<p><strong> κριθῆτε</strong> ] i.e. ‘ <em> by God</em> ,’ for so doing; a parallel expression to ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:7">Matthew 5:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:15">Matthew 6:15</span> ; not ‘ <em> by others</em> .’ The bare passive, without the agent expressed, and without καί to refer it back to the former member of the clause, is solemn and emphatic. See note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:38">Luke 6:38</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:9">Luke 16:9</span> ; and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:20">Luke 12:20</span> . The sense then is, ‘that you have not to answer before God for your rash judgment and its consequences.’ The same remarks apply to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:2">Matthew 7:2</span> .</p>
