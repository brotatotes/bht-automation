 1. ] This does not prohibit  all judgment (see Matthew 7:20 , and 1Co 5:12 ); but, as Augustine (de Serm. Dom. ii. c. 18 (59), vol. iii.) says, ‘Hoc loco nihil aliud nobis præcipi existimo, nisi ut ea facta quæ dubium est quo animo fiant, in meliorem partem interpretemur.’
	 κρίνειν has been taken for κατακρίνειν here ( κρίσιν ἐνταῦθα τὴν κατάκρισιν νόησον . Euthym [85] So also Theophylact, Tholuck, Olshausen); and this seems necessary, at least in so far that κρίνειν should be taken as implying an  ill judgment . For if the command were merely ‘not to form authoritative judgments of others’ (as given in edn. 1 of this work), the second member, ἵνα μὴ κριθῆτε , would not, in its right interpretation, as applying to  God’s judgment of  us , correspond. And the μὴ καταδικάζετε , which follows in Luke 6:37 , is perhaps to be taken rather as an epexegesis of κρίνετε , than as a climax after it.

Matthew 5:7 ; Matthew 6:15 ; not ‘  by others .’ The bare passive, without the agent expressed, and without καί to refer it back to the former member of the clause, is solemn and emphatic. See note on Luke 6:38 ; Luke 16:9 ; and Luke 12:20 . The sense then is, ‘that you have not to answer before God for your rash judgment and its consequences.’ The same remarks apply to Matthew 7:2 .
