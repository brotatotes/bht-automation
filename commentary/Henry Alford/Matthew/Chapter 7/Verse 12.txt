Mount, p. 143) has noticed Augustine’s refutation of the sneer of infidels (such as Gibbon’s against this precept), that some of our Lord’s sayings have been before written by heathen authors.

This is a most important distinction, and one often overlooked in the interpretation of this golden maxim.
