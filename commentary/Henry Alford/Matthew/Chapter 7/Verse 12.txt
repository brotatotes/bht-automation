<b> 12</b>.] Trench (Serm. on the Mount, p. 148) has noticed Augustine’s refutation of the sneer of infidels (such as Gibbon’s against this precept), that some of our Lord’s sayings have been before written by heathen authors.«Pythagoras said this, Plato said it... Well, if any of them is found to have said a thing which Christ also said, we congratulate him, we do not follow him. But, it is said, he<i> came before</i> Christ. So then, if a man speaks truth, he is to be esteemed prior to truth itself.”<br><br><b> Therefore</b> is the inference indeed from the preceding eleven verses, but<i> immediately</i> from the<b> give good things to them that ask him</b>, just said,—and thus closing this section of the Sermon with a lesson similar to the last verse of ch. v., which is, indeed, the ground-tone of the whole Sermon— ‘Be ye like unto God.”<br><br><b> even so</b>, viz.<i> after the pattern of</i> all<b> things whatsoever</b>: not<i> those</i><i> things</i><i> themselves</i>, because what might suit<i><b> us</b></i>, might not suit others. We are to think what we should like done to<i><b> us</b></i>, and then apply that rule to our dealings with others: viz. by doing to them what we have reason to suppose<i> they would like done to them</i>. This is a most important distinction, and one often overlooked in the interpretation of this golden maxim.
