This is not merely an arbitrary assignment of the<i> because</i>, but there is a deep meaning in it. The reason why so many perish is not that it is eo ordained by God, who will have all to come to the knowledge of the truth, but because so few will come to Christ, that they may have life; and the rest perish in their sins.
