<b> 17. a corrupt tree</b>] See also ch. xiii. 48. From these two verses, 17, 18, the Manichmans defended their heresy of the two natures, good and bad: but Augustine answers them, that such cannot possibly be their meaning, as it is entirely contrary to the whole scope of the passage (see for example ver. 13), and adds, “A bad tree then cannot bear good fruit: but it may, from bad, become good, in order to the bearing good fruit.” On the other hand, these verses were his weapon against the shallow Pelagian scheme, which would look at men’s deeds apart from the living root in man out of which they grew, and suppose that man’s unaided will is capable of good. Trench, Serm. on the Mount, p. 150.
