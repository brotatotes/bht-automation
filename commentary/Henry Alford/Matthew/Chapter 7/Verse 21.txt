<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] <em> The doom of the hypocritical false prophets</em> <em> introduces the doom of all hypocrites, and brings on the solemn close of the whole, in which the hypocrite and the true disciple are parabolically compared</em> .

<p>Observe that here the Lord sets Himself forth as the Judge in the great day, and at the same time speaks not of τὸ θέλ . <strong> μου</strong> , but τὸ θέλ . <strong> τοῦ πατρός μου</strong> : an important and invaluable doctrinal landmark in this very opening of His ministry in the first Gospel.

<p><strong> οὐ πᾶς</strong> is not here ‘ <em> no one</em> ,’ as some (Elsner, Fritzsche) have interpreted it. That meaning would require πᾶς … οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται .

<p>The context must rule the meaning of such wide words as <strong> λέγει</strong> <strong> .</strong> Here it is evidently used of mere lip homage; but in οὐδεὶς δύναται εἰπεῖν Κύριος Ἰησοῦς εἰ μὴ ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span> , the “ <em> saying</em> ” has the deeper meaning of a genuine heartfelt confession. To seek for discrepancies in passages of this kind implies a predisposition to find them: and is to treat Holy Scripture with less than that measure of candour which we give to the writings of one another.</p>
