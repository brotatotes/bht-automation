<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] <strong> πᾶς οὖν ὅστις</strong> is a pendent nominative, of which examples are found in the classics, especially in Plato: so Περσέφαττα δέ , πολλοὶ μὲν καὶ τοῦτο φοβοῦνται τὸ ὄνομα . Cratyl. p. 464 C. See also ib. p. 403 A: Gorg. p. 474 E. Kühner, Gramm. ii. § 508.

<p>Notice the <strong> ὅστις</strong> both times, not merely ὅς . ὅς identifies only: ὅστις classifies.
	</p>
<p><strong> μου</strong> may be <strong> from me,</strong> as in Act 1:4 ref.: and the τούτους makes this perhaps more probable than the ordinary rendering “ <em> these words of mine</em> .”

<p><strong> τοὺς λόγους τούτους</strong> seems to bind together the Sermon, and preclude, as indeed does the whole structure of the Sermon, the supposition that these last chapters are merely a collection of sayings uttered at different times.
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁμοιώσω αὐτόν</strong> (or, <strong> ὁμοιωθήσεται</strong> )] Meyer and Tholuck take this word to signify, not ‘I will <em> compare him</em> ,’ but ‘I will <em> make him like</em> ,’ viz. ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ , as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:8">Matthew 6:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:29">Romans 9:29</span> . But it is, perhaps, more in analogy with the usage of the Lord’s discourses to understand it, <strong> I will compare him:</strong> so ὁμοιώσω , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:10">Matthew 11:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:18">Luke 13:18</span> , and reff.</p>
