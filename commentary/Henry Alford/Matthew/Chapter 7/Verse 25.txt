<b> 25</b>.] This similitude must not be pressed to an allegorical or symbolical meaning in its details, e.g. so that the rain, floods, and winds should mean three distinct kinds of temptation; but the ROCK, as signifying Him who spoke this, is of too frequent use in Scripture for us to overlook it here: cf. 2 Sam. xxii. 2 [Ps. xviii. 2], 82, 47; xxiii. 3: Ps. xxviii. 1; xxxi. 2, al. fr.; lxi. 2: Isa. xxvi. 4 (Heb.); xxxii. 2; xliv. 8 (Heb.): 1 Cor. x. 4, &c. He founds his house on a rock, who, hearing the words of Christ, brings his heart and life into accordance with His expressed will, and is thus by faith in union with Him, founded on Him. he who merely hears His words, but does them not, has never dug down to the rock, nor become united with it, nor has any stability in the hour of trial.
