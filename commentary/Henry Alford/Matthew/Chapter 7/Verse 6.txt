<b> 6.</b>] The connexion, see below.<br><br><b> that which is holy</b>] Some have thought this, in the Greek, to a mistranslation of a Chaldee word signifying an earring, or amulet; but the connexion is not at all improved by it. Pearls bear a resemblance to peas or acorns, the food of swine, but earrings none whatever to the food of dogs. The similitude is derived from “<i>the holy things,</i>”<i> the meat offered tn sacrifice</i>, of which no unclean person was to eat (Lev. xxii. 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16). Similarly in the ancient Christian Liturgies and Fathers, “<i>the holy things</i>” are the consecrated elements in the Holy Communion. Thus interpreted, the saying would be one full of meaning to the<b> Jews</b>. As Dean Trench observes (Serm. Mount, p. 186), “It is not that the dogs would not eat it, for it would be welcome to them; but that it would be a profanation to give it to them, Exod. xxii. 31.” The other part of the similitude is of a different character, and belongs entirely to the swine, who having cast to them pearls, something like their natural food, whose valué is inappreciable by them, in fury trample them with their and turning against the donor, rend him with their tusks. The connexion with the foregoing and following verses is this: “<i>Judge not,”&c.; “attempt not the correction of others, when you need it far more yourselves:</i>” still, “<i>be not such mere children, as not to distinguish the characters of those with whom you have to do. Give not that which is holy to dogs,</i>”&c. Then, as a humble hearer might be disposed to reply, ‘<i>if this last be a measure of the divine dealings, what bounties can I expect at God’s hand?</i>” (vor. 7), ‘<i>ask of God, and He will give to each of you: for this is His own will, that you shall obtain by asking</i> (ver. 8),—<i>good things, good for each in his place and degree</i> (vv. 10, 11),<i> not unwholesome or unfitting things</i>. Therefore (ver. 12)<i> do ye the same to others, as ye wish to be done, and as God does, to you: viz. give that which is good for each, to each, not Judging uncharitably on the one hand, nor casting pearls before swine on the other</i>.’
