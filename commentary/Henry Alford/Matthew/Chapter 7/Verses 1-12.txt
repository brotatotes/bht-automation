<p><strong> 1 12.</strong> ] <em> Of our</em> CONDUCT TOWARDS OTHER MEN: <em> parenthetically illustrated</em> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7-11">Matthew 7:7-11</span> , <em> by the benignity and wisdom of God in his dealings with us</em> . The connexion with the last chapter is <em> immediately</em> , the word <strong> κακία</strong> <strong> ,</strong> in which a glance is given by the Saviour at the misery and sinfulness of human life at its best; and now precepts follow, teaching us how we are to live in such a world, and among others sinful like ourselves: <em> mediately</em> , and more generally, the continuing caution against hypocrisy, in ourselves and in others.</p>
