<b> 2</b>.] This same miracle is related by St. Luke with-out any mark of definiteness, either as to time or place,— “<i>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city</i>.-..” In this instance there is, and can be, no doubt that the transactions are identical: and this may serve us as a key-note, by which the less obvious and more intricate harmonies of these two narrations may be ar-ranged. The plain assertion of the account in the text requires that the leper should have met our Lord on His descent from the mountain, while great multitudes were following Him. The accounts in St. Luke and St. Mark require no such fixed date. This narrative therefore fixes the occurrence. I conceive it highly probable that St. Matthew was himself a hearer of the Sermon, and one of those who followed our Lord at this time. From St. Luke’s account, the miracle was performed in, or rather, perhaps, in the neighbourhood of, some city: what city, does not appear. As the leper is in all three accounts related to have<i> come</i> to Jesus ( “<i>And behold</i>” implying it in Luke), he may have been outside the city, and have run into it to our Lord.
