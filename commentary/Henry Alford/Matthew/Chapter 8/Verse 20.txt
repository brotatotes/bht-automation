 20.   ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ] “It is thought that this phrase was taken from Daniel 7:13 , to which passage our Saviour seems to allude in ch. Matthew 26:64 , and probably Stephen in Acts 7:56 . It appears from John 12:34 , that the Jews understood it to mean the Messiah: and from Luke 22:69-70 , that they considered  the Son of Man to mean the same as  the Son of God .” Dr. Burton. It is the name by which the Lord ordinarily in one pregnant word designates Himself as the Messiah the  Son of God manifested in the flesh of man the  second Adam . And to it belong all those conditions, of humiliation, suffering, and exaltation, which it behoved the Son of Man to go through.
