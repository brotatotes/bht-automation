<p><strong> 21.</strong> ] In St. Luke we find, that our Lord <em> previously commanded him</em> to follow Him. τοῦ κυρίου .… λέγοντος <strong> τῷ Φιλίππῳ</strong> <strong> ,</strong> ἄφες τοὺς νεκ . κ . τ . λ . Clem. Alex [101] Strom. iii. 4 (25), p. 522 [102] . But if so, He had long ago ordered Philip to follow Him, taking St. Luke’s order of the occurrence. A tradition of this nature was hardly likely to be wrong; so that perhaps the words <strong> ἀκολούθει μοι</strong> are to be taken (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:19">John 21:19</span> ; Joh 21:22 ) as an admonition occasioned by some slackness or symptom of decadence on the part of the Apostle. The attempt to evade the strong words of our Lord’s command by supposing that <strong> θάψαι τὸν πατέρα</strong> means, ‘ <em> to reside with my father till his death</em> ’ (Theophylact), is evidently futile, since <strong> πρῶτον ἀπελθεῖν καὶ θάψαι</strong> is plainly said of an <em> act waiting to be done;</em> and the reason of our Lord’s rebuke was the peremptory and all-superseding nature of the command ἀκολούθει μοι .

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [102] By these symbols are designated the portions of two ancient MSS., discernible (as also are fragments of Ulphilas’ gothic version) under the later writing of a volume known as the Codex Carolinus in the Ducal Library at Wolfenbüttel. P (GUELPHERBYTANUS A) contains fragments of each of the Gospels. Q (GUELPH. B) fragments of Luke and John. Both are probably of the <em> sixth century</em> . They were edited by F. A. Knittel in 1762; and, more thoroughly, by Tischendorf in 1860 [1869], Monumenta Sacra, vol. iii. [vi.]</p>
