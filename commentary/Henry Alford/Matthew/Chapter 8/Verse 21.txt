 21. ] In St. Luke we find, that our Lord  previously commanded him to follow Him. τοῦ κυρίου .… λέγοντος  τῷ Φιλίππῳ  , ἄφες τοὺς νεκ . κ . τ . λ . Clem. Alex [101] Strom. iii. 4 (25), p. 522 [102] . But if so, He had long ago ordered Philip to follow Him, taking St. Luke’s order of the occurrence. A tradition of this nature was hardly likely to be wrong; so that perhaps the words  ἀκολούθει μοι are to be taken (as in John 21:19 ; Joh 21:22 ) as an admonition occasioned by some slackness or symptom of decadence on the part of the Apostle. The attempt to evade the strong words of our Lord’s command by supposing that  θάψαι τὸν πατέρα means, ‘  to reside with my father till his death ’ (Theophylact), is evidently futile, since  πρῶτον ἀπελθεῖν καὶ θάψαι is plainly said of an  act waiting to be done; and the reason of our Lord’s rebuke was the peremptory and all-superseding nature of the command ἀκολούθει μοι .

	 [102] By these symbols are designated the portions of two ancient MSS., discernible (as also are fragments of Ulphilas’ gothic version) under the later writing of a volume known as the Codex Carolinus in the Ducal Library at Wolfenbüttel. P (GUELPHERBYTANUS A) contains fragments of each of the Gospels. Q (GUELPH. B) fragments of Luke and John. Both are probably of the  sixth century . They were edited by F. A. Knittel in 1762; and, more thoroughly, by Tischendorf in 1860 [1869], Monumenta Sacra, vol. iii. [vi.]
