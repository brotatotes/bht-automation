<b> 25</b>.]<b> Lord, save us: we perish =</b><i> Master, carest thou not that we perish</i>, Mark iv. 38 =<i> Master, Master, we perish</i>, Luke viii. 24. On these and such like variations, notice the following excellent and important remarks of Augustine: “The sense of the disciples waking the Lord and seeking to be saved, is one and the same: nor is it worth while to enquire which of these three was really said to Christ. For whether they said any one of these three, or other words which no one of the Evangelists has mentioned, but of similar import as to the truth of the sense, what matters it?” We may wish that he had alway spoken thus. Mach useless labour might have been and men’s minds led to the diligent enquiry into the real difficulties of the Gospels, instead of so many spending time in knitting cobwebs. But Augustine himself in the very next sentence descends to the unsatisfactory ground of the Harmonists,<i> when he adds. “Though it may be also, that when many were calling upon Him, all these may have been said, one by one, another by another</i>.” His mind however was not one to rest contented with such sophisms; and all his deeper und more earnest sayings are in the truer and freer spirit of the above extract. The above remarks are more than ever important, now that a reaction towards the low literal harmonistic view has set in, and the inspiration of the mere letter is set up against those who seek for life in searching the real spirit of the Scriptures.
