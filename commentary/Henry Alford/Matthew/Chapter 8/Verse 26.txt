<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] The time of this rebuke in the text precedes, but in Mark and Luke follows, the stilling of the storm. See the last note.

<p>They were of <em> little</em> faith, in that they were afraid of perishing while they had on board the slumbering Saviour: they were not <em> faithless</em> , for they had recourse to that Saviour to help them. Therefore He acknowledges the faith which they had; answers the prayer of faith, by working a perfect calm: but rebukes them for not having the stronger, firmer faith, to trust Him even when He seemed insensible to their danger.

<p>The symbolic application of this occurrence is too striking to have escaped general notice. The Saviour with the company of His disciples in the ship tossed on the waves, seemed a typical reproduction of the Ark bearing mankind on the flood, and a foreshadowing of the Church tossed by the tempests of this world, but having Him with her always. And the personal application is one of comfort, and strengthening of faith, in danger and doubt.</p>
