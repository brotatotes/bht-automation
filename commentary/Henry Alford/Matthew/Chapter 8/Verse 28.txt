<b> 28</b>.] The time of this rebuke in the text precedes, but in Mark and Luke follows, the stilling of the storm. See the last note. ey were of<i> little</i> faith, in that they were afraid of perishing while they had on board the slumbering Saviour: they were not<i> faithless</i>, for they had recourse to that Saviour to help them. Therefore He acknowledges the faith which they had; answers the prayer of faith, by working a perfect calm: but rebukes them for not having the stronger, firmer faith, to trust Him even when He seemed insensible to their danger.<br><br><b> 28.]</b> Among the difficulties attendant on this narrative, the situation and name of the place where the event happened are not the least. Origen discusses the three,<i> Gerasa</i>, which he found in the text in his time, but pronounces to be a city of Arabia, having no sea or lake near it,—<i>Gadara</i>, which he found in a few MSS., but disapproves, as a city of Judæa, not near any lake or sea with cliffs;—and<i> Gergesa</i>, which he says is a city on the lake of Tiberias, with a cliff hanging over the lake, where the spot of the miracle was shewn. Notwithstanding this, it appears very doubtful whether there ever was a town named Gergesha (or-sa) near the lake. There were the Gergashites (Joseph. i. 6. 2) in former days, but their towns had been destroyed by the Israelites at their first irruption, and never, that we hear of, afterwards rebuilt (see Deut. vii. 1: Josh. xxiv. 11). Gerasa (now Dscherasch) lies much too far to the East. The town of Gadara, alluded to in the text, was a strong chief city in Peræa, opposite Scythopolis and Tiberias to the East, in the mountain, at whose foot were the well-known warm baths. It was on the river Hieromax, and sixty stadia from Tiberias, a Greek city (see raff. to Josephus and Eusebius in my Gr. Test.). It was destroyed in the civil wars of the Jews, and rebuilt by Pompeius, presented by Augustus to King Herod, and after his death united to the province of Syria. It was one of the ten cities of Decapolis. Burckhardt and others believe that they have found its ruins at Omkeis, near the ridge of the chain which divides the valley of Jordan from that of the sea of Tiberias. The territory of this city might well extend to the shore of the lake. It may be observed, that there is nothing in any of the three accounts to imply that the city was close to the scene of the miracle, or the scene of the miracle close to the herd of swine, or the herd of swine, at the time of their possession, close to the lake. Indeed the expression “<i>a good way off from them,</i>” ver. 30, implies the contrary with regard to the swine. It appears, from Burckhardt, that there are many tombs in the neighbourhood of the ruins of Gadara to this day, hewn in the rock, and thus capable of affording shelter. It may be well in fairness to observe, that “<i>Gergesenes</i>” can hardly have arisen, as sometimes represented, entirely from Origen’s conjecture, as it pervades so many MSS. and ancient (it is true, not the<i> most</i> ancient) versions. We cannot say that a part of the territory of Gadara may not have been known to those who, like Matthew, were locally intimate with the shores of the lake, by this ancient and generally disused name. Still however, we are, I conceive, bound in a matter of this kind to follow the most ancient extant testimony. See further on the parallel places in Mark and Luke.
