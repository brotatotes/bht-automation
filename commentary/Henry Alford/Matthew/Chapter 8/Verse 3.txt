<b> 3. touched him</b>] He who just now expansively fulfilled the law by<i> word and commands</i>, now does the same by<i> act and deed</i>: the law had forbidden the touching of the leper, Levit. v. 3. It was an act which stood on the same ground as the healing on the Sabbath, of which we have so many instances. So likewise the prophets Elijah and Elisha touched the dead in the working of a miracle on them (1 Kings xvii. 21: 2 Kings iv. 34). The same almighty power which suspends natural laws, supersedes ceremonial laws.<br><br> Here is a noble example illustrating His own precept so lately delivered, ‘Give to him that asketh thee.’ Again, we can hardly forbear to recognize, in His touching the leper, a deed symbolic of His taking on him, touching, laying bold of, our nature. The same remarkable word is used in the Greek in Luke xiv. 4, “and<b> taking hold</b> of him, he healed him,” and in Heb. ii. 16, “He<b> taketh</b> not<b> hold of angels</b>, but he<b> taketh hold</b> of the seed of Abraham.”
