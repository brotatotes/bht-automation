<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> ἥψατο αὐτοῦ</strong> ] He who just now expansively fulfilled the law by <em> word and commands</em> , now does the same by <em> act and deed:</em> the law had forbidden the touching of the leper, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="le+5:3">Leviticus 5:3</span> . It was an act which stood on the same ground as the healing on the Sabbath, of which we have so many instances. So likewise the prophets Elijah and Elisha touched the dead in the working of a miracle on them (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+17:21">1 Kings 17:21</span> ; 2Ki 4:34 ). The same almighty power which suspends natural laws, supersedes ceremonial laws.

<p>Here is a noble example illustrating His own precept so lately delivered, ‘Give to him that asketh thee.’ Again, we can hardly forbear to recognize, in His touching the leper, a deed symbolic of His taking on him, touching, laying hold of, our nature. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:4">Luke 14:4</span> , καὶ ἐπιλαβόμενος ἰάσατο αὐτόν , with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16">Hebrews 2:16</span> , σπέρματος Ἀβραὰμ ἐπιλαμβάνεται .

<p><strong> ἐκαθ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἡ λέπ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Luke’s words ( Mat 8:13 ), ἡ λέπρα ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ ʼ αὐτοῦ , are more strictly correct in construction. See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:42">Mark 1:42</span> . A curious instance of the theological littleness which has been shewn in treating our Lord’s great acts of Divine Love, is cited here by Bp. Wordsw. from Ambrose: “Dicit ‘volo’ propter Photinum (who said that our Lord was a mere man): imperat propter Arium (who denied His equality with the Father): tangit propter Manichæum (who said that Christ had not human flesh, but was only a phantom).”</p>
