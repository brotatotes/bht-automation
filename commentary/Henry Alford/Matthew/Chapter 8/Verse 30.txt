<p><strong> 30. </strong> <strong> μακράν</strong> ] The Vulgate rendering, ‘ <em> non</em> longe,’ does not seem accordant with the other accounts, both of which imply distance: ἦν δὲ ἐκεῖ πρὸς τῷ ὄρει , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:11">Mark 5:11</span> ; ἦν δὲ ἐκεῖ .… ἐν τῷ ὄρει , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:32">Luke 8:32</span> . These, especially the first, would seem to imply that the swine were on the hills, and the scene of the miracle at some little distance, on the plain.</p>
