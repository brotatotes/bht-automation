 14 17. ] HEALING OF PETER’S WIFE’S MOTHER, AND MANY OTHERS. Mark 1:29-34 .Luke 4:38-41; Luke 4:38-41 . From the other Evangelists it appears, that our Lord had just healed a dæmoniac in the synagogue at Capernaum: for they both state, ‘when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, &c.’ Both Mark and Luke are fuller in their accounts than the text. The expression (of the fever)  ἀφῆκεν αὐτήν is common to the three, as is also the circumstance of her ministering  immediately after: shewing that the fever left her, not, as it would have done if natural means had been used, weak and exhausted, but completely restored.
