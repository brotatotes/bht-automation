<p><strong> 14 17.</strong> ] HEALING OF PETER’S WIFE’S MOTHER, AND MANY OTHERS. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:29-34">Mark 1:29-34</span> .<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:38-41">Luke 4:38-41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:38-41">Luke 4:38-41</span> . From the other Evangelists it appears, that our Lord had just healed a dæmoniac in the synagogue at Capernaum: for they both state, ‘when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, &amp;c.’ Both Mark and Luke are fuller in their accounts than the text. The expression (of the fever) <strong> ἀφῆκεν αὐτήν</strong> is common to the three, as is also the circumstance of her ministering <em> immediately</em> after: shewing that the fever left her, not, as it would have done if natural means had been used, weak and exhausted, but completely restored.</p>
