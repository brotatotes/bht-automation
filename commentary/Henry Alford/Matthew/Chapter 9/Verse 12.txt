<b> 12. whole... sick</b>] Both words, in the application of the saying, must be understood<i> subjectively</i> (an ironical concession, as Calvin, Meyer): as referring to their respective opinions of themselves; as also<b> righteous</b> and<b> sinners</b>, ver. 13:—not as though the Pharisees were<i> objectively</i> either “<i>whole</i>” or “<i>righteous</i>,” however much objective truth “<i>sick</i>” and “<i>sinners</i>” may have had as applied to the publicans and sinners.
