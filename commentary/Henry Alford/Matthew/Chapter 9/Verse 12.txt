 12.   ἰσχύοντες  .…   κακῶς ἔχ  . ] Both words, in the application of the saying, must be understood  subjectively (‘ironica concessio,’ Calvin, Meyer): as referring to their respective opinions of themselves; as also δικαιους and ἁμαρτωλούς , Matthew 9:13 : not as though the Pharisees were  objectively either ἰσχύοντες or δίκαιοι , however much objective truth κακῶς ἔχοντες and ἁμαρτωλοί may have had as applied to the publicans and sinners.
