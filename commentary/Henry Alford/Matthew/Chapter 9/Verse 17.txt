And admirably does the parable describe the vanity of the attempt to keep the new wine in the<i> old skin</i>, the old ceremonial man, unrenewed in the spirit of his mind:<i> the skins are broken</i>: the new wine is something too living and strong for so weak a moral frame; it shatters the fair outside of ceremonial seeming; and<i> the wine runneth out</i>, the spirit is lost; the man is neither a blameless Jew nor a faithful Christian; both are spoiled. And then the result: not merely the damaging, but the utter destruction of the vessel,—<i>the skins perish</i>.
