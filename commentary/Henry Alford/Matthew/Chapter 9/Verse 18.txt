<p><strong> 18. </strong> <strong> ἄρχων</strong> ] A <em> ruler of the synagogue</em> , named Jaeirus. In all except the connecting words, ταῦτα αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος αὐτοῖς , and <strong> εἰσ</strong> ελθ ., which seems to imply that our Lord was still in Levi’s house, the account in the text is summary, and deficient in particularity. I have therefore reserved full annotation for the account in Luke, which see throughout.

<p><strong> ἄρτι ἐτελεύτησεν</strong> ] She was <em> not dead</em> , but <em> dying:</em> at the last extremity. St. Matthew, omitting the message from the ruler’s house (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:35">Mark 5:35</span> ; Luk 8:49 ), gives the matter summarily in these words.</p>
