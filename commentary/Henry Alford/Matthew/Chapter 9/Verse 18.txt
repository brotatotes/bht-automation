<b> 18. a certain ruler</b>] A<i> ruler of the synagogue</i>, named Jaeirus. In all except the connecting words, “<i>while he spake these things unto them,</i>” the account in the text is summary, and deficient in particularity. I have therefore reserved full annotation for the account, in Luke, which see throughout.<br><br><b> is even now dead</b>] She was<i> not dead</i>, but<i> dying</i>; at the last extremity. St. Matthew, omitting the message from the ruler’s house (Mark v. 35: Luke viii. 49), gives the matter summarily in these words.
