 18.   ἄρχων ] A  ruler of the synagogue , named Jaeirus. In all except the connecting words, ταῦτα αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος αὐτοῖς , and  εἰσ ελθ ., which seems to imply that our Lord was still in Levi’s house, the account in the text is summary, and deficient in particularity. I have therefore reserved full annotation for the account in Luke, which see throughout.
	 ἄρτι ἐτελεύτησεν ] She was  not dead , but  dying: at the last extremity. St. Matthew, omitting the message from the ruler’s house (Mark 5:35 ; Luk 8:49 ), gives the matter summarily in these words.
