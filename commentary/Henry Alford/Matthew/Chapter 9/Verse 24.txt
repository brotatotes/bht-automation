And if it be answered that there He explains the sleep to <em> mean death</em> , we answer, that this explanation is only in consequence of the disciples misunderstanding his words. In both cases the words are most probably used <em> with reference to the speedy awakening which was to follow</em> , as Fritzsche (cited by Trench, Miracles, p. 183): ‘Puellam ne pro mortua habetote, sed dormire existimatote, quippe in vitam mox redituram.’ Luke appends, after κατ . αὐτ ., εἰδότες ὅτι ἀπέθανεν , in which words there is at least no recognition by the Evangelist of a mere apparent death.</p>
