And if it be answered that there He explains the sleep to<i> mean death</i>, we answer, that this explanation is only in consequence of the disciples misunderstanding his words. In both cases the words are most probably used<i> with reference to the speedy awaken-ing which was to follow</i>; “Think not the damsel dead, but sleeping; for she shall soon return to life.” Luke: appends, after “<i>they laughed him to scorn,</i>’— “<i>knowing that she was dead,</i>” in which words there is at least no recognition by the Evangelist of a mere apparent death.<b> 25.</b>]<b> took her by the hand</b> is common to the three Evangelists.
