<b> 29.</b>]<i> Touching</i>, or<i> anointing</i> the eyes, was the ordinary method which our Lord took of impressing on the blind the action of the divine power which healed them. Ch. xx. 34: Mark viii. 25: John ix. 6. In this miracle however we have this peculiar feature, that no direct word of power passes from our Lord, but a relative concession, making that which was done<i> a measure of the faith</i> of the blind men: and from the result the degree of their faith appears. Stier remarks, “We may already notice, in the history of this first period of our Lord’s ministry, that, from having at first yielded immediately to the request for healing, He begins, by degrees, to prove and exercise the faith of the applicants.”
