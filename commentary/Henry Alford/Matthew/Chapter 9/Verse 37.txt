Chrysostom remarks that we see not only our Lord’s freedom from vainglory, in sending out his disciples rather than drawing all notice to Himself, but His wisdom, in giving them this preliminary practice for their future work: making, as he expresses it,<i> Palestine</i> a<i> palæstra</i> for the world.<br><br> The Lord, says Chrysostom, having given this command, does not join them in such a prayer, but Himself sends them out as labourers—shewing plainly that He Himself is the Lord of the harvest, and recalling to them the Baptist’s image of the threshing-floor, and One who shall purge it.
