<b> 5.</b>] “In our Lord’s argument it must be carefully noted, that He does not ask,<i> which is easiest</i>, to<i> forgive sins</i>, or to<i> raise a sick man</i>—for it could not be affirmed that that of forgiving was easier than this of healing—but, which is easiest, to<i> claim this power</i> or<i> that, to say</i>, Thy sins be forgiven thee, or<i> to say</i>, Arise and walk? That (i. e. the former) is easiest, and I will now prove my right to say it, by saying with effect and with an outward consequence setting its seal to my truth, the harder word, Arise and walk. By doing that, which is capable of being put to the proof, I will vindicate my right and power to do that which in its very nature is incapable of being proved. By these visible tides of God’s grace I will give you to know in what direction the great under-currents of His love are setting, and that both are obedient to My word. From this, which I will now do openly and before you all, you may conclude that it is ‘no robbery’: (Phil. ii. 6, but see note there) upon my part to claim also the power of forgiving men their sins.” Trench on the Miracles, p. 206.
