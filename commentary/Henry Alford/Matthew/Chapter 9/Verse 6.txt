<p><strong> 6. </strong> <strong> ὁ υἱ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀνθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] The Messiah: an expression regarded by the Jews as equivalent to ὁ χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:63">Matthew 26:63</span> . See also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:27">John 5:27</span> . “The Alexandrian Fathers, in their conflict with the Nestorians, made use of this passage in proof of the entire transference which there was of all the properties of Christ’s divine nature to His human; so that whatever one had, was so far common, that it might also be predicated of the other. It is quite true that had not the two natures been indissolubly knit together in a single Person, no such language could have been used; yet I should rather suppose that ‘Son of Man’ being the standing title whereby the Lord was well pleased to designate Himself, bringing out by it that He was at once one with humanity, and the crown of humanity, He does not so use it that the title is every where to be pressed, but at times simply as equivalent to Messiah.” Trench, p. 208.

<p><strong> ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς</strong> ] Distinguished from ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ , as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:19">Matthew 16:19</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:18">Matthew 18:18</span> . Bengel finely remarks, “Cœlestem ortum hic sermo sapit.” The Son of Man, as God manifest in man’s flesh, has on man’s earth that power, which in its fountain and essence belongs to God in heaven. And this not by delegation, but “because He (being God) is the Son of Man.” <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:27">John 5:27</span> .

<p><strong> τότε λέγει τῷ π</strong> <strong> .</strong> is not parenthetic, nor is <strong> ἵνα δὲ εἰδῆτε</strong> κ . τ . λ . an elliptic sentence; but the speech and narrative are intermixed. A simple construction would require either ἵνα δὲ <strong> εἰδῆτε</strong> <strong> .</strong> … ὧδε λέγω τῷ παρ …, or ἵνα δὲ εἰδῶσιν … <strong> τότε λέγει</strong> <strong> …</strong> We have, in the text, the first member of the former construction joined with the second of the latter.</p>
