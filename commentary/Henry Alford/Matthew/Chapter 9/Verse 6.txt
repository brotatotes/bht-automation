<b> 6. the Son of man</b>] The Messiah: an expression regarded by the Jews as equivalent to “<i>the Christ, the Son of God,”</i> ch. xxvi. 63. See also John v. 27. “The Alexandrian Fathers, in their conflict with the Nestorians, made use of this passage in proof of the entire transference which there was of all the properties of Christ’s divine nature to His human; so that whatever one had, was so far common, that it might also be predicated of the other. It is quite true that had not the two natures Been indissolubly knit together in a single Person, no such language could have been used; yet I should rather suppose that ‘Son of Man’ being the standing title whereby the Lord was well pleased to designate Himself, bringing out by it that He was at once one with humanity, and the crown of humanity, He does not so use it that the title is every where to be pressed, but at times simply as equivalent to Messiah.” Trench, p. 208.<br><br><b> on earth</b>] Distinguished from “<i>in heaven,</i>” as in ch. xvi. 19; xviii. 18. Bengel finely remarks, “This saying savours of heavenly origin.” The Son of Man, as God manifest in man’s flesh, has on man’s earth that power, which in its fountain and essence belongs to God in heaven. And this not by delegation, but “because He (being God) is the Son of Man.” John v. 27.<br><br><b> then saith he</b>] See a similar interchange of the persons in construction, Gen. iii. 22, 23.
