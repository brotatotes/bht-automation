<b> 8. unto men</b>] Not plur. for sing. ‘<i>to a man,</i>’ nor, ‘<i>for the benefit of men;</i>’ but<b> to mankind</b>. They regarded this wonder-working as something by God granted to men—to mankind; and without supposing that<i> they</i> had before them the full meaning of their words, those words were true in the very highest sense. See John xvii. 8. In Mark they say, “<i>We never saw it in this fashion:</i>” in Luke, “<i>We have seen strange things to-day.</i>”<br><br> On the other hand, (3)<i> our Gospel makes not the slightest allusion to the name of Levi</i>, either here, or in ch. x. 3, where we find “<i>Matthew the publican</i>” among the Apostles, clearly identified with the subject of this narrative: whereas the<i> other two Evangelists</i>, having in this narrative spoken of Levi in their enumerations of the Apostles (Mark iii. 18; Luke vi. 15),<i> mention Matthew without any note of</i><i> identification with the Levi called on this occasion</i>. This is almost inexplicable, on the supposition of his having borne both names. (4)<i> Early tradition separates the two persons</i>. Clement of Alexandria, quoting from Heracleon the Gnostic, mentions Matthew, Philip, Thomas, Levi, and many others, as eminent men who had not suffered martyrdom from a public confession of the faith. (5) Again, Origen, when Celsus has called the Apostles publicans and sailors, after acknowledging Matthew the publican, adds, “And there may be also Levi a publican among Jesus’s followers. But he was not of the number of His Apostles, except according to some copies of Mark’s Gospel.” It is not quite clear from this, whether the copies of Mark substituted Levi’s (?) name for Matthew’s, or for some other: but most probably the latter. (6) It certainly would hence appear, as if there were in ancient times an idea that the two names belonged to distinct persons. But in the very passages where it is mentioned, a confusion is evident, which prevents us from drawing any certain conclusion able to withstand the general testimony to the contrary, arising from the prima facie view of the Gospel narrative. (7) It is probable enough that St. Matthew, in his own Gospel, would<i> mention only his apostolic name</i>, seeing that St. Mark and St. Luke also give him this name,<i> when they speak of him as an Apostle</i>. (8) It is remarkable, as an indication that St. Matthew's frequently unprecise manner of narration did not proceed from want of information,—that in this case, when he of all men must have been best informed, his own account is the least precise of the three. (9) With regard to the narrative itself in the text, we may observe, that this solemn and peculiar call seems (see ch. iv. 19, 22)<i> hardly to belong to any but an Apostle</i>; and that, as in the case of Peter, it here also<i> implies</i><i> a previous acquaintance and discipleship</i>. (10) We are told in Luke v. 29, that Levi<i> made him a great feast in his house</i>; and, similarly, Mark has “<i>in his house.</i>” The narrative in our text is so closely identical with that in Mark, that it is impossible to suppose, with Greswell, that a different feast is intended. The arguments by which he supports his view are by no means weighty. From the words<b> the house</b>, he infers that the house was not that of Matthew, but that in which our Lord usually dwelt, which he supposes to be intended in several other places. But surely the article might be used without any such significance, or designating any particular house,—as would be very likely if Matthew himself is here the narrator. Again, Greswell presses to verbal accuracy the terms used in the accounts, and attempts to shew them to be inconsistent with one another. But surely the time is past for such dealing with the historic text of the Gospels; and, besides, he has overlooked a great inconsistency in his own explanation, viz. that of making in the second instance, according to him, Scribes and Pharisees present at the feast given by a Publican, and exclaiming against that which they themselves were doing. It was not<i> at</i>, but<i> after</i> the feast that the discourse in vv. 11–17 took place. And his whole inference, that the<i> great feast</i> must be the great meal in the day, and consequently in the evening, hangs on too slender a thread to need refutation. The real difficulty, insuperable to a Harmonist, is the connexion here of the raising of Jaeirus’s daughter with this feast: on which see below, ver. 18.
