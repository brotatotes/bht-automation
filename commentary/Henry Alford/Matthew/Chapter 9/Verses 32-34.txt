 32 34. ] HEALING OF A DUMB DÆMONIAC.  Peculiar to Matthew . The word ἐξερχομένων , being a present participle, places this miracle in direct connexion with the foregoing. This narration has a singular affinity with that in ch. Matthew 12:22 , or still more with its parallel in Luke 11:14 . In both, the same expression of wonder follows; the same calumny of the Pharisees; only that in ch. 12 the dæmoniac is said (not in Luk 11:1-54 ) to have been likewise blind. These circumstances, coupled with the immediate connexion of  this miracle with the cure of the blind men, and the mention of ‘the Son of David’ in both, have led some to suppose that the account in ch. 12 is a repetition, or slightly differing version of the account in our text, intermingled also with the preceding healing of the blind. But the supposition seems unnecessary, as, the habit of the Pharisees once being to ascribe our Lord’s expulsion of devils to Beelzebub, the repetition of the remark would be natural: and the other coincidences, though considerable, are not exact enough to warrant it.
	This was a dumbness  caused by dæmoniacal possession: for the difference between this and the natural infirmity of a deaf and dumb man, see Mark 7:31-37 .
