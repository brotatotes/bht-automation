And here, as beyond doubt in ver. 20, there certainly appears to be a play on the name, although for the words<i> profitable</i> and<i> unprofitable</i> he does not here use the same root as occurs in<i> Onesimus</i> (in ver. 20 he<i> does</i>). He had been unprofitable in having run away, and apparently (ver. 18) defrauded his master as well.
