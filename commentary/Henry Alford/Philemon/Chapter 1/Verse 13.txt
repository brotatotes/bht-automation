	 ἐβουλόμην , nearly as ηὐχόμην , in Romans 9:3 (though in that place there certainly is, as Ellic. remarks, a more distinct reference to a suppressed conditional clause),  was wishing, had a mind , =  could have wished , in our idiom.
	 ἠθέλησα , Philemon 1:14 , differs from  ἐβουλόμην , (1) in that it means simply  willed , as distinguished from the stronger  wished , (2) in that it marks the time immediately preceding the return of Onesimus, whereas the imperfect spreads the wish over the period previous.  I was (long)  minded … but (on considering)  I was not willing .
	 ὑπὲρ σοῦ ] For, wert thou here, thou wouldst minister to me: I was minded therefore to retain him in thy place. διακονῇ , pres. subj. representing the ἐβουλόμην as a still continuing wish.
	 ἐν τοῖς δεσμ  .   τοῦ εὐαγγελίου ] explained wel by Thdrt., ὀφείλεις μοι διακονίαν ὡς μαθητὴς διδασκάλῳ , κ . διδασκάλῳ τὰ θεῖα κηρύττοντι : not without allusion also to the fetters which the Gospel had laid on himself.
