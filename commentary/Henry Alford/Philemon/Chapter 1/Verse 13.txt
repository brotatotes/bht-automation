<p><strong> ἠθέλησα</strong> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:14">Philemon 1:14</span> , differs from <strong> ἐβουλόμην</strong> , (1) in that it means simply <strong> willed</strong> , as distinguished from the stronger <strong> wished</strong> , (2) in that it marks the time immediately preceding the return of Onesimus, whereas the imperfect spreads the wish over the period previous. <strong> I was</strong> (long) <strong> minded … but</strong> (on considering) <strong> I was not willing</strong> .
