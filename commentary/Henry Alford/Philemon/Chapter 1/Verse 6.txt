<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <strong> ὅπως</strong> belongs, as usually constructed, to the former clause, εὐχαριστῶ προσευχῶν μου . The mixing of prayer and thanksgiving in that clause does not exclude the idea of intercessory prayer, nor does (as Meyer maintains) the subsequent clause make against this: the ἀκούων κ . τ . λ . was the reason why he ηὐχαρίστει ἐπὶ τῶν προσευχῶν αὐτοῦ , and ὅπως κ . τ . λ . the aim of his doing so. To join ὅπως κ . τ . λ . with ἣν ἔχεις is flat in the extreme, and perfectly inconceivable as a piece of St. Paul’s writing. <strong> In order that the communication of thy faith</strong> (with others) <strong> may become effectual in</strong> (as the element in which it works) <strong> the thorough knowledge</strong> (entire appreciation and experimental recognition (by us)) <strong> of every good thing</strong> (good gifts and graces, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:18">Romans 7:18</span> , the negation of this in the carnal man) <strong> which is in us, to</strong> (the glory of; connect with ἐνεργὴς γένηται ) <strong> Christ</strong> [ <strong> Jesus</strong> ]. This seems the only simple and unobjectionable rendering. To understand <strong> ἡ κοιν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῆς π</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σου</strong> , ‘fides tua quam communem nobiscum habes,’ as Bengel (and indeed Chrys., Thl., al.), is very objectionable: to join <strong> εἰς χρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> [ <strong> Ἰησ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] with <strong> πίστεως</strong> (Calv., Est., al.) still more so: to render ἐπίγνωσις passively, ‘ <em> recognition by others</em> ’ (‘ παθητικῶς <em> sumitur habetque innotescendi significationem</em> ,’ Grot.: so Erasm., Beza, Est., all.) worst of all. The interpretation given above, I find in the main to be that of De W., Meyer, and Koch.</p>
