 6 .]  ὅπως belongs, as usually constructed, to the former clause, εὐχαριστῶ προσευχῶν μου . The mixing of prayer and thanksgiving in that clause does not exclude the idea of intercessory prayer, nor does (as Meyer maintains) the subsequent clause make against this: the ἀκούων κ . τ . λ . was the reason why he ηὐχαρίστει ἐπὶ τῶν προσευχῶν αὐτοῦ , and ὅπως κ . τ . λ . the aim of his doing so. To join ὅπως κ . τ . λ . with ἣν ἔχεις is flat in the extreme, and perfectly inconceivable as a piece of St. Paul’s writing.  In order that the communication of thy faith (with others)  may become effectual in (as the element in which it works)  the thorough knowledge (entire appreciation and experimental recognition (by us))  of every good thing (good gifts and graces, cf. Romans 7:18 , the negation of this in the carnal man)  which is in us, to (the glory of; connect with ἐνεργὴς γένηται )  Christ [  Jesus ]. This seems the only simple and unobjectionable rendering. To understand  ἡ κοιν  .   τῆς π  .   σου , ‘fides tua quam communem nobiscum habes,’ as Bengel (and indeed Chrys., Thl., al.), is very objectionable: to join  εἰς χρ  . [  Ἰησ  . ] with  πίστεως (Calv., Est., al.) still more so: to render ἐπίγνωσις passively, ‘  recognition by others ’ (‘ παθητικῶς  sumitur habetque innotescendi significationem ,’ Grot.: so Erasm., Beza, Est., all.) worst of all. The interpretation given above, I find in the main to be that of De W., Meyer, and Koch.
