<b> 1.]</b> Timothy seems to be named as being well known to the Philippians (Acts xvi. 3, 10 ff.), and present with St. Paul at this time. The mention is merely formal, as the Apostle proceeds (ver. 8) in the first person singular. Certainly no<i> official</i> character is intended to be given by it, as some have thought: for of all the Epistles, this is the least official: and those to the Romans and Galatians, where no such mention occurs, the most so. Observe, there is no title of<i> Apostle</i> subjoined to<i> Paul</i> (as in Col. i. 1), probably because the Philippians needed no such reminiscence of his authority. Compare also 1 and 2 Thess.<br><br><b> all]</b> both here and in vv. 4, 7, 8, 25; ch. ii. 17, 26, is best accounted for from the warm affection which breathes through this whole Epistle (see on ver. 3), not from any formal reason, as that the Apostle wishes to put those Philippians who had not sent to his sup-port, on a level in his affection with those who had,—that he wishes to set himself above all their party divisions (ch. ii. 3): &c.<br><br><b> with the bishops]</b> Theodorct remarks, “He calls the presbyters, bishops: for at that time they had both names,”—and alleges Acts xx. 28, Tit. i. 5, 7, as shewing the same. See on the whole subject, note on Acts xx. 17.<b></b><br><br><b> and deacons]</b> See on Rom. xii. 7; xvi. 1.—Chrysostom enquires why he writes<i> here</i> to the<i> clergy</i> as well as to the<i> saints</i>, and not in the Epistles to the Romans, or Corinthians, or Ephesians. And he answers it, “because they had joined in sending to the Apostle, and had borne fruit for him, and themselves had sent Epaphroditus to him.” But the true reason seems to be, the late date of our Epistle. The ecclesiastical offices were now more plainly distinguished than at the time when the two former of those Epistles were written. That to the Ephesians rests on grounds of its own.—The simple juxtaposition of the officers with the members of the Church, and indeed<i> their</i> being placed<i> after</i> those members, shews, as it seems to me, the absence of hierarchical views such as those in the Epistles of the apostolic fathers.
