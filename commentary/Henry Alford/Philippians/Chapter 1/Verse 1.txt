<b> 1.]</b> Timothy seems to be named as being well known to the Philippians (Acts xvi. 3, 10 ff.), and present with St. Paul at this time. The mention is merely formal, as the Apostle proceeds (ver. 8) in the first person singular. Certainly no<i> official</i> character is intended to be given by it, as some have thought: for of all the Epistles, this is the least official: and those to the Romans and Galatians, where no such mention occurs, the most so. Observe, there is no title of<i> Apostle</i> subjoined to<i> Paul</i> (as in Col. i. 1), probably because the Philippians needed no such reminiscence of his authority. Compare also 1 and 2 Thess.
