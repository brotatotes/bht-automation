<p><strong> 15</strong> .] The two classes mentioned here are not subdivisions of the ἀδελφοὶ ἐν κυρίῳ above, who would more naturally be οἱ μέν and οἱ δέ , but the first ( <strong> καί</strong> ) are a new class, over and beyond those ἀδελφοί , and the second (in which clause the καί refers to the <em> first</em> ) are identical with the ἀδελφοί above. The first were the anti-pauline Christians, of whom we hear so often in the Epistles (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:0">Romans 14:0</span> .; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span> ff; 1Co 4:15 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span> ff.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span> ff; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:1">2 Corinthians 11:1</span> ff. &amp;c.).

<p><strong> καί</strong> , besides those mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:14">Philippians 1:14</span> . But this does not imply that the καί is to be referred to τινες , as Ellic. represents me; it introduces a new <em> motive</em> , διὰ κ . τ . λ ., and consequently, in my view, a new class of persons.
	</p>
<p><strong> διὰ</strong> , not strictly ‘ <em> for the sake of</em> ,’ so that they set envy (of me) and strife before them as their <em> object</em> but ‘ <em> in pursuance of</em> ,’ so <strong> on account of</strong> , to forward and carry out: see reff.
	</p>
<p><strong> καί</strong> (2nd) besides the hostile ones: introducing (see above) another motive again, differing from that last mentioned.
	</p>
<p><strong> δι</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> εὐδοκίαν</strong> <strong> on account of</strong> , in pursuance of, <strong> good will</strong> (towards me).</p>
