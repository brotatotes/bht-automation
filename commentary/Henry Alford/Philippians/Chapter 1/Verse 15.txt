 15 .] The two classes mentioned here are not subdivisions of the ἀδελφοὶ ἐν κυρίῳ above, who would more naturally be οἱ μέν and οἱ δέ , but the first (  καί ) are a new class, over and beyond those ἀδελφοί , and the second (in which clause the καί refers to the  first ) are identical with the ἀδελφοί above. The first were the anti-pauline Christians, of whom we hear so often in the Epistles (see Romans 14:0 .; 1 Corinthians 3:10 ff; 1Co 4:15 ; 1 Corinthians 9:1 ff.; 2 Corinthians 10:1 ff; 2 Corinthians 11:1 ff. &c.).
	 καί , besides those mentioned Philippians 1:14 . But this does not imply that the καί is to be referred to τινες , as Ellic. represents me; it introduces a new  motive , διὰ κ . τ . λ ., and consequently, in my view, a new class of persons.
	 διὰ , not strictly ‘  for the sake of ,’ so that they set envy (of me) and strife before them as their  object but ‘  in pursuance of ,’ so  on account of , to forward and carry out: see reff.
	 καί (2nd) besides the hostile ones: introducing (see above) another motive again, differing from that last mentioned.
	 δι  ʼ   εὐδοκίαν  on account of , in pursuance of,  good will (towards me).
