All my life, all my energy, all my time, is His—I<i> live Christ</i>)<b>, and to die</b> (literally,<b> to have died;</b> the<i> act of living</i> is to him Christ; but it is the<i> state after</i> death, not the<i> act of dying,</i> which is gain to him)<b> (is) gain.</b> This last word has surprised some Commentators, expecting a repetition of<i> Christ,</i> or something at all events higher than mere<i> gain.</i> But it is to be explained by the foregoing context. ‘Even if my death should be the result of my enemies’ machinations, it will be no<i> shame</i> to me, but gain, and my boldness is secured even for that event.’
