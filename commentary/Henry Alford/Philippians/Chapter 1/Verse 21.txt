<p><strong> 21</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (justification of the preceding expectation and hope, in either event) <strong> to me</strong> (emphatic) <strong> to live</strong> (continue in life, present), ( <strong> is</strong> ) <strong> Christ</strong> (see especially <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span> . All my life, all my energy, all my time, is His I <em> live Christ</em> . That this is the meaning, is clear, from the corresponding clause and the context. But many have taken <strong> χριστός</strong> for the subject, and <strong> τὸ ζῇν</strong> for the predicate, and others (as Chrys.) have understood τὸ ζῇν in the sense of higher spiritual life. Others again, as Calvin, Beza, &amp;c., have rendered, ‘mihi enim vivendo Christus est et moriendo lucrum,’ understanding before τὸ ζ . and τὸ ἀπ ., κατά or the like), <strong> and to die</strong> (‘ <em> to have died</em> ,’ aorist; the <em> act of living</em> is to him Christ; but it is the <em> state after</em> death, <em> not</em> the <em> act of dying</em> , which is gain to him (the explanation of the two infinitives given here does not at all affect their purely substantival character, which Ellic. defends as against me: τὸ ζῇν is life and τὸ ἀποθανεῖν is death: but we must not any the more for that lose sight of the tenses and their meaning. τὸ ἀποθνήσκειν would be equally substantival, but would mean a totally different thing)) ( <strong> is</strong> ) <strong> gain</strong> . This last word has surprised some Commentators, expecting a repetition of χριστός , or something at all events higher than mere κέρδος . But it is to be explained by the foregoing context. ‘Even if my death should be the result of my enemies’ machinations, it will be no αἰσχύνη to me, but gain, and my παῤῥησία is secured even for that event.’</p>
