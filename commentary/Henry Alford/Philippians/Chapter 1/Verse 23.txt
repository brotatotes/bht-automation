<p><strong> 23</strong> .] <strong> But</strong> (the contrast is to the decision involved in γνωρίζω ) <strong> I am perplexed</strong> (reff. and Act 18:5 note: held in, kept back from decision, which would be a setting at liberty) <strong> by</strong> ( <em> from the direction of</em> , kept in on both sides) <strong> the two</strong> (which have been mentioned, viz. τὸ ζῇν and τὸ ἀποθανεῖν not, which <em> follow</em> : this is evident by the insignificant position of ἐκ τῶν δύο behind the emphatic verb συνέχομαι , whereas, had the two been the <em> new</em> particulars about to be mentioned, <strong> τὸ ἀναλῦσαι</strong> and τὸ ἐπιμένειν it would have been in ἐκ δὲ τῶν δύο συνέχομαι ), <strong> having my desire towards</strong> ( <strong> εἰς</strong> belongs to ἔχων , not to ἐπιθυμίαν . The E. V., ‘ <em> having a desire to</em> ,’ would be ἐπιθυμίαν ἔχων τοῦ , and entirely misses the delicate sense) <strong> departing</strong> (from this world used on account of σὺν χρ . εἶναι following. The <em> intransitive</em> sense of <strong> ἀναλύω</strong> is not properly such, but as in the Latin <em> solvere</em> , elliptical, to <em> loose</em> (anchor or the like: see reff.) <em> for departure, for return</em> , &amp;c.) <strong> and being with Christ</strong> (“valet hic locus ad refellendum eorum deliramentum, qui animas a corporibus divisas dormire somniant: nam Paulus aperte testatur, nos frui Christi præsentia quum dissolvimur.” Calv.; and similarly Est. Thus much is true: but not perhaps that which some have inferred from our verse, that it shews a change of view respecting the nearness of the Lord’s advent for it is only said <em> in case of</em> his death: he immediately takes it up ( Php 1:25 ) by an assurance that he should continue with them: and cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+1:6">Philippians 1:6</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20-21">Philippians 3:20-21</span> , which shew that the advent was still regarded as imminent), <strong> for it is by far better</strong> (ref. Mark, and examples in Wetst, Plato, Hip. Maj. § 56, οἴει σοι κρεῖττον εἶναι ζῇν μᾶλλον ἢ τεθνάναι : Isocr. Helen. 213 c, οὕτως ἠγανάκτησεν ὥσθ ʼ ἡγήσατο κρεῖττον εἶναι τεθνάναι μᾶλλον : ib. Archidam. 134 c, πολὺ γὰρ κρεῖττον ἐν ταῖς δόξαις αἷς ἔχομεν τελευτῆσαι τὸν βίον μᾶλλον ἢ ζῇν ἐν ταῖς ἀτιμίαις : <strong> but to continue</strong> (the preposition gives the sense of <em> still</em> , cf. Rom 6:1 ) <strong> in my flesh</strong> (the article makes a slight distinction from ἐν σαρκί , abstract, Php 1:22 ) <strong> is more needful</strong> (this comparison contains in itself a mixed construction, between ἀναγκαῖον and αἱρετώτερον or the like) <strong> on account of you</strong> (and others but the expressions of his love are now directed solely to them. Meyer quotes from Seneca, Epist. 98: ‘vitæ suæ adjici nihil desiderat sua causa, sed eorum, quibus utilis est.’ Cf. also a remarkable passage from id. Epist. 104 in Wetst.).</p>
