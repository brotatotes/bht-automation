<b> 27—II. 18.]</b> EXHORTATIONS TO UNITED FIRMNESS, TO MUTUAL CONCORD, TO HUMILITY; AND IN GENERAL TO EARNESTNESS IN RELIGION.<br><br><b> 27.] Only,</b>—i. e.

The “<i>polity</i>” being the heavenly state, of which you are citizens; see especially ch. iii. 20.<br><br><b> in one spirit]</b> refers to the unity of spirit in which the various members of the church would be fused and blended in the case of<i> perfect unity.</i> This<i> one spirit</i> of Christians united for their common faith would of necessity be the Spirit of God which penetrates and inspires them: compare Eph. iv. 3, 4. Then, as this Spirit is the highest principle in us,—he includes also the lower portion, the animal soul;<br><br><b> with one soul striving together</b> (the<b> soul</b>, receiving on the one hand influence from the spirit, on the other impressions from the outer world, is the sphere of the affections and moral energies, and thus is that in and by which the exertion here spoken of would take place.<b> striving together,</b> either<i> with one another</i> or<i> with me.</i> The former is I think preferable, both on account of the<b> one spirit</b> and<b> one soul,</b> which naturally prepare the mind for an<i> united</i> effort, and because<i> his own</i> share<i></i> in the contest comes in as a new element in ver. 30)<b> for the faith</b> (compare Jude 3).
