 3 .] See the similar expressions, Romans 1:9 ; 1 Corinthians 1:4 ; Ephesians 1:16 ; Col 1:3 ; 1 Thessalonians 1:2 ; Philemon 1:4 .
	 ἐπί here with a dative is hardly distinguishable in English from the same preposition with a genitive in Romans 1:9 ; Ephesians 1:16 ;  at , or  in : the primitive idea of such construction being  addition by close adherence: ‘my whole remembrance of you is  accompanied with thanks to God.’  πάση τῇ μνείᾳ must not be rendered as in E. V. (so even Conyb.) ‘  every remembrance ,’ but  my whole remembrance . The expression  comprehends in one all such remembrances: but the article forbids the above rendering: cf. πᾶσα ἡ πόλις , Matthew 21:10 ; also ib. Matthew 6:29 ; Mark 4:1 ; Luke 3:3 ; Winer, § 18. 4. Some (Maldon., Bretschn., al.) take  ἐπί as assigning the reason for  εὐχαριστῶ (as 1Co 1:4 ), and  μνείᾳ ὑμῶν as meaning, ‘  your remembrance of me ,’ viz. in sending me sustenance. But this is evidently wrong: for the ground of εὐχαριστῶ follows, Philippians 1:5 .  μνεία here,  remembrance , not ‘  mention ,’ which meaning it only gets by ποιεῖσθαι being joined to it, ‘to make an  act of remembrance,’ i.e. to  mention , Romans 1:9 ; Eph 1:16 ; 1 Thessalonians 1:2 ; Philemon 1:4 .
