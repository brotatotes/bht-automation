<b> 6.] being</b> (i. e. seeing I am)<b> confident of this very thing</b> (it points out sharply and emphatically, implying, as here, that the very matter of confidence is one which will ensure the success of the<i> prayer</i>),<b> that He who began in you a good work</b> (viz. God: compare ch. ii. 13.—By ‘<i>a good work,</i>’ he refers his confidence to the<i> general</i> character of God as the doer and finisher of good: the one good work in his mind, being their<i> fellowship, &c.—</i><b>The words up to the day of Jesus Christ</b> assume the nearness of the coming of the Lord. Here, as elsewhere, Commentators (even Ellicott recently) have endeavoured to escape from this inference. Thus Theophylact and Œcumenius refer the saying not only to the then existing generation of Philippians, but<i> also to their descendants:</i> Estius, in the case of each man,<i> “up to his own death:”</i> Calovius, understanding not the continuance till the day of Christ, but “term and complement of perfection which we shall possess at that, day:” and so nearly Calvin, but saying very beautifully,— “Although they who are freed from the mortal body, no longer war with the lusts of the flesh, and are as they say beyond range of the enemy: yet there will be nothing out of place in speaking of them as still in progress, because they have not yet attained to the point at which they aspired: they are not yet in possession of the felicity and glory for which they hoped: in a word, the day has not yet dawned which is to reveal the treasures hidden in hope. And on this account, whenever hope is spoken of, the eyes must be fixed on the blessed resurrection as their point of reference.” Doubtless, this is<i> our</i> lesson, and must be our application of such passages: but this surely was not the sense in which the Apostle wrote them).
