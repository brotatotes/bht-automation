<p><strong> 6. </strong> <strong> ὁ ἐναρξ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> He who has begun in you a good work</strong> , viz. God: cf. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span> . Wakefield, perversely enough, renders, ‘ <em> he among you who has begun</em> , &amp;c.’
	</p>
<p>By ‘ <em> a good work</em> ,’ he refers his confidence to the <em> general</em> character of God as the doer and finisher of good: the one good work in his mind being, their κοινωνία &amp;c. <strong> ἐν</strong> is in, not ‘ <em> among</em> :’ but the preposition in <strong> ἐναρξάμενος</strong> seems not to be connected with it, cf. reff., where the verb has an absolute meaning, irrespective of any <em> immanent</em> working.
	</p>
<p>The <strong> ἄχρι ἡμέρας χρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἰησοῦ</strong> assumes the nearness of the coming of the Lord ( μέχρι τῆς τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν ἐπιφανείας , Thdrt.). Here, as elsewhere, Commentators (even Ellic. recently) have endeavoured to escape from this inference. Thus Thl., Œc., refer the saying not only to the then existing generation of Philippians, but καὶ τοῖς ἐξ ὑμῶν : Estius, in the case of each man, ‘ <em> usque ad mortem suam</em> ;’ Calov., understanding not the continuance till the day of Christ, but ‘ <em> terminus et complementum perfectionis, quod habituri isto die erimus</em> :’ and so nearly Calvin, but saying very beautifully, ‘Tametsi enim qui ex corpore mortali sunt liberati, non amplius militent cum carnis concupiscentiis, sintque extra teli jactum ut aiunt: tamen nihil erit absurdi, si dicentur esse in profectu, quia nondum pertigerunt quo aspirant: nondum potiuntur felicitate et gloria quam sperarunt: denique nondum illuxit dies, qui revelet absconditos in spe thesauros. Atque adeo quum de spe agitur, semper ad beatam resurrectionem, tanquam ad scopum, referendi sunt oculi.’ Doubtless, this is <em> our</em> lesson, and must be our application of such passages: but this surely was not the sense in which the Apostle wrote them.</p>
