 8 .] Confirmation of Philippians 1:7 . οὐλ ὡς ἀπιστούμενος μάρτυρα καλεῖ τὸν θεόν , ἀλλὰ τὴν πολλὴν διάθεσιν οὐκ ἔχων παραστῆσαι διὰ λόγου , Thl. after Chrys. On  ἐπιποθῶ , see reff. The preposition indicates the direction of the desire, not its intensification. On  ἐν σπλάγχνοις χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ , Bengel remarks, “in Paulo non Paulus vivit, sed Jesus Christus: quare Paulus non in Pauli sed in Jesu Christi movetur visceribus.” All real spiritual love is but a portion of the great love wherewith He hath loved us, which lives and yearns in all who are vitally united to Him.
