The first particular mentioned is here,<b> exhortation</b>, not<i> “consolation,”</i> which follows in the word<b> comfort</b>.<br><br><b> in Christ</b> specifies the<i> element</i> of the exhortation. The Greek word,<i> paraklésis,</i> signifies both<i> exhortation</i> and<i> consolation</i>: see Acts iv. 36.<br><br><b> of love</b> is the subjective genitive,— ‘consolation furnished by love.’<br><br><b> communion,—fellowship,</b> of the<i> Holy Spirit;</i> compare 2 Cor. xiii. 13;<b> tenderness</b> (literally,<b> bowels</b>), of<i> affectionate emotion</i> in general:<b> compassions</b>, of the<i> compassionate</i> emotions in particular.—I may remark, that the exhortation being addressed to the Philippians, the<b> if there be any</b> is to be taken subjectively—<b>If there be with you any</b>&c.
