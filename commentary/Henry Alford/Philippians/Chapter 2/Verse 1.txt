<p><strong> 1</strong> .] He introduces in the fervour of his affection ( ὅρα πῶς λιπαρῶς , πῶς σφοδρῶς , πῶς μετὰ συμπαθείας πολλῆς , Chr.) four great points of the Christian life and ministry, and by them enforces his exhortation. Mey. observes, that the four fall into <em> two pairs</em> , in each of which we have first the objective principle of Christian life ( ἐν χριστῷ and πνεύματος ), and next the subjective principle ( ἀγάπης and σπλάγχ . κ . οἰκτιρμοί ). And thus the awakening of motives by these four points is at the same time (so Chrys. above) powerful and touching.
	</p>
<p><strong> παράκλησις</strong> ] here, <strong> exhortation</strong> , not ‘ <em> comfort</em> ,’ which follows in <strong> παραμύθιον</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν χριστῷ</strong> specifies the <em> element</em> of the exhortation.
	</p>
<p><strong> παραμύθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] better <strong> comfort</strong> , than ‘ <em> persuasion</em> :’ it corresponds (see above) to σπλ . κ . οἰκτιρ . in the other pair: see also reff. παραμυθία , the earlier form, occurs in the same sense <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:3">1 Corinthians 14:3</span> ; Wis 19:12 .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀγάπης</strong> is the subjective genitive, ‘consolation furnished by love.’
	</p>
<p><strong> κοιν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> communion, fellowship</strong> , of the <em> Holy Spirit</em> , cf. ref. 2 Cor.: not, ‘ <em> spiritual communion</em> ’ (De W., al.). The manuscript evidence in favour of the reading <strong> εἴ τις</strong> is overwhelming; and in Tischendorf’s language, “nobis servandum erit τις , nisi malumus grammatici quam editoris partes agere.” It is in its favour, that almost all the great MSS. have εἴ τι before παραμύθιον . For if εἴ τις had been a mere mechanical repetition of the preceding, why not in one place as well as in the other? And if this were once so, and the former τις got altered back to its proper form, why not this also? The construction may be justified perhaps as analogous to ὄχλου … ἐχόντων , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:1">Mark 8:1</span> ; see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:17">Luke 2:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:49">Luke 7:49</span> ; though, it must be confessed, it is the harshest example of its kind.

<p><strong> σπλάγχνα</strong> , of <em> affectionate emotion</em> in general: <strong> οἰκτιρμοί</strong> , of the <em> compassionate</em> emotions in particular. So Tittm. p. 68 a: <strong> tenderness and compassion</strong> , Conyb. ‘ <em> herzliche Liebe und Barmherzigkeit</em> ,’ Luth.
	</p>
<p>I may remark, that the exhortation being addressed to the Philippians, the εἴ τις and εἴ τι are to be taken subjectively <strong> If there be</strong> with you <strong> any</strong> &amp;c.</p>
