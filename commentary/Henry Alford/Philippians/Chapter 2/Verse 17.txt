<b> 17. Yea, if even]</b> In the present case (see on the construction in my Greek Test.), the Apostle seems to believe the supposition which he makes: that it veritably will be so.<br><br><b> if I am even being poured out,</b> because the danger was besetting him<i> now,</i> and waxing onward to its accomplishment. He uses the word literally, with reference to the shedding of his blood. “He represents his whole apostolic work for the faith of the Philippians, as a<i> sacrifice:</i> if he is put to death in the course of it, he will be, by the shedding of his blood, poured out as a libation upon this sacrifice, as among the Jews (Num. xxviii. 7; xv. 4 ff.) and heathens, in their sacrifices, libations of wine were usual, which were poured over the offerings.” Meyer.<br><br><b> ministration</b> here means,<b> priest’s ministration</b> at the sacrifice.<br><br><b> of your faith]</b> your faith<i> is the sacrifice,</i> which I, as a priest, offer to God. The image is precisely as in Rom. xv. 16, where he is the priest, offering up the Gentiles to God. And the case which he puts is, that he, the priest, should have his own blood poured out at, upon his sacrificing and presentation to God of their faith.<b></b><br><br><b> I joy]</b> not to be joined with<i> “with you,”</i> but absolute,<b> I rejoice for myself and congratulate you</b> (not,<i> ‘rejoice with you,’</i> as A.V. and many Commentators. Meyer well observes that the following verse is decisive against this: for if<i> they rejoiced</i> already, what need of “<i>do ye also joy?</i>”—congratulate you, viz. on the fact that I have been thus poured out for your faith, which would be an honour and a boast for you.)
