 19 .  ἐν κυρίῳ ] ‘my hope is not an idle one, as a worldly man’s might be; but one founded on faith in Christ.’ 1 Corinthians 15:19 , to which Meyer refers, is wholly different: see there.
	 ταχέως , see Philippians 2:23 .
	 ὑμῖν ] The dative after verbs of sending, &c. need not be regarded (as De W., al., here) as the dativus commodi, but is similar to that case after verbs of giving indicating the position of the  recipient . I stated in some former editions, that it is in no case equivalent to the mere  local πρὸς ὑμᾶς . But Ellic. has reminded me, that this is too widely stated, later writers undeniably using it in this sense. See note on Acts 21:16 , and cf. such examples as πότερον ἠγόμην Ἀβροκόμῃ , Xen. Ephesians 3:6 , and ἤγαγεν αὐτὸν Ἀθανασίῳ τῷ πάππᾳ , Epiph. vit. p. 340 d. See the discussion in Winer, § 31. 5.
	 κἀγώ ] ‘as well as you, by your reception of news concerning me.’
	 εὐψ  . ]  may be of good courage . The  verb is unknown to the classics: the imperative εὐψύχει is found in inscriptions on tombs, in the sense of the Latin ‘  have pia anima .’
