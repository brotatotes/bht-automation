<b> 22.</b>]<b> But the approved worth of him ye know</b> (viz. by trial, when we were at Philippi together, Acts xvi. 1, 3,—xvii. 14),—<b>viz.: that as a son (serveth) a father, he served with me for the Gospel</b>. The construction is this: the Apostle would have written, ‘as a son a father, so he served me,’—but changes it to ‘so he served<i> with</i> me,’ from modesty and reverence, seeing that we are not servants one of another, but all of God, in the matter of the Gospel.
