 23 .]  But the approved worth (reff.)  of him ye know (viz. by trial, when we were at Philippi together, Acts 16:1 ; Acts 16:3 , Act 17:14 ),  viz .:  that as a son (serves) a father, he served with me for (reff.)  the Gospel . The construction is this: the Apostle would have written, ‘as a son a father, so he  served me,’ but changes it to ‘so he served  with me,’ from modesty and reverence, seeing that we are not servants one of another, but all of God, in the matter of the Gospel. We must not supply σύν before πατρί : when, in case of several nouns governed by the same preposition, that preposition is omitted before any, it is not before the  first , cf. Plato, Rep. iii. p. 414, δεῖ ὡς περὶ μητρὸς κ . τροφοῦ τῆς χώρας ἐν ᾗ εἰσι βουλεύεσθαι : and see Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 205. The examples cited by Ellicott to disprove this, do not seem to me to apply: viz. Æsch. Suppl. 313 (311), Eur. Hel. 872 (863): both are instances of local terms coupled by καί , and both occur in poetry, where the exigencies of metre come into play. Winer takes the construction as above, edn. 6, § 63, ii. 1 [see Moulton’s Translation, p. 722].
	 μέν answers to  δέ , Philippians 2:24 ;  οὖν reassumes Philippians 2:19 .
	 ὡς ἂν ἀφίδω ]  as soon as I shall have ascertained . On the force of the preposition, see Hebrews 12:2 , note.
	 ὡς ἄν , of time, implying uncertainty as to the event indicated: see reff. and Cebes, tab. p. 168, προστάττει δὲ τοῖς εἰσπορευομένοις , τί δεῖ αὐτοὺς ποιεῖν , ὡς ἂν εἰσέλθωσιν εἰς τὸν βίον . See also Klotz, Devar. pp. 759. 63. The form  ἀφ ίδω is supposed by Meyer to be owing to the pronunciation of ἴδω with the digamma. The word signifies here,  see clearly , as in Herod. viii. 37, ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀγχοῦ τε ἔσαν οἱ βάρβαροι ἐπιόντες καὶ ἀπώρεον τὸ ἱρὸν …: following the analogy of ἀπέχω and similar words: the preposition being not intensive (as Ellic. wrongly reports my view), but exhaustive.
	 τὰ περὶ ἐμέ  , my matters .
