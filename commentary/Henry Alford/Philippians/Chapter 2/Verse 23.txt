The construction is this: the Apostle would have written, ‘as a son a father, so he <em> served</em> me,’ but changes it to ‘so he served <em> with</em> me,’ from modesty and reverence, seeing that we are not servants one of another, but all of God, in the matter of the Gospel. We must not supply σύν before πατρί : when, in case of several nouns governed by the same preposition, that preposition is omitted before any, it is not before the <em> first</em> , cf. Plato, Rep. iii. p. 414, δεῖ ὡς περὶ μητρὸς κ . τροφοῦ τῆς χώρας ἐν ᾗ εἰσι βουλεύεσθαι : and see Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 205. The examples cited by Ellicott to disprove this, do not seem to me to apply: viz. Æsch. Suppl. 313 (311), Eur. Hel. 872 (863): both are instances of local terms coupled by καί , and both occur in poetry, where the exigencies of metre come into play. Winer takes the construction as above, edn. 6, § 63, ii. 1 [see Moulton’s Translation, p. 722].

See also Klotz, Devar. pp. 759. 63. The form <strong> ἀφ</strong> ίδω is supposed by Meyer to be owing to the pronunciation of ἴδω with the digamma. The word signifies here, <strong> see clearly</strong> , as in Herod. viii. 37, ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀγχοῦ τε ἔσαν οἱ βάρβαροι ἐπιόντες καὶ ἀπώρεον τὸ ἱρὸν …: following the analogy of ἀπέχω and similar words: the preposition being not intensive (as Ellic. wrongly reports my view), but exhaustive.
