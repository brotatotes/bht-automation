<b> 6.] who, subsisting</b> (originally. Less cannot be implied in this word than eternal præ-existence. The participle is hardly equivalent to “although he subsisted,” still less “inasmuch as he subsisted;” but simply states its fact as a link in the logical chain, “subsisting as He did;” without fixing the character of that link as causal or concessive)<b> in the form of God</b> (not merely the<i> nature</i> of God, which however is<i> implied:</i> but, as in Heb. i. 3, the<i> “brightness of God’s glory and the express image of His person:”</i> compare John v. 37 with xvii. 5. “The divine nature had an infinite beauty in itself, even without any creature to look on it.” Bengel. See also Col. i. 15; 2Cor. iv. 4.

The<i> meaning</i> is plain enough. Our Lord possessed equality with God. In “the mind which was in Him, He regarded not this His equality a thing to be grasped at by Him, so as to hold it firm for Himself, but”&c. We have now to enquire, whether the opening of the passage will bear to be understood of our Lord<i> already incarnate.</i> De Wette and others have maintained that the name<b> Christ Jesus</b> cannot apply to<i> Him before His Incarnation.</i> But the answer to this is easy, viz. that that name applies to the<i> entire historical Person</i> of our Lord, of whom the whole passage is said, and not merely to Him in his pre-existent state. That one and the same person of the Son of God,<i> “existing in the form of God,”</i> afterwards<i> “became in the likeness of men,”</i> gathering to itself the humanity, in virtue of which Heis now designated in the concrete, Christ Jesus. The dispute seems to me to be satisfactorily settled by the contrast between the two clauses just quoted. These two cannot belong to Christ in the same incarnate state. Therefore the former of them must refer to his<i> præ-incarnate state</i>),
