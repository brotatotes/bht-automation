 1 .] He appears to have been closing his Epistle ( τὸ λοιπόν , and reff.), but to have again gone off, on the vehement mention of the Judaizers, into an explanation of his strong term  κατατομή . Chrys., al., find a connexion with the foregoing, but it is farfetched ( ἔχετε Ἐπαφρ ., δι ʼ ὃν ἤλγειτε , ἔχετε Τιμόθ ., ἔρχομαι κἀγώ . τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἐπιδίδωσι · τί ὑμῖν λείπει λοιπόν ;): the sense is evidently closed with ch. 3:30.
	 τὰ αὐτά ] It seems to me that Wiesinger has rightly apprehended the reference of this somewhat difficult sentence. The  χαίρετε ἐν κυρίῳ , taken up again by the  οὕτως στήκετε ἐν κυρίῳ , ch. Philippians 4:1 , is evidently put here emphatically, with direct reference to the warning which follows  let your joy (your boast) be in the Lord . And this same exhortation,  χαίρειν , is in fact the groundtone of the whole Epistle. See ch. Philippians 1:18 ; Philippians 1:25 ; Philippians 2:17 ; Philippians 4:4 , where the  πάλιν ἐρῶ seems to refer back again to this saying. So that there is no difficulty in imagining that the Apostle may mean χαίρετε by the  τὰ αὐτά . The word  ἀσφαλές is no objection to this: because the χαίρ . ἐν κυρ . is in fact an introduction to the warning which follows: a provision, by upholding the antagonist duty, against their falling into deceit. And thus all the speculation, whether  τὰ αὐτά refer to a lost Epistle, or to words uttered ( γράφειν ?) when he was with them, falls to the ground. And the inference from Polycarp’s words in his Epistle to these Philippians, § 3, p. 1008, ὃς καὶ ἀπὼν ὑμῖν ἔγραψεν ἐπιστολάς , may be a true one, but does not belong here.
