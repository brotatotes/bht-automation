<b> CH. III. 1—IV. 1.</b>] WARNING AGAINST CERTAIN JUDAIZERS,—ENFORCED BY HIS OWN EXAMPLE (1–16): ALSO AGAINST IMMORAL PERSONS (17—iv. 1).<br><br><b> 1.</b>] He appears to have been closing his Epistle (<b>finally</b>, &c.), but to have again gone off, on the vehement mention of the Judaizers, into an explanation of his strong term rendered<b> concision. the same things</b>] It seems to me that Wiesinger has rightly apprehended the reference of this somewhat difficult sentence. The<b> rejoice in the Lord</b>, taken up again by the<b> thus stand fast in the Lord</b>, ch. iv. 1, is evidently put here emphatically, with direct reference to the warning which follows—<b>let your joy</b> (<b>your boast</b>)<b> be in the Lord</b>. And this same exhortation,<b> rejoice</b>, is in fact the ground-tone of the whole Epistle. See ch. i. 18, 25; ii. 17; iv. 4, where the addition “<i>and again I say</i>” seems to refer back again to this saying. So that there is no difficulty in imagining that the Apostle may mean by “<i>the same things</i>,” his exhortation to rejoice. The description of this course as being<b> safe</b> is no objection to this: because the<i> rejoicing in the Lord</i> is in fact an introduction to the warning which follows: a provision, by upholding the antagonist duty, against their falling into deceit. And thus all the speculation, whether<b> the same things</b> refer to a lost Epistle, or to words uttered when he was with them, falls to the ground. And the inference from Polycarp’s words in his Epistles to these Philippians, “<i>who</i> (viz. St. Paul)<i> when absent wrote to you Epistles</i>,” may be a true one, but does not belong here.
