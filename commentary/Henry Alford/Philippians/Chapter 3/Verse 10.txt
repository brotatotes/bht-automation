De W., al., treat <strong> τοῦ γν</strong> <strong> .</strong> as parallel with ἵνα κερδήσω , κ . τ . λ . But as Mey. remarks, it is no real parallel, for there is more in ἵνα χρ . κερδήσω &amp;c. than in τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτόν &amp;c. Besides, thus the process of thought is disturbed, in which, from ἵνα to <strong> ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει</strong> answers to <strong> διὰ τὸν χριστόν</strong> above, and from <strong> τοῦ γν</strong> <strong> .</strong> to <strong> νεκρῶν</strong> answers to <strong> διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> γνώσεως αὐτοῦ</strong> . See a similar construction, Rom 6:6 ), <strong> in order to know Him</strong> (know, in that fulness of experimental knowledge, which is only wrought by being like Him), <strong> and</strong> (not = ‘ <em> that is to say</em> :’ but additional: His Person, and … and …) <strong> the power of His resurrection</strong> (i.e. not ‘ <em> the power by which He was raised</em> ,’ but the power which His resurrection <em> exercises</em> on believers in assuring them of their justification, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:17">1 Corinthians 15:17</span> ; mostly however here, from the context which goes on to speak of conformity with His sufferings and death, in <em> raising them with Him</em> , cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span> ; Col 2:12 ), <strong> and the participation of His sufferings</strong> (which is the necessitating condition of being brought under the power of His resurrection, see as above, and 2Ti 2:11 ), <strong> being conformed</strong> (the nominative is an anacoluthon, belonging to <strong> τοῦ γνῶναι</strong> , and referring, as often, to the <em> logical</em> subject) <strong> to His Death</strong> (it does not appear to me that St. Paul is here speaking, as Mey., al., of his imminent risk of a death of martyrdom, but that his meaning is general, applying to his whole course of suffering and self-denial, as indeed throughout the sentence. This conformity with Christ’s death was to take place by means of that perfect self-abjuration which he here asserts of himself see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span> ; 2Co 2:14 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span> ff.; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:31">1 Corinthians 15:31</span> , and especially Gal 2:20 ), <strong> if by any means</strong> (so Thucyd. ii. 77, πᾶσαν γὰρ ἰδέαν ἐπενόουν , εἴ πως σφίσιν ἄνευ δαπάνης κ . πολιορκίας προσαχθείη : Herod. vi. 52, βουλομένην , εἴ κως ἀμφότεροι γενοίατο βασιλῆες .

On the sense, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:7">Acts 26:7</span> ; from which alone, it is evident that it does not signify ‘ <em> live until</em> ,’ as Van Hengel) <strong> unto the resurrection from the dead</strong> (viz. the blessed resurrection of the dead in Christ, in which οἱ τοῦ χριστοῦ shall rise ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ αὐτοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23">1 Corinthians 15:23</span> , see also <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span> .
