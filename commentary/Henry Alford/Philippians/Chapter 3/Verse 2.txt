 2 .]  βλέπετε , not, ‘  beware of ,’ as E. V. ( βλ . ἀπό , Mar 8:15 reff.), but as in reff.,  observe , with a view to avoid: cf. σκοπεῖν , Romans 16:17 .
	 τοὺς κύνας ] profane, impure persons. The appellation occurs in various references; but in the Jewish usage of it, uncleanness was the prominent idea: see, besides reff., Deuteronomy 23:18 ; Isaiah 56:10-11 ; Matthew 15:26-27 .
