The words assume, as St. Paul always does when speaking incidentally, the persons in whose name he is speaking, and among whom he includes himself, surviving to witness the coming of the Lord. The change from the dust of death in the resurrection, however we may<i> accommodate</i> the expression to it, was not originally contemplated by it; witness the<b> looking for</b> Christ, and<i> the body of our humiliation</i>)<b> the body of our humiliation</b> (beware of the rendering “<i>our vile body</i>,” by which most Commentators, and the A.V., here enervate the Apostle’s fine and deep meaning. The<i> body</i> is that object, that material, in which our<i> humiliation</i> has place and is shown, by its suffering and being degraded.—Christ once had such a<i> humiliation</i>, and has passed through it to His glory—and He shall change us so as to be like him.—Whereas the rendering ‘<i>our vile body</i>’ sinks all this, and makes the epithet merely refer to that which is common to all humanity by nature), (<b>so as to be</b>)<b> conformed to the body of His glory</b> (in which, as its object or material, His glory has place and is displayed: again beware of the inadequate rendering “<i>his glorious</i><i> body</i>,” A.V., see above),<b> according to</b> (after the analogy of)<b> the working of His power, even</b> (besides the<i> change</i>, &c. spoken of)<b> to subject to Him all things</b> (<i>the uni-verse</i>: see the exception, 1 Cor. xv. 25–27).
