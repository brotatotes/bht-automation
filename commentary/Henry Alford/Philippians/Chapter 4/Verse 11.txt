See ch. iii, 12:<b> my meaning is not, that.... in respect of</b>, i.e.<b> according to</b>, i.e.<b> in consequence of: for I</b> (emphatic:<b> for my part,</b> whatever others may feel)<b> learned</b> (in my experience, my training for this apostolic work: not ‘h<i> ave learned</i>;’ the simple past is much simpler and more humble— ‘I was taught: the<i> present</i> result of this teaching comes below, but not in this word),<b> in the state in which I am</b> (not ‘<i>in whatsoever state I am</i>,’ A.V. But the expression does not apply only to the Apostle’s<i> present circumstances</i>, but to any<i> possible</i> present ones: ‘<i>in which I am at any time</i>:’ see next verse)<b> to find competence</b> (we have no word for the original here. ‘<i>Self-sufficing</i>’ will express its meaning of independence of external help, but is liable to be misunderstood:<i> ‘competent’</i> is not in use in this sense, though the abstract noun<b> competence</b> is: the German genülam gives it well).
