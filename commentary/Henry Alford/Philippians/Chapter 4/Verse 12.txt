 12 .] See above.  I know (by this teaching)  also (the first καί expresses that, besides the general finding of competence in all circumstances, he specially has been taught to suffer humiliation and to bear abundance. See Ellic.’s note)  how to be brought low (generally: but here especially by  need , in humiliation of circumstances.
	Meyer remarks that 2 Corinthians 4:8 ; 2 Corinthians 6:9-10 , are a commentary on this),  I know also ( καί as before, or as an addition to  οἶδα καὶ ταπεινοῦσθαι )  how to abound ( ὑψοῦσθαι , as Wies. remarks, would be the  proper general opposite: but he chooses the special one, which fits the matter of which he is treating):  in every thing (not as vulg., E. V., all., ‘  every where ,’ nor ‘  at every time ,’ as Chrys., Grot., nor both, as Thl., &c.: but as usually in St. Paul: see ref. and note)  and in all things (not, as Luth., Beng., ‘  respectu omnium hominum :’ ἐν παντὶ πράγματί , φησι , κ . ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς παρεμπίπτουσι , Œc.: the expression conveys  universality , as ‘  in each and all ,’ with us)  I have been taught the lesson (‘  initiated :’ but no stress to be laid, as by Beng., ‘disciplina arcana imbutus sum, ignota mundo:’ see the last example below. Beware (against Wiesinger) of joining  μεμύημαι with  ἐν παντὶ κ  .   ἐν πᾶσιν ,  initiated in, &c. ; the verb is (against Ellicott) not constructed with ἐν , but with an accusative of the person and the thing ( μυεῖν τινά τι ), which last accusative remains with the passive: so μ ʼ ἀνὴρ ἐμύησ ʼ Ἑλικωνίδα , Anthol. ix. 162, οἱ τὰς τελετὰς μεμυημένοι , Plato, Symp. p. 209. The present construction, with an infinitive, occurs, Alciphr. ii. 4, κυβερνᾷν μυηθήσομαι )  both to be satiated and to hunger (the forms πεινᾷν , διψᾷν , for - ῇν , seem to have come in with Macedonian influence: being found first in Aristotle; see Lobeck in Phryn. p. 61),  both to abound and to be in need .
