<b> 2.</b>]<b> Euodia</b> (not Euodias, as A.V., which is a blunder)<b> and Syntyche</b> (both<i> women</i>) appear to have needed this exhortation on account of some disagreement; both however being faithful, and fellow-workers [perhaps deaconesses, Rom. xvi. 1] with himself in the Gospel.

Various opinions have been, (1) that St. Paul addresses<i> his own wife</i>. So Clement of Alexandria, saying, “And Paul indeed does not hesitate in a certain Epistle to address his wife as his yoke-fellow, whom he did not lead about with him for the sake of the greater despatch of the ministerial work.” But this is evidently an error, and Theodoret says rightly, “This yoke-fellow some have stupidly imagined to be the Apostle’s wife, forgetting what he wrote to the Corinthians, numbering himself among the unmarried” (1 Cor. vii. 8). (2) that he was the husband, or brother, of Euodia or Syntyche: so Chrysostom doubtfully, and others. But then the epithet, “yoke-fellow,” would hardly be wanted—nor would the expression be at all natural. (3) that he was some fellow-labourer of the Apostle. So Theodoret,— “He calls him yoke-fellow, as bearing the same yoke of the Christian faith:” and others,—and of these some have under-stood<i> Epaphroditus</i>, others<i> Timothy</i>,—Bengel (but afterwards he preferred<i> Epaphroditus</i>),<i> Silas</i>,—Luther, the<i> chief bishop</i> at Philippi. (4) Others have regarded<i> Synzygus,</i> the Greek word rendered “yoke-fellow,” as a proper name. In this case the adjective<b> true</b> would mean, ‘who art veritably, as thy name is,’ a yoke-fellow. And this might be said by the Apostle, who elsewhere compares the Christian minister to the<i> ox treading out the corn</i>. It seems to me that we must choose between the two last hypotheses. The objections to each are about of equal weight: the Apostle nowhere else calls his fellow-labourers<i> yoke-fellows</i>,—and the proper name<i> Synzigus</i> is nowhere else found. But these are no reasons, respectively, against either hypothesis. We may safely say with Chrysostom, that “whether it be one or the other, it is not a matter to be particular about.”<b> help them</b>] Euodia and Syntyche: but not, as Grotius thinks, in<i> getting their livelihood</i>: it is<i> the work of their reconciliation</i> which he clearly has in view, and in which they would need help.<b> inasmuch as</b>, or<b> seeing that they</b>.....

It is perhaps arbitrary, seeing that the name is so common, to assume his identity with Clement afterwards bishop of Rome, and author of the Epistles to the Corinthians. This is done by Eusebius, Origen, and Jerome: but Chrysostom does not notice any such idea,<b> whose names are in the</b>
