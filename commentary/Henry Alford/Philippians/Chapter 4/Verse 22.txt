<b> 22</b>.<b> All the saints</b>] i.e., all the Christians here.<b> they that are of Cæsar’s household</b>] These perhaps were slaves belonging to the (technically so called)<i> familia</i> (i. e. all attached to the palace, including slaves and every dependant) of Nero, who had been con-verted by intercourse with St. Paul, probably at this time a prisoner in the pretorian barracks (see ch. i. 13, note) attached to the palace. This is much more likely, than that any of the actual<i> family</i> of Nero should have embraced Christianity. The reason of these being specified is not plain: the connexion perhaps between a<i> colony</i>, and some of the imperial household, might account for it.
