<b> 5.</b><b> your moderation</b>] or, your forbearance,<i> reasonableness of dealing</i>, wherein not strictness of legal right, but consideration for one another, is the rule of practice. Aristotle defines it to be that which fills up the necessary deficiencies of<i> law</i>, which is<i> general</i>, by dealing with particular cases as the law-giver would have dealt with them if he had been by. By the prescribing that it is to be known to all men, the Apostle rather intends, ‘let no man know of you any inconsistency with<i> this reasonableness</i>.’ The universality of it justifies its application even to those described above, ch. iii. 18 f.,—that though warned against them, they were to shew all moderation and clemency towards them. Meyer observes well, that the succession of these precepts seems to explain itself psychologically by the disposition of spiritual joy in the Lord exalting us both above rigorism, and above anxiety of mind (ver. 6).<b> The Lord is at hand</b>] These words may apply either to the foregoing— ‘<b>the Lord will soon come,</b> He is the avenger; it is yours to be moderate and clement:’ or to the following— ‘<b>the Lord is near</b>, be not anxious.’ Per-haps we may best regard it as the tran-sition from the one to the other: Christ’s coming is at hand—this is the best enforcer of clemency and forbearance: it also leads on to the duty of banishing anxiety.<b> The Lord</b> means<i> Christ</i>, and<b> at hand</b> refers to the day of His coming; see on eh. iii. 20.
