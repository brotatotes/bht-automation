 5 .]  τὸ ἐπιεικές ,  your forbearance , from ἐπί , implying direction, and εἰκός , ἔοικα (not εἴκω , to yield, as Trench, N. T. Syn. 171: see Palm and Rost’s Lex., under the word, as also under  ΕἼΚΩ and ἔοικα ),  reasonableness of dealing , wherein not strictness of legal right, but consideration for one another, is the rule of practice. Aristot., Eth. Nic. 4:10. 6, defines it to be that which fills up the necessary deficiencies of  law , which is  general , by dealing with particular cases as the law-giver would have dealt with them if he had been by. διό , he adds, δίκαιον μέν ἐστι , καὶ βέλτιόν τινος δικαίου · … καὶ ἔστιν αὕτη ἡ φύσις ἡ τοῦ ἐπιεικοῦς , ἐπανόρθωμα νόμου , ᾗ ἐλλείπει διὰ τὸ καθόλου . And he describes the ἐπιεικής as ὁ μὴ ἀκριβοδίκαιος ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖρον . See Trench, New Test. Syn., as above.
	By the  γνωσθήτω πᾶσιν ἀνθρ  . , the Apostle rather intends, ‘let no man know of you any inconsistency with ἐπιείκεια .’ The universality of it justifies its application even to those described above, ch. Philippians 3:18 f., that though warned against them, they were to shew all moderation and clemency towards them: so Chrys. Meyer observes well, that the succession of these precepts seems to explain itself psychologically by the disposition of spiritual joy in the Lord exalting us both above rigorism, and above anxiety of mind ( Php 4:6 ).
	 ὁ κύριος ἐγγύς ] These words may apply either to the foregoing ‘  the Lord will soon come , He is the avenger; it is yours to be moderate and clement’ (so De Wette, al.): or to the following ‘  the Lord is near , be not anxious:’ so Chrys., Thdrt., all. Perhaps we may best regard it as the transition from the one to the other: Christ’s coming is at hand this is the best enforcer of clemency and forbearance: it also leads on to the duty of banishing anxiety.
	 ὁ κύριος is  Christ , and the  ἐγγύς refers to the παρουσία ; see on ch. Philippians 3:20 .
