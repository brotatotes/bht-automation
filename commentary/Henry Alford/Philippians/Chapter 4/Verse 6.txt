<p><strong> 6</strong> .] <strong> μηδέν</strong> has the emphasis. It is the accusative of the object, as τὸ πολλὰ μεριμνᾷν , Xen. Cyr. viii. 7. 12.

<p><strong> ἐν παντί</strong> ] <strong> in every thing</strong> : see ref. 1 Thess. and note. Meyer remarks that the literally correct rendering of the Vulg. ‘ <em> in omni</em> (neut.) <em> oratione</em> ’ led Ambrose wrong, who gives it ‘ <em> per omnem orationem</em> .’

<p><strong> τῇ προσευχῇ καὶ τῇ δεήσει</strong> ] <strong> by your prayer and your supplication</strong> : or better, <strong> by the prayer and the supplication</strong> appropriate to each thing. On the difference between προσευχή and δέησις , see on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:18">Ephesians 6:18</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:1">1 Timothy 2:1</span> .

<p>Not μετὰ <strong> τῆς</strong> εὐχαριστίας , because the matters themselves may not be recognized as grounds of εὐχαριστία , but <em> it</em> should <em> accompany</em> every request. Ellic., who doubts this explanation, thinks it “more simple to say that εὐχαριστία , ‘thanksgiving for past blessings,’ is in its nature more general and comprehensive, προς . and δεησ . almost necessarily more limited and specific. Hence, though εὐχαρ . occurs 12 times in St. Paul’s Epistles, it is only twice used with the article, 1Co 14:26 , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:15">2 Corinthians 4:15</span> .” But I much prefer the other view.

<p><strong> τὰ αἰτήματα</strong> ] = ὃ ἂν αἰτώμεθα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:15">1 John 5:15</span> . Plato, Rep. viii. p. 566, speaks of τὸ τυραννικὸν αἴτημα … αἰτεῖν τὸν δῆμον φύλακάς τινας τοῦ σώματος .
	</p>
<p><strong> πρὸς τὸν θεόν</strong> ] <strong> unto</strong> , ‘before,’ ‘ <em> coram</em> :’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:24">Acts 8:24</span> .</p>
