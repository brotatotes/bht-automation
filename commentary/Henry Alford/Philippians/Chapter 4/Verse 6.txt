	 τῇ προσευχῇ καὶ τῇ δεήσει ]  by your prayer and your supplication : or better,  by the prayer and the supplication appropriate to each thing. On the difference between προσευχή and δέησις , see on Ephesians 6:18 , 1 Timothy 2:1 .
	Not μετὰ  τῆς εὐχαριστίας , because the matters themselves may not be recognized as grounds of εὐχαριστία , but  it should  accompany every request. Ellic., who doubts this explanation, thinks it “more simple to say that εὐχαριστία , ‘thanksgiving for past blessings,’ is in its nature more general and comprehensive, προς . and δεησ . almost necessarily more limited and specific. Hence, though εὐχαρ . occurs 12 times in St. Paul’s Epistles, it is only twice used with the article, 1Co 14:26 , 2 Corinthians 4:15 .” But I much prefer the other view.
	 τὰ αἰτήματα ] = ὃ ἂν αἰτώμεθα , 1 John 5:15 . Plato, Rep. viii. p. 566, speaks of τὸ τυραννικὸν αἴτημα … αἰτεῖν τὸν δῆμον φύλακάς τινας τοῦ σώματος .
