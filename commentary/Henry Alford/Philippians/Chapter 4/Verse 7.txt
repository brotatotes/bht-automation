<p><strong> καί</strong> , <strong> and then</strong> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἡ εἰρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> , that peace which rests in God and is wrought by Him in the soul, the counterpoise of all troubles and anxieties see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span> … ἵνα ἐν ἐμοὶ εἰρήνην ἔχητε · ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ θλίψιν ἔχετε . Meyer denies that εἰρήνη ever has this meaning: but he is certainly wrong. The above verse, and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:27">John 16:27</span> , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+3:15">Colossians 3:15</span> , cannot be fully interpreted on <em> his</em> meaning, mere <em> mutual concord</em> . It is of course true, that mutual concord, and τὸ ἐπιεικές , are necessary elements of this peace: but it goes far beyond them. See the alternatives thoroughly discussed, as usual, in Ellic.’s note.

<p><strong> ἡ ὑπερέχουσα πάντα νοῦν</strong> ] not as Chrys., ὅταν λέγῃ πρὸς τοὺς ἐχθροὺς εἰρηνεύειν … πῶς οὐχ ὑπὲρ νοῦν ἐστιν ἀνθρώπινον τοῦτο ; nor as Estius, “quia omnem expectationem humanam excedit, quod Deus pro inimicis sibi reconciliandis filium suum dederit in mortem:” nor as Calvin, “quia nihil humano ingenio magis adversum, quam in summa desperatione nihilominus sperare:” but as Erasm., all., “res felicior quam ut humana mens queat percipere.” <strong> νοῦς</strong> is the <em> intelligent faculty</em> , the perceptive and appreciative power: reff. On the sentiment itself, cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> φρουρήσει</strong> must not with Chrys., Thdrt., Thl., Luth., all. and Vulg., be made <em> optative</em> in sense: it is not a wish, but a declaration following upon the performance of the injunction above.
	</p>
<p><strong> τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὰ νοήματα ὑμῶν</strong> ] The <strong> heart</strong> is the fountain of the <strong> thoughts</strong> , i.e. designs, plans (not <em> minds</em> , as E. V.): so that this expression is equivalent to ‘ <em> your hearts themselves, and their fruits</em> .’
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ</strong> is not the predicate after φρουρήσει <em> shall keep &amp;c. in Christ</em> , i.e. keep them from falling from Christ ( ὥστε μένειν κ . μὴ ἐκπεσεῖν αὐτοῦ τῆς πίστεως , Chrys.): but, as usual, denotes the sphere or element of the φρουρά thus bestowed that it shall be a Christian security: the verb φρουρήσει being <em> absolute</em> .</p>
