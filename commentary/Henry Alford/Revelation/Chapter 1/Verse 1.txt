The Revelation</b> (<b>revelation</b> imports the manifestation of holy mysteries by the enlightening of the leading faculties of the soul, either by divinely imparted dreams, or in a waking vision by divine illumination. Here, the word need not be taken in any but this its general sense, as in 2 Cor. xii. 1, where it is plural; the particular purpose of this revelation follows)<b> of Jesus Christ</b> (how is this genitive to be understood? Is our Lord the subject or the object? Clearly here the former: for it is not Christ who is here revealed, except in a remote sense: but Christ who reveals, as is plain in what follows),<b> which God</b> (the Father)<b> gave to Him</b> (Stern asks, “How are we to understand this? Is not Christ very God, of one essence with the Father from eternity? Did He not, by virtue of the omniscience of His divine nature, know as exactly as the Father, what should be the process of the world’s history, what the fate of the Church? What purpose was served by a revelation from God to Jesus?” He proceeds to say that the words cannot refer merely to the revelation as made to<i> us</i>, but are clearly against such an interpretation: and gives, at some length and very well, that which in one form or other all will accept as the true explanation, in accordance with John vii. 16, xiv. 10, xvii. 7, 8. The man Christ Jesus, even in His glorified state, receives from the Father, by his hypostatic union with Him, that revelation which by His Spirit He imparts to His Church. For, Acts i. 7, the times and seasons are kept by the Father in His own power: and of the day and the hour knoweth no man, not the angels in heaven, nor even the Son, but the Father only, Mark xiii. 32. I may observe, that the coincidence in statement of this deep point of doctrine between the Gospel of St. John and the Apocalypse, is at least remarkable),<b> to shew</b> (is this infinitive of the purpose dependent on the verb<b> gave</b>, or on the substantive<b> revelation</b>? Is it the purpose of God in giving, or the purpose of the revelation in revealing, that is asserted? At all events, Heinrichs is wrong, who takes together,<i> “which God gave</i> [empowered]<i> Him</i> to shew.” But of the others, the construction with<b> gave</b> is the more probable, as being the more usual: “that He might shew,”&c. And the verb<b> shew</b> must not here be confined to its stricter meaning of shewing in vision: for then we must confine the reference of<i> “his servants”</i> to the Apocalyptic Seer alone: but must be taken in its wider sense of exhibiting as knowledge, informing of. So in Matt. xvi. 21)<b> to His</b> (<i>Christ's</i>, most probably, as below in this verse, and ch. ii. 20: for thus the<b> He</b> is kept to the same subject throughout)<b> servants</b> (here meaning all Christians, not prophets only. ‘That John himself is one of these<i> servants</i> below, docs not affect this general meaning)<b> what things must</b> (by the necessity of the divine decree: see Matt. xvii. 10, xxiv. 6, xxvi. 54al.)<b> come to pass shortly</b> (i. e.<i> before long.</i> ‘The context, the repetition below,<i> “for the time is at hand,”</i> and the parallel ch. xxii. 6, followed, ver. 7, by<i> “Lo, I come quickly,”</i> fix this meaning here, as distinguished from the other of<i> ‘swiftly,’</i> which is also precluded by the form of construction in the original. This expression must not be urged to signify that the events of apocalyptic prophecy were to be close at hand: for we have a key to its meaning in Luke xviii. 8, where our Lord says,<i> “Shall not God avenge His elect, which cry unto Him day and night, even if He is</i><b> long-suffering</b><i> with them? I say unto you that He will avenge them</i><b> shortly</b>:” where long delay is evidently implied. Hengstenberg, repudiates this, and says it is self-evident that these words can only be adduced here “by a wrong method of interpretation.” But surely the two cases are exactly parallel: and his strong language here, as elsewhere, proves nothing. His own interpretation of the words, natural as he seems to think it, is forced and unwarrantable. He (in common with many others) takes them to mean that the events spoken of would very soon<i> begin</i> to take place, The axe, he says, lay at the root of the Roman Empire when John wrote this, as it did at the root of the Persian Empire when Daniel wrote. But this interpretation is not borne out by the Greek. The words cannot signify “which must soon<i> begin</i> to come to pass,” but, “which, in their entirety, must soon come to pass.” So that we are driven to the very same sense of<b> shortly</b> as that in Luke xviii. above, viz. to<i> God's speedy time</i>, though He seem to delay: in spite of the scorn which Hengstenberg pours on this meaning. His maxim, that a Prophet, speaking to men, must speak according to men’s ideas, is quite worthless, and may be confuted by any similar prophetic saying, even by the one which he brings in its favour, Hagg. ii. 7: and his complaint, that thus we make the Seer and even the Lord Himself like bad physicians who delude their patients with false hopes [so, in the main, Stern also], is unworthy of a Christian Expositor, after our Lord’s own plain use of the same method of speech again and again in His prophecies in the Gospels and in this book. It remains to observe, that these words cannot with any fairness be used as furnishing a guide to the interpretation of the prophecy. They are far rather to be regarded as a prophetic formula, common with Him to whom a thousand years are as one day, and used in order to teach us how short our time, and the time of this our world, is. See on the whole, Fbrard’s able note, and his remarks on the absurdity of Hengstenberg’s pressing the words in favour of his præterist. scheme);<b> and He</b> (<i>Jesus Christ</i>, not<i> God</i>, see ch. xxii, 16: the subject is changed, and the relative construction abandoned. So almost all Commentators)<b> signified [it] sending by His angel</b> (the Angel mentioned is the same who informs the Seer in chap. xvii. 1, 7, 15, xix. 9, xxi. 9, xxii. 1, 6, which latter place takes up this; ib. 8 ff.; and who is spoken of by our Lord ib. 16. It is remarkable that this angel docs not appear as the imparter of the visions until ch. xvii. Some indeed, as Ewald, have fancied that they trace his presence in ch. Iv. 1 and throughout: but ch. Xvii. 1 is too manifestly the introduction to a new appearance for this to be the case; and previously to that the Seer receives his information from different persons. Our Lord Himself opens the Apocalyptic vision; but it is another voice which calls John up to the place of heavenly vision, ch. iv. 1. In vii. 13, one of the four and twenty elders speaks to him: in x. 8, it is the former voice again which addresses him, and in ib. 9, it is the angel who stands on the earth and the sea that gives him the book. Only in the great close of the prophecy, opening with ch. xvii., does one angel stand by him; referred to, as here, under the name<b> the angel</b>. In the visions of Daniel and Zechariah an angel mediated: Dan. viii. 16, ix. 20, x. 10 ff., Zech. i. 1, 19, al.)<b> to His servant John</b> (on the whole question of the writer of the book, see Introduction),
