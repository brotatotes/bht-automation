<b>I was</b> ( “Je me trouvais:” not merely<i> “I was,”</i> but<i> “I became”</i>)<b> in the Spirit</b> (i. e. in a state of spiritual ecstasy or trance, becoming thereby receptive of the vision or revelation to follow. That this is the meaning is distinctly shewn by the same phrase occurring in ch. iv. 2: where after seeing the door open in heaven, and hearing the<i> “Come up hither,”</i> he adds,<i> “immediately I became in the Spirit.”</i> See also ch. xxi. 10. Ebrard well says, “Connexion with surrounding objects through the senses is suspended, and a connexion with the invisible world established.” On the attempt made by some to give the words a different meaning, see below)<b> on the Lord’s day</b> (i. e. on the first day of the week, kept by the Christian church as the weekly festival of the Lord’s resurrection. On any probable hypothesis of the date of this book, this is the earliest mention of the day by this name. This circumstance, coupled with a bias in favour of a peculiar method of interpretation, has led certain modern interpreters, of whom, as far as I know, Wetstein was the first, to interpret the words of the day of<i> the Lord’s coming.</i> So Züllig, and in our own country, Drs. S.R. Maitland and Todd. But 1) the difficulty of the thus early occurrence of this term,<i> “the Lord’s day,”</i> is no real one. Dr. Maitland says [see Todd’s Lectures on the Apoc., Note B, p. 295], “I know of nothing in the Scripture or in the works of the ante-Nicene Fathers on which to ground such an assumption.” To this we may answer, that the extent of Dr. Maitland’s knowledge of the ante-Nicene Fathers does not, happily for us, decide the question: as the expression occurs repeatedly in those very Fathers: see the citations in my Greek Test. Mr. Elliott, Hor. Apoc. iv. 367 note, has pointed out that the primitive Syriac version renders 1 Cor. xi. 20, “not as befitteth the day of the Lord ye eat and drink,” which is an interesting proof of the early usage. This chronological objection being disposed of, and the matter 2) taken on its own merits, it really is astonishing how any even moderate Greek scholars ean persuade themselves that the words can mean that which these Commentators maintain. See this shewn in my Greck Test.):<b> and I heard a voice</b> (see Ezek. iii. 12)<b> behind me</b> (Isa. xxx. 21),<b> great as of a trumpet,</b>
