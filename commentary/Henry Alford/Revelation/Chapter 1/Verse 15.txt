<p><strong> 15</strong> .] <strong> and his feet were like to chalcolibanus</strong> (this word has defeated all the ingenuity of Commentators hitherto. The Vulg. has <em> aurichalcum</em> (or <em> ori-</em> see Cic de Off. iii. 23. 12, Hor. de Art. poet. 202), the Syriac and Arethas, “ <em> brass from Lebanon</em> ” (1st altern. in catena, εἴτε τὸν ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ τῷ ὄρει μεταλλευόμενον ), the Arabic “ <em> Greek brass</em> ,” Andreas, and most of the German editions of the Bible, <em> a kind of incense so called</em> (2nd altern. in catena, εἴτε καὶ τὸν χαλκοειδῆ λιβάνωτον νοητέον , ὃν ἰατρῶν παῖδες ἄῤῥενα καλοῦσιν , εὐώδεις καὶ αὐτὸν πυρὶ ὁμιλοῦντα ἀτμοὺς ἀποπέμποντα : Germ., <em> Erzmeihrauch</em> ), on the authority of Antonius of Nebrissa (in Salmasius (Wetst.), ὁ λίβανος ἔχει τρία εἴδη δένδρων , καὶ ὁ μὲν ἄῤῥην ὀνομάζεται χαλκολίβανος , ἡλιοείδης καὶ πυῤῥός , ἤγουν ξανθός ), who understands by the word some superior species of frankincense, the so-called ‘thus masculum:’ for in Greek frankincense is called λίβανος , after the Heb. לְבָנָה or לְבוֹנָה , from the root לָבַן , <em> albus fuit</em> . This writer refers to hymns of Orpheus in honour of Apollo and of Artemis, in which χαλκολίβ . occurs in the sense of a costly kind of incense (but all we find in the titles of hymns 7, 19, 21, 65, is λιβανόμαννα , possibly a mixture of frankincense and manna), and to Virg. Ecl. viii. 65, ‘Verbenasque adole pingues et mascula thura.’ Still it appears somewhat strained to refer χαλκολίβανος or - ον to ‘thus masculum:’ for, granted that ‘masculum’ may betoken its purity and clearness, how is χάλκος accounted for, which looks more like a hint at <em> hardness?</em> Besides, incense is not burnt ἐν καμίνῳ , in a smelting furnace, but in a censer or shallow vessel, and its colour while burning is no way observable. The interpretation, “brass from Lebanon,” does not appear to be tenable, as there is no notice of Lebanon ever having produced brass of superior quality, such as this from the context must be. Suidas interprets it thus: χαλκολίβανον , εἶδος , ἠλέκτρου τιμιώτερον χρυσοῦ . ἔστι δὲ τὸ ἤλεκτρον ἀλλότυπον χρυσίον μεμιγμένον ὑελῷ καὶ λιθείᾳ . And this, considering that in the similar and model passage, Dan 10:6 LXX, we have χάλκος ἐξαστράπτων (as also in Eze 1:7 ), ib. Theod. χάλκος στίλβων (as also in Eze 40:3 ), and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:4">Ezekiel 1:4</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:27">Ezekiel 1:27</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+8:2">Ezekiel 8:2</span> , ἤλεκτρον , seems the most likely direction in which to find the meaning. Still, as almost all Commentators confess, it must remain enigmatical, of what the word is compounded, and to what it precisely applies. According to usual analogy, not χάλκος but λίβανος is the central idea, and χάλκος the qualifying one, as in χαλκάνθη , χαλκόλιθος , χαλκοθήκη , &amp;c. But this makes the difficulty greater; for we can assign no meaning to λίβανος which would fit this requirement. If conjecture were admissible (which it is not), I should, in despair of any way out of the difficulty, suggest whether the word might not have been χαλκολιβαδίῳ , a stream of melted brass: ΔΙ having been read ΛΙ or Ν . At all events this may rank with Hitzig’s conjecture, χαλχοκλιβάνῳ ), <strong> as if they had been burnt in a furnace</strong> (and so red-hot and glowing): <strong> and his voice as the voice of many waters</strong> (Ebrard sees an allusion to the quiet and majestic sound of the sea, appealing to ch. Rev 17:1 and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span> ; but, as Düsterdieck remarks, there seems to be no such allusion here, but only to the <em> power</em> of the voice as resembling the rushing of many waters. So Dan 10:6 Theod., ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ ὡς φωνὴ ὄχλου : <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+43:2">Ezekiel 43:2</span> , where the same expression is found (in the Heb., with which agree Vulg., Syr., &amp;c., but not LXX), <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:24">Ezekiel 1:24</span> , where the sound of the wings of the creatures is ὡς φωνὴ ὕδατος πολλοῦ ).</p>
