<b> 19.] Write therefore</b> ( ‘because I have vouchsafed thee this vision,—I whose majesty is such, and whose manifested loving-kindness to thee.” ‘The connexion is better thus than with ver. 11, as some: “Now that thy fear is over, write what I bade thee.” But it is very doubtful whether ver. 11 is spoken by our Lord at all: see there) t<b> he things which thou sawest</b> (just now: the vision which was but now vouchsafed thee),<b> and what things they are</b> (two meanings of the words thus rendered are possible. 1)<i> ‘the things which are,’</i> viz. which exist at the present time.

Notice, it is not<i> “the things which must come to pass,”</i> as in ver. 1: not the necessity of prophecy, but only the sequence of things seen);
