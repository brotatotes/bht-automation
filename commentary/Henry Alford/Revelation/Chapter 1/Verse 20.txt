<b> 20.] the mystery</b> (i. e. the secret signification)<b> of the seven stars which thou sawest upon</b> (held in, and so standing over, as a wreath)<b> my right hand, and the seven candlesticks of gold</b> (elliptic construction for<i> ‘and the mystery of the seven candlesticks,’</i><br><br>&c.).—<b>The seven stars are</b> (signify) [the]<b> angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches</b> (the import of the<b> angels</b> has been much disputed. Very many both ancient and modern Commentators take them for the<i> presiding presbyters</i>, or<i> bishops</i>, of the churches. This view is variously supported. It derives probability from the analogy of the vision itself, in which, seeing that the candelabra represent the churches themselves, existing vessels containing much light, the stars, concentrated sparks of light, should represent some actually existing persons in or connected with the churches. Again it is supported by our finding that throughout the seven Epistles the angel is treated as representing and responsible for the particular church. But before we pass on to the other great section of interpretation, we may at once dismiss those forms of this one which make the<i> angel</i> the<i> ideal representative</i> of the governing body, or an<i> ideal messenger</i> from the church, or an anticipatory idea of the office of Bishop, not yet instituted: or, in short, any idealism at all. As the<i> church</i> is an objective reality, so must the<i> angel</i> be, of whatever kind. This consideration will also affect the current of interpretation which takes the angels to be<i> the churches themselves</i>. The second line of interpretation is that which regards them as<i> angels</i>, in some way representing the churches. In favour of this is 1) the constant usage of this book, in which the word<b> angel</b> occurs only in this sense: 2) the further usage of this book, in which we have, ch. xvi. 4, the<i> angel of the waters</i> introduced without any explanation, who can be none other than the angel presiding over the waters: 3) the expression of our Lord Himself, Matt. xviii. 10,<i> “their angels in heaven do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven,”</i> coupled with that expressed by the church in the house of Mary the mother of John Mark, Acts xii. 15, with regard to their disbelief of Peter standing at the door,<i> “it is his angel:”</i> both asserting the doctrine that angels are allotted to persons, and are regarded as representing them: a subject full of mystery, and requiring circumspect treatment, but by no means to be put aside, as is commonly done. 4) The extension of this from individuals to nations in the book of Daniel, which is so often the key to apocalyptic interpretation. See Dan. x. 21, xii. 1: an analogy according to which there might well be angels not only of individuals, but of churches. 5) The fact that throughout these Epistles, nothing is ever addressed individually as to a teacher, but as to some one person reflecting as it were the complexion and fortunes of the church ina way in which no mere human teacher or ruler could. That there is no exception to this in ch. ii. 20, see maintained in note there. 6) To the objection advanced in the comment of Arethas, that “<i>the presiding</i><i> angel had not sinned</i>, so as to want exhorting to repent, &c.,” the reply may be made, with advantage to this interpretation, that there evidently is revealed to us a mysterious connexion between ministering angels and those to whom they minister, by which the former in some way are tinged by the fates and fortunes of the latter. E.g. in our Lord’s saying cited above, the place of dignity there asserted of the angels of the little children is unquestionably connected with the character of those whose angels they are: and it cannot be following out such a revelation too far to say that, if some of the holy angels are thus and for this reason advanced to honour, others may be similarly, and for the opposite reason, placed in less honour and relatively disgraced. That this idea is found expressed in the Rabbinical writings is a mark of the further development of the truth, which seems to have been first revealed to Daniel. 7) It will be perceived that this interpretation does not lie under any of the objections stated above as idealizing that which ought to be an objective reality. For it contemplates the angels of the churches as really existent, not as ideal beings. It is only when this latter is the case, that those objections can apply. 8) It will also be perceived, that both the circumstances, which were cited as making for the former interpretation, tell equally for this: viz. a) that just noticed, the actual existence of these persons in or belonging to the churches, and b) the fact that in the Epistles the angel is treated as representing and responsible for the particular church.<br><br> So that I cannot but regard this second view as far the more likely one. It has been taken by Origen, Jerome, and several more of the ancients, and by many among the moderns.<br><br> The attempt to defend the interpretation of<i> angels</i> as bishops by the analogy of the<i> legate of the congregation</i>, in the synagogue, appears to be futile, inasmuch as that officer held quite an inferior place, in no way corresponding to a bishop, or any kind of president of the church.<br><br> As regards the symbolism,<i> stars</i> are the symbols of the angels of the churches, inasmuch as angels are beings of light, Heb. i. 7 [from Ps. civ. 4], where see note; Job xxxviii. 4, where they are called the morning stars, The same symbolism is used in the prophets of Lucifer, the daystar, the son of the morning, Isa. xiv. 12 ff., who would exalt his throne above the stars of God, ib. ver. 13; Rev. xii. 4, 9. See also Luke x. 18. That stars are also used to symbolize earthly authorities, is what might be expected from the very nature of the symbol, and should never have been alleged here as a reason against the literal interpretation of<b> angels</b>.<br><br> The churches themselves are represented by candlesticks, agreeably with the universal symbolism both of the prophetic and evangelic Scriptures. Compare Prov. iv. 18; Isa. lx. 1, 3; Matt. v. 14, 16; Luke xii. 35; Phil. ii. 15).
