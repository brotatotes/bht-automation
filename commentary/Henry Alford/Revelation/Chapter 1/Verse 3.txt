<b> 3.] Blessed is</b> (or<i> be</i>, in the ordinary meaning of<b> blessed</b>: not necessarily referring on to eternal blessedness, as Hengst.)<b> he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy and observe the things written in it; for the time is near</b> (it can hardly be reasonably denied that in the terms,<b> he that readeth</b>, and<b> they that hear</b>, the Apostle had in his mind the one public reader and the many hearers. And so the great majority of Commentators. If the words are to be thus understood as above, they form at least a solemn rebuke to the most unjustifiable practice of the Church of England, which omits with one or two exceptions the whole of this book from her public readings. Not one word of the precious messages of the Spirit to the Churches is ever heard in the public services of a Church never weary of appealing to her<i> Scriptural</i> liturgies. Surely it is high time, that our timid rulers should gather courage to face their duties, and such an omission should be supplied.â€”Notice that not three classes of persons, but two only, are here indicated: he that reads, and they that hear and do.
