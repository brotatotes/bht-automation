<b>Behold He</b> (the Person last spoken of: the subject being continued from the preceding verses)<b> cometh with the clouds</b> (<b>the</b> clouds, viz. of heaven: so expressed in Dan. vii. 13, and Mark xiv. 62: compare “<i>in the cloud</i>,” ch. xi. 12),<b> and every eye shall see Him</b> (by a well-known figure, not merely Hebraistic but common to all tongues, the acting member is said to do that which the man does by its means.
