<b> 9.]</b><i> Description of the Writer, and of the place where the Revelation was seen.</i><b> I John</b> (so again ch. xxii. 8: so Daniel, viii. 1, ix. 2, x. 2)<b> your brother</b> (no inference can be drawn against the apostleship of the Writer from this his designation of himself. Indeed from his entire silence respecting himself in his Gospel, we may well believe that here, where mention of his name was absolutely required, it would. be introduced thus humbly and unobtrusively),<b> and fellow-partaker in the tribulation</b><b> and kingdom and endurance</b> [or,<b> patience</b>]<b> in Jesus</b> (the construction and arrangement are peculiar. The conjunction of these terms seems to be made to express, a partaker, as in the kingdom, so in the tribulation and endurance which are in and by Christ: but the insertion of<b> kingdom</b> between<b> tribulation</b> and<b> endurance</b> is startling. Probably, the tribulation brings in the kingdom [Acts xiv. 22], and then as a corrective to the idea that the kingdom in its blessed fulness was yet present, the endurance is subjoined. “John introduces three portions of inheritances in which he declares himself partaker. But the middle one of these, i.e. the kingdom, cannot be possessed, unless with the exercise of tribulation on the one side, and the defence of patience on the other.” Ambrose Ansbert [8th century]),<b> was</b> (found myself)<b> in the island which is called Patmos</b> (see Introduction,§ii. par. 4)<b> on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus</b> (the substantives form the same expression as occurred before, ver. 2, where see note. There they indicated<i> this</i> portion of the divine word and testimony, of which John was a faithful reporter. Whether their meaning is the same here, will depend partly on what sense we assign to<b> “on account of.”</b> In St. Paul’s usage, it would here signify<i> for the sake of,</i> i.e. for the purpose of receiving: so that the Apostle would thus have gone to Patmos by special revelation in order to receive this revelation. Again, keeping to this meaning, these words may mean, that he had visited Patmos in pursuance of, for the purposes of, his ordinary apostolic employment, which might well be designated by these substantives. And such perhaps would have been our acceptation of the words, but that three objections intervene. 1) From what has preceded in this verse, a strong impression remains on the mind that St. John wrote this in a season of tribulation and persecution. Why should he throw over his address this tinge of suffering given by the tribulation and patience, if this were not the case? 2) The usage of our Writer himself in two passages where he speaks of death by persecution [ch. vi. 9, xx. 4] shews that with him<b> on account of</b> [or,<b> for</b>] in this connexion is<i> “because of,”</i><i> “in consequence of.”</i> And St. John’s own, usage is a better guide in St. John’s writings, than that of St. Paul. Besides which, Origen’s Greek ear found no offence in this usage, for he incorporated it into his own sentence,... “He condemned John in his testimony, on account of the word of truth, to the island Patmos.” 3) An early patristic tradition relates that St. John was banished to Patmos. See the authorities in the Introduction, and the question discussed, whether we are justified in ascribing this tradition solely to our present passage. These considerations, mainly those arising from the passage itself, compel us, I believe, to understand the words of an exile in Patmos).
