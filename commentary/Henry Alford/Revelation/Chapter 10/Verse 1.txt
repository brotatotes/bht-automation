<b> CH. X. 1–X1. 14.]</b> EPISODICAL AND ANTICIPATORY. As after the sixth seal, so here after the sixth trumpet, we have a passage interposed, containing two episodes, completing that which has been already detailed, and introducing the final member of the current series. But it is not so easy here as there, to ascertain the relevance and force of the episodes. Their subjects here seem further off: their action more complicated. In order to appreciate them, it will be necessary to lay down clearly the point at which we have arrived, and to observe what is at that point required.<br><br> The last vision witnessed the destruction of a third part of the ungodly by the horsemen from the East, and left the remainder in a state of impenitent idolatry and sin. Manifestly then the prayers of the saints are not yet answered, however near the time may be for that answer. If then this Episode contains some assurance of the approach of that answer in its completeness, it will be what we might expect at this point in the series of visions.<br><br> At the same time, looking onwards to the rest of the book, we see, that as out of the more general series of visions at the opening of the seals, affecting both the church and the world, there sprang a new and more particular series of the trumpets, having reference to one incident in the former vision, and affecting especially the “inhabiters of the earth,” so if now the gaze of prophecy once more turns to the church and her fortunes, and the Apostle receives a new commission to utter a second series of prophecies, mainly on that subject, it will also be no more than what we might fairly look for.<br><br> Again: if the episodical vision in its character and hue partakes of the complexion of the whole series of trumpet-visions, and, as regards the church, carries a tinge of persecution, and of the still crying prayer for vengeance, not yet fully answered,—while at the same time it contains expressions and allusions which can only be explained by reference onward to the visions yet to come; this complex character is just that which would suit the point of transition at which we are now standing, when the series of visions immediately dependent on one feature in the opening of the seals is just at its end, and a new one evolving the other great subject of that general series is about to begin.<br><br> Now each one of these particulars is found as described above. For 1) the angel of ch. x. declares, with reference to the great vengeance-burden of the whole series of the trumpet-visions, respecting which the souls of the martyrs had been commanded “<i>that they should rest yet for a time</i>,” ch. vi. 11,—that<i> “there should be no more delay,”</i> but that in the days of the seventh angel, when he is about to blow, the whole mystery of prophecy would be fulfilled.<br><br> 2) The same angel gives to the Seer the open little book, with a distinct announcement that he is to begin a new series of prophecies, and that series, by what immediately follows, ch. xi. 1 ff., evidently relating to the church of God in an especial ananner.<br><br> 3) The whole complexion of the episodical vision of the two witnesses, ch. xi. 3 ff., is tinged with the hue wh has pervaded the series of trumpet-visions, from their source in ch. vi. 9–11, viz., that of vengeance for the sufferings of the saints: while at the same time allusions occur in it which are at present inexplicable, but will receive light hereafter, when the new series of visions is unfolded. Such are the allusions to “<i>the wild beast which cometh up out of the abyss</i>,” ch. x. 7, and to “<i>the great city,</i>” ib. ver. 8.<br><br> With these preliminary considerations, we may, I think, approach these episodical visions with less uncertainty.<br><br><b>And I saw another strong angel</b> (<b>another</b>, perhaps in allusion to the many which have been mentioned: but seeing that the epithet<b> strong</b> occurs only in the mention of the angel who cried out in reference to the sealed book, ch. v. 2, and that the present angel’s errand also regards a book, we can hardly help taking<b> another</b> with both substantive and adjective, and referring it to that first<b> strong angel</b> in ch. v. 2, And this consideration may serve to introduce the assertion, to me hardly admitting of a doubt, that this angel is not, and cannot be, our Lord Himself. Such a supposition would, it seems to me, entirely break through the consistency of apocalyptic analogy. Throughout the book, as before observed, on ch. viii. 3, angels are the ministers of the divine purposes, and the carriers out of the apocalyptic course of procedure, but are every where<i> distinct from the divine Persons themselves.</i> In order to this their ministry, they are invested with such symbols and such delegated attributes as beseem in each case the particular object in view: but no apparent fitness of such symbolical investiture to the divine character should induce us to break through the distinction, and introduce indistinctness and confusion into the book. When St. John means to indicate the Son of God, he indicates Him plainly: none more so: when these plain indications are absent, and I find the name<b> angel</b> used, I must take leave to regard the agent as distinct from Him,—however clothed, for the purposes of the particular vision, with His delegated power and attributes)<b> descending</b><b> out of heaven</b> (the place of the Seer yet continues in heaven: see below, vv. 8, 9)<b>, clothed with a cloud</b> (as a messenger of divine judgment: see ch. i. 7),<b> and the rainbow upon his head</b> (<b>the</b>, i.e., the well-known, ordinary rainbow: indicating, agreeably with its first origin, God’s covenant of mercy. See note on ch. iv. 3)<b>, and his face as the sun</b> (indicating the divine glory with which he was invested: see ch. i. 16, xviii. 1: and compare Luke ix. 26),<b> and his feet as pillars of fire</b> (see ch. i. 15. The symbols with which this angel is accompanied, as those which surrounded the throne of God in ch. iv. 2 ff., betoken judgment tempered with mercy, the character of his ministration, which, at the same time that it proclaims the near approach of the completion of God’s judgments, furnishes to the Seer the book of his subsequent prophecy, the following out of God’s purposes of mercy)<b>,
