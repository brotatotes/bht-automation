<b> CH. X. 1–X1. 14.]</b> EPISODICAL AND ANTICIPATORY. As after the sixth seal, so here after the sixth trumpet, we have a passage interposed, containing two episodes, completing that which has been already detailed, and introducing the final member of the current series. But it is not so easy here as there, to ascertain the relevance and force of the episodes. Their subjects here seem further off: their action more complicated. In order to appreciate them, it will be necessary to lay down clearly the point at which we have arrived, and to observe what is at that point required.<br><br><b>And I saw another strong angel</b> (<b>another</b>, perhaps in allusion to the many which have been mentioned: but seeing that the epithet<b> strong</b> occurs only in the mention of the angel who cried out in reference to the sealed book, ch. v. 2, and that the present angel’s errand also regards a book, we can hardly help taking<b> another</b> with both substantive and adjective, and referring it to that first<b> strong angel</b> in ch. v. 2, And this consideration may serve to introduce the assertion, to me hardly admitting of a doubt, that this angel is not, and cannot be, our Lord Himself. Such a supposition would, it seems to me, entirely break through the consistency of apocalyptic analogy. Throughout the book, as before observed, on ch. viii. 3, angels are the ministers of the divine purposes, and the carriers out of the apocalyptic course of procedure, but are every where<i> distinct from the divine Persons themselves.</i> In order to this their ministry, they are invested with such symbols and such delegated attributes as beseem in each case the particular object in view: but no apparent fitness of such symbolical investiture to the divine character should induce us to break through the distinction, and introduce indistinctness and confusion into the book. When St. John means to indicate the Son of God, he indicates Him plainly: none more so: when these plain indications are absent, and I find the name<b> angel</b> used, I must take leave to regard the agent as distinct from Him,—however clothed, for the purposes of the particular vision, with His delegated power and attributes)<b> descending</b><b> out of heaven</b> (the place of the Seer yet continues in heaven: see below, vv. 8, 9)<b>, clothed with a cloud</b> (as a messenger of divine judgment: see ch. i. 7),<b> and the rainbow upon his head</b> (<b>the</b>, i.e., the well-known, ordinary rainbow: indicating, agreeably with its first origin, God’s covenant of mercy. See note on ch. iv. 3)<b>, and his face as the sun</b> (indicating the divine glory with which he was invested: see ch. i. 16, xviii. 1: and compare Luke ix. 26),<b> and his feet as pillars of fire</b> (see ch. i. 15. The symbols with which this angel is accompanied, as those which surrounded the throne of God in ch. iv. 2 ff., betoken judgment tempered with mercy, the character of his ministration, which, at the same time that it proclaims the near approach of the completion of God’s judgments, furnishes to the Seer the book of his subsequent prophecy, the following out of God’s purposes of mercy)<b>,
