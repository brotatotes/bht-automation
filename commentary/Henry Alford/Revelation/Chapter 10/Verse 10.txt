And I took the book out of the hand of the angel, and ate it up: and it was in my mouth as honey; and when I had eaten it up, my belly was embittered</b> (there is the difference between Ezekiel’s roll and this, that in the pro-phet’s case, only the sweetness in the mouth is mentioned, ‘The Angel, dwelling most on the most important thing, the working of the contents of the book, puts the bitterness first: the Evangelist, in relating what happened, follows the order of time. The text itself will guard us against some misinterpretations of this bitterness and sweetness. It is plain that we must understand these to belong, not to differing characters of different portions of the contents of the book [as some], but to different sensations of the Evangelist in different parts of bis body respecting one and the same content of the book. Nor again must we invert the order, imagining [us others] that the first bitterness leads afterwards to sweetness and joy, or [as others again] that the bitterness in the belly indicates the reception by the Evangelist, but the sweetness in the mouth, the declaration to others; proceeding on a misunderstanding of ver. 11). For further particulars, see below on ver. 11).
