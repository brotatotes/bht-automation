<b>And they say</b> (this leaves the speakers quite indefinite; amounting in fact to no more than “it was said”)<b> to me, Thou must</b> (i. e. it is God’s will that thou shouldest: a command is laid upon thee so to do)<b> again prophesy</b> (as thou hast done before in writing the former part of the revelation: see in the interpretation below)<b> concerning</b> (not as A, V. “<i>before</i>” nor can the original bear such a meaning. The substantives which follow the preposition are the objects of the prophecy)<b> peoples and nations and languages and many kings</b> (i. e. concerning the inhabitants of the earth, as before: compare ch. v. 9, where the Lamb’s worthiness to open the former book is connected with His having redeemed some out of every<i> tribe and language and people and nation</i>). I have postponed till this point the question, what we are to understand by the<b> little book</b>, and the Seer’s concern with it. And I will at once say, before discussing the various differing interpretations, that I conceive the simple acceptation of the description and symbolism here can lead but to one conclusion: viz. that it represents the<i> mystery</i><i> of God</i> above spoken of, the subject of the remainder of the Apocalyptic prophecies. So far, many of the principal Commentators are at one. Indeed it is difficult to conceive how any other interpretation can have been thought of, except as made necessary by some previous self-committal of the Expositor regarding the sealed book of ch. v., or by the exigencies of some historical system. But within the limits of this agreed meaning, there are many different views as to the extent of the reference of the “little book” to that which follows, and as to its relation to the seven-sealed book of ch. v. As regards these points, we may remark, 1) that the contents of the “little hook” cannot well be confined to ch. xi. 1–13, or we should not have had so solemn an inauguration of it, nor so wide-reaching an announcement of the duty of the Apostle consequent on the receipt of it: 2) that the oath of the Angel must necessarily be connected with his bearing of the open book on his hand, and if so, makes it necessary to infer that the contents of the book are identical with the mystery, respecting which he swears: 3) that the episode which follows, containing the first work of the Apostle under that his new prophetic commission, inaugurates an entirely new matter—the things which befall the Church of God and the holy city, which new character of incidents continues to prevail until the very end of the book: 4) that the relation of this “little book” to the sealed book of ch. v. can hardly be doubtful to the readers of this Commentary, seeing that we have maintained that book to be the sum of the divine purposes, which is not opened at all within the limits of the apocalyptic vision, bat only prepared to be opened by the removal of its seven seals. That this is not that complete record of the divine purposes, nor, technically speaking, any portion of it, must. be evident to us. For it forms a small detached roll or volume, lying open on the angel’s hand: it is destined for the especial individual behoof of the Seer, into whom it passes, and becomes assimilated with himself, to be given forth as he should be directed to utter it. 5) That it contained<i> more than</i> we possess in the remaining portion of this book, is probable. St. John doubtless knew more than he has told us. Previously to this, he knew what the seven thunders uttered: and subsequently to this, we can hardly imagine that he was ignorant of the name of the wild-beast, whose number he has given us. It remains that we say something on the circumstances accompanying the Apostle’s reception of the mysterious book. Its<i> sweetness</i>, when he tasted it, allusive as it is to the same circumstance in Ezekiel’s eating the roll which was all lamentation, mourning, and woe, doubtless represents present satisfaction at being informed of, and admitted to know, a portion of God’s holy will: of those words of which the Psalmist said, Ps. cxix. 103, “How sweet are thy words unto my taste, yea sweeter than honey to my mouth!” But when the roll eame to be not only tasted, but digested,—the nature of its contents felt within the man,—bitterness took the place of sweetness: the persecutions, the apostasies, the judgments, of the church and people of the Lord, saddened the spirit of the Seer, and dashed his joy at the first reception of the mystery of God.
