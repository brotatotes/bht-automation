And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write</b> (in obedience to the command in ch. i. 19):<b> and</b> (as I was about to write, a new circumstance arose)<b> I heard a voice out of heaven</b> (from which it does not follow that the Seer is on earth, any more than in ver. 1)<b> saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them</b> (compare the contrary command, ch. xxii. 10. Many speculations have been raised as to the purport of the utterances of the seven thunders, and the reason for concealing them. From the very nature of the case, these must be utterly in vain. The wisdom of Him, who signified this Revelation to His servant John, has not seen fit to reveal these things to us. But the very nature of the case also convicts some of these speculations of error. The thunders, e.g., did not speak<i> “things exceeding human comprehension,”</i> as Ewald thinks, seeing that not only did St. John understand their utterances, but he was about to write them down for others to read, as intelligible to them also. Again, they were not any utterances of mere human device. They were spoken by command of the great angel, as ver. 3 necessarily implies: they, in common with the seals, trumpets, and vials, form part of the divinely-arranged machinery of the Apocalypse. It is matter of surprise and grief therefore, when we find historical interpreters of our day explaining them of the papal anathemas of the time of the Reformation. It seems to me that no interpretation could be more unfortunate—none more thoroughly condemnatory of the system which is compelled to have recourse to it. For, merely to insist upon one point,—if it were so, then the Apostle sealed the utterances in vain, for all know what those thunders have uttered: then the command should have run “<i>seal the book even to the time of the end,</i>” as in Dan. xii. 4, instead of an absolute command as here. Thus much we may infer; from the very character of thunder,—that the utterances were of fearful import: from the place which they hold,—that they related to the church: from the command to conceal them,—first, encouragement, that God in His tender mercy to His own does not reveal all His terrors: secondly, godly fear, seeing that the arrows of His quiver are not exhausted, but besides things expressly foretold, there are more behind not revealed to us).
