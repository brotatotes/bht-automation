<b>And there was given to me</b> (by whom, is not said, but it is left indefinite, as at ch. vi. 11, viii. 2)<b> a reed like to a staff</b> (see reff.),<b> saying,</b> (this word,<b> saying</b>, is out of the construction, and indefinite: as in ch. iv. 1),<b> Arise</b> (this word does not necessarily imply that the Apostle was kneeling before)<b> and measure the temple of God and the altar</b> (apparently, the altar of incense: as that alone stood in the temple, properly so called. But perhaps we must not be too minute in particularizing), and them that worship in it (see the previous remarks on this prophecy. The<i> measuring</i> here is evidently for the purpose of taking account of, understanding the bearing and dimensions of, that which is to be measured: see ch. xxi. 15, where the heavenly Jerusalem is measured. by the angel. But here two questions arise: 1) What is that which is measured? and 2) when does the measuring take place? 1) have no doubt that, as above hinted,<i> the temple of God</i> and its<i> altar</i> are to be here taken symbolically, as the other principal features of the prophecy: and to one believing this, there can be but little further doubt us to what meaning he shall assign to the terms. Thus understood, they can only bear one meaning viz. that of the Church of the elect servants of God, every where in this book symbolized by Jews in deed and truth. The society of these, as a whole is the<i> temple</i>, agreeably to Scripture symbolism elsewhere, e.g. 1 Cor. ii. 16, 17, and is symbolized by the inner or holy place of the Jerusalem temple, and among which they as true Israelites and priests unto God, have a right to worship and minister, These are they who, properly speaking, alone are<i> measured</i>: estimated again and again in this book by tale and number—partakers in the first resurrection,—the Church of the first-born. Then as to our question 2), it is one which, so far as I know, has not engaged the attention of expositors. When a command is elsewhere in this book given to the Seer, we may observe that his fulfilment of it is commonly indicated. He is commanded to write, and the writing before us proves his obedience. He is ordered to take the little book, and he goes and takes it. But of the fulfilment by him of this command,<b> Arise and measure</b>, no hint appears to be given. The voice goes on continuously, until it melts imperceptibly into the narrative of the vision, and we are startled by “<i>and I heard a loud voice</i>,” in ver. 12, when we had thought it to be still speaking. After that, we hear no more of the measuring, till another and more glorious building is measured in ch. xxi. This being so, either 1) which is inconceivable, the measurement does not take place at all, or, 2) which is hardly probable, it takes place and no result is communicated to us, or 3) the result of it is found in the subsequent prophecies: in the minute and careful distinctions between the servants of God and those who receive the mark of the wild-beast—in all those indications which point out to us the length and breadth and depth and height, both of faith, and of unfaithfulness).
