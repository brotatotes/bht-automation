<b>And they that dwell upon the earth</b> (i. e., the godless world)<b> rejoice over them</b> (at their fall)<b> and are glad, and shall send gifts to one another</b> (as on a day of festival, see Neh. viii, 10, 12; Esth. ix. 19, 29),<b> because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth</b> (viz. by the plagues above mentioned, vv. 5, 6).
