And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city</b> (the great city, as above)<b> fell, and</b><b> there were slain in the earthquake names of men</b> (i. e. men themselves, the expression shewing that the number is carefully and precisely stated, as if the name of each were recounted: see below)<b> seven thousands</b> (i. e. the number 7000, In every place of the 23 where the word “chilias” occurs in the New Test., it signifies simply the numeral 1000, and never a chiliad, or a province, as the historical interpretation, forcing the expression to mean the seven Dutch united provinces, which were lost to the Papacy at the Reformation. It also forces the expression<b> names of men</b> out of its idiomatic sense to import “titles of dignity and command,” Duchies, Marquisates, Lordships),<b> and the rest</b> (of the inhabitants of the city)<b> became terrified, and gave glory</b> (it would be entirely needless to contend that<b> gave</b> belongs to the same<i> subject</i> as<b> became terrified</b>, viz.<b> the rest</b>, had not an attempt been made to supply “the ascended witnesses” as a new subject. To say nothing of the inapplicability of the instances cited to justify such a view, our ch. xiv. 7 is decisive against it, where men are exhorted to “<i>fear God, and give Him glory:</i>” a also ch. xvi. 9, where the men tormented “<i>did not repent, to give Him glory</i>.” In fact,<i> the giving glory to God</i> is not equivalent in the Scriptures to<i> thanking God</i>, but is, as Bengel notices, “a mark of conversion or at all events, of the<i> recognition</i> of God. The exceptions to this are more apparent than real, e.g. Luke xvii. 18, where<i> recognition</i> is the main feature: Rev. iv. 9, where<i> glory</i> does not stand alone. See also 1 Sam. vi. 5. Josh. vii. 19 is a remarkable example of the ordinary meaning of the phrase)<b> to the God of heaven</b> (an expression otherwise confined to the later books of the Old Test.).
