<b>And the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were great voices in heaven</b> (notice, 2) that the seventh seal, the seventh trumpet, and the seventh vial, are all differently accompanied from any of the pre-ceding series in each case. b) At each seventh member of the series we hear what is done, not on earth, but in heaven,—the half-hour’s silence, the song of thanksgiving, the voice from the temple and the throne, saying, “It is done.” c) At each seventh member likewise we have it related in the form of a solemn conclusion, that thunders, and lightnings, and voices (and an earthquake, and a great hail) occurred: see ch. xvi. 18 ff. d) At each seventh member we have plain indication in the imagery or by direct expression, that the end is come, or close at hand: 1) by the imagery of the sixth seal, and the two episodes, preceding the seventh seal: 2) by the declaration here, “<i>the time of the dead is come to be judged</i>:” 3) by “<i>It is done,</i>” sounding from the temple and the throne on the pouring out of the seventh vial. e) All this forms strong ground for inference, that the three series of visions are not continuous, but resumptive: not indeed going over the same ground with one another, either of time or of occurrence, but each evolving something which was not in the former, and putting the course of God’s Providence in a different light. It is true, that the seals involve the trumpets, the trumpets the vials: but it is not in mere temporal succession: the involution and inclusion are far deeper world-wide vision of the seals containing the cry for vengeance, out of which is evolved the series of the trumpets: and this again containing the episodical visions of the little book and the witnesses, out of which are evolved the visions of ecclesiastical faithfulness and apostasy which follow)<b> saying</b> (whose these voices were, is not specified: but we may fairly assume them to have been those of the armies of heaven and the four living-beings, as distinguished from the twenty-four elders which follow),<b> The Kingdom over the world is become our Lord’s and of his Christ</b> (no supply, such as “<i>the Kingdom</i>,” is required. The genitive in both cases is one merely of possession),<b> and He</b> (no emphasis on He, as we are almost sure to lay on it, perhaps from the accent unavoidable in the Hallelujah Chorus of Handel)<b> shall reign to the ages of the ages</b> (this announcement necessarily belongs to the time close on the millennial reign: and this is no more than we might expect from the declaration of the strong angel in ch. x. 7).
