And the nations were angry</b> (the Septuagint translators begin Ps. xcviii. [our 99th] with these words: “<i>The Lord reigned, let the people be angry</i>”),<b> and Thine anger came, and the time of the dead, to be judged</b> (another indication that the end is at hand when these words are spoken),<b> and</b> [<b>the time</b>]<b> to give their reward to Thy servants the prophets</b> (see especially Matt. x. 41, to which reference seems to he made),<b> and to the saints, and to them that fear Thy name, the small and the great</b> (the three terms together include the whole church),<b> and to destroy the destroyers of the earth</b> (all this looks onward to judgments and acts of God yet to come when the words are spoken. The thanksgiving is not that God hath done all this, but that the hour is come for it all to take place. Before it does, another im-portant series of visions has to be unfolded).
