 19.]<i> Concluding, and transitional</i>.<b> And the temple of God was opened in the heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple</b> (the episode of ch. xi. 1 ff. began with measuring the temple of God, the shadow of things in the heavens: and now, when the time is come for the judgments there indicated to be fulfilled, that temple itself in the heavens is laid open. The ark of the Covenant is seen, the symbol of God’s faithfulness in bestowing grace on His people, and inflicting vengeance on His people’s enemies. This is evidently a solemn and befitting inauguration of God’s final judgments, as it is a conclusion of the series pointed out by the trumpets, which have been inflicted in answer to the prayers of His saints. It is from this temple that the judgments proceed forth [compare ch. xiv. 15, 17, xv. 3 ff., xvi. 17]; from His inmost and holiest place that those acts of vengeance are wrought which the great multitude in heaven recognize as faithful and true, ch. xix. 2. The symbolism of this verse, the<i> opening</i> for the first time of the heavenly temple, also indicates of what nature the succeeding visions are to be: that they will relate to God’s covenant people and His dealings with them):<b> and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and a great hail</b> (the solemn salvos, so to speak, of the artillery of heaven, with which each series of visions is concluded: see this commented on above, at the beginning of this section).
