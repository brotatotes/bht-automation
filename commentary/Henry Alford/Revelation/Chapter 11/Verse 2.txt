<b>And the court which is outside the temple</b> (i. e. apparently, every thing except the<b> temple</b> itself: not merely the outer court or court of the Gentiles. That only the temple itself, in the strictest sense, is to be measured, is significant for the meaning above maintained)<b> cast out</b> (of thy measurement. But these strong words, conveying so slight a meaning, doubtless bear in them a tinge also of the stronger meaning, “reckon as profane,” “account not as included in the sacred precinct”),<b> and measure not it</b> (it has a slight emphasis: otherwise, it need not have been expressed in the original),<b> because it was given</b> (viz. at the time when the state of things subsisting in the vision came in: or, in God’s apportionment)<b> to the Gentiles</b> (if the<i> temple</i> and the<i> worshippers</i> represent the elect church of the first-born, the nations will correspond to those who are outside this sacred enclosure: those over whom eventually the millennial reign of ch. xx. shall be exercised: those from among whom shall spring the enmity against God’s church, but among whom also shall be many who shall fear, and give God glory, compare ver. 13. Of these is formed the outward seeming church, mixed up with the world; in them, though not in each case commensurate with them, is Babylon, is the reign of the wild-beast, the agency of the false prophet: they are the<i> dwellers on the earth</i>, the material on which judgment and mercy are severally exercised in the rest of this book [see especially ver. 18], as contrasted with God’s own people, gathered and to be gathered out from among them),<b> and they shall tread down</b> (i. e. trample as conquerors, the outer church being in subjection to them: see Luke xxi. 24, Dan. viii. 13. The other meaning,<i> shall tread</i>, merely, is of course included; but must not be made the prevalent one. The period named shall be one during which “<i>the</i><i> kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and violent men take it by force</i>,” Matt. xi. 12)<b> the holy city</b> (Jerusalem, in the literal sense of the prophecy: the whole temple except the<i> temple proper</i>, or sanctuary itself, being counted with the city outside)<b> forty and two months</b> (this period occurs in three forms in this BOOk: 1) as forty-two mouths; see ch. xiii. 5: 2) as 1260 days = 42 months x 30, see ver. 3, ch. xii. 6: 3) as time, times, and half a time = 3 1/2 years = 3 x 360 + 180 = 1260, see ch, xii, 14. This latter designation is also found in Dan. vii. 25, xii. 7. With respect to these periods, I may say that,<i> equal</i> as they certainly seem to be, we have no right to sup-pose them, in any two given cases, to be<i> identical</i>, unless the context requires such supposition. For instance, in these two verses, 2 and 3, there is strong temptation to regard the two equal periods as coincident and identical: but it is plain that such a view is not required by the context; the prophecy contains no note of such coincidence, but may be very simply read without it, on the view that the two periods are equal in duration, but independent of one another: and the rather, that this prophecy, as has been already shewn, is of a compendious character, hereafter to be stated at large. I will further remark, and the reader will find this abundantly borne out by research into histories of apocalyptic exegesis, that no solution at all approaching to a satisfactory one has ever yet been given of any one of these periods. This being so, my principle is to regard them as being still among the things unknown to the Church, and awaiting their elucidation by the event. It is our duty to feel our way by all the indications which Scripture furnishes, and by the light which history, in its main and obvious salient events, has thrown on Scripture: and, when those fail us, to be content to confess our ignorance. An apocalyptic commentary which explains every thing, is self-convicted of error)
