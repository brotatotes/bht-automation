<b>and if any one be minded to harm them, fire goeth forth</b> (the present tense, used of that which is habitual and settled, though yet future: see also on ver. 7 below)<b> out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies</b> (so Elijah, 2 Kings i. 10 ff.: and so ran the word of promise to Jeremiah, Jer. v. 14, “<i>I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them</i>:” the two being here combined together. Compare also Ecclus. xlviii. 1, “<i>Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burned like a lamp</i>”):<b> and if any one be minded to harm them, after this manner</b> (see Ecclus. xlviii, 3, “<i>He three times brought down fire</i>”)<b> he must be killed</b> (this whole description is most difficult to apply, on the allegorical interpretation; as is that which follows. And as might have been expected, the allegorists halt and are perplexed exceedingly. The double announcement here seems to stamp the literal sense, and the words,<b> if any one,</b> and<b>, he must be killed</b>, are decisive against any mere<i> national</i> application of the words.<i> Individuality</i> could not be more strongly indicated).
