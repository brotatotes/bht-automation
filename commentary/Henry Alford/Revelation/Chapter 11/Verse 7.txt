<b>And when they have finished</b> (the tense used in the original implies, as plainly as words can imply it, that the whole period of their testimony will be at an end when that which is next said shall happen. All attempts of the allegorical expositors to escape this plain meaning of the words are in vain, Such is, “when they shall be about finishing: “whilst they shall perform;” “when they shall lave completed their testimony,” meaning thereby not the whole course of it, but any one complete delivery of it, which others might have followed)<b> their testimony, the wild-beast that cometh up out of the abyss</b> (this is the first mention of the wild-beast; and the whole description, as remarked above, is anticipatory. The present tense gives simply<i> designation</i>, as so often: and is not to be interpreted future, “that is to come up.” The<i> character</i> of the beast is that he cometh up out of the abyss. This wild-beast is evidently identical with that mentioned in ch, xvii. 8, of which the same term is used, “<i>which is about to come up out of the abyss</i>:” and if so, with that also which is introduced ch. xii 1 ff., as “<i>a wild-beast coming up out of the sea</i>,” seeing that the same details, of the seven heads and ten horns, are ascribed to the two. But, though the appellation is anticipatory as far us this book is concerned, the beast spoken of was already familiar to its readers from Dan. vii. 21: See below)<b> shall make war with them</b> (the very expression is from Dan. vii, 21),<b> and shall conquer them and shall kill them.
