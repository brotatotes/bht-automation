<b>And some from among the peoples and tribes and languages and nations look upon</b> (the prophetic history is carried on in the present, as in ch. xviii, 11 compared with ver. 9, and elsewhere)<b> their corpse</b> (see above)<b> three days and a half</b> (on this period we may remark, that these 3 ½ days are connected by analogy with the periods previously mentioned: with the 1260 days and 42 months = 3 years: and that in each case the half of the mystic number 7 enters. Also, that Elliott’s calculation of this period as 3 ½ years, by which he makes out that that period elapsed,<i> precisely, to a day</i>,” between the ninth session of the Lateran council, and the posting up of the theses by Luther at Wittenberg,—and on the accuracy of which he exclaims, “O wonderful prophecy!O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the foreknowledge of God!”—labours under this fatal defect;—that whereas his 3 years, from May 5, 1514, to May 5, 1517, are years of 365 days, his half-year, from May 5, 1517, to Oct. 31, of the same year, is “180, or half 360 days:” i.e. wanting 2 ½ days of the time required according to that reckoning. I may observe, that in his Apocalypsis Alfordiana, p. 128, he has<i> repeated this inconsistency</i>),<b> and do not permit their corpses to be put into a tomb</b> (the word in the original means not a<i> grave</i>, but a monument, or a tomb).
