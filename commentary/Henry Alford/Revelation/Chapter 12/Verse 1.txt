<b>And a great</b> (important in its meaning, as well as vast in its appearance)<b> sign</b> (one of those appearances by which God signified to John the revelations of this book, ch. i. 1)<b> was seen in heaven</b> (heaven here is manifestly not only the show-place of the visions as seen by the Seer, but has a substantial place in the vision: for below, ver. 7 ff., we have the heaven contrasted with the earth, and the dragon cast out of heaven into the earth.<b> See more there</b>],<b> a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon beneath her feet</b> (see Cant. vi. 10, which seems to be borne in mind),<b> and on her head a crown of twelve stars</b> (the whole symbolism points to the Church, the bride of God: and of course, from the circumstances afterwards related, the Old Test. church, at least at this beginning of the vision. That the blessed Virgin cannot be intended, is plain from the subsequent details, and was recognized by the early expositors. The crown of twelve stars represents the Patriarchs. Victorinus interprets the woman as the ancient church, and the twelve stars as above),<b> and [she is] (or, being) with child [and] crieth out in pangs and tormented to bring forth. And another sign was seen in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon</b> (interpreted below, ver. 9, to be the devil, the ancient serpent: see also vv. 13, 15. He is<b> red</b> perhaps for the combined reasons, of the wasting properties of fire, and the redness of blood: see John viii. 44)<b>, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems</b> (the Dragon being the devil, these symbolic features must be interpreted of the assuming by him of some of those details in the form of the beast in ch. xiii. 1 ff., to whom afterwards he gives his power and his throne: in other words, as indicating that he lays wait for the woman’s offspring in the form of that antichristian power which is afterwards represented by the beast. At the same time, the<i> seven crowned heads</i> may possess an appropriateness of their own, belonging as they do to the dragon alone [the beast has the crowns on his<i> horns</i>, ch. xiii. 1]. They may represent, as he is Prince of this world, universality of earthly dominion. The ten horns belong to the fourth beast of Daniel, vii. 7, 20).<b> And his tail draggeth down the third part of the stars of the heaven, and cast them to the earth</b> (so the little horn in Dan. viii. 10, “cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.” The allusion here may be to the devil having persuaded and drawn down to perdition the rebel angels. The magnitude and fury of the dragon are graphically given by the fact of its tail, in its lashing backwards and forwards in fury, sweeping down the stars of heaven).<b> And the dragon standeth</b> (not<i> “stood.”</i> Pliny describes the<i> dragon</i> as not prone and gliding like a serpent, but walking lofty and erect)<b> before the woman which is about to bear, that when she hath borne he may devour her child</b> (this was what the devil instigated Herod the Great to do, who was the dependant of the Roman Empire. But doubtless the reference is wider than this: even to the whole course of hostility against the Lord during His humiliation: see below).<b> And she bore a male son, who shall rule</b> (literally, shepherd, i.e. order and guide)<b> all the nations with a rod of iron</b> (these words, cited verbatim from the Septuagint version of the Messianic Psalm ii., leave no possibility of doubt, who is here intended. ‘The man child is the Lord Jesus Christ,<i> and none other.</i> And this result is a most important one for the fixity of reference of the whole prophecy. It forms one of those landmarks by which the legitimacy of various interpretations may be tested; and of which we may say, notwithstanding the contradiction sure to be given to the saying, that every interpretation which oversteps their measure is thereby convicted of error. Again, the exigencies of this passage require that the birth should be understood literally and historically, of that Birth of which all Christians know. And be it observed, that this rule of interpretation is no confident assertion of mine, as has been represented, but a result from the identifying use of words of the prophetic Scripture, spoken of Him who will not suffer His honour to be given to another):<b> and her child was caught up to God and to his throne</b> (i. e. after a conflict with the Prince of this world, who came and tried Him but found nothing in Him, the Son of the woman was taken up to heaven and sat on the right hand of God. Words can hardly be plainer than these. It surely is but needful to set against them, thus understood, the interpretation which would regard them as fulfilled by the “mighty issue of the consummated birth of a son of the church, a baptized emperor, to political supremacy in the Roman empire,” “united with the solemn public profession of the divinity of the Son of man”).<b> And the ‘woman fied into the wilderness, where she hath there</b> (so literally)<b> a place prepared from</b> (so literally: the source of the preparation being His command)<b> God, that they</b><br><br> (the subject to the verb is left indefinite. In ver. 14 below, it is simply passive, where she<i> is nourished</i>)<b> may nourish her there for a thousand two hundred and sixty days</b> (the whole of this verse is anticipatory: the same incident being repeated with its details and in its own place in the order of the narrative below, vv. 13 ff. See there the comment and interpretation. The fact of its being here inserted by anticipation is very instructive as to that which now next follows, as not being consecutive in time after the flight of the woman, but occurring before it, and in fact referred to now in the prophecy as leading to that pursuit of the woman by the dragon, which led to it).
