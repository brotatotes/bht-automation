<b> 7</b> ff.]<b> And there was war in heaven</b> (we now enter upon a mysterious series of events in the world of spirits, with regard to which merely fragmentary hints are given us in the Scriptures. In the Old Test. we find the adversary Satan in heaven. In Job i., ii., he appears before God as the Tempter of His saints: in Zech. iii, we have him accusing Joshua the high priest in God’s presence. Again our Lord in Luke x. 18 exclaims, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven,” where see note. Compare also John xii. 31. So that this casting down of Satan from the office of accuser in heaven was evidently connected with the great justifying work of redemption. His voice is heard before God no more: the day of acceptance in Christ Jesus has dawned. And his angels, those rebel spirits whom he led away, are cast down with him, into the earth, where now the conflict is waging during the short time which shall elapse between the Ascension and the second Advent, when he shall be bound. All this harmonizes together: and though we know no more of the matter, we have at least this sign that our knowedge, as far as it goes, is sound,—that the few hints given us do not, when thus interpreted, contradict one another, but agree as portions of one whole.<br><br> The war here spoken of appears in some of its features in the book of Daniel, ch. x. 13, 21, xii. 1. In Jude 9 also, we find Michael the adversary of the devil in the matter of the saints of God):<b> Michael</b> ( “one of the chief princes,” Dan. x. 13: “your prince,” i. e of the Jewish nation, ib, ver. 21: “the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people,” ib. xii. 1: “the archangel,” Jude 9: not to be identified with Christ, any more than any other of the great angels in this book. Such identification here would confuse hopelessly the actors in this heavenly scene. Satan’s being cast out of heaven to the earth is the result, not of his contest with the Lord Himself, of which it is only an incident leading to a new phase, but of the appointed conflict with his faithful fellow-angels led on by the archangel Michael. The expression,<i> his angels</i>, in both cases requires a nearer correspondence in the two chiefs than is found between Satan and the Son of God)<b> and his angels to war with the dragon, and the dragon warred and his angels, and</b> [<b>they</b>] (or,<i> he</i>: the reading is doubtful)<b> prevailed not, nor was even</b> (this brings in a climax)<b> their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent</b> (in allusion to the history in Gen. iii. Remember also that St. John had related the saying of our Lord, that the devil was<i> a murderer</i><b> from the beginning,</b>” the cognate term in the original to<b> ancient</b> here),<b> he who is called the devil and Satan, he who deceiveth the whole</b> [<b>inhabited</b>]<b> world, was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast with him</b> (I would appeal, in passing, to the solemnity of the terms here used, and the particularity of the designation, and ask whether it is possible to understand this of the mere casting down of paganism from the throne of the Roman empire? whether the words themselves do not vindicate their plain literal sense, as further illustrated by the song of rejoicing which follows?).<b> And I heard a great voice in heaven</b> (proceeding appa-rently from the elders, representing the church [compare our<i> brethren</i> below]: but it is left uncertain)<b> saying, Now is come the salvation and the might and the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ</b> (i. e. the realization of all these:<i> the salvation of our God</i> being, as so often, that salvation which belongs to God as its Author: see Luke iii, 6):<b> because the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accuseth</b> (the present participle implies the usual habit, though that his office was now at an end)<b> them before our God by day and by night. And they</b><b> conquered him on account of the blood of the Lamb</b> (i. e. by virtue of that blood having been shed: not as in A.V., “<i>by</i> the blood,” which is an ungrammatical rendering. The meaning is far more significant; their victory over Satan was grounded in, was a consequence of, His having shed his precious blood: without that, the adversary’s charges against them would have been unanswerable. It is remarkable, that the rabbinical books give a tradition that Satan accuses men all the days of the year,<i> except on the Day of Atonement</i>)<b> and on account of the word of their testimony</b> (the strict sense of the preposition must again be kept. It is<i> because</i> they have given a faithful testimony, even unto death, that they are victorious: this is<i> their</i> part, their appropriation of and standing in the virtue of that blood of the Lamb. Without both these, victory would not have been theirs: both together form its ground):<b> and they loved not their life unto death</b> (i. e. they carried their not-love of their life even unto death).<b> For this cause</b> (viz. because the dragon is cast down: as is shewn by the contrast below)<b> rejoice, ye heavens and they that dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil is come down to you</b> (the earth and sea)<b> having great wrath</b> (the enmity, which was manifested as his natural state towards Christ, ver. 4, being now kindled into wrath),<b> because he knoweth that he hath but a short season</b> (i. e. because the Lord cometh quickly, and then the period of his active hostility against the church and the race whom Christ has redeemed will be at an end: he will be bound and cast into the pit. Until then, he is carrying it on, in ways which the prophecy goes on to detail).<b> And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the male child</b> (the narrative at ver. 6 is again taken up and given more in detail. There, the reason of the woman’s flight is matter of inference: here, it is plainly expressed, and the manner of the flight also is related).<b> And there were given</b> (in the usual apocalyptic sense, i.e. granted by God for His purposes)<b> to the woman</b> [<b>the</b>]<b> two wings of the great eagle</b> (the figure is taken from Old Test. expressions used by God in reference to the flight of Israel from Egypt. The most remarkable of these is in Exod. xix. 4, “I bare you on eagle’s wings, and brought you unto myself” So also Deuteronomy in the reff. But the articles are not to be taken as identifying the eagle with the figure used in those places, which would be most unnatural: much less must they be supposed to identify this eagle with that in ch. viii. 13, with which it has no connexion. The articles are simply generic.
