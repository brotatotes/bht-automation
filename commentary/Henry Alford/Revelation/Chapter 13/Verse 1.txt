The ten horns are found also in the fourth beast of Daniel, vii. 7)<b> and seven heads, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy</b> (whether we read singular, or, as some MSS., plural, the meaning will be the same—on each head a name. The heads are [see for the interpretation ch. xvii. 9, 10, where it is given by the angel] Kings, in the widest acceptation of the word; Kings, as representing their kingdoms; not necessarily individual Kings (see as above):—the name or names of blasphemy, the divine titles given to those Kings, “Lord of the whole earth,” and the like: in the Roman form, “Deus” or “Divus.” Hereafter, when the great harlot succeeds to the character and symbolic details of the beast, this is carried yet further).
