<b>If any one is for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any to be slain with the sword</b> (i. e. it is necessary that, as the other reading supplies),<b> he must be slain with the sword</b> (so Jer. xv, 2, “Such as are for death, to death and such as are for the sword, to the sword: and such as are for the famine, to the famine: and such as are for captivity, to captivity:” compare also Jer. xiii. 11 and Zech. xi. 9. As that was the order and process of God’s anger in his judgments on his people of old, so shall the issue be with the saints in the war of persecution which the beast shall wage with them).<b> Here is</b> (viz. in the endurance of these persecutions)<b> the endurance and the faith of the saints.</b>
