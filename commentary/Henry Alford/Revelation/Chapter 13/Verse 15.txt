<b>And it was given to him to give breath</b> (or, spirit; by inference, life)<b> to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should even speak, and should cause that as many as do not worship the image of the beast should be slain.</b> The Seer is now describing facts which history substantiates to us in their literal fulfilment. ‘The image of Cæsar was every where that which men were made to worship: it was before this that the Christian martyrs were brought to the test, and put to death if they refused the act of adoration. ‘The words of Pliny’s letter to Trajan are express on the point: “When they called on the gods at my dictation, and offered incense and wine to thine image (which for this purpose I had ordered to be brought with those of the gods), and besides cursed Christ, which it is said that no true Christian can be compelled to do, I thought fit to dismiss them.” Above he had said, “those who persevered [in their Christianity] I ordered to be led to execution.” And if it be said as an objection to this, that it is not an image of the Emperor but of the beast itself which is spoken of, the answer is very simple, that as the Evangelist himself, in ch. xvii. 11, does not hesitate to identify one of the<i> seven kings</i> with the beast itself, so we may fairly assume that the image of the beast for the time being would be the image of the reigning Emperor. It is not so easy to assign a meaning to the giving<i> life and speech</i> to the image of the beast. Victorinus gives a curious explanation: “he shall also cause that a golden image to Antichrist shall be erected in the temple at Jerusalem, and a fallen angel shall enter and thence utter voices and give oracles.” The allusion probably is to some lying wonders permitted to the Pagan priests to try the faith of God’s people. We cannot help, as we read, thinking of the moving images, and winking and speaking pictures, so often employed for purposes of imposture by their far less excusable Papal successors.
