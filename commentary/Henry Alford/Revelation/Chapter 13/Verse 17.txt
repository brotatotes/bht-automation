<b>and that no one should be able to buy or to sell, except he who has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name</b> (either in the name stamped in letters, or in the number of the name thus stamped, i.e. the number which those letters make when added together according to their numerical value. ‘The practice of thus calculating the numerical value of the letters in names was widely prevalent: see the instances collected by Mr. Elliott, vol. iii. pp. 220 ff.: and more below. ‘This particular in the prophetic description seems to point to the commercial and spiritual interdiets which have, both by Pagan and by Papal persecutors, been laid on non-conformity: from even before the interdict of Diocletian, through those of the middle ages [both which ran in nearly these very terms], down to the last remaining civil disabilities imposed on non-conformity in modern Papal or Protestant countries. For these last have their share in the enormities of the first and second beasts, in as far as they adopt or continue their practices. With regard to the circumstance of the imposition of the mark, I conceive that with the latitude here given, viz., that it may be the name or the number, and having regard to the analogy of the mark inscribed on the saints (ch. xiii, 1: compare ch. vii. 1 ff.], we need not be anxious to find other than a general and figurative interpretation. As it is clear that in the case of the servants of God no actual visible mark is intended, so it may well be inferred here that the mark signifies rather conformity and addiction to the behests of the beast, than any actual stigma impressed. Certainly we fail to recognize any adequate exposition of such stigma in the sign of the Cross as propounded by Mr. Elliott [iii, 236], or in the monogram on the labarum as succeeded by the Papal cross-keys, of Dr. Wordsworth [Apocalypse, Appendix G]).
