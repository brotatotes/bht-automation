<b>Here is wisdom</b> (these words serve to direct attention to the challenge which follows: see ver. 10 and ch. xiv. 12, where here is similarly used):<b> let him who hath understanding calculate the number of the beast</b> (the terms of the challenge serve at once to shew that the feat proposed is possible, and that it is difficult. Irenaeus’s view, that if St. John had meant the number to be known he would have declared it, and that of Andreas, “time shall seems to me, excluded by these considerations. The number may be calculated: and is<i> intended to be known</i>):<b> for</b> (gives a reason why the calculation may be made)<b> it is the number of a man</b> (i. e. is counted as men generally count: not, as Bede and others, the number belonging to an individual man)<b> and the number of it</b> (the beast)<b> is six hundred sixty-six</b> (of all the hundreds of attempts which have been made in answer to the challenge, there is but one which seems to approach near enough to an adequate solution to require serious consideration. And that one is the word mentioned, though not adopted, by Irenæus, lateinos, the Greek letters of which, by their numerical power, make up the required number. This name describes the common character of the rulers of the former Pagan Roman Empire, for, says Irenæus, “<i>they are Latins who now rule</i>,” and, which Irenæus could not foresee, unites under itself the character of the latter Papal Roman Empire also, as revived and kept up by the agency of its false prophet the priesthood. The Latin Empire, the Latin Church, Latin Christianity, have ever been its commonly current appellations: its language, civil and ecclesiastical, has ever been Latin: its public services, in defiance of the most obvious requisite for public worship, have ever been throughout the world conducted in Latin: there is no one word which could so completely describe its character, and at the same time unite the ancient and modern attributes of the two beasts, as this, Short of saying absolutely that this<i> was</i> the word in St. John’s mind, I have the strongest persuasion that no other can be found approaching so near to a complete solution, See however the remarks on this subject in the Introduction,§v. par. 32, where I have after all thought it best to leave the matter in doubt).
