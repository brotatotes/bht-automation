and worshipped the dragon, because he gave the</b> (or,<i> his</i>)<b> power to the beast, and worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like to the beast?</b><b> And who is able to war with him</b> (these words are a sort of parody, in their blasphemy, on ascriptions of praise to God: compare Exod. xv. 11; Ps. xxxv. 10; lxxi. 19; cxii. 5; Isa. xl. 18, 25 xlvi. 5; Jer. xxix. 20 [xlix, 19]; Micah vii. 18: they represent to us the relapse into all the substantial blasphemies of paganism under the resuscitated Empire of Rome, and the retention of pagan titles and forms. I may remark, that nothing in those words finds any representative in the history of the times of the Pagan Empire)?
