<b>And I saw, and behold the Lamb</b> (viz, the same which before was seen in the midst of the throne, ch. v. 6 al.)<b> standing upon the mount Sion</b> (as in ch. xi., the holy city is introduced as the seat of God’s true church and worship, so by a similar figure [not the same, for thus Mount Sion would be outside the temple proper, and given to the Gentiles] the holy mountain Sion is now chosen for the site of the display of God’s chosen ones with Christ, the Son of David, whose city Zion was),<b> and with Him an hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father</b> (observe the tacit assumption that all understand Who is imported by the Lamb)<b> written on their foreheads</b> (first observe the contrast: the nations of the earth, constrained to receive the mark of the beast on their forehead and hand, and the Lambs elect, marked with His name and that of His Father. The question next meets us, Are these 144, 000 identical with the same number in ch. vii, 4? The presumption certainly is that the same number occurring here, representing as there the elect and first-fruits of the church, here as there also inscribed on their foreheads with the seal of God in the one case, and His Name in the other, must be descriptive of the same body of persons. And this view, if acquiesced in here, will reflect back considerable light on that former vision of the sealing in ch. vii, ‘Those, as these, will represent the first-fruits or choice ones among God’s people, as indeed we have treated them in this commentary, and not the totality of those who shall form the great multitude which no man can number, These, as those, are taken to represent the people of God: their introduction serves to place before us the church on the holy hill of Zion, where God has placed His King, as an introduction to the description of her agency in preaching the everlasting Gospel, and her faithfulness amidst persecutions).
