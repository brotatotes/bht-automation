<b>And I heard a voice out of heaven</b> (whose, is not told us, and it is in vain to speculate: certainly not, as Hengstenberg, from the spirits of the just themselves. The command,<b> write</b>, would rather point to the angel who reveals the visions to the Evangelist, ch. i. 1, and compare ch. iv. 4),<b> saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth</b> (the connexion is not difficult. The mention of the endurance of the saints brings with it the certainty of persecution unto death. ‘The present proclamation declares the blessedness of all who die not only in persecution, but in any manner, in the Lord, in the faith and obedience of Christ And the special command to write this, conveys special comfort to those in all ages of the church who should read it. But it is not so easy to assign a fit meaning to<b> from henceforth</b>. Being thus joined with the former sentence, it must express some reason why this blessedness is to be more completely realized from this time when it is proclaimed, than it was before. Now this reason will quickly appear, if we consider the particular time, in connexion with which the proclamation is made. The harvest of the earth is about to be reaped; the vintage of the earth to be gathered. At this time it is, that the complete blessedness of the holy dead commences: when the garner is filled and the chaff cast out. And that not on account of their deliverance from any purgatorial fire, but because of the completion of this number of their brethren, and the full capacities of bliss brought in by the resurrection. Nor can it legitimately be objected to this, that the deaths implied must follow after the proclamation, For no doubt this would be so, the proclamation itself being anticipatory, and the harvest not yet actually come).<b> Yea, saith the Spirit</b> (the utterance of the voice from heaven still continues. The affirmation of the Spirit ratifies the blessedness proclaimed, and assigns a reason for it),<b> that they shall</b> (so literally)<b> rest from their labours: for their works follow with them</b> (<b>for</b>, which has seemed so difficult, and which apparently gave rise to the alteration in the text, is in fact easily explained. ‘They<i> rest</i> from their labours, because the time of working is over, their works accompanying them not in a life of activity, but in blessed memory; wherefore not labour, but rest is their lot).
