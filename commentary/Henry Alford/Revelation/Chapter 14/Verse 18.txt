And another angel came out from the altar</b> (viz. that elsewhere several times mentioned, ch. vi. 9, viii. 8, xvi. 7, in connexion with the fulfilment of God’s judgments in answer to the prayers of His saints),<b> he that hath power over the fire</b> (viz. that on the altars the same angel who is introduced ch, viii. 3–5 as presenting the prayers of the saints, and casting some of the fire of the altar to the earth as introductory to the judgements of the trumpets),<b> and he cried with a great cry to him that had the sharp sickle</b> (it is to be observed that the whole description of this angel, coming from the altar of vengeance, differs widely from any thing in the former part of the vision, and favours the idea that this vintage is of a different nature from that harvest),<b> saying, Put forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the the bunches of the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.
