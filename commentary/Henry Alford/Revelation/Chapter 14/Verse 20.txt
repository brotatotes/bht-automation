The blood coming forth from the treading of the winepress is in accordance with the Old Test. prophecy alluded to, Isa. Ixiii, 3. It is in the depth, and the distance indicated, that the principal difficulty lies. The number of stadii (or furlongs) is supposed by some to be the length of the Holy Land, as given by Jerome at 160 Roman miles. But the great objection to this is, that 160 miles = 1280, not 1600 stadii. Another view has been, that 1600 has been chosen as a square number, = 40 x 40, or 4 x 400, or 4 x 4 x 100. We may fairly say, either that the number is assigned simply to signify completeness and magnitude [in which case some other apocalyptic numbers which have been much insisted on will fall perhaps under the same canon of interpretation], or else this is one of the riddles of the Apocalypse to which not even a proximate solution has ever yet been given).<br><br> CH.
