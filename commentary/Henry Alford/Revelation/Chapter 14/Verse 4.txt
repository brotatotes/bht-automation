<b>These are they who were not</b> (the past tense shews that their course is ended and looked back on as a thing past: and serves to confute all interpretations which regard them as representing saints while in the midst of their earthly conflict and trial)<b> defiled with women</b> (see below);<b> for they are</b> (always were and have kept themselves till the time present)<b> virgins</b> (there are two ways of understanding these words. Either they may be figurative, merely implying that these pure ones lived in all chastity, whether in single or in married life, and incurred no pollution [2 Cor. xi 2]: or they may be meant literally, that these purest ones had lived in that state of which St. Paul says, 1 Cor. vii. 1,<i> it is good for a man</i>. And as between these two meanings I conceive that the emphatic position of the words<b> with women</b> in the original goes some way to decide. It is not the fact of impurity in allowed intercourse, but the fact of commerce with women that is put forward. I would therefore believe that in the description of these who are the first-fruits from the earth, the feature of virginity is to be taken in its literal meaning. Nor need any difficulty be found in this. It is on all hands granted that he who is married in the Lord enters into holy relations of which the single have no experience, and goes through blessed and elevating degrees of self-sacrifice, and loving allowance, and preferring others before himself, And as every step of grace assured is a step of glory secured, there is no doubt that the holy married servants of God shall have a peculiar entrance into the fulness of that future Kingdom’s employ, which will not be the lot of the single: seeing that in this matter also, the childhood of this state will be the father of the manhood of that one. But neither on the other hand can it be denied that the state of holy virginity has also its peculiar blessings and exemptions. Of these, the Apostle himself speaks of that absence of distraction from the Lord's work, which is apt to beset the married, busy as they are with the cares of a household and with pleasing one another. And another and primary blessing is, that in them that fountain of carnal desire has never been opened, which is so apt to be a channel for unholy thoughts and an access for the tempter. ‘The virgins may thus have missed the victory over the lusts of the flesh: but they have also in great part escaped the conflict. Theirs is not the triumph of the toil-worn and stained soldier, but the calm and the unspottedness of those who have kept from the strife. We are perhaps more like that which the Lord intended us to be: but they are more like the Lord Himself. And if He is to have round Him a peculiar and closer band, standing with Him on Mount Sion, none will surely grudge this place to those who were not defiled with women. Among these will be not only those who have lived and served Him in holy virginity, but also the dear children whom He has claimed from us for Himself, the youths and maidens who were gathered to His side before the strife began: before their tongues had learned the language of social falsehood, or their good names been tarnished with the breath of inevitable calumny. There is one meaning which these words will not bear, and which it is surprising that any Commentator should ever have attached to them: viz. that<b> with women</b> refers to the woman mentioned below, ch. xvii. So Dr. Wordsworth, p. 284: “They have not been defiled with women, What women? It may be asked. If we proceed, we read of the woman seated on the Beast, and of the harlotry of the woman, with whom the Kings of the earth commit fornication. And soon we see her displayed in all her meretricious splendour. There then is the reply.” But the whole context here, as well as the language used, is against it: the following words,<b> for they are virgins</b>, carrying its decisive condemnation).<b> These [are] they that follow the Lamb wheresoever he goeth</b> (the description has very commonly been taken as applying to the entire obedience of the elect, following their Lord to prison and to death, and wherever He may call them: but this exposition is surely out of place here, where not their life of conflict, but their state of glory is described, The words are used of special privilege of nearness to the Person of the Lamb in glory).<b> ‘These were purchased from men as a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb</b> (all have been thus purchased: but these specially, as and for the purpose of being a first-fruit. James i. 18 treats of a different matter, the purchased of all the redeemed as the first-fruits of creation. But these are a first-fruit among the purchased themselves).
