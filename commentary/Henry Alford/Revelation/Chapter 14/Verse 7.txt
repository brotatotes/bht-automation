<b>saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give Him glory</b> (the message of repentance ever accompanies the hearing of the Gospel among the nations; compare the first. preaching of our Lord and of His Forerunner, Matt. iv. 17, iii. 2, and St. Paul’s message to the Thessalonians, 1 Thess. i. 9),<b> because the season of His judgment is come</b> (see the citation from Matt. xxiv. above: the time of the end is close at hand when this great era of Christian missions is inaugurated: see below):<b> and worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters</b> (i. e. turning from idols and vanities to serve the living and true God. The division of the waters into the sea and the fountains is one kept up through this prophecy: compare ch. viii, 8–11, xvi. 3, 4).
