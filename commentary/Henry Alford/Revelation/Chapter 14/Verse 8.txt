The whole is from Jer. li. 7, 8, where Babylon is a cup in the Lord’s hand of which the nations are made to drink. This is the first mention of Babylon, hereafter to be so much spoken of, I reserve treatment of the interpretation till ch. xvii.: only mentioning by anticipation that Rome, pagan and papal, but principally papal, is intended).
