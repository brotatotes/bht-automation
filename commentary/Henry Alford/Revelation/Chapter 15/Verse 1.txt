<b>And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues which are the last [plagues], because in them is com-pleted the wrath of God</b> (I have adopted an unusual arrangement to throw the word<b> because</b> into connexion with<b> the last</b>, for which epithet it renders a reason. It is to be observed 1) that this verse is evidently only a compendious description of the following vision: for the angels themselves are not seen till ver. 6, and do not receive the vials containing the plagues till after they are seen: 2) that the whole of Godâ€™s wrath in<i> final judgment</i> is not exhausted by these vials, but only the whole of His wrath in sending plagues on the earth<i> previous to the judgment</i>. After these there are no more plagues: they are concluded with the destruction of Babylon. Then the Lord Himself appears, ch. xix. 11 ff).
