</b><b>And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon</b> (who is still in the prophetic scene, giving his power to the beast, ch. 2)<b> and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet</b> (viz. the second beast of ch. xiii, 11 ff. Compare ch. xix, 20, xx. 10)<b> three unclean spirits like frogs</b> (in shape and character. In the entire absence of Scripture symbolism,—for the only mention of frogs besides this is in, or in regard to, the relation of the plague in Egypt,—we can only explain the similitude from the uncleanness, and the pertinacious noise, of the frog),<b> for</b> (gives a reason for their being like frogs)<b> they are spirits of demons doing miracles</b> (this is a plain declaration of the interpretation of these three, and by it the limits of interpretation are clearly set, and must not be overpassed. The explanation of these as men, or sects of men, is therefore clearly wrong)<b> which go forth over the Kings of the whole earth</b> (it is the uniform testimony of the prophetic Scriptures, that the antichristian power shall work signs and wonders as means of deceiving man-kind: see Matt. xxiv. 24; 2 Thess. ii. 9)<b> to gather them together to the war of that great day of Almighty God</b> (that day viz. which is explained in detail in the subsequent part of the prophecy, ch. xix. 17 ff. This great gathering of the beast and the kings of the earth against God and the Lamb, is the signal for the immediate and glorious appearing of the Lord. And therefore follows an exhortation to be ready, and clad in the garments of righteousness, when He shall come).
