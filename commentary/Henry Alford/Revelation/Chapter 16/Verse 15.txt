<b>Behold, I come</b> (the Seer speaks in the name of Christ)<b> as a thief</b> (that personal advent shall happen when many least expect when the world is secure in the ungodliness of ages):<b> blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked and they</b> (men)<b> see his shame</b> (the figure is that of one apprehending the thiefâ€™s coming, and therefore keeping watch in his clothes, not undressing. In the spiritual sense, the garments are the robe of righteousness put on by faith in Him who is our Righteousness: and the walking naked is that destitution of these garments which will at that day bring shame before assembled men and angels).
