<b>And they</b> (the unclean spirits, as is evident from<b> gathered them</b> being merely a recital of the purpose,<i> to gather them</i>, announced in ver. 14: not, the angel of the sixth vial, as Bengel; nor God, as Hengstenberg and Ebrard)<b> collected them together to the place which is called in Hebrew Har-magedon</b> (it is evidently in the meaning of the Hebrew name of this place that its appropriate significance lies. For otherwise why should in Hebrew be prefixed to it? When St. John does this in his Gospel, in the cases of Bethesda, v. 2, Gabbatha, xix. 13, Golgotha, xix. 17, and in this book in the case of Abaddon, ix. 11, it is each time not without such reference: see the notes in those places. But this circumstance does not deprive the name of geographical reality: and it is most probable on every account that such reality exists here. The words<b> the place which is called</b> would surely not be used except of a real place habitually so named, or by a name very like this, Nor need we search far for the place pointed out. Harmagiddo, the ‘mountain of Megiddo,’ designates at least the neighbourhood where the Canaanitish Kings were overthrown by Barak, Judg. v. 19: an occasion which gave rise to one of the two triumphal songs of Israel recorded in the Old ‘Test., and therefore one well worthy of symbolizing the great final overthrow of the Kings of the Earth leagued against Christ. That a name slightly differs from that given in the Old Test. where it is the plain [2 Chron. xxxv. 22] or the waters (Judges, as above] of Megiddo, is of slight consequence, and may be owing to a reason which I shall dwell on below, The Septuagint in both places adopts the form which we have here, Megiddo or-eddo. Nor must it be forgotten, that Megiddo was connected with another overthrow and slaughter, viz. that of Josiah by Pharaoh-Necho [2 Kings xxiii. 29; 2 Chron. as above], which though not analogous to this predicted battle in its issue, yet served to keep up the character of the place as one of overthrow and calamity: compare also Zech. xii. 11, and the striking description, 2 Chron. xxxv. 25, of the ordinance of lamentation for Josiah. At Megiddo also another Jewish King, Ahaziah, died of the wounds received from Jehu, 2 Kings ix. 27, The prefix Har, signifying “mountain,” has its local propriety: see Stanley’s description of the plain of Esdraelon, in the opening of his Sinai and Palestine, ch. ix. And to the fisherman of the lake of Galilee, who would know Megiddo, as he saw its background of highland lit up by the morning or evening sun across the plain from his native hills, the name would doubtless be a familiar one. Still there may have been a deeper reason which led to, or at all events justified the prefix. As the name now stands, it has a meaning ominous of the great overthrow which is to take place on the spot).
