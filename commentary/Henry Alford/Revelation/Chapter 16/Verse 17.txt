<b>And the seventh poured out his vial upon the air</b> (the consequences are presently seen),<b> and there came forth a voice out of the temple from the throne</b> (the voice, as in ver. 1, of God himself. This is rendered even more certain here by the addition of from the throne),<b> saying, It is done</b> (the limitation of the meaning to “that is done which was commanded,” viz. the outpouring of the seven vials, is in fact no limitation; for the plagues are the<i> last</i> plagues: if therefore they are done, all is done. But the declaration is of course made in anticipation, and imports that the outpouring of the seventh vial had done that which should accomplish all and bring in the end. One who had fired a train would say, “It is done,” though the explosion had not yet taken place).
