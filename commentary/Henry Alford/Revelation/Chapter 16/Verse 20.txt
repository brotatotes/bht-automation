<b>and every island fled</b> (the effects of the earthquake are resumed, the mention of Babylon coming into remembrance being parenthetical, and suggested by the great city having been split into three parts. On the sense, as belonging to the imagery of the Great Day, see ch. vi. 14),<b> and there were found no mountains</b> (not as A. V,, “the mountains were not found,” The expression is far stronger than this: amounting to that in ch, vi. 14, that every mountain was removed out of its place and was looked for in vain),<b> and a great hail</b> (see reff. Egypt is again in view)<b> as of a talent in weight</b> (i. e. having each hail stone of that weight. Diodorus Siculus speaks of hailstones of a mina each in weight as being enormous: and the talent contained<i> sixty</i> minæ. Josephus speaks of the stones which were thrown from the machines in the siege of Jerusalem as each of a talent weight)<b> descendeth from heaven on men: and men blasphemed God by reason of the plague of the hail, because great is the plague of it exceedingly</b> (i. e. mankind in general,—not those who were struck by the hailstones, who would instantly die,—so far from repenting at this great and final judgment of God, blasphemed him and were impenitent. The issue is different from that in ch, xi, 13, where the remnant feared, and gave glory to God).
