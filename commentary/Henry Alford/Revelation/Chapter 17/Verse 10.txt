<b>and they are seven Kings</b> (let us weigh well the significance of this indication furnished by the angel. The seven hends have a reference to the woman, who sits upon the beast to whom they belong: and, as far as<i> this reference</i> is concerned, they are<i> hills, on which she sits</i>. But they have also another reference—to the beast, of which they are the heads: and as far as this other reference is concerned, they are<i> kings</i>. Not, be it noticed, kings over the woman, nor kings of the city symbolized by her: but kings in a totally different relation, viz. that to the beast of which they are heads, So that to interpret these kings as<i> emperors of Rome</i>, or as successive<i> forms of government over Rome</i>, is to miss the propriety of the symbolism and to introduce utter confusion. They belong to the<i> beast</i>, which is not Rome, nor the Roman Empire, but a general symbol of secular antichristian power. They are in substance the same seven crowned heads which we saw on the dragon in ch. xii, 3: the same which we saw, with names of blasphemy on them, on the beast of ch. xiii. 1, to whom the dragon gave his power and his throne).<b> The five</b> (i. e. the first five out of the seven)<b> fell</b> (in English idiom, “are fallen.” Of whom is this word used? Is it one likely to be chosen to describe the mere passing away of king after king in an empire more or less settled? One appropriate to Augustus and Tiberius, who died in their beds? Or again is it one which could well be predicated of the government by consuls, which had been absorbed into the imperial power, or of that by dictators, which had merely ceased to be temporarily adopted, because it had become perpetual in the person of one man? Had Roman emperors been meant by the seven kings, or successive stages of government over Rome [even supposing these last made out, which they never have been], we should in vain have sought any precedent, or any appropriate meaning, for this term,<b> have fallen</b>: “have passed away” would be its constrained and unexampled sense. But let the analogy of Scripture and of this book itself guide us, and our way will be clear enough. “<i>Is fallen, is fallen</i>,” is the cry over Babylon herself. The verb is used in the Septuagint constantly, of the violent fall, the overthrow, either of kings or of kingdoms: it is a word belonging to domination overthrown, to glory ruined, to empire superseded. If I understand these five of individual successive kings, if I understand them of forms of government adopted and laid down on occasion, I can give no account of this verb but if I understand them of forms of empire, one after another heading the anti-christian secular power, one after another violently overthrown and done away, I have this verb in its right place and appropriate sense.<i> Egypt</i> is fallen, the first head of the beast that persecuted God’s people, Ezek. xxix., xxx.:<i> Nineveh</i> is fallen, the bloody city, Nahum iii. 1–19:<i> Babyon</i> is fallen, the great enemy of Israel, Isa. xxi. 9; Jer. l, li, al.:<i> Persia</i> is fallen, Dan. x. 13, xi. 2:<i> Græcia</i> is fallen, Dan. xi 3, 4. Thus, and as it seems to me thus only, can we do justice to the expression. Nor is any force done thus to the word Kings, but on the contrary it is kept to its strict prophetic import, and to the analogy of that portion of prophecy which is here especially in view. For in Dan, vii. 17 we read, that these great beasts which are four are four kings, not<i> kingdoms</i>),<b> the one is</b> (the Roman),<b> the other</b> (required to complete the seven)<b> is not yet come</b> (I agree with Auberlen, on Daniei, in regarding this seventh as the<i> Christian empire</i> beginning with Constantine: during whose time the beast in his proper essence, in his fulness of opposition to God and his saints, ceases to be),<b> and when he shall come he must remain a little time</b> (certainly the impression we derive from these words is not as Düsterdieck, al., that his empire is to be of very short continuance, but the term [ “<i>a season</i>”], as in 1 Pet. i. 6, v. 10 [ “<i>a while</i>"] gives the idea of some space not assigned, but vaguely thus stated as “some little time.” The idea given is rather that of duration than non-duration. Here, the stress is on<b> must remain</b>, and not on “<i>a short space</i>:” on the fact of<i> some</i> endurance, not on its being but short).
