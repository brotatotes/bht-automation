<b>And the ten horns which thou sawest, are ten kings</b> (not necessarily personal kings: see on ver. 10 above: but kingdoms, regarded as summed up in their kings)<b> which</b> (kings of that kind who)<b> have not yet received a kingdom, but receive power as kings</b> (the term,<b> as kings</b>, is somewhat enigmatical. Auberlen suggests, whether the kingly power itself may not have passed away from these realms in the days of antichristian misrule, and thus their power be only<b> as</b><i> kings</i>. But this seems inconsistent with their being<i> called</i> kings. Rather I would say the<b> as</b> represents the reservation of their kingly rights in their alliance with the beast)<b> one hour</b> (i. e. during the space of one hour: just as the corresponding term in ch. viii. 1 means, during the space of half an hour. Some, e.g. Vitringa and Elliott, have upheld the meaning of “at one and the same time with.” But I venture to say that but for a preconceived opinion, no one would ever have thought of any other meaning for these words than the ordinary one, “for the space of one hour.” And thus accordingly we will take them, as signifying some definite space, unknown to us, thus designated: analogous in position to the term “<i>a short space</i>” above)<b> together with</b> (i. e. in conjunction with, allied with: their power will be associated with his power)<b> the beast</b> (who are these? The answer seems to be furnished us in Dan. vii. 23 ff. They are ten kingdoms which shall arise out of the fourth great kingdom there: ten European powers, which in the last time, in concert with and subjection to the antichristian power, shall make war against Christ. In the precise number and form here indicated they have not yet arisen. It would not be difficult to point out the elements and already consolidating shapes of most of them: but in precise number we have them not as yet. What changes in Europe may bring them into the required tale and form, it is not for us to say).
