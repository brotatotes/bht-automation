<b>And he saith to me, The waters which thou sawest, where</b> (i. e. on which)<b> the harlot sitteth, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages</b> (so in Isa. viii. 7, the king of Assyria and his invading people are compared to the waters of the river, strong and many. There is also doubtless an impious parody intended in the position of the harlot to that of Him who sitteth above the water-flood, and remaineth King for ever, Ps. xxix. 10).
