<b>And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast</b> (viz. in that compact and alliance just now mentioned),<b> these shall hate the harlot</b> (we now enter upon prophetic particulars other than those revealed in the vision, where the harlot was sitting on the beast. Previous to these things coming to pass, she must be cast down from her proud position),<b> and shall make her deserted and naked</b> (contrast to ver. 4. Her former lovers shall no longer frequent her nor answer to her call: her rich adornments shall be stripped off. She shall lose, at the hands of those whom she formerly seduced with her cup of fornication, both. her spiritual power over them, and her temporal power to adorn herself),<b> and shall eat her flesh</b> (batten upon her spoils; confiscate her possessions: or perhaps, as the same expression, Ps. xxvii, 2; Micah ili. 2 ff, where it is used to indicate the extreme vengeance of keen hostility),<b> and shall consume her with</b> (<b>in</b>)<b> fire</b> (DÃ¼sterdieck remarks that in the former clause the figure of a<i> woman</i> is kept: in this latter the thing signified, a<i> city</i>. But this need not absolutely be: the woman may be here also intended: and all the more probably, because the very words<b> shall consume her with fire</b> are quoted from the legal formula of the condemnation of those who had committed abominable fornications: see Levit. xx. 14, xxi. 9. The burning of the city would be a signal fulfilment: but we cannot positively say that that, and nothing else is intended).
