<b>And the merchants of tho earth weep and lament</b> (the construction passes into the graphic present, but resumes the future again below, ver. 15, in speaking of the same thing)<b> over her, Because ne one any longer buys their cargo</b> (the description which follows is perhaps drawn, in its poetic and descriptive features, from the relation of Rome to the world which then was, rather than from its relation at the future time depicted in the prophecy. But it must not for a moment be denied, that the character of this lamentation throws a shade of obscurity over the interpretation, otherwise so plain from the explanation given in ch. xvii. 18. The difficulty is however not confined to the application of the prophecy to Rome papal, but extends over the application of it to Rome<i> at all</i>, which last is determined for us by the solution given ch. xvi. 18. For Rome never has been, and from its very position never could be, a great commercial city. I leave this difficulty unsolved, merely requesting the stu-dent to bear in mind its true limits and not to charge it exclusively on that interpretation which only shares it with any other possible one. The main features of the description are taken from that of the destruction of and lamentation over Tyre in Ezek. xxvii., to which city they were strictly applicable. And possibly it may be said that they are also applicable church which has wedded herself to the pride of the earth and its luxuries. But certainly, as has been observed, the details of this mercantile lamentation far more nearly suit London, than Rome at any assignable period of her history),
