and cinnamon</b> (it is not certain, whether the<i> cinnamomum</i> of the ancients was the same as our cinnamon, Various accounts are given of its origin, but Herodotus, who ascribes it to the country where Dionysus [Bacchus] was born, i.e. to India, seems to give the right statement, if at least it is the modern cinnamon, which comes from Ceylon. In Exod. xiii, 23, it is an ingredient, in the holy oil for anointing: in Prov. vii, 17 it is one of the perfumes of the bed of the adulteress: in Cant. iv. 14 it is one of the plants growing in the garden of the beloved),<b> and amomum</b> (a precious ointment made from an Asiatic shrub, and used for the hair),<b> and odou</b> rs (for incense),<b> and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine meal</b> (<i>semidalis</i>, the<i> simila</i> or<i> similago</i> of the Latins, the finest wheaten meal:<i> the name</i> has been revived in our time as<i> semolina</i>),<b> and wheat, and cattle and sheep, and of horses and of chariots, and of bodies</b> (i. e. slaves),—<b>and persons</b> (lit. souls)<b> of men</b> (so the A.V. for the corresponding Hebrew expression, Ezek. xxvii. 13, which the Septuagint render aa here,<b> souls of men</b>, It seems vain to attempt to draw a distinction between the<b> bodies</b> before mentioned and these<b> souls</b> or<b> persons</b> of men. If any is to be sought, the most obvious is that pointed out by Bengel, and adopted by Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Düsterdieck, that<b> bodies</b> expresses such slaves as belong to the horses and chariots, and<b> persons of men</b> slaves in general).
