<p><strong> 14</strong> .] This verse takes the form of a direct address, and then in the next the merchants are taken up again. From this some have thought that it is not in its right place: e. g. Beza and Vitringa fancied it should be inserted after <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+18:23">Revelation 18:23</span> ; others, as Ewald, that it was originally a marginal addition by the Writer. But irregular as is the insertion, it need not occasion any real difficulty. It takes up the κλαίουσιν κ . πενθοῦσιν of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+18:11">Revelation 18:11</span> , as if αὐτῶν after those verbs had been ἡμῶν , which is not unnatural in a rhapsodical passage. And τούτων , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+18:15">Revelation 18:15</span> , refers very naturally back to πάντα τὰ λιπαρὰ κ . τ . λ ., in this verse. <strong> And thy harvest of the desire of thy soul</strong> (i. e. the ingathering of the dainties and luxuries which thy soul lusted after. It seems better on account of the following genitives to take ὀπώρα thus, than to understand it in the concrete of the fruit itself, though it frequently has this latter sense: see Palm and Rost’s Lex. and the reff. here) <strong> has departed from thee, and all (thy) fat things and [thy] splendid things have perished from thee, and they</strong> (men) <strong> shall never more at all find them</strong> .

<p>The next two verses describe, in strict analogy with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+18:9-10">Revelation 18:9-10</span> , the attitude and the lamentation of these merchants. <strong> The merchants of these things</strong> (viz. of all those mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+18:12-13">Revelation 18:12-13</span> , which have been just summed up as πάντα τὰ λιπαρὰ κ . τ . λ .) <strong> who gained wealth from her, shall stand afar off by reason of their fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, which was lothed in stuff of fine linen and of purple and of scarlet, and bedecked</strong> (lit. <em> gilded</em> ; the zeugmatic construction carrying on the word to the other substantives besides χρυσίῳ , which we cannot do in English) <strong> in</strong> (or, if ἐν be omitted, <em> with</em> ) <strong> golden ornament and precious stone and pearl: because</strong> ( ὅτι gives a reason for the οὐαὶ οὐαί ) <strong> in one hour hath been desolated all that wealth</strong> .</p>
