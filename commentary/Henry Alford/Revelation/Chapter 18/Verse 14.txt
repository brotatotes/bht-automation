<b> 14</b>.] This verse takes the form of a direct address, and then in the next the merchants are taken up again. From this some have thought that it is not in its right place: e.g. Beza and Vitringa fancied it should be inserted after ver. 23: others, as Ewald, that it was originally a marginal addition by the Writer. But irregular as is the insertion, it need not occasion any real difficulty. It takes up the “<i>weep and mourn</i>” of ver. 11, as if “<i>them</i>” after those verbs had been “<i>us</i>,” which is not unnatural in a rhapsodical passage. And “<i>these things</i>,” ver. 15, refers very naturally back to the “<i>fat things and splendid things</i>” mentioned in this verse.<b> And thy harvest of the desire of thy soul</b> (i. e. the ingathering of the dainties and luxuries which thy soul lusted after)<b> has departed from thee, and all</b> [<b>thy</b>]<b> fat things and</b> [<b>thy</b>]<b> splendid things have perished from thee, and they</b> (men)<b> shall never more at all find them</b>. The next two verses describe, in strict analogy with vv. 9, 10, the attitude and the lamentation of these merchants.<b> The</b><b> merchants of these things</b> (viz. of all those mentioned in vv. 12, 13, which have been just summed up as “<i>fat things and splendid things</i>”)<b> who gained wealth from her, shall stand afar off by reason of their fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,{16}saying, Woe, woe, the great city, which was clothed in stuff of fine linen and of purple and of scarlet, and gilded in golden ornament and precious stone and pearl: because</b> (gives a reason for the<b> Woe, woe</b>)<b> in one hour hath been desolated all that wealth.</b>
