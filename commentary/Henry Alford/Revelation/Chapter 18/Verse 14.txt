 14 .] This verse takes the form of a direct address, and then in the next the merchants are taken up again. From this some have thought that it is not in its right place: e. g. Beza and Vitringa fancied it should be inserted after Revelation 18:23 ; others, as Ewald, that it was originally a marginal addition by the Writer. But irregular as is the insertion, it need not occasion any real difficulty. It takes up the κλαίουσιν κ . πενθοῦσιν of Revelation 18:11 , as if αὐτῶν after those verbs had been ἡμῶν , which is not unnatural in a rhapsodical passage.

The merchants of these things (viz. of all those mentioned in Revelation 18:12-13 , which have been just summed up as πάντα τὰ λιπαρὰ κ . τ . λ .)  who gained wealth from her, shall stand afar off by reason of their fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, which was lothed in stuff of fine linen and of purple and of scarlet, and bedecked (lit.  gilded ; the zeugmatic construction carrying on the word to the other substantives besides χρυσίῳ , which we cannot do in English)  in (or, if ἐν be omitted,  with )  golden ornament and precious stone and pearl: because ( ὅτι gives a reason for the οὐαὶ οὐαί )  in one hour hath been desolated all that wealth .
