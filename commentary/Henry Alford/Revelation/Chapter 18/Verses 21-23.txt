 21 23 .]  Symbolic proclamation by an angel of Babylon’s ruin .  And one (or  a )  strong angel took up a stone great as a millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a rush shall be thrown down Babylon the great city, and shall never be found any more. And the sound of harpers and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters shall never be heard in thee any more, and every artisan of every art shall never be found in thee any more, and the sound of the millstone (see Jeremiah 25:10 , Heb. and E. V., not LXX, where the denunciation regards Jerusalem, and is to be performed by the King of Babylon)  shall never be heard in thee any more, and the light of a lamp shall never shine in (or  upon )  thee any more (still from Jer. l. c.),  and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall never be heard in thee any more: because thy merchants were the great men of the earth, because in thy sorcery (on the form φαρμακία (= - κεία ) see reff.)  all the nations were deceived (see Isa 47:9-12 ).  And in her (the angel drops the address to the fallen city, and speaks out this last great cause of her overthrow as a fact respecting her)  the blood of prophets and of saints was found and of all who have been slain on the earth (i. e. naturally, of all slain for Christ’s sake and His word. Compare the declaration of our Lord respecting Jerusalem, Mat 23:35 ).
