<b>And I fell down before his feet to worship him</b> (out of an overweening reverence for one who had imparted to him such great things: see also ch. xxii. 8, where the same again takes place at the end of the whole revelation, and after a similar assurance, The angel who had thus gua-ranteed to him, in the name of God, the certainty of these great revelations, seems to him worthy of some of that reverence belongs to God Himself. The reason en by Düsterdieck, that in both cases John imagined the Lord Himself to be speaking to him, is sufficiently contradicted by the plain assertion, here in ch. xvii. 1, and there in ch. xxii. 8 itself, that was not a divine Person, but simply an angel):<b> and he saith to me, Take heed not</b> (to do it):<b> I am a fellow-servant of thine, and</b> [a fellow-servant] o<b> f thy brethren who have the testimony of Jesus</b> (as in ch, i. 2, xii. 17: on the former of which see note):<b> worship God</b> (the stress is on both words: let worship be reserved for<i> Him</i>),<b> for</b> (these words following are those of the angel, not of the Apostle, as Düsterdieck: ver. 8, and ch. v. 8, where the Apostle gives explanations, are no rule for this place, where the explanation of necessity comes from the speaker, whose reason for prohibiting the offered homage it renders)<b> the testimony of Jesus</b> (the genitive<b> of Jesus</b> is, as before,<i> objective</i>: the testimony<i> borne</i><i> to</i> Jesus by these fellow-servants, men and angels)<b> is the spirit of prophecy</b> (there is no real difficulty in this saying: no reason for destroying its force hy making “<i>of Jesus</i>”? subjective, and “<i>the testimony of Jesus</i>” to mean “the witness which proceeds from Jesus.” What the angel says is this: Thou and I and our brethren are all “<i>those who have the testimony of Jesus,</i>” i.e. are witnesses to Jesus; and the way in which we bear this witness, the substance and essence of this testimony, is the spirit of prophecy; “<i>we have all been made to drink into one Spirit</i>.” This Spirit, given to me in that I shew thee these things, given to thee in that thou seest and art to write them, is the token that we are fellow-servants and brethren. It does not follow that every one of those “<i>who have the testimony of Jesus</i>” has, in the same distinguished degree, the Spirit of prophecy: but every such one has the same Spirit, and that one Spirit, and no other, is the Spirit of prophecy).
