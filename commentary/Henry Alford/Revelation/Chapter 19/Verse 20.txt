<b>And the beast was taken, and those with him</b> (to wit, the false prophet, and the rest, ver. 21),<b>—the false prophet who wrought the miracles in his pre-sence</b> (compare ch. xiii. 11–17, by which it clearly appears that this false prophet is identical with that second beast),<b> with which he deceived those who received</b> (not necessarily nor probably, who<i> had</i> received, as A.V.)<b> the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image</b> (compare ch. xiii. 14, 16):<b> the two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burneth with brimstone</b> (viz. into Gehenna, or hell properly so called, Matt. v. 22; Luke vi. 23; where also, after the millennium, Satan himself is cast, ch. xx. 10, and, when their work is finally accomplished, Death and Hadés, ib. 14 a. This lake of fire constitutes the second death, ib. 14 b, xxi. 8. These only, and not the Lord’s human enemies yet, are cast into eternal punishment. The latter await the final judgment, ch. xx. 11 ff.).
