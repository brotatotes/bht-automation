The plural, righteousnesses, is probably distributive, implying not many to each one, as if they were merely good deeds, but one righteousness to each of the saints, enveloping him as in a pure white robe of righteousness. Observe that here and every where, the white robe is not Christ’s righteousness imputed or put on, but<i> the saints’ righteousness</i>, by virtue of being washed in His blood. It is<i> their own</i>; inherent, not imputed; but their own by their part in and union to Him),
