<b>And he saith</b> (who? the only ‘answer ready to our hand is, the angel of ch. xvii. 1. Some, as Ewald and Ebrard, suppose some one angel to have been constantly with St. John throughout the visions: but there seems no reason for this)<b> unto me, Write</b> (see ch. xiv. 13)<b> Blessed are they who are bidden</b> (bear in mind, throughout, our Lord’s parables on this matter: Matt. xxii, 1 ff., xxv. 1 ff. Our ch. iii. 20 furnishes us with a link binding on the spi-ritual import to the figure)<b> to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb. And he saith to me</b> (the solemn repetition of this formula shews that what follows it is a new and important declaration),<b> These</b> [<b>sayings</b>] (see ch. xvii. 17. If we understand that the speaker is the angel of ch. xvii. 1, then these sayings will most naturally include the prophecies and revela-tions since then)<b> are the true</b> [<b>sayings</b>]<b> of God</b> (are the very truth of God, and shall veritably come to pass).
