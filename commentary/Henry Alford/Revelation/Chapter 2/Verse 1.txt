<b> CH. II. 1—III. 22.]</b> THE EPISTLES TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES. Views have considerably differed respecting the character of these Epistles, whether they are to be regarded as simply historical, or historico-prophetical, or simply prophetical. The point on which all, I presume, will be agreed is, that the words contained in these Epistles are applicable to and intended for the guidance, warning, and encouragement of the whole Church Catholic, and its several parts, throughout all time. The differing interpretations will here be only briefly alluded to. One account of them will be found in Vitringa’s (Latin) Commentary, pp. 27–58: and (but scantily, as most interpreters pass over this portion of the book slightly) in the introductions to the principal commentaries. See also Abp. Trench’s Appendix to his Commentary on the Seven Epistles, pp. 209–225.<br><br> Before commenting on each individual Epistle, I would notice the similar construction of all. This may be thus described. Each Epistle contains, 1. A command, to write to the angel of the particular church. 2. A sublime title of our Lord, taken for the most part from the imagery of the preceding vision. 3. An address to the angel of the church, always commencing with<i> I know</i>, introducing a statement of its present circumstances: continuing with an exhortation either to repentance or to constancy: and ending with a prophetic announcement, mostly respecting what shall be at the Lord’s coming. 4. A promise made to<i> “him that overcometh,”</i> generally accompanied with a solemn call to earnest attention,<i> “He that hath an ear, &c.”</i><br><br> In what particular the Ephesian church had left her first love, is not stated. Perhaps, as Ansbert says, “she was excited with the love of this world:” or, seeing that it is negative, rather than positive delinquency which is blamed, the love of first conversion had waxed cold, and given place to a lifeless and formal orthodoxy).<b> Remember therefore whence thou hast fallen</b> (the first fervour of love is regarded as a height, from which the church had declined),<b> and repent</b> (quickly and effectually, as the tense in the original implies),<b> and do the first works</b> (the works which sprung from that thy first love: those resume);<b> but if not, I [will] come to thee</b> (not Christ's final coming, but his coming in special judgment is here indicated),<b> and will move thy candlestick</b><b> out of its place</b> (i. e. will make thee cease to be a church: see the fulfilment noticed in Introd.,§iii. par. 7),<b> if thou do not repent</b> (shalt not have repented; i.e. by the speedy time indicated in the previous command).
