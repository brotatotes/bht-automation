<b> 10.]</b><b> Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer</b> (in the ways mentioned below. The expression indicates manifold tribulation, as there):<b> behold for certain</b> (the expression in the original gives the tone of present certainty and actuality),<b> the devil</b> (it is understood from the context, that the devil would act through the hostility of human agents, and among them eminently these Jewish enemies)<b> is about to cast</b> [<b>some</b>]<b> of you into prison</b> (to be literally understood: the constant accompaniment of persecution, Acts xii. 3; xvi. 23),<b> that ye may be tried</b> (by temptations to fall away: not, that ye may be<i> proved</i>. This might be the end which Christ had in view in permitting the persecution: but the expression here rather gives the purpose of the agent in the previous clause, viz.<i> the devil</i>);<b> and ye shall have tribulation ten days</b> (the expression is probably used to signify a short and limited time: so in Gen. xxiv. 55; Judges xi. 19; Dan. i. 12: see also Numb. xiv, 22; 1 Sam. 1. 8; Job xix. 3; Acts xxv. 6. All kinds of fanciful interpretations have been given: see in my Greek Test.).<b> Be</b> (literally,<b> become</b>: new circumstances of trial requiring new kinds and degrees of fidelity; which does not remain as it is, but takes accession)<b> thou</b> (it is quite futile to attempt to distinguish in these Epistles between what is said to the Angel in the singular, and what is said to the Church in the plural. This is shewn by the former part of this verse, “<b>thou</b><i> art about to suffer</i>,”... followed<b> by some of you</b>. Only where there is occasion to discriminate, is the plural used: see v. 24f.: but wherever the whole church is spoken of it is in the singular, under the person of its representative angel)<b> faithful</b><b> unto</b> (not,<i> “until:”</i> but<i> “even unto,”</i> i.e. up to the point or measure of: Let not thy faithfulness stop short of enduring death itself. Compare Phil. ii. 8)<b> death, and</b> (reff.)<b> I will give thee the crown</b> (the crown, as being the well-known prize promised to the faithful: as in James i. 22, 2 Tim. iv. 8)<b> of life</b> (genitive of apposition: the life itself being the crown: see note, and distinction, on 2 Tim. iv. 8).
