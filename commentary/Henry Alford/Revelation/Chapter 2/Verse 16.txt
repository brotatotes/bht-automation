	The command is addressed not only to the Nicolaitans, but to the church, which did not, like that of Ephesus, hate them, but apparently tolerated them):  but if not, I (will) come to thee (dat. incommodi, see above on Rev 2:5 )  quickly (here again, though in the common eschatological phrase, not of the Lord’s final coming; as indeed the language shews, for then He no longer πολεμήσει ),  and will make war with them (the Nicolaitans. This making war must not be understood as Grotius, “Prophetas excitabo in Ecclesia, qui id faciant quod Episcopus negligit, et fortiter se opponant Nicolaitis” (similarly Calov.))  with (  ἐν , in, as armed with or arrayed in: but sometimes in the Rev. it is difficult to trace the proper meaning of ἐν , and it seems almost purely instrumental: cf.

Rev 1:16 is so plainly asserted by our Revelation 2:12 , it seems better to confine the allusion to that sword, and not to stretch it to what after all is a very doubtful analogy).
