<p>The command is addressed not only to the Nicolaitans, but to the church, which did not, like that of Ephesus, hate them, but apparently tolerated them): <strong> but if not, I (will) come to thee</strong> (dat. incommodi, see above on Rev 2:5 ) <strong> quickly</strong> (here again, though in the common eschatological phrase, not of the Lord’s final coming; as indeed the language shews, for then He no longer πολεμήσει ), <strong> and will make war with them</strong> (the Nicolaitans. This making war must not be understood as Grotius, “Prophetas excitabo in Ecclesia, qui id faciant quod Episcopus negligit, et fortiter se opponant Nicolaitis” (similarly Calov.)) <strong> with</strong> ( <strong> ἐν</strong> , in, as armed with or arrayed in: but sometimes in the Rev. it is difficult to trace the proper meaning of ἐν , and it seems almost purely instrumental: cf. Winer, edn. 6, § 48, d) <strong> the sword of my mouth</strong> (many expositors (e. g., Grot., Wetst., Vitr., Beng., Stern, Hengst., Trench, al.) suppose an allusion to the sword of the angel, armed with which he withstood Balaam in the way (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+22:23">Numbers 22:23</span> ; Num 22:31 ), or to that and the sword by which those who sinned in the matter of Baal-peor ( Num 25:5 ), and eventually Balaam himself ( Num 31:8 ), were slain: but seeing that the connexion with ch. Rev 1:16 is so plainly asserted by our <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+2:12">Revelation 2:12</span> , it seems better to confine the allusion to that sword, and not to stretch it to what after all is a very doubtful analogy).</p>
