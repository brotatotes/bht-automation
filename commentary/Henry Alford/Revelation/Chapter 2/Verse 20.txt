<b> 20.]</b><b> Notwithstanding, I have against thee that thou sufferest thy wife Jezebel</b> (on the whole, the evidence for<b> thy</b> being inserted in the text seems to me to preponderate. It could not well have been<i> inserted</i>: and was sure to have been erased, from its difficulty, and possibly from other reasons, considering what was the common interpretation of the<i> angel</i>. It does not create any real difficulty: finding its meaning not in the matter of fact at Thyatira, but in the history from which the appellation<b> Jezebel</b> is taken. In 1 Kings xxi. 25 we read,<i> “Ahab, who did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord: whom Jezebel his wife stirred up:”</i> from which text the phrase is transferred entire, importing that this Jezebel was to the church at Thyatira what that other was to Ahab. It is not so easy to determine who is, or who are, imported by the term. The very fact of the name, Jezebel being chosen [for it is impossible, even were this the actual name of a woman, that it should be used here with any other than the symbolic meaning], coupled with<b> thy wife,</b> as above explained, takes us out of the realms of simple fact into those of symbolism. The figure of “Jezebel thy wife” being once recognized in its historical import, it would not be needful that an individual woman should be found to answer to it: the conscience of the Thyatiran church could not fail to apply the severe reproof to whatever influence was being exerted in the direction here indicated. So that I should rate at very little the speculations of many Commentators on the supposed woman here pointed out. Düsterdieck, recently, remarks that the expression,<b> which calleth herself a prophetess</b>, has something individual about it. So it has: but may not this individuality belong just as well to the figure, as to the thing signified by it? The sect or individuals being once concentrated as<b> Jezebel</b>, this expression would follow of course, in the propriety of the figure. On the whole, however, I should feel it more probable that some individual<i> teacher</i>, high in repute and influence at the time, is pointed at. The denunciation of such a teacher under such a title would be at once startling and decisive. Nor would probability be violated by the other supposition, that a favoured and influential party in the Thyatiran church is designated. The church herself is represented by a woman: why may not a party [compare the Jews, who are the<i> “synagogue</i><i> of Satan”</i> of ver. 9] within the church be similarly symbolized? However this may be, the real solution must lie hidden until all that is hidden shall be known. See more below),<b> who calleth herself a prophetess</b> (this clause perhaps points at an individual: but there is on the other hand no reason why a sect claiming prophetic gifts should not be indicated: the feminine belonging as before to the historical symbol),<b> and she teacheth and deceiveth my servants, to commit fornication and eat things sacrificed</b><b> to idols</b> (hence the propriety of the name Jezebel: for both these were the abominations of the historical Jezebel: 2 Kings ix. 22, 30 [See Jer. iv. 30; Nahum iii. 4]: the latter indeed in its more aggravated form of actual idolatry, 1 Kings xviii. 19. This specification of the mischief done shews us that this influence at Thyatira was in the same direction as the evil works of the Nicolaitans at Pergamus, ver. 14. The fact that this was the prevalent direction of the false teaching of the day, is important in a chronological point of view: see Introduction,§iii. par. 6).<b> And I gave her time</b> (not, “in my pre-ordination of what is to be,” as in Mark xiii. 20, but denoting historically that which the Lord had actually done, in vain. Notice that the<i> “suffering”</i> her, on which depended the time given her for repentance, is yet blamed [ver. 20] in the church of Thyatira as a sin)<b> that she should repent, and she willeth not to repent of</b> (literally,<i> “out of,”</i> so as to come out of)<b> her fornication</b> (the word is here to be taken, as in all these passages, in its literal sense. Otherwise, if taken figuratively, it would be only a repetition of the other particular, idolatry).
