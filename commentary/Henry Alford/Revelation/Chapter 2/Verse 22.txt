<b> 22.]</b><b> Behold</b> (arrests attention, and prepares the way for something unexpected and terrible),<b> I cast her</b> (evidently against her will: but there is not necessarily violence in the word: it is the ordinary verb for being “cast” on a bed of sickness: so Matt. viii. 6, 14)<b> into a bed</b> (of sickness, see Ps. xli. 3: will change her bed of whoredom into a bed of anguish. So most Commentators. Perhaps the threat has reference to a future pestilence. Some understand the bed to be future punishment, referring to Isa. xiv. 11),<b> and those who commit adultery</b> (not now<i> fornication</i>, but a more general term, embracing in its wide meaning both the fornication and eating things sacrificed to idols, and well known as the word used of rebellious and idolatrous Israel, Jer. iii. 8, v. 7; Ezek. xvi. 32&c.)<b> together with her</b> (not those who<i> commit adultery with her,</i> Dut those who, as well as she, commit adultery: those who share with her in her adulteries. These, as interpreted by the tone with which the rebuke began, will mean, those who by suffering and encouraging her, make themselves partakers of her sin, And this rather favours the idea that not one individual, but a dominant party, is intended. See below)<b> into great tribulation</b> (this clause forms a kind of parallelism with the former, so that<i> into great tribulation</i> is parallel with<i> into a bed</i>. But it is not to be regarded as interpreting the bed. Her punishment and that of her children [see below] is one thing; that of the partakers in her adulteries, those in the church who tolerated and encouraged her, another, viz. great tribulation. This is forcibly shewn by the words<i> if they do not repent of</i><b> her works</b> following),<b> if they do not</b> (speedily and effectually, shall not have done so by the time which I have in my thoughts)<b> repent of her</b> (not<i> their</i>: they are Christ’s servants who are tampering with her temptations and allowing themselves in her works, which are alien from their own spiritual life)<b> works, And her children</b> (emphatically put forward as distinguished from the last mentioned: as if it were, “And as to her children, &c.” These are her proper adherents: not those who suffer her, but those who are begotten of her, and go to constitute her. Some Commentators have vainly dreamt of the slaughter of Ahab’s seventy sons, 2 Kings x.: but they were not<i> Jezebel’s</i> children. The historical figure is obviously dropped here)<b> I will slay with death</b> (the expression is probably a rendering of the Hebrew idiom, which the Septuagint renders by<i> “to kill with death,”</i> and which occurs Lev. xx. 10, in reference to adultery. But we need not suppose a direct reference to that passage: for there is nothing of adultery here: we have done with that, and are come to the judgment on<i> her children</i>);<b> and all the churches</b> (this remarkable expression, meaning not, all the Asiatic churches, but all the churches in the world to the end of time, lifts the whole of this threatening and its accompanying encouragements out of proconsular Asia, and gives us a glimpse into the universal character of these messages)<b> shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and the hearts</b> (which, see Rom. viii. 29, is the attribute of God: and therefore of the Son of God. Compare ver. 18 above, and note. Grotius says, “By the<i> reins</i> are understood the desires,” as also Ps. cxix. 13, Jer. xii. 2, Prov. xxiii. 16: by the<i> heart</i>, the thoughts, 1 Sam. xvi. 7, 1 Kings viii. 39&c. But it seems doubtful whether so minute a distinction is in the words; whether they are not rather a general designation for the whole inward part of a man):<b> and I will give to you</b> ( ‘will render, in My doom of judgment.’ The strain of the Lord’s message is suddenly changed into a direct ad-dress to those threatened)<b> to each according</b><b> to your works</b> (not the mere outward products of the visible life, but the real acts and verities of the inward man, discerned by the piercing eye of the Son of God).
