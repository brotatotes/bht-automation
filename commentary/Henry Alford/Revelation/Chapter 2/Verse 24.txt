<b> 24.]</b><b> But</b> (contrast to those addressed before)<b> to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not</b> (not only do not<i> hold</i>, but are free from any contact with)<b> this teaching, such as have not known the depths</b> (deep places)<b> of Satan, as they call them</b> (it was the characteristic of the falsely named<i> Gnosis</i> [Knowledge], to boast of its<i> Bathea</i>, or depths, of divine things. Tertullian says, in accusing the Valentinian heretics of dark deeds in secret, that if you ask plain questions about their mysteries, they knit their brows, and answer, “<i>It is</i><b> deep</b>.” We may safely therefore refer the expression to the heretics spoken of, But it is not so clear to whom, as their subject, the words<b> as they call them</b> are to be appropriated, and again<i> whose</i> words<b> “of Satan”</b> are, whether those 1) of our Lord, 2) of the heretics, or 3) of the Christians addressed. If they belong to the<i> Christians</i>, then the sense will be, that they, the Christians, called the<b> depths</b> of the heretics the depths of<b> Satan</b>, and were content to profess their ignorance of them. So far would be true enough; but the sentence would thus be left very flat and pointless, and altogether inconsistent in its tone with the solemn and pregnant words of the rest of the message. If the words<b> as they call them</b> belong to the<i> heretics</i>, we have our choice between two views of the words<b> of Satan</b>: either 1) that the heretics themselves called their own mysteries<b> the depths of Satan</b>. But this, though held by some as a possible alternative,—can hardly be so, seeing that the words surely would not bear the sense thus assigned to them, viz. that they could go deeper than and outwit Satan in his own kingdom: and seeing moreover, that no such formula, or any resembling it, is found as used by the ancient Gnostic heretics: or 2) that the words<b> as they call them</b> apply only to the word<i> depths</i>, and that, when, according to<i> their</i> way of speaking,<i> “of God”</i> should have followed [1 Cor. ii. 10], the Lord in indignation substitutes<b> of Satan</b>. This has been the sense taken by most Commentators. And it appears to me that this alone comes in any measure up to the requirements of the passage, in intensity of meaning and solemnity, as well as in likelihood);<b> I cast not upon you any other burden</b> (to what do the words refer? There can, I imagine, be little doubt as to the answer, if we remember some of the expressions used in the apostolic decree in which these very matters here in question, fornication and abstaining from unholy meats, were the only things forbidden to the Gentile converts. For our Lord here takes up and refers to those very words. In Acts xv. 28 we read,<i> “It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us</i> to lay upon you no greater burden<i> than these necessary things, that ye abstain from meats offered fo idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.</i>” This act of simple obedience, and no deep matters beyond their reach, was what the Lord required of them. And this<i> burden</i> resolved itself into keeping the faith once delivered to the saints, as enjoined in the next sentence. The word has been very variously understood:—of the trouble given them by Jezebel and her followers:—of the punishments about to befall the heretics, which were not to be feared by the Christians:—of the burden of previous suffering implied in the word<b> patience</b> above,—and of the sense of “burden,” so often occurring in the prophets when they denounce the divine threatenings. But to my mind the allusion to the apostolic decree is too clear and prominent to allow of any other meaning coming into question: at least any other which sets that entirely aside. Others may be deduced and flow from that one, which have meaning for the church now that those former subjects of controversy have passed away):<b> but</b> ( “<i>only:</i>” i.e., forget not that the licence just accorded involves this sacred obligation)<b> that which ye have</b> (see ch. iii. 11: not to be restricted in its sense to their stedfastness in resisting Jezebel and hers, but representing the sum total of Christian doctrine and hope and privilege; the<i> “faith once for all delivered to the saints”</i> of Jude 3),<b> hold fast</b> (the word in the original sets forth not so much the continuing habit, as the renewed and determined grasp of every intervening moment of the space prescribed)<b> until the time when I shall come</b> (the original gives an uncertainty when the time shall be, which we cannot convey in our language).
