<b> 26.] And</b> (the announcement of reward to the conqueror<i> now first</i> precedes the proclamation to hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: and is joined,<i> here alone</i>, by “<b>and</b>” to the preceding portion of the Epistle; being indeed more closely connected with it in this case than in any of the others: see below)<b> he that conquereth</b><b> and he that</b> (by this second designation this second class is precluded from being taken as merely explanatory of the first, and is specified as included in it)<b> keepeth to the end</b> (it is remarkable, that immediately after the words, so pointedly alluded to above, in the apostolic decree, Acts xv. 28, was added,<i> from which if ye</i><b> keep</b><i> yourselves, ye shall do well</i>)<b> my works</b> (contrast to<b> her</b><i> works</i>, ver. 22: but extending beyond that contrast to a general and blessed truth.<b> My</b><i> works</i>, i.e. which belong to Me, are the attributes of Myself and of Mine),<b> I will give to him authority over the nations</b> (compare the words, “<i>Have thou</i><b> authority</b><i> over the cities,</i>” Luke xix. 17, which is the reward of him who obeyed the command,<i> “Occupy</i><i> till I come.”</i> The authority here spoken of is that which shall be conferred on the saints when they shall inherit the earth, and reign with Christ in His Kingdom. It has been gradually realized, as the stone cut out without hands has broken in pieces other kingdoms; but shall only then find its entire fulfilment),<b> and he shall govern</b> (literally,<i> “shall shepherd.”</i> It is the Septuagint rendering of a similar word signifying<i> to break in pieces</i>, which they have taken as an Hebrew verb signifying<i> to shepherd</i>, in Ps. ii. 9. The saying, as rendered by them, is sanctioned by being thrice quoted in this book, see ch. Xii. 5, xix. 15)<b> them with a rod of iron</b> (a sceptre of severity: ie. of inflexible justice),<b> as the vessels of pottery are broken up</b> (crushed, or shivered: the original gives the idea of the multitudinous fragments collapsing into an heap: the “broken to shivers” of the A.V. is very good),<b> as I also have received from my Father</b> (viz. in Ps. ii. 9, in which Psalm it is said,<i> “Thou art my Son,”</i> ver. 7. The power there conferred on Me, I will delegate to my victorious servant).<b> And I will give to him the star of the morning</b> (it is not easy to say what, in strict exactness, these words import. The interpretations given are very various and inconsistent. The early Expositors, Andreas and Arethas, Understand it of the Lucifer of Isa. xiv. 12, i.e. the devil, whom our Lord saw as lightning fall from heaven.—or, as there imported, the King of Babylon, the most powerful monarch on earth. Another ancient meaning given is the day-star arising in the hearts of the faithful, spoken of by St. Peter, 2 Pet. i. 19. Victorinus (century iv.) says it is<i> the first resurrection.</i> Many others, ancient and modern, understand Christ Himself, who, ch. Xxii. 16, declares Himself to be<i> the bright and morning star:</i> and doubtless, as has been before remarked on the fruit of the tree of life, ver. 7, and on the hidden manna, ver. 17, in the mystical sense, Christ Himself is the sum and inclusion of all Christ’s gifts: this truth serves to connect the symbolism of all these passages, but does not justify us in disturbing that of one by introducing that of another. Here the morning star clearly is not Christ Himself, the very terms of the sentence separating the two. Then again, we have Lyra’s interpretation, the glorious body; Grotius’s, that it is brightness as much exceeding all other, as the morning star excels the other stars. And this interpretation is probably near the mark. In Dan. xii. 3 we read that the righteous shall shine<i> as the stars,</i> and in Matt. xiii. 43 that they<i> shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</i> And in Prov. iv. 18, we read that “the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” Still, this interpretation does not quite satisfy the words<b> I will give him:</b> unless indeed the poetic imagery be, that he is imagined as clad in the glory of that star, putting it on as a jewel, or as a glittering robe. De Wette supposes that the star is to be given to him as its ruler: but such an interpretation would lead into a wide field of speculation which does not seem to have been opened by Scripture, and is hardly required by the passage itself).
