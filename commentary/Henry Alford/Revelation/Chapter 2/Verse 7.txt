<b> 7.]</b> Solemn conclusion of the Epistle.<b> He that hath an ear</b> (no fanciful distinction must be imagined between the singular, and the plural which is found in the Gospels [Matt. xi. 15, xiii. 9, &c.]. We have precisely the same use of the singular in Matt. x. 27, where a distinction will hardly be maintained),<b> let him hear what the Spirit</b> (speaking in its fulness, through Him to whom it is given without measure, to John who was<i> in the Spirit</i>, in a state of spiritual ecstasy and receptivity: compare John xvi. 13)<b> saith to the churches</b> (Ebrard well notices that not a colon [or semi-colon, as in A.V.], but a fall stop must be put here, as indeed might be shewn from the way in which the proclamation is repeated in ver. 29 and in ch. iii. 6, 13, 22. It directs attention, not to that which follows only, but to the whole contents of the seven Epistles),<b> To him that conquereth</b> (the verb is absolute, without any object expressed. So of Christ Himself in ch. iii. 21)<b> I will give to him</b> (so literally: the personal pronoun is repeated both idiomatically and for emphasis)<b> to eat</b> (i. e. I will permit him to eat: not in the ordinary sense of<i> giving to eat</i>: see ch. iii. 21)<b> of</b> [the fruit of]<b> the tree</b> (see Gen. ii. 9, from which the words come: and to suit which apparently the words<i> in the midst of</i> have been substituted for<b> in</b>)<b> of life, which is in the paradise of God</b> (the way to which tree was closed up after man’s sin, Gen. iii. 24. The promise, and its expression are in the closest connexion with our Lord’s discourse in John vi., as will be seen by comparing Gen. iii. 22. But we need not therefore say that Christ<i> is</i> the tree of life here, nor confuse the figure by introducing one which in its character is distinct from it. Still less is the tree to be interpreted as being the Holy Spirit. See, for the imagery, ch. xxii. 2, 14, 19. The words<b> of God</b>, as following<i> paradise</i>, come from Ezek. xxviii. 13, and set forth the holiness and glory of that paradise, as consisting in God's dwelling and delighting in it).
