<p><strong> 18 29</strong> .] THE EPISTLE TO THE CHURCH AT THYATIRA. See Prolegg. § iii. 9. <strong> And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God</strong> (our Lord thus names himself here, in accordance with the spirit of that which is to follow; Rev 2:27 being from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:0">Psalms 2:0</span> , in which it is written, κύριος εἶπεν πρός με Υἱός μου εἶ σύ , ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε ), <strong> who hath his eyes as a flame of fire</strong> (connected with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+2:23">Revelation 2:23</span> , ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἐρευνῶν νεφροὺς καὶ καρδίας ) <strong> and his feet are like to chalcolibanus</strong> (for <strong> χαλκολ</strong> ., see on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:15">Revelation 1:15</span> . There is here probably a connexion with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span> , ὡς τὰ σκεύη τὰ κεραμικὰ συντρίβεται , the work of the strongly shod feet): <strong> I know thy works, and</strong> (the four which follow are subordinated to the ἔργα preceding, as is shown by σου placed after the four, not after each one. The καί then is the subordinating or epexegetic copula, as in καὶ χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span> . See Winer, edn. 6, § 53. 3, c) <strong> the love</strong> ( ἀγάπη , standing first, is probably quite general, to God and man) <strong> and the faith</strong> (general again: not = faithfulness, but in its ordinary sense) <strong> and the ministration</strong> (viz., to the sick and poor, and all that need it: the natural proof of ἀγάπη and πίστις πίστις δι ʼ ἀγάπης ἐνεργουμένη , Gal 5:6 ) <strong> and the endurance</strong> (in tribulation: or perhaps the ὑπομονὴ ἔργου ἀγαθοῦ of Rom 2:7 ) <strong> of thee, and</strong> (that) <strong> thy last works</strong> (are) <strong> more</strong> (in number, or importance, or both) <strong> than the first</strong> (this praise is the opposite of the blame conveyed by Rev 2:5 to the Ephesian church).</p>
