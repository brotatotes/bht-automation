<b>And I saw a great white throne</b> (great, in distinction from the thrones before mentioned, ver. 4: white, as seen in purest light, and symbolizing the most blameless justice),<b> and Him that sitteth on it</b> (viz. God: the Father: see ch. iv. 3, xxi. 5. It is necessary to keep to the well-known formula of the book in interpreting<b> Him that sitteth on it</b>, even though some expressions and sayings seem better to belong to the Son. Be it also remembered that it is the Father who giveth all judgment to the Son: and though He Himself judgeth no man, yet He is ever described as present in the judgment, and mankind as judged before Him. We need not find in this view any difficulty, or discrepancy with such passages as Matt. xxv. 31, seeing that our Lord Himself says in ch. iii. 21 “<i>I... sat down with my Father on His throne.”</i> Nor need we be surprised at the sayings of our Lord, such as that in ch. xxi. 6 b, being uttered by him that sitteth on the throne. That throne is now. the throne of God and of the Lamb, ch, xxii. 1, Compare also ch. xxi. 22),<b> from whose face the earth and the heaven fled, and place was not found for them</b> (these words again seem to indicate the presence of One who has not hitherto appeared: whereas Christ in glory has been long present on earth. This fleeing away of heaven and earth is elsewhere described as their consumption by fire, 2 Pet. iii. 10–12. Both descriptions indicate the passing away of their present corruptible state and change to a state glorious and incorruptible).
