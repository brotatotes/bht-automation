<b>And I saw the dead</b> (viz. the “<i>rest of the dead</i>” of 5: those who rose as described below, ver. 13),<b> the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened</b> (see Dan. vii. 10),<b> and another book was opened which is</b> [<b>the book</b>]<b> of</b><b> life</b> (Düsterdicck remarks that the order of proceedings indicated seems to be that the contents of the books in which were written the works of men indicated whether they were to be found in the book of life. But this could hardly be: for in that sense, what need for the book of life at all? Rather should we say that those books and the book of life bore independent witness to the fact of men being or not being among the saved: the one by inference from the works recorded: the other by inscription or non-inscription of the name in the list. So the ‘books’ would be as it were the vouchers for the book of life):<b> and the dead were judged out of the things written in the books according to their works</b> (reff.: and 2 Cor. v. 10).
