And Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire</b> (Death and Hades are regarded as two demons, enemies of God. So in 1 Cor. xv. 26. “<i>The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death</i>:” and in Isa. xxv. 8: Heb. and A.V., “He will swallow up death in victory.” compare I Cor. xv. 54. Hadés, as in ch. vi. 8, is Death’s follower and the receiver of his prey. The punishment of sin is inflicted on both, because both are the offspring of, and bound up with sin).<b> This is the second death, the lake of fire</b> (thus then our Lord’s saying, ch. ii. 11, and that of the Apostle in our ver. 6, are explained. As there is a second and higher life, so there is also a second and deeper death. And as after that life there is no more death [ch. xxi. 4], so after that death there is no more life, ver. 10; Matt. xxv. 41).
