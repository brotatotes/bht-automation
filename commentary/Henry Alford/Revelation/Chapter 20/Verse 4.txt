And I</b><b> saw thrones</b> (combine Dan. vii. 9, and Matt. xix. 28),<b> and they sat upon them</b> (who? the Apostles, as in Matt. xix. 28: the Saints, as in 1 Cor. vi. 2, 3; notice well, that there is nothing to hinder this in the souls of the saints not being seen till the next clause: for there is no mark of temporal sequence connecting the two verses: nay, such an idea is precluded by the specification at the end of ver. 4, that those very souls of the saints are they who reigned with Christ, and were His assessors in reigning and judging, during this time),<b> and judgment</b> (the act and decision of judgment)<b> was given to them</b> (so in Dan. vii. 22, “<i>Until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High.</i>” That is, they were constituted judges).<b> And I saw the souls of them who had been beheaded</b> (literally, smitten with the axe)<b> on account of the testimony of Jesus and on account of the word of God</b> (see ch. i. 9),<b> and</b> (of those)<b> the which did not worship</b> (during life)<b> the beast nor yet his image, and did not receive the mark</b> (mentioned ch. xiii. 16)<b> on their forehead and upon their hand: and they lived</b> (i. e. “<i>lived again</i>;” and, as the act is presently described as the first<i> resurrection</i>, with their bodies, perfect and complete)<b> and reigned with Christ</b> (took part in His Kingdom: see ch. i, 6; 2 Tim. ii. 12: also 1 Cor. iv. 8 and note)<b> a thousand years</b> (it would certainly appear that this reigning includes the office of judgment. Many interpreters suppose that these saints are the judged: but there is nothing in the context, nor in other parts of Scripture, to favour this idea, Nay, it is expressly negatived by our Lord’s saying in John v. 24: “<i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, That he who heareth my word, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath eternal life, and</i><b> cometh not into judgment</b><i>, but hath passed from death unto life</i>”).
