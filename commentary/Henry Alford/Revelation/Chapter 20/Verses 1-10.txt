<p><strong> 1 10</strong> .] THE VICTORY OVER SATAN. The next enemy now remaining is the Arch-fiend himself, who had given his might and his throne and great power (ch. Rev 13:2 ) to the beast: whose instruments the other enemies were. The blow given to him by their overthrow is followed by his binding and incarceration for 1000 years ( Rev 20:1-3 ): during which period the Saints live and reign with Christ, and judge the world, and the first resurrection takes place ( Rev 20:4-6 ). But his malice and his power are not yet at an end. One final effort is permitted him at the end of that time ( Rev 20:7 ), and he once more succeeds in deceiving the nations ( Rev 20:8 ), who come up against the camp of the saints, and are destroyed by fire from heaven ( Rev 20:9 ). He is then cast into the lake of fire with the beast and false prophet, there to be tormented for ever ( Rev 20:10 ).</p>
