<p>This key had been for the purposes of God’s judgments given to Satan (= Abaddon, Apollyon), and by him the locusts were let forth, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+9:1-11">Revelation 9:1-11</span> . Now it is entrusted to other hands, and for another purpose), <strong> and a great chain in</strong> (so in English: Gr., <em> resting on, hanging upon</em> , as a chain naturally would be: see reff.) <strong> his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon</strong> (already well known from ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+12:3">Revelation 12:3</span> ff., <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+13:2">Revelation 13:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+13:4">Revelation 13:4</span> ; Rev 16:13 ), <strong> the ancient serpent</strong> (for the expression and the construction, see reff.), <strong> who is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shut and sealed over him</strong> (shut the door or cover at the top, and sealed it down. Notice, that the same absolute use of σφραγίζω in the active is found in ref. John, and apparently there only: see Palm and Rost, sub voce), <strong> that he might deceive the nations no more</strong> (there does not appear to be the least ground for Düsterd.’s idea, that the reading πλανᾷ was adopted in order to suit the views of the later Fathers who regarded the millennium as present), <strong> until the thousand years shall be</strong> ( <em> shall have been</em> . futurus exactus) <strong> accomplished: after that he must</strong> (the <strong> δεῖ</strong> of prophecy; must, according to the necessity of God’s purposes) <strong> be loosed for a little time</strong> (see below, Rev 20:7 ).</p>
