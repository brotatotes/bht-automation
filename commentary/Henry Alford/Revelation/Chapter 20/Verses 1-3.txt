 1 3 .]  The binding of the dragon .  And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven (not Christ himself, as Aug [124] , Andr [125] , Calov., Vitr., Hengstb., al.: nor the Holy Spirit, as Joachim, Cocceius (al.?): but a veritable angel, as always before in this book)  having the key of the abyss (of hell, the abode of the devil and his angels: see ch. Revelation 9:1 .  For this abyss apparently is distinct from the lake of fire, a further and more dreadful place of punishment: see on Revelation 20:10 .

And he laid hold of the dragon (already well known from ch. Revelation 12:3 ff., Revelation 12:9 ; Revelation 13:2 ; Revelation 13:4 ; Rev 16:13 ),  the ancient serpent (for the expression and the construction, see reff.),  who is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shut and sealed over him (shut the door or cover at the top, and sealed it down. Notice, that the same absolute use of σφραγίζω in the active is found in ref. John, and apparently there only: see Palm and Rost, sub voce),  that he might deceive the nations no more (there does not appear to be the least ground for Düsterd.’s idea, that the reading πλανᾷ was adopted in order to suit the views of the later Fathers who regarded the millennium as present),  until the thousand years shall be (  shall have been . futurus exactus)  accomplished: after that he must (the  δεῖ of prophecy; must, according to the necessity of God’s purposes)  be loosed for a little time (see below, Rev 20:7 ).
