 CH. XXI. 1—XXII. 5.]<i> The new heavens and new earth: the glories of the heavenly Jerusalem.</i> The whole of the things described in the remaining portion of the book are subsequent to the general judgment, and descriptive of the consummation of the triumph and bliss of Christ’s people with Him in the eternal kingdom of God. This eternal kingdom is situated on the purified and renewed earth, become the blessed habitation of God with his glorified people.{1}<b>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were departed: and the sea exists no longer</b> (see on the whole, Isa. lxv. 17. The vision does not necessarily suppose the annihilation of the whole creation, but only its passing away as to its outward and recognizable form, and renewal to a fresh and more glorious one. And though not here stated on the surface, it is evident that the method of renewal is that described in 2 Pet. iii. 10 ff.; viz, a renovation by<i> fire</i>. This alone will account for the unexpected and interesting feature here introduced, viz. that the sea exists no longer. For this the words mean [see ver. 4], and not as Düsterdieck, that the [former] sea, as well as the former heaven and earth, had passed away).{2}<b>And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem</b> (see especially Gal. iv. 26, and note),<b> coming down. out of heaven from God</b> (Schöttgen quotes from the remarkable Jewish book Sohar, “Rabbi Jeremias said, The Holy Blessed God shall renew the world, and shall build Jerusalem, so as to make it come down from heaven into the midst of the world, so that it even shall be destroyed”),<b> prepared as a bride adorned for her husband</b> (as in our common discourse, so here with the Evangelist, the name of the material city stands for the community formed by its inhabitants. But it does not follow in his case, any more than in ours, that both material city and inhabitants have not a veritable existence: nor can we say that the glorious description of it, presently to follow, applies only to<i> them</i>. On the figure, see Isa. lxi. 10—lxii, 5).{3}<b>And I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle</b> (i. e. dwelling; the allusion being to the tabernacle in the wilderness, in which God dwelt in symbol only)<b> of God is with men, and He shall dwell</b> (tabernacle)<b> with them, and they shall be his people</b> (literally, peoples, plural: because, as in ch. xxi. 24, many nations shall now partake in the blessed fulfilment of the promise),<b> and He shall be God with them</b> (the name Emmanuel, God with us, first then being realized in its full significance),<b> their God</b> (so the ancient promises are fulfilled, Exod. xxix. 15; Lev. xxvi. 11; Ezek. xxvii. 27).{4}<b>And</b> [God]<b> shall wipe away every tear from their eyes</b> (reff.):<b> and death shall exist no longer</b> (ch. xx. 14),<b> and</b> (Gr. nor)<b> mourning</b> (Isa. lxv. 19)<b> and</b> (nor)<b> crying and</b> (nor)<b> pain shall exist no longer: because the first</b> (former state of)<b> things are passed away.{5}And He that sitteth on the throne</b> (see note ch. xx. 11)<b> said, Behold, I make all things new. And he</b> (probably the angel, or voice from heaven, that gave the Seer similar commands before, xiv. 13, xix. 9. This seems probable on account of the change to the formula<b> he saith</b>, as well as from the nature of the command: for we have “<i>said to me</i>” re-sumed immediately with the I, leaving. no doubt Who speaks)<b> saith, Write: because these words are faithful and true,{6}And He said to me</b> (viz. He that sitteth upon the throne),<b> They are fulfilled</b> (viz.<i> these sayings</i>: or, but 1 prefer the other,<i> all things</i>).<b> I am</b> (or,<b> I have become the Alpha, &c.</b>: see margin)<b> the Alpha and the Omega</b> (see above, ch. i. 8),<b> the beginning and the end</b> ( “the Unchangeable and Ever-lasting One, by Whom the old was and the new shall be, by Whom the old is fulfilled in the new, and with it all hope and all promise.” De Wette).<b> To him that thirsteth I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely</b> (compare ch. vii. 17, and reff. Isa. and John: compare also Matt. v. 6).{7}<b>He that conquereth shall inherit these things</b> (the glories to be shewn in the heavenly Jerusalem),<b> and I will be to him</b> [<b>a</b>]<b> God, and he shall be to me a son</b> (this will be the full perform-ance to the sons of God of the promise in 2 Kings vii. 14: which being first made to Solomon, received its chief fulfilment in the great Son of David and of God [Heb. i, 5], and now in Him to them that are His),{8}<b>But to the cowardly</b> (the contrast to them that conquer: the “<i>drawers back</i>"of Heb. x. 38: those who shrink timidly from the conflict),<b> and the unbe-lievers, and the polluted with abomina-tions</b> (those who have partaken of the abominations in ch, xvii, 4,—of idolatries, &c.),<b> and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the false</b> (i. e. all liars),<b> their part</b> [<b>shall be</b>]<b> in the lake that burneth with fire and brim-stone, which is the second death</b> (see the reff.).
