And the city lieth foursquare</b> (so A.V. well: is in shape tetragonal),<b> and her length is as great as her breadth</b> (see below).<b> And he measured the city with the reed to the length of stadii of the amount of twelve thousands</b> (the 12, 000 stadii are in all probability the whole circumference, 1000 to each space between the gates);<b> the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal</b> (the supposition of many expositors, that the city thus formed a monstrous cube, 3000 stadii in length, in breadth, and in height, really does not: appear to be necessarily included in these words, Nay, it seems to be precluded by what next follows, where the angel<i> measures the height</i> of the wall. For Düsterdieck’s idea that the<i> houses</i> were 3000 stadii in height, while the wall was only 144 cubits, is too absurd to come at all into question. The words are open, this last consideration being taken into account, to two interpretations: 1) that the city, including the hill or rock on which it was placed, and which may be imagined as descending with it, formed such a cube as seems here described: or 2) that there is some looseness of use in the word equal, and that we must understand that the length and breadth were equal to each other and the height equal all round. Of. these two I prefer the former, us doing no violence to the words, and as recalling somewhat the form of the earthly Jerusalem on its escarpment above the valley of the Kedron. Some such idea seems also to be pointed nt in the rabbinical books, which describe the future Jerusalem as twelve miles high. See extracts in my Greek Test.).
