<b>the fifth, sardonyx</b> (Exod. xxxix. 11; Ezek. xxviii. 18; perhaps garnet. Pliny describes it as “of the colour of the flesh under a fingernail.” The ancient versions and Jose-phus call it onyx),<b> the sixth, sardius</b> (ch, 3, note),<b> the seventh, chrysolith</b> (Ezek. xxviii, 13, where Josephus thus renders the word which in A.V. is “beryl.” The stone at present so called is pale green, transparent, and crystallized, with shifting colours. But the ancient chrysoliths are as by Pliny as translucent with golden rays, and have been supposed the same as our topaz: or by some, as amber),<b> the eighth, beryl</b> (Exod. xxiv. 10, where it “<i>sapphire</i>” in the A.V. It is said to have been pure sea-green),<b> the ninth, topaz</b> (Strabo describes it as transparent, shining with golden light. But Pliny says that it is a beautiful green: whence some have supposed it our chrysolith: see above. Compare Job xxviii. 19),<b> the tenth, chrysoprasus</b> (this word is found only in Pliny, who describes it as pale, and of a hue resembling the amethyst),<b> the eleventh, jacinth</b> (in Exod. xxviii, 19, called<i> ligure</i>. Pliny describes this also as a paler kind of amethyst),<b> the twelfth, amethyst</b> (Pliny reckons the amethyst among the purple stones. It seems to be the stone now known by that name),
