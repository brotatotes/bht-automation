<b> 9—XXII. 5.</b>]<i> More particular deserip-tion of the heavenly Jerusalem.</i><b>{9}And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, who</b> (viz. the angels, however strange it may seem: but thus it necessarily is in the ancient original text)<b> were full of the seven last plagues</b> (one of these angels had before shewn the Apostle the great harlot, ch. xvii. 1. The contrast to that vision is maintained throughout these opening verses),<b> and he talked with</b><b> me, saying, Hither, I will shew thee</b> (hitherto verbatim as in ch. xvii. 1)<b> the bride, the wife of the Lamb</b> (here likewise note the contrast to the succeeding context in ch. xvii. 1,—in the faithfulness and purity implied in these words).{10}<b>And he carried me away in the spirit</b> (ch. xvii. 3)<b> to</b> (as they say in some parts of England,<i> on to</i>, combining motion towards and position upon)<b> a mountain great and high</b> (so likewise when the vision of the heavenly city is vouchsafed to Ezekiel, Ezek. xl. 1, 2),<b> and shewed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God</b> (this vision had begun in ver. 2, but the Apostle is now carried to this “specular mount” to have a nearer and fuller view of it. The city must not be conceived of as on or covering the mountain, but as seen descending to a spot close by it: so in Ezek. xl. 2, whether we read “by” or “upon” as in our margin),{11}<b>having the glory of God</b> (i. e. not merely brightness of a divine and celestial kind, but the glorious presence of God Himself, the Shechinah, abiding in her: see ver. 23: also ch. xv. 8):<b> her brightness</b> (the<b> brightness</b>, from ver. 23, the effect of the divine glory shining in her) [<b>was</b>]<b> like to a stone: most precious, as it were to a jasper stone, crystal-clear</b> (see this “crystalizing” jasper discussed in note on ch. iv. 3. Ebrard thinks it is the diamond):{12}<b>having a wall great and high, having</b> [<b>also</b>]<b> twelve gates</b> (see Ezek. xlviii. 30 ff., where the same features are found in the description),<b> and at the gates twelve angels and names inscribed</b> (contrast to the names of blasphemy, ch. xvii. 3),<b> which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel</b> (it does not follow from this description either, 1. that the angels must necessarily be guardians, seeing that no foes remain to be guarded against: they are for the completeness and adornment of the city after the idea of a beautiful fortress, adopted to set it forth:—or, 2. that, as in the Jewish books, each gate is to be imagined as used by each the twelve tribes of Israel represent the whole people of God, and the city the encampment of Israel: see below).{13}<b>From</b> (on the side entering from)<b> the sun-rising three gates</b> (Joseph, Benjunin, Dan, in Ezek. xlviii. 32. In ch. vii. 6, Manasseh is substituted for Dan, which is omitted. See there),<b> from the north three gates</b> (Reuben, Judah, Levi),<b> from the south three gates</b> (Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun),<b> from the sun-setting three gates</b> (Gad, Asher, Naphtali: Ezek, ibid, In Numbers ii., the order of encampment is thus set down:<i> East</i>,—Judah, Issachar, Zebulmn:<i> South</i>,—Reuben, Simeon, Gad:<i> West</i>,—Ephraim, Manasseh Benjamin: North,—Dan, Asher, Naphtali).{14}<b>And the wall of the city</b> (the wall surrounding the city)<b> having</b> (had)<b> twelve foundation-stones</b> (i. e. probably, each portion of the wall joining two gates had a conspicuous basement, of one vast stone. Four of these, as Düsterdieck observes, would be corner-stones, joining the third gate on one side to the first gate on the next),<b> and upon them</b> (over thein, perhaps extending all their length)<b> twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb</b> (see Eph. ii. 20, where however the ruling idea is a different one, see the interpretation in the note. No inference can be drawn, as has been drawn by some from this, that the Writer was not himself an Apostle).
