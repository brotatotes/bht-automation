<p><strong> 9 22:5</strong> .] <em> More particular description of the heavenly Jerusalem</em> . <strong> And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, which</strong> (namely the angels, however strange it may seem) <strong> were full of the seven last plagues</strong> (one of these angels had before shewn the Apostle the great harlot, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span> . The contrast to that vision is maintained throughout these opening verses), <strong> and he talked with me, saying, Hither, I will shew thee</strong> (hitherto verbatim as in ch. Rev 17:1 ) <strong> the bride, the wife of the Lamb</strong> (here likewise note the contrast to the succeeding context in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span> , in the faithfulness and purity implied in these words). <strong> And he carried me away in the spirit</strong> (ch. Rev 17:3 ) <strong> to</strong> ( <strong> ἐπί</strong> , as we say in some parts of England, <em> on to</em> , combining motion towards and position upon) <strong> a mountain great and high</strong> (so likewise when the vision of the heavenly city is vouchsafed to Ezekiel, Eze 40:1-2 ), <strong> and shewed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God</strong> (this vision had begun in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span> , but the Apostle is now carried to this “specular mount” to have a nearer and fuller view of it. The city must not be conceived of as <em> on</em> or covering the mountain, but as seen descending to a spot close by it: so in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+40:2">Ezekiel 40:2</span> , whether we read “by” or “upon” as in our margin), <strong> having the glory of God</strong> (i. e. not merely brightness of a divine and celestial kind, but the glorious presence of God Himself, the Shechinah, abiding in her: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span> ; also ch. Rev 15:8 ): <strong> her brightness</strong> (henceforward the description goes on independent in construction of ἔδειξεν , and changes several times: so in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:15">Revelation 1:15</span> ff. See Winer, edn. 6, § 59. 11. <strong> φωστήρ</strong> , from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+21:23">Revelation 21:23</span> , is the effect of the divine glory shining in her: see reff. Gen., where it is used of the heavenly bodies) ( <strong> was</strong> ) <strong> like to a stone most precious, as it were to a jasper stone, crystal clear</strong> (Wetst. quotes from Psellus, ἡ ἴασπις φύσει κρυσταλλοειδής . See this “crystallizing” jasper discussed in note on ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+4:3">Revelation 4:3</span> . Ebrard thinks it is the diamond); <strong> having</strong> (on the construction, see above) <strong> a wall great and high, having</strong> ( <strong> also</strong> ) <strong> twelve gates</strong> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+48:30">Ezekiel 48:30</span> ff., where the same features are found in the description), <strong> and at the gates</strong> (dat. after <strong> ἐπί</strong> , of close juxtaposition, primarily of <em> addition</em> ) <strong> twelve angels, and names inscribed</strong> (contrast to the ὀνόματα βλασφημίας , ch. Rev 17:3 ), <strong> which are</strong> [ <strong> the names</strong> ] <strong> of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel</strong> (it does not follow from this description either, 1. that the angels must necessarily be guardians, seeing that no foes remain to be guarded against: they are for the completeness and adornment of the city after the idea of a beautiful fortress, adopted to set it forth: or, 2. that, as in the Jewish books (see De Wette here), each gate is to be imagined as used by each tribe: the twelve tribes of Israel represent the whole people of God, and the city the encampment of Israel: see below). <strong> From</strong> (on the side entering from) <strong> the sun-rising three gates</strong> (Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eze+48:32">Ezekiel 48:32</span> . In ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+7:6">Revelation 7:6</span> , Manasseh is substituted for Dan, which is omitted. See there), <strong> from the north three gates</strong> (Reuben, Judah, Levi), <strong> from the south three gates</strong> (Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun), <strong> from the sun-setting three gates</strong> (Gad, Asher, Naphtali: Ezek. ibid. In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="nu+2:0">Numbers 2:0</span> , the order of encampment is thus set down: <em> East</em> , Judah, Issachar, Zebulun: <em> South</em> , Reuben, Simeon, Gad: <em> West</em> , Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin: <em> North</em> , Dan, Asher, Naphtali). <strong> And the wall of the city</strong> (the wall surrounding the city) <strong> having</strong> (had: for masc. of the part., see ch. Rev 4:1 reff.) <strong> twelve foundation-stones</strong> (i. e. probably, each portion of the wall joining two gates had a conspicuous basement, of one vast stone. Four of these, as Düsterd. observes, would be corner-stones, joining the third gate on one side to the first gate on the next), <strong> and upon them</strong> (gen. over them, perhaps extending all their length) <strong> twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb</strong> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span> , where however the ruling idea is a different one, see the interpretation in the note. No inference can be drawn as has been drawn by some from this that the Writer was not himself an Apostle: see prolegg. § i. 84 ff.).</p>
