and if any one shall take away from the sayings of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his portion from the tree of life</b> (strike out his portion from the aggregate of those of which the whole participation of that tree is made up),<b> and out of the holy city, which are written in this book</b> (see Deut. as before. The adding and taking away are in the application and reception in the heart: and so it is not a mere formal threat to the copier of the book. All must be received and realized. This is at least an awful warning both to those who despise and neglect this book, and to those who add to it by irrelevant and trifling interpretations).
