 18 20 .]  Final solemn warning of the Apostle .  I (emphatic)  testify to every one (or, “  of every one,” by a very common N. T. construction: see reff. for both usages)  who heareth the sayings of the prophecy of this book, If any one add (aor. = futurus exactus,  shall have added)  to them, God shall add to him (lay upon him, as he has laid his own additions upon them: the verb being from ref. Deut., where the plagues of Egypt are threatened to the Israelites in case of their disobedience)  the plagues which are written in this book: and if any one shall take away from the sayings of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his portion from the tree of life (strike out his portion from the aggregate of those of which the whole participation of that tree is made up),  and [  out of ]  the holy city, which are written in this book (see Deuteronomy 4:2 ; Deuteronomy 12:32 . The adding and taking away are in the application and reception in the heart: and so it is not a mere formal threat to the copier of the book, as that cited from Irenæus in Eus [126] H. E. Revelation 22:20 , ὁρκίζω σε τὸν μεταγραψάμενον τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο .… ἵνα ἀντιβάλῃς ὃ μετεγράψω , καὶ κατορθώσῃς .… All must be received and realized. This is at least an awful warning both to those who despise and neglect this book, and to those who add to it by irrelevant and trifling interpretations).
