<b>Because thou didst keep the word of my endurance</b> (or,<b> patience</b>: the word preached to thee, enjoining that endurance which belongs to Me and mine, see ch. i. 9),<b> I also</b> (I on my side: the<b> also</b> expressing reciprocity)<b> will keep thee</b> (<b>thee</b>, emphatic and prominent)<b> from</b> (from out of the midst of: but whether by<i> immunity from</i>, or by<i> being brought safe through</i>, the preposition does not clearly define)<b> the hour of temptation</b> (the appointed season of sore trial: literally,<b> of the temptation</b>, of the well-known and signal temptation. But the article cannot be expressed in English, because it would unavoidably become the antecedent to<i> “which”</i> following)<b> which is about to come upon the whole world</b> (the time imported is that prophesied of in Matt. xxiv. 21 ff., viz. the great time of trouble which shall be before the Lord's second coming. As such, it is immediately connected with<b> I come quickly</b> following),<b> to try them that dwell upon the earth</b> (see ch, viii. 13, &c., where the expression applies to those who are not of the church of Christ. In this great trial, the servants of Christ shall be kept safe, ch. vii. 3. The trial of the<i> temptation</i> will operate in two ways: on the faithful, by bringing out their fidelity; on the unfaithful and unbelieving, by hardening them in their impenitence, see ch. ix. 20, 21, xvi. 11, 21.<br><br> The Expositors have in many cases gone away from this broad and obvious meaning here, and have sought to identify the<i> hour of temptation</i> with various periods of trial and persecution of the<i> Church</i>: a line of interpretation carrying its own refutation with it in the very terms used in the text. Thus Grotius understands it of the persecution under Nero; Lyra, of the future increase of that under Domitian, which was raging as the Apostle wrote: others, of those under Trajan: others again, of the troubles which should arise on account of Antichrist, which is nearer the mark).
