<b> 12.]</b> The reward of the conqueror.<b> He that conquereth,</b><b> I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God</b> (i. e. he shall have a fixed and important. place in the glorified church hereafter. That this, and nothing referring to any honour or dignity in the church militant, or in that as leading on to the church triumphant is intended, is manifest from the whole diction of this passage, as well as from comparing the corresponding promises, which all refer to the blessings of the future state of glory. It is no objection to this view, that in the heavenly Jerusalem there is no temple, ch. xxi. 22: but rather a corroboration of it. That glorious city is all temple, and Christ’s victorious ones are its living stones and pillars. Thus as Düsterdieck well remarks, the imagery of the church militant, 1 Cor. iii. 16 ff.; Eph. ii. 19 ff.; 1 Pet. ii. 5 ff., is transferred to the church triumphant, but with this difference, that the saints are no longer the stones merely, but now the pillars themselves, standing in their immovable firmness. On<b> my</b><i> God</i>, see note on ch. ii. 7),<b> and out of it he shall never more go out</b> (the subject is not the<i> pillar</i>, but<i> he that conquereth;</i> and the sense, that he who is thus fixed in his eternal place as a pillar in the heavenly temple, will never more, from any cause, depart from it. Those Commentators who have understood the promise of the church<i> militant</i>, have been obliged to take the<i> going out</i> as passive, shall not<i> be cast out</i>. Lyra takes it in both senses— “neither by apostasy, nor by excommunication.” And. thus except that the latter word will have no place, we may well understand the general term here used: none shall thrust him out, nor shall he be any more in danger of falling, and thus thrusting himself out. It is well worth noticing the recorded fact, that Philadelphia was notorious for calamities by earthquake. The language in which Strabo deseribes this is remarkable in connexion with this promise of the pillar which should not be moved: “Philadelphia cannot trust to its walls, but day by day they are more or less shaken and crack. And the inhabitants always take into account these accidents of their land, and build with reference to its character.” And still more so in another place: “The city of Philadelphia is fall of earthquakes; the walls are constantly cracking, and some part or other of the city is always in trouble, wherefore the inhabitants are scanty.” Tacitus tells us, that in the reign of Tiberius, when the twelve cities of proconsular Asia were overthrown by an earthquake, Philadelphia suffered, and was in consequence excused its taxes, and in common with the others entrusted to a senatorian commissioner to repair):<b> and I will write upon him</b> (the conqueror; not the pillar)<b> the name of my God</b> (some think of the mitre breastplate of the high priests, on which was inscribed “Holiness to the Lord,” Exod. xxviii. 36. But this does not seem applicable here, where, from this and the following particulars, it is rather a blessed belonging to God and the holy city and Christ, that is imported, than the priestly office of the glorified Christian),<b> and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which descendeth out of heaven from my God</b> (on the whole, see ch. xxi. 2, 3, and notes. It is<i> possible</i>, that the name Jehovah Shammih, Ezek. xlviii. 35, may be meant; but hardly probable, seeing that the Holy Name itself has before been mentioned as inscribed
