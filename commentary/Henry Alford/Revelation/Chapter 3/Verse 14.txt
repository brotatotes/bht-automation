<b>And to the angel</b> (not, the bishop or ruler, see on ch. i. 20)<b> of the church in Laodicea write; These things saith the Amen</b> (see Isaiah. Christ is the Amen, inasmuch as His words shall never pass away, but shall find certain ratification. This, and not, the particular case which is treated in 2 Cor. i. 20, seems to be the reference here, where not the ratification of promises merely, but general fidelity and certainty are concerned: as Arethas says, “'This is the same as<i> these things saith the true One:</i> for Amen means yea. There is then<i> yea</i> in all things said of Him; i. e, all is truth, and none a lie”),<b> the faithful and true witness</b> (there does not seem in this title to be any allusion to the prophecies which are about to follow in ch. iv. ff. as some have imagined. Far rather does it substantiate the witness borne in the Epistle itself, as we have seen in the case of the other introductions),<b> the beginning of the creation of God</b> (see Col. i. 15, and note. In Him the whole creation of God is begun and conditioned: He is its source and primary fountain-head. The mere word<b> beginning</b> would admit the meaning that Christ is the first-created being: see Gen. xlix. 3; Deut. xxi. 17; and Prov. viii. 22. And so the Arians here take it, and some who have followed them. But every consideration of the requirements of the context, and of the Person of Christ as set forth to us in this book, is against any such view. Düsterdieck asks the questions, “How could Christ write if it were only this present Epistle, if He were himself a creature? How could every creature in heaven and earth adore Him, if He were one of themselves [ch. xix. 10]? We need only think of the appellation of our Lord as the Alpha and Omega [ch. xxii. 13: compare i. 8] in its necessary fulness of import, and we shall see that in the Alpha lies the necessity of His being the<b> beginning</b> of the Creation, in the Omega that of His coming to bring the visible creation to an end”):
