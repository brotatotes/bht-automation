<b>I advise thee</b> (there is a deep irony in this word. One who<i> has need of nothing,</i> yet needs counsel on the vital points of self-preservation)<b> to buy</b> (at the cost only of thy good self-opinion. That a<i> pauper</i> should be advised to<i> buy gold</i> and<i> raiment</i>, and<i> ointment</i>, might of itself shew what kind of buying is meant, even if Isa. lv. 1, “<i>Nay, without money and without price,</i>” had not clearly defined it. Yet notwithstanding such cléar warning not to go wrong, the Roman-Catholic expositors have here again handled the word of God deceitfully, and explained, as Lyra, “Buy, ie. with good works;” Cornelius-a-lapide, “The word<i> buy</i> signifies that a man must do many things and contribute many things in order to be fit to receive these gifts from God.” The term, in fact, continues the irony. “All this lofty self-sufficiency must be expended in the labour of getting from Me these absolute necessaries.” So most of the later expositors. So even the Roman-Catholic Stern, but disguising the truth under an appearance of<i> some</i> price being given: “What is the price? Has not the Lord Himself said that she is poor and pitiable and naked and wretched? She must give up her heart to Christ, her feelings, thoughts, and active work; must entirely give up herself to the Lord for His own possession, Matt. xiii. 45, 46”)<b> gold from me</b> (who am the source of all true spiritual wealth, Eph. iii. 8) [<b>fresh</b>]<b> burnt from the fire</b> (the<b> from</b> gives the sense of being just fresh from the burning or smelting, and thus not only tried by the process, but bright and new from the furnace. This is better than, with many Commentators, to make the<b> from</b> almost equivalent to<i> by</i>, signifying the source from which the<i> burning</i> comes.<br><br> In the interpretation, this gold represents all spiritual<i> wealth</i>, in its sterling reality, as contrasted with that merely imaginary sort on which the Laodiceans prided themselves. It is narrowing it too much to interpret it as<i> charity</i>, or<i> faith</i>, or indeed any one spiritual grace, as distinguished from the sum total of them all),<b> that thou mayest be</b> (literally, mayest have become, viz., by the purchase)<b> rich; and white garments</b> (Düsterdieck rightly remarks that the white garments are distinct from the gold only in being a different image in the form of expression, not really in the thing signified. On the meaning, see ver. 4, ch. vii. 14, xix. 8. The lack of<i> righteousness</i>, which can be only bought from Christ, and that at the price of all fancied righteousness of our own, is just as much a<i> poverty</i> as the other),<b> that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness be not made manifest</b> (the choice of the word seems as if some particular time were in view when such manifestation would take place. If we are to assign one, it will naturally be that of the Lord’s coming, when<i> “we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ,”</i> 2 Cor. v. 10: when the Lord of the Church will come to see his guests, and all not clad in the wedding robe will be cast out, Matt. xxii. 11 ff.);<b> and collyrium</b> (eye-salve; the use of which is apparent from what follows. The<i> collyrium</i> was so called from its shape, being a stick or roll of ointment for the eyes, in the shape of a bread-cake)<b> to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see</b> (in the spiritual interpretation, this collyrium will import the anointing of the Holy Spirit, which, like the gold of His unsearchable riches, and the white garment of His righteousness, is to be obtained from Him, John xvi. 7, 14; Acts ii. 33; and also at the price of the surrender of our own fancied wisdom. The analogy of 1 John ii. 20, 27 is not to be overlooked: see notes at those places).
