<b> 20.] Behold, I stand at the door, and knock</b> (the reference to Sol. Song, v. 2, is too plain to be for a moment doubted: and if so, the interpretation must be grounded in that conjugal relation between Christ and the church,—Christ and the soul,—of which that mysterious book is expressive. This being granted, we may well say, that the vivid depiction of Christ<i> standing at the door</i> is introduced, to bring home to the lukewarm and careless church the truth of His constant presence, which she was so deeply forgetting. His<i> knocking</i> was taking place partly by the utterance of these very rebukes, partly by every interference in judgment and in mercy. Whenever His hand is heard, He is knocking the door.

Song, v. 2,<i> “It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me”</i>),<b> and open the door</b> (literally, “shall have heard,” “shall have opened:” but it would he pedantry thus to render in our language. On the sense, see Sol. Song, v. 6.
