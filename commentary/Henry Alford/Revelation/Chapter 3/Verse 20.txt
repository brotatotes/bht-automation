<b> 20.] Behold, I stand at the door, and knock</b> (the reference to Sol. Song, v. 2, is too plain to be for a moment doubted: and if so, the interpretation must be grounded in that conjugal relation between Christ and the church,—Christ and the soul,—of which that mysterious book is expressive. This being granted, we may well say, that the vivid depiction of Christ<i> standing at the door</i> is introduced, to bring home to the lukewarm and careless church the truth of His constant presence, which she was so deeply forgetting. His<i> knocking</i> was taking place partly by the utterance of these very rebukes, partly by every interference in judgment and in mercy. Whenever His hand is heard, He is knocking the door. But it is not His hand only that may be heard: see below):<b> if any man hear my voice</b> (here we have more than the mere sound of his knock: He speaks. See Acts xii, 13 f., “<i>As Peter knocked at the door</i>”... “<i>when she knew Peter's voice.</i>”—In that case we must conceive Rhoda to have asked, “Who is there?” and Peter to have answered, It may not be uninstructive to fill up this connexion in a similar manner. “It is I,” is an answer the soul may often hear, if it will enquire the reason of an unexpected knock at the door of its slumbers; or we may compare Sol. Song, v. 2,<i> “It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me”</i>),<b> and open the door</b> (literally, “shall have heard,” “shall have opened:” but it would he pedantry thus to render in our language. On the sense, see Sol. Song, v. 6.<br><br> Our verse is a striking and decisive testimony to the practical freedom of our will to receive or reject the heavenly Guest: without. the recognition of which, the love and tenderness of the saying become a hideous mockery.<br><br> We then open the door to Christ, when we admit Him, His voice, His commands, His example, to a share in our inner counsels and sources of action. To say that this can be done<i> without</i> His grace, is ignorance: to say it is done only by that grace irresistibly exerted, is far worse,—it is, to deprive His gracious pleadings of all meaning),<b> I will enter in to him, and I will sup with him, and he with me</b> (the imagery is taken from the usages of intimate hospitality. But whereas in these it would be merely the guest who would sup with the host who lets him in, here the guest becomes himself the host, because He is the bread of life, and the Giver of the great feast of fat things and of the great marriage supper [Matt. viii. 11, xxv. 1 ff.; Rev. xix. 7, 9]. St. John is especially fond of reporting these sayings of reciprocity which our Lord uttered; compare John vi. 56 [x. 38], xiv. 20, xv. 4, 5, xvii. 21, 26. This blessed admission of Christ into our hearts will lead to His becoming our guest, ever present with us and sharing in all our blessings—and, which is even more, to our being ever in close union with Him, partaking ever of His fulness, until we sit down at His table in His Kingdom).—<b>He that conquereth</b> (see above, ch. ii. 26, and ver. 12, for the construction),<b> I will give to him to sit</b> (in the blessed life of glory hereafter: such promises cannot be regarded, as this by some, as partially fulfilled in this life: for thus the following analogy, “<i>as I also,</i>&c.” would fail)<b> with me</b> (compare Johu xvii. 24)<b> on my throne</b> (have a share in My kingly power, as ch. ii. 27, xx. 6),<b> as I also conquered,</b><b> and sat down with my Father on His throne</b> (the past tenses refer to the historical facts of the Resurrection and Ascension. By the latter, Christ sat down at the right hand of God, or of the throne of God, as Heb. xii. 2. No distinction must be made between the throne of the Father, on which Christ sits, and that of Christ, on which the victorious believer is to sit with Him: they are one and the same, called<i> “the throne of God and the Lamb,”</i> ch. xxii. 1; and the glory of the redeemed will be a participation in it of the Father and the Son, John xvii. 22).—Doubtless the occurrence of this, the highest and most glorious of all the promises, in this place, is to be explained not entirely from any especial aptness to the circumstances of the Laodicean church, though such has been attempted to be assigned [e. g. by Ebrard—because the victory over lukewarmness would be so much more difficult than that in any other case], but also from the fact of its occurring at the end of all the Epistles, and as it were gathering them all into one. Tt must not be forgotten too, that the words,<b> I sat down with my Father on His throne</b>, form a link to the next put of the book, where we soon, ch. v. 5, 6, read,<b> And I saw in the midst we ‘the throne... a Lamb standing, as it were slain.</b>
