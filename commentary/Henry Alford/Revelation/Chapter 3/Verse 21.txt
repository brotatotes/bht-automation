<p><strong> 21</strong> .] <strong> He that conquereth</strong> (see above, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+2:26">Revelation 2:26</span> , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span> , for the construction), <strong> I will give to him to sit</strong> (in the blessed life of glory hereafter: such promises cannot be regarded, as this by some, as partially fulfilled in this life: for thus the following analogy, ὡς κἀγὼ κ . τ . λ ., would fail. The final and complete act is also pointed out by the aor. καθίσαι ) <strong> with me</strong> (cf. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span> , πάτερ , ὃ δέδωκας ἐμοὶ θέλω ἵνα ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγὼ κἀκεῖνοι ὦσιν μετ ʼ ἐμοῦ ) <strong> on my throne</strong> (have a share in My kingly power, as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span> , Rev 20:6 ), <strong> as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on His throne</strong> (the aorr. refer to the historical facts of the Resurrection and Ascension. By the latter, Christ sat down at the right hand of God, or of the throne of God, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span> . No distinction must be made between the throne of the Father, on which Christ sits, and that of Christ, on which the victorious believer is to sit with Him: they are one and the same, cf. ἐκ τοῦ θρόνου τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἀρνίου , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span> ; and the glory of the redeemed will be a participation in that of the Father and the Son, Joh 17:22 ).

<p>Doubtless the occurrence of this, the highest and most glorious of all the promises, in this place, is to be explained not entirely from any especial aptness to the circumstances of the Laodicean church, though such has been attempted to be assigned (e. g. by Ebrard because the victory over luke-warmness would be so much more difficult than that in any other case), but also from the fact of its occurring at the end of all the Epistles, and as it were gathering them all into one. It must not be forgotten too, that the ἐκάθισα μετὰ τοῦ πατρός μου ἐν τῷ θρόνῳ αὐτοῦ forms a link to the next part of the book where we so soon, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span> , read καὶ εἶδον ἐν τῷ μέσῳ τοῦ θρόνου .… ἀρνίον ἑστηκὸς ὡς ἐσφαγμένον .</p>
