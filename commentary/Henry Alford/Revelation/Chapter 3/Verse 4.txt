Nevertheless</b> (notwithstanding this state of apathy even to spiritual death)<b> thou hast</b> (belonging to thee as members. Notice as Bengel remarks, that these few had not separated themselves from the church in Sardis, notwithstanding its degraded state)<b> a few names</b> ( “men who may be counted by name:” compare Acts i. 15; ch. xi. 13, note. The term would hardly be used except of a limited number)<b> in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments</b> (literally, did not defile: the past tense is from the standing-point of the future day presently introduced, as so commonly when life is looked back on from the great time of retribution. The meaning of the figure [which occurs also in Jude 23] has been variously given. There can be little doubt that the simpler and more general explanation is the right one: viz. who have not sullied the purity of their Christian life by falling into sin):<b> and they shall walk with me in white</b> (the white here is not to be identified with the undefiled garments which they now wear: it is a new and glorious hue of victory: see ch. vi. 11; vii. 9; xix. 8. The allusion which some have imagined, to their priesthood,—because when a judgment was held by the Sanhedrim on the priests, those who were condemned were clothed in black, while the blameless wore a white robe,—seems, like so many of these rabbinical illustrations, to be far-fetched, and to spoil the simplicity of the passage. An allusion to Zech. iii. 3 ff. is far more obvious.<b> with me</b>, in remarkable accord with our Lord’s prayer in John xvii. 21, “<i>Father, I will that they whom Thou hast given Me, where I am, there they also may be</i><b> with me:</b>” see also Luke xxiii. 43),<b> for they are worthy</b> (the<i> worthiness</i> here is found in the terms of the sentence itself. They have<i> kept their garments undefiled:</i> they of all others then are the persons who should walk in the glorious white robes of heavenly triumph. Exactly thus in ch. xvi. 5, 6,<i> “They shed blood, and thou gavest them blood to drink:</i><b> they are worthy.</b>” To dream of any merit here implied, is not only to miss, but to run counter to the sense of the whole saying and situation. The absence of defilement is only explained by ch. vii. 14,<i> “They washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb:”</i> and as Vitringa excellently says, “Un<i> worthiness</i> here marks the proportion and congruency which was between the state of grace in which they had been on earth, and of the glory which the Lord had decreed for them according to the measure of this very law of grace”).
