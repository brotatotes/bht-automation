<b>He that conquereth,</b><b> he</b> (the reading “<i>he that conquereth</i><b> thus</b>,” found in so many MSS., seems to have arisen originally in a very usual confusion of the long and short<i> o</i> in Greek, and then to have been retained, from not being altogether without meaning; “<i>thus</i>,” i.e. as those first mentioned)<b> shall be clad in white garments</b> (the concluding promise takes the hue of what had gone before, and identifies those just spoken of with these victorious ones):<b> and I will not wipe out his name out of the book of life</b> (this again takes its colour from the preceding. Those who have a name that they<i> live</i>, and are dead, are necessarily wiped out from the book of<i> life</i>: only he whose name is a living name, can remain on those pages. Here again the Rabbinical expositors have gone wrong in imagining that the genealogical tables of the priests are alluded to. Far rather is the reference to the ordinary lists of citizens, or of living members of any body or society, from which the dead are struck out. Thus they whose names have been once inscribed in this book, whether by their outward admission into Christ’s church in baptism, or by their becoming living members of Him by faith, if they endure to the end as His soldiers and servants, and obtain the victory, shall not, as all His mere professed members shall, have their names erased from it. The figure itself, of the book of life, is found as early as Exod. xxxii. 32 f.);<b> and I will his name in the presence of my Father and in the presence of his angels</b> (see Matt. x. 32; Luke xii. 8, both of which are here combined: see also Luke ix. 26; Mark viii. 38. The promise implies that in the great day the Judge will expressly acknowledge the name thus written in the book of life, as belonging to one of His. See ch. xx. 15, xxi. 27; also Matt. vii. 23, [xxv. 12], where He repudiates those whom He knows not).
