<b>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith the holy One</b> (as opposed to the<i> synagogue of Satan</i> below; not with reference to Christ’s High-priesthood, but expressive of moral attribute),<b> the true One</b> (this title would appear as if it were chosen to declare an attribute of our Lord, opposed to<i> “those who say... and are not, but do lie”</i> below),<b> he that hath the key of David</b> (i. e. He that is the Heir and Lord of the abiding theocracy. In Isa. xxii. 22, it is said of Eliakim son of Hilkiah,<i> “The key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open:”</i> which is manifestly the passage here incorporated into the Lord’s message: and the sense is that whatever inferior degrees there may be of this power of opening and shutting the church [<i>the house of David</i>, with reference to the false Jews below], the supreme power, the one true key, belongs to the Lord Christ alone. It is hardly justified, and serves but little purpose, to attempt to set up a distinction between “the key<i> of David</i>” here, and “the key of<i> the house of David</i>” in Isaiah. The key is the same in both cases: but the One possesses, it as his own by right, the other has it merely entrusted to him; laid on his shoulder.

Christ only has power to admit into and exclude from His kingdom; to enlarge the work and opportunities of His church, and to contract them):
