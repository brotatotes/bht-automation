<b>Behold. I give</b> (not,<i> to thee,</i> nor can we render it by<i> I</i><i> will make</i>, as the A.V.: the sense is broken off in the following clause, and the verb<b> give</b> resumed by<b> I will make them</b>)<b> of the synagogue of Satan</b> (see on ch. ii. 9, where the same expression occurs of outward Jews who were not real Jews),<b> who profess themselves to be Jews and they are not, but do lie,—behold, I will make them that they shall come, and shall worship before thy feet</b> (so in Isa. lx. 14, “The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee: and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet: and they shall call thee the city of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.” See also Isa. xlix. 23; Zech. viii. 20–23),<b> and that they may know that I loved thee</b> (the English idiom requires, “have loved thee:” but the past tense has its propriety, referring as it does to the time preceding that in which they shall do this. Düsterdieck takes it as used of that great proof which Christ gave of His love by dying for His church, appealing to the same tense in Eph. v. 25; Gal. ii. 20; 1 John iv. 10, 11. But thus we lose the especial reference to the particular church which seems to be involved in the recognition. It is the love bestowed on the Philadelphian church, in signalizing its success in the work of Christ, that these converted enemies shall recognize).
