<b> 1.]</b><b> After these things</b> (or,<i> “after this,”</i>—is a formula frequently occurring in this book, and nowhere indicating a break in the ecstatic state of the Seer, but only the succession of separate visions. Those are mistaken, e.g. Bengel, Hengstenberg, who imagine an interval, here and in the other places, during which the Seer wrote déwn that which had been previously revealed to him. The whole is conceived as imparted in one continuous revelation consisting of many parts. See below on ver. 2)<b> I saw</b> (not with the bodily eye, but with the eye of ecstatic vision, as throughout the book. He is throughout<i> in the Spirit</i>. It is not<i> I looked</i>, as in A.V.: not the directing of the Seer’s attention which discovers the door to him, but the simple reception of the vision which is recorded),<b> and, behold, a door set open</b> (not,<i> was opened</i>, us A, V. which gives the idea that the Seer witnessed the act of opening. For the same reason the word<i> “opened”</i> is objectionable, as it may be mistaken for the past tense of the neuter verb<i> to open</i>)<b> in heaven</b> (notice the difference between this vision and that in Ezek. i. 1; Matt. iii. 16; Acts vii. 56, x. 11. In those, the heaven itself parts asunder, and discloses the vision to these below on earth: here the heaven, the house or palace of God [Ps. xi. 4, xviii. 6, xxix. 9], remains firmly shut to those on earth, but a door is opened, and the Seer is rapt in the Spirit through it. Henceforth usually he looks from the heaven down on the earth, seeing however both alike, and being present in either, as the localities of his various visions require):<b> and the former voice</b> (much confusion has been introduced here by rendering, as A.V.,<i> “the first voice which,”</i>&c., giving the idea that it means,<i> first after</i> the door was seen set open; whereas it is<i> the voice which I heard at first,</i> viz. in ch. i, 10)<b> which I heard</b> (at the beginning)<b> as of a trumpet speaking with me</b> (viz. ch. i. 10. This clause is not predicative, “<i>was</i> as...” as A.V. and Treg. The construction simply is— “behold, a door... and the voice...,” both clauses being dependent on “<b>behold</b>.”—The voice is not that of Christ, but of some undefined heavenly being or angel. As Düsterdieck observes, all we can say of it is that it is the<i> same voice</i> as that in ch. i. 10, which there, ver. 17, is followed by that of our Lord, not “<i>as of a trumpet</i>,” but “<i>as of many waters</i>,” as stated by anticipation in ver. 15),<b> saying, Come up hither</b> (viz. through the opened door),<b> and I will shew thee</b> (it is surprising how Stier can allege this<b> I will shew thee</b> as a proof that the Lord Himself only can be speaking: compare ch. xxi. 9, 10, xxii. 8, 9, which latter place is decisive against him)<b> the things which must</b> (of prophetic necessity)<b> take place after these things</b> (so literally: viz., the things now present: as in ch. i. 19, but the<i> things</i> not being the same in the two cases. So that<b> after these things</b> has very much the general meaning given by the “<i>hereafter</i>” of the A.V.: this clause corresponds to “which are about to happen after these things” of ch. i. 19).
