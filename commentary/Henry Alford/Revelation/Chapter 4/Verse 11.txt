Thou art worthy, O Lord and our</b> (Düsterdieck remarks that the<b> our</b> has a force here peculiarly belonging to the 24 elders, as representing the redeemed, and thus standing in a covenant relation to God nearer than that of the 4 living-beings. But we must not forget, that Creation is only a part of Redemption, Col. i. 20)<b> God, to receive the glory</b> (the<i> glory</i>&c., as alluding to the<i> glory</i>&c. ver. 9, ascribed by the living-beings. The articles are improperly omitted in the A.V.)<b> and the honour and the might</b> (observe that<b> the might</b>, in the mouth of the 24 elders, represents<i> thanksgiving</i> in that of the 4 living-beings, The elders, though themselves belonging to creation, in this ascription of praise look on creation from without, and that thanksgiving, which creation renders for its being, becomes in their view a tribute to Him who<i> called them into being</i>, and thus a testimony to His creative power. And thus the reason follows):<b> because Thou didst create all things</b> ( “this universal whole,” the universe),<b> and on account of Thy will</b> (i. e., beemise Thou didst will it:<i> “for thy pleasure,”</i> of the A.V., introduces an element entirely strange to the context, and, however true in fact, most inappropriate here, where the<b> because</b> renders a reason for the worthiness to receive the glory, honour, and power)<b> they were</b> (not exactly<i> came into being</i>: for this the word cannot signify: nor again, though thus the requirement of the<i> word</i> would be satisfied,<i> were</i>, in thy decree from eternity, before they were created: nor again as Bengel, “all things<i> were</i>, from the creation down to the time of this ascription of praise and henceforward.” The best explanation is that of Düsterdieck,<i> they existed</i>, as in contrast to their previous non-existence: whereby not their<i> coming into</i> being, but the simple fact of their being, is asserted. A remarkable reading of some of our MSS. is worth notice: “by reason of Thy will they<b> were not</b>, and were created?” i.e., “they were created out of nothing”),<b> and were created</b> (they both had their being—and received it from Thee by a definite act of Thine).
