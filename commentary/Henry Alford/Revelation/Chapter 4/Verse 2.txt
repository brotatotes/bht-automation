<b> 2.] Immediately I was</b> (became)<b> in the Spirit</b> (i. e. I experienced a new accession of the Spirit’s powerful influence, which transported me thither: “I was in a trance of ecstasy:” see on ch. i. 10. It is hardly credible that any scholar should have proposed to understand “<i>there</i>” after<b> was</b>, “immediately I<i> was there</i> in the Spirit:” but this was done by Züllig, and has found an advocate in England in Dr. Maitland):<b> and, behold, a throne stood</b> (the A.V. “<i>was set</i>,” gives too much the idea that the<i> placing</i> of the throne formed part of the on: “<i>lay</i>” would be our best word, but we do not use it of any thing so lofty as a throne. I have therefore adopted<b> was there</b>, as best, indicating mere position)<b> in heaven, and upon the throne one sitting</b> (called henceforward throughout the book,<b> He that sitteth upon the throne</b>, and being the Eternal Father [not as Lyra,<i> the Three-One God;</i> for He that sitteth on the throne is distinguished in ch. vi. 16, vii. 10 from the Son, and in ver. 5 from the Holy Spirit]: see ch. vii. 10, xix. 4, where we read expressly “<i>to God that sitteth</i><i> upon the throne.”</i> So that it is not for the reasons sometimes suggested, that the Name is not expressed: e.g. on account of the Jewish unwillingness to express the sacred Name: or, that the mind has no figure and the tongue no word by which to express it. The simple reason seems to be, as assigned by Hengstenberg and Düsterdieck, that St. John would describe simply that which he saw,<i> as</i> he saw it. For the same reason he does not name Christ expressly in the first vision, ch. i. 13);<b> and he that sat</b> (no need to supply “<i>was:</i>” the nominatives are all correlative after<b> behold</b>)<b> like in appearance</b> (lit. “<i>in</i><i> vision</i>,” “<i>in sight</i>,” as A.V. in the next clause)<b> to a jasper and sardine stone</b> (the<b> jasper</b> appears to have been a beautiful stone of various wavy colours, semi-opaque, granulous in texture, used in ancient times for gems and ornaments, but in more modern ones on a larger scale for pavements and tables. The altar in Canterbury Cathedral stands on a platform of yellow jasper pavement, 30 feet by 14 feet. The<b> sardine</b> is a red stone, commonly supposed to answer to our cornelian. But Epiphanius, in his treatise on the twelve stones in Aaron’s breastplate, says of it, that it is a Babylonian stone, blood red in colour, like the gleam of the<i> sardine</i> fish when pickled, and semi-opaque. Several of the Commentators have said much on the symbolic significance of these stones as representing the glory of God. Thus much only seems, in the great uncertainty and variety of views, to stand firm for us: that if the<b> jasper</b> is to be taken as in ch. xxi. 11, as, by the reference there to<i> the glory of God</i> it certainly seems it must, then it represents a watery crystalline brightness, whereas the<b> sardine</b> is on all hands acknowledged to be fiery red. Thus we shall have ample material for symbolic meaning: whether, as some take it, of the one great judgment by water [or of baptism], and the other by fire,—as others, of the goodness of God in nature [jasper being taken as<i> green</i>] and His severity in judgment,—as Ansbert, of the divinity and humanity [because His humanity at the time of His passion was tinged with blood], &c., or as the moderns mostly, of the holiness of God and His justice. This last seems to me the more probable, especially as the same mixture of white light with fire seems to pervade the Old Testament and Apocalyptic visions of the divine majesty. Compare Ezek. i. 4, viii. 2; Dan. vii, 9: and our ch. i. 14, x. 1. But nothing can be confidently asserted, in our ignorance of the precise import of the<i> jasper</i>):<b> and a rainbow</b> (Gen. ix. 12–17; Ezek. i. 28)<b> round about the throne</b> (i. e. in all probability, surrounding the throne vertically, as a nimbus; not horizontally),<b> like to the appearance</b><b> of an emerald</b> (on this name, in Greek “<i>smaragdus</i>,” all seem agreed, that it represents the stone so well known among us as the<i> emerald</i>, of a lovely green colour. Almost all the Commentators think of the gracious and federal character of the bow of God, Gen. ix. 12–17. Nor is it any objection to this that the bow or glory here is green, instead of prismatic: the<i> form</i> is that of the covenant bow, the colour even more refreshing and more directly symbolizing grace and mercy, So far at least, we may be sure of as to the symbolism of this appearance of Him that sitteth on the throne: that the brightness of His glory and fire of His judgment is ever girded by, and found within, the refreshment and surety of His mercy and goodness. So that, as Düsterdieck says well, “This fundamental vision contains all that may serve for terror to the enemies, and consolation to the friends, of Him that sitteth on the throne...”).
