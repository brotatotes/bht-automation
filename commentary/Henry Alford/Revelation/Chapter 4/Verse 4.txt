<b> 4.]</b><i> The assessors of the enthroned One.</i>—The construction after<b> behold</b> still continues.<b> And round the throne twenty-four thrones</b> (i. e.) evidently smaller thrones, and probably lower than<b> the throne</b>):<b> and upon the twenty-four thrones, elders sitting,</b><b> clothed in white garments; and on their heads golden crowns</b> (these twenty-four elders are not<i> angels</i>, as maintained by some, as is shewn [not by ch. v. 9, as generally argued, even by Elliott, vol. i.p. 81 f.: see text there: but] by their white robes and crowns, the rewards of<i> endurance</i>, ch. iii. 5, ii. 10,—but<i> representatives of the Church</i>, as generally understood. But if so, what sort of representatives, and why twenty-four in number? This has been variously answered. The usual understanding has been that of our earliest Commentator, Victorinus; who says, “twelve Apostles, and as many Patriarchs.” And this is in all probability right in the main: the key to the interpretation being the<i> analogy with</i> the sayings of our Lord to the Apostles, Matt. xix. 28; Luke xxii. 30. That those sayings do not regard the<i> same</i> session as this, is no argument against the inference from analogy. The Abbot Joachim brings against this view that the twelve patriarchs were not personally holy men, and never are held up as distinguished in the Old Testament. But this obviously is no valid objection. It is not the personal characters, but the symbolical, that are here in question. It might be said with equal justice that the number of the actual Apostles is not definitely twelve. It is no small confirmation of the view, that in ch. xv. 3, we find the double idea of the church, as made up of Old Testament and New Testament saints, plainly revealed to St. John; for he heard the victorious saints sing<i> the song of Moses</i>, and<i> the song of the Lamb</i>. See also ch, xxi. 12, 14, where the twelve<i> gates</i> of the New Jerusalem are inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes, and its twelve<i> foundations</i> with those of the twelve Apostles. Various other interpretations are given in my Greck Test.).
