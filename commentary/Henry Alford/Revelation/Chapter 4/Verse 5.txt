<b> 5.]</b><b> And out of the throne go forth</b> (the tense is changed, and the narrative assumes the direct form, which, however, is immediately dropped again, and the accumulation of details resumed)<b> lightnings and voices and thunders</b> (the imagery seems to be in analogy with that in the Old Testament, where God’s presence to give his law was thus accompanied: Exod. xix. 16; where lightnings and voices occur in juxtaposition as here. If this idea be correct, then we have here represented the sovereignty and almightiness of God):<b> and seven lamps</b> the former construction is resumed)<b> of fire burning before the throne</b> [<b>itself</b>],<b> which are the seven Spirits of God</b> (see notes on ch. i. 4, v. 6. These seem to represent the Holy Spirit in his sevenfold working: in his enlightening and cheering as well as his purifying and consuming agency. So most Commentators. De Wette and Ebrard regard the representation as that of the Holy Spirit, the principle of physical and spiritual life, which appears only wrong by being too limited. Hengstenberg is quite beside the mark in confidently [as usual]<i> confining</i> the interpretation of the lamps of fire to the consuming power of the Spirit in judgment. The fact of the parallel ch. v. 6 speaking of<i> seven eyes</i>, and such texts as ch. xxi. 23; Ps. cxix. 105, should have kept him from this mistake. The whole of this glorious vision is of a composite and twofold nature: comfort is mingled with terror, the fire of love with the fire of judgment):{6}<b>and before</b><b> the throne as it were a sea of glass</b> (not, “<i>glassy</i>,” as rendered by Elliott: the word describes not the appearance, but the material, of the sea: it appeared like a sea of glass—so clear, and so calm)<b> like to caystal</b> (and that not common glass, which among the ancients was, as we see from its remains, cloudy and semi-opaque, but like rock crystal for transparency and beauty, as Victorinus, “clear water, steady, unruffled by the wind.” Compare by way of contrast her that sitteth on the<i> many waters</i>, the multitudinous and turbulent waters, ch. xvii. 1.—In seeking the explanation of this, we must first track the image from its Old Test. earlier usage. There, in Exod. xxiv. 10, we have in the Septuagint version, “<i>And they saw the place where the God of Israel stood: and that which was under His feet was as it were work of sapphire bricks, and as the appearance of the firmament of heaven in its purity.”</i> Compare with this Ezek. i. 22, “<i>And the likeness over the heads of the living beings themselves was as it were a firmament, stretched out over their wings above.</i>” In Job xxvii. 18 also, the sky is said to be “as a molten looking-glass.” If we are to follow these indices, the primary reference will be to the clear ether in which the throne of God is upborne: and the intent of setting this space in front of the throne will be, to betoken its separation and insulation from the place where the Seer stood, and indeed from all else around it. The material and appearance of this pavement of the throne seem chosen to indicate majestic repose and ethereal purity. All kinds of symbolic interpretations, more or less fanciful, have been given. See some of them specified in my Greek Testament).<b> And in the midst of the throne</b> (not, as Hengstenberg,<i> under</i> the throne: their movements are free, see ch. xv. 7. See below),<b> and round about the throne</b> (i. e. so that in the Apostle’s view they partly hid the throne, partly overlapped the throne, being symmetrically arranged with regard to it, i.e., as the number necessitates, one in the midst of each side),<b> four living beings</b> (the A.V., “<i>beasts</i>,” is the most unfortunate word that could be imagined. A far better one is that now generally adopted,<i> “living-creatures:”</i> the only objection to it being that when we come to vv. 9, 11, we give the idea, in conjoining<i> “living-creatures”</i> and<i> “created,”</i> of a close relation which is not found in the Greek. I have therefore preferred<i> living-beings</i>, or,<b> beings</b>, which gives the same idea)<b> full of eyes before and behind</b> (this, from their respective positions, could be seen by St. John; their faces being naturally towards the throne. On the symbolism, see below).{7}<b>And the first living-being like to a lion, and the second living-being like to a steer</b> (the Greek word is not necessarily to be pressed to its proper primary meaning, as indicating the young calf in distinction from the grown bullock: the Septuagint use it for an ox generally),<b> and the third living-being having its face as of a man</b> (or,<b> the face of a man</b>),<b> and the fourth living-being like to a flying</b><b> eagle.{8}And the four living-beings, each of them having six wings apiece. All round and within</b> (I prefer much putting a period at<b> apiece</b>, to carrying on the construction; as more in accord with the general style of this description.<br><br> Understand, after both<i> around</i>, and<i> within</i>,—<b>their wings</b>: the object of St. John being to shew, that the six wings in each case did not interfere with that which he had before declared, viz. that they were<i> full of eyes before and behind</i>. Round the outside of each wing, and up the inside of each [half-expanded] wing, and of the part of the body also which was in that inside recess)<b> they are full of eyes: and they have no rest by day and by night</b> (these words may belong either to “<i>have no rest,</i>” or to “<i>saying.</i>” I prefer joining it with the latter),<b> saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty</b> (so far is identical with the seraphim’s ascription of praise in Isa. vi. 3:<b> Almighty</b> answering usually, the Septuagint to<i> Sabaoth</i>, though not in that place),<b> which was, and which is, and which is to come</b> (see on ch. i. 8).<br><br> These four living-beings are in the main identical with the cherubim of the Old Test. [compare Ezek. i, 5–10, x. 20], which are called by the same name of living-creatures, and are similarly described. We may trace however some differences. In Ezekiel’s vision, each living-being has all four faces, Ez. i. 6, whereas here the four belong severally, one to each. Again in Ezekiel’s vision, it is apparently the<i> wheels</i> which are full of eyes, Ezek. i. 18; though in ch. x. 12, it would appear as if the animals also were included. Again, the having<i> six</i> wings apiece is not found in the cherubim of Ezekiel, which have<i> four</i>, Ezek. i. 6,—but belongs to the seraphim described in Isa. vi. 2, to whom also [see above] belongs the ascription of praise here given. So that these are forms compounded out of the most significant particulars of more than one Old Test. vision.<br><br> In enquiring after their symbolic import, we are met by the most remarkable diversity of interpretation. 1) Our earliest Commentator, Victorinus, may serve as the type of those who have understood them to symbolize the Four Evangelists, or rather,<i> Gospels:</i>— “The animal like a<i> lion</i> is the Gospel according to Mark, in which the voice of a lion roaring in the desert is heard, the voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord. Under the figure of a<i> man</i>, Matthew strives to announce to us the generation of Mary from whom Christ received flesh. So while he enumerates from Abraham to David and Joseph, he has spoken as of a man. Therefore his preaching shews the effigy of a<i> man</i>. Luke, while he tells of the priesthood of Zacharias offering a victim for the people, and the angel appearing to him,—on account of the priesthood, and the description of the victim, is represented by an<i> ox</i>. And the Evangelist John, like an<i> eagle</i>, taking wing and hastening up to loftier things, treats of the Word of God.” I have cited this comment at length, to shew on what fanciful and untenable ground it rests. For with perhaps the one exception of the last of the four, not one of the Evangelists has any inner or substantial accordance with the character thus assigned. Consequently these characteristics are found varied, and that in the earliest writer whom the view can be traced, viz. Irenæus, who makes the lion to be the gospel of St. John; the steer that of St. Luke, as above; the man, that of St. Matthew; the eagle, that of St. Mark. So also Andreas. But again Augustine attributes the lion to St. Matthew, the man to St. Mark, the steer to St. Luke, and the eagle to St. John. These notices may again serve to shew with what uncertainty the whole view is beset. It has nevertheless been adopted by Jerome, Primasius, Bede, and many others of old, and among the moderns by Williams [on the Study of the Gospels, pp. 1–92], Scott [Interpretation of the Apocalypse, p. 132, but making, as Augustine above, the lion, St. Matthew; the man, St. Mark; the ox, St. Luke; and the eagle, St. John], Wordsworth [Lectures on the Apocalypse, p. 116, who, as in his statements on the other details, so here, ascribes unanimity [see below!] to the ancients: “in them<i> the ancient church</i> beheld a figure of the four gospels,” suppressing also the fact of discrepancies in the application to the individual gospels], &c. The principal of the other interpretations prevalent among the ancients and moderns have been: 2) the 4 elements: 3) the 4 cardinal virtues: 4) the 4 faculties and powers of the human soul: 5) Our Lord in the fourfold great events of Redemption: 6) the 4 patriarchal-churches: the lion being Jerusalem, for its constancy; the ox, Antioch, for its obedience; the man, Alexandria, for its human learning; the eagle, Constantinople, for having produced the men of most elevated contemplation: and Cornelius-a-lapide, who adopts this, interprets the throne of God to be “the see of Rome, in which sits the lion of God:” 7) the 4 great Apostles, Peter, fervent as the<i> lion:</i> James the Lord’s brother, patient as the<i> ox:</i> Matthew, good as the<i> man:</i> Paul, always flying about as the<i> eagle:</i> 8) all the doctors of the church: 9) four orders of churchmen, pastors, deacons, doctors, contemplatives: 10) the 4 representatives of the New Test. church, as the four standards of the tribes Reuben, Judah, Ephraim, and Dan, which are traditionally thus reported [see also Num. ii.], were of the Old Test. church: 11) the 4 virtues of the Apostles, magnanimity, beneficence, equity, wisdom: 12) the 4 principal angels: 13) the angelic, or equal-to-angelic, state of the glorified church: so Elliott, vol. i.p. 87. But thus we have no account given of the peculiar symbolism of these living-beings, nor of the part which they perform in the act of praise below. There are many other interpretations and ramifications of interpretation, hardly worth recounting. But the one which above all these seems to me to require our notice is that which is indicated in the rabbinical sentence cited by Schöttgen here: “There are four which hold pre-eminence in this world: man among all animals; the eagle among birds; the ox among cattle; the lion among beasts.” The four cherubic forms are the representatives of animated nature—of God’s sentient creation. In Ezekiel, each form is compounded of the four. Here, the four forms are distinct. There [xxviii. 12], where the prince of Tyrus is compared to one of them, it is called the impression of similitude, and the crown of beauty: in Isaiah vi. where the seraphim, which enter into the composition of these living-beings, ascribe holiness to Jehovah, they cry, “His glory is the fulness of the whole earth.” With this view every thing that follows is in accordance. For when these, and the 24 elders, in vv. 9–11, fall down before the throne, the part which these living-beings bear in the great chorus of praise is sufficiently indicated by the reason which they give for their ascription, viz.<i> for Thou art worthy</i>,<b> because</b><b> Thou didst create all things</b>,<i> and because of Thy will they were, and were created.</i> The objection brought against this view by Ebrard, viz. that Behemoth, the king of the waters, is not here represented, is mere trifling. He forgets that in the record of creation, the noblest of the creatures sprung from the waters are not fishes, but birds; and that the eagle represents both. It is in strict accordance also with this view, that these living-beings are full of eyes, ever wakeful, ever declaring the glory of God: that they have each six wings, which doubtless are to be taken as in Isa. vi. from which the figure comes— “with twain he covered his face [<i>reverence</i>, in not venturing to look on the divine majesty], and with twain he covered his feet [<i>humility</i>, hiding his own created form from the glory of the Creator], and with twain he did fly [<i>obedience</i>, readiness to perform the divine commands].” This view is taken by the best of the modern Commentators: by Herder, De Wette, Rinck, Hengstenberg, Düsterdieck. Ebrard differs only in this, that he regards them as symbolic not of creation itself, but of the creative power of God. Stern, whose commentary on this whole passage is very able and beautiful, inclines rather to take them as representing the power of divine grace within the church of God: but in his usual interpretation treats them as “the whole creative-life of nature.” See also my Hulsean Lectures for 1841, vol. i. Lecture ii.<br><br> We have thus the throne of God surrounded by His Church and His animated world: the former represented by the 24 elders, the latter by the four living-beings.
