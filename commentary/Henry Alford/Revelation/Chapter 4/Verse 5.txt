If this idea be correct, then we have here represented the sovereignty and almightiness of God):<b> and seven lamps</b> the former construction is resumed)<b> of fire burning before the throne</b> [<b>itself</b>],<b> which are the seven Spirits of God</b> (see notes on ch. i. 4, v. 6. These seem to represent the Holy Spirit in his sevenfold working: in his enlightening and cheering as well as his purifying and consuming agency. So most Commentators. De Wette and Ebrard regard the representation as that of the Holy Spirit, the principle of physical and spiritual life, which appears only wrong by being too limited. Hengstenberg is quite beside the mark in confidently [as usual]<i> confining</i> the interpretation of the lamps of fire to the consuming power of the Spirit in judgment. The fact of the parallel ch. v. 6 speaking of<i> seven eyes</i>, and such texts as ch. xxi. 23; Ps. cxix. 105, should have kept him from this mistake. The whole of this glorious vision is of a composite and twofold nature: comfort is mingled with terror, the fire of love with the fire of judgment):{6}<b>and before</b><b> the throne as it were a sea of glass</b> (not, “<i>glassy</i>,” as rendered by Elliott: the word describes not the appearance, but the material, of the sea: it appeared like a sea of glass—so clear, and so calm)<b> like to caystal</b> (and that not common glass, which among the ancients was, as we see from its remains, cloudy and semi-opaque, but like rock crystal for transparency and beauty, as Victorinus, “clear water, steady, unruffled by the wind.” Compare by way of contrast her that sitteth on the<i> many waters</i>, the multitudinous and turbulent waters, ch. xvii. 1.—In seeking the explanation of this, we must first track the image from its Old Test. earlier usage. There, in Exod. xxiv. 10, we have in the Septuagint version, “<i>And they saw the place where the God of Israel stood: and that which was under His feet was as it were work of sapphire bricks, and as the appearance of the firmament of heaven in its purity.”</i> Compare with this Ezek. i. 22, “<i>And the likeness over the heads of the living beings themselves was as it were a firmament, stretched out over their wings above.</i>” In Job xxvii. 18 also, the sky is said to be “as a molten looking-glass.” If we are to follow these indices, the primary reference will be to the clear ether in which the throne of God is upborne: and the intent of setting this space in front of the throne will be, to betoken its separation and insulation
