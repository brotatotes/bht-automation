<b> 1.]</b><i> The sealed book.</i><b> And I saw</b> (notice, that from the general vision, in the last chapter, of the heavenly Presence of God, the scene is so far only changed that, all that remaining as described, a particular incident is now seen for the first time, and is introduced by<b> And I saw</b>) (lying)<b> on the right hand</b> (i. e. the right hand was open, and the book lay on the open hand. So in ch. xx. 1, where see note. The common rendering,<i> in</i> the right hand, misses this sense. The lying on the open hand imports. that<i> on God’s part</i> there was no withholding of His future purposes as contained in this book. The only obstacle to unsealing it was as follows, ver. 3)<b> of Him that sat upon the</b><b> throne a book</b> (i. e., “a roll of a book,” as in Ezek. ii. 9 f. This explanation alone will suit the meaning of the word as applied to the contemporary practice regarding sacred writings. See also Jer. xxxvi. 2, 23; Zech. v. 2: and below)<b> written within and behind</b> (such scrolls, written not only, as commonly, on the inner side, but also on the outer, which, to one reading the inner, was<i> behind</i> [see below], are mentioned by Pliny, Lucian, Juvenal, and Martial. This writing, within and without, so that the whole roll was full, seems to betoken the<i> completeness</i> of the contents as containing the divine counsels: there was no room for addition to that which was therein written. This would be of itself a sufficient reason for the<i> fulness</i> of the scroll. To see two<i> divisions of written matter</i> indicated, by the writing within, and by that on the back, correspondent to one another, seems hardly warranted by the text),<b> fast-sealed with seven seals</b> (not, consisting of seven writings, each sealed with one seal, as various Commentators hold: but one book, fastened with seven seals, which were visible to the Apostle. Various ingenious methods have been imagined, by which the opening of each of these seals may have loosened a corresponding portion of the roll. But they all proceed on the assumption that the roll in the vision was<i> unfolded</i>, which is nowhere to be gathered from the text. Nor have we any right to say that the separate visions which follow the opening of each seal are identical with<i> separate portions</i> of writing on the roll. These visions are merely symbolic representations of the progress of God’s manifestation of the purpose of His will; but no portion of the roll is actually unfolded, nor is any thing read out of the book. Not its contents, but the gradual stops of access to it, are represented by these visions. What is<i> in</i> that book, shall not be known, until there shall be known to the powers and authorities in the heavenly places, by the Church, the manifold wisdom of God, Eph. iii. 10: till those material events, which marked the gradual opening of the sum of God’s purposes, are all past, and the roll is contemplated in its completeness by the spirits of the glorified hereafter. This<i> completeness</i> is here set forth to us again by the mystic number<i> seven.</i> There are some excellent remarks on the entire distinctness<i> of the opening of the seals,</i> and the<i> reading of the book</i>, in Cornelius-a-lapide: “For nothing in the book would be read, except after the opening of all seven seals; for when all were opened, then at length the book could be opened and read, not before.” So also Ribera: “Those calamities which were involved in the seals, were all to come, before the things which were written in the book appeared and were known.”<br><br> Mr. Elliott, in his work “Apocalypsis Alfordiana,” specially directed against my commentary on this book, treats this view with all the scorn which is unfortunately so characteristic of him: calling it absurd, unscriptural, &c. He has not produced a word of proof, or even illustrative corroboration, of his own view, that the opening of each seal corresponds to the unrolling of a certain portion of the scroll: but has contented himself with re-asserting it in the strongest language, and pouring contempt on those who hold the other view. I grieve to say, that this is so often the case throughout his above-mentioned work, as to render it impossible for me, in many places, to meet his objections in argument. One who distrusts his own as well as all other explanations, and believes that much of this mysterious book is as yet unfathomed, is no match for one who hesitates not on every occasion to shew his confidence that he is in the right, and all who differ from him are wrong.<br><br> An enquiry here arises,<i> What is represented by this Book?</i> Opinions have been very various. 1) Some of our earliest Commentators understood by it the Old Testament: or the Old and New conjoined. It will appear from the extracts given in my Greek Test., that the opening of the seals was very generally by the earlier fathers and interpreters taken to mean, the fulfilment, and consequent bringing to light, of Old Test. prophecy by the events of Redemption as accomplished in the Person of our Lord. But, if so, then this view cannot consist with what follows in the Apocalypse. For manifestly the opening of the seals, as notified by the symbolic visions belonging to each, does not relate to things past, but to things which were yet future when this book was written. Nor can this apparent consensus of the early expositors be cited, as it has been e.g. by Dr. Adams, im support of any<i> other</i> view than theirs, in which this Book shall still represent the Old Test. Such for example is that of Dr. Adams himself, who regards the opening of the scaled Book as symbolizing a future republication of the genuine text of the Old Test., by which the Jewish people is to be converted. The untenableness of this view appears at once, if only from [so to speak] its touching the apocalyptic course of visions at this point only, and finding no justification or expansion in any of the symbolic visions accompanying the opening of the seals. 2) Some have held the Book to be<i> Christ Himself</i>. But for the same reasons as above, neither can this be maintained. 3) Wetstein takes it to be “the writing of divorcement written hy God against the Jewish nation:” which for the same reason falls to the ground. 4) Schöttgen, the sentence pronounced by the Judge and His assessors against the enemies of the Church: and similarly, in the main, Hengstenberg: but this view, though strongly defended hy Hengstenberg, is not borne out by the contents of these chapters. 5) Aleasar holds it to be that part of the Apocalypse which treats of the opening of the seven seals [ch. vi.—xi.]: and nearly so Hengstenberg also, except that he allows only from vi. 1 to viii. 1 for this portion. But both are obviously wrong, seeing that the opening of the seventh seal evolves a series of symbolic actions which only ends with the book itself. So that this comes to 6) the Book being the Apocalypse itself: so Cornelius-a-lapide, seeing in the seven seals that part relating to their opening, and after that regarding the subsequent visions concerning Antichrist and the end of the world, as the<i> contents of the book itself.</i> But he seems, in concluding his paragraph, to resolve this view into the wider one, 7) that the Book represents “the deliberation and decision of the Divine Providence, wherein God determined with Himself to do or permit, &c.” This is very nearly that of Arethas, Lyra, Vitringa, Mede, Ewald, De Wette, Stern, Düsterdieck, and others, And this is, in the main, my own view. We may observe, that it is in fact but a limitation of this meaning, when many understand the Book to contain the prophetic fortunes of the Church of Christ: but also that it is a limitation which has arisen from the mistake noticed above, of confounding the opening of the seals with the reading of the contents of the book. Those successive openings, or if we will, the fortunes and periods of the Church and world, are but so many preparations for that final state of perfection in which the Lamb shall reveal to the Church the contents of the Book itself).
