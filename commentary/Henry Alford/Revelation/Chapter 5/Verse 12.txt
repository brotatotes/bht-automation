<b>saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the â€œLamb that hath been slain to receive</b> (by way of<i> ascribed praise:</i> see ch. iv. 11 and note)<b> the power and riches and wisdom</b><b> and strength and honour and glory and blessing</b> (here, as in ch. vii. 12, but in differing order, we have<i> seven</i> particulars of ascription. But here there is a difference both from ch. vii. 12 and iv. 11. In each of those places the article<b> the</b> is repeated before each particular: here, one article includes them all. Bengel well remarks, that we must regard them all as if they formed but one word, And when they are thus regarded, the article seems to point out the fact of all these, as one, belonging to God, whose power and glory the Lamb is declared worthy to share.<br><br> Of the particulars themselves,<b> riches</b> is better kept in its generality, all riches and fulness, than limited to<i> spiritual</i> riches; see 1 Chron. xxix. 11:<b> blessing</b> is in the sense so frequent when the word and its cognate verb are used of an act passing from man to God: viz. that of ascribed praise: the<i> will</i> on the part of the creature, though unaccompanied by the<i> power</i>, to return blessing for blessing conferred. The idea of Bengel, that the septenary number has to do with the seven seals, is hardly probable: the number, as indicating completeness, running through the whole book).
