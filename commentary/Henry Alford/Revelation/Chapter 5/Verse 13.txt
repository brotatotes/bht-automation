<b>And every creature</b> (i. e. by the very terms, animated creature: for heaven and earth and sea themselves are mentioned as the<i> abodes</i> of these creatures)<b> which is in the heaven</b> (the chorus being<i> universal</i>, this will include the angels, previously mentioned, and the glorified saints),<b> and on the earth, and under the earth</b> (i. e. not the devils, as even Vitringa: but as in Phil. ii. 10, the departed spirits in Had√©s: see note there),<b> and upon the sea</b> (i. e. most probably, on the surface of the sea; meaning not those on ships, but those sea-animals which are regarded as being on the surface),<b> and the things in them</b> (so in Exod. xx. 11),<b> I heard all saying, Unto Him</b><b> that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb</b> (the Church, including Creation, gives praise to the Lamb for Redemption, vv. 9, 10: the angels praise the infinite condescension of the Son of God: the entire universe celebrates the glory of the universal Father, and of the Redeemer, thence accruing)<b> be</b> (or,<i> is, belongs</i>)<b> the blessing and the honour and the glory and the might</b> (notice the fourfold arrangement where<i> universality</i> is set forth; and the repeated article, exhaustive of each predicate separately. It is fanciful, with Bengel, to allot the four ascriptions among the four classes of creatures above mentioned. In each case the number has the same signification: but they need not separately correspond)<b> to the ages of the ages.</b>
