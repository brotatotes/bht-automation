The inference of Ewald from the rec. text (which is itself here wholly untenable), “presbyteri adoratione repetita Deum prosequuntur, ut a quo auctore omnia progressa sunt et Messias creatus est, ad eum omnis redeat honor, omnis reverentia,” would be unwarranted even were that text retained: ζῶντι , anarthrous, would apply to the whole object of praise in Rev 5:13 ).</p>
