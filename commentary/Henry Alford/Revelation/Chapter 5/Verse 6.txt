<b> 6.]</b><i> The vision of the Lamb.</i><b> And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living-beings, and in the midst of the elders</b> (the words seem to indicate the middle point before the throne: whether on the glassy sea or not, does not appear: but certainly not<i> on</i> the throne, from what follows in the next verse),<b> a Lamb</b> (literally,<b> a little lamb</b>; the<i> diminutive</i>, as applied to our Lord, is peculiar to the Apocalypse. It is difficult to say what precise idea is meant to be conveyed by this form of the word. Elsewhere, we have another form: John i. 29, 36; 1 Pet. i. 19; Acts viii, 32: and as<i> that</i> is found in Isa. liii. 7, from which the figure here is taken, the alteration of the word appears to be purposely made. Possibly it may be to put forward more prominently the idea of meekness and innocence)<b> standing</b> (i. e. in its natural living position: the word is probably chosen on account of what immediately follows. Though as<i> if slain,</i> it was not lying, but standing)<b> as if slain</b> (i. e. retaining the appearance of death-wounds on its body: looking as if it had been slain: compare ch. i. 18. So the majority of Commentators. Ebrard is quite wrong in supposing that the<b> as if</b> has any emphasis on it: it merely serves to solve the apparent paradox lying in the juxtaposition of<b> standing</b> and<b> slain</b>),<b> having seven horns</b> (the horn is the well known emblem of might: compare 1 Sam. ii. 10; 1 Kings xxii. 11; Ps. cxii. 9, cxlviii. 14; Dan. vii. 1, 20 ff., viii. 3 ff.; ch. xvii. 3 ff. The perfect number<i> seven</i> represents that “all power is given unto Him in heaven and earth,” Matt. xxviii. 18)<b> and seven eyes, which</b> (eyes)<b> are the seven spirits of God sent forth into the whole earth</b> (i. e. which eyes represent the watchful active operation of God’s Spirit poured forth through the Death and by the victory of the Lamb, upon all flesh and all creation. As the seven burning lamps before the throne represented the Spirit of God immanent in the Godhead, so the seven eyes of the Lamb represent the same Spirit in his sevenfold perfection, profluent, so to speak, from the incarnate Redeemer: busied in His world-wide and world-long energy: the word used,<i> apestalmena</i>, reminding us of the<i> apostolic</i> work and church. Compare Zech. iv. 10: “<i>Those seven... they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth</i>”).
