<b> 8.]</b><i> Song of praise following thereupon</i>.<b> And when he took</b> (not, “<i>when he had taken</i>,” as A.V., but a pure past: the context, and not the word itself, indicating that the act to be described was subsequent to that thus expressed)<b> the book, the four living-beings and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb</b> (who shares the divine throne, and honour, and worship, ver. 13; ch. xxii. 1; and ch. iii. 21),<b> having each</b> [<b>of them</b>] (this apparently applies only to the elders: not for any grammatical reason, but on account of the symbolism: for<br><br> 1) it is unnatural to suppose figures described as the four living-beings are, having harps or vials; and even if this is not to be pressed [see above on ver. 7], yet<br><br> 2) it is inconsistent with the right view of the four living-beings, as representing creation, that they should present the prayers of the Saints)<b> a harp</b> (properly a zithern or kind of guitar, played either with the hand, or with a plectrum or quill),<b> and golden vials</b> (cups, or bowls: or, by the context, censers)<b> full of incense, which</b> (vials: each vial being full of incense)<b> are</b> (represent)<b> the prayers of the saints</b> (see especially ch. viii. 3: Ps. cxl. 2,<i> “Let my prayer be set forth before Thee as incense.</i>” The twenty-four elders, representing as they do the whole church of God, are represented as offering the praises and the prayers of the whole church: the harps representing the former, the censers the latter. Of any thing approaching intercession on the part of the glorified saints for the church below, or indeed of the glorified saints at all, there is not the least mention, nor does this passage touch the question of the fact of such intercession. In the division of the two employments, the most of prayer falls to the lot of the church in trial, and the most of praise to the church in glory: and this is perhaps the reason why, while they have harps on which they themselves play, they only offer or present the vials of incense. De Wette remarks, that the Writer of the Apocalypse seems not to know any thing of the intercessory office of Christ. But that office is prominent through this whole seene. What is the Lamb as it had been slain—what the confession,<i> “Thou redeemedst</i><i> us to God by Thy blood,”</i> but recognitions of it? It underlies the whole book):<b> and they sing</b> (why<i> present?</i> Is it because the sound still lingered in his ears? Or more probably, as describing their special and glorious office generally, rather than the mere one particular ease of its exercise?)<b> a new song</b> (new, because the<i> occasion</i> was new; the manifestation of the worthiness of the Lamb calls forth fresh words springing from fresh and living thoughts. These words which follow could not be spoken except by those who had seen Christ’s redemption complete; therefore they must needs be new),<b> saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals of it: for Thou wast slain, and didst redeem</b> (the object is not expressed, nor need it be: see similar constructions, Matt. xxv. 8; 1 John iv. 13. The<b> us</b>, which is in the MSS, added or prefixed to the verb, has considerable authority, but on the whole seems more likely to have been inserted, considering the prevalent early interpretation of the elders as Apostles and Prophets, than omitted because they were imagined to be angels)<b> to God by</b> (literally,<b> in</b>, as the vehicle, and conditioning element of redemption)<b> thy blood out of every tribe, and tongue and people and nation</b> (the only thing to be noticed is the quadruple<i> number</i> of these specifications, as indicating universality: see again below, ver. 13);<b> and madest them a kingdom and priests, and they reign upon the earth</b> ( “this clause differs from that in ch. i. 6, both by the<b> and</b> before<i> ‘priests,’</i> and by the important addition<i> ‘and they reign,’</i>&c. Here we have three particulars: 1) that those who are bought to be God's own are made into a kingdom, viz. God’s,—2) that they are made into priests,—3) that they are invested kingly power. So rightly Ebrard.” Düsterdieck. The present tense,<b> they reign</b>, is not to be rendered as a future, but keeps its own meaning [the whole aspect and reference of this heavenly vision being<i> not future</i>, but<i> present</i>: the world and church as now existing, compare Eph. ii. 6]. The Church even now, in Christ her Head, reigns on the earth: all things are being put under her feet, as under His: and even if this meaning be questioned, we have her kingly rank and office asserted in the present, even in the midst of persecution and contempt).
