<p><strong> 13, 14</strong> .] <em> The chorus of assenting praise from Creation itself</em> . <strong> And every creature</strong> (i. e. by the very terms, animated creature: for heaven and earth and sea themselves are mentioned as the <em> abodes</em> of these κτίσματα ) <strong> which is in the heaven</strong> (the chorus being <em> universal</em> , this will include the angels, previously mentioned, and the glorified saints) <strong> and on the earth and under the earth</strong> (i. e. not the devils, as even Vitringa: but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10">Philippians 2:10</span> , the departed spirits in Hades: see note there), <strong> and upon the sea</strong> (i. e. most probably, on the surface of the sea; meaning not those on ships, but those sea-animals which are regarded as being on the surface), <strong> and all the things in them</strong> (so in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:11">Exodus 20:11</span> . The clause added seems to serve the purpose of <em> complete</em> enumeration, applying here to γῆ and θάλασσα only, as ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ has occurred already. The ἐπί and ὑποκάτω being both superficial, ἐν completes the list in the depths of the earth and the sea: cf. ch. Rev 8:9 ) <strong> I heard saying</strong> (the gender again is that of the things signified, not that of κτίσμα : see ch. Rev 4:8 ), <strong> To Him that sitteth upon the throne</strong> (for the various cases after καθημ . ἐπί , see note, ch. Rev 4:2 ) <strong> and to the Lamb</strong> (the Church, including Creation, gives praise to the Lamb for Redemption, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9-10">Revelation 5:9-10</span> ; the angels praise the infinite condescension of the Son of God: the entire universe celebrates the glory of the universal Father and of the Redeemer, thence accruing) ( <strong> be</strong> (or, <em> is, belongs</em> )) <strong> the blessing and the honour and the glory and the might</strong> (notice the fourfold arrangement where <em> universality</em> is set forth: and the repeated article, exhaustive of each predicate separately. It is fanciful, with Bengel, to allot the four ascriptions among the four classes of creatures above mentioned. In each case the number has the same signification: but they need not separately correspond) <strong> to the ages of the ages</strong> .</p>
