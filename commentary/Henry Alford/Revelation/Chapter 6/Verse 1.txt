<b> CHAP. VI. 1—VIII 1.]</b> THE OPENING OF THE SEVEN SEALS. As preliminary to the exposition of this section, I may observe that it is of the first importance to bear in mind, that the openings of these seals correspond to the various arrangements of God’s Providence by which the way is prepared for the final opening of the closed book of His purposes to His glorified Church, That opening shall not fully and freely be made, till His people will know even as they are known. And that will not be, till they are fully gathered in to His heavenly garner. This book the Lamb opens, containing as it does matters which “no one knoweth, neither the angels which are in heaven, nor even the Son,” first by the acts and procedures of His establishment of His reign over the earth, and then finally by His great second coming, the necessary condition of His elect being gathered out of the four winds into His glory. When these preparations for His coming have taken place, and that coming itself has passed, and the elect are gathered into glory, then will be the time when the last hindrance to our perfect knowledge will be removed, and the book of God’s eternal purposes will lie open—the theme of eternity’s praise.<br><br> I may add that. for the sake of perspicuity, I shall mainly follow, in these notes, the track of that interpretation which seems to me to be required; noticing only differences in those of other Commentators where absolutely necessary.<br><br><b> 1.]</b><b> And I saw when the Lamb opened one from among the seven seals, and I heard one from among the four living-beings saying, as the voice of thunder</b> (which is to be taken not as peculiarly belonging to this first as resembling a lion, but as belonging to all alike, and accounted for by their mysterious and exalted nature: compare ch. i. 10, x. 3),<b> Come</b> (to whom, and with what meaning is this spoken?. The great majority of Commentators have taken the received reading, which fixes it by adding “<i>and look</i>,” or, “<i>and see</i>,” as an address to the Seer, to approach nearer and look at the coming vision, And even those who have rejected this addition have yet regarded it as a true gloss, and the “Come” as addressed to the Seer. But whither was he to come? Separated as he was by the glassy sea from the throne, was he to cross it? Compare the place where the Seer is to come and take the little book [ch. x. 8], and see how different is the whole form of expression. In interpreting so unusual a term of address, surely we should rather begin by enquiring whether we have not the key to it in the book itself. And in this enquiry, are we justified in leaving ont. of consideration such a verse as ch. xxii. 17,<i> “The Spirit and the Bride say</i><b> Come</b> [the same word, and in the same number and Person)<i> and let him that hear eth say</i><b> Come</b>,” and the following “<i>Amen</i>,<b> Come</b>,<i> Lord Jesus</i>,” xxii. 22? This seems to shew, in my mind, beyond a doubt, what, in the mind of the Seer, this remarkable and insulated exclamation imported. It a cry addressed, not to himself, but to the Lord Jesus: and as each of these four first seals is accompanied by a similar cry from one of the four living-beings, I see represented in this fourfold<b> Come</b> the groaning and travailing together of creation for the manifestation of the sons of God, expressed in each case in a prayer for Christ’s coming: and in the things revealed when the seals are opened, His fourfold preparation for His coming on earth. Then at the opening of the fifth seal the longing of the martyred saints for the same great consummation is expressed, and at that of the sixth it actually arrives).{2}<b>And I saw, and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him having a bow; and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering, and in order that he may conquer</b> (in the first place, the figure of the horses and their riders at once brings to mind the similar vision in Zechariah, i. 7–11, vi. 1–8, where the men on the horses are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the whole earth. In Zech. i. as here, that part of the vision is followed, ver. 12, by the cry of the<i> “How long?”</i> Here the horses and their riders are the various aspects of the divine dispensations which should come upon the earth preparatory to the great day of the Lord’s coming. As regards this first, the whole imagery speaks of<i> victory</i>. The horses of the Roman commanders in their triumphs were white. The<i> bow</i> serves to identify the imagery here with that in Habakkuk iii. 9, where God goes forth for the salvation of His people: see also Isa. xli. 2; Zech. ix. 13: and even more strikingly with that in Ps. xlv. 4, 5, “In thy majesty ride prosperously, because of truth and meekness and righteousness: and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.” It is hardly possible that one whose mind was full of such imagery, should have had any other meaning in his thoughts than that to which these prophecies point. The<i> crown</i> finds its parallel in the vision of Zech. vi., where, ver. 11, it is said, “Take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest.” The<i> going forth conquering and in order to conquer</i> can only, it seems to me, point to one interpretation. The<i> conquering</i> might be said of any victorious earthly power whose victories should endure for the time then present, and after wards pass away: but the<i> in order that he may conquer</i> can only be said of a power whose victories should last for ever. Final and permanent victory then is here imported. Victory, we may safely say, on the part of that kingdom against which the gates of hell shall not prevail: whose fortunes and whose trials are the great subject of this revelation. Such is the first vision, the opening of the first seal in the mystery of the divine purposes:<i> victory for God’s church and people:</i> the great key-note, so to speak, of all the apocalyptic harmonies. And notice, that in this interpretation, there is no lack of correspondence with the three visions which follow. All four are<i> judgments</i> upon the earth: the beating down of earthly power, the breaking up of earthly peace, the exhausting of earthly wealth, the destruction of earthly life. Nor is this analogy disturbed, when we come to enquire,<i> who is the rider</i> on this white horse. We must not, in reply, on the one hand, too hastily introduce the Person of our Lord Himself, or on the other, be startled at the objection that we shall be paralleling Him, or one closely resembling Him, with the far different forms which follow. Doubtless, the resemblance to the rider in ch. xix. 11 ff. is very close, and is intended to be very close. The difference however is considerable. There, He is set forth as<i> present</i> in His triumph, followed by the hosts of heaven: here, He is working, in bodily absence, and the rider is not Himself, but only a symbol of His victorious power, the embodiment of His advancing kingdom as regards that side of its progress where it breaks down earthly power, and makes the kingdom of the world to be the kingdom of our Lord and His Christ. Further it would not be wise, nor indeed according to the analogy of these visions, to specify. In all cases but the last, these riders are left in the vagueness of their symbolic offices. If we attempt in this ease to specify further, e.g. as Victorinus, “The white horse is the word of preaching with the aid of the Holy Spirit sent forth into the world; for the Lord saith, This gospel shall he preached through all the world, for a testimony before the nations, and then shall the end come,”—while we are sure that we are thus far right, we are but partially right: we do not cover the extent of the symbol, seeing that there are other aspects and instruments of victory of the kingdom of Christ, besides the preaching of the Word. The same might be said of any other of the partial interpretations which have been given by those who have taken this view. And it was taken, with divergences of separate detail, by all expositors from the earliest times down to the year 1500).
