<b>and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth</b> (so Matt. as before, “<i>and the stars shall fall</i><i> from heaven</i>”),<b> as a fig-tree casteth her unripe figs</b> (De Wette explains it to mean, the winter figs, which almost always fall off unripe)<b> when shaken by a great wind</b> (so Matt. again, “<i>and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.</i>” It is remarkable, that in Matt., when the description has finished, the next words are,<i> “learn the parable from the fig-tree.”</i> The similitude from the fig-tree, though a different one, rises to the mind of the Apostle as he sees in vision the fulfilment of his Master’s words which were so shortly followed bu a similar illustration. The imagery itself, as that in the beginning of the next verse, is from Isa. xxxiv. 4).<b> And the heaven parted asunder as a scroll when rolled up</b> (the stars having fallen from it, the firmament itself was removed away, as an open scroll which is rolled up and put by. So also almost verbatim, Isa. xxxiv. 4),<b> and every mountain and island were moved out of their places</b> (compare again Matt. xxiv. 35, “<i>heaven and earth shall pass away:</i>” the whole earth is broken up by a change as total as any of those previous ones which have prepared it for its present inhabitants, Compare ch. xvi. 20; and Nahum i. 5).<b> And the kings of the earth, and the great men</b> (the great civil officers, statesmen and courtiers, us distinguished from the next following),<b> and the chief captains</b> (in Acts xxi.—xxv., the officer in command of the garrison at Jerusalem is so called),<b> and the rich men and the strong men</b> (hitherto the enumeration has comprised all those who from their circumstances would have most ground for trust in the permanence of the existing state of the earth: these last being perhaps the physically strong, see Ps. xxxiii. 16: or perhaps all those who on account of any strength, physical or intellectual, are of the number of the sturdy or stout-hearted. Now, the catalogue becomes more general),<b> and every man, bond and free, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains</b> (see Isa. ii. 19, from which the imagery comes),<b> and say to the mountains</b><b> and to the rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the countenance</b> (see Nahum i. 6: and compare Ps. xxxiv. 16, “<i>The countenance</i> [<i>face</i>]<i> of the Lord is against them thai do evil</i>”)<b> of Him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb</b> (the imagery is from Hosea x. 8, further impressed by our Lord’s solemn saying on the way to Calvary, Luke xxiii. 30:—the meaning, that all these shall seek death or annihilation in terror of the coming day, when they shall have to stand before God):<b> because the great day</b> (we have no way in English of expressing the title here used without an awkward periphrasis. It is literally. ‘the day, that great day.” This name, if properly considered, should have kept expositors firm here to the great, verity of this part of the Apocalyptic visions, and prevented them from going into all sorts of incongruous interpretations, as they have done)<b> of His wrath is come, and who is able to stand</b>?—We are thus brought to the very threshold itself of the great day of the Lord's coming. It has not yet happened: but the tribes of the earth are troubled at its immediate approach, and those terrible signs with which all Scripture ushers it in, have taken place. We are now then arrived at the time described in Matt. xxiv. 30: the coming itself of the Son of man being for a while kept in the background, as hereafter to be resumed. He is seen as it were coming: but before the vengeance is fully accomplished, the elect of God then living on the earth must be gathered, as Matt. xxiv. 31, out of the four winds of heaven, from among the inhabitants of the earth. To this ingathering the sealing in our text is the necessary preliminary. The correspondence between. the series of prophecies holds even in the minutest particulars, and where they do not correspond, their very differences are full of instruction. See these pointed out as we proceed.
