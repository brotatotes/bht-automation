<b>And there came forth another horse, red</b> (the colour of blood. The colour of the horse in each case has reference to the employment of the rider),<b> and to him that sat upon him it was given to take away peace</b> (not “the peace left by the former seal,” for 1) the former seal neither implies nor leaves such peace, and 2) these four seals are strictly correlative, not consecutive on one another; but, peace<i> in its entirety</i>)<b> out of the earth</b> (generally, as ever: not, Judæa, nor the Roman empire, nor any special portion merely)<b> and that they</b> (men: the inhabitants of the earth)<b> shall kill</b> (so literally: not only importing the result of purpose, but including also matter of fact, “that they may... which they also shall”)<b> one another: and there was given to him a great sword</b> (the key to the interpretation of this seal is to be found in Matt. x. 34 and parallels:<i> “Think not that I came to send peace upon the earth; I came not to send peace, but</i><b> a sword</b>.” It represents to us the taking away of peace from the earth, the slaying one another, the reign of the sword, as one of the destined concomitants of the growing and conquering power of Christ, and one of the world-long and world-wide preparations for His coming. Observe, all<i> limitations</i> of this meaning are wrong; whether to the persecutions of the Christians, or to any period of time, ancient or modern, The above was the most ancient interpretation; e.g. we have in Victorinus, “The red horse, and he that sat upon him having a sword, are future wars, as we read in the gospel, for nation shall rise against nation, &c.” Matt. xxiv. 7).
