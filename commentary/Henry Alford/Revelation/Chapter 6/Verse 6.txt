And I heard as it</b><b> were</b> (this qualification must apparently be taken with the whole clause— “something like [a voice in the midst of the four living-beings],” the uncertainty applying to the<i> situation</i>, not to its being a voice, which it<i> was</i>)<b> a voice in the midst of the four liv-ing-beings</b> (it is not specified,<i> whose</i> voice: but the point from which the voice comes is appropriate to its intent, which is to mitigate the woes of creation, represented by the four living-beings: see below),<b> saying</b> (Let there be)<b> A chœnix</b> (see below)<b> of wheat for a denarius, and three chœnixes of barley for a denarius</b> (the sense seems to be, Take care that there be thus much food for thus much price. The denarius was the ordinary soldier’s pay for a day in the time of Tiberius [see note on Matt. xx. 2], and lias been usually and not unfairly assumed to be twice mentioned here as representing a day’s wages. The chœnix appears in like manner to be taken for a day’s provision: for so it is used in several of the numerous places cited by the Commentators. Herodotus, in estimating the amount of food consumed by the army of Xerxes, assumes this: “I find by calculation,” he says, “supposing that each consumed a chœnix a day and no more....” and similarly Thucydides, speaking of allowance made to the Lacedæmonians in Sphacteria while negotiations were going on. A proverb also is mentioned, “Don’ t sit upon a chœnix,” meaning, “don’ t confine your provision to the current day, a chœnix being an allowance for the day.” Nothing can be more decisive than such proverbial usage. The tendency of the voice is then to check or limit the agency of the rider on the black horse, and to provide that, notwithstanding his errand of famine, sustenance shall not utterly fail. With regard to the three chœnixes of barley, the cheaper and less profitable grain, it seems to have been rightly interpreted as taking in the other case, of the workman who, out of his denarius a day, has to maintain not himself only, but his family also, and cannot consequently afford the dearer wheaten bread);<b> and the oil and the wine do not thou injure</b> (not, “do thou not commit injustice in the matter of the oil and the wine.” The usage of this book should have prevented such an interpretation: for the verb here used with the accusative of the material object hurt or injured is the constant habit of our Writer: and in no case do we find the other construction used by him, or indeed by any other writer to my knowledge. Rinck gives another meaning, equally untenable, “<i>waste</i> not the oil and the wine,” seeing they are so costly.<br><br> As regards the meaning, the spirit of the saying is as explained above: the rider on the black horse, symbolizing Famine, is limited in his desolating action by the command given, that enough is to be reserved for sustenance. Wheat, barley, oil, and wine, formed the ordinary sources of nourishment: see Ps. civ. 14, 15. So that as regards its<i> intent</i>, the command is parallel with that saying of our Lord in Matt. xxiv. 22. It is the mercy of God, tempering His judgments. And in its general interpretation, as the opening of the first seal revealed the certain proceeding on to victory of Christ and His church, and the second, that His coming should be prepared in the world not by peace but by the sword, so now by this third we learn that Famine, the pressure of want on men, not sweeping them away by utter failure of the means of subsistence, but keeping them far below the ordinary standard of comfort, and especially those who depend on their daily labour, will be one of the four judgments by which the way of the Lord’s coming will be opened. This seems to point not so much to<i> death</i> by famine, which belongs to the next vision, as to agrarian distress with all its dreadful consequences: ripening in some cases [see below] into the hunger-death, properly the consequence of Famine.<br><br> The above interpretation of the third seal is given in the main by Victorinus— “The black horse signifies famine: for the Lord saith,<i> ‘There shall be famines in places:’”</i> but he allegorizes the latter part of the vision:<i> “hurt not the oil and the wine,”</i> i.e., “strike not with plagues the spiritual man”).
