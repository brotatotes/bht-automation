<b>And I saw, and behold a livid horse</b> (the word, meaning originally and properly grass-green, when used of flesh implies that greenish pallor which we know as<i> livid</i>: the colour of the corpse in incipient decay, or of the complexion extremely pale through disease),<b> and he that sat upon him his name was Death</b> (i. e. he was death personified.

At all events this suggests itself here as a possible reference of the number four: whereas in ch. viii. the continually recurring<i> third part</i> has no such assignable solution. The expositors for the most part pass it over, merely as ignifying a considerable portion. Our principal English<i> historical</i> interpreter, with whose historical interpretation it will not square, takes refuge in the reading of the vulgate, “<i>over</i> [the]<i> four parts of the earth</i>.” But the reading cannot, for a moment be received on such authority; nor are we at liberty to arrange the sacred text so as to square with our preconceived systems)<b> to kill with sword and with famine and with death</b> (i. e. here,<i> pestilence:</i> see below),<b> and by</b> (<b>by</b>, seeing that the other three were rather general indications of the manner in which, but this last of the actual agent by whose administration)<b> the wild beasts of the earth</b> (the enumeration comprehends the “<i>four sore judgments</i>” enumerated in Ezek. xiv. 21, and in the same terms.
