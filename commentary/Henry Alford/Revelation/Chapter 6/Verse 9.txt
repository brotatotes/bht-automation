<b> 9.] And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar</b> (it is an altar of<i> sacrifice</i> which is here meant; the peculiar form of the word<i> slain</i>, which follows, seems plainly to imply this: see below)<b> the souls</b> (i. e. departed spirits. It is manifestly idle to enquire, seeing that the Apostle was in a state of spiritual and supernatural vision,<i> how</i> these disembodied spirits became visible to him, That they were not clothed with bodies is manifest)<b> of those that have been slain on account of the word of God and on account of the testimony which they had</b> (so literally: i. e, which was committed to them to bear, and which they bore: see ch. xii. 17.<br><br> Much has been said about the souls of the martyrs not being their departed spirits, which must be conceived of as being in bliss with Christ, and in consequence it has been imagined that these were only their animal lives, resident in the blood and shed forth with it. But no such difficulty really exists. We know, whatever be the bliss of the departed martyrs and confessors, that they are waiting for the coming of the Lord, without which they are not perfect: and in the holy fire of their purified zeal, they look forward to that day as one of righteous judgment on the ungodly world. The representation here, in which they are seen<i> under the altar</i>, is simply symbolical, carrying out the likening of them to victims slain on an altar. Even as the blood of these victims was poured under the altar and the life was in the blood, so their souls are represented as under the symbolical altar in heaven, crying for vengeance, as blood is often said to do. After this, it hardly need be said that no inference can be drawn from this vision respecting the intermediate state between the death of the saints and the coming of the Lord):<b> and they cried with a great voice, saying</b> (<b>they</b>, viz.<i> the souls</i>, which are identified in the sentence with the persons themselves: not, as some think, the<i> slain</i> as distinguished from the<i> souls</i>),<b> Until when</b> (i. e. how long),<b> thou Master</b> (it is God who is here addressed; with Him rests the time when to avenge His elect, see Luke xviii. 7, 8)<b> holy and true, dost thou not judge</b> (give decision in the matter of)<b> and exact vengeance for our blood from them that dwell on the earth</b> (i. e. the ungodly world, as distinguished from the church of God)?
