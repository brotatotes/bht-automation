And I said to him, My lord</b> (the address is one of deep reverence, as to a heavenly being. See the limits of this reverence in ch. xix. 10, xxii. 8, 9),<b> thou knowest</b> (see Ezek. xxxvii. 3, from which the form of expression comes. The words must not, with Ebrard, be forced to mean, “I know well, but thou knowest better:” but must be taken in their simple acceptation, “I know not, but thou dost.” And this again need not mean that the Apostle had no thought on the subject, but that he regarded himself as ignorant in comparison with his heavenly interlocutor).<b> And he said to me, These are they that come</b> (not, as A.V., “that<i> came</i>:” nor again must the present be put prominently forward, that<i> are coming</i>, as if the number in the vision were not yet complete: still less is it to be taken as a quasi-future, “that<i> shall come</i>:” but the present tense is merely one of<i> designation</i>. Their description, generically, is, that “they are they that<i> come</i>, &c.”)<b> out of the great tribulation</b> (the definite article ought not to be omitted, as in A.V. It is most emphatic: “out of the tribulation, the great one.” And in consequence some have explained the words of that last great time of trial which is to try the saints before the coming of the Lord. But to limit it to this only, is manifestly out of keeping with the spirit of the vision. I would rather understand it of the whole sum of the trials of the saints of God, viewed by the Elder as now complete, and designated by this emphatic and general name: “all that tribulation”),<b> and they washed their robes</b> (the past tense is that so often used of the course of this life when looked back upon from its yonder side: they did this in that life on earth which is now [in the vision] past and gone by)<b> and made them white</b> (the references are full of interest)<b> in the blood of the Lamb</b> (i. e. by that faith in the atoning blood of Christ of which it is said, “<i>cleansing their hearts by the faith</i>,” Acts xv. 9: and 1 John i, 7, “the blood of Jesus Christ... cleanseth us from all sin.” See also Eph. v. 25–27. Observe, we must not separate the two acts, washing and making white, as Hengstenberg does, interpreting the former of the forgiveness of sins, the latter of sanctification: the latter is only the result of the former: they washed them, and by so doing made them white. The act was a life-long one,—the continued purification of the man, body, soul, and spirit, by the application of the blood of Christ in its cleansing power).
