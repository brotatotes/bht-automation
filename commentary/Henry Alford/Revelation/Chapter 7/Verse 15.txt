<b>On this account</b> (<i>because</i> they washed their robes white in Christ’s atoning and purifying blood: for nothing that has spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, can stand where they are standing: compare again Eph. v. 27: none will be there who are not thus washed)<b> they are before the throne of God</b> (in the presence of His throne: seeing Him [Matt. v. 8; 1 Cor. xiii. 12] as He sees them),<b> and they serve Him by day and by night</b> ( “this,” says Bede, “is a way of expressing eternity in our human language”)<b> in His temple</b> (as His priests, conducting the sweet praises of that heavenly choir, ver. 10, and doing what other high and blessed service He may delight to employ them in):<b> and He that sitteth on the throne shall spread His habitation over them</b> (it is exceedingly difficult to express the sense of these glorious words, in which the fulfilment of the Old Test. promises, such as Levit. xxvi. 11; Isa. iv. 5, 6; Ezek. xxxvii. 27, is announced. They give the fact of the dwelling of God<i> among</i> them, united with the fact of His protection being over them, and assuring to them the exemptions next to be mentioned. In the term<b> shall tabernacle</b> [so literally] are contained a multitude of recollections: of the pillar in the wilderness, of the Shechinah in the holy place, of the tabernacle of witness with all its symbolism. These will all now be realized and superseded by the overshadowing presence of God Himself).
