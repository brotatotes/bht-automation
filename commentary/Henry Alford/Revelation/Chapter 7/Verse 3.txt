The judgment of the great day is in fact going on in the background; but in this first and general summary of the divine judgments and dealings, in which the sighs of Creation and of the Church for Christâ€™s coming are set before us, only that portion of its proceedings is described which has reference to these two. When the strain is again taken up, the ease and reference are different.<br><br> The questions now arise, 1) who are these that are sealed? and 2) what is the intent of their being sealed? 1) Those who have followed the preceding course of interpretation will have no difficulty in anticipating the reply.

(On the import and reason of the use of<i> Israel</i> and its tribes, I shall speak below.)
