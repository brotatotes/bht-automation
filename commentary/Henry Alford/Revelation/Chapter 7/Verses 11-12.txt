 11, 12 .] The choir of angels, as in ch. Revelation 5:11 , respond to the ascription of praise.  And all the angels were standing ( εἱστήκειν is in sense imperfect, just as ἕστηκα is in sense present: this latter importing “I have placed myself,” = “I stand,” and the former “I had placed myself,” = “I was standing”)  round the throne and the elders and the four living-beings, and fell before the throne on their faces (then they were in the vision in the similitude of men)  and worshipped God, saying, Amen: the blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honour and the power and the might (observe the sevenfold ascription)  be to our God unto the ages of the ages. Amen .
