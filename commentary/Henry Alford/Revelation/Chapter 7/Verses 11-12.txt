<p><strong> 11, 12</strong> .] The choir of angels, as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+5:11">Revelation 5:11</span> , respond to the ascription of praise. <strong> And all the angels were standing</strong> ( εἱστήκειν is in sense imperfect, just as ἕστηκα is in sense present: this latter importing “I have placed myself,” = “I stand,” and the former “I had placed myself,” = “I was standing”) <strong> round the throne and the elders and the four living-beings, and fell before the throne on their faces</strong> (then they were in the vision in the similitude of men) <strong> and worshipped God, saying, Amen: the blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honour and the power and the might</strong> (observe the sevenfold ascription) <strong> be to our God unto the ages of the ages. Amen</strong> .</p>
