<b> CH. VIII. 1.]</b><b> And when</b> (or,<b> whenever</b>. This word occurs in the opening of this seal only, giving it an indefiniteness which does not belong to any of the rest. The touch is go slight as not to be reproducible in another language: but it can hardly be denied that in the Writer’s mind it exists)<b> he opened the seventh seal</b> (what sign may we expect to follow? The other six seals have been accompanied each hy its appropriate vision. Since the opening of the last one, followed as it was hy the portents and terrors of the day of the Lord, there has been an episodical series of visions, setting forth the gathering in of the elect, and the innumerable multitude of the glorified Church. What incident is appropriate for the removal of this last, the only obstacle yet remaining to the entire disclosure of the secret purposes of God?)<b> there was</b> (there became, there came on, supervened, from a state very different, viz. the choral songs of the great multitude, re-echoed by the angelic host)<b> silence in the heaven about half an hour</b> (in enquiring into the meaning of this silence, let us first see whether we have any indication by analogy in the book itself, which may guide us. In ch. x. 4, when the Apostle is about to write down the voices of the seven thunders, he is commanded to abstain, and not to write them down. And though neither the manner nor the place of that<i> withholding</i> exactly corresponds to this half-hour’s silence, yet it holds a place relating to the sounding of the seventh trumpet, quite sufficiently near to that of this, with regard to the seventh seal, to be brought into comparison with it. It imports 1) a passing over and withholding, as far as the Apostle is concerned, of that which the seventh seal revealed: i.e. of that complete unrolling of God’s book of His eternal purposes, of the times and seasons which He holds in His own power. For this unrolling, every thing has been prepared: even to the taking off of the last seal which bound the mysterious roll. But as to what the roll itself contains, there is silence. 2) But it also imports, as Victorinus beautifully says,<i> “that the half-hour is the beginning of eternal rest:</i>” the commencement of that blessed sabbatical state of rest, during which the people of God shall be in full possession of those things which ear hath not heard nor eye seen. With equal truth and beauty does the same, our earliest apocalyptic expositor, proceed; “but he takes merely a part, because the interruption repeats the same things as far as order is concerned. For if the silence had been eternal, there would have been an end of narration.” So that the vexed question, whether what follows belongs, or not, to the seventh seal, is, in fact, a question not worth seriously answering. Out of the completion of the former vision rise up a new series of visions, bearing a different character, but distinguished by the same number, indicating perfection, and shewing us that though evolved ont of the completion of the former series, they do not belong to the last particular member of that series, any further than as it leads the way to them. Even more marked is this again below in ch. xi.—xvi., where the pouring out of the seven vials ean in no way be said to belong to or form part of the blowing of the seventh trumpet. It will be seen then that I believe all interpretation to be wrong, which regards the blowing of the seven trumpets as forming a portion of the vision accompanying the seventh seal in particular: and again that I place in the same category all that which regards it as taking up and going over the same ground again. In the seven seals, we had revealed, as was fitting, the opening of the great Revelation, the progress and fortunes of God’s Church and people in relation to the world, and of the world in relation to the church.<br><br> With regard to the trumpets themselves, we may observe, 1) That they repeat again the same mystic number<i> seven</i>, indicating that the course of events (see below) represented by this sounding is complete in itself, as was that indicated before by the breaking of the seals, and as is also that afterwards to be indicated by the pouring ont of the vials: 2) That as in the case of the seals, there is a distinction made between the first four and the following three. Compare below, ver. 13. 3) That as also in the case of the seals, there is an interval, with two episodical visions, between the sixth and the seventh trumpet. Compare ch. x., and ch. xi. 1–14. 4) That, of the trumpets, six only announce visions partaking of the common character of judgments, whereas the seventh forms, as we also saw in the case of the seventh seal, the solemn close to the rest. 5) And further, that as regards this seventh trumpet, the matters imported by it as being<i> the third woe</i> (ch. xi. 14) are not given, but merely indicated by “<i>the time of the dead is come to be judged, &c.</i>” (ch. xi. 18): just as we saw that the things imported by the opening of the seventh seal were not detailed, but only indicated by the episodical visions, and by the nature of the similitude used. 6) That before the sounding of the seventh trumpet, the mystery of God is finished, as far as relates to the subject of this course of visions. This is indicated by the great Angel in ch. x. 7; and again by implication in ch. xi. 15–19, both by the purport of the voices in heaven, v. 15, and by the ascriptions of praise, vv. 16–18. This is the same again at the pouring out of the seventh vial, where the great voice from the throne announces “<i>It is past</i>,” ch. xvi. 17: as we saw that it was at the opening of the seventh seal, as indicated by the silence of half an hour, Each course of visions is complete in itself: each course of visions ends in the accomplishment of that series of divine actions which it sets forth. 7) That as, when the preparation for the seven angels to sound their trumpets is evolved out of the opening of the seventh seal, the vision of the seals is solemnly closed in by “<i>there were thunders</i><i> and voices and lightnings and an earthquake</i>,” so the vision of the trumpets is solemnly closed in by “<i>there were lightnings</i><i> and voices and thunders and a great hail</i>.” That the similar occurrence, ch. xvi. 18, does not close the series of the vials, seems to be owing to special circumstances belonging to the outpouring of the seventh vial: see there (ch. xvi. 21). 8) That as in vv. 3–5, which form ey close of the vision of the seals, and the opening of that of the trumpets, the offering of the prayers of the saints is the prominent feature (see notes below), so in the close of the series of the trumpets we have a prominent disclosure of the ark of the covenant of God, declare and sealing His faithfulness to His Church. Similarly again at the beginning of the series of the vials, we have the temple of the tabernacle of witness opened. Why we have not a similar appearance at the close of that series, is to be accounted for as above. 9) That, seeing that this course of visions opens and closes as last noticed, it (to say nothing at present of the following series of the vials is to be regarded as embracing a course of judgments (for such evidently is every one of its six visions) inflicted in answer to those prayers, and forming a portion of that avenging invoked by the souls of the martyrs in ch. vi. 10. 10) If this be so, then, as this series of visions is manifestly to be regarded as extending to the end of the whole period of<i> time</i> (compare ch. x. 7, “<i>in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he was about to blow his trumpet, and the mystery of God was finished</i>,”<i>&c.</i>), we may fairly say that it takes up the great world-wide vision of the seals at the point where it was said to the vengeance-invoking martyrs that “<i>they should rest</i><i> yet for a time:</i>” and that the judgments of this series of visions occur during the time of waiting. This view is confirmed by finding that<i> the dwellers on the earth</i>, upon whom the vengeance is invoked in ch. vi. 10, are the objects of vengeance during this series of judgments, compare ver. 13. 11) In reference to this last remark we may observe that no one portion especially of the earth’s inhabitants are pointed out as objects of this series of judgments, but all the ungodly, as usurpers of the kingdom of Christ. This is plain, by the expressions in the ascription of praise with which it closes, I mean, the kingdom of this world, &c. Earthly domination is cast down, and the Lord’s Kingdom is brought in. And it is also plain, from the expression used in that, same ascription of praise, “<i>and to destroy those that are destroying the earth</i>,” of what character have been these ungodly—the corrupters of the earth—the tainters and wasters of the means and accessories of life. 12) Whatever be the interpretation which follows from the foregoing considerations, two canons must not be violated. a) As in the case of the seals, so it is manifest here, from ch. xi. 18, “<i>the time of the dead to be judged is come,</i>” that the series of visions reaches forward to the time of the end, and is only terminated by the great events indicated in those words. And b) as yet, no particular city, no especial people is designated as the subject of the apocalyptic vision. All is general. The earth, the trees, the grass, the sea, the waters, the lights of heaven, mankind,—these are at present the objects in our field of view. There is as yet no<i> throne of the beast</i>, as in the outpouring of the vials, ch. xvi, 10. The prophecy goes on becoming more specific as it advances: and it is not for us to anticipate its course, nor to localize and individualize where it is as yet general and undefined. The further details will be treated as we go on).<b></b>
