<b> 2.]</b><i> First appearance of the seven trumpet-angels.</i><b> And I saw</b> (viz. during the symbolic silence, at the end of the half-hour. What now follows is not to be dered as in the interpretation chronologically consequent upon that which was indicated by the seals, but merely as in the<i> vision</i> chronologically consequent on that course of visions. The evolution of the courses of visions out of one another does not legitimately lead to the conclusion that the<i> events represented by them</i> are consecutive in order of<i> time</i>. There are other and more important sequences than that of time: they may be independent of it, or they may concur with it)<b> the seven angels which stand before God</b> (compare Tobit xii. 15, “<i>I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before</i> [more properly,<i> enter in before</i>]<i> the glory of the Holy One</i>.” The agreement is not entire, inasmuch as here<i> another angel</i>, and not one of the seven, presently offers the prayers of the saints. These are not the archangels, nor are they the seven spirits of ch. iv. 5: nor again are they merely seven angels selected on account of the seven trumpets: this is entirely precluded by the article,<b> the</b><i> seven angels which stand</i>, &c. It is clear that the passage in Tobit and the words here refer to the same matter, and that the fact was part of that revelation with regard to the order and employments of the holy angels, which seems to have taken place during the captivity),<b> and there were given to them seven trumpets</b> (understand, with intent that they themselves should blow them).{3}<b>And another angel</b> (not to be identified with<i> Christ</i>, as is done by Bede, Vitringa, Calovius, and others, and recently [for doctrinal reasons] by Elliott: for thus confusion is introduced into the whole imagery of the vision, in which the Lord Jesus is<i> otherwise</i> present, viz., as the Lamb in the midst of the throne. In ch. v. 8, we have the twenty-four elders falling down with vials containing the prayers of the saints: here we have an angel offering incense that it may mingle with the prayers on the heavenly altar. Any theological difficulty which belongs to the one belongs also to the other; and it is a canon which we must strictly observe in interpretation, that we are not, on account of supposed doctrinal propriety, to depart from the plain meaning of words. In ch. vii. 2 we have “<i>another angel</i>” in the sense of a created angel [see note there]: and would it be probable that St. John would after this, and I may add with his constant usage of the term throughout the book for angel in its ordinary sense, designate our Lord by this title?” There is something to me far more revolting from theological propriety in such a supposition, than in an angel being seen in the heavenly ministrations offering incense to mix with the prayers of the saints. It ought really to be needless to remark, in thus advocating consistency of verbal interpretation, that no countenance is hereby given to the invocation of angels: the whole truth of their being and ministration protesting against such an inference. They are simply<i> ministering spirits</i>, and the action here described is a portion of that their ministry.<i> Through Whom</i> the prayers are offered, we all know. He is our only Mediator and channel of grace)<b> came and stood over</b> (so that his form appeared above it; the altar being between the Apostle and him)<b> the altar</b> (viz. the altar named ch. vi. 9, as the repetition of the word with the article shews: see below on ver. 5),<b> having a golden censer</b> (the word used signifies elsewhere the<i> frankincense</i> itself.
