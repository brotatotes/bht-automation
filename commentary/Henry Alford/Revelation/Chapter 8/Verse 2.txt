<b> 2.]</b><i> First appearance of the seven trumpet-angels.</i><b> And I saw</b> (viz. during the symbolic silence, at the end of the half-hour. What now follows is not to be dered as in the interpretation chronologically consequent upon that which was indicated by the seals, but merely as in the<i> vision</i> chronologically consequent on that course of visions. The evolution of the courses of visions out of one another does not legitimately lead to the conclusion that the<i> events represented by them</i> are consecutive in order of<i> time</i>. There are other and more important sequences than that of time: they may be independent of it, or they may concur with it)<b> the seven angels which stand before God</b> (compare Tobit xii. 15, “<i>I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before</i> [more properly,<i> enter in before</i>]<i> the glory of the Holy One</i>.” The agreement is not entire, inasmuch as here<i> another angel</i>, and not one of the seven, presently offers the prayers of the saints. These are not the archangels, nor are they the seven spirits of ch. iv. 5: nor again are they merely seven angels selected on account of the seven trumpets: this is entirely precluded by the article,<b> the</b><i> seven angels which stand</i>, &c. It is clear that the passage in Tobit and the words here refer to the same matter, and that the fact was part of that revelation with regard to the order and employments of the holy angels, which seems to have taken place during the captivity),<b> and there were given to them seven trumpets</b> (understand, with intent that they themselves should blow them).{3}<b>And another angel</b> (not to be identified with<i> Christ</i>, as is done by Bede, Vitringa, Calovius, and others, and recently [for doctrinal reasons] by Elliott: for thus confusion is introduced into the whole imagery of the vision, in which the Lord Jesus is<i> otherwise</i> present, viz., as the Lamb in the midst of the throne. In ch. v. 8, we have the twenty-four elders falling down with vials containing the prayers of the saints: here we have an angel offering incense that it may mingle with the prayers on the heavenly altar. Any theological difficulty which belongs to the one belongs also to the other; and it is a canon which we must strictly observe in interpretation, that we are not, on account of supposed doctrinal propriety, to depart from the plain meaning of words. In ch. vii. 2 we have “<i>another angel</i>” in the sense of a created angel [see note there]: and would it be probable that St. John would after this, and I may add with his constant usage of the term throughout the book for angel in its ordinary sense, designate our Lord by this title?” There is something to me far more revolting from theological propriety in such a supposition, than in an angel being seen in the heavenly ministrations offering incense to mix with the prayers of the saints. It ought really to be needless to remark, in thus advocating consistency of verbal interpretation, that no countenance is hereby given to the invocation of angels: the whole truth of their being and ministration protesting against such an inference. They are simply<i> ministering spirits</i>, and the action here described is a portion of that their ministry.<i> Through Whom</i> the prayers are offered, we all know. He is our only Mediator and channel of grace)<b> came and stood over</b> (so that his form appeared above it; the altar being between the Apostle and him)<b> the altar</b> (viz. the altar named ch. vi. 9, as the repetition of the word with the article shews: see below on ver. 5),<b> having a golden censer</b> (the word used signifies elsewhere the<i> frankincense</i> itself. But here it unquestionably means a<i> censer;</i> see below, ver. 5, where the word is the same. No argument can be derived from the censer being a golden one. The spirit of the heavenly imagery will account for this without going further: we have, throughout, crowns [iv. 4], incense-vials [v. 8], vengeance-vials, [xv. 7], girdles [xv. 6], a measuring-reed [xxi. 15], &c., all of the costly metal).<b> And there was given to him</b> (viz. by divine appointment, through those ministering: not, by the saints who offered the: prayers, for tio reasons: 1) because the incense is mentioned as something distinct from the prayers of the saints; see below: 2) because no forcing of the expression,<b> there was given unto him</b>, will extract this meaning from it. It is a frequent apocalyptic formula in reference to those things or instruments with which, or actions by which, the ministrations necessary to the progress of the visions are performed: compare ch. vi. 2, 4 [twice], 8, 11, vii. 2, viii. 2, ix. 1, &c.)<b> much incense</b> (see ch. v. 8, and on the difference of the imagery, below),<b> that he might give it to</b> (so literally: various renderings and supplyings of the construction have been devised: but the simple dative after “<i>give it</i>” appears the only legitimate one: and the sense as expressed by Calovius, “that he might add it to the prayers of the saints, and so make them prayers of sweet savour.” The object was, to<i> incense</i> the prayers of the Saints: on the import, see below)<b> the prayers of all the saints</b> (not only now of those martyred ones in ch. vi. 9: the trumpets which follow are in answer to the whole prayers of God’s church. The martyrs’ cry for vengeance is the loudest note, but all join)<b> upon</b> (the preposition in the original carries the idea of<i> motion</i> with it; which thus incensed were offered on the golden altar, &c. From what follows it would seem that the prayers were already before God: see below)<b> the altar of gold which was before the throne</b> (this may be a different altar from that over which the angel was standing; or it may be the same further specified. The latter alternative seems the more probable. We must not imagine that we have in these visions a counterpart of the Jewish tabernacle, or attempt to force the details into accordance with its arrangements. No such correspondence has been satisfactorily made ont: indeed to assume such here would be perhaps inconsistent with ch. xi. 19, where first the temple of God in heaven is opened. A general analogy, in the use and character of the heavenly furniture, is all that we can look for).{4}<b>And the smoke of the incense ascended to</b> (such again seems to be the only legitimate rendering of the dative in the original. The common one, “<i>with</i>,” cannot be justified. The prayers, being already offered, received the smoke of the incense. The whole imagery introduces the fact that those prayers are about to be answered in the following judgments)<b> the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the angel, before God</b> (notice, that no countenance is given by this vision to the idea of angelic intercession. The angel is simply a minister. The incense [importing here, we may perhaps say, acceptability owing to the ripeness of the season in the divine purposes, so that the prayers, lying unanswered before, become, by the fulness of the time, acceptable as regards an immediate reply] is<i> given</i> to him: he merely wafts the incense up, so that it mingles with the prayers. Düsterdieck well remarks, that the angel, in performing sacerdotal offices, is but a fellow-servant of the saints [ch. xix. 10], who are themselves priests [ch. i. 6, v. 10, vii. 15]).
