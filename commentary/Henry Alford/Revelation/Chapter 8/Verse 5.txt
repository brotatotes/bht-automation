<b> 5.]</b><b> And the angel took the censer</b> (after having used it as above, i.e. shaken from it the incense on the altar)<b> and filled it</b> (while the smoke was ascending)<b> from the fire of the altar</b> (i. e. from the ashes which were on the altar),<b> and cast it</b> (i. e. the fire with which the censer was filled: the hot ashes)<b> towards the earth</b> (to signify that the answer to the prayers was about to descend in the fire of God’s vengeance: see below, and compare Ezek. x. 2):<b> and there took place thunders and lightnings and voices and an earthquake</b> ( “by means of the prayers of the saints,” says Cornelius-a-lapide, “praying for vengeance on the ungodly and their persecutors, the fire of vengeance, viz. thunders, lightnings, and the following plagues of the seven angels and trumpets, was sent down on the ungodly.” All these immediate consequences of the casting down of the hot ashes on the earth are the symbolic precursors of the divine judgments about to be inflicted).<br><br> One point must here be noticed: the intimate connexion between the act of this incense-offering angel) and the seven trumpets which follow. It belongs to them all; it takes place when now the seven angels have had their trumpets given them, and this series of visions is introduced. So that every interpretation must take this into account: remembering that the judgments which follow are answers to the prayers of the saints, and are inflicted on the enemies of the church.
