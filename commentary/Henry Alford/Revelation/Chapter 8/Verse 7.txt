<b> 7</b>.]<b> And the first blew his trumpet, and there took place hail and fire mingled in blood</b> (i. e. the hail<i> and</i> the fire were mingled together in blood, as their flux or vehicle; the stones of hail and the halls of fire [not<i> lightning</i>] fell in a shower of blood, just as hail and fireballs commonly fall in&shower of rain. There is here manifestly an allusion to the plague of hail in Egypt, of which it is said that “the fire ran along upon the ground:” “<i>there was hail and fire mingled with the hail</i>,” Exod. ix. 24: but with the addition of the blood. With regard to this latter, we may remark, that both here and under the vials, where the earth, seas, and rivers are again the objects of the first three judgments,<i> blood</i> is a feature common to all three. It appears rather to indicate a general character of the judgments, than to require any special interpretation in each particular ease, In blood is life: in the shedding, or in the appearing, of blood, is implied the destruction of life, with which, as a consequence, all these judgements must be accompanied),<b> and it was case into the earth</b> (towards the surface of the earth):<b> and the third part</b> (this expression first occurring here, it will be well once for all to enquire into its meaning in these prophecies. I may first say, that all<i> special</i> interpretations seem to me utterly to have failed; e.g. that of Eliott, which would understand it of a tripartite division of the Roman Empire at the time to which he assigns this judgment. It is fatal to this whole class of interpretations, that it is not said the hail&c. were<i> cast on a third part</i>, but that the destruction occasioned by them<i> extended</i> to a third part of the earth on which they were cast. And this is most expressly declared to be so in this first case, by<i> all green grass</i> being also destroyed, not a third part: a fact of which this interpretation takes no notice. It is this mixture of the fractional third with other designations of extent of mischief, which will lend us I believe to the right interpretation. We find it again under the third trumpet, where the star Wormwood is cast “<i>on</i><b> the third part</b><i> of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters</i>:” the result being that<i> the third part of the waters</i> was embittered. This lax usage would of itself lead us to suppose that: we are not to look for strict definiteness in the interpretation. And if we refer to the prophecy in Zech. xiii. 7 ff., where the import is to announce judgment on a greater part and the escape of a remnant, we find the same tripartite division: “<i>And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts therein shall be cut off and die, but the third shall be left therein. And I will bring the third part through the fire, &c</i>.” Nay, in the Apocalypse itself, we have<i> the third part</i> used where the sense can hardly but be similarly indefinite: e.g., under the sixth trumpet, ch. ix. 15, 18, and xii. 4, where it is said that the dragon’s tail “<i>draweth the third part of the stars of heaven</i>:” the use of the<i> present</i> shewing that it is rather a general power, than a particular event which is designated. Compare again the use of “<i>the fourth part the earth</i>,” in ch. vi. 8, and of “<i>the tenth part of the city</i>,” in ch. xi. 13. All these seem to shew, that such prophetic expressions are to be taken rather in their import as to amount, than in any strict fractional division. Here, for instance, I would take the pervading<b> third part</b> as signifying, that though the judgment is undoubtedly, as to extent, fearful and sweeping, yet that God in inflicting it, spares more than he smites: two-thirds escape in each case, while one is smitten)<b> of the earth</b> (i. e. plainly of the surface of the earth, and that, of the cultivated soil, which admitted of such a devastation)<b> was burnt up</b> (so that the<i> fire</i> prevails in the plague, not the hail nor the blood),<b> and the third part of the trees</b> (in all the earth, not in the third part)<b> was burnt up, and all green grass</b> (upon earth: no longer a third part: possibly because green grass would first and unavoidably every where scorch up at the approach of such a plague, whereas the hardier crops and trees might partially escape)<b> was burnt up</b>.
