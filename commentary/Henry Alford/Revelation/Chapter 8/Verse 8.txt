<p><strong> 8</strong> .] <strong> And the second angel blew his trumpet: and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea</strong> (first, by the <strong> ὡς</strong> , that which was cast into the sea was <em> not a mountain</em> , but only a burning mass so large as to look like one. Then, it was <em> this mass itself</em> , not any thing proceeding from it, which was cast down. So that the introduction of a <em> volcano</em> into the imagery is quite unjustifiable. In the language (hardly in the sense) there seems to be a reminiscence of Jeremiah 28:25, δώσω σε ὡς ὄρος ἐμπεπυρισμένον . It is remarkable that there the ὄρος should be characterized as τὸ διεφθαρμένον τὸ διαφθεῖρον πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν : cf. our ch. Rev 11:18 ), <strong> and the third part of the sea became blood</strong> (so in the Egyptian plague the Nile and all the Egyptian waters. By the <em> non-consequence</em> of the <em> result</em> of the fiery mass falling into the sea (so De W., “ <em> eine Wirkung ohne Analogie</em> ”) is again represented to us that in the infliction of this plague from above, the instrument of it is merely described as it appeared ( <strong> ὡς</strong> ), not as it really was. So that all ideas imported into the interpretation which take the <em> mountain</em> , or the <em> fiery</em> character of it, as elements in the symbolism, are departures from the real intent of the description): <strong> and the third part of the creatures</strong> (reff.) ( <strong> that were</strong> ) <strong> in the sea</strong> (not, as Elliott, “in the third part of the sea,” but in the whole. Nor again must we stretch ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ to mean the maritime coasts, nor the islands, nor the transmarine provinces: a usage not even shewn to exist by the examples cited by him, vol. i. p. 344 note: nor by Tacitus’s “ <em> plenum exsiliis mare</em> ;” any more than, if we were to say “the sea is full of emigrants from Ireland,” we should by “ <em> the sea</em> ” mean “ <em> the ships</em> ”) <strong> died</strong> (cf. Exo 7:17-21 ) <strong> those which have life</strong> (animal souls: see reff.: and for the appositional nominative, ch. Rev 2:20 reff.), <strong> and the third part of the ships were destroyed</strong> (another inconsequent result, and teaching us as before.

<p>We may remark, at the end of this second trumpet, that the judgments inflicted by these first two are distinctly those which in ch. Rev 7:3 were held back until the servants of God were sealed: μὴ ἀδικήσητε τὴν <strong> γῆν</strong> μήτε τὴν <strong> θάλασσαν</strong> μήτε τὰ <strong> δένδρα</strong> , ἄχρι σφραγίσωμεν κ . τ . λ . So that, as before generally remarked, the place of these trumpet-plagues must be sought <em> after</em> that sealing: and consequently (see there) in very close conjunction with the day of the Lord itself).</p>
