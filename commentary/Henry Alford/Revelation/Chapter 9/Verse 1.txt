<b>And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen</b> (not, as A.V.<i> fall</i>, which gives an entirely wrong view of the transactions of the vision. The star had fallen before, and is first seen as thus fallen)<b> out of heaven to the earth</b> (the reader will at once think on Isa. xiv. 12, “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!” And on Luke x. 18, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” And, doubtless, as the personal import of this star is made clear in the following words, such is the reference here. We may also notice that this expression forms a connecting link to another place, ch. xii. 9, in this book, where Satan is represented as cast out of heaven to the earth: see notes there. It is hardly possible, with some Commentators, to understand a<i> good angel</i> by this fallen star. His description, as well as his work, corresponds only to an agent of evil. Andreas is obliged to distort words to bring in view: “<i>descended</i> upon earth; for this is meant by<b> fallen</b>,” is enough to condemn any interpretation)<b>,</b><b> and there was given to him</b> (<b>was given</b>, as usual, for the purpose of the part which he is to bear in the vision)<b> the key of the pit of the abyss</b> (viz. of hell, which in the vision is a vast profundity opening by a pit or shaft upon the surface of the earth, imagined as shut down by a cover, and locked. This abyss is in the Apocalypse the habitation of the devil and his angels: compare ver. 11, ch. xx. 1, 3: see also ch. xi. 7, xvii. 8. See further in note on ch. xx. 10)<b>,
