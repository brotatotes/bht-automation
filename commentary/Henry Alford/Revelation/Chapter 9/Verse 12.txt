<b>The one</b> (first)<b> woe hath passed: behold, there cometh</b> (singular, the verb applying simply to that which is future, without reference as yet to its plurality)<b> two woes after these things.</b><b> T</b> here is an endless Babel of allegorical and historical interpretation of these<i> locusts from the pit</i>. The most that we can say of their import is, that they belong to a series of judgments on the ungodly which will immediately precede the second advent of our Lord: that the various und mysterious particulars of the vision will no doubt clear themselves up to the church of God, when the time of its fulfilment arrives: but that no such clearing up has yet taken place, a very few hours of research among histories of apocalyptic interpretation will serve to convince any reader who is not himself the servant of a preconceived system.
