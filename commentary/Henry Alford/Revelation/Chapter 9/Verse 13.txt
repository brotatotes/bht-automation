<b>And the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice</b> (literally,<b> one</b> voice: but it is doubtful, in the uncertain authenticity of the word<i> four</i>, whether any stress is to be laid on this<b> one</b> or not. Vitringa gives it the emphasis,—<i> “that the four horns simultaneously uttered, not a diverse, but, one and the same voice:</i>” and so Hengstenberg. The allegorical interpreters give it various imports—the agreement of the four Gospels,—that of the prayers of exiled Jews, &c.)<b> out of the [four] horns of the golden altar which was before God</b> (the same altar as that previously mentioned in ch. viii. 3 and vi. 9, where see notes. From ch. xvi. 7 it would appear that the voice probably proceeded from the altar itself, represented as uttering the cry of vengeance for the blood shed on it; compare ch. vi. 9, with which cry of the martyred saints the whole series of retributive judgments is connected. The reading of the Sinaitic MS.<br><br> [<i>The reading is uncertain. We have here but two very ancient MSS., and of those the Alexandrine omits</i> four<i>, while the Sinaitic omits altogether the words</i> from the four horns of:<i> reading,</i> I heard the voice of the golden altar, &c.]<br><br> is very remarkable, and may represent the original text. To suppose that the cry from the altar is indicative of an altar having been the scene of some special sin on the part of the men of Roman Christendom, and so to apply it to the perversions of Christian rites in the Romish Church, is surely to confuse the whole imagery of the vision. For it is not of<i> any altar</i> in the abstract that we are reading, but of<i> the golden altar which was before God</i>, where the prayers of the saints had been offered by the angel, ch. viii. 3, 5: and the voice is the result of those prayers, in accordance with which those judgments are inflicted.
