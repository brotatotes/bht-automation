<b>saying to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet</b> (viz. that one now before us,—belonging to the present vision)<b>, Loose</b> (it is too much to say that the angel himself is made the active minister of this loosing: we do not read “<i>and he went and loosed</i>” following, but simply “and the four angels, &c.<i> were loosed.</i>” We must therefore believe that the command is given to him only in so far as he is the representative and herald of all that takes place under his trumpet-blowing)<b> the four</b><b> angels which are bound</b> (so A.V. rightly: “<i>are</i> bound” is the true perfect passive, not “have been bound”)<b> on</b> (not “<i>in</i>,” as A.V.)<b> the great river Euphrates</b> (the whole imagery here has been a crux of the interpreters: as to who these angels are, and what is indicated by the locality here described. I will only venture to point out, amidst the surging tumult of controversy, one or two points of apparent refuge to which we<i> must not</i> betake ourselves. First, we must not yield to the temptation, so attractive at first sight, of identifying these four angels with the four angels standing on the four corners of the earth and holding in the four winds, in ch. vii. 1 ff. For the mission of these angels is totally distinct from theirs, as the locality is also. There is not a syllable of<i> winds</i> here, nor any hurting of earth, sea, or trees. Secondly, the question need not perplex us here, whether these are good or bad angels: for it does not enter in any way into consideration. They simply appear, as in other parts of this book, as ministers of the divine purposes, and pass out of view as soon as mentioned. Here, it would almost seem as if the angelic persons were little more than personifications: for they are immediately resolved into the host of cavalry. Thirdly, that there is nothing in the text to prevent “the great river Euphrates” from being meant literally. Düsterdicek maintains, that because the rest of the vision has a mystical meaning, therefore this local designation must have one also: and that if we are to take the Euphrates literally and the rest mystically, endless confusion would be introduced. But this is quite a mistake, as the slightest consideration will shew. It is a common practice in Scripture allegory to intermingle with its mystic language literal designations of time and place. Take for instance the allegory in Ps. lxxx. 8, 11, “Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt.... it sent out its boughs unto the sea, and its branches unto the river:” where, though the vine and its boughs and branches are mystical, Egypt, the sea, and the river, are all literal. See some good remarks on this in Mr. Elliott’s 1st vol., p. 331 ff., where the above example is cited among others).
