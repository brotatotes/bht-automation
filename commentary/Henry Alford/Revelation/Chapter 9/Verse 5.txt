<b>And it was given to them</b> (allotted to them by God as the limit of their appointed work and office: here the statement expresses rather the limitation than the extension of the grant)<b> that they should not kill them</b> (the unsealed)<b>, but that they</b> (the unsealed: the subject is changed)<b> shall be tormented five months</b> (the reason seems to be correct, which several Commentators have given for this number being chosen: viz. that five months is the ordinary time in the year during which locusts commit their ravages. At all events we are thus in some measure delivered from the endless perplexities of capricious fancy in which the historical interpreters involve us):<b> and their torment</b> (i. e. that of the sufferers)<b> is as the torment of</b> (arising from)<b> a scorpion, when it has smitten</b> (by its bite or sting)<b> a man.
