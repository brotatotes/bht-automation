And in those days men shall seek death</b> (observe the transition of the style from the descriptive to the prophetic. For the first time the Apostle ceases to be the exponent, of what he saw, and becomes the direct organ of the Spirit)<b>, and shall not find it: and they shall vehemently desire</b> (<i>desire</i> alone is not strong enough)<b> to die, and death fleeth</b> (the pres., of the<i> habitual</i> avoidance in those days)<b> from them</b> (the longing to die arises from the excruciating pain of the sting. See Jer. viii. 3.<br><br> I cannot forbear noticing as we pass, the caprice of historical interpreters. On the command<i> not to kill</i> the men, &c., in ver. 5, our principal modern historical interpreter says, “i. e. not to annihilate them as a political Christian body.” If then the same rule of interpretation is to hold, the present verse must mean that the “political Christian body” will be so sorely beset by these Mahometan locusts, that it will vehemently desire to be annihilated, and not find any way. For it surely cannot be allowed that the<i> killing of men</i> should be said of their annihilation as a political body in one verse, and their<i> desiring to die</i> in the next should be said of something totally different, and applicable to their individual misery).
