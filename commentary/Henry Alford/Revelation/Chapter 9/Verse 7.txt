<b> 7.]</b> The Apostle now returns to the description of the locusts themselves.<b> And the shapes of the locusts</b> [<b>were</b>]<b> like horses made ready for war</b> (this resemblance,—compare Joel ii. 4, “<i>the appearance</i><i> of them is as the appearance of horses</i>,”—has been noticed by travellers. Ewald remarks that one German name for the grasshopper is<i> Heu-pferd</i>, the<i> grass-horse</i>. And especially does the likeness hold good when the horse is equipped for war; the plates of the horse’s armour being represented by the hard laminæ of the outer shell of the locust: see below, ver. 9)<b>, and on their heads as it were crowns like unto gold</b> (it is not easy to say what this part of the description imports.

The appearance of a turban, even when ornamented with gold, is hardly<i> golden</i>. I should understand the words, of the head actually ending in a crown-shaped fillet which resembled gold in its material, just as the wings of some of the beetle tribe might be said to blaze with gold and gems. So we have below, “<i>they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron:</i>” the material not being metallic, but only as it were metallic.
