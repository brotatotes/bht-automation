<b> 1. A servant of Jesus Christ</b>] So also Phil. i. 1, and Tit. i, 1 ( “<i>a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ</i>”),—but usually “<i>an apostle of Jesus Christ</i>” (or, “<i>of Christ Jesus</i>”) (2 Cor., Eph., Col., 1 Tim., 2 Tim.): “a [called] apostle of Jesus Christ” (1 Cor.),—simply “<i>an apostle</i>” (Gal.),— “<i>a prisoner of Jesus Christ</i>” (Philem.). The expression ‘servant of God” is the especial Old Test. title of Israel, and of individuals, as Moses, Joshua, David, Daniel, Job, and others, who as prophets, kings, &c., were raised up for the express work of God.<b> Servant</b> must not be rendered “<i>slave</i>,” nor merely “<i>pious worshipper</i>:” because the former excludes the element of freewill, while the latter does not express the entire dedication to Christ.<br><br><b> called to be an apostle]</b> In naming himself a<i> servant of Jesus Christ</i>, he bespeaks their attention as a<i> Christian speaking to Christians</i>: he now further specifies the<i> place which he held by the special calling of God</i>;<b> called</b>, and that to the very highest office, of<b> an apostle</b>; and even more—among the Apostles, not one by original selection, but one<i> specially called</i>. “The rest of the apostles were educated by long intercourse with Jesus, and were called first to follow Him and obey Him, then put forth as Apostles. Paul, before time a persecutor, was suddenly made an Apostle by special calling. In like manner, the Jews were God’s people by promise: the Greeks, by simple calling. Thus the<i> called apostle</i> had a similitude and relation to the<i> called saints</i>.” Bengel.<br><br><b> apostle</b> must not be taken here in the wider sense, of a<i> missionary</i>, as in ch. xvi. 7, but in its higher and peculiar meaning, in which the Twelve bore the title ( “<i>whom he also named apostles</i>,” Luke vi. 13), and Paul (and perhaps Barnabas), and James the Lord’s brother. This title was not conferred on Paul by the separation ordered by the Holy Spirit, Acts xiii. 2,<i> but in virtue of his special call by the Lord in person</i>; compare the expression “<i>a chosen vessel</i>” ( “<i>a vessel of choice</i>”), Acts ix. 15, with “<i>Have not I chosen you twelve</i>?” John vi. 70; also compare John xiii. 18; xv. 16 Acts i. 2. “I cannot agree,” says Calvin, “with those who refer this word—<b>called</b>—to Paul’s personal eternal election of God.”<br><br><b> separated</b>] not as in Acts xiii. 2 merely, though that was a particular application of the general truth:—but (as in Gal. i. 15) “<i>God, who separated me from my mother’s womb.</i>” “The same idea of<i> separation</i> is at the root of the word<i> Pharisee</i>: but here Paul signifies that he was separated by God, not only from among men, from among Jews, from among the disciples, but even from among teachers themselves.” Bengel.<br><br><b> unto</b><b> i.e. for the purpose of announcing. the gospel of God</b>] i.e.<b> the good tidings sent by</b> (not concerning)<b> God</b>. The genitive is not, as in “<i>the Gospel of the kingdom</i>,” Matt. iv. 23, Mark i. 14, one of apposition, but of<i> possession</i> or origin;<b> God’s Gospel</b>. And so, whenever the expression ‘<i>the Gospel of Christ</i>’ occurs, it is not ‘the Gospel<i> about</i> Christ,’ but<i> Christ’s Gospel</i>; that Gospel which flows out of His grace, and is His gift to men.—Thus in the very beginning of the Epistle, these two short words announce that the Gospel is<i> of God</i>,—in other words, that<i> salvation is of grace only</i>.
