<b> 1. A servant of Jesus Christ</b>] So also Phil. i. 1, and Tit. i, 1 ( “<i>a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ</i>”),—but usually “<i>an apostle of Jesus Christ</i>” (or, “<i>of Christ Jesus</i>”) (2 Cor., Eph., Col., 1 Tim., 2 Tim.): “a [called] apostle of Jesus Christ” (1 Cor.),—simply “<i>an apostle</i>” (Gal.),— “<i>a prisoner of Jesus Christ</i>” (Philem.). The expression ‘servant of God” is the especial Old Test. title of Israel, and of individuals, as Moses, Joshua, David, Daniel, Job, and others, who as prophets, kings, &c., were raised up for the express work of God.<b> Servant</b> must not be rendered “<i>slave</i>,” nor merely “<i>pious worshipper</i>:” because the former excludes the element of freewill, while the latter does not express the entire dedication to Christ.
