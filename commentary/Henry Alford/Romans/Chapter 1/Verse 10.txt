 10.   εἴ πως ]  if by any means . No subject of δεόμενος is expressed, but it is left to be gathered from this clause, as in Simon’s entreaty, Acts 8:24 , δεήθητε ὑμεῖς ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ .… ὅπως μηδὲν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ ʼ ἐμὲ ὧν εἰρήκατε , where ὅπως κ . τ . λ . is not the  contents of the prayer, but the  end aimed at by it.
	 ἤδη ποτέ ]  before long : lit., ‘  at last, some day or other .’
	 εὐοδωθήσομαι ]  I shall be allowed, prospered : see reff., and Deuteronomy 28:29 ; and cf. Umbreit’s note. The rendering, ‘  I might have a prosperous journey ’ (Vulg. and E.V.), is etymologically incorrect; the passive of ὁδόω , ‘  to shew the way,’ ‘to bring into the way ,’ must be ‘  to be shewn the way,’ or ‘  brought into the way.’ So Herod. vi. 73, ὡς τῷ Κλεομενεϊ εὐωδώθη τὸ ἐς τὸν Δημάρητον πρῆγμα .
	 ἐν τῷ θελ  .   τοῦ θεοῦ ]  In the course of, by, the will of God.   ἐλθεῖν belongs to εὐοδωθήσομαι , not to δεόμενος .
