<b> 11. that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift</b>] That the<i> gift</i> here spoken of was no mere supernatural power of working in the Spirit, the whole context shews, as well as the meaning of the word itself in ch. v. 15, 16; vi. 23. And even if the word barely taken, could ever (1 Cor. xii. 4, 9 are no examples, see there) mean technically a<i> supernatural endowment of the Spirit</i>, yet the epithet<i> spiritual</i>, and the object of imparting this gift,<i> confirmation in the faith</i>, would here preclude that meaning. Besides, St. Paul did not value the mere bestowal of these ‘gifts’ so highly, as to make it the subject of his earnest prayers incessantly. The gift alluded to was the comfort (mutual confirmation in the faith) spoken of below.
