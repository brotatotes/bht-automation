<b> 12.</b>] “Then since this saying seemed to assume too much to himself, see how he tempers it by what he puts after it. ‘That, they might not say, What? are we unsteady and wavering, and want thy tongue in order that we may stand firmly? he anticipates this objection, and precludes such an answer by saying (as in ver. 12). It is as if he had said, Do not suppose that I said it, finding fault with you: it was not with this view that I spoke the words; but this is what I wished to say: Ye are undergoing many trials in being harassed by your persecutors: I therefore desired to see you that I may comfort you,—or rather not that I only may comfort you, but may myself also receive comfort from you.” Chrysostom. See the same wish expressed in differentwords ch, xv, 32, and the partial realization of it, Acts xxviii. 15. The A.V. has,<i> by the mutual faith both of you and me</i>. This is hardly the proper use of the word mutual, which should mean,<i> faith which each has in the other</i>; whereas the comfort here is to spring from the faith which each sees in the other. The rendering in the text is therefore to be preferred.<b> Faith</b> is used in the most general sense—<i>faith</i> as the necessary condition and working instrument of all Christian exhortation, comfort, and confirmation; producing these, and evidenced by them.
