<b> 13. I would not have you ignorant</b>] A Pauline formula: see references. The words<b> but was hindered hitherto</b> are best as a parenthesis, The<i> reason of the hindrance</i> is given in ch. xv. 20–22: it was,<i> his scrupulous care to preach the gospel where it had not been preached before, rather than on the foundation of others</i>.<br><br><b> some fruit</b>] The meaning is not. here ‘wages,’ or ‘result of my apostolic labour,’ for such is not the ordinary meaning of the word in the New Test., but<i> fruit borne by you</i> who have been planted to bring forth fruit to God. This fruit I should then gather and present to God; compare the figure in ch. xv. 16: see also Phil. i. 22 and note.
