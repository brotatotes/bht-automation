<p><strong> 13. </strong> <strong> οὐ θέλω δὲ ὑμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] A Pauline formula: see reff.
	</p>
<p><strong> καὶ ἐκωλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἄχρι τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> δεῦρο</strong> is best as a parenthesis, as it is impossible that ἵνα can depend on ἐκωλύθην . So Demosth. p. 488. 7, ἐμοὶ δ ʼ, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθ ., δοκεῖ Λεπτίνης ( καί μοι πρὸς Διὸς μηδὲν ὀργισθῇς · οὐδὲν γὰρ φλαῦρον ἐρῶ σε ) ἢ οὐκ ἀνεγνωκέναι τοὺς Σόλωνος νόμους ἢ οὐ συνιέναι .

<p>The <em> reason of the hindrance</em> is given in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:20-22">Romans 15:20-22</span> ; it was, <em> his</em> φιλοτιμία <em> to preach the gospel where it had not been preached before, rather than on the foundation of others</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> καρπόν</strong> ] Not, ‘wages,’ or ‘result of my apostolic labour,’ for such is not the ordinary meaning of the word in the N. T., but <em> fruit borne by you</em> who have been planted to bring forth fruit to God. This fruit I should then gather and present to God; cf. the figure in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:16">Romans 15:16</span> ; see also Php 1:22 and note.</p>
