 13.   οὐ θέλω δὲ ὑμ  .   ἀγ  . ] A Pauline formula: see reff.
	 καὶ ἐκωλ  .   ἄχρι τ  .   δεῦρο is best as a parenthesis, as it is impossible that ἵνα can depend on ἐκωλύθην . So Demosth. p. 488. 7, ἐμοὶ δ ʼ, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθ ., δοκεῖ Λεπτίνης ( καί μοι πρὸς Διὸς μηδὲν ὀργισθῇς · οὐδὲν γὰρ φλαῦρον ἐρῶ σε ) ἢ οὐκ ἀνεγνωκέναι τοὺς Σόλωνος νόμους ἢ οὐ συνιέναι .
	The  reason of the hindrance is given in ch. Romans 15:20-22 ; it was,  his φιλοτιμία  to preach the gospel where it had not been preached before, rather than on the foundation of others .
	 καρπόν ] Not, ‘wages,’ or ‘result of my apostolic labour,’ for such is not the ordinary meaning of the word in the N. T., but  fruit borne by you who have been planted to bring forth fruit to God. This fruit I should then gather and present to God; cf. the figure in ch. Romans 15:16 ; see also Php 1:22 and note.
