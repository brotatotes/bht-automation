<p><strong> 14.</strong> ] The connexion seems to be this: He wishes to have some fruit, some produce of expended labour, among the Romans as among other Gentiles. Till this was the case, he himself was a <em> debtor</em> to every such people: which situation of <em> debtor</em> he wished to change, by paying the debt and conferring a benefit, into that of one having money out at interest there, and yielding a καρπός . The debt which he owed to all nations was ( Rom 1:15 ) the obligation laid on him to preach the gospel to them; see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:16">1 Corinthians 9:16</span> .

<p><strong> Ἕλλ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> βαρβ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σοφ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀνοήτ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] These words must not be pressed as applying to any particular churches, or as if any one of them designated the Romans themselves, or even as if σοφοῖς belonged to Ἕλλησιν , and ἀνοήτοις to βαρβάροις . They are used, apparently, merely as comprehending <em> all Gentiles</em> , whether considered in regard of race or of intellect; and are placed here certainly not without a prospective reference to the universality of guilt, and need of the gospel, which he is presently about to prove existed in the Gentile world.

<p>Notice that he does not call himself a debtor to the <em> Jews</em> for they can hardly be included in <strong> βαρβάροις</strong> (see Col 3:11 ). Though he had earnest desires for them (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:1-3">Romans 9:1-3</span> ; Rom 10:1 ), and every where preached to them first, this was not his peculiar ὀφείλημα , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7">Galatians 2:7</span> , where he describes himself as πεπιστευμένος <strong> τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς ἀκροβυστίας</strong> , καθὼς Πέτρος τῆς περιτομῆς .</p>
