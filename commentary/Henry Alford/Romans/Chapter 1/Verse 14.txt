 14. ] The connexion seems to be this: He wishes to have some fruit, some produce of expended labour, among the Romans as among other Gentiles. Till this was the case, he himself was a  debtor to every such people: which situation of  debtor he wished to change, by paying the debt and conferring a benefit, into that of one having money out at interest there, and yielding a καρπός . The debt which he owed to all nations was ( Rom 1:15 ) the obligation laid on him to preach the gospel to them; see 1 Corinthians 9:16 .

They are used, apparently, merely as comprehending  all Gentiles , whether considered in regard of race or of intellect; and are placed here certainly not without a prospective reference to the universality of guilt, and need of the gospel, which he is presently about to prove existed in the Gentile world.

Romans 9:1-3 ; Rom 10:1 ), and every where preached to them first, this was not his peculiar ὀφείλημα , see Galatians 2:7 , where he describes himself as πεπιστευμένος  τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς ἀκροβυστίας , καθὼς Πέτρος τῆς περιτομῆς .
