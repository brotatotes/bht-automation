The debt which he owed to all nations was (ver. 15) the obligation laid on him to preach the gospel to them: see 1 Cor. ix. 16.<br><br><b> Greeks</b>—<b>Barbarians</b>—<b>wise</b>—<b>unwise</b>] These words must not be pressed as applying to any particular churches, or as if any one of them designated the Romans themselves,—or even as if<b> wise</b> belonged to<b> Greeks</b> and<b> unwise</b> to<b> Barbarians</b>. They are used, apparently, merely as comprehending<i> all Gentiles</i>, whether considered in regard of race or of intellect; and are placed here certainly not without a prospective reference to the universality of guilt, and need of the gospel, which he is presently about to prove existed in the Gentile world.—Notice that he does not call himself a debtor to the<i> Jews</i>—for they can hardly be included under the designation Barbarians (see Col. iii. 11).
