<p><strong> 16.</strong> ] The <strong> οὐ γὰρ ἐπαισχύνομαι</strong> seems to be suggested by the <em> position of the Romans in the world</em> . ‘Yea, to you at Rome also: for, though your city is mistress of the world, though your emperors are worshipped as present deities, though you are elated by your pomps and luxuries and victories, yet I am not ashamed of the apparently mean origin of the gospel which I am to preach; for (and here is the transition to his great theme) it is,’ &amp;c. So for the most part, Chrysostom, Hom. iii. p. 444.
	</p>
<p><strong> δύναμις γὰρ θ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐστίν</strong> ] The gospel, which is the greatest example of the Power of God, he strikingly calls <em> that Power itself</em> . (Not, as Jowett, ‘ <em> a divine power</em> ,’ nor is δικαιος . θεοῦ below to be thus explained, as he alleges.) So in 1Co 1:24 he calls Christ, <em> the Power of God</em> . But not only is the gospel the great example of divine Power; it is the <em> field of agency</em> of the power of God, working in it, and interpenetrating it throughout.
	</p>
<p>The bare substantive δύναμις here (and 1Co 1:24 ) carries a <em> superlative</em> sense: the <em> highest and holiest vehicle</em> of the divine Power, the δύναμις κατ ʼ ἐξοχήν . “It is weighty for the difference between the Gospel and the Law, that the Law is never called God’s power, כֹחַ , but light, or teaching, in which a man must walk, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+36:10">Psalms 36:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+119:105">Psalms 119:105</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="pr+6:23">Proverbs 6:23</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:5">Isaiah 2:5</span> .” Umbreit. And the <em> direction in which</em> this power acts in the gospel is <strong> εἰς σωτηρίαν</strong> it is a <em> healing, saving power</em> : for as Chrysostom reminds us, there is a power of God εἰς κόλασιν , and εἰς ἀπώλειαν , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:28">Matthew 10:28</span> .
	</p>
<p>But <em> to whom</em> is this gospel the power of God to save? <strong> παντὶ τῷ πιστεύοντι</strong> . The <em> universality</em> implied in the παντί , the <em> condition</em> necessitated in the πιστεύοντι , and the δύναμις θεοῦ acting εἰς σωτηρίαν , are the great subjects treated of in the former part of this epistle. <em> All</em> are proved to be <em> under sin</em> , and so <em> needing God’s righteousness</em> (ch. Rom 1:18 to Rom 3:20 ), and the <em> entrance</em> into this righteousness is shewn to be <em> by faith</em> (ch. Rom 3:21 to Rom 5:11 ). Then the δύναμις θεοῦ in freeing from the dominion of sin and death, and as issuing in salvation, is set forth (ch. Rom 5:11 to Rom 8:39 ). So that if the subject of the Epistle is to be stated in few words, these should be chosen: <strong> τὸ εὐαγγέλιον</strong> <strong> , </strong> <strong> δύναμις θεοῦ εἰς σωτηρίαν παντὶ τῷ πιστεύοντι</strong> . This expresses it better than merely ‘ <em> justification by faith</em> ,’ which is in fact only a subordinate part of the great theme, only the <em> condition necessitated by man’s sinfulness for his entering the state of salvation</em> : whereas the argument extends <em> beyond this</em> , to the <em> death unto sin</em> and <em> life unto God</em> and <em> carrying forward of the sanctifying work of the Spirit</em> , from its first fruits even to its completion.

<p><strong> Ἰουδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> πρῶτον κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> Ἕλλ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] This is the <em> Jewish</em> expression for all mankind, as Ἕλλ . κ . βαρβ . Rom 1:14 is the <em> Greek</em> one. Ἕλλ . here includes <em> all Gentiles</em> . <strong> πρῶτον</strong> is not <em> first</em> in order of time, but <strong> principally</strong> (compare ch. Rom 2:9 ), spoken of <em> national precedence</em> , in the sense in which the Jews were to our Lord οἱ ἴδιοι , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:11">John 1:11</span> . Salvation was ἐκ τῶν Ἰουδαίων , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:22">John 4:22</span> . See ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:24">Romans 11:24</span> . Not that the Jew has any <em> preference</em> under the gospel; only he <em> inherits</em> , and has a <em> precedence</em> . οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πρῶτός ἐστι , καὶ πλέον λαμβάνει τῆς χάριτος · ἡ γὰρ αὐτὴ δωρεὰ καὶ τούτῳ κἀκείνῳ δίδοται · ἀλλὰ τάξεώς ἐστι τιμὴ μόνον τὸ <strong> πρῶτος</strong> . Chrys. Hom. iii. p. 445.</p>
