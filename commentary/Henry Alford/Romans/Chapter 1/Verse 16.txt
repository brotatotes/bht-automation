<b> 16.</b>] The words,<b> For I am not ashamed</b>, &c., seem to be suggested by the<i> position of the Romans in the world</i>. ‘Yea, to you at Rome also: for, though your city is mistress of the world, though your emperors are worshipped as present deities, though you are elated by your pomps and luxuries and victories, yet I am not ashamed of the apparently mean origin of the gospel which I am to preach; for (and here is the transition to his great theme) it is, &c.<br><br><b> for it is the power of God</b>] The gospel, which is the greatest example of the Power of God, he strikingly calls<i> that Power itself</i>. So in 1 Cor. i. 24 he calls Christ,<i> the Power of God</i>. But not only is the gospel the great example of divine Power; it is the<i> field of agency</i> of the power of God, working in it, and interpenetrating it throughout. In barely saying here that it is<b> the power</b> of God, the Apostle intends to convey (as also in 1 Cor. i. 24) a<i> superlative</i> sense; the<i> highest and holiest vehicle</i> of the divine Power, the power<i> by excellence</i>. “It is weighty for the difference between the Gospel and the Law, that the Law is never called<i> God’s power</i>, but<i> light</i>, or<i> teaching</i>, in which a man must walk, Ps. xxxvi. 10; cxix. 105; Prov. vi. 23; Isa. ii. 52.” Umbreit. And the<i> direction in which</i> this power acts in the gospel is<b> unto or towards salvation</b>—it is a<i> healing, saving power</i>: for as Chrysostom reminds us, there is a power of God<i> unto punishment</i>, and<i> unto destruction</i>, see Matt. x. 28.—But<i> to whom</i> is this gospel the power of God to save?<b> To every one that believeth</b>. The<i> universality</i> implied in<b> every one</b>, the<i> condition</i> necessitated in the qualification added, that believeth, and the<b> power of God</b> acting<b> unto salvation</b>, are the great subjects treated of in the former part of this Epistle.<i> All</i> are proved to be<i> under sin</i>, and so<i> needing God’s righteousness</i> (ch. i. 18–iii. 20), and the<i> entrance</i> into this righteousness is shewn to be<i> by fait</i> h (ch. iii. 21–v. 11). Then the<i> power of God</i> in freeing from the dominion of sin and death, and as issuing in salvation, is set forth (ch. v. 11–viii. 39). So that if the subject of the Epistle is to be stated in few words, these should be chosen:<b> the Gospel, the power of God unto salvation unto every one that believeth</b>. This expresses it better than merely ‘<i>justification by faith</i>, which is in fact only a subordinate part of the great theme,—only<i> the condition necessitated by man’s sinfulness for his entering the state of salvation</i>: whereas the argument extends<i> beyond this</i>, to the<i> death unto sin</i> and<i> life unto God</i> and<i> carrying forward of the sanctifying work of the Spirit</i>, from its first fruits even to its completion.<br><br><b> to the Jew first, and also to the Greek</b>] This is the<i> Jewish</i> expression for all mankind, as “<i>Greeks and Barbarians</i>,” ver. 14, is the Greek one. The term<b> Greek</b> here includes<i> all Gentiles</i>. The priority here mentioned is not in order of time, but is<b> principally</b> (comp. ch. ii. 9) spoken of<i> national precedence</i>, in the sense in which the Jews were to our Lord “<i>his own</i>,” John i. 11. Salvation was “<i>from the Jews</i>,” John iv. 22. See ch. ix. 5; xi. 24. Not that the Jew has any<i> preference</i> under the gospel; only he<i> inherits</i> and has a<i> precedence</i>.
