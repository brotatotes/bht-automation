<b> 17.</b>] An explanation,<i> how</i> the gospel is the<i> power</i><i> of God to salvation</i>, and how it is so<i> to the believer</i>:—because in it<b> God’s righteousness</b> (not His<i> attribute</i> of righteousness,— ‘the righteousness of God,’ but righteousness<i> flowing from</i>,<i> and acceptable to Him</i>) is unfolded, and the more, the more we believe. I subjoin De Wette’s note on the words. “The Greek and Hebrew words rendered ‘<i>righteousness</i>, are taken sometimes for ‘virtue” and ‘piety,’ which men possess or strive after,—sometimes imputatively, for ‘freedom from blame’ or ‘justification’ The latter meaning is most usual with Paul: ‘<i>righteousness</i>’ is that which is so in the sight of God (ch. ii. 13), the result of His justifying forensic Judgment, or of ‘<i>Imputation</i>’ (ch. iv. 5). It may certainly be imagined, that a man<i> might obtain</i> justification by<i> fulfilling the law</i>: in that case his righteousness is ‘<i>righteousness of his own</i>’ (ch. x. 3), a<i> righteousness springing from the law</i> (Phil. iii. 9). But it is impossible for him to obtain a ‘righteousness of his own,’ which at the same time shall avail before God (ch. iii. 20; Gal. ii. 16). The Jews not only<i> have</i> not fulfilled the law (ch. iii. 9–19), but<i> could not</i> fulfil it (vii. 7 ff.): the Gentiles likewise have rendered themselves obnoxious to the divine wrath (i. 24–32). God has ordained that the whole race should be included in disobedience. Now if man is to become righteous from being unrighteous,—this can only happen by God’s grace,—because God<i> declares him righteous</i>, assumes him to be righteous,<i> justifies</i> him (iii, 24; Gal. iii, 8):—to justify is not only negative, ‘<i>to acquit</i>,’ but also positive, ‘<i>to declare righteous</i>;’ but never “to make righteous’ by transformation, or imparting of moral strength by which moral perfection may be attained. Justification must be taken as the old protestant dogmatists rightly took it, in a<i> forensic</i> or<i> imputative</i> sense. God justifies for Christ’s sake (ch. iii. 22 ff.) on condition of faith in Him as Mediator: the result of<i> His justification is ‘righteousness by faith</i>, and as He imparts it freely, it is ‘<i>the righteousness of God</i>,’ or<i> from God</i> (so it ought to be), Phil. iii. 9. ‘<i>The righteousness of God</i>’ is ordinarily taken for<i> that which is righteousness with God in God’s sight</i>; compare<br><br> ch, ii, 3, iii. 20; Gal. iii. 11; but that this is at least not necessary, see 2 Cor. v. 21. This justification is certainly an<i> objective</i> act of God: but it must also be<i> subjectively</i> apprehended (i. e. within him who is the subject of it), as its<i> condition</i> is subjective, i.e. dependent on such inner reception by its subject. It is<i> the acquittal from guilt, and cheerfulness of conscience, attained through faith in God’s grace in Christ</i>,—the very frame of mind which would be proper to a perfectly righteous man—if such there were,—the harmony of the spirit with God,—peace with God. All interpretations which overlook the fact of imputation are erroneous.” To say, with Jowett, that all attempts to define<i> the righteousness of God</i> are “the afterthoughts of theology, which have no real place in the interpretation of Scripture,” is in fact to shut our eyes to the great doctrinal facts of Christianity, and float off at once into uncertainty about the very foundations of the Apostle’s argument and our own faith.<br><br><b> is revealed</b>] The verb in the original is generally used of<i> making known</i> a thing hitherto concealed: but here of that gradually more complete realization of the state of justification before God by faith in Christ, which is the continuing and increasing gift of God to the believer in the gospel.<br><br><b> from faith</b>] “<b>from</b> points to the condition, or the subjective ground. Faith is in the sense of<i> trust</i>, and that (1)<i> a trustful assumption of a truth</i> in reference to knowledge,—which is equivalent to conviction: (2)<i> a trustful surrender of the soul, as regards the feeling.</i> Here it is especially the latter of these: that trust reposed in God’s grace in Christ, which tranquillizes the soul and frees it from all guilt,—and especially trust in the atoning death of Jesus. Bound up with this (not by the meaning of the words, but by the idea of unconditional trust, which excludes all reserve) is<i> humility</i>, consisting in the abandonment of all merits of a man’s own, and recognition of his own unworthiness and need of redemption.” De Wette.<br><br><b> unto faith</b>] i.e.<i> to him that believes</i>. This seems the most probable interpretation, making<i> faith</i> almost equivalent to the<i> person possessing faith</i>, see ch. iii. 22: but not entirely,—it is still the aspect, the<i> phase</i>, of the man, which is receptive of the righteousness of God, and to this it is revealed. The other principal interpretation— ‘<i>proceeding from faith, and leading to a higher degree of faith</i>’—does not seem so suitable or forcible.<br><br><b> even as it is written</b>] He shews that<i> righteousness by faith is no new idea</i>, but found in the prophets. The words are cited again in Gal. iii. 11; Heb. x. 38: in the former place with the same purpose as here. They are used in Habakkuk with reference to credence given to the prophetic word: but properly speaking,<i> all faith is one</i>, in whatever word or act of God reposed: so that the Apostle is free from any charge of forcing the words to the present purpose. There are two ways of arranging them:<i> the righteous shall live by faith</i>, and<i> the righteous by faith</i>,<i> he who is righteous by faith, shall live</i>. But in fact they amount to the same: if the former, which is more agreeable to the Heb., be taken, shall live must mean, ‘shall live<i> on, endure in his</i> righteousness,<i> by means of faith</i>,’ which would assert that it was a righteousness of faith, as strongly as does the latter. Delitzsch says, “The Apostle rests no more on our text than it will bear, He only places its assertion, that the life of the just springs from his faith, in the light of the New Test.”
