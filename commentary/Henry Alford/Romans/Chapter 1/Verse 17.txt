<b> 17.</b>] An explanation,<i> how</i> the gospel is the<i> power</i><i> of God to salvation</i>, and how it is so<i> to the believer</i>:—because in it<b> God’s righteousness</b> (not His<i> attribute</i> of righteousness,— ‘the righteousness of God,’ but righteousness<i> flowing from</i>,<i> and acceptable to Him</i>) is unfolded, and the more, the more we believe. I subjoin De Wette’s note on the words. “The Greek and Hebrew words rendered ‘<i>righteousness</i>, are taken sometimes for ‘virtue” and ‘piety,’ which men possess or strive after,—sometimes imputatively, for ‘freedom from blame’ or ‘justification’ The latter meaning is most usual with Paul: ‘<i>righteousness</i>’ is that which is so in the sight of God (ch. ii. 13), the result of His justifying forensic Judgment, or of ‘<i>Imputation</i>’ (ch. iv. 5). It may certainly be imagined, that a man<i> might obtain</i> justification by<i> fulfilling the law</i>: in that case his righteousness is ‘<i>righteousness of his own</i>’ (ch. x. 3), a<i> righteousness springing from the law</i> (Phil. iii. 9). But it is impossible for him to obtain a ‘righteousness of his own,’ which at the same time shall avail before God (ch. iii. 20; Gal. ii. 16). The Jews not only<i> have</i> not fulfilled the law (ch. iii. 9–19), but<i> could not</i> fulfil it (vii. 7 ff.): the Gentiles likewise have rendered themselves obnoxious to the divine wrath (i. 24–32). God has ordained that the whole race should be included in disobedience. Now if man is to become righteous from being unrighteous,—this can only happen by God’s grace,—because God<i> declares him righteous</i>, assumes him to be righteous,<i> justifies</i> him (iii, 24; Gal. iii, 8):—to justify is not only negative, ‘<i>to acquit</i>,’ but also positive, ‘<i>to declare righteous</i>;’ but never “to make righteous’ by transformation, or imparting of moral strength by which moral perfection may be attained. Justification must be taken as the old protestant dogmatists rightly took it, in a<i> forensic</i> or<i> imputative</i> sense. God justifies for Christ’s sake (ch. iii. 22 ff.) on condition of faith in Him as Mediator: the result of<i> His justification is ‘righteousness by faith</i>, and as He imparts it freely, it is ‘<i>the righteousness of God</i>,’ or<i> from God</i> (so it ought to be), Phil. iii. 9. ‘<i>The righteousness of God</i>’ is ordinarily taken for<i> that which is righteousness with God in God’s sight</i>; compare
