<b> 18.</b>] He first states the general fact, of<i> all mankind</i>; but immediately passes off to the consideration of the<i> majority</i> of mankind, the Gentiles; reserving the Jews for exceptional consideration afterwards.<br><br><b> the wrath of God is</b><b> revealed</b>] The statement of ver. 17 was, that the RIGHTEOUSNESS<i> of</i> GOD is revealed. The necessary condition of this revelation is, the DESTRUCTION<i> of the righteousness of</i> MAN by the revelation of God’s anger against sin.<br><br><b> is revealed</b>, not<i> in the Gospel</i>: not<i> in men’s consciences: not in the miserable state of the then world</i>: but (as implied indeed by the adjunct<b> from heaven</b>,—that it is a<i> providential, universally-to-be-seen</i> revelation) in the PUNISHMENTS which, ver. 24, God, has made to follow upon sin, see also ch. ii. 2. So that revealed is said of an<i> objective reality her</i> e, not of an evangelic internal and subjective unfolding.<br><br><b> the wrath of God</b> is put, but with the deepest truth, for<i> the righteousness of God in punishment</i> (see ch. ii. 8; v. 9; Eph. ii. 3; Matt. iii, 7; John iii. 36). It is the opposite, in the divine attributes, of<i> Love</i>.<br><br><b> ungodliness</b>] (i. e. godlessness, living without God),—and<b> unrighteousness</b> (i. e. iniquity, injustice of thought and conduct). Neither term is exclusive of the other, nor to be formally pressed to its limits. They overlap and include each other by a large margin: the specific difference being, that ungodliness is more the<i> fountain</i> (but at the same time partially the result) of<i> unrighteousness</i>,—which<i> unrighteousness</i> is more the<i> result</i> (but at the same time partially the fountain) of<i> ungodliness</i>.<b> Unrighteousness</b> is the<i> state</i> of the thoughts and feelings and habits, induced originally by forgetfulness of God, and in its turn inducing impieties of all kinds. We may notice by the way, that the word<i> ungodliness</i> forms an interesting link to the Pastoral Epistles, where it, and its opposite,<i> godliness</i>, are the ordinary terms for an unholy and a holy life.<br><br><b> of men, who hold down (or hold back) the truth in unrighteousness</b>] who, possessing enough of the germs of religious and moral verity to preserve them from abandonment, have checked the development of this<i> truth</i> in their lives, in the love and practice of sin. That this is the meaning here is plain: see the discussion in my Greek Testament.<br><br> This meaning, ‘<i>keeping back</i>,’ ‘<i>hindering the development of</i>, admirably suits the sense, that men had (see vv. 19 ff.) knowledge of God sufficient, if its legitimate work had been allowed, to have kept them from such excesses of enormity as they have committed, but that this<i> truth</i> they<i> held down</i>, or<i> back</i>, in unrighteousness, i.e.<i> crushed, quenched</i>, in (as the element, conditional medium) their state and practice of unrighteousness. It is plain that to take in unrighteousness for<i> unrighteously</i>, is to miss the force of the expression altogether—the pregnant ‘<i>in and by</i>’ implying that it is their unrighteousness,—the very absence of<i> righteousness</i> for which the argument contends,—which is the<i> state wherein, and the instrument whereby</i> they hold back the truth lit up in their consciences.
