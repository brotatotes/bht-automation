<p><strong> 2.</strong> ] This <em> good tidings</em> is no new invention, no after-thought, but was <em> long ago announced</em> in what God’s prophets wrote concerning His Son: and announced by way of <em> promise</em> , so that God stood pledged to its realization. ἐπειδὴ δὲ καὶ καινοτομίαν ἐνεκάλουν τῷ πράγματι , δείκνυσιν αὐτὸ πρεσβύτερον Ἑλλήνων ὄν , καὶ ἐν τοῖς προφήταις προδιαγραφόμενον . Chrys. Hom. ii. p. 431.

<p><strong> γραφ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἁγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] not, ‘ <em> in sacred writings</em> ,’ nor ‘ <em> in passages of Holy Writ</em> :’ but <strong> in the Holy Scriptures</strong> . The expression used is defined enough by the adjective, to be well understood without the article; so πνεῦμα ἁγιως . below, πν . ἅγιον passim. See Winer, edn. 6, § 19. 2 (and for nouns in government, Middleton, ch. iii. § 6). <em> But one</em> set of writings being holy, it was not necessary to designate them more particularly. See also above on εὐαγγ . θεοῦ . This expression ( <strong> εὐαγγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ὃ προεπηγγ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ) is used in the strictest sense. Moses gave the <em> Law</em> : the prophets proclaimed the <em> Gospel</em> . See Umbreit’s note, p. 159.</p>
