<b> 20.</b>]<b> For</b> (justifying the clause preceding) his invisible attributes from the time of the creation, when the manifestation was made by God,<i> are perceived</i>.<br><br><b> being understood</b> (apprehended by the mind)<b> by means of His works</b> (of creation and sustenance,—not here of moral government). The rendering of the A.V., ‘<i>being understood by the things that are made</i>, is ambiguous, being capable of conveying the sense that the things which are made, understand them.<br><br><b> his eternal power</b>] To this the evidence of Creation is plainest of all: Eternal, and Almighty, have always been recognized epithets of the Creator.<br><br><b> and divinity</b>] not<i> Godhead</i>: the fact that the Creator is<i> divine</i>;—is of a<i> different nature</i> from ourselves, and accompanied by distinct attributes, and those of the highest order,—which we call<i> divine</i>.<br><br><b> so that they are without excuse</b>] The words may be also, and more literally, rendered,<b> that they may be without excuse</b>. But, however true it is, that in the doings of the Allwise,<i> all results are purposed</i>,—the sense ‘<i>in order that they might be inexcusable</i>,’ would be<br><br> manifestly contrary to the whole spirit of the argument, which is bringing out, not at present<i> God’s sovereignty in dealing with man, but man’s inexcusableness in holding back the truth by unrighteousness</i>. Chrysostom says, “God has not done this for this express purpose, even though it has so turned out. For He did not put this knowledge of Himself forth in order to deprive them of all excuse, but in order that they might know Him: they, by forgetting Him, deprived themselves of all excuse.”
