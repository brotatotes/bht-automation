<p><strong> 21. </strong> <strong> διότι</strong> ] expands ἀναπολογήτους ‘ <em> without excuse</em> , <strong> because …’
	</strong></p>
<p><strong> γνόντες</strong> ] ‘ <em> with the knowledge above stated</em> .’ This participle testifies plainly that matter of <em> fact</em> , and not of <em> possibility</em> , has been the subject of the foregoing verses. From this point, we take up what they MIGHT HAVE DONE, <em> but</em> DID NOT.

<p><strong> οὐχ ὡς θεὸν ἐδόξ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> They did not give Him glory</strong> ( δοξάζω here principally of recognition by worship) AS GOD, i.e. as the great Creator of all, distinct from and infinitely superior to all His works. Bengel well divides <strong> ἐδόξασαν</strong> and <strong> ηὐχαρίστησαν</strong> “ <em> Gratias agere</em> debemus ob beneficia: <em> glorificare</em> ob ipsas virtutes divinas.” They <em> did neither</em> : in their <em> religion</em> , they deposed God from His place as Creator, in their <em> lives</em> , they were ungrateful by the abuse of His gifts.

<p><strong> ἐματαιώθησαν</strong> ] הָבַל , <em> vanus fuit</em> , is used of worshipping idols, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:15">2 Kings 17:15</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:5">Jeremiah 2:5</span> , and הֶבֶל , <em> vanitas</em> , of an idol. Deu 32:21 ; 1Ki 16:26 al.: and hence probably the word ματαιόω was here chosen.

<p><strong> διαλογισμοῖς</strong> ] <strong> their thoughts</strong> : but generally in N.T. in a <em> bad</em> sense: <strong> they became vain</strong> (idle, foolish) <strong> in their speculations.
	</strong></p>
<p><strong> ἐσκοτίσθη ἡ ἀσύν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> αὐτ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> καρδ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] ἀσύνετος is not the <em> result of</em> ἐσκοτ ., ‘ <em> became darkened so as to lose its understanding</em> ,’ but the converse, <strong> their heart</strong> ( καρδία of the whole inner man, the seat of knowledge and feeling) <strong> being foolish</strong> (unintelligent, not retaining God in its knowledge) <strong> became dark</strong> (lost the little light it had, and wandered blindly in the mazes of folly).</p>
