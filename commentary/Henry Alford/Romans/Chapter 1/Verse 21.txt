	 οὐχ ὡς θεὸν ἐδόξ  . ]  They did not give Him glory ( δοξάζω here principally of recognition by worship) AS GOD, i.e. as the great Creator of all, distinct from and infinitely superior to all His works. Bengel well divides  ἐδόξασαν and  ηὐχαρίστησαν “  Gratias agere debemus ob beneficia:  glorificare ob ipsas virtutes divinas.” They  did neither : in their  religion , they deposed God from His place as Creator, in their  lives , they were ungrateful by the abuse of His gifts.
	 ἐματαιώθησαν ] הָבַל ,  vanus fuit , is used of worshipping idols, 2 Kings 17:15 ; Jeremiah 2:5 , and הֶבֶל ,  vanitas , of an idol. Deu 32:21 ; 1Ki 16:26 al.: and hence probably the word ματαιόω was here chosen.
	 διαλογισμοῖς ]  their thoughts : but generally in N.T. in a  bad sense:  they became vain (idle, foolish)  in their speculations.
	 ἐσκοτίσθη ἡ ἀσύν  .   αὐτ  .   καρδ  . ] ἀσύνετος is not the  result of ἐσκοτ ., ‘  became darkened so as to lose its understanding ,’ but the converse,  their heart ( καρδία of the whole inner man, the seat of knowledge and feeling)  being foolish (unintelligent, not retaining God in its knowledge)  became dark (lost the little light it had, and wandered blindly in the mazes of folly).
