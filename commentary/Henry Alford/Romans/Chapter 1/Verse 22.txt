 22.   φάσκοντες εἶν  .   σοφ  . ] Not, ‘  because they professed themselves wise ,’ but  while they professed themselves wise professing themselves to be wise . The words relate perhaps not so much to the schools of philosophy, as to the assumption of wisdom by the Greeks in general, see 1 Corinthians 1:22 , of which assumption their philosophers were indeed eminent, but not the only examples.
