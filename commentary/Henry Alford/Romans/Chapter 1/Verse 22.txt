<p><strong> 22. </strong> <strong> φάσκοντες εἶν</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> σοφ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] Not, ‘ <em> because they professed themselves wise</em> ,’ but <strong> while they professed themselves wise professing themselves to be wise</strong> . The words relate perhaps not so much to the schools of philosophy, as to the assumption of wisdom by the Greeks in general, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:22">1 Corinthians 1:22</span> , of which assumption their philosophers were indeed eminent, but not the only examples.</p>
