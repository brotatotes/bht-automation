<p><strong> 23.</strong> <strong> ἤλλαξαν</strong> κ . τ . λ .] quoted from ref. Ps., only τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν , ‘ <em> their</em> glory,’ of the Psalm, is changed to ‘ <em> God’s</em> glory,’ viz. His Power and Majesty visible in the Creation. <strong> ἐν</strong> represents the conditional element in which the change subsisted.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀφθάρτου</strong> and <strong> φθαρτοῦ</strong> shew by contrast the folly of such a substitution: He who made and upholds all things must be <em> incorruptible</em> , and <em> no corruptible thing can express His likeness</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁμοιώματι εἰκόνος</strong> ] <strong> the similitude of the form</strong> εἰκόνος generalizes it to mean <em> the human form</em> , it not being any one particular man, but the <em> form of man</em> (examples being abundant) to which they degraded God, and so of the other creatures. Deities of the <em> human</em> form prevailed in Greece those of the <em> bestial</em> in Egypt. Both methods of worship were practised in Rome.</p>
