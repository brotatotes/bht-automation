 23.  ἤλλαξαν κ . τ . λ .] quoted from ref. Ps., only τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν , ‘  their glory,’ of the Psalm, is changed to ‘  God’s glory,’ viz. His Power and Majesty visible in the Creation.  ἐν represents the conditional element in which the change subsisted.
	 ἀφθάρτου and  φθαρτοῦ shew by contrast the folly of such a substitution: He who made and upholds all things must be  incorruptible , and  no corruptible thing can express His likeness .
	 ὁμοιώματι εἰκόνος ]  the similitude of the form εἰκόνος generalizes it to mean  the human form , it not being any one particular man, but the  form of man (examples being abundant) to which they degraded God, and so of the other creatures. Deities of the  human form prevailed in Greece those of the  bestial in Egypt. Both methods of worship were practised in Rome.
