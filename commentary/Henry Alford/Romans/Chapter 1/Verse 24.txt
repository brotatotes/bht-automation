<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] The <strong> καί</strong> after διό may import, <em> As they advanced in departure from God, so God also on His part gave them up</em> , &amp;c. <em> His</em> dealings with <em> them</em> had a progression likewise.
	</p>
<p><strong> παρέδωκεν</strong> ] not merely permissive, but judicial: <strong> God delivered them over. As</strong> sin begets sin, and darkness of mind deeper darkness, grace gives place to judgment, and the divine wrath hardens men, and hurries them on to more fearful degrees of depravity.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν ταῖς ἐπιθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> in the lusts</strong> not <em> by</em> nor <em> through</em> the lusts (as Erasmus and E. V.); the lusts of the heart were the <em> field of action</em> , the department of their being, <em> in which</em> this dishonour took place.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἀκαθαρσίαν</strong> ] more than mere profligacy in the satisfaction of natural lust (as Olsh.); for the Apostle uses cognate words ἀτιμάζεσθαι and ἀτιμία here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:26">Romans 1:26</span> : <strong> bestiality</strong> ; impurity in the <em> physical</em> , not only in the social and religious sense.
	</p>
<p><strong> τοῦ ἀτιμάζεσθαι</strong> ] the genitive may imply either (1) the <em> purpose</em> of God’s delivering them over to impurity, ‘ <em> that their bodies should be dishonoured</em> ,’ or (2) the result of that delivering over, ‘ <em> so that their bodies were dishonoured</em> ,’ or (3) the nature of the ἀκαθαρσία , as πάθη ἀτιμίας below, ‘ <em> impurity, which consisted in their bodies being dishonoured</em> .’ The second of these seems most accordant with the usage of the Apostle and with the argument.
	</p>
<p>ἀτιμάζεσθαι is most likely <em> passive</em> (Beza, al. De Wette), as the middle of ἀτιμάζω is not found in use. And this is confirmed by the old and probably genuine reading αὐτοῖς , which has been altered to ἑαυτοῖς from imagining that ‘ <em> they</em> ’ was the subject to ἀτιμάζεσθαι . <strong> So that their bodies were dishonoured among them.</strong></p>
