 24. ] The  καί after διό may import,  As they advanced in departure from God, so God also on His part gave them up , &c.  His dealings with  them had a progression likewise.
	 παρέδωκεν ] not merely permissive, but judicial:  God delivered them over. As sin begets sin, and darkness of mind deeper darkness, grace gives place to judgment, and the divine wrath hardens men, and hurries them on to more fearful degrees of depravity.
	 ἐν ταῖς ἐπιθ  . ]  in the lusts not  by nor  through the lusts (as Erasmus and E. V.); the lusts of the heart were the  field of action , the department of their being,  in which this dishonour took place.
	 ἀκαθαρσίαν ] more than mere profligacy in the satisfaction of natural lust (as Olsh.); for the Apostle uses cognate words ἀτιμάζεσθαι and ἀτιμία here and in Romans 1:26 :  bestiality ; impurity in the  physical , not only in the social and religious sense.
	 τοῦ ἀτιμάζεσθαι ] the genitive may imply either (1) the  purpose of God’s delivering them over to impurity, ‘  that their bodies should be dishonoured ,’ or (2) the result of that delivering over, ‘  so that their bodies were dishonoured ,’ or (3) the nature of the ἀκαθαρσία , as πάθη ἀτιμίας below, ‘  impurity, which consisted in their bodies being dishonoured .’ The second of these seems most accordant with the usage of the Apostle and with the argument.
	ἀτιμάζεσθαι is most likely  passive (Beza, al. De Wette), as the middle of ἀτιμάζω is not found in use. And this is confirmed by the old and probably genuine reading αὐτοῖς , which has been altered to ἑαυτοῖς from imagining that ‘  they ’ was the subject to ἀτιμάζεσθαι .  So that their bodies were dishonoured among them.
