 25. ] This verse casts light on the τὴν ἀλήθ . ἐν ἀδικίᾳ κατεχόντων of Romans 1:18 . The  truth of God (the true notion of Him as the Creator) which they professed, they changed into (see on ἐν , Rom 1:23 )  a lie ( ψεῦδος = שֶׁקֶר , used of idols, Jer 16:19 ), thus counteracting its legitimate agency and depriving it of all power for good.
	 σεβάζομαι , of the honour of  respect and  observance and  reverence ,  λατρεύω , of  formal worship with sacrifice and offering . Both verbs belong to τῇ κτίσει ; though σεβάζομαι would require an accusative, λατρεύω , the nearest, takes the government.
	 τῇ κτ  . ] the  thing made , the  creature a general term for all objects of idolatrous worship.
	 παρά  , beyond which would amount to the exclusion of the Creator.
	The doxology expresses the horror of the Apostle at this dishonour, and puts their sin in a more striking light. But we need not supply εἰ καὶ οὗτοι ὕβρισαν , as Chrys.
	 εὐλογητός is  Blessed , κατ ʼ ἐξοχήν : the LXX put for it the perf. part., Ps. 117:24. The adjective is usually of  God : the participle, of man.
