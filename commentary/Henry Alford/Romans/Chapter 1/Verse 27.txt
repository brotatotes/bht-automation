<b> 27.</b>]<b> in themselves, their own persons</b>, viz. by their degradation even below the beasts.<br><br><b> the recompence</b>] The Apostle treats this degradation into which they fell, as a<i> consequence of, a retribution for</i>, their departure from God into idolatry,â€”with which<i> in fact</i> it was closely connected.<i> This shame</i>, and not its<i> consequences</i>, which are not<i> here</i> treated of, is the recompence of their error, their aberration from the knowledge of God, which they received. This is further shewn by the verb<b> which was meet</b>, in the past tense. If there had been no hell, nor any punishment threatened, this alone was worse than any punishment. And if<i> even in this</i> they found pleasure, why this very pleasure was an accession of punishment.
