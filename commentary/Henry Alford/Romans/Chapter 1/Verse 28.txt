<p><strong> 28.</strong> ] The play on δοκιμάζω and ἀδόκιμος can hardly be expressed in any other language. ‘Non probaverunt’ and ‘reprobum’ of the Vulgate does not give it. <strong> Because they reprobated the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a reprobate mind</strong> , is indeed a very inadequate, but as far as the <em> form</em> of the two words is concerned, an <em> accurate</em> representation of it. (Mr. Conybeare gives it, “As they thought fit to cast out the acknowledgment of God, God gave them over, to an outcast mind.”) For ἀδόκιμος is not ‘judicii expers’ (as Beza, Tholuck, &amp;c.), but <strong> reprobate</strong> , <em> rejected by God</em> . God withdrew from them His preventing grace and left them to the evil which they had chosen. The <em> active</em> sense of ἀδόκιμος , besides being altogether unexampled, would, in the depth of its meaning, be inconsistent with the assertion of the passage. God did <em> not</em> give them up to a mind which had <em> lost the faculty of discerning</em> , but to a mind judicially abandoned to that depravity which, being well able to exercise the δοκιμασία required, not only does not do so, but in the headlong current of its abandonment to evil, sympathizes with and encourages ( Rom 1:32 ) its practice in others. It is the ‘ <em> video</em> meliora <em> proboque</em> ,’ which makes the ‘deteriora sequor’ so peculiarly criminal.

<p><strong> οὐκ</strong> ἐδοκίμασαν ἔχειν is not = ἐδοκίμ . οὐκ ἔχειν (as Dr. Burton): the latter would express more a <em> deliberate act of the judgment</em> ending in rejection of God, whereas the text charges them with <em> not having exercised</em> that judgment which would, if exercised, have led to the retention of God in their knowledge.
