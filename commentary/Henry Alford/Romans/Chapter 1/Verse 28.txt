<b> 28.</b>] There is, in the original, a play on words in this place, which can hardly be expressed in any other language.<b> Because they reprobated the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a reprobate mind</b>, is indeed a very inadequate, but as far as the<i> form</i> of the two words is concerned, an<i> accurate</i> representation of it. Mr. Conybeare gives it— ‘ ‘As they thought fit to cast out the acknowledgment of God, God gave them over to an outcast mind.”<br><br><b> reprobate</b> means<i> rejected by God</i>. God withdrew from them His preventing grace, and left them to the evil which they had chosen. God did<i> not</i> give them up to a mind which had, but to a mind judicially abandoned to that depravity which, being well able to exercise the faculty of discernment required, not only does not do so, but in the headlong current of its abandonment to evil, sympathizes with and encourages (ver. 32) its practice in others. It is the seeing and approving better things, which makes the<i> following worse things</i> so peculiarly criminal.<br><br><b> they did not choose to retain</b>] equivalent to<i> they chose not to retain</i>: the latter would express more a<i> deliberate act of the judgment</i> ending in rejection of God, whereas the text charges them with<i> not having exercised</i> that judgment which would, if exercised, have led to the retention of God in their knowledge.<br><br><b> to retain God in their knowledge</b>] So Job xxi. 14,—” they say to God, Depart from us: for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways,” and xxii. 15–17.<b> 29–31.</b>] The word “<i>fornication</i>,” found in some authorities here, and in others elsewhere in the list, is omitted in our earliest and best MSS. The Apostle can hardly have written it here, treating as he does all these immoralities of the heart and conscience as<i> results</i> of, and<i> flowing from</i>, the licentious practices of idolatry above specified.—Accurate distinctions of ethical meaning can hardly be found for all these words. Without requiring such, or insisting on each excluding the rest, I have collected the most interesting notices respecting them.<br><br><b> unrighteousness</b>] Perhaps a general term, comprehending all that follow: such would be according to the usage of the Epistle: bunt perhaps to be confined to the stricter import of<b> injustice</b>: of which on the part of the Romans, history gives abundant testimonies.<br><br><b> wickedness</b>] This term is interpreted to mean<i> the disposition to work evil</i>: and is used therefore more of the<i> tempter</i> and seducer to evil.<br><br><b> covetousness</b> (not as 1 Thess. iv. 6, see there), of which the whole provincial government and civil life of the Romans at the time was full. “When was the lap of avarice more widely spread?” exclaims Juvenal, soon after this.<br><br><b> maliciousness</b>] The word thus rendered really means more the<i> passive side</i><i> of evil</i>—the capability of and proclivity to evil,—the opposite to<i> virtue</i>.<br><br><b> whisperer</b> s]<b> i.e. secret maligners</b>; “backbiters” indicates<i> open slanderers</i>. The word rendered “<i>haters of God</i>,” is never found in this active sense, but always in a passive,<b> hated by God</b>; and such is apparently the sense here. The order of crimes enumerated would be broken, and one of a totally different kind inserted between<i> slanderers</i> and<i> insolent</i>, if this word is to signify ‘<i>haters of God</i>.” But on the other supposition,—if any crime was known more than another as ‘<i>hated by the gods</i>,’ it was that of informers, abandoned persons who circumvented and ruined others by a system of malignant espionage and false information. And the crime was one which the readers of this part of Roman history know to have been the pest of the state; Tacitus, for example, calls the informers, “persons favoured by the Prince, but hateful to God.” It does not follow that the informers<i> only</i> are intended, but the expression may be used to include all those abandoned persons who were known as<i> hated by the gods</i>, who were employed in pursuits hateful and injurious to their kind.<br><br><b> insolent</b>] The word so rendered is opposed by the Greek writers to that indicating ‘a discreet and modest man: but here perhaps, and also as said by St. Paul of himself, 1 Tim. i. 13, it designates one who is<i> insolent</i>, ‘an insulting person.’<br><br><b> proud</b>] The word so rendered is said to point out one who despises others in comparison with himself. Aristotle mentions insolence and pride as examples of qualities consequent on wealth.<br><br><b> boasters</b>] “One who is rash, and claims a high character for bravery,” says Aristotle of the meaning of this word; and in another place, “the<i> boaster</i> seems to be one who appropriates credit to himself, when it does not belong to him, and greater than belongs to him. All exaggeration, and excessive depreciation, belong to the character of the boaster.”<br><br><b> without</b> (moral)<b> understanding</b>] See Col. i. 9.<br><br><b> without natural affection</b>] Petronius says of Rome, “In this city no one brings up children, because<b> a</b> man who has heirs of his own is not invited as a guest at feasts or at spectacles.”
