<b> 3. concerning his Son</b>] belongs to “<i>which he had promised afore</i>,” above,—<b>which he promised beforehand</b>, &c.,<b> concerning His Son</b>, i.e. ‘which (good tidings) He promised beforehand, &c.,<i> and indicated that it should be concerning His Son</i>.’ This is more natural than (as is done in the A.V.) to bind these words to “<i>the Gospel of God</i>,” which went before. Either meaning will suit ver. 9 equally well.—Christ, the Son of God, is the<i> great subject</i> of the good news.<br><br><b> which was born</b>] or,<b> became</b>: not, as in A.V., “<i>was made</i>.” There is nothing in the word indicating<i> creation</i>, however true that may have been: see John i. 14.<br><br><b> according to the flesh</b>] On the side of His humanity, our Lord became, was born;<i> that</i> nature of His begins only then, when He was “<i>made (born) of a woman</i>,” Gal. iv. 4.<br><br><b> flesh</b> is here used exactly as in John i. 14, “<i>the word became flesh</i>,” to signify<i> that whole nature, body, and soul</i>, of which the outward visible tabernacle of the FLESH is the concrete representation to our senses.—The words<b> of the seed of David</b> cast a hint back at the promise just spoken of. At the same time, in so solemn an enunciation of the dignity of the Son of God, they serve to shew that even according to the human side, His descent had been fixed in the line of him who was Israel’s anointed and greatest king.<b></b>
