<b> 3. concerning his Son</b>] belongs to “<i>which he had promised afore</i>,” above,—<b>which he promised beforehand</b>, &c.,<b> concerning His Son</b>, i.e. ‘which (good tidings) He promised beforehand, &c.,<i> and indicated that it should be concerning His Son</i>.’ This is more natural than (as is done in the A.V.) to bind these words to “<i>the Gospel of God</i>,” which went before. Either meaning will suit ver. 9 equally well.—Christ, the Son of God, is the<i> great subject</i> of the good news.
