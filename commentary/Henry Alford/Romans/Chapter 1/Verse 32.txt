<b> 32.</b>] The Apostle advances to the h<i> ighest grade of moral abandonment</i>,—the knowledge of God’s sentence against such crimes, united with the contented practice of them, and encouragement of them in others.<br><br><b> the righteous judgment of God</b>]<b> the sentence of God</b>, unmistakeably pronounced in the conscience;<b> viz. that they who do such things are worthy of death:</b> this is the sentence, and must not be enclosed in a parenthesis.<br><br><b> worthy of death</b>:<i> of what sort of death</i>? Probably “<i>death</i>” is a general term for the<i> fatal</i> consequence of sin: that such courses<i> lead to ruin</i>. The word can hardly be pressed to its exact meaning: for many of the crimes mentioned could never be visited with judicial capital punishment in this world: nor could the heathen have any definite idea of eternal spiritual death, as the penalty attached to sin; nor again, any idea of the<i> connexion</i> between sin and natural death. “Life and Death,” remarks Umbreit, “are ever set over against one another in the Old as well as in the New Testament, the one as including all good that can befall us, the other, all evil.” The description here given by the Apostle of the moral state of the heathen world should by all means be compared with that in Thucydides, at the end of his third book, of the moral state of Greece at the end of the fourth year of the Peloponnesian war. ‘The English reader will find it in Hobbes’s Translation; and a summary of it in Grote’s History of Greece, vol. vi. ch. 50, pp. 375–384. The English historian gives only the political side of the description. There is also a remarkable passage in the Apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon, ch. xiv. 22–31, the opening of which is strikingly similar to our text.
