<b> 4.</b>] The simple antithesis would have been,<i> which was born... according to the flesh, but was the Son of God according to the Spirit</i>, see 1 Tim. iii. 16. But (1) wonderful solemnity is given by dropping the particles, and taking up separately the human and divine nature of Christ, keeping<b> His Son</b> as the great subject of both clauses, and thus making them, not contrasts to one another, but correlative parts of the same great whole. And (2) the Apostle, dwelling here on<i> patent facts</i>,—the announcements of prophecy,—the history of the Lord’s Humanity, does not deal with the<i> essential subsistent Godhead of Christ</i>, but with<i> that manifestation of it</i> which the great fact of the Resurrection had made to men. Also (3) by amplifying the<i> Spirit</i> into<b> the Spirit of holiness</b>, he characterizes the Spirit of Christ as one of absolute holiness, i.e. as<i> divine</i>, and<i> partaking</i> of the God-<i>head</i>: see below.
