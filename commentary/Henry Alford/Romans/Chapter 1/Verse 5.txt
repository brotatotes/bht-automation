<b> 5. through whom</b>] As in Gal. i. 1; 1 Cor. i. 9, designating the Lord Himself as the Agent in conferring the grace and Apostleship.<br><br><b> we received</b>] not ‘<i>all Christians</i>,—but<i> we</i>, the Apostle himself as he not unfrequently speaks. No others need be here included in the word.<i> Those to whom he is writing</i> cannot be thus included, for they are specially contrasted with the subject of the verb<b> received</b> by the following verse. Nor can this verb<b> received</b> (not, as A.V., “<i>have received</i>”) refer to any<i> general</i> bestowal of this kind, indicating, as it must, a definite past event, viz. the reception of the Apostleship by himself.<br><br><b> grace</b>] It is hardly to be understood, as Augustine explains, that “the Apostle has grace in common with all the faithful, but<i> Apostleship</i> not in common with all:” for he is surely speaking of that<i> peculiar grace</i>, by which he wrought in his apostleship more than they all.<br><br><b> apostleship</b>] ‘the office of an Apostle:’ not any<i> mission</i>, or<i> power of sending ministers</i>, resident in the<i> whole church</i>, which would be contrary to the usage of the word. The<i> existence</i> of such a power is not hereby denied, but<i> this place</i> refers<i> solely to the office of Paul</i> as an Apostle. It was the general bestowal of<i> grace</i>, which was the condition of and introduced the special bestowal (<b>and</b>, as so often, coupling a specific portion to a whole) of<i> apostleship</i>: compare 1 Cor. xv. 10.<br><br><b> unto</b>] i.e.<b> with a view to</b>,— ‘in order to bring about.’<br><br><b> obedience of faith</b>] Such is the literal rendering of the words; and this ought to be kept in the translation. They may mean either,<i> obedience which is the result of faith, or, obedience, the object of which is the faith; obedience,</i> in fact<i>, to the faith</i>, as in Acts vi. 7, “<i>a great multitude of the priests were obedient unto the faith</i>.” Understood either way, these words form an introduction to the great subject of the Epistle.<br><br><b> in order to bring about obedience of faith among all (the) nations (or, all the Gentiles</b>: the word rendered Gentiles being always the same as that meaning<i> nations</i>). The Jews do not here come into account. There is no inclusion, and at the same time no express exclusion of them: but Paul was commissioned as<i> the Apostle of the Gentiles</i>, and he here magnifies the great office entrusted to him.<br><br><b> for his name’s sake</b>] i.e.<b> on behalf of his name</b>; ‘for His glory” “In the<i> name of Christ</i> is summed up what He had done and was, what the Christian ever bore in mind, the zeal which marked him, the name wherewith he was named.” Jowett. The words are best taken as belonging to the whole verse: as declaring the purpose for which the grace and apostleship had been received.
