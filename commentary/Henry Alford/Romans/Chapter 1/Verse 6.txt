<p><strong> 6. </strong> <strong> ἐν οἷς</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] The whole to χριστοῦ should be taken together: <strong> among whom ye also are called of Jesus Christ</strong> ; otherwise, with a comma at ὑμεῖς , the assertion, ‘ <em> among whom are ye</em> ,’ is flat and unmeaning.

<p>De Wette and Calvin would take Ἰησοῦ χρ . as a gen. of <em> possession</em> , because the call of believers is generally referred to the FATHER: but sometimes the SON is said to call likewise, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span> : and with ἀγαπητοὶ θεοῦ following so close upon it, the expression can I think hardly be taken otherwise than as <strong> called by Jesus Christ</strong> . ἐκλεκτοὶ αὐτοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span> , cited by De W. is hardly parallel.</p>
