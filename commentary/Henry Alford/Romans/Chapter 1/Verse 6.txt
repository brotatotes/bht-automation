<b> 6. among whom</b>] The whole should be taken together:<b> among whom ye also are called of Jesus Christ;</b> otherwise, with a comma at<b> also</b>, the assertion, ‘<i>among whom are ye also</i>,’ is flat and unmeaning. Some would take<b> of Jesus Christ</b> as a genitive of<i> possession</i>, because the call of believers is generally referred to the FATHER; but sometimes the SON is said to call likewise, see John v. 25; 1 Tim. i. 12;—and with<b> beloved of God</b> following so close upon it, the expression can I think hardly be taken otherwise than as<b> called by Jesus Christ</b>.
