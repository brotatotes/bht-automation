 6.   ἐν οἷς  .… ] The whole to χριστοῦ should be taken together:  among whom ye also are called of Jesus Christ ; otherwise, with a comma at ὑμεῖς , the assertion, ‘  among whom are ye ,’ is flat and unmeaning.
	De Wette and Calvin would take Ἰησοῦ χρ . as a gen. of  possession , because the call of believers is generally referred to the FATHER: but sometimes the SON is said to call likewise, see John 5:25 ; 1 Timothy 1:12 : and with ἀγαπητοὶ θεοῦ following so close upon it, the expression can I think hardly be taken otherwise than as  called by Jesus Christ . ἐκλεκτοὶ αὐτοῦ , Matthew 24:31 , cited by De W. is hardly parallel.
