<b> 8.</b>] This placing himself in intimate connexion with his readers by mention of and thankfulness for their faith or Christian graces, is the constant habit of St. Paul. The three Epistles, Gal., 1 Tim., and Titus, are the only exceptions: 2 Cor. may seem to be such, but in ch. i. 3–22 we have an equivalent: see especially, vv. 6, 7. 11, 14. It is literally, First indeed... and the sentence answering to this is found at ver. 13, ‘Ye indeed are prospering in the faith: but<b> I</b> still am anxious<i> further</i> to advance that fruitfulness.’<br><br><b> my God</b>] “See with what skill in the arrangement of terms he gives thanks. For he does not say, ‘<i>to God</i>,’ but<b> to my God</b>: which also the prophets do, appropriating to themselves that which is common to all. And what wonder, if they do? For we see God continually Himself doing the same in speaking of His servants, calling Himself, with a like appropriation, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.” Chrysostom.<br><br><b> through Jesus Christ</b>] “He offers his sacrifice of thanksgiving as through the Great High Priest: for he who would offer a sacrifice must know that it must be offered through the hands of the High Priest.” Origen. So also Calvin, “We have here an example, how thanks are to be offered through Christ, according to the apostolic precept, Heb. xiii. 15.” Olshausen says, “This is no mere phrase, but a true expression of the deepest conviction. For only by the Spirit of Christ dwelling in men’s hearts are thanksgivings and prayer acceptable to God.” But perhaps here it is better to take the words as expressing an acknowledgment that the faith of the Romans, for which thanks were given,<i> was due to and rested on</i> the Lord Jesus Christ: see ch. vii. 25, and the rendering there.<br><br><b> your faith</b>] “In congratulations of this kind Panl sometimes describes the whole Christian character, Col. i. 3 ff., or some portion of it, 1 Cor. i. 5. And thus here he celebrates their faith, agreeably to his design, verses 12, 17.” Bengel.<br><br><b> published</b>] De Wette notices the other side of the report, as given by the Jews at Rome, Acts xxviii. 22, to Paul himself. This<i> praise</i> was in the<i> Christian churches</i>, and brought by<i> Christian brethren</i>.<br><br><b> throughout the whole world</b>] A popular hyperbole, common every where, and especially when speaking of general diffusion through the Roman empire, the ‘orbis terrarum.’ The praise would be heard in every city where there was a Christian church,—intercouse with the metropolis of the world being common to all.
