<b> 9.</b>] “A pious asseveration, concerning a thing necessary to be stated, and unknown. to men, especially to those who were unknown to the writer, and remote from him.” Bengel. There could be no other witness to his practice in his secret prayers, but God: and as the assertion of a habit. of incessantly praying for the Roman Christians, whom he had never seen, might seem to savour of an exaggerated expression of affection, he solemnly appeals to this only possible testimony. To the Eph., Phil. (see however Phil. i. 8), Col., Thess., he gives the same assurance, but without the asseveration. The thus calling God to witness is no uncommon practice with St. Paul: see references.
