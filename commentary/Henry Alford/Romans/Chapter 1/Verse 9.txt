<b> 9.</b>] “A pious asseveration, concerning a thing necessary to be stated, and unknown. to men, especially to those who were unknown to the writer, and remote from him.” Bengel. There could be no other witness to his practice in his secret prayers, but God: and as the assertion of a habit. of incessantly praying for the Roman Christians, whom he had never seen, might seem to savour of an exaggerated expression of affection, he solemnly appeals to this only possible testimony. To the Eph., Phil. (see however Phil. i. 8), Col., Thess., he gives the same assurance, but without the asseveration. The thus calling God to witness is no uncommon practice with St. Paul: see references.<br><br><b> whom I serve in my spirit</b>] The<i> serving God in his spirit</i> was a guarantee that his pro-fession was sincere, and that the oath just taken was no mere form, but a solemn and earnest appeal of his spirit. See also Phil. iii, 3, and John iv. 24. “The Apostle means that he is an intelligent true priest. of his God, not in the temple, but in his spirit,—not at the altar, but in the gospel of His Son.” Umbreit.<br><br><b> in the gospel</b>] “The addition of these words shews the<i> kind</i> of his service.” Chrysostom. His peculiar method of service was concerned with the gospel of the Son of God. “Some take this addition, as if Paul wished to commend his service of God on account of its agreement with the commands of the Gospel, seeing that a service of God in the spirit is prescribed to us in the Gospel. But the other interpretation is far more agreeable to the sense, viz. that he renders his service to God in the preaching of the Gospel.” Calvin. See the use of the word “<i>Gospel</i>,” Phil. iv. 15.<br><br><b> how unceasingly</b>] The words thus rendered may also mean, “that<b> without ceasing.</b>” The rendering in the text seems the better of the two. The whole phrase is a favourite one with our Apostle: see references.<br><br><b> my prayers</b> must be understood of his<i> ordinary stated prayers</i>, just in our sense of the expression: “as often as he professedly and statedly prayed to God, he remembered them among others.” Calvin.
