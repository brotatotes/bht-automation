 1. ]  Brethren (‘nunc quasi superata præcedentis tractationis severitate comiter appellat  fratres .’ Bengel),  the inclination of my heart ( εὐδοκία is seldom, if ever, used to signify the  motion of desire , but imports the  rest of approving satisfaction . Possibly there is here a mixture of constructions: the Apostle’s εὐδοκία would be their  salvation itself , his δέησις πρὸς τὸν θ . ὑπὲρ αὐτ . was  εἰς σωτ .
	The μέν requires a corresponding  δέ , not expressed, but implied in the course of Romans 10:2-3 , where the obstacle to their σωτήρ . is brought out),  and my supplication to God on their behalf (Israel, see ch. Romans 9:32 , προσέκοψαν ), (  is) for (their) salvation (lit. ‘towards salvation.’
	The insertion of the art. after δέησις has apparently been an overcareful grammatical correction: it is by no means universal in the N. T., even where the Greek writers insert it, and here, seeing that there could be no δεήσεις to any other than God, the omission would be more natural. τοῦ Ἰσραήλ has been substituted by the adoption of a gloss: ἐστίν to complete the sense). The Apostle’s meaning seems to be, to destroy any impression which his readers may have received unfavourable to his love of his own people, from the stern argument of the former chapter.
