So Orig [95] , Chrys., Œc [96] , Calov., Wolf, Bengel, Rück., Meyer, Fritz., De Wette, Tholuck, al. So πάντων κύριος of Christ, Acts 10:36 . Most modern Commentators make ὁ αὐτός the subject, and κύριος the predicate. But I prefer the usual rendering, both on account of the strangeness of ὁ αὐτός thus standing alone, and because this Apostle uses the expression ὁ αὐτὸς κύριος , 1 Corinthians 12:5 , and even ὁ αὐτὸς θεός , ib. 6, for ‘the same Lord,’ and ‘it is the same God.’ Stuart supplies, ‘(there is) the same Lord:’ but this is harsh, and unnecessary, if the participle πλουτῶν be taken as συντελῶν κ . συντ . in ch. Rom 9:28 )  is rich towards all (‘by  εἰς is signified the direction in which the stream of grace rushes forth.’ Olsh.)  who call upon Him.
