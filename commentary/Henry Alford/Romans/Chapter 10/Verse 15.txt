But how can men preach unless they shall have been sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them who bring glad tidings of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things</b>!—The Apostle is shewing the<i> necessity</i> and<i> dignity</i> of the preachers of the word, which leads on to the<i> universality</i> of their preaching, leaving all who disobey it without excuse. He therefore cites this, as shewing that their instrumentality was one recognized in the prophetic word, where their office is described and glorified.—The applicability of these words to the preachers of the Gospel is evident from the passage in Isaiah itself, which is spoken indeed of the return from captivity, but in that return has regard to amore glorious one under the future Redeemer. We need not therefore say that the Apostle uses Seripture words merely as expressing his own thoughts in a well-known garb; he alleges the words as a prophetic description of the preachers of whom he is writing.
