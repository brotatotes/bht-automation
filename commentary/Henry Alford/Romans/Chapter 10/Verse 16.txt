The persons here meant are as yet kept indefinite,—but evidently the Apostle has in his mind the unbelieving Jews, about whom his main discourse is employed.–<b>Howbeit not all hearkened to</b> (historic: during the preaching)<b> the glad tidings</b> (and this too was no unlooked–for thing, but predetermined in the divine counsel):<b> for Isaiah saith, Lord</b> (the word Lord is not in the Hebrew),<b> who</b> [<b>hath</b>]<b> believed the hearing of us</b> (i. e. as in our version,<i> our report</i>: but it is important in this passage to keep the word one and the same throughout, as it is in the original; otherwise we lose the force of the Apostle’s argument)?<br><br><b> 17.</b>)<b> Faith then</b> (conclusion from ver. 16, “<i>who believed our report?</i>”)<b> is from hearing</b> (i. e. the<i> publication</i> of the Gospel produces belief in it),<b> and the hearing</b> (the effect of the publication of the Gospel)<b> is through</b> (not, ‘in obedience to,’ but ‘by means of,’ as its instrument and vehicle)<b> the word of Christ</b> (such is the reading of our oldest authorities.<i> ‘God’</i> has probably been a rationalizing correction, to suit better the sense of the prophecy).
