<b> 18.</b>]<b> But</b> (in anticipation of an objection that Israel, whom he has especially in view,<i> had not sufficiently heard</i> the good tidings),<b> I say, Did they not hear</b> (the “<i>hear</i>” of ver. 14 is carried on through verses 16 and 17 to this in ver. 18)?<b> Nay, verily</b> (ch. ix. 20, note),<b> Into all the earth went forth their voice, and to the ends of the world their words</b>.—Psal. xix. is<i> a comparison of the sun, and glory of the heavens, with the word of God.</i> As far as ver. 6 the glories of nature are described: then the great subject is taken up, and the parallelism carried out to the end. So that the Apostle has not, as alleged in nearly all the Commentators, merely accommodated the text allegorically, but<i> taken it in its context</i>, and followed up the comparison of the Psalm.—As to the assertion of the preaching of the Gospel having gone out into all the world, when as yet a small part of it only had been evangelized,—we must remember that it is not the<i> extent</i>, so much as the<i> universality</i><i> in character</i>, of this preaching, which the Apostle is here asserting: that word of God, hitherto confined within the limits of Judæa, had now broken those bounds, and was preached in all parts of the earth. See Col. i. 6, 23.
