<p><strong> 18</strong> .] <strong> But</strong> (in anticipation of an objection that Israel, whom he has especially in view, <em> had not sufficiently heard</em> the good tidings) <strong> I say, Did they not hear</strong> ( ἤκουσαν partly founded on the cognate ἀκοή of the last verse, partly recalling the ἤκουσαν of Rom 10:14 )? <strong> nay rather</strong> (ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:20">Romans 9:20</span> , note) <strong> into all the earth went forth their voice, and to the ends of the world their words</strong> . It is remarkable that so few of the Commentators have noticed (I have found it only in Bengel, and there but faintly hinted: Olsh., who defends the applicability of the text, does not even allude to it) that <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:0">Psalms 19:0</span> is <em> a comparison of the sun, and glory of the heavens</em> , with the <em> word of God</em> . As far as Rom 10:6 the glories of nature are described: then the great subject is taken up, and the parallelism carried out to the end. So that the Apostle has not, as alleged in nearly all the Commentators, merely accommodated the text allegorically, but <em> taken it in its context</em> , and followed up the comparison of the Psalm.

<p>As to the assertion of the preaching of the Gospel having gone out into all the world, when as yet a small part of it only had been evangelized, we must remember that it is not the <em> extent</em> , so much as the <em> universality in character</em> , of this preaching, which the Apostle is here asserting; that word of God, hitherto confined within the limits of Judæa, had now broken those bounds, and was preached in all parts of the earth.
