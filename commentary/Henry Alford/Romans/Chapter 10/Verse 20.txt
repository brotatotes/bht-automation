<b> 20.</b>]<b> But</b> (even more than this: there is stronger testimony yet)<b> Isaiah is very bold and saith</b> (i. e. as we say, ‘dares to say,’ ‘<i>ventures to speak thus plainly</i>’),<b> I was found</b> (so the Septuagint, the Hebrew has ‘I was sought: but apparently in the sense of Ezek. xiv. 3; xx. 3, ‘enquired of:? which amounts to<i> being found</i>)<b> by those who sought me not; I became manifest to those who asked not after me.</b> De Wette und other modern Commentators have maintained that Isa, lxv. 1 is spoken of the Jews, and not of the Gentiles; their main argument for this view being the connexion of ch. lxiv. and lxv. But even granting this connexion, it does not follow that God is not speaking in reproach to Israel in ch. lxv. 1, and reminding them prophetically, that while they, His own rebellious people, provoke Him to anger, the Gentiles which never sought Him have found Him. ‘<i>The nation which was not called by my Name,</i>’ in lxv. 1, can only primarily mean the Gentiles.<b></b>
