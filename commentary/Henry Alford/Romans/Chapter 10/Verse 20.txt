 20 .]  But (even more than this: there is stronger testimony yet)  Esaias is very bold and says (i.e. as we say, ‘dares to say,’ ‘  ventures to speak thus plainly .’ Thol. compares Æschin. de Falsa Leg. c. 45: κἂν ἐθελήσῃ σχετλιάζειν κ . λέγειν ),  I was found (so LXX, the Heb. is נִדְרַשְׁתִּי , ‘I was sought:’ but apparently in the sense of Ezekiel 14:3 ; Ezekiel 20:3 , ‘enquired of:’ which amounts to εὑρέθην . In Ezekiel 14:0 the LXX render it ἀποκρίνεσθαι and so Stier here,  Ich gebe Antwort …)  by (or  among) those who sought me not, I became manifest to those who asked not after me . The clauses are inverted in order from the LXX.
	De Wette and other modern Commentators have maintained that Isa 65:1 is spoken of the Jews, and not of the Gentiles; their main argument for this view being the connexion of Isaiah 64-65 But even granting this connexion, it does not follow that God is not speaking in reproach to Israel in ch. Isaiah 65:1 , and reminding them prophetically, that while they, His own rebellious people, provoke Him to anger, the Gentiles which never sought Him have found Him. The whole passage is thoroughly gone into and its true meaning satisfactorily shewn, in Stier’s valuable work, “  Tesaias, nicht Pseudo-Tesaias ,” pp. 797 ff., who remarks that ‘  the nation which was not called by my Name ,’ in Isaiah 65:1 , can only primarily mean the Gentiles.
