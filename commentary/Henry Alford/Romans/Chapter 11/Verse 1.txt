<b> 1.</b>]<b> I say then</b> (a false inference from ch. x. 19–21,—made in order to be refuted),<b> Did</b> (meaning, It cannot surely be, that)<b> God cast off His people</b> (as woUld almost appear from the severe words just adduced)?<b> It is not so</b> (<b>God forbid</b>).<b> For I also am an Israelite</b> (see Phil. iii. 5),<b> of the seed of Abraham</b> (mentioned probably for solemnity’s sake, as bringing to mind all the promises made to Abraham),<b> of the tribe of Benjamin</b> (so Phil. iii. 5).—There is some question<i> with what intent</i> the Apostle here brings forward<i> himself</i>. Three answers are open to us: either (1) it is as<i> a case in point</i>, as an example of an Israelite who has<i> not been rejected</i>, but<i> is still one of God’s people</i>: so almost all the Commentators—but this is hardly probable,—for in this case (a) he would not surely bring one only example to prove his point, when thousands might have been alleged,— (4) it would be hardly consistent with the humble mind of St. Paul to put himself alone in such a place,—and (c) “<i>God forbid</i>” does not go simply to<i> deny</i> a hypothetical<i> fact,</i> but: applies to<i> some deprecated consequence</i> of that which is hypothetically put:—or (2) he implies, ‘<i>How can I say such a thing, who am myself an Israelite</i>”&c.? ‘Does not my very nationality furnish a security against my entertaining such an idea–or (3) which I believe to be the right view, but which I have found only in the recent commentary of Mr. Ewbank,—as implying that if such a hypothesis were to be conceded, it would exclude from God’s kingdom the<i> writer himself, as an Israelite</i>. This seems better to agree with “<i>God forbid,</i>” as deprecating the<i> consequence</i> of such an asser-tion.—But a question even more important arises, not unconnected with that. just discussed: viz.<i> who are</i><b> His people</b>? In order for the sentence to bear the meaning just assigned to it, it is obvious that<b> His people</b> must mean the people of God<i> nationally</i> considered. If Paul deprecated such a proposition as the rejection of<i> God’s people,</i> because he himself would thus be<i> as an Israelite</i> cut off from God’s favour, the rejection assumed in the hypothesis must be<i> a national rejection</i>. It is against<i> this</i> that he puts in his strong protest. It is<i> this</i> which he disproves by a cogent historical parallel from Scripture, shewing that there is a remnant even at the present time according to the election of grace: and not only so, but that that part of Israel (considered as having continuity of national existence) which is for a time hardened, shall ultimately come in, and so all Israel (nationally considered again, Israel<i> as a nation</i>) shall be saved. Thus the covenant of God with Israel, having been<i> national</i>, shall ultimately be fulfilled to them<i> as a nation</i>: not by the gathering in merely ot<i> individual</i> Jews, or of<i> all</i> the Jews<i> individually</i>, into the Christian Church,–but by the<i> national restoration</i> of the Jews, not in unbelief, but as a<i> Christian believing nation, to all that can, under the gospel, represent their ancient pre-eminence, and to the fulness of those promises which have never yet in their plain sense been accomplished to them.</i> I have entered on this matter here, because a clear understanding of it underlies all intelligent appreciation of the argument of the chapter. Those who hold<i> no national restoration of the Jews to pre-eminence,</i> must necessarily confound<i> the present remnant according to the election of grace,</i> with<i> the remainder</i>, who nationally shall be grafted in again.
