 10. ]  let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and their back bow thou down always . “Instead of bending the back, the Heb. text speaks of making the loins to tremble, מָתְנֵיהֶם הַמְעַד . This elsewhere is a sign of  great terror , Nahum 2:10 ; Daniel 5:6 ; and the  darkening of the eyes betokens in the Psalm, a weakened, humbled, servile condition, just as in Deuteronomy 28:65-67 . It is plain from διὰ παντός , that we must not suppose the infirmities of  age to be meant. The Apostle might well apply such a description to the servile condition of the bondmen of the law, see Galatians 4:24 .” Tholuck.
