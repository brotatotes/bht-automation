<b> 10.</b>]<b> let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and their back bow thou down always.</b> ( “Instead of<i> bending the back</i>, the Hebrew text speaks of<i> making the loins to tremble.</i> This elsewhere is a sign of<i> great terror,</i> Nah. ii. 10; Dan. v. 6: and the<i> darkening of the eyes</i> betokens in the Psalm, a weakened, humbled, servile condition, just, as in Deut. xxviii. 65–67. It is plain from the word<i> always</i>, that we must not suppose the infirmities of age to be meant. The Apostle might well apply such a description to the servile condition of the bondmen of the law, see Gal. iv. 24.” Tholuck.)
