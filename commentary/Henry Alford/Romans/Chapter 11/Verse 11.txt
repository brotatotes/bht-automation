 11. ]  I say then (see on Rom 11:1 ),  Did they (who? see below)  stumble in order that they should fall (not ‘  sic, ut caderent ’ as Vulg., so Orig [102] , Chrys., Grot., al., denoting the  result merely: neither the grammar nor the context will bear this: the Apostle is arguing respecting  God’s intent in the παράπτωμα of the Jewish nation. He here calls it by this mild name to set forth that it is not final. The subject of ἔπταισαν is the αὐτοί of the following verses, i.e. the  Jews, as a people : not the  unbelieving individuals , who  are characterized as  πεσόντες , Romans 11:22 . He regards the λοιποί as the representatives of the Jewish people, who have  nationally stumbled , but not  in order to their final fall , seeing that God has a gracious purpose towards the Gentiles even  in this πταῖσμα of theirs, and intends to raise  them nationally from it in the end. This distinction, between the πταίσαντες ,  the whole nation as a nation , and the πεσόντες , the  unbelieving branches who have been cut off , is most important to the right understanding of the chapter, and to the keeping in mind the separate ideas, of the  restoration of individuals here and there throughout time, and the  restoration of Israel at the end.
	 [102] Origen, b. 185, d. 254
	The stress is on  πέσωσιν , and it is the  fall which is denied: not on  ἵνα πέσωσιν , so that the  purpose merely should be denied, and the fall admitted)?  God forbid: but (the truer account of the matter is)  by their trespass (not  fall , as E. V.)  salvation (has come) to the Gentiles, for to provoke them (Israel)  to jealousy . Two gracious purposes of God are here stated, the latter wrought out through the former. By this stumble of the Jews out of their national place in God’s favour, and the admission of the Gentiles into it, the very people thus excluded are to be stirred up to set themselves in the end effectually to regain, as a nation, that pre-eminence from which they are now degraded.
