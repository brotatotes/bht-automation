<b> 11.</b>]<b> I say then</b> (see on ver. 1),<b> Did they</b> (who? see below)<b> stumble in order that they should fall</b> (not, “<i>so that they fell,</i>” as Origen, Chrysostom, and others, denoting the<i> result</i> merely: neither the grammar nor the context will bear this: the Apostle is arguing respecting<i> God's intent</i> in the<i> trespass</i> of the Jewish nation. He here calls it by this mild name, to set forth that it is not final. The<i> persons who stumbled</i> are those who are designated by “<i>they</i>” in the following verses, i.e. the<i> Jews as a people:</i> not the<i> unbelieving individuals,</i> who<i> are</i><i> characterized as “they which fell,</i>” ver. 22. He regards the “rest” as the representatives of the Jewish people, who have<i> nationally stumbled</i>, but not<i> in order</i><i> to their final fall</i>, seeing that God has a gracious purpose towards the Gentiles even<i> in</i> this “<i>stumbling</i>” of theirs, and intends to raise<i> them nationally from it</i> in the end. This distinction, between the<i> stumblers</i>,<i> the whole nation as a nation,</i> and the<i> fallen,</i> the<i> unbelieving branches who have been cut off,</i> is most important to the right understanding of the chapter, and to the keeping in mind the separate ideas, of the<i> restoration of individuals</i> here and there throughout time, and the<i> restoration of Israel</i> at the end.—The stress here is on the word<b> fall,</b> and it is the<i> fall</i> which is denied: not on the words “<i>in order that,</i>” so that the<i> purpose</i> merely should be denied, and the fall admitted)<b>?</b><b> God forbid: but</b> (the truer account of the matter is)<b> by their trespass</b> (not<i> fall</i>, as E. V)<b> salvation</b> [<b>is come</b>]<b> to the Gentiles, for to provoke them</b> (Israel)<b> to jealousy.</b>—Two gracious purposes of God are here stated, the latter wrought out through the former. By this stumble of the Jews out of their national place in God’s favour, and the admission of the Gentiles into it, the very people thus excluded are to be stirred up to set themselves in the end effectually to regain, as a nation, that preeminence from which they are now degraded.
