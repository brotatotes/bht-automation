<b> 12.</b>] Then the Apostle argues on this, as Meyer well says, “from the<br><br> prosperous effect of a worse cause, to the more prosperous effect of a better cause.”—<b>But</b> ( ‘taking for granted, that’—as in last verse—taking for granted the historical fact, that the stumble of the Jews has been coincident with the admission of the Gentiles)<b> if their trespass is the riches of the world</b> (the<i> occasion</i> of that wealth,—the wealth itselt being the participation in the unsearchable riches of Christ),<b> and</b> (this latter clause parallel to and explanatory of the less plainly expressed one before it)<b> their diminishing, the riches of the Gentiles, how much more</b><b> (shall) their fulness (be all this)?</b>—On the words here used,<b> diminishing</b> and<b> fulness</b>, much question has been raised. I have taken both as answering strictly to the comparison here before the Apostle’s mind, viz. that of impoverishing and enriching, the possessives<b> their</b>, and<b> of the world, of the Gentiles</b>, as<i> subjective: ‘if their impoverishment be the wealth of the Gentiles, how much more shall their enrichment be!’</i>—But several other interpretations are possible. (1)<b> Diminishing</b> may mean, as in 1 Cor. vi. 7,<i> degradation</i>, and<b> fulness</b> would then be<i> re-exaltation</i> to the former measure of favour,—or perhaps ‘their<i> completion</i>,’ ‘their highest degree of favour.’ (2) If we regard the meaning of “<i>fulness</i>” in ver. 25, we shall be tempted here to understand it ‘<i>full number,’</i> and<b> similarly diminishing</b>, ‘<i>small number.</i>’ So the majority of Commentators. Thus the argument will stand: ‘If their unbelief (i. e. of one part of them) is the world’s wealth, and their small number (i. e. of believers, the other part of them), the Wealth of the Gentiles, how much more their full (restored) number!’ i.e. as Olshansen explains it, ‘If so few Jews can do so much for the Gentile world, what will not the whole number do?’ But thus we shall lose the argument, from the less to the greater,— ‘if their<i> sin</i> has done so much, how much more their<i> conversion?</i>’ unless indeed it be said that reduction of numbers<i> implies</i> a national trespass. Besides, it can hardly be shewn that the original word rendered<b> diminishing</b> will bear this meaning of ‘a small number.’ (3) Tholuck, from whom mostly this note is taken, notices at length the view of Olshausen, after Origen, that the idea of a<i> definite number of the elect</i> is here in the Apostle’s mind,—that the falling off of the Jews produces a deficiency in the number, which is filled up by the elect from the Gentiles, as ver. 25: understanding by<b> fulness</b> both there and here, if I take his meaning aright, the<i> number required to fill up the roll of the elect,</i> whether of Jews, as here, or Gentiles, as there. Tholuck, while he concedes the legitimacy of the<i> idea</i> of a<i> fulness of the elect,</i> maintains, and rightly, that in this section<i> no such idea is brought</i><i> forward:</i> and that it would not have been intended, without<i> some more definite expression of it than we now find.</i>—I have thought it best, as above, considering the very various meanings and difficulty of the word<b> fulness</b>, to keep here to that which seems to be indicated by the immediate context, which is, besides, the primitive meaning of the word.—It must be noticed, that the fact, of<i> Israel being the chosen people of God,</i> lies at the root of all this argument. Israel is<i> the nation,</i> the covenant people,—the vehicle of God's gracious purposes to mankind. Israel, nationally, is deposed from present favour. That very deposition is, however, accompanied by an outpouring of God’s riches of mercy on the Gentiles; not as rivals to Israel, but<i> still considered as further from God, formally and nationally, than Israel.</i> If then the<i> disgrace of Israel</i> has had such a blessed accompaniment, how much more blessed a one shall<i> Israel’s honour</i> bring with it, when His own people shall once more be set as a praise in the midst of the earth, and the glory of the nation.
