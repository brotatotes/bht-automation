 13 .] ‘Why, in an argument concerning the  Jews , dwell so much on the reference to the  Gentiles discernible in the divine œconomy regarding Israel? Why make it appear as if the treatment of God’s chosen people were regulated not by a consideration of  them , but of the less favoured Gentiles?’ The present verse gives an answer to this question.  But (apology for the foregoing verse: if γάρ be read, the sense will be much the same  For (i.e. let it be understood, that), &c.)  I am speaking to you the Gentiles. Inasmuch therefore (  μὲν οὖν is surely not to be rejected as yielding no sense, as De Wette and Tholuck, who object to it as proceeding from those who hold a new sentence to begin at ἐφ ʼ ὅσον , and ὑμῖν .… ἔθνεσιν to refer to the foregoing: but the usage of μὲν οὖν in 1Co 6:4 seems strictly analogous to that in our text, where no new sentence is begun in any sense which may not be true here.
	 ἐφ  ʼ   ὅσον , not ‘  as long as ,’ as Orig [103] and Vulg.)  as I am Apostle of the Gentiles, I honour mine office (by striving for their conversion and edification at all times, by introducing a reference to them and their part in the divine counsels, even when speaking of mine own people),  if by any means I may (regarding it as a real service done on behalf of Israel, thus to honour mine office by mentioning the Gentiles, if this mention may)  provoke to jealousy mine own flesh (the Jews)  and may save some of them.
