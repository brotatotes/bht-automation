<b> 15.</b>]<b> For</b> (a reason for my anxiety for the salvation of Israel: not merely for the sake of mine own kinsmen, but because their recovery will bring about the blessed consummation of all believers. Verses 13, 14 should not then be in a parenthesis, as sometimes printed)<b> if the rejection of them</b> (not ‘<i>their loss,</i>’ as Luther and others, by which the antithesis to what follows is weakened)<b> be</b> (the occasion of)<b> the reconciliation of the world</b> (of the Gentiles, viz. to God),<b> what</b> ( ‘of what, kind,’ in its effect) (<b>will be</b>)<b> the receiving of them, but</b> (the occasion of)<b> life from the dead?—Life from the dead</b> may be variously taken. (1) It may be metaphorical, as in ch. vi. 13, and may import, that so general a conversion of the world would take place, as would be like life from the dead. So, more or less, many Commentators, who explain it of a joy like that of the resurrection. But against this interpretation lies the objection, that<i> this is already involved</i> in<i> the reconciling</i><i> of the world,</i> and thus no new idea would be brought out by the words, which stand in the most emphatic position. (2) It may mean that ‘life from the dead’<i> literally</i> should follow on the restoration of the Jewish people; i.e. that the Resurrection, the great consummation, is bound up with it. So Chrysostom, Origen (who says, “Then will take place the receiving of, Israel, when the dead also shall receive life, and the world from corruptible shall be made incorruptible, and mortals shall be endowed with immortality”), and many others. The objection to this view seems to be, that the Apostle would hardly have used<b> life from the dead</b> thus predicatively, if he had meant by it a fixed and predetermined<i> event</i>;—but that, standing as it does, it must be<i> qualitative</i>, implying<i> some further blessed state</i> of the reconciled world, over and above the mere reconciliation. This might well be designated<i> ‘life from the dead,’</i> and in it may be<i> implied</i> the glories of the first resurrection, and deliverance from the bondage of corruption, without supposing the words<b> life from the dead</b> to be equivalent to<i> the resurrection of the dead.</i>—Stuart well compares Ezek. xxxvii. 1–14, which was perhaps before the mind of the Apostle.
