<p><strong> 17</strong> .] <strong> But</strong> (introduces a hypothesis involving a seeming inconsistency with the ἁγιότης just mentioned) <strong> if some of the branches</strong> (the τινες , as Thol. remarks, depreciates the number, in order to check the Gentile pride) <strong> were broken out</strong> (from the tree), <strong> and thou</strong> (a Gentile believer) <strong> being a wild olive</strong> ( ἀγριέλαιος , the tree, spoken of a sprout or branch of it. Better so than, as Fritz., Meyer, to make ἀγρ . an adj., ‘of wild olive,’ which can only be used of that which <em> is made out of the wood</em> , as ἀγριέλαιος σκυτάλη . Thol.) <strong> wast grafted in</strong> (Clem [106] Alex. Strom. vi. [15] § 119, p. 799 P., enumerates four different kinds of ἐγκεντρισμός , using it as a general term for grafting and budding. The difficulty here is, that the Apostle <em> reverses</em> the natural process. It is the <em> wilding</em> , in practice, which is the <em> stock</em> , and the graft inserted is a sprout of the <em> better tree</em> . I believe that he <em> does not here regard</em> what is the fact in nature: but makes a supposition perfectly legitimate, that a wilding graft on being inserted into a good tree, thereby becomes partaker of its qualities. No allusion can be intended to a practice mentioned by Columella, de Re Rust. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:9">Romans 11:9</span> , of inserting a wilding graft into a good tree to increase the vigour and growth of the tree: for this would completely stultify the illustration the point of which is, <strong> a</strong> <em> benefit</em> received by the wilding from the tree, not one <em> conferred</em> by the wilding on it) <strong> among them</strong> (i.e. among the branches, τοῖς κλάδοις : or perhaps αὐτοῖς may imply the <em> remnants</em> of the branches broken off. The renderings, ‘ <em> in their stead</em> ,’ ‘ <em> in locum</em> ,’ as De W. after Chrys., Theophyl., Beza, and ‘ <em> in their place</em> ,’ ‘ <em> in loco</em> ,’ Meyer, Olsh., are surely inadmissible), <strong> and becamest a fellow-partaker</strong> (with the branches: or perhaps simply ‘a partaker,’ σύν not implying <em> fellows in participation</em> , but merely the participation itself) <strong> of the root of the fatness</strong> (of that root, on union with which all the development of life and its fertility depend: which is the source of the fatness. With καί , it will mean, of the source of life, and also of the development of that life itself in all richness of blessing) <strong> of the olive-tree</strong> ,
