 2 .]  God did not cast off his people which he foreknew ( προέγνω as in reff.: ‘  which, in His own eternal decree before the world, He selected as the chosen nation, to be His own, the depositary of His law, the vehicle of the theocracy, from its first revelation to Moses, to its completion in Christ’s future kingdom .’ It is plain that this must here be the sense, and that the words must not be limited, with Orig [97] , Aug [98] , Chrys., Calv., al., to the  elect Christian people of God from among the Jews, with Paul as their representative: see on Romans 11:1 . On this explanation, the question of Rom 11:1 would be  self-contradictory , and this negation a  truism . It would be inconceivable, that God should cast off  His elect ).

	 Or (see ch. Rom 9:21 al.: introduces a new objection to the matter impugned)  know ye not what the Scripture saith in (the history of) Elias (better thus than ‘  with regard to ,’ as Luth., Erasm., Calv., Beza, al. Tholuck gives examples: from Pausan. viii. 37. 3, ἔστιν ἐν Ἥρας ὅρκῳ τὰ ἔπη , i.e. in that part of the Iliad ( ξ . 278) where Hera swears by the Titans: from Thucyd. i. 9, καὶ ἐν τοῦ σκήπτρου ἅμα τῇ παραδόσει εἴρηκεν αὐτὸν πολλῇσι νήσοισι κ . Ἄργεϊ παντὶ ἀνάσσειν , i.e. in that part of the Iliad ( β . 108) where the transmission of the sceptre is related)?  how (depends on οὐκ οἴδατε )  he pleads with see reff. and note, ch. Rom 8:26 )  God against Israel , &c. The citation is a free one from the LXX. The clauses τοὺς προφ ., and τὰ θυσιαστ . are inverted, ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ is omitted, and κἀγὼ ὑπελείφθ . μόνος is put for καὶ ὑπολέλειμμαι ἐγὼ μονώτατος . The altars, as De W. observes, were those on the high places, dedicated to God.
