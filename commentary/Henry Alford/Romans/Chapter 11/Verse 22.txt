 22 .] The caution of the preceding verse is unfolded into a setting before the Gentile of the true state of the matter.  Behold therefore (  posito , that thou enterest into the feeling prompted by the last verse)  the goodness and the severity (no allusion to ἀποτέμνω in its literal sense)  of God: towards those who fell (see on Rom 11:11 ).

Rückert thinks that because Clem [108] Alex. Pædag. i. 8 [70], p. 140 P., understands χρηστότης , in ἐὰν ἐπιμείνῃς τῇ χρηστότητι , of the χρηστότης of  men ( τουτέστι τῇ εἰς χριστὸν πίστει ), θεοῦ may have been a marginal gloss to guard against this mistake, and may have found its way into the text, misplaced. But this is hardly probable: θεοῦ is much more likely to have been erased as unnecessary),  if thou abide by (reff.)  that goodness; for ([supply  otherwise :] assuming that thou dost  not abide by that goodness)  thou also shalt be cut off (ind. fut. The placing only a comma at ἐκκοπήσῃ , as Meyer, not Lachm. (Exodus 2:0 ) and Tischend.(Exodus 7:0 [and 8]), prevents the break evidently intended between the treatment of the case of the Gentile and that of the Jews).
