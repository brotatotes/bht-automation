<b> 25.</b>]<b> For</b> (I do not rest this on mere hope or probability, but have direct revelation of the Holy Spirit as to its certainty)<b> I would not have you ignorant, brethren</b> (an expression used by the Apostle to announce, either as here some authoritative declaration of divine truth, or some facts in his own history not previously known to his readers),<b> of this mystery</b> (the meanings included in the word<b> mystery</b> may be thus classified: (1)<i> such matters of fact as are inaccessible to reason, and can only be known through revelation:</i> (2)<i> such matters as are patent facts, but the process of which cannot be entirely taken in by the reason.</i> We may add a third sense,—that, which is no mystery<i> in itself</i>, but<i> by its figurative import</i>. Of the first, we may cite ch. xvi. 25; 1 Cor. ii. 7–10; Eph. i. 9; iii. 4; vi. 19; Col. i. 26, as examples: of the second, 1 Cor. xiv. 2; xiii. 2; Eph. v. 32; 1 Tim. iii. 9, 16: of the third, Matt. xiii. 11; Rev. i. 20; xvii. 5; 2 Thess. ii. 7.—The first meaning is evidently that in our text:— ‘a prophetic event, unattainable by human knowledge, but revealed from the secrets of God’),<b> lest ye should be wise in your own conceits</b> (that ye donot take to yourselves the credit for wisdom superior to that of the Jews, in having acknowledged and accepted Jesus as the Son of God,—seeing that ye merely have received mercy through their unbelief, ver. 30),—<b>that hardening</b> (not ‘<i>blindness;</i>’ see above on ver. 7, and Eph. iv. 18, note)<b> is come upon Israel in part</b> (i. e. a<i> portion</i> of Israel have been hardened),<b> until</b> (this until has been variously understood by those who wish to escape from the prophetic assertion of the restoration of Israel. So Calvin says, “<i>until</i>” has no reference to progress or order of<i> time</i>, but rather means<i> in order that</i> the fulness of the Gentiles may come in. Others interpret it, “<i>while the fulness... shall</i><i> come in:</i>” but all these are mere evasions)<b> the fulness</b> (completion)<b> of the Gentiles</b> (shall have)<b> come in</b> (to the Church or Kingdom of God, where we, the Apostle and those whom he addresses, are already: as we use the word ‘<i>come in,</i>’ with reference to the place in which we are. Or the word may be used absolutely, as it seems to be in Luke xi. 52, of<i> entering into the Kingdom of God</i>).—In order to understand<b> the fulness of the Gentiles</b>, we must bear in mind the character of the Apostle’s present argument. He is dealing with<i> nations:</i> with the Gentile nations, and the Jewish nation. And thus dealing, he speaks of<i> the fullness of the Gentiles</i> coming in, and<i> of all Israel</i> being saved: having<i> no regard</i> for the time to the<i> individual destinies</i> of Gentiles or Jews, but regarding nations as each included under the common bond of consanguinity according to the flesh. The<b> fulness of the Gentiles</b> I would regard then as signifying ‘<i>the full number</i>,’ ‘<i>the totality,</i>’ of the nations, i.e.<i> every nation under heaven</i>, the prophetic subjects (Matt. xxiv. 14) of the preaching of the gospel. The idea of an<i> elect number</i>, however true in, itself, does not seem to belong to this passage.
