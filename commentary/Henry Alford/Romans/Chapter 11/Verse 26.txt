<b> 26.</b>] And thus (when this condition shall have been fulfilled)<b> all Israel shall be saved</b> (<i>Israel as a nation,</i> see above: not individuals,—nor is there the slightest ground for the notion. This prophecy has been very variously regarded. Origen, understanding by the all Israel which shall he saved, the<i> elected remnant</i>, yet afterwards appears to find in the passage his notion of the final purification of all men,—of the believing, by the word and doctrine: of the unbelieving, by purgatorial fire—Chrysostom gives no explanation: but on our Lord’s words in Matt. xvii. 11, he says, “When He says that Elias shall come and restore all things, He speaks of Elias himself, and of the conversion of the Jews which shall then take place,”—and shortly after calls him<i> the Forerunner of the Lord’s second coming</i>. Similarly Theodoret and Gregory of Nyssa; so also Augustine, saying, “That in the last times, before the judgment, the Jews (by means of Elias who shall expound the law to them) shall believe in Christ, is a thing much asserted in the sayings and hearts of the faithful.” Similarly most of the fathers and schoolmen. Jerome, however, on Isa. xi. 11, says, “By no means, as our Judaizers say, shall all Israel be saved at the end of the world when the fulness of the nations shall have come in; but we understand all this of the first advent.” Grotius and Wetstein believe it to have been fulfilled after the destruction of Jerusalem, when, as Eusebius relates, thousands of the circumcision became believers in Christ. But Tholuck has shewn that neither could the number of Gentiles received into the Church before that time have answered to the<i> fulness of the Gentiles</i>, nor those Jews to<i> all Israel</i>, which expression accordingly Grotius endeavours to explain by a Rabbinical formula, that “all Israel have a part in the Messiah;” and this saying he supposes the Apostle to have used in a spiritual sense, meaning the Israel of God, as Gal. vi. 16.—The Reformers for the most part, in their zeal to impugn the millenarian superstitions then current, denied the future general conversion of the Jews, and would not reeognize it even in this passage:—Luther<i> did so recognize it</i>, at one time, but towards the end of his life spoke most characteristically and strongly of what he conceived to be the impossibility of such national conversion.—Calvin says: “Many understand this of the Jewish people, as if Paul said that they should be restored to religion as before; but I extend the name of Israel to all the people of God, in this sense, when the Gentiles shall have entered in, the Jews also from their defection shall betake themselves to the obedience of the faith, and thus will be completed the salvation of all the Israel of God, which must be compounded of both: but so that the Jews shall have the prior place as being the firstborn in the family of God.” Bengel and Olshausen interpret<b> all Israel</b> of the<i> elect believers of Israel:</i>—Beza, Tholuck, and many others, hold that the words refer, as I have explained them above, to a national restoration of Israel to God’s favour.—I have not mixed with the consideration of this prophecy the question of the restoration of the Jews to<i> Palestine,</i> as being clearly irrelevant to it: the matter here treated being,<i> their reception into the Church of God</i>):<br><br><b> as it is written</b>] This quotation appears to have for its object to shew that the Redeemer was to come<i> for the behoof of God’s own chosen people.</i>—For<b> out of Sion,</b> the Septuagint have ‘<i>for the sake of Sion,</i>’ the A.V. ‘<i>to Zion.</i>’ The Apostle frequently varies from the Septuagint, and a sufficient reason can generally be assigned for the variation: here, though this reason is not apparent, we cannot doubt that such existed, for the Septuagint version would surely have suited his purpose even better than “<i>out of,</i>” had there been no objection to it. It may be that the whole citation is intended to express the sense of prophecy rather than the wording of any particular passage, and that the Apostle has, in the words “<i>out of Sion,</i>” summed up the prophecies which declare that the Redeemer should<i> spring out of Israel.</i> The Hebrew and A.V. have, ‘<i>and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob.</i>’
