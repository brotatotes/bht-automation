<p><strong> 26.</strong> ] <strong> And thus</strong> (when this condition shall have been fulfilled) <strong> all Israel shall be saved</strong> ( <em> Israel as a nation</em> , see above: not individuals, nor is there the slightest ground for the notion of the ἀποκατάστασις ).
	</p>
<p>This prophecy has been very variously regarded. Origen, understanding by the ‘omnis Israel qui salvus fiet,’ the ‘reliquiæ quæ electæ sunt,’ yet afterwards appears to find in the passage his notion of the final purification of all men, of the believing, by the word and doctrine: of the unbelieving, by purgatorial fire. Chrysostom gives no explanation: but on our Lord’s words in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:11">Matthew 17:11</span> , he says, ὅταν εἴπῃ ὅτι Ἠλίας μὲν ἔρχεται κ . ἀποκαταστήσει πάντα , αὐτὸν Ἠλίαν φησί , <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὴν τότε ἐσομένην τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἐπιστροφήν</strong> , and shortly after calls him τῆς δευτέρας παρουσίας πρόδρομος . Similarly Theodoret and Gregory of Nyssa (in Thol.); so also Augustine, de Civ. Dei xx. 29, vol. vii. p. 704, ‘ultimo tempore ante judicium (per Eliam, exposita sibi lege) Judæos in Christum verum esse credituros, celeberrimum est in sermonibus cordibusve fidelium.’ Similarly most of the fathers (Estius), and schoolmen (Thol.); Jerome, however, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:11">Isaiah 11:11</span> , vol. iv. p. 162, says, ‘Nequaquam juxta nostros Judaizantes, in fine mundi quum intraverit plenitudo gentium, tunc omnis Israel salvus fiet: sed hæc omnia de primo intelligamus adventu.’ Grotius and Wetst. believe it to have been fulfilled after the destruction of Jerusalem, when μυρίοι ἐκ περιτομῆς became believers in Christ (Eus [110] H. E. iii. 35). But Thol. has shewn that neither could the number of Gentiles received into the Church before that time have answered to the πλήρωμα τ . ἐθνῶν , nor those Jews to πᾶς Ἰσραήλ , which expression accordingly Grotius endeavours to explain by a Rabbinical formula, that “all Israel have a part in the Messiah;” which saying he supposes the Apostle to have used in a spiritual sense, meaning the Israel of God, as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16">Galatians 6:16</span> . The Reformers for the most part, in their zeal to impugn the millenarian superstitions then current, denied the future general conversion of the Jews, and would not recognize it even in this passage: Luther <em> did so</em> [recognize it], at one time, but towards the end of his life spoke most characteristically and strongly of what he conceived to be the impossibility of such national conversion (see extract in Tholuck’s note, p. 616): Calvin says: ‘Multi accipiunt de populo Judaico, ac si Paulus diceret instaurandum adhuc in religionem ut prius: sed ego Israelis nomen ad totum Dei populum extendo, hoc sensu, Quum Gentes ingressæ fuerint, simul et Judæi ex defectione se ad fidei obedientiam recipient. Atque ita complebitur salus totius Israelis Dei, quem ex utrisque colligi oportet: sic tamen ut priorem locum Judæi obtineant, ceu in familia Dei primogeniti.’ Calovius, Bengel, and Olshausen, interpret πᾶς Ἰσρ . of the <em> elect believers of Israel</em> : Beza, Estius, Koppe, Reiche, Köllner, Meyer, Tholuck, De Wette, al., hold that the words refer, as I have explained them above, to a national restoration of Israel to God’s favour.

<p>I have not mixed with the consideration of this prophecy the question of the restoration of the Jews <em> to Palestine</em> , as being clearly irrelevant to it: the matter here treated being, <em> their reception into the Church of God</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> καθὼς γέγρ</strong> .] This quotation appears to have for its object to shew that the Redeemer was to come <em> for the behoof of God’s own chosen people</em> .
	</p>
<p>For ἐκ Σιών , the LXX have ἕνεκεν Σιών ( לְצִיּוֹן ), the E. V. ‘ <em> to Zion</em> .’ The Apostle frequently varies from the LXX, and a sufficient reason can generally be assigned for the variation: here, though this reason is not apparent, we cannot doubt that such existed, for the LXX would surely have suited his purpose even better than ἐκ , had there been no objection to it. It may be that the whole citation is intended to express the sense of prophecy rather than the wording of any particular passage, and that the Apostle has, in ἐκ Σιών , summed up the prophecies which declare that the Redeemer should <em> spring out of Israel</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ὁ ῥυόμ</strong> . is in the Heb. ‘a deliverer’ the Apostle adopts the LXX, probably as appropriating the expression to Christ.

<p><strong> ἀποστρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> κ . τ . λ .] Heb. and E. V. ‘ <em> and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob</em> .’

<p><strong> ὅταν ἀφέλ</strong> . from another place in Isa.(ref.), hardly from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:0">Jeremiah 31:0</span> (LXX, 38.) 34, as Stuart; and also containing a general reference to the character of God’s new covenant with them, rather than a strict reproduction of the original meaning of any particular words of the prophet. “How came the Apostle, if he wished only to express the general thought, that the Messiah was come for Israel, to choose just this citation, consisting of two combined passages, when the same is expressed more directly in other passages of the Old Testament? I believe that the ἥξει gave occasion for the quotation: if he did not refer this directly to the second coming of the Messiah, yet it allowed of being indirectly applied to it.” Tholuck.</p>
