<b> 32.</b>]<b> For</b> (foundation of the last stated arrangement in the divine purposes)<b> God shut up</b> (the indefinite past tense, which should be kept in the rendering, refers to the time of the act in the divine procedure)<b> all men in disobedience</b> (general here,—every form, unbelief included),<b> that He may have mercy on all.</b>—No mere<i> permissive</i> act of God must here be understood. The Apostle is speaking of the divine arrangement, by which the guilt of sin and the mercy of God were to be made manifest. He treats it, as elsewhere (see ch. ix. 18 and note), entirely with reference to the<i> act of God,</i> taking no account, for the time, of human agency; which, however, when treating of us and our responsibilities, he brings out into as prominent a position: see as the most eminent example of this, the closely following ch. xii 1, 2—But there remains some question,<i> who are the</i><b> all men</b><i> of both clauses?</i> Are they<i> the same?</i> And if so,<i> is any support given to the notion of a general restoration of all men?</i> Certainly they are identical: and signify<i> all men</i>, without limitation. But the ultimate dif-ference between the<i> all men</i> who are shut up under disobedience, and the<i> all men</i> upon whom mercy is shewn is, that by all men<i> this mercy is not accepted,</i> and so men become<i> self-excluded</i> from the salvation of God. GOD’s ACT remains the same, equally gracious, equally universal, whether men accept His mercy or not. This contingency is<i> here not in view:</i> but simply God's<i> act</i> itself.—We can hardly understand the<b> all men</b><i> nationally</i>. The marked universality of the expression recalls the beginning of the Epistle, and makes it a solemn conclusion to the argumentative portion, after which the Apostle, overpowered with the view ot the divine Mercy and Wisdom, breaks forth into the sublimest apostrophe existing even in the pages of Inspiration itself.
