<p><strong> 33</strong> .] There is some doubt whether σοφίας and γνώσεως are genitives <em> after</em> πλούτου , as in E. V., or <em> parallel with</em> it. The former view is adopted by Thom. Aquin., Luther, Beza, Calvin, Estius, Reiche, and al. The grounds on which Reiche supports it are thus given and refuted by Tholuck: (1) “If these three genitives are co-ordinate, καί must stand either before <em> all</em> , or before the last only.” But in the case of three nouns placed co-ordinately in this manner, καί is prefixed to the two latter only, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:7">Romans 2:7</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:2">Romans 12:2</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:17">Luke 5:17</span> . (2) “ πλοῦτος is no <em> qualitative</em> idea, but only a quantitative idea.” But <em> wherein</em> the riches <em> consist</em> , is ordinarily indicated by the context; and here there can be but little doubt on the matter, if we compare ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12">Romans 10:12</span> ; in Php 4:19 we also read of the πλοῦτος of God. This also answers (3) “that πλοῦτος without an adjunct expresses no definite attribute of God.” (4) “in the following citation, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:34-35">Romans 11:34-35</span> , two only of these, σοφία and γνῶσις , are mentioned.” But this may be doubted. Chrys. says, on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span> , αὐτὸς εὗρεν , αὐτὸς ἐποίησεν , αὐτὸς συγκροτεῖ . καὶ γὰρ καὶ <strong> πλούσιός</strong> ἐστι , καὶ οὐ δεῖται παρ ʼ ἑτέρου λαβεῖν · καὶ <strong> σοφός</strong> ἐστι , καὶ οὐ δεῖται συμβούλου . τί λέγω συμβούλου ; οὐδὲ <strong> εἰδέναι</strong> τις δύναται τὰ αὐτοῦ , ἀλλ ʼ ἢ μόνος αὐτὸς ὁ πλούσιος κ . σοφός . Hom. xix. p. 653. Perhaps this latter is altogether too finedrawn: but it is favoured by Bengel, Olsh., and Tholuck.
	</p>
<p>I prefer therefore the view of Chrys., Theodoret, Grot., Bengel, Tholuck, Köllner, and Olsh., to take πλούτου , σοφίας , γνώσεως , as three co-ordinate genitives: <strong> πλ</strong> . denoting the <strong> riches of the divine goodness</strong> , in the whole, and in the result just arrived at, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:32">Romans 11:32</span> ; <strong> σοφ</strong> ., the divine <strong> wisdom</strong> of proceeding in the apparently intricate vicissitudes of nations and individuals: <strong> γνώσ</strong> . (if a distinction be necessary, which can hardly be doubted) the divine <strong> knowledge</strong> of all things from the beginning, God’s comprehension of the end and means together in one unfathomable depth of Omniscience.
	</p>
<p><strong> How unsearchable are His judgments</strong> (the determinations of His wisdom, regarded as in the divine Mind; answering perhaps to γνῶσις . So Thol.: De W. however denies this meaning to κρίματα , and renders it <em> decrees</em> , referring it to the blinding of the Jews) <strong> and His ways unable to be traced out</strong> (His methods of proceeding, answering to σοφία , Thol. But this is perhaps too subtle).</p>
