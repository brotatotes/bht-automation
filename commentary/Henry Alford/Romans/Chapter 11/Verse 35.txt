V.), where the LXX ( Job 41:2 ) have τίς (add ἐστιν ὃς Α) ἀντιστήσεταί μοι , κ . ὑπομενεῖ ; But the Heb. is מִי הִקְדִּימַנִי וַאֲשַׁלִּם , ‘ <em> who hath anticipated</em> (i.e. by the context, <em> conferred a benefit on) me, that I may repay him</em> ?’ And to this the Apostle alludes, using the third person.
