<b> 35.</b>]<b> Or who hath previously given to Him, and shall have recompence made to him again?</b>—From Job xli. 2 (11 of our version), where the Septuagint. have “who shall withstand me, and endure?” But the Hebrew is nearly as our A.V., ‘<i>who hath anticipated</i> (i. e. by the context,<i> conferred a benefit on</i>)<i> me, that I may repay him?</i>’ And to this the Apostle alludes, using the third person.—We can hardly doubt that this question refers to the freeness and richness of God's mercy and love.
