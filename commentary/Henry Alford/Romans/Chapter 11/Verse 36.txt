 36. ]  For (ground of Romans 11:33-35 . Well may all this be true of Him, for)  of Him (in their origin: ‘quod dicit, “ex ipso,” hoc ipsum,  quod sumus indicat:’ Orig [112] Chrys. somewhat differently: see above on Rom 11:33 ),  and through Him (in their subsistence and disposal: ‘ “per Ipsum,” quod per ejus providentiam dispensamur in vita:” Orig [113] ),  and unto Him (‘ “in Ipso,” (so Vulg. and some other vss.) quod perfectio omnium et finis in Ipso erit tunc, cum erit Deus omnia in omnibus:’ Orig [114] )  are all things (not only, though chiefly,  men , but the whole creation). Origen remarks, ‘Vides, quomodo in ultimis ostendit, quod in omnibus quæ supra dixit signaverit, mysterium Trinitatis. Sicut enim in præsenti loco quod ait, “quoniam ex Ipso, et per Ipsum, et in Ipso sunt omnia:” convenit illis dictis, quæ idem Apostolus in aliis memorat locis, cum dicit ( 1Co 8:6 ): “Unus Deus Pater ex quo omnia, et unus Dominus noster Jesus Christus, per quem omnia:” et item in Spiritu Dei dicit revelari omnia, et per hæc designat, in omnibus esse providentiam Trinitatis: ita et cum dicit “altitudo divitiarum,” Patrem, ex quo omnia dicit esse, significat: et sapientiæ altitudinem, Christum, qui est sapientia ejus, ostendit: et scientiæ altitudinem, Spiritum Sanctum, qui etiam alta Dei novit, declarat.’ And, if this be rightly understood, not of a  formal allusion to the Three Persons in the Holy Trinity, but of an  implicit reference (as Thol.) to the  three attributes of Jehovah respectively manifested to us by the three coequal and coeternal Persons, there can hardly be a doubt of its correctness. The objection of De Wette, that not εἰς , but ἐν , would be the designation of the Holy Spirit and His relation to the Universe, applies to that part of Origen’s Commentary which rests on the Vulg.  in ipso and to the idea of a  formal recognition : but not to Tholuck’s remark, illustrated from ὁ ἐπὶ πάντων κ . διὰ πάντων κ . ἐν πᾶσιν ἡμῖν , Ephesians 4:6 , as referring to εἷς θεός , εἷς κύριος , ἓν πνεῦμα . Only those who are dogmatically prejudiced can miss seeing that, though St. Paul has never  definitively expressed the doctrine of the Holy Trinity in a definite formula, yet he was conscious of it as a living reality.
