<b> XII. 1–XV. 13.</b>] PRACTICAL EXHORTATIONS FOUNDED ON THE DOCTRINES BEFORE STATED. And first, ch. xii.<i> general exhortations to a Christian life.</i><br><br><b> 1.</b>]<b> therefore</b> may apply to the whole doctrinal portion of the Epistle which has preceded, which, see Eph. iv. 1; 1 Thess. iv. 1, seems the most natural connexion,—or to ch. 3 xi. 35, 36,—or to the whole close of ch. xi. Theodorest remarks: “What the eye is in are body, that faith is to the soul, and the knowledge of divine things. Yet it has need of practical virtue, as the eye has need of hands and feet and the other parts of the body. And therefore the divine Apostle to his doctrinal argument subjoins ethical instruction also.”<br><br><b> by</b>] This particle introduces an idea, the consideration of which is to give force to the exhortation.<br><br><b> the mercies of God</b>] viz. those detailed and proved throughout the former part of the Epistle. “By these very facts, he says, I beseech you, by which ye were saved: as if any one wishing to make an impression on one who had received great benefits, were to bring his Benefactor himself to supplicate him. Chrysostom.<br><br><b> to present</b>] ‘The verb used is the regular word for<i> bringing to offer in sacrifice.</i><br><br><b> your bodies</b>] Most Commentators say, merely for “<i>yourselves,</i>”—to suit the metaphor of a<i> sacrifice,</i> which consisted of a body: some, because the body is the<i> organ of practical activity</i>, which practical activity is to be dedicated to God: better still, as an indication that the sanctification of Christian life is to extend to that part of man’s nature which is most completely under the bondage of sin.<br><br><b> a living sacrifice</b>] Chrysostom strikingly says, “How can the “body become a<i> sacrifice</i>? let the eye look upon nothing evil, and it has become a sacrifice: let the tongue speak nothing shameful, and it has become an offering: let the hand do nothing unlawful, and it has become a burnt-offering. Nay, this is not sufficient, but we need the active practice of good,—the hand must do alms, the mouth must bless them that curse, the ear must give attention without ceasing to divine lessons. For a sacrifice hath nothing impure, a sacrifice is the firstfruit of other things. And let us therefore with our hands, and our feet, and our mouth, and all our other members, render firstfruits unto God.”<br><br><b> living</b>] In opposition to the<i> Levitical</i> sacrifices, which were<i> slain animals</i>. Our great sacrifice, the Lord Jesus, having been slain for us, and by the shedding of His Blood perfect remission having been obtained<i> by the mercies of God</i>, we are now enabled to be offered to God no longer by the shedding of blood, but as<i> living sacrifices.</i><br><br><b> your rational service</b>]<b> rational</b> is opposed to<i> carnal</i> or<i> fleshly</i>, see Heb. vii. 16, So Chrysostom, “having in it nothing corporeal, nothing gross, nothing subject to sense.” Theodoret and others take it as ‘<i>having reason,</i>’ opposed to sacrifices of animals which have no reason: Basil and Calvin, as opposed to superstitious. But the former meaning is far the best, and answers to the “<i>spiritual sacrifices</i>” of 1 Pet. ii. 5.
