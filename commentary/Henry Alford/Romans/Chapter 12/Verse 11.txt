<b> 11.</b>]<b> in diligence</b> (or, zeal: not ‘<i>business,</i>’ as A.V., which seems to refer it to the affairs of this life, whereas it relates, as all these in verses 11, 12, 13, to Christian duties<i> as such</i>: as ‘fervency of spirit,’ ‘acting as God’s servants,’ ‘rejoicing in hope,’&c.)<b> not slothful; in spirit, fervent</b> (this expression is used of Apollos in Acts xviii. 25. The Holy Spirit lights this fire within: see Luke xii. 49; Matt. iii, 11).<br><br><b> serving the Lord</b>] There is a remarkable variety in reading here. Some of our ancient MSS. here have<b> kairo</b>, “<i>time,</i>” instead of<b> kurio</b>, “<i>Lord,</i>” “<i>serving the time,</i>” or, “<i>the opportunity.</i>” But the weight of external authority is strongly in favour of the ordinary reading. The balance of internal probability, though not easy at once to settle, is I am persuaded on the same side. The main objection to the words, “<i>serving the Lord,</i>” has ever been, that thus the Apostle would be inserting here, among particular precepts, one of the most general and comprehensive character. But this will be removed, if we remember,<i> of what he is speaking:</i> and if I mistake not, the other reading has been defended partly owing to forgetfulness of this. The<i> present</i> subject is, the<i> character of our zeal</i><i> for God.</i> In it we are not to be<i> slothful</i>, but fervent in spirit,—and that, as<i> servants of God.</i> A very similar reminscence of this relation to God occurs Col. iii. 22–24. The command,<i> to be servants of the</i><i> time</i>, or<i> opportunity</i>, would surely come in. very inopportunely in the midst of exhortations to the<i> zealous service of God.</i> As to its applicability at all to Christians, De Wette well remarks, “The Christian may and should certainly<i> employ</i> (Eph. v. 16) time and opportunity, but not<i> serve</i> it.”
