<b> 14.</b>] “The Sermon on the Mount must have been particularly well known; for among the few references in the N.T. Epistles to the direct words of Christ there occur several to it: e.g. 1 Cor. vii. 10. James iv. 9; v. 12 (we may add iv. 3; i. 2, 22; ii. 5, 13; v. 2, 3, 10). 1 Pet, iii. 9, 14; iv. 14.” Tholuck.
