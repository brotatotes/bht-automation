<b> 16.</b>]<b> Having the same spirit towards one another</b>, i.e. actuated by a common and well-understood. feeling of mutual allowance and kindness,<br><br><b> condescending to men of low estate</b>] It is a question, whether this is the rendering, or whether it should not be “inclining unto the things that be lowly.” I have discussed the two in the note in my Greek Test., and found reason to uphold the rendering of the A.V. The other however is perfectly legitimate, and appears to suit better the former part of the sentence. But the Apostle’s antitheses do not require such minute correspondence as this. The sense then must decide. The insertion of the seemingly incongruous “<i>Be not wise in your own conceits</i>” is sufficiently accounted for by reference to ch. xi. 25, where he had stated this frame of mind as one to be avoided by those whose very place in God’s church was owing to His free mercy.<i> Being uplifted one against another</i> would be a sign of this fault being present and operative.
