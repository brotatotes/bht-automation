 16. ]  Having (the participial construction is resumed, as in Rom 12:9 )  the same spirit towards one another , i.e. actuated by a common and well-understood feeling of mutual allowance and kindness.
	 μὴ τὰ ὑψ .] It is a question, whether τοῖς ταπεινοῖς is neuter or masc. Certainly not  necessarily neuter , as De W.: the Apostle’s antitheses do not require such minute correspondence as this. The sense then must decide. In τὰ ὑψηλὰ φρονοῦντες , the ὑψηλά are necessarily  subjective , the  lofty thoughts of the man . But in τοῖς ταπεινοῖς συναπαγόμενοι the adj. is necessarily  objective ; some outward objects with which the persons exhorted are συναπάγεσθαι . And those outward objects are defined, if I mistake not, by the τὸ αὐτὸ  εἰς ἀλλήλους φρονοῦντες . This spirit towards one another is not to be a spirit of haughtiness, but one of community and sympathy,  condescending to men of low estate , as E. V. admirably renders it. For  συναπ ., see reff. and compare Zosimus, Hist. Romans 12:6 , cited by Tholuck, καὶ αὐτὴ ἡ Σπάρτη συναπήγετο τῇ κοινῇ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ἁλώσει . The insertion of the seemingly incongruous μὴ γίνεσθε … ἑαυτοῖς is sufficiently accounted for by reference to ch. Romans 11:25 , where he had stated this frame of mind as one to be avoided by those whose very place in God’s church was owing to His free mercy.  Being uplifted one against another would be a sign of this fault being present and operative.
