So Livy viii. 32, “Legati circumstantes sellam orabant, ut rem in posterum diem differret, et  irœ suæ spatium , et con-silio tempus,  daret .” So that we must not understand τῇ ὀργῇ , ‘  your anger,’ nor [exactly, though it comes to that,] ‘  God’s anger,’ but ‘  anger ,’ generally; ‘  give wrath room :’ ‘proceed not to execute it hastily, but leave it for its legitimate time, when He whose it is to avenge, will execute it: make not the wrath your own, but leave it for God.’ So in the main, but mostly understanding [exclusively] τ . ὀρ . τοῦ θεοῦ , Chrys., Aug [115] , Theodoret, and the great body of Commentators. Some Fathers interpret it, ‘  yield to the anger (  of your adversary );’ but this meaning for δότε τόπον is hardly borne out.

	The citation varies from the LXX, which has ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκδικήσεως ἀνταποδώσω ; and is nearer the Heb., לִי נָקָם וְשִׁלֵּם , “mine is revenge and requital.” It is very remarkable, that in Heb 10:30 the citation is made in the same words.
