<p><strong> ἀγαπητοί</strong> ] ‘The more difficult this duty, the more affectionately does the Apostle address his readers, with this word.’ Thol.

<p><strong> δότε τόπον</strong> ] <strong> allow space</strong> , i.e. ‘ <em> interpose delay</em> ,’ <strong> to anger</strong> . So Livy viii. 32, “Legati circumstantes sellam orabant, ut rem in posterum diem differret, et <em> irœ suæ spatium</em> , et con-silio tempus, <em> daret</em> .” So that we must not understand τῇ ὀργῇ , ‘ <em> your</em> anger,’ nor [exactly, though it comes to that,] ‘ <em> God’s</em> anger,’ but ‘ <em> anger</em> ,’ generally; ‘ <em> give wrath room</em> :’ ‘proceed not to execute it hastily, but leave it for its legitimate time, when He whose it is to avenge, will execute it: make not the wrath your own, but leave it for God.’ So in the main, but mostly understanding [exclusively] τ . ὀρ . τοῦ θεοῦ , Chrys., Aug [115] , Theodoret, and the great body of Commentators. Some Fathers interpret it, ‘ <em> yield to the anger</em> ( <em> of your adversary</em> );’ but this meaning for δότε τόπον is hardly borne out.

<p>The citation varies from the LXX, which has ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκδικήσεως ἀνταποδώσω ; and is nearer the Heb., לִי נָקָם וְשִׁלֵּם , “mine is revenge and requital.” It is very remarkable, that in Heb 10:30 the citation is made in the same words.</p>
