 2. ]  συνσχηματίζεσθαι is not Imperative in sense, but dependent on παρακαλῶ . (Of course, in all such questions betwen ε and αι , the confusing element of itacism comes in: but in no case where both forms are equally admissible in the text, can the mere suspicion of itacism be allowed to decide the question.)
	 ὁ αἰὼν οὗτος , here, the  whole world of the ungodly , as contrasted with the spiritual kingdom of Christ.
	The dat. ἀνακαινώσει is not the instrument by which, but the  manner in which the metamorphosis takes place: that wherein it consists: compare περιετμήθητε περιτομῇ ἀχειροποιήτῳ , Colossians 2:11 .
	 εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν  , that ye may prove , viz. in this process and the active Christian life accompanying it, compare reff. Eph., Phil.: not ‘  that ye may be able to prove ,’ ‘acquire the faculty of proving,’ as Bucer, Olsh., Rückert: the Apostle is not speaking of acquiring wisdom here, but of practical proof by experience.
	 τὸ ἀγαθ  .   κ  .   εὐάρ  .   κ  .   τέλ . are not epithets of τὸ θέλημα τ . θεοῦ as in E. V., for in that case they would be superfluous, and in part ( τέλειον ) inapplicable: but abstract neuters, see Romans 12:9 ,  that ye may prove what is the will of God (viz. that which is)  good and acceptable (to Him)  and perfect . The non-repetition of the art. shews that the adjectives all apply to the same thing.
