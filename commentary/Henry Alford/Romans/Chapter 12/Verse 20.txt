<b> 20.</b>]<b> Nay rather, if</b> is the reading of our three oldest MSS.; the<i> therefore</i> (A. V.) is very variously read and placed by the later ones.—<i>What is meant</i><i> by</i><b> thou shalt heap coals of fire?</b> The expression “<i>coals of fire</i>” occurs more than once in Ps. xviii., of the<i> divine punitive judgments.</i> Can those be meant here? Clearly not, in their bare literal sense. For however true it may be, that ingratitude will add to the enemy’s list of crimes, and so subject him more to God’s punitive judgment, it is impossible that to<i> bring this about</i> should be set as a precept, or a desirable thing among Christians. Again, can the expression be meant of the<i> glow and burn of shame</i> which would accompany, even in the case of a profane person, the receiving of benefits from an enemy? This<i> may</i> be meant; but is not probable, as not sufficing for the majesty of the subject. Merely to<i> make an enemy ashamed of himself,</i> can hardly be upheld as a motive for action. I understand the words, ‘<i>For in thus doing, you will be taking the most effectual vengeance:</i>” as effectual as if you heaped coals of fire on his head.
