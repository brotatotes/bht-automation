 20 .] The οὖν would mean ‘quod cum ita sit;’ carrying on the sentence with the assumption of the last thing stated. This perhaps may not have been understood, and hence may have arisen the alteration or omission of οὖν in the MSS. But the evidence is very strong for its omission.
	 What is meant by  ἄνθρακας πυρὸς σωρεύσεις ? The expression ἄνθρ . πυρ . occurs more than once in Psalms 18:0 , of the  divine punitive judgments . Can those be meant here? Clearly not, in their bare literal sense. For however true it may be, that ingratitude will add to the enemy’s list of crimes, and so subject him more to God’s punitive judgment, it is impossible that to  bring this about should be set as a precept, or a desirable thing among Christians. Again, can the expression be meant of the  glow and burn of shame which would accompany, even in the case of a profane person, the receiving of benefits from an enemy? This  may be meant; but is not probable, as not sufficing for the majesty of the subject. Merely to  make an enemy ashamed of himself , can hardly be upheld as a motive for action. I understand the words, ‘  For in this doing, you will be taking the most effectual vengeance ;’ as effectual as if you heaped coals of fire on his head.
