 3.]<b> I say</b>, a mild expression for ‘I command;’ enforced<i> as</i> a command by the following words,<b> through the grace given to me</b>, i.e. ‘by means of my apostolic office,’ of the grace conferred on me to guide and exhort the church:’ reff.<br><br><b> to every man that is among you</b>,—a strong bringing out of the<i> individual</i> application of the precept. “He says it not to this person or that person only, but to ruler and ruled, to bond and free, to simple and wise, to woman and man.” Chrysostom.<br><br><b> not to be highminded, &c.</b>] There is a play on the words here in the original, which can only be clumsily conveyed in another language: ‘not to be high-minded, above that which he ought to be minded, but to be so minded, as to be sober-minded.’<b> His measure of faith</b> is his<i> receptivity</i> of graces of the Spirit, itself no inherent congruity, but the gift and apportionment of God. It is in fact the<i> subjective designation of the grace which is given us,</i> verse 6. But we must not say, with Ewbank, that “faith, in this passage, means<i> those gifts or graces which the Christian can only receive through faith:</i>” this is to confound the receptive faculty with the thing received by it, and to pass by the great lesson of our verse, that<i> this faculty</i> is nothing to be proud of, but God’s gift.
