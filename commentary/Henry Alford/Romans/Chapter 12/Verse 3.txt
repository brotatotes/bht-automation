	 παντὶ τῷ ὄντι ἐν ὑμ ., a strong bringing out of the  individual application of the precept. οὐχὶ τῷ δεῖνι καὶ τῷ δεῖνι μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄρχοντι κ . ἀρχομένῳ , κ . δούλῳ κ . ἐλευθέρῳ , κ . ἰδιώτῃ κ . σοφῷ , κ . γυναικὶ κ . ἀνδρί , κ . νέῳ κ . γέροντι . Chrys. Hom. xx. p. 603.
	 μὴ ὑπερφρ . κ . τ . λ .] There is a play on the words φρονεῖν , ὑπερφρονεῖν , and σωφρονεῖν , which can only be clumsily conveyed in another language: ‘not to be highminded, above that which he ought to be minded, but to be so minded, as to be soberminded.’ Wetst. quotes from Charondas in Stobæus, Sentent. xlii., προσποιείσθω δὲ ἕκαστος τῶν πολιτῶν σωφρονεῖν μᾶλλον ἢ φρονεῖον , and from Thucyd. ii. 62, ἰέναι δὲ τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ὁμόσε , μὴ φρονήματι μόνον , ἀλλὰ καὶ καταφρονήματι .

But we must not say, that (Ewb.) “faith, in this passage, means  those gifts or graces which the Christian can only receive through faith :” this is to confound the receptive faculty with the thing received by it, and to pass by the great lesson of our verse, that  this faculty is nothing to be proud of, but God’s gift.
