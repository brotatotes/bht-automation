<b> 6.</b>] The<b> and</b> is more than a mere copula: ‘and not only so, but’....<b> grace</b>, see above ver. 3, on the “<i>measure of faith.</i>” These<b> gifts</b> are called, 1 Cor. xii. 7, “<i>the manifestation of the Spirit.</i>” On<b> prophecy,</b> see note, Acts xi. 27.<br><br> [<b>let us prophesy</b>]<b> according to the proportion of faith</b>] But<i> what</i> faith?<i> Objective</i> ( ‘faith<i> which is believed</i>’), or<i> subjective</i> ( ‘faith<i> by which we believe</i>’)?<i> the</i> faith, or<i> our</i> faith? The comparison of “<i>the measure of faith</i>” above, and the whole context, determine it to be the latter; the measure of<i> our</i> faith: ‘let each contain himself within the limits of his own lot, and keep the measure of his revelation, and let not one seem to himself to know all things.’ To understand the words objectively, as ‘the rule of faith,’ as many R.-Cath. expositors, and some Protestant, e.g. Calvin, seems to do violence to the context, which aims at shewing that the measure of faith, itself the gift of God, is the receptive faculty for all spiritual gifts, which are therefore not to be boasted of, nor pushed beyond their provinces, but humbly exercised within their own limits.
