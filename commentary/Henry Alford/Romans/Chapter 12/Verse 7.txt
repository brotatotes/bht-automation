 7.   διακονίαν ]  any subordinate ministration in the Church . In Acts 6:1 ; Acts 6:4 , we have the word applied both to the lower ministration, that of alms and food, and to the higher, the διακ . τοῦ λόγου , which belonged to the Apostles. But here it seems to be used in a more restricted sense, from its position as distinct from prophecy, teaching, exhortation, &c.
	 ἐν τῇ διακ .] Let us confine ourselves humbly and orderly to that kind of ministration to which God’s providence has appointed us, as profitable members of the body.
	 ὁ διδάσκων ] The  prophet spoke under  immediate inspiration ; the διδάσκαλος under inspiration working by the secondary instruments of his will and reason and rhetorical powers. Paul himself seems ordinarily, in his personal ministrations, to have used διδασκαλία . He is nowhere called a  prophet , but appears as distinguished from them in several places: e.g. Acts 11:27 ; Acts 21:10 , and apparently Romans 13:1 . Of course this does not affect the appearance of  prophecies , commonly so called; in his writings. The inspired διδάσκαλος would speak, though not technically προφητείας , yet the mind of the Spirit in all things: not to mention that the apostolic office was one in dignity and fulness of inspiration far surpassing any of the subordinate ones, and in fact including them all.
	 ἐν τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ ] as before: he is to teach in the sphere, within the bounds, of the teaching allotted to him by God, or for which God has given him the faculty.
