<b> 7. ministry</b>]<i> any subordinate ministration in the Church.</i> In Acts vi. 1 and 4, we have the word applied both to the lower ministration, that of alms and food, and to the higher, the<i> ministry of the word</i>, which belonged to the Apostles. But here it seems to be used in a more restricted sense, from its position as distinct from prophecy, teaching, exhortation, &c.<br><br><b> in our ministry</b>] Let us confine ourselves humbly and orderly to that kind of ministration to which God’s providence has appointed us, as profitable members of the body.<br><br><b> he that teacheth</b>] The<i> prophet</i> spoke under<i> immediate inspiration; the teacher</i> under inspiration working by the secondary instruments of his will and reason and rhetorical powers. Paul himself seems ordinarily, in his personal ministrations, to have used<i> teaching</i>. He is nowhere called one of the<i> prophets</i>, but appears as distinguished from them in several places: e.g. Acts xi. 27; xxi. 10, and apparently xiii. 1. Of course this does not affect the appearance of<i> prophecies</i>, commonly so called, in his writings. The inspired<i> teacher</i> would speak, though not technically<i> prophecies</i>, yet the mind of the Spirit in all things: not to mention that the apostolic office was one in dignity and fulness of inspiration far surpassing any of the subordinate ones, and in fact including them all.<br><br><b> in his teaching</b>] as before: he is to teach in the sphere, within the bounds, of the teaching allotted to him by God,—or for which God has given faculty.
