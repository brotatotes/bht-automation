<b> 8.</b>] The<b> exhorter</b> was not necessarily distinct from the<i> prophesier,</i>—see 1 Cor. xiv. 31.<br><br><b> he that giveth</b> appears to be the<i> giver of the alms to the poor</i>,—either the deacon himself, or some distributor subordinate to the deacon. This however has been doubted, and not without reason: for a transition certainly seems to be made, by the omission of the “<i>or,</i>” from<i> public</i> to<i> private</i> gifts. We cannot find any ecclesiastical meaning for<b> sheweth mercy</b> (though indeed Calvin and others understand by it, “widows and others who, according to the ancient custom of the Church, were appointed over ministrations to the sick’’),—and the very fact of the three preceding being all limited to their respective official spheres, whereas these three are connected with qualitative descriptions, speaks strongly for their being<i> private acts,</i> to be always performed<i> in the spirit</i> described. On the rendering the original word<b> liberality</b>, and not<i> simplicity</i>, see note in my Greck Test.<br><br><b> He that ruleth</b> or<b> presideth</b>—but over what? If over<i> the Church</i> exclusively, we come back to<i> offices</i> again: and it is hardly likely that the rulers of the Church, as such, would be introduced so low down in the list, or by so very general a term, as this. In 1 Tim. iii. 4, 5, 12, we have the verb used of<i> presiding over a man’s own household:</i> and in its absolute usage here, I do not see why that also should not be included.<br><br><b> with diligence</b>] implying that he who is by God set over others, be they members of the Church or of his own household, must not allow himself to forget his responsibility, and take his duty indolently and easily, but must rule with earnestness, making it a serious matter of continual diligence.<br><br><b> he that sheweth mercy</b>] This is the very best rendering: and I cannot conceive that any<i> officer of the Church</i> is intended, but every private Christian who exercises compassion. It is in exhibiting compassion, which is often the compulsory work of one obeying his conscience rather than the spontaneous effusion of love, that<i> cheerfulness</i> is so peculiarly required, and so frequently wanting. And yet in such an act it is even of more consequence towards the effect,—consoling the compassionated, than the act itself. “<i>A word is better than a gifts</i>,” Ecclus. xviii. 16.
