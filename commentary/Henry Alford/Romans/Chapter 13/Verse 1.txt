<b> 1.</b>]<b> submit himself</b>, i.e. ‘be subject of his own free will and accord.’—<b>For there is no authority</b> (in heaven or earth—no power at all)<b> except from God: those</b><b> that be</b> (the existing powers which we see about us),<b> have been ordained by God.</b> We may observe that the Apostle here pays no regard to the question of the duty of Christians in revolutionary movements. His precepts regard an<i> established power</i>, be it what it may.<i> It</i>, in all matters lawful,<i> we are bound to obey.</i> But even the parental power does not extend to things unlawful. If the civil power commands us to violate the law of God, we must obey God before man. If it commands us to disobey the common laws of humanity, or the sacred institutions of our country, our obedience is due to the higher and more general law, rather than to the lower and particular. These distinctions must be drawn by the wisdom granted to Christians in the varying circumstances of human affairs: they are all only subordinate portions of the great duty of<i> obedience</i><i> to</i> LAW. To obtain, by lawful means, the removal or alteration of an unjust or unreasonable law, is another part of this duty: for all authorities among men must be in accord with the highest authority, the moral sense. But even where law is hard and unreasonable, not<i> disobedience,</i> but<i> legitimate protest,</i> is the duty of the Christian.
