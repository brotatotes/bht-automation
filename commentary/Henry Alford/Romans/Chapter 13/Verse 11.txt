The imagery seems to be taken originally from our Lord’s discourse concerning His coming: see Matt. xxiv. 42; Mark xiii. 33, and Luke xxi. 28–36, where several points of similarity to our verses 11–14 occur.<br><br><b> salvation</b>] as “<i>your redemption,</i>” Luke xxi, 28, and ch. viii. 23, is said of the<i> accomplishment of salvation.</i>—Without denying the legitimacy of an individual application of this truth, and the importance of its consideration for all Christians of all ages, a fair exposition of this passage can hardly fail to recognize the fact, that the Apostle here as well as elsewhere (1 Thess. iv. 17; 1 Cor. xv. 51), speaks of the coming of the Lord as<i> rapidly approaching.</i> Prof. Stuart and others are shocked at the idea, as being inconsistent with the inspiration of his writings. How this can be, I am at a loss to imagine. “OF THAT DAY AND HOUR KNOWETH NO MAN, NO NOT THE ANGELS IN HEAVEN, NOR EVEN THE SON, BUT THE FATHER,” Mk. xiii. 32.—And to reason, as Stuart does, that because St. Paul corrects in 2 Thess. ii, the mistake of imaging it to be<i> immediately at hand</i> (or even<i> actually come,</i> see note there), therefore he did not himself expect it soon, is surely quite beside the purpose. The fact, that the nearness or distance of that day was<i> unknown to the Apostles,</i> in no way affects the prophetic announcements of God’s Spirit by them, concerning its preceding and accompanying circumstances. The ‘<i>day and hour</i>’ formed no part of their inspiration;—<i>the details of the event, did.</i> And this distinction has singularly and providentially turned out to the edification of all subsequent ages. While the prophetic declarations of the events of that time remain to instruct us, the<i> eager expectation</i> of the time, which<i> they expressed in their day</i>, has also remained, a token of the true frame of mind in which each succeeding age (and each succeeding age more strongly than the last) should contemplate the ever-approaching coming of the Lord. On the<i> certainty of the event,</i> our faith is grounded: by the<i> uncertainty of the time</i> our hope is stimulated, and our watchfulness aroused.
