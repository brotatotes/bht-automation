<p><strong> 8.</strong> ] <strong> ὀφείλετε</strong> is not indic. (as Koppe, Reiche, al.), which would require οὐδενὶ οὐδέν , and would be inconsistent with the ὀφειλαί just mentioned, but imperative: ‘ <em> Pay</em> all other debts: <em> be indebted</em> in the matter of love <em> alone</em> .’ This debt increases the more, the more it is paid: because the practice of love makes the principle of love deeper and more active. Aug [116] , Ep. 192 (62), ad Cœlest. vol. ii. p. 868, says: “Redditur enim (caritas), cum impenditur, debetur autem etiam si reddita fuerit; quia nullum est tempus quando impendenda jam non sit. Nec cum redditur amittitur, sed potius reddendo multiplicatur.”
