 8. ]  ὀφείλετε is not indic. (as Koppe, Reiche, al.), which would require οὐδενὶ οὐδέν , and would be inconsistent with the ὀφειλαί just mentioned, but imperative: ‘  Pay all other debts:  be indebted in the matter of love  alone .’ This debt increases the more, the more it is paid: because the practice of love makes the principle of love deeper and more active. Aug [116] , Ep. 192 (62), ad Cœlest. vol. ii. p. 868, says: “Redditur enim (caritas), cum impenditur, debetur autem etiam si reddita fuerit; quia nullum est tempus quando impendenda jam non sit. Nec cum redditur amittitur, sed potius reddendo multiplicatur.”

	 πεπλήρωκεν  , hath (in the act)  fulfilled : compare the perfects, John 3:18 ; ch. Romans 14:23 .  νόμον is not the Christian law, but  the Mosaic law of the decalogue. “This recommendation of Love has, as also the similar one, Galatians 5:23 , κατὰ τῶν τοιούτων οὐκ ἔστιν νόμος , an apologetic reference to the upholders of the law, and depends on this evident axiom, ‘He who practises Love,  the higher duty , has, even before he does this, fulfilled the law,  the lower .’ ” De Wette.
