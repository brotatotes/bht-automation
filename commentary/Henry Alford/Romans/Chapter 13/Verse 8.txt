<b> 8.</b>] ‘<i>Pay</i> all other debts:<i> be indebted</i> in the matter of love<i> alone.</i>’ This debt increases the more, the more it is paid: because the practice of love makes the principle of love deeper and more active. By the word<b> law</b> is meant, not the Christian law, but<i> the Mosaic law</i> of the decalogue. “He who practises Love,<i> the higher duty,</i> has, even before he does this, fulfilled the law,<i> the</i><i> lower.”</i> De Wette.
