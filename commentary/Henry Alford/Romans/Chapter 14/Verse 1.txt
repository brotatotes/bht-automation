<b> CHAP. XIV. 1–XV. 13.</b>] ON THE CONDUCT TO BE PURSUED TOWARDS WEAK AND SCRUPULOUS BRETHREN.—There is some doubt who the<b> weak in faith</b> were, of whom the Apostle here treats; whether they were<i> ascetics, or Judaizers.</i> Some habits mentioned, as e.g. the abstinence from<i> all meats,</i> and from<i> wine,</i> seem to indicate the former: whereas the<i> observation of days,</i> and the use of such expressions as “<i>unclean,</i>” ver. 14, and again the argument of ch. xv. 7–13, as plainly point to the latter. The difficulty may be solved by a proper combination of the two views. The over-scrupulous Jew<i> became an ascetic by compulsion</i>. He was afraid of pollution by eating meats sacrificed or wine poured to idols: or even by being brought into contact, in foreign countries, with casual and undiscoverable uncleanness, which in his. own land he knew the articles offered for food would be sure not to have incurred. He therefore abstained from<i> all prepared food</i>, and confined himself to that which he could trace from natural growth to his own use. We have examples of this in Daniel (Dan. i.), Tobit (Tob. i. 10, 11), and in some Jewish priests mentioned by Josephus, who having been sent prisoners to Rome, “did not forget their piety towards God, but lived on figs and walnuts.” And Tholuck refers to the Mishna as containing precepts to this effect. All difficulty then is removed, by supposing that of these over-scrupulous Jews some had become converts to the gospel, and with neither the obstinacy of legal Judaizers, nor the pride of ascetics (for these are not hinted at here), but in<i> weakness of faith</i>, and the scruples of an over-tender conscience, retained their habits of abstinence and observation of days. Ou this account the Apostle characterizes and treats them mildly: not with the severity which he employs towards the Colossian Judaizing ascetics, and those mentioned in 1 Tim. iv. 1 ff.—The question treated in 1 Cor. viii. was somewhat different: there it was, concerning meat<i> actually offered</i> to an idol. In 1 Cor. x. 25–27, he touches the same question as here, and decides against the stricter view.<br><br><b> 1.</b>]<i> The general duty of a reconciling and uncontroversial spirit towards the weak in faith.</i>—In the original this verse is connected with the last by the particle “<i>but:</i>’ and it is thus bound on to the<i> general</i> exhortations to mutual charity in ch. xiii.: as if it had been said, ‘in the particular case of the weak in faith,’&c.: but also implies a contrast, which seems to be, in allusion to the Christian perfection enjoined in the preceding verses,— ‘but do not let your own realization of your state as children of light make you intolerant of shortcoming and infirmity in others.’ The particular weakness consisted in a want of broad and independent principle, and a consequent bondage to prejudices.<br><br><b> faith</b> therefore is used in a general sense, to indicate the moral soundness conferred by faith,—the whole character of the Christian’s conscience and practice, resting on faith.<br><br><b> weak in the faith</b> imports holding THE FAITH imperfectly, i.e. not being able to receive the faith in its strength, so as to be above such prejudices.<br><br><b> receive ye</b>] ‘<i>give him your hand,</i>’ as the old Syriac Version renders it: ‘count him one of you:’ so far from rejecting or discouraging him.<br><br> [<b>yet</b>]<b> not for</b>] i.e.<b> but not with a view to:</b> ‘do not adopt him as a brother, in order then to begin’...<br><br><b> deciding of doubts</b>] literally,<b> discernments of thoughts</b>, i.e. ‘<i>disputes in order to settle the points on which he has scruples.</i>’ Namely,<i> those scruples</i> in which his weakness consists,—and<i> those more enlightened views in you</i>, by which you would fain remove his scruples. Do not let your association of him among you be<i> with a view to settle these disputes.</i>
