The mere grieving your brother, is an offence against<i> love:</i> how much greater an offence then, if this<i> grieving</i> end in<i> destroying</i>—in ruining (causing to act against his conscience, and so to commit sin and be in danger of quenching God’s Spirit within him) by a MEAL of thine, a brother, for whom Christ died! “Value not thy meat more than Christ valued His life.” Bengel. See an exact parallel in 1 Cor. viii. 10.
