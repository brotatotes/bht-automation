 18. ] The reading τούτῳ is too strongly supported to be rejected for the rec. τούτοις , as is done by Thol. and De Wette, because the latter is the  easier reading, and might refer to δικ . εἰρ . and χαρ . I have therefore adopted it. But I do not understand it (as Orig [122] , al.) of πνεύματι ἁγίῳ . It would be unnatural that a subordinate member of the former sentence, belonging only to χαρά , should be at once raised to be the emphatic one in this, and the three graces just emphatically mentioned, lost sight of. I believe τούτῳ to express the aggregate of the three, and ἐν τούτῳ to be equivalent to οὕτως , as Baumg.-Crusius.
