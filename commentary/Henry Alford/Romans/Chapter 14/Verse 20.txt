<p><strong> 20.</strong> ] <strong> τὸ ἔργον τ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θεοῦ</strong> has been variously understood: by Fritz. and Baumg.-Crusius, as = δικαιος . εἰρήνη , κ . χαρά : by Meyer and Krehl, as = <em> the Christian status of the offended brother</em> , so as to be parallel to <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span> ; by Theodoret and Reiche, as = <em> the faith of thy fellow-Christian</em> : by Morus, Rosenm., al., as = ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θ ., ‘ <em> the spread of the Gospel</em> .’ But I believe the expression οἰκοδομή having just preceded is the clue to the right meaning: and that τὸ ἔργον = τὴν οἰκοδομήν in the Apostle’s mind. He calls Christians in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span> , θεοῦ γεώργιον , θεοῦ οἰκοδομή . Thus it will mean, <em> thy fellow-Christian, as a plant of God’s planting, a building of God’s raising</em> . So, nearly, De Wette and Tholuck. <strong> All things indeed are pure, but</strong> (it is) <strong> evil to the man</strong> (‘there is criminality in the man;’ Meyer supplies τὸ καθαρόν , Grot. τὸ βρῶμα , Fritz. τὸ πάντα φαγεῖν : but nothing need be supplied, any more than to καλόν ) <strong> who eats with offence</strong> (i.e. <em> giving</em> offence to his weak brother, as Theodoret, Calv., Beza, Grot., Estius, Bengel, Thol., De Wette, al. That this is the right interpretation is shewn by the sentence standing between two others <em> both addressed to the strong who is in danger of offending the weak</em> . But Chrys., Theophyl., Œc [123] , Meyer, al., take the sense of ‘ <em> receiving</em> offence,’ and understand it of the <em> weak</em> ).
