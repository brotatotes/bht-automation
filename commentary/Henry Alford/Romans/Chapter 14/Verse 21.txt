<b> 21.</b>]<b> It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor</b> [to do]<b> any thing</b> (the Apostle, as so often, is deducing a general duty from the particular subject)<b> wherein</b> (in the matter of which)<b> thy brother stumbleth, or is offended</b> (see on ver. 13)<b>, or is weak</b> (Tholuck remarks that the three verbs form a gradual<i> anti-climax</i> from greater to less; “stumbleth, or even is offended, or even is weak”).<br><br><b> 22. The faith which thou</b><b> hast, have [it] to thyself before God</b>] ‘<i>Before God,</i>’—because He is the object of faith: hardly, as Erasmus, “because he wishes to repress the vain-glory which usually accompanies knowledge,”—for there is<i> no trace of a depreciation</i> of the strong in faith in the chapter,—only a<i> caution as to their conduct</i> in regard of their weaker brethren.—With the word<b> Blessed</b> begins the closing and general sentence of the Apostle with regard to<i> both:</i> it is a blessed thing to<i> have no scruples</i> (the<i> strong in faith</i> is in a situation to be envied) about things in which we allow ourselves (Olshausen refers to the addition in one of our ancient MSS. at Luke vi. 4,—where our Lord is related to have seen a man tilling his land on the Sabbath, and to have said to him, “<i>If thou knowest what thou art doing, blessed art thou; but if thou knowest not, thou art cursed, and a transgressor of the law</i>”).<b> But he that doubteth</b> (he that is not in that situation)<b> incurs condemnation by eating</b> (the case in point is here particularized),<b> because</b> [<b>he eateth</b>]<b> not of faith</b> (i. e. as before, from a<i> persuasion of rectitude</i> grounded on and consonant with his lite of faith. That ‘<i>faith in the Son of God</i>’ by which the Apostle describes his own life in the flesh as being lived (Gal. ii. 20), informing and penetrating the motives and the conscience, will not include, will not sanetion, an act done against the testimony of the conscience)<b>: but</b> (introducing an<i> axiom,</i> as Heb. viii. 13)<b> whatsoever is not of</b> (grounded in, and therefore consonant with)<b> faith</b> (the great element in which the Christian lives and moves and desires and hopes)<b>, is sin.</b>—Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and others, have taken this text as shewing that “the whole life of unbelievers is sin.” Whether that be the case or not, cannot be determined from this passage, any more than from Heb. xi. 6,<i> because neither here nor there is the unbeliever in question.</i> Here the Apostle has in view<i> two Christians</i>, both living by faith, and by faith doing acts pleasing to God:—and he reminds them that whatever they do<i> out of harmony</i> with this great principle of their spiritual lives, belongs to the category of sin. In Heb. xi. he is speaking of one who had the testimony of having (eminently) pleased God: this, he says, he did by faith; for<i> without faith</i> it is impossible to please Him. The question touching the<i> unbeliever</i> must be settled by another enquiry: Can he whom we thus name<i> have faith,</i>—such a faith as may enable him to do acts which are not sinful? a question impossible for<i> us</i> to solve.
