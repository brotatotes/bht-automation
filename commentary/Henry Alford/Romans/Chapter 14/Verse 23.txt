 23. ]  but he that doubteth (the situation just described  not being his),  incurs condemnation if he eat (the case in point particularized),  because (he eats)  not from faith (i.e. as before, see Chrys. above, from a  persuasion of rectitude grounded on and consonant with his life of faith. That ‘  faith in the Son of God ’ by which the Apostle describes his own life in the flesh as being lived ( Gal 2:20 ), informing and penetrating the motives and the conscience, will not include, will not sanction, an act done against the testimony of the conscience):  but (introducing an  axiom , as Heb 8:13 )  all that is not from (grounded in, and therefore consonant with)  faith (the great element in which the Christian lives and moves and desires and hopes),  is sin . Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, al., have taken this text as shewing that ‘omnis infidelium vita peccatum est.’ Whether that be the case or not, cannot be determined from this passage, any more than from Hebrews 11:6 , because  neither here nor there is the ‘infidelis’  in question . Here the Apostle has in view  two Christians , both living by faith, and by faith doing acts pleasing to God: and he reminds them that whatever they do  out of harmony with this great principle of their spiritual lives, belongs to the category of sin. In Hebrews 11:0 the Writer is speaking of one who had the testimony of having (eminently) pleased God: this, he says, he did by faith; for  without faith it is impossible to please Him. The question touching the ‘infidelis,’ must be settled by another enquiry: Can he whom we thus name  have faith , such a faith as may enable him to do acts which are not sinful? a question impossible for  us to solve.
