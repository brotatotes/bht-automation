<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] <strong> Who art thou</strong> (see ch. Rom 9:20 ) <strong> that judgest the servant of another</strong> (viz. as De W., of <em> Christ</em> , for a κύριος in this passage is marked, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:8-9">Romans 14:8-9</span> , as being Christ, and the Master is the same throughout. ὁ θεός before is unconnected with this verse)? <strong> to his own Master</strong> (dat. commodi or incommodi according as στ . or πίπτ . befalls: ‘it is his own master’s matter, and his alone, that’) <strong> he stands</strong> (‘remains in the place and estimation of a Christian, from which thou wouldest eject him;’ not, as Calv., Grot., Estius, Wolf, al., ‘stands hereafter in the judgment,’ which is not in question here: see 1Co 10:12 ) <strong> or falls</strong> (from his place, see above): <strong> but he shall be made to stand</strong> (notwithstanding thy doubts of the correctness of his practice): <strong> for the Lord</strong> (or, <em> his Lord</em> , in allusion to τῷ ἰδίῳ κυρίῳ above) <strong> is able to make him stand</strong> (in faith and practice. These last words are inapplicable, if standing and falling at the great day are meant). Notice, this argument is entirely directed <em> to</em> the <em> weak</em> , who uncharitably judges the <em> strong</em> , not vice versâ. The <em> weak</em> imagines that the <em> strong</em> cannot be a true servant of God, nor retain his steadfastness amidst such temptation. To this the Apostle answers, (1) that <em> such judgment belongs only to Christ, whose servant he is</em> : (2) that <em> the Lord’s Almighty Power is able to keep him up, and will do so</em> .</p>
