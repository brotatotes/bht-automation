 4. ]  Who art thou (see ch. Rom 9:20 )  that judgest the servant of another (viz. as De W., of  Christ , for a κύριος in this passage is marked, Romans 14:8-9 , as being Christ, and the Master is the same throughout. ὁ θεός before is unconnected with this verse)?  to his own Master (dat. commodi or incommodi according as στ . or πίπτ . befalls: ‘it is his own master’s matter, and his alone, that’)  he stands (‘remains in the place and estimation of a Christian, from which thou wouldest eject him;’ not, as Calv., Grot., Estius, Wolf, al., ‘stands hereafter in the judgment,’ which is not in question here: see 1Co 10:12 )  or falls (from his place, see above):  but he shall be made to stand (notwithstanding thy doubts of the correctness of his practice):  for the Lord (or,  his Lord , in allusion to τῷ ἰδίῳ κυρίῳ above)  is able to make him stand (in faith and practice. These last words are inapplicable, if standing and falling at the great day are meant). Notice, this argument is entirely directed  to the  weak , who uncharitably judges the  strong , not vice versâ. The  weak imagines that the  strong cannot be a true servant of God, nor retain his steadfastness amidst such temptation. To this the Apostle answers, (1) that  such judgment belongs only to Christ, whose servant he is : (2) that  the Lord’s Almighty Power is able to keep him up, and will do so .
