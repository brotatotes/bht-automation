<b> 4.</b>]<b> Who art thou</b> (see ch. ix. 20)<b> that judgest the servant of another</b> (viz. of<i> Christ,</i>—for<b> the lord</b> in this passage is marked, verses 8, 9, as being Chirst,—and the Master is the same throughout. “<i>God,</i>” mentioned before, is unconnected with this verse)<b>?</b><b> to his own lord</b> (i. e. ‘it i own master’s matter, and his alone, that’)<b> he standeth</b> (remains in the place and estimation of a Christian, from which thou wouldest eject him;’ not, ‘stands hereafter in the judgment,’ which is not in question here: see 1 Cor. x. 12)<b> or falleth</b> (from his place, see above).<b> But he shall be made to stand</b> (notwithstanding thy doubts of the correctness of his practice)<b>: for the Lord</b> (or,<i> his Lord,</i> in allusion to the words “<i>to his own Lord</i>” above)<b> is able to make him stand</b> (in faith and practice. These last words are inapplicable, if standing and falling at the great day are meant).—Notice, this argument is entirely directed<i> to</i> the<i> weak</i>, who uncharitably judges the<i> strong</i>,—not vice versâ The<i> weak</i> imagines that the<i> strong</i> cannot be a true servant of God, nor, retain his amidst such temptation. To this the Apostle answers, (1)<i> that such judgment belongs only to Christ, whose servant he is:</i> (2)<i> that the Lord’s almighty Power is able to keep him up, and will do so.</i>
