	The  present Heb. text of Deu 32:43 will not bear this, which is the LXX rendering. But Tholuck remarks, “According to the present text the difficulty arises, that we must either take גּוֹיִם of the Jewish tribes, or construe הִרְנִין with an accus., instead of with לְ (Gesen.): the reading of the LXX may therefore be right.” There is however a reading אֶת־עַמּוֹ found in one and perhaps another of Kennicott’s MSS. which will bear the rendering of our text. In several passages where the Gentiles are spoken of prophetically, the Hebrew text has apparently been tampered with by the Jews.
