<b> 16.</b>]<b> ministering as a priest in the gospel of God</b> (the Apostle is using a figure in which be compares himself to a priest, and the Gentiles to the sacrifice which he was offering: see below),<b> that the offering up of the Gentiles</b> (genitive of apposition:<i> the Gentiles themselves are the offering</i>; so Theophylact, “This is my priesthood, to preach the Gospel. My knife is the word, ye are the sacrifice”)<b> may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Ghost.</b>—The language is evidently figurative,<b> and can</b> by no possibility be taken as a sanction for any view of the Christian minister as a<i> sacrificing priest</i>, otherwise than<i> according to that figure</i>—viz. that he offers to God<i> the acceptable sacrifice of those who by his means believe on Christ</i>.
