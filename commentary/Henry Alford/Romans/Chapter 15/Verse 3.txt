 3. ] ἐξῆν αὐτῷ μὴ ὀνειδισθῆναι , ἐξῆν μὴ παθεῖν ἅπερ ἔπαθεν , εἴγε ἤθελε τὸ ἑαυτοῦ σκοπεῖν · ἀλλ ʼ ὅμως οὐκ ἠθέλησεν , ἀλλὰ τὸ ἡμέτερον σκοπήσας τὸ ἑαυτοῦ παρεῖδε , Chrys. Hom. xxvii. p. 721
	The citation is made  directly , without any thing to introduce the formula citandi, as in ch. Romans 9:7 , where even the formula itself is wanting: there is no ellipsis. The words in the Messianic Psalm are addressed to  the Father , not to those  for whom Christ suffered: but they prove all that is here required, that He did not please  Himself ; His sufferings were undertaken on account of the Father’s good purpose mere work which  He gave Him to do .
