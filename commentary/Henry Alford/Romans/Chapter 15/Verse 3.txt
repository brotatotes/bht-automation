<b> 3. Christ pleased not himself</b>] for, “He might have escaped reproach, He might have avoided suffering what He did, if He had consulted His own pleasure: howbeit He willed not thus, but looking at our good, He overlooked His own pleasure,” Chrysostom. The words in the Messianic Psalm are addressed to<i> the Father,</i> not to those<i> for whom</i> Christ suffered: but they prove all that is here required, that He did not please<i> Himself;</i> His sufferings were undertaken on account of the Father’s good purpose—mere work which<i> He gave Him to do.</i>
