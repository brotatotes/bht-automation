<b> 7.</b>]<b> Wherefore</b> (on which account, viz. that. the wish of the last verse may be accomplished)<b> receive ye</b> (see ch. xiv. 1)<b> one another, as Christ also received you,—to the glory of God</b> (i. e.<b> with a view to God’s glory</b>). That this is the meaning, “that the Gentiles<i> glorify God</i> for His mercy,” appears by ver. 9. The Apostle does not expressly name<i> Jewish and Gentile converts</i> as those to whom he addresses this exhortation, but it is evident from the next verse that it is so.
