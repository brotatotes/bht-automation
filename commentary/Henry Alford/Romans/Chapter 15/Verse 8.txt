It can hardly be that the usual historical aorist γενέσθαι (see var. readd.) was altered to the unusual perfect γεγενῆσθαι . The tendency of correction was entirely the other way)  a minister (He came διακονῆσαι , Mat 20:28 )  of the circumcision (an expression no where else found, and doubtless here used by Paul to humble the pride of the  strong , the Gentile Christians, by exalting God’s covenant people to their true dignity)  on account of the truth of God (i.e. for the fulfilment of the Divine pledges given under the covenant of circumcision)  to confirm the promises of (  made to , gen. obj.; cf. ἡ εὐλογία τοῦ Ἀβραάμ , Gal 3:14 )  the fathers (i.e. Christ came to the  Jews in virtue of a  long-sealed compact, to the fulfilment of which God’s truth was pledged ):  but (I say)  that the Gentiles glorified God (or ‘should glorify God:’ Winer, in his former editions, § 45. 8, took it as a perfect, and co-ordinate with γεγενῆσθαι : I would regard it (and so, apparently, Winer now, edn. 6, § 44. 7. c) as the historic aorist, and understand ‘  each man at his conversion .’ Least of all can it be subordinated to εἰς τό , as is done in E.

It is adduced to shew that among the Gentiles Christ’s triumphs were to take place, as well as among the Jews.
