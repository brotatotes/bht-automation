<b> 10.</b>]<b> approved</b> (by trial)<b> in</b> (the work of)<b> Christ</b>.—It does not follow that either Aristobulus or Narcissus were<i> themselves Christians</i>. Only those of their<i> families</i> are here saluted who were<b> in the Lord</b>: for<b> we</b> must understand this also in the<b> case</b> of Aristobulus’ household: see above.{11}Grotius, Neander, and others, have taken Narcissus for the well-known freediman of Claudius. But this can hardly be, for he was executed in the very beginning of Nero’s reign, i.e. about 55 A.D., whereas (see Introduction,§iv. 4, and Chronol. Table) this Epistle cannot have well been written before 58 A.D. Perhaps the family of this Narcissus may have continued to be thus known after his death.
