<b> 20.</b>] “Seeing that he had mentioned those who caused divisions and offences, he says<b> the God of peace</b> that he might encourage them to expect liberation from these persons.” Chrysostom: and so most Commentators. De Wette prefers taking<b> the God of peace</b> more generally. as ‘the God of<i> salvation</i>,’ and the usage of the expression (see references) seems to favour this.<b> shall bruise Satan</b> is a similitude from Gen. iii. 15. It does not express any<i> wish</i>, but a prophetic assurance, and encouragement in bearing up against all adversaries, that it would not be long before the great Adversary himself would be bruised under their feet.<b> The grace, &c.</b>] It appears as if the Epistle was intended to conclude with this usual benediction, but the Apostle found occasion to add more. This he does also in other Epistles: see1 Cor. xvi. 23, 24; similarly Phil. iv. 20, and vv. 21–23 after the doxology,—2 Thess. iii. 16, 17, 18:—1 Tim. vi. 16, 17 ff.:—2 Tim. iv. 18, 19 ff.
