<p><strong> 22.</strong> ] There is nothing strange (as Olsh. supposes) in this salutation being inserted in the first person. It would be natural enough that Tertius the amanuensis, inserting ἀσπάζεται ὑμ . Τέρτ . ὁ γρ . τ . ἐπ . ἐν κυρ ., should change the form into the first person, and afterwards proceed from the dictation of the Apostle as before. Beza and Grot. suppose him to have done this on transcribing the Epistle. Thol. notices this irregularity as a corroboration of the genuineness of the chapter. On the supposed identity of Tertius with Silas see note on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:22">Acts 15:22</span> .</p>
