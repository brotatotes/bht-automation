<p><strong> 23.</strong> ] Gaius is mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:14">1 Corinthians 1:14</span> , as having been baptized by Paul. <strong> The host of the whole church</strong> probably implies that the assemblies of the church were held in his house: or perhaps, that his hospitality to Christians was universal. Erastus, holding this office ( οἰκονόμος , the public treasurer, ὁ ἐπὶ τῆς δημοσίας τραπέζης , arcarius, Wetst., who quotes from inscriptions, Νείλῳ οἰκονόμῳ Ἀσίας , Secundus, arkarius Reip. Armerinorum), can hardly have been the same who was with the Apostle in Ephesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span> . It is more probable that the Erastus of 2Ti 4:20 is identical with this than with that other.
