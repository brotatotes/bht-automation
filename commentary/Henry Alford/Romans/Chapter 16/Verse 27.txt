<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] <strong> διὰ Ἰης</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> χρ</strong> <strong> .</strong> must by the requirements of the construction be applied to μόνῳ σοφῷ θεῷ , and not (as Aug [127] [and E. V.]) to δόξα , from which it is separated by the relative ᾧ . The quantity of intervening matter, especially the datives μόνῳ σοφῷ θεῷ , prevent it from being referred (as Œc [128] , Theophyl.) to στηρίξαι . It must then be rendered <strong> to the only wise God through Jesus Christ</strong> , i.e. Him who is revealed to us by Christ as such.

<p>On the construction of ᾧ see above. It cannot without great harshness be referred to <em> Christ</em> , seeing that the words μόνῳ σοφῷ θεῷ resume the chief subject of the sentence, and to them the relative must apply.</p>
