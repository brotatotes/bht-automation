Their endangering of their lives for Paul may have taken place at Corinth (Acts xviii. 6 ff.) or at Ephesus (Acts xix). See Neander, Pfl. u. Leit., p. 441.—The ‘<i>churches of the Gentiles</i>’ had reason to be thankful to them, for having<i> rescued the Apostle of the Gentiles</i> from danger.—It seems to have been the practice of Aquila and (1 Cor. xvi. 19) and some other (Col. iv. 15, Philem. 2) to hold assemblies for worship in their houses, which were saluted, and sent salutations as one body in the Lord. Some light is thrown on the expression by the following passage from the Acts of the Martyrdom of Justin: “The answer of Justin Martyr to the question of the prefect (Rusticus) ‘Where do you assemble?’ exactly corresponds to the genuine Christian spirit on this point. The answer was, ‘Where each one can and will. You believe; no doubt, that we all meet together in one place; but it is not so, for the God of the Christians is not shut up in a room, but, being invisible, He fills both heaven and earth, and is honoured every where by the faithful’ Justin adds, that when he came to Rome, he was accustomed to dwell in one particular spot, and that those Christians who were instructed by him, and wished to hear his discourse, assembled at his house. (This assembly would accordingly be ‘The Church in the house of Justin’) He had not visited any other congregations of the Church.”
