<p>De Wette remarks, that, notwithstanding the manuscript authority, εἰς ἡμᾶς is perhaps the more likely reading, (1) because the Apostle would hardly mention a service done to <em> themselves</em> as a ground of salutation from him, and (2) because κοπιᾷν without being expressly followed by λόγῳ (<span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span> ; see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="php+2:16">Philippians 2:16</span> ; Col 1:29 ), said of <em> women</em> , most likely implies acts of kindness peculiar to the sex.</p>
