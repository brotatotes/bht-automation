<b> 7.</b>] The person to be saluted may be<b> Junia</b>, feminine, in which case she is probably the wife of Andronicus,—or<b> Junias</b>, masculine. It is uncertain also whether the word<b> Kinsmen</b> means<i> fellow-countrymen</i>, or<i> relations</i>. Aquila and Priscilla were Jews: so would Mary be, and probably Epænëtus, being an early believer. If so, the word may have its strict meaning of<i> ‘relations</i>.’ Bat it seems to occur in verses 11, 21 in a wider sense.<b> fellow prisoners</b>] When and where uncertain.<b> of note among the apostles</b>] Two explanations are given, (1) that they<i> themselves are counted among</i> the Apostles: thus Chrysostom: “To be Apostles at all is a great thing; but to be also of note among them, mark what an encomium it is:” (2) ‘<i>noted among the Apostles</i>,’ i.e.<i> well known</i> and<i> spoken of</i> by the Apostles. Thus many Commentators.—But, as Tholuck remarks, had this latter been the meaning, we should have expected some expression like<i> in all the Churches</i> (2 Cor. vill. 18). I may besides remark, that for St. Paul to speak of any persons as<i> celebrated among the Apostles</i> in sense (2), would imply that he had more frequent, intercourse with the other Apostles, than we know that he had; and would besides be improbable on any supposition. The whole question seems to have sprung up in modern times from the idea that<i> the Apostles</i> must mean<i> the Twelve only</i>. If the wider sense found in Acts xiv. 4, 14; 2 Cor. viii. 23; 1 Thess. ii. 6 (compare i. 1), be taken, there need be no doubt concern-ing the meaning.<b> which also</b>] refers to Andronicus and Junia, not to the Apostles.<b></b>
