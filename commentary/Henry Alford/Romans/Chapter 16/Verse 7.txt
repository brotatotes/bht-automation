 7 .] Ἰουνιᾶν may be fem. ( Ἰουνίαν ), from Ἰουνία (Junia), in which case she is probably the wife of Andronicus, or masc., from Ἰουνιᾶς (Junianus, contr. Junias). It is uncertain also whether συγγενεῖς means  fellow-countrymen , or  relations . Aquila and Priscilla were Jews: so would Maria be, and probably Epænetus, being an early believer. If so, the word may have its strict meaning of ‘  relations .’ But it seems to occur Romans 16:11 ; Rom 16:21 in a wider sense.

	 ἐπίσημοι ἐν τ  .   ἀποστ .] Two renderings are given: (1) ‘  of note among the Apostles ,’ so that  they themselves are counted among the Apostles: thus the Greek ff. ( τὸ ἀποστόλους εἶναι , μέγα · τὸ δὲ καὶ ἐν τούτοις ἐπισήμους εἶναι , ἐννόησον ἡλίκον ἐγκώμιον , Chrys.), Calv., Est., Wolf, Thol., Kölln., Olsh., al.: or (2) ‘  noted among the Apostles ,’ i.e.  well known and spoken of by the Apostles. Thus Beza, Grot., Koppe, Reiche, Meyer, Fritz., De W.
	But, as Thol. remarks, had this latter been the meaning, we should have expected some expression like διὰ πασῶν τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν ( 2Co 8:18 ). I may besides remark, that for Paul to speak of any persons as  celebrated among the Apostles in sense (2), would imply that he had more frequent intercourse with the other Apostles, than we know that he had; and would besides be improbable on any supposition. The whole question seems to have sprung up in modern times from the idea that οἱ ἀπόστολοι must mean  the Twelve only . If the wider sense found in Acts 14:4 ; Act 14:14 ; 2 Corinthians 8:23 ; 1 Thessalonians 2:6 (compare Rom 1:1 ) be taken, there need be no doubt concerning the meaning.
