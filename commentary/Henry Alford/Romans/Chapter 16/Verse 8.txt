<p><strong> 8</strong> ff.] Ampliatus = Amplias: see <strong> v. r.
	</strong></p>
<p><strong> ἀγ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν κυρ</strong> . <strong> beloved in the bonds of Christian fellowship</strong> .
	</p>
<p><strong> συνεργ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν χρ</strong> ., <strong> fellow-workman in</strong> (the work of) <strong> Christ</strong> .
	</p>
<p>Origen and others have confounded Apelles with the well-known Apollos, but apparently without reason. Cf. Hor. Sat. i. 5. 100.
	</p>
<p><strong> δόκιμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἐν χρ</strong> ., <strong> approved</strong> (by trial) <strong> in</strong> (the work of) <strong> Christ</strong> . It does not follow that either Aristobulus or Narcissus were <em> themselves Christians</em> . Only those of their <em> familiœ</em> ( <strong> τοὺς ἐκ τῶν</strong> ) are here saluted who were ἐν κυρίῳ : for we must understand this also after Ἀριστοβούλου .

<p><strong> συγγ</strong> ., see above. Grot., Neander, al., have taken Narcissus for the well-known freedman of Claudius. But this can hardly be, for he was executed (Tac. Ann. xiii. 1) in the very beginning of Nero’s reign, i.e. cir. 55 A.D., whereas (see Prolegg. § iv. 4, and Chronol. Table) this Epistle cannot have well been written before 58 A.D. Perhaps, as Winer (Realw.) suggests, the family of this Narcissus may have continued to be thus known after his death (?).</p>
