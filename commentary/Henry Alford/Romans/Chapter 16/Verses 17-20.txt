 17 20. ] WARNING AGAINST THOSE WHO MADE DIVISIONS AMONG THEM. To what persons the Apostle refers, is not plain. Some (Thol., al.) think the Judaizers to be meant, not absolutely within the Christian pale, but endeavouring to sow dissension in it: and so, nearly, Neander, Pfl. u. Leit., p. 452. De W. thinks that Paul merely gives this warning  in case such persons came to Rome.  Judging by the text itself , we infer that these teachers were similar to those pointed out in Philippians 3:2 ; Philippians 3:18 ; 1 Timothy 6:3 ff.; 2 Corinthians 11:13 ; 2 Corinthians 11:20 ;  unprincipled and selfish persons, seducing others for their own gain : whether Judaizers or not, does not appear: but considering that the great opponents of the Apostle were of this party, we may perhaps infer that they also belonged to it.
