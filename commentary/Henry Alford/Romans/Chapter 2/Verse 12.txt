<p><strong> 12. </strong> <strong> ὅσοι γ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἀνόμως</strong> <strong> .…</strong> ] <strong> For as many</strong> as have sinned <strong> without</strong> (the) <strong> law</strong> (of Moses): <strong> shall also perish without</strong> (the) <strong> law</strong> (of Moses): i.e. <em> it shall not appear against them in judgment</em> . Whether that will <em> ameliorate</em> their case, is not even hinted, but only the <em> fact</em> , as consonant with God’s justice, stated. That this is the meaning of ἀνόμως is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:21">1 Corinthians 9:21</span> . That even these have sinned against <em> a</em> νόμος , is presently ( Rom 2:14 ) shewn. Chrys. says (Hom. vi. p. 466),.… ὁ μὲν γὰρ Ἕλλην ἀνόμως κρίνεται · τὸ δὲ <strong> ἀνόμως</strong> ἐνταῦθα οὐ τὸ χαλεπώτερον , ἀλλὰ τὸ ἡμερώτερον λέγει · (this is perhaps saying too much, see above) τουτέστιν , οὐκ ἔχει κατηγοροῦντα τὸν νόμον . τὸ γὰρ ἀνόμως τοῦτ ʼ ἐστι , χωρὶς τῆς ἐξ ἐκείνου κατακρίσεως , φησίν , ἀπὸ τῶν τῆς φύσεως λογισμῶν καταδικάζεται μόνων . ὁ δὲ Ἰουδαῖος , ἐννόμως , τουτέστι , μετὰ τῆς φύσεως καὶ τοῦ νόμου κατηγοροῦντος · ὅσῳ γάρ πλείονος ἀπήλαυσεν ἐπιμελείας , τοσούτῳ μείζονα δώσει δίκην .
	</p>
<p><strong> καί</strong> (De W.) serves to range ἀπολ ., as well as ἥμαρτ . under the common condition ἀνόμως : <strong> As many as without the law have sinned, without the law shall also perish.
	</strong></p>
<p><strong> ἀπολοῦνται</strong> , the <em> result</em> of the judgment on them, rather than κριθήσονται , its <em> process</em> , because the absence of the law would thus seem as if it were the <em> rule by which they are to be judged</em> , whereas it is only an <em> accident</em> of that judgment, which <em> depends on other considerations</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> ἐν νόμῳ</strong> <strong> , under</strong> ( <em> in</em> , as a status) <strong> the</strong> (Mosaic) <strong> law;</strong> not ‘ <em> a</em> law,’ which would make the sentence a truism: it is on <em> that very</em> undeniable assumption, ‘ <em> that all who have had a law given shall be judged by that law</em> ,’ that the Apostle constructs his argument, asserting it with regard to the Mosaic law in the case of the Jews, and proving that the Gentiles have had a law given to them in the testimony of their consciences. As to the omission of the article, no inference can be drawn, as the word follows a preposition: see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:23">Romans 2:23</span> , where ἐν νόμῳ unquestionably means ‘ <em> in the law of Moses</em> .’ Besides, these verses are no general assertions concerning men who have, and men who have not, a law revealed (for <em> all have one</em> ), but a <em> statement of the case as concerning Jews and Gentiles</em> .
	</p>
<p><strong> νόμος</strong> , <em> throughout</em> , signifies <em> the law of Moses</em> , even though anarthrous, in every place, except where the absence of the article corresponds to a <em> logical</em> indefiniteness, as e.g. ἑαυτοῖς εἰσιν νόμος , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span> ; and even there not ‘ <em> a</em> law:’ see note. And I hope to shew that it is never thus anarthrously used as = ὁ νόμος , except where usage will account for such omission of the article.
	</p>
<p><strong> διὰ νόμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κριθ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] <strong> Now, shall be judged by the law:</strong> for that will furnish the <em> measure</em> and <em> rule</em> by which judgment will proceed.</p>
