<b> 12. For as many as have sinned without</b> (the)<b> law</b> (of Moses)<b> shall also perish without</b> (the)<b> law</b> (of Moses)] i.e.<i> it shall not appear against them in judg-ment</i>. Whether that will<i> ameliorate</i> their case, is not even hinted,—but only the<i> fact</i>, as consonant with God’s justice, stated. That this is the meaning of<i> without law</i> is clear from 1 Cor. ix. 21. That even these have sinned against<i> a law</i> is presently (ver. 14) shewn. Chrysostom says, “The Greek is judged<i> without law</i>: this implies not a more severe, but a milder judgment (this is perhaps saying too much, see above), that is, he has not the law to accuse him. This is the meaning of<i> without law</i>, that he is convicted without its condemnation, by the arguments of nature only. But the Jew is judged by the law, ie. the law also, together with nature, accusing him: for the greater care he had bestowed on him, the greater will be his penalty.” It is said,<b> shall perish</b>, the<i> result</i> of the judgment on them, rather than “<i>shall be judged</i>,” its<i> process</i>, because the absence of the law would thus seem as if it were the<i> rule by which they are to be judged</i>,—whereas it is only an<i> accident</i> of that judgment, which<i> depends on other considerations</i>.<br><br><b> under</b> (or in, as a condition of being)<b> the</b> (Mosaic)<b> law</b>; not ‘<i>a law</i>,’ which would make the sentence a truism: it is on<i> that very</i> undeniable assumption, ‘<i>that all who have had a law given shall be judged by that law</i>,’ that the Apostle constructs his argument, asserting it with to the Mosaic law in the ease of the Jews, and proving that the Gentiles have had a law given to them in the testimony of their consciences. These verses are no general assertions concerning men who have, and men who have not, a law revealed (for<i> all have one</i>), but a<i> statement of the case as concerning Jews and Gentiles</i>. It may safely be assumed that whenever the word “<i>law</i>” is used, without any further definition, in this Epistle, the law of Moses is intended by it. These last<b> shall be judged by the law</b>: for that will furnish the<i> measure</i> and<i> rule</i> by which judgment will proceed.
