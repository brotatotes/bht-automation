 13. ] This is to explain to the Jew the fact, that not his mere hearing of the law read in the synagogue (= his being by birth and privilege a Jew) will justify him before God, but (still keeping to general principles and not touching as yet on the  impossibility of being thus justified ) the doing of the law.
	τοῦ has been apparently inserted in both cases in the later MSS. from seeing that νόμος was indisputably the law of Moses, and stumbling at the unusual expression οἱ ἀκροαταὶ νόμου . But the οἱ in both cases is  generic , and ἀκροατὴς - νόμου , ποιητὴς - νόμου (almost as  one word in each case), ‘a  hearer-of-the-law ,’ a ‘  doer-of-the-law .’ So that the correct English for οἱ ἀκροαταὶ νόμου is  hearers of the law , and for οἱ ποιηταὶ νόμου ,  doers of the law . It is obvious, that with the  omission of the τοῦ in both places, the whole elaborate and ingenious criticism built by Bp. Middleton on its  use , falls to the ground. (See Middleton, Gr. Art. in loc.) His dictum, that such an expression as οἱ ἀκροαταὶ νόμου  is inadmissible , will hardly in our day be considered as deciding the matter.
