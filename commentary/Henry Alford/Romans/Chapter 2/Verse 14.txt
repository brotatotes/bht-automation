 14. ]  ἔθνη  , the Gentiles [in general]; see ch. Romans 3:29 ; Romans 11:13 ; Romans 15:10 ; Romans 15:12 . In this place, ἔθνη τὰ μὴ νόμ . ἔχοντα is the only way in which the sense required could be expressed, for τὰ ἔθνη τὰ μὴ ν . ἔχ ., would mean ‘  those Gentiles who have not the law ,’ as also would ἔθνη μὴ νόμον ἔχ ., whereas the meaning clearly is,  the Gentiles not having the law.
	 νόμον ] Again, ‘  the law,’ viz.  of Moses. A law, they have; see below.
	 φύσει  , by nature , τοῖς φυσικοῖς ἑπόμενα λογισμοῖς , Schol. in Matthaï.
	 τὰ τοῦ νόμου π  . ]  do things pertaining to the law [i.e. the things about which the law is concerned], e.g. abstain from stealing, or killing, or adultery. But it by no means follows that the Apostle means that the Gentiles could  fulfil the law, do  the things, i.e.  all the things enjoined by the law (as De Wette): he argues that a conscientious Gentile, who knows not  the law , does, when he acts in accordance with requirements of the law, so far set up the (see below on the art.) law to himself.
	τὰ τοῦ νόμου is interpreted by Beza, Wetst., and Elsner, ‘  that which the law does ,’ i.e. make sanctions and prohibitions: but this can hardly be.
	The Apostle does not deny certain virtues to the Gentiles, but maintains the inefficiency of those, and all other virtues, towards man’s salvation.
	 ἑαυτοῖς εἰσιν νόμος ]  are to themselves (so far)  the law , not ‘  a law,’ for  a law may be just or unjust, God’s law or man’s law: there is  but one law of God , partly written in men’s consciences, more plainly manifested in the law of Moses, and fully revealed in Jesus Christ. The art. could not have been here used without stultifying the sentence by distributing the predicate, making the conscientious heathen to be to himself  the whole of the law , instead of ‘  the law, so far as he did the works of the law .’ Cf. Aristot. Eth. iv. 14, ὁ δὲ χαρίεις κ . ἐλευθέριος οὕτως ἕξει οἷον νόμος ὢν ἑαυτῷ .
