<b> 14.</b>] Now, the Apostle speaks of the<b> Gentiles</b> in general; see ch. iii. 29; xi. 13; xv. 10, 12.<br><br><b> the law</b>] viz.<i> of Moses</i>.<b> A</b> law, they have; see below.<b> by nature</b>, i.e. in accordance with the promptings of their own minds.<br><br><b> the things of the law</b>] i.e. the things about which the law is concerned: for example, abstain from stealing, or killing, or adultery. But it by no means follows that the Apostle means that the Gentiles could<i> fulfil</i> the law, do<i> the</i> things, i.e.<i> all</i> the things enjoined by the law: he argues that a conscientious Gentile, who knows not<i> the law</i>, does, when he acts in accordance with requirements of the law, so far set up the law to himself. The Apostle does not deny certain virtues to the Gentiles, but maintains the inefficiency of those, and all other virtues, towards man’s salvation.<br><br><b> are the law unto themselves</b> (so far), not ‘<i>a law</i>,’ for<i> a law</i> may be just or unjust, God’s law or man’s law: there is but one law of God, partly written in men’s consciences, more plainly manifested in the law of Moses, and fully revealed in Jesus Christ.
