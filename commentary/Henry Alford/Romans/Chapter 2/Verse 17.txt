<b> 17. But if</b>] The Greek for this, and for “<i>behold</i>,” differ only by one letter. All our older MSS. have but if: and the other has been substituted for it in the later ones, possibly by mistake, possibly because the sentence with “<i>if</i>” seems at first sight not to be complete. But this incompleteness is more apparent than real. It is only produced by the resumption of the thread ot the sentence with “therefore,” ver. 21. Omit (in the sense) only that word, and all proceeds regularly— ‘<i>But if thou art denominated a Jew, and&c…, thou that teachest thy neighbour, dost thou not teach thyself</i>?’&c. The address in the second person carries on the apostrophe from ver. 5, since when it has been broken off by reference to the great day of retribution and its rule of judgment; the thou identifies the person addressed here as the same indicated there, and is here emphatic, as in ver. 1. Thus the Apostle by degrees<i> sets in his place as a Jew</i> the somewhat indefinite object of his remonstrances hitherto,—and reasons with him as such.
