 17.   εἰ δέ ] This has been in the later MSS. changed into ἰδέ , apparently to avoid the anacoluthon, or perhaps merely by mistake originally. The anacoluthon, however, is more apparent than real. It is only produced by the resumption of the thread of the sentence with οὖν , Romans 2:21 . Omit (in the sense) only that word, and all proceeds regularly ‘  But if thou art denominated a Jew, and &c.…, thou that teachest thy neighbour, dost thou not teach thyself?’ &c. The  εἰ δὲ σύ carries on the apostrophe from Romans 2:5 , since when it has been broken off by reference to the great day of retribution and its rule of judgment; the  σύ identifies the person addressed here as the same indicated by the  σου and  σεαυτῷ there, and by  ὦ ἄνθρωπε in Romans 2:1 . Thus the Apostle by degrees  sets in his place as a Jew the somewhat indefinite object of his remonstrances hitherto, and reasons with him as such.

	The τῷ of the rec. has been inserted in the later MSS. before νόμῳ , because it here clearly applied to the ‘law of Moses,’ and the absence of the article gave offence. It is omitted, because ‘the law’ is not here  distributed it is not  the law itself in its entirety , which is meant, but  the fact of having or of knowing the law : the strict way of expressing it would perhaps be, ‘in the fact of possessing a law,’ which condensed into our less accurate English, would be in one word,  in the law : viz. ‘which thou possessest.’
	 καυχ  .   ἐν θ  . ] viz. ‘as thy  Covenant God :’ ‘as being peculiarly thine.’
