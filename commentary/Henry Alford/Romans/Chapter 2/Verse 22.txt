<p><strong> 22. </strong> <strong> ὁ βδελ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τὰ εἴδ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> ἱεροσυλεῖς</strong> ] The contrast here must be maintained; which it will not be if we understand ἱεροσυλεῖς of robbing the temple of God of offerings destined for him (Jos. Antt. xviii. 3, Antt. xviii.4). And τὰ εἴδωλα leads into the kind of robbery which is meant. <strong> Thou who abhorrest idols, dost thou rob their temples</strong> ? That it was necessary to vindicate Jews from such a charge, appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:37">Acts 19:37</span> ; and Jos.Antt. iv. 8.10 gives as a law, μὴ συλᾷν ἱερὰ ξενικά , μηδ ʼ ἂν ἐπωνομασμένον ᾖ τινι θεῷ κειμήλιον λαμβάνειν .</p>
