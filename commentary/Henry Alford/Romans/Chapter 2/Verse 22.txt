<b> 22. thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?</b>] The contrast here must be maintained; which it will not be if we understand the question to apply to robbing the temple of God of offerings destined for Him (Jos. Ant. xviii. 3. 4). And the mention of<i> abhorring idols</i> leads into the kind of robbery which is meant. “Thou who abhorrest idols, dost thou rob their temples?” That it was necessary to vindicate the Jews from such a charge, appears from Acts xix. 37: and Josephus gives as a law, not to rob strange temples, nor take any offering dedicated by name to any god.
