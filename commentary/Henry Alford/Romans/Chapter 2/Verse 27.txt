<p><strong> 27.</strong> ] I prefer with De Wette (and Erasm.), Luth., Bengel, Wetst., Knapp, and Meyer, to regard this verse not as a continuation of the question, but as a separate emphatic assertion, and as leading the way to the next verse.
	</p>
<p><strong> κρινεῖ</strong> , ‘shall rise up in judgment against,’ <strong> judge</strong> indirectly by his example. See <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:41-42">Matthew 12:41-42</span> , where κατακρίνω is used in a sense precisely similar.
	</p>
<p><strong> ἡ ἐκ φύσεως ἀκροβ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] ‘he, who remains in his natural state of uncircumcision.’ ἐκ φύς . is contrasted with διὰ γράμ . κ . περιτ . below. The position of ἐκ φύσεως decides for this rendering and against joining it with τελοῦσα , which would require ἡ ἀκροβυστία , ἐκ φύσεως τὸν νόμον τελοῦσα .
	</p>
<p><strong> τὸν νόμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τελ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] such is the supposition that an uncircumcised man could fully act up to the (moral) requirements of the law. It is not ἡ τὸν νόμ . τελ .; because ἀκροβ . is used in the widest abstract sense: no distinction is made between one and another uncircumcised person, but some one man is taken as an example of ἀκροβυστία . So that the omission of the art. does not give a new hypothetic sense, ‘ <em> if it fulfil the law</em> ,’ but merely restates the hypothesis: <strong> fulfilling</strong> (as it does, as we have supposed) <strong> the law</strong> .
	</p>
<p><strong> σὲ τὸν</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> παραβάτην νόμου</strong> ] Here again the position of διὰ γράμματος κ . περιτομῆς , between τὸν and παραβάτην , sufficiently shews that, as ἐκ φύσεως above, it is a qualification of σὲ τὸν παραβάτην νόμου . Bp. Middleton (it appears, Gr. Art. in loc. and compare his ref.) would take σὲ τὸν διὰ γράμματος κ . περιτομῆς ( ὄντα ), ‘ <em> thee who art a professor of the law and a circumcised person</em> ,’ and understand εἶναι after παραβάτην , <em> shall adjudge thee to be a transgressor of the law</em> . But this appears exceedingly forced, and inconsistent with the position of παραβ . νόμου , which if it had been thus emphatic, would certainly have been placed either before, or immediately after κρινεῖ . We may well imagine that such an interpretation would not have been thought of, except to serve the supposed canon, that, ‘if τόν were immediately the article of παραβάτην , νόμου depending on it could not be anarthrous.’ See above on παραβ . νόμ . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:25">Romans 2:25</span> , and on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:13">Romans 2:13</span> .
	</p>
<p><strong> διὰ γρ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> περ</strong> <strong> .</strong> ] διὰ (see reff.) is here used of the <em> state in which the man is</em> when he does the act, <em> regarded at the medium</em> through which the act is done. It is rightly rendered <strong> by</strong> in E. V. [though this gives too much the idea of the state being the instrument by means of which] (not, ‘ <em> in spite of</em> ,’ as Köllner and al.).
	</p>
<p><strong> γράμματος</strong> ] ‘litera scripta,’ the <em> written word</em> : here in a more general sense than in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span> , where it is pressed to a contrast with πνεῦμα : <strong> thee, who in a state of external conformity with the written law and of circumcision, art yet a transgressor of the law.
	</strong></p>
<p>In <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28-29">Romans 2:28-29</span> <strong> ,</strong> supply the ellipses thus: in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28">Romans 2:28</span> , fill up the subjects from the predicates, οὐ γὰρ ὁ ἐν τῷ φανερῷ ( Ἰουδαῖος ) Ἰουδαῖός ἐστιν , οὐδὲ ἡ ἐν τῷ φανερῷ ἐν σαρκὶ ( περιτομὴ ) περιτομή ( ἐστιν ); in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span> , fill up the predicates from the subjects, ἀλλ ʼ ὁ ἐν τῷ κρυπτῷ Ἰουδαῖος ( Ἰουδαῖός ἐστιν ), καὶ περιτομὴ καρδίας ἐν πνεύματι οὐ γράμματι ( περιτομή ἐστιν ). Thus the <em> real Jew only</em> , and the <em> real circumcision only</em> , are <em> expressed</em> in both verses. This is the arrangement of Beza, Estius, Rückert, De Wette: Erasm., Luther, Meyer, Fritzsche, take Ἰουδαῖος , and ἐν πν . οὐ γράμ ., as the predicates in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span> ; but the latter gives a very vapid sense, besides that the opposition of ὁ ἐν τῷ φανερῷ , and ὁ ἐν τῷ κρυπτῷ is, as De W. observes, also vapid.</p>
