<b> 29.</b>]<b> inwardly or in secret</b>, as a qualification of the Jew, is parallel with<b> of the heart</b> as a qualification of<i> circumcision: both</i> designating the inner and spiritual reality, of which the name of Jew and the carnal circumcision are only the signs.— “<i>Circumcision of the heart</i>” is no new expression:—we have it virtually in Deut. x. 16; Jer. iv. 4: see also Acts vii. 51.<br><br><b> in the spirit, not in the letter</b>] Not merely ‘spiritually, not externally? nor does the word “<i>spirit</i>” allude to the<i> necessitating cause</i> of circumcision (the uncleanness of the inner man):—nor signify the<i> material</i>; nor the<i> rule</i>; but the<i> living power or element</i>, wherewith that inner sphere of being is filled,—in being used as in Acts xvii. 28, of that in which any thing lives and moves,—comp. “j<i> oy in the Holy Ghost</i>,” ch. 17,— “<i>love in the spirit</i>,” Col. i. 8,— ‘ ‘<i>to serve in newness of spirit</i>,” ch, vii. 6,— “ ‘<i>to be in the spirit</i>,” ch. viii. 9. So that<b> the spirit</b><i> here</i> is not man’s spirit, nor properly the Holy Spirit, but<i> the spirit</i>, as opposed to<i> the letter</i>, of the Jewish law and of all God’s revelation of Himself.<br><br><b> whose praise</b>] viz. of the true Jew: the circumcision of the heart, as belonging to him, is subordinate.—The praise of such a character, (for<i> praise</i> it must be,) can only come from Him who sees in secret (Matt. vi. 4, 6), and can discern the heart.
