 5. ] I am inclined with Lachmann to regard the question as continued. If not, the responsive contrast to the question in Rom 2:4 would begin more emphatically than with κατὰ δὲ …; it would be σὺ δὲ κατὰ .… or θησαυρίζεις δὲ σεαυτῷ κατὰ .… But the enquiry loses itself in the digressive clauses following, and no where comes pointedly to an end. I have therefore not placed a mark of interrogation at ἄγει or at θεοῦ , as Lachm. does, but have left the construction to explain itself.
	 κατά ] not, ‘  in proportion to ’ (Meyer), but as E. V.  after , ‘  in consonance with ,’ ‘  secundum ,’ describing the state out of which the action springs: see Romans 2:7 , καθ ʼ ὑπομονήν .
	 ἀμεταν  . ] not admitting that μετάνοια to which God is leading thee.
	 ἐν ἡμέρᾳ , not for, nor = εἰς ἡμέραν , nor should it be rendered ‘  against the day,’ as E. V. I need hardly remind any accurate scholar, that such an interpretation as ‘ ἐν for εἰς ’ is  no where to be tolerated. It belongs to ὀργήν ,  wrath in the day of wrath , ‘wrath which shall come upon thee in that day,’ not to θησαυρίζεις , imagining which has led to the mistake. The ἡμέρα ὀργῆς is the  day of judgment , viewed in its relation to  sinners : see reff.
	 ἀποκαλ  .   δικαιοκρ  . ]  the manifestation (public enforcement, it having been before latent though determined)  of God’s righteous judgment . The reading ἀποκ .  καὶ δικαιοκρ . would mean, ‘  the appearance (reff.)  of God, and his righteous judgment ,’ not referring merely to  the detection of men’s hearts , as Origen, Theophyl., Rückert. But the reading is not strongly upheld, nor is it according to the mode of speaking in the argument see ch. Romans 1:17-18 .
