This<i> retribution</i> must be carefully kept in its place in the argument. The Apostle is here speaking<i> generally</i>, of the general system of God in governing the world,—the judging according to each man’s works—punishing the evil, and rewarding the righteous. No question<i> at present</i> arises,<i> how</i> this righteousness in God’s sight<i> is to be obtained</i>—but the truth is only stated broadly at present, to be further specified by and by, when it is clearly shewn that by<i> works of the law</i> no flesh can be justified before God. The neglect to observe this has occasioned two mistakes: (1) an idea that by this passage it is proved that not faith only, but works also in some measure, justify before God; and (2) an idea that by “<i>well-doing</i>” here is<i> meant</i> faith in Christ. However true it be, so much is certainly not<i> meant</i> here, but merely the fact, that<i> every where, and in all, God punishes evil, and rewards good.</i>
