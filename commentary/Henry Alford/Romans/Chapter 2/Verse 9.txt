 9.   θλῖψ  .   κ  .   στεν  . ] An expression from the LXX (see reff.): the former signifying more the outward weight of objective infliction, the latter the subjective feeling of the pressure. It is possible, in the case of the  suffering Christian , for the former to exist without the latter: so 2 Corinthians 4:8 , ἐν παντὶ θλιβόμενοι , ἀλλ ʼ οὐ στενοχωρούμενοι . But here the objective weight of infliction and the subjective weight of anguish, are co-existent.
	 ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ψ  .   ἀνθ  . ] probably a periphrasis for the sake of emphasis and solemnity. Had it been (as Fritzsche and Meyer) to indicate that the soul is the suffering part of the man (nearly so Olsh.), it should have been as De W. observes, ἐπὶ ψυχὴν παντὸς ἀνθρ ., or ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ψυχὴν ἀνθρώπων (see reff.).
	 κατεργ  . ] κατεργάζομαι and ἐργάζομαι seem to have but this slight difference, that κατεργάζομαι , answering rather to our ‘commit,’ is more naturally used of  evil , as manifested and judged of by  separate acts among men, whereas ἐργάζομαι , answering to our ‘work,’ is used indifferently of both good and evil. That this is not always kept to, see reff., especially ch. Romans 7:18 , and Plato Legg. iii. p. 686, end, in both which places, however,  definite acts are spoken of. The  pres. part . denotes the status or habit of the man.
	 Ἰουδ  .   τε πρῶτον ] Because the Jew has so much greater advantages, and better opportunities of knowing the divine will: and, therefore, pre-eminent responsibility.
