<p><strong> 7, 8. </strong> <strong> τοῖς μὲν καθ</strong> <strong> ʼ </strong> <strong> ὑπ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> ὀργὴ κ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θυμός</strong> ] <strong> To</strong> those <strong> who by endurance in good works seek for glory and honour and immortality</strong> (will He render) <strong> eternal life: but to those who are</strong> (men) <strong> of self-seeking, and disobey the truth, but obey iniquity</strong> (shall accrue) <strong> anger and wrath</strong> , &amp;c. The verb ἀποδώσει , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:6">Romans 2:6</span> , should have two accusatives, representing the two sides of the final retribution, ζωὴν αἰών . and ὀργήν , &amp;c. But the second of these is changed to a nominative and connected with ἔσται understood, and made the first member of the following sentence, δόξα δὲ κ . τ . λ . being opposed to it. Thus also two datives belong to ἀποδώσει , viz. τοῖς .… ζητοῦσιν , and τοῖς … ἀδικίᾳ . To ζητοῦσιν belong δόξ . κ . τιμ . κ . ἀφθ . as its accusatives, and καθ ʼ ὑπομ . ἔργ . ἀγ . as its adverb. This, as De Wette remarks, is the only admissible construction: in opposition to ( α ) Œcum. and Beza, who divide ἔργ . ἀγ . from καθ ʼ ὑπομ . ( <em> iis quidem qui secundum patientem expectationem quœrunt boni operis gloriam</em> ), ( β ) Bengel, Knapp, Fritzsche, Olsh., and Krehl, who take τοῖς .… ἀγαθοῦ as meaning ‘ <em> those who endure in good works</em> ’ (as Œc [8] does τοῖς καθ ʼ ὑπομ . <em> those who endure</em> , absol.), and δόξαν .… ζητοῦσιν , as in apposition with it, ( γ ) Photius (in Œcum.), Luther, and Estius, who take it, τοῖς .… ζητοῦσιν ζωὴν αἰών ., δόξαν κ . τ . λ ., ( δ ) Reiche, who takes τοῖς μέν , ‘ <em> to the one</em> ,’ alone, and makes καθ ʼ ὑπομ . parallel to κατὰ τὰ ἔργα , representing the <em> rule of judgment</em> , taking the rest as ( γ ).
