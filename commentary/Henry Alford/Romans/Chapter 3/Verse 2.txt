<b> 2.</b>] The words,<b> much every way</b>, answer the first question of ver. 1, but take no account of the second, as it is virtually included in the first. Nor can it be properly regarded as answered in ch. iv. 1 ff. (see there.)<br><br><b> every way</b>] i.e. in all departments of the spiritual life.<br><br><b> first indeed</b>] The Apostle begins as if intending to instance<i> several</i> of these advantages, but having mentioned the<i> greatest</i>, leaves it to his reader to fill in the rest, and turns to establish what he has just asserted. For the word here can only mean<b> first</b>;— ‘secondly,’&c., being to follow: not “chiefly” as A.V. and others. Compare a similar use of “<i>first</i>” without being followed by “<i>second</i>,” in ch. i. 8.<br><br><b> the oracles of God</b>] These words look very like a reminiscence of Stephen’s apology, see Acts vii, 38. These oracles are not only the law of Moses, but all the revelations of God hitherto made of Himself<i> directly</i>, all of which had been entrusted to<i> Jews only</i>. By these they were received into a special covenant, which advantage is therefore included in their being entrusted with the divine oracles.
