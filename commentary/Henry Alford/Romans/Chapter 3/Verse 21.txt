<b> 21. now</b>] Is this meant of<i> time</i>, ‘<i>now</i>,’ in contradistinction to ages past, as in ver. 26, ‘<i>at this time</i>,’—or is it merely equivalent to ‘as things are, ‘<i>now we find?</i>’ The former is<i> true</i> in sense, and applicable to the circumstances of the gospel: but the meaning is<i> too strong</i>, where no contrast of time is expressly in view. I therefore prefer the latter, especially as St. Paul’s usage elsewhere justifies it; see ch. vii. 17; 1 Cor. xv. 20.<br><br><b> apart from</b> (i. e. without the help of)<b> the law</b>] ‘independently of the law;’ not ‘without the<i> works</i> of the law:’ for here itis not<i> the way to the righteousness of God</i> which is spoken of (which is<i> faith</i>), but that righteousness<i> itself</i>.<br><br><b> the righteousness of God</b>: in what sense, see ch. i, 17, and note.<br><br><b> hath been manifested</b>] viz. in the facts of the gospel. The perfect tense sets forth the manifestation of this righteousness in history as an<i> accomplished and still enduring fac</i> t,—on the other hand, the present tense in ch, i. 17 denotes the continual unfolding of this righteousness in the hearts and lives of faithful believers.<br><br><b> being witnessed</b>]<b> being borne witness to</b> (present tense, because the law and prophets remain on record as a revelation of God’s will)<b> by the law and the prophets</b> (not merely the types and prophecies, but the<i> whole body</i> of the Old Testament; see Matt. xxii. 40).
