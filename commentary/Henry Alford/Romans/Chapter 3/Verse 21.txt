<b> 21. now</b>] Is this meant of<i> time</i>, ‘<i>now</i>,’ in contradistinction to ages past, as in ver. 26, ‘<i>at this time</i>,’—or is it merely equivalent to ‘as things are, ‘<i>now we find?</i>’ The former is<i> true</i> in sense, and applicable to the circumstances of the gospel: but the meaning is<i> too strong</i>, where no contrast of time is expressly in view. I therefore prefer the latter, especially as St. Paul’s usage elsewhere justifies it; see ch. vii. 17; 1 Cor. xv. 20.
