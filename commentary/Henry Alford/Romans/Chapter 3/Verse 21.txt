<p><strong> 21. </strong> <strong> νυνί</strong> ] Is this of <em> time, ‘now</em> ,’ in contradistinction to ages past, = ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:26">Romans 3:26</span> , or is it merely = ‘as things are,’ ‘ <em> now we find</em> ?’ The former is held by Grot., Bengel, Tholuck, Reiche, Olsh., Rückert, al., the latter by Fritzsche, Meyer, and De Wette. The <em> former</em> is <em> true</em> in sense, and applicable to the circumstances of the gospel: but the meaning is <em> too strong</em> , where no contrast of time is expressly in view. I therefore prefer the latter, especially as Paul’s usage elsewhere justifies it; see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:17">Romans 7:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span> .

<p><strong> δικαιος</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> θεοῦ</strong> ] <strong> God’s righteousness</strong> : in what sense, see ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span> , and note.

<p><strong> πεφανέρωται</strong> ] viz. in the facts of the gospel. The perfect sets forth the manifestation of this righteousness in history as an <em> accomplished and still enduring fact</em> the ἀποκαλύπτεται of ch. Rom 1:17 denotes the continual unfolding of this righteousness in the hearts and lives of faithful believers.

<p><strong> μαρτυρουμένη</strong> κ . τ . λ .] <strong> being borne witness to</strong> (pres. because the law and prophets remain on record as a revelation of God’s will) <strong> by the law and the prophets</strong> (not merely the types and prophecies, but the <em> whole body</em> of the O. T., see Mat 22:40 ).</p>
