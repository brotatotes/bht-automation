 21.   νυνί ] Is this of  time, ‘now ,’ in contradistinction to ages past, = ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ , Romans 3:26 , or is it merely = ‘as things are,’ ‘  now we find ?’ The former is held by Grot., Bengel, Tholuck, Reiche, Olsh., Rückert, al., the latter by Fritzsche, Meyer, and De Wette. The  former is  true in sense, and applicable to the circumstances of the gospel: but the meaning is  too strong , where no contrast of time is expressly in view. I therefore prefer the latter, especially as Paul’s usage elsewhere justifies it; see ch. Romans 7:17 ; 1 Corinthians 15:20 .
	 χωρὶς νόμου ]  without the (help of the)  law , ‘independently of the law:’ not ‘without the  works of the law;’ for here it is not  the way to the δικ . θεοῦ which is spoken of (which is  faith ), but that δικ .  itself .
	 δικαιος  .   θεοῦ ]  God’s righteousness : in what sense, see ch. Romans 1:17 , and note.
	 πεφανέρωται ] viz. in the facts of the gospel. The perfect sets forth the manifestation of this righteousness in history as an  accomplished and still enduring fact the ἀποκαλύπτεται of ch. Rom 1:17 denotes the continual unfolding of this righteousness in the hearts and lives of faithful believers.
	 μαρτυρουμένη κ . τ . λ .]  being borne witness to (pres. because the law and prophets remain on record as a revelation of God’s will)  by the law and the prophets (not merely the types and prophecies, but the  whole body of the O. T., see Mat 22:40 ).
