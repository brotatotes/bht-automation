 23. [  ὑστεροῦνται should be rendered  fall short , not, as E. V., “come short,” since this latter may be taken for the past tense, after the auxiliary “  have .”]
	 τῆς δόξης τοῦ θεοῦ ]  Of the praise which comes from God , see reff. (so Grot., Thol., Reiche, Fritz., Meyer, Rückert, De Wette): not, ‘  of praise in God’s sight ’ (Luther, Calv., Estius, Köllner): nor, ‘  of glory with God ,’ as ch. Romans 5:2 (Œc [15] , Beza, al.), for the Apostle is not speaking here of future reward, but of present worthiness: nor,  of the glorious image of God which we have lost through sin (Calov., al., Rückert, Olsh.), which is against both the usage of the word, and the context of the passage.
