<b> 23. fall short</b>] The reason for substituting this for<b> come short of</b> the A.V. is this, the latter may be mistaken for the past tense, after the auxiliary ‘<i>have</i>,’ whereas it is<i> present</i>.<br><br><b> the glory of God</b> here appears to mean,<i> the praise that cometh of God</i>: not ‘<i>praise in God’s sight;’</i> nor ‘<i>glory with God,</i>’ as ch. v. 2; for the Apostle is not speaking here of future reward, but of present worthiness; nor<i> the glorious image of God</i> which we have lost through sin, which is against both the usage of the word, and the context of the passage.
