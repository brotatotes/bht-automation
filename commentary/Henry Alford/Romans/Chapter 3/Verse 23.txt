<p><strong> 23.</strong> [ <strong> ὑστεροῦνται</strong> should be rendered <strong> fall short</strong> , not, as E. V., “come short,” since this latter may be taken for the past tense, after the auxiliary “ <em> have</em> .”]

<p><strong> τῆς δόξης τοῦ θεοῦ</strong> ] <strong> Of the praise which comes from God</strong> , see reff. (so Grot., Thol., Reiche, Fritz., Meyer, Rückert, De Wette): not, ‘ <em> of praise in God’s sight</em> ’ (Luther, Calv., Estius, Köllner): nor, ‘ <em> of glory with God</em> ,’ as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span> (Œc [15] , Beza, al.), for the Apostle is not speaking here of future reward, but of present worthiness: nor, <em> of the glorious image of God</em> which we have lost through sin (Calov., al., Rückert, Olsh.), which is against both the usage of the word, and the context of the passage.
