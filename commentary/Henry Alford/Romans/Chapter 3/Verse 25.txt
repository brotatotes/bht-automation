<b> 25. set forth</b>] Manifested historically in His incarnation, sufferings, and exaltation.<br><br><b> as a propitiation</b>] Literally,<b> as a propitiatory offering</b>. On the word used, see note in my Greek Testament.<br><br><b> through faith</b>, as the subjective means of appropriation of this propitiation. These words are not to be joined (in the A.V.) with “<i>in his blood</i>,” as if the faith were exercised on the atoning blood of: Christ:—for such<br><br> an expression as<i> faith</i>, or<i> believing</i>,<i> in the blood of Christ</i>, would be unexampled,—and (which is decisive) the clause ought to be<b> by his blood</b>, and requires a primary, not asubordinate place in the sentence, because the next clause, “<i>to declare his righteousness</i>,” directly refers to it. As “<i>through faith</i>” is the subjective means of appropriation, so “<i>by his blood</i>” is the objective means of manifestation, of Christ asa propitiatory sacrifice.<b> Blood</b> is not equivalent to<i> death</i>, but refers to propitiation<i> by blood</i>,—the well-known typical use of it is sacrifice.<br><br><b> for the shewing forth of His righteousness</b>: this is the aim of the putting forth of Christ as an expiatory victim.<br><br><b> righteousness</b>, not<i> truth</i>,—not<i> goodness</i>,—not both these combined with<i> justice</i>,—not<i> justifying</i>, or<i> sin-forgiving righteousness</i>,—not the<i> righteousness which He gives</i>,—which last would repeat the idea already contained in ver. 21, and rob the words next following of all meaning,—not<i> holiness</i>, which does not correspond to the term just and<i> justifier</i> used below,—but<b> judicial righteousness</b>, JUSTICE. This interpretation alone suits the requirements of the sense, and corresponds to the idea of the verb<i> to justify</i>, which is itself judicial. A<i> sin-offering</i> betokens on the one side the expiation of guilt, and on the other ensures pardon and reconciliation: and thus the Death of Christ is not only a proof of God’s grace and love, but also of His judicial righteousness which requires punishment and expiation.<br><br><b> because of</b> (not “<i>for</i>,” as A.V., nor “<i>by means of</i>:” both these renderings are wrong)<b> the passing over of the former sins</b>...] i.e.<i> because God had overlooked the sins that had passed in His forbearance; and the words contain the reason why</i> God would manifest His judicial righteousness;<b> on account of the overlooking of the sins which had passed, in the forbearance of God</b>; i.e. to vindicate that character for justice, which might seem, owing to the suspension of God’s righteous sentence on sin in former ages in His forbearance, to be placed in question:—to shew, that though He did not then fully punish for sin, and though He did then set forth inadequate means of (subjective) justification,—yet He did both, not because His justice was slumbering, nor because the nature of His righteousness was altered,—but because<i> He had provided a way</i> whereby sin might be forgiven, and He might be just. Observe, the facet mentioned<i> is not forgiveness</i>, or<i> remission</i>, as the A.V. erroneously renders it, but<b> passing over</b>, or<b> overlooking</b>, which is the work of<i> forbearance</i> (see Acts xvii. 30), whereas<i> forgiveness</i> is the work of<i> grace</i>,—see ch. ii. 4:—nor do<b> the former sins</b> mean, ‘the sins of each man which precede his conversion,’ but.<i> those of the whole world before the death of Christ</i>.
