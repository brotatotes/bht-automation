The contrast is not here between  the law and  the Gospel as two dispensations, but between the  law of works and the  law of faith , whether found under the law, or the Gospel, or (if the case admitted) any where else. This is evident by the Apostle proving below that  Abraham was justified , not by works, so as to have whereof to boast, but by faith.
