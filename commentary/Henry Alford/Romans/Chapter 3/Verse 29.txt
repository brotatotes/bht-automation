<b> 29.</b>] In showing how completely Jewish boasting is excluded, St. Paul purposes to take*the ground of their own law, and demonstrate it from that. He will shew that God is not (the God) of Jews alone, but of Gentiles, and that<i> this very point was involved in the promise</i> made to Abraham,<i> by believing which he was justified</i> (ch. iv.), and therefore that it lies in the<i> very root and kernel of the law itself</i>. But, as often elsewhere, he passes off from this idea again and again, recurring to it however continually,â€”and eventually when he brings forward his proof text (in chap. iv. 17),<i> Abraham's faith</i>, and<i> not this fact</i>, has become the leading subject.
