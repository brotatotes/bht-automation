 29. ] In shewing how completely Jewish boasting is excluded, Paul purposes to take the ground of their own law, and demonstrate it from that. He will shew that God is not (the God) of Jews alone, but of Gentiles, and that  this very point was involved in the promise made to Abraham,  by believing which he was Justified (ch. 4), and therefore that it lies in the  very root and kernel of the law itself . But, as often elsewhere, he passes off from this idea again and again, recurring to it however continually, and eventually when he brings forward his proof-text ( πατέρα πολλῶν ἐθνῶν τέθεικά σε , Rom 4:17 ),  Abraham’s faith , and  not this fact , has become the leading subject.
