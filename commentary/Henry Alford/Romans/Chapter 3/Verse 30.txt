<p><strong> 30. </strong> <strong> εἴπερ</strong> ] <strong> if at least</strong> (if we are to hold to what is manifest as a result of our former argument) <strong> God is One, who shall justify the circumcision</strong> (= the Jews, after the analogy of ch. Rom 2:26 ) <strong> by</strong> ( ἐκ , as the preliminary condition, the state <em> out of which</em> the justification arises) <strong> faith, and the uncircumcision</strong> (the Gentiles) <strong> through</strong> (by means of) <strong> their faith</strong> . Too much stress must not be laid on the difference of the two prepositions (see Rom 3:22 and note). The omission of the art. in ἐκ πίστ . and its expression in διὰ τῆς πίστ . are natural enough: the former expresses the <em> ground</em> of justification, generally taken, ἐκ πίστεως , <em> by faith</em> : the latter the <em> means</em> whereby the man lays hold on justification, διὰ τῆς πίστεως , <em> by his faith</em> : the former is the objective ground, the latter the subjective medium. Jowett’s rendering of περιτομὴν ἐκ πίστεως , ‘ <em> the circumcision that is of faith</em> ,’ though ingenious, is hardly philologically allowable, nor would it correspond to the other member of the sentence, which he rightly renders ‘ <em> and the uncircumcision through their faith</em> .’ To understand τῆς πίστεως (as Mr. Green, Gr. p.300) as referring to πίστεως just mentioned ‘ <em> by the instrumentality of the identical faith which operates in the case of the circumcised</em> ,’ is to contradict the fact: the faith was not, strictly speaking, identical in this sense, or the two cases never need have been distinguished.
