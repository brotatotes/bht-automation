 30.   εἴπερ ]  if at least (if we are to hold to what is manifest as a result of our former argument)  God is One, who shall justify the circumcision (= the Jews, after the analogy of ch. Rom 2:26 )  by ( ἐκ , as the preliminary condition, the state  out of which the justification arises)  faith, and the uncircumcision (the Gentiles)  through (by means of)  their faith . Too much stress must not be laid on the difference of the two prepositions (see Rom 3:22 and note). The omission of the art. in ἐκ πίστ . and its expression in διὰ τῆς πίστ . are natural enough: the former expresses the  ground of justification, generally taken, ἐκ πίστεως ,  by faith : the latter the  means whereby the man lays hold on justification, διὰ τῆς πίστεως ,  by his faith : the former is the objective ground, the latter the subjective medium. Jowett’s rendering of περιτομὴν ἐκ πίστεως , ‘  the circumcision that is of faith ,’ though ingenious, is hardly philologically allowable, nor would it correspond to the other member of the sentence, which he rightly renders ‘  and the uncircumcision through their faith .’ To understand τῆς πίστεως (as Mr. Green, Gr. p.300) as referring to πίστεως just mentioned ‘  by the instrumentality of the identical faith which operates in the case of the circumcised ,’ is to contradict the fact: the faith was not, strictly speaking, identical in this sense, or the two cases never need have been distinguished. See Romans 3:1-2 .
