 31. ] But again the Jew may object, if this is the case, if Faith be the  ground , and Faith the  medium , of justification for all, circumcised or uncircumcised,  surely the law is set aside and made void . That this is not so, the Apostle both here asserts, and is prepared to shew by working out the proposition of Romans 3:29 , that the law itself belonged to a covenant whose  original recipient was justified by faith , and whose main promise was, the  reception and blessing of the Gentiles .
	 νόμον , not ‘  law ,’ but  the law , as every where in the Epistle. We may safely say that the Apostle never argues of  law , abstract, in the sense of  a system of precepts , its attributes or its effects, but always of THE LAW, concrete,  the law of God given by Moses , when speaking of the Jews, as here:  the law of God , in as far as written in their consciences, when speaking of the Gentiles: and when including both,  the law of God generally, His written as well as His unwritten will.
	Many Commentators have taken this verse (being misled in some cases by its place at the end of the chapter) as standing by itself, and have gone into the abstract grounds why faith does not make void the law (or moral obedience); which, however true,  have no place here : the design being to shew that the law itself  contained this very doctrine , and was founded in the promise to Abraham on a covenant embracing Jews and Gentiles, and therefore was not degraded from its dignity by the doctrine, but rather established as a part of God’s dealings, consistent with, explaining, and explained by, the Gospel.
