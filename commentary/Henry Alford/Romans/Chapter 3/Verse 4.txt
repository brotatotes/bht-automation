 4. ]  μὴ γέν  ., let it not be : see reff. The Apostle uses this expression of pious horror, when he has supposed or mentioned any thing by which the honour, truth, or justice of God would be compromised, as here by His covenant-word being broken. It is often found in Polybius, Arrian, and the later Greek writers.
	 γινέσθω κ . τ . λ .] ‘rather let us believe all men on earth to have broken their word and truth, than God His. Whatever becomes of men and their truth,  His truth must stand fast .’
	The citation which follows goes to the depth of the matter. It is the penitent confession of a sinner, that he is sensible how entirely  against God his sin has been, and how clearly his own unworthiness sets God’s judgment against sin vindicated before him. And to this meaning the objection in the next verses is addressed, see below.  That thou mightest be justified (shewn to be just)  in thy sayings (sentences, words of judgment),  and mightest conquer when Thou art judged , בְּשָׁפְטְךָ ‘  in thy judging ,’ which cannot well be our rendering of ἐν τῷ  κρίνεσθαί σε , i.e. ‘when thy dealings are called in question by men.’
