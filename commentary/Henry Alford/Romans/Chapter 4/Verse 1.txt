<b> 1. What then</b>] The Apostle is here contending with those under the law<i> from their own standing-point</i>: and he follows up his assertion that his argument<i> established the law</i>, by<b> what therefore</b> ( ‘this being conceded,’ ‘seeing that you and I are both upholders of the law’)<b> shall we</b> say, &c. This verse, and the argument following, are not a<i> proof</i>, but a<i> consequence</i>, of<i> we establish the law</i>, and are therefore introduced, not with<i> for</i>, but with<b> then</b> or<b> therefore</b>.<br><br><b> hath found</b>] viz.<i> towards his justification</i>, or more strictly,<i> earned</i> as his own, to boast of The clause,<b> as pertaining to the flesh</b>, belongs to the verb<b> hath found</b>, not to the appellation “<i>our father</i>”? I have, in order to make this clear, transposed them. For the course and spirit of the argument is not to limit the paternity of Abraham to a mere fleshly one, but to shew that he was the spiritual father of all believers. And the question is not one which requires any such distinction between his fleshly and spiritual paternity (as in ch. ix. 3, 5). his being so, w<i> hat do the words</i><b> as pertaining to the flesh</b><i> mean?</i> They cannot allude to<i> circumcision</i>; for that is rendered improbable, not only by the parallel expression “<i>by works</i>” (ver. 2) in the<i> plural</i>, but also by the consideration, that circumcision was no<i> work</i> at all, but a<i> seal of the righteousness which he had by faith</i> being yet uncircumcised (ver. 11),—and by the whole course of the argument in the present place, which is not to disprove the exclusive privilege of the Jew (that having been already done, chapters ii. iii.), but to shew that<i> the father and head of the race himself was justified not by works but by faith</i>. Doubtless, in so far as circumcision was a mere<i> work of obedience</i>, it might be in a loose way considered as falling under that category: but it came<i> after</i> justification, and so is<i> chronologically</i> here excluded.<br><br><b> As pertaining to the flesh</b> then is in contrast to<i> as pertaining to the spirit</i>,—and refers to<i> that department of our being from which spring works</i>, in contrast with<i> that in which is the exercise of faith</i>: see ch. viii. 4, 5.
