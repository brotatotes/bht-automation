 1.   οὖν ] The Apostle is here contending with those under the law  from their own standing-point : and he follows up his νόμον ἱστάνομεν , by  what therefore (‘hoc concesso,’ ‘seeing that you and I are both upholders of the law’)  shall we say , &c. This verse, and the argument following, are not a  proof , but a  consequence , of νόμον ἱστ ., and are therefore introduced, not with  γάρ , but with  οὖν .
	 εὑρηκέναι [if read]] viz.  towards his justification , or more strictly,  earned as his own, to boast of.
	 κατὰ σάρκα belongs to  εὑρ ., not (as Chrys., Theophyl., Erasm.) to  προπάτορα ἡμ . For the course and spirit of the argument is not to limit the paternity of Abraham to a mere fleshly one, but to shew that he was the spiritual father of all believers. And the question is not one which requires any such distinction between his fleshly and spiritual paternity (as in ch. Romans 9:3 , Rom 9:5 ). This being so,  what does  κατὰ σάρκα  mean ? It cannot allude to  circumcision ; for that is rendered improbable, not only by the parallel expression ἐξ ἔργων in the  plural , but also by the consideration, that circumcision was no ἔργον at all, but a  seal of the righteousness which he had by faith being yet uncircumcised ( Rom 4:11 ), and by the whole course of the argument in the present place, which is not to disprove the exclusive privilege of the Jew (that having been already done, chs. 2. 3.), but to shew that  the father and head of the race himself was justified not by works, but by faith . Doubtless, in so far as circumcision was a mere  work of obedience , it might be in a loose way considered as falling under that category: but it came  after justification, and so is  chronologically here excluded.  κατὰ σάρκα then is in contrast to κατὰ πνεῦμα , and refers to  that department of our being from which spring works , in contrast with  that in which is the exercise of faith : see ch. Romans 8:4 , Romans 8:5 .
