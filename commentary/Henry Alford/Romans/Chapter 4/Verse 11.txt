<b> 11.</b>]<b> And he received</b> (from God)<b> the sign</b> (token, or symbol)<b> of circumcision, a seal</b> (the Targum on Song of Solom. iii. 8, has the expression, ‘the seal of circumcision.’ So also Baptism is called sometimes<i> the seal of the font</i>, and often in the Fathers simply<i> the seal</i>)<b> of the righteousness</b> (to stamp, and certify the righteousness)<b> of the faith</b>. (i. e. ‘of the righteousness which consisted in his faith,’—not, ‘of his justification by faith;’ the present argument treats of faith<i> accounted</i> as righteousness)<b> which he had while in his uncircumcision</b>. In literal historical matter of fact, Abraham received circumcision as a seal of<i> the covenant</i> between God and him (Gen. xvii 1–14). But this covenant was only a<i> renewal of that very one</i>,<i> on the promise of which Abraham’s faith was exercised</i>, Gen. xv. 5, 6,—and each successive renewal of which was a fresh approval of that faith. The Apostle’s point is,—that the righteousness was reckoned, and the promise made, to Abraham,<i> not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</i><br><br><b> in order that he might he the father of all in uncircumcision that believe</b>] Abraham is<i> the father of the faithful</i>. But the triumph and recognition of that faith whereby he was constituted so, was not during his circumcision, but during his uncircumcision:—therefore<i> the faithful, his descendants, must not be confined to the circumcised, but must take in the uncircumcised also</i>.—On the appellation father in this sense, Tholuck compares the expression Gen. iv. 20; 1 Macc. ii. 54, “<i>Phinees, our father in being zealous and fervent</i>,” and a saying of Maimonides, “Moses is the father of all the prophets who succeeded him.” See also our Lord’s saying, John viii. 37, 39. One of the Rabbinical books has a sentiment remarkably coincident with that in our text: “Abraham is the father of all those who follow his faith.”<br><br><b> that the righteousness might be reckoned unto them also]</b> This is in<i> fact</i> parenthetical, whether brackets are used or not; for otherwise the construction from the former to the latter word<b> the father</b> would not proceed.<b> The righteousness</b>, namely, that which Abraham’s faith was reckoned as being,—the righteousness of God, then hidden though imputed, but now revealed in Jesus Christ.
