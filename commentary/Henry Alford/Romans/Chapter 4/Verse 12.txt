 12.  καὶ ( εἰς τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν )  πατέρα περιτομῆς  .… ]  And (that he might be)  father of the circumcision (the circumcised)  to those (dat. commodi ‘for those,’ ‘in the case of those’)  who are not only (physically)  of the circumcision, but also who walk (the inversion of the article appears to be in order to bring out more markedly τοῖς ἐκ περιτ . and τοῖς στοιχ ., who are not only οἱ ἐκ περιτ ., but also οἱ στοιχοῦντες .…)  in the footsteps (reff.)  of the faith of our father (speaking here as a Jew)  Abraham (which he had)  while he was in uncircumcision . (The art. would make it ‘during his uncircumcision,’ but the sense is better without it, the word being generalized.)
