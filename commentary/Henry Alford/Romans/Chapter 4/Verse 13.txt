<b> 13.</b>] The argumentation is an expansion of the expression “<i>father of all that believe</i>” above. If these believers are Abraham’s seed, then his promised inheritance is<i> theirs</i>.<br><br><b> through the law</b>] not, ‘<i>under the law</i>,’—nor, ‘<i>by works of the l</i> aw—nor, ‘<i>by the righteousness of the law</i>:’ but,<b> through the law</b>, so that the law should be the<i> ground</i>, or<i> efficient cause</i>, or medium, of the promise. None of these it was, as matter of historical fact.—<b>For not through the law was the promise</b> (made)<b> to Abraham, or to his seed, viz. that he should he heir of the world, but by the righteousness of faith</b>. This specification of the promise has perplexed most of the commentators. The actual promise, Gen. (xii, 2, 3) xiii, 14–17; xv. 18; xvii. 8, was the possession of the<i> land of Canaan</i>. But the Rabbis already had seen, and St. Paul, who had been brought up in their learning, held fast the truth,—that much more was intended in the words which accompany this promise, “In thee (or in thy seed) shall all families of the earth be blessed,” than the mere possession of Canaan. They distinctly trace the gift of the world to Abraham to<i> this promise</i>, not to the foregoing. They say, “The garden is the world, which God delivered to Abraham, to whom it was said, ‘<i>And thou shalt be a blessing</i>” The<i> inheritance of the world</i> then is not the possession of Canaan merely, either<i> literally</i>, or as a<i> type</i> of a better possession,—but that ultimate<i> lordship over the whole world</i> which Abraham, as the father of the faithful in all peoples, and Christ, as the of Promise, shall possess: the<i> former</i> figuratively indeed and only implicitly,<i> latter</i> personally and actually. See ch. viii. 17; Matt. v. 5; 2 Tim. ii. 12; 1 Cor. xy. 24.—Another difficulty, that this promise was<i> made</i> chronologically<i> before</i> the reckoning of his faith for righteousness, is easily removed by remembering that. the (indefinite) making of the promise is here treated of as the<i> whole process of its assertion</i>, during which Abraham’s faith was shewn, and the promise continually confirmed.
