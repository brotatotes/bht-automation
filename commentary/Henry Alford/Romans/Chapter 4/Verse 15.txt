<b> 15.</b>]<b> For the law worketh</b> (brings about, gives occasion to)<b> wrath</b> (which from its v nature excludes<i> promise</i>, which is an of grace,—and<i> faith</i>, which is an attribute of<i> confidence</i>):—<b>but where</b> (the “<i>for</i>” in the A.V. has perhaps been introduced to suit the idea of the second clanse rendering a reason for the first)<b> there is no law</b> (lit. ‘<i>where the law is not</i>’),<b> neither is there transgression</b>. “We should rather expect (says De Wette) the affirmative clause,*And where the law is, there is transgression:’ but the negative refers to the time<br><br> before the Mosaic law, when there was no transgression and therefore also no wrath.” Yes; but not because there was<i> no</i> transgression then; the purpose of the Apostle here is not to deny the existence of the law of God written in the heart (which itself brings in the knowledge of sin) before Moses, but to shew that no promise of inheritance can be by the law, because the property of the law the more it is promulgated, to<i> reveal transgression</i> more,—<i>not to unfold grace</i>. So that<i> comparatively</i> (see notes on ch. vii.) there was no transgression before the law of Moses; and if we conceive a state in which the law should he<i> altogether absent</i>, whether written or unwritten (as in the brute creation), there would he<i> no transgression whatever</i>.—But observe (see ch. v. 12–14) that this reasoning does not touch the doctrine of the original taint of our nature in Adam,—only referring to the discrimination of acts, words, and thoughts by the conscience<i> in the light of the law</i>: for TRANSGRESSION is not<i> natural corruption</i>, but<i> an act of transgression</i>: nor does the Apostle here deny the former, even in the imaginable total absence of the law of God.
