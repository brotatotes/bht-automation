<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] <strong> For the law works</strong> (brings about, gives occasion to) <strong> wrath</strong> (which from its very nature, excludes <em> promise</em> , which is an act of <em> grace</em> , and <em> faith</em> , which is an attribute of <em> confidence</em> ); <strong> but where</strong> (or, <em> for where</em> ; but <strong> I</strong> should regard <strong> γάρ</strong> as introduced to suit the idea of the second clause rendering a reason for the first) <strong> there is no law</strong> (lit. ‘ <em> where the law is not</em> ’), <strong> neither</strong> (is there) <strong> transgression</strong> . ‘We should rather expect (says De W.) the affirmative clause, “And where the law is, there is transgression:” but the negative refers to the time before the Mosaic law, when there was no transgression and therefore also no wrath.’ <em> Yes</em> ; but not because there was <em> no</em> transgression then; the purpose of the Apostle here is not to deny the existence of the law of God written in the heart (which itself brings in the knowledge of sin) before Moses, but to shew that no promise of inheritance can be by the law, because the property of the law is, the more it is promulgated, to <em> reveal transgression</em> more, <em> not to unfold grace</em> . So that <em> comparatively</em> (see notes on ch. 7) there was no transgression before the law of Moses; and if we conceive a state in which the law whether written or unwritten should be <em> altogether absent</em> (as in the brute creation), there would be <em> no transgression whatever</em> .

<p>But observe (see ch. Rom 5:12-14 ) that this reasoning does not touch the doctrine of the original taint of our nature in Adam, only referring to the discrimination of acts, words, and thoughts by the conscience <em> in the light of the law:</em> for <strong> παράβασις</strong> is not <em> natural corruption</em> , but <em> an act of transgression</em> : nor does the Apostle here deny the former, even in the imaginable total absence of the law of God.</p>
