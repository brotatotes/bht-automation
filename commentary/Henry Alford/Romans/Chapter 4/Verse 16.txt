<b> 16.</b>]<b> For this</b> (viz. the following)<b> cause it</b> (no word is supplied in the original; but we must understand the<i> inheritance</i>,—not the<i> promise</i>; the promise was not strictly speaking<i> of faith</i>; nor must we supply<i> they were</i>, meaning the heirs, who although they might fairly be said to be<i> of faith</i>, could hardly be without harshness described as being<i> by grace</i>)<b> was of faith, that it might be</b> (strictly the<i> purpose</i>;—not, ‘so that it was’)<b> by</b> (<b>according to</b>)<b> grace</b> (free unmerited favour. As the<i> law</i>, bringing the<i> knowledge of guilt</i>, works<i> wrath</i>,—so the<i> promise</i>, awakening<i> faith</i>, manifests God’s<i> free grace</i>,—the end for which it was given);<b> in order that the promise may be sure</b> (not, ‘so that the promise was sure?’ this was the<i> result</i>, but the Apostle states this as the aim and end of the inheritance being by faith,—as regarded<i> the seed of Abraham</i>,—that they all might be inheritors,—as the manifestation of God’s grace was the higher aim and end)<b> to all the seed, not only to that</b> (part of it)<b> which is of the law</b> (see ver. 14),<b> but to that also which is of the faith</b> (walks in the steps of the faith, ver. 12)<b> of Abraham</b>. The part of the seed which is of the law<i> here</i> is of course confined to believing Jews;<i> the seed</i> being<i> believers only</i>. This has been sometimes lost sight, of, and the whole argument of vv. 13–16 treated as if it applied to the doctrine of justification by faith without the works of the law, a point<i> already proved, and now presupposed</i>,—the present argument being an historical and metaphysical one, proceeding on the facts of Abraham’s history, and the natures respectively of the law and grace, to prove him to be the father of all believers, uncircumcised as well as circumcised.<br><br><b> who is the father of us all</b>] By the last declaration the<i> paternity</i> of Abraham, which is co-extensive with the<i> inheritance</i>, has been extended to<i> all who are of his fait</i> h; here therefore it is reasserted:<b> us</b> meaning<b> believers</b>.<b> 17. as it is written</b>] The words (ref.) are spoken of the numerous progeny of A ham according to the flesh: but not out a reference to that covenant, according to the terms of which all nations were to be blessed in him. The Apostle<i> may</i> here cite it as comparing his natural paternity of many nations with his spiritual one of all believers: but it seems more probable that he regards the prophecy as<i> directly announcing</i> a paternity far more extensive than mere physical fact substantiated.— ‘These words are parenthetical, being merely a confirmation by Scripture testimony of the words foregoing, with which (see below) the following words are immediately connected.<br><br><b> before God in whose sight he believed</b>] ‘he meaning appears to be, ‘Abraham was the father of us all,—though not physically, nor in actuality, seeing that we were not as yet,—yet<i> in the sight and estimation of God</i>,—in his relation with God, with whom no obstacles of nature or time have force.’<br><br><b> who quickeneth the dead</b>] A general description of God’s almighty creative power (see 1 Tim. vi. 13), applied particularly to the matter in hand—the deadness of generative physical power in Abraham himself, which was quickened by God. The peculiar excellence of Abraham’s faith was, that it overleaped the obstacles of physical incapacity, and non-entity, and believed implicitly God’s promise. Comp. 2 Cor. i. 9.<br><br><b> and calleth those things which be not as though they were</b>] Much difficulty has been found here: and principally owing to an idea that this clause must minutely correspond with the former, and furnish another instance of God’s creative Almightiness. Hence Commentators have given to<b> call</b> the sense which it has sometimes, ‘<i>to summon into being</i>, and have understood<i> as though they were</i> as if it were<i> so as to be</i>. I see however in this latter clause not a repetition or expansion of the former, but a new attribute of God’s omnipotence and eternity, on which Abraham’s faith was fixed.<b> Who calleth</b> (nameth, speaketh of)<b> the things that are not as being</b> (as if they<i> were</i>). This He<i> did in the present case with regard to the seed of Abraham</i>, which<i> did not as yet exist</i>:—the two key-texts to this word and clause being,<i> In Isaac shall thy seed</i><b> be called</b>, ch. ix. 8 (see note there),—and Acts vii. 5,<i> He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him</i>,<b> when as yet he had no child</b>. These<i> children</i>, which were at present in the category of<i> things that were not</i>, and the nations which should spring, physically or spiritually, from him, God<i> called as though they were, spoke of as having an existence</i>, which word Abraham believed. And here, as in the other clause, the<i> calling the things</i><br><br><i> which be not as though they were</i>, is not confined to the case in point, but is a general attribute of all God’s words concerning things of time: past, present, and future, being to His Omnipotence and Omniscience,<i> all one</i>. His purposes,<i> when formed</i>, are<i> accomplished</i>, save in so far as that evolution of secondary causes and effects intervenes, which is also His purpose. This also Abraham apprehended by his faith, which rested on God’s absolute power to do what He had promised (see below).
