<b> 16.</b>]<b> For this</b> (viz. the following)<b> cause it</b> (no word is supplied in the original; but we must understand the<i> inheritance</i>,—not the<i> promise</i>; the promise was not strictly speaking<i> of faith</i>; nor must we supply<i> they were</i>, meaning the heirs, who although they might fairly be said to be<i> of faith</i>, could hardly be without harshness described as being<i> by grace</i>)<b> was of faith, that it might be</b> (strictly the<i> purpose</i>;—not, ‘so that it was’)<b> by</b> (<b>according to</b>)<b> grace</b> (free unmerited favour. As the<i> law</i>, bringing the<i> knowledge of guilt</i>, works<i> wrath</i>,—so the<i> promise</i>, awakening<i> faith</i>, manifests God’s<i> free grace</i>,—the end for which it was given);<b> in order that the promise may be sure</b> (not, ‘so that the promise was sure?’ this was the<i> result</i>, but the Apostle states this as the aim and end of the inheritance being by faith,—as regarded<i> the seed of Abraham</i>,—that they all might be inheritors,—as the manifestation of God’s grace was the higher aim and end)<b> to all the seed, not only to that</b> (part of it)<b> which is of the law</b> (see ver. 14),<b> but to that also which is of the faith</b> (walks in the steps of the faith, ver. 12)<b> of Abraham</b>. The part of the seed which is of the law<i> here</i> is of course confined to believing Jews;<i> the seed</i> being<i> believers only</i>. This has been sometimes lost sight, of, and the whole argument of vv. 13–16 treated as if it applied to the doctrine of justification by faith without the works of the law, a point<i> already proved, and now presupposed</i>,—the present argument being an historical and metaphysical one, proceeding on the facts of Abraham’s history, and the natures respectively of the law and grace, to prove him to be the father of all believers, uncircumcised as well as circumcised.
