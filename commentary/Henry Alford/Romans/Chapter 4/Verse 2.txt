<b> 2.</b>]<b> For if Abraham was justified</b> (not, ‘were justified,’ as in A.V.: it is assumed, asa fact known to all, that he<i> was justified</i> by some means)<b> by works, he hath ground of boasting</b> (not expressed here whether<i> in the sight of men,</i> or<i> of God</i>, but taken generally: the proposition being assumed, ‘He that has earned justification by works, has whereof to<i> boast</i>’). Then in disproof of this,—that Abraham has matter of boasting,—whatever<i> men</i> might think of him, or attribute to him (for example, the perfect keeping of the law, as the Jews did), one thing at least is clear,<i> that he has none before</i> (in the. presence of)<i> God</i>. This we can prove (ver. 3),<b> for what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God</b> (God’s promise),<b> and it</b> (<b>his believing</b>)<b> was reckoned unto him for</b> (ch. ii. 26)<b> righteousness</b>.—The whole question so much mooted between Protestants on the one hand, and Romanists, Arminians, and Sovinians on the other, as to whether this righteousness was reckoned (1)<i> by means of faith</i>, being<i> God's righteousness imputed</i> to the sinner; or (2)<i> on account of faith</i>, so that God made Abraham<i> righteous on account of the merit of his faith</i>, lies in fact in a small compass, if what has gone before be properly taken into account. The Apostle has proved Jews and Gentiles to be<i> all under sin</i>: utterly unable by works of their own to attain to righteousness. Now<i> faith</i>, in the second sense mentioned above, is strictly and entirely<i> a work</i>, and as such would be the<i> efficient cause</i> of man’s justification,—which, by what has preceded,<i> it cannot be</i>. It will therefore follow, that it was not the<i> act of believing</i> which was reckoned to him as a righteous act, or on account of which perfect righteousness was laid to his charge, but that the<i> fact of his trusting God to perform His promise introduced kim into the blessing promised</i>. God declared his purpose (Gen. xii. 3) of blessing all the families of the earth in Abraham, and again (Gen. xv. 5) that his seed should be as the stars heaven, when as yet he had no son, Abra-ham<i> believed this promise</i>,<i> and became partaker of this blessing</i>. But this bless-ing was,<i> justification by faith in Christ</i>. Now Abraham could not, in the strict ‘sense of the words, be justified by faith<i> in Christ</i>,—nor is it necessary to suppose that he directed his faith forward to the promised Redeemer in Person; but in so far as God’s gracious purpose was revealed to him, he grasped it by faith, and that righteousness which was implied, so far, in it, was imputed to him, Some have said (for example, Tholuck) that the parallel is incomplete—Abraham’s<i> faith</i> having been reckoned to him for righteousness, whereas, in our case,<i> the righteousness of Christ</i> reckoned to us as our righteousness,<i> by</i> faith. But the incompleteness lies in the nature of the respective cases. In his case, the<i> righteousness itself</i> was not yet manifested. He believed<i> implicitly</i>, taking the<i> promise, with all it involved and implied, as true</i>. This then was his way of entering into the promise, and by means of his faith was bestowed upon him that full justification which that faith never apprehended. Thus<i> his faith itself</i>, the mere fact of implicit trust in God, was counted to<i> him</i> for righteousness. But though<i> the same righteousness</i> is imputed to us who believe, and by means of faith also, it is no longer the mere fact of believing implicitly in God’s truth, but the reception of<i> Christ Jesus the Lord</i> by faith, which justifies us (see verses 23–25 and note). As it was then the realization of God’s words by faith, so now: but<i> we</i> have the<i> Person of the Lord Jesus for the object of faith</i>, explicitly revealed:<i> he had not</i>. In both cases justification is<i> gratuitous</i>, and is<i> by faith</i>: and so far, which is as far as the argument here requires, the parallel is strict and complete.
