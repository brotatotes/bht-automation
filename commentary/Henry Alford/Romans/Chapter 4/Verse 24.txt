 24. ]  ἐκ νεκρῶν is almost (see Colossians 2:12 ; 1Th 1:10 ) always anarthrous, as indeed νεκροί sometimes is (for ‘the dead’) in classic writers, e.g. Thucyd. iv. 14; Romans 4:10 , end: and see Winer, edn. 6, § 19. 1. The omission may in this phrase be accounted for by the preposition (Middleton, ch. vi. 1): but I suspect Winer is right in looking for the cause of the absence of the article after prepositions rather in the usage of the particular  substantive than in any idiom of general application.
