<p><strong> 24.</strong> ] <strong> ἐκ νεκρῶν</strong> is almost (see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span> ; 1Th 1:10 ) always anarthrous, as indeed νεκροί sometimes is (for ‘the dead’) in classic writers, e.g. Thucyd. iv. 14; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:10">Romans 4:10</span> , end: and see Winer, edn. 6, § 19. 1. The omission may in this phrase be accounted for by the preposition (Middleton, ch. vi. 1): but I suspect Winer is right in looking for the cause of the absence of the article after prepositions rather in the usage of the particular <em> substantive</em> than in any idiom of general application.</p>
