 4.   τῷ ἐργαζομ  . ] (q. d. τῷ ἐργάτῃ , but the part. is used because of the negative τῷ μὴ ἐργαζ . following)  to the workman (him that works for hire, that earns wages, compare προσηργάσατο , Luk 19:16 )  his wages are not reckoned according to (as a matter of)  grace (favour),  but according to (as a matter of)  debt . The stress is on κατὰ χάριν , not on λογίζεται , which in this first member of the sentence, is used hardly in the strict sense, of  imputing or  reckoning , but of  allotting or  apportioning : its use being occasioned by the stricter λογίζεται below. And the sentence is a  general one, not with any peculiar reference to Abraham, except that after κατὰ χάριν we may supply ὡς τῷ Ἀβραάμ , if we will; for this is evidently assumed.
