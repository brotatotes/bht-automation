 1.]<b> Being therefore justified</b> ( ‘<i>having been justified</i>:’—it is an<i> act past</i> on the Christian, not like sanctification, an abiding and increasing work) by (as the ground)<b> faith, we</b> (believers in Christ)<b> have</b> (almost all our most ancient authorities read for<b> we have, let us have</b>. The difference in Greck is only that of one letter, the long ‘<i>o</i>,’ or omega, for the short ‘<i>o</i>,’ or omicron. And these two letters are frequently confused in our old manuscripts: so that it may even be doubted whether we can call this a real variation in reading, after all. Certainly in judging between the two, as to which, in this uncertainty of evidence, was most likely to have been written by St. Paul, the indicative have, seems to be the preferable form. For the whole passage is<i> declaratory of the consequences flowing from justification by faith, and does not exhort, but assert</i>. Nor would it seem, does the place tur exh tion arrive, till these consequences been in the fullest and freest mammer set forth,—indeed so fully and freely, that the objection arising from their supposed abuse has first to be answered, Add to this that the verbs following are in the indicative, which makes it probable that this also would be)<b> peace</b> ( ‘reconcilement;’ the opposite of wrath, see ver. 9) with ( ‘in regard of’)<b> God through</b> (by means of)<b> our Lord Jesus Christ</b>. With regard to the nature of this peace,— ‘s<i> tate of reconciliation</i>,’ ‘no more condemnation,’ as ch. viii. 1,—we may remark, that it regards here the objective fact of God’s reconciliation to us, not as yet the subjective one of our reconciliation to Him: see this fully shewn below in ver. 10.
