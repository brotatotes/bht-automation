<b> 10.</b>] The same is substantiated in another form: ‘we were enemies (see below) when He died and reconciled us: much more now that we have been reconciled, and He lives, shall we by His life be saved.’—<b>For if, being enemies</b> (the meaning of<b> enemies</b> may either be active, as Eph. ii. 15; Col. i. 21, ‘<i>haters of God</i>’ so ‘<i>enmity</i>,’ ch. viii. 7: or passive, as ch. xi. 28,—<i>hated by God</i>.’ But here the latter meaning alone can apply, for the Apostle is speaking of the Death of Christ and its effects as applied to all time, not merely to those believers who then lived: and those unborn at the death of Christ could not have been enemies in the active sense),<b> we were reconciled</b> (this expression also may be taken in two ways. It may be said of<i> giving up anger against any one</i>,—see 1 Cor. vii. 11, or of<i> being received into favour by any one</i>, see 1 Sam. xxix. 4,—the latter off which meanings,<i> were received into favour with God</i>, must, for the reason above given,<b> be here adopted) to God through</b> (by means of)<b> the death of his Son</b> (this great fact is further explained and insisted on, in the rest of the chapter),<b> much more, having been reconciled</b> (but here comes in the assumption that the corresponding subjective part of reconciliation has been accomplished, viz. justification by faith: comp. 2 Cor. v. 19, 20, “<i>God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself</i>:...<i> we pray you in Christ's behalf, be ye reconciled to God</i>.” Both these, the objective reception into God’s favour by the death of Christ, and the subjective appropriation, by faith, of that reception, are included),<b> shall we be saved through</b> (hy means of)<b> his life</b> (not here<i> that which he now does</i> on our behalf, but simply<i> the fact of His Life</i>, so much enlarged on in ch. vi.: and our sharing in it).
