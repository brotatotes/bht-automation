<b> 12.</b>] This verse is one of acknowledged difficulty. The two questions meeting us directly are (1) To what does<b> for this cause</b> refer? (2)<b> As</b> may introduce the<i> first</i> member of a comparison,<i> the second being to be discovered</i>; or may introduce the<i> second</i>, the<i> first having to be discovered</i>. I shall endeavour to answer both questions in connexion. (1) I conceive<b> for this cause</b> to refer to that blessed state of confidence and hope just described: ‘on this account,’ ‘seeing these things are so,’ ‘this state of things, thus brought about, will justify the following analogy.’ Thus we must take<b> as</b> either (a) as beginning the comparison, and then supply, ‘so Christ in His Resurrection came justification into the world, and by justification, life;’ or (b) as concluding the comparison, and supply before it, ‘it was,’ or ‘Christ wrought.’ This latter method seems to me far the best. For none of the endeavours of Commentators to supply the second limb of the comparison from the following verses have succeeded: and we can hardly suppose such an ellipsis, when the next following comparison (ver. 16) is rather a<i> weakening</i> than a strengthening the analogy. We have example for this use of “<i>as</i>” in Matt. xxv. 14 [see the passage in this work], and<b> even as</b>, Gal. iii. 6.—<b>Consequently</b> (the method of God’s procedure in introducing life by righteousness resembled the introduction of death by sin: ‘it was’),<b> like as by one man</b> (the Apostle regards the<i> man</i> as involving generic succession and transmitting the corrupt seed of sin,<i> not the woman</i>: but when he speaks of the<i> personal</i> share which each had in the transgression, 1 Tim. ii. 14, he says, ‘Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression’),<b> sin</b> (as a POWER ruling over mankind, see ch. iii. 9, and ver. 21,—partly as a<i> principle</i> which exists in us all, and developes itself in our conduct, partly as a<i> state</i> in which we are involved; but the idea here must not be<i> confined</i> to<i> original</i><i> sin</i>, as it reaches much wider, to sin both original and actual:<i> nor to the habit of sinning</i>: nor is it merely the<i> propensity io sin</i>: nor is sin<i> personified</i> merely, as in ch. vii. 8, 11)<b> entered into the world</b> (not<i> begun to be, was first committed</i>, as some Commentators: but<i> literally</i>,— ‘entered into,’ ‘gained access into,’ the<i> moral world</i>,—for sin involves moral responsibility. So Gal. iii. 23, ‘before the faith<i> came in</i>’),<b> and by means of sin</b> (as the appointed penalty for sin, Gen. ii. 17; iii. 19),<b> death</b> (primarily, but not<i> only</i>, physical death: as<i> sin, so death</i>, is<i> general</i>, including the lesser in the greater, i. e:<i> spiritual and eternal death</i>. See ch. vi. 16, 21; vii. 10; viii. 6; 2 Cor. vii. 10);<b> and thus</b> (by this entering in of sin and death; i.e. in fact, by this<i> connexion of sin and death</i>, as's by the clause following, “<i>for that all sin sinned</i>”’)<b> death spread through unto all men</b> (see reff. De Wette well says that “<i>all men</i>” differs from “<i>the world</i>,” as the concrete part from the abstract whole, and “entered” from “spread through,” as the going from house to house differs from the entering a town),<b> because</b> (literally, ‘<i>on ground of</i>,’ ‘<i>on condition that</i>,’ which meaning, if rightly applied, suits the case in hand.<i> Life</i> depended on a certain condition, viz. obedience:<i> Death</i> on another, viz. disobedience. Mankind have disobeyed: the condition of Death’s entrance and diffusion bas been fulfilled: Death extended to all men, as a consequence of the fact, that all have sinned)<b> all sinned</b> (see ch. iii, 23:—not ‘<i>were sinful</i>, or ‘<i>were born in sin</i>, as Calvin would restrict the meaning:<i> sin</i>, as above remarked, is here, throughout, both<i> original</i> and<i> actual</i>: in the<i> seed</i>, as planted in the nature by the sin of our forefather: and in the<i> fruit</i>, as developed by each conscious responsible individual in his own practice. So that Calvin’s argument, “that here there is no question of<i> actual sin</i>, because if each man is to be treated as guilty in himself, why should Paul compare Adam with Christ?” does not apply, and the objection is answered by St. Paul himself, where he says, distinguishing between the<i> trespass</i> and the<i> free gift</i> below, vv. 15, 16, the free gift came of many trespasses unto justification. The<i> trespass</i> was not only that of one, the original cause of the entry of sin, but the often repeated sins of individual men). Observe how entirely this assertion of the Apostle contradicts the Pelagian or<i> individualistic</i> view of men, that each is a separate creation from God, existing solely on his own exclusive responsibility,—and affirms the Augustinian or<i> traducian</i> view, that all are evolved by God’s appointment from an original stock, and, though individually responsible, are generically involved in the corruption and condemnation of their original.
