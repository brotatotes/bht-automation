<b> 12.</b>] This verse is one of acknowledged difficulty. The two questions meeting us directly are (1) To what does<b> for this cause</b> refer? (2)<b> As</b> may introduce the<i> first</i> member of a comparison,<i> the second being to be discovered</i>; or may introduce the<i> second</i>, the<i> first having to be discovered</i>. I shall endeavour to answer both questions in connexion. (1) I conceive<b> for this cause</b> to refer to that blessed state of confidence and hope just described: ‘on this account,’ ‘seeing these things are so,’ ‘this state of things, thus brought about, will justify the following analogy.’ Thus we must take<b> as</b> either (a) as beginning the comparison, and then supply, ‘so Christ in His Resurrection came justification into the world, and by justification, life;’ or (b) as concluding the comparison, and supply before it, ‘it was,’ or ‘Christ wrought.’ This latter method seems to me far the best. For none of the endeavours of Commentators to supply the second limb of the comparison from the following verses have succeeded: and we can hardly suppose such an ellipsis, when the next following comparison (ver. 16) is rather a<i> weakening</i> than a strengthening the analogy. We have example for this use of “<i>as</i>” in Matt. xxv. 14 [see the passage in this work], and<b> even as</b>, Gal. iii. 6.—<b>Consequently</b> (the method of God’s procedure in introducing life by righteousness resembled the introduction of death by sin: ‘it was’),<b> like as by one man</b> (the Apostle regards the<i> man</i> as involving generic succession and transmitting the corrupt seed of sin,<i> not the woman</i>: but when he speaks of the<i> personal</i> share which each had in the transgression, 1 Tim. ii. 14, he says, ‘Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression’),<b> sin</b> (as a POWER ruling over mankind, see ch. iii. 9, and ver. 21,—partly as a<i> principle</i> which exists in us all, and developes itself in our conduct, partly as a<i> state</i> in which we are involved; but the idea here must not be<i> confined</i> to<i> original</i>
