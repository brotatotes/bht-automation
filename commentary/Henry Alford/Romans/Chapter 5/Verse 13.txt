<b> 13.</b>] How, consistently wish ch, iv. 15 could all men sin,<i> before the law</i>? This is now explained.—<b>For up to (the time of) the law</b> (equivalent to “<i>from Adam to Moses</i>,” ver. 14),<b> there was sin in the world</b> ( ‘men sinned,’ see Gen. vi. 5–13; committed actual sin: not, men were<i> accounted</i> sinners because of Adam’s sin: the Apostle reminds us of the<i> historical fact</i>, that<i> there was sin in the world</i> during this period):<b> but sin is not reckoned</b> (as transgression)<b> where the law is not</b>. This word<b> imputed</b> has given rise to much dispute. Very many Commentators explain it of<i> consciousness of sin by the sinner himself</i>, as in ch. vii. 7: but (1) this is not the natural sense of the word, which implies TWO parties, one of whom sets down something to the account of the other: (2) this interpretation would bring in a new and irrelevant element,—for the Apostle is not speaking in this chapter at all of<i> subjective human consciousness</i>, but throughout of<i> objective truths with regard to the divine dealings</i>: and (3) it would be altogether inconsistent with the declarations of ch. ii. 15,—where the consciousness of sin on the part of those who had not the law is distinctly asserted.—I am persuaded that the right sense is<b> imputed</b>, ‘<i>set down as transgression</i>,— ‘put in formal account,”<i> by God</i>. In the ease of those who had not the written law, sin is not formally reckoned as<i> transgression</i>, set over against the command: but in a certain sense, as distinctly proved ch. ii. 9–16, it is<i> reckoned</i> and they are condemned for it. Nor is there any inconsistency in this view. Other passages of Paul’s writings support and elucidate it. He states the object of the law to be, ch. vii. 13, t<i> hat sin may by the commandment become exceeding sinful</i>. The revelation of the law<i> exaggerated</i>, brought into prominent and formal manifestation, the sinfulness of sin, which<i> was before culpable and punishable</i>, but in a less degree. With this view also agree Acts xvii. 30; ch. ii. 12; and iii. 25, in so far as they state an analogous case. The objection to taking the words<i> relatively</i>, ‘<i>is not fully reckoned</i>,’ will hardly be urged by those who bear in mind the Apostle’s habit of constantly<i> stating relative truths as positive</i>, omitting the qualifying particles: see, for example, ch. vii. 7, where with the words “sin,” and “<i>I had not known</i>,” both, we must supply qualifications (see notes there).
