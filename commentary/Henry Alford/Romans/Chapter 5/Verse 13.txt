<p><strong> 13.</strong> ] How, consistently with ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span> , could all men sin, <em> before the law</em> ? This is now explained. <strong> For up to (the time of) the law</strong> (= ἀπὸ Ἀδ . μέχρι Μωυς . <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:14">Romans 5:14</span> ; not ‘ <em> during the time of the law</em> ,’ as Orig [33] , Chrys., τοῦ νόμου δοθέντος , … ἕως ὁ νόμος ἦν , Theodoret, an allowable rendering of the words, but manifestly inconsistent with the sense; nor, ‘ <em> as far as there was law, there was sin</em> ,’ as Dr. Burton, which is both inadmissible from the μέχρι Μωυσέως following, and would not answer to the simple matter of fact, ἦν ἐν κόσμῳ ) <strong> there was sin in the world</strong> (‘men sinned,’ see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ge+6:5-13">Genesis 6:5-13</span> ; committed actual sin: not, men were <em> accounted</em> sinners because of Adam’s sin; the Apostle reminds us of the <em> historical fact</em> , that <em> there was sin in the world</em> during this period): <strong> but sin is not reckoned</strong> (as transgression) <strong> where the law is not</strong> .

<p><strong> ἐλλογεῖται</strong> has given rise to much dispute. Very many Commentators (Aug [34] , Ambr [35] , Luth., Melanc., Calv., Beza, Rückert, Tholuck, Stuart, al.) explain it of <em> consciousness of sin by the sinner himself</em> , as in ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span> ; but (1) as De Wette observes, this is not the natural sense of the word, which implies TWO parties, one of whom sets down something to the account of the other (ref.): (2) this interpretation would bring in a new and irrelevant element, for the Apostle is not speaking in this chapter at all of <em> subjective human consciousness</em> , but throughout of <em> objective truths with regard to the divine dealings:</em> and (3) it would be altogether inconsistent with the declarations of ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span> , where in this sense the ἐλλογισμός of sin by the νόμον μὴ ἔχοντες distinctly asserted.

<p>I am persuaded that the right sense of ἐλλ . is, <strong> reckoned</strong> , ‘ <em> set down as transgression</em> ,’ ‘put in formal account,’ <em> by God</em> . In the case of those who had not the written law, ἁμαρτία is not formally reckoned as παράβασις , set over against the command: but in a certain sense, as distinctly proved ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:9-16">Romans 2:9-16</span> , it <em> is reckoned</em> and they are condemned for it. Nor is there any inconsistency, as Tholuck complains, in this view. Other passages of Paul’s writings support and elucidate it. He states the object of the law to be, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span> , ἵνα γένηται καθ ʼ ὑπερβολὴν ἁμαρτωλὸς ἡ ἁμαρτία διὰ τῆς ἐντολῆς . The revelation of the law <em> exaggerated</em> , brought into prominent and formal manifestation, the sinfulness of sin, which <em> was before culpable and punishable</em> , but in a less degree. With this view also agree <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:30">Acts 17:30</span> ; ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:12">Romans 2:12</span> , ὅσοι ἀνόμως ἥμαρτον , ἀνόμως καὶ ἀπολοῦνται , and <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span> , in so far as they state an analogous case. The objection to taking οὐκ ἐλλογεῖται <em> relatively, ‘is not fully reckoned</em> ,’ will hardly be urged by those who bear in mind the Apostle’s habit of constantly <em> stating relative truths as positive</em> , omitting the qualifying particles: see e.g. ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7">Romans 7:7</span> , where with ἁμαρτίαν and with οὐκ ᾔδειν both, we must supply qualifications (see notes there).</p>
