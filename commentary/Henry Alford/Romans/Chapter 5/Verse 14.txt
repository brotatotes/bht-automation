<b> 14.</b>]<b> Nevertheless</b> (notwithstanding the last assertion, that sin is not fully reckoned where the law is not)<b> death reigned</b> (was a power to which all succumbed)<b> from Adam to Moses</b> (the period included is the same as that marked out by the words<i> until the law</i> above: i.e. although the full imputation of sin did not take place between Adam and Moses,<i> the universality of death is a proof that all sinned</i>,—for death is the consequence of sin:—in confirmation of ver. 12),<b> even</b> (notwithstanding the different degrees of sin and guilt out of, and under, the law)<b> over them that sinned not after the likeness of the</b> TRANSGRESSION<b> of Adam</b> (the emphasis lies on<b> transgression</b>, as distinguished from<i> sin</i>. They all<i> sinned</i>: had not, like Adam,<i> transgressed</i> a positive revealed command. There is no reference here, as some Commentators have supposed, to the ease of<i> children</i> and<i> idiots</i>,—nor (as others)<i> to those who lived pious lives</i>. The aim is to prove, that the seed of sin planted in the race by the one man Adam, has sprung up and borne fruit in all, so as to bring them under death;—death temporal, and spiritual;—of these, some have sinned without the law, i.e.<i> not as Adam did, and as those after Moses did</i>: and though sin is not formally reckoned against them, death, the consequence of sin, reigned, as matter of historical fact, over them also. It is most important to the clear understanding of this weighty passage to bear in mind, that the first member of the comparison, as far as it<i> extends</i>, is this: ‘As by Adam’s transgression, of which we are by descent inheritors, we have become (not by imputation merely, but by propensity)<i> sinners</i>, and have thus incurred<i> death</i>, so&c.’..... see below),<b> who is a type of him that is to come</b> (or, and perhaps better,<b> of the future Adam</b>, the second Adam, viz. Christ). This clause is inserted on the first mention of the name Adam, the<i> one man</i> of whom he had been speaking, to recall the purpose for which he is treating of him,—as<i> the figure of Christ</i>. It is not<i> of him that was</i> to come, as in A.V., but is spoken from the Apostle’s<i> present</i> standing, ‘<i>who is to come.</i>’ The fulfilment of the type will then take place completely, when, as 1 Cor. xv. 22,<i> in Christ all shall be made alive</i>.
