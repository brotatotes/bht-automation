<p><strong> 15.</strong> <strong> εἰ γὰρ κ</strong> <strong> .</strong> <strong> τ</strong> <strong> .</strong> <strong> λ</strong> .] <em> Distinction the first</em> , in DEGREE: and in the form of a hypothetical inference ‘a minori ad majus.’ <strong> For if by the transgression of the one (man) the many (have) died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift abound in</strong> (by means of) <strong> the grace of the one man Jesus Christ towards the many</strong> . (1) The first question regards πολλῷ μᾶλλον . Is it the ‘ <em> a fortiori</em> ’ of logical inference, or is it to be joined with ἐπερίσσευσεν as quantitative, describing the <em> degree of abounding</em> ? Chrys. ( πολλῷ γὰρ τοῦτο εὐλογώτερον ), Grot., Fritz., Thol., adopt the former, and provided only <em> the same thing is said here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span></em> , the usage there would decide it to be so: for there it cannot be quantitative. But I believe that not to be so. Here, the question is of <em> abounding</em> , a matter of <em> degree</em> , there, of <em> reigning</em> , a matter of <em> fact</em> . Here ( Rom 5:16 ) the contrast is between the judgment, coming of <em> one</em> sinner, to condemnation, and the free gift, of (see note below) <em> many</em> offences, to justification. So that I think the quantitative sense the better, and join <strong> πολλῷ μᾶλλον</strong> with ἐπερίσσευσεν , in the sense of <strong> much more abundant</strong> (rich in diffusion) <strong> was the gift</strong> , &amp;c. (2) <strong> χάρις</strong> , not the grace <em> working in men</em> , here, but the grace which <em> is in, and flows from, God</em> . (3) ἐν χάριτι τῇ τοῦ …, not to be joined (Thol.) with ἡ δωρεά , as if it were ἡ ἐνχάρ . (which would be allowable), but with ἐπερίσς . The <em> grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</em> (His self-offering love, see 2Co 8:9 ) is the medium by which the free gift is imparted to men. (4) The aorist ἐπερίσς . should here be kept to its indefinite historical sense, and not rendered as a perfect, however true the fact expressed may be: <em> both</em> are treated of here as <em> events</em> , their time of happening and present reference not being regarded.</p>
