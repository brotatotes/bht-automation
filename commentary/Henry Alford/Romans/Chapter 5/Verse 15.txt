<b> 15.</b>]<b> For if, &c.</b><i> Distinction the first</i>, in DEGREE:—and in the form of a hypothetical inference, from the less to the greater.<b> For if by the trespass of the one</b> [<b>man</b>]<b> the many died, much more did the grace of God and his free gift abound unto the many by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ.</b> (1) The first question regards the expression<b> much more</b>. Is it the<i> à fortiori</i> of logical inference, or is it to be joined with<b> did abound</b> as quantitative, describing the<i> degree of abounding</i>? Chrysostom and others adopt the former, and provided only<i> the same thing is said here as in ver.</i> 17, the usage there would decide it to be so: for there it cannot be quantitative. But I believe that not to be so. Here, the question is of<i> abounding</i>, a matter of<i> degree</i>, there, of<i> reigning</i>, a matter of<i> fact</i>. Here (ver. 16) the contrast is between the judgment, coming of<i> one</i> sinner, to condemnation, and the free gift, of (see note below)<i> many</i> offences, to justification. So that I think the quantitative sense the better, and join<b> much more</b> with<i> did abound</i>, in the sense of<b> much more abundant</b> (rich in diffusion)<b> was the gift</b>, &c. (2)<b> grace</b>, not the grace<i> working in men</i>, here, but the grace which<i> is in, and flows from</i>, God. (3)<i> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</i> (His self-offering love, see 2 Cor. viii. 9) is the medium by which the free gift is imparted to men. (4) The<i> past</i> tense,<b> did abound</b>, should here be kept to its indefinite historical sense, and not rendered, as in the A.V., by a<i> perfect</i>, however true the fact expressed. may be:<i> both</i> are treated of here as<i> events</i>, their time of happening and present reference not being regarded.
