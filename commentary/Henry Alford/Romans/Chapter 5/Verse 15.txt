 15.  εἰ γὰρ κ  .  τ  .  λ .]  Distinction the first , in DEGREE: and in the form of a hypothetical inference ‘a minori ad majus.’  For if by the transgression of the one (man) the many (have) died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift abound in (by means of)  the grace of the one man Jesus Christ towards the many . (1) The first question regards πολλῷ μᾶλλον . Is it the ‘  a fortiori ’ of logical inference, or is it to be joined with ἐπερίσσευσεν as quantitative, describing the  degree of abounding ? Chrys. ( πολλῷ γὰρ τοῦτο εὐλογώτερον ), Grot., Fritz., Thol., adopt the former, and provided only  the same thing is said here as in Romans 5:17 , the usage there would decide it to be so: for there it cannot be quantitative. But I believe that not to be so. Here, the question is of  abounding , a matter of  degree , there, of  reigning , a matter of  fact . Here ( Rom 5:16 ) the contrast is between the judgment, coming of  one sinner, to condemnation, and the free gift, of (see note below)  many offences, to justification. So that I think the quantitative sense the better, and join  πολλῷ μᾶλλον with ἐπερίσσευσεν , in the sense of  much more abundant (rich in diffusion)  was the gift , &c. (2)  χάρις , not the grace  working in men , here, but the grace which  is in, and flows from, God . (3) ἐν χάριτι τῇ τοῦ …, not to be joined (Thol.) with ἡ δωρεά , as if it were ἡ ἐνχάρ . (which would be allowable), but with ἐπερίσς . The  grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (His self-offering love, see 2Co 8:9 ) is the medium by which the free gift is imparted to men. (4) The aorist ἐπερίσς . should here be kept to its indefinite historical sense, and not rendered as a perfect, however true the fact expressed may be:  both are treated of here as  events , their time of happening and present reference not being regarded.
