<b> 16.</b>]<i> Distinction the second</i>, in KIND, The former difference was quantitative: this is modal.—<b>And not as</b> [<b>it was</b>]<b> through one that sinned, so is the gift</b>.—It is a question, the words [<i>it was</i>] not existing in the original, whether any thing, and what, is to be supplied before the clause,<b> through one that sinned</b>. Meyer and others would understand it as if nothing was to be supplied, ‘And not as through one that sinned, so is the gift.’ But this has against it, that since the<b> for</b> following<i> gives the reason</i> for this sentence, this must<i> contain implicitly all</i> that that next expands in detail; which is not merely the distinction between springing from<i> one man</i> and out of<i> many offences</i>, but much more. Others have supplied the<i> condemnation</i>, or the words<i> death entered</i>—but inasmuch as it is purposely left indefinite, to be explained in the next verse, it is better to supply in the thought an indefinite phrase which may be thus explained: as, ‘<i>that which took place</i>, through one;’ or, ‘as [it was] through one.’<b> for the judgment</b> (pronounced by God upon Adam)<b> came of</b> (was by occasion of)<b> one</b> (man having sinned,—<i>one trespass</i> would be hardly allowable, and would not help the sense, inasmuch as many<i> sinners</i>, as well as many sins, are implied in<i> many trespasses</i>, below)<b> unto condemnation</b> (its result, in his own case and that of his posterity);<b> but the gift of grace came of</b> (was by occasion of)<b> many trespasses</b> (where sin abounded, ver. 20, there grace much more abounded: the existence of<i> the law</i> being implied in the word<i> trespasses</i>)<b> unto justification</b>.—The only difficulty here is the sense of the word rendered<i> justification</i>, respecting which I must refer to the note in my Greek Testament. The strict meaning is a<i> sentence of acquittal</i>, which, in fact, amounts to<i> justification</i>.
