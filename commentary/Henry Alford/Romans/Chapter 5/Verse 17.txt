<b> 17.</b>]<i> Distinction the third</i>, also in KIND; that which came in by the<i> one sinner</i>, was the<i> reign of</i> DEATH: that which shall come in by the<i> One, Jesus Christ</i>, will be a<i> reigning</i><i> in</i> LIFE.—<b>For</b> (carrying on the argument from ver. 15, but not so as to make parenthetical ver. 16)<b> if by the trespass of the one</b> [man],<b> death reigned throngh the one</b> [man],<b> much more</b> (logical à fortiori)<b> shall they which receive the abundance of the grace and of the free gift of righteousness reign in life</b> (eternal)<b> through</b> (by means of)<b> the one</b> (Man),<b> even Jesus Christ</b>:—<i>Abundance</i> answers to “<i>did abound</i>,” ver. 15;<b> grace</b> here to “<i>the grace of God</i>” there; only here, as at ch. i. 5, the word signifies not only the grace flowing froin God, but the same grace implanted and working in man;—<b>the free gift</b> here to the same word there, but qualified by the<b> words of righteousness</b>, answering to “<i>justification</i>” in ver. 16.<br><br><b> reign in life</b>] “Antithesis to ‘<i>death reigned</i>.’ We should expect ‘<i>life shall reign</i>;’ but St. Paul designedly changes the form of expression, that he may bring more prominently forward the idea of free personality.<b> Life</b> is not only corporeal. (the resurrection), but also spiritual and moral,—as also in ‘<i>death</i>’ we must include<i> through</i><i> sin</i>, as in ver. 12. The term<b> shall reign</b> is brought in by the antithesis: but it is elsewhere used (compare 1 Cor. iv. 8. Rev. v. 10; xx. 4, 6; xxii. 5) to signify the state of blessedness, partly in an objective theocratic import (of the reign of the saints with Christ), partly in a subjective moral one,—because<i> reigning</i> is the highest, development of freedom, and the highest satisfaction of all desires.” De Wette.
