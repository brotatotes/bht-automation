<b> 20.</b>]<i> How the law</i> (of Moses)<i> came in, in the divine economy</i>.—<b>Now</b> (or,<b> But</b>, i.e. the two things spoken of ver. 19 did not<i> simply</i> and<i> immediately</i> happen)<b> the law</b> (of Moses, not<i> law</i> in the abstract, nor ‘the law of nature,’—nor even<i> the law of God</i> in its<i> general</i> sense, as often in ch. i. ii.;—but here strictly THE LAW OF MOSES, as necessitated by vv. 13, 14 in this same argument)<b> came in besides</b> (besides the fact of the many being made sinners, and as a transition point to the other result: formed a<i> third term</i>, besides these two, in the summary of God’s dealings with man),<b> in order that</b> (its<i> design</i>,—not merely its result. So in ver. 21)<b> the trespass</b> (<i>created</i> by the law; for where no law, no transgression, ch. iv. 15:—not merely the<i> knowledge of sin</i>, but<i> actual</i> transgression)<b> might be multiplied</b> (in<i> actual fact</i>: not ‘be abundantly exhibited,’ or any such evasive sense).—No possible objection can be taken to this statement by those who view the Law as a preparation for Christ. If it was so, then the effect of the Law, the creating and multiplying transgression, was<i> an end in the divine purposes</i>, to bring out the necessity of One who should deliver from sin, and bring in righteousness.<b> But</b> (this terrible end, the multiplying of transgression, was not, however, God’s<i> ultimate</i> end: He had a further and gracious one)<b> where sin</b> (the generic of the specific word “<i>trespass</i>”)<b> was multiplied</b>, (God’s)<b> grace did beyond measure abound</b> (not ‘<i>did much more abound</i>,’ as A.V. The A.V. has likewise destroyed the force of the comparison by rendering two different and distinct verbs in the original words both by one word, ‘<i>abound</i>’).
