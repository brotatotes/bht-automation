 6. ] The text here is in some confusion, see var. readd. The whole may perhaps have arisen from an ecclesiastical portion having begun χριστὸς ὄντων ἡμῶν ἀσθενῶν ἔτι … When this found its  way into the text, ἔτι was repeated. This offended the transcribers: but the first ἔτι could not be  erased , because γάρ followed; it may then have been conjecturally emended to εἰ (and γάρ to γέ as in B, or δέ as in L), or εἰς τί , some retaining ἔτι in both places. The place of ἔτι is often, in the case of absolutes, at the beginning of a sentence, with the subject of the senence between it and the word or words to which it applies; so ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος , Matthew 12:46 , ἔτι δέ αὐτοῦ μακρὰν ἀπέχοντος , Luke 15:20 , &c. On reconsideration, however, seeing that if we follow the most ancient MSS., we must either  repeat  ἔτι , which seems very unlikely to have been originally written, or adopt the reading of B, I have taken the latter alternative.  If, that is (on  εἴ γε , see note, 2 Corinthians 5:3 , and Eph 3:2 ),  Christ when we were yet weak (‘powerless for good;’ or even stronger than that: there seems in this verse to be a tacit reference to Ezekiel 16:0 . See especially Rom 5:7-8 of that chap. in the LXX, σὺ δὲ ἦσθα γυμνὴ καὶ ἀσχημονοῦσα καὶ διῆλθον διὰ σοῦ καὶ ἴδον σε , καὶ ἰδοὺ καιρός σου … καὶ διεπέτασα τὰς πτέρυγάς μου ἐπὶ σέ , καὶ ἐκάλυψα τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην σου , καὶ ὤμοσά σοι · καὶ εἰσῆλθον ἐν διαθήκῃ μετὰ σοῦ , λέγει κύριος ),  in due season (i.e. at the appointed time; compare reff. and Galatians 4:4 , and καιρός in the quotation above)  Christ died for (‘on behalf of,’ see reff.)  ungodly men (not ὑπὲρ  ἡμῶν , because the Apostle wishes to bring out fully by this strong antithesis, which he enlarges on in the next verses, the greatness of the divine Love to man).
