<p><strong> 7.</strong> ] The greatness of this Love, of Christ’s death on behalf of the impious, is brought out by shewing that there is none such among <em> men</em> , nay that such a self-sacrifice, not unexampled where a <em> good</em> man, one loving his fellow-men and loved by them, is to be rescued, is hardly found to occur on behalf of the pious and just. <strong> For hardly will any one die on behalf of a just man</strong> (masc., not neuter, ‘for justice’ or ‘righteousness sake,’ as Jer [29] , Erasm., Luth., al.: for the matter in hand is Christ’s death on behalf of <em> persons</em> ) <strong> for</strong> (this second ‘for’ is exceptive, and answers to ‘but I do not press this without exception,’ understood) <strong> on behalf of the good man</strong> (the art. as pointing him out generally, as in the expression, ‘the fool,’ ‘the wise man,’ ‘the righteous,’ ‘the wicked’) <strong> perhaps</strong> ( τάχα opens a possibility which μόλις closes) <strong> one doth even dare</strong> (i.e. is even found to venture; the pres. implies habituality it may occur here and there) <strong> to die</strong> .

<p>The distinction here made between δίκαιος and ἀγαθός , is also found in Cicero, de Of. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:15">Romans 3:15</span> , ‘Si vir bonus is est qui prodest quibus potest, nocet nemini, recte <em> justum</em> virum, <em> bonum</em> non facile reperiemus.’ (But some edd. read ‘istum virum bonum.’)
	</p>
<p>The interpretation which makes δίκαιος and ἀγαθός refer to the same man, and the second clause = ‘I do not say that such a thing <em> may</em> not sometimes occur,’ is very vapid, and loses sight of the antithesis between δἰκαιος , and ἄδικος (= ἀσεβής = ἁμαρτωλός ).</p>
