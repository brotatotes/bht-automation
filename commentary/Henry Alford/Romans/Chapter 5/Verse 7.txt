 7. ] The greatness of this Love, of Christ’s death on behalf of the impious, is brought out by shewing that there is none such among  men , nay that such a self-sacrifice, not unexampled where a  good man, one loving his fellow-men and loved by them, is to be rescued, is hardly found to occur on behalf of the pious and just.  For hardly will any one die on behalf of a just man (masc., not neuter, ‘for justice’ or ‘righteousness sake,’ as Jer [29] , Erasm., Luth., al.: for the matter in hand is Christ’s death on behalf of  persons )  for (this second ‘for’ is exceptive, and answers to ‘but I do not press this without exception,’ understood)  on behalf of the good man (the art. as pointing him out generally, as in the expression, ‘the fool,’ ‘the wise man,’ ‘the righteous,’ ‘the wicked’)  perhaps ( τάχα opens a possibility which μόλις closes)  one doth even dare (i.e. is even found to venture; the pres. implies habituality it may occur here and there)  to die .
	 [29]  Jerome , fl. 378 420
	The distinction here made between δίκαιος and ἀγαθός , is also found in Cicero, de Of. Romans 3:15 , ‘Si vir bonus is est qui prodest quibus potest, nocet nemini, recte  justum virum,  bonum non facile reperiemus.’ (But some edd. read ‘istum virum bonum.’)
	The interpretation which makes δίκαιος and ἀγαθός refer to the same man, and the second clause = ‘I do not say that such a thing  may not sometimes occur,’ is very vapid, and loses sight of the antithesis between δἰκαιος , and ἄδικος (= ἀσεβής = ἁμαρτωλός ).
