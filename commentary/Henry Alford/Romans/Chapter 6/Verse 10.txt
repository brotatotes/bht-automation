<b> 10.</b>]<b> For</b> (the proof of the foregoing)<b> the death that he died</b> (not ‘in that He died,’ as A.V.),<b> He died unto sin</b> (De Wette well remarks that we must in<i> expressing</i> this verse abide by the<i> indefinite</i> reference to sin in which the death of Christ is placed; if we attempt to make it more definite, ‘<i>for sin</i>, or ‘<i>to that state</i>,<i> in which He suffered the punishment of sin</i>,’ we shall lose the point of comparison, which lies in ‘<i>to sin</i>’ and ‘<i>to God</i>.’ If we are to<i> expand</i> the words ‘<i>died to sin</i>,’ we must say that our Lord at death passed into a state in which He had ‘<i>no more to do with sin</i>’—either as<i> tempting</i> Him [though in vain], or as<i> requiring to be atoned for</i> [this having been now effected], or as<i> met by Him</i> in daily contradiction which He endured from sinners)<b> once</b> (i. e.,<i> once for all</i>, so that it is not to be repeated):<b> but the life that he liveth</b> (see above),<i> he liveth unto God</i> (indefinite again, but easily filled up and explained:<i> to God</i>,—as being glorified by and with the Father, as entirely rid of conflict with sin and death, and having only God’s [properly so called] work to do,—as waiting till, in the purposes of the Father, all things are put under Him:—<i>and to</i> [for]<i> God</i>, as being the manifestation and brightness of the Father’s glory).
