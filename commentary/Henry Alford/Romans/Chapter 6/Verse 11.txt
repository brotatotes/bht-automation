<p><strong> 11.</strong> ] <em> An exhortation to realize this state of death unto sin and life unto God with Christ</em> . <strong> Thus</strong> (after the same manner as Christ) <strong> do ye also</strong> (imperative: Meyer only holds it to be indic.) <strong> account yourselves</strong> (better than ‘ <em> infer yourselves to be</em> ,’ as Chrys. and Beza, see reff. and on ch. Rom 3:28 ) <strong> dead</strong> ( <strong> indeed</strong> ) <strong> unto sin</strong> (as Rom 6:2 and following), <strong> but alive unto God in Christ Jesus</strong> (i.e. ‘ <em> by virtue of your union with Him</em> :’ not <em> through</em> ( διὰ ) Christ Jesus; in this chapter it is not Christ’s <em> Mediatorship</em> , but His <em> Headship</em> , which is prominent. ἐν χρ . Ἰης ., is not (Reiche, Meyer, Fritz.) to be joined with both νεκρ . τῇ ἁμ . and ζῶν . τ . θ ., but only with the latter, next to which it stands, and of which it is literally and positively, whereas of the other it is only figuratively ( τῷ ὁμοιώμ ., Rom 6:5 ) and negatively true).</p>
