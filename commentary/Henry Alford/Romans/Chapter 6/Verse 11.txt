 11. ]  An exhortation to realize this state of death unto sin and life unto God with Christ .  Thus (after the same manner as Christ)  do ye also (imperative: Meyer only holds it to be indic.)  account yourselves (better than ‘  infer yourselves to be ,’ as Chrys. and Beza, see reff. and on ch. Rom 3:28 )  dead (  indeed )  unto sin (as Rom 6:2 and following),  but alive unto God in Christ Jesus (i.e. ‘  by virtue of your union with Him :’ not  through ( διὰ ) Christ Jesus; in this chapter it is not Christ’s  Mediatorship , but His  Headship , which is prominent. ἐν χρ . Ἰης ., is not (Reiche, Meyer, Fritz.) to be joined with both νεκρ . τῇ ἁμ . and ζῶν . τ . θ ., but only with the latter, next to which it stands, and of which it is literally and positively, whereas of the other it is only figuratively ( τῷ ὁμοιώμ ., Rom 6:5 ) and negatively true).
