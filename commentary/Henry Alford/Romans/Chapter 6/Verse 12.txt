<b> 12.</b>]<b> Let not sin reign</b> answers to the imagery throughout, in which Sin is a master or lord. It is hardly right to lay stress on it, and say, as Chrysostom, “He does not say, ‘Let not sin live’ or ‘work,’ but, ‘Let not sin reign:’ for He did not come to extinguish nature, but to rectify the will?” for it is no matter of comparison between<i> reigning</i> and<i> indwelling merely</i>, but between<i> reigning</i> and<i> being deposed.</i>—But why<i> your</i><b> mortal</b><i> body</i>? Origen and others explain it ‘<i>dead to sin</i>,’ which it clearly cannot be. Chrysostom and others suppose the word inserted to remind us of<i> the other life</i>, and the shortness of the conflict, or of the shortness of sinful pleasures: De Wette, Tholuck, and others, more probably, that the Apostle wishes to keep in view the connexion between<i> sin and death</i> on the one hand, and<i> that life with Christ, which is freed from death</i> on the other. See 2 Cor. iv. 11 and note.
