 12. ]  βασιλευέτω answers to the imagery throughout, in which Sin is a master or lord. It is hardly right to lay a stress on it, and say (as Chrys.) οὐ  κ εἶπε μὴ οὖν ζήτω ἡ σὰρξ μηδὲ ἐνεργείτω , ἀλλ ʼ, ἡ ἁμαρτία μὴ  βασιλευέτω . οὐ γὰρ τὴν φύσιν ἦλθεν ἀνελεῖν , ἀλλὰ τὴν προαίρεσιν διορθῶσαι : it is no matter of comparison between  reigning and  indwelling merely , but between  reigning and  being deposed .
	But why τῷ  θνητῷ ὑμ . σώματι ? Orig [38] , al., explain it ‘  dead to sin ,’ which it clearly cannot be. Chrys., Theodoret, Grot., and Reiche suppose the word inserted to remind us of  the other life , and the shortness of the conflict, or (Theophyl.) of the shortness of sinful pleasures; Köllner, to point out that it is dishonourable to us to serve Sin, whose reign is confined to the  mortal body; Fritzsche, ‘quoniam, qui peccato ministrum se præbet, adhuc in  mortali corpore hærere nec nisi fragilis vitæ meminisse videtur;’ De Wette, Tholuck, al., that the Apostle, wishes to keep in view the connexion between  sin and death on the one hand, and  that συνζῆν  which is freed from death on the other. This last view seems the most probable. See 2Co 4:11 and note.

	There is considerable uncertainty in the reading of the latter part of this verse. That which I have adopted is supported by the primary MSS. and has the approval of Lachmann, Tischendorf, Meyer, and De Wette.
