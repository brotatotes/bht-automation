<p><strong> 12.</strong> ] <strong> βασιλευέτω</strong> answers to the imagery throughout, in which Sin is a master or lord. It is hardly right to lay a stress on it, and say (as Chrys.) οὐ <strong> κ</strong> εἶπε μὴ οὖν ζήτω ἡ σὰρξ μηδὲ ἐνεργείτω , ἀλλ ʼ, ἡ ἁμαρτία μὴ <strong> βασιλευέτω</strong> . οὐ γὰρ τὴν φύσιν ἦλθεν ἀνελεῖν , ἀλλὰ τὴν προαίρεσιν διορθῶσαι : it is no matter of comparison between <em> reigning</em> and <em> indwelling merely</em> , but between <em> reigning</em> and <em> being deposed</em> .
	</p>
<p>But why τῷ <strong> θνητῷ</strong> ὑμ . σώματι ? Orig [38] , al., explain it ‘ <em> dead to sin</em> ,’ which it clearly cannot be. Chrys., Theodoret, Grot., and Reiche suppose the word inserted to remind us of <em> the other life</em> , and the shortness of the conflict, or (Theophyl.) of the shortness of sinful pleasures; Köllner, to point out that it is dishonourable to us to serve Sin, whose reign is confined to the <em> mortal</em> body; Fritzsche, ‘quoniam, qui peccato ministrum se præbet, adhuc in <em> mortali</em> corpore hærere nec nisi fragilis vitæ meminisse videtur;’ De Wette, Tholuck, al., that the Apostle, wishes to keep in view the connexion between <em> sin and death</em> on the one hand, and <em> that</em> συνζῆν <em> which is freed from death</em> on the other. This last view seems the most probable. See 2Co 4:11 and note.

<p>There is considerable uncertainty in the reading of the latter part of this verse. That which I have adopted is supported by the primary MSS. and has the approval of Lachmann, Tischendorf, Meyer, and De Wette.</p>
