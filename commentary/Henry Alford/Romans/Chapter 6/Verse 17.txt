<p><strong> 17.</strong> <strong> ὑπ</strong> <strong> .… </strong> <strong> διδαχῆς</strong> ] Attr.: the simple construction would be ὑπηκούσατε τῷ τύπῳ τῆς διδ . εἰς ὃν (or ὃν ) παρεδόθητε ), <strong> ye obeyed</strong> ( ὑπ . on account of ὑπακοή above) <strong> from the heart</strong> (reff.) <strong> that form of teaching</strong> (so μόρφωσις ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:20">Romans 2:20</span> ; see examples in Fritzsche, vol. i. p. 418; most probably used of the practical <em> norma agendi</em> accompanying the doctrine of the gospel; so Calv., Luth., Beza, Reiche: De W. thinks it is the Pauline form of teaching, of justification by faith, distinguished from the Judaistic) <strong> to which ye were delivered</strong> ([not as E. V., ‘ <em> which was delivered you</em> ’] this inversion to the passive agrees admirably with τύπος , as a mould, exemplar, or pattern after which they were to be fashioned: so κατὰ τὰ δόγματα τυποῦσθαι , Arrian. Enchir. ii. 19 (Thol.): and Beza, ‘hoc dicendi genus magnam quandam emphasin videtur habere. Ita enim significatur evangelicam doctrinam quasi instar typi cujusdam esse, cui veluti immittamur, ut ejus figuræ conformemur, et totam istam transformationem aliunde provenire.’ (Thol.) And Chrys. remarks, τὸ παραδοθῆναι , τὴν τοῦ θεοῦ βοηθείαν αἰνίττεται . See on the construction, Winer, edn. 6, § 24. 2. b).</p>
