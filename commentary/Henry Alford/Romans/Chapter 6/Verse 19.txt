 19. ] For the expression  ἐδουλώθητε the Apostle apologizes: ‘it is not literally so; the servant of righteousness is  no slave , under no yoke of bondage; but in order to set the contrast between the former and the new state better before you, I have used this word:’  I speak as a man (according to the requirements of rhetorical antithesis)  on account of the (intellectual, as De W. and Thol.: not moral, as Meyer and Olsh.)  weakness of your flesh (i.e. ‘because you are σαρκικοί and not πνευματικοί , and want such figures to set the truth before you.’
	Orig [39] , Chrys., Theodoret, Calv., Estius, Wetst., al., take these words in a totally different sense: ‘  I require of you nothing which your fleshly weakness will not bear ’):  for (explanatory of ἐδουλώθ .)  like as ye (once)  rendered up your members (as) servants to impurity and to lawlessness (two divisions of ἁμαρτία impurity, against a man’s self, lawlessness against God),  unto lawlessness (both which, ἀκαθ . and ἀνομ .,  lead to ἀνομία ,  result in it: ‘qui justitiæ serviunt,  proficiunt : ἄνομοι , iniqui, sunt  iniqui, nihil amplius .’ Bengel: not ‘  from one ἀνομία  to another ,’ as Œcum., Theophyl., Luth., Grot., Erasm., al.: because (De W.) ἀνομία is not an  act , but a principle),  so now render up your members (as) servants to righteousness (see Rom 6:16 )  unto (leading to, having as its result, perfect)  sanctification (contrast to ἀνομία , and both embracing their respective consequences).
