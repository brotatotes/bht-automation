But this though good as far as construction is concerned, is inconsistent with the N. T. meaning of καρπός , which is ‘ <em> actions</em> ,’ the <em> fruit of the man</em> considered as the tree, not ‘ <em> wages</em> ,’ or ‘ <em> reward</em> ,’ the <em> fruit of his actions</em> : see below, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:22">Romans 6:22</span> , and ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:13">Romans 1:13</span> , note.
