 3. ]  Or (supposing you do not assent to the argument in the last verse, see reff.)  are ye ignorant (the foregoing axiom is brought out into recognition by the further statement of a truth universally acknowledged)  that all we who were (i.e. all of us, having been [not as E. V., again most unfortunately, “  so many of us as were ;” giving it to be understood that some of them had  not been thus baptized])  baptized into Christ Jesus (‘  into participation of,’ ‘into union with ,’ Christ, in His capacity of spiritual Mastership, Headship, and Pattern of conformity)  were baptized into (introduced by our baptism into a state of conformity with and participation of)  His death ? The Apostle refers (1) to an acknowledged fact, in the signification, and perhaps also in the manner (see below) of baptism that it put upon us ( Gal 3:27 ) a state of conformity with and participation in Christ; and (2) that this state involves a death τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ even as He died τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ ( Rom 6:10 ); the meaning being kept in the background, but all the while not lost sight of, that the  benefits of His Death were likewise made ours by our introduction into the covenant.
