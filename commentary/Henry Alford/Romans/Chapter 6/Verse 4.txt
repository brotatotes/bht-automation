 4. ] A further explanation of the assertion in the last verse proceeding ( οὖν ) on its concession by the reader.  We were then (not the temporal but inferential ‘then:’ q. d. “You grant my last position: Well then,” …)  buried with Him ( καθάπερ ἔν τινι τάφῳ τῷ ὕδατι καταδυόντων ἡμῶν τὰς κεφαλὰς ὁ παλαιὸς ἄνθρωπος θάπτεται , καὶ καταδὺς κάτω κρύπτεται ὅλως καθάπαξ , Chrys. on John 3:0 . Hom. xxv. 2, vol. viii. p. 151)  by means of our baptism into (His)  death ( τοῦ βαπτ . εἰς τὸν θάνατον belong together, not συνετάφ . εἰς τ . θ ., which would hardly bear any sense. The absence of the art. before εἰς is no objection to this; it is unnecessary, because no distinction from any other baptism is brought out, and τὸ βάπτ .- εἰς - τὸν - θάν . is connected as one idea);  in order that, as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory ( δόξα and δύναμις are cognate ideas; compare the import of the Heb. עֹז and the LXX in Psalms 68:35 (Psa 67:34 LXX), Isaiah 12:2 ; and τὸ κράτος τῆς δόξης in Colossians 1:11 . The divine δόξα includes all that manifests the Creator to the creature: and hence also his Almightiness. Tholuck.
	The renderings ‘  in Dei gloriam ’ (Beza, Bretschneider), and ‘  because He is the image of the Father ’ (Dr. Burton, altern.), are inadmissible for διὰ with a gen.)  of the Father (Theodoret makes ἡ δόξα τοῦ πατρός = ἡ οἰκεία θεότης of the Son, which is manifestly wrong),  thus we also should walk in newness of life (not = ‘  a new life ;’ nor are such expressions ever to be diluted away thus: the abstract καινότητι is used to bring the quality of  newness , which is the point insisted on, more into prominence, compare 2 Thessalonians 2:11 ; 1 Timothy 6:17 [and notes]; Winer, edn. 6, § 34. 3.
	The comparison is not only (as Stuart) between our Lord’s  physical death and resurrection, and our  spiritual ; but reaches far deeper: see notes on Rom 6:10-11 ).
