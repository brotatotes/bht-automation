<p><strong> 4.</strong> ] A further explanation of the assertion in the last verse proceeding ( οὖν ) on its concession by the reader. <strong> We were then</strong> (not the temporal but inferential ‘then:’ q. d. “You grant my last position: Well then,” …) <strong> buried with Him</strong> ( καθάπερ ἔν τινι τάφῳ τῷ ὕδατι καταδυόντων ἡμῶν τὰς κεφαλὰς ὁ παλαιὸς ἄνθρωπος θάπτεται , καὶ καταδὺς κάτω κρύπτεται ὅλως καθάπαξ , Chrys. on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:0">John 3:0</span> . Hom. xxv. 2, vol. viii. p. 151) <strong> by means of our baptism into</strong> (His) <strong> death</strong> ( τοῦ βαπτ . εἰς τὸν θάνατον belong together, not συνετάφ . εἰς τ . θ ., which would hardly bear any sense. The absence of the art. before εἰς is no objection to this; it is unnecessary, because no distinction from any other baptism is brought out, and τὸ βάπτ .- εἰς - τὸν - θάν . is connected as one idea); <strong> in order that, as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory</strong> ( δόξα and δύναμις are cognate ideas; compare the import of the Heb. עֹז and the LXX in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:35">Psalms 68:35</span> (Psa 67:34 LXX), <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+12:2">Isaiah 12:2</span> ; and τὸ κράτος τῆς δόξης in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+1:11">Colossians 1:11</span> . The divine δόξα includes all that manifests the Creator to the creature: and hence also his Almightiness. Tholuck.

<p>The renderings ‘ <em> in Dei gloriam</em> ’ (Beza, Bretschneider), and ‘ <em> because He is the image of the Father</em> ’ (Dr. Burton, altern.), are inadmissible for διὰ with a gen.) <strong> of the Father</strong> (Theodoret makes ἡ δόξα τοῦ πατρός = ἡ οἰκεία θεότης of the Son, which is manifestly wrong), <strong> thus we also should walk in newness of life</strong> (not = ‘ <em> a new life</em> ;’ nor are such expressions ever to be diluted away thus: the abstract καινότητι is used to bring the quality of <em> newness</em> , which is the point insisted on, more into prominence, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:11">2 Thessalonians 2:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:17">1 Timothy 6:17</span> [and notes]; Winer, edn. 6, § 34. 3.

<p>The comparison is not only (as Stuart) between our Lord’s <em> physical</em> death and resurrection, and our <em> spiritual</em> ; but reaches far deeper: see notes on Rom 6:10-11 ).</p>
