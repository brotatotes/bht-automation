<b> 4.</b>] A further explanation of the assertion in the last verse, proceeding on its concession by the reader.—We were buried therefore with him (Chrysostom says, commenting on John iii., “When we bow our heads under the water, our old man is buried as in a grave, and having been immersed below, is wholly and once for all put out of sight”)<b> through our baptism into his death</b> (our baptism into His death belongs together, not<i> we were buried into His death</i>, which would hardly bear any sense):<b> that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory</b> (the divine<b> glory</b> includes all that manifests the Creator to the creature: and hence also his Almightiness; compare the expression “<i>the might of his glory</i>,” Col. i, 11)<b> of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life</b> (not ‘<i>a new life;’</i>—nor are such expressions ever to be diluted away thus: the abstract substantive is used to bring the quality of<i> newness</i>, which is the point insisted on, more into prominence; comp. 2 Thess. ii. 11, and note: and 1 Tim. vi. 17, and note.—The comparison is not only between our Lord’s<i> physical</i> death and resurrection, and our<i> spiritual</i>; but reaches far deeper: see notes on vv. 10, 11).
