<p><strong> 5.</strong> ] The Apostle confirms the last verse by a necessary sequence that <em> those who are united to Him in His Death, shall be also in His resurrection</em> . <strong> For</strong> (confirmatory) <strong> if we have become united with the likeness of His Death</strong> ( σύμφυτος = either (1) ‘ <em> congenital</em> ,’ as διὰ τὴν σύμφυτον δικαιοσύνην , spoken of Samuel, Jos. Antt. vi. 3. 3, or (2) ‘ <em> cognate</em> ,’ of like nature, or (3) ‘ <em> arising simultaneously</em> ,’ or (4) ‘ <em> grown together</em> ,’ or (5) ‘ <em> planted with</em> ,’ ‘consitus.’ The rendering of Syr., Vulg., Luth., E. V., ‘ <em> planted together</em> ,’ is inadmissible, - φυτος being not from φυτεύω , but from φύω : as also is that of Erasm. and Calv., ‘ <em> insititii</em> .’ The fourth meaning, ‘ <em> grown together</em> ,’ ‘intimately and progressively united,’ ‘coaluimus,’ as Grot., seems here to apply best. Obs. σύμφ . is to be connected with τῷ ὁμ ., not with τῷ χριστῷ understood, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span> ; in which case we should have to supply τῷ ὁμοιώματι again before τῆς ἀναστάσεως , which would be not only grammatically difficult, but would not correspond to the sense: for Christians, it is true, partake of the <em> likeness</em> only of Christ’s <em> death</em> , but of His <em> actual Resurrection itself</em> , as the change of construction shews: see below), <strong> so shall we be also</strong> ( ἀλλά after a hypothetical clause serves to strengthen the inference: see reff., and Hartung, Partikellehre, ii. p. 40) <strong> with His Resurrection</strong> (a change of construction: because it could not well have been said σύμφυτοι τοῦ ὁμοιώματος τ . θ . above, the gen. after adjectives compounded with σύν denoting the thing actually partaken (cf. Kühner, § 519, and Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 171: who cites examples in σύντροφος , Soph. Philoct. 203, σύννομος , Eur. Hel. 1508, σύμφωνος , Aristoph. Av. 658, συμφυής , Plato Legg. iv. p. 721, συνήθης , ib. v. p. 739, σύμψηφος , Cratyl. p. 398), and hardly the mere figure or likeness of it, and similarly it could not well here be said σύμφ . τῇ ἀναστάσει , because the dat. would not be strong enough to denote the state of which we shall be actual partakers.

<p>The future is used <em> perhaps</em> because of the <em> inference</em> , as a logical sequence, ‘If, &amp;c., … A <em> shall</em> = B:’ but more probably with a deeper meaning, because the participation in His Resurrection, however partially and in the inner spiritual life, attained <em> here</em> , will only then be accomplished in our entire being, when we ‘shall wake up after his likeness’).</p>
