 6. ]  Knowing (recollecting)  this, that our old man (former self, personality before our new birth opposed to καινός or νέος ἄνθρ ., καινὴ κτίσις , see Colossians 3:10 ; 2 Corinthians 5:17 ; Ephesians 4:22-24 , not merely the guilt of sin, nor the power of sin, but the  man . The idea is not Jewish, as Tholuck has shewn: the passage quoted from the Sohar-chadasch not bearing the meaning commonly given to it, and if it did, that book itself being a production probably of the sixteenth century)  was (at our baptism)  crucified with Him (the great key to our text is ref. Gal. As the death of the Lord Jesus was by  crucifixion , the Apostle uses the same expression of our death to our former sinful self, which is not only by virtue of, but also  in the likeness of , Christ’s death, as signal, as entire, as much a death of cutting off and putting to shame and pain),  in order that (the aim and end of the συσταυρωθῆναι )  the body of sin might be annulled (“  τὸ σῶμ  .   τῆς ἁμαρτ . belongs together, and τῆς ἁμαρτ . is not to be joined with καταργ . as being = ἀπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτ . (Theodoret, Wahl); nor is τὸ σῶμ . τ . ἁμ ‘  the totality of sin ’ (Orig [36] 2, Theophyl. 1, Grot.); nor ‘  the substance or essence of sin ,’ after the Heb. (Rabbinical) usage of עֶצֶּם and גּוּף (Schöttg.): nor, ‘  the mass of sin ’ (Thol. 1); nor a mere figure to carry out the idea of being crucified with Christ (Calov., Wolf, Reiche, Olsh., Stuart 2, al.); nor = ἡ σὰρξ τ . ἁμαρτ ; but ‘  the body, which belongs to or serves sin ,’ in which sin rules or is manifested, = τὰ μέλη , Romans 6:13 , in which is ὁ νόμος τῆς ἁμαρτίας , ch. Romans 7:23 , τὸ σῶμα τ . θανάτου , ch. Romans 7:24 , αἱ πράξεις τοῦ σώματος , ch. Romans 8:13 , τὸ σῶμα τῆς σαρκός , Colossians 2:11 .” De Wette: with whom agree Orig [37] 1, Theophyl. 2, Beza, Bengel, Meyer, Tholuck, Stuart 1, al. But as De W. further remarks, we must not understand that the body is the  seat of sin , or at all events must no so understand those words as if the  principle of sin lay in the  body , which is not true, for it lies in the  will ).

	 καταργηθῇ  , might be rendered powerless (annulled as far as regards activity and energy. The word occurs twenty-five times in Paul’s Epistles (elsewhere, Luke 13:7 , Heb 2:14 only), and does not appear to signify absolute  annihilation , but as above. Gregory of Nyssa has gone into the meaning in his discourse on 1 Corinthians 15:28 , vol. i. p. 1325),  that we might no longer be in bondage (be slaves to)  sin (i.e. that the body should no longer be under the dominion of sin, see below, Rom 6:12 ).
