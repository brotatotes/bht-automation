<p><strong> 6.</strong> ] <strong> Knowing</strong> (recollecting) <strong> this, that our old man</strong> (former self, personality before our new birth opposed to καινός or νέος ἄνθρ ., καινὴ κτίσις , see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17">2 Corinthians 5:17</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22-24">Ephesians 4:22-24</span> , not merely the guilt of sin, nor the power of sin, but the <em> man</em> . The idea is not Jewish, as Tholuck has shewn: the passage quoted from the Sohar-chadasch not bearing the meaning commonly given to it, and if it did, that book itself being a production probably of the sixteenth century) <strong> was</strong> (at our baptism) <strong> crucified with Him</strong> (the great key to our text is ref. Gal. As the death of the Lord Jesus was by <em> crucifixion</em> , the Apostle uses the same expression of our death to our former sinful self, which is not only by virtue of, but also <em> in the likeness of</em> , Christ’s death, as signal, as entire, as much a death of cutting off and putting to shame and pain), <strong> in order that</strong> (the aim and end of the συσταυρωθῆναι ) <strong> the body of sin might be annulled</strong> (“ <strong> τὸ σῶμ</strong> <strong> . </strong> <strong> τῆς ἁμαρτ</strong> . belongs together, and τῆς ἁμαρτ . is not to be joined with καταργ . as being = ἀπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτ . (Theodoret, Wahl); nor is τὸ σῶμ . τ . ἁμ ‘ <em> the totality of sin</em> ’ (Orig [36] 2, Theophyl. 1, Grot.); nor ‘ <em> the substance or essence of sin</em> ,’ after the Heb. (Rabbinical) usage of עֶצֶּם and גּוּף (Schöttg.): nor, ‘ <em> the mass of sin</em> ’ (Thol. 1); nor a mere figure to carry out the idea of being crucified with Christ (Calov., Wolf, Reiche, Olsh., Stuart 2, al.); nor = ἡ σὰρξ τ . ἁμαρτ ; but ‘ <em> the body, which belongs to or serves sin</em> ,’ in which sin rules or is manifested, = τὰ μέλη , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:13">Romans 6:13</span> , in which is ὁ νόμος τῆς ἁμαρτίας , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:23">Romans 7:23</span> , τὸ σῶμα τ . θανάτου , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:24">Romans 7:24</span> , αἱ πράξεις τοῦ σώματος , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span> , τὸ σῶμα τῆς σαρκός , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span> .” De Wette: with whom agree Orig [37] 1, Theophyl. 2, Beza, Bengel, Meyer, Tholuck, Stuart 1, al. But as De W. further remarks, we must not understand that the body is the <em> seat of sin</em> , or at all events must no so understand those words as if the <em> principle of sin</em> lay in the <em> body</em> , which is not true, for it lies in the <em> will</em> ).

The word occurs twenty-five times in Paul’s Epistles (elsewhere, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:7">Luke 13:7</span> , Heb 2:14 only), and does not appear to signify absolute <em> annihilation</em> , but as above. Gregory of Nyssa has gone into the meaning in his discourse on <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:28">1 Corinthians 15:28</span> , vol. i. p. 1325), <strong> that we might no longer be in bondage</strong> (be slaves to) <strong> sin</strong> (i.e. that the body should no longer be under the dominion of sin, see below, Rom 6:12 ).</p>
