<b> 7.</b>] The difficulty of this verse arises from the Apostle having in a short and pregnant sentence expressed a whole similitude, joining, as he elsewhere does in such cases, the subject: of the first limb of the comparison with the predicate of the second. Fully expressed, it would stand thus: ‘For, as a man that is dead is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage (among<i> men</i>: no reference to<i> God’s</i> judgment of him): so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin, and released from its bondage.’ All this is implied in the word used, ‘is acquitted,’ ‘has his quittance,’ from sin, so that Sin (personified) has no more claims on him, either as a creditor or as a master: cannot detain him for debt, nor sue him for service. A larger reference is thus given to the assertion than the purposes of the present argument, which is treating of the power, not the guilt of sin, required: but that it is so, lies in the nature of<i> sin</i>, the service of which is guilt, and the deliverance from whose service necessarily brings with it<i> acquittal</i>.
