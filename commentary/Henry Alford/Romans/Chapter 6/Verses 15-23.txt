<p><strong> 15 23.</strong> ] <em> The being under grace</em> (free from the condemnation of sin) <em> and not under the law, is no encouragement to sin: for</em> ( Rom 6:16-19 ) <em> we have renounced the service of sin, and have become the servants of righteousness: and</em> ( Rom 6:20-23 ) <em> the consequences of the service of sin are terrible and fatal, whereas those of the service of righteousness are blessed and glorious</em> .</p>
