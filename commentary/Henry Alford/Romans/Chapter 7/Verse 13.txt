 13. ]  Did then the good (= ‘that which was good,’ i.e. ἡ ἐντολή , but made abstract for the sake of greater contrast)  become death (so ὁ νόμ .,  ἁμαρτια , Rom 7:7  ) to me ? Was it, after all,  the commandment itself that became to me this death of which I speak?
	 Far from it: but (it was)  sin (that became death to me.
	The construction adopted by Vulg., Luth., al., ἀλλὰ ἡ ἁματρία , ἵνα φανῇ ἁμ ., διὰ τ . ἀγ . μοι κατεργαζομένη [ ἧν ] θάνατον , is hardly admissible);  that it might appear (be shewn to be)  sin , (by)  working death to me by means of the good (that which was good: see above. The misuse and perversion of good is one of the tests whereby the energy of evil is detected; so that sin, by its perversion of the (good) commandment into a cause (evil) of death, was shewn in its real character  as sin . That this is the rendering is evident by the following clause, which is parallel with it. Erasm., Valla, Elsner, Dr. Burton, al., make ἁμαρτία the  subject : ‘that sin might appear to be working death, &c.’ (‘so that sin  appears to  have effected my death,’ &c. Dr. Burton, most ungrammatically): there is no objection to this on the ground of ἁμαρτ . being anarthrous, as even Bp. Middleton himself reluctantly acknowledges; the objection lies in the context, as above),  that (explains and runs parallel with the former ἵνα , as in 2 Corinthians 9:3 , where he adds to the 2nd ἵνα , καθὼς ἔλεγον )  by means of the commandment sin might become exceeding (above measure)  sinful : i.e. that sin, which was before unknown as such, might, being vivified and brought into energy by (its opposition to) the commandment, be brought out as being (not merely ‘  shewn to be ’) exceedingly sinful (sinful in an exaggerated degree prominent in its true character as the opponent of God).
