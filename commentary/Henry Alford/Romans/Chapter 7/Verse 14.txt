<p><strong> 14</strong> .] On the change into the present tense here, see above in the remarks on the whole section. Hitherto has been <em> historical</em> : now the Apostle passes to the <em> present time</em> , keeping hold yet of the carnal ἐγώ of former days, whose remnants are still energizing in the renewed man. <strong> For</strong> (by way of explaining and setting in still clearer light the relative positions of sin and the law, and the state of inner conflict brought about by their working) <strong> we know</strong> (it is an acknowledged principle amongst us, see reff.) <strong> that the law is spiritual</strong> (sprung from God, who is a Spirit, and requiring of men spiritual purity. These meanings, which have been separately held by different Commentators, may, as Thol. and De W. observe, well be united): <strong> but I</strong> (see beginning of section) <strong> am carnal</strong> ([subject to the law of the flesh, and in bondage to it, see below] σάρκινος , stronger than σαρκικός ; <em> carneus</em> rather than <em> carnalis</em> , but it is doubtful whether the two endings were not used indiscriminately: see Tholuck), <strong> sold</strong> (into slavery, see reff.; but the similitude must not be exacted in <em> all particulars</em> , for it is only the fact of slavery, as far as its victim, <em> the man</em> , is concerned, which is here prominent) <strong> under</strong> (to, and so as to be under the power of) <strong> sin</strong> .

<p>Tholuck (who differs from the view of this section advocated above, yet) adds here: “The ἐγώ appears here in its totality as sinful, while in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:16">Romans 7:16</span> ; Rom 7:20 it is distinguished from sin. That Paul does not here bear in mind this distinction, may be justified by the maxim, ‘à potiori fit denominatio;’ the ἐγώ is a slave, and has not his own will: as Rom 7:23 shews, the ἐγώ which is hostile to sin, the νόμος τοῦ νοός , is under coercion, and the man is a captive. So Arrian in Epict. ii. 22: ὅπου γὰρ τὸ ἐγὼ καὶ τὸ ἐμόν , ἐκεῖ ἀνάγκη ῥέπειν τὸ ζῶον , εἰ ἐν <strong> σαρκἰ</strong> , ἐκεῖ τὸ κυριεῦον εἶναι , εἰ ἐν προαιρέσει , ἐκεῖνο (qu. ἐκεῖ ?) εἶναι .”

<p>The latter clause of the verse is the very strongest assertion of man’s subjection to the slavery of sin in his carnal nature.</p>
