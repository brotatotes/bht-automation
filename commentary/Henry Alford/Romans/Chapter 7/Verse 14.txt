<b> 14.</b>] On the change into the present tense here, see above in the remarks on the whole section. Hitherto, the passage has been<i> historical</i>: now the Apostle passes to the<i> present time</i>, keeping hold yet of the carnal self of former days, whose remnants are still energizing in the renewed man.—<b>For</b> (by way of explaining and setting in still clearer light the relative positions of sin and the law, and the state of inner conflict brought about by their working)<b> we know</b> (it is an acknowledged principle amongst us)<b> that the law is spiritual</b> (sprung from God, who is a Spirit, and requiring of men spiritual purity. These meanings, which have been separately held by different commentators may well be united):<b> but I</b> (see beginning of section)<b> am carnal</b> (subject to the law of the flesh, and in bondage to it, see below),<b> sold</b> (into slavery: but the similitude must not be exacted in<i> all particulars</i>, for it is only the fact of slavery, as far as its victim,<i> the man</i>, is concerned, which is here prominent)<b> under</b> (to, and so as to be under the power of)<b> sin</b>.—Tholuck (who differs from the view of this section advocated above, yet) adds here: “The ‘<i>I</i>’ appears here in its totality as sinful, while in vv. 16, 20 it is distinguished from sin. That St. Paul does not here bear in mind this distinction, may be justified by the maxim, that a thing takes its name from its principal component: the ‘<i>I</i>’ is a slave, and has not his own will: as ver. 23 shews, the ‘<i>I</i>,’ which is hostile to sin, the<i> law of the mind</i>, is under coercion, and the man is a captive.” The latter clause of the verse is the very strongest assertion of man’s subjection to the slavery of sin in his carnal nature.
