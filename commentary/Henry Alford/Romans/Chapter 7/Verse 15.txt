The meaning, ‘  I approve not ,’ introduced by Aug [45] and held by Erasm., Beza, Grot., Estius, Semler, al., is not sanctioned by usage, see note on 1 Corinthians 8:3 , and would make the following clause almost a tautology): for (explanation of last assertion, shewing how such blind service comes to pass)  not what I desire, that do I (this θέλω is not the  full determination of the will , the standing with the bow drawn and the arrow aimed; but rather the  inclination of the will, the taking up the bow and pointing at the mark, but without power to draw it: -we have θέλω in the sense of  to wish , 1Co 7:7 ; 1 Corinthians 7:32 ; 1 Corinthians 14:5 ; 2Co 12:20 ),  but what I hate (= οὐ θέλω , Romans 7:19 ; no distinction in intensity between θέλω and μισῶ ),  that I do (no distinction here between πράσσω and ποιῶ , as apparently in John 3:20-21 , where see note: for they are interchanged in Rom 7:19-20 ).

	The Commentators cite several parallel passages from profane writers: e.g. Seneca, Hippol. 604, ‘Vos testor omnes cœlites, hoc quod volo, me nolle;’ Epictetus, Enchiridion ii. 26, ἐπεὶ γὰρ ὁ ἁμαρτάνων οὐ θέλει ἁμαρτάνειν , ἀλλὰ κατορθῶσαι , δῆλον ὅτι ὃ μὲν θέλει οὐ ποιεῖ , καὶ ὃ μὴ θέλει ποιεῖ : the well-known lines of Ovid, Met. Romans 7:19 , ‘aliudque cupido, Mens aliud suadet: video meliora proboque, Deteriora sequor:’ Plautus, Trinummus iii. 2. 31, ‘Scibam ut esse me deceret, facere non quibam miser:’ &c.
