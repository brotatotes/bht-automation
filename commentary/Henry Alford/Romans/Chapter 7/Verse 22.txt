<b>Explanation of the conflict above alleged to exist.</b><b> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man</b> (the inward man is equivalent to<i> the mind</i>, ver. 25; compare St. Peter’s<i> “hidden man of the heart,”</i> 1 Pet. iii. 4. But not<i> merely</i> the<i> mental and reasoning part of man:</i>—for that surely<i> does not</i> delight in the law of God:—it is<i> absolutely necessary</i> to presuppose the<i> influence of the Holy Spirit,</i> and to place the man in<i> a state of grace, before this assertion can be true.</i> And it is surprising to find Commentators denying the gradual introduction of the<i> spiritual man</i> in the description of this conflict. TRUE, THE SPIRIT is not yet introduced, because purposely kept back until treated of as the great Deliverer from this state of death; the man is as yet described as compounded of the outer and inner man, of the flesh and the mind, and the operations of the two are detailed as<i> if unassisted,</i>—even the term<i> spirit</i>, for the human spirit, being as yet avoided,—but all this is done, because<i> the object is to set the conflict and misery, as existing even in the spiritual man, in the strongest light</i>, so that the question in ver. 24 may lead the way to the<i> real uses</i> and<i> blessed results</i> of this conflict in ch. viii.):
