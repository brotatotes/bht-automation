<b>but I see</b> (equivalent to<i> ‘find:’</i>—as if he were a spectator of that which is going on within)<b> a different law</b> (differing in kind and aim, not<i> “another”</i> merely)<b> in my members</b> (i. e. in my<i> flesh</i>, as in ver. 18)<b> warring against</b> (in continual dissension and conflict with)<b> the law of my mind</b> (the consent, viz.<b> to the law of God</b>, which my mind yields; not<i> the law of God</i>,—any more than the different law in my members is<i> the law of sin</i>,—but<i> both</i> meaning the standard or rule set up, which inclination follow:—the one in the mind,<i> in harmony with the law of God</i>,—the other in the members or flesh,<i> subservient</i>, and causing subservience,<i> to the principle or law of sin</i>),<b> and bringing me</b> (the whole complex self—the ‘me’ of personality and action)<b> into captivity to the law of sin</b> (the sinful principle, of resistance to God’s law:<i> sin</i>, as awakened and set energizing, ver. 9, by that law)<b> which is in my members.</b>—Commentators have much disputed whether this<i> different law</i>, and the<i> law of sin</i>, both being in<i> my members</i>, are<i> different</i>, or<i> the same</i>. It appears to me (see above) that the identity cannot be maintained without introducing great confusion into the sentence.
