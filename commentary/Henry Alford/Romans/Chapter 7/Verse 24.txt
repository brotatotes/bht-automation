 24 .]  The division of the man against himself, his inward conflict, and miserable state of captivity to sin in the flesh, while with the mind he loves and serves the law of God. From this wretched condition, which is a very death in life, who shall deliver him ?  σώματος cannot well be figurative, ‘  universitas vitiorum ,’ or ‘  mortifera peccati massa ,’ but must, on account of the part which ἡ σάρξ and τὰ μέλη have hitherto borne, be  literal . Then  how is  τούτου  to be taken ? Some (Syr., Erasm., Calv., Beza, Olsh., Winer) join it with σώματος , and (not Winer) justify the construction as a Hebraism: but Winer has refuted the notion (edn. 6, § 34. 3. b) of a Hebraism, and the arrangement has no Greek example. It can only be joined with θανάτου ; and that most fitly, as the  state which he has been describing is referred to by  τοῦ θανάτου τούτου . Then the body of this death will mean, ‘the body whose subjection to the law of sin brings about this state of misery,’ compare σῶμα τῆς ἁμαρτίας , ch. Romans 6:6 . From this body, as the instrument whereby he is led captive to the law of sin and death, he cries out for deliverance: i. e to be  set free , as ch. Romans 8:2 ,  from the law of sin and death .
	Some Commentators, misled by the notion of a Hendiadys ( σώματος τοῦ θ . = θνητοῦ σώματος ), a most fruitful source of error in exegesis, have imagined that the verse implies a wish to be  delivered from the body (by death), and expresses a  weariness of life .
	The cry is uttered, as De Wette well observes, in  full consciousness of the  deliverance which Christ has effected , and  as leading to the expression of thanks which follows. And so, and no otherwise, is it to be taken.
