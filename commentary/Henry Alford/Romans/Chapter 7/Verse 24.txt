<b> 24.]</b><i> The division of the man against himself,—his inward conflict, and miserable state of captivity to sin in the flesh, while with the mind he loves and serves the law of God. From this wretched condition, which is a very death in life, who shall deliver him?</i> The expression<b> body</b> cannot, well be figurative, meaning,<i> “the totality of sins,”</i> or<i> “the deadly mass of sin,”</i> but must, on account of the part which the<i> flesh</i> and the<i> members</i> have hitherto borne, be<i> literal</i>.<br><br><b> The body of this death</b> will mean, ‘the body whose subjection to the law of sin brings about this state of misery,’ compare<i> “the body of sin,”</i> ch. vi. 6. From this body, as the instrument whereby he is led captive to the law of sin and death, he cries out for deliverance: i.e. to be<i> set free</i>, as ch. viii. 2,<i> from the law of sin and death</i>.—The cry is uttered, as De Wette well observes, in<i> full consciousness</i> of the<i> deliverance which Christ has</i><i> effected</i>, and as<i> leading to the expression of thanks</i> which follows. And so, and no otherwise, is it to be taken.
