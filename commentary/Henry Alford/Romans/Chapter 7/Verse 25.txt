<b> 25.]</b> The thanksgiving sentence is (not, of course, constructionally, but logically) an<i> answer</i> to the<i> preceding question:</i><b> Thanks be to God</b> (who hath accomplished this)<b> through Jesus Christ our Lord.</b>—This exclamation and thanksgiving more than all convince me, that St. Paul speaks of<i> none other than himself</i>, and<i> carries out as far as possible</i> the misery of the conflict with sin in his members,<i> on purpose to bring in the glorious deliverance which follows.</i>—Compare 1 Cor. xv. 56, 57, where a very similar thanksgiving occurs.<br><br><b> So then, &c.]</b> These words are most important to the understanding of the whole passage. We must bear in mind that it had begun with the question, IS THE LAW SIN? The Apostle has proved that it is NOT, but is HOLY. He has shewn the<i> relation that it holds to sin</i>, viz. that of<i> vivifying it</i> by means of man’s natural aversion to the commandment. He has further shewn that in himself, even as delivered by Christ Jesus, a conflict between the law and sin is ever going on: the misery of which would be death itself, were not a glorious deliverance effected. He now sums up his vindication of the law as holy; and at the same time, sums up the other side of the evidence adduced in the passage, from which it appears that the flesh is still, even in the spiritual man, subject (<i>essentially</i>, not practically and energetically) to the law of sin,—which subjection, in its nature and consequences, is so nobly treated in chap viii.<br><br><b>—So then</b> (as appears from the foregoing),<b> I myself</b> (I, who have said all this against and in disparagement of the law; I, who write of justification by faith without the deeds of the law; I, Paul, who am writing to you, and as I write it to you)<b> with the mind</b> (the<i> “mind”</i> is<i> “the inward man,”</i> as in ver. 23)<b> serve the law of God</b> (which after the inward man he delights in, ver. 22),<b> but with the flesh</b> (the<i> “I”</i> of ver. 18; and<i> the flesh,</i> throughout, of ch. viii.)<b> the law of sin.</b> It remains to be seen, how this latter subjection, which in the<i> natural man carries all with it,</i> is<i> neutralized</i>, and issues only in the death of the<i> body</i> on account of sin,<i> in those who do not walk after the flesh, but after the Spirit</i>.
