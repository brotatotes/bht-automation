<b> 7.</b>] See note, ch. vi. 1.<br><br><b> Is the law</b> (not ‘<i>conscience</i>,’ but in our case, the revealed law of God, which awoke the conscience to action)<b> sin</b>?—not ‘<i>the cause of sin</i>,’ which in one sense the Apostle would not have denied,—but<i> sin</i>, abstract for concrete,<i> sinful</i>, or, as Bengel expresses it,<i> the sinful cause of sin</i>. The question itself refers back to ver. 5, where the Apostle had spoken of “<i>the stirrings of sins which were through the law</i>.” It is asked,<i> not by an objector</i>, but by the Apostle himself, in anticipation of an objection.<br><br><b> Nevertheless</b>] i.e.<b> but what I mean is</b>....,–<b>I say not that, but</b>....<br><br><b> I had not known</b>] The literal rendering of the original sentence is,<b> I was living in a state of ignorance of sin, were it not</b>.... Then<i> what</i> is the<b> sin</b> here spoken of? Is it sin in<i> act</i>, or sin in<i> principle</i>,—the principle of sin? Not<i> sin in act</i>, so that<i> I had not known sin</i> should mean, ‘<i>I had not entered into contact with sin</i>,’ i.e. ‘<i>had not sinned:’</i> for then the law would have truly and actually been the cause of sin: nor,<i> sin in act</i>, so that the meaning were, ‘<i>I had not known the nature of a sinful act?”</i> for this would not agree with the subordination of the one particular sin specified below: the<i> coveting itself</i> being more general than the particular acts which it induced. But the reference must be to<i> sin in principle</i>, the principle of sin:<b> I had not recognized such a thing as sin, but by means of the law</b>.<b> The law</b> here is in the full sense of<i> the Mosaic law</i> as regarded<i> himself</i>,—not excluding the wider sense on which I have insisted in the former part of the Epistle when applied to<i> others</i>.<br><br><b> for I had not known</b> (by experience: ‘known any thing of’)<b> coveting</b> (this rendering is better than “lust” of the A.V.: the substantive here being the one corresponding to the verb in the commandment. So also in ver. 8,<b> coveting</b> is better than “<i>concupiscence</i>.’ The word expresses the motions of the flesh towards sin,—whether acted on or not,—whether consented to or not:—this<i> motion</i> he would not have<i> perceived</i>, because he was simply<i> moving with it</i>),<b> if the law had not said, Thou shalt not covet</b> (Exod. xx. 17. Deut. v. 21). ‘<i>Covet</i>,’ in the above sense. The Apostle omits all the objects there specified, and merely lays hold of the idea contained in the prohibition. And it may well be said and strictly, that the ‘coveting’ there spoken of would lead to all kinds of sin—therefore murder, adultery, &c., if carried out: and that the prohibition of coveting there serves as an example of what the law actually forbids elsewhere.
