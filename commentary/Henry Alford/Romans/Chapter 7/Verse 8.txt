<b> 8.</b>]<b> But</b> (proceeding with the development of sin by means of the law)<b> sin</b> (the sinful principle or propensity, but without any conscious personification on the part of the Apostle),<b> having found occasion</b> (<i>occasion</i> means more than mere<i> opportunity</i>,—it indicates the furnishing the material and ground of attack, the<i> wherewith</i> and<i> whence</i> to attack, The words here are not to be joined with<b> through the commandment</b> following, which belongs to the verb<b> wrought</b>: see below),<b> through</b> (by means of)<b> the commandment</b> (meaning, not<i> the law</i> generally, but the<i> tenth commandment</i>, the prohibition in question)<b> wrought in me</b> (not ‘<i>wrought out</i>, ‘brought into action,’ but<br><br> ‘<i>originated</i>,’—using this commandment as its instrument)<b> all</b> (<b>manner of</b>)<b> coveting</b>.<b> For without the law sin is</b> (not ‘<i>was</i>:’ the sentence is a general axiom,—compare ch. iv. 15)<b> dead</b> (powerless and inactive: comp. 1 Cor. xv. 56, “<i>the strength of sin is the law</i>”’).—This<i> deadness of sin without the law</i> must not be understood as meaning that sin was committed but not recognized, the conscience being not informed nor awakened: such a statement would be<i> true</i>, but would<i> not touch the matter argued here</i>. Erasmus well explains this word<b> dead</b>: ‘Before the law was promulgated (but see below) I was ignorant of some sins, and only knew thus much of others, that I thought I might commit them because they were not forbidden: so that my mind was more lightly and languidly moved towards sin; for we ever have colder love towards those things which we can enjoy whenever we like. But when the law marked out so many different forms of sins, the whole band of lusts and desires, irritated by the prohibition, began more eagerly to solicit me towards sin.’ Compare also Prov. ix. 17; and the citations from the classics in my Greek Test., to the effect that prohibition itself irritates and incites towards violation of the command.
