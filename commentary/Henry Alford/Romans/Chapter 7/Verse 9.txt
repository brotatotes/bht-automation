<b> 9.</b>] It is a great question with Interpreters,<i> of what period</i> St. Paul here speaks, Those who sink his own personality, and think that he speaks merely as one of mankind, or of the Jews, understand it of the period before the law was given: some, of Adam in Paradise before (?) the prohibition: those who see St. Paul himself throughout the whole think that he speaks,—some, of his state<i> as a Pharisee</i>: this however would necessitate the understanding the legal death which follows, of his<i> conversion</i>, which cannot well be: some, of his state as a<i> child</i>, before that freedom of the will is asserted which causes rebellion against the law as the will of another. Agreeing in some measure with the last view, I would extend<br><br> the limits further, and say that he speaks of<i> all that time, be it mere childhood or much more, before the law began its work within him</i>,—before the deeper energies of his moral nature were aroused (see on “<i>the commandment</i><b> came</b>” below).—<b>And I was alive</b> (not merely ‘<i>lived</i>’ ‘went on,’ but emphatic, i.e. ‘lived and flourished,’—contrasted with “<i>died</i>” below)<b> without the law</b> (the law having uo recognized place in my moral existence)<b> once</b>;<b> but when the commandment</b> (above, ver. 8)<b> came</b> (purely subjective; not ‘<i>was enacted</i>,’ ‘came in,’—but ‘<i>came to me</i>,’ as we siy, ‘<i>came home to me</i>,’ ‘was brought home to me’),<b> sin came to</b> (sprung into)<b> life</b> (not ‘<i>revived</i>:’ however<i> true</i> it may be that sin was<i> merely dormant</i>, the idea insisted on here is, that it was<i> dead</i> and<i> came to life</i>, began to live and flourish),<b> and I died</b> (ceased to live-and-flourish as before,—fell into that state of unhappiness, which ever afterwards under the gospel he calls<i> death</i>, ver. 24; ch. viii. 2);
