 9 .] It is a great question with Interpreters,  of what period Paul here speaks. Those who sink his own personality, and think that he speaks merely as one of mankind, or of the Jews, understand it of the period before the law was given: some, of Adam in Paradise before (?) the prohibition: those who see Paul himself throughout the whole think that he speaks, some, of his state  as a Pharisee : this however would necessitate the understanding the legal death which follows, of his  conversion , which cannot well be: some, of his state as a  child , before that freedom of the will is asserted which causes rebellion against the law as the will of another: so Meyer, Thol., al. Agreeing in some measure with the last view, I would extend the limits further, and say that he speaks of  all that time, be it mere childhood or much more, before the law began its work within him , before the deeper energies of his moral nature were aroused (see on  ἐλθούσης below).
	 But ( ἔζων opposed, but only formally, to νεκρά , and so having δέ : so Meyer and De W.)  I was alive (not merely ‘  lived ,’ ‘went on,’ but emphatic, ‘  vivus eram ,’ as Aug [44] , i.e. ‘lived and flourished,’ contrasted with ἀπέθανον below)  without the law (the law having no recognized place in my moral existence)  once; but when the commandment (above, Rom 7:8 )  came (purely subjective; not ‘  was enacted ,’ ‘came in,’ but ‘  came to me ,’ as we say,  ‘came home to me,’ ‘was brought home to me’),  sin sprung into life (not ‘  revived :’ however  true it may be that sin was  merely dormant , the idea insisted on here, is, that it was  dead and  came to life , began to live and flourish: but this is not to be compared with ἀνέβλεψα in John 9:11 ; see note there),
