This is certain from the<i> “for”</i> which follows, setting forth the fact of the deliverance)<b> no condemnation</b> (that condemnation which is the penal consequence of sin original and actual)<b> to them which are in Christ Jesus.</b> (The expression<b> in Christ Jesus</b> refers particularly to the last place where<i> God’s gift of life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord</i> was spoken of, ch. vi. 23,—and generally to all that was said in that chapter of our incorporation into and union with Him.)—The words<i> “who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit,”</i> are probably an interpolation introduced from ver. 4, right enough in sense (see there), but out of place here, because this<i> moral</i> element of ‘those who are in Christ’ is<i> not yet brought in:</i> the present assertion is<i> general</i>, and is made good in detail by and by. The clause is wanting in almost all our earliest copies.
