<b> 11.</b>]<b> But</b> (he takes up and continues the supposition in the former verse, with which in fact this is nearly identical, but with the important additional particular [whence the contrast] that Jesus was raised)<b> if the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you</b> (which Spirit is therefore<i> powerful over death</i>, and besides renders you<i> partakers of Christ’s Resurrection</i>),<b> He that raised up Christ from the dead</b> (the personal name, JESUS, reminds us more of the historic fact of the resurrection of the one Person, Jesus: the official and mystical name, CHRIST, of the body of which he is the Head and we the members,—all raised with Him by the one Spirit dwelling in all)<b> shall quicken</b> (<b>make alive</b>: not merely<i> shall raise up</i>, because it is not merely the resurrection of the body which is in the Apostle’s view,—see below)<b> even your mortal bodies</b> (the higher phase of the quickening takes place in the<i> spirit</i> of man: and even of that which takes place in the body, there are two branches—one, the quickening it from being a tool of unrighteousness unto death [eternal],—the other, the quickening it out of death [physical] to be a new and glorified body. And the<b> even</b>, joined with<i> your mortal bodies</i> here, signifies that the working of the quickening (life-giving) Spirit shall not stop at the purely spiritual resurrection, nor at that of the body from dead works to serve the living God, but shall extend<i> even to the building up the spiritual body in the future new and glorious life</i>) by reason of<b> His Spirit which dwells in you</b>.—Here the reading in the original is much disputed. One form of it can only mean, ‘by means of,’ ‘through,’ His Spirit, &c.: this the other may<i> include</i>, (it not being specified<i> for what reason</i> it is<i> on the Spirit’s account</i>, and leaving it open to be His<i> presence</i>, or His<i> agency</i>,) but must be expressed ‘on account of,’ or ‘because of,’ His Spirit. Both expressions<i> may</i> imply that the Holy Spirit is the<i> agent</i> in the quickening; but the former,<i> by means of</i>, cannot bear the other meaning, that God will quicken, &c.<i> because of</i> His Spirit, &c. Hence in dispute with the<i> Macedonian</i> heretics, who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit, this reading was important to the orthodox, as expressing agency, and that alone. But it seems pretty clear that the variation was older than the time of this heresy [Cent. IV.]; and, however it may then have been appealed to, its origin cannot be assigned to any falsification by either of the then disputant parties.—As to how far the Holy Spirit is the<i> direct Agent</i> in the resurrection of the body, see note on<i> life-giving</i>, or<i> quickening Spirit</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 45, and on 2 Cor. v. 5. Here, His direct agency cannot be in any way surprising, for it is<i> the whole process of bringing from death to life, extending even to the mortal body</i>, which is here spoken of—and unquestionably, ‘the Lord and Giver of Life’ is the agent throughout in this quickening. “He is not speaking,” says Calvin, “of the last resurrection, which shall take place in a moment, but of the continued operation of the Spirit, which, extinguishing by degrees the remainder of the fleshly mind, restores in us celestial life:”—but perhaps he had better have said “not<i> only</i> of the last resurrection:” for it certainly is<i> one thing</i> spoken of.
