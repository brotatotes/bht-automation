<b>So then, brethren, we are</b> (inference from the assurance in the last verse)<b> debtors</b> (we owe fealty: to what or whom, he leaves the reader to supply from ver. 11),<b> not to the flesh, to live after the flesh</b> (Chrysostom well explains the qualification,<i> to live after the flesh</i>: “For indeed we<i> are</i> debtors to it in many respects; in the duty of nourishing it, of cherishing it, of refreshing it, of healing it when sick, of clothing it, and paying it a hundred other services. That it may not be imagined that the Apostle is repudiating these obligations, when he has said ‘<i>we are not</i><i> debtors to the flesh,’</i> he explains what he means, by adding<i> ‘to live ‘after the flesh</i>:’ i.e. we must not make it lord of our lives”).
