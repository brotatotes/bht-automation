<b>For if ye live after the flesh, ye must</b> (or<b> will</b>,—are sure to,—it will be the<i> certain</i> end of your present course)<b> die</b> (both<b> live</b> and<b> die</b> here are in their full and pregnant sense, involving body and soul here and hereafter: but not to be understood as excluding the carnal from<i> any</i> resurrection—only from that which is truly<i> life</i>,—any more than the spiritual are exempted from<i> all</i> death, but only from that which is truly<i> death</i>):<b> but if by the Spirit ye mortify</b> (literally,<b> slay</b>,<b> put to death</b>: i.e. abolish, annul)<b> the deeds</b> (as Col. iii. 9, the whole course of habits and action which has the flesh for its prompter)<b> of the body</b> (this amounts to saying “<i>of the flesh</i>,” but is here put in the concrete, to give more vivid reality. The Apostle calls them<i> the deeds of the flesh</i> in Gal. v. 19),<b> ye shall live</b> (not “ye<i> must</i>, or<i> will</i>, live;” this<i> Life</i> being no natural consequence of a course of mortifying the deeds of the body, but the gift of God through Christ: and coming therefore in the form ofan assurance, ‘<i>ye shall live</i>,’ from Christ’s Apostle.—On what is meant by<i> living</i>, see above).
