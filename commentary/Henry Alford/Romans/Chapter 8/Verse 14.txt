<b> 14.</b>]<b> For</b> (ground of the assurance contained in the announcement, “<i>ye shall live</i>”)<b> as many as are led by</b> (the slaying the deeds of the body by the Spirit, implies the being under the Spirit’s guidance)<b> the Spirit of God, they</b> (emphatic— ‘these and no others’)<b> are sons of God</b>.—A<i> son</i> of God differs from a<i> child</i> of God, in implying the higher and more mature, and conscious member of God’s family, see Gal. iv. 1–6, and note on 6. Hence<i> our Lord is never called</i> the<i> Child</i>,<i> but always the Son</i> of God. This latter, applied to a Christian, signifies ‘one born of God’ in the deepest relation to Him,— and hence a partaker of His nature, 1 John iii. 9; 1 Pet. i. 23.
