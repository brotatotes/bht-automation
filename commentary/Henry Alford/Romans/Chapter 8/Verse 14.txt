<p>νἱὸς θ . differs from τέκνον θ . in implying the higher and more mature and conscious member of God’s family, see <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:1-6">Galatians 4:1-6</span> , and note on 6. Hence <em> our Lord is never called</em> τέκνον <em> but always</em> <strong> νἱὸς</strong> θεοῦ . This latter, applied to a Christian, signifies ‘one born of God’ in the deepest relation to him, and hence a partaker of His nature, 1Jn 3:9 ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23">1 Peter 1:23</span> (Tholuck, similarly Olsh.).</p>
