<b> 16.</b>]<i> And this confidence is grounded on the testimony of the Spirit itself</i>. So Chrysostom: “I assert this, says the Apostle, not merely from the cry itself, but from the cause out of which the cry arises:... for it is not a cry belonging alone to the state of grace, but belonging to the Comforter who gave the gift: for it is He Himself who taught us, being in the state of grace, thus to cry.” This verse, being without any conjunction coupling it to what went before, is best understood to refer to the same as the preceding, and the assertion to concern the same fact as the last verb, “<i>we cry</i>,” grounding that fact on an aet of the indwelling Spirit Himself. See again Gal. iv. 6.—<b>The Spirit itself</b> (the word<i> itself</i> expresses the independence, and at the same time, as coming from God, the preciousness and importance of the testimony)<b> beareth witness to our spirit</b> (see ch. ii. 15, and note: not, asin A.V., ‘beareth witness<i> with</i> our spirit,’ which is not the usage of the verb in the original. It is the same word as in Rev. xxii. 18, “<i>I bear witness unto</i><i> every one, &c.</i>”),<b> that we are children of God</b>.—What is this<i> witness of the Spirit itself</i>? All have agreed, and indeed this verse is decisive for it, that it is<i> something separate from, and higher than, all our own inferences and conclusions</i>. But on the other hand it does<i> not consist in mere indefinite feeling</i>, but in a<i> certitude of the Spirit’s presence and work continually asserted within us</i>. It is manifested, as Olshausen beautifully says, in His comforting us, His stirring us up to prayer, His reproof of our sins, His drawing us to works of love, to bear testimony before the world, &c. And he adds, with equal truth, “On this direct testimony of the Holy Ghost rests,<i> ultimately</i>, all the regenerate man’s conviction respecting Christ and His work. For belief in Scripture itself (he means, in the highest sense of the term ‘belief,’ ‘<i>conviction personally applied’</i>) has its foundation in this experience of the divine nature of the (influencing) Principle which it promises, and which, while the believer is studying it, infuses itself into him.”—The same Commentator remarks, that this is one of the most decisive passages against the pantheistic view of the identity of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. However the one may by renovating power be rendered like the other, there still is a specific difference. The spirit of man may<i> sin</i> (2 Cor. vii. 1), the Spirit of God<i> cannot</i>, but can only be grieved (Eph. iv. 30), or quenched (1 Thess. v. 19): and it is by the infusion of this highest Principle of Holiness, that man becomes ONE SPIRIT with the Lord Himself (1 Cor. vi. 17).<br><br><b> children of God</b>] Here it is<b> children</b>, not<i> sons</i>, because the testimony respects the very ground and central point of sonship,<i> likeness to and desire for God</i>: the testimony of the Spirit shewing us by our yearnings after, our confidence in, our regard to God, that we are verily begotten of Him.
