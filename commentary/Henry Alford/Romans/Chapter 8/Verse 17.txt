<b> 17.</b>] CONSEQUENCES<i> of our being children of God</i>.—<b>And if children, then</b> (or,<b> also) heirs</b> (which is the universal rule of mankind: but the word here must not be carried to the extent of the idea of<i> heir</i> in all directions: it is merely the<i> one side</i> of<i> inheriting by promise</i>, which is here brought out: the word referring back probably to ch. iv. 13, 14, the promise to Abraham);<b> heirs of God</b> (as our Father, giving the inheritance to us),<b> and joint-heirs</b><b> with Christ</b> (whom God has made<i> heir of</i><i> all things</i>, Heb. i. 2.—Tholuck remarks: “It is by virtue of their substantial unity with the father, that the children come into participation of his possession. The Roman law regarded them as continuators of his personality. The<i> dignity</i> of the inheritance is shewn (1) by its being God’s possession, (2) by its being the possession of the Firstborn of God. By the Roman law, the share of the firstborn was no greater than that of the other children,—and the New Test. sets forth this view, making the redeemed equal to Christ (ver. 29), and Christ’s possessions, theirs; 1 Cor. iii. 21–23; John xvii, 22. In the<i> joint heirship</i> we must not bring out this point, that Christ is<i> the rightful Heir</i>, who shares His inheritance with the other children of God: it is as adoptive children that they get the inheritance, and Christ is so far only the means of it, as He gives them power to become sons of God, John i. 12”);<b> if (at least)</b> (on this<i> if</i>, see above on ver. 9)<b> we are suffering with Him, that we may also be glorified with Him</b>: i.e. ‘if (provided that) we are found in that course of participation in Christ’s sufferings, whose aim and end, as that of His sufferings, is to be glorified as He was, and with Him.’ But the<b> if</b> does not regard the<i> subjective</i> aim, nor does it mean, ‘If at least our<i> aim</i> in suffering is, to be glorified,’—but the<i> fact</i> of our being partakers of that course of sufferings with Him,<i> whose aim is, wherever it is found</i>, to be glorified with Him.—The connexion of<i> suffering with Christ</i>, and<i> being glorified with Him</i> is elsewhere insisted on, see 2 Tim. ii. 11; 1 Pet. iv. 13; v. 1.—This last clause serves as a transition to vv. 18–30, in which the Apostle treats of the complete and glorious triumph of God’s elect, through sufferings and by hope, and the blessed renovation of all things in and by<i> their</i> glorification.
