 18. ]  For (= this suffering with Him in order to being glorified with Him is no casting away of toil and self-denial, seeing that)  I reckon (implying, ‘I myself am one who have embraced this course, being convinced’)  that the sufferings of this present period (of trial and sorrow, contrasted with the period of triumph following the παρονσία of Christ)  are insignificant ( οὐκ ἄξια = ἀνάξια , no gen. or verb understood. ἄξιος and ἀνάξιος are found in the sense of ‘  worthy (or  unworthy) to be compared with ’ in the classics: so Hom. Π . θ . 234, νῦν δ ʼ οὔθ ʼ ἑνὸς ἄξιοι ἐσμὲν Ἕκτορος , and Plato, Protag.

Bernard amplifies this de Convers. ad Cleric. c. xxi. 37 (30), vol. i. p. 494, ‘non sunt condignæ passiones hujus temporis ad præteritam culpam quæ remittitur, non ad præsentem consolationis gratiam quæ immittitur, non ad futuram gloriam quæ promittitur nobis.’
