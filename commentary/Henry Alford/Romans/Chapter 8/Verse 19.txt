<b> 19</b> ff.]<i> The greatness of this glory is shewn by the fact that</i> ALL CREATION,<i> now under the bondage of corruption, shall be set free from it by the glorification of the sons of God</i>.—<b>For</b> (proof of this transcendent greatness of the glory, not of the certainty of its manifestation, though this secondary thought is perhaps in the background)<b> the earnest expectation</b> (or,<b> patient expectation</b>, perhaps better: the original word denotes that the expectation continues till the time is exhausted, and the event arrives)<b> of the creation</b> (i. e. of<i> all this world except man</i>, both animate and inanimate: see an account of the expositions below)<b> is waiting for</b> (see above)<b> the revelation of the sons of God</b> ( “the glory is revealed,” says Bengel, “and simultaneously with it are revealed the sons of God.” It is the<b> sons</b>, not the<i> children</i>, because their sonship will be complete, and possessed of all its privileges and glories).<br><br><b> the creation</b> has been very variously understood. “The expression has by many been erroneously taken in an arbitrarily limited sense; e.g. as applying only, I. to<i> inanimate creation</i>: but against this are the words which follow,<i> not willingly</i>, and also the<i> groaning and travailing together in pain</i>, implying<i> life</i> in the<i> creation</i>,—for to set these down to mere personification is surely arbitrary:—and one can imagine no reason why bestial creation should be excluded. II. to<i> living creation</i>: (1) to<i> mankind</i>. Augustine and others take it of<i> men not yet believers</i>: (2) Locke and others, of the<i> yet unconverted Gentiles</i>: (3) some, of the<i> yet unconverted Jews</i>: (4) others again, of the<i> converted Gentiles</i>: or, (5) of the<i> converted Jews</i>: or, (6)<i> of all Christians</i>.”—But against the whole of these lies this objection, that if the Apostle had wished to speak of the<i> enslaving and freeing of mankind</i>, he hardly would have omitted reference to sin as the ground of the one, and faith of the other, and the judgment on unbelievers. But on the other hand we must not extend the idea of the creation<i> too wide</i>, as Theodoret, who includes the<i> angels</i>; others, who understand the<i> whole Creation</i>, animate and inanimate, rational and irrational: and others, who include the<i> unconverted Gentiles</i>: nor make it<i> too indefinite</i>, so as to take in<i> ‘the whole universe</i>.’ The right explanation is,<i> all animate and inanimate nature as distinguished from mankind</i>. The idea of the renovation and glorification of all nature at the revelation of the glory of our returned Saviour, will need no apology, nor seem strange, to the readers of this commentary, nor to the students of the following, and many other passages of the prophetic Word: Isa. xi. 6 ff.; lxv. 17 ff; Rey. xxi.; 2 Pet. iii. 13; Acts iii. 21.
