<b> 20.</b>]<i> Explanation of the</i> REASON WHY<i> all creation waits, &c</i>.—<b>For the creation was made subject to vanity</b> (vanity, as in Ps. xxxix. 6. So also Eccles. i. 2, and throughout. It signifies the<i> instability, liability to change and decay</i>, of all created things),<b> not willingly</b> (because all things by nature shrink from corruption),<b> but by reason of Him who made it subject</b> (i. e. God, who is the occasion, and His glory the end, of creation’s corruptibility—Chrysostom and others suppose the person meant to be<i> Adam</i>, who was the occasion of its being subjected; and at first sight the expression<i> by reason of</i> seems to favour this. But I very much doubt whether this view can be borne out. For does not the expression<b> him who made it subject</b> imply a<i> conscious act of intentional subjugation</i>, and not merely an<i> unconscious occasioning of the subjugation?</i> Thus we have it said of God, 1 Cor. xv. 27, “<i>He hath put all things in subjection under his feet</i>:” and, “<i>Then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that made all things subject unto him</i>.” And (2) he is speaking of the<i> originating cause</i> of this subjection, not of the efficient means of it. He says that creation was not subjected<i> willingly</i>, i.e. by reason of its own will, but<i> by reason of him who made it subject</i>. At the same time such a way of putting it, removing as it were the supreme will of God to a wider distance from corruption and vanity, and making it not so much the worker as the occasion of it, as well as this indefinite mention of Him, is quite intelligible on the ground of that reverential awe which so entirely characterizes the mind and writings of the Apostle. If the<i> occasion pointed at</i> by this<i> making subject</i> be required, I should hardly fix it at the Fall of man, but at his<i> creation</i>, in the eternal counsels,—when he was made<i> capable of falling, liable to change</i>.—The explanation of “<i>he that made it subject</i>,” as meaning ‘<i>the devil’</i> [Locke and others], hardly needs refutation, See Matt. x. 28, and note)<b> in</b> ( ‘<i>on condition of</i>,’ ‘<i>in a state of</i>’)<b> hope</b> (<b>in hope</b> must not be joined with the verb “<i>made it subject</i>,” because then the hope becomes<i> the hope of</i><b> Him</b>,—but with the former verb, “<i>was made subject</i>,” being the hope of the<i> thing subjected</i>),<b> because</b> (the original word will also admit of being rendered “<i>that</i>,” but not so well, for then it is not likely that “<i>the creation itself</i>” would be so emphatically repeated: the clause now announces a<i> new fact</i>, and thus the emphasis is accounted for. If we adopt the rendering<b> that</b>, we must suppose the whole following clause<i> subjective to the word</i><b> hope</b>, i.e. descriptive of that which is hoped for: and this would be to attribute to the yearnings of creation,<i> intelligence</i> and<i> rationality</i>,—consciousness of itself and of God)<b> the creation itself also</b> (not only we, the sons of God, but even creation itself)<b> shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption</b> (its subjection to the law of decay, see Heb. ii. 15)<b> into</b> (the construction is that which is called by grammarians a pregnant one:<i> shall be delivered from</i>,<i>&c., and admitted into</i>)<b> the liberty of the glory</b> ( ‘the liberty of the glory’ is not in any sense equivalent to ‘the glorious liberty;’ in the latter, ‘glorious’ is merely an epithet whereby the liberty is characterized, as in ‘His rest shall be glorious:’ in the former the liberty is described as consisting in, belonging to, being one component part of, the glorified state of the children of God: and thus the thought is carried up to the state to which the freedom belongs)<b> of the children</b> (<i>children</i> and not<i> sons</i> here, perhaps as embracing God’s universal family of creation, adinitted, each in their share, toa place in incorruptibility and glory)<b> of God.</b>
