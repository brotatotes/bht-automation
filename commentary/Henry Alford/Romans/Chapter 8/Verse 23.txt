<b> 23.</b>]<b> and</b> (moreover)<b> not only so</b> (i. e. not only is this the case with the creation),<b> but even we ourselves, having</b> (not ‘<i>which have</i>,’ but<i> ‘though we have’</i>)<b> the firstfruit of the Spirit</b> (i. e. the indwelling and influences of the Holy Spirit<i> here</i>, as an earnest of the full harvest of His complete possession of us, spirit and flesh and soul hereafter. That this is the meaning, seems evident from the analogy of St. Paul’s imagery regarding the Holy Spirit: he treats of Him as an<i> earnest</i> and<i> pledge</i> given to us, Eph. i. 14; 2 Cor. i. 22; v. 5, and of His full work in us as the efficient means of our glorification hereafter, ver. 11; 2 Cor. iii. 18. Various other renderings are,— (1) ‘<i>the first outpouring of the Spirit</i>,’ in point of time, which would be irrelevant: (2) ‘<i>the highest gifts of the Spirit</i>’ The genitive,<b> of</b><b> the Spirit</b>, may be<i> partitive</i> or<i> subjective</i>:—the firstfruit of the Spirit,—which<i> Spirit is</i> the harvest,—or the firstfruit of the Spirit, which the<i> Spirit gives</i>:—or even<i> in apposition</i>, the firstfruit of the Spirit, i.e. which<i> consists in</i> (the gift of)<i> the Spirit</i>. I prefer the first, from analogy—the Spirit being generally spoken of as<i> given</i>, not as<i> giving</i>,—and God as the Giver),<b> even we ourselves</b> (repeated for emphasis, and<i> we</i> inserted to involve himself and his fellow-workers in the general description of the last clause. Some have imagined<i> the Apostles only</i> to be spoken of: some, that the Apostles are meant in one place, and all Christians in the other)<b> groan within ourselves, waiting for the end of the</b> (or,<b> our</b>)<b> adoption</b> (the verb signifies, as above, ver. 19, but even more strongly here, ‘<i>wait out</i>,’ ‘wait for the end of,’ Our adoption is<i> come already</i>, ver. 15, so that we do not wait for<i> it</i>, but for the<i> full manifestation of it</i>, in our bodies being rescued from the bondage of corruption and sin),<b> to wit</b> [or<b> namely</b>], the<b> redemption</b> ( ‘<i>expecting that full and perfect adoption which shall consist in the redemption</i>’)<b> of our body</b> (not ‘<i>rescue from our body</i>,’ as some render it, which is inconsistent with the doctrine of the change of the vile and mortal into the glorious and immortal body,—Phil. iii. 21: 2 Cor. v. 2–4,—but the [entire] redemption,—rescue,—of the body from corruption and sin).
