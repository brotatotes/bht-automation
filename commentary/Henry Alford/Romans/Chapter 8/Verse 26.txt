<b> 26.</b>]<b> In like manner</b> (another help to our endurance, co-ordinate with the last—our patience is one help to it, but not the only one)<b> doth the Spirit also</b> (the Holy Spirit of God)<b> help our weakness</b> (not, help us<i> to bear</i> our weakness, as if the weakness were the burden, which the Spirit lifts for and with us,—but, helps<i> our weakness</i>,—<i>us who are weak</i>, to bear the burden of ver, 23. And this weakness is<b> not only</b> inability to pray aright, which is merely an<i> example</i> of it, but (<i>general weakness</i>):<b> for</b> (example of the help above mentioned;— ‘for<i> this</i>, viz. what to, &c.’)<b> we know not what we should pray for as we ought</b> (two things;—<i>what</i> we should pray,—the<i> matter</i> of our prayer;—and<i> how</i> we should pray for it,—the<i> form</i> and<i> manner</i> of our prayer):<b> but the Spirit itself</b> (Tholuck remarks,— “The addition of<b> itself</b> brings into more prominence the idea of the Spirit, so as to express of what dignity our Intercessor is,—an Intercessor who knows best what our wants are”)<b> maketh intercession</b> [<b>for us</b>] (these words are omitted in most of our ancient authorities)<b> with groanings which cannot be uttered</b>:—i. e. the Holy Spirit of God dwelling in us, knowing our wants better than we, Himself pleads in our prayers, raising us to higher and holier desires than we can express in words, which can only find utterance in sighings and aspirations: see next verse. Chrysostom interprets the words of the spiritual gift of prayer, and adds, “For the man who is granted this grace, standing praying in great earnestness, supplicating God with many mental groanings, asks what is good for all.” Calvin understands, that the Spirit suggests to us the proper words of acceptable prayer, which would<i> otherwise have been unutterable by us.</i> Macedonius gathered from this verse that the Holy Spirit is<i> a creature</i>, and<i> inferior to God</i>, because He<i> prays to God for us</i>. But as Augustine remarks, “The Holy Spirit groans not in Himself, with Himself, in the Holy Trinity, but<i> in us</i>, in that He makes us to groan.” No<i> intercession in heaven</i> is here spoken of, but a<i> pleading in us</i> by the indwelling Spirit, of a nature above our comprehension and utterance.
