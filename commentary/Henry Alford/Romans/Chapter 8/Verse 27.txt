<b> 27.</b>]<b> but</b> (opposed to the words “<i>which cannot be uttered</i>:” the groanings ‘are indeed unutterable by us, but...)<b> He that searcheth the hearts</b> (God)<b> knoweth what is the mind</b> (<i>intent</i>, or<i> bent</i>, as hidden in those sighs)<b> of the Spirit</b>. A difficulty presents itself in the rendering of the next clause. The particle with which it opens may mean either<b> because</b>, or<b> that</b>. If it is to be<i> causal</i>,<b> because He</b> (the Spirit)<b> pleads for the saints according to the will of God</b>, it would seem that<b> knows</b> must bear the meaning<i> ‘approves,’</i> otherwise the connexion will not be apparent; and so Calvin and others have rendered it. Hence many render it<b> that</b>,— ‘<i>knows what is the mind of the Spirit, that He pleads, &c. with</i> (or, according to)<i> God</i>.’ But I must confess that the other rendering seems to me better to suit the context: and I do not see that the ordinary meaning of the word<b> knoweth</b> need be changed. The assurance which we have that God the Heart-Searcher interprets the inarticulate sighings of the Spirit in us,—is not, strictly speaking, His Omniscience,—but<i> the fact that the very Spirit who thus pleads, does it</i> according to God,—in pursuance of the divine purposes and in conformity with God’s good pleasure.—All these pleadings of the Spirit are heard and answered, even when<i> inarticulately uttered</i>: we may extend the same comforting assurance to the<i> imperfect and mistaken verbal utterances</i> of our prayers, which are not themselves answered to our hurt, but the answer is given to the voice of the Spirit which speaks through them, which we<i> would</i> express, but<i> cannot</i>. Compare 2 Cor. xii. 7–10, for an instance in the Apostle’s own case.
