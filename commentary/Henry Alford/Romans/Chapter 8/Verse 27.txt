 27. ]  But (opposed to ἀλαλήτοις ‘though unutterable by us’)  He who searcheth the hearts (God)  knoweth what is the mind (  intent , or  bent , as hidden in those sighs)  of the Spirit. A difficulty presents itself in the rendering of the next clause. If ὅτι be  causal ,  because He (the Spirit)  pleads for the saints according to the will of God , it would seem that οἶδεν must bear the meaning ‘  approves ,’ otherwise the connexion will not be apparent; and so Calv. and Rückert have rendered it. Hence Grot., Reiche, Meyer, Fritz. render ὅτι , ‘  that ,’ and construe, ‘  knows what is the mind of the Spirit,’ that He pleads with God (so Reiche and Fritz., and Winer, edn. 6, § 49. d, for κατὰ θ .)  for the saints : justifying the repetition of θεόν , implied before, by 1 John 4:8 , ὁ μὴ ἀγαπῶν οὐκ ἔγνω τὸν θεόν , ὅτι ὁ θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν . But I must confess that the other rendering seems to me better to suit the context: and I do not see that the ordinary meaning of οἶδεν need be changed. The assurance which we have that God the Heart-Searcher interprets the inarticulate sighings of the Spirit in us, is, not strictly speaking, His Omniscience, but  the fact that the very Spirit who thus pleads, does it κατὰ θεόν , in pursuance of the divine purposes and in conformity with God’s good pleasure. So that, as its place before the verb would suggest, κατὰ θεόν is emphatic, and furnishes the reason of the οἶδεν . A minor objection against the explicative ὅτι is, that we have οἴδαμεν ὅτι immediately following.
	All these pleadings of the Spirit are heard and answered, even when  inarticulately uttered ; we may extend the same comforting assurance to the  imperfect and mistaken verbal utterances of our prayers, which are not themselves answered to our hurt, but the answer is given to the voice of the Spirit which speaks through them, which we  would express, but  cannot . Compare 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 , for an instance in the Apostle’s own case.
