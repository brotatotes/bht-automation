<b> 28.</b>] Having given an example in<i> prayer</i>, how the Spirit<i> helps our weakness</i>, and out of our ignorance and discouragement brings from God an answer of peace, he now extends this to<i> all things</i>—all circumstances by which the Christian finds himself surrounded. These may seem calculated to dash down hope, and surpass patience; but<i> we know better concerning them</i>.<b> Moreover</b> (or,<b> but</b>; and if so, it seems most naturally to apply to ver. 22, the groaning and travailing of all creation)<b> we know</b> (as a point of the assurance of faith)<b> that, to those who love God</b> (a stronger designation than any yet used for believers),<b> all things</b> (every event of life, but especially, as the context requires, those which are adverse. To include, with Augustine, the<i> sins</i> of believers in this<b> all things</b>, as making them “humbler and wiser,” is manifestly to introduce an element which did not enter into the Apostle’s consideration; for he is here already viewing the believer as<i> justified by faith, dwelt in by the Spirit, dead</i> to sin)<b> work together</b> (in the sense of all things<i> co-operating one with another</i>)<b> for</b> (towards, to bring about)<b> good</b> (their eternal welfare;—the fulfilment of the purpose of the “love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord,” ver. 39),—<b>to those who are called</b> (not only<i> invited</i>, but effectually called——see below)<b> according to</b> [<b>His</b>] (the possessive pronoun is not expressed in the original)<b> purpose</b>.—In this further description the Apostle designates the believers as not merely<i> loving God</i>, but being<i> beloved by God</i>. The<i> divine side</i> of their security from harm is brought out, as combining with and ensuring the other. They are sure that all things work for their good, not only because<i> they love Him who worketh all things</i>, but also because<i> He who worketh all things hath loved and chosen them</i>, and carried them through the successive steps of their spiritual life. The<i> calling</i> here and elsewhere spoken of by the Apostle (comp. especially ch. ix. 11) is the working, in men, of “the everlasting purpose of God whereby before the foundations of the world were laid, He hath decreed by His counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom He hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation.” Art. X. of the Church of England. To specify the various ways in which this calling has been understood, would far exceed the limits of a general commentary. It may suffice to say, that on the one hand, Scripture bears constant testimony to the fact that all believers are chosen and called by God,—their whole spiritual life in its origin, progress, and completion, being<i> from Him</i>:—while on the other hand its testimony is no less precise that He willeth all to be saved, and that none shall perish except by<i> wilful rejection</i> of the truth. So that, on the one side, GOD’ S SOVEREIGNTY,—on the other, MAN’ S FREE WILL,—is plainly declared to us.<i> To receive, believe, and act on both these, is our duty, and our wisdom</i>. They belong, as truths, no less to<i> natural</i> than to revealed religion: and every one who believes in a God must acknowledge both. But all attempts to<i> bridge over the gulf between the two</i> are<i> futile</i>, in the present imperfect condition of man. The very reasonings used for this purpose are clothed in language framed on the analogies of this lower world, and wholly inadequate to describe God regarded as He is in Himself. Hence arises confusion, misapprehension of God, and unbelief. I have therefore simply, in this commentary, endeavoured to enter into the full meaning of the sacred text, whenever one or other of these great truths is brought forward; not explaining either of them away on account of possible difficulties arising from the recognition of the other, but recognizing as fully the<i> elective and predestinating decree of God</i>, where it is treated of, as I have done, in other places,<i> the free will of man</i>. If there be an inconsistency in this course, it is at least one in which the nature of things, the conditions of human thought, and Scripture itself, participate, and from which no Commentator that I have seen, however anxious to avoid it by extreme views one way or the other, has been able to escape.
