<b> 3.] For</b> (explanation of ver. 2, shewing the method of this liberation)<b> what the law could not do</b> (i. e. that which was not in the power of the law. The expression in the original may mean either, ‘<i>that part of the law which was impossible,</i>’— ‘could not be obeyed,’—or, ‘<i>the inability of the law</i>?—or, ‘<i>that which was unable to be done by the law.</i>’ Of these the first is out of the question; the second would give the first clause the meaning, ‘<i>that wherein the inability of the law shewed itself,</i>’ viz. its powerlessness through the flesh. The third yields by far the best meaning: see below on the words “<i>through the flesh</i>”), in that (i. e. because: not ‘<i>wherein</i>,’ as in ch. ii. 1, but ‘<i>in that:</i>’ this clause gives a reason and explanation of the inability)<b> it was weak</b> (the Apostle keeps in mind his defence of the holiness of the law undertaken in ch. vii., and as Chrysostom observes, “seems indeed to be depreciating the law, but if we pay accurate attention is really giving it the highest praise: for he does not say the<i> iniquity</i> of the law, but its<i> inability</i>: and again, ‘in that it<i> was weak</i>,’ not ‘in that it wronged us,’ or, ‘in that it conspired against us’”)<b> through the flesh</b> (i. e. in<i> having to act</i> through the flesh; not, ‘on account of the flesh,’ i.e. of the hostility, or weakness, of the flesh. The flesh was the<i> medium through which</i> the law,—being a<i> law of carnal commandment</i>, Heb. vii. 16,—<i>wrought</i>, and<i> they that are in the flesh,</i> the<i> objects on which</i>),<b> God</b> (did)<b> sending his own Son</b> (the stress is on<b> His own</b>, and the word is pregnant with meaning:—His<i> own</i>, and therefore like Himself, holy and<i> sinless</i>. This implication should be borne in mind, as the suppressed antithesis to the word sin, three times repeated afterwards. Another antithesis may be implied:<b> His own</b>, and therefore<i> spiritual</i>, not acting merely through the flesh, though in its likeness, but bringing a higher spiritual life into the manhood)<b> in the likeness of the flesh of sin</b> (the flesh,<i> whose attribute and character was</i> SIN. The expression is not equivalent to<i> “sinful flesh,”</i> as in A.V., but implies far more:—not merely the contamination by, but the belonging to, and being possessed by, sin.—De Wette observes, ‘The words “<i>in the likeness of the flesh of sin</i>,” appear almost to border on Docetism (the heresy which held the Humanity of our Lord to be only apparent, not real); but in reality contain a perfectly true and consistent sentiment.’ “<i>The flesh of sin</i>” is<i> flesh</i> (human nature, John i. 14; 1 John iv. 2; Heb. ii. 14)<i> possessed with sin</i>: the Apostle could not then have said, “sending His Son<i> in</i> the flesh of sin,” without making Christ<i> partaker of sin</i>: nor could he have said merely “<i>in the flesh</i>,” for then the bond between the Manhood of Jesus, and sin, would have been wanting: he says then,<b> in the likeness of the flesh of sin</b>,—meaning by that, He had a nature<i> like</i><i> sinful human nature</i>, but had not Himself<i> a sinful nature</i>,—comp. Heb. iv. 15: “<i>For we have not an High Priest which cannot sympathize with our infirmities, but one who was tempted in all things, like as we are, apart from sin</i>.” The<i> likeness</i> must be referred not only to the word “<i>flesh</i>,” but also to the epithet “<i>of sin</i>:”—it did not however consist in this, that He took our sins (literally) on Himself and became Himself sinful, which would not amount to likeness of<i> nature</i>,—but in this, that He was<i> able to be tempted</i>, i.e. subjected to sensuous incitements, e.g. of<i> pain</i>, which in other men break out into sin, but in Him did not. See Phil. ii. 7, and note.— “<i>Flesh</i>” is not equivalent to “<i>body</i>,” but as in John i. 14, the<i> material</i>, of which man is in the body compounded),—<b>and for</b> (on account of)<b> sin</b> (to be joined with “<i>sending</i>,” not “<i>condemned</i>:” least of all may we understand it as Luther, “<i>and condemned sin in the flesh by means of sin</i>.” The<i> ‘for</i>,’ or ‘<i>on account of</i>’ sin, is at present<i> indefinite</i>, and not to be restricted to Christ’s death as a sin-offering, which is not just now the subject. ‘On account of sin’ then, is equivalent to “<i>to put away sin</i>,” as Heb. x. 6, 18),<b> condemned sin in the flesh</b> (not ‘the sin which was in the flesh,’ which is against the context, in which “<i>sin</i>” is throughout an<i> absolute principle</i>.<br><br> In<b> condemned</b> we have an allusion to “<i>condemnation</i>,” ver. 1. Hence it has been taken to mean that God condemned,<i> punished</i>, sin in the flesh by the death of Christ. But that can hardly be the meaning here, for several reasons. 1. The Apostle is not speaking of the removal of the<i> guilt</i>, but of the<i> practice</i> of sin, and of the real fulfilment of the law in those who are in Christ. It is this which even in ver. 1 is before him, grounding as he does the fact of<i> no condemnation</i> on the serving the law of God, ch. vii. 25; on the<i> new and sanctifying power of the Spirit by Christ</i>, in spite of<i> the continued subjection of the flesh to the law of sin</i>. 2. The context shews that the weakness of the law was, its having no<i> sanctifying</i> power;—it could arouse sin, but it could not condemn and cast it out. This indeed is the burden of ch. vii. The absence of<i> justifying</i> power in the law has already been dealt with. 3. The following verse clearly makes the fulfilling the<i> righteous demand</i> of the law no matter of mere imputation, but of<i> walking after the Spirit</i>.—We must then look for the meaning of the word<b> condemned</b> in the<i> effects</i> and accompaniments of condemnation,—<i>victory over</i>, and<i> casting out</i><i> of</i> sin. See, for example, John xii. 31, where “the judgment of this world” is explained by<i> the ruler of this world shall be cast out</i>, and also John xvi. 11. I have dwelt at length on this question, as being very important to the right apprehension of the whole chapter, in this part of which<i> not the justification</i>, but the<i> sanctification</i>, of Christians is the leading subject. It is a strong confirmation of the above view, that God’s condemnation of sin in the flesh by Christ is stated in ver. 3 as the ground of (ver. 2) my being freed from<i> the law of sin and death</i>: because, viz.<i> Christ’s victory over sin is mine, by my union with Him and participation in His Spirit</i>.<b> in the flesh</b> does not mean ‘<i>in His flesh</i>,’ or ‘<i>by means of his flesh</i>;’ but ‘in<i> the flesh</i>, which Christ and ourselves haye in common):
