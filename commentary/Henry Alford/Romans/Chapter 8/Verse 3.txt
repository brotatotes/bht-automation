<b> 3.] For</b> (explanation of ver. 2, shewing the method of this liberation)<b> what the law could not do</b> (i. e. that which was not in the power of the law. The expression in the original may mean either, ‘<i>that part of the law which was impossible,</i>’— ‘could not be obeyed,’—or, ‘<i>the inability of the law</i>?—or, ‘<i>that which was unable to be done by the law.</i>’ Of these the first is out of the question; the second would give the first clause the meaning, ‘<i>that wherein the inability of the law shewed itself,</i>’ viz. its powerlessness through the flesh. The third yields by far the best meaning: see below on the words “<i>through the flesh</i>”), in that (i. e. because: not ‘<i>wherein</i>,’ as in ch. ii. 1, but ‘<i>in that:</i>’ this clause gives a reason and explanation of the inability)<b> it was weak</b> (the Apostle keeps in mind his defence of the holiness of the law undertaken in ch. vii., and as Chrysostom observes, “seems indeed to be depreciating the law, but if we pay accurate attention is really giving it the highest praise: for he does not say the<i> iniquity</i> of the law, but its<i> inability</i>: and again, ‘in that it<i> was weak</i>,’ not ‘in that it wronged us,’ or, ‘in that it conspired against us’”)<b> through the flesh</b> (i. e. in<i> having to act</i> through the flesh; not, ‘on account of the flesh,’ i.e. of the hostility, or weakness, of the flesh.

This implication should be borne in mind, as the suppressed antithesis to the word sin, three times repeated afterwards. Another antithesis may be implied:<b> His own</b>, and therefore<i> spiritual</i>, not acting merely through the flesh, though in its likeness, but bringing a higher spiritual life into the manhood)<b> in the likeness of the flesh of sin</b> (the flesh,<i> whose attribute and character was</i> SIN. The expression is not equivalent to<i> “sinful flesh,”</i> as in A.V., but implies far more:—not merely the contamination by, but the belonging to, and being possessed by, sin.—De Wette observes, ‘The words “<i>in the likeness of the flesh of sin</i>,” appear almost to border on Docetism (the heresy which held the Humanity of our Lord to be only apparent, not real); but in reality contain a perfectly true and consistent sentiment.’ “<i>The flesh of sin</i>” is<i> flesh</i> (human nature, John i. 14; 1 John iv. 2; Heb. ii. 14)<i> possessed with sin</i>: the Apostle could not then have said, “sending His Son<i> in</i> the flesh of sin,” without making Christ<i> partaker of sin</i>: nor could he have said merely “<i>in the flesh</i>,” for then the bond between the Manhood of Jesus, and sin, would have been wanting: he says then,<b> in the likeness of the flesh of sin</b>,—meaning by that, He had a nature<i> like</i>
