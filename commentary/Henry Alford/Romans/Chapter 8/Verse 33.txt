Many (Aug [62] , Ambr [63] , Reiche, Köllner, Olsh., Meyer, De Wette, and Griesb., Knapp, Lachmann) follow, in Romans 8:33-34 , the undoubted form of Romans 8:35 , and place an interrogation after each clause, as in the text; while Luther, Beza, Grot., Wolf, Tholuck, al., make θεὸς ὁ δικ . and χριστὸς ὁ ἀποθ . κ . τ . λ . the  reply to and  rejection of the questions preceding them.

(  Is it )  Christ who died, yea who rather is also risen, who also is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us ? “All the great points of our redemption are ranged together, from the death of Christ to His still enduring intercession, as reasons for negativing the question above.” De W.
