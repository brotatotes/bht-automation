<b> 33.</b>] The punctuation of these verses is disputed. Many follow, in verses 33, 34, the undoubted form of ver. 35, and place an interrogation after each clause, as in the text; while others make “<i>God that justifieth</i>,” and “<i>Christ that dieth</i>, &c.,” the<i> reply to</i> and<i> rejection of</i> the questions preceding them. The former method is preferable, as preserving the form of ver. 35, and involving no harshness of construction, which the other does: see my Greek Testament.<b> Who shall lay any charge against the elect of God? Shall God who justifies them</b> (Chrysostom strikingly says, “He saith not, ‘God who remitteth sins,’ but which is much more, ‘God who justifieth.” For when the vote of the judge himself acquits, and of Such a Judge, of what weight is the accuser?”)<b>?</b><b> Who is he that condemns them?</b> [<b>Is it</b>]<b> Christ who died, yea, who is also risen again, who is also at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us?</b> “All the great points of our redemption are ranged together, from the death of Christ to His still enduring intercession, as reasons for negativing the question above.” De Wette.
