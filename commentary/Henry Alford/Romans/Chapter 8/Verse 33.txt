<p><strong> 33</strong> .] The punctuation of these verses is disputed. Many (Aug [62] , Ambr [63] , Reiche, Köllner, Olsh., Meyer, De Wette, and Griesb., Knapp, Lachmann) follow, in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33-34">Romans 8:33-34</span> , the undoubted form of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:35">Romans 8:35</span> , and place an interrogation after each clause, as in the text; while Luther, Beza, Grot., Wolf, Tholuck, al., make θεὸς ὁ δικ . and χριστὸς ὁ ἀποθ . κ . τ . λ . the <em> reply to</em> and <em> rejection of</em> the questions preceding them. The former method is preferable, as preserving the form of <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:35">Romans 8:35</span> , and involving no harshness of construction, which the other does, in the case of χριστός followed by the two participles.

<p><strong> Who shall lay</strong> ( τι ) <strong> any charge against the elect of God</strong> ( ἐγκαλέω usually with a dat. see reff.)? <strong> Shall God</strong> ( ἐγκαλέσει ), <strong> who justifies them</strong> (Chrys. strikingly says, οὐκ εἶπε “ θεὸς ὁ ἀφεὶς ἁμαρτήματα ,” ἀλλ ʼ ὃ πολλῷ μεῖζον ἦν <strong> θεὸς ὁ δικαιῶν</strong> <strong> .</strong> ὅταν γὰρ ἡ τοῦ δικαστοῦ ψῆφος δίκαιον ἀποφήνῃ , καὶ δικαστοῦ τοιούτου , τίνος ἄξιος ὁ κατηγορῶν ; Hom. xv. p. 597)? <strong> Who is he that condemns them</strong> (the pres. part. as expressing the official employment, ‘is their accuser,’ is better than the fut., as corresponding more closely with δικαιῶν )? ( <strong> Is it</strong> ) <strong> Christ who died, yea who rather is also risen, who also is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us</strong> ? “All the great points of our redemption are ranged together, from the death of Christ to His still enduring intercession, as reasons for negativing the question above.” De W.</p>
