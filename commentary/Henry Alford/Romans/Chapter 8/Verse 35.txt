 35 .]  Who (i.e.  what : but masc. for uniformity with Rom 8:33-34 )  shall separate us from the love of Christ? Is this (1)  our love to Christ , or (2)  Christ’s love to us , or (3)  our sense of Christ’s love to us ? The first of these is held by Origen, Chrys., Theodoret, Ambr [64] , Erasm., al. But the difficulty of it lies in consistently interpreting Romans 8:37 , where not our  endurance in love to Him , but our  victory by means of His love to us , is alleged. And besides, it militates against the conclusion in Romans 8:39 , which ought certainly to respond to this question. The third meaning is defended by Calvin. But the second, as maintained by Beza, Grot., Est., al., Thol., Reiche, Meyer, De Wette, appears to me the only tenable sense of the words. For, having shewn that God’s great love to us is such that none can accuse nor harm us, the Apostle now  asserts the permanence of that love under all adverse circumstances that none such can affect it, nay more, that it is by that love that we are enablea to obtain the victory over all such adversities. And finally he expresses his persuasion that no created thing shall ever separate us from that love, i.e. shall ever be able to pluck us out of the Father’s hand.
