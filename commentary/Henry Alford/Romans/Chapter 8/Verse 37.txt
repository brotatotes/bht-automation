<b> 37.</b>]<b> Nay</b> (negation of the question preceding),<b> in all these things we are more than conquerors</b> (or, and perhaps better,<b> we are far the conquerors</b>)<b> through Him who loved us</b> (i. e. so far from all these things separating us from His love, that very love has given us a glorious victory over them).—It is doubted whether ‘<i>He who loved us</i>’ be the Father, or our Lord Jesus Christ. This is, I think, decided by “to Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood,” Rey. i. 5. The use of such an expression as a title of our Lord in a doxology, makes it very probable that<i> where unexplained</i>, as here, it would also designate Him.
