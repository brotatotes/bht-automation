 37. ]  But (negation of the question θλῖψις .… μάχαιρα ;)  in all these things we are far the conquerors (hardly, ‘  more than conquerors :’ the ὑπέρ intensifies the degree of νικᾷν , as in ὑπερπερισσεύειν and the like, but does not express a superiority over νικᾷν )  through Him who loved us (i.e. so far from all these things separating us from His love, that very love has given us a glorious victory over them).
	The reading διὰ τὸν ἀγαπήσαντα ἡμᾶς would amount to the same in meaning: ‘  on account of Him who loved   us ’ implying, as in Romans 8:11 ; Romans 8:20 , that He is the efficient cause of the result.
	It is doubted whether ‘  He who loved us ’ be the Father, or our Lord Jesus Christ. This is, I think, decided by τῷ ἀγαπῶντι ἡμᾶς καὶ λούσαντι ἡμᾶς .… ἐν τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ , Revelation 1:5 . The use of such an expression as a title of our Lord in a doxology, makes it very probable that  where unexplained , as here, it would also designate Him.
