<p><strong> 37.</strong> ] <strong> But</strong> (negation of the question θλῖψις .… μάχαιρα ;) <strong> in all these things we are far the conquerors</strong> (hardly, ‘ <em> more than conquerors</em> :’ the ὑπέρ intensifies the degree of νικᾷν , as in ὑπερπερισσεύειν and the like, but does not express a superiority over νικᾷν ) <strong> through Him who loved us</strong> (i.e. so far from all these things separating us from His love, that very love has given us a glorious victory over them).

<p>The reading διὰ τὸν ἀγαπήσαντα ἡμᾶς would amount to the same in meaning: ‘ <em> on account of Him who loved </em> <strong><em> us</em></strong> ’ implying, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:20">Romans 8:20</span> , that He is the efficient cause of the result.

<p>It is doubted whether ‘ <em> He who loved us</em> ’ be the Father, or our Lord Jesus Christ. This is, I think, decided by τῷ ἀγαπῶντι ἡμᾶς καὶ λούσαντι ἡμᾶς .… ἐν τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span> . The use of such an expression as a title of our Lord in a doxology, makes it very probable that <em> where unexplained</em> , as here, it would also designate Him.</p>
