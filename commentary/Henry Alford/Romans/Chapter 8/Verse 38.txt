Col. ii. 15; Eph. vi. 12; here,<i> generally</i>.—<b>Angels</b>, absolutely, seems never to be used of<i> bad</i> angels: if it here means good angels, there is no objection to the rhetorical supposition that they might attempt this separation, any more than to that of<i> an angel from heaven preaching another gospel</i>, Gal. i. 8),<b> nor things present, nor things to come</b> (no vicissitudes of<i> time</i>),<b> nor powers</b> (some confusion has evidently crept into the arrangement. I follow the very strong consent of the ancient MSS.),<b> nor height, nor depth</b> (no extremes of<i> space</i>),<b> nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord</b> (here plainly enough<i> God’s love to us in Christ</i>,—to us, as we are in Christ, to us, manifested in and by Christ).
