Ephr [65] Syr. reads, οὔτ . ἀρχαὶ οὔτ . ἐξουσίαι οὔτ . ἐνεστ . οὔτ . μέλλ . οὔτ . δυνάμεις οὔτ . ἄγγελοι ; Basil, οὔτε ἄγγ . οὔτ . ἀρχ . οὔτ . ἐξους . οὔτ . δυνάμεις οὔτ . ἐνεστ . οὔτ . μέλλ I follow, with Griesb., Lachm., Tischdf., the very strong consent of the ancient MSS.),  nor height nor depth (no extremes of  space ),  nor any other created thing ( κτίσις cannot here be the whole creation, as Chrys., ὃ λέγει τοιοῦτόν ἐστιν · εἰ καὶ ἄλλη τοσαύτη κτίσις ἦν ὅση ἡ ὁρωμένη , ὅση ἡ νοητή , οὐδὲν ἄν με τῆς ἀγάπης ἐκείνης ἀπέστησε , but any  creature , such as are all the things named)  shall be able to sever us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord (here plainly enough  God’s love to us in Christ , to us, as we are in Christ, to us, manifested in and by Christ).
