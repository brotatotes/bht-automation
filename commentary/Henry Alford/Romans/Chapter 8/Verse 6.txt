<b> 6.</b>]<b> For</b> (the spiritual man cannot seek the things of the flesh, because)<b> the mind</b> (<i>thoughts</i>,<i> cares</i>, and<i> aims</i>, as above)<b> of the flesh is</b> (ends in,—<i>amounts to, being worked out</i>)<b> death</b> (not merely<i> physical</i>, nor mere<i> unhappiness</i>, as sometimes in ch. vii., but as in ver. 2, in the largest sense, extending to eternity); but<b> the mind</b> (<i>thoughts, cares, and aims</i>)<b> of the Spirit is</b> (see above)<b> life and peace</b> (in the largest sense, as above). In this argument there is a suppressed premiss, to be supplied from ver. 2; viz. ‘The Spirit is the Spirit of<i> life</i>’ Hence it follows that the spiritual man cannot mind the things of the flesh, because such mind is<i> death</i>. The addition<i> and peace</i> seems to be made to enhance the unlikelihood of such a minding,—the peace of the Spirit being a blessed contrast to the tumult of the fleshly lusts, even in this life.
