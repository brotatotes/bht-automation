 6. ]  For (the spiritual man cannot seek the things of the flesh, because)  the mind (  thoughts, cares , and  aims as above)  of the flesh is (ends in the copula (=), as when it joins the two signs of an algebraic operation; ‘  amounts to, being worked out ’)  death (not merely  physical , nor mere  unhappiness , as sometimes in ch. 7, but as in Romans 8:2 , in the largest sense, extending to eternity);  but the mind (  thoughts, cares, and aims )  of the Spirit, is (see above)  life and peace (in the largest sense, as above). In this argument there is a suppressed premiss, to be supplied from Romans 8:2 ; viz. ‘The Spirit is the Spirit of  life .’ Hence it follows that the spiritual man cannot mind the things of the flesh, because such mind is  death . The addition καὶ εἰρήνη seems to be made to enhance the unlikelihood of such a minding, the peace of the Spirit being a blessed contrast to the tumult of the fleshly lusts, even in this life.
