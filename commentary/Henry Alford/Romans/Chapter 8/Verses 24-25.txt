 24, 25. ]  For (confirmation of the last assertion, proving  hope to be our present state of salvation)  in hope were we (not, ‘  are we ,’ nor ‘  have we been ’)  saved : i.e. our first apprehension of, and appropriation to ourselves of, salvation which is by faith in Christ, was effected in the condition of  hope : which hope (Thol.) is in fact  faith in its prospective attitude , that faith which is ὑπόστασις ἐλπιζομένων , Hebrews 11:1 . The dat. ἐλπίδι is not a dat. of reference, ‘  according to hope ,’ but of the form or condition.  Now hope that is seen (the object or fulfilment of which is present and palpable)  is not hope: for that which any one sees, why does he [  also (or,  at all )]  hope for? If καί is to stand in the text, it conveys, after an interrogative word, a sense of the utter  superfluity of the thing questioned about, as being irrelevant, and out of the question. ‘Qui interrogat τί χρὴ προσδοκᾷν ; exspectat aliquid, sed dubius est quid eveniat. Qui interrogat τί χρὴ καὶ προσδοκᾷν ; desperat de salute, nec eam usquam exspectari posse existimat.’ Bremi in Demosth. Phil. i. 46, cited in Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 137.
