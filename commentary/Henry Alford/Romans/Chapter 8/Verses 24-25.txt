<p><strong> 24, 25.</strong> ] <strong> For</strong> (confirmation of the last assertion, proving <em> hope to be</em> our present state of salvation) <strong> in hope were we</strong> (not, ‘ <em> are we</em> ,’ nor ‘ <em> have we been</em> ’) <strong> saved</strong> : i.e. our first apprehension of, and appropriation to ourselves of, salvation which is by faith in Christ, was effected in the condition of <em> hope</em> : which hope (Thol.) is in fact <em> faith in its prospective attitude</em> , that faith which is ὑπόστασις ἐλπιζομένων , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span> . The dat. ἐλπίδι is not a dat. of reference, ‘ <em> according to hope</em> ,’ but of the form or condition. <strong> Now hope that is seen</strong> (the object or fulfilment of which is present and palpable) <strong> is not hope: for that which any one sees, why does he</strong> [ <strong> also</strong> (or, <strong> at all</strong> )] <strong> hope for?</strong> If καί is to stand in the text, it conveys, after an interrogative word, a sense of the utter <em> superfluity</em> of the thing questioned about, as being irrelevant, and out of the question. ‘Qui interrogat τί χρὴ προσδοκᾷν ; exspectat aliquid, sed dubius est quid eveniat. Qui interrogat τί χρὴ καὶ προσδοκᾷν ; desperat de salute, nec eam usquam exspectari posse existimat.’ Bremi in Demosth. Phil. i. 46, cited in Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 137.</p>
