<p><strong> 29, 30</strong> .] The Apostle now goes backward from κλητοῖς , to explain <em> how this</em> CALLING <em> came about</em> . It sprung from God’s <em> fore-knowledge</em> , co-ordinate with His <em> fore-determination</em> of certain persons (to be) conformed to the image of His Son, that Christ might be exalted as the Head of the great Family of God. These persons, thus foreknown and predetermined, He, in the course of His Providence actually, but in His eternal decree implicitly, called, bringing them through justification to glory; and all this is spoken of as <em> past</em> , because <em> to Him who sees the end from the beginning, past, present, and future</em> ARE NOT, but ALL IS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN DETERMINED.

<p><strong> Because whom He foreknew</strong> (but in what sense? This has been much disputed: the Pelagian view, ‘ <em> eos quos prœsciverat credituros</em> ,’ is taken by Orig [59] , Chrys., Œc [60] , Theophyl., Augustine (prop. 55, in Ep. ad Rom. vol. iii. p. 2076), Ambr [61] , Erasm. in paraphrase, Calov., Reiche, Meyer, Neander, and others; the sense of <em> fore-loved</em> , by Erasm. in commentary, Grotius, Estius, the Schmidts, &amp;c.: that of <em> fore-decreed</em> , by Thol. edn. 1, and Stuart, which however Thol. in subsequent editions suspects to be ungrammatical without some infinitive following, and prefers a sense combining foreknowledge and recognition-as-His: that of <em> elected, adopted as His sons</em> , by Calvin, ‘Dei autem præcognitio, cujus hic Paulus meminit, non nuda est præscientia, ut stulte fingunt quidam imperiti, sed adoptio qua filios suos ab improbis semper discrevit,’ Rückert, De Wette, al. That this latter is <em> implied</em> , is certain: but I prefer taking the word in the ordinary sense of <strong> foreknew</strong> , especially as it is guarded from being a ‘nuda præscientia’ by what follows: see below and Gal 4:9 ), <strong> He also fore-ordained</strong> (His foreknowledge was not a mere <em> being previously aware</em> how a series of events would happen: but was co-ordinate with, and inseparable from, His having <em> pre-ordained</em> all things) <strong> conformed</strong> (i.e. to be conformed) <strong> to the image of His Son</strong> (the dat. and gen. are both found after words like σύμμορφος ; compare σύμφυτος , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span> .

<p>The <em> image</em> of Christ here spoken of is not His moral purity, nor His sufferings, but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:49">1 Corinthians 15:49</span> , that entire form, of <em> glorification in body</em> and <em> sanctification in spirit</em> , of which Christ is the perfect pattern, and all His people shall be partakers. To accomplish this transformation in us is the end, <em> as regards us</em> , of our election by God; not merely to rescue us from wrath.

This is the further end of our election, <em> as regards Christ</em> : His glorification in us, as our elder Brother and Head):</p>
