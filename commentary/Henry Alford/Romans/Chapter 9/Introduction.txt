<p>CHAP. <strong> 9 11</strong> ] The Gospel being now established, in its fulness and freeness, as the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, a question naturally arises, not unaccompanied with painful difficulty, respecting the exclusion of that people, as a people, to whom God’s ancient promises were made. With this national rejection of Israel the Apostle now deals: first ( Rom 9:1-5 ) <em> expressing his deep sympathy with his own people</em> : then ( Rom 9:6-29 ) <em> justifying Good, Who has not</em> ( Rom 9:6-13 ) <em> broken His promise, but from the first chose a</em> portion <em> only of Abraham’s seed, and that</em> ( Rom 9:14-29 ) <em> by His undoubted elective right, not to be murmured at nor disputed by us His creatures: according to which election a remnant shall now also be saved</em> . Then, as to the rejection of so large a portion of Israel, <em> their own self-righteousness</em> ( Rom 9:30-33 ) <em> has been the cause of it, and</em> ( Rom 10:1-12 ) <em> their ignorance of God’s righteousness, notwithstanding that</em> ( Rom 9:13-21 ) <em> their Scriptures plainly declared to them the nature of the Gospel, and its results with regard to themselves and the Gentiles, with which declarations Paul’s preaching was in perfect accordance. Has God then cast off his people</em> ( Rom 11:1-10 )? <em> No for a remnant shall be saved according to the election of grace, but the rest hardened, not however for the purpose of their destruction, but</em> ( Rom 11:11-24 ) <em> of mercy to the Gentiles: which purpose of mercy being fulfilled, Israel shall be brought in again to its proper place of blessing</em> ( Rom 11:25-32 ). He concludes the whole with <em> a humble admiration of the unsearchable depth of God’s ways, and the riches of His Wisdom</em> ( Rom 11:33-36 ).

<p>In no part of the Epistles of Paul is it more requisite than in this portion, to bear in mind his habit of INSULATING <em> the one view of the subject under consideration, with which he is at the time dealing</em> . The <em> divine side</em> of the history of Israel and the world is in the greater part of this portion thus <em> insulated</em> : the facts of the divine dealings and the divine decrees insisted on, and the <em> mundane</em> or <em> human side</em> of that history kept for the most part out of sight, and only so much shewn, as to make it manifest that the Jews, on their part, failed of attaining God’s righteousness, and so lost their share in the Gospel.
	</p>
<p>It must also be remembered, that, whatever inferences, with regard to God’s disposal of <em> individuals</em> , may justly lie from the Apostle’s arguments, the assertions here made by him are universally spoken with a <em> national</em> reference. Of the eternal salvation or rejection of any individual Jew there is here no question: and however logically true of any individual the same conclusion may be shewn to be, we know as matter of fact, that in such cases <em> not the divine, but the human side</em> , is that ever held up by the Apostle the universality of free grace for all the riches of God’s mercy to all who call on Him, and consequent exhortations to all, to look to Him and be saved.
	</p>
<p>De Wette has well shewn, against Reiche and others, that the apparent inconsistencies of the Apostle, at one time speaking of absolute decrees of God, and at another of culpability in man, at one time of the election of some, at another of a hope of the conversion of all, resolve themselves into the necessary conditions of thought under which we all are placed, being compelled to acknowledge the divine Sovereignty on the one hand, and human free will on the other, and alternately appearing to lose sight of one of these, as often as for the time we confine our view to the other.
