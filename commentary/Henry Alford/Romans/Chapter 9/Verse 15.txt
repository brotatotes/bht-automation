<p><strong> 15.</strong> ] <strong> for He saith to Moses, “I will have mercy on whomsoever I have meroy, and [I] will have compassion on whomsoever I have compassion</strong> .” The citation is from the LXX, who insert the indefinite ἄν , the Heb. being … חַנֹּתִי אֶת־אֲשֶׁר אָחֹן ; the meaning apparently being, ‘whenever I have mercy on any, it shall be <em> pure mercy</em> , no human desert contributing;’ which agrees better with the next verse than the ordinary rendering, which lays the stress on the ὃν ἄν ; and is not inconsistent with <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:18">Romans 9:18</span> , ὃν θέλει , ἐλεᾷ : because if God’s mercy be <em> pure mercy</em> without any desert on man’s part, it necessarily follows that he has mercy on whom He will, His will being the only assignable cause of the selection.</p>
