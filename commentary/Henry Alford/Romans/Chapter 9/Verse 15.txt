<b> 15.</b>]<b> For He saith to Moses, “I will have mercy on whomsoever I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomsoever</b><b> I have compassion</b>” (the meaning apparently is, ‘whenever I have mercy on any, it shall be<i> pure mercy</i>, no human desert contributing; which agrees better with the next verse than the ordinary rendering, which lays the stress on the “<i>whomsoever</i>;” and is not inconsistent with ver. 18, “<i>he hath mercy on whom he will</i>;” because if God’s mercy be pure mercy without any desert on man’s part, it necessarily follows that He has mercy on whom He will, His will being the only assignable cause of the selection).
