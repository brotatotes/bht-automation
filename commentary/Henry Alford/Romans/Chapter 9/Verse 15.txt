 15. ]  for He saith to Moses, “I will have mercy on whomsoever I have meroy, and [I] will have compassion on whomsoever I have compassion .” The citation is from the LXX, who insert the indefinite ἄν , the Heb. being … חַנֹּתִי אֶת־אֲשֶׁר אָחֹן ; the meaning apparently being, ‘whenever I have mercy on any, it shall be  pure mercy , no human desert contributing;’ which agrees better with the next verse than the ordinary rendering, which lays the stress on the ὃν ἄν ; and is not inconsistent with Romans 9:18 , ὃν θέλει , ἐλεᾷ : because if God’s mercy be  pure mercy without any desert on man’s part, it necessarily follows that he has mercy on whom He will, His will being the only assignable cause of the selection.
