<b> 16.</b>]<b> So then</b> (inference from the citation)<b> it is not of</b> (God’s mercy ‘does not belong to,’— ‘is not in the power of’)<b> him that willeth</b> (any man willing it),<b> nor yet of him that runneth</b> (any man contending for it, see reff. and Phil. iii. 14. There hardly can be any allusion to Abraham’s wish for Ishmael, Gen. xvii. 18, and Esau’s running to hunt for venison, as some think),<b> but of God that hath mercy.</b>—I must pause again here to remind the student, that I purposely do not enter on the disquisitions so abundant, in some commentaries on this part of Scripture, by which it is endeavoured to reconcile the sovereign election of God with our free will.<i> We shall find that free will asserted strongly enough for all edifying purposes by this Apostle, when the time comes.</i> At present, he is employed wholly in asserting the divine Sovereignty, the glorious vision of which it ill becomes us to distract by continual downward looks on this earth. I must also protest against all endeavours to make it appear, that no inference lies from this passage as to the<i> salvation of individuals</i>. It is most true (see remarks at the beginning of this chapter) that<i> the immediate subject is the national rejection of the Jews</i>: but we must consent to hold our reason in abeyance, if we do not recognize the inference, that the sovereign power and free election here proved to belong to God extend to<i> every exercise</i> of His mercy—whether temporal or spiritual-—whether in Providence or in Grace—whether national or individual. It is in parts of Scripture like this, that we must be especially careful<i> not to fall short of what is written</i>: not to allow of any compromise of the plain and awful words of God’s Spirit for the sake of a caution which He Himself does not teach us.
