<p><strong> 17</strong> .] The same great truth shewn on its <em> darker side</em> : not only as regards God’s <em> mercy</em> , but His <em> wrath</em> also.
	</p>
<p><strong> For</strong> (confirmation of the <em> universal</em> truth of the last inference) <strong> the Scripture</strong> (identified with God, its Author: the case, as Thol. remarks, is different when merely something <em> contained</em> in Scripture is introduced by ἡ γραφὴ λέγει : there ἡ γρ . is merely personified. The justice of Thol.’s remark will be apparent, if we reflect that this expression could not be used of the <em> mere ordinary words of any man</em> in the historical Scriptures, Ahab, or Hezekiah, but only where <em> the text itself</em> speaks, or where <em> God spoke</em> , or, as here, <em> some man under inspiration of God)</em> <strong> saith to Pharaoh, For this very purpose</strong> ( ὅτι recitantis; the LXX have καὶ ἕνεκεν τούτου ) <strong> did I raise thee up</strong> (LXX διετηρήθης , ‘ <em> thou wert preserved to this day</em> :’ Heb. הֶֽעֱמַדְתִּיךָ from עָמַד , <em> stetit</em> , in Hiph. <em> stare fecit</em> ; hence taken to signify (1) ‘ <em> constituit, muneri præfecit</em> ,’ as <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ki+12:32">1 Kings 12:32</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="isa+21:6">Isaiah 21:6</span> (LXX σεαυτῷ στῆσον σκόπον ); <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="es+4:5">Esther 4:5</span> , (2) ‘ <em> confirmavit</em> ,’ as 1Ki 15:4 al., and (3) ‘ <em> prodire fecit, excitavit</em> ,’ <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="da+11:11">Daniel 11:11</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ne+6:7">Nehemiah 6:7</span> ; the meaning ‘ <em> incolumem prœstitit</em> ,’ given in the Lexicons, seems to be grounded on the following of the LXX in this passage, who apparently understood it of Pharaoh being kept safe through the plagues. This has been done by modern interpreters [perhaps] to avoid the strong assertion which the Apostle here gives, purposely deviating from the LXX, that Pharaoh was ‘ <em> raised up</em> ,’ called into action in his office, to be an example of God’s dealing with impenitent sinners. The word chosen by the Apostle, ἐξεγείρω , in its transitive sense, is often used by the LXX for ‘to rouse into action:’ see besides reff. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+56:8">Psalms 56:8</span> ; <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ps+79:2">Psalms 79:2</span> ; Son 4:16 al. So that the meaning (3) given above for the Heb. verb ‘prodire fecit, excitavit,’ was evidently that intended by ἐξήγειρα ), <strong> that I may shew in thee</strong> (‘in thee as an example,’ ‘in thy case,’ ‘by thee’) <strong> my power</strong> ( τ . ἰσχύν μου LXX-B: δύν . (which is read in A) is perhaps chosen by the Apostle as more <em> general</em> , ἰσχύς applying rather to those deeds of miraculous power of which Egypt was then witness), <strong> and that my Name may be proclaimed in all the earth</strong> (compare as a comment, the words of the song of triumph, Exo 15:14-16 ).</p>
