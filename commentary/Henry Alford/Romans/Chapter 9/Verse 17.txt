<b> 17.</b>] The same great truth shewn on its<i> darker side</i>:—as regards not only God’s<i> mercy</i>, but His<i> wrath</i> also.—<b>For</b> (confirmation of the universal truth of the last inference)<b> the scripture</b> (identified with God, its Author: the case is different when merely something<i> contained</i> in Scripture is introduced by “<i>the Scripture saith</i>:” there<i> the Scripture</i> is merely personified. The justice of this remark will be apparent, if we reflect that this expression could not be used of the<i> mere ordinary words of any man</i> in the historical Scriptures, Ahab, or Hezekiah,—but only where<i> the text itself</i> speaks, or where<i> God spoke,</i> or, as here,<i> some man under inspiration of God</i>)<b> saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up</b> (literally in the Hebrew, “<i>made thee stand</i>;” the Septuagint have “<i>thou wert preserved to this day</i>:” they apparently understood it of Pharaoh being kept safe through the plagues. This has perhaps been done to avoid the strong assertion which the Apostle here gives, purposely deviating from the Septuagint, that Pharaoh was ‘<i>raised up</i>,’ called into action in his office, to be an example of God’s dealing with impenitent sinners),<b> that I may shew forth my power</b> (those deeds of miraculous power, of which Egypt was then witness)<b> in thee</b> ( ‘in thee as an example,’— ‘in thy case,’— ‘by thee’),<b> and that my name may be published abroad in all the earth</b> (compare as a comment, the words of the song of triumph, Exod. xv. 14–16).
