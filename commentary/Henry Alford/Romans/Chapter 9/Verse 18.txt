<b> 18.</b>]<b> Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will</b> (ref. to ver. 15, where see note),<b> and whom he will he hardeneth.</b>—The frequent recurrence of the expression “<i>to harden the heart</i>” in the history of Pharaoh should have kept Commentators from attempting to give to<b> harden</b> here the sense of<i> treating hardly</i>, against which the next verse would be decisive, if there were no other reason for rejecting it. Whatever difficulty there lies in this assertion, that God<i> hardeneth</i> whom He will, lies also<i> in the daily course of His Providence</i>, in which we see this hardening process going on in the case of the prosperous ungodly man. The fact is patent, whether declared by revelation or read in history: but to the solution of it, and its reconciliation with the equally certain fact of human responsibility, we shall never attain in this imperfect state, however we may strive to do so by subtle refinements and distinctions. The following is the admirable advice of Augustine, from whom in this case it comes with double weight, seeing that he was a strenuous upholder of God’s sovereign grace: “Let it be enough for the Christian, living as yet by faith, and not yet seeing what is perfect, but knowing it only in part, to know, or to believe, that God acquits none except of His free mercy, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and condemns none, except of most equitable justice, through the same our Lord Jesus Christ. But why He acquits or does not acquit one rather than another, let him who can, search into the so great deep of His judgments: but—let him beware of the precipitous descent.”
