<b> 19.</b>]<b> Thou wilt say then unto me</b> (there seems no reason to suppose the objector a Jew:—the objection is a<i> general one</i>, applying to all mankind, and likely to arise in the mind of any reader. The expression “<i>O man</i>” seems to confirm this),<b> Why then</b> (then is omitted in our received text, but is found in our principal authorities)<b> doth he yet find fault</b> (yet, as ch. iii. 7: assuming your premises,— ‘<i>if this be so</i>: at the same time it expresses a certain irritation on the part of the objector)?<b> For who resisteth</b> (not, ‘<i>hath resisted</i>,’ which is a mistake on the part of the A.V.)<b> his will</b> (i. e. if it be His will to harden the sinner, and the sinner goes on in his sin, he does not resist, but goes with the will of God)?<b> Yea rather</b> (or,<b> Nay but</b>: these words take the ground from under the previous assertion and supersede it by another: implying that it has a certain shew of truth, but that the proper view of the matter is yet to be stated.

As Chrysostom and Calvin well remark, “he first by this rebuke humiliates the objector, and prepares his mind to receive the answer to his impious cavil”)—<b>Shall the thing formed</b> (properly of a production of<i> plastic</i> art moulded of clay or wax)<b> say to him that formed it, “Why didst thou make me thus?”—</b> These words are slightly altered from Isa. xxix. 16, “<i>Shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?</i>”—<b>Or</b> (intro-duces a new objection, or fresh ground of rebuke, see ch. ii. 4; iii. 29; vi. 3; xi. 2)<b> hath not the potter power over the clay</b> (the similitude from Isa. xlv. 9.
