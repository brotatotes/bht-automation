The expression ὦ ἄνθρωπε seems to confirm this), <strong> Why then doth He yet find fault</strong> ( ἔτι as ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:7">Romans 3:7</span> , assuming your premises, ‘ <em> if this be so</em> :’ at the same time it expresses a certain irritation on the part of the objector: ‘exprimit morosum fremitum,’ Bengel. μέμφομαι has a stronger sense than mere <em> blame</em> here: Hesych [79] interprets it αἰτιᾶται , ἐξουθενεῖ , καταγινώσκει : see the apocryphal reff. Thol.)? <strong> For who resists</strong> (not, ‘ <em> hath resisted</em> :” ἀνθέστηκεν , like ἕστηκεν , is <em> present</em> , see Winer, edn. 6, § 40. 4. b, and compare ἐφέστηκεν , 2Ti 4:6 ) <strong> His will</strong> (i.e. if it be His will to harden the sinner, and the sinner goes on in his sin, he does not resist but goes with the will of God)? <strong> Yea rather</strong> ( μενοῦνγε , see reff., takes the ground from under the previous assertion and supersedes it by another: implying that it has a certain show of truth, but that the proper view of the matter is yet to be stated. It thus conveys, as in ref. Luke, an intimation of rebuke; here, with severity: ‘that which thou hast said, may be correct human reasoning but as against God’s sovereignty, thy reasoning is out of place and irrelevant’), <strong> O man</strong> (perhaps without emphasis implying the contrast between man and God, for this is done by the emphatic σύ following, and we have ἄνθρωπε unemphatic in ch.

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [80] The CODEX SINAITICUS. Procured by Tischendorf, in 1859, from the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. The Codex Frederico-Augustanus (now at Leipsic), obtained in 1844 from the same monastery, is a portion of the same copy of the Greek Bible, the 148 leaves of which, containing the entire New Testament, the Ep. of Barnabas, parts of Hermas, and 199 more leaves of the Septuagint, have now been edited by the discoverer. A magnificent edition prepared at the expense of the Emperor of Russia appeared in January, 1863, and a smaller edition containing the N.T. &amp;c., has been published by Dr. Tischendorf. The MS. has four columns on a page, and has been altered by several different correctors, one or more of whom Tischendorf considers to have lived in the sixth century. The work of the original scribe has been examined, not only by Tischendorf, but by Tregelles and other competent judges, and is by them assigned to the <em> fourth</em> <em> century</em> . The internal character of the text agrees with the external, as the student may judge for himself from the readings given in the digest. The principal correctors as distinguished by Tischendorf are: A, of the same age with the MS. itself, probably the corrector who revised the book, before it left the hands of the scribe, denoted therefore by us א -corr 1 ; B (cited as א 2 ), who in the first page of Matt. began inserting breathings, accents, &amp;c., but did not carry out his design, and touched only a few later passages; C a (cited as א 3a ) has corrected very largely throughout the book. Wherever in our digest a reading is cited as found in א 1 , it is to be understood, if no further statement is given, that C a altered it to that which is found in our text; C b (cited as א 3b ) lived about the same time as C a , i.e. some centuries later than the original scribe.

<p>Notice, that the answer to the objector’s question does not lie in these <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:20-21">Romans 9:20-21</span> , but in the following (see there); the present verses are a rebuke administered to the <em> spirit</em> of the objection, which forgets the immeasurable distance between us and God, and the relation of Creator and Disposer in which He stands to us. So Chrys., καὶ οὐδὲ τὴν λύσιν εὐθέως ἐπάγει , συμφερόντως καὶ τοῦτο ποιῶν · ἀλλ ʼ ἐπιστομίζει πρῶτον τὸν ζητοῦντα , λέγων οὕτω <strong> μενοῦνγε</strong> <strong> … </strong> <strong> θεῷ</strong> ; ποιεῖ δὲ τοῦτο , τὴν ἄκαιρον αὐτοῦ περιεργίαν ἀναστέλλων , κ . τὴν πολλὴν πολυπραγμοσύνην , κ . χαλινὸν περιτιθείς , κ . παιδεύων εἰδέναι τί μὲν θεὸς τί δὲ ἄνθρωπος , κ . πῶς ἀκατάληπτος αὐτοῦ ἡ πρόνοια , κ . πῶς ὑπερβαίνουσα τὸν ἡμέτερον λογισμόν , κ . πῶς ἅπαντα αὐτῷ πείθεσθαι δεῖ · ἵνα ὅταν τοῦτο κατασκευάσῃ παρὰ τῷ ἀκροατῇ , κ . καταστείλῃ κ . λεάνῃ τὴν γνώμην , τότε μετὰ πολλῆς εὐκολίας ἐπάγων τὴν λύσιν , εὐπαράδεκτον αὐτῷ ποιήσῃ τὸ λεγόμενον . Hom. xvi. p. 614. Similarly Calvin: ‘Hac priori responsione nihil aliud quam improbitatem illius blasphemiæ retundit, argumento ab hominis conditione sumpto. Alteram mox subjiciet, qua Dei justitiam ab omni criminatione vindicabit.’

Isa. In Sirach 36 (33) 13, we have a very similar sentiment: ὡς πηλὸς κεραμέως ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ .… οὕτως ἄνθρωποι ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ ποιήσαντος αὐτούς . And even more strikingly so, Wis 15:7 ; καὶ γὰρ κεραμεὺς ἁπαλὴν γῆν θλίβων ἐπίμοχθον πλάσσει πρὸς ὑπηρεσίαν ἡμῶν ἕκαστον ( ἓν ἕκ .

See also Jer 18:6 ), <strong> out of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour</strong> (honourable uses) <strong> and another unto dishonour</strong> (dishonourable uses. See ref. 2 Tim. The honour and dishonour are not here the <em> moral purity or impurity</em> of the human vessels, but their <em> ultimate glorification</em> or <em> perdition</em> . The Apostle in asking this question, rather aims at striking dumb the objector by a statement of God’s undoubted right, against which it does not become us men to murmur, than at unfolding to us the actual state of the case. This he does in the succeeding verses; see above, from Chrys. and Calv.)?

<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [82] The MS. referred to by this symbol is that commonly called the Alexandrine, or CODEX ALEXANDRINUS. It once belonged to Cyrillus Lucaris, patriarch of Alexandria and then of Constantinople, who in the year 1628 presented it to our King Charles I. It is now in the British Museum. It is on parchment in four volumes, of which three contain the Old, and one the New Testament, with the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians. This fourth volume is exhibited open in a glass case. It will be seen by the letters in the inner margin of this edition, that the first 24 chapters of Matthew are wanting in it, its first leaf commencing ὁ νυμφίος , ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span> : as also the leaves containing ἵνα , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:50">John 6:50</span> , to καὶ σύ , <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:52">John 8:52</span> . It is generally agreed that it was written at Alexandria; it does not, however, <em> in the Gospels</em> , represent that commonly known as the Alexandrine text, but approaches much more nearly to the Constantinopolitan, or generally received text. The New Testament, according to its text, was edited, in uncial types cast to imitate those of the MS., by Woide, London, 1786, the Old Testament by Baber, London, 1819: and its N.T. text has now been edited in common type by Mr. B. H. Cowper, London, 1861. The date of this MS. has been variously assigned, but it is now pretty generally agreed to be the <em> fifth century</em> .
	</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em;"> [83] The CODEX EPHRAEMI, preserved in the Imperial Library at Paris, MS. Gr. No. 9. It is a Codex rescriptus or palimpsest, consisting of the works of Ephraem the Syrian written over the MS. of extensive fragments of the Old and New Testaments 2 . It seems to have come to France with Catherine de’ Medici, and to her from Cardinal Nicolas Ridolfi. Tischendorf thinks it probable that he got it from Andrew John Lascaris, who at the fall of the Eastern Empire was sent to the East by Lorenzo de’ Medici to preserve such MSS. as had escaped the ravages of the Turks. This is confirmed by the later corrections (C 3 ) in the MS., which were evidently made at Constantinople 3 . But from the form of the letters, and other peculiarities, it is believed to have been written at Alexandria, or at all events, where the Alexandrine dialect and method of writing prevailed. Its text is perhaps the <em> purest</em> example of the Alexandrine text, holding a place about midway between the Constantinopolitan MSS. and most of those of the Alexandrine recension. It was edited very handsomely in uncial type, with copious dissertations, &amp;c., by Tischendorf, in 1843. He assigns to it an age at least equal to A, and places it also in the <em> fifth century</em> . Corrections were written in, apparently in the sixth and ninth centuries: these are respectively cited as C 2 , C 3 .
