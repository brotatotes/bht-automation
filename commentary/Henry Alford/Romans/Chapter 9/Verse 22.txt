<b> 22.</b>]<b> What if</b> (1)<b> God, purposing to shew forth His wrath, and to make His power</b> (that which He could do)<b> known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted</b> (prepared, made complete and ready)<b> for destruction: and</b> (what if this took place) (2)<b> to the end that He might make known the riches of His glory on</b> (i. e.<i> ‘toward</i>,’ ‘with regard to’)<b> the vessels of mercy, which He before prepared for glory</b> (I have given the whole, that my view of the construction might be evident: viz. that (1) and (2) are parallel clauses, both dependent on<b> what if; purposing</b> giving the intent of the first, and<b> to the end that he might make known</b> that of the second.—The argument is, ‘What if God, in the case of the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, has, in willing to manifest His power and wrath, also exhibited towards them longsuffering (to lead them to repentance, ch. ii. 4,—a mystery which we cannot fathom), and in having mercy on the vessels of mercy prepared for glory, has also made manifest the riches of His glory?” Then in both these dispensations will appear, not the arbitrary power, but the rich goodness of God.—The theological difficulties in the words<b> fitted for destruction, and which he before prepared for glory</b> (mind, in both cases God is the agent: He fits the one for destruction, and prepares the other for glory), are but such as have occurred repeatedly before, and are inherent, not in the Apostle’s argument, nor even in revelation, but in<i> any consistent belief of an omnipotent and omniscient God</i>. See remarks on ver. 18.—<b>Vessels of wrath</b> and<b> vessels of mercy</b> are<i> vessels prepared to subserve</i>, as it were to hold, His wrath and mercy: hardly, as Calvin,<i> instruments to shew them forth</i>: that is<i> done</i>, over and above their being vessels, but is not necessary to it.—These vessels of wrath and vessels of mercy are not to be, with a view to evade the general application, confined to the instances of Pharaoh and the Jews: these instances give occasion to the argument, but the argument itself is general, extending to all the dealings of God).
