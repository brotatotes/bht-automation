It is difficult to ascertain in what sense the Apostle cites these two passages from Hosea as applicable to the Gentiles being called to be the people of God. That he<i> does</i> so, is manifest from the words themselves, and from the transition to the Jews in ver. 27. In the prophet they are spoken of<i> Israel</i>; see ch. i. 6–11, and ch. ii. throughout: who after being rejected and put away, was to be again received into favour by God. Two ways are open, by which their citation by the Apostle may be understood. Either (1) he brings them forward to shew that it is consonant with what we know of God’s dealings, to<i> receive as His people</i> those who<i> were</i> formerly<i> not His people</i>—that this may now take place with regard to the Gentiles, as it was announced to happen with regard to Israel,—and even more,—that Israel in this, as in so many other things, was the prophetic mirror in which God foreshewed on a small scale His future dealings with mankind,—or (2) he adduces them from mere applicability to the subject in hand, implying, ‘It has been with us Gentiles, as with Israel in the prophet Hosea.’ I own I much prefer the former of these, as more consonant with the dignity of the argument, and as apparently justified by the<b> also</b>,—as He saith<i> also</i> in Hosea, implying perhaps that the matter in hand was not that directly prophesied in the citation, but one analogous to it. Chrysostom takes the same view.<b> Her</b> is used, because the Jewish people was typified by the<i> daughter of</i> the prophet, Hos. i. 6, who was called Lo-ruhamah, ‘not having obtained mercy.’
