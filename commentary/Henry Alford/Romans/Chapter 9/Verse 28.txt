<b> 28.</b>] The reference of this latter part of the citation is not very plain. It is almost verbatim from the Septuagint, the<b> for</b> being inserted by the Apostle as continuing the testimony, ‘for the prophet proceeds.’ The literal rendering of the Hebrew is, “The consummation (or consumption) decided, overfloweth with righteousness: for a decision (or consumption) and a decree shall the Lord Jehovah of Sabaoth make in the midst of all the land.” As it stands in the Septuagint, the meaning seems to be,<i> the Lord will complete</i><i> and soon fulfil His word in righteousness</i> (viz. his denunciation of consuming the Assyrian and liberating the remnant of His people):<i> for the Lord will make a rapidly-accomplished word in the midst of all the land.</i> If the above interpretation be correct, and the view which I have taken of the analogy of prophecy, it will follow that this verse is adduced by the Apostle as confirming the certainty of the salvation of the remnant of Israel, seeing that now, as then, He with whom a thousand years are as a day, will swiftly accomplish His prophetic word in righteousness.
