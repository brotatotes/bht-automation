<b> 31.]</b><b> But Israel, pursuing after the law of righteousness</b> (what is the<i> law of righteousness?</i> It may mean either (1) an<i> ideal law of righteousness</i>, a<i> justifying law</i>,—or (2)<i> the law of Moses</i>, thus described: or (3) which I believe to be the true account of the words, “<i>the</i><b> law</b><i> of righteousness</i>” is put regarding the Jews, rather than merely “<i>righteousness</i>,” because in their case there was a prescribed<i> norm</i> of apparent righteousness, viz. the law, in which rule and way they, as<i> matter of fact, followed after it. The above, as I beli</i> eve, mistaken interpretations arise from supposing the<i> law of righteousness</i> to be equivalent to<i> righteousness itself</i>, which it is not. The Jews followed after, aimed at the fulfilment of ‘<i>the law of righteousness</i>,’ thinking by the observance of that law to acquire righteousness, See ch. x. 3, 5, and note; and compare John’s coming ‘<i>in the way of righteousness</i>,” Matt. xxi. 32),<b> arrived not at</b> (the word is not the same as that rendered “<i>attained to</i>” in the preceding verse)<b> the law</b> (fell far short even of that law, which was given them, The words “<i>of righteousness</i>,” which follow here in the A.V., are omitted by nearly all our most ancient authorities. The sense is more difficult, but in reality more complete, without these words. The Jews followed after, thinking to perform it entirely, their<i> law of righteousness</i>: which the Apostle defines, ch. x. 5, to be<i> righteousness which is by the law</i>. But they did not arrive at, come up to the requirements of,—<b>the law—</b>they therefore never attained righteousness),<b> Wherefore? because</b> [<b>pursuing</b> after it]<b> not by faith, but as</b> (used subjectively, as ‘if about to obtain their object by’)<b> by</b> [<b>the</b>]<b> works</b> [of the<b> law</b>] (these words,<i> of the law</i>, are omitted by some ancient authorities, but inserted by others. If we omit them, the clause will stand,<b> but as by works</b>),<b> they stumbled at the stone of stumbling</b> (the similitude of a race is still kept up. The “<i>for</i>” found here in the A.V., is omitted by nearly all our ancient authorities. Its insertion has arisen from a period being placed at the word<b> law</b>. It confuses the sense, making it appear as if the stumbling was the cause of, or at all events coincident with, their pursuing not by faith, but&c., whereas it was this mistaken method of pursuing which caused them to stumble against the stone of stumbling. We have instances in the Greek chariot races, of competitors, by an error in judgment in driving, striking against the pillar round which the chariots were to turn, There is a close analogy between our text and the exhortation in Heb. xii 1 f. There, after the triumphs of faith have been related, we are exhorted to run with patience the race set before us, looking to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of<i> our faith</i>; where notice, that the sacred Writer seems to have had in his mind the same comparison of Him to the pillar or goal, to which the eyes of the runners would be exclusively directed).
