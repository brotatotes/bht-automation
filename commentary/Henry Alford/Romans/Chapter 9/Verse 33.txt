<b> 33.</b>]<i> Appeal to the prophecy of Isaiah</i>, as justifying this comparison of Christ to a stone of stumbling. The citation is gathered from: two places in Isaiah, The ‘stone of stumbling and rock of offence,’ mentioned ch. viii. 14, is substituted for the ‘cornerstone elect, precious,’ of ch. xxviii. 16. The solution of this is very simple. Isa. viii. 14 was evidently interpreted by the Jews themselves of the Messiah: for Simeon, Luke ii. 34, when speaking of the child Jesus as the Messiah, expressly adduces the prophecy as about to be fulfilled. Similarly Isa. xxviii. 16 was interpreted by the Chaldee Targum, the Babylonish Talmud, &c, What was there then to prevent the Apostle from giving to this Stone, plainly foretold as to be laid in Zion, that designation which prophecy also justifies, and which bears immediately on the matter here in hand? See 1 Pet. ii. 6–8, where the same two texts are joined, and also Ps. cxviii, 22.<b> Shall not be put to shame</b> seems to he a secondary meaning of the Hebrew word, which signifies, as in our version of Isa. xxviii. 16, ‘shall not<i> make haste</i>: i.e. shall not fly in terror, shall not be confounded.
