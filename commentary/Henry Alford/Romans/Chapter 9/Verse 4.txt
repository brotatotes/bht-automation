<b> 4.</b>] Not only on their relationship to himself does he ground this sorrow and this self-devotion: but on the recollection of their ancient privileges and glories—<b>Who are Israelites</b> (a name of honour, see John i. 47; 2 Cor. xi. 22; Phil. iii. 5);<b> whose</b> (<b>is</b>)<b> the adoption</b> (see Exod. iy. 22; Deut. xiv. 1; xxxii. 6; Isa. i. 2),<b> and the glory</b> (perhaps their general preference and exaltation, consequent on the adoption,—but far more probably, as all the other substantives refer to separate matters of fact,—the Shechinah, or visible manifestation of the divine Presence on the mercy-seat between the cherubims; see references),<b> and the covenants</b> (not,<i> the two tables of the law</i>,—as some understand it,—which formed but one covenant, and are included in “<i>the giving of the law;</i>” nor,<i> the Old and New Testament Covenants,</i>—as others,—see Gal. iv. 24 ff.: but<i> the several renewals of the covenant</i> with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and finally with the whole people at Sinai:—see Gen. xv. 9–21; xvii. 4, 7, 10; xxvi. 24; xxviii. 13; Exod. xxiv. 7, 8),<b> and the giving of the law</b> ( “if others boast of their Solons and Lycurguses, how far juster ground of boasting: is there of the Lord as Lawgiver!”? Calvin. The word includes both the act of giving the Law, and the Law thus given),<b> and the service</b> (ordinances of worship: see Heb. ix. 1, 6: the words in brackets are not expressed in the original, but are implied in the word used),<b> and the promises</b> (probably only those to the patriarchs, of a Redeemer to come, are here thought of, as the next two clauses place the patriarchs and Christ. together without any mention of the prophets. So Abraham is described, Heb. vii. 6, as “<i>he that had the promises</i>”),—w<b> hose are the fathers</b> (probably to be limited to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:—but Stephen gives the appellation a much wider meaning in Acts vii. 11, 12, 19, 39, 44, and so apparently St. Paul himself, Acts xiii. 17. In all those places, however, except Acts vii. 19, “<i>our</i>” is joined with the word “<i>fathers</i>,” whereas here it is absolute: so that the above limitation may be true),—<b>and of whom is Christ, so far as regards the flesh</b> (the expression implies that He was not<i> entirely</i> sprung from them, but had another nature; ‘<i>on His human side</i>’— “<i>as far as pertains to His human body</i>”),<b> who is God over all</b> (this word<b> all</b> is of uncertain gender in the original, but must be probably taken as neuter:<b> all things</b>, not “<i>all persons</i>:” compare ch. xi. 36),<b> blessed for ever. Amen</b>.—The punctuation and application of this doxology have been much disputed. By the early Church it was generally rendered as above, and applied to Christ. Passages, it is true, have been collected from the fathers to shew that they applied the words “<i>God over all</i>” to<i> the</i> FATHER<i> alone, and protested against their application to the</i> SON; but these passages themselves protest only against the erroneous Noetian or Sabellian view of the<i> identity</i> of the Father and the Son, whereas in Eph. iv. 5, 6, “<i>one Lord</i>,” “<i>one God and Father of all, who is over all,</i>” are plainly distinguished. That our Lord is not, in the strict exclusive sense, “<i>the God who is over all</i>,” every Christian will admit, that title being reserved for the Father: but that He is “<i>God over all</i>” none of the above-mentioned passages goes to deny.—The first trace of a different interpretation, if it be one, is found in an assertion of the Emperor Julian, who says that our Lord is never called God by St. Paul, nor by St. Matthew, or St. Mark, but by St. John only. The next is in the punctuation of two of our later manuscripts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, which arrange the sentence thus: of whom as concerning the flesh is Christ. God over all [be] blessed for ever.” This is followed by several among the moderns, and generally by Socinians. The objections to this rendering are, (1) ingennously suggested by Socinus himself, and never yet obviated,—that without one exception in Hebrew or Greek, wherever an ascription of blessing is found, the predicate<b> blessed</b><i> precedes</i> the name of God. (2) That the words<b> who is</b> on this rendering, would be superfluous altogether (see below). (3) That the doxology would be unmeaning and frigid in the extreme. It is not the habit of the Apostle to break out into irrelevant ascriptions of praise; and certainly there is here nothing in the immediate context requiring one. If it be said that the survey of all these privileges bestowed on his people prompts the doxology,—surely such a view is most unnatural: for the sad subject of the Apostle’s sympathy, to which he immediately recurs again, is the apparent<i> inanity</i> of all these privileges in the exclusion from life of those who were dignified with them. If it be said that the<i> incarnation of Christ</i> is the exciting cause, the words “<i>according to the flesh</i>” come in most strangely, depreciating, as it would on that supposition, the greatness of the event, which then becomes a source of so lofty a thanksgiving. (4) That the expression “<i>blessed for ever</i>” is twice besides used by St. Paul, and each time unquestionably not in an ascription of praise, but in<i> an assertion regarding the subject of the sentence</i>. The places are, ch. i. 25, and 2 Cor. xi. 31: whereas he uses the phrase “<i>Blessed be God</i>” as an ascription of praise, without joining “<i>for ever</i>.” See the rest of the discussion in my Greek Test. I have shewn there, that the rendering given in the text is not only that most agreeable to the usage of the Apostle,<i> but the only one admissible by the rules of grammar and arrangement.</i> It also admirably suits the context: for, having enumerated the historic advantages of the Jewish people, he concludes by stating one which ranks far higher than all,—that from them sprung, according to the flesh, He who is God over all, blessed for ever.—<b>Amen</b> is the accustomed ending of such solemn declarations of the divine Majesty: compare ch. i. 25.
