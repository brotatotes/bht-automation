But. Theodoret ascribes the verse to Callimachus, in whose Hymn to Zeus, ver. 8, the words “the Cretans are always liars” are found. To this however Jerome [as also Epiphanius] answers, that Callimachus took the words from Epimenides.—EPIMENIDES was a native of Phæstus in Crete, and lived about 600 B.C. He was sent for to Athens to undertake the purification of the city from the pollution occasioned by Cylon (see articles ‘Epimenides’ and ‘Cylon,’ in the Dict. of Biography and Mythology), and is said to have lived to an extreme old age, and to have been buried at Lacedæmon. The appellation<i> ‘prophet’</i> seems to have belonged to him in its literal sense: Cicero describes him as one of those who in an excitement of mind, or by its free motion, foretold future events: and Apuleius calls him an illustrious declarer of the fates, and a poet. And Diogenes Laertius tells us that the Cretans sacrificed to him as a god.—On the character here given of the Cretans, see Introd. to this Epistle,§ii. 9 ff.<b> slothful bellies</b> is said of those who by indulging their bodily appetites have become corpulent and indolent).
