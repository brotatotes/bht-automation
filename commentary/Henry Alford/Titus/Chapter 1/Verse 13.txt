Alcest. 985, οὐδέ τις ἀποτόμου λήματός ἐστιν αἰδώς : Soph. Œd. Tyr. 876, ἀπότομον ὤρουσεν εἰς ἄναγκαν ), <strong> that</strong> (in order that: De W. takes ἵνα κ . τ . λ ., for the substance of the rebuke, as in παραγγέλλειν ἵνα and the like (?): but there appears to be no sufficient reason for this) <strong> they may be healthy in the faith</strong> (not, ‘ <em> in faith</em> ,’ as Conyb.: even were no article expressed after ἐν , it <em> might</em> be ‘in the faith:’ when that article <em> is</em> expressed, the definite reference can never be overlooked.
