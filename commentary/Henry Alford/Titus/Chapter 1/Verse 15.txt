<b> 15</b>.]<i> The Apostle’s own answer to those who would enforce these commandments.</i><b> All things</b> (absolutely—all things with which man ean be concerned)<b> are pure to the pure</b> ( “God created nothing impure: for nothing is impure except sin only: for this lays hold of the soul, and defiles it,” Chrysostom. See Matt. xxiii, 26: Luke xi. 41. There is no ground whatever for supposing this to be a maxim of the false teachers, quoted by the Apostle, any more than the “<i>all things are lawful for me</i>” of 1 Cor. vi. 12, where see note. The maxim here is a truly Christian one of the noblest order.—As usual in these Epistles [see Introd.§i. 88],<i> purity</i> is inseparably connected with soundness in the faith, compare Acts xv. 9,—and 1 Tim. iv. 8, where our words, “<i>to the pure</i>,” are expanded into “<i>those who are faithful and know the truth</i>”):<b> but to the polluted and unbelieving</b> (see the preceding remarks)<b> nothing is pure; but both</b> (or<i> ‘even</i>,’ as A.V.:—but the other seems preferable, on account of the close correspondence of the two faeultics mentioned)<b> their mind</b> (their rational part, Eph. iv. 17, which presides over and leads all the determinate acts and thoughts of the man)<b> and their conscience is polluted</b> (and therefore, uncleanness tainting their rational acts and their reflective self-recognitions, nothing: can be pure to them: every occasion be-comes to them an occasion of sin, every creature of God an instrument of sin; as Mack well observes, “The relation, in which the sinful subject stands to the objects of its possession or of its inclination, is a sinful one”).
