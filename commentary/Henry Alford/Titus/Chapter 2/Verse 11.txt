<b> 11.</b>]<b> For</b> (reasons for the above exhortations from ver. 1: not as Chrysostom and others, only for vv. 9, 10. The latter clause of ver. 10, it is true, gives occasion to this declaration; but the reference of these verses is far wider than merely to slaves)<b> the grace of God</b> (that divine favour to men, of which the whole process of Redemption was a proof: not to be limited to<i> Christ’s Incarnation</i>: though certainly this may be said for that interpretation, that<i> it</i> may<i> also</i> be regarded as a term inclusive of all the blessings of Redemption: but it does not follow, that of two such inclusive terms, the one may be substituted for the other)<i> was manifested bringing salvation to all men</i> (this “<i>to all men</i>” follows “<i>bringing salvation,</i>” not as in A. V,, “<i>was manifested</i>.” Thus we have “the Saviour of all men,” 1 Tim. iv. 10: see also ib. ii. 4),<b> disciplining us</b> (see note on 1 Tim. i. 20. There is no need to depart from the universal New Testament sense of this word, and soften it into<i> ‘teaching</i>? the education which the Christian man receives from the grace of God, is a discipline, properly so called, of self-denial and training in godliness, accompanied therefore with much mortification and punitive treatment),<b> in order that</b> (by the ordinary rendering, “<i>teaching us, that,</i>’ we make<b> that</b> introduce merely the<i> purport</i> of the teaching, whereas this is said of the<i> purpose</i>),<b> denying</b> (not, ‘having denied’)<b> ungodliness and the lusts of the world</b> (<i> ‘all</i> worldly lusts.’<b> Worldly</b>, belonging to that world which lieth in the wicked one, and is without, God: see 1 John ii. 15–17),<b> we might live soberly, and justly</b> (better than<i> ‘righteously</i>,— ‘righteous,’ by its forensic objective sense in St. Paul, introducing a confusion, where the question is of moral rectitude),<b> and godly, in the present life</b> (as St. Bernard says,<i> soberly</i> respects<i> ourselves</i>,—<i>justly</i>, our neighbour,—<i>godly</i>, our God.—These three comprising our<i> discipline</i> in faith and love, he now comes to<i> hope</i>);<b> looking for the blessed hope</b> (here, as in Gal. v. 5, Col. i. 5 al., nearly objective,—the hope, as embodying the thing hoped for),<b> and manifestation</b> (<i>hope and manifestation</i> belong together)<b> of the glory</b> (Chrysostom says, ‘He speaks here of two manifestations; the former of grace, the latter of glory.” Nothing could be more unfortunate than the rendering of the A.V., “<i>glorious appearing</i>,” by which the whole sense is obscured)<b> of the great God</b> (the Father: see below)<b> and of our Saviour Jesus Christ</b> (as regards the sense, an exact parallel is found in Matt. xvi. 27, “<i>The Son of man is about to come in the glory of His Father</i>,” compared with Matt. xxv. 31, “<i>When the Son of man shall come in His glory.</i>” See also 1 Pet. iv. 13. The glory which shall be revealed at the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ is<i> His own</i> glory,<i> and</i> that<i> of His Father</i> [John xvii, 3; 1 Thess. iii. 13]. This sense has been obscured by the foolish rendering of the A.V. see above. And we now come to consider the meaning of the words<i> the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ</i>. Two views have been taken of them: (1) that<b> the great God and our Saviour</b> are to be taken together as the description of<b> Jesus Christ</b>,— ‘<i>of Jesus Christ, the great God and our Saviour</i>: (2) that, as given above,<b> the great God</b> describes the Father, and<b> our Saviour Jesus Christ</b> the Son. It is obvious that in dealing with (1), we shall be deciding with regard to (2) also. (1) has been the view of the Greek orthodox Fathers, and of most ancient and modern Commentators. That the former so interpreted the words, is obviously not [as it has been considered] decisive of the question, if they can be shewn to bear legitimately another meaning, and that meaning to be the one most likely to have been in the mind of the writer. The passage must be argued primarily on its own ground, not primarily on the consensus of the Greek Fathers. No one disputes that it<i> may</i> mean that which they have inter-preted it: and there were obvious reasons why they, having licence to do so, should choose this interpretation. But it is our object, not being swayed, in this or any other interpretation, by doctrinal considerations one way or the other, to enquire, not what the words<i> may</i> mean, but what they<i> do</i> mean, as far as we may be able to ascertain it.—I have in my Greek ‘Test. argued first from the construction of the sentence, and then from the Apostle’s usage of the expression “God our Saviour:” and from both of these considerations I have deduced that it is not probable he meant to apply the whole of this to our Lord, but the former portion to the Father, and the latter to the Son. The reasoning on the second point may be intelligible to the English reader. The expression “<i>God our Saviour</i>” occurs six times in these Epistles, once in Luke (i. 47], and once in the Epistle of Jude. If the writer<i> here</i> identities this expression, ‘the great God and our Saviour,’ with the Lord Jesus Christ, calling Him*God and our Saviour,’ it will be at least probable that in other places where he speaks of “God our Saviour,” he also designates our Lord Jesus Christ. Now is that so? On the contrary, in I Tim. i. 1,<i> we have the command of God our Saviour and of Christ Jesus our hope</i>: where I suppose none will deny that the Father and the Son are most plainly distinguished from one another. The same is the case in 1 Tim, ii. 3–5, a passage bearing much [see below] on the interpretation of this one: and consequently in 1 Tim. iv. 10, where “<i>is the Saviour of all men</i>” corresponds to “<i>willeth all to be saved</i>” in the other. So also in Titus i. 8, where “<i>our Saviour God</i>,” by whose “<i>command</i>” the promise of eternal life was manifested, with the proclamation of which St. Paul was entrusted, is the same “<i>eternal God</i>,’ by whose “<i>command</i>” the hidden mystery was manifested in Rom. xvi. 26, where the same distinction is made. The only place where there could be any doubt is in our ver. 10, which possible doubt however is removed by ver. 11, where the same assertion is made, of the revelation of the hidden grace of God [the Father]. Then we have our own ch. iii. 4–6, where we find “<i>our Saviour God</i>” in ver. 4, clearly defined as the Father, and “<i>through Jesus Christ our Saviour</i>” in ver. 6. In the one passage of St. Jude, the distinction is equally clear: for there we have “<i>to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</i>” It is plain then, that the usage of the words ‘<i>God our Saviour</i>’ does not make it probable that the whole expression here is to be applied to the Lord Jesus Christ. And in estimating this probability, let us again recur to 1 Tim. ii. 3, 5, a passage which runs very parallel with the present one. We read there, “For there is one God,|and one Mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus, himself man, who gave Himself a ransom,”&ce. Compare this with “the great God|and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave Himself a ransom for us,”&c. Can there be a reasonable doubt, that the Apostle writing two sentences so closely corresponding, on a point of such high importance, would have in his view the same distinction in the second of them, which he so strongly lays down in the first?—Without then considering the question as closed, I would submit that (2) satisfies all the requirements of the sentence: that it is both structurally and contextually more probable, and mere agreeable to the Apostle’s way of writing: and I have therefore preferred it. Whichever way taken, the passage is just as important a testimony to the divinity of our Saviour: according to (1), by asserting His possession of Deity and right to the appellation of the Highest: according to (2), even more strikingly, asserting His equality in glory with the Father, in a way which would be blasphemy if predicated of any of the sons of men);<b> who</b> (our Saviour Jesus Christ)<b> gave Himself</b> ( “the forcible ‘Himself, His whole self, the greatest gift ever given,’ must not be overlooked.” Ellicott)<b> for us</b> ( ‘on our behalf, not ‘<i>in our stead</i>’),<b> that He might</b> (by this assertion of the Redeemer’s purpose, we return to the moral aim of verses 11, 12, more plainly indicated as in close connexion with Christ’s propitiatory sacrifice)<b> redeem</b> ( ‘<i>buy off with a price</i>.’ See note, 1 Tim. ii. 6: and compare 1 Pet. i. 18, where the price is stated to have been the precious blood of Christ)<b> us from all iniquity</b> (lawlessness: see 1 John iii. 4, “<i>sin is lawlessness</i>”),<b> and might purify</b> (by this statement that the Redeemer’s object was to purify to Himself a peculiar people, and not “<i>us</i>” merely, His purpose is lifted off from our particular ease, and generally and obJectively stated)<b> to Himself a people peculiarly His</b> (see note on Eph. i. 14; also 1 Pet. ii. 9),<b> zealous</b> (an ardent. worker and promoter)<b> of good works</b>.
