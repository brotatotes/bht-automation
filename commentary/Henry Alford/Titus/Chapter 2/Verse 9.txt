 9 .] ( παρακάλει )  Slaves to be in subjection to their own (see above on Tit 2:5 )  masters, in all things to give satisfaction (this, the servants’ own phrase among ourselves, expresses perhaps better than any other the meaning of εὐαρέστους εἶναι . ‘  To be acceptable ’ would seem to bring the slave too near to the position of a friend),  not contradicting (in the wide sense, not merely in words, see especially ref. John),  not purloining (ref. νοσφιζόμενον , ὑφαιρούμενον , ἰδιοποιούμενον , Suid. τὸ δ ʼ αὐτὸ καὶ σφετερίζεσθαι , Eustath.),  but manifesting (see ref. 2 Cor.)  all (possible, reff.)  good faith; that they may adorn in all things (not ‘  before all men ,’ as Heydenr., al.: cf. ἐν πᾶσιν above)  the doctrine of our Saviour, God (see on 1 Timothy 1:1 . Not Christ, but the Father is meant: in that place the distinction is clearly made. On this ‘  adorning ’ Calvin remarks, “Hæc quoque circumstantia notanda est (this is hardly worthy of his usually pure latinity), quod ornamentum Deus a servis accipere dignatur, quorum tam vilis et abjecta erat conditio, ut vix censeri soliti sint inter homines. Neque enim famulos intelligit quales hodie in usu sunt, sed mancipia, quæ pretio empta tanquam boves aut equi possidebantur. Quod si eorum vita ornamentum est Christiani nominis, multo magis videant qui in honore sunt, ne illud turpitudine sua maculent.” Thl. strikingly says, κἂν γὰρ τῷ δεσπότῃ διακονῇς ἀλλ ʼ ἡ τιμὴ εἰς θεὸν ἀνατρέχει , ὅτι καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου ἐκείνου ἡ πρὸς τὸν δεσπότην εὔνοια τὴν ἀρχὴν ἔχει ).
