<p><strong> 15</strong> .] SALUTATIONS: GREETINGS: APOSTOLIC; BENEDICTIONS. <strong> All that are with me salute thee. Salute those that love us in the faith</strong> (not ‘ <em> in faith</em> :’ see note, <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span> . This form of salutation, so different from any occurring in St. Paul’s other Epistles, is again [see on ch. Tit 1:1 ] a strong corroboration of genuineness. An apocryphal imitator would not have missed the Apostle’s regular formulæ of salutation). <strong> God’s</strong> ( ἡ ) <strong> grace be with all of you</strong> (of the Cretan churches. It does not follow <em> from this</em> that the letter was to be imparted to them: but in the course of things it naturally would be thus imparted by Titus).
