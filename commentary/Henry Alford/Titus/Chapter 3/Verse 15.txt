 15 .] SALUTATIONS: GREETINGS: APOSTOLIC; BENEDICTIONS.  All that are with me salute thee. Salute those that love us in the faith (not ‘  in faith :’ see note, 1 Timothy 1:2 . This form of salutation, so different from any occurring in St. Paul’s other Epistles, is again [see on ch. Tit 1:1 ] a strong corroboration of genuineness. An apocryphal imitator would not have missed the Apostle’s regular formulæ of salutation).  God’s ( ἡ )  grace be with all of you (of the Cretan churches. It does not follow  from this that the letter was to be imparted to them: but in the course of things it naturally would be thus imparted by Titus).
