<p><strong> 3</strong> .] <strong> For</strong> (reason why we should shew all meekness, &amp;c: οὐκοῦν μηδενὶ ὀνειδίσῃς , φησί · τοιοῦτος γὰρ ἦς καὶ σύ , Chrys. ὃ καὶ ὁ λῃστὴς πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον λῃστὴν ἔλεγεν , ὅτι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ κρίματί ἐσμεν . Thl.) <strong> we</strong> (Christians) <strong> also</strong> (as well as they) <strong> were</strong> (emphatically prefixed) <strong> once without understanding</strong> (of spiritual things, see Eph 4:18 ), <strong> disobedient</strong> (to God, ch. <span class="scriptRef" com="hac" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:16">Titus 1:16</span> ; he is no longer speaking of <em> authorities</em> , but has passed into a new train of thought), <strong> led astray</strong> (so Conyb.: the passive sense should be kept, as best answering to N. T. usage, ref. 2 Tim.: reff. Heb. and James, which Huther quotes for the neuter sense, are both better rendered passive. Ellic. advocates the neuter ‘ <em> going astray</em> ’), <strong> slaves to divers lusts and pleasures</strong> (see reff.: an unusual word in N. T., though so common in secular Greek), <strong> passing our lives</strong> (in ref. 1 Tim. βίον is expressed) <strong> in malice</strong> (reff.) <strong> and envy, hateful, hating one another</strong> (the sequence, if there be any, seems to be in the converse order from that assumed by Thl., ἄξιοι μίσους ἦμεν , ὡς ἀλλήλους μισοῦντες . It was our natural hatefulness which begot mutual hatred. Or perhaps the two particulars may be taken separately, as distinct items in our catalogue of depravities).</p>
