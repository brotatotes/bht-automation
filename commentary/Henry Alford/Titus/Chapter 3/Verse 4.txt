I prefer this plain rendering of the word to any of the more usual ones)<b> of our Saviour God</b> (the Father: compare “<i>through Jesus Christ</i>” below, and see note on ch. ii. 13)<b> was manifested</b> (viz. in Redemption, by the Incarnation and Satisfaction of the Redeemer);<b> not by virtue of</b> (<i>out of</i>, as the ground out of which an act springs.

For aught that this pluperfect would assert, our salvation might be prompted on God’s part by future works of righteousness which He foresaw we should do. Whereas the simple past tense throws the whole into the same time.— “His goodness, &c. was manifested... not for works which we did.-. He saved us,”—and renders the repudiation of human merit universal), but according to (after the measure of, in pursuance of, after the promptings of)<b> His compassion He saved us</b> (this saved us must be referred back to the definite objective act of God in Redemption, which has been above mentioned. On the part of God, that act is one—in the application of it to individuals, it is composed of many and successive acts. But this being contemporaneous with the verb appeared above, cannot apply to our individual salvation alone. At the same time, standing as it does in a transitional position, between God’s objective act and the subjective individual application of it, it no doubt looks forward as well as backward—to individual realization of salvation, as well as to the divine completion of it once for all in Christ.—The “<i>us</i>” here is not<i> all mankind</i>, which would be inconsistent with what follows,—nor<i> all Christians</i>, however true that would be,—but the same as are indicated by “<i>and we</i>” above,—the particular Christians in the Apostle’s view us he was writing—Titus and his Cretan converts, and himself),<b> by means of the laver</b> (not<i> ‘washing</i>,’ as A.V., which the word cannot mean by any possibility: but always a vessel, or pool in which washing takes place. Here, the baptismal font: see on Eph. v. 26)<b> of regeneration</b> (first, let us treat of this word. It occurs only in Matt. xix. 28, and there in an objective sense, whereas here it is evidently subjective. There it is the great second birth of heaven and earth in the latter days: here the second birth of the individual man. Though not occurring elsewhere in this sense, it has its cognate expressions. Then, of the<i> genitive</i>, of regeneration. ‘The font is the ‘laver of regeneration,’ because it is the vessel consecrated to the use of that Sacrament whereby, in its<i> completeness</i> as a Sacrament [see below], the new life unto God is conveyed. And inasmuch as it is in that font, and when we are in it, that the first breath of that life is drawn, it is the font of,—belonging to, pertaining to, setting forth,—regeneration.—Observe, there is here no figure: the words are literal: Baptism is taken as in all its completion,—the outward visible sign accompanied by the inward spiritual grace; and as thus complete, it not only represents, but is, the new birth. The font then, the laver of regeneration, representing the external portion of the Sacrament, and pledging the internal,—that<i> inward and spiritual grace</i>, necessary to the completion of the Sacrament and its regenerating power, is not, as too often, left to follow as a matter of course, and thus baptismal regeneration rendered a mere formal and unmeaning thing, ‘ex opere operato,’—but is distinctly stated in the following words),<b> and</b> (understand through again: so Theodoret and Bengel, who says, “Two things are spoken of: the laver of regeneration, which is a way of expressing baptism into Christ, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.” On the other hand, most Commentators [see Ellicott here] take<i> renewing</i> as a second genitive after<i> font</i> (of regeneration and of the renewing, &c.) the renewal (the word is used of the gradual renewal of heart and life in the image of God, following upon the new birth, and without which the birth is a mere abortion, not leading on to vitality and action.
