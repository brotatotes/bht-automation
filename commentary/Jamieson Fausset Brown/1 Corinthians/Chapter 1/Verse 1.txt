1. called to be—Found in some,
	not in others, of the oldest manuscripts Possibly inserted from  :-; but as likely to be genuine. Translate, literally, "a
	called apostle" [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON]. 
	through the will of God—not
	because of my own merit. Thus Paul's call as "an apostle by the
	will of God," while constituting the ground of the authority he
	claims in the Corinthian Church (compare  :-), is a reason for humility on his own part (1 Corinthians 15:8;
	1 Corinthians 15:10) [BENGEL].
	In assuming the ministerial office a man should see he does so not of
	his own impulse, but by the will of God (1 Corinthians 15:10- :); Paul if left to his own will would never have been an
	apostle (Romans 9:16). 
	Sosthenes—See my
	Romans 9:16- :. Associated by Paul
	with himself in the inscription, either in modesty, Sosthenes being
	his inferior [CHRYSOSTOM],
	or in order that the name of a "brother" of note in Corinth
	(Acts 18:17) might give weight
	to his Epistle and might show, in opposition to his detractors that
	he was supported by leading brethren. Gallio had driven the
	Jews who accused Paul from the judgment-seat. The Greek mob, who
	disliked Jews, took the opportunity then of beating Sosthenes the
	ruler of the Jewish synagogue, while Gallio looked on and refused to
	interfere, being secretly pleased that the mob should second his own
	contempt for the Jews. Paul probably at this time had showed sympathy
	for an adversary in distress, which issued in the conversion of the
	latter. So Crispus also, the previous chief ruler of the synagogue
	had been converted. Saul the persecutor turned into Paul the apostle,
	and Sosthenes the leader in persecution against that apostle, were
	two trophies of divine grace that, side by side, would appeal with
	double power to the Church at Corinth [BIRKS].
