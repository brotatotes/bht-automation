19. I will destroy—slightly
	altered from the Septuagint,  :-. The Hebrew is, "The wisdom of the wise shall
	perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid."
	Paul by inspiration gives the sense of the Spirit, by making GOD
	the cause of their wisdom perishing, &c., "I
	will destroy," &c. 
	understanding of the
	prudent—literally, "of the understanding ones."
