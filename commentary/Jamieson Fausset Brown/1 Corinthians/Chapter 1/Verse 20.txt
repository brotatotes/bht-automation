	"brings them to naught" ( :-). 
	the wise—generally.

	threefold character being the sole ground of glorying to His people.

	opposed to the Christian dispensation or order of things. The latter
	is the world viewed externally and cosmically.

	world's philosophy to be folly, because it lacks faith in Christ
	crucified [CHRYSOSTOM].

	saving men (1 Corinthians 1:26; 1 Corinthians 1:27)
