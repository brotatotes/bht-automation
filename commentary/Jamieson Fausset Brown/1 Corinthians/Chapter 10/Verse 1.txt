1. Moreover—The oldest
	manuscripts read "for." Thus the connection with the
	foregoing chapter is expressed. Ye need to exercise self-denying
	watchfulness notwithstanding all your privileges, lest ye be
	castaways. For the Israelites with all their privileges were most of
	them castaways through want of it.

	times the "all" is repeated, in the enumeration of the five
	favors which God bestowed on Israel ( :-). Five times, correspondingly, they sinned ( :-). In contrast to the "all" stands "many
	(rather, 'the most') of them" ( :-). All of them had great privileges, yet most
	of them were castaways through lust. Beware you, having greater
	privileges, of sharing the same doom through a similar sin.

	continually under the defense of the pillar of cloud, the
	symbol of the divine presence (Exodus 13:21;
	Exodus 13:22; Psalms 105:39;
