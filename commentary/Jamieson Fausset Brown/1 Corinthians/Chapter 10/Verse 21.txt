21. Ye cannot drink the cup of the
	Lord—really and spiritually; though ye may outwardly ( :-). 
	cup of devils—in
	contrast to the cup of the Lord. At idol feasts libations were
	usually made from the cup to the idol first, and then the guests
	drank; so that in drinking they had fellowship with the idol. 
	the Lord's table—The
	Lord's Supper is a feast on a table, not a sacrifice on an
	altar. Our only altar is the cross, our only sacrifice that of Christ
	once for all. The Lord's Supper stands, however, in the same
	relation, analogically, to Christ's sacrifice, as the Jews'
	sacrificial feasts did to their sacrifices (compare  :-, "altar . . . table of the Lord"), and the heathen
	idol feasts to their idolatrous sacrifices ( :-). The heathen sacrifices were offered to idol nonentities,
	behind which Satan lurked. The Jews' sacrifice was but a shadow of
	the substance which was to come. Our one sacrifice of Christ is the
	only substantial reality; therefore, while the partaker of the Jew's
	sacrificial feast partook rather "of the altar" ( :-) than of GOD
	manifested fully, and the heathen idol-feaster had fellowship really
	with demons, the communicant in the Lord's Supper has in it a real
	communion of, or fellowship in, the body of Christ once sacrificed,
	and now exalted as the Head of redeemed humanity.
