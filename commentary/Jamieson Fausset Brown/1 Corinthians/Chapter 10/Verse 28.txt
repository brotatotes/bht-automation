28. if any man—a weak
	Christian at table, wishing to warn his brother. 
	offered in sacrifice unto
	idols—The oldest manuscripts omit "unto idols." At a
	heathen's table the expression, offensive to him, would naturally be
	avoided. 
	for conscience' sake—not
	to cause a stumbling-block to the conscience of thy weak brother ( :-). 
	for the earth is the Lord's,
	&c.—not in the oldest manuscripts.
