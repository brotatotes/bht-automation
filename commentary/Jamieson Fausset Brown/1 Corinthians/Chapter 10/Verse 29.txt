29. Conscience . . . of the
	other—the weak brother introduced in  :-. 
	for why is my liberty judged
	off another man's conscience?—Paul passes to the first person,
	to teach his converts by putting himself as it were in their
	position. The Greek terms for "the other" and
	"another" are distinct. "The other" is the
	one with whom Paul's and his Corinthian converts' concern is;
	"another" is any other with whom he and they have
	no concern. If a guest know the meat to be idol meat while I know
	it not, I have "liberty" to eat without being condemned by
	his "conscience" [GROTIUS].
	Thus the "for," c., is an argument for  :-, "Eat, asking no questions." Or, Why should I
	give occasion by the rash use of my liberty that another should
	condemn it [ESTIUS], or
	that my liberty should cause the destruction of my weak brother?"
	[MENOCHIUS]. Or, the words
	are those of the Corinthian objector (perhaps used in their letter,
	and so quoted by Paul), "Why is my liberty judged by another's
	conscience?" Why should not I be judged only by my own, and have
	liberty to do whatever it sanctions? Paul replies in  :-, Your doing so ought always to be limited by regard to what
	most tends "to the glory of God" [VATABLUS,
	CONYBEARE and HOWSON].
	The first explanation is simplest the "for," c., in it
	refers to "not thine own" (that is, "not my
	own," in Paul's change to the first person) I am to abstain only
	in the case of liability to offend another's conscience; in
	cases where my own has no scruple, I am not bound, in God's
	judgment, by any other conscience than my own.
