3. same spiritual meatâ€”As the
	Israelites had the water from the rock, which answered to baptism,
	so they had the manna which corresponded to the other of the two
	Christian sacraments, the Lord's Supper. Paul plainly implies the
	importance which was attached to these two sacraments by all
	Christians in those days: "an inspired protest against those who
	lower their dignity, or deny their necessity" [ALFORD].
	Still he guards against the other extreme of thinking the mere
	external possession of such privileges will ensure salvation.
	Moreover, had there been seven sacraments, as Rome teaches, Paul
	would have alluded to them, whereas he refers to only the two. He
	does not mean by "the same" that the Israelites and we
	Christians have the "same" sacrament; but that
	believing and unbelieving Israelites alike had "the same"
	spiritual privilege of the manna (compare  :-). It was "spiritual meat" or food; because
	given by the power of God's spirit, not by human labor [GROTIUS
	and ALFORD]  :-, "born after the Spirit," that is, supernaturally.
	Psalms 78:24, "corn of
	heaven" (Psalms 105:40).
	Rather, "spiritual" in its typical signification,
	Christ, the true Bread of heaven, being signified (Psalms 105:40- :). Not that the Israelites clearly understood the
	signification; but believers among them would feel that in the type
	something more was meant; and their implicit and reverent, though
	indistinct, faith was counted to them for justification, of which the
	manna was a kind of sacramental seal. "They are not to be heard
	which feign that the old fathers did look only for transitory
	promises" [Article VII, Church of England], as appears from this
	passage (compare Hebrews 4:2).
