19. heresies—Not merely
	"schisms" or "divisions" ( :-), which are "recent dissensions of the
	congregation through differences of opinion" [AUGUSTINE,
	Con. Crescon. Don. 2.7, quoted by TRENCH,
	Greek Synonyms of the New Testament], but also "heresies,"
	that is, "schisms which have now become inveterate";
	"Sects" [CAMPBELL,
	vol. 2, pp. 126, 127]: so Acts 5:17;
	Acts 15:5 translate the same
	Greek. At present there were dissensions at the love-feasts;
	but Paul, remembering Jesus' words (Matthew 18:7;
	Matthew 24:10; Matthew 24:12;
	Luke 17:1) foresees "there
	must be (come) also" matured separations, and established
	parties in secession, as separatists. The "must be" arises
	from sin in professors necessarily bearing its natural fruits: these
	are overruled by God to the probation of character of both the godly
	and the ungodly, and to the discipline of the former for glory.
	"Heresies" had not yet its technical sense
	ecclesiastically, referring to doctrinal errors: it means confirmed
	schisms. ST.
	AUGUSTINE'S rule is a
	golden rule as regards questions of heresy and catholicity: "In
	doubtful questions, liberty; in essentials, unity; in all things,
	charity." 
	that . . . approved may be
	made manifest—through the disapproved (reprobates)
	becoming manifested (Luke 2:35;
	1 John 2:19).
