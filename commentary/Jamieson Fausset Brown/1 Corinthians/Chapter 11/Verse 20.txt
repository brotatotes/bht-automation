20. When . . . therefore—Resuming
	the thread of discourse from  :-. 
	this is not
	to—rather, "there is no such thing as eating the LORD'S
	Supper"; it is not possible where each is greedily intent
	only on devouring "HIS OWN
	supper," and some are excluded altogether, not having been
	waited for (1 Corinthians 11:33), where
	some are "drunken," while others are "hungry"
	(1 Corinthians 11:21). The love-feast
	usually preceded the Lord's Supper (as eating the Passover came
	before the Lord's Supper at the first institution of the latter). It
	was a club-feast, where each brought his portion, and the rich, extra
	portions for the poor; from it the bread and wine were taken for the
	Eucharist; and it was at it that the excesses took place, which made
	a true celebration of the Lord's Supper during or after it,
	with true discernment of its solemnity, out of the question.
