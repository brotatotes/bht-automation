27. eat and drinkâ€”So one of
	the oldest manuscripts reads. But three or four equally old
	manuscripts, the Vulgate and CYPRIAN,
	read, "or." Romanists quote this reading in favor of
	communion in one kind. This consequence does not follow. Paul says,
	"Whosoever is guilty of unworthy conduct, either in
	eating the bread, or in drinking the cup, is guilty of the
	body and blood of Christ." Impropriety in only one of the
	two elements, vitiates true communion in both. Therefore, in
	the end of the verse, he says, not "body or blood,"
	but "body and blood." Any who takes the bread without the
	wine, or the wine without the bread, "unworthily"
	communicates, and so "is guilty of Christ's body and blood";
	for he disobeys Christ's express command to partake of both. If we do
	not partake of the sacramental symbol of the Lord's death worthily,
	we share in the guilt of that death. (Compare "crucify to
	themselves the Son of God afresh,"  :-). Unworthiness in the person, is not what ought to
	exclude any, but unworthily communicating: However unworthy we
	be, if we examine ourselves so as to find that we penitently believe
	in Christ's Gospel, we may worthily communicate.
