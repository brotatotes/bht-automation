28. examine—Greek,
	"prove" or "test" his own state of mind in
	respect to Christ's death, and his capability of "discerning the
	Lord's body" (1 Corinthians 11:29;
	1 Corinthians 11:31). Not auricular
	confession to a priest, but self-examination is necessary. 
	so—after due
	self-examination. 
	of . . . of—In 1 Corinthians 11:31- :, where the receiving was unworthily, the expression
	was, "eat this bread, drink . . . cup" without "of."
	Here the "of" implies due circumspection in communicating
	[BENGEL]. 
	let him eat—His
	self-examination is not in order that he may stay away, but that he
	may eat, that is, communicate.
