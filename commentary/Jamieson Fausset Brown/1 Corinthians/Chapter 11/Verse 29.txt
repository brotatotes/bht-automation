29. damnation—A mistranslation
	which has put a stumbling-block in the way of many in respect to
	communicating. The right translation is "judgment." The
	judgment is described ( :-) as temporal. 
	not discerning—not
	duty judging: not distinguishing in judgment (so the Greek:
	the sin and its punishment thus being marked as corresponding) from
	common food, the sacramental pledges of the Lord's body. Most of the
	oldest manuscripts omit "Lord's" (see  :-). Omitting also "unworthily," with most of the
	oldest manuscripts, we must translate, "He that eateth and
	drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, IF he discern not
	the body" (Hebrews 10:29).
	The Church is "the body of Christ" (Hebrews 10:29- :). The Lord's body is His literal body appreciated
	and discerned by the soul in the faithful receiving, and not present
	in the elements themselves.
