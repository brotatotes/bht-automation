31. if we would judge ourselvesâ€”Most
	of the oldest manuscripts, read "But," not "For."
	Translate also literally "If we duly judged ourselves, we should
	not be (or not have been) judged," that is, we should
	escape (or have escaped) our present judgments. In order to
	duly judge or "discern [appreciate] the Lord's body,"
	we need to "duly judge ourselves." A prescient warning
	against the dogma of priestly absolution after full confession, as
	the necessary preliminary to receiving the Lord's Supper.
