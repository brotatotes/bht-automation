4. praying—in public ( :-). 
	prophesying—preaching
	in the Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:10). 
	having—that is, if he
	were to have: a supposed case to illustrate the impropriety in the
	woman's case. It was the Greek custom (and so that at Corinth)
	for men in worship to be uncovered; whereas the Jews wore the Talith,
	or veil, to show reverence before God, and their unworthiness to look
	on Him (Isaiah 6:2); however,
	MAIMONIDES [Mishna]
	excepts cases where (as in Greece) the custom of the place was
	different. 
	dishonoureth his head—not
	as ALFORD, "Christ"
	(1 Corinthians 11:3); but literally, as
	"his head" is used in the beginning of the verse. He
	dishonoreth his head (the principal part of the body) by wearing
	a covering or veil, which is a mark of subjection, and which makes
	him look downwards instead of upwards to his Spiritual Head, Christ,
	to whom alone he owes subjection. Why, then, ought not man to wear
	the covering in token of his subjection to Christ, as the woman wears
	it in token of her subjection to man? "Because Christ is not
	seen: the man is seen; so the covering of him who is under Christ is
	not seen; of her who is under the man, is seen" [BENGEL].
	(Compare 1 Corinthians 11:7).
