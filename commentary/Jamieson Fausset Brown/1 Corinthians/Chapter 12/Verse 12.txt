	uniformity, is the law of God in the world of grace, as in that of
	nature. As the many members of the body compose an organic whole and
	none can be dispensed with as needless, so those variously gifted by
	the Spirit, compose a spiritual organic whole, the body of Christ,
	into which all are baptized by the one Spirit. 
	of that one body—Most
	of the oldest manuscripts omit "one."

	Psalms 18:50, "His anointed
	(Messiah or Christ), David (the antitypical David) and His seed."
