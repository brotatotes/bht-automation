	that ye were—The best
	manuscripts read, "That WHEN
	ye were"; thus "ye were" must be supplied before
	"carried away"—Ye were blindly transported hither and

	these dumb idols—Greek,
	"the idols which are dumb"; contrasted with the
	living God who "speaks" in the believer by His Spirit ( :-, &c.). This gives the reason why the Corinthians needed
	instruction as to spiritual gifts, namely, their past heathen state,
	wherein they had no experience of intelligent spiritual powers. When
	blind, ye went to the dumb.
as ye were led—The
	Greek is, rather, "as ye might (happen to) be led,"
	namely, on different occasions. The heathen oracles led their
	votaries at random, without any definite principle.
