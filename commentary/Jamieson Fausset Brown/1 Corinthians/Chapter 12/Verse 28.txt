28. set . . . in the church—as
	He has "set the members . . . in the body" ( :-). 
	first apostles—above
	even the prophets. Not merely the Twelve, but others
	are so called, for example, Barnabas, c. ( :-). 
	teachers—who taught,
	for the most part, truths already revealed whereas the prophets
	made new revelations and spoke all their prophesyings under the
	Spirit's influence. As the teachers had the "word of knowledge,"
	so the prophets "the word of wisdom" ( :-). Under "teachers" are included "evangelists
	and pastors." 
	miracles—literally,
	"powers" (1 Corinthians 12:10):
	ranked below "teachers," as the function of teaching
	is more edifying, though less dazzling than working miracles. 
	helps, governments—lower
	and higher departments of "ministrations" (1 Corinthians 12:10- :); as instances of the former, deacons whose office it was to
	help in the relief of the poor, and in baptizing and
	preaching, subordinate to higher ministers (Acts 6:1-10;
	Acts 8:5-17); also, others
	who helped with their time and means, in the Lord's cause
	(compare 1 Corinthians 13:13; Numbers 11:17).
	The Americans similarly use "helps" for "helpers."
	And, as instances of the latter, presbyters, or bishops,
	whose office it was to govern the Church (1 Timothy 5:17;
	Hebrews 13:17; Hebrews 13:24).
	These officers, though now ordinary and permanent, were originally
	specially endowed with the Spirit for their office, whence they are
	here classified with other functions of an inspired character.
	Government (literally, "guiding the helm" of
	affairs), as being occupied with external things, notwithstanding the
	outward status it gives, is ranked by the Spirit with the lower
	functions. Compare "He that giveth" (answering to
	"helps")—"he that ruleth" (answering to
	"governments") (Romans 12:8).
	Translate, literally, "Helpings, governings" [ALFORD].
	diversities of tongues—
	(1 Corinthians 12:10). "Divers
	kinds of tongues."
