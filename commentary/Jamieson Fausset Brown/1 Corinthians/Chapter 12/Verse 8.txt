8-10. Three classes of gifts are
	distinguished by a distinct Greek word for "another"
	(a distinct class), marking the three several genera: allo
	marks the species, hetero the genera (compare Greek,
1 Corinthians 15:39-41). I.
	Gifts of intellect, namely, (1) wisdom; (2) knowledge. II. Gifts
	dependent on a special faith, namely, that of miracles (1 Corinthians 15:39-46.15.41- :): (1) healings; (2) workings of miracles; (3) prophecy of
	future events; (4) discerning of spirits, or the divinely given
	faculty of distinguishing between those really inspired, and those
	who pretended to inspiration. III. Gifts referring to the tongues:
	(1) diverse kinds of tongues; (2) interpretation of tongues. The
	catalogue in 1 Corinthians 12:28 is not
	meant strictly to harmonize with the one here, though there are some
	particulars in which they correspond. The three genera are summarily
	referred to by single instances of each in 1 Corinthians 12:28- :. The first genus refers more to believers; the second, to
	unbelievers. 
	by . . . by . . . by—The
	first in Greek is, "By means of," or "through
	the operation of"; the second is, "according to" the
	disposing of (compare 1 Corinthians 12:11);
	the third is, "in," that is, under the influence of
	(so the Greek, Matthew 22:43;
	Luke 2:27). 
	word of wisdom—the
	ready utterance of (for imparting to others, Luke 2:27- :) wisdom, namely, new revelations of the divine wisdom
	in redemption, as contrasted with human philosophy (1 Corinthians 1:24;
	1 Corinthians 2:6; 1 Corinthians 2:7;
	Ephesians 1:8; Ephesians 3:10;
	Colossians 2:3). 
	word of knowledge—ready
	utterance supernaturally imparted of truths ALREADY
	REVEALED (in this it is distinguished from "the word of
	wisdom," which related to NEW
	revelations). Compare 1 Corinthians 14:6,
	where "revelation" (answering to "wisdom" here)
	is distinguished from "knowledge" [HENDERSON].
	Wisdom or revelation belonged to the "prophets";
	knowledge, to the "teachers." Wisdom
	penetrates deeper than knowledge. Knowledge relates to things
	that are to be done. Wisdom, to things eternal: hence, wisdom
	is not, like knowledge, said to "pass away" (1 Corinthians 14:6- :), [BENGEL].
