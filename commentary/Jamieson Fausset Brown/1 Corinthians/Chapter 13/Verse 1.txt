	speak with the tongues—with
	the eloquence which was so much admired at Corinth (for example,
	Apollos, Acts 18:24 compare
	1 Corinthians 1:12; 1 Corinthians 3:21;
	1 Corinthians 3:22), and with the command
	of various languages, which some at Corinth abused to purposes of
	mere ostentation (1 Corinthians 14:2,
	&c.).

	of the ordinary and more important gifts of the Spirit, as contrasted
	with the extraordinary gifts (1 Corinthians 14:2- :). 
	sounding . . . tinkling—sound

cymbal—Two kinds are
	noticed (Psalms 150:5), the loud
	or clear, and the high-sounding one: hand cymbals and
	finger cymbals, or castanets. The sound is sharp and piercing.
