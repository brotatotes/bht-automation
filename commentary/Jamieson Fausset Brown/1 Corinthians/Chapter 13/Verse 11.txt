11. When . . . a child—
	(1 Corinthians 3:1; 1 Corinthians 14:20).
	I spake—alluding to
	"tongues." 
	understood—or, "had
	the sentiments of." Alluding to "prophecy." 
	I thought—Greek
	"reasoned" or "judged"; alluding to "knowledge."
	when I became . . . I put
	away—rather, "now that I am become a man, I have done away
	with the things of the child."
