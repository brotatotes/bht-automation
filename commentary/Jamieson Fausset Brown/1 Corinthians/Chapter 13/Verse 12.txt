12. now—in our present state. 
	see—an appropriate
	expression, in connection with the "prophets" of seers
	(1 Samuel 9:9). 
	through a glass—that
	is, in a mirror; the reflection seeming to the eye to be
	behind the mirror, so that we see it through the mirror.
	Ancient mirrors were made of polished brass or other metals. The
	contrast is between the inadequate knowledge of an object gained by
	seeing it reflected in a dim mirror (such as ancient mirrors were),
	compared with the perfect idea we have of it by seeing itself
	directly. 
	darkly—literally, "in
	enigma." As a "mirror" conveys an image to the eye,
	so an "enigma" to the ear. But neither "eye nor
	ear" can fully represent (though the believer's soul gets a
	small revelation now of) "the things which God hath prepared for
	them that love Him" (1 Corinthians 2:9).
	Paul alludes to Numbers 12:8, "not
	in dark speeches"; the Septuagint, "not in
	enigmas." Compared with the visions and dreams
	vouchsafed to other prophets, God's communications with Moses were
	"not in enigmas." But compared with the intuitive and
	direct vision of God hereafter, even the revealed word now is "a
	dark discourse," or a shadowing forth by enigma of God's
	reflected likeness. Compare Numbers 12:8- :, where the "light" or candle in a dark
	place stands in contrast with the "day" dawning. God's word
	is called a glass or mirror also in Numbers 12:8- :. 
	then—"when that
	which is perfect is come" (Numbers 12:8- :). 
	face to face—not merely
	"mouth to mouth" (Numbers 12:8- :). Genesis 32:30 was a type
	(John 1:50; John 1:51).
	know . . . known—rather
	as Greek, "fully know . . . fully known."
	Now we are known by, rather than know, God (1 Corinthians 8:3;
	Galatians 4:9).
