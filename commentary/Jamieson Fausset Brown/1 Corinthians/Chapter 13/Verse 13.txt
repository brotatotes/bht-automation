13. And now—Translate, "But
	now." "In this present state" [HENDERSON].
	Or, "now" does not express time, but opposition, as
	in 1 Corinthians 5:11, "the case
	being so" [GROTIUS];
	whereas it is the case that the three gifts,
	"prophecy," "tongues," and "knowledge"
	(cited as specimens of the whole class of gifts) "fail"
	(1 Corinthians 13:8), there abide
	permanently only these three—faith, hope, charity. In one
	sense faith and hope shall be done away, faith being
	superseded by sight, and hope by actual fruition (Romans 8:24;
	2 Corinthians 5:7); and charity, or love,
	alone never faileth (1 Corinthians 13:8).
	But in another sense, "faith and hope," as well as
	"charity," ABIDE;
	namely, after the extraordinary gifts have ceased; for those three
	are necessary and sufficient for salvation at all times,
	whereas the extraordinary gifts are not at all so; compare the use of
	"abide," 1 Corinthians 3:14.
	Charity, or love, is connected specially with the Holy Spirit,
	who is the bond of the loving union between the brethren (Romans 15:30;
	Colossians 1:8). Faith is towards
	God. Hope is in behalf of ourselves. Charity is love to
	God creating in us love towards our neighbor. In an unbeliever there
	is more or less of the three opposites—unbelief, despair, hatred.
	Even hereafter faith in the sense of trust in God
	"abideth"; also "hope," in relation to ever new
	joys in prospect, and at the anticipation of ever increasing
	blessedness, sure never to be disappointed. But love alone in every
	sense "abideth"; it is therefore "the greatest"
	of the three, as also because it presupposes "faith," which
	without "love" and its consequent "works" is dead
	(Galatians 5:6; James 2:17;
	James 2:20). 
	but—rather, "and";
	as there is not so strong opposition between charity and the other
	two, faith and hope, which like it also "abide."
