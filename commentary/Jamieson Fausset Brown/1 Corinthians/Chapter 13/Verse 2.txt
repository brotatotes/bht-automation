2. mysteries— (Romans 11:25;
	Romans 16:25). Mysteries
	refer to the deep counsels of God hitherto secret, but now revealed
	to His saints. Knowledge, to truths long known. 
	faith . . . remove mountains—
	(Matthew 17:20; Matthew 21:21).
	The practical power of the will elevated by faith [NEANDER];
	confidence in God that the miraculous result will surely follow the
	exercise of the will at the secret impulse of His Spirit. Without
	"love" prophecy, knowledge, and faith, are not what they
	seem (compare 1 Corinthians 8:1; 1 Corinthians 8:2;
	Matthew 7:22; James 2:14;
	compare 1 Corinthians 13:8), and so fail
	of the heavenly reward (Matthew 6:2).
	Thus Paul, who teaches justification by faith only (Romans 3:4;
	Romans 3:5; Galatians 2:16;
	Galatians 3:7-14), is shown to
	agree with James, who teaches (Galatians 3:7-48.3.14- :) "by works" (that is, by LOVE,
	which is the "spirit" of faith, Galatians 3:7-48.3.14- :) a man is justified, "and not by faith only."
