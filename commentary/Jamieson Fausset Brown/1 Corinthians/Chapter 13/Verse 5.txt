5. not . . . unseemly—is
	not uncourteous, or inattentive to civility and propriety. 
	thinketh no evil—imputeth
	not evil [ALFORD];
	literally, "the evil" which actually is there
	(Proverbs 10:12; 1 Peter 4:8).
	Love makes allowances for the falls of others, and is ready to put on
	them a charitable construction. Love, so far from devising evil
	against another, excuses "the evil" which another
	inflicts on her [ESTIUS];
	doth not meditate upon evil inflicted by another [BENGEL];
	and in doubtful cases, takes the more charitable view [GROTIUS].
