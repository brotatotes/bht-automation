1. Follow after charity—as
	your first and chief aim, seeing that it is "the greatest"
	(1 Corinthians 13:13). 
	and desire—Translate,
	"Yet (as a secondary aim) desire zealously (see on 1 Corinthians 13:13- :) spiritual gifts." 
	but rather—"but
	chiefly that ye may prophesy" (speak and exhort under
	inspiration) (Proverbs 29:18; Acts 13:1;
	1 Thessalonians 5:20), whether as to future
	events, that is, strict prophecy, or explaining obscure parts
	of Scripture, especially the prophetical Scriptures or illustrating
	and setting forth questions of Christian doctrine and practice. Our
	modern preaching is the successor of prophecy, but
	without the inspiration. Desire zealously this (prophecy) more
	than any other spiritual gift; or in preference to "tongues"
	(1 Corinthians 14:2, &c.) [BENGEL].
