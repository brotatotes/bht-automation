13. Explain, "Let him who
	speaketh with a tongue [unknown] in his prayer (or, when
	praying) strive that he may interpret" [ALFORD].
	This explanation of "pray" is needed by its logical
	connection with "prayer in an unknown tongue" ( :-). Though his words be unintelligible to his hearers, let
	him in them pray that he may obtain the gift of interpreting, which
	will make them "edifying" to "the church" ( :-).
