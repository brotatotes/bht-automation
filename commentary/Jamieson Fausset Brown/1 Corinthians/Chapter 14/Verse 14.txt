	the passive object of the Holy Spirit's operations, and the
	instrument of prayer in the unknown tongue, distinguished from the
	"understanding," the active instrument of thought
	and reasoning; which in this case must be "unfruitful" in
	edifying others, since the vehicle of expression is unintelligible to
	them. On the distinction of soul or mind and spirit,
	see Ephesians 4:23; Hebrews 4:12.
