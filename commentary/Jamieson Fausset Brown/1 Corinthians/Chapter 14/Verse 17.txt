17. givest thanks—The prayers
	of the synagogue were called "eulogies," because to each
	prayer was joined a thanksgiving. Hence the prayers of the
	Christian Church also were called blessings and giving of
	thanks. This illustrates Colossians 4:2;
	1 Thessalonians 5:17; 1 Thessalonians 5:18.
	So the Kaddisch and Keduscha, the synagogue formulæ of
	"hallowing" the divine "name" and of prayer for
	the "coming of God's kingdom," answer to the Church's
	Lord's Prayer, repeated often and made the foundation on which the
	other prayers are built [TERTULLIAN,
	Prayer].
