19. I had ratherâ€”The Greek
	verb more literally expresses this meaning, "I WISH
	to speak five words with my understanding (rather) than ten thousand
	words in an unknown tongue"; even the two thousandth part of ten
	thousand. The Greek for "I would rather," would be a
	different verb. Paul would NOT
	wish at all to speak "ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."
