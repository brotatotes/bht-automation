23. But every man in his own
	orderâ€”rather, "rank": the Greek is not in the
	abstract, but concrete: image from troops, "each in his own
	regiment." Though all shall rise again, let not any think all
	shall be saved; nay, each shall have his proper place, Christ first
	(Colossians 1:18), and after Him the
	godly who die in Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:16),
	in a separate band from the ungodly, and then "the end,"
	that is, the resurrection of the rest of the dead. Christian
	churches, ministers, and individuals seem about to be judged first
	"at His coming" (1 Thessalonians 4:16- :); then "all the nations" (1 Thessalonians 4:16- :). Christ's own flock shall share His glory "at His
	coming," which is not to be confounded with "the end,"
	or general judgment (Revelation 20:4-6;
	Revelation 20:11-15). The latter
	is not in this chapter specially discussed, but only the first
	resurrection, namely, that of the saints: not even the judgment of
	Christian hollow professors (Revelation 20:11-66.20.15- :) at His coming, is handled, but only the glory of them
	"that are Christ's," who alone in the highest sense "obtain
	the resurrection from the dead" (Luke 14:14;
	Luke 20:35; Luke 20:36;
	Philippians 3:11; see on Philippians 3:11- :). The second coming of Christ is not a mere point of
	time, but a period beginning with the resurrection of the just
	at His appearing, and ending with the general judgment. The ground of
	the universal resurrection is the union of all mankind in nature with
	Christ, their representative Head, who has done away with death, by
	His own death in their stead: the ground of the resurrection of
	believers is not merely this, but their personal union with Him as
	their "Life" (Philippians 3:11- :), effected causatively by the Holy Spirit, and
	instrumentally by faith as the subjective, and by
	ordinances as the objective means.
