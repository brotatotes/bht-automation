3. I delivered unto you—A
	short creed, or summary of articles of faith, was probably even then
	existing; and a profession in accordance with it was required of
	candidates for baptism (Acts 8:37).
	first of all—literally,
	"among the foremost points" (Acts 8:37- :). The atonement is, in Paul's view, of primary importance. 
	which I . . . received—from
	Christ Himself by special revelation (compare Acts 8:37- :). 
	died for our sins—that
	is, to atone FOR them; for
	taking away our sins (Acts 8:37- :; compare Galatians 1:4): "gave
	Himself for our sins" (Isaiah 53:5;
	2 Corinthians 5:15; Titus 2:14).
	The "for" here does not, as in some passages, imply
	vicarious substitution, but "in behalf of" (Hebrews 5:3;
	1 Peter 2:24). It does not, however,
	mean merely "on account of," which is expressed by a
	different Greek word (1 Peter 2:24- :), (though in English Version translated similarly,
	"for"). 
	according to the
	scriptures—which "cannot be broken." Paul puts the
	testimony of Scripture above that of those who saw the Lord
	after His resurrection [BENGEL].
	So our Lord quotes Isaiah 53:12,
	in Luke 22:37; compare Psalms 22:15;
	Daniel 9:26.
