31. by your rejoicing—by
	the glorying which I have concerning you, as the fruit of my
	labors in the Lord. Some of the earliest manuscripts and fathers read
	"our," with the same sense. BENGEL
	understands "your rejoicing," to be the enjoyable state
	of the Corinthians, as contrasted with his dying daily to give
	his converts rejoicing or glorying (1 Corinthians 4:8;
	2 Corinthians 4:12; 2 Corinthians 4:15;
	Ephesians 3:13; Philippians 1:26).
	But the words, "which I have," favor the explanation—"the
	rejoicing which I have over you." Many of the oldest
	manuscripts and Vulgate insert "brethren" here. 
	I die daily—This ought
	to stand first in the sentence, as it is so put prominently forward
	in the Greek. I am day by day in sight of death, exposed to
	it, and expecting it (2 Corinthians 4:11;
	2 Corinthians 4:12; 2 Corinthians 1:8;
	2 Corinthians 1:9; 2 Corinthians 11:23).
