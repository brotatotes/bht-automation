43. in dishonour—answering to
	"our vile body" ( :-); literally, "our body of humiliation": liable to
	various humiliations of disease, injury, and decay at last. 
	in glory—the garment of
	incorruption (1 Corinthians 15:42; 1 Corinthians 15:43)
	like His glorious body (Philippians 4:21),
	which we shall put on (1 Corinthians 15:49;
	1 Corinthians 15:53; 2 Corinthians 5:2-4).
	in weakness—liable to
	infirmities (2 Corinthians 13:4). 
	in power—answering to a
	"spiritual body" (2 Corinthians 13:4- :; compare Luke 1:17,
	"Spirit and power"). Not liable to the weaknesses of our
	present frail bodies (Isaiah 33:24;
	Revelation 21:4).
