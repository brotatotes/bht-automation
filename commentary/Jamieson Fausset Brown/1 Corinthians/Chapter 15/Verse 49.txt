49. as—Greek, "even
	as" (see Genesis 5:3). 
	we shall also bear—or
	wear as a garment [BENGEL].
	The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "We must also bear,"
	or "let us also bear." It implies the divine appointment
	(compare "must," Genesis 5:3- :) and faith assenting to it. An exhortation, and yet
	implying a promise (so Romans 8:29).
	The conformity to the image of the heavenly Representative man is to
	be begun here in our souls, in part, and shall be perfected at the
	resurrection in both bodies and souls.
