51. Behold—Calling attention
	to the "mystery" heretofore hidden in God's purposes, but
	now revealed. 
	you—emphatical in the
	Greek; I show (Greek, "tell," namely, by
	the word of the Lord, 1 Thessalonians 4:15)
	YOU, who think you have so
	much knowledge, "a mystery" (compare 1 Thessalonians 4:15- :) which your reason could never have discovered. Many of the
	old manuscripts and Fathers read, "We shall all sleep, but we
	shall not all be changed"; but this is plainly a corrupt
	reading, inconsistent with 1 Thessalonians 4:15;
	1 Thessalonians 4:17, and with the apostle's
	argument here, which is that a change is necessary (1 Thessalonians 4:17- :). English Version is supported by some of the oldest
	manuscripts and Fathers. The Greek is literally "We all
	shall not sleep, but," c. The putting off of the corruptible
	body for an incorruptible by an instantaneous change will, in
	the case of "the quick," stand as equivalent to death,
	appointed to all men (Hebrews 9:27)
	of this Enoch and Elijah are types and forerunners. The "we"
	implies that Christians in that age and every successive age since
	and hereafter were designed to stand waiting, as if Christ might come
	again in their time, and as if they might be found among "the
	quick."
