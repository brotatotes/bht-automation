55. Quoted from  :-, substantially; but freely used by the warrant of the
	Spirit by which Paul wrote. The Hebrew may be translated, "O
	death, where are thy plagues? Where, O Hades, is thy destruction?"
	The Septuagint, "Where is thy victory (literally, in a
	lawsuit), O death? Where is thy sting, O Hades? . . . Sting"
	answers to the Hebrew "plagues," namely, a poisoned
	sting causing plagues. Appropriate, as to the old
	serpent (Genesis 3:14; Genesis 3:15;
	Numbers 21:6). "Victory"
	answers to the Hebrew "destruction." Compare Numbers 21:6- :, "destroy . . . veil . . . over all nations,"
	namely, victoriously destroy it; and to "in victory"
	(1 Corinthians 15:54), which he
	triumphantly repeats. The "where" implies their past
	victorious destroying power and sting, now gone for ever; obtained
	through Satan's triumph over man in Eden, which enlisted God's law on
	the side of Satan and death against man (Romans 5:12;
	Romans 5:17; Romans 5:21).
	The souls in Hades being freed by the resurrection, death's sting and
	victory are gone. For "O grave," the oldest manuscripts and
	versions read, "O death," the second time.
