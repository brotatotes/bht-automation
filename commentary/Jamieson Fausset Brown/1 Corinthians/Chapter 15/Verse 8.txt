8. One born out of due timeâ€”Greek,
	"the one abortively born": the abortion in the family of
	the apostles. As a child born before the due time is puny, and
	though born alive, yet not of the proper size, and scarcely worthy of
	the name of man, so "I am the least of the apostles,"
	scarcely "meet to be called an apostle"; a supernumerary
	taken into the college of apostles out of regular course, not led to
	Christ by long instruction, like a natural birth, but by a sudden
	power, as those prematurely born [GROTIUS].
	Compare the similar image from childbirth, and by the same spiritual
	power, the resurrection of Christ ( :-). "Begotten again by the resurrection of
	Jesus." Jesus' appearance to Paul, on the way to Damascus, is
	the one here referred to.
