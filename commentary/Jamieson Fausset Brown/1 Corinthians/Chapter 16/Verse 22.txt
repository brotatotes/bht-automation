22. A solemn closing warning
	added in his own hand as in Ephesians 6:24;
	Colossians 4:18. 
	the Lord—who ought to
	be "loved" above Paul, Apollos, and all other teachers.
	Love to one another is to be in connection with love to Him above
	all. IGNATIUS [Epistle
	to the Romans, 7] writes of Christ, "My love, has been
	crucified" (compare Song of Solomon 2:7).
	Jesus Christ—omitted in
	the oldest manuscripts. 
	let him be Anathema—accursed
	with that curse which the Jews who call Jesus "accursed"
	(1 Corinthians 12:3) are bringing
	righteously on their own heads [BENGEL].
	So far from "saluting" him, I bid him be accursed.
Maranatha—Syriac
	for, "the Lord cometh." A motto or watchword to urge them
	to preparedness for the Lord's coming; as in 1 Corinthians 12:3- :, "The Lord is at hand."
