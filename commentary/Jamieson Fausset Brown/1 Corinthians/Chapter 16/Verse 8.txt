8. at Ephesus—whence Paul
	writes this Epistle. Compare  :-, "Asia," wherein Ephesus was. 
	until Pentecost—He
	seems to have stayed as he here purposes: for just when the tumult
	which drove him away broke out, he was already intending to leave
	Ephesus (Acts 19:21; Acts 19:22).
	Combined with 1 Corinthians 5:7; 1 Corinthians 5:8,
	this verse fixes the date of this Epistle to a few weeks before
	Pentecost, and very soon after the Passover.
