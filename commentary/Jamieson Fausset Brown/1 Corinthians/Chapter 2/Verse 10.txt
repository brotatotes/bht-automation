10. revealed . . . by . . .
	Spirit—The inspiration of thoughts (so far as truth essential
	to salvation is concerned) makes the Christian (1 Corinthians 3:16;
	1 Corinthians 12:3; Matthew 16:17;
	John 16:13; 1 John 2:20;
	1 John 2:27); that of words,
	the PROPHET (2 Samuel 23:1;
	2 Samuel 23:2; 1 Kings 13:1;
	1 Kings 13:5), "by the word
	of the Lord" (1 Corinthians 2:13;
	John 20:30; John 20:31;
	2 Peter 1:21). The secrets of
	revelation are secret to some, not because those who know them will
	not reveal them (for indeed, the very notion of revelation
	implies an unveiling of what had been veiled), but because those to
	whom they are announced have not the will or power to comprehend
	them. Hence the Spirit-taught alone know these secrets (Psalms 25:14;
	Proverbs 3:32; John 7:17;
	John 15:15). 
	unto us—the "perfect"
	or fully matured in Christian experience (John 15:15- :). Intelligent men may understand the outline of doctrines;
	but without the Holy Spirit's revelation to the heart, these will be
	to them a mere outline—a skeleton, correct perhaps, but wanting
	life [WHATLEY, Cautions
	for the Times, 14], (John 15:15- :). 
	the Spirit searcheth—working
	in us and with our spirits (compare Romans 8:16;
	Romans 8:26; Romans 8:27).
	The Old Testament shows us God (the Father) for us. The Gospels, God
	(the Son) with us. The Acts and Epistles, God (the Holy Ghost) in us
	[MONOD], (Romans 8:27- :). 
	deep things of God— (Romans 8:27- :). His divine nature, attributes, and counsels. The Spirit
	delights to explore the infinite depths of His own divine mind, and
	then reveal them to us, according as we are capable of understanding
	them (Deuteronomy 29:29). This proves
	the personality and Godhead of the Holy Ghost. Godhead cannot be
	separated from the Spirit of God, as manhood cannot be separated from
	the Spirit of man [BENGEL].
