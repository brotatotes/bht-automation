	order to judge the spiritual man, the ordinary man must "know
	the mind of the Lord." But "who of ordinary men knows"
	that? 
	that he may instruct him—that
	is, so as to be able to set Him right as His counsellor (quoted from
	Isaiah 40:13; Isaiah 40:14).
	So the Septuagint translates the Greek verb, which
	means to "prove," in Isaiah 40:14- :. Natural men who judge spiritual men, living according to
	the mind of God ("We have the mind of Christ"), are
	virtually wishing to instruct God, and bring Him to another mind, as
	counsellors setting to right their king. 
	we have the mind of Christ—in
	our degree of capability to apprehend it. Isaiah 40:13;
	Isaiah 40:14 refers to JEHOVAH:
	therefore, as it is applied here to Christ, He is Jehovah.
