3. I—the preacher: as
	1 Corinthians 2:2 describes the subject,
	"Christ crucified," and 1 Corinthians 2:2- : the mode of preaching: "my speech . . . not with
	enticing words," "but in demonstration of the Spirit."
	weakness—personal and
	bodily (2 Corinthians 10:10; 2 Corinthians 12:7;
	2 Corinthians 12:9; Galatians 4:13).
	trembling—(compare Galatians 4:13- :). Not personal fear, but a trembling anxiety to
	perform a duty; anxious conscientiousness, as proved by the
	contrast to "eye service" (Galatians 4:13- :) [CONYBEARE and
	HOWSON].
