12. Nowâ€”rather, "But."
	The image is that of a building on a solid foundation, and partly
	composed of durable and precious, partly of perishable, materials.
	The "gold, silver, precious stones," which all can
	withstand fire (Revelation 21:18;
	Revelation 21:19), are teachings
	that will stand the fiery test of judgment; "wood, hay,
	stubble," are those which cannot stand it; not positive heresy,
	for that would destroy the foundation, but teaching mixed up with
	human philosophy and Judaism, curious rather than useful. Besides the
	teachings, the superstructure represents also the persons
	cemented to the Church by them, the reality of whose conversion,
	through the teachers' instrumentality, will be tested at the last
	day. Where there is the least grain of real gold of faith, it shall
	never be lost (1 Peter 1:7; compare
	1 Corinthians 4:12). On the other hand,
	the lightest straw feeds the fire [BENGEL]
	(Matthew 5:19).
