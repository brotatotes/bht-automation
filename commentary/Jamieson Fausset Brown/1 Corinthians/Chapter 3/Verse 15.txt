15. If . . . be burnt—if any
	teacher's work consist of such materials as the fire will
	destroy [ALFORD]. 
	suffer loss—that is,
	forfeit the special "reward"; not that he shall lose
	salvation (which is altogether a free gift, not a "reward"
	or wages), for he remains still on the foundation (1 Corinthians 3:12;
	2 John 1:6). 
	saved; yet so as by
	fire—rather, "so as through fire" (Zechariah 3:2;
	Amos 4:11; Judges 1:23).
	"Saved, yet not without fire" (Judges 1:23- :) [BENGEL]. As a
	builder whose building, not the foundation, is consumed by fire,
	escapes, but with the loss of his work [ALFORD];
	as the shipwrecked merchant, though he has lost his merchandise, is
	saved, though having to pass through the waves [BENGEL];
	Malachi 3:1; Malachi 3:2;
	Malachi 4:1, give the key to explain
	the imagery. The "Lord suddenly coming to His temple" in
	flaming "fire," all the parts of the building which will
	not stand that fire will be consumed; the builders will escape with
	personal salvation, but with the loss of their work, through the
	midst of the conflagration [ALFORD].
	Again, a distinction is recognized between minor and fundamental
	doctrines (if we regard the superstructure as representing the
	doctrines superadded to the elementary essentials); a man may
	err as to the former, and yet be saved, but not so as to the latter
	(compare Philippians 3:15).
