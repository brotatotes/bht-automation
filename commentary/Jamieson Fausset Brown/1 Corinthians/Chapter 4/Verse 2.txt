2. Moreoverâ€”The oldest
	manuscripts read, "Moreover here" (that is, on earth). The
	contrast thus is between man's usage as to stewards ( :-), and God's way (1 Corinthians 4:3).
	Though here below, in the case of stewards, inquiry is
	made, that one man be found (that is, proved to be) faithful; yet
	God's steward awaits no such judgment of man, in man's day,
	but the Lord's judgment in His great day. Another argument against
	the Corinthians for their partial preferences of certain teachers for
	their gifts: whereas what God requires in His stewards is
	faithfulness (1 Samuel 3:20,
	Margin; Hebrews 3:5); as
	indeed is required in earthly stewards, but with this difference (Hebrews 3:5- :), that God's stewards await not man's judgment to test them,
	but the testing which shall be in the day of the Lord.
