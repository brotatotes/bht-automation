20. kingdom of God is not in
	wordâ€”Translate, as in  :-, to which the reference is "speech." Not empty
	"speeches," but the manifest "power" of the
	Spirit attests the presence of "the kingdom of God" (the
	reign of the Gospel spiritually), in a church or in an
	individual (compare 1 Corinthians 2:1;
	1 Corinthians 2:4; 1 Thessalonians 1:5).
