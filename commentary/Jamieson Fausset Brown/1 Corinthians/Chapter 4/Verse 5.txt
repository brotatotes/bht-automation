5. Disproving the judicial power
	claimed by the Romish priesthood in the confessional. 
	Therefore—as the Lord
	is the sole Decider or Dijudicator. 
	judge—not the same
	Greek word as in 1 Corinthians 4:3;
	1 Corinthians 4:4, where the meaning is to
	approve of or decide on, the merits of one's case. Here
	all judgments in general are forbidden, which would, on our
	part, presumptuously forestall God's prerogative of final judgment.
Lord—Jesus Christ,
	whose "ministers" we are (1 Corinthians 4:4- :), and who is to be the judge (John 5:22;
	John 5:27; Acts 10:42;
	Acts 17:31). 
	manifest . . . hearts—Our
	judgments now (as those of the Corinthians respecting their teachers)
	are necessarily defective; as we only see the outward act, we
	cannot see the motives of "hearts." "Faithfulness"
	(1 Corinthians 4:2) will hereby be
	estimated, and the "Lord" will "justify," or the
	reverse (1 Corinthians 4:4), according to
	the state of the heart.
then shall every man have
	praise— (1 Corinthians 3:8; 1 Samuel 26:23;
	Matthew 25:21; Matthew 25:23;
	Matthew 25:28). Rather, "his
	due praise," not exaggerated praise, such as the Corinthians
	heaped on favorite teachers; "the praise" (so the Greek)
	due for acts estimated by the motives. "Then," not before:
	therefore wait till then (Matthew 25:28- :).
