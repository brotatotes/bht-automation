1. commonly—rather, "actually"
	[ALFORD]. Absolutely
	[BENGEL]. "It is
	reported," implies, that the Corinthians, though they "wrote"
	(1 Corinthians 7:1) to Paul on other
	points, gave him no information on those things which bore against
	themselves. These latter matters reached the apostle indirectly (1 Corinthians 7:1- :). 
	so much as named—The
	oldest manuscripts and authorities omit "named":
	"Fornication of such a gross kind as (exists) not even among the
	heathen, so that one (of you) hath (in concubinage) his father's
	wife," that is, his stepmother, while his father is still alive
	(2 Corinthians 7:12; compare 2 Corinthians 7:12- :). She was perhaps a heathen, for which reason he does not
	direct his rebuke against her (compare 1 Corinthians 5:12;
	1 Corinthians 5:13). ALFORD
	thinks "have" means have in marriage: but the
	connection is called "fornication," and neither Christian
	nor Gentile law would have sanctioned such a marriage,
	however Corinth's notorious profligacy might wink at the concubinage.
