10. Limitation of the
	prohibition alluded to in 1 Corinthians 5:9.
	As in dissolute Corinth to "company with no fornicators,"
	c., would be almost to company with none in the (unbelieving) world
	ye need not utterly ("altogether") forego
	intercourse with fornicators, c., of the unbelieving world (compare
	1 Corinthians 10:27 John 17:15;
	1 John 5:18; 1 John 5:19).
	As "fornicators" sin against themselves, so "extortioners"
	against their neighbors, and "idolaters" against God. The
	attempt to get "out of the world," in violation of God's
	will that believers should remain in it but keep themselves from its
	evil, led to monasticism and its consequent evils.
