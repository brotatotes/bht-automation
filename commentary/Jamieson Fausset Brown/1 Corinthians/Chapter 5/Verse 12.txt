12. what have I to do—You
	might have easily understood that my concern is not with unbelievers
	outside the Church, but that I referred to those within it. 
	also—Implying, Those
	within give me enough to do without those outside. 
	do not ye, &c.—Ye
	judge your fellow citizens, not strangers: much more should I
	[BENGEL]. Rather, Is it
	not your duty to judge them that are within? God shall
	judge them that are without: do you look at home [GROTIUS].
	God is the Judge of the salvation of the heathen, not we ( :-). Paul here gives an anticipatory censure of their going
	to law with saints before heathen tribunals, instead of judging such
	causes among themselves within.
