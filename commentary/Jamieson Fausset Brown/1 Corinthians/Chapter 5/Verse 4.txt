4. In the name of our Lord Jesus
	Christâ€”By His authority and as representing His person
	and will (2 Corinthians 2:10). Join this
	with "to deliver such a one unto Satan" (2 Corinthians 2:10- :). The clause, "When ye have been gathered together and
	my spirit (wherein I am 'present,' though 'absent in body,' 2 Corinthians 2:10- :), with the power of our Lord Jesus," stands in a
	parenthesis between. Paul speaking of himself uses the word "spirit";
	of Christ, "power." Christ's power was promised to be
	present with HIS Church
	"gathered together in His name" (2 Corinthians 2:10- :): and here Paul by inspiration gives a special promise
	of his apostolic spirit, which in such cases was guided by the Holy
	Spirit, ratifying their decree passed according to his judgment
	("I have judged," 2 Corinthians 2:10- :), as though he were present in person (John 20:21-23;
	2 Corinthians 13:3-10). This power of
	infallible judgment was limited to the apostles; for they alone had
	the power of working miracles as their credentials to attest their
	infallibility. Their successors, to establish their claim to the
	latter, must produce the former (2 Corinthians 13:3-47.13.10- :). Even the apostles in ordinary cases, and where not
	specially and consciously inspired, were fallible (Acts 8:13;
	Acts 8:23; Galatians 2:11-14).
