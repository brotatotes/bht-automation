5. Besides excommunication (of
	which the Corinthians themselves had the power), Paul delegates here
	to the Corinthian Church his own special power as an apostle,
	of inflicting corporeal disease or death in punishment for sin ("to
	deliver to Satan such an one," that is, so heinous a sinner).
	For instances of this power, see Acts 5:1-11;
	Acts 13:11; 1 Timothy 1:20.
	As Satan receives power at times to try the godly, as Job (1 Timothy 1:20- :) and Paul (2 Corinthians 12:7;
	compare also as to Peter, 2 Corinthians 12:7- :), much more the ungodly. Satan, the "accuser of the
	brethren" (Revelation 12:10) and
	the "adversary" (1 Peter 5:8),
	demands the sinner for punishment on account of sin (1 Peter 5:8- :). When God lets Satan have his way, He is said to "deliver
	the sinner unto Satan" (compare 1 Peter 5:8- :). Here it is not finally; but for the affliction of the
	body with disease, and even death (1 Corinthians 11:30;
	1 Corinthians 11:32), so as to destroy
	fleshly lust. He does not say, "for the destruction of the
	body," for it shall share in redemption (1 Corinthians 11:32- :); but of the corrupt "flesh" which "cannot
	inherit the kingdom of God," and the lusts of which had prompted
	this offender to incest (Romans 7:5;
	Romans 8:9; Romans 8:10).
	The "destruction of the flesh" answers to "mortify
	the deeds of the body" (Romans 8:10- :), only that the latter is done by one's self, the former is
	effected by chastisement from God (compare Romans 8:10- :): 
	the spirit . . . savedâ€”the
	spiritual part of man, in the believer the organ of the Holy Spirit.
	Temporary affliction often leads to permanent salvation (Romans 8:10- :).
