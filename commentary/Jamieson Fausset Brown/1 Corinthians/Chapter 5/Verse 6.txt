6. Your glorying in your own
	attainments and those of your favorite teachers (1 Corinthians 3:21;
	1 Corinthians 4:19; 1 Corinthians 5:2),
	while all the while ye connive at such a scandal, is quite unseemly. 
	a little leaven leaveth . . .
	whole lumpâ€” (Galatians 5:9),
	namely, with present complicity in the guilt, and the danger
	of future contagion (1 Corinthians 15:33;
	2 Timothy 2:17).
