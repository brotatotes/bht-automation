9. I wrote . . . in an
	epistleâ€”rather, "in the Epistle": a former one not
	now extant. That Paul does not refer to the present letter is
	proved by the fact that no direction "not to company with
	fornicators" occurs in the previous part of it; also the words,
	"in an (or, the) epistle," could not have been added
	if he meant, "I have just written" ( :-). "His letters" (plural; not
	applying to merely one) confirm this.  :- also refers to our first Epistle, just as here a
	former letter is referred to by the same phrase. Paul probably
	wrote a former brief reply to inquiries of the Corinthians: our
	first Epistle, as it enters more fully into the same subject, has
	superseded the former, which the Holy Spirit did not design for the
	guidance of the Church in general, and which therefore has not been
	preserved. See my  :-.
