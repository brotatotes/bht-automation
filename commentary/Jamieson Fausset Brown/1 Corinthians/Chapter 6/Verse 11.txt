11. ye are washed—The Greek
	middle voice expresses, "Ye have had yourselves washed."
	This washing implies the admission to the benefits of Christ's
	salvation generally; of which the parts are; (1) Sanctification,
	or the setting apart from the world, and adoption into the Church: so
	"sanctified" is used 1 Corinthians 7:14;
	John 17:19. Compare John 17:19- :, where it rather seems to mean the setting apart of
	one as consecrated by the Spirit in the eternal purpose God.
	(2) Justification from condemnation through the righteousness
	of God in Christ by faith (John 17:19- :). So PARÆUS. The
	order of sanctification before justification shows that
	it must be so taken, and not in the sense of progressive
	sanctification. "Washed" precedes both, and so must refer
	to the Christian's outward new birth of water, the sign of the inward
	setting apart to the Lord by the inspiration of the Spirit as the
	seed of new life (John 3:5;
	Ephesians 5:26; Titus 3:5;
	Hebrews 10:22). Paul (compare the
	Church of England Baptismal Service), in charity, and faith in the
	ideal of the Church, presumes that baptism realizes its original
	design, and that those outwardly baptized inwardly enter into vital
	communion with Christ (Galatians 3:27).
	He presents the grand ideal which those alone realized in whom the
	inward and the outward baptism coalesced. At the same time he
	recognizes the fact that this in many cases does not hold good (Galatians 3:27- :), leaving it to God to decide who are the really "washed,"
	while he only decides on broad general principles. 
	in the name of . . . Jesus,
	and by the Spirit—rather, "in the Spirit," that is,
	by His in-dwelling. Both clauses belong to the three—"washed,
	sanctified, justified." 
	our God—The "our"
	reminds the that amidst all his reproofs God is still the common God
	of himself and them. 
	Galatians 3:27- :. REFUTATION OF THE
	ANTINOMIAN DEFENSE
	OF FORNICATION AS IF
	IT WAS
	LAWFUL BECAUSE
	MEATS ARE
	SO.
