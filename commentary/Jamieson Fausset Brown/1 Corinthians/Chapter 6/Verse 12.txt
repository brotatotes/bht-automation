12. All things are lawful unto
	me—These, which were Paul's own words on a former occasion (to
	the Corinthians, compare 1 Corinthians 10:23;
	Galatians 5:23), were made a pretext
	for excusing the eating of meats offered to idols, and so of what was
	generally connected with idolatry (Galatians 5:23- :), "fornication" (perhaps in the letter of the
	Corinthians to Paul, 1 Corinthians 7:1).
	Paul's remark had referred only to things indifferent: but
	they wished to treat fornication as such, on the ground that the
	existence of bodily appetites proved the lawfulness of their
	gratification. 
	me—Paul giving himself
	as a sample of Christians in general. 
	but I—whatever others
	do, I will not, c. 
	lawful . . . brought under
	the power—The Greek words are from the same root, whence
	there is a play on the words: All things are in my power,
	but I will not be brought under the power of any of them (the
	"all things"). He who commits "fornication,"
	steps aside from his own legitimate power or liberty, and is "brought
	under the power" of an harlot (1 Corinthians 7:1- : compare 1 Corinthians 7:4). The
	"power" ought to be in the hands of the believer,
	not in the things which he uses [BENGEL];
	else his liberty is forfeited; he ceases to be his own master
	(John 8:34-36; Galatians 5:13;
	1 Peter 2:16; 2 Peter 2:19).
	Unlawful things ruin thousands; "lawful" things (unlawfully
	used), ten thousands.
