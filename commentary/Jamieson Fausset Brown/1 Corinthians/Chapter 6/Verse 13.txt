13. The argument drawn from the
	indifference of meats (1 Corinthians 8:8;
	Romans 14:14; Romans 14:17;
	compare Mark 7:18; Colossians 2:20-22)
	to that of fornication does not hold good. Meats doubtless are
	indifferent, since both they and the "belly" for which they
	are created are to be "destroyed" in the future state. But
	"the body is not (created) for fornication, but for the Lord;
	and the Lord for the body" (as its Redeemer, who hath Himself
	assumed the body): "And God hath raised up the Lord, and will
	also raise up us" (that is our bodies): therefore the "body"
	is not, like the "belly," after having served a temporary
	use, to be destroyed: Now "he that committeth fornication,
	sinneth against his own body" (Colossians 2:20-51.2.22- :). Therefore fornication is not indifferent, since it is a
	sin against one's own body, which, like the Lord for whom it is
	created, is not to be destroyed, but to be raised to eternal
	existence. Thus Paul gives here the germ of the three subjects
	handled in subsequent sections: (1) The relation between the sexes.
	(2) The question of meats offered to idols. (3) The resurrection of
	the body. 
	shall destroyâ€”at the
	Lord's coming to change the natural bodies of believers into
	spiritual bodies (1 Corinthians 15:44;
	1 Corinthians 15:52). There is a real
	essence underlying the superficial phenomena of the present temporary
	organization of the body, and this essential germ, when all the
	particles are scattered, involves the future resurrection of the body
	incorruptible.
