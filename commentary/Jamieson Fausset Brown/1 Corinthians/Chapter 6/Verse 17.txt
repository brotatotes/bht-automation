17. one spiritâ€”with Him. In
	the case of union with a harlot, the fornicator becomes one "body"
	with her (not one "spirit," for the spirit which is
	normally the organ of the Holy Spirit in man, is in the carnal so
	overlaid with what is sensual that it is ignored altogether). But the
	believer not only has his body sanctified by union with Christ's
	body, but also becomes "one spirit" with Him (John 15:1-7;
	John 17:21; 2 Peter 1:4;
	compare Ephesians 5:23-32;
	John 3:6).
