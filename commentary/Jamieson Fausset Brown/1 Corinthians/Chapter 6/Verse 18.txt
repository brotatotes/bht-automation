18. Flee—The only safety in
	such temptations is flight (Genesis 39:12;
	Job 31:1). 
	Every sin—The Greek
	is forcible. "Every sin whatsoever that a man doeth."
	Every other sin; even gluttony, drunkenness, and self-murder
	are "without," that is, comparatively external to the body
	(Mark 7:18; compare Mark 7:18- :). He certainly injures, but he does not alienate the body
	itself; the sin is not terminated in the body; he rather sins against
	the perishing accidents of the body (as the "belly," and
	the body's present temporary organization), and against the soul than
	against the body in its permanent essence, designed "for the
	Lord." "But" the fornicator alienates that body which
	is the Lord's, and makes it one with a harlot's body, and so "sinneth
	against his own body," that is, against the verity and
	nature of his body; not a mere effect on the body from
	without, but a contradiction of the truth of the body, wrought
	within itself [ALFORD].
