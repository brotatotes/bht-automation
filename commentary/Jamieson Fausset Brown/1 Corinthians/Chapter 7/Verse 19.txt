19. Circumcision . . . nothing, but
	. . . keeping of . . . commandments of Godâ€”namely, is all in
	all. In Galatians 5:6 this "keeping
	of the commandments of God" is defined to be "faith which
	worketh by love"; and in Galatians 5:6- :, "a new creature." Circumcision was a commandment
	of God: but not for ever, as "love."
