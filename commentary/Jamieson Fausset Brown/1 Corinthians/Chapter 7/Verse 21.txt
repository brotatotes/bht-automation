21. care not for it—Let it not
	be a trouble to thee that thou art a servant or slave. 
	use it rather—Continue
	rather in thy state as a servant (1 Corinthians 7:20;
	Galatians 3:28; 1 Timothy 6:2).
	The Greek, "But if even thou mayest be made free,
	use it," and the context (1 Corinthians 7:20;
	1 Corinthians 7:22) favors this view
	[CHRYSOSTOM, BENGEL,
	and ALFORD]. This advice
	(if this translation be right) is not absolute, as the spirit of the
	Gospel is against slavery. What is advised here is, contentment under
	one's existing condition (1 Corinthians 7:22- :), though an undesirable one, since in our union with Christ
	all outward disparities of condition are compensated (1 Corinthians 7:22- :). Be not unduly impatient to cast off "even"
	thy condition as a servant by unlawful means (1 Corinthians 7:22- :); as, for example, Onesimus did by fleeing (1 Corinthians 7:22- :). The precept (1 Corinthians 7:23),
	"Become not (so the Greek) the servants of men,"
	implies plainly that slavery is abnormal (compare 1 Corinthians 7:23- :). "Men stealers," or slave dealers, are classed
	in 1 Timothy 1:10, with "murderers"
	and "perjurers." NEANDER,
	GROTIUS, c., explain, "If
	called, being a slave, to Christianity, be content—but yet, if also
	thou canst be free (as a still additional good, which if thou
	canst not attain, be satisfied without it but which, if offered to
	thee, is not to be despised), make use of the opportunity of
	becoming free, rather than by neglecting it to remain a slave."
	I prefer this latter view, as more according to the tenor of the
	Gospel, and fully justified by the Greek.
