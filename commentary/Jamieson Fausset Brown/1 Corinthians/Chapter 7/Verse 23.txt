23. be not yeâ€”Greek,
	"become not ye." Paul here changes from "thou"
	(1 Corinthians 7:21) to "ye."
	YE ALL are "bought"
	with the blood of Christ, whatever be your earthly state (1 Corinthians 7:21- :). "Become not servants to men," either externally,
	or spiritually; the former sense applying to the free alone: the
	latter to Christian freemen and slaves alike, that they should not be
	servile adherents to their party leaders at Corinth (1 Corinthians 3:21;
	1 Corinthians 3:22; Matthew 23:8-10;
	2 Corinthians 11:20); nor indeed slaves to
	men generally, so far as their condition admits. The external and
	internal conditions, so far as is attainable, should correspond, and
	the former be subservient to the latter (compare 1 Corinthians 7:21;
	1 Corinthians 7:32-35).
