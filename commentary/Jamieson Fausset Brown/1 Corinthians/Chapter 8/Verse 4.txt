	the subject begun in 1 Corinthians 8:1,

	true being at all, the god it represents is not a living reality.
	This does not contradict 1 Corinthians 8:1- :, which states that they who worship idols, worship devils
	for here it is the GODS
	believed by the worshippers to be represented by the idols
	which are denied to have any existence, not the devils which really
	under the idols delude the worshippers. 
	none other God—The
	oldest manuscripts omit the word "other"; which gives a
	clearer sense.
