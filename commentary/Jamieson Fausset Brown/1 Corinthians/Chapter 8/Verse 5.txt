	there are (exist) gods so called ( :-), whether in heaven (as the sun, moon, and stars) or in earth
	(as deified kings, beasts, c.), as there be (a recognized fact,
	Deuteronomy 10:17 Psalms 135:5;
	Psalms 136:2) gods many and lords
	many." Angels and men in authority are termed gods in
	Scripture, as exercising a divinely delegated power under God
	(compare Exodus 22:9; Exodus 22:28;
	Psalms 82:1; Psalms 82:6;
	John 10:34; John 10:35).
