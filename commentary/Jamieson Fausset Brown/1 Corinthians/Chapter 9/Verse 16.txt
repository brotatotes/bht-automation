16. though I preach . . . I have
	nothing to glory ofâ€”that is, If I preach the Gospel, and do so
	not gratuitously, I have no matter for "glorying." For the
	"necessity" that is laid on me to preach (compare  :-, and the case of Jonah) does away with ground for
	"glorying." The sole ground for the latter that I have, is
	my preaching without charge ( :-): since there is no necessity laid on me as to the latter,
	it is my voluntary act for the Gospel's sake.
