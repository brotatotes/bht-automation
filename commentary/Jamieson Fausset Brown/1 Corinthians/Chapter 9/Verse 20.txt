	law, as under the law—in things defined by the law; such
	as ceremonies not then repugnant to Christianity. Perhaps the reason

	belonged nationally to "the Jews," but did not in
	creed belong to the class of "them that are under the
	law." This view is confirmed by the reading inserted here by the
	oldest manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, "not being (that is,
	parenthetically, 'not that I am') myself under the law."
