21. To them . . . without law—that
	is, without revealed law: the heathen (compare Romans 2:12;
	1 Corinthians 9:15). 
	as without law—not
	urging on them the ceremonies and "works of the law," but
	"the hearing of faith" (1 Corinthians 9:15- :). Also discoursing in their own manner, as at Athens, with
	arguments from their own poets (1 Corinthians 9:15- :). 
	being not without law to
	God—"While thus conforming to others in matters
	indifferent, taking care not to be without law in relation to
	God, but responsible to law (literally, "IN
	LAW") in relation to Christ." This is the
	Christian's true position in relation to the world, to himself, and
	to God. Everything develops itself according to its proper law. So
	the Christian, though no longer subject to the literal law as
	constraining him from without, is subject to an inward principle or
	law, the spirit of faith in Christ acting from within as the germ of
	a new life. He does not in the Greek (as in English
	Version) say "under the law (as he does in 1 Corinthians 9:15- :) to Christ"; but uses the milder term, "in . . .
	law," responsible to law. Christ was responsible to the
	law for us, so that we are no longer responsible to it (Galatians 3:13;
	Galatians 3:24), but to Him, as the
	members to the Head (1 Corinthians 7:22;
	Romans 8:1-4; 1 Peter 2:16).
	Christians serve Christ in newness of spirit, no longer in oldness of
	the letter (that is, the old external law as such), 1 Peter 2:16- :. To Christ, as man's Head, the Father has properly
	delegated His authority (John 5:22;
	John 5:27); whence here he
	substitutes "Christ" for "God" in the second
	clause, "not without law to God, but under the law to
	Christ." The law of Christ is the law of love (John 5:27- :; compare Galatians 5:13).
