5. lead about a sister, a wife—that
	is, "a sister as a wife"; "a sister" by
	faith, which makes all believers brethren and sisters in the one
	family of God: "a wife" by marriage covenant. Paul implies
	he did not exercise his undoubted right to marry and "lead
	about" a believer, for the sake of Christian expediency, as well
	to save the Church the expense of maintaining her in his wide
	circuits, as also that he might give himself more undistractedly to
	building up the Church of Christ (1 Corinthians 7:26;
	1 Corinthians 7:32; 1 Corinthians 7:35).
	Contrast the Corinthians' want of self-sacrifice in the exercise of
	their "liberty" at the cost of destroying, instead of
	edifying, the Church (1 Corinthians 8:9,
	Margin; 1 Corinthians 8:9- :). 
	as other apostles—implying
	that some of them had availed themselves of the power which they all
	had, of marrying. We know from 1 Corinthians 8:9- :, that Cephas (Peter) was a married man. A confutation of
	Peter's self-styled followers, the Romanists, who exclude the clergy
	from marriage. CLEMENT OF
	ALEXANDRIA [Miscellanies,
	7.63] records a tradition that he encouraged his wife when being led
	to death by saying, "Remember, my dear one, the Lord."
	Compare EUSEBIUS
	[Eccleiastical History, 3.30]. 
	brethren of the Lord—held
	in especial esteem on account of their relationship to Jesus (Acts 1:14;
	Galatians 1:9). James, Joses, Simon,
	and Judas. Probably cousins of Jesus: as cousins were termed
	by the Jews "brethren." ALFORD
	makes them literally brothers of Jesus by Joseph and Mary. 
	Cephas—probably singled
	out as being a name carrying weight with one partisan section at
	Corinth. "If your favorite leader does so, surely so may I"
	(1 Corinthians 1:12; 1 Corinthians 3:22).
