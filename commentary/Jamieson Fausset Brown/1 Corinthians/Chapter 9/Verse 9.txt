9. ox . . . treadeth . . . corn—
	(Deuteronomy 25:4). In the East to the
	present day they do not after reaping carry the sheaves home to barns
	as we do, but take them to an area under the open air to be threshed
	by the oxen treading them with their feet, or else drawing a
	threshing instrument over them (compare Deuteronomy 25:4- :). 
	Doth God . . . care for
	oxen?—rather, "Is it for the oxen that God careth?"
	Is the animal the ultimate object for whose sake this law was given?
	No. God does care for the lower animal (Psalms 36:6;
	Matthew 10:29), but it is with the
	ultimate aim of the welfare of man, the head of animal
	creation. In the humane consideration shown for the lower animal, we
	are to learn that still more ought it to be exercised in the case of
	man, the ultimate object of the law; and that the human (spiritual as
	well as temporal) laborer is worthy of his hire.
