4. these things—and none
	other, namely, this whole Epistle. 
	write we unto you—Some
	oldest manuscripts omit "unto you," and emphasize "we."
	Thus the antithesis is between "we" (apostles and
	eye-witnesses) and "your." We write thus that your
	joy may be full. Other oldest manuscripts and versions read "OUR
	joy," namely, that our joy may be filled full by bringing
	you also into fellowship with the Father and Son. (Compare  :-, end; Philippians 2:2, "Fulfil
	ye my joy," Philippians 2:16;
	Philippians 4:1; 2 John 1:8).
	It is possible that "your" may be a correction of
	transcribers to make this verse harmonize with John 15:11;
	John 16:24; however, as John often
	repeats favorite phrases, he may do so here, so "your" may
	be from himself. So 2 John 1:12,
	"your" in oldest manuscripts. The authority of manuscripts
	and versions on both sides here is almost evenly balanced. Christ
	Himself is the source, object, and center of His people's joy
	(compare 1 John 1:3, end); it is in
	fellowship with Him that we have joy, the fruit of
	faith.
