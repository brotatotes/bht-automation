7. Compare Ephesians 5:8;
	Ephesians 5:11-14. "WE
	WALK"; "God is (essentially in His very
	nature as 'the light,' 1 John 1:5)
	in the light." WALKING
	in the light, the element in which God Himself is, constitutes
	the test of fellowship with Him. Christ, like us, walked in
	the light (1 John 2:6). ALFORD
	notices, Walking in the light as He is in the light, is no mere
	imitation of God, but an identity in the essential element of
	our daily walk with the essential element of God's eternal being. 
	we have fellowship one with
	another—and of course with God (to be understood from
	1 John 1:6). Without having
	fellowship with God there can be no true and Christian fellowship one
	with another (compare 1 John 1:3). 
	and—as the result of
	"walking in the light, as He is in the light." 
	the blood of Jesus . . .
	cleanseth us from all sin—daily contracted through the sinful
	weakness of the flesh, and the power of Satan and the world. He is
	speaking not of justification through His blood once for all, but of
	the present sanctification ("cleanseth" is present
	tense) which the believer, walking in the light and having
	fellowship with God and the saints, enjoys as His privilege.
	Compare John 13:10, Greek,
	"He that has been bathed, needeth not save to wash
	his feet, but is clean every whit." Compare John 13:10- :, "cleanse us from all unrighteousness," a
	further step besides "forgiving us our sins."
	Christ's blood is the cleansing mean, whereby gradually, being
	already justified and in fellowship with God, we become clean
	from all sin which would mar our fellowship with God. Faith applies
	the cleansing, purifying blood. Some oldest manuscripts omit
	"Christ"; others retain it.
