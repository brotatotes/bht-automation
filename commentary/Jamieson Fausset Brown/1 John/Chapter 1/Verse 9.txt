9. confess—with the lips,
	speaking from a contrite heart; involving also confession to our
	fellow men of offenses committed against them. 
	he—God. 
	faithful—to His own
	promises; "true" to His word. 
	just—Not merely the
	mercy, but the justice or righteousness of God is set
	forth in the redemption of the penitent believer in Christ. God's
	promises of mercy, to which He is faithful, are in accordance
	with His justice.
to—Greek, "in
	order that." His forgiving us our sins and cleansing us,
	c., is in furtherance of the ends of His eternal faithfulness
	and justice.
forgive—remitting the
	guilt.
cleanse—purify from all
	filthiness, so that henceforth we more and more become free from the
	presence of sin through the Spirit of sanctification (compare  :- and above, see on 1 John 1:7).
	unrighteousness—offensive
	to Him who "is just" or righteous; called "sin,"
	1 John 1:7, because "sin is
	the transgression of the law," and the law is the expression of
	God's righteousness, so that sin is unrighteousness.
