12. little children—Greek,
	"little sons," or "dear sons and daughters";
	not the same Greek as in  :-, "little children," "infants" (in
	age and standing). He calls ALL
	to whom he writes, "little sons" ( :-, Greek; 1 John 2:28;
	1 John 3:18; 1 John 4:4;
	1 John 5:21); but only in 1 John 2:13;
	1 John 2:18 he uses the term "little
	children," or "infants." Our Lord, whose Spirit John
	so deeply drank into, used to His disciples (1 John 2:18- :) the term "little sons," or dear sons and
	daughters; but in John 21:5,
	"little children." It is an undesigned coincidence with the
	Epistle here, that in John's Gospel somewhat similarly the
	classification, "lambs, sheep, sheep," occurs. 
	are forgiven—"have
	been, and are forgiven you": ALL
	God's sons and daughters alike enjoy this privilege.
