18. Little children—same Greek
	as 1 John 2:13; children in
	age. After the fathers and young men were gone,
	"the last time" with its "many Antichrists" was
	about to come suddenly on the children. "In this last
	hour we all even still live" [BENGEL].
	Each successive age has had in it some of the signs of "the last
	time" which precedes Christ's coming, in order to keep the
	Church in continual waiting for the Lord. The connection with 1 John 2:13- : is: There are coming those seducers who are of the world
	(1 John 4:5), and would tempt you
	to go out from us (1 John 2:19)
	and deny Christ (1 John 2:22). 
	as ye have heard—from
	the apostles, preachers of the Gospel (for example, 1 John 2:22- :; and in the region of Ephesus, Acts 20:29;
	Acts 20:30). 
	shall come—Greek,
	"cometh," namely, out of his own place. Antichrist
	is interpreted in two ways: a false Christ (Matthew 24:5;
	Matthew 24:24), literally, "instead
	of Christ"; or an adversary of Christ, literally,
	"against Christ." As John never uses pseudo-Christ,
	or "false Christ," for Antichrist, it is plain he
	means an adversary of Christ, claiming to himself what belongs
	to Christ, and wishing to substitute himself for Christ as the
	supreme object of worship. He denies the Son, not merely, like
	the pope, acts in the name of the Son, Matthew 24:24- :, "Who opposeth himself (Greek, "
	ANTI-keimenos")
	[to] all that is called God," decides this. For God's great
	truth, "God is man," he would substitute his own lie, "man
	is God" [TRENCH]. 
	are there—Greek,
	"there have begun to be"; there have arisen. These "many
	Antichrists" answer to "the spirit of lawlessness (Greek)
	doth already work." The Antichristian principle appeared then,
	as now, in evil men and evil teachings and writings; but still "THE
	Antichrist" means a hostile person, even as "THE
	Christ" is a personal Saviour. As "cometh" is used of
	Christ, so here of Antichrist, the embodiment in his own
	person of all the Antichristian features and spirit of those "many
	Antichrists" which have been, and are, his forerunners. John
	uses the singular of him. No other New Testament writer uses the
	term. He probably answers to "the little horn having the eyes of
	a man, and speaking great things" (Daniel 7:8;
	Daniel 7:20); "the man of sin,
	son of perdition" (2 Thessalonians 2:3);
	"the beast ascending out of the bottomless pit" (Revelation 11:7;
	Revelation 17:8), or rather, "the
	false prophet," the same as "the second beast coming up out
	of the earth" (Revelation 13:11-18;
	Revelation 16:13).
