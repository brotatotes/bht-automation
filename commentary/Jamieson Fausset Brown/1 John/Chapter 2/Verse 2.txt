2. And he—Greek, "And
	Himself." He is our all-prevailing Advocate, because He
	is Himself "the propitiation"; abstract, as
	in 1 Corinthians 1:30: He is to us all
	that is needed for propitiation "in behalf of our sins";
	the propitiatory sacrifice, provided by the Father's love,
	removing the estrangement, and appeasing the righteous wrath, on
	God's part, against the sinner. "There is no incongruity that a
	father should be offended with that son whom he loveth, and at
	that time offended with him when he loveth him" [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. The only other
	place in the New Testament where Greek "propitiation"
	occurs, is 1 John 4:10; it answers
	in the Septuagint to Hebrew, "caphar,"
	to effect an atonement or reconciliation with God; and
	in Ezekiel 44:29, to the sin
	offering. In Romans 3:25,
	Greek, it is "propitiatory," that is, the mercy
	seat, or lid of the ark whereon God, represented by the Shekinah
	glory above it, met His people, represented by the high priest who
	sprinkled the blood of the sacrifice on it. 
	and—Greek,
	"yet." 
	ours—believers: not
	Jews, in contrast to Gentiles; for he is not writing to Jews
	(1 John 5:21). 
	also for the sins of the
	whole world—Christ's "advocacy" is limited to
	believers (1 John 2:1;
	1 John 1:7): His propitiation
	extends as widely as sin extends: see on 1 John 1:7- :, "denying the Lord that bought them." "The
	whole world" cannot be restricted to the believing
	portion of the world (compare 1 John 1:7- :; and "the whole world," 1 John 1:7- :). "Thou, too, art part of the world, so that thine
	heart cannot deceive itself and think, The Lord died for Peter and
	Paul, but not for me" [LUTHER].
