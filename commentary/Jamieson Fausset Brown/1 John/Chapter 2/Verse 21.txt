21. but because ye know it, and
	that, &c.â€”Ye not only know what is the truth
	(concerning the Son and the Father,  :-), but also are able to detect a lie as a thing opposed to
	the truth. For right (a straight line) is the index of itself and of
	what is crooked [ESTIUS].
	The Greek is susceptible of ALFORD'S
	translation, "Because ye know it, and because no lie is
	of the truth" (literally, "every lie is excluded from being
	of the truth"). I therefore wrote (in this Epistle) to point out
	what the lie is, and who the liars are.
