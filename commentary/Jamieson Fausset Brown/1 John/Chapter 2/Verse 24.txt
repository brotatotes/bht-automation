24. Let that—truth respecting
	the Father and the Son, regarded as a seed not merely dropped in, but
	having taken root (1 John 3:9). 
	ye—in the Greek
	standing emphatically at the beginning of the sentence. YE,
	therefore, acknowledge the Son, and so shall ye have the
	Father also (1 John 2:23). 
	from the beginning—from
	the time of your first hearing the Gospel. 
	remain—Translate as
	before, "abide." 
	ye also—in your turn,
	as distinguished from "that which ye have heard," the seed
	abiding in you. Compare 1 John 2:23- :, "the anointing abideth in you . . . ye shall
	abide in Him." Having taken into us the living seed of
	the truth concerning the Father and the Son, we become transformed
	into the likeness of Him whose seed we have taken into us.
