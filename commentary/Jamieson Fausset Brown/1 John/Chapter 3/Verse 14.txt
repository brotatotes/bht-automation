14. We—emphatical; hated
	though we be by the world, we know what the world knows not. 
	know—as an assured
	fact. 
	passed—changed our
	state. Colossians 1:13, "from
	the power of darkness . . . translated into the kingdom of His dear
	Son." 
	from death unto
	life—literally, "out of the death (which enthrals
	the unregenerate) into the life (of the regenerate)." A
	palpable coincidence of language and thought, the beloved disciple
	adopting his Lord's words. 
	because we love the
	brethren—the ground, not of our passing over out of death
	into life, but of our knowing that we have so. Love,
	on our part, is the evidence of our justification and
	regeneration, not the cause of them. "Let each go to his
	own heart; if he find there love to the brethren, let him feel
	assured that he has passed from death unto life. Let him not mind
	that his glory is only hidden; when the Lord shall come, then shall
	he appear in glory. For he has vital energy, but it is still
	wintertime; the root has vigor, but the branches are as it were dry;
	within there is marrow which is vigorous, within are leaves, within
	fruits, but they must wait for summer" [AUGUSTINE].
	He that loveth not—Most
	of the oldest manuscripts omit "his brother," which makes
	the statement more general. 
	abideth—still. 
	in death—"in the
	(spiritual) death" (ending in eternal death) which is the state
	of all by nature. His want of love evidences that no saving
	change has passed over him.
