	"loveth not" (1 John 3:14);
	there is no medium between the two. "Love and hatred, like light
	and darkness, life and death, necessarily replace, as well as
	necessarily exclude, one another" [ALFORD].
	is a murderer—because
	indulging in that passion, which, if followed out to its natural
	consequences, would make him one. "Whereas, 1 John 3:14- : desires us to lay down our lives for the brethren; duels

	not deprive another of life" [BENGEL].

	which would flow from it. Whomsoever one hates, one wishes to be
	dead. 
	hath—Such a one still
	"abideth in death." It is not his future state, but
	his present, which is referred to. He who hates (that is,
	loveth not) his brother (1 John 3:14),
	cannot in this his present state have eternal life abiding in him.
