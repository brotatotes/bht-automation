19. hereby—Greek,
	"herein"; in our loving in deed and in truth ( :-). 
	we know—The oldest
	manuscripts have "we shall know," namely, if we fulfil the
	command (1 John 3:18). 
	of the truth—that we
	are real disciples of, and belonging to, the truth, as it is
	in Jesus: begotten of God with the word of truth. Having herein the
	truth radically, we shall be sure not to love merely in word
	and tongue. (1 John 3:18). 
	assure—literally,
	"persuade," namely, so as to cease to condemn us; satisfy
	the questionings and doubts of our consciences as to whether we be
	accepted before God or not (compare Matthew 28:14;
	Acts 12:20, "having made
	Blastus their friend," literally, "persuaded"). The
	"heart," as the seat of the feelings, is our inward judge;
	the conscience, as the witness, acts either as our justifying
	advocate, or our condemning accuser, before God even now. Acts 12:20- :, has "conscience," but the passage is omitted in
	most old manuscripts. John nowhere else uses the term "conscience."
	Peter and Paul alone use it. 
	before him—as in the
	sight of Him, the omniscient Searcher of hearts. Assurance is
	designed to be the ordinary experience and privilege of the believer.
