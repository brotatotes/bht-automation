4. Sin is incompatible with
	birth from God (1 John 3:1-3).
	John often sets forth the same truth negatively, which he had
	before set forth positively. He had shown, birth from God
	involves self-purification; he now shows where sin, that is, the want
	of self-purification, is, there is no birth from God. 
	Whosoever—Greek,
	"Every one who." 
	committeth sin—in
	contrast to 1 John 3:3, "Every
	man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself"; and 1 John 3:3- :, "He that doeth righteousness." 
	transgresseth . . . the
	law—Greek, "committeth transgression of law."
	God's law of purity; and so shows he has no such hope of being
	hereafter pure as God is pure, and, therefore, that he is not born of
	God. 
	for—Greek,
	"and." 
	sin is . . . transgression of
	. . . law—definition of sin in general. The Greek
	having the article to both, implies that they are convertible terms.
	The Greek "sin" (hamartia) is literally, "a
	missing of the mark." God's will being that mark to be ever
	aimed at. "By the law is the knowledge of sin." The
	crookedness of a line is shown by being brought into juxtaposition
	with a straight ruler.
