8. He that committeth sin is of the
	devil—in contrast to "He that doeth righteousness,"
	1 John 3:7. He is a son of the
	devil (1 John 3:10; John 8:44).
	John does not, however, say, "born of the devil." as he
	does "born of God," for "the devil begets none, nor
	does he create any; but whoever imitates the devil becomes a child of
	the devil by imitating him, not by proper birth" [AUGUSTINE,
	Ten Homilies on the First Epistle of John, Homily 4.10]. From
	the devil there is not generation, but corruption [BENGEL].
	sinneth from the
	beginning—from the time that any began to sin [ALFORD]:
	from the time that he became what he is, the devil. He seems to have
	kept his first estate only a very short time after his creation
	[BENGEL]. Since the
	fall of man [at the beginning of our world] the devil
	is (ever) sinning (this is the force of "sinneth";
	he has sinned from the beginning, is the cause of all sins, and still
	goes on sinning; present). As the author of sin, and prince of this
	world, he has never ceased to seduce man to sin [LUECKE].
	destroy—break up and do
	away with; bruising and crushing the serpent's head. 
	works of the devil—sin,
	and all its awful consequences. John argues, Christians cannot do
	that which Christ came to destroy.
