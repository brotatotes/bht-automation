	in the abstract: love, in its highest ideal, is herein. The
	love was all on God's side, none on ours. 
	not that we loved God—though
	so altogether worthy of love. 
	he loved us—though so
	altogether unworthy of love. The Greek aorist expresses, Not
	that we did any act of love at any time to God, but
	that He did the act of love to us in sending Christ.
