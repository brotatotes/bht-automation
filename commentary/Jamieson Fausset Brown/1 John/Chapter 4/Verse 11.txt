11. God's love to us is the
	grand motive for our love to one another ( :-). 
	if—as we all admit as a
	fact. 
	we . . . also—as being
	born of God, and therefore resembling our Father who is love.
	In proportion as we appreciate God's love to us, we love Him and also
	the brethren, the children (by regeneration) of the same God,
	the representatives of the unseen God.
