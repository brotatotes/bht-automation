7. Resumption of the main theme
	(1 John 2:29). Love, the
	sum of righteousness, is the test of our being born of God.
	Love flows from a sense of God's love to us: compare 1 John 4:9;
	1 John 3:16, which 1 John 3:16- : resumes; and 1 John 4:13;
	1 John 3:24, which similarly 1 John 3:24- : resumes. At the same time, 1 John 3:24- : is connected with the immediately preceding context, 1 John 3:24- : setting forth Christ's incarnation, the great proof of
	God's love (1 John 4:10). 
	Beloved—an address
	appropriate to his subject, "love." 
	love—All love is
	from God as its fountain: especially that embodiment of love,
	God manifest in the flesh. The Father also is love (1 John 4:10- :). The Holy Ghost sheds love as its first fruit
	abroad in the heart. 
	knoweth God—spiritually,
	experimentally, and habitually.
