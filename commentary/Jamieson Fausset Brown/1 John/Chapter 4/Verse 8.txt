8. knoweth not—Greek
	aorist: not only knoweth not now, but never knew, has not
	once for all known God. 
	God is love—There is no
	Greek article to love, but to God; therefore we
	cannot translate, Love is God. God is fundamentally and
	essentially LOVE: not
	merely is loving, for then John's argument would not stand;
	for the conclusion from the premises then would be this, This man
	is not loving: God is loving; therefore he knoweth not God IN
	SO FAR AS GOD IS LOVING;
	still he might know Him in His other attributes. But when we
	take love as God's essence, the argument is sound: This man doth
	not love, and therefore knows not love: God is essentially
	love, therefore he knows not God.
