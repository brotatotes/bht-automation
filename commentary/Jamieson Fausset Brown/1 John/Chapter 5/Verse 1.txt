1. Reason why our "brother"
	(1 John 4:21) is entitled to such
	love, namely, because he is "born (begotten) of God":
	so that if we want to show our love to God, we must show it to
	God's visible representative. 
	Whosoever—Greek,
	"Everyone that." He could not be our "Jesus"
	(God-Saviour) unless He were "the Christ"; for He could not
	reveal the way of salvation, except He were a prophet: He
	could not work out that salvation, except He were a priest: He
	could not confer that salvation upon us, except He were a king:
	He could not be prophet, priest, and king, except He
	were the Christ [PEARSON,
	Exposition of the Creed]. 
	born—Translate,
	"begotten," as in the latter part of the verse, the Greek
	being the same. Christ is the "only-begotten Son" by
	generation; we become begotten sons of God by regeneration
	and adoption. 
	every one that loveth him
	that begat—sincerely, not in mere profession (1 John 4:21- :). 
	loveth him also that is
	begotten of him—namely, "his brethren" (1 John 4:21- :).
