11. hath given—Greek,
	aorist: "gave" once for all. Not only "promised"
	it. 
	life is in his
	Son—essentially (John 1:4;
	John 11:25; John 14:6);
	bodily (Colossians 2:9); operatively
	(2 Timothy 1:10) [LANGE
	in ALFORD]. It is in the
	second Adam, the Son of God, that this life is secured to us,
	which, if left to depend on us, we should lose, like the first Adam.
