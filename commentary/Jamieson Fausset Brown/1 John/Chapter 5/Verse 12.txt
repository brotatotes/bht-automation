12. the Son . . . lifeâ€”Greek,
	"THE life."
	BENGEL remarks, The verse
	has two clauses: in the former the Son is mentioned without the
	addition "of God," for believers know the Son: in
	the second clause the addition "of God" is made, that
	unbelievers may know thereby what a serious thing it is not to have
	Him. In the former clause "has" bears the emphasis; in the
	second, life. To have the Son is to be able to say as
	the bride, "I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine"
	[Song of Solomon 6:3]. Faith is the
	mean whereby the regenerate HAVE
	Christ as a present possession, and in having Him have life
	in its germ and reality now, and shall have life in its fully
	developed manifestation hereafter. Eternal life here is: (1)
	initial, and is an earnest of that which is to follow; in the
	intermediate state (2) partial, belonging but to a part of a
	man, though that is his nobler part, the soul separated from the
	body; at and after the resurrection (3) perfectional. This
	life is not only natural, consisting of the union of the soul and the
	body (as that of the reprobate in eternal pain, which ought to be
	termed death eternal, not life), but also spiritual,
	the union of the soul to God, and supremely blessed for ever (for
	life is another term for happiness) [PEARSON,
	Exposition of the Creed].
