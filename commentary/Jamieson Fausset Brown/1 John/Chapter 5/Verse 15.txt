	we have the petitions that we
	desired of him—We have, as present possessions,
	everything whatsoever we desired (asked) from Him.

	granted even before the event; and can recognize the event when it
	comes to pass, as not from chance, but obtained by our past prayers.

	prayers, so much so that he appointed singers to praise the Lord
	beforehand.
