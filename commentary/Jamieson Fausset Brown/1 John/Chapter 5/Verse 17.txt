17. "Every unrighteousness
	(even that of believers, compare 1 John 1:9;
	1 John 3:4. Every coming short of
	right) is sin"; (but) not every sin is the sin unto
	death. 
	and there is a sin not unto
	death—in the case of which, therefore, believers may intercede.
	Death and life stand in correlative opposition (1 John 3:4- :). The sin unto death must be one tending "towards"
	(so the Greek), and so resulting in, death. ALFORD
	makes it to be an appreciable ACT of sin, namely, the denying
	Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of God (in contrast to confess
	this truth, 1 John 5:1; 1 John 5:5),
	1 John 2:19; 1 John 2:22;
	1 John 4:2; 1 John 4:3;
	1 John 5:10. Such wilful deniers of
	Christ are not to be received into one's house, or wished "God
	speed." Still, I think with BENGEL,
	not merely the act, but also the state of apostasy
	accompanying the act, is included—a "state of soul in
	which faith, love, and hope, in short, the new life, is extinguished.
	The chief commandment is faith and love. Therefore, the
	chief sin is that by which faith and love are destroyed. In the
	former case is life; in the latter, death. As long as it is
	not evident (see on 1 John 5:16,
	on 'see') that it is a sin unto death, it is lawful to pray. But when
	it is deliberate rejection of grace, and the man puts from him life
	thereby, how can others procure for him life?" Contrast 1 John 5:16- :. Compare Matthew 12:31;
	Matthew 12:32 as to the wilful
	rejection of Christ, and resistance to the Holy Ghost's plain
	testimony to Him as the divine Messiah. Jesus, on the cross, pleaded
	only for those who KNEW NOT
	what they were doing in crucifying Him, not for those wilfully
	resisting grace and knowledge. If we pray for the impenitent,
	it must be with humble reference of the matter to God's will, not
	with the intercessory request which we should offer for a
	brother when erring.
