11. what—Greek, "In
	reference to what, or what manner of time." What
	expresses the time absolutely: what was to be the era of
	Messiah's coming; what manner of time; what events and
	features should characterize the time of His coming. The "or"
	implies that some of the prophets, if they could not as individuals
	discover the exact time, searched into its characteristic
	features and events. The Greek for "time" is the
	season, the epoch, the fit time in God's purposes. 
	Spirit of Christ . . . in
	them— (Acts 16:7, in oldest
	manuscripts, "the Spirit of Jesus"; Acts 16:7- :). So JUSTIN
	MARTYR says, "Jesus
	was He who appeared and communed with Moses, Abraham, and the other
	patriarchs." CLEMENT OF
	ALEXANDRIA calls Him "the
	Prophet of prophets, and Lord of all the prophetical spirit." 
	did signify—"did
	give intimation." 
	of—Greek, "the
	sufferers (appointed) unto Christ," or foretold in
	regard to Christ. "Christ," the anointed
	Mediator, whose sufferings are the price of our "salvation"
	(1 Peter 1:9; 1 Peter 1:10),
	and who is the channel of "the grace that should come unto you."
	the glory—Greek,
	"glories," namely, of His resurrection, of His ascension,
	of His judgment and coming kingdom, the necessary consequence of the
	sufferings. 
	that should follow—Greek,
	"after these (sufferings)," 1 Peter 3:18-22;
	1 Peter 5:1. Since "the Spirit
	of Christ" is the Spirit of God, Christ is God. It is
	only because the Son of God was to become our Christ that He
	manifested Himself and the Father through Him in the Old Testament,
	and by the Holy Spirit, eternally proceeding from the Father and
	Himself, spake in the prophets.
