17. if ye call on—that is,
	"seeing that ye call on," for all the regenerate
	pray as children of God, "Our Father who art in
	heaven" (Matthew 6:9; Luke 11:2).
	the Father—rather,
	"Call upon as Father Him who without acceptance of
	persons (Acts 10:34; Romans 2:11;
	James 2:1, not accepting the Jew
	above the Gentile, 2 Chronicles 19:7;
	Luke 20:21; properly said of a
	judge not biassed in judgment by respect of persons) judgeth,"
	c. The Father judgeth by His Son, His Representative, exercising His
	delegated authority (John 5:22).
	This marks the harmonious and complete unity of the Trinity. 
	work—Each man's work
	is one complete whole, whether good or bad. The particular
	works of each are manifestations of the general character of his
	lifework, whether it was of faith and love whereby alone we can
	please God and escape condemnation. 
	pass—Greek,
	"conduct yourselves during." 
	sojourning—The outward
	state of the Jews in their dispersion is an emblem of the
	sojourner-like state of all believers in this world, away from
	our true Fatherland. 
	fear—reverential, not
	slavish. He who is your Father, is also your Judge—a thought which
	may well inspire reverential fear. THEOPHYLACT
	observes, A double fear is mentioned in Scripture: (1) elementary,
	causing one to become serious (2) perfective: the latter is
	here the motive by which Peter urges them as sons of God to be
	obedient. Fear is not here opposed to assurance, but to
	carnal security: fear producing vigilant caution lest we
	offend God and backslide. "Fear and hope flow from
	the same fountain: fear prevents us from falling away from
	hope" [BENGEL].
	Though love has no fear IN
	it, yet in our present state of imperfect love, it needs to have fear
	going ALONG WITH It as a
	subordinate principle. This fear drowns all other fears. The believer
	fears God, and so has none else to fear. Not to fear God is the
	greatest baseness and folly. The martyrs' more than mere human
	courage flowed from this.
