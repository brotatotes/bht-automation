11. As heretofore he exhorted
	them to walk worthily of their calling, in contradistinction to their
	own former walk, so now he exhorts them to glorify God before
	unbelievers. 
	Dearly beloved—He gains
	their attention to his exhortation by assuring them of his love. 
	strangers and pilgrims—
	(1 Peter 1:17). Sojourners,
	literally, settlers having a house in a city without being
	citizens in respect to the rights of citizenship; a picture of
	the Christian's position on earth; and pilgrims, staying for a
	time in a foreign land. FLACIUS
	thus analyzes the exhortation: (1) Purify your souls (a) as strangers
	on earth who must not allow yourselves to be kept back by earthly
	lusts, and (b) because these lusts war against the soul's salvation.
	(2) Walk piously among unbelievers (a) so that they may cease to
	calumniate Christians, and (b) may themselves be converted to Christ.
	fleshly lusts—enumerated
	in Galatians 5:19, c. Not only the
	gross appetites which we have in common with the brutes, but all the
	thoughts of the unrenewed mind. 
	which—Greek,
	"the which," that is, inasmuch as being such as
	"war." &c. Not only do they impede, but they assail
	[BENGEL]. 
	the soul—that is,
	against the regenerated soul such as were those now addressed. The
	regenerated soul is besieged by sinful lusts. Like Samson in the lap
	of Delilah, the believer, the moment that he gives way to fleshly
	lusts, has the locks of his strength shorn, and ceases to maintain
	that spiritual separation from the world and the flesh of which the
	Nazarite vow was the type.
