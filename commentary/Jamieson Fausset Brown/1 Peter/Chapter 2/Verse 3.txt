3. Peter alludes to  :-. The first "tastes" of God's goodness are
	afterwards followed by fuller and happier experiences. A taste whets
	the appetite [BENGEL]. 
	graciousâ€”Greek,
	"good," benignant, kind; as God is revealed to us in
	Christ, "the Lord" ( :-), we who are born again ought so to be good and kind
	to the brethren (1 Peter 1:22).
	"Whosoever has not tasted the word to him it is not sweet it has
	not reached the heart; but to them who have experienced it, who with
	the heart believe, 'Christ has been sent for me and is become
	my own: my miseries are His, and His life mine,' it
	tastes sweet" [LUTHER].
