8. stone of stumbling, c.—quoted
	from Isaiah 8:14. Not merely they
	stumbled, in that their prejudices were offended but their
	stumbling implies the judicial punishment of their reception
	of Messiah; they hurt themselves in stumbling over the corner-stone,
	as "stumble" means in Jeremiah 13:16;
	Daniel 11:19. 
	at the word—rather,
	join "being disobedient to the word"; so 1 Peter 3:1;
	1 Peter 4:17. 
	whereunto—to penal
	stumbling; to the judicial punishment of their unbelief. See
	above. 
	also—an additional
	thought; God's ordination; not that God ordains or appoints
	them to sin, but they are given up to "the fruit of their
	own ways" according to the eternal counsel of God. The moral
	ordering of the world is altogether of God. God appoints the ungodly
	to be given up unto sin, and a reprobate mind, and its
	necessary penalty. "Were appointed," Greek, "set,"
	answers to "I lay," Greek, "set,"
	1 Peter 2:6. God, in the active, is
	said to appoint Christ and the elect (directly). Unbelievers,
	in the passive, are said to be appointed (God acting less
	directly in the appointment of the sinner's awful course) [BENGEL].
	God ordains the wicked to punishment, not to crime [J. CAPPEL].
	"Appointed" or "set" (not here "FORE-ordained")
	refers, not to the eternal counsel so directly, as to the penal
	justice of God. Through the same Christ whom sinners rejected, they
	shall be rejected; unlike believers, they are by God appointed
	unto wrath as FITTED
	for it. The lost shall lay all the blame of their ruin on their own
	sinful perversity, not on God's decree; the saved shall ascribe all
	the merit of their salvation to God's electing love and grace.
