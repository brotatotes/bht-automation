6. Sara—an example of faith.
calling him lord— ( :-). 
	ye are—Greek,
	"ye have become": "children" of Abraham and Sara
	by faith, whereas ye were Gentile aliens from the covenant. 
	afraid with any
	amazement—Greek, "fluttering alarm,"
	"consternation." Act well, and be not thrown into sudden
	panic, as weak females are apt to be, by any opposition from
	without. BENGEL
	translates, "Not afraid OF
	any fluttering terror coming from without" ( :-). So the Septuagint,  :- uses the same Greek word, which Peter probably refers
	to. Anger assails men; fear, women. You need fear no man in
	doing what is right: not thrown into fluttering agitation by any
	sudden outbreak of temper on the part of your unbelieving husbands,
	while you do well.
