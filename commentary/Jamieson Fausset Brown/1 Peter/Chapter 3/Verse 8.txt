	of one mind—as to the
	faith. 
	having compassion one of
	another—Greek, "sympathizing" in the joy and
	sorrow of others. 
	love as brethren—Greek,
	"loving the brethren." 
	pitiful—towards the
	afflicted. 
	courteous—genuine
	Christian politeness; not the tinsel of the world's politeness;
	stamped with unfeigned love on one side, and humility
	on the other. But the oldest manuscripts read, "humble-minded."

	conscious effort to be truly humble.
