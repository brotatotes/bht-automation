11. If any . . . speak—namely,
	as a prophet, or divinely taught teacher in the Church
	assembly. 
	as the, c.—The Greek
	has no article: "as oracles of God." This may be due to
	Greek: "God," having no article, it being a
	principle when a governed noun omits the Greek article that
	the governing noun should omit it, too. In  :- also, the Greek article is wanting thus English
	Version, "as the oracles of God," namely, the Old
	Testament, would be "right," and the precept be similar
	to Romans 12:6, "prophesy
	according to the analogy of the faith." But the context
	suits better thus, "Let him speak as (becomes one speaking)
	oracles OF GOD."
	His divinely inspired words are not his own, but God's,
	and as a steward (1 Peter 4:10)
	having them committed to him, he ought so to speak them. Jesus was
	the pattern in this respect (Matthew 7:29;
	John 12:49; John 14:10;
	compare Paul, 2 Corinthians 2:17). Note,
	the very same term as is applied in the only other passages where it
	occurs (Acts 7:38; Romans 3:2;
	Hebrews 5:12), to the Old
	Testament inspired writings, is here predicated of the inspired
	words (the substance of which was afterwards committed to
	writing) of the New Testament prophets. 
	minister—in acts;
	the other sphere of spiritual activity besides speaking.
as of—"out of"
	the store of his "strength" (Greek, physical power
	in relation to outward service, rather than moral and intellectual
	"ability"; so in Hebrews 5:12- :). 
	giveth—Greek,
	"supplieth"; originally said of a choragus, who
	supplied the chorus with all necessaries for performing their
	several parts. 
	that God in all things may be
	glorified—the final end of all a Christian's acts. 
	through Jesus Christ—the
	mediator through whom all our blessings come down to us, and also
	through whom all our praises ascend to God. Through Christ alone can
	God be glorified in us and our sayings and doings. 
	to whom—Christ. 
	be—Greek, "is."
	for ever and ever—Greek,
	"unto the ages of the ages."
