16. a Christian—the name given
	in contempt first at Antioch. Acts 11:26;
	Acts 26:28; the only three places
	where the term occurs. At first believers had no distinctive name,
	but were called among themselves "brethren," Acts 26:28- :; "disciples," Acts 26:28- :; "those of the way," Acts 26:28- :; "saints," Romans 1:7;
	by the Jews (who denied that Jesus was the CHRIST,
	and so would never originate the name Christian), in contempt,
	"Nazarenes." At Antioch, where first idolatrous
	Gentiles (Cornelius, Acts 10:1;
	Acts 10:2, was not an idolater,
	but a proselyte) were converted, and wide missionary work began, they
	could be no longer looked on as a Jewish sect, and so the
	Gentiles designated them by the new name "Christians."
	The rise of the new name marked a new epoch in the Church's life, a
	new stage of its development, namely, its missions to the Gentiles.
	The idle and witty people of Antioch, we know from heathen writers,
	were famous for inventing nicknames. The date of this Epistle must
	have been when this had become the generally recognized designation
	among Gentiles (it is never applied by Christians to each
	other, as it was in after ages—an undesigned proof that the New
	Testament was composed when it professes), and when the name exposed
	one to reproach and suffering, though not seemingly as yet to
	systematic persecution. 
	let him not be ashamed—though
	the world is ashamed of shame. To suffer for one's own faults is no
	honor (1 Peter 4:15; 1 Peter 2:20),
	—for Christ, is no shame (1 Peter 4:14;
	1 Peter 3:13). 
	but let him glorify God—not
	merely glory in persecution; Peter might have said as the contrast,
	"but let him esteem it an honor to himself"; but the honor
	is to be given to God, who counts him worthy of such an honor,
	involving exemption from the coming judgments on the ungodly. 
	on this behalf—The
	oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read, "in this name,"
	that is, in respect of suffering for such a name.
