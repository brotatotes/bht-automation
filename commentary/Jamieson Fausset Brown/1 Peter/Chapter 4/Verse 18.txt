18. scarcely—Compare "so
	as by fire," 1 Corinthians 3:15;
	having to pass through trying chastisements, as David did for his
	sin. "The righteous" man has always more or less of trial,
	but the issue is certain, and the entrance into the kingdom abundant
	at last. The "scarcely" marks the severity of the ordeal,
	and the unlikelihood (in a mere human point of view) of the righteous
	sustaining it; but the righteousness of Christ and God's everlasting
	covenant make it all sure. 
	ungodly—having no
	regard for God; negative description. 
	sinner—loving sin;
	positive; the same man is at once God-forgetting and sin-loving. 
	appear—in judgment.
