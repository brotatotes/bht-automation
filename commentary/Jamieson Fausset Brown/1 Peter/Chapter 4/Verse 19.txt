19. General conclusion from
	1 Peter 4:17; 1 Peter 4:18.
	Seeing that the godly know that their sufferings are by God's
	will, to chasten them that they may not perish with the world,
	they have good reason to trust God cheerfully amidst sufferings,
	persevering in well-doing.
let them—Greek,
	"let them also," "let even them,"
	as well as those not suffering. Not only under ordinary
	circumstances, but also in time of suffering, let
	believers commit. (Compare Note, see on 1 Peter 4:18- :). 
	according to the will of
	God—(See on 1 Peter 3:17).
	God's will that the believer should suffer (1 Peter 3:17- :), is for his good. One oldest manuscript and Vulgate
	read, "in well-doings"; contrast ill-doings, 1 Peter 3:17- :. Our committing of ourselves to God is to be, not in
	indolent and passive quietism, but accompanied with active
	well-doings.
faithful—to His
	covenant promises. 
	Creator—who is
	therefore also our Almighty Preserver. He, not we, must keep
	our souls. Sin destroyed the original spiritual relation between
	creature and Creator, leaving that only of government. Faith restores
	it; so that the believer, living to the will of God (1 Peter 3:17- :), rests implicitly on his Creator's faithfulness.
