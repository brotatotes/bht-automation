1. elders—alike in office and
	age (1 Peter 5:5). 
	I . . . also an elder—To
	put one's self on a level with those whom we exhort, gives weight to
	one's exhortations (compare 2 John 1:1;
	2 John 1:2). Peter, in true humility
	for the Gospel's sake, does not put forward his apostleship
	here, wherein he presided over the elders. In the apostleship
	the apostles have no successors, for "the signs of an apostle"
	have not been transmitted. The presidents over the presbyters and
	deacons, by whatever name designated, angel, bishop, or
	moderator, c., though of the same ORDER as the
	presbyters, yet have virtually succeeded to a superintendency of
	the Church analogous to that exercised by the apostles (this
	superintendency and priority existed from the earliest times after
	the apostles [TERTULLIAN])
	just as the Jewish synagogue (the model which the Church followed)
	was governed by a council of presbyters, presided over by one of
	themselves, "the chief ruler of the synagogue." (Compare
	VITRINGA [Synagogue and
	Temple, Part II, chs. 3 and 7]). 
	witness—an eye-witness
	of Christ's sufferings, and so qualified to exhort you to believing
	patience in suffering for well-doing after His example
	(1 Peter 4:19; 1 Peter 2:20).
	This explains the "therefore" inserted in the oldest
	manuscripts, "I therefore exhort," resuming exhortation
	from 1 Peter 4:19. His higher
	dignity as an apostle is herein delicately implied, as
	eye-witnessing was a necessary qualification for apostleship:
	compare Peter's own speeches, Acts 1:21;
	Acts 1:22; Acts 2:32;
	Acts 10:39. 
	also—implying the
	righteous recompense corresponding to the sufferings. 
	partaker of the
	glory—according to Christ's promise; an earnest of which was
	given in the transfiguration.
