2. Feed—Greek, "Tend
	as a shepherd," by discipline and doctrine. Lead, feed, heed: by
	prayer, exhortation, government, and example. The dignity is marked
	by the term "elder"; the duties of the
	office, to tend or oversee, by "bishop."
	Peter has in mind Christ's injunction to him, "Feed (tend)
	My sheep . . . Feed (pasture) My lambs" ( :-). He invites the elders to share with him the same duty
	(compare Acts 20:28). The flock
	is Christ's. 
	which is among you—While
	having a concern for all the Church, your special duty is to
	feed that portion of it "which is among you." 
	oversight—Greek,
	"bishopric," or duty of bishops, that is, overseer. 
	not by constraint—Necessity
	is laid upon them, but willingness prevents it being felt, both in
	undertaking and in fulfilling the duty [BENGEL].
	"He is a true presbyter and minister of the counsel of God who
	doeth and teacheth the things of the Lord, being not accounted
	righteous merely because he is a presbyter, but because righteous,
	chosen into the presbytery" [CLEMENT
	OF ALEXANDRIA]. 
	willingly—One oldest
	manuscript, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic, add, "as
	God would have it to be done" (Acts 20:28- :). 
	not for filthy lucre—
	(Isaiah 56:11; Titus 1:7).
	of a ready mind—promptly
	and heartily, without selfish motive of gain-seeking, as the
	Israelites gave their services willing-heartedly to the
	sanctuary.
