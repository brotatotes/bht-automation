13. For this cause—Seeing ye
	have had such teachers ( :-) [BENGEL], "we
	also (as well as 'all that believe' in Macedonia and Achaia) thank
	God without ceasing ('always' . . . 'in our prayers,'  :-), that when ye received the word of God which ye heard from
	us (literally, 'God's word of hearing from us,' Romans 10:16;
	Romans 10:17), ye accepted it not as
	the word of men, but, even as it is truly, the word of God."
	ALFORD omits the "as"
	of English Version. But the "as" is required by the
	clause, "even as it is truly." "Ye accepted it, not
	(as) the word of men (which it might have been supposed
	to be), but (as) the word of God, even as it really is."
	The Greek for the first "received," implies simply
	the hearing of it; the Greek of the second is "accepted,"
	or "welcomed" it. The proper object of faith, it hence
	appears, is the word of God, at first oral, then for security
	against error, written (John 20:30;
	John 20:31; Romans 15:4;
	Galatians 4:30). Also, that faith is
	the work of divine grace, is implied by Paul's thanksgiving.
effectually worketh also in
	you that believe—"Also," besides your accepting it
	with your hearts, it evidences itself in your lives. It shows its
	energy in its practical effects on you; for instance, working
	in you patient endurance in trial (Galatians 4:30- :; compare Galatians 3:5;
	Galatians 5:6).
