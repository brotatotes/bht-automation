16. Forbidding—Greek,
	"Hindering us from speaking," c. 
	to fill up their sins
	alway—Tending thus "to the filling up (the full measure
	of, Genesis 15:16 Daniel 8:23;
	Matthew 23:32) their sins at all
	times," that is, now as at all former times. Their
	hindrance of the Gospel preaching to the Gentiles was the last
	measure added to their continually accumulating iniquity, which made
	them fully ripe for vengeance. 
	for—Greek,
	"but." "But," they shall proceed no further, for
	(2 Timothy 3:8) "the" divine
	"wrath has (so the Greek) come upon (overtaken
	unexpectedly; the past tense expressing the speedy certainty of the
	divinely destined stroke) them to the uttermost"; not merely
	partial wrath, but wrath to its full extent, "even to the
	finishing stroke" [EDMUNDS].
	The past tense implies that the fullest visitation of wrath was
	already begun. Already in A.D.
	48, a tumult had occurred at the Passover in Jerusalem, when about
	thirty thousand (according to some) were slain; a foretaste of the
	whole vengeance which speedily followed (Luke 19:43;
	Luke 19:44; Luke 21:24).
