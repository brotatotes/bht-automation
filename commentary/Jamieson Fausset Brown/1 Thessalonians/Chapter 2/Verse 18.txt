18. Wherefore—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "Because," or "Inasmuch as." 
	we would—Greek,
	"we wished to come"; we intended to come. 
	even I Paul—My fellow
	missionaries as well as myself wished to come; I can answer for
	myself that I intended it more than once. His slightly
	distinguishing himself here from his fellow missionaries, whom
	throughout this Epistle he associates with himself in the plural,
	accords with the fact that Silvanus and Timothy stayed at Berea when
	Paul went on to Athens; where subsequently Timothy joined him, and
	was thence sent by Paul alone to Thessalonica ( :-). 
	Satan hindered us—On a
	different occasion "the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Jesus"
	(so the oldest manuscripts read), Acts 16:6;
	Acts 16:7, forbad or hindered them
	in a missionary design; here it is Satan, acting perhaps by
	wicked men, some of whom had already driven him out of Thessalonica
	(Acts 17:13; Acts 17:14;
	compare John 13:27), or else by
	some more direct "messenger of Satan—a thorn in the flesh"
	(2 Corinthians 12:7; compare 2 Corinthians 12:7- :). In any event, the Holy Ghost and the providence of God
	overruled Satan's opposition to further His own purpose. We
	cannot, in each case, define whence hindrances in good undertakings
	arise; Paul in this case, by inspiration, was enabled to say;
	the hindrance was from Satan. GROTIUS
	thinks Satan's mode of hindering Paul's journey to Thessalonica was
	by instigating the Stoic and Epicurean philosophers to cavil, which
	entailed on Paul the necessity of replying, and so detained him; but
	he seems to have left Athens leisurely (Acts 17:33;
	Acts 17:34; Acts 18:1).
	The Greek for "hindered" is literally, "to cut
	a trench between one's self and an advancing foe, to prevent his
	progress"; so Satan opposing the progress of the missionaries.
