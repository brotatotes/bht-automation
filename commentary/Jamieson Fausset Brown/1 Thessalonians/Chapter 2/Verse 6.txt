6. Literally, "Nor of men
	(have we been found, 1 Thessalonians 2:5)
	seeking glory." The "of" here represents a different
	Greek word from "of" in the clause "of
	you . . . of others." ALFORD
	makes the former (Greek, "ex") express the
	abstract ground of the glory; the latter (apo) the
	concrete object from which it was to come. The former means
	"originating from"; the latter means "on the part of."
	Many teach heretical novelties, though not for fain, yet for "glory."
	Paul and his associates were free even from this motive [GROTIUS],
	(John 5:44). 
	we might have been
	burdensome—that is, by claiming maintenance (1 Thessalonians 2:9;
	2 Corinthians 11:9; 2 Corinthians 12:16;
	2 Thessalonians 3:8). As, however, "glory"
	precedes, as well as "covetousness," the reference cannot
	be restricted to the latter, though I think it is not
	excluded. Translate, "when we might have borne heavily
	upon you," by pressing you with the weight of self-glorifying
	authority, and with the burden of our sustenance.
	Thus the antithesis is appropriate in the words following, "But
	we were gentle (the opposite of pressing weightily)
	among you" (1 Thessalonians 2:7). On
	weight being connected with authority, compare Note,
	see on 1 Thessalonians 2:7- :, "His letters
	are weighty" (1 Corinthians 4:21).
	ALFORD'S translation,
	which excludes reference to his right of claiming maintenance
	("when we might have stood on our dignity"), seems
	to me disproved by 1 Thessalonians 2:9,
	which uses the same Greek word unequivocally for "chargeable."
	Twice he received supplies from Philippi while at Thessalonica (1 Thessalonians 2:9- :). 
	as the apostles—that
	is, as being apostles.
