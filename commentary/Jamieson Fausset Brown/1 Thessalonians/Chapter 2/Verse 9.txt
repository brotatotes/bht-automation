9. labour and travail—The
	Greek for "labor" means hardship in bearing;
	that for "travail," hardship in doing; the former,
	toil with the utmost solicitude; the latter, the being wearied with
	fatigue [GROTIUS].
	ZANCHIUS refers the former
	to spiritual (see 1 Thessalonians 3:5),
	the latter to manual labor. I would translate, "weariness
	(so the Greek is translated, 1 Thessalonians 3:5- :) and travail" (hard labor, toil). 
	for—omitted in the
	oldest manuscripts. 
	labouring—Greek,
	"working," namely, at tent-making (1 Thessalonians 3:5- :). 
	night and day—The Jews
	reckoned the day from sunset to sunset, so that "night" is
	put before "day" (compare 1 Thessalonians 3:5- :). Their labors with their hands for a scanty livelihood had
	to be engaged in not only by day, but by night also, in the intervals
	between spiritual labors. 
	because we would not be
	chargeable—Greek, "with a view to not
	burdening any of you" (2 Corinthians 11:9;
	2 Corinthians 11:10). 
	preached unto you—Greek,
	"unto and among you." Though but "three Sabbaths"
	are mentioned, Acts 17:2, these
	refer merely to the time of his preaching to the Jews in the
	synagogue. When rejected by them as a body, after having
	converted a few Jews, he turned to the Gentiles; of these (whom he
	preached to in a place distinct from the synagogue) "a great
	multitude believed" (Acts 17:4,
	where the oldest manuscripts read, "of the devout [proselytes]
	and Greeks a great multitude"); then after he had, by labors
	continued among the Gentiles for some time, gathered in many
	converts, the Jews, provoked by his success, assaulted Jason's house,
	and drove him away. His receiving "once and again" supplies
	from Philippi, implies a longer stay at Thessalonica than three weeks
	(Philippians 4:16).
