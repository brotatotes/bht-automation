	he sent Timothy from Athens, whither the latter had followed
	him. However, the "we" favors ALFORD'S
	view that the determination to send Timothy was formed during the
	hasty consultation of Paul, Silas, and Timothy, previous to his
	departure from Berea, and that then he with them "resolved"
	to be "left alone" at Athens, when he should arrive there:
	Timothy and Silas not accompanying him, but remaining at Berea. Thus
	the "I," 1 Thessalonians 3:5, will
	express that the act of sending Timothy, when he arrived at
	Athens, was Paul's, while the determination that Paul should
	be left alone at Athens, was that of the brethren as well as himself,
	at Berea, whence he uses, 1 Thessalonians 3:1,
	"we." The non-mention of Silas at Athens implies that he
	did not follow Paul to Athens as was at first intended; but Timothy
	did. Thus the history, Acts 17:14;
	Acts 17:15, accords with the
	Epistle. The word "left behind" (Greek) implies that
	Timothy had been with him at Athens. It was an act of
	self-denial for their sakes that Paul deprived himself of the
	presence of Timothy at Athens, which would have been so cheering to
	him in the midst of philosophic cavillers; but from love to the
	Thessalonians, he is well content to be left all "alone" in
	the great city.
