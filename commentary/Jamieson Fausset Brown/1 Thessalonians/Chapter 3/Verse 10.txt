10. Night and day—(See on  :-). Night is the season for the saint's holiest meditations and
	prayers (2 Timothy 1:3). 
	praying—connected with,
	"we joy"; we joy while we pray; or else as ALFORD,
	What thanks can we render to God while we pray? The Greek
	implies a beseeching request. 
	exceedingly—literally,
	"more than exceeding abundantly" (compare 2 Timothy 1:3- :). 
	that which is lacking—Even
	the Thessalonians had points in which they needed improvement
	[BENGEL], (2 Timothy 1:3- :). Their doctrinal views as to the nearness of Christ's
	coming, and as to the state of those who had fallen asleep, and their
	practice in some points, needed correction (2 Timothy 1:3- :). Paul's method was to begin by commending what was
	praiseworthy, and then to correct what was amiss; a good pattern to
	all admonishers of others.
