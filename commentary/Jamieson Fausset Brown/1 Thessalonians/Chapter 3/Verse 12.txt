12. The "you" in the
	Greek is emphatically put first; "But" (so
	the Greek for "and") what concerns "YOU,"
	whether we come or not, "may the Lord make you to increase and
	abound in love," c. The Greek for "increase"
	has a more positive force that for "abound" a more
	comparative force, "make you full (supplying 'that
	which is lacking,' 1 Thessalonians 3:10)
	and even abound." "The Lord" may here be the Holy
	Spirit; so the Three Persons of the Trinity will be appealed to
	(compare 1 Thessalonians 3:13), as in 1 Thessalonians 3:13- :. So the Holy Ghost is called "the Lord" (1 Thessalonians 3:13- :). "Love" is the fruit of the Spirit (1 Thessalonians 3:13- :), and His office is "to stablish in holiness"
	(1 Thessalonians 3:13; 1 Peter 1:2).
