13. your hearts—which are
	naturally the spring and seat of unholiness. 
	before God, even our
	Father—rather, "before Him who is at once God and our
	Father." Before not merely men, but Him who will not be deceived
	by the mere show of holiness, that is, may your holiness be such as
	will stand His searching scrutiny. 
	coming—Greek,
	"presence," or "arrival." 
	with all his saints—including
	both the holy angels and the holy elect of men (1 Thessalonians 4:14;
	Daniel 7:10; Zechariah 14:5;
	Matthew 25:31; 2 Thessalonians 1:7).
	The saints are "His" (2 Thessalonians 1:7- :). We must have "holiness" if we are to be numbered
	with His holy ones or "saints." On "unblameable,"
	compare Revelation 14:5. This verse
	(compare 1 Thessalonians 3:12) shows that
	"love" is the spring of true "holiness" (Matthew 5:44-48;
	Romans 13:10; Colossians 3:14).
	God is He who really "stablishes"; Timothy and other
	ministers are but instruments (Colossians 3:14- :) in "stablishing."
