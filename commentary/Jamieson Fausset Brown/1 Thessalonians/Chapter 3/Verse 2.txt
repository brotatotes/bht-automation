2. minister of God and our fellow
	labourer—Some oldest manuscripts read, "fellow workman
	with God"; others, "minister of God." The former is
	probably genuine, as copyists probably altered it to the latter to
	avoid the bold phrase, which, however, is sanctioned by 1 Corinthians 3:9;
	2 Corinthians 6:1. The English Version
	reading is not well supported, and is plainly compounded out of the
	two other readings. Paul calls Timothy "our brother"
	here; but in 1 Corinthians 4:17, "my
	son." He speaks thus highly of one so lately ordained,
	both to impress the Thessalonians with a high respect for the
	delegate sent to them, and to encourage Timothy, who seems to have
	been of a timid character (1 Timothy 4:12;
	1 Timothy 5:23). "Gospel ministers
	do the work of God with Him, for Him, and under
	Him" [EDMUNDS]. 
	establish—Greek,
	"confirm." In 2 Thessalonians 3:3,
	GOD is said to "stablish":
	He is the true establisher: ministers are His "instruments."
	concerning—Greek,
	"in behalf of," that is, for the furtherance of your
	faith. The Greek for "comfort" includes also the
	idea, "exhort." The Thessalonians in their trials needed
	both (1 Thessalonians 3:3; compare 1 Thessalonians 3:3- :).
