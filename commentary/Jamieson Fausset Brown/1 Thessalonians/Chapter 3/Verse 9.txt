9. For what thanks—what
	sufficient thanks? 
	render . . . again—in
	return for His goodness ( :-). 
	for you—"concerning
	you." 
	for all the joy—on
	account of all the joy. It was "comfort,"  :-, now it is more, namely, joy.
for your sakes—on your
	account. 
	before our God—It is a
	joy which will bear God's searching eye: a joy as in the presence of
	God, not self-seeking, but disinterested, sincere, and spiritual
	(compare 1 Thessalonians 2:20; John 15:11).
