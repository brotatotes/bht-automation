14. brethren—This exhortation
	to "warm (Greek, 'admonish,' as in  :-) the unruly (those 'disorderly' persons, 2 Thessalonians 3:6;
	2 Thessalonians 3:11, who would not work, and
	yet expected to be maintained, literally, said of soldiers who will
	not remain in their ranks, compare 2 Thessalonians 3:11- :; also those insubordinate as to Church discipline, in
	relation to those 'over' the Church, 2 Thessalonians 3:11- :), comfort the feeble-minded (the faint-hearted, who
	are ready to sink 'without hope' in afflictions, 2 Thessalonians 3:11- :, and temptations)," applies to all clergy and laity
	alike, though primarily the duty of the clergy (who are meant in 2 Thessalonians 3:11- :)." 
	support—literally, "lay
	fast hold on so as to support." 
	the weak—spiritually.
	Paul practiced what he preached (2 Thessalonians 3:11- :). 
	be patient toward all
	men—There is no believer who needs not the exercise of patience
	"toward" him; there is none to whom a believer ought not to

	more to the great than to the humble; but we ought to show it "toward
	all men" [BENGEL].
	Compare "the long-suffering of our Lord" (2 Corinthians 10:1;
	2 Peter 3:15).
