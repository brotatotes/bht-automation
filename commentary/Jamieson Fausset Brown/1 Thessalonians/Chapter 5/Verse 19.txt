19. Quench notâ€”the Spirit
	being a holy fire: "where the Spirit is, He burns"
	[BENGEL] (Matthew 3:11;
	Acts 2:3; Acts 7:51).
	Do not throw cold water on those who, under extraordinary inspiration
	of the Spirit, stand up to speak with tongues, or reveal mysteries,
	or pray in the congregation. The enthusiastic exhibitions of some
	(perhaps as to the nearness of Christ's coming, exaggerating Paul's
	statement, 2 Thessalonians 2:2, By spirit),
	led others (probably the presiding ministers, who had not always been
	treated with due respect by enthusiastic novices, 2 Thessalonians 2:2- :), from dread of enthusiasm, to discourage the free
	utterances of those really inspired, in the Church assembly. On the
	other hand, the caution (1 Thessalonians 5:21)
	was needed, not to receive "all" pretended revelations as
	divine, without "proving" them.
