10. whoremongers, c.—sinners
	against the seventh commandment. 
	men-stealers—that is,
	slave dealers. The most heinous offense against the eighth
	commandment. No stealing of a man's goods can equal in atrocity the
	stealing of a man's liberty. Slavery is not directly assailed in the
	New Testament to have done so would have been to revolutionize
	violently the existing order of things. But Christianity teaches
	principles sure to undermine, and at last overthrow it, wherever
	Christianity has had its natural development ( :-). 
	liars . . .
	perjured—offenders against the ninth commandment. 
	if there be any other
	thing—answering to the tenth commandment in its widest aspect.
	He does not particularly specify it because his object is to bring
	out the grosser forms of transgression; whereas the tenth is
	deeply spiritual, so much so indeed, that it was by it that the sense
	of sin, in its subtlest form of "lust," Paul tells us ( :-), was brought home to his own conscience. Thus, Paul argues,
	these would-be teachers of the law, while boasting of a higher
	perfection through it, really bring themselves down from the Gospel
	elevation to the level of the grossly "lawless," for whom,
	not for Gospel believers, the law was designed. And in actual
	practice the greatest sticklers for the law as the means of moral
	perfection, as in this case, are those ultimately liable to fall
	utterly from the morality of the law. Gospel grace is the only true
	means of sanctification as well as of justification. 
	sound—healthy,
	spiritually wholesome (1 Timothy 6:3;
	2 Timothy 1:13; Titus 1:13;
	Titus 2:2), as opposed to sickly,
	morbid (as the Greek of "doting" means, Titus 2:2- :), and "canker" (Titus 2:2- :). "The doctrine," or "teaching, which is
	according to godliness" (Titus 2:2- :).
