18. He resumes the subject begun
	at 1 Timothy 1:3. The conclusion
	(apodosis) to the foregoing, "as I besought thee . . .
	charge" (1 Timothy 1:3),
	is here given, if not formally, at least substantially. 
	This charge—namely,
	"that thou in them (so the Greek) mightest war,"
	that is, fulfil thy high calling, not only as a Christian, but as a
	minister officially, one function of which is, to "charge
	some that they teach no other doctrine" (1 Timothy 1:3- :). 
	I commit—as a sacred
	deposit (1 Timothy 6:20; 2 Timothy 2:2)
	to be laid before thy hearers. 
	according to—in
	pursuance of; in consonance with. 
	the prophecies which went
	before on thee—the intimations given by prophets respecting
	thee at thy ordination, 1 Timothy 4:14
	(as, probably, by Silas, a companion of Paul, and "a prophet,"
	Acts 15:32). Such prophetical
	intimation, as well as the good report given of Timothy by the
	brethren (Acts 16:2), may have
	induced Paul to take him as his companion. Compare similar prophecies
	as to others: Acts 13:1-3,
	in connection with laying on of hands; Acts 11:28;
	Acts 21:10; Acts 21:11;
	compare 1 Corinthians 12:10; 1 Corinthians 14:1;
	Ephesians 4:11. In Ephesians 4:11- :, it is expressly said that "the Holy Ghost had
	made them (the Ephesian presbyters) overseers." CLEMENT
	OF ROME [Epistle
	to the Corinthians], states it was the custom of the apostles "to
	make trial by the Spirit," that is, by the "power of
	discerning," in order to determine who were to be overseers and
	deacons in the several churches planted. So CLEMENT
	OF ALEXANDRIA says
	as to the churches near Ephesus, that the overseers were marked out
	for ordination by a revelation of the Holy Ghost to St. John. 
	by them—Greek,
	"in them"; arrayed as it were in them; armed with them. 
	warfare—not the mere
	"fight" (1 Timothy 6:12;
	2 Timothy 4:7), but the whole
	campaign; the military service. Translate as Greek, not
	"a," but "the good warfare."
