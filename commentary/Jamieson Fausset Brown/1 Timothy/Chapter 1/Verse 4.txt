4. fables—legends about the
	origin and propagation of angels, such as the false teachers taught
	at Colosse (Colossians 2:18-23).
	"Jewish fables" (Colossians 2:18-51.2.23- :). "Profane, and old wives' fables" (1 Timothy 4:7;
	2 Timothy 4:4). 
	genealogies—not merely
	such civil genealogies as were common among the Jews, whereby they
	traced their descent from the patriarchs, to which Paul would not
	object, and which he would not as here class with "fables,"
	but Gnostic genealogies of spirits and aeons, as they called them,
	"Lists of Gnostic emanations" [ALFORD].
	So TERTULLIAN [Against
	Valentinian, c. 3], and IRENÆUS
	[Preface]. The Judaizers here alluded to, while maintaining
	the perpetual obligation of the Mosaic law, joined with it a
	theosophic ascetic tendency, pretending to see in it mysteries deeper
	than others could see. The seeds, not the full-grown
	Gnosticism of the post-apostolic age, then existed. This formed the
	transition stage between Judaism and Gnosticism. "Endless"
	refers to the tedious unprofitableness of their lengthy genealogies
	(compare Titus 3:9). Paul opposes
	to their "aeons," the "King of the aeons (so
	the Greek, 1 Timothy 1:17),
	whom be glory throughout the aeons of aeons." The word
	"aeons" was probably not used in the technical sense of the
	latter Gnostics as yet; but "the only wise God" (1 Timothy 1:17- :), by anticipation, confutes the subsequently adopted notions
	in the Gnostics' own phraseology. 
	questions—of mere
	speculation (Acts 25:20), not
	practical; generating merely curious discussions. "Questions and
	strifes of words" (1 Timothy 6:4):
	"to no profit" (1 Timothy 6:4- :); "gendering strifes" (1 Timothy 6:4- :). "Vain jangling" (1 Timothy 1:6;
	1 Timothy 1:7) of would-be "teachers
	of the law." 
	godly edifying—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "the dispensation of God,"
	the Gospel dispensation of God towards man (1 Timothy 1:7- :), "which is (has its element) in faith." CONYBEARE
	translates, "The exercising of the stewardship of God"
	(1 Corinthians 9:17). He infers that the
	false teachers in Ephesus were presbyters, which accords with the
	prophecy, Acts 20:30. However,
	the oldest Latin versions, and IRENÆUS
	and HILARY, support
	English Version reading. Compare Acts 20:30- :, "faith unfeigned."
