5. But—in contrast to the
	doctrine of the false teachers. 
	the end—the aim. 
	the commandment—Greek,
	"of the charge" which you ought to urge on your flock.
	Referring to the same Greek word as in 1 Timothy 1:3;
	1 Timothy 1:18; here, however, in a
	larger sense, as including the Gospel "dispensation
	of God" (see on 1 Timothy 1:4;
	1 Timothy 1:11), which was the sum
	and substance of the "charge" committed to Timothy
	wherewith he should "charge" his flock. 
	charity—LOVE; the sum
	and end of the law and of the Gospel alike, and that wherein the
	Gospel is the fulfilment of the spirit of the law in its every
	essential jot and tittle (1 Timothy 1:11- :). The foundation is faith (1 Timothy 1:11- :), the "end" is love (1 Timothy 1:14;
	Titus 3:15). 
	out of—springing as
	from a fountain. 
	pure heart—a heart
	purified by faith (Acts 15:9;
	2 Timothy 2:22; Titus 1:15).
	good conscience—a
	conscience cleared from guilt by the effect of sound faith in Christ
	(1 Timothy 1:19; 1 Timothy 3:9;
	2 Timothy 1:3; 1 Peter 3:21).
	Contrast 1 Timothy 4:2; Titus 1:15;
	compare Acts 23:1. John uses
	"heart," where Paul would use "conscience." In
	Paul the understanding is the seat of conscience; the heart
	is the seat of love [BENGEL].
	A good conscience is joined with sound faith; a bad conscience with
	unsoundness in the faith (compare Acts 23:1- :). 
	faith unfeigned—not a
	hypocritical, dead, and unfruitful faith, but faith working by love
	(Galatians 5:6). The false teachers
	drew men off from such a loving, working, real faith, to profitless,
	speculative "questions" (Galatians 5:6- :) and jangling (1 Timothy 1:6).
