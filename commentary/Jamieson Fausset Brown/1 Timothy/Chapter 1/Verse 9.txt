9. law is not made for a righteous
	man—not for one standing by faith in the righteousness of
	Christ put on him for justification,and imparted inwardly by the
	Spirit for sanctification. "One not forensically amenable to the
	law" [ALFORD]. For
	sanctification, the law gives no inward power to fulfil it;
	but ALFORD goes too far in
	speaking of the righteous man as "not morally needing the law."
	Doubtless, in proportion as he is inwardly led by the Spirit, the
	justified man needs not the law, which is only an outward rule
	(Romans 6:14; Galatians 5:18;
	Galatians 5:23). But as the justified
	man often does not give himself up wholly to the inward leading of
	the Spirit, he morally needs the outward law to show
	him his sin and God's requirements. The reason why the ten
	commandments have no power to condemn the Christian, is not that they
	have no authority over him, but because Christ has fulfilled
	them as our surety (Romans 10:4). 
	disobedient—Greek,
	"not subject"; insubordinate; it is translated "unruly,"
	Titus 1:6; Titus 1:10;
	"lawless and disobedient" refer to opposers of the law,
	for whom it is "enacted" (so the Greek, for "is
	made"). 
	ungodly and . . .
	sinners—Greek, he who does not reverence God, and
	he who openly sins against Him; the opposers of God,
	from the law comes. 
	unholy and profane—those
	inwardly impure, and those deserving exclusion from the
	outward participation in services of the sanctuary; sinners against
	the third and fourth commandments. 
	murderers—or, as the
	Greek may mean, "smiters" of fathers and . .
	. mothers; sinners against the fifth commandment. 
	manslayers—sinners
	against the sixth commandment.
