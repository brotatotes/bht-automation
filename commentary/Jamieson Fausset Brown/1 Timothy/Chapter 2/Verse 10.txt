10. professing—Greek,
	"promising": engaging to follow. 
	with good works—The
	Greek preposition is not the same as in  :-; "by means of," or "through good
	works." Their adorning is to be effected by means of good
	works: not that they are to be clothed in, or with,
	them (Ephesians 2:10). Works, not
	words in public, is their province (1 Timothy 2:8;
	1 Timothy 2:11; 1 Timothy 2:12;
	1 Peter 3:1). Works are often
	mentioned in the Pastoral Epistles in order to oppose the loose
	living, combined with the loose doctrine, of the false teachers. The
	discharge of everyday duties is honored with the designation, "good
	works."
