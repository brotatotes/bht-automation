14. Adam was not deceived—as
	Eve was deceived by the serpent; but was persuaded by
	his wife. Genesis 3:17, "hearkened
	unto . . . voice of . . . wife." But in Genesis 3:17- :, Eve says, "The serpent beguiled me." Being
	more easily deceived, she more easily deceives [BENGEL],
	(2 Corinthians 11:3). Last in being, she
	was first in sin—indeed, she alone was deceived. The subtle
	serpent knew that she was "the weaker vessel" (2 Corinthians 11:3- :). He therefore tempted her, not Adam. She yielded to the
	temptations of sense and the deceits of Satan; he, to conjugal
	love. Hence, in the order of God's judicial sentence, the serpent,
	the prime offender, stands first; the woman, who was deceived, next;
	and the man, persuaded by his wife, last (2 Corinthians 11:3- :). In Romans 5:12, Adam
	is represented as the first transgressor; but there no reference is
	made to Eve, and Adam is regarded as the head of the sinning race.
	Hence, as here, 1 Timothy 2:11, in 1 Timothy 2:11- :, woman's "subjection" is represented as the
	consequence of her being deceived. 
	being deceived—The
	oldest manuscripts read the compound Greek verb for the
	simple, "Having been seduced by deceit": implying
	how completely Satan succeeded in deceiving her. 
	was in the
	transgression—Greek, "came to be in the
	transgression": became involved in the existing state of
	transgression, literally, "the going beyond a command";
	breach of a positive precept (1 Timothy 2:11- :).
