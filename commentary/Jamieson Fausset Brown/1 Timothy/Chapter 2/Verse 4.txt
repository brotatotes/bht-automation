	he would have saved all in matter of fact; but "will have
	all men to be saved," implies the possibility of man's accepting
	it (through God's prevenient grace) or rejecting it (through man's
	own perversity). Our prayers ought to include all, as God's

	unto the knowledge—Greek,
	"the full knowledge" or "recognition" (See

	the truth—the saving
	truth as it is in, and by, Jesus (John 17:3;
	John 17:17).
