7. Whereunto—For the giving of
	which testimony. 
	I am ordained—literally,
	"I was set": the same Greek, as "putting me,"
	c. (1 Timothy 1:12). 
	preacher—literally,
	"herald" (1 Corinthians 1:21
1 Corinthians 9:27; 1 Corinthians 15:11;
	2 Timothy 1:11; Titus 1:3).
	He recurs to himself, as in Titus 1:3- :, in himself a living pattern or announcement
	of the Gospel, so here "a herald and teacher of (it to) the
	Gentiles" (Galatians 2:9; Ephesians 3:1-12;
	Colossians 1:23). The universality of
	his commission is an appropriate assertion here, where he is arguing
	to prove that prayers are to be made "for all men"
	(1 Timothy 2:1). 
	I speak the truth . . . and
	lie not—a strong asseveration of his universal commission,
	characteristic of the ardor of the apostle, exposed to frequent
	conflict (Romans 11:1; 2 Corinthians 11:13).
	in faith and verity—rather,
	"in the faith and the truth." The sphere in
	which his ministry was appointed to be exercised was the faith
	and the truth (1 Timothy 2:4):
	the Gospel truth, the subject matter of the faith
