9. the mystery of the faithâ€”holding
	the faith, which to the natural man remains a mystery, but
	which has been revealed by the Spirit to them (Romans 16:25;
	1 Corinthians 2:7-10), in a pure
	conscience (1 Timothy 1:5; 1 Timothy 1:19).
	("Pure," that is, in which nothing base or foreign is
	intermixed [TITTMANN]).
	Though deacons were not ordinarily called on to preach (Stephen and
	Philip are not exceptions to this, since it was as evangelists,
	rather than as deacons, they preached), yet as being
	office-bearers in the Church, and having much intercourse with all
	the members, they especially needed to have this characteristic,
	which every Christian ought to have.
