	the Spirit—speaking by
	the prophets in the Church (whose prophecies rested on those of the
	Old Testament, Daniel 7:25; Daniel 8:23;
	Daniel 11:30, as also on those of
	Jesus in the New Testament, Daniel 11:30- :), and also by Paul himself, Daniel 11:30- : (with whom accord 2 Peter 3:3;
	1 John 2:18; Judges 1:18).

	the times following upon the times in which he is now writing.
	Not some remote future, but times immediately subsequent, the
	beginnings of the apostasy being already discernible (Judges 1:18- :): these are the forerunners of "the last days"
	(2 Timothy 3:1).

	earlier), the apostasy of the Jews from God (joining the heathen
	against Christianity) is the groundwork on which the prophecy rises;
	whereas here, in the Pastoral Epistles, the prophecy is connected
	with Gnostic errors, the seeds of which had already been sown in the
	Church [AUBERLEN] (2 Thessalonians 2:3- :). Apollonius Tyanæus, a heretic, came to Ephesus in the
	lifetime of Timothy.

	"the spirit of error," opposed to "the spirit of
	truth," "the Spirit" which "speaketh" in the
	true prophets against them. 
	doctrines of devils—literally
	"teachings of (that is suggested by) demons." 1 John 4:6- :, "wisdom . . . devilish"; 1 John 4:6- :, "Satan's ministers."
