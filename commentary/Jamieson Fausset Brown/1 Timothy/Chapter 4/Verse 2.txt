2. Rather translate, "Through
	(literally, 'in'; the element in which the apostasy has
	place) the hypocrisy of lying speakers"; this expresses the
	means through which "some shall (be led to) depart from
	the faith," namely, the reigned sanctity of the seducers
	(compare "deceivers,"  :-). 
	having their conscience
	searedâ€”Greek, "having their own conscience,"
	c., that is, not only "speaking lies" to others, but
	also having their own conscience seared. Professing to lead
	others to holiness, their own conscience is all the while
	defiled. Bad consciences always have recourse to hypocrisy. As faith
	and a good conscience are joined ( :-) so hypocrisy (that is, unbelief, Matthew 24:5;
	Matthew 24:51; compare Matthew 24:51- :) and a bad conscience here. THEODORET
	explains like English Version, "seared," as implying
	their extreme insensibility; the effect of cauterizing being
	to deaden sensation. The Greek, however, primarily means
	"branded" with the consciousness of crimes committed
	against their better knowledge and conscience, like so many scars
	burnt in by a branding iron: Compare Titus 1:15;
	Titus 3:11, "condemned of
	himself." They are conscious of the brand within, and yet with a
	hypocritical show of sanctity, they strive to seduce others. As "a
	seal" is used in a good sense (Titus 3:11- :), so "a brand" in a bad sense. The image is taken
	from the branding of criminals.
