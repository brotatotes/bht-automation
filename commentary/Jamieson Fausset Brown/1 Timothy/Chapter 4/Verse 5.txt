5. sanctified—"hallowed";
	set apart as holy for the use of believing men: separated from "the
	creature," which is under the bondage of vanity and
	corruption (Romans 8:19, c.).
	Just as in the Lord's Supper, the thanksgiving prayer sanctifies the
	elements, separating them from their naturally alien position in
	relation to the spiritual world, and transferring them to their true
	relation to the new life. So in every use of the creature,
	thanksgiving prayer has the same effect, and ought always to be used
	(1 Corinthians 10:30 1 Corinthians 10:31).
	by the word of God and
	prayer—that is, "by means of intercessory prayer"
	(so the Greek)—that is, consecratory prayer in behalf
	of "the creature" or food—that prayer mainly consisting
	of "the word of God." The Apostolic Constitutions
	[7.49], give this ancient grace, almost wholly consisting of
	Scripture, "Blessed art thou, O Lord, who feedest me from my
	youth, who givest food to all flesh: Fill our hearts with joy and
	gladness, that we, having all sufficiency, may abound unto every good
	work in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom glory, honour, and might,
	be to thee for ever. Amen." In the case of inspired men, "the
	word of God" would refer to their inspired prayers (1 Corinthians 10:31- :); but as Paul speaks in general, including uninspired men's
	thanksgiving for meals, the "word of God" more probably
	refers to the Scripture words used in thanksgiving prayers.
