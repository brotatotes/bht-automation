	ellipsis ought to be supplied, "the younger widows,"
	namely younger widows in general, as distinguished from the older
	widows taken on the roll of presbyteresses ( :-). The "therefore" means seeing that young widows
	are exposed to such temptations, "I will," or "desire,"

	marriage again would not be so requisite; Paul speaks of what is

	reproachfully—literally, "for the sake of reproach"
	(1 Timothy 3:7; 1 Timothy 6:1;
	Titus 2:5; Titus 2:10).
	If the handle were given, the adversary would use it
	for the sake of reproach. The adversary is eager to exaggerate
	the faults of a few, and to lay the blame on the whole Church and its
	doctrines [BENGEL].
