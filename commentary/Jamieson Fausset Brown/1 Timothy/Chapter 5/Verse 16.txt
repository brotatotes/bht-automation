16. If any . . . have widows—of
	his family, however related to him. Most of the oldest manuscripts
	and versions omit "man or," and read, "If any woman
	that believeth." But the Received text seems preferable.
	If, however, the weightiest authorities are to prevail, the
	sense will be: He was speaking of younger widows; He now says, If any
	believing young widow have widows related to her needing support,
	let her relieve them, thereby casing the Church of the burden,
	1 Timothy 5:3; 1 Timothy 5:4
	(there it was the children and grandchildren;
	here it is the young widow, who, in order to avoid the evils
	of idleness and wantonness, the result of idleness,
1 Timothy 5:11; 1 Timothy 5:13;
	Ezekiel 16:49, is to be diligent in
	good works, such as "relieving the afflicted," Ezekiel 16:49- :, thus qualifying herself for being afterwards a
	widow-presbyteress). 
	let them—rather as
	Greek, "let him," or "her"; "let such
	a one" (1 Timothy 5:10). 
	be charged—literally,
	"be burdened" with their support. 
	widows indeed—really
	helpless and friendless (1 Timothy 5:3;
	1 Timothy 5:4).
