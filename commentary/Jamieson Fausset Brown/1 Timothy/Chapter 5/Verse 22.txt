22. Lay hands—that is, ordain
	(1 Timothy 4:14; 2 Timothy 1:6;
	Titus 1:5). The connection is with
	1 Timothy 5:19. The way to guard
	against scandals occurring in the case of presbyters is, be cautious
	as to the character of the candidate before ordaining him; this will
	apply to other Church officers so ordained, as well as to presbyters.
	Thus, this clause refers to 1 Timothy 5:19- :, as next clause, "neither be partaker of other men's
	sins," refers to 1 Timothy 5:20.
	ELLICOTT and WIESINGER
	understand it of receiving back into Church fellowship or
	absolution, by laying hands on those who had been "rebuked"
	(1 Timothy 5:20) and then
	excommunicated (Matthew 18:17);
	1 Timothy 5:20 favors this. But as in
	1 Timothy 4:14; Acts 6:6;
	Acts 13:3; 2 Timothy 1:6,
	the laying on of hands is used of ordination (compare however
	as to confirmation, 2 Timothy 1:6- :), it seems better to take it so here. 
	suddenly—hastily:
	1 Timothy 5:24; 1 Timothy 5:25
	show that waiting for a time is salutary. 
	neither be partaker of other
	men's sins—by negligence in ordaining ungodly candidates, and
	so becoming in some degree responsible for their sins. Or, there is
	the same transition from the elders to all in general
	who may sin, as in 1 Timothy 5:19;
	1 Timothy 5:20. Be not a partaker in
	other men's sins by not "rebuking them that sin before all,"
	as well as those that are candidates for the presbytery, as also all
	"that sin." 
	keep thyself pure—"thyself'
	is emphatic. "Keep THYSELF"
	clear of participation in OTHER
	men's sin by not failing to rebuke them that sin (1 Timothy 5:20- :). Thus the transition is easy to 1 Timothy 5:20- :, which is concerning Timothy personally; compare also
	1 Timothy 5:24.
