14. keep this commandment—Greek,
	"the commandment," that is, the Gospel rule of life

	unrebukeable—agreeing with "thou." Keep the
	commandment and so be without spot," c. "Pure" (1 Timothy 5:22

	until the appearing of . . .
	Christ—His coming in person (2 Thessalonians 2:8;

	times": the Church's true attitude is that of continual
	expectation of her Lord's return (1 Corinthians 1:8;
	Philippians 1:6; Philippians 1:10).
