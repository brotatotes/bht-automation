15. in his times—Greek,
	"His own [fitting] times" ( :-). The plural implies successive stages in the manifestation
	of the kingdom of God, each having its own appropriate time, the
	regulating principle and knowledge of which rests with the Father
	(1 Timothy 2:6; 2 Timothy 1:9;
	Titus 1:3; Hebrews 1:1).
	he shall show—"display":
	an expression appropriate in reference to His "APPEARING,"
	which is stronger than His "coming," and implies its
	visibility; "manifest": make visible (compare
	Acts 3:20): "He" is the
	Father (1 Timothy 6:16). 
	blessed—in Himself: so
	about to be the source of blessing to His people at Christ
	appearing, whence flows their "blessed hope" (1 Timothy 1:11;
	Titus 2:13). 
	only— (John 17:3;
	Romans 16:27; Revelation 15:4).
	King of kings—elsewhere
	applied also to Jesus (Revelation 1:5;
	Revelation 17:14; Revelation 19:16).
