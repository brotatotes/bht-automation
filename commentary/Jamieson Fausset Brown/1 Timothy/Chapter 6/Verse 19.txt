19. Laying up in store—"therefrom
	(that is, by this means [ALFORD];
	but BENGEL makes the Greek
	"apo" mean laying apart against a future time),
	laying up for themselves as a treasure" [ALFORD]
	(Matthew 6:19; Matthew 6:20).
	This is a treasure which we act wisely in laying up in store,
	whereas the wisest thing we can do with earthly treasures is "to
	distribute" them and give others a share of them (Matthew 6:20- :). 
	good foundation—(See on
	1 Timothy 3:13; Luke 6:48;
	1 Corinthians 3:11). The sure reversion of
	the future heavenly inheritance: earthly riches scattered in
	faith lay up in store a sure increase of heavenly riches. We
	gather by scattering (Proverbs 11:24;
	Proverbs 13:7; Luke 16:9).
	that . . . eternal life—The
	oldest manuscripts and versions read, "that which is really
	life," its joys being solid and enduring (Luke 16:9- :). The life that now is cannot be called so, its goods being
	unsubstantial, and itself a vapor (Luke 16:9- :). "In order that ('with their feet so to speak on this
	foundation' [DE WETTE])
	they may lay hold on that which is life indeed."
