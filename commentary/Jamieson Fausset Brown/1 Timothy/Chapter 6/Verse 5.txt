5. Perverse disputings—useless
	disputings. The oldest manuscripts read, "lasting contests"
	[WIESINGER]; "incessant
	collisions" [ALFORD].
	"Strifes of words" had already been mentioned so that he
	would not be likely to repeat the same idea (as in the English
	Version reading) again. 
	corrupt minds—Greek,
	"of men corrupted (depraved) in mind." The inmost source of
	the evil is in the perverted mind (1 Timothy 6:4;
	2 Timothy 3:8; Titus 1:15).
	destitute of the truth—
	(Titus 1:14). They had had the
	truth, but through want of moral integrity and of love of the truth,
	they were misled by a pretended deeper gnosis (knowledge) and higher
	ascetical holiness, of which they made a trade [WIESINGER].
	supposing, c.—The Greek
	requires, "supposing (regarding the matter in this point of
	view) that piety (so translated for 'godliness') is a means of gain
	(that is, a way of advancing one's worldly interests: a different
	Greek form, poriswa, expresses the thing gained,
	gain)" not "that gain is godliness," as English
	Version.
from such withdraw
	thyself—omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The connection with
	1 Timothy 6:6 favors the omission of
	these words, which interrupt the connection.
