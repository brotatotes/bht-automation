1. Timothy our brother—When
	writing to Timothy himself, he calls him "my son"
	(1 Timothy 1:18). Writing of
	him, "brother," and "my beloved son" (1 Timothy 1:18- :). He had been sent before to Macedonia, and had met Paul at
	Philippi, when the apostle passed over from Troas to Macedonia
	(compare 2 Corinthians 2:12; 2 Corinthians 2:13;
	see on 2 Corinthians 2:13- :). 
	in all Achaia—comprising
	Hellas and the Peloponnese. The Gentiles themselves, and Annæus
	Gallio, the proconsul (2 Corinthians 2:13- :), strongly testified their disapproval of the accusation
	brought by the Jews against Paul. Hence, the apostle was enabled to
	labor in the whole province of Achaia with such success as to
	establish several churches there (1 Thessalonians 1:8;
	2 Thessalonians 1:4), where, writing from
	Corinth, he speaks of the "churches," namely, not only the
	Corinthian, but others also—Athens, Cenchrea, and, perhaps, Sicyon,
	Argos, &c. He addresses "the Church in Corinth,"
	directly, and all "the saints" in the province,
	indirectly. In Galatians 1:2 all
	the "churches" are addressed directly in the
	same circular Epistle. Hence, here he does not say, all the
	churches, but "all the saints."
