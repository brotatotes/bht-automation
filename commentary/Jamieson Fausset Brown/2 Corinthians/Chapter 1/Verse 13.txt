13. We write none other things
	(in this Epistle) than what ye read (in my former Epistle [BENGEL];
	present, because the Epistle continued still to be read
	in the Church as an apostolic rule). CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON think Paul had
	been suspected of writing privately to some individuals in the Church
	in a different strain from that of his public letters; and
	translates, "I write nothing else to you but what ye read openly
	(the Greek meaning, 'ye read aloud,' namely, when
	Paul's Epistles were publicly read in the congregation,  :-); yea, and what you acknowledge inwardly." 
	or acknowledge—Greek,
	"or even acknowledge." The Greek for "read"
	and for "acknowledge" are words kindred in sound and root.
	I would translate, "None other things than what ye know by
	reading (by comparing my former Epistle with my present Epistle), or
	even know as a matter of fact (namely, the consistency of my acts
	with my words)." 
	even to the end—of my
	life. Not excluding reference to the day of the Lord (end of
	2 Corinthians 1:14; 1 Corinthians 4:5).
