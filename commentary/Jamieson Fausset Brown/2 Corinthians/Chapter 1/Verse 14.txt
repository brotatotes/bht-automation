14. in part—In contrast to
	"even to the end": the testimony of his life was not
	yet completed [THEOPHYLACT
	and BENGEL]. Rather, "in
	part," that is, some of you, not all [GROTIUS,
	ALFORD]. So in 2 Corinthians 2:5;
	Romans 11:25. The majority at
	Corinth had shown a willing compliance with Paul's directions in the
	first Epistle: but some were still refractory. Hence arises the
	difference of tone in different parts of this Epistle. See
	Romans 11:25- :
your rejoicing—your
	subject of glorying or boast. "Are" (not
	merely shall be) implies the present recognition of one
	another as a subject of mutual glorying: that glorying
	being about to be realized in its fulness "in the day (of the
	coming) of the Lord Jesus."
