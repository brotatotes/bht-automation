20. Rather, How many soever be
	the promises of God, in Him is the "yea" ("faithfulness
	in His word": contrasted with the "yea and nay,"
	2 Corinthians 1:19, that is, inconstancy
	as to one's word). 
	and in him Amen—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "Wherefore through Him is the
	Amen"; that is, In Him is faithfulness ("yea")
	to His word, "wherefore through Him" is the immutable
	verification of it ("Amen"). As "yea" is His
	word, so "Amen" is His oath, which makes our
	assurance of the fulfilment doubly sure. Compare "two immutable
	things (namely, His word and His oath) in which it was impossible for
	God to lie" (Hebrews 6:18;
	Revelation 3:14). The whole range of Old
	Testament and New Testament promises are secure in their fulfilment
	for us in Christ. 
	unto the glory of God by
	us—Greek, "for glory unto God by us" (compare
	2 Corinthians 4:15), that is, by our
	ministerial labors; by us His promises, and His unchangeable
	faithfulness to them, are proclaimed. CONYBEARE
	takes the "Amen" to be the Amen at the close of
	thanksgiving: but then "by us" would have to mean what it
	cannot mean here, "by us and you."
