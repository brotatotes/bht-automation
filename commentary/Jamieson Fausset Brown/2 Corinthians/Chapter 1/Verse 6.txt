6. we . . . afflicted . . . for your
	consolation—exemplifying the communion of saints. Their hearts
	were, so to speak, mirrors reflecting the likenesses of each other
	(Philippians 2:26; Philippians 2:27)
	[BENGEL]. Alike the
	afflictions and the consolations of the apostle tend, as in him so in
	them, as having communion with him, to their consolation (2 Corinthians 1:4;
	2 Corinthians 4:15). The Greek for
	"afflicted" is the same as before, and ought to be
	translated, "Whether we be in tribulation." 
	which is effectual—literally,
	"worketh effectually." 
	in the enduring, &c.—that
	is, in enabling you to endure "the same sufferings which we also
	suffer." Here follows, in the oldest manuscripts (not as English
	Version in the beginning of 2 Corinthians 4:15- :), the clause, "And our hope is steadfast on your
	behalf."
