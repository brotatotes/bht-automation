1. I Paul myself—no longer
	"we," "us," "our" ( :-): I who am represented by depreciators as "base,"
	I, the same Paul, of my own accord "beseech you"; or
	rather "entreat," "exhort" you for your sake.
	As "I beseech you" (a distinct Greek verb,  :-) for my sake.
by the meekness and
	gentleness of Christ—He mentions these graces of Christ
	especially (Psalms 18:35; Matthew 11:29),
	as on account of his imitation of them in particular he was despised
	[GROTIUS]. He entreats
	them by these, in order to show that though he must have recourse to
	more severe measures, he is naturally inclined to gentle ones after
	Christ's example [MENOCHIUS].
	"Meekness" is more in the mind internally; "gentleness"
	in the external behavior, and in relation to others; for instance,
	the condescending yieldingness of a superior to an inferior,
	the former not insisting on his strict rights [TRENCH].
	BENGEL explains it, "By
	the meekness and gentleness derived by me from Christ,"
	not from my own nature: he objects to understanding it of Christ's
	meekness and gentleness, since nowhere else is "gentleness"
	attributed to Him. But though the exact Greek word is not
	applied to Him, the idea expressed by it is (compare Isaiah 40:11;
	Matthew 12:19; Matthew 12:20).
	in presence—in personal
	appearance when present with you. 
	base—Greek,
	"lowly"; timid, humbly diffident: opposed to "bold."
	"Am" stands here by ironical concession for "am
	reputed to be" (compare Matthew 12:20- :).
