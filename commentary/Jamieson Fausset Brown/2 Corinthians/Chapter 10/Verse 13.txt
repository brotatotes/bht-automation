	measure—Greek, "to unmeasured bounds." There
	is no limit to a man's high opinion of himself, so long as he
	measures himself by himself ( :-) and his fellows, and does not compare himself with his
	superiors. It marks the personal character of this Epistle
	that the word "boast" occurs twenty-nine times in it, and
	only twenty-six times in all the other Epistles put together.
	Undeterred by the charge of vanity, he felt he must vindicate his
	apostolic authority by facts [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON]. It would be
	to "boast of things without our measure," were we to boast
	of conversions made by "other men's labors" ( :-).

	to reach—"that we
	should reach as far as even to you": not that he meant to go no
	further (2 Corinthians 10:16; Romans 15:20-24).
	Paul's "measure" is the apportionment of his sphere
	of Gospel labors ruled for him by God. A "rule"
	among the so-called "apostolic canons" subsequently was,
	that no bishop should appoint ministers beyond his own limits. At
	Corinth no minister ought to have been received without Paul's
	sanction, as Corinth was apportioned to him by God as his
	apostolic sphere. The Epistle here incidentally, and therefore
	undesignedly, confirms the independent history, the Acts, which
	represents Corinth as the extreme limit as yet of his preaching, at
	which he had stopped, after he had from Philippi passed southward
	successively through Amphipolis, Apollonia, Thessalonica, Berea, and
	Athens [PALEY, Horæ
	Paulinæ].
