	weapons—for punishing
	offending members (2 Corinthians 10:6;
	1 Corinthians 4:21; 1 Corinthians 5:5;
	1 Corinthians 5:13); boldness of speech,
	ecclesiastical discipline (2 Corinthians 10:8;
	2 Corinthians 13:10), the power of the
	word, and of the sacraments, the various extraordinary gifts of the
	Spirit. 
	carnal—Translate,
	"fleshly," to preserve the allusion to 2 Corinthians 10:2;
	2 Corinthians 10:3. 
	mighty through God—Greek,
	"mighty to God," that is, mighty before God: not humanly,
	but divinely powerful. The power is not ours, but God's. Compare
	"fair to God," that is, divinely fair (2 Corinthians 10:3- :, Margin). Also above (2 Corinthians 10:3- :), "unto God a sweet savor." "The
	efficacy of the Christian religion proves its truth" [BENGEL].
	pulling down—As the
	Greek is the same as in 2 Corinthians 10:3- :, translate, "casting down." Compare 2 Corinthians 10:3- :: the inspired servants of God inherit the commission of the
	Old Testament prophets. 
	strongholds— (2 Corinthians 10:3- :); namely, in which sinners entrench themselves against
	reproof; all that opposes itself to Christ; the learning, and
	eloquence, and philosophical subtleties on which the Corinthians
	prided themselves. So Joshua's trumpet blast was "mighty"
	under God to overthrow the walls of Jericho.
