	"reasonings." Whereas "thought" expresses men's
	own purpose and determination of living after their own
	pleasure [TITTMANN]. 
	high thing—So it ought
	to be translated (Romans 8:39). A
	distinct Greek word from that in Romans 8:39- :, "height," and Romans 8:39- :, which belongs to God and heaven from whence we receive
	nothing hurtful. But "high thing" is not so much "height"
	as something made high, and belongs to those regions of air
	where the powers of darkness ::exalt themselves" against Christ
	and us (Ephesians 2:2; Ephesians 6:12;

	obedience of Christ," that is, to obey Christ. The three steps
	of the apostle's spiritual warfare are: (1) It demolishes what is
	opposed to Christ (2) It leads captive; (3) It brings into obedience
	to Christ (Romans 1:5; Romans 16:26).
	The "reasonings" (English Version, "imaginations")
	are utterly "cast down." The "mental intents"
	(English Version, "thoughts") are taken willing
	captives, and tender the voluntary obedience of faith to Christ the
	Conqueror.
