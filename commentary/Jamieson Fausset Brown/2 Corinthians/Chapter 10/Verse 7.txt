7. Do ye regard mere outward
	appearance (mere external recommendations, personal appearance,
	voice, manner, oratory of teachers present face to face, such
	as they admired in the false teachers to the disparagement of Paul,
	2 Corinthians 10:10; see on 2 Corinthians 10:10- :)? Even in outward bearing when I shall be present
	with you (in contrast to "by letters," 2 Corinthians 10:10- :) I will show that I am more really armed with the authority
	of Christ, than those who arrogate to themselves the title of being
	peculiarly "Christ's" (2 Corinthians 10:10- :). A Jewish emissary seems to have led this party. 
	let him of himself think this
	againâ€”He may "of himself," without needing to be
	taught it in a more severe manner, by "thinking again,"
	arrive at "this" conclusion, "that even as," &c.
	Paul modestly demands for himself only an equal place with those whom
	he had begotten in the Gospel [BENGEL].
