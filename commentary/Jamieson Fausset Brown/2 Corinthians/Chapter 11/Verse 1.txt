1. Would to God—Translate as
	Greek, "I would that." 
	bear with me—I may ask
	not unreasonably to be borne with; not so the false apostles (2 Corinthians 11:4;
	2 Corinthians 11:20). 
	my—not in the oldest
	manuscripts. 
	folly—The Greek
	is a milder term than that for "foolishness" in 1 Corinthians 3:19;
	Matthew 5:22; Matthew 25:2.
	The Greek for "folly" here implies imprudence;
	the Greek for "foolishness" includes the idea of
	perversity and wickedness.
and indeed bear—A
	request (so 2 Corinthians 11:16). But
	the Greek and the sense favor the translation, "But
	indeed (I need not wish it, for) ye do bear with me";
	still I wish you to bear with me further, while I enter at large into
	self-commendations.
