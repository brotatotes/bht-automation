2. For I am jealous—The
	justification of his self-commendations lies in his zealous care lest
	they should fall from Christ, to whom he, as "the friend of the
	Bridegroom" (John 3:29),
	has espoused them; in order to lead them back from the false apostles
	to Christ, he is obliged to boast as an apostle of Christ, in a way
	which, but for the motive, would be "folly." 
	godly jealousy—literally,
	"jealousy of God" (compare John 3:29- :, "godly sincerity," literally, "sincerity of
	God"). "If I am immoderate, I am immoderate to God"
	[BENGEL]. A jealousy which
	has God's honor at heart (John 3:29- :). 
	I . . . espoused you—Paul
	uses a Greek term applied properly to the bridegroom,
	just as he ascribes to himself "jealousy," a feeling
	properly belonging to the husband; so entirely does he identify
	himself with Christ. 
	present you as
	a chaste virgin to Christ—at His coming, when the heavenly
	marriage shall take place (Matthew 25:6;
	Revelation 19:7; Revelation 19:9).
	What Paul here says he desires to do, namely, "present" the
	Church as "a chaste virgin" to Christ, Christ Himself
	is said to do in the fuller sense. Whatever ministers do effectively,
	is really done by Christ (Revelation 19:9- :). The espousals are going on now. He does not say
	"chaste virgins"; for not individual members, but the whole
	body of believers conjointly constitute the Bride.
