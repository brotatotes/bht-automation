21. as concerning reproach—rather,
	"by way of dishonor (that is, self-disparagement) I say
	it." 
	as though we . . . weak—in
	not similarly (2 Corinthians 11:20)
	showing our power over you. "An ironical reminiscence of
	his own abstinence when among them from all these acts of
	self-exaltation at their expense" (as if such abstinence was
	weakness) [ALFORD]. The
	"we" is emphatically contrasted with the false teachers who
	so oppressively displayed their power. I speak so as though WE had
	been weak when with you, because we did not show our power this way.
	Howbeit (we are not really weak; for), whereinsoever any is bold . .
	. I am bold also.
