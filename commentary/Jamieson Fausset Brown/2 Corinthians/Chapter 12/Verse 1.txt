1. He proceeds to illustrate the
	"glorying in infirmities" ( :-). He gave one instance which might expose him to ridicule
	(2 Corinthians 11:33); he now gives
	another, but this one connected with a glorious revelation of which
	it was the sequel: but he dwells not on the glory done to himself,
	but on the infirmity which followed it, as displaying Christ's
	power. The oldest manuscripts read, "I MUST
	NEEDS boast (or glory) though it be not expedient; for
	I will come." The "for" gives a proof that it is "not
	expedient to boast": I will take the case of revelations, in
	which if anywhere boasting might be thought harmless. "Visions"
	refers to things seen: "revelations," to things
	heard (compare 1 Samuel 9:15) or
	revealed in any way. In "visions" their
	signification was not always vouchsafed; in "revelations"
	there was always an unveiling of truths before hidden (Daniel 2:19;
	Daniel 2:31). All parts of Scripture
	alike are matter of inspiration; but not all of revelation.
	There are degrees of revelation; but not of inspiration.
