	mighty deeds—palpable
	works of divine omnipotence. The silence of the apostles in fourteen
	Epistles, as to miracles, arises from the design of those Epistles
	being hortatory, not controversial. The passing allusions to miracles
	in seven Epistles prove that the writers were not enthusiasts to whom
	miracles seem the most important thing. Doctrines were
	with them the important matter, save when convincing adversaries. In
	the seven Epistles the mention of miracles is not obtrusive,
	but marked by a calm air of assurance, as of facts acknowledged on
	all hands, and therefore unnecessary to dwell on. This is a much
	stronger proof of their reality than if they were formally and
	obtrusively asserted. Signs and wonders is the regular formula of the
	Old Testament, which New Testament readers would necessarily
	understand of supernatural works. Again, in the Gospels the miracles
	are so inseparably and congruously tied up with the history, that you
	cannot deny the former without denying the latter also. And then you
	have a greater difficulty than ever, namely, to account for the
	rise of Christianity; so that the infidel has something
	infinitely more difficult to believe than that which he rejects, and
	which the Christian more rationally accepts.
