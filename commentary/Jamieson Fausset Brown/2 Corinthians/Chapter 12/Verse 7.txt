7. exalted above measure—Greek,
	"overmuch uplifted." How dangerous must self-exaltation be,
	when even the apostle required so much restraint! [BENGEL].
	abundance—Greek,
	"the excess"; exceeding greatness. 
	given . . . me—namely,
	by God (Job 5:6; Philippians 1:29).
	thorn in the flesh—
	(Numbers 33:55; Ezekiel 28:24).
	ALFORD thinks it to be the
	same bodily affliction as in Galatians 4:13;
	Galatians 4:14. It certainly was
	something personal, affecting him individually, and not as an
	apostle: causing at once acute pain (as "thorn"
	implies) and shame ("buffet": as slaves are
	buffeted, 1 Peter 2:20). 
	messenger of Satan—who
	is permitted by God to afflict His saints, as Job (Job 2:7;
	Luke 13:16). 
	to buffet me—In Greek,
	present: to buffet me even now continuously. After experiencing
	the state of the blissful angels, he is now exposed to the influence
	of an evil angel. The chastisement from hell follows soon upon the
	revelation from heaven. As his sight and hearing had
	been ravished with heavenly "revelations," so his touch
	is pained with the "thorn in the flesh."
