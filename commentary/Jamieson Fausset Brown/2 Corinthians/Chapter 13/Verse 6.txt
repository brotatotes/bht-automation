6. we . . . not reprobatesâ€”not
	unable to abide the proof to which ye put us ( :-). "I trust that" your own Christianity will be
	recognized by you (observe, "ye shall know,"
	answers to "know your own selves,"  :-) as sufficient "proof" that ye are not reprobates,
	but that "Christ speaks in me," without needing a proof
	from me more trying to yourselves. If ye doubt my apostleship, ye
	must doubt your own Christianity, for ye are the fruits of my
	apostleship.
