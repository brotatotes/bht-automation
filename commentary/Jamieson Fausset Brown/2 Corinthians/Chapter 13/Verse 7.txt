7. I pray—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "we pray." 
	not that we should appear
	approved—not to gain credit for ourselves, your ministers, by
	your Christian conduct; but for your good [ALFORD].
	The antithesis to "reprobates" leads me to prefer
	explaining with BENGEL,
	"We do not pray that we may appear approved,"
	by restraining you when ye do evil; "but that ye should do what
	is right" (English Version, "honest"). 
	though we be as
	reprobates—though we be thereby deprived of the occasion for
	exercising our apostolic power (namely, in punishing), and so may
	appear "as reprobates" (incapable of affording proof
	of Christ speaking in us).
