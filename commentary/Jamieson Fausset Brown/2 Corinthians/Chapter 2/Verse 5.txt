5. grief . . . grieved—Translate
	as before, "sorrow . . . made sorry." The "any"
	is a delicate way of referring to the incestuous person. 
	not . . . me, but in part—He
	has grieved me only in part (compare 2 Corinthians 1:14;
	Romans 11:25), that is, I am not
	the sole party aggrieved; most of you, also, were
	aggrieved. 
	that I may not
	overcharge—that I may not unduly lay the weight of the charge
	on you all, which I should do, if I made myself to be the sole party
	aggrieved. ALFORD
	punctuates, "He hath not made sorry me, but in part (that I
	press not too heavily; namely, on him) you all." Thus "you
	all" is in contrast to "me"; and "in part"
	is explained in the parenthetical clause.
