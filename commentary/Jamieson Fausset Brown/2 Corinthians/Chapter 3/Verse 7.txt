	written and
	engraven in stones—There is no "and" in the Greek.
	The literal translation is, "The ministration of death in
	letters," of which "engraven on stones" is an
	explanation. The preponderance of oldest manuscripts is for the
	English Version reading. But one (perhaps the oldest existing
	manuscript) has "in the letter," which refers to the
	preceding words (2 Corinthians 3:6), "the
	letter killeth," and this seems the probable reading. Even
	if we read as English Version, "The ministration of death
	(written) in letters," alludes to the literal precepts of
	the law as only bringing us the knowledge of sin and "death,"
	in contrast to "the Spirit" in the Gospel bringing
	us "life" (2 Corinthians 3:6- :). The opposition between "the letters" and "the
	Spirit" (2 Corinthians 3:8) confirms
	this. This explains why the phrase in Greek should be "in
	letters," instead of the ordinary one which English Version
	has substituted, "written and."

	"was made (invested) in glory," glory was the atmosphere
	with which it was encompassed.

	behold—literally, "fix their eyes on." 2 Corinthians 3:8- :, "The skin of his face shone; and they were AFRAID
	to come nigh him." "Could not," therefore means
	here, "for FEAR."
	The "glory of Moses' countenance" on Sinai passed away when
	the occasion was over: a type of the transitory character of the
	dispensation which he represented (2 Corinthians 3:8- :), as contrasted with the permanency of the Christian
	dispensation (2 Corinthians 3:11).
