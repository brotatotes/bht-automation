11. we which live—in the power
	of Christ's "life" manifested in us, in our whole man body
	as well as spirit (Romans 8:10;
	Romans 8:11; see on Romans 8:11- :; compare 2 Corinthians 5:15).
	Paul regards his preservation amidst so many exposures to "death,"
	by which Stephen and James were cut off, as a standing miracle (2 Corinthians 5:15- :). 
	delivered unto—not by
	chance; by the ordering of Providence, who shows "the excellency
	of His power" (2 Corinthians 4:7), in
	delivering unto DEATH
	His living saints, that He may manifest LIFE
	also in their dying flesh. "Flesh," the very element of
	decay (not merely their "body"), is by Him made to manifest
	life.
