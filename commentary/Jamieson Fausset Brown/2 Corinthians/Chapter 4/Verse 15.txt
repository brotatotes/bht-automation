	trials and works life in you), being made the greater (multiplied),
	by means of the greater number (of its recipients), may cause the
	thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God." [CHRYSOSTOM]
	(2 Corinthians 1:11 2 Corinthians 9:11;
	2 Corinthians 9:12). The Greek is
	susceptible also of this translation, "That grace, being made
	the greater (multiplied) on account of the thanksgiving of the
	greater number (for grace already received), may abound (abundantly
	redound) to," c. Thus the Greek for "abound"
	has not to be taken in an active sense, but in its ordinary neuter
	sense, and so the other Greek words. Thanksgiving invites more
	abundant grace (2 Chronicles 20:19-22
Psalms 18:3; Psalms 50:23).
