18. look not at—as our aim. 
	things . . . seen—"earthly
	things" (Philippians 3:19). We
	mind not the things seen, whether affliction or refreshment come, so
	as to be seduced by the latter, or deterred by the former
	[CHRYSOSTOM]. 
	things . . . not seen—not
	"the invisible things" of Philippians 3:19- :, but the things which, though not seen now, shall be so
	hereafter. 
	temporal—rather, "for
	a time"; in contrast to eternal. English Version uses
	"temporal" for temporary. The Greek is
	rightly translated in the similar passage, "the pleasures of sin
	for a season."
