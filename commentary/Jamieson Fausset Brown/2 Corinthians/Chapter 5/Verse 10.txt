10. appear—rather, "be
	made manifest," namely, in our true character. So "appear,"
	Greek, "be manifested" ( :-; compare 1 Corinthians 4:5). We
	are at all times, even now, manifest to God; then we shall be
	so to the assembled intelligent universe and to ourselves: for the
	judgment shall be not only in order to assign the everlasting portion
	to each, but to vindicate God's righteousness, so that it shall be
	manifest to all His creatures, and even to the conscience of the
	sinner himself. 
	receive—His reward of
	grace proportioned to "the things done," c. (2 Corinthians 9:6-9
2 John 1:8). Though salvation be of
	grace purely, independent of works, the saved may have a greater or
	less reward, according as he lives to, and labors for, Christ
	more or less. Hence there is scope for the holy "ambition"
	(see on 2 Corinthians 5:9; 2 Corinthians 5:9- :). This verse guards against the Corinthians supposing that
	all share in the house "from heaven" (2 Corinthians 5:1;
	2 Corinthians 5:2). There shall be a
	searching judgment which shall sever the bad from the good, according
	to their respective,deeds, the motive of the deeds being taken
	into account, not the mere external act; faith and love to God are
	the sole motives recognized by God as sound and good (Matthew 12:36;
	Matthew 12:37; Matthew 25:35-45),
	done in his body—The
	Greek may be, "by the instrumentality of the body";
	but English Version is legitimate (compare Greek, Matthew 25:35-40.25.45- :). Justice requires that substantially the same body
	which has been the instrument of the unbelievers' sin, should be the
	object of punishment. A proof of the essential identity of the
	natural and the resurrection body.
