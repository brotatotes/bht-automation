11. terror of the Lord—the
	coming judgment, so full of terrors to unbelievers [ESTIUS].
	ELLICOTT and ALFORD,
	after GROTIUS and BENGEL,
	translate, "The fear of the Lord" (2 Corinthians 7:1;
	Ecclesiastes 12:13; Acts 9:31;
	Romans 3:18; Ephesians 5:21).
	persuade—Ministers
	should use the terrors of the Lord to persuade men, not to
	rouse their enmity (Judges 1:23).
	BENGEL, ESTIUS,
	and ALFORD explain:
	"Persuade men" (by our whole lives, Judges 1:23- :), namely, of our integrity as ministers. But this would have
	been expressed after "persuade," had it been the sense. The
	connection seems as follows: He had been accused of seeking to please
	and win men, he therefore says (compare Judges 1:23- :), "It is as knowing the terror (or fear) of the
	Lord that we persuade men; but (whether men who hear our
	preaching recognize our sincerity or not) we are made manifest unto
	God as acting on such motives (Judges 1:23- :); and I trust also in your consciences." Those so
	"manifested" need have no "terror" as to their
	being "manifested (English Version, 'appear') before the
	judgment-seat" (2 Corinthians 5:10).
