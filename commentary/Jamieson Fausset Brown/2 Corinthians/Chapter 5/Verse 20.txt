20. for Christ . . . in Christ's
	stead—The Greek of both is the same: translate in both
	cases "on Christ's behalf." 
	beseech . . . pray—rather,
	"entreat [plead with you] . . . beseech." Such "beseeching"
	is uncommon in the case of "ambassadors," who generally
	stand on their dignity (compare 2 Corinthians 10:2;
	1 Thessalonians 2:6; 1 Thessalonians 2:7).
	be ye reconciled to
	God—English Version here inserts "ye," which
	is not in the original, and which gives the wrong impression, as if
	it were emphatic thus: God is reconciled to you, be ye
	reconciled to God. The Greek expresses rather, God was the
	RECONCILER in Christ . . .
	let this reconciliation then have its designed effect. Be
	reconciled to God, that is, let God reconcile you to Himself
	(2 Corinthians 5:18; 2 Corinthians 5:19).
