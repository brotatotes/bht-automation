	being burdened: not for
	that—rather, "in that we desire not to have
	ourselves unclothed (of our present body), but clothed upon (with our

	swallowed up of (absorbed and transformed into) life." Believers
	shrink from, not the consequences, but the mere act of
	dying especially as believing in the possibility of their being found
	alive at the Lord's coming ( :-), and so of having their mortal body absorbed into the

	feeling, but subordinates it to higher feeling. Scripture gives no
	sanction to the contempt for the body expressed by philosophers.
