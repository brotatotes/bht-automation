9. Wherefore—with such a sure
	"confidence" of being blessed, whether we die before, or be
	found alive at Christ's coming. 
	we labour—literally,
	"make it our ambition"; the only lawful ambition. 
	whether present or
	absent—whether we be found at His coming present in the body,
	or absent from it. 
	accepted—Greek,
	"well-pleasing."
