15. Belial—Hebrew,
	"worthlessness, unprofitableness, wickedness." As Satan is
	opposed to God, and Antichrist to Christ; Belial being here opposed
	to Christ, must denounce all manner of Antichristian uncleanness
	[BENGEL]. 
	he that believeth with an
	infidel—Translate, "a believer with an unbeliever."
