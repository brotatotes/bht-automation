9. unknown . . . yet well
	known—"unknown" in our true character to those who
	"evil report" of us, "well known" to those who
	hold us in "good report" ( :-). CONYBEARE
	explains, "Unknown by men, yet acknowledged by God"
	(1 Corinthians 13:12). Perhaps both
	God and men (believers) are intended as knowing him (2 Corinthians 5:11;
	2 Corinthians 11:6). 
	dying . . . live—
	(2 Corinthians 1:9; 2 Corinthians 4:10;
	2 Corinthians 4:11; 2 Corinthians 11:23).
	Compare GAUSSEN'S remark,
	see on 2 Corinthians 6:5. "Behold"
	calls attention to the fact as something beyond all expectation. 
	chastened . . . not
	killed—realizing Psalms 118:18.
