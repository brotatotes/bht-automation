10. worketh . . . worketh—In
	the best Greek reading the translation is, "worketh
	(simply) . . . worketh out." "Sorrow" is not
	repentance, but, where it is "godly," "worketh"
	it; that is, contributes or tends to it (the same Greek
	word is in Romans 13:10). The
	"sorrow of the world" (that is, such as is felt by the
	worldly) "worketh out," as its result at last,
	(eternal) death (the same Greek verb is in Romans 13:10- :; also see on 2 Corinthians 4:17).
	repentance . . . not to be
	repented of—There is not in the Greek this play on
	words, so that the word qualified is not "repentance"
	merely, but "repentance unto salvation"; this, he says,
	none will ever regret, however attended with "sorrow"
	at the time. "Repentance" implies a coming to a
	right mind; "regret" implies merely uneasiness of
	feeling at the past or present, and is applied even to the remorse
	of Judas (Matthew 27:3; Greek,
	"stricken with remorse," not as English Version,
	"repented himself"); so that, though always accompanying
	repentance, it is not always accompanied by repentance. "Repentance"
	removes the impediments in the way of "salvation" (to which
	"death," namely, of the soul, is opposed). "The sorrow
	of the world" is not at the sin itself, but at its penal
	consequences: so that the tears of pain are no sooner dried up,
	than the pleasures of ungodliness are renewed. So Pharaoh, Exodus 9:27;
	Exodus 9:28-30; and Saul, Exodus 9:28-2.9.30- :. Compare Isaiah 9:13;
	Revelation 16:10; Revelation 16:11.
	Contrast David's "godly sorrow," Revelation 16:11- :, and Peter's, Matthew 26:75.
