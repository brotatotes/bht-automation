2. Receive us—with enlarged
	hearts (2 Corinthians 6:13). 
	we have wronged . . .
	corrupter . . . defrauded no man—(compare 2 Corinthians 6:13- :). This is the ground on which he asks their reception of
	(making room for) him in their hearts. We wronged none by an
	undue exercise of apostolic authority; 2 Corinthians 6:13- : gives an instance in point. We have corrupted none, namely,
	by beguilements and flatteries, while preaching "another
	Gospel," as the false teachers did (2 Corinthians 11:3;
	2 Corinthians 11:4). We have defrauded none
	by "making a gain" of you (2 Corinthians 11:4- :). Modestly he leaves them to supply the positive
	good which he had done; suffering all things himself that they might
	be benefited (2 Corinthians 7:9; 2 Corinthians 7:12;
	2 Corinthians 12:13).
