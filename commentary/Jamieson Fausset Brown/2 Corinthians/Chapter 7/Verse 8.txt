8. with a letter—Greek,
	"in the letter" namely, the first Epistle to the
	Corinthians. 
	I do not repent, though I did
	repent—Translate, "I do not regret it, though I did
	regret it." The Greek words for regret and
	repent are distinct. Paul was almost regretting, through
	parental tenderness, his having used rebukes calculated to grieve the
	Corinthians; but now that he has learned from Titus the salutary
	effect produced on them, he no longer regrets it. 
	for I perceive, &c.—This
	is explanatory of "I did repent" or "regret it,"
	and is parenthetical ("for I perceive that that Epistle
	did make you sorry, though it was but for a season").
