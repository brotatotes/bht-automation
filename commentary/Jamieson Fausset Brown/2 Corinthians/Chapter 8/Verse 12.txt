12. For—Following up the rule
	"out of that which ye have" ( :-), and no more. 
	a willing mind—rather,
	as Greek, "the readiness," namely, to will,
	referring to 2 Corinthians 8:11. 
	accepted—Greek
	"favorably accepted." 
	according to that a man
	hath—The oldest manuscripts omit "a man." Translate,
	"According to whatsoever it have"; the willing mind,
	or "readiness" to will, is personified [ALFORD].
	Or better, as BENGEL, "He
	is accepted according to whatsoever he have"; so 2 Corinthians 8:11- :, The Lord loveth a cheerful giver." Compare as to
	David, 1 Kings 8:18. God accepts
	the will for the deed. He judges not according to what a man has the
	opportunity to do, but according to what he would do if he had the
	opportunity (compare Mark 14:8;
	and the widow's mite, Luke 21:3;
	Luke 21:4).
