	you—Greek, "fellow worker towards you." 
	our brethren—the two
	mentioned in 2 Corinthians 8:18; 2 Corinthians 8:22.
	messengers—rather, as
	the Greek, "apostles": in the less strict sense (2 Corinthians 8:22- :). 
	of the churches—sent by
	the churches, as we are by the Lord (2 Corinthians 8:22- :). There was in the synagogue an ecclesiastical officer,
