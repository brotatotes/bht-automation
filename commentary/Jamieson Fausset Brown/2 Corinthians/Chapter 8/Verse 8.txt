8. not by commandment—"not
	by way of commandment." 
	but by occasion of the
	forwardness of others, and &c.—rather, "But by
	(mention of) the forwardness of others (as an inducement to you), and
	to prove (literally, 'proving') the sincerity of your love." The
	Greek is "by means of," not "on
	account of the forwardness," &c. BENGEL,
	ELLICOTT, and others
	translate, "By means of the forwardness of others,
	proving the sincerity of your love ALSO."
	The former is the simpler construction in the Greek.
