	of gratuitous love whereby the Lord emptied Himself of His previous
	heavenly glory (Philippians 2:6; Philippians 2:7)

	became poor—Yet this is
	not demanded of you (2 Corinthians 8:14);
	but merely that, without impoverishing yourselves, you should relieve
	others with your abundance. If the Lord did so much more, and at so
	much heavier a cost, for your sakes; much more may you do an act of
	love to your brethren at so little a sacrifice of self. 
	might be rich—in the
	heavenly glory which constitutes His riches, and all other things, so
	far as is really good for us (compare 1 Corinthians 3:21;
	1 Corinthians 3:22).
