10. Translate, as in  :-, "He that ministereth (supplieth) seed to the sower
	and bread for food" (literally, "bread for eating").
	minister—rather future,
	as the oldest manuscripts, "Shall minister (supply) and
	multiply." 
	your seed—your means
	for liberality. 
	the fruits of your
	righteousness—the heavenly rewards for your Christian charity
	(Matthew 10:42). Righteousness
	shall be itself the reward, even as it is the thing rewarded (Hosea 10:12;
	Matthew 5:6; Matthew 6:33).
