If
	there come any
	— as a teacher or brother. The Greek
	is indicative, not subjunctive; implying that such persons do
	actually come,
	and are
	sure to come;
	when any comes, as there will. True love is combined with hearty
	renunciation and separation from all that is false, whether persons
	or doctrines.receive
	him not ... neither bid him God speed
	— This is not said of those who were always aliens from the Church,
	but of those who wish to be esteemed brethren, and subvert the true
	doctrine [Grotius]. The greeting salutation forbidden in the case of
	such a one is that usual
	among Christian brethren
	in those days, not a mere formality, but a token of Christian
	brotherhood.
