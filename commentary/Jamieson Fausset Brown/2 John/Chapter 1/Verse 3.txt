Grace
	be with you
	— One of the oldest manuscripts and several versions have “us”
	for you.
	The Greek
	is literally, “Grace shall
	be
	with us,” that is, with both you
	and me.
	A prayer, however, is implied besides a confident affirmation.grace
	... mercy ... peace
	— “Grace”
	covers the sins of men; “mercy,” their miseries. Grace
	must first do away with man’s guilt before his misery can be
	relieved by mercy.
	Therefore grace
	stands before mercy.
	Peace
	is the result of both, and therefore stands third in order. Casting
	all our care on the Lord, with thanksgiving, maintains this peace.the
	Lord —
	The oldest manuscripts and most of the oldest versions omit “the
	Lord.” John never elsewhere uses this title in his Epistles, but
	“the Son of God.”in
	truth and love
	— The element or sphere in which alone grace,
	mercy,
	and peace,
	have place. He mentions truth
	in  :-;
	love,
	in  :-.
	Paul uses FAITH and love;
	for faith
	and truth
	are close akin.
