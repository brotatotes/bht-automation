	— So one oldest manuscript reads. Other very old manuscripts,

	being seemingly the more difficult reading is less likely to have
	been a transcriber’s alteration. Look that ye lose not the

	full reward
	— of grace not of debt. Fully
	consummated glory. If “which YE have wrought” be read with very
	old authorities, the reward meant is that of their “work (of faith)
	and labor of love.” There are degrees of heavenly reward
	proportioned to the degrees of capability of receiving heavenly
	blessedness. Each vessel of glory hanging on Jesus shall be fully
	happy. But the larger the vessel, the greater will be its capacity
	for receiving heavenly bliss. He who with one pound made ten,
	received authority over ten cities. He who made five pounds received
	five cities; each according to his capacity of rule, and in
	proportion to his faithfulness. Compare  :-.

	people shall fail to receive its reward.
