10. Wherefore—seeking the
	blessed consequence of having, and the evil effects of not having,
	these graces (2 Peter 1:8; 2 Peter 1:9).
	the rather—the more
	earnestly. 
	brethren—marking that
	it is affection for them which constrains him so earnestly to urge
	them. Nowhere else does he so address them, which makes his calling
	them so here the more emphatical. 
	give diligence—The

	to make—Greek
	middle voice; to make so far as it depends on you; to do your
	part towards making. "To make" absolutely and finally

	sure—by ministering additionally in your faith virtue, and
	in your virtue knowledge, c. God must work all these graces in
	us, yet not so that we should be mere machines, but willing
	instruments in His hands in making His election of us "secure."
	The ensuring of our election is spoken of not in
	respect to God, whose counsel is steadfast and everlasting, but in
	respect to our part. There is no uncertainty on His part, but
	on ours the only security is our faith in His promise and the
	fruits of the Spirit (2 Peter 1:5-7
2 Peter 1:11). Peter subjoins
	election to calling, because the calling is the
	effect and proof of God's election, which goes before and is
	the main thing (Romans 8:28; Romans 8:30;
	Romans 8:33, where God's "elect"
	are those "predestinated," and election is "His
	purpose," according to which He "called"
	them). We know His calling before His election, thereby
	calling is put first. 
	fall—Greek,
	"stumble" and fall finally (Romans 8:33- :). Metaphor from one stumbling in a race (Romans 8:33- :).
