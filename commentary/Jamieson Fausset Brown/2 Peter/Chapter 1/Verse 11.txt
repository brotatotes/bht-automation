11. an entrance—rather as
	Greek, "the entrance" which ye look for. 
	ministered—the same
	verb as in 2 Peter 1:5. Minister
	in your faith virtue and the other graces, so shall there be
	ministered to you the entrance into that heaven where these
	graces shine most brightly. The reward of grace hereafter shall
	correspond to the work of grace here. 
	abundantly—Greek,
	"richly." It answers to "abound," 2 Peter 1:5- :. If these graces abound in you, you shall have your
	entrance into heaven not merely "scarcely" (as he had said,
	1 Peter 4:18), nor "so as by
	fire," like one escaping with life after having lost all his
	goods, but in triumph without "stumbling and falling."
