14. shortly I must put offâ€”Greek,
	"the putting off (as a garment) of my tabernacle is speedy":
	implying a soon approaching, and also a sudden death
	(as a violent death is). Christ's words, John 21:18;
	John 21:19, "When thou art
	old," &c., were the ground of his "knowing," now
	that he was old, that his foretold martyrdom was near. Compare as to
	Paul, 2 Timothy 4:6. Though a violent
	death, he calls it a "departure" (Greek for
	"decease," 2 Peter 1:15),
	compare Acts 7:60.
