	your knowledge self-control." In the exercise of Christian

	endurance" amidst sufferings, so much dwelt on in the First
	Epistle, second, third, and fourth chapters. "And in your
	patient endurance godliness"; it is not to be mere stoical
	endurance, but united to [and flowing from] God-trusting
	[ALFORD].
