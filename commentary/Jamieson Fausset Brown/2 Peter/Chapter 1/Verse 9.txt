	Confirming the need of these graces ( :-) by the fatal consequences of the want of them. 
	he that lacketh—Greek,
	"he to whom these are not present." 
	blind—as to the

	and cannot see afar
	off—explanatory of "blind." He closes his eyes
	(Greek) as unable to see distant objects (namely, heavenly
	things), and fixes his gaze on present and earthly things which alone
	he can see. Perhaps a degree of wilfulness in the blindness is
	implied in the Greek, "closing the eyes," which
	constitutes its culpability; hating and rebelling against the light
	shining around him. 
	forgotten—Greek,
	"contracted forgetfulness," wilful and culpable
	obliviousness. 
	that he was purged—The
	continually present sense of one's sins having been once for all
	forgiven, is the strongest stimulus to every grace ( :-). This once-for-all accomplished cleansing of unbelievers
	at their new birth is taught symbolically by Christ,  :-, Greek, "He that has been bathed (once
	for all) needeth not save to wash his feet (of the soils
	contracted in the daily walk), but is clean every whit (in Christ our
	righteousness)." "Once purged (with Christ's blood), we
	should have no more consciousness of sin (as condemning us,  :-, because of God's promise)." Baptism is the sacramental
	pledge of this.
