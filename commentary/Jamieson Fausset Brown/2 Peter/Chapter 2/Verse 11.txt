	greater—than these
	blasphemers. Jude instances Michael ( :-). 
	railing accusation—Greek,
	"blaspheming judgment" ( :-). 
	against them—against
	"dignities," as for instance, the fallen angels: once
	exalted, and still retaining traces of their former power and glory. 
	before the Lord—In the
	presence of the Lord, the Judge, in reverence, they abstain
	from judgment [BENGEL].
	Judgment belongs to God, not the angels. How great is the dignity of
	the saints who, as Christ's assessors, shall hereafter judge angels!
	Meanwhile, railing judgments, though spoken with truth,
	against dignities, as being uttered irreverently, are of the
	nature of "blasphemies" (Greek, 1 Corinthians 4:4;
	1 Corinthians 4:5). If superior angels dare
	not, as being in the presence of God, the Judge, speak evil even of
	the bad angels, how awful the presumption of those who speak evil
	blasphemously of good "dignities." 2 Samuel 16:7;
	2 Samuel 16:8, Shimei; Numbers 16:2;
	Numbers 16:3, Korah, c., referred to
	also in Judges 1:11 Numbers 12:8,
	"Were ye (Aaron and Miriam) not afraid to speak evil of
	My servant Moses?" The angels who sinned still retain the
	indelible impress of majesty. Satan is still "a strong man":
	"prince of this world"; and under him are "principalities,
	powers, rulers of the darkness of this world." We are to avoid
	irreverence in regard to them, not on their account, but on account
	of God. A warning to those who use Satan's name irreverently and in
	blasphemy. "When the ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth his own
	soul."
