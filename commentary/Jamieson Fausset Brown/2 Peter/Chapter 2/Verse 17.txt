17. (Judges 1:12;
	Judges 1:13.) 
	wells—"clouds"
	in Jude; both promising (compare Judges 1:13- :) water, but yielding none; so their "great swelling
	words" are found on trial to be but "vanity" (Judges 1:13- :). 
	clouds—The oldest
	manuscripts and versions read, "mists," dark, and
	not transparent and bright as "clouds" often are, whence
	the latter term is applied sometimes to the saints; fit emblem of the
	children of darkness. "Clouds" is a transcriber's
	correction from Judges 1:12, where
	it is appropriate, "clouds . . . without water" (promising
	what they do not perform); but not here, "mists driven along by
	a tempest." 
	mist—blackness;
	"the chilling horror accompanying darkness"
	[BENGEL].
