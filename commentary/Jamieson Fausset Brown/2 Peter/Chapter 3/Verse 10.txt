10. The certainty, suddenness,
	and concomitant effects, of the coming of the day of the Lord. FABER
	argues from this that the millennium, c., must precede
	Christ's literal coming, not follow it. But "the day of
	the Lord" comprehends the whole series of events, beginning with
	the pre-millennial advent, and ending with the destruction of the
	wicked, and final conflagration, and general judgment (which last
	intervenes between the conflagration and the renovation of the
	earth). 
	will—emphatical. But
	(in spite of the mockers, and notwithstanding the delay) come and
	be present the day of the Lord SHALL.
	as a thief—Peter
	remembers and repeats his Lord's image (Luke 12:39
Luke 12:41) used in the
	conversation in which he took a part; so also Paul (Luke 12:41- :) and John (Revelation 3:3;
	Revelation 16:15). 
	the heavens—which the
	scoffers say' shall "continue" as they are (2 Peter 3:4;
	Matthew 24:35; Revelation 21:1).
	with a great noise—with
	a rushing noise, like that of a whizzing arrow, or the crash
	of a devouring flame. 
	elements—the
	component materials of the world [WAHL].
	However, as "the works" in the earth are mentioned
	separately from "the earth," so it is likely by "elements,"
	mentioned after "the heavens," are meant "the works
	therein," namely, the sun, moon, and stars (as THEOPHILUS
	OF ANTIOCH [p. 22,
	148, 228]; and JUSTIN
	MARTYR [Apology,
	2.44], use the word "elements"): these, as at creation, so
	in the destruction of the world, are mentioned [BENGEL].
	But as "elements" is not so used in Scripture Greek,
	perhaps it refers to the component materials of "the
	heavens," including the heavenly bodies; it clearly
	belongs to the former clause, "the heavens," not to the
	following, "the earth," &c. 
	melt—be dissolved, as
	in 2 Peter 3:11. 
	the works . . . therein—of
	nature and of art.
