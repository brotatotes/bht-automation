12. hasting unto—with the
	utmost eagerness desiring [WAHL],
	praying for, and contemplating, the coming Saviour as at hand. The
	Greek may mean "hastening (that is, urging onward
	[ALFORD]) the day of God";
	not that God's eternal appointment of the time is changeable, but God
	appoints us as instruments of accomplishing those events which
	must be first before the day of God can come. By praying for His
	coming, furthering the preaching of the Gospel for a witness to all
	nations, and bringing in those whom "the long-suffering of God"
	waits to save, we hasten the coming of the day of God. The
	Greek verb is always in New Testament used as neuter (as
	English Version here), not active; but the Septuagint
	uses it actively. Christ says, "Surely I come quickly.
	Amen." Our part is to speed forward this
	consummation by praying, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus" ( :-). 
	the coming—Greek,
	"presence" of a person: usually, of the
	Saviour. 
	the day of God—God has
	given many myriads of days to men: one shall be the great "day
	of God" Himself. 
	wherein—rather as
	Greek, "on account of (or owing to) which"
	day. 
	heavens—the upper and
	lower regions of the sky. 
	melt—Our igneous rocks
	show that they were once in a liquid state.
