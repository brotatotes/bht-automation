	. . . is salvation—is designed for the salvation of those yet
	to be gathered into the Church: whereas those scoffers "count it
	(to be the result of) slackness" on the Lord's part ( :-). 
	our beloved brother Paul—a
	beautiful instance of love and humility. Peter praises the very
	Epistles which contain his condemnation. 
	according to the wisdom given
	unto him—adopting Paul's own language,  :-, "According to the grace of God which is given
	unto me as a wise master-builder." Supernatural and
	inspired wisdom "GIVEN"

	aorist, "wrote," as a thing wholly past: Paul was by
	this time either dead, or had ceased to minister to them. 
	to you—Galatians,
	Ephesians, Colossians, the same region as Peter addresses.
	Compare "in peace,"  :-, a practical exhibition of which Peter now gives in showing
	how perfectly agreeing Paul (who wrote the Epistle to the Galatians)
	and he are, notwithstanding the event recorded ( :-). Colossians 3:4 refers to
	Christ's second coming. The Epistle to the Hebrews, too
	(addressed not only to the Palestinian, but also secondarily to the
	Hebrew Christians everywhere), may be referred to, as Peter primarily
	(though not exclusively) addresses in both Epistles the Hebrew
	Christians of the dispersion (see on Colossians 3:4- :). Hebrews 9:27; Hebrews 9:28;
	Hebrews 10:25; Hebrews 10:37,
	"speak of these things" (Hebrews 10:37- :) which Peter has been handling, namely, the coming of the
	day of the Lord, delayed through His "long-suffering," yet
	near and sudden.
