6. Wherebyâ€”Greek, "By
	which" (plural). By means of which heavens and earth (in
	respect to the WATERS
	which flowed together from both) the then world perished
	(that is, in respect to its occupants, men and animals, and
	its then existing order: not was annihilated); for in
	the flood "the fountains of the great deep were broken up"
	from the earth (1) below, and "the windows of heaven"
	(2) above "were opened." The earth was deluged by that
	water out of which it had originally risen.
