10. "When He shall have
	come." 
	glorified in his saints—as
	the element and mirror IN
	which His glory shall shine brightly ( :-). 
	admired in all them that
	believe—Greek, "them that believed."
	Once they believed, now they see: they had taken His
	word on trust. Now His word is made good and they need faith no
	longer. With wonder all celestial intelligences ( :-) shall see and admire the Redeemer on account of the
	excellencies which He has wrought in them. 
	because, c.—Supply for
	the sense, among whom (namely, those who shall be found to have
	believed) you, too, shall be "because our testimony unto
	(so the Greek for 'among') you was believed" (and was not
	rejected as by those "who obey not the Gospel,"  :-). The early preaching of the Gospel was not abstract
	discussions, but a testimony to facts and truths
	experimentally known (Luke 24:48;
	Acts 1:8). Faith is defined
	by BISHOP PEARSON
	as "an assent unto truths, credible upon the testimony of God,
	delivered unto us by the apostles and prophets" (originally
	delivering their testimony orally, but now in their writings).
	"Glorified in His saints" reminds us that holiness
	is glory in the bud; glory is holiness
	manifested.
