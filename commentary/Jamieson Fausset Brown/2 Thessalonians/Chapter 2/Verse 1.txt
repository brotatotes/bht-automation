1. Now—rather, "But";
	marking the transition from his prayers for them to entreaties
	to them. 
	we beseech you—or
	"entreat you." He uses affectionate entreaty, rather than
	stern reproof, to win them over to the right view. 
	by—rather, "with
	respect to"; as the Greek for "of" ( :-). 
	our gathering together unto
	him—the consummating or final gathering together of the saints
	to Him at His coming, as announced, Matthew 24:31;
	1 Thessalonians 4:17. The Greek noun
	is nowhere else found except in 1 Thessalonians 4:17- :, said of the assembling together of believers for
	congregational worship. Our instinctive fears of the judgment
	are dispelled by the thought of being gathered together UNTO
	HIM ("even as the hen
	gathereth her chickens under her wings"), which ensures our
	safety.
