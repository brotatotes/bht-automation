3. by any means—Greek,
	"in any manner." Christ, in  :-, gives the same warning in connection with the same event.
	He had indicated three ways ( :-) in which they might be deceived (compare other ways, 2 Thessalonians 2:9;
	Matthew 24:5; Matthew 24:24).
	a falling away—rather
	as the Greek, "the falling away," or
	"apostasy," namely, the one of which "I told
	you" before (2 Thessalonians 2:5),
	"when I was yet with you," and of which the Lord gave some
	intimation (Matthew 24:10-12;
	John 5:43). 
	that man of sin be
	revealed—The Greek order is, "And there have been
	revealed the man of sin." As Christ was first in mystery,
	and afterwards revealed (John 5:43- :), so Antichrist (the term used 1 John 2:18;
	1 John 4:3) is first in mystery, and
	afterwards shall be developed and revealed (1 John 4:3- :). As righteousness found its embodiment in Christ, "the
	Lord our righteousness," so "sin" shall have its
	embodiment in "the man of sin." The hindering power
	meanwhile restrains its manifestation; when that shall be removed,
	then this manifestation shall take place. The articles, "the
	apostasy," and "the man of sin," may also refer
	to their being well known as foretold in Daniel 7:8;
	Daniel 7:25, "the little horn
	speaking great words against the Most High, and thinking to change
	times and laws"; and Daniel 7:25- :, the wilful king who "shall exalt and magnify himself
	above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of
	gods; neither shall he regard any god." 
	the son of perdition—a
	title applied besides to Judas (the traitor, Daniel 7:25- :), and to none else. Antichrist (the second "beast"
	coming up out of the earth); therefore he shall at first be "like
	a lamb, while he speaks as a dragon" (Daniel 7:25- :); "coming in peaceably and by flatteries,"
	"working deceitfully," but "his heart shall be against
	the holy covenant" (Daniel 11:21;
	Daniel 11:23; Daniel 11:28;
	Daniel 11:30). Seeds of "the
	falling away" soon appear (Daniel 11:30- :), but the full development and concentration of these
	anti-Christian elements in one person are still to appear. Contrast
	the King of Zion's coming as JESUS:
	(1) righteous or just; (2) having salvation; (3) lowly;
	whereas Antichrist is: (1) "the man of (the embodiment of) sin;
	(2) the son of perdition; (3) exalting himself above
	all that is worshipped. He is the son of perdition, as
	consigning many to it, and finally doomed to it himself (Revelation 17:8;
	Revelation 17:11). "He whose
	essence and inheritance is perdition" [ALFORD].
	As "the kingdom of heaven" is first brought before
	us in the abstract, then in the concrete, the King, the Lord
	Jesus; so here, first we have (Revelation 17:11- :) "the mystery of iniquity," then "the
	iniquitous one" (Revelation 17:11- :). Doubtless "the apostasy" of Romanism (the
	abstract) is one of the greatest instances of the working of the
	mystery of iniquity, and its blasphemous claims for the Pope (the
	concrete) are forerunners of the final concentration of blasphemy in
	the man of sin, who shall not merely, as the Pope, usurp God's
	honor as vicegerent of God, but oppose God openly at
	last.
