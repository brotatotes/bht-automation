10. For even—Translate, "For
	also." We not only set you the example, but gave a
	positive "command." 
	commanded—Greek
	imperfect, "We were commanding"; we kept charge of you. 
	would not work—Greek,
	"is unwilling to work." BENGEL
	makes this to be the argument: not that such a one is to have his
	food withdrawn from him by others; but he proves from the necessity
	of eating the necessity of working; using this
	pleasantry, Let him who will not work show himself an angel,
	that is, do without food as the angels do (but since he cannot do
	without food, then he ought to be not unwilling to work). It seems to
	me simpler to take it as a punishment of the idle. Paul often quotes
	good adages current among the people, stamping them with inspired
	approval. In the Hebrew, "Bereshith Rabba,"
	the same saying is found; and in the book Zeror, "He who
	will not work before the sabbath, must not eat on the sabbath."
