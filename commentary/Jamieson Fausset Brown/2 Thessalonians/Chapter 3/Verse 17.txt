17. The Epistle was written by
	an amanuensis (perhaps Silas or Timothy), and only the closing
	salutation written by Paul's "own hand" (compare Romans 16:22;
	1 Corinthians 16:21; Colossians 4:18).
	Wherever Paul does not subjoin this autograph salutation, we may
	presume he wrote the whole Epistle himself (Colossians 4:18- :). 
	which—which
	autograph salutation. 
	the token—to
	distinguish genuine Epistles from spurious ones put forth in my name
	(2 Thessalonians 2:2). 
	in every epistle—Some
	think he signed his name to every Epistle with his own hand; but as
	there is no trace of this in any manuscripts of all the
	Epistles, it is more likely that he alludes to his writing with
	his own hand in closing every Epistle, even in those Epistles
	(Romans, Second Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, First
	Thessalonians) wherein he does not specify his having done so. 
	so I write—so I sign my
	name: this is a specimen of my handwriting, by which to
	distinguish my geniune letters from forgeries.
