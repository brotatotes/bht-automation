3. faithful—alluding to
	"faith" (2 Thessalonians 3:2):
	though many will not believe, the Lord (other very old manuscripts
	read "God") is still to be believed in as faithful to His
	promises (1 Thessalonians 5:24; 2 Timothy 2:13).
	Faith on the part of man answers to faithfulness on the part
	of God. 
	stablish you—as he had
	prayed (2 Thessalonians 2:17). Though it
	was on himself that wicked men were making their onset, he turns away
	from asking the Thessalonians' prayers for HIS
	deliverance (2 Thessalonians 3:2: so
	unselfish was he, even in religion), to express his assurance of
	THEIR establishment in the
	faith, and preservation from evil. This assurance thus exactly
	answers to his prayer for them (2 Thessalonians 3:2- :), "Our Lord . . . stablish you in every good
	word and work." He has before his mind the Lord's Prayer, "Lead
	us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil"; where, as
	here, the translation may be, "from the evil one"; the
	great hinderer of "every good word and work." Compare 2 Thessalonians 3:2- :, "the wicked one."
