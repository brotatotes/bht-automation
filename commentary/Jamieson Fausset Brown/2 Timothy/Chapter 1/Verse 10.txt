	abolished death—Greek,
	"taken away the power from death" [TITTMANN].
	The Greek article before "death" implies that Christ
	abolished death, not only in some particular instance, but in its
	very essence, being, and idea, as well as in all its aspects and
	consequences (John 11:26; Romans 8:2;
	Romans 8:38; 1 Corinthians 15:26;
	1 Corinthians 15:55; Hebrews 2:14).
	The carrying out of the abolition of death into full effect is to be
	at the resurrection (Revelation 20:14).
	The death of the body meanwhile is but temporary, and is made no
	account of by Christ and the apostles.

	the Gospel, which brings to light the life and immortality
	purposed by God from eternity, but manifested now first to man by
	Christ, who in His own resurrection has given the pledge of His
	people's final triumph over death through Him. Before the Gospel
	revelation from God, man, by the light of nature, under the most
	favorable circumstances, had but a glimmering idea of the possibility
	of a future being of the soul, but not the faintest idea of
	the resurrection of the body (Acts 17:18;
	Acts 17:32). If Christ were not
	"the life," the dead could never live; if He were not the
	resurrection, they could never rise; had He not the keys of hell and
	death (Revelation 1:18), we could never
	break through the bars of death or gates of hell [BISHOP
	PEARSON].
