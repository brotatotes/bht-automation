2. my dearly beloved sonâ€”In
	1 Timothy 1:2; Titus 1:4,
	written at an earlier period than this Epistle, the expression used
	is in the Greek, "my genuine son." ALFORD
	sees in the change of expression an intimation of an altered tone as
	to Timothy, more of mere love, and less of confidence, as though Paul
	saw m him a want of firmness, whence arose the need of his stirring
	up afresh the faith and grace in Him (Titus 1:4- :). But this seems to me not justified by the Greek word
	agapetos, which implies the attachment of reasoning and
	choice, on the ground of merit in the one "beloved,"
	not of merely instinctive love. See TRENCH
	[Greek Synonyms of the New Testament].
