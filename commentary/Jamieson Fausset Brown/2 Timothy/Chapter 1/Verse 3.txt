3. I thank—Greek, "I
	feel gratitude to God." 
	whom I serve from my
	forefathers—whom I serve ( :-) as did my forefathers. He does not mean to put on the
	same footing the Jewish and Christian service of God; but simply to
	assert his own conscientious service of God as he had received it
	from his progenitors (not Abraham, Isaac, c., whom he calls
	"the fathers," not "progenitors" as the Greek
	is here Romans 9:5). The memory of
	those who had gone before to whom he is about to be gathered, is now,
	on the eve of death, pleasant to him; hence also, he calls to mind
	the faith of the mother and grandmother of Timothy; as he walks in
	the faith of his forefathers (Acts 23:1;
	Acts 24:14; Acts 26:6;
	Acts 26:7; Acts 28:20),
	so Timothy should persevere firmly in the faith of his parent and
	grandparent. Not only Paul, but the Jews who reject Christ, forsake
	the faith of their forefathers, who looked for Christ; when they
	accept Him, the hearts of the children shall only be returning to the
	faith of their forefathers (Malachi 4:6;
	Luke 1:17; Romans 11:23;
	Romans 11:24; Romans 11:28).
	Probably Paul had, in his recent defense, dwelt on this topic,
	namely, that he was, in being a Christian, only following his
	hereditary faith.
that . . . I have remembrance
	of thee—"how unceasing I make my mention
	concerning thee" (compare Romans 11:28- :). The cause of Paul's feeling thankful is, not that he
	remembers Timothy unceasingly in his prayers, but for what Timothy is
	in faith (2 Timothy 1:5) and graces;
	compare Romans 1:8; Romans 1:9,
	from which supply the elliptical sentence thus, "I thank God
	(for thee, for God is my witness) whom I serve . . . that (or how)
	without ceasing I have remembrance (or make mention) of thee,"
	&c.
