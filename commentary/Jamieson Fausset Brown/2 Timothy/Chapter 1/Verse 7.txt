7. For, c.—implying that
	Timothy needed the exhortation "to stir up the gift of God in
	him," being constitutionally "timid": "For God
	did not give us (so the Greek, namely, at our
	ordination or consecration) the spirit of fear." The
	spirit which He gave us, was not the spirit of timidity (literally,
	"cowardice," which is weakness), but of "power"
	(exhibited in a fearless "testimony" for Christ,  :-). "Power is the invariable accompaniment of the gift of
	the Holy Ghost. Luke 24:49
Acts 1:8; compare Acts 1:8- :, "full of faith and of the Holy Ghost," with
	2 Timothy 1:8, "full of faith and
	power." Fear is the result of "the spirit of
	bondage" (Romans 8:15). Fear
	within exaggerates the causes of fear without. "The
	spirit of power" is the spirit of man dwelt in by the Spirit of
	God imparting power; this power "casteth out fear"
	from ourselves, and stimulates us to try to cast it out of others
	(1 John 4:18). 
	love—which moves the
	believer while "speaking the truth" with power, when
	giving his testimony for Christ (1 John 4:18- :), at the same time to do so "in love" (1 John 4:18- :). 
	a sound mind—The Greek,
	is rather, "the bringing of men to a sound mind" [WAHL].
	BENGEL supports English
	Version, "a sound mind," or "sober-mindedness";
	a duty to which a young man like Timothy especially needed to be
	exhorted (2 Timothy 2:22; 1 Timothy 4:12;
	Titus 2:4; Titus 2:6).
	So Paul urges him, in 2 Timothy 2:4,
	to give up worldly entanglements, which as thorns (2 Timothy 2:4- :) choke the word. These three gifts are preferable to any
	miraculous powers whatever.
