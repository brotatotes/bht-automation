10. Therefore—Because of the
	anxiety I feel that the Gospel should be extended; that anxiety being
	implied in 2 Timothy 2:9. 
	endure—not merely "I
	passively suffer," but "I actively and perseveringly
	endure," and "am ready to endure patiently all
	things." 
	the elect's sakes—for
	the sake of the Church: all the members of Christ's spiritual body
	(Colossians 1:24). 
	they . . . also—as well
	as myself: both God's elect not yet converted and those already so. 
	salvation . . . glory—not
	only salvation from wrath, but glory in reigning
	with Him eternally (2 Timothy 2:12).
	Glory is the full expansion of salvation (Acts 2:47;
	Romans 8:21-24; Romans 8:30;
	Hebrews 9:28). So grace and
	glory (Psalms 84:12).
