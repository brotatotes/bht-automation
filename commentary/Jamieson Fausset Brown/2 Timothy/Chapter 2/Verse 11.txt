11. Greek, "Faithful
	is the saying." 
	Forâ€”"For" the
	fact is so that, "if we be dead with Him (the Greek
	aorist tense implies a state once for all entered into in past
	times at the moment of regeneration, Romans 6:3;
	Romans 6:4; Romans 6:8;
	Colossians 2:12), we shall also live
	with Him." The symmetrical form of "the saying," Colossians 2:12- :, and the rhythmical balance of the parallel clauses,
	makes it likely, they formed part of a Church hymn (see on Colossians 2:12- :), or accepted formula, perhaps first uttered by some of the
	Christian "prophets" in the public assembly (Colossians 2:12- :). The phrase "faithful is the saying," which
	seems to have been the usual formula (compare 1 Timothy 1:15;
	1 Timothy 3:1; 1 Timothy 4:9;
	Titus 3:8) in such cases, favors
	this.
