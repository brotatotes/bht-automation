13. believe notâ€”"If we
	are unbelievers (literally, 'unfaithful'), He remains faithful"
	(Deuteronomy 7:9; Deuteronomy 7:10).
	The oldest manuscripts read, "For He cannot (it is an
	impossibility that He should) deny Himself." He
	cannot be unfaithful to His word that He will deny those who deny
	Him, though we be not faithful to our profession of faith in
	Him (Romans 3:3). Three things are
	impossible to God, to die, to lie, and to be deceived [AUGUSTINE,
	The Creed, 1.1], (Hebrews 6:18).
	This impossibility is not one of infirmity, but of infinite power and
	majesty. Also, indirectly, comfort is suggested to believers, that He
	is faithful to His promises to them; at the same time that apostates
	are shaken out of their self-deceiving fancy, that because they
	change, Christ similarly may change. A warning to Timothy to be
	steadfast in the faith.
