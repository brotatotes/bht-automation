15. Study—Greek, "Be
	earnest," or "diligent." 
	to show—Greek,
	"present," as in Romans 12:1.
	thyself—as
	distinguished from those whom Timothy was to charge (Romans 12:1- :). 
	approved—tested by
	trial: opposed to "reprobate" (Romans 12:1- :). 
	workman—alluding to Romans 12:1- :, c. 
	not to be ashamed—by
	his work not being "approved" (Romans 12:1- :). Contrast "deceitful workers" (Romans 12:1- :). 
	rightly dividing—"rightly
	handling" [Vulgate] "rightly administering"
	[ALFORD]; literally,
	cutting "straight" or "right": the metaphor being
	from a father or a steward (1 Corinthians 4:1)
	cutting and distributing bread among his children
	[VITRINGA and CALVIN],
	(Luke 12:42). The Septuagint,
Proverbs 3:6; Proverbs 11:5,
	use it of "making one's way": so BENGEL
	here takes Paul to mean that Timothy may make ready a straight way
	for "the word of truth," and may himself walk straight
	forward according to this line, turning neither to the right nor to
	the left, "teaching no other doctrine" (Proverbs 11:5- :). The same image of a way appears in the Greek
	for "increase" (see on Proverbs 11:5- :). The opposite to "rightly handling," or
	"dispensing," is, Proverbs 11:5- :, "corrupt the word of God." 
	truth—Greek,
	"the truth" (compare Proverbs 11:5- :).
