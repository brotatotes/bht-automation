19. Nevertheless—Notwithstanding
	the subversion of their faith, "the firm foundation of
	God standeth" fast (so the Greek ought to be
	translated). The "foundation" here is "the Church"
	[ALFORD], "the
	ground" or basement support "of the truth" ( :-), Christ Himself being the ultimate "foundation"
	(1 Corinthians 3:11). In the steadfast
	standing of the Church there is involved the steadfast
	certainty of the doctrine in question (1 Corinthians 3:11- :). Thus the "house" (1 Corinthians 3:11- :) answers to the "foundation"; it is made up of the
	elect whom "the Lord knoweth" (acknowledgeth, recognizes,
	Psalms 1:6; Matthew 7:23;
	John 10:14; 1 Corinthians 8:3)
	as "His," and who persevere to the end, though others "err
	concerning the faith" (Matthew 24:24;
	John 10:28; Romans 8:38;
	Romans 8:39; 1 John 2:19).
	BENGEL takes "the
	foundation" to be the immovable faithfulness of God (to
	His promises to His elect [CALVIN]).
	This contrasts well with the erring from the faith on the part
	of the reprobate, 2 Timothy 2:18.
	Though they deny the faith, God abates not His
	faithfulness (compare 2 Timothy 2:18- :). 
	having—seeing that it
	has [ELLICOTT]. 
	seal—"inscription":
	indicating ownership and destination: inscriptions were
	often engraven on a "foundation" stone (2 Timothy 2:18- :) [ALFORD]. This
	will agree with the view that "the foundation" is the
	Church (Ephesians 2:20). If it be
	taken God's immovable faithfulness, the "seal" will
	be regarded as attached to His covenant promise, with the inscription
	or legend, on one side of its round surface, "The Lord knoweth
	(it is 'knew' in the Septuagint, Ephesians 2:20- :, to which Paul here alludes, altering it for his purpose by
	the Spirit) them that are His"; on the observe side, "Let
	every one that nameth (as his Lord, Ephesians 2:20- :, or preacheth in His name, Ephesians 2:20- :) Christ." 
	depart—Greek,
	"stand aloof." 
	from iniquity— (Ephesians 2:20- :). In both clauses there may be an allusion to Numbers 16:5;
	Numbers 16:26, Septuagint.
	God's part and man's part are marked out. God chooseth and knoweth
	His elect; our part is to believe, and by the Spirit depart from all
	iniquity, an unequivocal proof of our being the Lord's (compare
	Deuteronomy 29:29; Luke 13:23-27).
	St. Lucian when asked by his persecutors, "Of what country art
	thou?" replied, "I am a Christian." "What is your
	occupation? . . . I am a Christian." "Of what family? . . .
	I am a Christian." [CHRYSOSTOM,
	Orations, 75]. He cannot be honored with the name Christian,
	who dishonors by iniquity, Christ, the Author of the name. Blandina's
	refreshment amidst her tortures was to say, "I am a Christian,
	and with us Christians no evil is done" [EUSEBIUS,
	Ecclesiastical History, 5.1]. Apostasy from the faith is sure
	soon to be followed by indulgence in iniquity. It was so with the
	false teachers (2 Timothy 3:2-8;
	2 Timothy 3:13).
