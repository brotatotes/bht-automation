25. instructing—Greek,
	"disciplining," instructing with correction, which
	those who deal in "uninstructive" or "undisciplined
	questions" need (see on  :-;  :-). 
	those that oppose
	themselves—Greek, "oppositely affected"; those
	of a different opinion. 
	if . . . peradventure—Greek,
	"if at any time." 
	repentance—which they
	need as antecedent to the full knowledge (so the Greek
	for 'acknowledgment') of the truth" ( :-), their minds being corrupted ( :-), and their lives immoral. The cause of the spiritual
	ignorance which prompts such "questions" is moral, having
	its seat in the will, not in the intellect ( :-). Therefore repentance is their first need. That, not man,
	but God alone can "give" ( :-).
