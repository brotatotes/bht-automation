	"awake to soberness," namely from the spiritual
	intoxication whereby they have fallen into the snare of the devil.

	taken captive by him at his
	will—so as to follow the will of "THAT"
	(the Greek emphatically marks Satan thus) foe. However,
	different Greek pronouns stand for "him" and "his";
	and the Greek for "taken captive" means not
	"captured for destruction," but "for being
	saved alive," as in 1 Timothy 6:9- :, "Thou shalt catch men to save them unto life";
	also there is no article before the Greek participle, which
	the English Version "who are taken captive," would
	require. Therefore, translate, "That they may awake . . . taken
	as saved (and willing) captives by him (the servant of the Lord, 1 Timothy 6:9- :), so as to follow the will of HIM
	(the Lord, 2 Timothy 2:24, or "God,"
	2 Timothy 2:25)." There are here
	two evils, the "snare" and sleep, from which they
	are delivered: and two goods to which they are translated, awaking
	and deliverance. Instead of Satan's thrall comes the free and willing
	captivity of obedience to Christ (2 Timothy 2:25- :). It is God who goes before, giving repentance (2 Timothy 2:25- :); then the work of His servant following is sure to be
	crowned with success, leading the convert henceforth to "live to
	the will of God" (Acts 22:14;
	1 Peter 4:2).
