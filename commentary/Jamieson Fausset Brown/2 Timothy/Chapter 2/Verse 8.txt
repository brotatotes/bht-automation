	"Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead." Remember
	Christ risen, so as to follow Him. As He was raised after death, so
	if thou wouldest share His risen "life," thou must now

	Saviour, and our permanent interest in Him as such. Christ's
	resurrection is put prominently forward as being the truth now

	seed of David" (compare 1 Timothy 1:4- :), imply that the words were probably part of a recognized
	short oral creed. In His death He assured us of His humanity; by His
	resurrection, of His divinity. That He was not crucified for His
	own sin appears from His resurrection; that He was crucified
	shows that He bore sin, on Him, though not in Him.
