13. Reason why persecutions must
	be expected, and these becoming worse and worse as the end
	approaches. The breach between light and darkness, so far from being
	healed, shall be widened [ALFORD].
	evil men—in contrast to
	the "godly" (2 Timothy 3:12).
	seducers—literally,
	"conjurers." Magical arts prevailed at Ephesus (2 Timothy 3:12- :), and had been renounced by many Ephesians on embracing
	Christianity: but now when Paul was writing to Ephesus, symptoms of a
	return to conjuring tricks appeared: an undesigned coincidence
	[BURTON]. Probably sorcery
	will characterize the final apostasy (Revelation 13:15;
	Revelation 18:23; Revelation 22:15).
	wax worse—literally,
	"advance in the direction of worse" (see on Revelation 22:15- :). Not contradictory to that verse: there the diffusion
	of the evil was spoken of; here its intensity [ALFORD].
	deceiving, and being
	deceived—He who has once begun to deceive others, is the less
	easily able to recover himself from error, and the more easily
	embraces in turn the errors of others [BENGEL].
