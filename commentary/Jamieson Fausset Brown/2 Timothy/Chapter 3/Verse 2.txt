2. men—in the professing
	Church. Compare the catalogue,  :-, c., where much the same sins are attributed to heathen men
	it shall be a relapse into virtual heathendom, with all its
	beast-like propensities, whence the symbol of it is "a beast"
	(Revelation 13:1; Revelation 13:11;
	Revelation 13:12; Revelation 17:3;
	Revelation 17:8; Revelation 17:11).
	covetous—Translate,
	"money-loving," a distinct Greek word from that for
	"covetous" (see on Revelation 17:11- :).
	The cognate Greek substantive (Revelation 17:11- :) is so translated, "the love of money is a
	(Greek, not 'the') root of all evil." 
	boasters—empty boasters
	[ALFORD]; boasting of
	having what they have not. 
	proud—overweening:
	literally, showing themselves above their fellows. 
	blasphemous—rather,
	"evil-speakers," revilers. 
	disobedient to parents—The
	character of the times is even to be gathered especially from the
	manners of the young [BENGEL].
	unthankful—The
	obligation to gratitude is next to that of obedience to
	parents.
unholy—irreligious
	[ALFORD]; inobservant of
	the offices of piety.
