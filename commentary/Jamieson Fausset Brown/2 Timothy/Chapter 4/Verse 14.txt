14. Alexander the coppersmith—or
	"smith" in general. Perhaps the same as the Alexander (see
	on  :-) at Ephesus.
	Excommunicated then he subsequently was restored, and now vented his
	personal malice because of his excommunication in accusing Paul
	before the Roman judges, whether of incendiarism or of introducing a
	new religion. See my  :-
	He may have been the Alexander put forward by the Jews in the tumult
	at Ephesus (Acts 19:33; Acts 19:34).
	reward—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "shall reward," or "requite
	him." Personal revenge certainly did not influence the apostle
	(2 Timothy 4:16, end).
