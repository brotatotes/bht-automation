	at my trial, "might hear" the Gospel proclaimed then. Rome
	was the capital of the Gentile world, so that a proclamation of the
	truth to the Romans was likely to go forth to the rest of the Gentile
	world. 
	I was delivered out of the
	mouth of the lion—namely, Satan, the roaring, devouring lion
	(Luke 22:31; 1 Peter 5:8).
	I was prevented falling into his snare (2 Timothy 2:26;
	Psalms 22:21; 2 Peter 2:9);
	2 Timothy 4:18 agrees with this
	interpretation, "The Lord shall deliver me from every
	evil work," namely, both from evil and the evil one, as the
	Greek of the Lord's Prayer expresses it. It was not
	deliverance from Nero (who was called the lion) which he
	rejoiced in, for he did not fear death (2 Timothy 4:18- :), but deliverance from the temptation, through fear, to
	deny His Lord: so ALFORD.
