5. I am no longer here to
	withstand these things; be thou a worthy successor of me, no longer
	depending on me for counsel, but thine own master, and swimming
	without the corks [CALVIN];
	follow my steps, inherit their result, and the honor of their end
	[ALFORD]. 
	watch thou—literally,
	"with the wakefulness of one sober." 
	in all things—on all
	occasions and under all circumstances ( :-).

	hardships [ALFORD]. 
	evangelist—a missionary
	bishop preacher, and teacher. 
	make full proof of—fulfil
	in all its requirements, leaving nothing undone (Acts 12:25;
	Romans 15:19; Colossians 4:17).
