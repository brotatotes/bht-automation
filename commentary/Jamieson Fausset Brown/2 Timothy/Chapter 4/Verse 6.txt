6. Greek, "For I am
	already being offered"; literally, as a libation;
	appropriate to the shedding of his blood. Every sacrifice
	began with an initiatory libation on the victim's head (compare Note,
	see on  :-). A motive to
	stimulate Timothy to faithfulness—the departure and final
	blessedness of Paul; it is the end that crowns the work [BENGEL].
	As the time of his departure was indicated to Peter, so to Paul ( :-). 
	my departure—literally,
	"loosing anchor" (see on  :-). Dissolution.
