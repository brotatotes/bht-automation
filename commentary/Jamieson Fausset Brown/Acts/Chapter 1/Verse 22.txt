22. Beginning from the baptism of
	John—by whom our Lord was not only Himself baptized, but first
	officially announced and introduced to his own disciples. 
	unto that same day when he
	was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of
	his resurrection—How clearly is the primary office of the
	apostles here expressed: (1) to testify, from personal observation,
	to the one great fact of "the resurrection of the Lord Jesus";
	(2) to show how this glorified His whole previous life, of which they
	were constant observers, and established His divine claims.
