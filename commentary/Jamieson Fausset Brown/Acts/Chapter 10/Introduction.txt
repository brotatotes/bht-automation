 CHAPTER 10 
	
 :-. ACCESSION AND
	BAPTISM OF CORNELIUS
	AND HIS PARTY;
	OR, THE
	FIRST-FRUITS OF THE
	GENTILES. 
	We here enter on an entirely new
	phase of the Christian Church, the "opening of the door of faith
	to the Gentiles"; in other words, the recognition of Gentile, on
	terms of perfect equality with Jewish, discipleship without the
	necessity of circumcision. Some beginnings appear to have been
	already made in this direction (see on  :-); and Saul probably acted on this principle from the
	first, both in Arabia and in Syria and Cilicia. But had he been the
	prime mover in the admission of uncircumcised Gentiles into the
	Church, the Jewish party, who were never friendly to him, would have
	acquired such strength as to bring the Church to the verge of a
	disastrous schism. But on Peter, "the apostle" specially
	"of the circumcision," was conferred the honor of
	initiating this great movement, as before of the first admission of
	Jewish believers. (See on  :-).
	After this, however, one who had already come upon the stage was to
	eclipse this "chiefest of the apostles."
