2. A devout man, c.—an
	uncircumcised Gentile proselyte to the Jewish faith, of whom there
	were a very great number at this time a distinguished proselyte, who
	had brought his whole household establishment under the hallowing
	influence of the Jewish faith and the regular observance of its
	principal seasons of worship. 
	gave much alms to the
	people—that is, the Jewish people, on the same principle
	as another centurion before him ( :-); thinking it no "great thing," if they had "sown
	unto him spiritual things, that they should reap his carnal things"
	(1 Corinthians 9:11). 
	prayed to God alway—at
	the stated daily seasons. (See on 1 Corinthians 9:11- :).
