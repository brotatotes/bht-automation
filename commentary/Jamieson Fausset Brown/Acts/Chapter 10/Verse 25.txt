25-29. as Peter was coming in,
	Cornelius met him—a mark of the highest respect. 
	fell down at his feet, and
	worshipped him—In the East this way of showing respect was
	customary not only to kings, but to others occupying a superior
	station; but among the Greeks and Romans it was reserved for the
	gods. Peter, therefore, declines it as due to no mortal [GROTIUS].
	"Those who claim to have succeeded Peter, have not imitated
	this part of his conduct" [ALFORD]
	(therein only verifying 2 Thessalonians 2:4,
	and compare Revelation 19:10; Revelation 22:9).
