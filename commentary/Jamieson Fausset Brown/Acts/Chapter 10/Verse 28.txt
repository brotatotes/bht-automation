28. Ye know it is . . . unlawful . .
	. for . . . a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another
	nation, &c.â€”There was no express prohibition to this
	effect, and to a Certain extent intercourse was certainly kept up.
	(See the Gospel history, towards the end). But intimate social
	fellowship was not practiced, as being adverse to the spirit of the
	law.
