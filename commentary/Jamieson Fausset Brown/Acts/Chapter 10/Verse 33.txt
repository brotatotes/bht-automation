33. we are all here present before
	God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God—Beautiful
	expression of entire preparedness to receive the expected divine
	teaching through the lips of this heaven-commissioned teacher, and
	delightful encouragement to Peter to give free utterance to what was
	doubtless already on his lips!
