14. Who shall tell thee words
	whereby thou and all thy house shall be savedâ€”The historian
	makes the angel express this much more generally ( :-). So also the subsequent report of it by the deputies and by
	Cornelius himself to Peter (Acts 10:22;
	Acts 10:32). But as Peter tarried
	with Cornelius certain days, and they doubtless talked over the
	wonderful scene together, perhaps this fuller and richer form of what
	the angel said was given to Peter; or the apostle himself may have
	expressed what the angel certainly designed by
	directing them to send for him. Observe, "salvation" is
	here made to hang upon "words," that is, the Gospel
	message concerning Christ. But on the "salvation" of
	Cornelius, see on Acts 11:1.
	On that of his "house," see on Acts 11:1- :.
