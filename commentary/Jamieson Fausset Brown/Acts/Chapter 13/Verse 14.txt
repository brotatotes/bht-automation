14. departed from Perga—apparently
	without making any stay or doing any work: compare the different
	language of Acts 14:25, and see
	immediately below. 
	came to Antioch in
	Pisidia—usually so called, to distinguish it from Antioch in
	Syria, from which they had started, though it actually lies in
	Phrygia, and almost due north from Perga. It was a long journey, and
	as it lay almost entirely through rugged mountain passes, while
	"rivers burst out at the base of huge cliffs, or dash down
	wildly through narrow ravines," it must have been a perilous
	one. The whole region was, and to this day is, infested by robbers,
	as ancient history and modern travels abundantly attest; and there
	can be but little doubt that to this very journey Paul many years
	after alludes, when he speaks amidst his "journeyings often,"
	of his "perils of rivers" (as the word is), and his
	"perils of robbers" (Acts 14:25- :). If this journey were taken in May—and earlier than that
	the passes would have been blocked up with snow—it would account
	for their not staying at Perga, whose hot streets are then deserted;
	"men, women, and children, flocks, herds, camels, and asses, all
	ascending at the beginning of the hot season from the plains to the
	cool basin-like hollows on the mountains, moving in the same
	direction with our missionaries" [HOWSON].
