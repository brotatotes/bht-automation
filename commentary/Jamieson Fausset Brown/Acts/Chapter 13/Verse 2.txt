	Lord—The word denotes the performance of official duties
	of any kind, and was used to express the priestly functions under the
	Old Testament. Here it signifies the corresponding ministrations of
	the Christian Church. 
	and fasted—As this was
	done in other cases on special occasions (Acts 13:3;
	Acts 13:14; Acts 13:23),

	some of the prophets mentioned in Acts 13:23- :.

	for the work whereunto I have
	called them—by some communication, perhaps, to themselves: in
	the case of Saul at least, such a designation was indicated from the

	the personality of the Holy Ghost is manifest from this
	language, His supreme divinity will appear equally so by
	comparing it with Hebrews 5:4.
