23-25. Of this man's seed hath God,
	according to . . . promise, raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus—The
	emphasis on this statement lies: (1) in the seed from which
	Christ sprang—David's—and the promise to that effect,
	which was thus fulfilled; (2) on the character in which this
	promised Christ was given of God—"a SAVIOUR."
	His personal name "JESUS"
	is emphatically added, as designed to express that very character.
