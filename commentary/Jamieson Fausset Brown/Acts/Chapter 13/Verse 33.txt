33. God hath fulfilled the
	same—"hath completely fulfilled." 
	in that he hath raised up
	Jesus again—literally, "raised up"; but the meaning
	is (notwithstanding the contrary opinion of many excellent
	interpreters) "from the dead"; as the context
	plainly shows. 
	as it is written in the
	second psalm—in many manuscripts "the first Psalm";
	what we call the first being regarded by the ancient Jews as only an
	introduction to the Psalter, which was considered to begin with the
	second. 
	this day have I begotten
	thee—As the apostle in Romans 1:4
	regards the resurrection of Christ merely as the manifestation
	of a prior Sonship, which he afterwards (Romans 1:4- :) represents as essential, it is plain that this is
	his meaning here. (Such declarative meaning of the verb "to
	be" is familiar to every reader of the Bible). See Romans 1:4- :, "So shall ye be," that is, be seen to be
	"My disciples." It is against the whole sense of the New
	Testament to ascribe the origin of Christ's Sonship to His
	resurrection.
