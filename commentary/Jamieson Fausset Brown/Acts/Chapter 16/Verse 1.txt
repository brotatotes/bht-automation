1-5. Then came he to Derbe and
	Lystra; and, behold, a certain disciple was there—that is, at
	Lystra (not Derbe, as some conclude from  :-). 
	named Timotheus—(See on
	Acts 16:1). As Paul styles him
	"his own son in the faith" (Acts 16:1- :), he must have been gained to Christ at the apostle's first
	visit; and as Paul says he "had fully known his persecutions
	which came on him at Lystra" (2 Timothy 3:10;
	2 Timothy 3:11), he may have been in
	that group of disciples that surrounded the apparently lifeless body
	of the apostle outside the walls of Lystra, and that at a time of

	already been attested (1 Timothy 1:18;
	1 Timothy 4:14); and though some ten
	years after this Paul speaks of him as still young (1 Timothy 4:14- :), "he was already well reported of by the brethren that
	were at Lystra and Iconium" (1 Timothy 4:14- :), and consequently must have been well known through all
	that quarter. 
	but his father was a
	Greek—Such mixed marriages, though little practiced, and
	disliked by the stricter Jews in Palestine, must have been very
	frequent among the Jews of the dispersion, especially in remote
	districts, where but few of the scattered people were settled
