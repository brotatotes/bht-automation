	Troas, we came—literally, "ran." 
	with a straight course—that
	is, "ran before the wind." 
	to Samothracia—a lofty
	island on the Thracian coast, north from Troas, with an inclination
	westward. The wind must have set in strong from the south or
	south-southeast to bring them there so soon, as the current is strong
	in the opposite direction, and they afterwards took five days to what
	they now did in two (Acts 20:6)
	[HOWSON]. 
	next day
	to Neapolis—on the Macedonian, or rather Thracian, coast, about
	sixty-five miles from Samothracia, and ten from Philippi, of which it
	is the harbor.
