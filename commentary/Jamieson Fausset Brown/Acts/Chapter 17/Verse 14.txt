14. immediately the brethren—the
	converts gathered at Berea. 
	sent away Paul—as
	before from Jerusalem (Acts 9:30),
	and from Thessalonica (Acts 17:10).
	How long he stayed at Berea we know not; but as we know that he
	longed and expected soon to return to the Thessalonians (Acts 17:10- :), it is probable he remained some weeks at least, and only
	abandoned his intention of revisiting Thessalonica at that time when
	the virulence of his enemies there, stimulated by his success at
	Berea, brought them down thither to counterwork him. 
	to go as it were to the
	sea—rather, perhaps, "in the direction of the sea."
	Probably he delayed fixing his next destination till he should reach
	the coast, and the providence of God should guide him to a vessel
	bound for the destined spot. Accordingly, it was only on arriving at
	Athens, that the convoy of Berean brethren, who had gone thus far
	with him, were sent back to bid Silas and Timothy follow him thither.
	Silas and Timotheus abode
	there still—"to build it up in its holy faith, to be a
	comfort and support in its trials and persecutions, and to give it
	such organization as might be necessary" [HOWSON].
	Connecting this with the apostle's leaving Timothy and Luke at
	Philippi on his own departure (see on Acts 17:10- :), we may conclude that this was his fixed plan for
	cherishing the first beginning of the Gospel in European localities,
	and organizing the converts. Timotheus must have soon followed the
	apostle to Thessalonica, the bearer, probably, of one of the
	Philippian "contributions to his necessity" (Philippians 4:15;
	Philippians 4:16), and from thence he
	would with Silas accompany him to Berea.
