22. Then Paul stood . . . and
	said—more graphically, "standing in the midst of Mars'

	I perceive that in all things
	ye are too superstitious—rather (with most modern interpreters
	and the ancient Greek ones), "in all respects extremely
	reverential" or "much given to religious worship," a
	conciliatory and commendatory introduction, founded on his own
	observation of the symbols of devotion with which their city was
	covered, and from which all Greek writers, as well as the apostle,
	inferred the exemplary religiousness of the Athenians. (The
	authorized translation would imply that only too much
	superstition was wrong, and represents the apostle as repelling his
	hearers in the very first sentence; whereas the whole discourse is
	studiously courteous).
