25. Neither is worshipped
	with—ministered unto, served by 
	men's hands, as though he
	needed anything—No less familiar as this thought also is to us,
	even from the earliest times of the Old Testament (Job 35:6;
	Job 35:8; Psalms 16:2;
	Psalms 16:3; Psalms 50:12-14;
	Isaiah 40:14-18), it would
	pour a flood of light upon any candid heathen mind that heard it. 
	seeing he—He Himself. 
	giveth to all life, and
	breath, and all things—The Giver of all cannot surely be
	dependent for aught upon the receivers of all (Isaiah 40:14-23.40.18- :). This is the culminating point of a pure Theism.
