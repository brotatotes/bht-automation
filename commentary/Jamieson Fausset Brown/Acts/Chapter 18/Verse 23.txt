	went over all . . . Galatia
	and Phrygia in order—visiting the several churches in
	succession. See on Acts 18:1.
	Galatia is mentioned first here, as he would come to it first from
	Antioch. It was on this visitation that he ordained the weekly
	collection (1 Corinthians 16:1; 1 Corinthians 16:2),

	usage throughout Christendom. Timotheus and Erastus, Gaius and
	Aristarchus, appear to have accompanied him on this journey (Acts 19:22;
	Acts 19:29; 2 Corinthians 1:1),
	and from Second Corinthians we may presume, Titus also. The details
	of this visit, as of the former (2 Corinthians 1:1- :), are not given.

	This is one of the most
