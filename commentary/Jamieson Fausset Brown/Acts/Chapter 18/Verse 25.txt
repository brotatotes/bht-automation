	way of the Lord . . . knowing only the baptism of John—He was
	instructed, probably, by some disciple of the Baptist, in the whole
	circle of John's teaching concerning Jesus, but no more: he had yet
	to learn the new light which the outpouring of the Spirit at
	Pentecost had thrown upon the Redeemer's death and resurrection; as
	appears from Acts 19:2; Acts 19:3.
	being fervent in the
	spirit—His heart warm, and conscious, probably, of his gifts
	and attainments, he burned to impart to others the truth he had
	himself received. 
	he spake and taught
	diligently—rather, "accurately" (it is the same word
	as is rendered "perfectly" in Acts 19:3- :).
