8. Crispus, the chief ruler of the
	synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house—an event
	felt to be so important that the apostle deviated from his usual
	practice (1 Corinthians 1:14-16)
	and baptized him, as well as Caius (Gaius) and the household of
	Stephanas, with his own hand [HOWSON].
	many of the Corinthians . . .
	believed and were baptized—The beginning of the church gathered
	there.
