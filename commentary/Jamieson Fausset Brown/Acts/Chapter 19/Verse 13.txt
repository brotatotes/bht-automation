13. vagabond Jews—simply,
	"wandering Jews," who went from place to place practicing
	exorcism, or the art of conjuring evil spirits to depart out of the
	possessed. That such a power did exist, for some time at least, seems
	implied in Matthew 12:27. But no
	doubt this would breed imposture; and the present case is very
	different from that referred to in Luke 9:49;
	Luke 9:50. 
	We adjure you by Jesus whom
	Paul preacheth—a striking testimony to the power of Christ's
	name in Paul's mouth.
