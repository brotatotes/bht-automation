 CHAPTER 20 
	
 :-. PAUL FULFILS
	HIS PURPOSE
	OF PROCEEDING AGAIN
	TO MACEDONIA AND
	GREECE—RETURNING
	THENCE, ON HIS
	ROUTE FOR JERUSALEM,
	HE REVISITS
	PHILIPPI AND TROAS—HIS
	MINISTRATIONS AT TROAS.
	 
	This section of the apostle's
	life, though peculiarly rich in material, is related with great
	brevity in the History. Its details must be culled from his own
	Epistles.
