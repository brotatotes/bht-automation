21. Testifying both to Jews and . .
	. Greeks—laboring under a common malady, and recoverable only
	by a common treatment. 
	repentance toward God, and
	faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ—(See on  :-). REPENTANCE, as
	distinguished from faith, is that state of the "honest
	and good heart" which arises from a discovery of one's
	contrariety to the righteous demands of the divine law. This is said
	to be "toward God," because seeing Him to be the
	party dishonored by sin, it feels all its acknowledgments and
	compunctions to be properly due to Him, as the great Lawgiver, and
	directs them to Him accordingly; condemning, humbling itself, and
	grieving before Him, looking also to Him as its only Hope of
	deliverance. FAITH is said
	to be "toward our Lord Jesus Christ," because in
	that frame of mind just described it eagerly credits the testimony of
	relief divinely provided in Christ, gladly embraces the overtures of
	reconciliation in Him, and directs all its expectations of salvation,
	from its first stage to its last, to Him as the one appointed Medium
	of all grace from God to a sinful world. Thus we have here a brief
	summary of all Gospel preaching. And it is easy to see why repentance
	is here put before faith; for the former must of necessity precede
	the latter. There is a repentance subsequent to faith, the fruit of
	felt pardon and restoration. It was this which drew the tears with
	which the Saviour's feet were once so copiously moistened. (Luke 7:37;
	Luke 7:38; Luke 7:47;
	and compare Ezekiel 16:63). But
	that is not the light in which it is here presented.
