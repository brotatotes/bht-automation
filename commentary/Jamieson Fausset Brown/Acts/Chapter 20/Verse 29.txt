29, 30. after my departing shall
	grievous wolves enter in among youâ€”Two classes of coming
	enemies are here announced, the one more external to themselves, the
	other bred in the bosom of their own community; both were to be
	teachers, but the one, "grievous wolves," not sparing, that
	is, making a prey of the flock; the other ( :-), simply sectarian "perverters" of the truth,
	with the view of drawing a party after them. Perhaps the one pointed
	to that subtle poison of Oriental Gnosticism which we know to have
	very early infected the Asiatic churches; the other to such Judaizing
	tendencies as we know to have troubled nearly all the early churches.
	See the Epistles to the Ephesians, Colossians, and Timothy,
	also those to the seven churches of Asia ( :-). But watchfulness against all that tends to
	injure and corrupt the Church is the duty of its pastors in every
	age.
