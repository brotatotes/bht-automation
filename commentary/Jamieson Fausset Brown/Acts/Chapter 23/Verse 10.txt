10. the chief captain, fearing lest
	Paul should have been pulled to pieces . . . commanded the soldiers
	to go down and take him by force, &c.—This shows that the
	commandant was not himself present, and further, that instead of the
	Sanhedrim trying the cause, the proceedings quickly consisted in the
	one party attempting to seize the prisoner, and the other to protect

	 :-. IN THE
	FORTRESS PAUL
	IS CHEERED
	BY A NIGHT
	VISION—AN
	INFAMOUS CONSPIRACY
	TO ASSASSINATE HIM
	IS PROVIDENTIALLY
	DEFEATED, AND HE
	IS DESPATCHED
	BY NIGHT WITH A
	LETTER FROM THE COMMANDANT
	TO FELIX AT
	CÆSAREA, BY WHOM
	ARRANGEMENTS ARE
	MADE FOR A HEARING
	OF HIS CAUSE.
