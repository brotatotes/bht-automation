11. I appeal to Cæsar—The
	right of appeal to the supreme power, in case of life and death, was
	secured by an ancient law to every Roman citizen, and continued under
	the empire. Had Festus shown any disposition to pronounce final
	judgment, Paul, strong in the consciousness of his innocence and the
	justice of a Roman tribunal, would not have made this appeal. But
	when the only other alternative offered him was to give his own
	consent to be transferred to the great hotbed of plots against his
	life, and to a tribunal of unscrupulous and bloodthirsty
	ecclesiastics whose vociferous cries for his death had scarcely
	subsided, no other course was open to him.
