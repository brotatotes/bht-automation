17. Delivering thee from the
	people—the Jews. 
	and from
	the Gentiles—He was all along the object of Jewish malignity,
	and was at that moment in the hands of the Gentiles; yet he calmly
	reposes on his Master's assurances of deliverance from both, at the
	same time taking all precautions for safety and vindicating all his
	legal rights. 
	unto whom now I send thee—The
	emphatic "I" here denotes the authority of the Sender
	[BENGEL].
