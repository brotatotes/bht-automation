	voice—surprised and bewildered. 
	Paul, thou art beside
	thyself, much learning doth make thee mad—"is turning thy
	head." The union of flowing Greek, deep acquaintance with
	the sacred writings of his nation, reference to a resurrection and
	other doctrines to a Roman utterly unintelligible, and, above all,
	lofty religious earnestness, so strange to the cultivated,
	cold-hearted skeptics of that day—may account for this sudden
	exclamation.
