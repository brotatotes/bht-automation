8. Why should it be thought a thing
	incredible . . . that God should raise the dead?â€”rather, "Why
	is it judged a thing incredible if God raises the dead?" the
	case being viewed as an accomplished fact. No one dared to
	call in question the overwhelming evidence of the resurrection of
	Jesus, which proclaimed Him to be the Christ, the Son of God; the
	only way of getting rid of it, therefore, was to pronounce it
	incredible. But why, asks the apostle, is it so judged?
	Leaving this pregnant question to find its answer in the breasts of
	his audience, he now passes to his personal history.
