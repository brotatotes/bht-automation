24. saying, Fear not, Paul: thou
	must be brought before Cæsar and, lo, God hath given thee all . . .
	that sail with thee—While the crew were toiling at the pumps,
	Paul was wrestling in prayer, not for himself only and the cause in
	which he was going a prisoner to Rome, but with true magnanimity of
	soul for all his shipmates; and God heard him, "giving him"
	(remarkable expression!) all that sailed with him. "When the
	cheerless day came he gathered the sailors (and passengers) around
	him on the deck of the laboring vessel, and raising his voice above
	the storm" [HOWSON],
	reported the divine communication he had received; adding with a
	noble simplicity, "for I believe God that it shall be
	even as it was told me," and encouraging all on board to "be
	of good cheer" in the same confidence. What a contrast to this
	is the speech of Cæsar in similar circumstances to his pilot,
	bidding him keep up his spirit because he carried Cæsar and Cæsar's
	fortune! [PLUTARCH]. The
	Roman general knew no better name for the Divine Providence, by which
	he had been so often preserved, than Cæsar's fortune
	[HUMPHRY]. From the
	explicit particulars—that the ship would be lost, but not one that
	sailed in it, and that they "must be cast on a certain
	island"—one would conclude a visional representation of a
	total wreck, a mass of human beings struggling with the angry
	elements, and one and all of those whose figures and countenances had
	daily met his eye on deck, standing on some unknown island shore.
	From what follows, it would seem that Paul from this time was
	regarded with a deference akin to awe.
