39. when it was day they knew not
	the land—This has been thought surprising in sailors accustomed
	to that sea. But the scene of the wreck is remote from the great
	harbor, and possesses no marked features by which it could be
	recognized, even by a native if he came unexpectedly upon it [SMITH],
	not to speak of the rain pouring in torrents ( :-), which would throw a haze over the coast even after day
	broke. Immediately on landing they knew where they were ( :-). 
	discovered a creek with a
	shore—Every creek of course, must have a shore; but the meaning
	is, a practicable shore, in a nautical sense, that is, one
	with a smooth beach, in contradistinction to a rocky coast (as  :- shows). 
	into which they were minded,
	if . . . possible, to thrust the ship—This was their one chance
	of safety.
