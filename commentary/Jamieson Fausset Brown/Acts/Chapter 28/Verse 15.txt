15. And from thence, when the
	brethren—of Rome 
	heard of us—by letter
	from Puteoli, and probably by the same conveyance which took Julius'
	announcement of his arrival. 
	they came to meet us as far
	as Appii Forum—a town forty-one miles from Rome. 
	and the Three Taverns—thirty
	miles from Rome. Thus they came to greet the apostle in two parties,
	one stopping short at the nearer, the other going on to the more
	distant place. 
	whom when Paul saw, he
	thanked God—for such a welcome. How sensitive he was to such
	Christian affection all his Epistles show ( :-, &c.). 
	and took courage—his
	long-cherished purpose to "see Rome" ( :-), there to proclaim the unsearchable riches of Christ, and
	the divine pledge that in this he should be gratified ( :-), being now about to be auspiciously realized.
