16. when we came to Rome—the
	renowned capital of the ancient world, situated on the Tiber. 
	the centurion delivered the
	prisoners to the captain of the guard—the Prætorian
	Prefect, to whose custody, as commander of the Prætorian guard,
	the highest military authority in the city, were committed all who
	were to come before the emperor for trial. Ordinarily there were two
	such prefects; but from A.D.
	51 to 62, one distinguished general—Burrus Aframus, who had
	been Nero's tutor—held that office; and as our historian speaks of
	"the captain," as if there were but one, it is
	thought that this fixes the apostle's arrival at Rome to be not later
	than the year 62 [WIES].
	But even though there had been two when Paul arrived, he would be
	committed only to one of them, who would be "the captain"
	who got charge of him. (At most, therefore, this can furnish no more
	than confirmation to the chronological evidence otherwise obtained). 
	but Paul was suffered to
	dwell by himself with a—"the" 
	soldier that kept
	him—"guarded" him. (See on  :-). This privilege was allowed in the case of the better class
	of prisoners, not accused of any flagrant offense, on finding
	security—which in Paul's case would not be difficult among the
	Christians. The extension of this privilege to the apostle may have
	been due to the terms in which Festus wrote about him; but far more
	probably it was owing to the high terms in which Julius spoke of him,
	and his express intercession in his behalf. It was overruled,
	however, for giving the fullest scope to the labors of the apostle
	compatible with confinement at all. As the soldiers who kept him were
	relieved periodically, he would thus make the personal acquaintance
	of a great number of the Prætorian guard; and if he had to appear
	before the Prefect from time to time, the truth might thus penetrate
	to those who surrounded the emperor, as we learn, from Philippians 1:12;
	Philippians 1:13, that it did.
