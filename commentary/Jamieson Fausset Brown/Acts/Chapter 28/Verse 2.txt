2. the barbarous people—so
	called merely as speaking neither the Greek nor the Latin
	language. They were originally Phoelignician colonists. 
	showed us no little—"no
	ordinary" 
	kindness, for they kindled a
	fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain—"the
	rain that was on us"—not now first falling, but then falling
	heavily. 
	and because of the
	cold—welcomed us all, drenched and shivering, to these most
	seasonable marks of friendship. In this these "barbarians"
	contrast favorably with many since bearing the Christian name. The
	lifelike style of the narrative here and in the following verses
	gives it a great charm.
