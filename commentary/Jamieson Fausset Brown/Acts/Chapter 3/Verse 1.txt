1-11. Peter and John—already
	associated by their Master, first with James (Mark 1:29;
	Mark 5:37; Mark 9:2),
	then by themselves (Luke 22:8;
	and see John 13:23; John 13:24).
	Now we find them constantly together, but John (yet young) only as a
	silent actor. 
	went up—were going up,
	were on their way.
