13. The God of Abraham, c.—(See
	on Acts 2:22 Acts 2:22- :). 
	hath glorified his Son
	Jesus—rather, "his Servant Jesus," as the same word
	is rendered in Matthew 12:18, but
	in that high sense in which Isaiah applies it always to Messiah
	(Isaiah 42:1; Isaiah 49:6;
	Isaiah 52:13; Isaiah 53:11).
	When "Son" is intended a different word is used. 
	whom ye delivered up,
	&c.—With what heroic courage does Peter here charge his
	auditors with the heaviest of all conceivable crimes, and with what
	terrific strength of language are these charges clothed!
