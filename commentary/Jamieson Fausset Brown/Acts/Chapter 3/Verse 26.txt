26. God, having raised up—not
	from the dead, but having provided, prepared, and given. 
	his Son Jesus—"His
	Servant Jesus" (see on  :-). 
	sent him to bless
	you—literally, "sent Him blessing you," as if laden
	with blessing. 
	in turning away every one of
	you from his iniquities—that is, "Hitherto we have all
	been looking too much for a Messiah who should shed outward blessings
	upon the nation generally, and through it upon the world. But we have
	learned other things, and now announce to you that the great blessing
	with which Messiah has come laden is the turning away of every one of
	you from his iniquities." With what divine skill does the
	apostle, founding on resistless facts, here drive home to the
	conscience of his auditors their guilt in crucifying the Lord of
	Glory; then soothe their awakened minds by assurances of forgiveness
	on turning to the Lord, and a glorious future as soon as this shall
	come to pass, to terminate with the Personal Return of Christ from
	the heavens whither He has ascended; ending all with warnings, from
	their own Scriptures, to submit to Him if they would not perish, and
	calls to receive from Him the blessings of salvation.
