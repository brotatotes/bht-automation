3. look ye out among you—that
	is, ye, "the multitude," from among yourselves. 
	seven men of honest
	report—good reputation (Acts 10:22;
	1 Timothy 3:7). 
	full of the Holy Ghost—not
	full of miraculous gifts, which would have been no qualification for
	the duties required, but spiritually gifted (although on two
	of them miraculous power did rest). 
	and wisdom—discretion,
	aptitude for practical business. 
	whom we may appoint—for
	while the election was vested in the Christian people, the
	appointment lay with the apostles, as spiritual rulers.
