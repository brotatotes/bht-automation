	Isaiah 66:2), that even that
	temple, magnificent though it was, was not the proper
	resting-place of Jehovah upon earth; as his audience and the
	nations had all along been prone to imagine. (What that resting-place
	was, even "the contrite heart, that trembleth at God's word,"
	he leaves to be gathered from the prophet referred to).
