55. But he, being full of the Holy
	Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of
	God—You who can transfer to canvas such scenes as these, in
	which the rage of hell grins horribly from men, as they sit condemned
	by a frail prisoner of their own, and see heaven beaming from his
	countenance and opening full upon his view—I envy you, for I find
	no words to paint what, in the majesty of the divine text, is here so
	simply told. "But how could Stephen, in the council-chamber, see
	heaven at all? I suppose this question never occurred but to critics
	of narrow soul, one of whom [MEYER]
	conjectures that he saw it through the window! and another, of better
	mould, that the scene lay in one of the courts of the temple"
	[ALFORD]. As the sight was
	witnessed by Stephen alone, the opened heavens are to be viewed as
	revealed to his bright beaming spirit. 
	and Jesus standing on the
	right hand of God—Why "standing," and not
	sitting, the posture in which the glorified Saviour is
	elsewhere represented? Clearly, to express the eager interest with
	which He watched from the skies the scene in that council chamber,
	and the full tide of His Spirit which He was at that moment engaged
	in pouring into the heart of His heroical witness, till it beamed in
	radiance from his very countenance.
