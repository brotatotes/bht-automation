56. I see . . . the Son of man
	standing, c.â€”This is the only time that our Lord is by human
	lips called THE SON
	OF MAN after His
	ascension (Revelation 1:13 Revelation 14:14
	are not instances). And why here? Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost,
	speaking now not of himself at all (Revelation 14:14- :), but entirely by the Spirit, is led to repeat the very
	words in which Jesus Himself, before this same council, had
	foretold His glorification (Revelation 14:14- :), assuring them that that exaltation of the SON
	OF MAN which they
	should hereafter witness to their dismay, was already begun and
	actual [ALFORD].
