39, 40. the Spirit of the Lord
	caught away Philip—To deny [as MEYER,
	OLSHAUSEN, BLOOMFIELD]
	the miraculous nature of Philip's disappearance, is vain. It stands
	out on the face of the words, as just a repetition of what we read of
	the ancient prophets, in 1 Kings 18:12;
	2 Kings 2:16. And the same word (as
	BENGEL remarks) is
	employed to express a similar idea in 2 Corinthians 12:2;
	2 Corinthians 12:4; 1 Thessalonians 4:17.
	the eunuch saw him no
	more—nor, perhaps, for very joy, cared to see him [BENGEL].
	and he went on his way
	rejoicing—He had found Christ, and the key to the Scriptures;
	his soul was set free, and his discipleship sealed; he had lost his
	teacher, but gained what was infinitely better: He felt himself a new
	man, and "his joy was full." Tradition says he was the
	first preacher of the Gospel in Ethiopia; and how, indeed, could he
	choose but "tell what the Lord had done for his soul?" Yet
	there is no certainty as to any historical connection between his
	labors and the introduction of Christianity into that country.
