	Mediterranean, just south of Mount Carmel; and so named by Herod, who
	rebuilt it, in honor of Cæsar Augustus. Henceforth we lose sight of
	zealous and honored Philip, as by and by we shall lose sight even of

	up, each suited to his work. But "he that soweth and he that
	reapeth shall rejoice together." (See on  :-).
