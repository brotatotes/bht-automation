23. And after many days were
	fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill himâ€”Had we no other
	record than this, we should have supposed that what is here related
	took place while Saul continued at Damascus after his baptism. But in
Galatians 1:17; Galatians 1:18
we learn from Paul himself that he "went into Arabia, and
	returned again unto Damascus," and that from the time of his
	first visit to the close of his second, both of which appear to have
	been short, a period of three years elapsed; either three full
	years, or one full year and part of two others. (See on Galatians 1:18- :). That such a blank should occur in the Acts, and be
	filled up in Galatians, is not more remarkable than that the flight
	of the Holy Family into Egypt, their stay there, and their return
	thence, recorded only by Matthew, should be so entirely passed over
	by Luke, that if we had only his Gospel, we should have supposed that
	they returned to Nazareth immediately after the presentation in the
	temple. (Indeed in one of his narratives, Acts 22:16;
	Acts 22:17, Paul himself takes no
	notice of this period). But wherefore this journey? Perhaps
	(1) because he felt a period of repose and partial seclusion to be
	needful to his spirit, after the violence of the change and the
	excitement of his new occupation. (2) To prevent the rising storm
	which was gathering against him from coming too soon to a head. (3)
	To exercise his ministry in the Jewish synagogues, as opportunity
	afforded. On his return, refreshed and strengthened in spirit, he
	immediately resumed his ministry, but soon to the imminent hazard of
	his life.
