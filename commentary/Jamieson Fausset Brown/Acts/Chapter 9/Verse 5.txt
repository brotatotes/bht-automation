5. Who art thou, Lord?—"Jesus
	knew Saul ere Saul knew Jesus" [BENGEL].
	The term "Lord" here is an indefinite term of respect for
	some unknown but august speaker. That Saul saw as well as heard
	this glorious Speaker, is expressly said by Ananias (Acts 9:17;
	Acts 22:14), by Barnabas (Acts 22:14- :), and by himself (Acts 22:14- :); and in claiming apostleship, he explicitly states that he
	had "seen the Lord" (1 Corinthians 9:1;
	1 Corinthians 15:8), which can refer only
	to this scene. 
	I am Jesus whom thou
	persecutest—The "I" and "thou" here are
	touchingly emphatic in the original; while the term "JESUS"
	is purposely chosen, to convey to him the thrilling information that
	the hated name which he sought to hunt down—"the Nazarene,"
	as it is in Acts 22:8 —was now
	speaking to him from the skies, "crowned with glory and honor"
	(see Acts 26:9). 
	It is hard for thee to kick
	against the pricks—The metaphor of an ox, only driving the goad
	deeper by kicking against it, is a classic one, and here forcibly
	expresses, not only the vanity of all his measures for crushing the
	Gospel, but the deeper wound which every such effort inflicted upon
	himself.
