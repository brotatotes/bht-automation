	said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said—(The
	most ancient manuscripts and versions of the New Testament lack all
	these words here [including the last clause of  :-]; but they occur in Acts 26:14;
	Acts 22:10, from which they appear
	to have been inserted here). The question, "What shall I do,
	Lord?" or, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?"
	indicates a state of mind singularly interesting (see on Acts 22:10- :). Its elements seem to be these: (1) Resistless conviction
	that "Jesus whom he persecuted," now speaking to him, was
	"Christ the Lord." (See on Acts 22:10- :). (2) As a consequence of this, that not only all his
	religious views, but his whole religious character, had been an
	entire mistake; that he was up to that moment fundamentally and
	wholly wrong. (3) That though his whole future was now a blank, he
	had absolute confidence in Him who had so tenderly arrested him in
	his blind career, and was ready both to take in all His teaching and
	to carry out all His directions. (For more, see on Acts 22:10- :). 
	Arise, and go into the city,
	and it shall be told thee, &c.—See on Acts 22:10- :.
