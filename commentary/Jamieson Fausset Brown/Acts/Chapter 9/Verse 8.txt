8. Saul arose . . . and when his
	eyes were opened, he saw no manâ€”after beholding the Lord, since
	he "could not see for the glory of that light" ( :-), he had involuntarily closed his eyes to protect them from
	the glare; and on opening them again he found his vision gone. "It
	is not said, however, that he was blind, for it was no
	punishment" [BENGEL].
