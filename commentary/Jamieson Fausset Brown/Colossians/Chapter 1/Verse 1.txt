	Timothy—(Compare Notes,
	see on  :- and  :-). He was with Paul at the time of writing in Rome. He had
	been companion of Paul in his first tour through Phrygia, in which
	Colosse was. Hence the Colossians seem to have associated him with
	Paul in their affections, and the apostle joins him with himself in
	the address. Neither, probably, had seen the Colossian Church
	(compare Colossians 2:1) but had seen,
	during their tour through Phrygia, individual Colossians, as
	Epaphras, Philemon, Archippus, and Apphia (Colossians 2:1- :), who when converted brought the Gospel to their native city.
