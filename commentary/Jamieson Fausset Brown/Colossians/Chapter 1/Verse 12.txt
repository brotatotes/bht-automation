12. You "giving
	thanks unto the Father." See on  :-; this clause is connected with "that ye may be
	filled" (Colossians 1:9), and
	"that ye may walk" (Colossians 1:9- :). The connection is not, "We do not cease to
	pray for you (Colossians 1:9) giving
	thanks." 
	unto the Father—of
	Jesus Christ, and so our Father by adoption (Galatians 3:26;
	Galatians 4:4-6). 
	which hath made us
	meet—Greek, "who made us meet." Not "is
	making us meet" by progressive growth in holiness; but once
	for all made us meet. It is not primarily the Spirit's
	work that is meant here, as the text is often used; but the Father's
	work in putting us by adoption, once for all, in a new standing,
	namely, that of children. The believers meant here were in
	different stages of progressive sanctification; but in respect to the
	meetness specified here, they all alike had it from the Father, in
	Christ His Son, being "complete in Him" (Galatians 4:4-48.4.6- :). Compare John 17:17;
	Judges 1:1, "sanctified by God
	the Father"; 1 Corinthians 1:30.
	Still, secondarily, this once-for-all meetness contains in it
	the germ of sanctification, afterwards developed progressively in the
	life by the Father's Spirit in the believer. The Christian life of
	heavenliness is the first stage of heaven itself. There must, and
	will be, a personal meetness for heaven, where there is a
	judicial meetness. 
	to be partakers,
	c.—Greek, "for the (or 'our') portion of the
	inheritance (Acts 20:32 Acts 26:18;
	Ephesians 1:11) of the saints in
	light." "Light" begins in the believer here,
	descending from "the Father of lights" by Jesus, "the
	true light," and is perfected in the kingdom of light, which
	includes knowledge, purity, love, and joy. It is contrasted here with
	the "darkness" of the unconverted state (Ephesians 1:11- :; compare 1 Peter 2:9).
