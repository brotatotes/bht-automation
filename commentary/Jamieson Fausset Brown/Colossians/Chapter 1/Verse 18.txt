18. Revelation of Christ to the
	Church and the new creation, as the Originator of both. 
	he—emphatical. Not
	angels in opposition to the false teachers' doctrine concerning
	angel-worship, and the power of Oeons or (imaginary) spirit
	emanations from God (Colossians 2:10;
	Colossians 2:18). 
	head of the body, the
	church—The Church is His body by virtue of His entering into
	communion corporeally with human nature [NEANDER],
	(Ephesians 1:22). The same One who is
	the Head of all things and beings by creation, is also, by virtue of
	being "the first-born from the dead," and so "the
	first-fruits" of the new creation among men, the Head of the
	Church. 
	who is—that is, in that
	He is the Beginning [ALFORD].
	Rather, this is the beginning of a new paragraph. As the
	former paragraph, which related to His originating the physical
	creation, began with "Who is" (Ephesians 1:22- :); so this, which treats of His originating the new creation,
	begins with "who is"; a parenthesis preceding, which closes
	the former paragraph, that parenthesis (see on Ephesians 1:22- :), including from "all things were created by Him,"
	to "Head of the body, the Church." The head of kings
	and high priests was anointed, as the seat of the faculties, the
	fountain of dignity, and original of all the members
	(according to Hebrew etymology). So Jesus by His unction was
	designated as the Head of the body, the Church. 
	the beginning—namely,
	of the new creation, as of the old (Proverbs 8:22;
	John 1:1; compare John 1:1- :): the beginning of the Church of the first-born (John 1:1- :), as being Himself the "first-born from the dead"
	(Acts 26:23; 1 Corinthians 15:20;
	1 Corinthians 15:23). Christ's
	primogeniture is threefold: (1) From eternity the "first-begotten"
	of the Father (Colossians 1:15); (2)
	As the first-born of His mother (Colossians 1:15- :); (3) As the Head of the Church, mystically begotten of the
	Father, as it were to a new life, on the day of His resurrection,
	which is His "regeneration," even as His people's coming
	resurrection will be their "regeneration" (that is, the
	resurrection which was begun in the soul, extended to the body and to
	the whole creation, Romans 8:21;
	Romans 8:22) (Matthew 19:28;
	Acts 13:33; Revelation 1:5).
	Sonship and resurrection are similarly connected (Luke 20:36;
	Romans 1:4; Romans 8:23;
	1 John 3:2). Christ by rising from
	the dead is the efficient cause (1 John 3:2- :), as having obtained the power, and the exemplary cause, as
	being the pattern (Micah 2:13;
	Romans 6:5; Philippians 3:21),
	of our resurrection: the resurrection of "the Head"
	involves consequentially that of the members. 
	that in all things—He
	resumes the "all things" (Philippians 3:21- :). 
	he might have the
	pre-eminence—Greek, "He HIMSELF
	may (thus) become the One holding the first place," or,
	"take the precedency." Both ideas are included, priority in
	time and priority in dignity: now in the regenerated
	world, as before in the world of creation (Philippians 3:21- :). "Begotten before every creature, or "first-born
	of every creature" (Psalms 89:27;
	John 3:13).
