21. The Colossians are included
	in this general reconciliation (compare Ephesians 2:1;
	Ephesians 2:12). 
	sometime—"once."
	alienated—from God and
	salvation: objectively banished from God, through the barrier
	which God's justice interposed against your sin: subjectively
	estranged through the alienation of your own wills from God.
	The former is the prominent thought (compare Ephesians 2:12- :), as the second follows, "enemies in your mind."
	"Actual alienation makes habitual 'enemies'"
	[BENGEL]. 
	in your mind—Greek,
	"in your understanding" or "thought" (Ephesians 2:3;
	Ephesians 4:18). 
	by wicked works—rather
	as Greek, "in your wicked works" (wicked
	works were the element in which your enmity subsisted).
	yet now—Notwithstanding
	the former alienation, now that Christ has come, God
	hath completely reconciled, or restored to His friendship
	again (so the Greek, compare Note, see on Ephesians 4:18- :).
