22. In the body of his flesh—the
	element in which His reconciling sufferings had place. Compare  :-, "afflictions of Christ in my flesh" ( :-). Angels who have not a "body of flesh" are not in
	any way our reconciling mediators, as your false teachers assert, but
	He, the Lord of angels, who has taken our flesh, that in
	it He might atone for our fallen manhood. 
	through death—rather as
	Greek, "through His death" (which could only
	take place in a body like ours, of flesh,  :-). This implies He took on Him our true and entire manhood.
	Flesh is the sphere in which His human sufferings could have
	place (compare Colossians 1:24; Ephesians 2:15).
	to present you— (Ephesians 2:15- :). The end of His reconciling atonement by death. 
	holy—positively; and in
	relation to God. 
	unblamable . . .
	unreprovable—negatively. "Without blemish" (as the
	former Greek word is translated as to Jesus, our Head, Ephesians 2:15- :) in one's self. Irreproachable (the Greek for
	the second word, one who gives no occasion for his being
	brought to a law court) is in relation to the world without.
	Sanctification, as the fruit, is here treated of; justification,
	by Christ's reconciliation, as the tree, having preceded (Ephesians 1:4;
	Ephesians 5:26; Ephesians 5:27;
	Titus 2:14). At the same time, our
	sanctification is regarded here as perfect in Christ, into
	whom we are grafted at regeneration or conversion, and who is "made
	of God unto us (perfect) sanctification" (1 Corinthians 1:30;
	1 Peter 1:2; Judges 1:1):
	not merely progressive sanctification, which is the gradual
	development of the sanctification which Christ is made to the
	believer from the first. 
	in his sight—in God's
	sight, at Christ's appearing.
