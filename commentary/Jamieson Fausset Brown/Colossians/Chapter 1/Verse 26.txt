26. the mystery—(See on  :-; Ephesians 3:5-9).
	The mystery, once hidden, now revealed, is redemption for the
	whole Gentile world, as well as for the Jews, "Christ in you
	(Gentiles) the hope of glory" (Ephesians 3:5-49.3.9- :). 
	from ages—"from,"
	according to ALFORD,
	refers to time, not "hidden from": from the time of the
	ages; still what is meant is that the mystery was hidden from the
	beings living in those "ages." The "ages"
	are the vast successive periods marked by successive orders of beings
	and stages of creation. Greek, "Æons," a word used
	by the Gnostics for angelic beings emanating from God. The Spirit by
	Paul presciently, in opposition to Gnostic error already beginning
	(Colossians 2:18), teaches, that the
	mystery of redemption was hidden in God's purposes in Christ, alike
	from the angelic beings (compare Colossians 2:18- :) of the pre-Adamic "ages," and from the subsequent
	human "generations." Translate as Greek, "the
	ages . . . the generations." 
	made manifest to his
	saints—to His apostles and prophets primarily (Colossians 2:18- :), and through them to all His saints.
