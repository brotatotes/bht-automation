	what in particular he prays for; as in  :- he stated generally the fact of his praying for them. 
	to desire—"to make
	request." 
	might be filled—rather,
	"may be filled"; a verb, often found in this Epistle
	(Colossians 4:12; Colossians 4:17).
	knowledge—Greek,
	"full and accurate knowledge." Akin to the Greek for
	"knew" (see on Colossians 1:6).
	of his will—as to how
	ye ought to walk (Ephesians 5:17); as
	well as chiefly that "mystery of His will, according to His good
	pleasure which He purposed in Himself; that in the fulness of times
	He might gather together in one all things in Christ" (Ephesians 1:9;
	Ephesians 1:10); God's "will,"
	whereby He eternally purposed to reconcile to Himself, and save men
	by Christ, not by angels, as the false teachers in some degree taught
	(Colossians 2:18) [ESTIUS].
	There seems to have been a want of knowledge among the
	Colossians; notwithstanding their general excellencies; hence he so
	often dwells on this subject (Colossians 1:28;
	Colossians 2:2; Colossians 2:3;
	Colossians 3:10; Colossians 3:13;
	Colossians 4:5; Colossians 4:6).
	On the contrary he less extols wisdom to the Corinthians, who
	were puffed up with the conceit of knowledge. 
	wisdom—often mentioned
	in this Epistle, as opposed to the (false) "philosophy" and
	"show of wisdom" (Colossians 2:8;
	Colossians 2:23; compare Colossians 2:23- :). 
	understanding—sagacity
	to discern what on each occasion is suited to the place and the time;
	its seat is "the understanding" or intellect; wisdom is
	more general and has its seat in the whole compass of the faculties
	of the soul [BENGEL].
	"Wouldst thou know that the matters in the word of Christ are
	real things? Then never read them for mere knowledge sake"
	[Quoted by GAUSSEN.]
	Knowledge is desirable only when seasoned by "spiritual
	understanding."
