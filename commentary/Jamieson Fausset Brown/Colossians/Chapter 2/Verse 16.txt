16. therefore—because ye are
	complete in Christ, and God in Him has dispensed with all subordinate
	means as essential to acceptance with Him. 
	meat . . . drink—Greek,
	"eating . . . drinking" ( :-). Pay no regard to any one who sits in judgment on you as

	the sabbath—Omit "THE,"
	which is not in the Greek (compare Note, see on  :-). "SABBATHS"
	(not "the sabbaths") of the day of atonement and feast of
	tabernacles have come to an end with the Jewish services to which
	they belonged (Leviticus 23:32; Leviticus 23:37-39).
	The weekly sabbath rests on a more permanent foundation, having been

	distinguished "the sabbath of the Lord" from the other
	sabbaths. A positive precept is right because it is
	commanded, and ceases to be obligatory when abrogated; a moral
	precept is commanded eternally, because it is eternally
	right. If we could keep a perpetual sabbath, as we shall

	obligatory in the spirit, though the letter of the law has been
	superseded by that higher spirit of love which is the essence of law
	and Gospel alike (Hebrews 4:9- :).
