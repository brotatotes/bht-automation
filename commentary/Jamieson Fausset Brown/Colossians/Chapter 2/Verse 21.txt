21. Compare  :-, "meat . . . drink." He gives instances of the
	"ordinances" (Colossians 2:20)
	in the words of their imposers. There is an ascending climax of
	superstitious prohibitions. The first Greek word (hapse)
	is distinguished from the third (thiges), in that the former
	means close contact and retention: the latter,
	momentary contact (compare 1 Corinthians 7:1;
	John 20:17, Greek, "Hold
	me not"; cling not to me"). Translate, "Handle
	not, neither taste, nor even touch." The three
	refer to meats. "Handle not" (a stronger term than
	"nor even touch"), "nor taste" with the
	tongue, "nor even touch," however slight the
	contact.
