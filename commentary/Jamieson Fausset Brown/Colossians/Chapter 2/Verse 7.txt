7. Rooted— ( :-). 
	built up—Greek,
	"being builded up." As "rooted" implies
	their vitality; so "builded up," massive solidity.
	As in the Song of Solomon, when one image is not sufficient to
	express the varied aspects of divine truth, another is employed to
	supply the idea required. Thus "walking," a third image
	(Colossians 2:6), expresses the thought
	which "rooted" and "built," though each
	suggesting a thought peculiar to itself, could not express, namely,
	onward motion. "Rooted" is in the past tense,
	implying their first conversion and vital grafting "in
	Him." "Built up" is present (in the Greek),
	implying their progressive increase in religion by union with
	Him. Ephesians 2:20 refers to the
	Church; but the passage here to their individual
	progress in edification (Ephesians 2:20- :). 
	stablished—confirmed. 
	as—"even as."
	abounding therein with
	thanksgiving—advancing to fuller maturity (compare Ephesians 2:20- :) in the faith, "with thanksgiving" to God as the
	gracious Author of this whole blessing.
