10. the new man—(See on  :-). Here (neon) the Greek, means "the
	recently-put-on nature"; that lately received at
	regeneration (see on  :-).
	which is renewed—Greek,
	"which is being renewed" (anakainottmenou); namely,
	its development into a perfectly renewed nature is continually
	progressing to completion. 
	in knowledge—rather as
	the Greek, "unto perfect knowledge" (see on  :-; Colossians 1:9). Perfect
	knowledge of God excludes all sin (Colossians 1:9- :). 
	after the image of him that
	created him—namely, of God that created the new man
	(Ephesians 2:10; Ephesians 4:24).
	The new creation is analogous to the first creation (Ephesians 4:24- :). As man was then made in the image of God naturally, so now
	spiritually. But the image of God formed in us by the Spirit of God,
	is as much more glorious than that borne by Adam, as the Second Man,
	the Lord from heaven, is more glorious than the first man. Ephesians 4:24- :, "Let us make man in our image, after our
	likeness." The "image" is claimed for man, Ephesians 4:24- :; the "likeness," Ephesians 4:24- :. ORIGEN [On
	First Principles, 3:6] taught, the image was something in
	which all were created, and which continued to man after the fall (Ephesians 4:24- :). The likeness was something towards which man
	was created, that he might strive after it and attain it. TRENCH
	thinks God in the double statement (Ephesians 4:24- :), contemplates both man's first creation and his being
	"renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created
	Him."
