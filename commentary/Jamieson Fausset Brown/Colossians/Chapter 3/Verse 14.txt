14. above—rather "over,"
	as in Ephesians 6:16. Charity, which
	is the crowning grace, covering the multitude of others' sins (Ephesians 6:16- :), must overlie all the other graces enumerated. 
	which is—that is, "for
	it is"; literally, "which thing is." 
	bond of perfectness—an
	upper garment which completes and keeps together the rest,
	which, without it, would be loose and disconnected. Seeming graces,
	where love is wanting, are mere hypocrisy. Justification by faith is
	assumed as already having taken place in those whom Paul addresses,
	Colossians 3:12, "elect of God,
	holy . . . beloved," and Colossians 3:12- :; so that there is no plea here for Rome's view of
	justification by works. Love and its works "perfect,"
	that is, manifest the full maturity of faith developed (Matthew 5:44;
	Matthew 5:48). Love . . . be ye
	perfect, c. (James 2:21
James 2:22; 1 John 2:5).
	"If we love one another, God's love is perfected in us"
	(Romans 13:8; 1 Corinthians 13:1-13;
	1 Timothy 1:5; 1 John 4:12).
	As to "bond," compare 1 John 4:12- :, "knit together in love" (1 John 4:12- :), "keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
