25. Butâ€”The oldest manuscripts
	read, "for," which accords with "serve ye," &c.
	(Colossians 3:24), the oldest reading:
	the for here gives a motive for obeying the precept. He
	addresses the slaves: Serve ye the Lord Christ, and leave your wrongs
	in His hands to put to rights: (translate), "For he that doeth
	wrong shall receive back the wrong which he hath done (by just
	retribution in kind), and there is no respect of persons" with
	the Great Judge in the day of the Lord. He favors the master no more
	than the slave (Revelation 6:15).
