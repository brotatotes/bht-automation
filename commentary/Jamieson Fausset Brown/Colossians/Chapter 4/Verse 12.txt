12. Christ—The oldest
	manuscripts add "Jesus." 
	labouring fervently—As
	the Greek, is the same, translate, "striving earnestly"
	(see on Colossians 1:29 and Colossians 1:29- :), literally, "striving as in the agony of a contest."
	in prayers—Translate as
	Greek, "in his prayers." 
	complete—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "fully assured." It is translated, "fully
	persuaded," Romans 4:21;
	Romans 14:5. In the expression
	"perfect," he refers to what he has already said, Colossians 1:28;
	Colossians 2:2; Colossians 3:14.
	"Perfect" implies the attainment of the full maturity
	of a Christian. BENGEL
	joins "in all the will of God" with "stand."
