2. Continue—Greek,
	"Continue perseveringly," "persevere" ( :-), "watching thereunto"; here, "watch
	in the same," or "in it," that is, in
	prayer: watching against the indolence as to prayer, and in prayer,
	of our corrupt wills. 
	with thanksgiving—for
	everything, whether joyful, or sorrowful, mercies temporal and
	spiritual, national, family, and individual (1 Corinthians 14:17;
	Philippians 4:6; 1 Thessalonians 5:18).
