13. In whom ye also—Ye
	Gentiles. Supply as English Version, "trusted," from
	Ephesians 1:12; or "are."
	The priority of us Jews does not exclude you Gentiles from sharing in
	Christ (compare Acts 13:46). 
	the word of truth—the
	instrument of sanctification, and of the new birth (John 17:17;
	2 Timothy 2:15; James 1:18).
	Compare Colossians 1:5, where also, as
	here, it is connected with "hope." Also Colossians 1:5- :. 
	sealed—as God's
	confirmed children, by the Holy Spirit as the seal (Acts 19:1-6;
	Romans 8:16; Romans 8:23;
	1 John 3:24; see on 1 John 3:24- :). A seal impressed on a document gives undoubted validity to
	the contract in it (John 3:33;
	John 6:27; compare John 6:27- :). So the sense of "the love of God shed abroad in the
	heart by the Holy Ghost" (John 6:27- :), and the sense of adoption given through the Spirit at
	regeneration (Romans 8:15; Romans 8:16),
	assure believers of God's good will to them. The Spirit, like a seal,
	impresses on the soul at regeneration the image of our Father. The
	"sealing" by the Holy Spirit is spoken of as past
	once for all. The witnessing to our hearts that we are the children
	of God, and heirs (Ephesians 1:11),
	is the Spirit's present testimony, the "earnest of the
	(coming) inheritance" (Ephesians 1:11- :). 
	that Holy Spirit of
	promise—rather, as the Greek, "The Spirit of
	promise, even the Holy Spirit": The Spirit promised both
	in the Old and New Testaments (Joel 2:28;
	Zechariah 12:10; John 7:38;
	John 7:39). "The word"
	promised the Holy Spirit. Those who "believed the word of
	truth" were sealed by the Spirit accordingly.
