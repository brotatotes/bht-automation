15. Wherefore—because ye are
	in Christ and sealed by His Spirit (Ephesians 1:13;
	Ephesians 1:14). 
	I also—on my part, in
	return for God's so great benefits to you.
after I heard—ever
	since I have heard. Not implying that he had only heard of
	their conversion: an erroneous argument used by some against the
	address of this Epistle to the Ephesians (see on Ephesians 1:14- :); but referring to the report he had heard since he
	was with them, as to their Christian graces. So in the case of
	Philemon, his "beloved fellow laborer" (Ephesians 1:14- :), he uses the same words (Philemon 1:4;
	Philemon 1:5). 
	your faith—rather, as
	Greek, "the faith among you," that is, which many
	(not all) of you have. 
	love unto all the saints—of
	whatever name, simply because they are saints. A distinguishing
	characteristic of true Christianity (Philemon 1:5- :). "Faith and love he often joins
	together. A wondrous pair" [CHRYSOSTOM].
	Hope is added, Ephesians 1:18.
