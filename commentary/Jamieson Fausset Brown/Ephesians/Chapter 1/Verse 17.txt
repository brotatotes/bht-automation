17. A fit prayer for all
	Christians. 
	the God of our Lord
	Jesus—appropriate title here; as in  :- he treats of God's raising Jesus to be Head
	over all things to the Church. Jesus Himself called the Father "My
	God" (Matthew 27:46). 
	the Father of glory—(Compare
	Acts 7:2). The Father of that
	infinite glory which shines in the face of Christ, who is "the
	glory" (the true Shekinah); through whom also "the glory of
	the inheritance" (Ephesians 1:18)
	shall be ours (John 17:24;
	2 Corinthians 3:7-4). 
	the spirit of wisdom—whose
	attribute is infinite wisdom and who works wisdom in believers (2 Corinthians 3:7-47.3.4- :). 
	and revelation—whose
	function it is to reveal to believers spiritual mysteries
	(John 16:14; John 16:15;
	1 Corinthians 2:10). 
	in the knowledge—rather,
	as Greek (see on 1 Corinthians 2:10- :),
	"in the full knowledge of Him," namely, God.
