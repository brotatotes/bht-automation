3. The doxologies in almost all
	the Epistles imply the real sense of grace experienced by the writers
	and their readers (1 Peter 1:3). 1 Peter 1:3- : sets forth summarily the Gospel of the grace of God: the
	FATHER'S work of love, 1 Peter 1:3- : (choosing us to holiness, 1 Peter 1:3- :; to sonship, Ephesians 1:5;
	to acceptance, Ephesians 1:6):
	the SON'S, Ephesians 1:6- : (redemption, Ephesians 1:7;
	knowledge of the mystery of His will, Ephesians 1:7- :; an inheritance, Ephesians 1:7- :); the HOLY
	SPIRIT'S, Ephesians 1:7- : (sealing, Ephesians 1:13;
	giving an earnest of the inheritance, Ephesians 1:13- :). 
	the God and Father of . . .
	Christ—and so the God and Father of us who are in Him (Ephesians 1:13- :). God is "the God" of the man Jesus, and
	"the Father" of the Divine Word. The Greek
	is, "Blessed us," not "hath blessed us";
	referring to the past original counsel of God. As in creation (Ephesians 1:13- :) so in redemption (Genesis 12:3;
	Matthew 5:3-11; Matthew 25:34)
	God "blesses" His children; and that not in mere words,
	but in acts.
us—all Christians. 
	blessings—Greek,
	"blessing." "All," that is, "every
	possible blessing for time and eternity, which the Spirit
	has to bestow" (so "spiritual" means; not "spiritual,"
	as the term is now used, as opposed to bodily). 
	in heavenly places
—a phrase five times found in this Epistle, and not elsewhere
	(Ephesians 1:20; Ephesians 2:6;
	Ephesians 3:10; Ephesians 6:12);
	Greek, "in the heavenly places." Christ's
	ascension is the means of introducing us into the heavenly places,
	which by our sin were barred against us. Compare the change made by
	Christ (Colossians 1:20; Ephesians 1:20).
	While Christ in the flesh was in the form of a servant, God's
	people could not realize fully their heavenly privileges as sons. Now
	"our citizenship (Greek) is in heaven" (Ephesians 1:20- :), where our High Priest is ever "blessing" us. Our
	"treasures" are there (Matthew 6:20;
	Matthew 6:21); our aims and
	affections (Colossians 3:1; Colossians 3:2);
	our hope (Colossians 1:5; Titus 2:13);
	our inheritance (1 Peter 1:4). The
	gift of the Spirit itself, the source of the "spiritual
	blessing," is by virtue of Jesus having ascended thither (1 Peter 1:4- :). 
	in Christ—the center
	and source of all blessing to us.
