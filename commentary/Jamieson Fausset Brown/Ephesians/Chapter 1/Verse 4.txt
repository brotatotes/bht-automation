4. hath chosen us—Greek,
	"chose us out for Himself" (namely, out of
	the world, Galatians 1:4): referring to
	His original choice, spoken of as past.
in him—The repetition
	of the idea, "in Christ" (Galatians 1:4- :), implies the paramount importance of the truth that it is in
	Him, and by virtue of union to Him, the Second Adam, the Restorer
	ordained for us from everlasting, the Head of redeemed humanity,
	believers have all their blessings (Galatians 1:4- :). 
	before the foundation of the
	world—This assumes the eternity of the Son of God (John 17:5;
	John 17:24), as of the election of
	believers in Him (2 Timothy 1:9;
	2 Thessalonians 2:13). 
	that we should be
	holy—positively (Deuteronomy 14:2).
	without blame—negatively
	(Ephesians 5:27; 1 Thessalonians 3:13).
	before him—It is to Him
	the believer looks, walking as in His presence, before whom he looks
	to be accepted in the judgment (1 Thessalonians 3:13- :; compare Revelation 7:15). 
	in love—joined by
	BENGEL and others with Revelation 7:15- :, "in love having predestinated us," c. But English
	Version is better. The words qualify the whole clause, "that
	we should be holy . . . before Him." Love, lost to man by the
	fall, but restored by redemption, is the root and fruit and sum of
	all holiness (Ephesians 5:2 1 Thessalonians 3:12;
	1 Thessalonians 3:13).
