15. Rather, make "enmity"
	an apposition to "the middle wall of partition"; "Hath
	broken down the middle wall of partition (not merely as English
	Version, 'between us,' but also between all men and
	God), to wit, the enmity ( :-) by His flesh" (compare Ephesians 2:16;
	Romans 8:3). 
	the law of commandments
	contained in—Greek, "the law
	of the commandments (consisting) in ordinances." This law was
	"the partition" or "fence," which embodied the
	expression of the "enmity" (the "wrath" of God
	against our sin, and our enmity to Him, Romans 8:3- :) (Romans 4:15; Romans 5:20;
	Romans 7:10; Romans 7:11;
	Romans 8:7). Christ has in, or by,
	His crucified flesh, abolished it, so far as its condemning and
	enmity-creating power is concerned (Romans 8:7- :), substituting for it the law of love, which is the
	everlasting spirit of the law, and which flows from the realization
	in the soul of His love in His death for us. Translate what follows,
	"that He might make the two (Jews and Gentiles) into one new
	man." Not that He might merely reconcile the two to each other,
	but incorporate the two, reconciled in Him to God, into one new man;
	the old man to which both belonged, the enemy of God, having been
	slain in His flesh on the cross. Observe, too, ONE new man; we are
	all in God's sight but one in Christ, as we are but one in Adam
	[ALFORD]. 
	making peace—primarily
	between all and God, secondarily between Jews and Gentiles; He being
	"our peace." This "peace-making" precedes its
	publication (Ephesians 2:17).
