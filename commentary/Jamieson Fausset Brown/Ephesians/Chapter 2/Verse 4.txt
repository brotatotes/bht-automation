4. God, who is rich—Greek
	"(as) being rich in mercy." 
	for—that is, "because
	of His great love." This was the special ground of God's
	saving us; as "rich in mercy" (compare Ephesians 2:7;
	Ephesians 1:7; Romans 2:4;
	Romans 10:12) was the general
	ground. "Mercy takes away misery; love confers
	salvation" [BENGEL].
