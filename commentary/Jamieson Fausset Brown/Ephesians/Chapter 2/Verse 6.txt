	made us sit together—with
	Christ, namely, in His ascension. Believers are bodily in heaven in

	bodily, resurrection and ascension. "Christ Jesus" is the
	phrase mostly used in this Epistle, in which the office of the
	Christ, the Anointed Prophet, Priest and King, is the prominent
	thought; when the Person is prominent, "Jesus Christ" is
	the phrase used.
