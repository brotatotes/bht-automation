7. Greek, "That He
	might show forth (middle reflexive voice; for His own glory, Ephesians 1:6;
	Ephesians 1:12; Ephesians 1:14)
	in the ages which are coming on," that is, the blessed ages
	of the Gospel which supersede "the age (Greek, for
	'course') of this world" (Ephesians 1:14- :), and the past "ages" from which the mystery was
	hidden (Colossians 1:26; Colossians 1:27).
	These good ages, though beginning with the first preaching of the
	Gospel, and thenceforth continually succeeding one another,
	are not consummated till the Lord's coming again (compare Ephesians 1:21;
	Hebrews 6:5). The words, "coming
	on," do not exclude the time then present, but imply
	simply the ages following upon Christ's "raising them up
	together" spiritually (Hebrews 6:5- :). 
	kindness—"benignity."
	through Christ—rather,
	as Greek, "in Christ"; the same expression as is so
	often repeated, to mark that all our blessings center "IN
	HIM."
