13. "I entreat you not to
	be dispirited." 
	for you—in your behalf.
	which is—rather, "which
	are your glory," namely, inasmuch as showing that God
	loved you so much, as both to give His Son for you, and to permit His
	apostles to suffer "tribulations" for you [CHRYSOSTOM]
	in preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles. See on  :-, "prisoner for you Gentiles." My tribulations are
	your spiritual "glory," as your faith is furthered thereby
	(1 Corinthians 4:10).
