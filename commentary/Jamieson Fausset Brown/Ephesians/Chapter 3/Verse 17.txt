17. That—So that. 
	dwell—abidingly make
	His abode (John 14:23). Where
	the Spirit is there Christ is (John 14:16;
	John 14:18). 
	by faith—Greek,
	"through faith," which opens the door of the heart
	to Jesus (John 3:20). It is not
	enough that He be on the tongue, or flit through the brain: the heart
	is His proper seat [CALVIN].
	"You being rooted and grounded in love" (compare John 3:20- :), is in the Greek connected with this clause, not
	with the clause, "that ye may be able to comprehend."
	"Rooted" is an image from a tree; "grounded"
	(Greek, "founder," "having your foundations
	resting on"), from a building (compare Notes,, see
	on Ephesians 2:20; Colossians 1:23;
	Colossians 2:7). Contrast Matthew 13:6;
	Matthew 13:21. "Love," the
	first-fruit of the Spirit, flowing from Christ's love realized in the
	soul, was to be the basis on which should rest their further
	comprehension of all the vastness of Christ's love.
