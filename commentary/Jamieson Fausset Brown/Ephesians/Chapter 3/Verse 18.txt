	breadth . . . length . . .
	depth . . . height—namely, the full dimensions of the spiritual
	temple, answering to "the fulness of God" ( :-), to which the Church, according to its capacity, ought to
	correspond (compare Ephesians 4:10;
	Ephesians 4:13) as to "the fulness
	of Christ." The "breadth" implies Christ's
	world-wide love, embracing all men: the "length," its being
	extended through all ages (Ephesians 4:13- :); the "depth," its profound wisdom which no
	creature can fathom (Romans 11:33);
	the "height," its being beyond the reach of any foe to
	deprive us of (Ephesians 4:8)
	[BENGEL]. I prefer to
	understand "the breadth," &c., to refer to the whole
	of the vast mystery of free salvation in Christ for all, Gentile and
	Jew alike, of which Paul had been speaking (Ephesians 4:8- :), and of which he now prays they may have a fuller
	comprehension. As subsidiary to this, and the most essential part of
	it, he adds, "and to know the love of Christ" (Ephesians 4:8- :). GROTIUS
	understands depth and height of God's goodness raising
	us from the lowest depression to the greatest height.
