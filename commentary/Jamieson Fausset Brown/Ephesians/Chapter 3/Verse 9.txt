9. to make all men see—Greek,
	"to enlighten all" (Ephesians 1:18;
	Psalms 18:28; Hebrews 6:4).
	"All" (compare Colossians 1:28).
	fellowship—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "economy," or "dispensation"
	(compare Colossians 1:25; Colossians 1:26;
	and see on Ephesians 1:10, above).
	"To make all see how it hath seemed good to God at this time to
	dispense (through me and others, His stewards) what
	heretofore was a mystery." ELLICOTT
	explains it, "the arrangement," or "regulation"
	of the mystery (the union of Jews and Gentiles in Christ) which was
	now to be humbly traced and acknowledged in the fact of its having
	secretly existed in the counsel of God, and now having been revealed
	to the heavenly powers by means of the Church. 
	from the beginning of the
	world—Greek, "from (the beginning of) the ages."
	Compare Ephesians 1:4; Romans 16:25;
	1 Corinthians 2:7. The "ages" are
	the vast successive periods of time, marked by successive stages of
	creation and orders of beings. 
	in God—"hidden in"
	His counsels (Ephesians 1:9). 
	created all things by Jesus
	Christ—God's creation of the world and all things therein is
	the foundation of the rest of the "economy," which is
	freely dispensed according to the universal power of God [BENGEL].
	AS God created "the whole range of things" (so the Greek),
	physical and spiritual alike, He must have an absolute right to
	adjust all things as He will. Hence, we may see His right to keep the
	mystery of world-wide salvation in Christ "hidden in Himself,"
	till his own good time for revealing it. The oldest manuscripts omit
	"by Jesus Christ."
