2, 3. lowliness—In classic
	Greek, the meaning is meanness of spirit: the Gospel
	has elevated the word to express a Christian grace, namely, the
	esteeming of ourselves small, inasmuch as we are so; the thinking
	truly, and because truly, therefore lowlily, of ourselves [TRENCH].
	meekness—that spirit in
	which we accept God's dealings with us without disputing and
	resisting; and also the accepting patiently of the injuries done us
	by men, out of the thought that they are permitted by God for the
	chastening and purifying of His people ( :-; compare Galatians 6:1;
	2 Timothy 2:25; Titus 3:2).
	It is only the lowly, humble heart that is also meek
	(Colossians 3:12). As "lowliness
	and meekness" answer to "forbearing one another in love"
	(compare "love," Ephesians 4:15;
	Ephesians 4:16), so "long-suffering"
	answers to (Ephesians 4:4)
	"endeavoring (Greek, 'earnestly' or 'zealously
	giving diligence') to keep (maintain) the unity of the Spirit
	(the unity between men of different tempers, which flows from the
	presence of the Spirit, who is Himself 'one,' Ephesians 4:4- :) in (united in) the bond of peace" (the "bond"
	by which "peace" is maintained, namely, "love,"
	Colossians 3:14; Colossians 3:15
	[BENGEL]; or, "peace"
	itself is the "bond" meant, uniting the members of the
	Church [ALFORD]).
