22. That ye—following "Ye
	have been taught" (Ephesians 4:21).
	concerning the former
	conversation—"in respect to your former way of life."
	the old man—your old
	unconverted nature (Romans 6:6). 
	is corrupt according to the
	deceitful lusts—rather, "which is being corrupted
	('perisheth,' compare Galatians 6:8,
	'corruption,' that is, destruction) according to (that is, as
	might be expected from) the lusts of deceit." Deceit is
	personified; lusts are its servants and tools. In contrast to
	"the holiness of the truth," Galatians 6:8- :, and "truth in Jesus," Galatians 6:8- :; and answering to Gentile "vanity," Galatians 6:8- :. Corruption and destruction are inseparably associated
	together. The man's old-nature-lusts are his own executioners,
	fitting him more and more for eternal corruption and death.
