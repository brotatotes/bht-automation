26. Be ye angry, and sin not—So
	the Septuagint, Psalms 4:4.
	Should circumstances arise to call for anger on your part, let it be
	as Christ's "anger" (Psalms 4:4- :), without sin. Our natural feelings are not wrong when
	directed to their legitimate object, and when not exceeding due
	bounds. As in the future literal, so in the present spiritual,
	resurrection, no essential constituent is annihilated, but all that
	is a perversion of the original design is removed. Thus indignation
	at dishonor done to God, and wrong to man, is justifiable anger.
	Passion is sinful (derived from "passio,"
	suffering: implying that amidst seeming energy, a man is
	really passive, the slave of his anger, instead of ruling it).
	let not the sun go down upon
	your wrath—"wrath" is absolutely forbidden; "anger"
	not so, though, like poison sometimes used as medicine, it is to be
	used with extreme caution. The sense is not, Your anger shall
	not be imputed to you if you put it away before nightfall; but "let
	no wrath (that is, as the Greek, personal 'irritation'
	or 'exasperation') mingle with your 'anger,' even though, the latter
	be righteous, [TRENCH,
	Greek Synonyms of the New Testament]. "Put it away before
	sunset" (when the Jewish day began), is proverbial for put
	it away at once before another day begin (Psalms 4:4- :); also before you part with your brother for the night,
	perhaps never in this world to meet again. So JONA,
	"Let not night and anger against anyone sleep with you, but go
	and conciliate the other party, though he have been the first to
	commit the offense." Let not your "anger" at another's
	wickedness verge into hatred, or contempt, or revenge [VATABLUS].
