30. grieve not—A condescension
	to human modes of thought most touching. Compare "vexed
	His Holy Spirit" (Isaiah 63:10;
	Psalms 78:40); "fretted me"
	(Ezekiel 16:43: implying His
	tender love to us); and of hardened unbelievers, "resist the
	Holy Ghost" (Acts 7:51).
	This verse refers to believers, who grieve the Spirit by
	inconsistencies such as in the context are spoken of, corrupt or
	worthless conversation, c. 
	whereby ye are sealed—rather,
	"wherein (or 'in whom') ye were sealed." As in Acts 7:51- :, believers are said to be sealed "in"
	Christ, so here "in the Holy Spirit," who is
	one with Christ, and who reveals Christ in the soul: the Greek
	implies that the sealing was done already once for all. It is the
	Father "BY"
	whom believers, as well as the Son Himself, were sealed (Acts 7:51- :). The Spirit is represented as itself the seal (Acts 7:51- :, for the image employed, see on Acts 7:51- :). Here the Spirit is the element IN
	which the believer is sealed, His gracious influences being
	the seal itself. 
	unto—kept safely
	against the day of redemption, namely, of the completion of
	redemption in the deliverance of the body as well as the soul from
	all sin and sorrow (Ephesians 1:14
Luke 21:28; Romans 8:23).
