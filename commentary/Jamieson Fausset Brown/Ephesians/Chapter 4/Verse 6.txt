	through all—by means of
	Christ "who filleth all things" (Ephesians 4:10;
	Ephesians 2:20; Ephesians 2:21),
	and is "a propitiation" for all men (Ephesians 2:21- :). 
	in you all—The oldest
	manuscripts omit "you." Many of the oldest versions and
	Fathers and old manuscripts read, "in us all."
	Whether the pronoun be read or not, it must be understood (either
	from the "ye," Ephesians 4:4,
	or from the "us," Ephesians 4:4- :); for other parts of Scripture prove that the Spirit is not
	"in all" men, but only in believers (Romans 8:9;
	Romans 8:14). God is "Father"
	both by generation (as Creator) and regeneration (Ephesians 2:10;
	James 1:17; James 1:18;
	1 John 5:1).
