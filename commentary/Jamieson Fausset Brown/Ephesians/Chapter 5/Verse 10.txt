10. Provingâ€”construed with
	"walk" (Ephesians 5:8;
	Romans 12:1; Romans 12:2).
	As we prove a coin by the eye and the ear, and by using it, so by
	accurate and continued study, and above all by practice and
	experimental trial, we may prove or test "what is acceptable
	unto the Lord." This is the office of "light," of
	which believers are "children," to manifest what each thing
	is, whether sightly or unsightly.
