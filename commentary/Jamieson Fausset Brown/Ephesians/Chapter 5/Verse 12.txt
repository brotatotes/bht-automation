12. The Greek order is,
	"For the things done in secret by them, it is a shame even to
	speak of." The "for" gives his reason for "not
	naming" (compare Ephesians 5:3)
	in detail the works of darkness, whereas he describes definitely (Ephesians 5:3- :) "the fruit of the light" [BENGEL].
	"Speak of," I think, is used here as "speaking of
	without reproving," in contrast to "even reprove
	them." Thus the "for" expresses this, Reprove them,
	for to speak of them without reproving them, is a shame
	(Ephesians 5:3). Thus "works of
	darkness" answers to "things done in secret."
