14. Wherefore—referring to the
	whole foregoing argument (Ephesians 5:8;
	Ephesians 5:11; Ephesians 5:13).
	Seeing that light (spiritual) dispels the pre-existing darkness, He
	(God) saith . . . (compare the same phrase, Ephesians 5:13- :). 
	Awake—The reading of
	all the oldest manuscripts is "Up!" or, "Rouse thee!"
	a phrase used in stirring men to activity. The words are a paraphrase
	of Isaiah 60:1; Isaiah 60:2,
	not an exact quotation. The word "Christ," shows that in
	quoting the prophecy, he views it in the light thrown on it by its
	Gospel fulfilment. As Israel is called on to "awake"
	from its previous state of "darkness" and "death"
	(Isaiah 59:10; Isaiah 60:2),
	for that her Light is come; so the Church, and each individual is
	similarly called to awake. Believers are called on to "awake"
	out of sleep; unbelievers, to "arise" from the dead
	(compare Matthew 25:5; Romans 13:11;
	1 Thessalonians 5:6; Ephesians 2:1).
	Christ—"the true
	light," "the Sun of righteousness." 
	give thee light—rather,
	as Greek, "shall shine upon thee" (so enabling thee
	by being "made manifest" to become, and be, by the very
	fact, "light," Ephesians 5:13;
	then being so "enlightened," Ephesians 5:13- :, thou shalt be able, by "reproving," to enlighten
	others).
