25. "Thou hast seen the
	measure of obedience; now hear also the measure of love. Do you wish
	your wife to obey you, as the Church is to obey Christ? Then have a
	solicitude for her as Christ had for the Church ( :-, "Himself the Saviour of the body"); and "if
	it be necessary to give thy life for her, or to be cut in ten
	thousand pieces, or to endure any other suffering whatever, do not
	refuse it; and if you suffer thus, not even so do you do what Christ
	has done; for you indeed do so being already united to her, but He
	did so for one that treated Him with aversion and hatred. As,
	therefore, He brought to His feet one that so treated Him, and that
	even wantonly spurned Him, by much tenderness of regard, not by
	threats, insults, and terror: so also do you act towards your wife,
	and though you see her disdainful and wantonly wayward, you will be
	able to bring her to your feet by much thoughtfulness for her, by
	love, by kindness. For no bound is more sovereign in binding than
	such bonds, especially in the case of husband and wife. For one may
	constrain a servant by fear, though not even he is so to be bound to
	you; for he may readily run away. But the companion of your life, the
	mother of your children, the basis of all your joy, you ought to bind
	to you, not by fear and threats, but by love and attachment"

	"gave Himself up." 
	for it—Translate, "for
	her." The relation of the Church to Christ is the ground
	of Christianity's having raised woman to her due place in the social
	scale, from which she was, and is, excluded in heathen lands.
