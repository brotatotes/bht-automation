26. sanctify—that is,
	consecrate her to God. Compare  :-, meaning, "I devote Myself as a holy
	sacrifice, that My disciples also may be devoted or consecrated as
	holy in (through) the truth" [NEANDER]

	Hebrews 13:12 see on Hebrews 13:12- :). 
	and cleanse—rather, as

	Add the word to the element, and it becomes a sacrament, being itself
	as it were the visible word." The regenerating efficacy of
	baptism is conveyed in, and by, the divine word alone.
