32. Rather, "This mystery
	is a great one." This profound truth, beyond man's power of
	discovering, but now revealed, namely, of the spiritual
	union of Christ and the Church, represented by the marriage union, is
	a great one, of deep import. See on  :-. So "mystery" is used of a divine truth not to be
	discovered save by revelation of God (Romans 11:25;
	1 Corinthians 15:51). The Vulgate
	wrongly translates, "This is a great sacrament,"
	which is made the plea by the Romish Church (in spite of the blunder
	having been long ago exposed by their own commentators, CAJETAN
	and ESTIUS) for making
	marriage a sacrament; it is plain not marriage in general, but
	that of Christ and the Church, is what is pronounced to be a "great
	mystery," as the words following prove, "I
	[emphatic] say it in regard to Christ and to the Church" (so the
	Greek is best translated). "I, while I quote these words
	out of Scripture, use them in a higher sense" [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON].
