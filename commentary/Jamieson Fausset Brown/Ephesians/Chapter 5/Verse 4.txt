4. filthiness—obscenity in act
	or gesture.
foolish talking—the
	talk of fools, which is folly and sin together. The Greek
	of it, and of "filthiness," occurs nowhere else in the New
	Testament. 
	nor—rather, "or"
	(compare Ephesians 5:3). 
	jesting—Greek,
	"eutrapelia"; found nowhere else in the New
	Testament: implying strictly that versatility which turns
	about and adapts itself, without regard to principle, to the shifting
	circumstances of the moment, and to the varying moods of those with
	whom it may deal. Not scurrile buffoonery, but refined "persiflage"
	and "badinage," for which Ephesus was famed [PLAUTUS,
	A Boastful Soldier, 3.1,42-52], and which, so far from being
	censured, was and is thought by the world a pleasant accomplishment.
	In Colossians 3:8, "filthy
	communication" refers to the foulness; "foolish
	talking," to the folly; "jesting," to the false
	refinement (and trifling witticism [TITTMANN])
	Of discourse unseasoned with the salt of grace [TRENCH].
	not convenient—"unseemly";
	not such "as become saints" (Colossians 3:8- :). 
	rather giving of thanks—a
	happy play on sounds in Greek, "eucharistia"
	contrasted with "eutrapelia"; refined "jesting"
	and subtle humor sometimes offend the tender feelings of grace;
	"giving of thanks" gives that real cheerfulness of spirit
	to believers which the worldly try to get from "jesting"
	(Ephesians 5:19; Ephesians 5:20;
	James 5:13).
