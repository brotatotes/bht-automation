6. vain—empty, unreal words,
	namely, palliations of "uncleanness," Ephesians 5:3;
	Ephesians 5:4; Isaiah 5:20
	(that it is natural to indulge in love), "covetousness"
	(that it is useful to society that men should pursue gain), and
	"jesting" (that it is witty and clever, and that God will
	not so severely punish for such things). 
	because of these
	things—uncleanness, covetousness, c. (Isaiah 5:20- :). 
	cometh—present, not
	merely "shall come." Is as sure as if already come. 
	children—rather, "sons
	of disobedience" (Ephesians 2:2
Ephesians 2:3). The children of
	unbelief in doctrine (Deuteronomy 32:20)
	are "children of disobedience" in practice, and
	these again are "children of wrath."
