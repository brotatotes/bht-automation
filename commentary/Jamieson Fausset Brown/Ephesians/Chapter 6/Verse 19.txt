19. for me—a different Greek
	preposition from that in Ephesians 6:18;
	translate, therefore, "on my behalf." 
	that I may open my mouth
	boldly—rather, "that there may be given to me 'utterance,'
	or 'speech' in the opening of my mouth (when I undertake to
	speak; a formula used in set and solemn speech, Job 3:1;
	Daniel 10:16), so as with
	boldness to make known," c. Bold plainness of speech was the
	more needed, as the Gospel is a "mystery" undiscoverable by
	mere reason, and only known by revelation. Paul looked for utterance
	to be given him he did not depend on his natural or acquired
	power. The shortest road to any heart is by way of heaven; pray to
	God to open the door and to open your mouth, so as to avail yourself
	of every opening (Jeremiah 1:7;
	Jeremiah 1:8; Ezekiel 3:8;
	Ezekiel 3:9; Ezekiel 3:11;
	2 Corinthians 4:13).
