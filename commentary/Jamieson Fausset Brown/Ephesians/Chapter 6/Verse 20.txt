20. For—Greek, as in
	Ephesians 6:19, "On behalf of
	which." 
	an ambassador in bonds—a
	paradox. Ambassadors were held inviolable by the law of nations, and
	could not, without outrage to every sacred right, be put in chains.
	Yet Christ's "ambassador is in a chain!" The Greek
	is singular. The Romans used to bind a prisoner to a soldier by a
	single chain, in a kind of free custody. So Acts 28:16;
	Acts 28:20, "I am bound with
	this chain." The term, "bonds" (plural), on the
	other hand, is used when the prisoner's hands or feet were bound
	together (Acts 26:29); compare
	Acts 12:6, where the plural marks
	the distinction. The singular is only used of the particular kind of
	custody described above; an undesigned coincidence [PALEY].
