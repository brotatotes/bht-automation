1. apostle—in the earliest
	Epistles, the two to the Thessalonians, through humility, he uses no
	title of authority; but associates with him "Silvanus and
	Timotheus"; yet here, though "brethren" ( :-) are with him, he does not name them but puts his own
	name and apostleship prominent: evidently because his apostolic
	commission needs now to be vindicated against deniers of it. 
	of—Greek,
	"from." Expressing the origin from which his mission
	came, "not from men," but from Christ and the Father
	(understood) as the source. "By" expresses the immediate
	operating agent in the call. Not only was the call from God as
	its ultimate source, but by Christ and the Father as the
	immediate agent in calling him (Acts 22:15;
	Acts 26:16-18). The laying
	on of Ananias' hands (Acts 9:17)
	is no objection to this; for that was but a sign of the fact, not an
	assisting cause. So the Holy Ghost calls him specially (Acts 13:2;
	Acts 13:3); he was an apostle
	before this special mission. 
	man—singular; to mark
	the contrast to "Jesus Christ." The opposition between
	"Christ" and "man," and His name being put in
	closest connection with God the Father, imply His Godhead. 
	raised him from the
	dead—implying that, though he had not seen Him in His
	humiliation as the other apostles (which was made an objection
	against him), he had seen and been constituted an apostle by Him
	in His resurrection power (Matthew 28:18;
	Romans 1:4; Romans 1:5).
	Compare as to the ascension, the consequence of the resurrection, and
	the cause of His giving "apostles," Romans 1:5- :. He rose again, too, for our justification (Romans 1:5- :); thus Paul prepares the way for the prominent subject of
	the Epistle, justification in Christ, not by the law.
