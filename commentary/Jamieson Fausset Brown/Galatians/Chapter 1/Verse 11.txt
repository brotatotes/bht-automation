11. certify—I made known to
	you as to the Gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after
	man, that is, not of, by, or from man (Galatians 1:1;
	Galatians 1:12). It is not according
	to man; not influenced by mere human considerations, as it would be,
	if it were of human origin. 
	brethren—He not till
	now calls them so.
