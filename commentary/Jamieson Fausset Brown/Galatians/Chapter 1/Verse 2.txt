2. all the brethren—I am not
	alone in my doctrine; all my colleagues in the Gospel work,
	travelling with me (Acts 19:29,
	Gaius and Aristarchus at Ephesus: Acts 19:29- :, Sopater, Secundus, Timotheus, Tychicus, Trophimus, some, or
	all of these), join with me. Not that these were joint authors
	with Paul of the Epistle: but joined him in the sentiments and
	salutations. The phrase, "all the brethren," accords
	with a date when he had many travelling companions, he and they
	having to bear jointly the collection to Jerusalem [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON]. 
	the churches—Pessinus
	and Ancyra were the principal cities; but doubtless there were many
	other churches in Galatia (Acts 18:23;
	1 Corinthians 16:1). He does not attach any
	honorable title to the churches here, as elsewhere, being displeased
	at their Judaizing. See First Corinthians; First Thessalonians, &c.
	The first Epistle of Peter is addressed to Jewish Christians
	sojourning in Galatia (1 Peter 1:1),
	among other places mentioned. It is interesting thus to find the
	apostle of the circumcision, as well as the apostle of the
	uncircumcision, once at issue (1 Peter 1:1- :), co-operating to build up the same churches.
