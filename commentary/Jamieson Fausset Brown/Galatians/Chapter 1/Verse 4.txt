	Pastoral Epistles. The Greek is different in  :- (see on  :-). 
	for our sins—which
	enslaved us to the present evil world. 
	deliver us from this—Greek,
	"out of the," c. The Father and Son are each said to
	"deliver us," &c. ( :-): but the Son, not the Father, gave Himself for us in
	order to do so, and make us citizens of a better world ( :-). The Galatians in desiring to return to legal bondage are,
	he implies, renouncing the deliverance which Christ wrought
	for us. This he more fully repeats in  :-. "Deliver" is the very word used by the Lord as to

	"age" system or course of the world, regarded
	from a religious point of view. The present age opposes the
	"glory" (Galatians 1:5) of
	God, and is under the authority of the Evil One. The "ages of
	ages" (Greek, Galatians 1:5)
	are opposed to "the present evil age." 
	according to the will of God
	and our Father—Greek, "of Him who is at once God
	[the sovereign Creator] and our Father" (John 6:38;
	John 6:39; John 10:18,
	end). Without merit of ours. His sovereignty as "GOD,"
	and our filial relation to Him as "OUR
	FATHER," ought to
	keep us from blending our own legal notions (as the Galatians were
	doing) with His will and plan. This paves the way for his argument.
