7. another—A distinct Greek
	word from that in Galatians 1:6. Though
	I called it a gospel (Galatians 1:6),
	it is not really so. There is really but one Gospel, and no
	other gospel. 
	but—Translate, "Only
	that there are some that trouble you," c. (Galatians 5:10
Galatians 5:12). All I meant by the
	"different gospel" was nothing but a perversion by "some"
	of the one Gospel of Christ. 
	would pervert—Greek,
	"wish to pervert"; they could not really pervert the
	Gospel, though they could pervert Gospel professors (compare Galatians 4:9;
	Galatians 4:17; Galatians 4:21;
	Galatians 6:12; Galatians 6:13;
	Colossians 2:18). Though acknowledging
	Christ, they insisted on circumcision and Jewish ordinances and
	professed to rest on the authority of other apostles, namely, Peter
	and James. But Paul recognizes no gospel, save the pure Gospel.
