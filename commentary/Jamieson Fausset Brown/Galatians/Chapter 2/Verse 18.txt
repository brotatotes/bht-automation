18. Greek, "For if
	the things which I overthrew (by the faith of Christ), those very
	things I build up again (namely, legal righteousness, by subjecting
	myself to the law), I prove myself (literally, 'I commend myself') a
	transgressor." Instead of commending yourself as you sought to
	do (Galatians 2:12, end), you merely
	commend yourself as a transgressor. The "I" is intended by
	Paul for Peter to take to himself, as it is his case,
	not Paul's own, that is described. A "transgressor" is
	another word for "sinner" (in Galatians 2:12- :), for "sin is the transgression of the law."
	You, Peter, by now asserting the law to be obligatory, are proving
	yourself a "sinner," or "transgressor," in your
	having set it aside by living as the Gentiles, and with them. Thus
	you are debarred by transgression from justification by the law, and
	you debar yourself from justification by Christ, since in your theory
	He becomes a minister of sin.
