	not even for an hour did we yield by subjection." ALFORD
	renders the Greek article, "with THE
	subjection required of us." The sense rather is, We would

	Colossians 1:5) was at stake (namely,
	the fundamental truth of justification by faith only, without the
	works of the law, contrasted with another Gospel, Colossians 1:5- :). Truth precise, unaccommodating, abandons nothing that
	belongs to itself, admits nothing that is inconsistent with it
	[BENGEL].

	liberties, which you are now renouncing.
