	oldest manuscripts, even before Peter, as being bishop of Jerusalem,
	and so presiding at the council ( :-). He was called "the Just," from his strict
	adherence to the law, and so was especially popular among the Jewish
	party though he did not fall into their extremes; whereas Peter was
	somewhat estranged from them through his intercourse with the Gentile
	Christians. To each apostle was assigned the sphere best suited to
	his temperament: to James, who was tenacious of the law, the
	Jerusalem Jews; to Peter, who had opened the door to the Gentiles but
	who was Judaically disposed, the Jews of the dispersion; to Paul,
	who, by the miraculous and overwhelming suddenness of his conversion,
	had the whole current of his early Jewish prejudices turned into an
	utterly opposite direction, the Gentiles. Not separately and
	individually, but collectively the apostles together represented
	Christ, the One Head, in the apostleship. The twelve
	foundation-stones of various colors are joined together to the one
	great foundation-stone on which they rest (1 Corinthians 3:11;
	Revelation 21:14; Revelation 21:19;
	Revelation 21:20). John had got an
	intimation in Jesus' lifetime of the admission of the Gentiles (Revelation 21:20- :).

	Revelation 3:12).
