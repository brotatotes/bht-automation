14. The intent of "Christ
	becoming a curse for us"; "To the end that upon the
	Gentiles the blessing of Abraham (that is, promised to
	Abraham, namely, justification by faith) might come in Christ Jesus"
	(compare Galatians 3:8). 
	that we might receive the
	promise of the Spirit—the promised Spirit (Joel 2:28;
	Joel 2:29; Luke 24:49).
	This clause follows not the clause immediately preceding (for our
	receiving the Spirit is not the result of the blessing of
	Abraham coming on the Gentiles), but "Christ hath redeemed
	us," &c. 
	through faith—not by
	works. Here he resumes the thought in Luke 24:49- :. "The Spirit from without, kindles within us some spark
	of faith Whereby we lay hold of Christ, and even of the Spirit
	Himself, that He may dwell within us" [FLACIUS].
