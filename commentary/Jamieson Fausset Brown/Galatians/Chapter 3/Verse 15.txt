15. I speak after the manner of
	men—I take an illustration from a merely human transaction of
	everyday occurrence. 
	but a man's covenant—whose
	purpose it is far less important to maintain. 
	if it be confirmed—when
	once it hath been ratified. 
	no man disannulleth—"none
	setteth aside," not even the author himself, much less any
	second party. None does so who acts in common equity. Much less would
	the righteous God do so. The law is here, by personification,
	regarded as a second person, distinct from, and subsequent to, the
	promise of God. The promise is everlasting, and more peculiarly
	belongs to God. The law is regarded as something extraneous,
	afterwards introduced, exceptional and temporary (Galatians 3:17-19;
	Galatians 3:21-24). 
	addeth—None addeth new
	conditions "making" the covenant "of none effect"
	(Galatians 3:17). So legal Judaism
	could make no alteration in the fundamental relation between God and
	man, already established by the promises to Abraham; it could not add
	as a new condition the observance of the law, in which case the
	fulfilment of the promise would be attached to a condition impossible
	for man to perform. The "covenant" here is one of free
	grace, a promise afterwards carried into effect in the Gospel.
