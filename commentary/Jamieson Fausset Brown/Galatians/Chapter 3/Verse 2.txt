2. "Was it by the works of
	the law that ye received the Spirit (manifested by outward miracles,
	Galatians 3:5; Mark 16:17;
	Hebrews 2:4; and by spiritual graces,
	Galatians 3:14; Galatians 4:5;
	Galatians 4:6; Ephesians 1:13),
	or by the hearing of faith?" The "only" implies, "I
	desire, omitting other arguments, to rest the question on this
	alone"; I who was your teacher, desire now to "learn"
	this one thing from you. The epithet "Holy" is not prefixed
	to "Spirit" because that epithet is a joyous one, whereas
	this Epistle is stern and reproving [BENGEL].
	hearing of faithâ€”Faith
	consists not in working, but in receiving (Romans 10:16;
	Romans 10:17).
