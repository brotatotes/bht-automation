21. "Is the law
	(which involves a mediator) against the promises of God (which are
	without a mediator, and rest on God alone and immediately)?
	God forbid." 
	lifeâ€”The law, as an
	externally prescribed rule, can never internally impart spiritual
	life to men naturally dead in sin, and change the disposition. If the
	law had been a law capable of giving life, "verily (in
	very reality, and not in the mere fancy of legalists) righteousness
	would have been by the law (for where life is, there righteousness,
	its condition, must also be)." But the law does not
	pretend to give life, and therefore not righteousness; so
	there is no opposition between the law and the promise. Righteousness
	can only come through the promise to Abraham, and through its
	fulfilment in the Gospel of grace.
