22. But—as the law cannot give
	life or righteousness [ALFORD].
	Or the "But" means, So far is righteousness from
	being of the law, that the knowledge of sin is rather what
	comes of the law [BENGEL].
	the scripture—which
	began to be written after the time of the promise, at the time when
	the law was given. The written letter was needed SO as
	PERMANENTLY to convict man
	of disobedience to God's command. Therefore he says, "the
	Scripture," not the "Law." Compare  :-, "Scripture," for "the God of the Scripture."
	concluded—"shut
	up," under condemnation, as in a prison. Compare  :-, "As prisoners gathered in the pit and shut up in the
	prison." Beautifully contrasted with "the liberty wherewith
	Christ makes free," which follows, Galatians 3:7;
	Galatians 3:9; Galatians 3:25;
	Galatians 3:26; Galatians 5:1;
	Isaiah 61:1. 
	all—Greek
	neuter, "the universe of things": the whole world, man, and
	all that appertains to him. 
	under sin— (Romans 3:9;
	Romans 3:19; Romans 11:32).
	the promise—the
	inheritance promised (Galatians 3:18).
	by faith of Jesus Christ—that
	is which is by faith in Jesus Christ. 
	might be given—The
	emphasis is on "given": that it might be a free gift;
	not something earned by the works of the law (Galatians 3:18- :). 
	to them that believe—to
	them that have "the faith of (in) Jesus Christ" just spoken
	of.
