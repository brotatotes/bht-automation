24. "So that the law
	hath been (that is, hath turned out to be) our
	schoolmaster (or "tutor," literally, "pedagogue":
	this term, among the Greeks, meant a faithful servant entrusted with
	the care of the boy from childhood to puberty, to keep him from evil,
	physical and moral, and accompany him to his amusements and studies)
	to guide us unto Christ," with whom we are no longer "shut
	up" in bondage, but are freemen. "Children"
	(literally, infants) need such tutoring ( :-). 
	might be—rather, "that
	we may be justified by faith"; which we could not be till
	Christ, the object of faith, had come. Meanwhile the law, by
	outwardly checking the sinful propensity which was constantly giving
	fresh proof of its refractoriness—as thus the consciousness of the
	power of the sinful principle became more vivid, and hence the sense
	of need both of forgiveness of sin and freedom from its bondage was
	awakened—the law became a "schoolmaster to guide us unto
	Christ" [NEANDER].
	The moral law shows us what we ought to do, and so we learn
	our inability to do it. In the ceremonial law we seek, by
	animal sacrifices, to answer for our not having done it, but find
	dead victims no satisfaction for the sins of living men, and that
	outward purifying will not cleanse the soul; and that therefore we
	need an infinitely better Sacrifice, the antitype of all the legal
	sacrifices. Thus delivered up to the judicial law, we see how
	awful is the doom we deserve: thus the law at last leads us to
	Christ, with whom we find righteousness and peace. "Sin, sin!
	is the word heard again and again in the Old Testament. Had it not
	there for centuries rung in the ear, and fastened on the conscience,
	the joyful sound, "grace for grace," would not have been
	the watchword of the New Testament. This was the end of the whole
	system of sacrifices" [THOLUCK].
