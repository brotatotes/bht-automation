25. "But now that
	faith is come," &c. Moses the lawgiver cannot bring us into
	the heavenly Canaan though he can bring us to the border of it. At
	that point he is superseded by Joshua, the type of Jesus, who leads
	the true Israel into their inheritance. The law leads us to Christ,
	and there its office ceases.
