28. There is in this sonship by
	faith in Christ, no class privileged above another, as the Jews under
	the law had been above the Gentiles (Romans 10:12;
	1 Corinthians 12:13; Colossians 3:11).
	bond nor free—Christ
	alike belongs to both by faith; whence he puts "bond"
	before "free." Compare Note, see on Colossians 3:11- :; Colossians 3:11- :. 
	neither male nor
	female—rather, as Greek, "there is not male
	and female." There is no distinction into male and
	female. Difference of sex makes no difference in Christian
	privileges. But under the law the male sex had great privileges.
	Males alone had in their body circumcision, the sign of the covenant
	(contrast baptism applied to male and female alike); they
	alone were capable of being kings and priests, whereas all of either
	sex are now "kings and priests unto God" (Colossians 3:11- :); they had prior right to inheritances. In the resurrection
	the relation of the sexes shall cease (Colossians 3:11- :). 
	one—Greek, "one
	man"; masculine, not neuter, namely "one new man" in
	Christ (Ephesians 2:15).
