4. Have ye suffered so many
	things—namely, persecution from Jews and from unbelieving
	fellow countrymen, incited by the Jews, at the time of your
	conversion. 
	in vain—fruitlessly,
	needlessly, since ye might have avoided them by professing
	Judaism [GROTIUS]. Or,
	shall ye, by falling from grace, lose the reward promised for all
	your sufferings, so that they shall be "in vain" (Galatians 4:11;
	1 Corinthians 15:2; 1 Corinthians 15:17-19;
	1 Corinthians 15:29-32; 2 Thessalonians 1:5-7;
	2 John 1:8)? 
	yet—rather, "If it
	be really (or 'indeed') in vain" [ELLICOTT].
	"If, as it must be, what I have said, 'in vain,' is really the
	fact" [ALFORD]. I
	prefer understanding it as a mitigation of the preceding words. I
	hope better things of you, for I trust you will return from legalism
	to grace; if so, as I confidently expect, you will not have
	"suffered so many things in vain" [ESTIUS].
	For "God has given you the Spirit and has wrought mighty works
	among you" (Galatians 3:5; Hebrews 10:32-36)
	[BENGEL].
