12. be as I am—"As I have
	in my life among you cast off Jewish habits, so do ye; for I am
	become as ye are," namely, in the non-observance of legal
	ordinances. "The fact of my laying them aside among Gentiles,
	shows that I regard them as not at all contributing to
	justification or sanctification. Do you regard them in the
	same light, and act accordingly." His observing the law among
	the Jews was not inconsistent with this, for he did so only in order
	to win them, without compromising principle. On the other hand, the
	Galatian Gentiles, by adopting legal ordinances, showed that they
	regarded them as needful for salvation. This Paul combats. 
	ye have not injured me at
	all—namely, at the period when I first preached the Gospel
	among you, and when I made myself as you are, namely, living as a
	Gentile, not as a Jew. You at that time did me no wrong; "ye
	did not despise my temptation in the flesh" ( :-): nay, you "received me as an angel of God." Then
	in Galatians 4:16, he asks, "Have
	I then, since that time, become your enemy by telling you the
	truth?"
