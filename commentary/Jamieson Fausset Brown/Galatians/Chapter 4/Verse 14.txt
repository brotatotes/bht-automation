14. my temptation—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "your temptation." My infirmity, which
	was, or might have been, a "temptation," or trial, to
	you, ye despised not, that is, ye were not tempted by it to
	despise me and my message. Perhaps, however, it is better to
	punctuate and explain as LACHMANN,
	connecting it with Galatians 4:13,
	"And (ye know) your temptation (that is, the temptation to which
	ye were exposed through the infirmity) which was in my flesh. Ye
	despised not (through natural pride), nor rejected (through
	spiritual pride), but received me," &c. "Temptation
	does not mean here, as we now use the word, tendency to an evil
	habit, but BODILY TRIAL."
	as an angel of God—as a
	heaven-inspired and sent messenger from God: angel
	means "messenger" (Galatians 4:13- :). Compare the phrase, Galatians 4:13- :, a Hebrew and Oriental one for a person to be received with
	the highest respect (Zechariah 12:8).
	An angel is free from the flesh, infirmity, and temptation.
as Christ—being
	Christ's representative (Zechariah 12:8- :). Christ is Lord of angels.
