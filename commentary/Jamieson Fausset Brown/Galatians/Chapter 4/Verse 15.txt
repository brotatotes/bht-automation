15. Where, c.—Of what value
	was your congratulation (so the Greek for "blessedness"
	expresses) of yourselves, on account of your having among you me, the
	messenger of the Gospel, considering how entirely you have veered
	about since? Once you counted yourselves blessed in being
	favored with my ministry. 
	ye would have plucked out
	your own eyes—one of the dearest members of the body—so
	highly did you value me: a proverbial phrase for the greatest
	self-sacrifice (Matthew 5:29).
	CONYBEARE and HOWSON
	think that this particular form of proverb was used with reference to
	a weakness in Paul's eyes, connected with a nervous frame, perhaps
	affected by the brightness of the vision described, Acts 22:11
2 Corinthians 12:1-7. "You would
	have torn out your own eyes to supply the lack of mine." The
	divine power of Paul's words and works, contrasting with the
	feebleness of his person (2 Corinthians 12:1-47.12.7- :), powerfully at first impressed the Galatians, who had all
	the impulsiveness of the Celtic race from which they sprang.
	Subsequently they soon changed with the fickleness which is equally
	characteristic of Celts.
