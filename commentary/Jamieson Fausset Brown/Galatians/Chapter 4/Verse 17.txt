17. They—your flatterers: in
	contrast to Paul himself, who tells them the truth.
zealously—zeal in
	proselytism was characteristic especially of the Jews, and so of
	Judaizers (Galatians 1:14; Matthew 23:15;
	Romans 10:2). 
	affect you—that is,
	court you (2 Corinthians 11:2). 
	not well—not in a good
	way, or for a good end. Neither the cause of their zealous
	courting of you, nor the manner, is what it ought to be. 
	they would exclude you—"They
	wish to shut you out" from the kingdom of God (that is, they
	wish to persuade you that as uncircumcised Gentiles, you are shut out
	from it), "that ye may zealously court them," that
	is, become circumcised, as zealous followers of themselves. ALFORD
	explains it, that their wish was to shut out the Galatians from the
	general community, and attract them as a separate clique to their own
	party. So the English word "exclusive," is used.
