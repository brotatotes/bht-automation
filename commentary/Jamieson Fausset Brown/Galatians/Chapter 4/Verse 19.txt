19. My little children—
	(1 Timothy 1:18; 2 Timothy 2:1;
	1 John 2:1). My relation to you is
	not merely that of one zealously courting you (Galatians 4:17;
	Galatians 4:18), but that of a father
	to his children (1 Corinthians 4:15).
	I travail in birth—that
	is, like a mother in pain till the birth of her child. 
	again—a second time.
	The former time was when I was "present with you" (1 Corinthians 4:15- :; compare Note, see on 1 Corinthians 4:15- :). 
	Christ be formed in you—that
	you may live nothing but Christ, and think nothing but Christ (1 Corinthians 4:15- :), and glory in nothing but Him, and His death, resurrection,
	and righteousness (Philippians 3:8-10;
	Colossians 1:27).
