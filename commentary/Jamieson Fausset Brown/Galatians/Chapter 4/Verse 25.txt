25. Translate, "For this
	word, Hagar, is (imports) Mount Sinai in Arabia (that is,
	among the Arabians—in the Arabian tongue)." So
	CHRYSOSTOM explains.
	Haraut, the traveller, says that to this day the Arabians call Sinai,
	"Hadschar," that is, Hagar, meaning a rock or
	stone. Hagar twice fled into the desert of Arabia (Genesis 16:1-16;
	Genesis 21:9-21): from her the
	mountain and city took its name, and the people were called
	Hagarenes. Sinai, with its rugged rocks, far removed from the
	promised land, was well suited to represent the law which inspires
	with terror, and the spirit of bondage. 
	answereth—literally,
	"stands in the same rank with"; "she corresponds to."
	Jerusalem which now is—that
	is, the Jerusalem of the Jews, having only a present temporary
	existence, in contrast with the spiritual Jerusalem of the Gospel,
	which in germ, under the form of the promise, existed ages
	before, and shall be for ever in ages to come. 
	and—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "For she is in bondage." As Hagar
	was in bondage to her mistress, so Jerusalem that now is, is in
	bondage to the law, and also to the Romans: her civil state thus
	being in accordance with her spiritual state [BENGEL].
