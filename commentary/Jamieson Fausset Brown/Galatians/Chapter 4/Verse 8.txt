	back from their privileges as free sons, to legal bondage again. 
	then—when ye were
	"servants" (Galatians 4:7). 
	ye knew not God—not
	opposed to Romans 1:21. The heathen
	originally knew God, as Romans 1:21- : states, but did not choose to retain God in their knowledge,
	and so corrupted the original truth. They might still have
	known Him, in a measure, from His works, but as a matter of fact they
	knew Him not, so far as His eternity, His power as the Creator, and
	His holiness, are concerned. 
	are no gods—that is,
	have no existence, such as their worshippers attribute to them, in
	the nature of things, but only in the corrupt imaginations of their
	worshippers (see on Romans 1:21- :; Romans 1:21- :; 2 Chronicles 13:9). Your
	"service" was a different bondage from that of the Jews,
	which was a true service. Yet theirs, like yours, was a burdensome
	yoke; how then is it ye wish to resume the yoke after that God has
	transferred both Jews and Gentiles to a free service?
