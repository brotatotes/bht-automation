12. they . . . which trouble
	you—Translate, as the Greek is different from  :-, "they who are unsettling you." 
	were even cut off—even
	as they desire your foreskin to be cut off and cast away by
	circumcision, so would that they were even cut off from your
	communion, being worthless as a castaway foreskin (Galatians 1:7;
	Galatians 1:8; compare Galatians 1:8- :). The fathers, JEROME,
	AMBROSE, AUGUSTINE,
	and CHRYSOSTOM, explain
	it, "Would that they would even cut themselves off," that
	is, cut off not merely the foreskin, but the whole member: if
	circumcision be not enough for them, then let them have
	excision also; an outburst hardly suitable to the gravity of
	an apostle. But Galatians 5:9; Galatians 5:10
	plainly point to excommunication as the judgment threatened
	against the troublers: and danger of the bad "leaven"
	spreading, as the reason for it.
