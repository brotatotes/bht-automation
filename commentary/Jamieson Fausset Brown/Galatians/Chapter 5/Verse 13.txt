13. The "ye" is
	emphatical, from its position in the Greek, "Ye
	brethren"; as opposed to those legalists "who trouble you."
	unto liberty—The Greek
	expresses, "on a footing of liberty." The state or
	condition in which ye have been called to salvation, is one of
	liberty. Gospel liberty consists in three things, freedom from the
	Mosaic yoke, from sin, and from slavish fear. 
	only, c.—Translate,
	"Only turn not your liberty into an occasion for the
	flesh." Do not give the flesh the handle or pretext ( :-, "occasion") for its indulgence which it eagerly
	seeks for do not let it make Christian "liberty" its
	pretext for indulgence (Galatians 5:16;
	Galatians 5:17; 1 Peter 2:16;
	2 Peter 2:19; Judges 1:4).
	but by love serve one
	another—Greek, "Be servants (be in bondage) to one
	another." If ye must be servants, then be servants to
	one another in love. While free as to legalism, be bound
	by Love (the article in the Greek personifies love in the
	abstract) to serve one another (Judges 1:4- :). Here he hints at their unloving strifes springing out of
	lust of power. "For the lust of power is the mother of heresies"
