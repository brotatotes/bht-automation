17. For—the reason why walking
	by the Spirit will exclude fulfilling the lusts of the flesh, namely,
	their mutual contrariety. 
	the Spirit—not
	"lusteth," but "tendeth (or some such word is to be
	supplied) against the flesh." 
	so that ye cannot do the
	things that ye would—The Spirit strives against the flesh and
	its evil influence; the flesh against the Spirit and His good
	influence, so that neither the one nor the other can be fully
	carried out into action. "But" ( :-) where "the Spirit" prevails, the issue of the
	struggle no longer continues doubtful ( :-) [BENGEL]. The
	Greek is, "that ye may not do the things that ye would."
	"The flesh and Spirit are contrary one to the other," so
	that you must distinguish what proceeds from the Spirit, and what
	from the flesh; and you must not fulfil what you desire according
	to the carnal self, but what the Spirit within you desires
	[NEANDER]. But the
	antithesis of Galatians 5:18 ("But,"
	c.), where the conflict is decided, shows, I think, that here
	Galatians 5:17 contemplates the
	inability both for fully accomplishing the good we "would,"
	owing to the opposition of the flesh, and for doing the evil
	our flesh would desire, owing to the opposition of the Spirit
	in the awakened man (such as the Galatians are assumed to be), until
	we yield ourselves wholly by the Spirit to "walk by the Spirit"
	(Galatians 5:16 Galatians 5:18).
