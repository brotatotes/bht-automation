	the hope of righteousness—"We
	wait for the (realization of the) hope (which is the fruit) of the
	righteousness (that is, justification which comes) by (literally,
	'from—out of') faith," Romans 5:1;
	Romans 5:4; Romans 5:5;
	Romans 8:24; Romans 8:25,
	"Hope . . . we with patience wait for it."
	This is a farther step than being "justified"; not only are
	we this, but "wait for the hope" which is connected with
	it, and is its full consummation. "Righteousness," in the
	sense of justification, is by the believer once for all already
	attained: but the consummation of it in future perfection above is
	the object of hope to be waited for: "the crown of
	righteousness laid up" (Romans 8:25- :): "the hope laid up for you in heaven" (Colossians 1:5;
	1 Peter 1:3).
