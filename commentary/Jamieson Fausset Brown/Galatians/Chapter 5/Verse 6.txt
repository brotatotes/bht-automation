6. For—confirming the truth
	that it is "by faith" ( :-). 
	in Jesus Christ—Greek,
	"in Christ Jesus." In union with Christ (the
	ANOINTED Saviour), that
	is, Jesus of Nazareth. 
	nor uncircumcision—This
	is levelled against those who, being not legalists, or Judaizers,
	think themselves Christians on this ground alone. 
	faith which worketh by
	love—Greek, "working by love." This
	corresponds to "a new creature" ( :-), as its definition. Thus in Galatians 5:5;
	Galatians 5:6, we have the three,
	"faith," "hope," and "love." The Greek
	expresses, "Which effectually worketh"; which exhibits its
	energy by love (so Galatians 5:6- :). Love is not joined with faith in justifying,
	but is the principle of the works which follow after justification by
	faith. Let not legalists, upholding circumcision, think that the
	essence of the law is set at naught by the doctrine of justification
	by faith only. Nay, "all the law is fulfilled in one word—love,"
	which is the principle on which "faith worketh" (Galatians 5:6- :). Let them, therefore, seek this "faith," which
	will enable them truly to fulfil the law. Again, let not those who
	pride themselves on uncircumcision think that, because the law does
	not justify, they are free to walk after "the flesh" (Galatians 5:6- :). Let them, then, seek that "love" which is
	inseparable from true faith (James 2:8;
	James 2:12-22). Love is
	utterly opposed to the enmities which prevailed among the Galatians
	(Galatians 5:15; Galatians 5:20).
	The Spirit (Galatians 5:5) is a Spirit
	of "faith" and "love" (compare Romans 14:17;
	1 Corinthians 7:19).
