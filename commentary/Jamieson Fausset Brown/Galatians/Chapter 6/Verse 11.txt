11. Rather, "See in how
	large letters I have written." The Greek is
	translated "how great" in  :-, the only other passage where it occurs in the New Testament.
	Owing to his weakness of eyes ( :-) he wrote in large letters. So JEROME.
	All the oldest manuscripts are written in uncial, that is, capital
	letters, the "cursive," or small letters, being of more
	recent date. Paul seems to have had a difficulty in writing, which
	led him to make the uncial letters larger than ordinary writers did.
	The mention of these is as a token by which they would know that he
	wrote the whole Epistle with his own hand; as he did also the
	pastoral Epistle, which this Epistle resembles in style. He usually
	dictated his Epistles to an amanuensis, excepting the concluding
	salutation, which he wrote himself (Romans 16:22;
	1 Corinthians 16:21). This letter, he tells
	the Galatians, he writes with his own hand, no doubt in order that
	they may see what a regard he had for them, in contrast to the
	Judaizing teachers (Galatians 6:12),
	who sought only their own ease. If English Version be
	retained, the words, "how large a letter (literally, 'in how
	large letters')," will not refer to the length of the Epistle
	absolutely, but that it was a large one for him to have
	written with his own hand. NEANDER
	supports English Version, as more appropriate to the
	earnestness of the apostle and the tone of the Epistle: "How
	large" will thus be put for "how many."
