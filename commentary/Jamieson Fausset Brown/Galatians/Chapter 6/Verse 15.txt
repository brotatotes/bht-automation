15. availeth—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "is" (compare  :-). Not only are they of no avail, but they are
	nothing. So far are they from being matter for "glorying,"
	that they are "nothing." But Christ's cross is "all in
	all," as a subject for glorying, in "the new creature"
	(Ephesians 2:10; Ephesians 2:15;
	Ephesians 2:16). 
	new creature— (Ephesians 2:16- :). A transformation by the renewal of the mind (Ephesians 2:16- :).
