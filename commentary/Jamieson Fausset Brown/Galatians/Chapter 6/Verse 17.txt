17. let no man trouble me—by
	opposing my apostolic authority, seeing that it is stamped by a sure
	seal, namely, "I (in contrast to the Judaizing teachers who
	gloried in the flesh) bear (as a high mark of honor from the King of
	kings)." 
	the marks—properly,
	marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners. So Paul's scars of
	wounds received for Christ's sake, indicate to whom he belongs, and
	in whose free and glorious service he is ( :-). The Judaizing teachers gloried in the circumcision
	mark in the flesh of their followers: Paul glories in the
	marks of suffering for Christ on his own body (compare Galatians 6:14;
	Philippians 3:10; Colossians 1:24).
	the Lord—omitted in the
	oldest manuscripts.
