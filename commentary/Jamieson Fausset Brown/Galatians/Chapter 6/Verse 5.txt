5. For (by this way,  :-, of proving himself, not depreciating his neighbor by
	comparison) each man shall bear his own "burden," or
	rather, "load" (namely, of sin and infirmity), the
	Greek being different from that in  :-. This verse does not contradict  :-. There he tells them to bear with others' "burdens"
	of infirmity in sympathy; here, that self-examination will make a man
	to feel he has enough to do with "his own load" of sin,
	without comparing himself boastfully with his neighbor. Compare  :-. Instead of "thinking himself to be something," he
	shall feel the "load" of his own sin: and this will lead
	him to bear sympathetically with his neighbor's burden of infirmity.
	Ã†SOP says a man carries
	two bags over his shoulder, the one with his own sins hanging behind,
	that with his neighbor's sins in front.
