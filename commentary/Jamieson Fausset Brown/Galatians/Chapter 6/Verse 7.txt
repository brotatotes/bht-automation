7. God is not mocked—The Greek
	verb is, literally, to sneer with the nostrils drawn up in contempt.
	God does not suffer Himself to be imposed on by empty words: He will
	judge according to works, which are seeds sown for eternity of either
	joy or woe. Excuses for illiberality in God's cause ( :-) seem valid before men, but are not so before God ( :-). 
	soweth—especially of
	his resources (2 Corinthians 9:6). 
	that—Greek,
	"this"; this and nothing else. 
	reap—at the harvest,
	the end of the world (Matthew 13:39).
