 CHAPTER 1 
	
 :-. THE HIGHEST
	OF ALL REVELATIONS
	IS GIVEN
	US NOW
	IN THE SON OF GOD,
	WHO IS
	GREATER THAN THE ANGELS,
	AND WHO, HAVING
	COMPLETED REDEMPTION,
	SITS ENTHRONED
	AT GOD'S RIGHT
	HAND. 
	The writer, though not inscribing
	his name, was well known to those addressed ( :-). For proofs of Paul being the author, see my Introduction.
	In the Pauline method, the statement of subject and the division are
	put before the discussion; and at the close, the practical follows
	the doctrinal portion. The ardor of Spirit in this Epistle, as in
	First John, bursting forth at once into the subject (without
	prefatory inscription of name and greeting), the more effectively
	strikes the hearers. The date must have been while the temple was yet
	standing, before its destruction, A.D.
	70; some time before the martyrdom of Peter, who mentions this
	Epistle of Paul (2 Peter 3:15;
	2 Peter 3:16); at a time when many of
	the first hearers of the Lord were dead.
