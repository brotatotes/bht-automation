14. ministering spirits—referring
	to Hebrews 1:7, "spirits . . .
	ministers." They are incorporeal spirits, as God is, but
	ministering to Him as inferiors. 
	sent forth—present
	participle: "being sent forth" continually, as their
	regular service in all ages. 
	to minister—Greek,
	"unto (that is, 'for') ministry." 
	for them—Greek,
	"on account of the." Angels are sent forth on
	ministrations to God and Christ, not primarily to men, though
	for the good of "those who are about to inherit
	salvation" (so the Greek): the elect, who believe, or
	shall believe, for whom all things, angels included, work together
	for good (Romans 8:28). Angels'
	ministrations are not properly rendered to men, since the latter have
	no power of commanding them, though their ministrations to God are
	often directed to the good of men. So the superiority of the Son of
	God to angels is shown. They "all," how ever various their
	ranks, "minister"; He is ministered to. They "stand"
	(Luke 1:19) before God, or are
	"sent forth" to execute the divine commands on
	behalf of them whom He pleases to save; He "sits on the
	right hand of the Majesty on high" (Hebrews 1:3;
	Hebrews 1:13). He rules; they serve.
