2. in these last days—In the
	oldest manuscripts the Greek is. "At the last part of
	these days." The Rabbins divided the whole of time into "this
	age," or "world," and "the age to come"
	(Hebrews 2:5; Hebrews 6:5).
	The days of Messiah were the transition period or "last part of
	these days" (in contrast to "in times past"), the
	close of the existing dispensation, and beginning of the final
	dispensation of which Christ's second coming shall be the crowning
	consummation. 
	by his
	Son—Greek, "IN
	(His) Son" (John 14:10).
	The true "Prophet" of God. "His majesty is set forth:
	(1) Absolutely by the very name "Son," and by three
	glorious predicates, "whom He hath appointed," "by
	whom He made the worlds," "who sat down on the right hand
	of the Majesty on high;" thus His course is described from the
	beginning of all things till he reached the goal (Hebrews 1:2;
	Hebrews 1:3). (2) Relatively,
	in comparison with the angels, Hebrews 1:3- :; the confirmation of this follows, and the very name
	"Son" is proved at Hebrews 1:3- :; the "heirship," Hebrews 1:3- :; the "making the worlds," Hebrews 1:3- :; the "sitting at the right hand" of God,
	Hebrews 1:13; Hebrews 1:14."
	His being made heir follows His sonship, and preceded
	His making the worlds (Proverbs 8:22;
	Proverbs 8:23; Ephesians 3:11).
	As the first begotten, He is heir of the universe (Ephesians 3:11- :), which He made instrumentally, Ephesians 3:11- :, where "by the Word of God" answers to "by
	whom"' (the Son of God) here (Ephesians 3:11- :). Christ was "appointed" (in God's eternal counsel)
	to creation as an office; and the universe so created was assigned to
	Him as a kingdom. He is "heir of all things" by right of
	creation, and especially by right of redemption. The promise to
	Abraham that he should be heir of the world had its fulfilment, and
	will have it still more fully, in Christ (Romans 4:13;
	Galatians 3:16; Galatians 4:7).
	worlds—the inferior and
	the superior worlds (Colossians 1:16).
	Literally, "ages" with all things and persons belonging to
	them; the universe, including all space and ages of time, and all
	material and spiritual existences. The Greek implies, He not
	only appointed His Son heir of all things before creation, but He
	also (better than "also He") made by Him the worlds.
