6. And—Greek, "But."
	Not only this proves His superiority, BUT
	a more decisive proof is Psalms 97:7,
	which shows that not only at His resurrection, but also in prospect
	of His being brought into the world (compare Hebrews 9:11;
	Hebrews 10:5) as man, in His
	incarnation, nativity (Hebrews 10:5- :), temptation (Matthew 4:10;
	Matthew 4:11), resurrection (Matthew 4:11- :), and future second advent in glory, angels were designed by
	God to be subject to Him. Compare Matthew 4:11- :, "seen of angels"; God manifesting Messiah as one
	to be gazed at with adoring love by heavenly intelligences (Ephesians 3:10;
	2 Thessalonians 1:9; 2 Thessalonians 1:10;
	1 Peter 3:22). The fullest
	realization of His Lordship shall be at His second coming (Psalms 97:7;
	1 Corinthians 15:24; 1 Corinthians 15:25;
	Philippians 2:9). "Worship Him all
	ye gods" ("gods," that is, exalted beings, as
	angels), refers to God; but it was universally admitted
	among the Hebrews that God would dwell, in a peculiar sense, in
	Messiah (so as to be in the Talmud phrase, "capable of being
	pointed to with the finger"); and so what was said of God was
	true of, and to be fulfilled in, Messiah. KIMCHI
	says that the ninety-third through the hundred first Psalms contain
	in them the mystery of Messiah. God ruled the theocracy in and
	through Him. 
	the world—subject to
	Christ (Hebrews 2:5). As "the
	first-begotten" He has the rights of primogeniture (Hebrews 2:5- :); Colossians 1:15; Colossians 1:16;
	Colossians 1:18). In Colossians 1:18- :, the Septuagint has, "Let all the angels of God
	worship Him," words not now found in the Hebrew. This
	passage of the Septuagint may have been in Paul's mind as to
	the form, but the substance is taken from Colossians 1:18- :. The type David, in the Colossians 1:18- : (quoted in Hebrews 1:5),
	is called "God's first-born, higher than the kings
	of the earth"; so the antitypical first-begotten, the son of
	David, is to be worshipped by all inferior lords, such as
	angels ("gods," Hebrews 1:5- :); for He is "King of kings and Lord of lords" (Hebrews 1:5- :). In the Greek, "again" is transposed; but
	this does not oblige us, as ALFORD
	thinks, to translate, "when He again shall have introduced,"
	c., namely, at Christ's second coming for there is no previous
	mention of a first bringing in; and "again" is often
	used in quotations, not to be joined with the verb, but
	parenthetically ("that I may again quote Scripture").
	English Version is correct (compare Hebrews 1:5- :; Greek, Hebrews 1:5- :).
