7. of—The Greek is
	rather, "In reference TO the angels." 
	spirits—or "winds":
	Who employeth His angels as the winds, His ministers as the
	lightnings; or, He maketh His angelic ministers the directing powers
	of winds and flames, when these latter are required to perform His
	will. "Commissions them to assume the agency or form of flames
	for His purposes" [ALFORD].
	English Version, "maketh His angels spirits,"
	means, He maketh them of a subtle, incorporeal nature, swift as the
	wind. So Psalms 18:10, "a
	cherub . . . the wings of the wind." Psalms 18:10- :, "ministering spirits," favors English
	Version here. As "spirits" implies the wind-like
	velocity and subtle nature of the cherubim, so "flame of
	fire" expresses the burning devotion and intense all-consuming
	zeal of the adoring seraphim (meaning "burning), Psalms 18:10- :. The translation, "maketh winds His messengers, and a
	flame of fire His ministers (!)," is plainly wrong. In
	the Psalms 104:3; Psalms 104:4,
	the subject in each clause comes first, and the attribute predicated
	of it second; so the Greek article here marks "angels"
	and "ministers" as the subjects, and "winds"
	and "flame of fire," predicates, Schemoth Rabba
	says, "God is called God of Zebaoth (the heavenly hosts),
	because He does what He pleases with His angels. When He pleases, He
	makes them to sit (Judges 6:11); at
	other times to stand (Isaiah 6:2);
	at times to resemble women (Isaiah 6:2- :); at other times to resemble men (Isaiah 6:2- :); at times He makes them 'spirits'; at times, fire."
	"Maketh" implies that, however exalted, they are but
	creatures, whereas the Son is the Creator (Isaiah 6:2- :): not begotten from everlasting, nor to be
	worshipped, as the Son (Revelation 14:7;
	Revelation 22:8; Revelation 22:9).
