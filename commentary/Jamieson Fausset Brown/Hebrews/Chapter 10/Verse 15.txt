15. The Greek, has
	"moreover," or "now." 
	is a witness—of the
	truth which I am setting forth. The Father's witness is given  :-. The Son's, Hebrews 10:5.
	Now is added that of the Holy Spirit, called accordingly "the
	Spirit of grace," Hebrews 10:29.
	The testimony of all Three leads to the same conclusion (Hebrews 10:29- :). 
	for after that he had said
	before—The conclusion to the sentence is in Hebrews 10:29- :, "After He had said before, This is the
	covenant that I will make with them (with the house of Israel,
Hebrews 8:10; here extended to the
	spiritual Israel) . . . saith the Lord; I will put (literally,
	'giving,' referring to the giving of the law; not now as then,
	giving into the hands, but giving) My laws into their
	hearts ('mind,' Hebrews 8:10) and
	in their minds ('hearts,' Hebrews 8:10- :); I will inscribe (so the Greek) them (here He
	omits the addition quoted in Hebrews 8:10;
	Hebrews 8:11, I will be to them a
	God . . . and they shall not teach every man his neighbor . . .),
	and (that is, after He had said the foregoing, HE
	THEN ADDS) their sins . . . will I remember no more." The
	great object of the quotation here is to prove that, there being in
	the Gospel covenant, "REMISSION
	of sins" (Hebrews 10:17),
	there is no more need of a sacrifice for sins. The object of the same
	quotation in Hebrews 8:8-13
	is to show that, there being a "NEW
	covenant," the old is antiquated.
