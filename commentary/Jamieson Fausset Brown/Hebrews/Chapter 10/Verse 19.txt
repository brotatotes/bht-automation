19. Here begins the third and
	last division of the Epistle; our duty now while waiting for the
	Lord's second advent. Resumption and expansion of the exhortation
	(Hebrews 4:14-16; compare
	Hebrews 10:22; Hebrews 10:23
	here) wherewith he closed the first part of the Epistle, preparatory
	to his great doctrinal argument, beginning at Hebrews 10:23- :. 
	boldness—"free
	confidence," grounded on the consciousness that our sins have
	been forgiven. 
	to enter—literally, "as
	regards the entering." 
	by—Greek, "in";
	it is in the blood of Jesus that our boldness to enter is
	grounded. Compare Ephesians 3:12, "In
	whom we have boldness and access with confidence." It is His
	having once for all entered as our Forerunner (Ephesians 3:12- :) and High Priest (Ephesians 3:12- :), making atonement for us with His blood, which is
	continually there (Hebrews 12:24)
	before God, that gives us confident access. No priestly caste now
	mediates between the sinner and his Judge. We may come boldly
	with loving confidence, not with slavish fear, directly through
	Christ, the only mediating Priest. The minister is not officially
	nearer God than the layman; nor can the latter serve God at a
	distance or by deputy, as the natural man would like. Each must come
	for himself, and all are accepted when they come by the new and
	living way opened by Christ. Thus all Christians are, in respect to
	access directly to God, virtually high priests (Hebrews 12:24- :). They draw nigh in and through Christ, the only proper High
	Priest (Hebrews 7:25).
