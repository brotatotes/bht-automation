26. Compare on this and
	following verses, Hebrews 6:4-8,
	c. There the warning was that if there be not diligence in
	progressing, a falling off will take place, and apostasy may ensue:
	here it is, that if there be lukewarmness in Christian communion,
	apostasy may ensue. 
	if we sin—Greek
	present participle: if we be found sinning, that is, not
	isolated acts, but a state of sin [ALFORD].
	A violation not only of the law, but of the whole economy of
	the New Testament (Hebrews 10:28
Hebrews 10:29). 
	wilfully—presumptuously,
	Greek "willingly." After receiving "full
	knowledge (so the Greek, compare Hebrews 10:29- :) of the truth," by having been "enlightened,"
	and by having "tasted" a certain measure even of grace of
	"the Holy Ghost" (the Spirit of truth, Hebrews 10:29- :; and "the Spirit of grace," Hebrews 10:29- :): to fall away (as "sin" here means,
	Hebrews 3:12; Hebrews 3:17;
	compare Hebrews 6:6) and apostatize
	(Hebrews 3:12) to Judaism or
	infidelity, is not a sin of ignorance, or error ("out
	of the way," the result) of infirmity, but a deliberate
	sinning against the Spirit (Hebrews 10:29;
	Hebrews 5:2): such sinning,
	where a consciousness of Gospel obligations not only was, but is
	present: a sinning presumptuously and preseveringly against Christ's
	redemption for us, and the Spirit of grace in us. "He
	only who stands high can fall low. A lively reference in the soul to
	what is good is necessary in order to be thoroughly wicked; hence,
	man can be more reprobate than the beasts, and the apostate angels
	than apostate man" [THOLUCK].
	remaineth no more
	sacrifice—For there is but ONE
	Sacrifice that can atone for sin; they, after having fully known that
	sacrifice, deliberately reject it.
