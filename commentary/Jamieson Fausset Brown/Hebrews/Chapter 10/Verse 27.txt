	strangely translates, as the Greek usually means elsewhere,
	"reception." The transition is easy from "giving a
	reception to" something or someone, to "looking for."

	here), Hebrews 10:13, which
	refutes ALFORD. 
	fiery indignation—literally,
	"zeal of fire." Fire is personified: glow or ardor of fire,
	that is, of Him who is "a consuming fire." 
	devour—continually.
