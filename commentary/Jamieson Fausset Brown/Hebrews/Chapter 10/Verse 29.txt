29. sorer—Greek,
	"worse," namely, "punishment" (literally,
	"vengeance") than any mere temporal punishment of the body.
	suppose ye—an appeal to
	the Hebrews' reason and conscience. 
	thought worthy—by God
	at the judgment. 
	trodden under foot the Son of
	God—by "wilful" apostasy. So he treads under foot God
	Himself who "glorified His Son as an high priest"
	(Hebrews 5:5; Hebrews 6:6).
	an unholy thing—literally,
	"common," as opposed to "sanctified." No better
	than the blood of a common man, thus involving the consequence that
	Christ, in claiming to be God, was guilty of blasphemy, and so
	deserved to die! 
	wherewith he was
	sanctified—for Christ died even for him. "Sanctified,"
	in the fullest sense, belongs only to the saved elect. But in some
	sense it belongs also to those who have gone a far way in Christian
	experience, and yet fall away at last. The higher such a one's past
	Christian experiences, the deeper his fall. 
	done despite unto—by
	repelling in fact: as "blasphemy" is despite in
	words (Mark 3:29). "Of
	the Jews who became Christians and relapsed to Judaism, we find from
	the history of Uriel Acosta, that they required a blasphemy against
	Christ. 'They applied to Him epithets used against Molech the
	adulterous branch,' c." [THOLUCK].
	the Spirit of grace—the
	Spirit that confers grace. "He who does not accept the benefit,
	insults Him who confers it. He hath made thee a son: wilt thou become
	a slave? He has come to take up His abode with thee but thou art
	introducing evil into thyself" [CHRYSOSTOM].
	"It is the curse of evil eternally to propagate evil: so, for
	him who profanes the Christ without him, and blasphemes the
	Christ within him, there is subjectively no renewal of a
	change of mind (Hebrews 6:6), and
	objectively no new sacrifice for sins" (Hebrews 6:6- :) [THOLUCK].
