36. patience—Greek,
	"waiting endurance," or "enduring perseverance":
	the kindred Greek verb in the Septuagint,  :-, is translated, "wait for it" (compare  :-). 
	after ye have done the will
	of God—"that whereas ye have done the will of God"
	hitherto (Hebrews 10:32-35),
	ye may now show also patient, persevering endurance, and so
	"receive the promise," that is, the promised reward:
	eternal life and bliss commensurate with our work of faith and love
	(Hebrews 6:10-12). We must
	not only do, but also suffer (Hebrews 6:10-58.6.12- :). God first uses the active talents of His servants;
	then polishes the other side of the stone, making the passive
	graces shine, patience, meekness, c. It may be also
	translated, "That ye may do the will of God, and receive,"
	&c. [ALFORD]:
	"patience" itself is a further and a persevering doing of
	"God's will" otherwise it would be profitless and no real
	grace (Matthew 7:21). We should
	look, not merely for individual bliss now and at death, but for the
	great and general consummation of bliss of all saints, both in body
	and soul.
