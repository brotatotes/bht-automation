	turning-off from denunciatory warnings to charitable hopes of his

	saving of the soulâ€”literally,
	"acquisition (or obtaining) of the soul." The
	kindred Greek verb is applied to Christ's acquiring the
	Church as the purchase of His blood (Romans 8:12- :). If we acquire or obtain our soul's
	salvation, it is through Him who has obtained it for us by His
	bloodshedding. "The unbelieving man loses his soul: for
	not being God's, neither is he his own [compare Matthew 16:26;
	Luke 9:25]: faith saves the soul
	by linking it to God" [DELITZSCH
	in ALFORD].
