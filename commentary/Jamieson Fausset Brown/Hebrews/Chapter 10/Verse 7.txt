7. I come—rather, "I am
	come" (see on Hebrews 10:1).
	"Here we have the creed, as it were, of Jesus: 'I am come
	to fulfil the law,' Matthew 5:17; to
	preach, Mark 1:38; to call
	sinners to repentance, Luke 5:32;
	to send a sword and to set men at variance, Matthew 10:34;
	Matthew 10:35; I came down from
	heaven to do the will of Him that sent me, John 6:38;
	John 6:39 (so here, Psalms 40:7;
	Psalms 40:8); I am sent to the lost
	sheep of the house of Israel, Psalms 40:8- :; I am come into this world for judgment, Psalms 40:8- :; I am come that they might have life, and might have it more
	abundantly, John 10:10; to save
	what had been lost, Matthew 18:11;
	to seek and to save that which was lost, Matthew 18:11- :; compare 1 Timothy 1:15; to
	save men's lives, Luke 9:56; to
	send fire on the earth, Luke 12:49;
	to minister, Matthew 20:28; as "the
	Light," John 12:46; to
	bear witness unto the truth, John 12:46- :. See, reader, that thy Saviour obtain what He aimed at in
	thy case. Moreover, do thou for thy part say, why thou art come here?
	Dost thou, then, also, do the will of God? From what time? and in
	what way?" [BENGEL].
	When the two goats on the day of atonement were presented before the
	Lord, that goat on which the lot of the Lord should fall was to be
	offered as a sin offering; and that lot was lifted up on high in the
	hand of the high priest, and then laid upon the head of the goat
	which was to die; so the hand of God determined all
	that was done to Christ. Besides the covenant of God with man through
	Christ's blood, there was another covenant made by the Father with
	the Son from eternity. The condition was, "If He shall make His
	soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed," &c. (John 12:46- :). The Son accepted the condition, "Lo, I come to do
	Thy will, O God" [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. Oblation,
	intercession, and benediction, are His three priestly offices. 
	in the volume,
	&c.—literally, "the roll": the parchment manuscript
	being wrapped around a cylinder headed with knobs. Here, the
	Scripture "volume" meant is the fortieth Psalm. "By
	this very passage 'written of Me,' I undertake to do Thy will
	[namely, that I should die for the sins of the world, in order that
	all who believe may be saved, not by animal sacrifices, John 12:46- :, but by My death]." This is the written contract of
	Messiah (compare Nehemiah 9:38),
	whereby He engaged to be our surety. So complete is the inspiration
	of all that is written, so great the authority of the Psalms, that
	what David says is really what Christ then and there said.
