17. offered up—literally,
	"hath offered up," as if the work and its praise were yet
	enduring [ALFORD]. As far
	as His intention was concerned, he did sacrifice Isaac; and in actual
	fact "he offered him," as far as the presentation of him on
	the altar as an offering to God is concerned. 
	tried—Greek,
	"tempted," as in Genesis 22:1.
	Put to the proof of his faith. Not that God "tempts"
	to sin, but God "tempts" in the sense of proving
	or trying (Genesis 22:1- :). 
	and—and so. 
	he that had received—rather
	as Greek, "accepted," that is, welcomed and
	embraced by faith, not merely "had the promises," as in Genesis 22:1- :. This added to the difficulty in the way of his faith, that
	it was in Isaac's posterity the promises were to be fulfilled; how
	then could they be fulfilled if Isaac were sacrificed? 
	offered up—rather as
	Greek, "was offering up"; he was in the act of
	offering. 
	his only-begotten son—Compare
	Genesis 22:2, "Take now thy son,
	thine only son." EUSEBIUS
	[The Preparation of the Gospel, 1.10, and 4.16], has preserved
	a fragment of a Greek translation of Sanchoniatho, which
	mentions a mystical sacrifice of the Phoelignicians, wherein a prince
	in royal robes was the offerer, and his only son was to be the
	victim: this evidently was a tradition derived from Abraham's
	offering, and handed down through Esau or Edom, Isaac's son. Isaac
	was Abraham's "only-begotten son" in respect of Sarah and
	the promises: he sent away his other sons, by other wives (Genesis 22:2- :). Abraham is a type of the Father not sparing His
	only-begotten Son to fulfil the divine purpose of love. God nowhere
	in the Mosaic law allowed human sacrifices, though He claimed the
	first-born of Israel as His.
