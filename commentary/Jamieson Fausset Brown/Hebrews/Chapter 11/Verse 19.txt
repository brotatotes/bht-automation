19. Faith answered the
	objections which reason brought against God's command to Abraham to
	offer Isaac, by suggesting that what God had promised He both could
	and would perform, however impossible the performance might seem

	able to raise him
—rather, in general, "able to raise from the dead."
	Compare Romans 4:17, "God who
	quickeneth the dead." The quickening of Sarah's dead womb
	suggested the thought of God's power to raise even the dead, though
	no instance of it had as yet occurred.

	in a figure—Greek,
	"in a parable." ALFORD
	explains, "Received him back, risen from that death which he had
	undergone in, under, the figure of the ram." I prefer
	with BISHOP PEARSON,
	ESTIUS, and GREGORY
	OF NYSSA,
	understanding the figure to be the representation which the
	whole scene gave to Abraham of Christ in His death (typified by
	Isaac's offering in intention, and the ram's actual substitution
	answering to Christ's vicarious death), and in His resurrection
	(typified by Abraham's receiving him back alive from the jaws of
	death, compare 2 Corinthians 1:9; 2 Corinthians 1:10);
	just as on the day of atonement the slain goat and the scapegoat
	together formed one joint rite representing Christ's death and
	resurrection. It was then that Abraham saw Christ's day (2 Corinthians 1:10- :): accounting God was able to raise even from the dead: from
	which state of the dead he received him back as a type of the
	resurrection in Christ.
