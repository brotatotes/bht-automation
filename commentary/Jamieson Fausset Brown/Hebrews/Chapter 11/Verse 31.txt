31. Rahab showed her "faith"
	in her confession, Joshua 2:9;
	Joshua 2:11, "I know that
	Jehovah hath given you the land; Jehovah your God, is God in heaven
	above, and in earth beneath." 
	the harlot—Her former
	life adds to the marvel of her repentance, faith, and preservation
	(Matthew 21:31; Matthew 21:32).
	believed not—Greek,
	"were disobedient," namely, to the will of God manifested
	by the miracles wrought in behalf of Israel (Matthew 21:32- :). 
	received—in her house
	(Joshua 2:1; Joshua 2:4;
	Joshua 2:6). 
	with peace—peaceably;
	so that they had nothing to fear in her house. Thus Paul, quoting the
	same examples (Hebrews 11:17; Hebrews 11:31)
	for the power of faith, as James (James 2:21;
	James 2:25; see on James 2:25- :; James 2:25- :) does for
	justification by works evidentially, shows that in maintaining
	justification by faith alone, he means not a dead faith, but "faith
	which worketh by love" (James 2:25- :).
