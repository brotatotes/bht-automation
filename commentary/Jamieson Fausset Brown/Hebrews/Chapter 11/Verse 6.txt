6. without—Greek,
	"apart from faith": if one be destitute of faith
	(compare Romans 14:23). 
	to please—Translate, as
	ALFORD does, the Greek
	aorist, "It is impossible to please God at all" (Romans 14:23- :). Natural amiabilities and "works done before the grace
	of Christ are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of
	faith in Jesus Christ; yea, rather, for that they are not done as God
	hath willed them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature of
	sin" [Article XIII, Book of Common Prayer]. Works not
	rooted in God are splendid sins [AUGUSTINE].
	he that cometh to God—as
	a worshipper (Hebrews 7:19). 
	must believe—once
	for all: Greek aorist tense. 
	that God is—is the true
	self-existing Jehovah (as contrasted with all so-called gods, not
	gods, Galatians 4:8), the source of all
	being, though he sees Him not (Galatians 4:8- :) as being "invisible" (Galatians 4:8- :). So Enoch; this passage implies that he had not been
	favored with visible appearances of God, yet he believed
	in God's being, and in God's moral government, as the
	Rewarder of His diligent worshippers, in opposition to antediluvian
	skepticism. Also Moses was not so favored before he left Egypt the
	first time (Hebrews 11:27); still
	he believed. 
	and . . . is—a
	different Greek verb from the former "is."
	Translate, "is eventually"; proves to be; literally,
	"becomes." 
	rewarder—renderer of
	reward [ALFORD]. So God
	proved to be to Enoch. The reward is God Himself diligently
	"sought" and "walked with" in partial communion
	here, and to be fully enjoyed hereafter. Compare Hebrews 11:27- :, "I am thy exceeding great reward." 
	of them—and them only. 
	diligently seek—Greek,
	"seek out" God. Compare "seek early," Hebrews 11:27- :. Not only "ask" and "seek," but "knock,"
	Matthew 7:7; compare Hebrews 11:12;
	Luke 13:24, "Strive" as
	in an agony of contest.
