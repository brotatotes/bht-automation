22, 23. to an innumerable company of
	angels, to the general assembly and churchâ€”The city of
	God having been mentioned, the mention of its citizens follows.
	Believers being like the angels (Job 1:6;
	Job 38:7), "sons of God,"
	are so their "equals" (Job 38:7- :); and being reconciled through Christ, are adopted into
	God's great and blessed family. For the full completion of this we
	pray (Matthew 6:10). English
	Version arrangement is opposed: (1) by "and" always
	beginning each new member of the whole sentence; (2) "general
	assembly and Church," form a kind of tautology; (3) "general
	assembly," or rather, "festal full assembly,"
	"the jubilant full company" (such as were the Olympic
	games, celebrated with joyous singing, dancing, c.), applies better
	to the angels above, ever hymning God's praises, than to the
	Church, of which a considerable part is now militant on earth.
	Translate therefore, "to myriads (ten thousands, compare Deuteronomy 33:2
Psalms 68:17; Daniel 7:10;
	Judges 1:14; namely), the full festal
	assembly of angels, and the Church of the first-born." Angels
	and saints together constitute the ten thousands. Compare "all
	angels, all nations" Matthew 25:31;
	Matthew 25:32. Messiah is
	pre-eminently "the First-born," or "First-begotten"
	(Hebrews 1:6), and all believers
	become so by adoption. Compare the type, Numbers 3:12;
	Numbers 3:45; Numbers 3:50;
	1 Peter 1:18. As the kingly and
	priestly succession was in the first-born, and as Israel was God's
	"first-born" (Exodus 4:22;
	compare Exodus 13:2), and a "kingdom
	of priests" to God (Exodus 19:6),
	so believers (Revelation 1:6).
