25. refuse not—through
	unbelief. 
	him that speaketh—God
	in Christ. As the blood of sprinkling is represented as
	speaking to God for us,  :-; so here God is represented as speaking to us (Hebrews 1:1;
	Hebrews 1:2). His word now is the
	prelude of the last "shaking" of all things (Hebrews 1:2- :). The same word which is heard in the Gospel from
	heaven, will shake heaven and earth (Hebrews 1:2- :). 
	who refused him—Greek,
	"refusing as they did." Their seemingly submissive entreaty
	that the word should not be spoken to them by God any more (Hebrews 1:2- :), covered over refractory hearts, as their subsequent deeds
	showed (Hebrews 3:16). 
	that spake—revealing
	with oracular warnings His divine will: so the Greek.
if we turn away—Greek,
	"we who turn away." The word implies greater refractoriness
	than "refused," or "declined." 
	him that speaketh from
	heaven—God, by His Son in the Gospel, speaking from His
	heavenly throne. Hence, in Christ's preaching frequent mention is
	made of "the kingdom of the heavens" (Greek,
Matthew 3:2). In the giving of the
	law God spake on earth (namely, Mount Sinai) by angels (Matthew 3:2- :; compare Hebrews 1:2). In Hebrews 1:2- :, when God says, "I talked with you from heaven,"
	this passage in Hebrews shows that not the highest heavens, but the
	visible heavens, the clouds and darkness, are meant, out of which God
	by angels proclaimed the law on Sinai.
