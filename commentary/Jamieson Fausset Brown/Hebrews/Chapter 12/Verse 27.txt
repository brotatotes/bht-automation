27. this word,
	Yet once more—So Paul, by the Spirit, sanctions the Septuagint
	rendering of Haggai 2:6, giving an
	additional feature to the prophecy in the Hebrew, as rendered
	in English Version, not merely that it shall be in a little
	while, but that it is to be "once more" as the
	final act. The stress of his argument is on the "ONCE."
	Once for all; once and for ever. "In saying 'once more,'
	the Spirit implies that something has already passed, and something
	else shall be which is to remain, and is no more to be changed to
	something else; for the once is exclusive, that is, not
	many times" [ESTIUS].
	those things that are
	shaken—the heaven and the earth. As the shaking is to be total,
	so shall the removal be, making way for the better things that are
	unremovable. Compare the Jewish economy (the type of the whole
	present order of things) giving way to the new and abiding covenant:
	the forerunner of the everlasting state of bliss. 
	as of things . . .
	made—namely, of this present visible creation: compare
	2 Corinthians 5:1; Hebrews 9:11,
	"made with hands . . . of this creation," that is, things
	so made at creation that they would not remain of themselves,
	but be removed. The new abiding heaven and earth are also made
	by God, but they are of a higher nature than the material creation,
	being made to partake of the divine nature of Him who is not made:
	so in this relation, as one with the uncreated God, they are regarded
	as not of the same class as the things made. The things made
	in the former sense do not remain; the things of the new
	heaven and earth, like the uncreated God, "shall REMAIN
	before God" (Isaiah 66:22).
	The Spirit, the seed of the new and heavenly being, not only of the
	believer's soul, but also of the future body, is an uncreated
	and immortal principle.
