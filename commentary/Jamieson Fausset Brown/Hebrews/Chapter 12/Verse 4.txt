4. not yet resisted unto blood—image
	from pugilism, as he previously had the image of a race,
	both being taken from the great national Greek games. Ye have
	suffered the loss of goods, and been a gazing-stock by
	reproaches and afflictions; ye have not shed your blood (see on
	Hebrews 12:1). "The athlete
	who hath seen his own blood, and who, though cast down by his
	opponent, does not let his spirits be cast down, who as often as he
	hath fallen hath risen the more determined, goes down to the
	encounter with great hope" [SENECA].
	against sin—Sin
	is personified as an adversary; sin, whether within you, leading you
	to spare your blood, or in our adversaries, leading them to
	shed it, if they cannot through your faithfulness even unto
	blood, induce you to apostatize.
