5. forgotten—"utterly,"
	so the Greek. Compare  :-, in which he implies how utterly some of them had
	forgotten God's word. His exhortation ought to have more
	effect on you than the cheers and exhortations of the spectators have
	on the competitors striving in the games. 
	which—Greek,
	"the which," of which the following is a specimen [ALFORD].
	speaketh unto you—as in
	a dialogue or discourse, so the Greek, implying
	God's loving condescension (compare  :-). 
	despise not—literally,
	"Do not hold of little account." Betraying a
	contumacious spirit of unbelief ( :-), as "faint" implies a broken-down, weak, and
	desponding spirit. "Chastening" is to be borne with
	"subjection" (Hebrews 12:9);
	"rebuke" (more severe than chastening) is to be
	borne with endurance (Hebrews 12:9- :). "Some in adversity kick against God's will, others
	despond; neither is to be done by the Christian, who is peculiarly
	the child of God. To him such adverse things occur only by the decree
	of God, and that designed in kindness, namely, to remove the
	defilements adhering to the believer, and to exercise his patience"
