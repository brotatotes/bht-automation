15. As the "altar" was
	mentioned in Hebrews 13:10, so the
	"sacrifices" here (compare Hebrews 13:10- :, namely, praise and doing good, Hebrews 13:10- :). Compare Psalms 119:108;

	By him—as the Mediator
	of our prayers and praises (John 14:13;

	Psalms 69:30; Psalms 69:31;
	Psalms 107:22; Psalms 116:17).

	"confessing." BENGEL
	remarks that the Hebrew, "todah," is
	beautifully emphatic. It literally means "acknowledgment"

	exceed the truth; but in praising God we have only to go on
	confessing what He really is to us. Hence it is impossible to
	exceed the truth, and here is genuine praise.
