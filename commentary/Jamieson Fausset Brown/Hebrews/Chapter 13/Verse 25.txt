25. Paul's characteristic
	salutation in every one of his other thirteen Epistles, as he says
	himself, 1 Corinthians 16:21; 1 Corinthians 16:23;
	Colossians 4:18; 2 Thessalonians 3:17.
	It is found in no Epistle written by any other apostle in Paul's
	lifetime. It is used in Revelation 22:21,
	written subsequently, and in CLEMENT
	OF ROME. Being
	known to be his badge, it is not used by others in his lifetime. The
	Greek here is, "The grace (namely, of our Lord
	Jesus Christ) be with you all."
