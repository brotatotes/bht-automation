3. Remember—in prayers and
	acts of kindness. 
	bound with them—by
	virtue of the unity of the members in the body under one Head, Christ
	(1 Corinthians 12:26). 
	suffer adversity—Greek,
	"are in evil state." 
	being yourselves also in the
	body—and so liable to the adversities incident to the natural
	body, which ought to dispose you the more to sympathize with them,
	not knowing how soon your own turn of suffering may come. "One
	experiences adversity almost his whole life, as Jacob; another in
	youth, as Joseph; another in manhood, as Job; another in old age"
	[BENGEL].
