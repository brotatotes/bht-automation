8. This verse is not, as some
	read it, in apposition with "the end of their conversation"
	(Hebrews 13:7), but forms the
	transition. "Jesus Christ, yesterday and to-day (is) the same,
	and (shall be the same) unto the ages (that is, unto all ages)."
	The Jesus Christ (the full name being given, to mark with
	affectionate solemnity both His person and His office)
	who supported your spiritual rulers through life even unto
	their end "yesterday" (in times past), being at once
	"the Author and the Finisher of their faith" (Hebrews 13:7- :), remains still the same Jesus Christ "to-day,"
	ready to help you also, if like them you walk by "faith" in
	Him. Compare "this same Jesus," Hebrews 13:7- :. He who yesterday (proverbial for the past time)
	suffered and died, is to-day in glory (Hebrews 13:7- :). "As night comes between yesterday and to-day, and yet
	night itself is swallowed up by yesterday and to-day,
	so the "suffering" did not so interrupt the glory of Jesus
	Christ which was of yesterday, and that which is to-day, as not to
	continue to be the same. He is the same yesterday, before He
	came into the world, and to-day, in heaven. Yesterday
	in the time of our predecessors, and to-day in our age"
	[BENGEL]. So the doctrine
	is the same, not variable: this verse thus forms the
	transition between Hebrews 13:7;
	Hebrews 13:9. He is always "the
	same" (Hebrews 1:12). The same
	in the Old and in the New Testament.
