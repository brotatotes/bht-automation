	For in that—that is,
	"For in that" God saith in the eighth Psalm, "He
	put the all things (so the Greek, the all things just
	mentioned) in subjection under him (man), He left nothing . . . As no
	limitation occurs in the sacred writing, the "all things"
	must include heavenly, as well as earthly things (compare 1 Corinthians 3:21;
	1 Corinthians 3:22). 
	But now—As things now
	are, we see not yet the all things put under man.
