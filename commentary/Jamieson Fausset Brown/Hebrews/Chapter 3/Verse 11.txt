11. So—literally, "as."
	I sware—BENGEL
	remarks the oath of God preceded the forty years. 
	not—literally, "If
	they shall enter . . . (God do so to me and more also),"  :-. The Greek is the same,  :-. 
	my rest—Canaan,
	primarily, their rest after wandering in the wilderness: still, even
	when in it, they never fully enjoyed rest; whence it followed
	that the threat extended farther than the exclusion of the
	unbelieving from the literal land of rest, and that the rest promised
	to the believing in its full blessedness was, and is, yet future:
	Psalms 25:13; Psalms 37:9;
	Psalms 37:11; Psalms 37:22;
	Psalms 37:29, and Christ's own
	beatitude (Matthew 5:5) all accord
	with this, Hebrews 3:9.
