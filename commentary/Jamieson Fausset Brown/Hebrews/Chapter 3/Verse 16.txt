	The "For" implies, Ye need to take heed against unbelief:
	for, was it not because of unbelief that all our fathers were
	excluded (Ezekiel 2:3)? "Some,"
	and "not all," would be a faint way of putting his
	argument, when his object is to show the universality of the
	evil. Not merely some, but all the Israelites, for the
	solitary exceptions, Joshua and Caleb, are hardly to be taken into
	account in so general a statement. So Hebrews 3:17;
	Hebrews 3:18, are interrogative: (1)
	the beginning of the provocation, soon after the departure from
	Egypt, is marked in Hebrews 3:16;
	(2) the forty years of it in the wilderness, Hebrews 3:16- :; (3) the denial of entrance into the land of rest, Hebrews 3:16- :. Compare Note, see on Hebrews 3:16- :, "with the majority of them God was displeased."
