9. When—rather, "Where,"
	namely, in the wilderness. 
	your fathers—The
	authority of the ancients is not conclusive [BENGEL].
	tempted me, proved me—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "tempted (Me) in the way of testing,"
	that is, putting (Me) to the proof whether I was able and
	willing to relieve them, not believing that I am so. 
	saw my works forty years—They
	saw, without being led thereby to repentance, My works of power
	partly in affording miraculous help, partly in executing vengeance,
	forty years. The "forty years" joined in the Hebrew
	and Septuagint, and below,  :-, with "I was grieved," is here joined with "they
	saw." Both are true; for, during the same forty years that they
	were tempting God by unbelief, notwithstanding their seeing God's
	miraculous works, God was being grieved. The lesson intended to be
	hinted to the Hebrew Christians is, their "to-day" is to
	last only between the first preaching of the Gospel and Jerusalem's
	impending overthrow, namely, FORTY
	YEARS; exactly the number of years of Israel's sojourn in the
	wilderness, until the full measure of their guilt having been filled
	up all the rebels were overthrown.
