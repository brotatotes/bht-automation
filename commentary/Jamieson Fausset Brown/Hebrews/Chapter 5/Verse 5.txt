5. glorified not himself—did
	not assume the glory of the priestly office of Himself without the
	call of God (John 8:54). 
	but he that said—that
	is, the Father glorified Him or appointed Him to the priesthood. This
	appointment was involved in, and was the result of, the Sonship
	of Christ, which qualified Him for it. None but the divine Son could
	have fulfilled such an office (John 8:54- :). The connection of Sonship and priesthood
	is typified in the Hebrew title for priests being given
	to David's sons (2 Samuel 8:18).
	Christ did not constitute Himself the Son of God, but was from
	everlasting the only-begotten of the Father. On His Sonship
	depended His glorification, and His being called of God (2 Samuel 8:18- :), as Priest.
