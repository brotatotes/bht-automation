6. He is here called simply
	"Priest"; in Hebrews 5:5,
	"High Priest." He is a Priest absolutely, because He
	stands alone in that character without an equal. He is "High
	Priest" in respect of the Aaronic type, and also in respect to
	us, whom He has made priests by throwing open to us access to
	God [BENGEL]. "The
	order of Melchisedec" is explained in Hebrews 5:5- :, "the similitude of Melchisedec." The
	priesthood is similarly combined with His kingly office in Hebrews 5:5- :. Melchisedec was at once man, priest, and king. Paul's
	selecting as the type of Christ one not of the stock of Abraham, on
	which the Jews prided themselves, is an intimation of Messianic
	universalism.
