4. We must "go on toward

	enlightenment, it will be impossible to renew us again to

	for all illuminated by the word of God taught in connection with
	"baptism" (to which, in  :-, as once for all done," once enlightened" here
	answers); compare Ephesians 5:26.
	This passage probably originated the application of the term
	"illumination" to baptism in subsequent times.
	Illumination, however, was not supposed to be the inseparable
	accompaniment of baptism: thus CHRYSOSTOM
	says, "Heretics have baptism, not illumination:
	they are baptized in body, but not enlightened in soul: as Simon
	Magus was baptized, but not illuminated." That "enlightened"
	here means knowledge of the word of truth, appears from
	comparing the same Greek word "illuminated," Hebrews 10:32;
	Hebrews 10:26, where "knowledge
	of the truth" answers to it.

	peace in the remission of sins; and as the Bestower of the gift of
	the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:19;
	Acts 8:20), 
	made partakers of the Holy
	Ghost—specified as distinct from, though so inseparably
	connected with, "enlightened," and "tasted of the
	heavenly gift," Christ, as answering to "laying on of
	hands" after baptism, which was then generally accompanied with
	the impartation of the Holy Ghost in miraculous gifts.
