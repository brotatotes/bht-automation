9. beloved—appositely here
	introduced; LOVE to you
	prompts me in the strong warnings I have just given, not that I
	entertain unfavorable thoughts of you; nay, I anticipate better
	things of you; Greek "the things which are
	better"; that ye are not thorn-bearing, or nigh unto
	cursing, and doomed unto burning, but heirs of salvation
	in accordance with God's faithfulness ( :-). 
	we are persuaded—on
	good grounds; the result of proof. Compare  :-, "I myself am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye
	are full of goodness." A confirmation of the Pauline
	authorship of this Epistle. 
	things that accompany—Greek,
	"things that hold by," that is, are close unto "salvation."
	Things that are linked unto salvation (compare  :-). In opposition to "nigh unto cursing." 
	though—Greek,
	"if even we thus speak." "For it is better to make you
	afraid with words, that ye may not suffer in fact."
