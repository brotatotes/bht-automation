10. in the loins of his fatherâ€”that
	is, forefather Abraham. Christ did not, in this sense,
	pay tithes in Abraham, for He never was in the loins of an earthly
	father [ALFORD]. Though,
	in respect to His mother, He was "of the fruit of (David's, and
	so of) Abraham's loins," yet, being supernaturally, without
	human father, conceived, as He is above the natural law of birth, so
	is he above the law of tithes. Only those born in the natural way,
	and so in sin, being under the curse, needed to pay tithe to the
	priest, that he might make propitiation for their sin. Not so Christ,
	who derived only His flesh, not also the taint of the flesh, from
	Abraham. BENGEL remarks,
	The blessings which Abraham had before meeting Melchisedec
	were the general promises, and the special one of a natural
	seed, and so of Levi; but the promises under which Christ
	was comprehended, and the faith for which Abraham was so commended,
	followed after Abraham's meeting Melchisedec, and being
	blessed by him: to which fact.  :-, "After these things," calls our attention.
	This explains why Christ, the supernatural seed, is not included as
	paying tithes through Abraham to Melchisedec.
