16. carnal . . . endlessâ€”mutually
	contrasted. As "form" and "power" are opposed,
	2 Timothy 3:5; so here "the law"
	and "power," compare 2 Timothy 3:5- :, "The law was weak through the flesh"; and
	Hebrews 7:18, "weakness."
	"The law" is here not the law in general, but the statute
	as to the priesthood. "Carnal," as being only outward
	and temporary, is contrasted with "endless," or, as
	Greek, "indissoluble." Commandments is contrasted
	with "life." The law can give a commandment,
	but it cannot give life (Hebrews 7:18- :). But our High Priest's inherent "power," now in
	heaven, has in Him "life for ever"; Hebrews 7:18- :, "through the eternal Spirit"; Hebrews 7:18- :, "able . . . ever liveth" (Hebrews 7:18- :). It is in the power of His resurrection life, not of His
	earthly life, that Christ officiates as a Priest.
