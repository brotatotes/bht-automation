19. For, c.—justifying his
	calling the law weak and unprofitable ( :-). The law could not bring men to: true justification or
	sanctification before God, which is the "perfection" that
	we all need in order to be accepted of Him, and which we have in
	Christ. 
	nothing—not merely "no
	one," but "nothing." The law brought nothing to its
	perfected end everything in it was introductory to its antitype in
	the Christian economy, which realizes the perfection contemplated;
	compare "unprofitableness,"  :-.

	Hebrews 7:18, thus, "There
	takes place (by virtue of Hebrews 7:18- :) a repealing of the commandment (on the one hand), but (on
	the other) a bringing in afterwards (the Greek
	expresses that there is a bringing in of something over and above
	the law; a superinducing, or accession of something new,
	namely, something better than the good things which the pre-existing
	law promised [WAHL]) of a
	better hope," not one weak and unprofitable, but, as elsewhere
	the Christian dispensation is called, "everlasting,"
	"true," "the second," "more excellent,"
	"different," "living," "new," "to
	come," "perfect." Compare Hebrews 7:18- :, bringing us near to God, now in spirit, hereafter
	both in spirit and in body. 
	we draw nigh unto God—the
	sure token of "perfection." Weakness is the opposite
	of this filial confidence of access. The access through the legal
	sacrifices was only symbolical and through the medium of a priest;
	that through Christ is immediate, perfect, and spiritual.
