25. Wherefore—Greek,
	"Whence"; inasmuch as "He remaineth for ever."
	also—as a natural
	consequence flowing from the last, at the same time a new and
	higher thing [ALFORD].
	save—His very name
	JESUS ( :-) meaning Saviour.
to the uttermost—altogether,
	perfectly, so that nothing should be wanting afterwards for ever
	[TITTMANN]. It means "in
	any wise," "utterly," in  :-. 
	come unto God—by faith.
	by him—through Him
	as their mediating Priest, instead of through the Levitical priests. 
	seeing he ever
	liveth—resuming "He continueth ever,"  :-; therefore "He is able to the uttermost"; He is
	not, like the Levitical priest, prevented by death, for "He
	ever liveth" (Hebrews 7:23). 
	to make intercession—There
	was but the one offering on earth once for all. But the
	intercession for us in the heavens (Hebrews 7:23- :) is ever continuing, whence the result follows, that we can
	never be separated from the love of God in Christ. He intercedes
	only for those who come unto God through Him, not for the unbelieving
	world (John 17:9). As samples of
	His intercession, compare the prophetical descriptions in the
	Old Testament. "By an humble omnipotency (for it was by His
	humiliation that He obtained all power), or omnipotent
	humility, appearing in the presence, and presenting His postulations
	at the throne of God" [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. He was not only
	the offering, but the priest who offered it. Therefore, He has become
	not only a sacrifice, but an intercessor; His intercession being
	founded on His voluntary offering of Himself without spot to God. We
	are not only then in virtue of His sacrifice forgiven, but in virtue
	of the intercession admitted to favor and grace [ARCHBISHOP
	MAGEE].
