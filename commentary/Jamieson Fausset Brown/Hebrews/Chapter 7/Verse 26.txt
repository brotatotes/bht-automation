26. such—as is above
	described. The oldest manuscripts read, "also." "For
	to US (as sinners;
	emphatical) there was also becoming (besides the other excellencies

	holy—"pious"
	(a distinct Greek word from that for holy, which latter

	"separated from sinners," namely, in His heavenly
	state as our High Priest above, after He had been parted from the
	earth, as the Levitical high priest was separated from the people
	in the sanctuary (whence he was not to go out),  :-. Though justifying through faith the ungodly, He hath no
	contact with them as such. He is lifted above our sinful
	community, being "made higher than the heavens," at the
	same time that He makes believers as such (not as sinners),
	"to sit together (with Him) in heavenly places" ( :-). Just as Moses on the mount was separated from and
	above the people, and alone with God. This proves Jesus is GOD.
	"Though innumerable lies have been forged against the venerable
	Jesus, none dared to charge Him with any intemperance" [ORIGEN].
	made—Jesus was higher
	before (John 17:5), and as the
	God-MAN was made
	so by the Father after His humiliation (compare John 17:5- :). 
	higher than the heavens—for
