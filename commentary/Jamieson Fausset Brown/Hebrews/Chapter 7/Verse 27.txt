27. daily—"day by day."
	The priests daily offered sacrifices (Hebrews 9:6;
	Hebrews 10:11; Exodus 29:38-42).
	The high priests took part in these daily-offered sacrifices only on
	festival days; but as they represented the whole priesthood, the
	daily offerings are here attributed to them; their exclusive function
	was to offer the atonement "once every year" (Exodus 29:38-2.29.42- :), and "year by year continually" (Exodus 29:38-2.29.42- :). The "daily" strictly belongs to Christ,
	not to the high priests, "who needeth not daily, as those high
	priests (year by year, and their subordinate priests daily),
	to offer," c. 
	offer up—The Greek
	term is peculiarly used of sacrifices for sin. The high
	priest's double offering on the day of atonement, the bullock for
	himself, and the goat for the people's sins, had its counterpart in
	the TWO lambs offered
	daily by the ordinary priests. 
	this he did—not "died
	first for His own sins and then the people's," but for the
	people's only. The negation is twofold: He needeth not to offer
	(1) daily nor (2) to offer for His own sins also; for He offered
	Himself a spotless sacrifice (Hebrews 7:26;
	Hebrews 4:15). The sinless alone
	could offer for the sinful. 
	once—rather as Greek,
	"once for all." The sufficiency of the one sacrifice
	to atone for all sins for ever, resulted from its
	absolute spotlessness.
