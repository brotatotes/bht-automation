20.  :-, "Behold the blood of the covenant, which the
	Lord has made with you concerning all these words." The
	change is here made to accord with Christ's inauguration of the new
	testament, or covenant, as recorded in  :-, "This cup (is) the new Testament in My blood, which
	is shed for you": the only Gospel in which the "is"
	has to be supplied. Luke was Paul's companion, which accounts
	for the correspondence, as here too "is" has to be
	supplied. 
	testament—(See on  :-). The Greek "diathece" means
	both "testament" and "covenant": the term
	"covenant" better suits the old dispensation, though the
	idea testament is included, for the old was one in its typical
	relation to the new dispensation, to which the term "testament"
	is better suited. Christ has sealed the testament with His blood,
	of which the Lord's Supper is the sacramental sign. The testator was
	represented by the animals slain in the old dispensation. In both
	dispensations the inheritance was bequeathed: in the new by One who
	has come in person and died; in the old by the same one, only
	typically and ceremonially present. See ALFORD'S
	excellent Note.

	you—commissioned me to ratify in relation to you.
	In the old dispensation the condition to be fulfilled on the people's
	part is implied in the words,  :-, "(Lord made with you) concerning all these words."
	But here Paul omits this clause, as he includes the fulfilment of
	this condition of obedience to "all these words" in the new
	covenant, as part of God's promise, in Hebrews 8:8;
	Hebrews 8:10; Hebrews 8:12,
	whereby Christ fulfils all for our justification, and will enable us
	by putting His Spirit in us to fulfil all in our now progressive, and
	finally complete, sanctification.
