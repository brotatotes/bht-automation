21. Greek, "And,
	moreover, in like manner." The sprinkling of the
	tabernacle with blood is added by inspiration here to the account
	in Exodus 30:25-30; Exodus 40:9;
	Exodus 40:10, which mentions only
	Moses' anointing the tabernacle and its vessels. In Leviticus 8:10;
	Leviticus 8:15; Leviticus 8:30,
	the sprinkling of blood upon Aaron and his garments, and upon his
	sons, and upon the altar, is mentioned as well as the anointing, so
	that we might naturally infer, as JOSEPHUS
	has distinctly stated, that the tabernacle and its vessels were
	sprinkled with blood as well as being anointed: Leviticus 16:16;
	Leviticus 16:20; Leviticus 16:33,
	virtually sanctions this inference. The tabernacle and its contents
	needed purification (2 Chronicles 29:21).
