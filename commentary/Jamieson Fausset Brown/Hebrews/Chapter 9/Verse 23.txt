	to man. The purification removes this element of disorder and
	changes God's wrath against man in heaven (designed to be the place
	of God's revealing His grace to men and angels) into a smile of
	reconciliation. Compare "peace in heaven" ( :-). "The uncreated heaven of God, though in itself
	untroubled light, yet needed a purification in so far as the light of

	Christ's atonement had the effect also of casting Satan out of heaven
	(Luke 10:18; John 12:31,
	compare Hebrews 2:14). Christ's
	body, the true tabernacle (see on Hebrews 2:14- :; Hebrews 9:11), as bearing
	our imputed sin (2 Corinthians 5:21), was
	consecrated (John 17:17; John 17:19)
	and purified by the shedding of His blood to be the meeting place of
	God and man.
