24. Resumption more fully of the
	thought, "He entered in once into the holy place,"  :-. He has in Hebrews 9:13;
	Hebrews 9:14, expanded the words "by
	his own blood," Hebrews 9:12;
	and in Hebrews 9:15-23, he
	has enlarged on "an High Priest of good things to come." 
	not . . . into . . . holy
	places made with hands—as was the Holy of Holies in the earthly
	tabernacle (see on Hebrews 9:11). 
	figures—copies "of
	the true" holiest place, heaven, the original archetype (Hebrews 9:11- :). 
	into heaven itself—the
	immediate presence of the invisible God beyond all the created
	heavens, through which latter Jesus passed (see on Hebrews 9:11- :; Hebrews 9:11- :). 
	now—ever since His
	ascension in the present economy (compare Hebrews 9:11- :). 
	to appear—To PRESENT
	HIMSELF; Greek, "to
	be made to appear." Mere man may have a vision through a medium,
	or veil, as Moses had (Exodus 33:18;
	Exodus 33:20-23). Christ alone
	beholds the Father without a veil, and is His perfect image. Through
	seeing HIM only can we see
	the Father. 
	in the presence of God—Greek,
	"to the face of God." The saints shall hereafter see
	God's face in Christ (Revelation 22:4):
	the earnest of which is now given (Revelation 22:4- :). Aaron, the Levitical high priest for the people,
	stood before the ark and only saw the cloud, the symbol
	of God's glory (Exodus 28:30). 
	for us—in our behalf as
	our Advocate and Intercessor (Hebrews 7:25;
	Romans 8:34; 1 John 2:1).
	"It is enough that Jesus should show Himself for us to
	the Father: the sight of Jesus satisfied God in our behalf. He brings
	before the face of God no offering which has exhausted itself, and,
	as only sufficing for a time, needs renewal; but He himself is in
	person, by virtue of the eternal Spirit, that is, the imperishable
	life of His person, now and for ever freed from death, our eternally
	present offering before God" [DELITZSCH
	in ALFORD].
