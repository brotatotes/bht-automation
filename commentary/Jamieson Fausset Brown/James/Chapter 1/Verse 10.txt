	"rich" in worldly goods, "he shall pass away"; in
	so far as his predominant character is that of a "brother,"
	he "abideth for ever" ( :-). This view meets all ALFORD'S
	objections to regarding "the rich" here as a "brother"
	at all. To avoid making the rich a brother, he translates, "But
	the rich glories in his humiliation," namely, in that which is
	really his debasement (his rich state,  :-), just as the low is told to rejoice in what is really his
	exaltation (his lowly state).
