12. Blessed—Compare the
	beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:4;
	Matthew 5:10; Matthew 5:11).
	endureth temptation—not
	the "falling into divers temptations" (Matthew 5:11- :) is the matter for "joy," but the enduring
	of temptation "unto the end." Compare Matthew 5:11- :. 
	when he is tried—literally,
	"when he has become tested" or "approved," when
	he has passed through the "trying" (Matthew 5:11- :), his "faith" having finally gained the victory. 
	the crown—not in
	allusion to the crown or garland given to winners in the games; for
	this, though a natural allusion for Paul in writing to the heathen,
	among whom such games existed, would be less appropriate for James in
	addressing the Jewish Christians, who regarded Gentile usages with
	aversion. 
	of life—"life"
	constitutes the crown, literally, the life, the only true
	life, the highest and eternal life. The crown implies a kingdom
	(Psalms 21:3). 
	the Lord—not found in
	the best manuscripts and versions. The believer's heart fills up the
	omission, without the name needing to be mentioned. The "faithful
	One who promised" (Psalms 21:3- :). 
	to them that love him—In
	2 Timothy 4:8, "the crown of
	righteousness to them that love His appearing." Love produces
	patient endurance: none attest their love more than they who
	suffer for Him.
