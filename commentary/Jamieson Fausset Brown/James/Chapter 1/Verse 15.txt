15. The guilty union is
	committed by the will embracing the temptress. "Lust," the
	harlot, then, "brings forth sin," namely, of that kind to
	which the temptation inclines. Then the particular sin (so the
	Greek implies), "when it is completed, brings forth
	death," with which it was all along pregnant [ALFORD].
	This "death" stands in striking contrast to the "crown
	of life" (James 1:12)
	which "patience" or endurance ends in, when it has
	its "perfect work" (James 1:12- :). He who will fight Satan with Satan's own weapons, must not
	wonder if he finds himself overmatched. Nip sin in the bud of lust.
