18. ( :-). The believer's regeneration is the highest example of
	nothing but good proceeding from God. 
	Of his own will—Of his
	own good pleasure (which shows that it is God's essential nature to
	do good, not evil), not induced by any external cause.

	a once-for-all accomplished act (1 Peter 1:3;
	1 Peter 1:23). In contrast to "lust
	when it hath conceived, bringeth forth sin, and sin . . .
	death" (James 1:15).

	Gospel. The objective mean, as faith is the appropriating mean
	of regeneration by the Holy Spirit as the efficient agent. 
	a kind of first-fruits—Christ
	is, in respect to the resurrection, "the first-fruits"
	(1 Corinthians 15:20; 1 Corinthians 15:23):
	believers, in respect to regeneration, are, as it were,
	first-fruits (image from the consecration of the first-born of man,
	cattle, and fruits to God; familiar to the Jews addressed), that is,
	they are the first of God's regenerated creatures, and the pledge of
	the ultimate regeneration of the creation, Romans 8:19;
	Romans 8:23, where also the Spirit,
	the divine agent of the believer's regeneration, is termed "the
	first-fruits," that is, the earnest that the regeneration now
	begun in the soul, shall at last extend to the body too, and to the
	lower parts of creation. Of all God's visible creatures, believers
	are the noblest part, and like the legal "first-fruits,"
	sanctify the rest; for this reason they are much tried now.
