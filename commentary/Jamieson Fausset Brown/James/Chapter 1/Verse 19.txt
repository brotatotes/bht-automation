19. Wherefore—as your evil is
	of yourselves, but your good from God. However, the oldest
	manuscripts and versions read thus: "YE
	KNOW IT (so Ephesians 5:5;
	Hebrews 12:17), my beloved brethren;
	BUT (consequently) let
	every man be swift to hear," that is, docile in receiving "the
	word of truth" (James 1:18;
	James 1:21). The true method of
	hearing is treated in James 1:21-27;
	James 2:1-26. 
	slow to speak— (Proverbs 10:19;
	Proverbs 17:27; Proverbs 17:28;
	Ecclesiastes 5:2). A good way of escaping
	one kind of temptation arising from ourselves (Ecclesiastes 5:2- :). Slow to speak authoritatively as a master or teacher of
	others (compare James 3:1): a
	common Jewish fault: slow also to speak such hasty things of God, as
	in James 1:13. Two ears are given
	to us, the rabbis observe, but only one tongue: the ears are open and
	exposed, whereas the tongue is walled in behind the teeth. 
	slow to wrath— (James 3:13;
	James 3:14; James 4:5).
	Slow in becoming heated by debate: another Jewish fault (James 4:5- :), to which much speaking tends. TITTMANN
	thinks not so much "wrath" is meant, as an indignant
	feeling of fretfulness under the calamities to which the whole
	of human life is exposed; this accords with the "divers
	temptations" in James 1:2.
	Hastiness of temper hinders hearing God's word; so Naaman, 2 Kings 5:11;
	Luke 4:28.
