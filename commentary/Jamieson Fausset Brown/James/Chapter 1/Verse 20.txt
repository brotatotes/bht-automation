20. Man's angry zeal in
	debating, as if jealous for the honor of God's righteousness, is far
	from working that which is really righteousness in God's sight. True
	"righteousness is sown in peace," not in wrath ( :-). The oldest and best reading means "worketh,"
	that is, practiceth not: the received reading is "worketh,"
	produceth not.
