21. lay apart—"once for
	all" (so the Greek): as a filthy garment. Compare
	Joshua's filthy garments, Zechariah 3:3;
	Zechariah 3:5; Revelation 7:14.
	"Filthiness" is cleansed away by hearing the word (Revelation 7:14- :). 
	superfluity of
	naughtiness—excess (for instance, the intemperate
	spirit implied in "wrath," James 1:19;
	James 1:20), which arises from
	malice (our natural, evil disposition towards one
	another). 1 Peter 2:1 has the very
	same words in the Greek. So "malice" is the
	translation, Ephesians 4:31; Colossians 3:8.
	"Faulty excess" [BENGEL]
	is not strong enough. Superfluous excess in speaking is also
	reprobated as "coming of evil" (the Greek is
	akin to the word for "naughtiness" here) in the Sermon on
	the Mount (Matthew 5:37), with which
	James' Epistle is so connected. 
	with meekness—in
	mildness towards one another [ALFORD],
	the opposite to "wrath" (Matthew 5:37- :): answering to "as new-born babes" (Matthew 5:37- :). Meekness, I think, includes also a childlike,
	docile, humble, as well as an uncontentious, spirit (Psalms 25:9;
	Psalms 45:4; Isaiah 66:2;
	Matthew 5:5; Matthew 11:28-30;
	Matthew 18:3; Matthew 18:4;
	contrast Romans 2:8). On "receive,"
	applied to ground receiving seed, compare Romans 2:8- :. Contrast Acts 17:11;
	1 Thessalonians 1:6; 2 Thessalonians 2:10.
	engrafted word—the
	Gospel word, whose proper attribute is to be engrafted
	by the Holy Spirit, so as to be livingly incorporated with the
	believer, as the fruitful shoot is with the wild natural stock on
	which it is engrafted. The law came to man only from without, and
	admonished him of his duty. The Gospel is engrafted inwardly,
	and so fulfils the ultimate design of the law (Deuteronomy 6:6;
	Deuteronomy 11:18; Psalms 119:11).
	ALFORD translates, "The
	implanted word," referring to the parable of the sower
	(Matthew 13:1-23). I prefer
	English Version.
able to save—a strong
	incentive to correct our dulness in hearing the word: that word which
	we hear so carelessly, is able (instrumentally) to save us [CALVIN].
	souls—your true selves,
	for the "body" is now liable to sickness and death: but the
	soul being now saved, both soul and body at last shall be so (James 5:15;
	James 5:20).
