18. "But some one
	will say": so the Greek. This verse continues the
	argument from James 2:14; James 2:16.
	One may say he has faith though he have not works. Suppose one
	were to say to a naked brother, "Be warmed," without
	giving him needful clothing. "But someone (entertaining
	views of the need of faith having works joined to it) will say (in
	opposition to the 'say' of the professor)." 
	show me thy faith without thy
	worksâ€”if thou canst; but thou canst not SHOW,
	that is, manifest or evidence thy alleged (James 2:16- :, "say") faith without works. "Show" does
	not mean here to prove to me, but exhibit to me. Faith
	is unseen save by God. To show faith to man, works in some
	form or other are needed: we are justified judicially by God (James 2:16- :); meritoriously, by Christ (James 2:16- :); mediately, by faith (James 2:16- :); evidentially, by works. The question here is not as to the
	ground on which believers are justified, but about the
	demonstration of their faith: so in the case of Abraham. In James 2:16- : it is written, God did tempt Abraham, that is, put to
	the test of demonstration the reality of his faith, not for
	the satisfaction of God, who already knew it well, but to demonstrate
	it before men. The offering of Isaac at that time, quoted here, James 2:16- :, formed no part of the ground of his justification,
	for he was justified previously on his simply believing in the
	promise of spiritual heirs, that is, believers, numerous as the
	stars. He was then justified: that justification was showed or
	manifested by his offering Isaac forty years after. That work of
	faith demonstrated, but did not contribute to his
	justification. The tree shows its life by its fruits, but it
	was alive before either fruits or even leaves appeared.
