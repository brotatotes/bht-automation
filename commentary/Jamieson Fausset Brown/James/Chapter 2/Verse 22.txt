22. Or, "thou seest." 
	how—rather, "that."
	In the two clauses which follow, emphasize "faith" in the
	former, and "works" in the latter, to see the sense
	[BENGEL]. 
	faith wrought with his
	works—for it was by faith he offered his son. Literally,
	"was working (at the time) with his works." 
	by works was faith made
	perfect—not was vivified, but attained its fully
	consummated development, and is shown to be real. So "my
	strength is made perfect in weakness," that is, exerts
	itself most perfectly, shows how great it is [CAMERON]:
	so 1 John 4:17; Hebrews 2:10;
	Hebrews 5:9. The germ really, from
	the first, contains in it the full-grown tree, but its perfection is
	not attained till it is matured fully. So Hebrews 5:9- :, "Let patience have her perfect work," that
	is, have its full effect by showing the most perfect degree of
	endurance, "that ye may be perfect," that is, fully
	developed in the exhibition of the Christian character.
	ALFORD explains, "Received
	its realization, was entirely exemplified and filled up." So
	Paul, Philippians 2:12, "Work out
	your own salvation": the salvation was already in germ theirs in
	their free justification through faith. It needed to be worked out
	still to fully developed perfection in their life.
