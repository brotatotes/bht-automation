26. Faith is a spiritual thing:
	works are material. Hence we might expect faith to answer to
	the spirit, works to the body. But James reverses this. He
	therefore does not mean that faith in all cases answers to the body;
	but the FORM of faith
	without the working reality answers to the body without
	the animating spirit. It does not follow that living faith
	derives its life from works, as the body derives its life from the
	animating spirit.
