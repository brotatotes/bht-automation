	are become judges of evil
	thoughts—The Greek words for "judges" and for
	"partial," are akin in sound and meaning. A similar
	translation ought therefore to be given to both. Thus, either for
	"judges," c. translate, "distinguishers of
	(that is, according to your) evil thoughts" or, do ye not
	partially judge between men, and are become evilly-thinking
	judges (Mark 7:21)? The "evil
	thoughts" are in the judges themselves; as in Mark 7:21- :, the Greek, "judge of injustice," is
	translated, "unjust judge." ALFORD
	and WAHL translate, "Did
	ye not doubt" (respecting your faith, which is
	inconsistent with the distinctions made by you between rich and
	poor)? For the Greek constantly means "doubt"
	in all the New Testament. So in Mark 7:21- :, "wavering." Matthew 21:21;
	Acts 10:20; Romans 4:20,
	"staggered not." The same play on the same kindred words
	occurs in the Greek of Romans 14:10;
	Romans 14:23, "judge . . .
	doubteth." The same blame of being a judge, when one ought to be
	an obeyer, of the law is found in Romans 14:23- :.
