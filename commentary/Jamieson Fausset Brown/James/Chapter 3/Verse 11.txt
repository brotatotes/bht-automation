11. fountainâ€”an image of the
	heart: as the aperture (so the Greek for "place"
	is literally) of the fountain is an image of man's mouth. The
	image here is appropriate to the scene of the Epistle, Palestine,
	wherein salt and bitter springs are found. Though "sweet"
	springs are sometimes found near, yet "sweet and bitter"
	(water) do not flow "at the same place" (aperture).
	Grace can make the same mouth that "sent forth the bitter"
	once, send forth the sweet for the time to come: as the wood (typical
	of Christ's cross) changed Marah's bitter water into sweet.
