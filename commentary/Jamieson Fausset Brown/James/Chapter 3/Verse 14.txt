14. if ye have—as is the
	case (this is implied in the Greek indicative). 
	bitter—  :-, "bitterness." 
	envying—rather,
	"emulation," or literally, "zeal": kindly,
	generous emulation, or zeal, is not condemned, but that which is
	"bitter" [BENGEL].
	strife—rather,
	"rivalry." 
	in your hearts—from
	which flow your words and deeds, as from a fountain. 
	glory not, and lie not
	against the truth—To boast of your wisdom is virtually a
	lying against the truth (the gospel), while your lives belie your
	glorying. James 3:15; James 1:18,
	"The word of truth." Romans 2:17;
	Romans 2:23, speaks similarly of the
	same contentious Jewish Christians.
