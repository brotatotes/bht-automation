15. This wisdom—in which ye
	"glory," as if ye were "wise" (James 3:13;
	James 3:14). 
	descendeth not from
	above—literally, "is not one descending," c.: "from
	the Father of lights" (true illumination and wisdom), James 3:14- : through "the Spirit of truth," James 3:14- :. 
	earthly—opposed to
	heavenly. Distinct from "earthy," James 3:14- :. Earthly is what is IN
	the earth; earthy, what is of the earth. 
	sensual—literally,
	"animal-like": the wisdom of the "natural" (the
	same Greek) man, not born again of God; "not having the
	Spirit" (Judges 1:19). 
	devilish—in its origin
	(from "hell," James 3:6;
	not from God, the Giver of true wisdom, James 3:6- :), and also in its character, which accords with its origin.
	Earthly, sensual, and devilish, answer to the three spiritual foes of
	man, the world, the flesh, and the devil.
