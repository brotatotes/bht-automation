16. envying—So English
	Version translates the Greek, which usually means "zeal";
	"emulation," in  :-. "The envious man stands in his own light. He thinks
	his candle cannot shine in the presence of another's sun. He aims
	directly at men, obliquely at God, who makes men to differ." 
	strife—rivalry
	[ALFORD]. 
	confusion—literally,
	"tumultuous anarchy": both in society (translated
	"commotions," Luke 21:9;
	"tumults," 2 Corinthians 6:5),
	and in the individual mind; in contrast to the "peaceable"
	composure of true "wisdom," 2 Corinthians 6:5- :. James does not honor such effects of this earthly wisdom
	with the name "fruit," as he does in the case of the wisdom
	from above. James 3:18; compare
	Galatians 5:19-22, "works
	of the flesh . . . fruit of the Spirit."
