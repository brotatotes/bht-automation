17. first pure—literally,
	"chaste," "sanctified": pure from all that is
	"earthly, sensual (animal), devilish" ( :-). This is put, "first of all," before
	"peaceable" because there is an unholy peace with the world
	which makes no distinction between clean and unclean. Compare
	"undefiled" and "unspotted from the world,"
	James 1:27; James 4:4;
	James 4:8, "purify . . .
	hearts"; 1 Peter 1:22,
	"purified . . . souls" (the same Greek).
	Ministers must not preach before a purifying change of heart,
	"Peace," where there is no peace. Seven (the perfect
	number) characteristic peculiarities of true wisdom are enumerated.
	Purity or sanctity is put first because it has respect
	both to God and to ourselves; the six that follow regard our fellow
	men. Our first concern is to have in ourselves sanctity; our second,
	to be at peace with men. 
	gentle—"forbearing";
	making allowances for others; lenient towards neighbors, as to the
	DUTIES they owe us. 
	easy to be
	entreated—literally, "easily persuaded," tractable;
	not harsh as to a neighbor's FAULTS.
	full of mercy—as to a
	neighbor's MISERIES. 
	good fruits—contrasted
	with "every evil work," 1 Peter 1:22- :. 
	without partiality—recurring
	to the warning against partial "respect to persons,"
	James 2:1; James 2:4;
	James 2:9. ALFORD
	translates as the Greek is translated, James 2:9- :, "wavering," "without doubting."
	But thus there would be an epithet referring to one's self
	inserted amidst those referring to one's conduct towards others.
	English Version is therefore better. 
	without hypocrisy—Not
	as ALFORD explains from
	James 1:22; James 1:26,
	"Without deceiving yourselves" with the name without the
	reality of religion. For it must refer, like the rest of the six
	epithets, to our relations to others; our peaceableness and mercy
	towards others must be "without dissimulation."
