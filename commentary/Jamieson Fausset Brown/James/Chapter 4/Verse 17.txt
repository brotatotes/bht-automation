17. The general principle
	illustrated by the particular example just discussed is here stated:
	knowledge without practice is imputed to a man as great and
	presumptuous sin. James reverts to the principle with which he
	started. Nothing more injures the soul than wasted impressions.
	Feelings exhaust themselves and evaporate, if not embodied in
	practice. As we will not act except we feel, so if we will not act
	out our feelings, we shall soon cease to feel.
