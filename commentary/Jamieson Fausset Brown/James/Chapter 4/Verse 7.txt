7. Submit to . . . God—so ye
	shall be among "the humble,"  :-; also James 4:10; 1 Peter 5:6.
	Resist . . . devil—Under
	his banner pride and envy are enlisted in the world;
	resist his temptations to these. Faith, humble prayers, and heavenly
	wisdom, are the weapons of resistance. The language is taken from
	warfare. "Submit" as a good soldier puts himself in
	complete subjection to his captain. "Resist," stand bravely
	against. 
	he will flee—Translate,
	"he shall flee." For it is a promise of God, not a
	mere assurance from man to man [ALFORD].
	He shall flee worsted as he did from Christ.
