8. Draw nigh to God—So "cleave
	unto Him," Deuteronomy 30:20,
	namely, by prayerfully (James 4:2;
	James 4:3) "resisting Satan,"
	who would oppose our access to God. 
	he will draw nigh—propitious.
	Cleanse . . . hands—the
	outward instruments of action. None but the clean-handed can ascend
	into the hill of the Lord (justified through Christ, who alone was
	perfectly so, and as such "ascended" thither). 
	purify . . . hearts—literally
	"make chaste" of your spiritual adultery (James 4:3- :, that is, worldliness) "your hearts": the inward
	source of all impurity. 
	double-minded—divided
	between God and the world. The "double-minded" is at fault
	in heart; the sinner in his hands likewise.
