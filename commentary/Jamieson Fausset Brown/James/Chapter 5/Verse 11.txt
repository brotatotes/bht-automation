11. count them happy— ( :-). 
	which endure—The oldest
	authorities read, "which have endured," which suits the
	sense better than English Version: "Those who in past
	days, like the prophets and Job, have endured trials." Such, not
	those who "have lived in pleasure and been wanton on the earth"
	(James 5:5), are "happy."
	patience—rather,
	"endurance," answering to "endure": the Greek
	words similarly corresponding. Distinct from the Greek word

	remember also Job's happy "end." Hence, learn, though much
	tried, to "endure to the end." 
	that—ALFORD
	and others translate, "inasmuch as," "for." 
	pitiful . . . of tender
	mercy—The former refers to the "feeling" the latter,
	to the act. His pity is shown in not laying on the
	patient endurer more trials than he is able to bear; His
	mercy, in His giving a happy "end" to the trials
	[BENGEL].
