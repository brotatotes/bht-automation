16. The oldest authorities read,
	"Confess, THEREFORE,"
	c. Not only in the particular case of sickness, but universally
	confess.

	and offenses, in relation to one another. The word is not the

Matthew 5:24; Luke 17:4,

	one to another—not to
	the priest, as Rome insists. The Church of England recommends
	in certain cases. Rome compels confession in all cases.
	Confession is desirable in the case of (1) wrong done to a
	neighbor; (2) when under a troubled conscience we ask counsel
	of a godly minister or friend as to how we may obtain God's
	forgiveness and strength to sin no more, or when we desire their
	intercessory prayers for us ("Pray for one another"):
	"Confession may be made to anyone who can pray" [BENGEL];
	(3) open confession of sin before the Church and the world, in
	token of penitence. Not auricular confession.

	fervent, not "wavering" (Luke 17:4- :), [BEZA]. "When
	energized" by the Spirit, as those were who performed
	miracles [HAMMOND]. This

	request for the healing of another was then likely to be
	granted when he was one possessing a special charism of the
	Spirit. ALFORD
	translates, "Availeth much in its working." The
	"righteous" is one himself careful to avoid "faults,"
	and showing his faith by works (Luke 17:4- :).
