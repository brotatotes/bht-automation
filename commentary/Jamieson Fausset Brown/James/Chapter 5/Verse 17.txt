	"prayed with prayer": Hebraism for prayed intensely.
	Compare Luke 22:15, "With
	desire I have desired," that is, earnestly desired. ALFORD
	is wrong in saying, Elias' prayer that it might not rain "is not
	even hinted at in the Old Testament history." In Luke 22:15- : it is plainly implied, "As the Lord God of Israel
	liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain
	these years, but according to my word." His prophecy of
	the fact was according to a divine intimation given to him in answer
	to prayer. In jealousy for God's honor (Luke 22:15- :), and being of one mind with God in his abhorrence of
	apostasy, he prayed that the national idolatry should be punished
	with a national judgment, drought; and on Israel's profession of
	repentance he prayed for the removal of the visitation, as is implied
	in 1 Kings 18:39-42;
	compare Luke 4:25.
