19. The blessing of reclaiming
	an erring sinner by the mutual consent and intercessory prayer just
	recommended. 
	do err—more literally,
	"be led astray." 
	the truth—the Gospel
	doctrine and precepts. 
	one—literally, "any";
	as "any" before. Everyone ought to seek the
	salvation of everyone [BENGEL].
