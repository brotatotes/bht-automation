3. is cankered—"rusted
	through" [ALFORD]. 
	rust . . . witness against
	you—in the day of judgment; namely, that your riches were of no
	profit to any, lying unemployed and so contracting rust. 
	shall eat your flesh—The
	rust which once ate your riches, shall then gnaw your conscience,
	accompanied with punishment which shall prey upon your bodies for
	ever. 
	as . . . fire—not with
	the slow process of rusting, but with the swiftness of
	consuming fire.
for the last days—Ye
	have heaped together, not treasures as ye suppose (compare  :-), but wrath against the last days, namely, the coming
	judgment of the Lord. ALFORD
	translates more literally, "In these last days (before
	the coming judgment) ye laid up (worldly) treasure" to no
	profit, instead of repenting and seeking salvation (see on  :-).
