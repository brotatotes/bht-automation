10-13. He was in the world,
	c.—The language here is nearly as wonderful as the thought. Observe
	its compact simplicity, its sonorousness—"the world"
	resounding in each of its three members—and the enigmatic form in
	which it is couched, startling the reader and setting his ingenuity
	a-working to solve the stupendous enigma of Christ ignored in His
	own world. "The world," in the first two clauses,
	plainly means the created world, into which He
	came, says John 1:9 "in
	it He was," says this verse. By His Incarnation, He became an
	inhabitant of it, and bound up with it. Yet it "was made by
	Him" (John 1:3-5).
	Here, then, it is merely alluded to, in contrast partly with His
	being in it, but still more with the reception He met with
	from it. "The world that knew Him not" (John 1:3-43.1.5- :) is of course the intelligent world of mankind. (See on John 1:3-43.1.5- :). Taking the first two clauses as one statement, we try
	to apprehend it by thinking of the infant Christ conceived in the
	womb and born in the arms of His own creature, and of the Man Christ
	Jesus breathing His own air, treading His own ground, supported by
	substances to which He Himself gave being, and the Creator of the
	very men whom He came to save. But the most vivid commentary on this
	entire verse will be got by tracing (in His matchless history) Him of
	whom it speaks walking amidst all the elements of nature, the
	diseases of men and death itself, the secrets of the human heart, and
	"the rulers of the darkness of this world" in all their
	number, subtlety, and malignity, not only with absolute ease, as
	their conscious Lord, but, as we might say, with full consciousness
	on their part of the presence of their Maker, whose will to one and
	all of them was law. And this is He of whom it is added, "the
	world knew Him not!"
