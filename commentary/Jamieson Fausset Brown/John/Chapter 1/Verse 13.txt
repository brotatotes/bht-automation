	therefore not of mere title and privilege, but of nature, the
	soul being made conscious of the vital capacities, perceptions, and
	emotions of a child of God, before unknown.

	of superior human descent, not of human generation at all, not of man
	in any manner of way. By this elaborate threefold denial of the human
	source of this sonship, immense force is given to what follows, 
	but of God—Right royal
	gift, and He who confers must be absolutely divine. For who would not
	worship Him who can bring him into the family, and evoke within him
	the very life, of the sons of God?
