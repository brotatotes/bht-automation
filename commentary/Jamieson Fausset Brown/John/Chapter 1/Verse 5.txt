5. shineth in darkness, &c.—in
	this dark, fallen world, or in mankind "sitting in darkness and
	the shadow of death," with no ability to find the way either
	of truth or of holiness. In this thick darkness, and consequent
	intellectual and moral obliquity, "the light of the Word"
	shineth—by all the rays whether of natural or revealed teaching
	which men (apart from the Incarnation of the Word) are favored
	with.
the darkness comprehended it
	not—did not take it in, a brief summary of the effect of
	all the strivings of this unincarnate Word throughout this
	wide world from the beginning, and a hint of the necessity of His
	putting on flesh, if any recovery of men was to be effected
	(1 Corinthians 1:21).
