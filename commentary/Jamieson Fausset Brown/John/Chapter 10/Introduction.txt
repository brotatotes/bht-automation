 CHAPTER 10 
	
 :-. THE GOOD
	SHEPHERD. 
	This discourse seems plainly to be
	a continuation of the closing verses of the ninth chapter. The figure
	was familiar to the Jewish ear (from Jeremiah 23:1-40;
	Ezekiel 34:1-31; Zechariah 11:1-17,
	&c.). "This simple creature [the sheep] has this special
	note among all animals, that it quickly hears the voice of the
	shepherd, follows no one else, depends entirely on him, and seeks
	help from him aloneâ€”cannot help itself, but is shut up to another's
	aid" [LUTHER in
	STIER].
