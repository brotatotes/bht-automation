1, 2. He that entereth not by the
	door—the legitimate way (without saying what that was, as yet).
	into the sheepfold—the
	sacred enclosure of God's true people. 
	climbeth up some other
	way—not referring to the assumption of ecclesiastical office
	without an external call, for those Jewish rulers, specially aimed
	at, had this (Matthew 23:2), but to
	the want of a true spiritual commission, the seal of heaven going
	along with the outward authority; it is the assumption of the
	spiritual guidance of the people without this that is meant.
