	sheep are not—who has no property, in them. By this He
	points to His own peculiar relation to the sheep, the same as His
	Father's, the great Proprietor and Lord of the flock, who styles Him
	"My Shepherd, the Man that is My Fellow" ( :-), and though faithful under-shepherds are so in their
	Master's interest, that they feel a measure of His own concern for
	their charge, the language is strictly applicable only to "the
	Son over His own house" ( :-). 
	seeth the wolf coming—not
	the devil distinctively, as some take it [STIER,
	ALFORD, &c.], but
	generally whoever comes upon the flock with hostile intent, in
	whatever form: though the wicked one, no doubt, is at the bottom
	of such movements [LUTHARDT].
