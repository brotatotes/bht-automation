14. I am the good shepherd, and know
	my sheep—in the peculiar sense of  :-. 
	am known of mine—the
	soul's response to the voice that has inwardly and efficaciously
	called it; for of this mutual loving acquaintance ours is the effect
	of His. "The Redeemer's knowledge of us is the active
	element, penetrating us with His power and life; that of believers is
	the passive principle, the reception of His life and light. In
	this reception, however, an assimilation of the soul to the sublime
	object of its knowledge and love takes place; and thus an activity,
	though a derived one, is unfolded, which shows itself in obedience to
	His commands" [OLSHAUSEN].
	From this mutual knowledge Jesus rises to another and loftier
	reciprocity of knowledge.
