18. No man taketh it from me, but I
	lay it down myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to
	take it again—It is impossible for language more plainly and
	emphatically to express the absolute voluntariness of Christ's
	death, such a voluntariness as it would be manifest presumption in
	any mere creature to affirm of his own death. It is beyond all
	doubt the language of One who was conscious that His life was His
	own (which no creature's is), and therefore His to surrender or
	retain at will. Here lay the glory of His sacrifice, that it
	was purely voluntary. The claim of "power to take it
	again" is no less important, as showing that His resurrection,
	though ascribed to the Father, in the sense we shall presently see,
	was nevertheless His own assertion of His own right to life as
	soon as the purposes of His voluntary death were accomplished. 
	This commandment—to
	"lay down His—life, that He might take it again." 
	have I received of my
	Father—So that Christ died at once by "command" of
	His Father, and by such a voluntary obedience to that command as has
	made Him (so to speak) infinitely dear to the Father. The necessity
	of Christ's death, in the light of these profound sayings, must be
	manifest to all but the superficial student.
