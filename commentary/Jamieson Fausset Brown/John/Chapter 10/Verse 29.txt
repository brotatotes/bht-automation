29. My Father, which gave them
	me—(See on John 6:37). 
	is greater than all—with
	whom no adverse power can contend. It is a general expression of an
	admitted truth, and what follows shows for what purpose it was
	uttered, "and none is able to pluck them out of My Father's
	hand." The impossibility of true believers being lost, in the
	midst of all the temptations which they may encounter, does not
	consist in their fidelity and decision, but is founded upon the power
	of God. Here the doctrine of predestination is presented in its
	sublime and sacred aspect; there is a predestination of the holy,
	which is taught from one end of the Scriptures to the other; not,
	indeed, of such a nature that an "irresistible grace"
	compels the opposing will of man (of course not), but so that
	that will of man which receives and loves the commands of God is
	produced only by God's grace (OLSHAUSEN—a
	testimony all the more valuable, being given in spite of Lutheran
	prejudice).
