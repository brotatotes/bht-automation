30. I and my Father are one—Our
	language admits not of the precision of the original in this great
	saying. "Are" is in the masculine gender—"we
	(two persons) are"; while "one" is neuter—"one
	thing." Perhaps "one interest" expresses,
	as nearly as may be, the purport of the saying. There seemed to be
	some contradiction between His saying they had been given by His
	Father into His own hands, out of which they could not be
	plucked, and then saying that none could pluck them out of His
	Father's hands, as if they had not been given out of them.
	"Neither have they," says He; "though He has
	given them to Me, they are as much in His own almighty hands as
	ever—they cannot be, and when given to Me they are not,
	given away from Himself; for HE
	AND I HAVE ALL IN COMMON."
	Thus it will be seen, that, though oneness of essence is not
	the precise thing here affirmed, that truth is the basis of what
	is affirmed, without which it would not be true. And AUGUSTINE
	was right in saying the "We are" condemns the
	Sabellians (who denied the distinction of Persons in
	the Godhead), while the "one" (as explained)
	condemns the Arians (who denied the unity of their essence).
