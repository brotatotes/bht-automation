8. All that ever came before me—the
	false prophets; not as claiming the prerogatives of Messiah, but as
	perverters of the people from the way of life, all pointing to Him
	[OLSHAUSEN]. 
	the sheep did not hear
	them—the instinct of their divinely taught hearts preserving
	them from seducers, and attaching them to the heaven-sent prophets,
	of whom it is said that "the Spirit of Christ was in them"
	(1 Peter 1:11).
