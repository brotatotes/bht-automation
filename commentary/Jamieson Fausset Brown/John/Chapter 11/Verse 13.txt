11-16. Our friend Lazarus sleepeth;
	but I go that I may wake him out of sleepâ€”Illustrious title!
	"Our friend Lazarus." To Abraham only is it
	accorded in the Old Testament, and not till after his death,
	(2 Chronicles 20:7; Isaiah 41:8),
	to which our attention is called in the New Testament (Isaiah 41:8- :). When Jesus came in the flesh, His forerunner applied this
	name, in a certain sense, to himself (Isaiah 41:8- :); and into the same fellowship the Lord's chosen disciples
	are declared to have come (Isaiah 41:8- :). "The phrase here employed, "our friend
	Lazarus," means more than "he whom Thou lovest"
	in John 11:3, for it implies
	that Christ's affection was reciprocated by Lazarus"
	[LAMPE]. Our Lord had been
	told only that Lazarus was "sick." But the change which his
	two days' delay had produced is here tenderly alluded to. Doubtless,
	His spirit was all the while with His dying, and now dead "friend."
	The symbol of "sleep" for death is common to all
	languages, and familiar to us in the Old Testament. In the New
	Testament, however, a higher meaning is put into it, in relation to
	believers in Jesus (see on John 11:3- :),
	a sense hinted at, and clearly, in John 11:3- : [LUTHARDT]; and
	the "awaking out of sleep" acquires a corresponding sense
	far transcending bare resuscitation.
