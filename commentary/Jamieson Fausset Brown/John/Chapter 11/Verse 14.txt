	plainly, Lazarus is deadâ€”Says BENGEL
	beautifully, "Sleep is the death of the saints, in the language
	of heaven; but this language the disciples here understood not;

	but such is the slowness of men's apprehension that Scripture often
	has to descend to the more miserable style of human discourse;
	compare Matthew 16:11."
