41. Jesus lifted up his eyes—an
	expression marking His calm solemnity. (Compare  :-). 
	Father, I thank thee that
	thou hast heard me—rather, "heardest Me," referring
	to a specific prayer offered by Him, probably on intelligence of the
	case reaching Him (John 11:3;
	John 11:4); for His living and
	loving oneness with the Father was maintained and manifested in the
	flesh, not merely by the spontaneous and uninterrupted outgoing of
	Each to Each in spirit, but by specific actings of faith and
	exercises of prayer about each successive case as it emerged. He
	prayed (says LUTHARDT
	well) not for what He wanted, but for the manifestation of what He
	had; and having the bright consciousness of the answer in the felt
	liberty to ask it, and the assurance that it was at hand, He gives
	thanks for this with a grand simplicity before performing the act.
