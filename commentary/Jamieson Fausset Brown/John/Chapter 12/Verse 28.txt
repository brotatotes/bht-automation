28. Father, glorify thy name—by
	a present testimony. 
	I have both glorified
	it—referring specially to the voice from heaven at His baptism,
	and again at His transfiguration.
and will glorify it
	again—that is, in the yet future scenes of His still deeper
	necessity; although this promise was a present and sublime testimony,
	which would irradiate the clouded spirit of the Son of man.
