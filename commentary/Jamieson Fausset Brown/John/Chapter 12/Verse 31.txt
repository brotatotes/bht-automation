31. Now is the judgment of this
	world—the world that "crucified the Lord of glory"
	(1 Corinthians 2:8), considered as a vast
	and complicated kingdom of Satan, breathing his spirit, doing his
	work, and involved in his doom, which Christ's death by its hands
	irrevocably sealed. 
	now shall the prince of this
	world be cast out—How differently is that fast-approaching
	"hour" regarded in the kingdoms of darkness and of light!
	"The hour of relief; from the dread Troubler of our peace—how
	near it is! Yet a little moment, and the day is ours!" So it was
	calculated and felt in the one region. "Now shall the prince of
	this world be cast out," is a somewhat different view of the
	same event. We know who was right. Though yet under a veil, He sees
	the triumphs of the Cross in unclouded and transporting light.
