32. And I, if I be lifted up from
	the earth, will draw all men unto me—The "I" here is
	emphatic—I, taking the place of the world's ejected prince. "If
	lifted up," means not only after that I have been lifted up,
	but, through the virtue of that uplifting. And truly, the
	death of the Cross, in all its significance, revealed in the light,
	and borne in upon the heart, by the power of the Holy Ghost,
	possesses an attraction over the wide world—to civilized and
	savage, learned and illiterate, alike—which breaks down all
	opposition, assimilates all to itself, and forms out of the most
	heterogeneous and discordant materials a kingdom of surpassing glory,
	whose uniting principle is adoring subjection "to Him that loved
	them." "Will draw all men 'UNTO ME,'" says He. What
	lips could venture to utter such a word but His, which "dropt as
	an honeycomb," whose manner of speaking was evermore in the same
	spirit of conscious equality with the Father?
