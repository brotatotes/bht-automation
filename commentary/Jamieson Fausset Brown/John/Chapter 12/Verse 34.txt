34. We have heard out of the law—the
	scriptures of the Old Testament (referring to such places as Psalms 89:28;
	Psalms 89:29; Psalms 110:4;
	Daniel 2:44; Daniel 7:13;
	Daniel 7:14). 
	that Christ—the Christ
	"endureth for ever." 
	and how sayest thou, The Son
	of Man must be lifted up, c.—How can that consist with this
	"uplifting?" They saw very well both that He was holding
	Himself up as the Christ and a Christ to die a violent
	death and as that ran counter to all their ideas of the Messianic
	prophecies, they were glad to get this seeming advantage to justify
	their unyielding attitude.
