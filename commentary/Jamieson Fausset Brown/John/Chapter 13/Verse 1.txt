1. when Jesus knew that his hour was
	come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father—On
	these beautiful euphemisms, see on  :-;  :-. 
	having loved his own which
	were in the world, he loved them unto the end—The meaning is,
	that on the very edge of His last sufferings, when it might have been
	supposed that He would be absorbed in His own awful prospects, He was
	so far from forgetting "His own," who were to be left
	struggling "in the world" after He had "departed out
	of it to the Father" ( :-), that in His care for them He seemed scarce to think of
	Himself save in connection with them: "Herein is love," not
	only "enduring to the end," but most affectingly manifested
	when, judging by a human standard, least to be expected.
