21. When Jesus had thus said, he was
	troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say
	unto you, One of you shall betray me—The announcement of  :- seems not to have been plain enough to be quite
	apprehended, save by the traitor himself. He will therefore speak it
	out in terms not to be misunderstood. But how much it cost Him to do
	this, appears from the "trouble" that came over His
	"spirit"—visible emotion, no doubt—before He got it
	uttered. What wounded susceptibility does this disclose, and what
	exquisite delicacy in His social intercourse with the Twelve, to whom
	He cannot, without an effort, break the subject!
