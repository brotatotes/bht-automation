32. If God be glorified in him, God
	shall also—in return and reward of this highest of all services
	ever rendered to Him, or capable of being rendered. 
	glorify him in himself, and .
	. . straightway glorify him—referring now to the Resurrection
	and Exaltation of Christ after this service was over,
	including all the honor and glory then put upon Him, and that will
	for ever encircle Him as Head of the new creation.
