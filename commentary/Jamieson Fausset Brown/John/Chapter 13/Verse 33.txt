33-35. Little children—From
	the height of His own glory He now descends, with sweet pity, to His
	"little children," all now His own. This term of
	endearment, nowhere else used in the Gospels, and once only employed
	by Paul (Galatians 4:19), is
	appropriated by the beloved disciple himself, who no fewer than seven
	times employs it in his first Epistle. 
	Ye shall seek me—feel
	the want of Me. 
	as I said to the Jews—
	(John 7:34; John 8:21).
	But oh in what a different sense!
