34. a new commandment I give unto
	you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love
	one anotherâ€”This was the new feature of it. Christ's
	love to His people in giving His life a ransom for them was
	altogether new, and consequently as a Model and Standard for theirs
	to one another. It is not, however, something transcending the great
	moral law, which is "the old commandment" ( :-, and see on  :-),
	but that law in a new and peculiar form. Hence it is said to
	be both new and old (1 John 2:7;
	1 John 2:8).
