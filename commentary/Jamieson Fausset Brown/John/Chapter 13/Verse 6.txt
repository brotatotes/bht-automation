6-11. Peter saith . . . Lord, dost
	thou wash my feet?â€”Our language cannot bring out the intensely
	vivid contrast between the "Thou" and the "my,"
	which, by bringing them together, the original expresses, for it is
	not good English to say, "Lord, Thou my feet dost wash?"
	But every word of this question is emphatic. Thus far, and in
	the question itself, there was nothing but the most profound and
	beautiful astonishment at a condescension to him quite
	incomprehensible. Accordingly, though there can be no doubt that
	already Peter's heart rebelled against it as a thing not to be
	tolerated, Jesus ministers no rebuke as yet, but only bids him wait a
	little, and he should understand it all.
