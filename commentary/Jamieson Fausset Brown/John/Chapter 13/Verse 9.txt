9. Lord, not my feet only, but also
	my hands and my headâ€”that is, "To be severed from Thee,
	Lord, is death to me: If that be the meaning of my speech, I tread
	upon it; and if to be washed of Thee have such significance, then not
	my feet only, but hands, head, and all, be washed!" This artless
	expression of clinging, life-and-death attachment to Jesus, and felt
	dependence upon Him for his whole spiritual well-being, compared with
	the similar saying in John 6:68;
	John 6:69 (see on John 6:69- :), furnishes such evidence of historic verity such
	as no thoroughly honest mind can resist.
