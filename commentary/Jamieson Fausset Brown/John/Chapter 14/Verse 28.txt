28. If ye loved me, ye would
	rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father, for my Father is
	greater than I—These words, which Arians and Socinians
	perpetually quote as triumphant evidence against the proper Divinity
	of Christ, really yield no intelligible sense on their principles.
	Were a holy man on his deathbed, beholding his friends in
	tears at the prospect of losing him, to say, "Ye ought rather to
	joy than weep for me, and would if ye really loved me, "the
	speech would be quite natural. But if they should ask him, why
	joy at his departure was more suitable than sorrow, would they not
	start back with astonishment, if not horror, were he to reply,
	"Because my Father is greater than I?" Does not this
	strange speech from Christ's lips, then, presuppose such teaching
	on His part as would make it extremely difficult for them to think He
	could gain anything by departing to the Father, and make it necessary
	for Him to say expressly that there was a sense in which He could
	do so? Thus, this startling explanation seems plainly intended to
	correct such misapprehensions as might arise from the emphatic and
	reiterated teaching of His proper equality with the Father—as
	if so Exalted a Person were incapable of any accession by transition
	from this dismal scene to a cloudless heaven and the very bosom of
	the Father—and by assuring them that this was not the case,
	to make them forget their own sorrow in His approaching joy.
