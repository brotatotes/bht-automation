8-12. The substance of this
	passage is that the Son is the ordained and perfect manifestation of
	the Father, that His own word for this ought to His disciples to be
	enough; that if any doubts remained His works ought to remove them
	(see on John 14:1); but yet
	that these works of His were designed merely to aid weak faith, and
	would be repeated, nay exceeded, by His disciples, in virtue of the
	power He would confer on them after His departure. His miracles the
	apostles wrought, though wholly in His name and by His power, and the
	"greater" works—not in degree but in kind—were the
	conversion of thousands in a day, by His Spirit accompanying them.
