2. Every branch in me that beareth
	not fruit . . . every branch that beareth fruit—As in a fruit
	tree, some branches may be fruitful, others quite barren,
	according as there is a vital connection between the branch
	and the stock, or no vital connection; so the disciples of
	Christ may be spiritually fruitful or the reverse, according as they
	are vitally and spiritually connected with Christ, or
	but externally and mechanically attached to Him. The
	fruitless He "taketh away" (see on  :-); the fruitful He "purgeth" (cleanseth,
	pruneth)—stripping it, as the husbandman does, of what is
	rank (Mark 4:19), "that
	it may bring forth more fruit"; a process often painful, but no
	less needful and beneficial than in the natural husbandry.
