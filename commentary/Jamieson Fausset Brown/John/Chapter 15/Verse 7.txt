7. If ye abide in me, and my words .
	. . in you—Mark the change from the inhabitation of Himself
	to that of His words, paving the way for the subsequent
	exhortations (John 15:9; John 15:10).
	ask what ye will, and it
	shall be done unto you—because this indwelling of His words in
	them would secure the harmony of their askings with the divine will.
