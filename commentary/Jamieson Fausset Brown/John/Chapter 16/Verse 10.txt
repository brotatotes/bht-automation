10. Of righteousness, because I go
	to my Father, and ye see me no more—Beyond doubt, it is
	Christ's personal righteousness which the Spirit was to bring
	home to the sinner's heart. The evidence of this was to lie in the
	great historical fact, that He had "gone to His Father
	and was no more visible to men":—for if His claim to be the
	Son of God, the Saviour of the world, had been a lie, how should the
	Father, who is "a jealous God," have raised such a
	blasphemer from the dead and exalted him to His right hand? But if He
	was the "Faithful and True Witness," the Father's
	"Righteous Servant," "His Elect, in whom His soul
	delighted," then was His departure to the Father, and consequent
	disappearance from the view of men, but the fitting consummation, the
	august reward, of all that He did here below, the seal of His
	mission, the glorification of the testimony which He bore on earth,
	by the reception of its Bearer to the Father's bosom. This triumphant
	vindication of Christ's rectitude is to us divine evidence,
	bright as heaven, that He is indeed the Saviour of the world, God's
	Righteous Servant to justify many, because He bare their iniquities
	(Isaiah 53:11). Thus the Spirit,
	in this clause, is seen convincing men that there is in Christ
	perfect relief under the sense of sin of which He had before
	convinced them; and so far from mourning over His absence from us, as
	an irreparable loss, we learn to glory in it, as the evidence of His
	perfect acceptance on our behalf, exclaiming with one who understood
	this point, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's
	elect? It is God that justifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is
	Christ that died; yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at
	the right hand of God," c. (Romans 8:33
Romans 8:34).
