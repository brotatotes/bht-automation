 CHAPTER 17 
	
 :-. THE
	INTERCESSORY PRAYER.
	 
	(See on  :-). Had this prayer not been recorded, what reverential
	reader would not have exclaimed, Oh, to have been within hearing of
	such a prayer as that must have been, which wound up the whole of His
	past ministry and formed the point of transition to the dark scenes
	which immediately followed! But here it is, and with such signature
	of the Lips that uttered it that we seem rather to hear it from
	Himself than read it from the pen of His faithful reporter.
