17. Sanctify them—As the
	former prayer, "Keep them," was "negative,"
	asking protection for them from the poisonous element which
	surrounded and pressed upon their renewed nature, so this prayer,
	"Sanctify them," is positive, asking the advancement
	and completion of their begun sanctification. 
	through—in. 
	thy truth—God's
	revealed truth, as the medium or element of sanctification; a
	statement this of immense importance. 
	thy word is truth—(Compare
	John 15:3; Colossians 1:5;
	Ephesians 1:13).
