22. And the glory which thou
	gavest—hast given. 
	me I have given them, that
	they may be one, even as we are one—The last clause shows the
	meaning of the first. It is not the future glory of the
	heavenly state, but the secret of that present unity just
	before spoken of; the glory, therefore, of the indwelling
	Spirit of Christ; the glory of an accepted state, of a holy
	character, of every grace.
