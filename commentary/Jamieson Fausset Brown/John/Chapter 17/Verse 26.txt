	thy name—in His past
	ministry. 
	and will declare it—in
	yet larger measure, by the gift of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost and
	through all succeeding ages. 
	that the love wherewith thou
	hast loved—lovedst. 
	me may be in them, and I in
	them—This eternal love of the Father, resting first on Christ,
	is by His Spirit imparted to and takes up its permanent abode in all
	that believe in Him; and "He abiding in them and they in Him"
	(John 15:5), they are "one
	Spirit." "With this lofty thought the Redeemer closes
	His prayer for His disciples, and in them for His Church through all
	ages. He has compressed into the last moments given Him for
	conversation with His own the most sublime and glorious sentiments
	ever uttered by mortal lips. But hardly has the sound of the last
	word died away, when He passes with the disciples over the brook
	Kedron to Gethsemane—and the bitter conflict draws on. The seed of
	the new world must be sown in Death, that thence Life may spring up"
