4, 5. I have glorified thee on the
	earth—rather, "I glorified" (for the thing is
	conceived as now past). 
	I have finished—I
	finished. 
	the work which thou gavest me
	to do—It is very important to preserve in the translation the
	past tense, used in the original, otherwise it might be
	thought that the work already "finished" was only
	what He had done before uttering that prayer; whereas it will
	be observed that our Lord speaks throughout as already beyond this
	present scene (John 17:12,
	&c.), and so must be supposed to include in His "finished
	work" the "decease which He was to accomplish at
	Jerusalem."
