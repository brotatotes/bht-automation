24-27. Now Annas had sent him bound
	unto Caiaphas—Our translators so render the words,
	understanding that the foregoing interview took place before
	Caiaphas; Annas, declining to meddle with the case, having
	sent Him to Caiaphas at once. But the words here literally
	are, "Annas sent Him [not 'had sent Him'] to
	Caiaphas"—and the "now" being of doubtful authority.
	Thus read, the verse affords no evidence that He was sent to Caiaphas
	before the interview just recorded, but implies rather the
	contrary. We take this interview, then, with some of the ablest
	interpreters, to be a preliminary and non-official one with Annas,
	at an hour of the night when Caiaphas' Council could not convene; and
	one that ought not to be confounded with that solemn one recorded by
	the other Evangelists, when all were assembled and witnesses called.
	But the building in which both met with Jesus appears to have been
	the same, the room only being different, and the court, of course, in
	that case, one. (Also see on  :-.)
