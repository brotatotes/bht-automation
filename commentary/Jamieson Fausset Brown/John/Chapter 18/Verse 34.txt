34. Jesus answered . . . Sayest thou
	this of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?â€”an important
	question for our Lord's case, to bring out whether the word "King"
	were meant in a political sense, with which Pilate had a right
	to deal, or whether he were merely put up to it by His
	accusers, who had no claims to charge Him but such as were of a
	purely religious nature, with which Pilate had nothing to do.
