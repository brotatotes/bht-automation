35. Pilate answered, Am I a Jew?
	Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee to me: What
	hast thou done?â€”that is, "Jewish questions I neither
	understand nor meddle with; but Thou art here on a charge which,
	though it seems only Jewish, may yet involve
	treasonable matter: As they state it, I cannot decide the
	point; tell me, then, what procedure of Thine has brought Thee into
	this position." In modern phrase, Pilate's object in this
	question was merely to determine the relevancy of the charge.
