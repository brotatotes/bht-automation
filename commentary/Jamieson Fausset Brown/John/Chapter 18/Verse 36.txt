36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is
	not of this world—He does not say "not over,"
	but "not of this world"—that is, in its origin and
	nature; therefore "no such kingdom as need give thee or
	thy master the least alarm." 
	if my kingdom were of this
	world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered
	to the Jews—"A very convincing argument; for if His
	servants did not fight to prevent their King from being delivered up
	to His enemies, much less would they use force for the establishment
	of His kingdom" [WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON]. 
	but now—but the fact
	is. 
	is my kingdom not from
	hence—Our Lord only says whence His kingdom is not—first
	simply affirming it, next giving proof of it, then reaffirming it.
	This was all that Pilate had to do with. The positive nature
	of His kingdom He would not obtrude upon one who was as little able
	to comprehend it, as entitled officially to information about it. (It
	is worthy of notice that the "MY,"
	which occurs four times in this one verse—thrice of
	His kingdom, and once of His servants—is put
	in the emphatic form).
