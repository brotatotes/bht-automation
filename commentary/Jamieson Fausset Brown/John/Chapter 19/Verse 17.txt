17. And he bearing his cross—(See
	on  :-). 
	went forth—Compare  :-, "without the camp"; "without the gate."
	On arriving at the place, "they gave Him vinegar to drink
	mingled with gall [wine mingled with myrrh,  :-], and when He had tasted thereof, He would not drink"
	(Matthew 27:34). This potion was
	stupefying, and given to criminals just before execution, to deaden
	the sense of pain. 
	 Fill high the bowl,
	and spice it well, and pour 
	 The dews oblivious: for
	the Cross is sharp, 
	 The Cross is sharp, and
	He 
	 Is tenderer than a lamb. 
	 
	 KEBLE.
	 
	
But our Lord would die with every
	faculty clear, and in full sensibility to all His sufferings.
 Thou wilt feel all,
	that Thou may'st pity all; 
	 And rather would'st Thou
	wrestle with strong pain 
	 Than overcloud
	Thy soul, 
	 So clear in
	agony, 
	 Or lose one glimpse of
	Heaven before the time, 
	 O most entire and perfect
	Sacrifice, 
	 Renewed in every
	pulse. 
	 
	 KEBLE.
