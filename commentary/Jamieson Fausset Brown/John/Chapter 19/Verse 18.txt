18. they crucified him, and two
	others with him—"malefactors" ( :-), "thieves" (rather "robbers," Matthew 27:38;
	Mark 15:27). 
	on either side one and Jesus
	in the midst—a hellish expedient, to hold Him up as the worst
	of the three. But in this, as in many other of their doings, "the
	scripture was fulfilled, which saith (Mark 15:27- :), And he was numbered with the transgressors"—
	(Mark 15:28) —though the
	prediction reaches deeper. "Then said Jesus"—["probably
	while being nailed to the CROSS,"]
	[OLSHAUSEN], "FATHER,
	FORGIVE THEM, FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO" (Mark 15:28- :) —and again the Scripture was fulfilled which said, "And
	He made intercession for the transgressors" (Mark 15:28- :), though this also reaches deeper. (See Acts 3:17;
	Acts 13:27; and compare Acts 13:27- :). Often have we occasion to observe how our Lord is the
	first to fulfil His own precepts—thus furnishing the right
	interpretation and the perfect Model of them. (See on Acts 13:27- :). How quickly was it seen in "His martyr Stephen,"
	that though He had left the earth in Person, His Spirit remained
	behind, and Himself could, in some of His brightest lineaments, be
	reproduced in His disciples! (Acts 13:27- :). And what does the world in every age owe to these few
	words, spoken where and as they were spoken!
