36. that the scripture should be
	fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be brokenâ€”The reference is
	to the paschal lamb, as to which this ordinance was stringent
	(Exodus 12:46; Numbers 9:12.
	Compare 1 Corinthians 5:7). But though we
	are to see here the fulfilment of a very definite typical ordinance,
	we shall, on searching deeper, see in it a remarkable divine
	interposition to protect the sacred body of Christ from the last
	indignity after He had finished the work given Him to do. Every
	imaginable indignity had been permitted before that, up to the
	moment of His death. But no sooner is that over than an Unseen hand
	is found to have provided against the clubs of the rude soldiers
	coming in contact with that temple of the Godhead. Very different
	from such violence was that spear-thrust, for which not only
	doubting Thomas would thank the soldier, but intelligent believers in
	every age, to whom the certainty of their Lord's death and
	resurrection is the life of their whole Christianity.
