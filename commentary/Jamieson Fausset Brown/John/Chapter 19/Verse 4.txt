4, 5. Pilate . . . went forth again,
	and saith . . . Behold, I bring him forth to you—am bringing,
	that is, going to bring him forth to you. 
	that ye may know I find no
	fault in him—and, by scourging Him and allowing the soldiers to
	make sport of Him, have gone as far to meet your exasperation as can
	be expected from a judge.
