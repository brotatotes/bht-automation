11-15. But Mary stood without at the
	sepulchre weeping, &c.—Brief was the stay of those two men.
	But Mary, arriving perhaps by another direction after they left,
	lingers at the spot, weeping for her missing Lord. As she gazes
	through her tears on the open tomb, she also ventures to stoop down
	and look into it, when lo! "two angels in white" (as from
	the world of light, and see on  :-)
	appear to her in a "sitting" posture, "as having
	finished some business, and awaiting some one to impart tidings to"
	[BENGEL].
