25. We have seen the Lord—This
	way of speaking of Jesus (as John 20:20;
	John 21:7), so suited to His
	resurrection-state, was soon to become the prevailing style. 
	Except I see in his hands the
	print of the nails, and put my linger into the print of the nails,
	and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe—The very
	form of this speech betokens the strength of the unbelief. "It
	is not, If I shall see I shall believe, but, Unless I shall
	see I will not believe; nor does he expect to see, although the
	others tell him they had" [BENGEL].
	How Christ Himself viewed this state of mind, we know from John 21:7- :, "He upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness
	of heart because they believed not them which had seen Him after He
	was risen." But whence sprang this pertinacity of resistance in
	such minds? Not certainly from reluctance to believe, but as
	in Nathanael (see on John 1:46)
	from mere dread of mistake in so vital a matter.
