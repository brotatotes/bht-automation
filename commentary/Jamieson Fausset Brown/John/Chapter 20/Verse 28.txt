28. Thomas answered and said unto
	him, My Lord and my God—That Thomas did not do what
	Jesus invited him to do, and what he had made the condition of his
	believing, seems plain from  :- ("Because thou hast seen Me, thou hast
	believed"). He is overpowered, and the glory of Christ now
	breaks upon him in a flood. His exclamation surpasses all that had
	been yet uttered, nor can it be surpassed by anything that ever will
	be uttered in earth or heaven. On the striking parallel in Nathanael,
	see on John 1:49. The Socinian
	invasion of the supreme divinity of Christ here manifestly taught—as
	if it were a mere call upon God in a fit of astonishment—is beneath
	notice, save for the profanity it charges upon this disciple, and the
	straits to which it shows themselves reduced.
