 CHAPTER 21 
	
 :-. SUPPLEMENTARY
	PARTICULARS. 
	(That this chapter was added by
	another hand has been asserted, against clear evidence to the
	contrary, by some late critics, chiefly because the Evangelist had
	concluded his part of the work with John 20:30;
	John 20:31. But neither in the
	Epistles of the New Testament, nor in other good authors, is it
	unusual to insert supplementary matter, and so have more than one
	conclusion).
