18, 19. When thou wast
	young—embracing the whole period of life to the verge of old
	age. 
	thou girdedst thyself, and
	walkedst whither thou wouldest—wast thine own master. 
	when . . . old thou shalt
	stretch forth thine hands—to be bound for execution, though not
	necessarily meaning on a cross. There is no reason, however,
	to doubt the very early tradition that Peter's death was by
	crucifixion.
