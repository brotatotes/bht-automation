26. Rabbi, &c.â€”"Master,
	this man tells us that He to whom thou barest such generous witness
	beyond Jordan is requiting thy generosity by drawing all the people
	away to Himself. At this rate, thou shalt soon have no disciples at
	all." The reply to this is one of the noblest and most affecting
	utterances that ever came from the lips of man.
