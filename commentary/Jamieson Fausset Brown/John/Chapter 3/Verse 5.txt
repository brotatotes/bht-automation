5. of water and of the Spiritâ€”A
	twofold explanation of the "new birth," so startling to
	Nicodemus. To a Jewish ecclesiastic, so familiar with the symbolical
	application of water, in every variety of way and form of expression,
	this language was fitted to show that the thing intended was no other
	than a thorough spiritual purification by the operation of the
	Holy Ghost. Indeed, element of water and operation of the
	Spirit are brought together in a glorious evangelical prediction
	of Ezekiel ( :-), which Nicodemus might have been reminded of had such
	spiritualities not been almost lost in the reigning formalism.
	Already had the symbol of water been embodied in an initiatory
	ordinance, in the baptism of the Jewish expectants of Messiah by the
	Baptist, not to speak of the baptism of Gentile proselytes before
	that; and in the Christian Church it was soon to become the great
	visible door of entrance into "the kingdom of God," the
	reality being the sole work of the Holy Ghost ( :-).
