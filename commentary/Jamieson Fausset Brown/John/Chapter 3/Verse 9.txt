9, 10. How, &c.â€”Though the
	subject still confounds Nicodemus, the necessity and possibility of
	the new birth is no longer the point with him, but the nature of it
	and how it is brought about [LUTHARDT].
	"From this moment Nicodemus says nothing more, but has
	sunk unto a disciple who has found his true teacher. Therefore
	the Saviour now graciously advances in His communications of truth,
	and once more solemnly brings to the mind of this teacher in Israel,
	now become a learner, his own not guiltless ignorance, that He
	may then proceed to utter, out of the fulness of His divine
	knowledge, such farther testimonies both of earthly and heavenly
	things as his docile scholar may to his own profit receive"
