34. My meat is, c.—"A
	Servant here to fulfil a prescribed work, to do and to finish,
	that is 'meat' to Me and of this, while you were away, I have had My
	fill." And of what does He speak thus? Of the condescension,
	pity, patience, wisdom He had been laying out upon one soul—a
	very humble woman, and in some respects repulsive too! But He had
	gained her, and through her was going to gain more, and lay perhaps
	the foundations of a great work in the country of Samaria; and this
	filled His whole soul and raised Him above the sense of natural
	hunger (Matthew 4:4).
