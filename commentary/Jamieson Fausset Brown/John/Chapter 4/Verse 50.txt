	effects instantaneously followed:—"The man believed the word,"
	and the cure, shooting quicker than lightning from Cana to Capernaum,
	was felt by the dying youth. In token of faith, the father takes his
	leave of Christ—in the circumstances this evidenced full faith. The
	servants hasten to convey the joyful tidings to the anxious parents,
	whose faith now only wants one confirmation. "When began
	he to amend? . . . Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left
	him"—the very hour in which was uttered that great word, "Thy
	son liveth!" So "himself believed and his whole house."
	He had believed before this, first very imperfectly; then with
	assured confidence of Christ's word; but now with a faith crowned by
	"sight." And the wave rolled from the head to the members
	of his household. "To-day is salvation come to this house"
	(Luke 19:9); and no mean house
	this! 
	second miracle Jesus did—that
	is, in Cana; done "after He came out of Judea," as the
	former before.
