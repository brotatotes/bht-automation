21-23. raiseth the dead and
	quickeneth them —one act in two stages.
	This is His absolute prerogative as God. 
	so the Son quickeneth
	them—that is, raiseth up and quickeneth. 
	whom he will—not only
	doing the same divine act, but doing it as the result of
	His own will, even as the Father does it. This statement is of
	immense importance in relation to the miracles of Christ,
	distinguishing them from similar miracles of prophets and apostles,
	who as human instruments were employed to perform
	super-natural actions, while Christ did all as the Father's
	commissioned Servant indeed, but in the exercise of His own
	absolute right of action.
