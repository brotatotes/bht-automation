29. resurrection of life—that
	is, to life everlasting ( :-). 
	of damnation—It would
	have been harsh to say "the resurrection of death," though
	that is meant, for sinners rise from death to death [BENGEL].
	The resurrection of both classes is an exercise of sovereign
	authority; but in the one case it is an act of grace, in
	the other of justice. (Compare  :-, from which the language is taken). How awfully grand are
	these unfoldings of His dignity and authority from the mouth of
	Christ Himself! And they are all in the third person; in what
	follows He resumes the first person.
