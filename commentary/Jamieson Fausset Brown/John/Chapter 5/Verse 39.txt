39-42. Search the scriptures,
	c.—"In the Scriptures ye find your charter of eternal life go
	search them then, and you will find that I am the Great Burden of
	their testimony; yet ye will not come to Me for that life eternal
	which you profess to find there, and of which they tell you I am the
	appointed Dispenser." (Compare Acts 17:11;
	Acts 17:12). How touching and
	gracious are these last words! Observe here (1) The honor which
	Christ gives to the Scriptures, as a record which all have a right
	and are bound to search—the reverse of which the Church of
	Rome teaches; (2) The opposite extreme is, resting in the mere Book
	without the living Christ, to direct the soul to whom is its
	main use and chiefest glory.
