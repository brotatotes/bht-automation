	Job (Job 9:8) celebrates as the
	distinguishing prerogative of GOD,
	"WHO ALONE spreadeth

	tempestuous sky, and not dreaming that it could be their Lord—they
	take it for a spirit. (How often thus we miscall our chiefest
	mercies—not only thinking them distant when they are near, but
	thinking the best the worst!)
