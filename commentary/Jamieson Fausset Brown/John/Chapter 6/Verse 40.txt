40. And this—in the second
	place. 
	is the will of Him that sent
	Me, that every one which seeth the Son and believeth on Him—seeing
	the Son believeth on Him. 
	may have everlasting life,
	and I will raise him up at the last day—This is the human
	side of the same thing as in the foregoing verse, and answering to
	"Him that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out";
	that is, I have it expressly in charge that everyone that so
	"beholdeth" (so vieweth) the Son as to believe on Him shall
	have everlasting life; and, that none of Him be lost, "I
	will raise him up at the last day." (See on  :-).
