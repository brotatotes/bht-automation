49. Your fathers—of whom ye
	spake (John 6:31); not "ours,"
	by which He would hint that He had a higher descent, of which
	they dreamt not [BENGEL]. 
	did eat manna . . . and are
	dead—recurring to their own point about the manna, as one of
	the noblest of the ordained preparatory illustrations of His
	own office: "Your fathers, ye say, ate manna in the wilderness;
	and ye say well, for so they did, but they are dead—even
	they whose carcasses fell in the wilderness did eat of that bread;
	the Bread whereof I speak cometh down from heaven, which the manna
	never did, that men, eating of it, may live for ever."
