63. the flesh profiteth nothing—Much
	of His discourse was about "flesh"; but flesh as
	such, mere flesh, could profit nothing, much less impart that life
	which the Holy Spirit alone communicates to the soul. 
	the words that I speak . . .
	are spirit and . . . life—The whole burden of the discourse is
	"spirit," not mere flesh, and "life"
	in its highest, not its lowest sense, and the words I have employed
	are to be interpreted solely in that sense.
