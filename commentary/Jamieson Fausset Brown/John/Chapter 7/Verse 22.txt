22. Moses . . . gave unto you
	circumcision, &c.—Though servile work was forbidden on the
	sabbath, the circumcision of males on that day (which certainly was a
	servile work) was counted no infringement of the Law. How much less
	ought fault to be found with One who had made a man "every whit
	whole"—or rather, "a man's entire body whole"—on
	the sabbath-day? What a testimony to the reality of the miracle, none
	daring to meet the bold appeal.
