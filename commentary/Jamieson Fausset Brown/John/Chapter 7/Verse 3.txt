3-5. His brethren said—(See on
	 :-). 
	Depart . . . into Judea,
	c.—In John 7:5 this speech is
	ascribed to their unbelief. But as they were in the "upper
	room" among the one hundred and twenty disciples who waited for
	the descent of the Spirit after the Lord's ascension (John 7:5- :), they seem to have had their prejudices removed, perhaps
	after His resurrection. Indeed here their language is more that of
	strong prejudice and suspicion (such as near relatives, even the
	best, too frequently show in such cases), than from unbelief.
	There was also, probably, a tincture of vanity in it. "Thou
	hast many disciples in Judea here in Galilee they are fast dropping
	off; it is not like one who advances the claims Thou dost to linger
	so long here, away from the city of our solemnities, where surely
	'the kingdom of our father David' is to be set up: 'seeking,' as Thou
	dost, 'to be known openly,' those miracles of Thine ought not to be
	confined to this distant corner, but submitted at headquarters to the
	inspection of 'the world.'" (See John 7:5- :, "I am become a stranger to my brethren, an
	alien unto my mother's children!")
