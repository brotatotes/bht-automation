12. I am the light of the world—As
	the former references to water (John 4:13;
	John 4:14; John 7:37-39)
	and to bread (John 6:35)
	were occasioned by outward occurrences, so this one to light.
	In "the treasury" where it was spoken (see on John 6:35- :) stood two colossal golden lamp-stands, on which hung a
	multitude of lamps, lighted after the evening sacrifice (probably
	every evening during the feast of tabernacles), diffusing their
	brilliancy, it is said, over all the city. Around these the people
	danced with great rejoicing. Now, as amidst the festivities of the
	water from Siloam Jesus cried, saying, "If any man
	thirst, let him come unto me and drink," so now amidst the blaze
	and the joyousness of this illumination, He proclaims, "I AM
	THE LIGHT OF THE
	WORLD"—plainly in the most absolute sense. For
	though He gives His disciples the same title, they are only "light
	in the Lord" (Ephesians 5:8);
	and though He calls the Baptist "the burning and shining light"
	(or "lamp" of his day, Ephesians 5:8- :), yet "he was not that Light, but was sent to
	bear witness of that Light: that was THE
	TRUE LIGHT which,
	coming into the world, lighteth every man" (John 1:8;
	John 1:9). Under this magnificent
	title Messiah was promised of old (Isaiah 42:6;
	Malachi 4:2, &c.). 
	he that followeth me—as
	one does a light going before him, and as the Israelites did the
	pillar of bright cloud in the wilderness. 
	but shall have the light of
	life—the light, as of a new world, a newly awakened spiritual
	and eternal life.
