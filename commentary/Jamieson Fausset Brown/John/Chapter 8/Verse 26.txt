26, 27. I have many things to say
	and to judge of you; but he that sent me is true, &c.â€”that
	is, I could, and at the fitting time, will say and judge many things
	of you (referring perhaps to the work of the Spirit which is for
	judgment as well as salvation,  :-), but what I do say is just the message My Father hath given
	Me to deliver.
