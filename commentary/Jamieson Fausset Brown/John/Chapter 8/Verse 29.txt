29. the Father hath not left me
	alone; for I do always those things that please him, c.â€”that
	is, To you, who gnash upon Me with your teeth, and frown down all
	open appearance for Me, I seem to stand uncountenanced and alone but
	I have a sympathy and support transcending all human applause; I came
	hither to do My Father's will, and in the doing of it have not ceased
	to please Him; therefore is He ever by Me with His approving smile,
	His cheering words, His supporting arm.
