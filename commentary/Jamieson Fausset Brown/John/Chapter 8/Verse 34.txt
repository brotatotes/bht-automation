34, 35. Whosoever committeth
	sin—that is, liveth in the commission of it—(Compare
	1 John 3:8; Matthew 7:23).
	is the servant of sin—that
	is, the bond-servant, or slave of it; for the question
	is not about free service, but who are in bondage. (Compare
	2 Peter 2:19; Revelation 6:16).
	The great truth here expressed was not unknown to heathen moralists;
	but it was applied only to vice, for they were total strangers to
	what in revealed religion is called sin. The thought of slaves
	and freemen in the house suggests to our Lord a wider idea.
