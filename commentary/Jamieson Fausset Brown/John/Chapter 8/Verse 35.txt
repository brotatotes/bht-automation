35. And the servant abideth not in
	the house for ever, but the Son abideth everâ€”that is, "And
	if your connection with the family of God be that of BOND-SERVANTS,
	ye have no natural tie to the house; your tie is essentially
	uncertain and precarious. But the SON'S
	relationship to the FATHER
	is a natural and essential one; it is an indefeasible tie; His
	abode in it is perpetual and of right: That is My
	relationship, My tie: If, then, ye would have your connection with
	God's family made real, rightful, permanent, ye must by the
	Son be manumitted and adopted as sons and daughters of
	the Lord Almighty." In this sublime statement there is no doubt
	a subordinate allusion to  :-, "Cast out this bondwoman and her son,
	for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son,
	with Isaac." (Compare  :-).
