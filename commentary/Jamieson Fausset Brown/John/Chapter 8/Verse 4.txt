	Moses . . . commanded . . . should be stoned—simply put to
	death (Deuteronomy 22:22), but in
	aggravated cases, at least in later times, this was probably by

	Stone her, that would seem a stepping out of His province; if He
	forbade it, that would hold Him up as a relaxer of the public morals.
	But these cunning hypocrites were overmatched.
