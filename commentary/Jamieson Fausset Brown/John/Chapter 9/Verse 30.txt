30. The man answered, Herein is a
	marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath
	opened mine eyes—He had no need to say another word; but waxing
	bolder in defense of his Benefactor, and his views brightening by the
	very courage which it demanded, he puts it to them how they could
	pretend inability to tell whether one who opened the eyes of a man
	born blind was "of God" or "a sinner"—from
	above or from beneath—and proceeds to argue the case with
	remarkable power. So irresistible was his argument that their rage
	burst forth in a speech of intense Pharisaism, "Thou wast
	altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us?"—thou,
	a base-born, uneducated, impudent youth, teach us, the
	trained, constituted, recognized guides of the people in the things
	of God! Out upon thee!
