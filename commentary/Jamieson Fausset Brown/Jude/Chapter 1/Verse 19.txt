These
	be they
	— showing that their characters are such as Peter and Paul had
	foretold.separate
	themselves
	— from Church communion in its vital, spiritual reality: for
	outwardly they took part in Church ordinances ( :-).
	Some oldest manuscripts omit “themselves”: then understand it,
	“separate,” cast out members of the Church by excommunication
	( :-;
	 :-;
	 :-;
	 :-;
	compare “casteth them out of the Church;”  :-).
	Many, however, understand “themselves,” which indeed is read in
	some of the oldest manuscripts as English
	Version
	has it. Arrogant setting up of themselves, as having greater sanctity
	and a wisdom and peculiar doctrine, distinct from others, is implied.sensual
	— literally, “animal-souled”: as opposed to the spiritual,
	or “having the Spirit.” It is translated, “the natural
	man,”  :-.
	In the threefold division of man’s being, body,
	soul, and spirit,
	the due state in God’s design is, that “the spirit,” which is
	the recipient of the Holy Spirit uniting man to God, should be first,
	and should rule the soul, which stands intermediate between the
	body
	and spirit:
	but in the animal,
	or natural
	man, the spirit is sunk into subserviency to the animal soul, which
	is earthly in its motives and aims. The “carnal” sink somewhat
	lower, for in these the
	flesh,
	the lowest element and corrupt side of man’s bodily nature, reigns
	paramount.having
	not the Spirit
	— In the animal and natural man the
	spirit,
	his higher part, which ought to be the receiver of the Holy Spirit,
	is not so; and therefore, his spirit not being in its normal state,
	he is said not
	to have the spirit
	(compare  :-,
	 :-).
	In the completion of redemption the parts of redeemed man shall be
	placed in their due relation: whereas in the ungodly, the
	soul
	severed from the
	spirit
	shall have for ever animal life without union to God and heaven - a
	living death.
