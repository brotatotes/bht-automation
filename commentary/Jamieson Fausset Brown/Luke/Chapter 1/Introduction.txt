 CHAPTER 1 
	
 :-. 
	It appears from the Acts of the
	Apostles, and the Apostolic Epistles, that the earliest preaching of
	the Gospel consisted of a brief summary of the facts of our Lord's
	earthly history, with a few words of pointed application to the
	parties addressed. Of these astonishing facts, notes would naturally
	be taken and digests put into circulation. It is to such that
	Luke here refers; and in terms of studied respect, as narratives of
	what was "believed surely," or "on sure grounds"
	among Christians, and drawn up from the testimony of "eye-witnesses
	and ministering servants of the word." But when he adds that "it
	seemed good to him also to write in order, having traced down all
	things with exactness from their first rise," it is a virtual
	claim for his own Gospel to supersede these "many"
	narratives. Accordingly, while not one of them has survived the wreck
	of time, this and the other canonical Gospels live, and shall live,
	the only fitting vehicles of those life-bringing facts which have
	made all things new. Apocryphal or spurious gospels, upheld by
	parties unfriendly to the truths exhibited in the canonical Gospels,
	have not perished; but those well-meant and substantially
	correct narratives here referred to, used only while better were not
	to be had, were by tacit consent allowed to merge in the four
	peerless documents which from age to age, and with astonishing
	unanimity, have been accepted as the written charter of all
	Christianity.
