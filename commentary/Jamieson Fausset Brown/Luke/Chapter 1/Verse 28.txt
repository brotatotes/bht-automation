28. highly favouredâ€”a word
	only once used elsewhere (Ephesians 1:6,
	"made accepted"): compare Ephesians 1:6- :, "Thou hast found favour with God." The mistake of
	the Vulgate's rendering, "full of grace," has been
	taken abundant advantage of by the Romish Church. As the mother of
	our Lord, she was the most "blessed among women" in
	external distinction; but let them listen to the Lord's own words.
	"Nay, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep
	it." (See on Luke 1:1).
