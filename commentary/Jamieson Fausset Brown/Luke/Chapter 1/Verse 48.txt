46-55. A magnificent canticle,
	in which the strain of Hannah's ancient song, in like circumstances,
	is caught up, and just slightly modified and sublimed. Is it
	unnatural to suppose that the spirit of the blessed Virgin had been
	drawn beforehand into mysterious sympathy with the ideas and the tone
	of this hymn, so that when the life and fire of inspiration
	penetrated her whole soul it spontaneously swept the chorus of this
	song, enriching the Hymnal of the Church with that spirit-stirring
	canticle which has resounded ever since from its temple walls? In
	both songs, those holy women, filled with wonder to behold "the
	proud, the mighty, the rich," passed by, and, in their persons
	the lowliest chosen to usher in the greatest events, sing of this as
	no capricious movement, but a great law of the kingdom of God,
	by which He delights to "put down the mighty from their seats
	and exalt them of low degree." In both songs the strain dies
	away on CHRIST; in
	Hannah's under the name of "Jehovah's King"—to whom,
	through all His line, from David onwards to Himself, He will "give
	strength"; His "Anointed," whose horn He will exalt
	(1 Samuel 2:10); in the Virgin's
	song, it is as the "Help" promised to Israel by all the
	prophets. 
	My soul . . . my spirit—"all
	that is within me" (1 Samuel 2:10- :).
