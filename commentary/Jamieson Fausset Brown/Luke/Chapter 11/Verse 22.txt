22. a stronger than he—Christ:
	Glorious title, in relation to Satan! 
	come upon him and overcome
	him—sublimely expressing the Redeemer's approach, as the Seed
	of the woman, to bruise the Serpent's head. 
	taketh from him all his
	armour—"his panoply," "his complete armor."
	Vain would be the victory, were not the means of regaining his
	lost power wrested from him. It is this that completes the triumph
	and ensures the final overthrow of his kingdom. The parable that
	immediately follows ( :-) is just the reverse of this. (See on  :-.) In the one case, Satan is dislodged by Christ,
	and so finds, in all future assaults, the house preoccupied;
	in the other, he merely goes out and comes in again, finding the
	house "EMPTY"
	(Matthew 12:44) of any rival, and
	all ready to welcome him back. This explains the important saying
	that comes in between the two parables (Matthew 12:44- :). Neutrality in religion there is none. The absence
	of positive attachment to Christ involves hostility to Him.
