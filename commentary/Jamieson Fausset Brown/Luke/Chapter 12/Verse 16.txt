	&c.â€”Why is this man called a "fool?" ( :-) (1) Because he deemed a life of secure and abundant
	earthly enjoyment the summit of human felicity. (2) Because,
	possessing the means of this, through prosperity in his calling, he
	flattered himself that he had a long lease of such enjoyment, and
	nothing to do but give himself up to it. Nothing else is laid to his
	charge.
