	excuseâ€”(Compare Matthew 22:5).
	Three excuses, given as specimens of the rest, answer to "the
	care of this world" (Matthew 22:5- :), "the deceitfulness of riches" (Matthew 22:5- :), and "the pleasures of this life" (Matthew 22:5- :), which "choke the word" (Matthew 13:22;
	Luke 8:14). Each differs from the
	other, and each has its own plausibility, but all come to the same
	result: "We have other things to attend to, more pressing
	just now." Nobody is represented as saying, I will not
	come; nay, all the answers imply that but for certain things
	they would come, and when these are out of the way they will
	come. So it certainly is in the case intended, for the last words
	clearly imply that the refusers will one day become
	petitioners.
