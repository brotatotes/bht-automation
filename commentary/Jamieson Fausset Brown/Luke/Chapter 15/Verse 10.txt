10. Likewise—on the same
	principle. 
	joy, c.—Note carefully
	the language here—not "joy on the part," but "joy
	in the presence of the angels of God." True to the idea
	of the parables. The Great Shepherd. The Great Owner Himself, is He
	whose the joy properly is over His own recovered property but
	so vast and exuberant is it ( :-), that as if He could not keep it to Himself, He "calleth
	His friends and neighbors together"—His whole celestial
	family—saying, "Rejoice WITH
	ME, for I have found My
	sheep-My-piece," c. In this sublime sense it is "joy,"
	before "or in the presence of the angels"
	they only "catch the flying joy," sharing it with Him!
	The application of this to the reception of those publicans and
	sinners that stood around our Lord is grand in the extreme: "Ye
	turn from these lost ones with disdain, and because I do not the
	same, ye murmur at it: but a very different feeling is cherished in
	heaven. There, the recovery of even one such outcast is watched with
	interest and hailed with joy; nor are they left to come home of
	themselves or perish; for lo! even now the great Shepherd is going
	after His lost sheep, and the Owner is making diligent search for the
	lost property; and He is finding it, too, and bringing it back with
	joy, and all heaven is full of it." (Let the reader mark what
	sublime claims Himself our Lord covertly puts in here—as if in Him
	they beheld, all unknown to themselves, nothing less than heaven in
	the habiliments of earth, the Great Shepherd above, clothed in a
	garment of flesh, come "to seek and to save that which was
	lost")!
