18. I will arise and go to my FATHER
—The change has come at last, and what a change!—couched in
	terms of such exquisite simplicity and power as if expressly framed
	for all heart-broken penitents. 
	Father, c.—Mark the
	term. Though "no more worthy to be called his son,"
	the prodigal sinner is taught to claim the defiled, but still
	existing relationship, asking not to be made a servant, but
	remaining a son to be made "as a servant,"
	willing to take the lowest place and do the meanest work. Ah! and is
	it come to this? Once it was, "Any place rather than home."
	Now, "Oh, that home! Could I but dare to hope that the door of
	it would not be closed against me, how gladly would I take any place
	and do any worK, happy only to be there at all." Well, that
	is conversion—nothing absolutely new, yet all new old familiar
	things seen in a new light and for the first time as realities of
	overwhelming magnitude and power. How this is brought about the
	parable says not. (We have that abundantly elsewhere,  :-, &c.). Its one object is to paint the welcome home
	of the greatest sinners, when (no matter for the present how)
	they "arise and go to their Father."
