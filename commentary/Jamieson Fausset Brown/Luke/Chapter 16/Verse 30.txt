	but if one went unto them
	from the dead, they will repent—a principle of awful magnitude
	and importance. The greatest miracle will have no effect on those who
	are determined not to believe. A real Lazarus soon "rose
	from the dead," but the sight of him by crowds of people,
	inclined thereby to Christ, only crowned the unbelief and hastened
	the murderous plots of the Pharisees against the Lord of glory; nor
	has His own resurrection, far more overpowering, yet won over that
	"crooked and perverse nation."
