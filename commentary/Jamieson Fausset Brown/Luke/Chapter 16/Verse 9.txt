	to your advantage; that is, as the steward did, "by showing

	they may receive you—not
	generally, "ye may be received" (as Luke 14:14- :, "shall men give"), but "those ye have

	Then, like the steward, when turned out of one home shall ye secure
	another; but better than he, a heavenly for an earthly, an
	everlasting for a temporary habitation. Money is not here made the
	key to heaven, more than "the deeds done in the body" in
	general, according to which, as a test of character—but not by the
	merit of which—men are to be judged (Luke 14:14- :, and see Luke 14:14- :).
