24. as lightning . . . so . . . the
	Son of manâ€”that is it will be as manifest. The Lord speaks here
	of His coming and manifestation in a prophetically indefinite manner,
	and in these preparatory words blends into one the distinctive
	epochs [STIER]. When
	the whole polity of the Jews, civil and ecclesiastical alike, was
	broken up at once, and its continuance rendered impossible by the
	destruction of Jerusalem, it became as manifest to all as the
	lightning of heaven that the kingdom of God had ceased to exist in
	its old, and had entered on a new and perfectly different form. So it
	may be again, ere its final and greatest change at the personal
	coming of Christ, and of which the words in their highest sense are
	alone true.
