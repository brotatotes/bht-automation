11, 12. stood—as the Jews in
	prayer (Mark 11:25). 
	God, c.—To have been
	kept from gross iniquities was undoubtedly a just cause of
	thankfulness to God but instead of the devoutly humble, admiring
	frame which this should inspire, the Pharisee arrogantly severs
	himself from the rest of mankind, as quite above them, and, with a
	contemptuous look at the poor publican, thanks God that he has not to
	stand afar off like him, to hang down his head like a bulrush and
	beat his breast like him. But these are only his moral
	excellencies. His religious merits complete his grounds for
	congratulation. Not confining himself to the one divinely prescribed
	annual fast (Leviticus 16:29), he was
	not behind the most rigid, who fasted on the second and fifth days of
	every week [LIGHTFOOT],
	and gave the tenth not only of what the law laid under tithing, but
	of "all his gains." Thus, besides doing all his duty,
	he did works of supererogation; while sins to confess and
	spiritual wants to be supplied he seems to have felt none. What a
	picture of the Pharisaic character and religion!
