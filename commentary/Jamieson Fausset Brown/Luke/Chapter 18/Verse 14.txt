	meaning is, "and not the other"; for the Pharisee was not
	seeking justification, and felt no need of it. This great law of the
	Kingdom of God is, in the teaching of Christ, inscribed, as in
	letters of gold, over its entrance gate. And in how many different
	forms is it repeated (Psalms 138:6;
	Psalms 147:6; Luke 1:53).
	To be self-emptied, or, "poor in spirit," is the
	fundamental and indispensable preparation for the reception of the
	"grace which bringeth salvation": wherever this exists, the
	"mourning" for it which precedes "comfort" and
	the earnest "hungerings and thirstings after righteousness"
	which are rewarded by the "fulness" of it, will, as we see
	here, be surely found. Such, therefore, and such only, are the
	justified ones (Job 33:27;
	Job 33:28; Psalms 34:18;
	Isaiah 57:15).
