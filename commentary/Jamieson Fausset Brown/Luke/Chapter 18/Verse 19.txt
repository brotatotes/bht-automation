19. Why, c.—Did our Lord mean
	then to teach that God only ought to be called "good?"
	Impossible, for that had been to contradict all Scripture teaching,
	and His own, too (Psalms 112:5
Matthew 25:21; Titus 1:8).
	Unless therefore we are to ascribe captiousness to our Lord, He could
	have had but one object—to raise the youth's ideas of Himself,
	as not to be classed merely with other "good masters," and
	declining to receive this title apart from the "One"
	who is essentially and only "good." This indeed is but
	distantly hinted; but unless this is seen in the background of
	our Lord's words, nothing worthy of Him can be made out of them.
	(Hence, Socinianism, instead of having any support here, is
	only baffled by it).
