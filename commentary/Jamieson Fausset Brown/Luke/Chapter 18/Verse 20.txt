20. Thou knowest, c.—Matthew
	(Matthew 19:17) is more complete
	here: "but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
	He saith unto him, Which—as if he had said, Point me out one of
	them which I have not kept?—"Jesus said, Thou shalt," &c.
	(Matthew 19:17 Matthew 19:18).
	Our Lord purposely confines Himself to the second table, which
	He would consider easy to keep, enumerating them all—for in Mark
	(Mark 10:19), "Defraud not"
	stands for the tenth (else the eighth is twice repeated). In
	Matthew (Matthew 19:19) the sum
	of this second table of the law is added, "Thou shalt love thy
	neighbor as thyself," as if to see if he would venture to say he
	had kept that.
