22. lackest . . . one thing—Ah!
	but that a fundamental, fatal lack. 
	sell, &c.—As riches
	were his idol, our Lord, who knew if from the first, lays His great
	authoritative grasp at once upon it, saying, "Now give Me up
	that, and all is right." No general direction about the disposal
	of riches, then, is here given, save that we are to sit loose to them
	and lay them at the feet of Him who gave them. He who does this with
	all he has, whether rich or poor, is a true heir of the kingdom of
	heaven.
