23-25. was very sorrowful—Matthew
	(Matthew 19:22) more fully, "went
	away sorrowful"; Mark still more, "was sad" or
	"sullen" at that saying, and "went away grieved."
	Sorry he was, very sorry, to part with Christ; but to part with his
	riches would have cost him a pang more. When Riches or Heaven, on
	Christ's terms, were the alternative, the result showed to which side
	the balance inclined. Thus was he shown to lack the one
	all-comprehensive requirement of the law—the absolute subjection
	of the heart to God, and this want vitiated all his other
	obediences.
