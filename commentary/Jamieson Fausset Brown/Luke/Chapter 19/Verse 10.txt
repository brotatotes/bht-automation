	 :-. PARABLE OF THE
	POUNDS. 
	A different parable from that of
	the Talents ( :-). For, (1) This parable was spoken "when He was
	nigh to Jerusalem" ( :-); that one, some days after entering it, and from the Mount
	of Olives. (2) This parable was spoken to the promiscuous crowd;
	that, to the Twelve alone. Accordingly, (3) Besides the "servants"
	in this parable, who profess subjection to Him, there is a class of
	"citizens" who refuse to own Him, and who are treated
	differently, whereas in the parable of the talents, spoken to the
	former class alone, this latter class is omitted. (4) In the
	Talents, each servant receives a different number of them (five, two,
	one); in the Pounds all receive the same one pound, which is but
	about the sixtieth part of a talent; also, in the talents, each shows
	the same fidelity by doubling what he received (the five are made
	ten; the two, four); in the Pounds, each receiving the same, render a
	different return (one making his pound ten, another five).
	Plainly, therefore, the intended lesson is different; the one
	illustrating equal fidelity with different degrees of advantage;
	the other, different degrees of improvement of the same
	opportunities; yet with all this difference, the parables are
	remarkably similar.
