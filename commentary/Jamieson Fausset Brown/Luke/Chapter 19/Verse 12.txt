12. a far country—said to put
	down the notion that He was just on His way to set up His kingdom,
	and to inaugurate it by His personal presence. 
	to receive . . . a kingdom—be
	invested with royalty; as when Herod went to Rome and was there made
	king; a striking expression of what our Lord went away for and
	received, "sitting down at the right hand of the Majesty on
	high." 
	to return—at His second
	coming.
