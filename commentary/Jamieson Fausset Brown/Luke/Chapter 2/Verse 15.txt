	simplicity of devoutness and faith this! They are not taken up with
	the angels, the glory that invested them, and the lofty strains with
	which they filled the air. Nor do they say, Let us go and see if
	this be true—they have no misgivings. But "Let us go and
	see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath
	made known unto us." Does not this confirm the view given on
	Luke 2:8 of the spirit of these
	humble men?
