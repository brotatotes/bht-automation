2. first . . . when Cyrenius,
	c.—a very perplexing verse, inasmuch as Cyrenius, or Quirinus,
	appears not to have been governor of Syria for about ten years after
	the birth of Christ, and the "taxing" under his
	administration was what led to the insurrection mentioned in  :-. That there was a taxing, however, of the whole Roman Empire
	under Augustus, is now admitted by all and candid critics, even of
	skeptical tendency, are ready to allow that there is not likely to be
	any real inaccuracy in the statement of our Evangelist. Many superior
	scholars would render the words thus, "This registration was
	previous to Cyrenius being governor of Syria"—as the
	word "first" is rendered in John 1:15;
	John 15:18. In this case, of
	course, the difficulty vanishes. But it is perhaps better to suppose,
	with others, that the registration may have been ordered with a view
	to the taxation, about the time of our Lord's birth, though the
	taxing itself—an obnoxious measure in Palestine—was not carried
	out till the time of Quirinus.
