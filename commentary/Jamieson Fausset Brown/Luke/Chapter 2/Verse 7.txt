	a manger—the manger,
	the bench to which the horses' heads were tied, on which their food
	could rest [WEBSTER and

	no room in the inn—a
	square erection, open inside, where travellers put up, and whose rear

	ere they arrived, the inn would be fully occupied—affecting
	anticipation of the reception He was throughout to meet with (2 Corinthians 8:9- :). 
	 Wrapt in His
	swaddling—bands,
