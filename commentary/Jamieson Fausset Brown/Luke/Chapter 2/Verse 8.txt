8. abiding in the fields—staying
	there, probably in huts or tents. 
	watch . . . by night—or,
	night watches, taking their turn of watching. From about passover
	time in April until autumn, the flocks pastured constantly in the
	open fields, the shepherds lodging there all that time. (From this it
	seems plain that the period of the year usually assigned to our
	Lord's birth is too late). Were these shepherds chosen to have the
	first sight of the blessed Babe without any respect of their own
	state of mind? That, at least, is not God's way. "No doubt, like
	Simeon (Luke 2:25), they were
	among the waiters for the Consolation of Israel" [OLSHAUSEN];
	and, if the simplicity of their rustic minds, their quiet occupation,
	the stillness of the midnight hours, and the amplitude of the deep
	blue vault above them for the heavenly music which was to fill their
	ear, pointed them out as fit recipients for the first tidings of an
	Infant Saviour, the congenial meditations and conversations by which,
	we may suppose, they would beguile the tedious hours would perfect
	their preparation for the unexpected visit. Thus was Nathanael
	engaged, all alone but not unseen, under the fig tree, in unconscious
	preparation for his first interview with Jesus. (See on Luke 2:25- :). So was the rapt seer on his lonely rock "in the
	spirit on the Lord's Day," little thinking that this was his
	preparation for hearing behind him the trumpet voice of the Son of
	man (Revelation 1:10, &c.). But if
	the shepherds in His immediate neighborhood had the first, the
	sages from afar had the next sight of the new-born King. Even
	so still, simplicity first, science next, finds its way to Christ,
	whom 
	 In quiet
	ever and in shade 
	 Shepherds
	and Sage may find— 
	 They, who have bowed
	untaught to Nature's sway, 
	 And they, who follow
	Truth along her star-pav'd way.
