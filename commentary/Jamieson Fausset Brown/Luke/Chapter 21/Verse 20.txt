20, 21. by armies—encamped
	armies, that is, besieged: "the abomination of desolation"
	(meaning the Roman ensigns, as the symbols of an idolatrous, pagan,
	unclean power) "spoken of by Daniel the prophet" ( :-) "standing where it ought not" ( :-). "Whoso readeth [that prophecy] let him understand"
	(Matthew 24:15). 
	Then . . . flee,
	c.—EUSEBIUS says the
	Christians fled to Pella, at the north extremity of Perea,
	being "prophetically directed" perhaps by some prophetic
	intimation still more explicit than this, which still would be their
	chart.
