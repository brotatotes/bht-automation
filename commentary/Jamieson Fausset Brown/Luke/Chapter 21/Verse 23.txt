	and on the sabbath," which they were to "pray" against
	(Matthew 24:20), the one as more
	trying to the body, the other to the soul. "For then shall be
	tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world, nor
	ever shall be"—language not unusual in the Old Testament for
	tremendous calamities, though of this it may perhaps be literally
	said, "And except those days should be shortened, there should
	no flesh be saved, but for the elect's sake those days shall be
	shortened" (Matthew 24:21;
	Matthew 24:22). But for this merciful
	"shortening," brought about by a remarkable concurrence of
	causes, the whole nation would have perished, in which there yet
	remained a remnant to be afterwards gathered out. Here in Matthew and
	Mark (Matthew 24:24; Mark 13:22)
	are some particulars about "false Christs," who should, "if
	possible"—a precious clause—"deceive the very
	elect." (Compare 2 Thessalonians 2:9-11;
	Revelation 13:13.)
