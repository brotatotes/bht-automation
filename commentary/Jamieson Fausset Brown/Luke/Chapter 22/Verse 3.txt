3. Then entered Satan, c.—but
	not yet in the full sense. The awful stages of it were these: (1)
	Covetousness being his master—passion, the Lord let it
	reveal itself and gather strength by entrusting him with "the
	bag" (John 12:6), as
	treasurer to Himself and the Twelve. (2) In the discharge of that
	most sacred trust he became "a thief," appropriating its
	contents from time to time to his own use. Satan, seeing this door
	into his heart standing wide open, determines to enter by it, but
	cautiously (2 Corinthians 2:11) first
	merely "putting it into his heart to betray Him"
	(John 13:2), suggesting the
	thought to him that by this means he might enrich himself. (3) This
	thought was probably converted into a settled purpose by what took
	place in Simon's house at Bethany. (See John 13:2- :, and see on John 13:2- :.)
	(4) Starting back, perhaps, or mercifully held back, for some time,
	the determination to carry it into immediate effect was not
	consummated till, sitting at the paschal supper, "Satan
	entered into him" (see on John 13:2- :), and conscience, effectually stifled, only rose again to
	be his tormentor. What lessons in all this for every one (Ephesians 4:27;
	James 4:7; 1 Peter 5:8;
	1 Peter 5:9)!
