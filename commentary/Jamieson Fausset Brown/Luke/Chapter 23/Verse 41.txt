41. we . . . justly, c.—He
	owns the worst of his crimes and deserts, and would fain shame his
	fellow into the same. 
	nothing amiss—literally,
	"out of place" hence "unnatural"; a striking term
	here. Our Lord was not charged with ordinary crime, but only
	with laying claim to office and honors which amounted to blasphemy.
	The charge of treason had not even a show of truth, as Pilate told
	His enemies. In this defense then there seems more than meets the
	eye. "He made Himself the promised Messiah, the Son of God; but
	in this He 'did nothing amiss'; He ate with publicans and sinners,
	and bade all the weary and heavy laden come and rest under His wing;
	but in this He 'did nothing amiss': He claimed to be Lord of the
	Kingdom of God, to shut it at will, but also to open it at pleasure
	even to such as we are; but in this He 'did nothing amiss!'"
	Does His next speech imply less than this? Observe: (1) His
	frank confession and genuine self-condemnation. (2) His astonishment
	and horror at the very different state of his fellow's mind. (3) His
	anxiety to bring him to a better mind while yet there was hope. (4)
	His noble testimony, not only to the innocence of Jesus, but to all
	that this implied of the rightfulness of His claims.
