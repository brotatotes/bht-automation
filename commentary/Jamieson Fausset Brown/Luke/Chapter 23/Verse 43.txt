43. Jesus said, c.—The dying
	Redeemer speaks as if He Himself viewed it in this light. It was a
	"song in the night." It ministered cheer to His spirit in
	the midnight gloom that now enwrapt it. 
	Verily I say unto thee—"Since
	thou speakest as to the king, with kingly authority speak I to thee."
	To-day—"Thou art
	prepared for a long delay before I come into My kingdom, but not a
	day's delay shall there be for thee thou shalt not be parted from Me
	even for a moment, but together we shall go, and with Me, ere this
	day expire, shalt thou be in Paradise" (future bliss, 2 Corinthians 12:4;
	Revelation 2:7). Learn (1) How "One
	is taken and another left"; (2) How easily divine teaching can
	raise the rudest and worst above the best instructed and most devoted
	servants of Christ; (3) How presumption and despair on
	a death hour are equally discountenanced here, the one in the
	impenitent thief, the other in his penitent fellow.
