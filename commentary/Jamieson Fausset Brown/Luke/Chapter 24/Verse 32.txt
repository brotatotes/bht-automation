	other how their hearts burned—were fired—within them at His talk
	and His expositions of Scripture. "Ah! this accounts for it: We
	could not understand the glow of self-evidencing light, love, glory
	that ravished our hearts; but now we do." They cannot rest—how
	could they?—they must go straight back and tell the news. They find
	the eleven, but ere they have time to tell their tale, their ears are
	saluted with the thrilling news, "The Lord is risen indeed, and
	hath appeared to Simon." Most touching and precious
	intelligence this. The only one of the Eleven to whom He appeared
	alone was he, it seems, who had so shamefully denied Him. What
	passed at that interview we shall never know here. Probably it was
	too sacred for disclosure. (See on  :-). The two from Emmaus now relate what had happened to them,
	and while thus comparing notes of their Lord's appearances, lo!
	Christ Himself stands in the midst of them. What encouragement to
	doubting, dark, true-hearted disciples!
