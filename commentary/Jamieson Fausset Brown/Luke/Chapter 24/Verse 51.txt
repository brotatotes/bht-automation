51. while he blessed . . . parted,
	c.â€”Sweet intimation! Incarnate Love, Crucified Love, Risen Love,
	now on the wing for heaven, waiting only those odorous gales which
	were to waft Him to the skies, goes away in benedictions, that in the
	character of Glorified, Enthroned Love, He might continue His
	benedictions, but in yet higher form, until He come again! And oh, if
	angels were so transported at His birth into this scene of tears and
	death, what must have been their ecstasy as they welcomed and
	attended Him "far above all heavens" into the
	presence-chamber, and conducted Him to the right hand of the Majesty
	on High! Thou hast an everlasting right, O my Saviour, to that august
	place. The brightness of the Father's glory, enshrined in our nature,
	hath won it well for He poured out His soul unto death, and led
	captivity captive, receiving gifts for men, yea for the rebellious,
	that the Lord God might dwell among them. Thou art the King of glory,
	O Christ. Lift up your heads, O ye gates, be lifted up, ye
	everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in! Even so wilt
	Thou change these vile bodies of ours, that they may be like unto
	Thine own glorious body; and then with gladness and rejoicing shall
	they be brought, they shall enter into the King's palace!
