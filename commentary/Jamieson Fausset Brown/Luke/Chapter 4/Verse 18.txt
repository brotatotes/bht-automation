18, 19. To have fixed on any
	passage announcing His sufferings (as  :-), would have been unsuitable at that early stage of His
	ministry. But He selects a passage announcing the sublime object of
	His whole mission, its divine character, and His special endowments
	for it; expressed in the first person, and so singularly adapted to
	the first opening of the mouth in His prophetic capacity, that
	it seems as if made expressly for this occasion. It is from the
	well-known section of Isaiah's prophecies whose burden is that
	mysterious "SERVANT OF THE
	LORD," despised of
	man, abhorred of the nation, but before whom kings on seeing Him are
	to arise, and princes to worship; in visage more marred than any man
	and His form than the sons of men, yet sprinkling many nations;
	laboring seemingly in vain, and spending His strength for naught and
	in vain, yet Jehovah's Servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and be
	His Salvation to the ends of the earth ( :-, &c.). The quotation is chiefly from the Septuagint
	version, used in the synagogues.
