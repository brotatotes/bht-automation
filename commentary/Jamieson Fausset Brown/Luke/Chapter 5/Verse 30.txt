	The incongruities mentioned
	in Luke 5:36-38 were
	intended to illustrate the difference between the genius of
	the old and new economies, and the danger of mixing up the one
	with the other. As in the one case supposed, "the rent is made
	worse," and in the other, "the new wine is spilled,"
	so by a mongrel mixture of the ascetic ritualism of the old with
	the spiritual freedom of the new economy, both are disfigured and
	destroyed. The additional parable in Luke 5:36-42.5.38- :, which is peculiar to Luke, has been variously interpreted.
	But the "new wine" seems plainly to be the evangelical
	freedom which Christ was introducing; and the old, the opposite
	spirit of Judaism: men long accustomed to the latter could not be
	expected "straightway"—all at once—to take a liking for
	the former; that is, "These inquiries about the difference
	between My disciples and the Pharisees," and even John's, are
	not surprising; they are the effect of a natural revulsion against
	sudden change, which time will cure; the new wine will itself
	in time become old, and so acquire all the added charms of antiquity.
	What lessons does this teach, on the one hand, to those who
	unreasonably cling to what is getting antiquated; and, on the other,
	to hasty reformers who have no patience with the timidity of their
	weaker brethren!
