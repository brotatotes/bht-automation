26. ashamed of me, and of my
	words—The sense of shame is one of the strongest in our
	nature, one of the social affections founded on our love of
	reputation, which causes instinctive aversion to what is
	fitted to lower it, and was given us as a preservative from all that
	is properly shameful. When one is, in this sense of it, lost
	to shame, he is nearly past hope (Zechariah 3:5;
	Jeremiah 6:15; Jeremiah 3:3).
	But when Christ and "His words"—Christianity, especially
	in its more spiritual and uncompromising features—are unpopular,
	the same instinctive desire to stand well with others begets
	the temptation to be ashamed of Him, which only the 'expulsive power'
	of a higher affection can effectually counteract. 
	Son of man be ashamed, when
	he cometh, c.—He will render to that man his own treatment He
	will disown him before the most august of all assemblies, and put him
	to "shame and everlasting contempt" (Jeremiah 3:3- :). "Oh shame, to be put to shame before God, Christ, and
	angels!" [BENGEL].
