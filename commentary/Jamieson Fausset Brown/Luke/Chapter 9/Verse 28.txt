28. an eight days after these
	sayings—including the day on which this was spoken and that of
	the Transfiguration. Matthew and Mark say (Matthew 17:1;
	Mark 9:2) "after six days,"
	excluding these two days. As the "sayings" so
	definitely connected with the transfiguration scene are those
	announcing His death—at which Peter and all the Twelve were
	so startled and scandalized—so this scene was designed to show to
	the eyes as well as the heart how glorious that death was in
	the view of Heaven. 
	Peter, James, and
	John—partners before in secular business; now sole witnesses of
	the resurrection of Jairus' daughter (Mark 9:2- :), the transfiguration, and the agony in the garden (Mark 9:2- :). 
	a mountain—not Tabor,
	according to long tradition, with which the facts ill comport, but
	some one near the lake. 
	to pray—for the period
	He had now reached was a critical and anxious one. (See on Mark 9:2- :). But who can adequately translate those "strong
	cryings and tears?" Methinks, as I steal by His side, I hear
	from Him these plaintive sounds, "Lord, who hath believed Our
	report? I am come unto Mine own and Mine own receive Me not; I am
	become a stranger unto My brethren, an alien to My mother's children:
	Consider Mine enemies, for they are many, and they hate Me with cruel
	hatred. Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail. Thou that dwellest
	between the cherubim, shine forth: Show Me a token for good: Father,
	glorify Thy name."
