1. The beginning of the gospel of
	Jesus Christ, the Son of God—By the "Gospel" of Jesus
	Christ here is evidently meant the blessed Story which our Evangelist
	is about to tell of His Life, Ministry, Death, Resurrection, and
	Glorification, and of the begun Gathering of Believers in His Name.
	The abruptness with which he announces his subject, and the energetic
	brevity with which, passing by all preceding events, he hastens over
	the ministry of John and records the Baptism and Temptation of
	Jesus—as if impatient to come to the Public Life of the Lord of
	glory—have often been noticed as characteristic of this Gospel—a
	Gospel whose direct, practical, and singularly vivid setting imparts
	to it a preciousness peculiar to itself. What strikes every one is,
	that though the briefest of all the Gospels, this is in some of the
	principal scenes of our Lord's history the fullest. But what is not
	so obvious is, that wherever the finer and subtler feelings of
	humanity, or the deeper and more peculiar hues of our Lord's
	character were brought out, these, though they should be lightly
	passed over by all the other Evangelists, are sure to be found here,
	and in touches of such quiet delicacy and power, that though scarce
	observed by the cursory reader, they leave indelible impressions upon
	all the thoughtful and furnish a key to much that is in the other
	Gospels. These few opening words of the Second Gospel are enough to
	show, that though it was the purpose of this Evangelist to record
	chiefly the outward and palpable facts of our Lord's public life, he
	recognized in Him, in common with the Fourth Evangelist, the glory of
	the Only-begotten of the Father.
