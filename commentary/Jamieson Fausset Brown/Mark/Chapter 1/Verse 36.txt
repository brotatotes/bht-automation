	with him followed after himâ€”rather, "pressed after Him."
	Luke (Luke 4:42) says, "The
	multitudes sought after Him"; but this would be a party from the

	what related directly to him. "They that were with him"
	would probably be Andrew his brother, James and John, with a few
	other choice brethren.
