32. And they were in the way—on
	the road. 
	going up to Jerusalem—in
	Perea, and probably somewhere between Ephraim and Jericho, on the
	farther side of the Jordan, and to the northeast of Jerusalem. 
	and Jesus went before them—as
	GROTIUS says, in the style
	of an intrepid Leader. 
	and they were amazed—or
	"struck with astonishment" at His courage in advancing to
	certain death. 
	and as they followed, they
	were afraid—for their own safety. These artless, lifelike
	touches—not only from an eye-witness, but one whom the noble
	carriage of the Master struck with wonder and awe—are peculiar to
	Mark, and give the second Gospel a charm all its own; making us feel
	as if we ourselves were in the midst of the scenes it describes. Well
	might the poet exclaim: 
	 "The Saviour,
	what a noble flame 
	 Was kindled in His
	breast, 
	 When, hasting to
	Jerusalem, 
	 He march'd before the
	rest!"

And he took again the
	twelve—referring to His previous announcements on this sad
	subject. 
	and began to tell them what
	things should happen unto him—"were going to befall Him."
	The word expresses something already begun but not brought to a head,
	rather than something wholly future.
