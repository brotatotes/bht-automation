20. And in the morning—of
	Tuesday, the third day of the week: He had slept, as during all this
	week, at Bethany. 
	as they passed by—going
	into Jerusalem again. 
	they saw the fig tree dried
	up from the roots—no partial blight, leaving life in the root;
	but it was now dead, root and branch. In  :- it is said it withered away as soon as it was cursed. But
	the full blight had not appeared probably at once; and in the dusk
	perhaps, as they returned to Bethany, they had not observed it. The
	precision with which Mark distinguishes the days is not observed by
	Matthew, intent only on holding up the truths which the incident was
	designed to teach. In Matthew the whole is represented as taking
	place at once, just as the two stages of Jairus' daughter—dying and
	dead—are represented by him as one. The only difference is between
	a more summary and a more detailed narrative, each of which only
	confirms the other.
