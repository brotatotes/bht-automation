	saith unto him—satisfied that a miracle so very peculiar—a
	miracle, not of blessing, as all His other miracles, but of
	cursing—could not have been wrought but with some higher

	subject. 
	Master, behold, the fig tree
	which thou cursedst is withered away—so connecting the two
	things as to show that he traced the death of the tree entirely to
	the curse of his Lord. Matthew ( :-) gives this simply as a general exclamation of surprise by
	the disciples "how soon" the blight had taken effect.
