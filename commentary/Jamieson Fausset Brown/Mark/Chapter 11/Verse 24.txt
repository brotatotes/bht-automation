24. Therefore I say unto you, What
	things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them,
	and ye shall have themâ€”This verse only generalizes the
	assurance of Mark 11:23; which
	seems to show that it was designed for the special encouragement of
	evangelistic and missionary efforts, while this is a
	directory for prevailing prayer in general.
