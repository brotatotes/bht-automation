35. And Jesus answered and said,
	while he taught in the temple—and "while the Pharisees
	were gathered together" ( :-). 
	How say the scribes that
	Christ is the son of David?—How come they to give it out that
	Messiah is to be the son of David? In Matthew ( :-), Jesus asks them, "What think ye of Christ?" or
	of the promised and expected Messiah? "Whose son is He [to be]?
	They say unto Him, The son of David." The sense is the same. "He
	saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord?"
	(Matthew 22:42; Matthew 22:43).
