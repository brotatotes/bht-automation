 CHAPTER 13 
	
 :-. CHRIST'S
	PROPHECY OF THE
	DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM,
	AND WARNINGS
	SUGGESTED BY IT
	TO PREPARE FOR HIS
	SECOND COMING.
	( = Matthew 24:1-51; Luke 21:5-36).
	Jesus had uttered all His mind
	against the Jewish ecclesiastics, exposing their character with
	withering plainness, and denouncing, in language of awful severity,
	the judgments of God against them for that unfaithfulness to their
	trust which was bringing ruin upon the nation. He had closed this His
	last public discourse (Luke 21:5-42.21.36- :) by a passionate lamentation over Jerusalem, and a solemn
	farewell to the temple. "And," says Matthew (Luke 21:5-42.21.36- :), "Jesus went out and departed from the temple"â€”never
	more to re-enter its precincts, or open His mouth in public teaching.
	With this act ended His public ministry. As He withdrew, says
	OLSHAUSEN, the gracious
	presence of God left the sanctuary; and the temple, with all its
	service, and the whole theocratic constitution, was given over to
	destruction. What immediately followed is, as usual, most minutely
	and graphically described by our Evangelist.
