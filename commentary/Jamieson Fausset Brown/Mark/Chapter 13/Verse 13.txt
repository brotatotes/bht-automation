13. And ye shall be hated of all men
	for my name's sake—Matthew ( :-) adds this important intimation: "And because iniquity
	shall abound, the love of many"—"of the many," or
	"of the most," that is, of the generality of professed
	disciples—"shall wax cold." Sad illustrations of the
	effect of abounding iniquity in cooling the love even of faithful
	disciples we have in the Epistle of James, written about the
	period here referred to, and too frequently ever since. 
	but he that shall endure unto
	the end, the same shall be saved—See on  :-; and compare Hebrews 10:38;
	Hebrews 10:39, which is a manifest
	allusion to these words of Christ; also Hebrews 10:39- :. Luke (Luke 21:18) adds
	these reassuring words: "But there shall not an hair of your
	heads perish." Our Lord had just said (Luke 21:18- :) that they should be put to death; showing that this
	precious promise is far above immunity from mere bodily harm, and
	furnishing a key to the right interpretation of Luke 21:18- : and such like.
