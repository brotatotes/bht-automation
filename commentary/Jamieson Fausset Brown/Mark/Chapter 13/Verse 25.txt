25. And the stars of heaven shall
	fall—"and upon the earth distress of nations, with
	perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them
	for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the
	earth" (Luke 21:25; Luke 21:26).
	and the powers that are in
	heaven shall be shaken—Though the grandeur of this language
	carries the mind over the head of all periods but that of Christ's
	Second Coming, nearly every expression will be found used of the
	Lord's coming in terrible national judgments: as of Babylon (Luke 21:26- :); of Idumea (Isaiah 34:1;
	Isaiah 34:2; Isaiah 34:4;
	Isaiah 34:8-10); of Egypt
	(Ezekiel 32:7; Ezekiel 32:8);
	compare also Psalms 18:7-15;
	Isaiah 24:1; Isaiah 24:17-19;
	Joel 2:10; Joel 2:11,
	&c. We cannot therefore consider the mere strength of this
	language a proof that it refers exclusively or primarily to the
	precursors of the final day, though of course in "that day"
	it will have its most awful fulfilment.
