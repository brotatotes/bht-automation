6. For many shall come in my name,
	saying, I am Christ—(see  :-) —"and the time draweth nigh" ( :-); that is, the time of the kingdom in its full splendor. 
	and shall deceive many—"Go
	ye not therefore after them" ( :-). The reference here seems not to be to pretended Messiahs,
	deceiving those who rejected the claims of Jesus, of whom indeed
	there were plenty—for our Lord is addressing His own genuine
	disciples—but to persons pretending to be Jesus Himself, returned
	in glory to take possession of His kingdom. This gives peculiar force
	to the words, "Go ye not therefore after them."
