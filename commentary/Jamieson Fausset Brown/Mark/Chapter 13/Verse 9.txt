9. But take heed to yourselves:
	for—"before all these things" ( :-); that is, before these public calamities come. 
	they shall deliver you up to
	councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten—These refer
	to ecclesiastical proceedings against them. 
	and ye shall be brought
	before rulers and kings—before civil tribunals next. 
	for my sake, for a testimony
	against them—rather "unto them"—to give you an
	opportunity of bearing testimony to Me before them. In the Acts of
	the Apostles we have the best commentary on this announcement.
	(Compare Matthew 10:17; Matthew 10:18).
