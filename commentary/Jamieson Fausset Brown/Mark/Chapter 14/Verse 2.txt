2. But they said, Not on the feast
	day—rather, not during the feast; not until the seven days of
	unleavened bread should be over. 
	lest there be an uproar of
	the people—In consequence of the vast influx of strangers,
	embracing all the male population of the land who had reached a
	certain age, there were within the walls of Jerusalem at this
	festival some two million people; and in their excited state, the
	danger of tumult and bloodshed among "the people," who for
	the most part took Jesus for a prophet, was extreme. See JOSEPHUS
	[Antiquities, 20.5.3]. What plan, if any, these ecclesiastics
	fixed upon for seizing our Lord, does not appear. But the proposal of
	Judas being at once and eagerly gone into, it is probable they were
	till then at some loss for a plan sufficiently quiet and yet
	effectual. So, just at the feast time shall it be done; the
	unexpected offer of Judas relieving them of their fears. Thus, as
	BENGEL remarks, did the
	divine counsel take effect. 
	The Supper and the Anointing at
	Bethany Six Days before the Passover ( :-). 
	The time of this part of the
	narrative is four days before what has just been related. Had
	it been part of the regular train of events which our Evangelist
	designed to record, he would probably have inserted it in its proper
	place, before the conspiracy of the Jewish authorities. But having
	come to the treason of Judas, he seems to have gone back upon this
	scene as what probably gave immediate occasion to the awful deed.
