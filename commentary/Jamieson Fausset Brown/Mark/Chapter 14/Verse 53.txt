53. And they led Jesus away to the
	high priest: and with him were assembled—or rather, "there
	gathered together unto him." 
	all the chief priests and the
	elders and the scribes—it was then a full and formal meeting of
	the Sanhedrim. Now, as the first three Evangelists place all Peter's
	denials of his Lord after this, we should naturally conclude that
	they took place while our Lord stood before the Sanhedrim. But
	besides that the natural impression is that the scene around the fire
	took place overnight, the second crowing of the cock,
	if we are to credit ancient writers, would occur about the beginning
	of the fourth watch, or between three and four in the morning. By
	that time, however, the Council had probably convened, being warned,
	perhaps, that they were to prepare for being called at any hour of
	the morning, should the Prisoner be successfully secured. If this be
	correct, it is fairly certain that only the last of Peter's
	three denials would take place while our Lord was under trial before
	the Sanhedrim. One thing more may require explanation. If our Lord
	had to be transferred from the residence of Annas to that of
	Caiaphas, one is apt to wonder that there is no mention of His being
	marched from the one to the other. But the building, in all
	likelihood, was one and the same; in which case He would merely have
	to be taken perhaps across the court, from one chamber to another.
