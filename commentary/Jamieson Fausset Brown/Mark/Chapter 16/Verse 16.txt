16. He that believeth and is
	baptized—Baptism is here put for the external signature of the
	inner faith of the heart, just as "confessing with the mouth"
	is in Romans 10:10; and there also
	as here this outward manifestation, once mentioned as the
	proper fruit of faith, is not repeated in what follows (Romans 10:10- :). 
	shall be saved; but he that
	believeth not shall be damned—These awful issues of the
	reception or rejection of the Gospel, though often recorded in other
	connections, are given in this connection only by Mark.
