2. And straightway many were
	gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them,
	no, not so much as about the door—This is one of Mark's graphic
	touches. No doubt in this case, as the scene occurred at his
	informant's own door, these details are the vivid recollections of
	that honored disciple. 
	and he preached the word unto
	them—that is, indoors; but in the hearing, doubtless, of the
	multitude that pressed around. Had He gone forth, as He naturally
	would, the paralytic's faith would have had no such opportunity to
	display itself. Luke (Luke 5:17)
	furnishes an additional and very important incident in the scene—as
	follows: "And it came to pass on a certain day, as He was
	teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting
	by, which were come out of every town," or village, "of
	Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem." This was the highest
	testimony yet borne to our Lord's growing influence, and the
	necessity increasingly felt by the ecclesiastics throughout the
	country of coming to some definite judgment regarding Him. "And
	the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them"—or, "was
	[efficacious] to heal them," that is, the sick that were brought
	before Him. So that the miracle that is now to be described was among
	the most glorious and worthy to be recorded of many then performed;
	and what made it so was doubtless the faith which was manifested in
	connection with it, and the proclamation of the forgiveness of the
	patient's sins that immediately preceded it.
