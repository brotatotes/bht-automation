7. Why doth this man thus speak
	blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?â€”In this second
	question they expressed a great truth. (See Isaiah 43:25;
	Micah 7:18; Exodus 34:6;
	Exodus 34:7, c.). Nor was their first
	question altogether unnatural, though in our Lord's sole case it was
	unfounded. That a man, to all appearances like one of themselves,
	should claim authority and power to forgive sins, they could not, on
	the first blush of it, but regard as in the last degree startling nor
	were they entitled even to weigh such a claim, as worthy of a
	hearing, save on supposition of resistless evidence afforded by Him
	in support of the claim. Accordingly, our Lord deals with them as men
	entitled to such evidence, and supplies it; at the same time chiding
	them for rashness, in drawing harsh conclusions regarding Himself.
