13. Know ye not this parable? and
	how then will ye know all parables?â€”Probably this was said not
	so much in the spirit of rebuke, as to call their attention to the
	exposition of it which He was about to give, and so train them to the
	right apprehension of His future parables. As in the parables which
	we have endeavored to explain in  :-, we shall take this parable and the Lord's own exposition of
	the different parts of it together.
