16. And these are they likewise
	which are sown on stony ground, c.—"Immediately" the
	seed in such a case "springs up"—all the quicker from the
	shallowness of the soil—"because it has no depth of earth."
	But the sun, beating on it, as quickly scorches and withers it up,
	"because it has no root" ( :-), and "lacks moisture" ( :-). The great truth here taught is that hearts superficially
	impressed are apt to receive the truth with readiness, and even with
	joy (Luke 8:13) but the
	heat of tribulation or persecution because of the word, or the
	trials which their new profession brings upon them quickly dries up
	their relish for the truth, and withers all the hasty promise of
	fruit which they showed. Such disappointing issues of a faithful
	and awakening ministry—alas, how frequent are they!
