20. And these are they which are
	sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring
	forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundredâ€”A
	heart soft and tender, stirred to its depths on the great things of
	eternity, and jealously guarded from worldly engrossments, such only
	is the "honest and good heart" ( :-), which "keeps," that is, "retains" the
	seed of the word, and bears fruit just in proportion as it is such a
	heart. Such "bring forth fruit with patience" ( :-), or continuance, "enduring to the end"; in
	contrast with those in whom the word is "choked" and brings
	no fruit to perfection. The "thirtyfold" is designed
	to express the lowest degree of fruitfulness; the
	"hundredfold" the highest; and the "sixtyfold"
	the intermediate degrees of fruitfulness. As a "hundredfold,"
	though not unexampled (Genesis 26:12),
	is a rare return in the natural husbandry, so the highest degrees of
	spiritual fruitfulness are too seldom witnessed. The closing words of
	this introductory parable seem designed to call attention to the
	fundamental and universal character of it.
