35. And the same day—on which
	He spoke the memorable parables of the  :-, and of  :-. 
	when the even was come—(See
	on Mark 6:35). This must have
	been the earlier evening—what we should call the afternoon—since
	after all that passed on the other side, when He returned to the west
	side, the people were waiting for Him in great numbers (Mark 4:21;
	Luke 8:40). 
	he saith unto them, Let us
	pass over unto the other side—to the east side of the lake, to
	grapple with a desperate case of possession, and set the captive
	free, and to give the Gadarenes an opportunity of hearing the message
	of salvation, amid the wonder which that marvellous cure was fitted
	to awaken and the awe which the subsequent events could not but
	strike into them.
