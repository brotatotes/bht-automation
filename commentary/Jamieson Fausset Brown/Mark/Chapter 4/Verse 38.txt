	the ship—or stern. 
	asleep on a pillow—either
	a place in the vessel made to receive the head, or a cushion for the
	head to rest on. It was evening; and after the fatigues of a busy day
	of teaching under the hot sun, having nothing to do while crossing

	to fish upon that deep thus spake, the danger must have been
	imminent. They say nothing of what would become of Him, if
	they perished; nor think, whether, if He could not perish, it was
	likely He would let this happen to them; but they hardly knew what
	they said.
