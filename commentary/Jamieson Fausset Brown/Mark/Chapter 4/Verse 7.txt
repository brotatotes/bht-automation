7. And some fell among thorns, and
	the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit—This
	case is that of ground not thoroughly cleaned of the thistles, c.
	which, rising above the good seed, "choke" or "smother"
	it, excluding light and air, and drawing away the moisture and
	richness of the soil. Hence it "becomes unfruitful" ( :-); it grows, but its growth is checked, and it never ripens.
	The evil here is neither a hard nor a shallow soil—there is
	softness enough, and depth enough; but it is the
	existence in it of what draws all the moisture and richness of the
	soil away to itself, and so starves the plant. What now are
	these "thorns?" See on  :-. 
	Fourth Case: THE
	GOOD GROUND.
