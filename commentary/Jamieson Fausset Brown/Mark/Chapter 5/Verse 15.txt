15. And they come to Jesus—Matthew
	(Matthew 8:34) says, "Behold,
	the whole city came out to meet Jesus." 
	and see him that was
	possessed with the devil—the demonized person. 
	and had the legion,
	sitting—"at the feet of Jesus," adds Luke (Matthew 8:34- :); in contrast with his former wild and wandering
	habits. 
	and clothed—As our
	Evangelist had not told us that he "ware no clothes," the
	meaning of this statement could only have been conjectured but for
	"the beloved physician" (Matthew 8:34- :), who supplies the missing piece of information here. This
	is a striking case of what are called Undesigned Coincidences
	amongst the different Evangelists; one of them taking a thing for
	granted, as familiarly known at the time, but which we should never
	have known but for one or more of the others, and without the
	knowledge of which some of their statements would be unintelligible.
	The clothing which the poor man would feel the want of the moment his
	consciousness returned to him, was doubtless supplied to him by some
	of the Twelve. 
	and in his right mind—but
	now, oh, in what a lofty sense! (Compare an analogous, though a
	different kind of case, Matthew 8:34- :). 
	and they were afraid—Had
	this been awe only, it had been natural enough; but other feelings,
	alas! of a darker kind, soon showed themselves.
