21. And when Jesus was passed over
	again by ship unto the other side—from the Gadarene side of the
	lake, where He had parted with the healed demoniac, to the west side,
	at Capernaum. 
	much people gathered unto
	him—who "gladly received Him; for they were all waiting
	for Him" (Luke 8:40). The
	abundant teaching earlier that day (Mark 4:1-34;
	Matthew 13:1-58) had only
	whetted the people's appetite: and disappointed, as would seem, that
	He had left them in the evening to cross the lake, they remain
	hanging about the beach, having got a hint, probably through some of
	His disciples, that He would be back the same evening. Perhaps they
	witnessed at a distance the sudden calming of the tempest. The tide
	of our Lord's popularity was now fast rising. 
	and he was nigh unto the sea.
