	many physicians—The expression perhaps does not necessarily
	refer to the suffering she endured under medical treatment, but to
	the much varied treatment which she underwent. 
	and had spent all that she
	had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse—pitiable
	case, and affectingly aggravated; emblem of our natural state as
	fallen creatures (Ezekiel 16:5;
	Ezekiel 16:6), and illustrating the
	worse than vanity of all human remedies for spiritual maladies (Ezekiel 16:6- :). The higher design of all our Lord's miracles of healing
	irresistibly suggests this way of viewing the present case, the
	propriety of which will still more appear as we proceed.
