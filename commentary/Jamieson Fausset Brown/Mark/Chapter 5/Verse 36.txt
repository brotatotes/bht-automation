	synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe—Jesus, knowing how the
	heart of the agonized father would sink at the tidings, and the
	reflections at the delay which would be apt to rise in his

	not afraid, only believe"—words of unchanging preciousness and
	power! How vividly do such incidents bring out Christ's knowledge of
	the human heart and tender sympathy! ( :-).
