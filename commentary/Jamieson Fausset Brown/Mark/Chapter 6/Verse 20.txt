20. For Herod feared John—but,
	as BENGEL notes, John
	feared not Herod. 
	knowing that he was a just
	man and an holy—Compare the case of Elijah with Ahab, after the
	murder of Naboth (1 Kings 21:20). 
	and observed him—rather,
	as in the Margin, "kept" or "saved him";
	that is, from the wicked designs of Herodias, who had been watching
	for some pretext to get Herod entangled and committed to despatch
	him. 
	and when he heard him, he did
	many things—many good things under the influence of the Baptist
	on his conscience. 
	and heard him gladly—a
	striking statement this, for which we are indebted to our graphic
	Evangelist alone, illustrating the working of contrary principles in
	the slaves of passion. But this only shows how far Herodias must have
	wrought upon him, as Jezebel upon Ahab, that he should at length
	agree to what his awakened conscience kept him long from executing.
