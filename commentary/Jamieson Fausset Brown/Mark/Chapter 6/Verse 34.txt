34. And Jesus, when he came out of
	the ship—having gone on shore. 
	saw much people—a great
	multitude. 
	and was moved with compassion
	toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd—At
	the sight of the multitudes who had followed Him by land and even got
	before Him, He was so moved, as was His wont in such cases, with
	compassion, because they were like shepherdless sheep, as to forego
	both privacy and rest that He might minister to them. Here we have an
	important piece of information from the Fourth Evangelist ( :-), "And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was
	nigh"—rather, "Now the passover, the feast of the Jews,
	was nigh." This accounts for the multitudes that now crowded
	around Him. They were on their way to keep that festival at
	Jerusalem. But Jesus did not go up to this festival, as John
	expressly tells us, (John 7:1)
	—remaining in Galilee, because the ruling Jews sought to kill Him.
