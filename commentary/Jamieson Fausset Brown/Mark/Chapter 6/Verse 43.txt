43. And they took up twelve baskets
	full of the fragments, and of the fishes—"Therefore (says
	John 6:13), they gathered them
	together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five
	barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had
	eaten." The article here rendered "baskets" in all the
	four narratives was part of the luggage taken by Jews on a journey—to
	carry, it is said, both their provisions and hay to sleep on, that
	they might not have to depend on Gentiles, and so run the risk of
	ceremonial pollution. In this we have a striking corroboration of the
	truth of the four narratives. Internal evidence renders it clear, we
	think, that the first three Evangelists wrote independently of each
	other, though the fourth must have seen all the others. But here,
	each of the first three Evangelists uses the same word to express the
	apparently insignificant circumstance that the baskets employed to
	gather up the fragments were of the kind which even the Roman
	satirist, JUVENAL, knew by
	the name of cophinus, while in both the narratives of the
	feeding of the Four Thousand the baskets used are expressly said to
	have been of the kind called spuris. (See Mark 8:19;
	Mark 8:20.)
