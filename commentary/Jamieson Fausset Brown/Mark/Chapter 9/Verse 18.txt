18. And wheresoever he taketh him,
	he teareth him; and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and
	pineth away—rather, "becomes withered," "dried
	up," or "paralyzed"; as the same word is everywhere
	else rendered in the New Testament. Some additional particulars are
	given by Luke, and by our Evangelist below. "Lo," says he
	in Luke 9:39, "a spirit
	taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he
	foameth again, and bruising him hardly [or with difficulty] departeth
	from him." 
	and I spake to thy disciples
	that they should cast him out; and they could not—Our Lord
	replies to the father by a severe rebuke to the disciples. As if
	wounded at the exposure before such a multitude, of the weakness of
	His disciples' faith, which doubtless He felt as a reflection on
	Himself, He puts them to the blush before all, but in language fitted
	only to raise expectation of what He Himself would do.
