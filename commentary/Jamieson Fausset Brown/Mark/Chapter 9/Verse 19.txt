19. He answereth him, and saith, O
	faithless generation—"and perverse," or "perverted"
	(Matthew 17:17; Luke 9:41).
	how long shall I be with you?
	how long shall I suffer you?—language implying that it was a
	shame to them to want the faith necessary to perform this cure, and
	that it needed some patience to put up with them. It is to us
	surprising that some interpreters, as CHRYSOSTOM
	and CALVIN, should
	represent this rebuke as addressed, not to the disciples at all, but
	to the scribes who disputed with them. Nor does it much, if at all,
	mend the matter to view it as addressed to both, as most expositors
	seem to do. With BENGEL,
	DE WETTE,
	and MEYER, we regard it as
	addressed directly to the nine apostles who were unable to expel this
	evil spirit. And though, in ascribing this inability to their "want
	of faith" and the "perverted turn of mind" which they
	had drunk in with their early training, the rebuke would undoubtedly
	apply, with vastly greater force, to those who twitted the poor
	disciples with their inability, it would be to change the whole
	nature of the rebuke to suppose it addressed to those who had no
	faith at all, and were wholly perverted. It was because
	faith sufficient for curing this youth was to be expected of the
	disciples, and because they should by that time have got rid of the
	perversity in which they had been reared, that Jesus exposes them
	thus before the rest. And who does not see that this was fitted, more
	than anything else, to impress upon the by-standers the severe
	loftiness of the training He was giving to the Twelve, and the
	unsophisticated footing He was on with them? 
	Bring him unto me—The
	order to bring the patient to Him was instantly obeyed; when, lo! as
	if conscious of the presence of his Divine Tormentor, and expecting
	to be made to quit, the foul spirit rages and is furious, determined
	to die hard, doing all the mischief he can to this poor child while
	yet within his grasp.
