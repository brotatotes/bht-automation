	and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him—Just as
	the man with the legion of demons, "when he saw Jesus,
	ran and worshipped Him" ( :-), so this demon, when he saw Him, immediately "tare

	conversing with the father about the case—partly to have its
	desperate features told out by him who knew them best, in the hearing
	of the spectators; partly to let its virulence have time to show
	itself; and partly to deepen the exercise of the father's soul, to
	draw out his faith, and thus to prepare both him and the by-standers
	for what He was to do.
