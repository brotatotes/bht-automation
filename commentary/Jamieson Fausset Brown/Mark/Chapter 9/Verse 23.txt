23. Jesus said unto him, If thou
	canst believe—The man had said, "If Thou canst do
	anything." Jesus replies. 
	all things are possible to
	him that believeth—"My doing all depends on thy
	believing." To impress this still more, He redoubles upon the
	believing: "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to
	him that believeth." Thus the Lord helps the birth of faith in
	that struggling soul; and now, though with pain and sore travail, it
	comes to the birth, as TRENCH,
	borrowing from OLSHAUSEN,
	expresses it. Seeing the case stood still, waiting not upon the
	Lord's power but his own faith, the man becomes immediately conscious
	of conflicting principles, and rises into one of the noblest
	utterances on record.
