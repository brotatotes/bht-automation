24. And straightway the father of
	the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe: help thou
	mine unbelief—that is, "It is useless concealing from
	Thee, O Thou mysterious, mighty Healer, the unbelief that still
	struggles in this heart of mine; but that heart bears me witness that
	I do believe in Thee; and if distrust still remains, I disown it, I
	wrestle with it, I seek help from Thee against it." Two things
	are very remarkable here: First, The felt and owned presence of
	unbelief, which only the strength of the man's faith could have
	so revealed to his own consciousness. Second, His appeal to Christ
	for help against his felt unbelief—a feature in the case quite
	unparalleled, and showing, more than all protestations could have
	done, the insight he had attained into the existence of a power in
	Christ more glorious them any he had besought for his poor child.
	The work was done; and as the commotion and confusion in the crowd
	was now increasing, Jesus at once, as Lord of spirits, gives the word
	of command to the dumb and deaf spirit to be gone, never again to
	return to his victim.
