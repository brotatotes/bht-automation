29. And he said unto them, This kind
	can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting—that is, as
	nearly all good interpreters are agreed, "this kind of evil
	spirits cannot be expelled," or "so desperate a case of
	demoniacal possession cannot be cured, but by prayer and fasting."
	But since the Lord Himself says that His disciples could not fast
	while He was with them, perhaps this was designed, as ALFORD
	hints, for their after-guidance—unless we take it as but a definite
	way of expressing the general truth, that great and difficult duties
	require special preparation and self-denial. But the answer to their
	question, as given in Matthew 17:20;
	Matthew 17:21 is fuller: "And
	Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief. For verily I say unto
	you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto
	this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove; and
	nothing shall be impossible unto you" (Matthew 17:21- :). See on Mark 9:1.
	"Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting"
	(Matthew 17:21), that is, though
	nothing is impossible to faith, yet such a height of faith as is
	requisite for such triumphs is not to be reached either in a moment
	or without effort—either with God in prayer or with ourselves in
	self-denying exercises. Luke (Matthew 17:21- :) adds, "And they were all amazed at the mighty power of
	God"—"at the majesty" or "mightiness of God,"
	in this last miracle, in the Transfiguration, c. or, at the divine
	grandeur of Christ rising upon them daily.
