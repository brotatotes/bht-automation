11. And Josias begat Jechonias and
	his brethren—Jeconiah was Josiah's grandson, being the son of
	Jehoiakim, Josiah's second son ( :-); but Jehoiakim might well be sunk in such a catalogue,
	being a mere puppet in the hands of the king of Egypt ( :-). The "brethren" of Jechonias here evidently mean
	his uncles—the chief of whom, Mattaniah or Zedekiah, who came to
	the throne (2 Kings 24:17), is, in
	2 Chronicles 36:10, as well as here,
	called "his brother." 
	about the time they were
	carried away to Babylon—literally, "of their migration,"
	for the Jews avoided the word "captivity" as too bitter a
	recollection, and our Evangelist studiously respects the national
	feeling.
