19. Then Joseph her husband—Compare
	Matthew 1:20, "Mary, thy wife."
	Betrothal was, in Jewish law, valid marriage. In giving Mary up,
	therefore, Joseph had to take legal steps to effect the separation. 
	being a just man, and not
	willing to make her a public example—to expose her (see Deuteronomy 22:23;
	Deuteronomy 22:24) 
	was minded to put her away
	privily—that is, privately by giving her the required writing
	of divorcement (Deuteronomy 24:1), in
	presence of only two or three witnesses, and without cause assigned,
	instead of having her before a magistrate. That some communication
	had passed between him and his betrothed, directly or indirectly, on
	the subject, after she returned from her three months' visit to
	Elizabeth, can hardly be doubted. Nor does the purpose to divorce her
	necessarily imply disbelief, on Joseph's part, of the explanation
	given him. Even supposing him to have yielded to it some reverential
	assent—and the Evangelist seems to convey as much, by ascribing the
	proposal to screen her to the justice of his character—he
	might think it altogether unsuitable and incongruous in such
	circumstances to follow out the marriage.
