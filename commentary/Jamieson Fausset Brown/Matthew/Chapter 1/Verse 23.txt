23. Behold, a virgin—It should
	be "the virgin" meaning that particular virgin
	destined to this unparalleled distinction. 
	shall be with child, and
	shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,
	which, being interpreted, is, God with us—Not that He was to
	have this for a proper name (like "Jesus"), but that He
	should come to be known in this character, as God manifested
	in the flesh, and the living bond of holy and most intimate
	fellowship between God and men from henceforth and for ever.
