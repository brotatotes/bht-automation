7-8. And Solomon begat Roboam; and
	Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 8. And Asa begat Josaphat; and
	Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias—or Uzziah. Three
	kings are here omitted—Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah
	(1 Chronicles 3:11; 1 Chronicles 3:12).
	Some omissions behooved to be made, to compress the whole into three
	fourteens (Matthew 1:17). The reason
	why these, rather than other names, are omitted, must be sought in
	religious considerations—either in the connection of those
	kings with the house of Ahab (as LIGHTFOOT,
	EBRARD, and ALFORD
	view it); in their slender right to be regarded as true links in the
	theocratic chain (as LANGE
	takes it); or in some similar disqualification.
