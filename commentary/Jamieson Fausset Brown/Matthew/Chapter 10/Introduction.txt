 CHAPTER 10 
	
 :-. MISSION OF THE
	TWELVE APOSTLES.
	( = Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).
	The last three verses of the ninth
	chapter form the proper introduction to the Mission of the Twelve, as
	is evident from the remarkable fact that the Mission of the Seventy
	was prefaced by the very same words. (See on Luke 9:1-42.9.6- :).
