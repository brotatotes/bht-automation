16. Behold, I send you forth—The
	"I" here is emphatic, holding up Himself as the Fountain of
	the Gospel ministry, as He is also the Great Burden of it. 
	as sheep—defenseless. 
	in the midst of wolves—ready
	to make a prey of you (John 10:12).
	To be left exposed, as sheep to wolves, would have been startling
	enough; but that the sheep should be sent among the wolves
	would sound strange indeed. No wonder this announcement begins with
	the exclamation, "Behold." 
	be ye therefore wise as
	serpents, and harmless as doves—Wonderful combination this!
	Alone, the wisdom of the serpent is mere cunning, and the
	harmlessness of the dove little better than weakness: but in
	combination, the wisdom of the serpent would save them from
	unnecessary exposure to danger; the harmlessness of the dove, from
	sinful expedients to escape it. In the apostolic age of Christianity,
	how harmoniously were these qualities displayed! Instead of the
	fanatical thirst for martyrdom, to which a later age gave birth,
	there was a manly combination of unflinching zeal and calm
	discretion, before which nothing was able to stand.
