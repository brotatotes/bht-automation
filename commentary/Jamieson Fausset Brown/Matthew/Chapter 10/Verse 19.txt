19. But when they deliver you up,
	take no thought—be not solicitous or anxious. (See on  :-). 
	how or what ye shall
	speak—that is, either in what manner ye shall make your
	defense, or of what matter it shall consist. 
	for it shall be given you in
	that same hour what ye shall speak—(See Exodus 4:12;
	Jeremiah 1:7).
