22. And ye shall be hated of all men
	for my name's sake—The universality of this hatred would make
	it evident to them, that since it would not be owing to any temporary
	excitement, local virulence, or personal prejudice, on the part of
	their enemies, so no amount of discretion on their part, consistent
	with entire fidelity to the truth, would avail to stifle that
	enmity—though it might soften its violence, and in some cases avert
	the outward manifestations of it. 
	but he that endureth to the
	end shall be saved—a great saying, repeated, in connection with
	similar warnings, in the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem ( :-); and often reiterated by the apostle as a warning against
	"drawing back unto perdition" (Hebrews 3:6;
	Hebrews 3:13; Hebrews 6:4-6;
	Hebrews 10:23; Hebrews 10:26-29;
	Hebrews 10:38; Hebrews 10:39,
	&c.). As "drawing back unto perdition" is merely the
	palpable evidence of the want of "root" from the first in
	the Christian profession (Luke 8:13),
	so "enduring to the end" is just the proper evidence of its
	reality and solidity.
