23. But when they persecute you in
	this city, flee ye into another—"into the other."
	This, though applicable to all time, and exemplified by our Lord
	Himself once and again, had special reference to the brief
	opportunities which Israel was to have of "knowing the time of
	His visitations." 
	for verily I say unto
	you—what will startle you, but at the same time show you the
	solemnity of your mission, and the need of economizing the time for
	it. 
	Ye shall not have gone
	over—Ye shall in nowise have completed. 
	the cities of Israel, till
	the Son of man be come—To understand this—as LANGE
	and others do—in the first instance, of Christ's own
	peregrinations, as if He had said, "Waste not your time upon
	hostile places, for I Myself will be after you ere your work be
	over"—seems almost trifling. "The coming of the Son of
	man" has a fixed doctrinal sense, here referring immediately to
	the crisis of Israel's history as the visible kingdom of God, when
	Christ was to come and judge it; when "the wrath would come upon
	it to the uttermost"; and when, on the ruins of Jerusalem and
	the old economy, He would establish His own kingdom. This, in the
	uniform language of Scripture, is more immediately "the coming
	of the Son of man," "the day of vengeance of our God"
	(Matthew 16:28; Matthew 24:27;
	Matthew 24:34; compare with Hebrews 10:25;
	James 5:7-9) —but only as
	being such a lively anticipation of His second coming for vengeance
	and deliverance. So understood, it is parallel with James 5:7-59.5.9- : (on which see).
