39. He that findeth his life shall
	lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find
	it—another of those pregnant sayings which our Lord so often
	reiterates (Matthew 16:25; Luke 17:33;
	John 12:25). The pith of such
	paradoxical maxims depends on the double sense attached to the word
	"life"—a lower and a higher, the natural and the
	spiritual, the temporal and eternal. An entire sacrifice of the
	lower, with all its relationships and interests—or, a willingness
	to make it which is the same thing—is indispensable to the
	preservation of the higher life; and he who cannot bring himself to
	surrender the one for the sake of the other shall eventually lose
	both.
