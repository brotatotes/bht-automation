41. He that receiveth a prophet—one
	divinely commissioned to deliver a message from heaven. Predicting
	future events was no necessary part of a prophet's office, especially
	as the word is used in the New Testament. 
	in the name of a prophet—for
	his office's sake and love to his master. (See  :- and see on  :-). 
	shall receive a prophet's
	reward—What an encouragement to those who are not
	prophets! (See John 3:5-8).
	and he that receiveth a
	righteous man in the name of a righteous man—from sympathy with
	his character and esteem for himself as such 
	shall receive a righteous
	man's reward—for he must himself have the seed of righteousness
	who has any real sympathy with it and complacency in him who
	possesses it.
