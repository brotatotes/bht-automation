5. These twelve Jesus sent forth,
	and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and
	into any city of the Samaritans enter ye notâ€”The Samaritans
	were Gentiles by blood; but being the descendants of those whom the
	king of Assyria had transported from the East to supply the place of
	the ten tribes carried captive, they had adopted the religion of the
	Jews, though with admixtures of their own: and, as the nearest
	neighbors of the Jews, they occupied a place intermediate between
	them and the Gentiles. Accordingly, when this prohibition was to be
	taken off, on the effusion of the Spirit at Pentecost, the apostles
	were told that they should be Christ's witnesses first "in
	Jerusalem, and in all Judea," then "in Samaria," and
	lastly, "unto the uttermost part of the earth" ( :-).
