1. And it came to pass, when Jesus
	had made an end of commanding his twelve disciple—rather, "the
	twelve disciples," 
	he departed thence to teach
	and to preach in their cities—This was scarcely a fourth
	circuit—if we may judge from the less formal way in which it was
	expressed—but, perhaps, a set of visits paid to certain places,
	either not reached at all before, or too rapidly passed through, in
	order to fill up the time till the return of the Twelve. As to their
	labors, nothing is said of them by our Evangelist. But Luke ( :-) says, "They departed, and went through, the towns,"
	or "villages," "preaching the Gospel, and healing
	everywhere." Mark (Mark 6:12;
	Mark 6:13), as usual, is more
	explicit: "And they went out, and preached that men should
	repent. And they cast out many devils (demons) and anointed with oil
	many that were sick, and healed them." Though this "anointing
	with oil" was not mentioned in our Lord's instructions—at
	least in any of the records of them—we know it to have been
	practiced long after this in the apostolic Church (see Mark 6:13- :, and compare Mark 6:12;
	Mark 6:13) —not medicinally,
	but as a sign of the healing virtue which was communicated by their
	hands, and a symbol of something still more precious. It was unction,
	indeed, but, as BENGEL
	remarks, it was something very different from what Romanists call
	extreme unction. He adds, what is very probable, that they do
	not appear to have carried the oil about with them, but, as the Jews
	used oil as a medicine, to have employed it just as they found it
	with the sick, in their own higher way.
