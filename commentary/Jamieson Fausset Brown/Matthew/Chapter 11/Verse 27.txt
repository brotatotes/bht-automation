27. All things are delivered unto me
	of my Father—He does not say, They are revealed—as to
	one who knew them not, and was an entire stranger to them save as
	they were discovered to Him—but, They are "delivered over,"
	or "committed," to Me of My Father; meaning the whole
	administration of the kingdom of grace. So in  :-, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things
	into His hand" (see on  :-).
	But though the "all things" in both these passages refer
	properly to the kingdom of grace, they of course include all things
	necessary to the full execution of that trust—that is, unlimited
	power. (So Matthew 28:18; John 17:2;
	Ephesians 1:22). 
	and no man knoweth the Son,
	but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and
	he to whomsoever the Son will—willeth 
	to reveal him—What a
	saying is this, that "the Father and the Son are mutually and
	exclusively known to each other!" A higher claim to equality
	with the Father cannot be conceived. Either, then, we have here one
	of the revolting assumptions ever uttered, or the proper divinity of
	Christ should to Christians be beyond dispute. "But, alas for
	me!" may some burdened soul, sighing for relief, here exclaim.
	If it be thus with us, what can any poor creature do but lie down in
	passive despair, unless he could dare to hope that he may be
	one of the favored class "to whom the Son is willing to reveal
	the Father." But nay. This testimony to the sovereignty of that
	gracious "will," on which alone men's salvation depends, is
	designed but to reveal the source and enhance the glory of it when
	once imparted—not to paralyze or shut the soul up in despair. Hear,
	accordingly, what follows:
