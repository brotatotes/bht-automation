 CHAPTER 12 
	
 :-. PLUCKING CORN
	EARS ON THE SABBATH
	DAY. ( = Mark 2:23-28;
	Luke 6:1-5). 
	The season of the year when this
	occurred is determined by the event itself. Ripe corn ears are found
	in the fields only just before harvest. The barley harvest seems
	clearly intended here, at the close of our March and beginning of our
	April. It coincided with the Passover season, as the wheat harvest
	with Pentecost. But in Luke (Luke 6:1)
	we have a still more definite note of time, if we could be certain of
	the meaning of the peculiar term which he employs to express it. "It
	came to pass (he says) on the sabbath, which was the first-second,"
	for that is the proper rendering of the word, and not "the
	second sabbath after the first," as in our version. Of the
	various conjectures what this may mean, that of SCALIGER
	is the most approved, and, as we think, the freest from difficulty,
	namely, the first sabbath after the second day of the Passover; that
	is, the first of the seven sabbaths which were to be reckoned from
	the second day of the Passover, which was itself a sabbath, until the
	next feast, the feast of Pentecost (Leviticus 23:15;
	Leviticus 23:16; Deuteronomy 16:9;
	Deuteronomy 16:10) In this case, the day
	meant by the Evangelist is the first of those seven sabbaths
	intervening between Passover and Pentecost. And if we are right in
	regarding the "feast" mentioned in Deuteronomy 16:10- : as a Passover, and consequently the second during our
	Lord's public ministry (see on Deuteronomy 16:10- :),
	this plucking of the ears of corn must have occurred immediately
	after the scene and the discourse recorded in Deuteronomy 16:10- :, which, doubtless, would induce our Lord to hasten His
	departure for the north, to avoid the wrath of the Pharisees, which
	He had kindled at Jerusalem. Here, accordingly, we find Him in the
	fieldsâ€”on His way probably to Galilee.
