20. A bruised reed shall he not
	break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth
	judgment unto victoryâ€”"unto truth," says the Hebrew
	original, and the Septuagint also. But our Evangelist merely
	seizes the spirit, instead of the letter of the prediction in this
	point. The grandeur and completeness of Messiah's victories would
	prove, it seems, not more wonderful than the unobtrusive
	noiselessness with which they were to be achieved. And whereas one
	rough touch will break a bruised reed, and quench the flickering,
	smoking flax, His it should be, with matchless tenderness, love, and
	skill, to lift up the meek, to strengthen the weak hands and confirm
	the feeble knees, to comfort all that mourn, to say to them that are
	of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not.
