	Gentiles trust—Part of His present audience were Gentiles—from
	Tyre and Sidon—first-fruits of the great Gentile harvest
	contemplated in the prophecy.

	Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23).
	The precise time of this section
	is uncertain. Judging from the statements with which Mark introduces
	it, we should conclude that it was when our Lord's popularity was
	approaching its zenith, and so before the feeding of the five
	thousand. But, on the other hand, the advanced state of the charges
	brought against our Lord, and the plainness of His warnings and
	denunciations in reply, seem to favor the later period at which Luke
	introduces it. "And the multitude," says Mark (Mark 3:20;
	Mark 3:21), "cometh together
	again," referring back to the immense gathering which Mark had
	before recorded (Mark 2:2) —"so
	that they could not so much as eat bread. And when His friends"—or
	rather, "relatives," as appears from Mark 2:2- :, and see on Matthew 12:1
	—"heard of it, they went out to lay hold on Him; for they
	said, He is beside Himself." Compare Matthew 12:1- :, "For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God."
