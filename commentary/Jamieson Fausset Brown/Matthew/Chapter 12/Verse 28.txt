	Spirit of God—In Luke ( :-) it is, "with (or 'by') the finger of God." This

	of God, while the former tells us the living Personal Agent

	other than the Spirit of God, then is his Destroyer already in the
	midst of you, and that kingdom which is destined to supplant his is
	already rising on its ruins."
