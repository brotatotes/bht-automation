31. Wherefore I say unto you, All
	manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men—The word
	"blasphemy" properly signifies "detraction," or
	"slander." In the New Testament it is applied, as it is
	here, to vituperation directed against God as well as against men;
	and in this sense it is to be understood as an aggravated form of
	sin. Well, says our Lord, all sin—whether in its ordinary or its
	more aggravated forms—shall find forgiveness with God. Accordingly,
	in Mark (Mark 3:28) the language
	is still stronger: "All sin shall be forgiven unto the sons of
	men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme."
	There is no sin whatever, it seems, of which it may be said, "That
	is not a pardonable sin." This glorious assurance is not to be
	limited by what follows; but, on the contrary, what follows is to be
	explained by this. 
	but the blasphemy against the
	Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.
