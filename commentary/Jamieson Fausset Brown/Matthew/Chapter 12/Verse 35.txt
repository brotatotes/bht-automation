35. A good man, out of the good
	treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good things—or, "putteth
	forth good things": 
	and an evil man, out of the
	evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things—or "putteth
	forth evil things." The word "putteth" indicates the
	spontaneity of what comes from the heart; for it is out of the
	abundance of the heart that the mouth speaketh. We have here a new
	application of a former saying (see on  :-). Here, the sentiment is, "There are but two
	kingdoms, interests, parties—with the proper workings of each: If I
	promote the one, I cannot belong to the other; but they that set
	themselves in wilful opposition to the kingdom of light openly
	proclaim to what other kingdom they belong. As for you, in what ye
	have now uttered, ye have but revealed the venomous malignity of your
	hearts."
