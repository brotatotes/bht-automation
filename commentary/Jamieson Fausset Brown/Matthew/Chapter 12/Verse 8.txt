8. For the Son of man is Lord even
	of the sabbath day—In what sense now is the Son of man Lord of
	the sabbath day? Not surely to abolish it—that surely were a
	strange lordship, especially just after saying that it was made or
	instituted for MAN—but
	to own it, to interpret it, to preside over it,
	and to ennoble it, by merging it in the "Lord's Day"
	(Revelation 1:10), breathing into it an
	air of liberty and love necessarily unknown before, and thus making
	it the nearest resemblance to the eternal sabbatism. 
	Revelation 1:10- :. THE HEALING
	OF A WITHERED HAND
	ON THE SABBATH DAY
	AND RETIREMENT OF
	JESUS TO AVOID
	DANGER. ( = Mark 3:1-12;
	Luke 6:6-11). 
	Healing of a Withered Hand
	(Matthew 12:9-14).
