	thence—but "on another sabbath" ( :-). 
	he went into their
	synagogue—"and taught." He had now, no doubt, arrived
	in Galilee; but this, it would appear, did not occur at Capernaum,
	for after it was over, He "withdrew Himelf," it is said "to
	the sea" (Mark 3:7),

	And, behold, there was a man
	which had his hand withered—disabled by paralysis (as in Mark 3:7- :). It was his right hand, as Luke (Mark 3:7- :) graphically notes. 
	And they asked him, saying,
	Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse
	him—Mark and Luke (Mark 3:2;
	Luke 6:7) say they "watched
	Him whether He would heal on the sabbath day." They were now
	come to the length of dogging His steps, to collect materials for a
	charge of impiety against Him. It is probable that it was to their
	thoughts rather than their words that Jesus addressed Himself
	in what follows.
