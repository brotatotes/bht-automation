17. For verily I say unto you, That
	many prophets and righteous men have desired—rather, "coveted."
	to see those things which ye
	see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear,
	and have not heard them—Not only were the disciples blessed
	above the blinded just spoken of, but favored above the most honored
	and the best that lived under the old economy, who had but glimpses
	of the things of the new kingdom, just sufficient to kindle in them
	desires not to be fulfilled to any in their day. In Luke 10:23;
	Luke 10:24, where the same saying
	is repeated on the return of the Seventy—the words, instead of
	"many prophets and righteous men," are "many prophets
	and kings"; for several of the Old Testament saints were
	kings. 
	Second and Seventh Parables
	or First Pair:
THE
	WHEAT AND THE TARES,
	and THE GOOD
	AND BAD FISH
	(Matthew 13:24-30; Matthew 13:36-43;
	Matthew 13:47-50). 
	The subject of both these
	parables—which teach the same truth, with a slight diversity of
	aspect—is: 
	THE
	MIXED CHARACTER OF THE
	KINGDOM IN ITS
	PRESENT STATE,
	AND THE FINAL ABSOLUTE SEPARATION OF
	THE TWO CLASSES.
	 
	The Tares and the Wheat
	(Matthew 13:24-30; Matthew 13:36-43).
