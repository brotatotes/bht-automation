30, 39. Let both grow together—that
	is, in the visible Church. 
	until the harvest—till
	the one have ripened for full salvation, the other for destruction.
	(See on Matthew 13:1). 
	and in the time of harvest I
	will say to the reapers—(See on Matthew 13:1- :). 
	Gather ye together first the
	tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them—"in the fire"
	(Matthew 13:40). 
	but gather the wheat into my
	barn—Christ, as the Judge, will separate the two classes (as in
	Matthew 25:32). It will be observed
	that the tares are burned before the wheat is housed; in the
	exposition of the parable (Matthew 13:41;
	Matthew 13:43) the same order is
	observed: and the same in Matthew 25:46
	—as if, in some literal sense, "with thine eyes shalt thou
	behold and see the reward of the wicked" (Matthew 25:46- :). 
	Third and Fourth Parables
	or Second Pair:
THE
	MUSTARD SEED
	and THE LEAVEN
	(Matthew 13:31-33). 
	The subject of both these
	parables, as of the first pair, is the same, but under a slight
	diversity of aspect, namely— 
	THE
	GROWTH OF THE KINGDOM FROM THE
	SMALLEST BEGINNINGS
	TO ULTIMATE
	UNIVERSALITY. 
	The Mustard Seed (Matthew 13:31;
	Matthew 13:32).
