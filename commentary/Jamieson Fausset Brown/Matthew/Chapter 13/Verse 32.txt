	seeds—not absolutely, but popularly and proverbially, as in  :-, "If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed,"
	that is, "never so little faith." 
	but when it is grown, it is
	the greatest among herbs—not absolutely, but in relation to the

	bruised, and is grateful to the taste of birds, which are accordingly
	attracted to its branches both for shelter and food, is it straining
	the parable, asks TRENCH,
	to suppose that, besides the wonderful growth of His kingdom,
	our Lord selected this seed to illustrate further the shelter,
	repose and blessedness it is destined to afford to the
	nations of the world?
