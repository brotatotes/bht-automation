36-38. Then Jesus sent the multitude
	away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him,
	saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field,
	&c.—In the parable of the Sower, "the seed is the word of
	God" (Luke 8:11). But here
	that word has been received into the heart, and has converted him
	that received it into a new creature, a "child of the kingdom,"
	according to that saying of James (Luke 8:11- :), "Of His own will begat He us with the word of truth,
	that we should be a kind of first-fruits of His creatures." It
	is worthy of notice that this vast field of the world is here said to
	be Christ's own—"His field," says the parable.
