46. Who, when he had found one pearl
	of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought itâ€”The
	one pearl of great price, instead of being found by accident, as in
	the former case, is found by one whose business it is to seek
	for such, and who finds it just in the way of searching for
	such treasures. But in both cases the surpassing value of the
	treasure is alike recognized, and in both all is parted with for it. 
	The Good and Bad Fish ( :-). 
	The object of this brief parable
	is the same as that of the Tares and Wheat. But as its details are
	fewer, so its teaching is less rich and varied.
