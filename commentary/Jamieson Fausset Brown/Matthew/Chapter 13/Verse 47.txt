47. Again, the kingdom of heaven is
	like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every
	kindâ€”The word here rendered "net" signifies a large
	drag-net, which draws everything after it, suffering nothing
	to escape, as distinguished from a casting-net (Mark 1:16;
	Mark 1:18). The far-reaching
	efficacy of the Gospel is thus denoted. This Gospel net "gathered
	of every kind," meaning every variety of character.
