49. So shall it be at the end of the
	world, c.—(See on Matthew 13:1).
	We have said that each of these two parables holds forth the same
	truth under a slight diversity of aspect. What is that diversity?
	First, the bad, in the former parable, are represented as vile
	seed sown among the wheat by the enemy of souls in the latter, as
	foul fish drawn forth out of the great sea of human beings by the
	Gospel net itself. Both are important truths—that the Gospel draws
	within its pale, and into the communion of the visible Church,
	multitudes who are Christians only in name; and that the injury thus
	done to the Church on earth is to be traced to the wicked one. But
	further, while the former parable gives chief prominence to the
	present mixture of good and bad, in the latter, the prominence is
	given to the future separation of the two classes.
