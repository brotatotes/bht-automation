51. Jesus saith unto themâ€”that
	is, to the Twelve. He had spoken the first four in the hearing
	of the mixed multitude: the last three He reserved till, on
	the dismissal of the mixed audience, He and the Twelve were alone ( :-, &c.). 
	Have ye understood all these
	things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
