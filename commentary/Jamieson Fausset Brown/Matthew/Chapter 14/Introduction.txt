 CHAPTER 14 
	
 :-. HEROD THINKS
	JESUS A RESURRECTION
	OF THE MURDERED
	BAPTIST—ACCOUNT
	OF HIS IMPRISONMENT
	AND DEATH. ( =
	Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9).
	The time of this alarm of Herod
	Antipas appears to have been during the mission of the Twelve, and
	shortly after the Baptist—who had been in prison for probably more
	than a year—had been cruelly put to death. 
	Herod's Theory of the Works of
	Christ (Matthew 14:1; Matthew 14:2).
