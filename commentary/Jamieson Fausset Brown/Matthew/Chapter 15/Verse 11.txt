11. Not that which goeth into the
	mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this
	defileth a manâ€”This is expressed even more emphatically in Mark
	(Mark 7:15; Mark 7:16),
	and it is there added, "If any man have ears to hear, let him
	hear." As in Matthew 13:9, this
	so oft-repeated saying seems designed to call attention to the
	fundamental and universal character of the truth it
	refers to.
