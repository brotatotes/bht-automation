16. And Simon Peter answered and
	said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God—He does
	not say, "Scribes and Pharisees, rulers and people, are all
	perplexed; and shall we, unlettered fishermen, presume to decide?"
	But feeling the light of his Master's glory shining in his soul, he
	breaks forth—not in a tame, prosaic acknowledgment, "I
	believe that Thou art," c.—but in the language of
	adoration—such as one uses in worship, "THOU
	ART THE CHRIST,
	THE SON OF THE
	LIVING GOD!"
	He first owns Him the promised Messiah (see on  :-) then he rises higher, echoing the voice from heaven—"This
	is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased"; and in the
	important addition—"Son of the LIVING
	GOD"—he recognizes
	the essential and eternal life of God as in this His Son—though
	doubtless without that distinct perception afterwards vouchsafed.
