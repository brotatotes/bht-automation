17. And Jesus answered and said unto
	him, Blessed art thou—Though it is not to be doubted that
	Peter, in this noble testimony to Christ, only expressed the
	conviction of all the Twelve, yet since he alone seems to have had
	clear enough apprehensions to put that conviction in proper and
	suitable words, and courage enough to speak them out, and readiness
	enough to do this at the right time—so he only, of all the Twelve,
	seems to have met the present want, and communicated to the saddened

	encourage His timid believing ones with the assurance that He was
	theirs, and teach themselves to call Him so—or, as here, "My
	Father," to signify some peculiar action or aspect of Him as
	"the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
