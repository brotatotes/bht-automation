25. For whosoever will save—is
	minded to save, or bent on saving. 
	his life shall lose it, and
	whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it—(See on
	Matthew 16:1). "A suffering
	and dying Messiah liketh you ill; but what if His servants shall meet
	the same fate? They may not; but who follows Me must be prepared for
	the worst."
