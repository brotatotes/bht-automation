10. Take heed that ye
	despise—stumble. 
	not one of these little ones;
	for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the
	face of my Father which is in heaven—A difficult verse; but
	perhaps the following may be more than an illustration:—Among men,
	those who nurse and rear the royal children, however humble in
	themselves, are allowed free entrance with their charge, and a degree
	of familiarity which even the highest state ministers dare not
	assume. Probably our Lord means that, in virtue of their charge over
	His disciples (Hebrews 1:13; John 1:51),
	the angels have errands to the throne, a welcome there,
	and a dear familiarity in dealing with "His Father which
	is in heaven," which on their own matters they could not assume.
