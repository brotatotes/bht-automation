15. Moreover, if thy brother shall
	trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him
	alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother,
	c.—Probably our Lord had reference still to the late dispute, Who
	should be the greatest? After the rebuke—so gentle and captivating,
	yet so dignified and divine—under which they would doubtless be
	smarting, perhaps each would be saying, It was not I that
	began it, it was not I that threw out unworthy and irritating
	insinuations against my brethren. Be it so, says our Lord but as such
	things will often arise, I will direct you how to proceed. First,
	Neither harbor a grudge against your offending brother, nor break
	forth upon him in presence of the unbelieving; but take him aside,
	show him his fault, and if he own and make reparation for it, you
	have done more service to him than even justice to yourself. Next,
	If this fail, take two or three to witness how just your complaint
	is, and how brotherly your spirit in dealing with him. Again,
	If this fail, bring him before the Church or congregation to which
	both belong. Lastly, If even this fail, regard him as no
	longer a brother Christian, but as one "without"—as the
	Jews did Gentiles and publicans.
