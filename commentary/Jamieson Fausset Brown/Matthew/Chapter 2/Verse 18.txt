18. In Rama was there a voice heard,
	lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her
	children, and would not be comforted, because they are not—These
	words, as they stand in Jeremiah, undoubtedly relate to the
	Babylonish captivity. Rachel, the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, was
	buried in the neighborhood of Bethlehem ( :-), where her sepulchre is still shown. She is figuratively
	represented as rising from the tomb and uttering a double lament for
	the loss of her children—first, by a bitter captivity, and now by a
	bloody death. And a foul deed it was. O ye mothers of Bethlehem!
	methinks I hear you asking why your innocent babes should be the ram
	caught in the thicket, while Isaac escapes. I cannot tell you, but
	one thing I know, that ye shall, some of you, live to see a day when
	that Babe of Bethlehem shall be Himself the Ram, caught in another
	sort of thicket, in order that your babes may escape a worse doom
	than they now endure. And if these babes of yours be now in glory,
	through the dear might of that blessed Babe, will they not deem it
	their honor that the tyrant's rage was exhausted upon themselves
	instead of their infant Lord?
