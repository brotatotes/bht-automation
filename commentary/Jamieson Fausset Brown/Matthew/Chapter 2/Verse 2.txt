2. Saying, Where is he that is born
	King of the Jews?—From this it would seem they were not
	themselves Jews. (Compare the language of the Roman governor,  :-, and of the Roman soldiers,  :-, with the very different language of the Jews themselves,
	Matthew 27:42, c.). The Roman
	historians, SUETONIUS and
	TACITUS, bear witness to
	an expectation, prevalent in the East, that out of Judea should arise
	a sovereign of the world. 
	for we have seen his star in
	the east—Much has been written on the subject of this star but
	from all that is here said it is perhaps safest to regard it as
	simply a luminous meteor, which appeared under special laws and for a
	special purpose. 
	and are come to worship
	him—to do Him homage, as the word signifies; the nature of that
	homage depending on the circumstances of the case. That not civil but
	religious homage is meant here is plain from the whole strain of the
	narrative, and particularly Matthew 27:42- :. Doubtless these simple strangers expected all Jerusalem to
	be full of its new-born King, and the time, place, and circumstances
	of His birth to be familiar to every one. Little would they think
	that the first announcement of His birth would come from themselves,
	and still less could they anticipate the startling, instead of
	transporting, effect which it would produce—else they would
	probably have sought their information regarding His birthplace in
	some other quarter. But God overruled it to draw forth a noble
	testimony to the predicted birthplace of Messiah from the highest
	ecclesiastical authority in the nation.
