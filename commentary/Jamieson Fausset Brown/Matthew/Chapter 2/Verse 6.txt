6. And thou, Bethlehem, in
	the land of Juda—the "in" being familiarly left out,
	as we say, "London, Middlesex." 
	art not the least among the
	princes of Judah: for out of thee shall come a Governor, c.—This
	quotation, though differing verbally, agrees substantially with the
	Hebrew and the Septuagint. For says the prophet,
	"Though thou be little, yet out of thee shall come the
	Ruler"—this honor more than compensating for its natural
	insignificance while our Evangelist, by a lively turn, makes him say,
	"Thou art not the least: for out of thee shall come a
	Governor"—this distinction lifting it from the lowest to the
	highest rank. The "thousands of Juda," in the prophet, mean
	the subordinate divisions of the tribe: our Evangelist, instead of
	these, merely names the "princes" or heads of these
	families, including the districts which they occupied.

	"feed," as in the Margin.
my people Israel—In the
	Old Testament, kings are, by a beautiful figure, styled "shepherds"
	(Ezekiel 34:1-10, c.). The
	classical writers use the same figure. The pastoral rule of Jehovah
	and Messiah over His people is a representation pervading all
	Scripture, and rich in import. (See Psalms 23:1-6
Isaiah 40:11; Ezekiel 37:24;
	John 10:11; Revelation 7:17).
	That this prophecy of Micah referred to the Messiah, was admitted by
	the ancient Rabbins.

	Home by Another Way (Revelation 7:17- :).
