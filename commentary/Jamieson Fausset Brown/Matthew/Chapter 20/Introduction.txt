 CHAPTER 20 
	
 :-. PARABLE OF THE
	LABORERS IN THE VINEYARD.
	 
	This parable, recorded only by
	Matthew, is closely connected with the  :-, being spoken with reference to Peter's
	question as to how it should fare with those who, like himself, had
	left all for Christ. It is designed to show that while they
	would be richly rewarded, a certain equity would still be observed
	towards later converts and workmen in His service.
