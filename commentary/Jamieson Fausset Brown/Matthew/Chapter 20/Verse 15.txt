15. Is it not lawful for me to do
	what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?â€”that
	is, "You appeal to justice, and by that your mouth is
	shut; for the sum you agreed for is paid you. Your case being
	disposed of, with the terms I make with other laborers you have
	nothing to do; and to grudge the benevolence shown to others, when by
	your own admission you have been honorably dealt with, is both
	unworthy envy of your neighbor, and discontent with the goodness that
	engaged and rewarded you in his service at all."
