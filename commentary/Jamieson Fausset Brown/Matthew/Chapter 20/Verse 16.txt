16. So the last shall be first, and
	the first last—that is, "Take heed lest by indulging the
	spirit of these murmurers at the penny given to the last hired, ye
	miss your own penny, though first in the vineyard; while the
	consciousness of having come in so late may inspire these last with
	such a humble frame, and such admiration of the grace that has hired
	and rewarded them at all, as will put them into the foremost place in
	the end." 
	for many be called, but few
	chosen—This is another of our Lord's terse and pregnant
	sayings, more than once uttered in different connections. (See
	Matthew 19:30; Matthew 22:14).
	The "calling" of which the New Testament almost invariably
	speaks is what divines call effectual calling, carrying with
	it a supernatural operation on the will to secure its consent. But
	that cannot be the meaning of it here; the "called" being
	emphatically distinguished from the "chosen." It can only
	mean here the "invited." And so the sense is, Many receive
	the invitations of the Gospel whom God has never "chosen to
	salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
	truth" (2 Thessalonians 2:13). But
	what, it may be asked, has this to do with the subject of our
	parable? Probably this—to teach us that men who have wrought in
	Christ's service all their days may, by the spirit which they
	manifest at the last, make it too evident that, as between God and
	their own souls, they never were chosen workmen at all.
