31. Whether of them twain did the
	will of his Father? They say unto him, The first—Now comes the
	application. 
	Jesus saith unto them, Verily
	I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go—or, "are
	going"; even now entering, while ye hold back. 
	into the kingdom of God
	before you—The publicans and the harlots were the first son,
	who, when told to work in the Lord's vineyard, said, I will not; but
	afterwards repented and went. Their early life was a flat and
	flagrant refusal to do what they were commanded; it was one continued
	rebellion against the authority of God. The chief priests and the
	elders of the people, with whom our Lord was now speaking, were the
	second son, who said, I go, sir, but went not. They were early
	called, and all their life long professed obedience to God, but never
	rendered it; their life was one of continued disobedience.
