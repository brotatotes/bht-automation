11. And when the king came in to see
	the guests—Solemn expression this, of that omniscient
	inspection of every professed disciple of the Lord Jesus from age
	to age, in virtue of which his true character will hereafter be
	judicially proclaimed! 
	he saw there a man—This
	shows that it is the judgment of individuals which is intended
	in this latter part of the parable: the first part represents rather
	national judgment. 
	which had not on a wedding
	garment—The language here is drawn from the following
	remarkable passage in Zephaniah 1:7;
	Zephaniah 1:8: —"Hold thy peace
	at the presence of the Lord God; for the day of the Lord is at hand:
	for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, He hath bid His guests. And
	it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice, that I will
	punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are
	clothed with strange apparel." The custom in the East of
	presenting festival garments (see Genesis 45:22;
	2 Kings 5:22), even though nor
	clearly proved, Is certainly presupposed here. It undoubtedly means
	something which they bring not of their own—for how could they have
	any such dress who were gathered in from the highways
	indiscriminately?—but which they receive as their
	appropriate dress. And what can that be but what is meant by "putting
	on the Lord Jesus," as "THE
	LORD OUR
	RIGHTEOUSNESS?" (See
	Psalms 45:13; Psalms 45:14).
	Nor could such language be strange to those in whose ears had so long
	resounded those words of prophetic joy: "I will greatly rejoice
	in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He hath clothed
	me with the garments of salvation, He hath covered me with the robe
	of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and
	as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels" (Psalms 45:14- :).
