13. Then said the king to the
	servants—the angelic ministers of divine vengeance (as in  :-). 
	Bind him hand and
	foot—putting it out of his power to resist. 
	and take him away, and cast
	him into outer darkness—So Matthew 8:12;
	Matthew 25:30. The expression is
	emphatic—"the darkness which is outside." To be "outside"
	at all—or, in the language of Matthew 25:30- :, to be "without" the heavenly city,
	excluded from its joyous nuptials and gladsome festivities—is sad
	enough of itself, without anything else. But to find themselves not
	only excluded from the brightness and glory and joy and felicity of
	the kingdom above, but thrust into a region of "darkness,"
	with all its horrors, this is the dismal retribution here announced,
	that awaits the unworthy at the great day. 
	there—in that region
	and condition. 
	shall be weeping and gnashing
	of teeth. See on Matthew 22:1.
