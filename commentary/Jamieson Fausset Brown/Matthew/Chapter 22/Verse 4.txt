4. my oxen and my fatlings are
	killed, and all things are ready; come unto the marriageâ€”This
	points to those Gospel calls after Christ's death,
	resurrection, ascension, and effusion of the Spirit, to which the
	parable could not directly allude, but when only it could be said,
	with strict propriety, "that all things were ready."
	Compare 1 Corinthians 5:7; 1 Corinthians 5:8,
	"Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us; therefore, let us
	keep the feast"; also 1 Corinthians 5:8- :, "I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if
	any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread
	which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the
	world."
