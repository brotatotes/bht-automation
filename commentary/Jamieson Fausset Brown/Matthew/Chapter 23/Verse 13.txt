13. But woe unto you, scribes and
	Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against
	men—Here they are charged with shutting heaven against
	men: in Luke 11:52 they are
	charged with what was worse, taking away the key—"the
	key of knowledge"—which means, not the key to open knowledge,
	but knowledge as the only key to open heaven. A right knowledge of
	God's revealed word is eternal life, as our Lord says (John 17:3;
	John 5:39); but this they took
	away from the people, substituting for it their wretched traditions.
