15. Woe unto you, scribes and
	Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one
	proselyte—from heathenism. We have evidence of this in
	JOSEPHUS. 
	and when he is made, ye make
	him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves—condemned,
	for the hypocrisy he would learn to practice, both by the religion he
	left and that he embraced.
