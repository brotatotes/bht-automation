23. Woe unto you, scribes and
	Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise—rather,
	"dill," as in Margin.
and cummin—In Luke ( :-) it is "and rue, and all manner of herbs." They
	grounded this practice on Leviticus 27:30,
	which they interpreted rigidly. Our Lord purposely names the most
	trifling products of the earth as examples of what they punctiliously
	exacted the tenth of. 
	and have omitted the
	weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith—In
	Luke (Luke 11:42) it is
	"judgment, mercy, and the love of God"—the expression
	being probably varied by our Lord Himself on the two different
	occasions. In both His reference is to Luke 11:42- :, where the prophet makes all acceptable religion to consist
	of three elements—"doing justly, loving mercy, and walking
	humbly with our God"; which third element presupposes and
	comprehends both the "faith" of Matthew and the "love"
	of Luke. See on Luke 11:42- :; Luke 11:42- :. The same tendency to merge greater duties in less
	besets even the children of God; but it is the characteristic of
	hypocrites.
these ought ye to have done,
	and not to leave the other undone—There is no need for one set
	of duties to jostle out another; but it is to be carefully noted that
	of the greater duties our Lord says, "Ye ought to have
	done" them, while of the lesser He merely says, "Ye
	ought not to leave them undone."
