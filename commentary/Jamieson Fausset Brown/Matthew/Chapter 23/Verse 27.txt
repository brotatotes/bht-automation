27. Woe unto you, scribes and
	Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whited sepulchres—or,
	whitewashed sepulchres. (Compare  :-). The process of whitewashing the sepulchres, as LIGHTFOOT
	says, was performed on a certain day every year, not for ceremonial
	cleansing, but, as the following words seem rather to imply, to
	beautify them. 
	which indeed appear beautiful
	outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all
	uncleanness—What a powerful way of conveying the charge, that
	with all their fair show their hearts were full of corruption!
	(Compare Psalms 5:9; Romans 3:13).
	But our Lord, stripping off the figure, next holds up their iniquity
	in naked colors. 
	Wherefore ye be witnesses
	unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the
	prophets—that is, "ye be witnesses that ye have inherited,
	and voluntarily served yourselves heirs to, the truth-hating,
	prophet-killing, spirit of your fathers." Out of pretended
	respect and honor, they repaired and beautified the sepulchres of the
	prophets, and with whining hypocrisy said, "If we had been in
	their days, how differently should we have treated these prophets?"
	While all the time they were witnesses to themselves that they were
	the children of them that killed the prophets, convicting themselves
	daily of as exact a resemblance in spirit and character to the very
	classes over whose deeds they pretended to mourn, as child to parent.
	In Luke 11:44 our Lord gives
	another turn to this figure of a grave: "Ye are as graves which
	appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them."
	As one might unconsciously walk over a grave concealed from view, and
	thus contract ceremonial defilement, so the plausible exterior of the
	Pharisees kept people from perceiving the pollution they contracted
	from coming in contact with such corrupt characters.
