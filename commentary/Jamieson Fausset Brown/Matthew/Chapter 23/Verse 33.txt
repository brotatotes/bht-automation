33. Ye serpents, ye generation of
	vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?â€”In thus, at
	the end of His ministry, recalling the words of the Baptist at the
	outset of his, our Lord would seem to intimate that the only
	difference between their condemnation now and then was, that now they
	were ripe for their doom, which they were not then.
