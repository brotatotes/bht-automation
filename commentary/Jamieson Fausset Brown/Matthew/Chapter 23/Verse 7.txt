7. And greetings in the markets, and
	to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbiâ€”It is the spirit
	rather than the letter of this that must be pressed; though
	the violation of the letter, springing from spiritual pride, has done
	incalculable evil in the Church of Christ. The reiteration of the
	word "Rabbi" shows how it tickled the ear and fed the
	spiritual pride of those ecclesiastics.
