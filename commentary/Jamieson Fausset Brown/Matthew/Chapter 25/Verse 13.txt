13. Watch therefore; for ye know
	neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh—This,
	the moral or practical lesson of the whole parable, needs no comment.
	 :-. PARABLE OF THE
	TALENTS. 
	This parable, while closely
	resembling it, is yet a different one from that of THE
	POUNDS, in  :-; though CALVIN,
	OLSHAUSEN, MEYER,
	and others identify them—but not DE
	WETTE and NEANDER.
	For the difference between the two parables, see the  :- on that of The Pounds. While, as TRENCH
	observes with his usual felicity, "the virgins were represented
	as waiting for their Lord, we have the servants working
	for Him; there the inward spiritual life of the faithful was
	described; here his external activity. It is not, therefore,
	without good reason that they appear in their actual order—that of
	the Virgins first, and of the Talents following—since it is the
	sole condition of a profitable outward activity for the kingdom of
	God, that the life of God be diligently maintained within the heart."
