14. For the kingdom of
	heaven is as a man—The ellipsis is better supplied
	by our translators in the corresponding passage of Mark ( :-), "[For the Son of man is] as a man," c., 
	travelling into a far

	who called his own servants,
	and delivered unto them his goods—Between master and slaves
	this was not uncommon in ancient times. Christ's "servants"
	here mean all who, by their Christian profession, stand in the
	relation to Him of entire subjection. His "goods" mean all
	their gifts and endowments, whether original or acquired, natural or
	spiritual. As all that slaves have belongs to their master, so Christ
	has a claim to everything which belongs to His people, everything
	which, may be turned to good, and He demands its appropriation to His
	service, or, viewing it otherwise, they first offer it up to Him as
	being "not their own, but bought with a price" (1 Corinthians 6:19;
	1 Corinthians 6:20), and He "delivers
	it to them" again to be put to use in His service.
