20. Lord, thou deliveredst unto me
	five talents; behold, I have gained besides them five talents
	moreâ€”How beautifully does this illustrate what the beloved
	disciple says of "boldness in the day of judgment," and his
	desire that "when He shall appear we may have confidence, and
	not be ashamed before Him at His coming!" (1 John 4:17;
	1 John 2:28).
