22. He also that had received two
	talents came . . . good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful
	over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things—Both
	are commended in the same terms, and the reward of both is precisely
	the same. (See on Matthew 25:2).
	Observe also the contrasts: "Thou hast been faithful as a
	servant; now be a ruler—thou hast been entrusted
	with a few things; now have dominion over many
	things." 
	enter thou into the joy of
	thy lord—thy Lord's own joy. (See John 15:11;
	Hebrews 12:2).
