	title, here for the first and only time, save in parabolical

	inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
	world—The whole story of this their blessedness is given by the
	apostle, in words which seem but an expression of these: "Blessed
	be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
	with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according
	as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that
	we should be holy and without blame before Him in love." They
	were chosen from everlasting to the possession and enjoyment of all
	spiritual blessings in Christ, and so chosen in order to be holy and
	blameless in love. This is the holy love whose practical
	manifestations the King is about to recount in detail; and thus we
	see that their whole life of love to Christ is the fruit of an
	eternal purpose of love to them in Christ.
