	on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, &c.—As for you
	on the left hand, ye did nothing for Me. I came to you also, but ye
	knew Me not: ye had neither warm affections nor kind deeds to bestow
	upon Me: I was as one despised in your eyes." "In our
	eyes, Lord? We never saw Thee before, and never, sure, behaved we so
	to Thee." "But thus ye treated these little ones that
	believe in Me and now stand on My right hand. In the disguise of
	these poor members of Mine I came soliciting your pity, but ye shut
	up your bowels of compassion from Me: I asked relief, but ye had none
	to give Me. Take back therefore your own coldness, your own
	contemptuous distance: Ye bid Me away from your presence, and now I
	bid you from Mine—Depart from Me, ye cursed!"
