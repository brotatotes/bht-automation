9. But the wise answered, Not
	so; lest there be not enough for us and you—The
	words "Not so," it will be seen, are not in the original,
	where the reply is very elliptical—"In case there be not
	enough for us and you." A truly wise answer this. "And
	what, then, if we shall share it with you? Why, both will be undone."
	but go ye rather to them that
	sell, and buy for yourselves—Here again it would be straining
	the parable beyond its legitimate design to make it teach that men
	may get salvation even after they are supposed and required to have
	it already gotten. It is merely a friendly way of reminding them of
	the proper way of obtaining the needed and precious article, with a
	certain reflection on them for having it now to seek. Also, when the
	parable speaks of "selling" and "buying" that
	valuable article, it means simply, "Go, get it in the only
	legitimate way." And yet the word "buy" is
	significant; for we are elsewhere bidden, "buy wine and milk
	without money and without price," and "buy of Christ gold
	tried in the fire," c. (Isaiah 55:1
Revelation 3:18). Now, since what we pay
	the demanded price for becomes thereby our own property, the
	salvation which we thus take gratuitously at God's hands, being
	bought in His own sense of that word, becomes ours thereby in
	inalienable possession. (Compare for the language, Proverbs 23:23;
	Matthew 13:44).
