16. Then the eleven disciples went
	away into Galilee—but certainly not before the second week
	after the resurrection, and probably somewhat later. 
	into a mountain where Jesus
	had appointed them—It should have been rendered "the
	mountain," meaning some certain mountain which He had named to
	them—probably the night before He suffered, when He said, "After
	I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee" (Matthew 26:32;
	Mark 14:28). What it was can only
	be conjectured; but of the two between which opinions are divided—the
	Mount of the Beatitudes or Mount Tabor—the former is much the more
	probable, from its nearness to the Sea of Tiberias, where last before
	this the Narrative tells us that He met and dined with seven of them.
	(John 21:1, c.). That the
	interview here recorded was the same as that referred to in one place
	only— 1 Corinthians 15:6 —when "He
	was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater
	part remained unto that day, though some were fallen asleep," is
	now the opinion of the ablest students of the evangelical history.
	Nothing can account for such a number as five hundred assembling at
	one spot but the expectation of some promised manifestation of their
	risen Lord: and the promise before His resurrection, twice repeated
	after it, best explains this immense gathering.
