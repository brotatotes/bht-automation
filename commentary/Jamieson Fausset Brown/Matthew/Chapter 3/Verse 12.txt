12. Whose fan—winnowing fan. 
	is in his hand—ready
	for use. This is no other than the preaching of the Gospel, even now
	beginning, the effect of which would be to separate the solid from
	the spiritually worthless, as wheat, by the winnowing fan, from the
	chaff. (Compare the similar representation in  :-). 
	and he will throughly purge
	his floor—threshing-floor; that is, the visible Church. 
	and gather his wheat—His
	true-hearted saints; so called for their solid worth (compare Amos 9:9;
	Luke 22:31). 
	into the garner—"the
	kingdom of their Father," as this "garner" or "barn"
	is beautifully explained by our Lord in the parable of the wheat and
	the tares (Matthew 13:30; Matthew 13:43).
	but he will burn up the
	chaff—empty, worthless professors of religion, void of all
	solid religious principle and character (see Matthew 13:43- :). 
	with unquenchable
	fire—Singular is the strength of this apparent contradiction of
	figures:—to be burnt up, but with a fire that is unquenchable; the
	one expressing the utter destruction of all that constitutes
	one's true life, the other the continued consciousness of
	existence in that awful condition. 
	 Luke adds the
	following important particulars (Matthew 13:43- :): 
	 Matthew 13:43- :: 
	 And
	many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
people
—showing that we have here but an
	abstract of his teaching. Besides what we read in John 1:29;
	John 1:33; John 1:34;
	John 3:27-36, the incidental
	allusion to his having taught his disciples to pray (John 3:27-43.3.36- :) —of which not a word is said elsewhere—shows how varied
	his teaching was. 
	 John 3:27-43.3.36- :: 
	 But
	Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
brother Philip's wife, and for
	all the evils which Herod had
done
—In this last clause we have an
	important fact, here only mentioned, showing how thoroughgoing
	was the fidelity of the Baptist to his royal hearer, and how strong
	must have been the workings of conscience in that slave of passion
	when, notwithstanding such plainness, he "did many things, and
	heard John gladly" (Mark 6:20).
	
	 Mark 6:20- :: 
	Added
	yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison
—This imprisonment of John, however,
	did not take place for some time after this; and it is here recorded
	merely because the Evangelist did not intend to recur to his history
	till he had occasion to relate the message which he sent to Christ
	from his prison at Machærus (Mark 6:20- :, c.). 
	Mark 6:20- :. BAPTISM OF
	CHRIST AND DESCENT
	OF THE SPIRIT UPON
	HIM IMMEDIATELY
	THEREAFTER. ( = Mark 1:9-11
Luke 3:21; Luke 3:22;
	John 1:31-34).
