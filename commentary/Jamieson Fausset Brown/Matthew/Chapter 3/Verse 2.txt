2. And saying, Repent ye—Though
	the word strictly denotes a change of mind, it has respect
	here (and wherever it is used in connection with salvation) primarily
	to that sense of sin which leads the sinner to flee from the
	wrath to come, to look for relief only from above, and eagerly to
	fall in with the provided remedy. 
	for the kingdom of heaven is
	at hand—This sublime phrase, used in none of the other Gospels,
	occurs in this peculiarly Jewish Gospel nearly thirty times; and
	being suggested by Daniel's grand vision of the Son of man coming in
	the clouds of heaven to the Ancient of days, to receive His
	investiture in a world-wide kingdom (Daniel 7:13;
	Daniel 7:14), it was fitted at once
	both to meet the national expectations and to turn them into the
	right channel. A kingdom for which repentance was the proper
	preparation behooved to be essentially spiritual. Deliverance from
	sin, the great blessing of Christ's kingdom (Daniel 7:14- :), can be valued by those only to whom sin is a burden (Daniel 7:14- :). John's great work, accordingly, was to awaken this feeling
	and hold out the hope of a speedy and precious remedy.
