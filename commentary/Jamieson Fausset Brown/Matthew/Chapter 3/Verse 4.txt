4. And the same John had his raiment
	of camel's hair—woven of it. 
	and a leathern girdle about
	his loins—the prophetic dress of Elijah ( :-; and see Zechariah 13:4). 
	and his meat was locusts—the
	great, well-known Eastern locust, a food of the poor (Zechariah 13:4- :). 
	and wild honey—made by
	wild bees (1 Samuel 14:25; 1 Samuel 14:26).
	This dress and diet, with the shrill cry in the wilderness, would
	recall the stern days of Elijah.
