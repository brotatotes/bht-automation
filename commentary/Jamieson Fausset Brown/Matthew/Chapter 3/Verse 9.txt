	yourselves, We have Abraham to our father—that pillow on which
	the nation so fatally reposed, that rock on which at length it split.

	is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham—that
	is, "Flatter not yourselves with the fond delusion that God
	stands in need of you, to make good His promise of a seed to Abraham;
	for I tell you that, though you were all to perish, God is as able to
	raise up a seed to Abraham out of those stones as He was to take
	Abraham himself out of the rock whence he was hewn, out of the hole
	of the pit whence he was digged" ( :-). Though the stern speaker may have pointed as he spoke to
	the pebbles of the bare clay hills that lay around (so STANLEY'S
	Sinai and Palestine), it was clearly the calling of the
	Gentiles—at that time stone-dead in their sins, and quite as
	unconscious of it—into the room of unbelieving and disinherited
	Israel that he meant thus to indicate (see Matthew 21:43;
	Romans 11:20; Romans 11:30).
