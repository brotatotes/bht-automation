15. The land of Zabulon, and the
	land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea—the
	coast skirting the Sea of Galilee westward—beyond Jordan—a phrase
	commonly meaning eastward of Jordan; but here and in several places
	it means westward of the Jordan. The word seems to have got the
	general meaning of "the other side"; the nature of the case
	determining which side that was. 
	Galilee of the Gentiles—so
	called from its position, which made it the frontier between the Holy
	Land and the external world. While Ephraim and Judah, as STANLEY
	says, were separated from the world by the Jordan valley on one side
	and the hostile Philistines on another, the northern tribes were in
	the direct highway of all the invaders from the north, in unbroken
	communication with the promiscuous races who have always occupied the
	heights of Lebanon, and in close and peaceful alliance with the most
	commercial nation of the ancient world, the Phoelignicians. Twenty of
	the cities of Galilee were actually annexed by Solomon to the
	adjacent kingdom of Tyre, and formed, with their territory, the
	"boundary" or "offscouring" (Gebul or
	Cabul) of the two dominions—at a later time still known by
	the general name of "the boundaries (coasts or borders) of Tyre
	and Sidon." In the first great transportation of the Jewish
	population, Naphtali and Galilee suffered the same fate as the
	trans-jordanic tribes before Ephraim or Judah had been molested ( :-). In the time of the Christian era this original
	disadvantage of their position was still felt; the speech of the
	Galileans "bewrayed them" by its uncouth pronunciation ( :-); and their distance from the seats of government and
	civilization at Jerusalem and Cæsarea gave them their character for
	turbulence or independence, according as it was viewed by their
	friends or their enemies.
