17. From that time Jesus began to
	preach, and to say, Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand—Thus
	did our Lord not only take up the strain, but give forth the
	identical summons of His honored forerunner. Our Lord sometimes
	speaks of the new kingdom as already come—in His own Person and
	ministry; but the economy of it was only "at hand"
	until the blood of the cross was shed, and the Spirit on the day of
	Pentecost opened the fountain for sin and for uncleanness to the
	world at large. 
	Calling of Peter and Andrew
