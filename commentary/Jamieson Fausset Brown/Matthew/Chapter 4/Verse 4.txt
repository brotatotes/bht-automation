4. But he answered and said, It is
	written— (Deuteronomy 8:3). 
	Man shall not live by bread
	alone—more emphatically, as in the Greek, "Not by
	bread alone shall man live." 
	but by every word that
	proceedeth out of the mouth of God—Of all passages in Old
	Testament Scripture, none could have been pitched upon more apposite,
	perhaps not one so apposite, to our Lord's purpose. "The Lord .
	. . led thee (said Moses to Israel, at the close of their
	journeyings) these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and
	to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest
	keep His commandments, or no. And He humbled thee, and suffered thee
	to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither
	did thy fathers know; that He might make thee know that man doth not
	live by bread only," &c., "Now, if Israel spent, not
	forty days, but forty years in a waste, howling wilderness, where
	there were no means of human subsistence, not starving, but divinely
	provided for, on purpose to prove to every age that human support
	depends not upon bread, but upon God's unfailing word of promise and
	pledge of all needful providential care, am I, distrusting this word
	of God, and despairing of relief, to take the law into My own hand?
	True, the Son of God is able enough to turn stones into bread: but
	what the Son of God is able to do is not the present question, but
	what is man's duty under want of the necessaries of life. And
	as Israel's condition in the wilderness did not justify their
	unbelieving murmurings and frequent desperation, so neither would
	Mine warrant the exercise of the power of the Son of God in snatching
	despairingly at unwarranted relief. As man, therefore, I will await
	divine supply, nothing doubting that at the fitting time it will
	arrive." The second temptation in this Gospel is in
	Luke's the third. That Matthew's order is the right one will
	appear, we think, quite clearly in the sequel.
