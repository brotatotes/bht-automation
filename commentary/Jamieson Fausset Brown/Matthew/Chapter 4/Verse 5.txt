5. Then the devil taketh him
	up—rather, "conducteth Him." 
	into the holy city—so
	called (as in Isaiah 48:2; Nehemiah 11:1)
	from its being "the city of the Great King," the seat of
	the temple, the metropolis of all Jewish worship. 
	and setteth him on a pinnacle
	of the temple—rather, "the pinnacle"—a certain
	well-known projection. Whether this refers to the highest summit of
	the temple, which bristled with golden spikes [JOSEPHUS,
	Antiquities, 5.5,6]; or whether it refers to another peak, on
	Herod's royal portico, overhanging the ravine of Kedron, at the
	valley of Hinnom—an immense tower built on the very edge of this
	precipice, from the top of which dizzy height JOSEPHUS
	says one could not look to the bottom [Antiquities,
	15.11,5]—is not certain; but the latter is probably meant.
