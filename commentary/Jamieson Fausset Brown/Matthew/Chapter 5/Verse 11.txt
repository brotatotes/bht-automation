11. Blessed are ye when men shall
	revile you—or abuse you to your face, in opposition to
	backbiting. (See Mark 15:32). 
	and persecute you, and shall
	say all manner of evil against you, falsely, for my sake—Observe
	this. He had before said, "for righteousness' sake." Here
	He identifies Himself and His cause with that of righteousness,
	binding up the cause of righteousness in the world with the reception
	of Himself. Would Moses, or David, or Isaiah, or Paul have so
	expressed themselves? Never. Doubtless they suffered for
	righteousness' sake. But to have called this "their sake,"
	would, as every one feels, have been very unbecoming. Whereas He that
	speaks, being Righteousness incarnate (see Mark 1:24;
	Acts 3:14; Revelation 3:7),
	when He so speaks, speaks only like Himself.
