12. Rejoice, and be exceeding
	glad—"exult." In the corresponding passage of Luke
	(Luke 6:22; Luke 6:23),
	where every indignity trying to flesh and blood is held forth as the
	probable lot of such as were faithful to Him, the word is even
	stronger than here: "leap," as if He would have their
	inward transport to overpower and absorb the sense of all these
	affronts and sufferings; nor will anything else do it. 
	for great is your reward in
	heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
	you:—that is, "You do but serve yourselves heirs to their
	character and sufferings, and the reward will be common."
