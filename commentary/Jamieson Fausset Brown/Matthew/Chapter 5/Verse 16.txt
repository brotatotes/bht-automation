16. Let your light so shine before
	men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which
	is in heavenâ€”As nobody lights a lamp only to cover it up, but
	places it so conspicuously as to give light to all who need light, so
	Christians, being the light of the world, instead of hiding their
	light, are so to hold it forth before men that they may see what a
	life the disciples of Christ lead, and seeing this, may glorify their
	Father for so redeeming, transforming, and ennobling earth's sinful
	children, and opening to themselves the way to like redemption and
	transformation.
