25. Agree with thine adversary—thine
	opponent in a matter cognizable by law. 
	quickly, whiles thou art in
	the way with him—"to the magistrate," as in  :-. 
	lest at any time—here,
	rather, "lest at all," or simply "lest." 
	the adversary deliver thee to
	the judge, and the judge—having pronounced thee in the wrong. 
	deliver thee to the
	officer—the official whose business it is to see the sentence
	carried into effect.
