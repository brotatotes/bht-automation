29. And if thy right eye—the
	readier and the dearer of the two. 
	offend thee—be a "trap
	spring," or as in the New Testament, be "an occasion of
	stumbling" to thee. 
	pluck it out and cast it from
	thee—implying a certain indignant promptitude, heedless of
	whatever cost to feeling the act may involve. Of course, it is not
	the eye simply of which our Lord speaks—as if execution were
	to be done upon the bodily organ—though there have been fanatical
	ascetics who have both advocated and practiced this, showing a very
	low apprehension of spiritual things—but the offending eye,
	or the eye considered as the occasion of sin; and consequently, only
	the sinful exercise of the organ which is meant. For as one
	might put out his eyes without in the least quenching the lust to
	which they ministered, so, "if thine eye be single, thy whole
	body shall be full of light," and, when directed by a holy mind,
	becomes an "instrument of righteousness unto God." At the
	same time, just as by cutting off a hand, or plucking out an eye, the
	power of acting and of seeing would be destroyed, our Lord
	certainly means that we are to strike at the root of such
	unholy dispositions, as well as cut off the occasions which tend to
	stimulate them. 
	for it is profitable for thee
	that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body
	should be cast into hell—He who despises the warning to cast
	from him, with indignant promptitude, an offending member, will find
	his whole body "cast," with a retributive promptitude of
	indignation, "into hell." Sharp language, this, from the
	lips of Love incarnate!
