38. Ye have heard that it hath been
	said— (Exodus 21:23-25;
	Leviticus 24:19; Leviticus 24:20;
	Deuteronomy 19:21). 
	An eye for an eye, and a
	tooth for a tooth—that is, whatever penalty was regarded as a
	proper equivalent for these. This law of retribution—designed to
	take vengeance out of the hands of private persons, and commit it to
	the magistrate—was abused in the opposite way to the commandments
	of the Decalogue. While they were reduced to the level of civil
	enactments, this judicial regulation was held to be a warrant for
	taking redress into their own hands, contrary to the injunctions of
	the Old Testament itself (Proverbs 20:22;
	Proverbs 24:29).
