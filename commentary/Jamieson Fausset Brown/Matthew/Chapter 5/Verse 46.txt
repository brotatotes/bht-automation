46. For if ye love them which love
	you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?â€”The
	publicans, as collectors of taxes due to the Roman government, were
	ever on this account obnoxious to the Jews, who sat uneasy under a
	foreign yoke, and disliked whatever brought this unpleasantly before
	them. But the extortion practiced by this class made them hateful to
	the community, who in their current speech ranked them with
	"harlots." Nor does our Lord scruple to speak of them as
	others did, which we may be sure He never would have done if it had
	been calumnious. The meaning, then, is, "In loving those who
	love you, there is no evidence of superior principle; the worst of
	men will do this: even a publican will go that length."
