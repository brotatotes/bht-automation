	fast—referring, probably, to private and voluntary fasting,

	a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces—literally,
	"make unseen"; very well rendered "disfigure."

	multiplied their fasts. And are the exhausting fasts of the Church of
	Rome, and of Romanizing Protestants, free from this taint? 
	Verily I say unto you, They
	have their reward.
