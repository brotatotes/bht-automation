19. Lay not up for ourselves
	treasures upon earth—hoard not. 
	where moth—a
	"clothes-moth." Eastern treasures, consisting partly in
	costly dresses stored up ( :-), were liable to be consumed by moths (Job 13:28;
	Isaiah 50:9; Isaiah 51:8).
	In James 5:2 there is an evident
	reference to our Lord's words here. 
	and rust—any "eating
	into" or "consuming"; here, probably, "wear and
	tear." 
	doth corrupt—cause to
	disappear. By this reference to moth and rust our Lord would teach
	how perishable are such earthly treasures. 
	and where thieves break
	through and steal—Treasures these, how precarious!
