20. But lay up for yourselves
	treasures in heaven—The language in Luke ( :-) is very bold—"Sell that ye have, and give alms;
	provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens
	that faileth not," &c. 
	where neither moth nor rust
	doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor
	steal—Treasures these, imperishable and unassailable!
	(Compare Colossians 3:2).
