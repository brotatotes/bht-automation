8. Be not ye therefore like unto
	them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye
	ask him—and so needs not to be informed of our wants,
	any more than to be roused to attend to them by our incessant
	speaking. What a view of God is here given, in sharp contrast with
	the gods of the heathen! But let it be carefully noted that it is not
	as the general Father of mankind that our Lord says, "Your
	Father" knoweth what ye need before ye ask it; for it is not
	men, as such, that He is addressing in this discourse, but His own
	disciples—the poor in spirit, the mourners, the meek, hungry and
	thirsty souls, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peacemakers, who
	allow themselves to have all manner of evil said against them for the
	Son of man's sake—in short, the new-born children of God, who,
	making their Father's interests their own, are here assured that
	their Father, in return, makes their interests His, and needs neither
	to be told nor to be reminded of their wants. Yet He will have His
	children pray to Him, and links all His promised supplies to their
	petitions for them; thus encouraging us to draw near and keep near to
	Him, to talk and walk with Him, to open our every case to Him, and
	assure ourselves that thus asking we shall receive—thus seeking we
	shall find—thus knocking it shall be opened to us.
