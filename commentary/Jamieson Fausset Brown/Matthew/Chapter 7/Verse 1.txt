1. Judge not, that ye be not
	judged—To "judge" here does not exactly mean to
	pronounce condemnatory judgment, nor does it refer to simple judging
	at all, whether favorable or the reverse. The context makes it clear
	that the thing here condemned is that disposition to look unfavorably
	on the character and actions of others, which leads invariably to the
	pronouncing of rash, unjust, and unlovely judgments upon them. No
	doubt it is the judgments so pronounced which are here spoken of; but
	what our Lord aims at is the spirit out of which they spring.
	Provided we eschew this unlovely spirit, we are not only warranted to
	sit in judgment upon a brother's character and actions, but in the
	exercise of a necessary discrimination are often constrained to do so
	for our own guidance. It is the violation of the law of love involved
	in the exercise of a censorious disposition which alone is here
	condemned. And the argument against it—"that ye be not
	judged"—confirms this: "that your own character and
	actions be not pronounced upon with the like severity"; that is,
	at the great day.
