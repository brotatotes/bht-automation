11. If ye then, being evil, know how
	to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your
	Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him!â€”Bad
	as our fallen nature is, the father in us is not extinguished.
	What a heart, then, must the Father of all fathers have towards His
	pleading children! In the corresponding passage in Luke (see on  :-), instead of "good things," our Lord asks whether
	He will not much more give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
	Him. At this early stage of His ministry, and before such an
	audience, He seems to avoid such sharp doctrinal teaching as was more
	accordant with His plan at the riper stage indicated in Luke, and in
	addressing His own disciples exclusively. 
	Golden Rule ( :-).
