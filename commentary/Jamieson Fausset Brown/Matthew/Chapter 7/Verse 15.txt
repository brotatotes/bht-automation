	of false prophets—that
	is, of teachers coming as authorized expounders of the mind of God
	and guides to heaven. (See Acts 20:29;
	Acts 20:30; 2 Peter 2:1;
	2 Peter 2:2). 
	which come to you in sheep's
	clothing—with a bland, gentle, plausible exterior; persuading
	you that the gate is not strait nor the way narrow, and that to teach
	so is illiberal and bigoted—precisely what the old prophets did
	(Ezekiel 13:1-10; Ezekiel 13:22).
	but inwardly they are
	ravening wolves—bent on devouring the flock for their own ends
	(2 Corinthians 11:2; 2 Corinthians 11:3;
	2 Corinthians 11:13-15).
