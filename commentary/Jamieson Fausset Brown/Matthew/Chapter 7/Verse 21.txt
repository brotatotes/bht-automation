21. Not every one that saith unto
	me, Lord, Lord—the reduplication of the title "Lord"
	denoting zeal in according it to Christ (see  :-). Yet our Lord claims and expects this of all His
	disciples, as when He washed their feet: "Ye call me Master and
	Lord: and ye say well; for so I am" ( :-). 
	shall enter into the kingdom
	of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
	heaven—that will which it had been the great object of this
	discourse to set forth. Yet our Lord says warily, not "the will
	of your Father," but "of My Father";
	thus claiming a relationship to His Father with which His disciples
	might not intermeddle, and which He never lets down. And He so speaks
	here to give authority to His asseverations. But now He rises higher
	still—not formally announcing Himself as the Judge, but
	intimating what men will say to Him, and He to them, when He
	sits as their final judge.
