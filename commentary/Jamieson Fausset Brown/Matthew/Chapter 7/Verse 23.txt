23. And then will I profess unto
	them—or, openly proclaim—tearing off the mask. 
	I never knew you—What
	they claimed—intimacy with Christ—is just what He repudiates, and
	with a certain scornful dignity. "Our acquaintance was not

	Matthew 25:41). The connection here
	gives these words an awful significance. They claimed intimacy with
	Christ, and in the corresponding passage, Matthew 25:41- :, are represented as having gone out and in with Him on
	familiar terms. "So much the worse for you," He replies: "I
	bore with that long enough; but now—begone!" 
	ye that work iniquity—not
	"that wrought iniquity"; for they are represented as
	fresh from the scenes and acts of it as they stand before the Judge.
	(See on the almost identical, but even more vivid and awful,
	description of the scene in Matthew 25:41- :). That the apostle alludes to these very words in Matthew 25:41- : there can hardly be any doubt—"Nevertheless the
	foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth
	them that are His. And, Let every one that nameth the name of
	Christ depart from iniquity."
