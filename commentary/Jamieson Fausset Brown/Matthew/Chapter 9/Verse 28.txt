	house—To try their faith and patience, He seems to have made
	them no answer. But 
	the blind men came to

	Lord—Doubtless our Lord's design was not only to put their
	faith to the test by this question, but to deepen it, to raise their
	expectation of a cure, and so prepare them to receive it; and the
	cordial acknowledgment, so touchingly simple, which they immediately
	made to Him of His power to heal them, shows how entirely that object
	was gained.
