	he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted—This

	abroad—rather, "lying about," "abandoned,"
	or "neglected."

	shepherd—their pitiable condition as wearied under bodily
	fatigue, a vast disorganized mass, being but a faint picture of their
	wretchedness as the victims of pharisaic guidance; their souls
	uncared for, yet drawn after and hanging upon Him. This moved the
	Redeemer's compassion.
