	same persons send salutations in the accompanying Epistle, except
	that “Jesus Justus” is not mentioned here.Epaphras,

	— He had been sent by the Colossian Church to inquire after, and
	minister to, Paul, and possibly was cast into prison
	by the Roman authorities on suspicion. However, he is not mentioned
	as a prisoner
	in  :-,
	so that “fellow prisoner” here may mean merely one who was a
	faithful companion to Paul in his imprisonment, and by his society
	put himself in the position of a prisoner. So also “Aristarchus, my
	fellow prisoner,”  :-,
	may mean. Benson conjectures the meaning to be that on some former
	occasion these two were Paul’s “fellow prisoners,” not
	at the time.
