	— the ground of his thanksgiving. It is a delicate mark of
	authenticity, that he says “hearing” as to churches and persons
	whom he had not seen or then
	visited. Now Colosse, Philemon’s place of residence, he had never
	yet seen. Yet  :-

	converted at Ephesus, or in some other place where he met Paul.love
	and faith
	— The theological order is first faith
	then love,
	the fruit of faith. But he purposely puts Philemon’s love
	in the first place, as it is to an act of love that he is exhorting
	him.toward
	... toward
	— different Greek
	words: “towards” ... “unto.” Towards
