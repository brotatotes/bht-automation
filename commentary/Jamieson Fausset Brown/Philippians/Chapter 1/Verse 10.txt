10. Literally, "With a
	view to your proving (and so approving and embracing) the
	things that excel" ( :-); not merely things not bad, but the things best among those
	that are good; the things of more advanced excellence. Ask as to
	things, not merely, Is there no harm, but is there any good, and
	which is the best? 
	sincere—from a Greek
	root. Examined in the sunlight and found pure.
without offence—not
	stumbling; running the Christian race without falling through any
	stumbling-block, that is, temptation, in your way. 
	till—rather, "unto,"
	"against"; so that when the day of Christ comes, ye may be
	found pure and without offense.
