	"Prætorium," that is, the barrack of the Prætorian guards
	attached to the palace of Nero, on the Palatine hill at Rome; not the
	general Prætorian camp outside of the city; for this was not
	connected with "Cæsar's household," which  :- shows the Prætorium here meant was. The emperor was
	"Prætor," or Commander-in-Chief; naturally then the
	barrack of his bodyguard was called the Prætorium. Paul seems now
	not to have been at large in his own hired house, though chained to a
	soldier, as in Acts 28:16; Acts 28:20;
	Acts 28:30; Acts 28:31,
	but in strict custody in the Prætorium; a change which probably took
	place on Tigellinus becoming Prætorian Prefect. See Acts 28:31- :

	Prætorian soldiers stationed elsewhere, through the instrumentality
	of the Prætorian household guards who might for the time be attached
	to the emperor's palace, and who relieved one another in succession.
	Paul had been now upwards of two years a prisoner, so that there was
	time for his cause and the Gospel having become widely known at Rome.
