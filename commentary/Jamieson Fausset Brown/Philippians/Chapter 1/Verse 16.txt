16, 17. The oldest manuscripts
	transpose these verses, and read, "These (last) indeed
	out of love (to Christ and me), knowing (the opposite of
	'thinking' below) that I am set (that is, appointed by God,  :-) for the defense of the Gospel ( :-, not on my own account). But the others out of
	contention (or rather, 'a factious spirit'; 'cabal'; a spirit of
	intrigue, using unscrupulous means to compass their end;
	'self-seeking' [ALFORD])
	proclaim (the Greek is not the same as that for
	'preach,' but, 'announce') Christ, not sincerely (answering to
	'but of a spirit of intrigue,' or 'self-seeking'). Literally, 'not
	purely'; not with a pure intention; the Jewish leaven they tried to
	introduce was in order to glorify themselves (Galatians 6:12;
	Galatians 6:13; however, see on Galatians 6:13- :), thinking (but in vain) to raise up (so the oldest
	manuscripts read) tribulation to my bonds." Their thought
	was, that taking the opportunity of my being laid aside, they would
	exalt themselves by their Judaizing preaching, and depreciate me and
	my preaching, and so cause me trouble of spirit in my bonds; they
	thought that I, like themselves, sought my own glory, and so would be
	mortified at their success over mine. But they are utterly mistaken;
	"I rejoice" at it (Galatians 6:13- :), so far am I from being troubled at it.
