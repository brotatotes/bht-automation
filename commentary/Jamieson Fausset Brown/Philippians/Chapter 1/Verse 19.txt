19. turn to my salvation—"turn
	out to me for, (or unto) salvation." This
	proclamation of Christ every way will turn out to my spiritual
	good. Christ, whose interests are my interests, being glorified
	thereby; and so the coming of His kingdom being furthered, which,
	when it does come, will bring completed "SALVATION"
	(Hebrews 9:28) to me and all whose
	"earnest expectation" (Hebrews 9:28- :) is that Christ may be magnified in them. So far is their
	preaching from causing me, as they thought, tribulation in my
	bonds (Philippians 1:16). Paul
	plainly quotes and applies to himself the very words of the
	Septuagint (Job 13:16),
	"This shall turn out to my salvation," which belong to all
	God's people of every age, in their tribulation (compare Job 13:16- :). 
	through your prayer and the
	supply—The Greek intimately joins the two nouns
	together, by having but one preposition and one article: "Through
	your prayer and (the consequent) supply of the Spirit of Jesus
	Christ (obtained for me through your prayer)."
