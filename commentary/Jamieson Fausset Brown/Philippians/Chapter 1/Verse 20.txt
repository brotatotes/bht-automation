20. According to my earnest
	expectation—The Greek expresses, "expectation with
	uplifted head (Luke 21:28)
	and outstretched neck." Luke 21:28- : is the only other place in the New Testament that the word
	occurs. TITTMANN says, in
	both places it implies not mere expectation, but the
	anxious desire of an anticipated prosperous issue in afflictive
	circumstances. The subject of his earnest expectation which
	follows, answers to "my salvation" (Luke 21:28- :). 
	in nothing I shall be
	ashamed—in nothing have reason to be ashamed of "my work
	for God, or His work in me" [ALFORD].
	Or, "in nothing be disappointed in my hope, but
	that I may fully obtain it" [ESTIUS].
	So "ashamed" is used in Luke 21:28- :. 
	all boldness—"all"
	is opposed to "in nothing," as "boldness" is the
	opposite to "ashamed." 
	so now also—when "my
	body" is "in bonds" (Luke 21:28- :). 
	Christ—not Paul, "shall
	be magnified." 
	life, or by death—Whatever
	be the issue, I cannot lose; I must be the gainer by the event. Paul
	was not omniscient; in the issue of things pertaining to themselves,
	the apostles underwent the same probation of faith and patience as
	we.
