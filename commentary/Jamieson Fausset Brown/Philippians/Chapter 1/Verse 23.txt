23. Forâ€”The oldest manuscripts
	read, "But." "I know not ( :-), BUT am in a
	strait (am perplexed) betwixt the two (namely, 'to live' and
	'to die'), having the desire for departing (literally, 'to
	loose anchor,' 2 Timothy 4:6) and
	being with Christ; FOR (so
	the oldest manuscripts) it is by far better"; or as the Greek,
	more forcibly, "by far the more preferable"; a
	double comparative. This refutes the notion of the soul being dormant
	during its separation from the body. It also shows that, while he
	regarded the Lord's advent as at all times near, yet that his death
	before it was a very possible contingency. The partial life
	eternal is in the interval between death and Christ's second advent;
	the perfectional, at that advent [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. To depart
	is better than to remain in the flesh; to be with Christ is far,
	far better; a New Testament hope (2 Timothy 4:6- :), [BENGEL].
