5. Ground of his "thanking
	God" (Philippians 1:3): "For
	your (continued) fellowship (that is, real spiritual participation)
	in (literally, 'in regard to') the Gospel from the first day (of your
	becoming partakers in it) until now." Believers have the
	fellowship of the Son of God (Philippians 1:3- :) and of the Father (1 John 1:3)
	in the Gospel, by becoming partakers of "the fellowship of the
	Holy Ghost" (2 Corinthians 13:14),
	and exercise that fellowship by acts of communion, not only the
	communion of the Lord's Supper, but holy liberality to brethren and
	ministers (Philippians 4:10; Philippians 4:15,
	"communicated . . . concerning giving"; 2 Corinthians 9:13;
	Galatians 6:6; Hebrews 13:16,
	"To communicate forget not").
