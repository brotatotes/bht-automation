	Compare "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord
	(that is, whosoever shall call on the Lord in His revealed

	1 Corinthians 1:2); "all that call
	upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord" (compare 1 Corinthians 1:2- :); "call on the Lord"; 1 Corinthians 1:2- :, "calling upon . . . and saying, Lord Jesus"

	They worship Him not only as God, but as the ascended God-man,
	"Jesus" (Ephesians 1:21;
	Hebrews 1:6; 1 Peter 3:22).
	in earth—men; among
	whom He tabernacled for a time. 
	under the earth—the
	dead; among whom He was numbered once (Romans 14:9;
	Romans 14:11; Ephesians 4:9;
	Ephesians 4:10; Revelation 5:13).
	The demons and the lost may be included indirectly, as even
	they give homage, though one of fear, not love, to Jesus (Mark 3:11;
	Luke 8:31; James 2:19,
	see on Philippians 2:11).
