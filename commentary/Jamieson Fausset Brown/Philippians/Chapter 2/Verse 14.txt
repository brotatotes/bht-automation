14. murmurings—secret
	murmurings and complaints against your fellow men arising from
	selfishness: opposed to the example of Jesus just mentioned (compare
	the use of the word, John 7:12;
	John 7:13; Acts 6:1;
	1 Peter 4:9; Judges 1:16).
	disputings—The Greek
	is translated "doubting" in Judges 1:16- :. But here referring to profitless "disputings" with
	our fellow men, in relation to whom we are called on to be "blameless
	and harmless" (Philippians 2:15):
	so the Greek is translated, Mark 9:33;
	Mark 9:34. These disputings flow
	from "vain glory" reprobated (Mark 9:34- :); and abounded among the Aristotelian philosophers in
	Macedon, where Philippi was.
