16. Holding forth—to them, and
	so applying it (the common meaning of the Greek;
	perhaps here including also the other meaning, "holding fast").
	The image of light-bearers or luminaries is carried on
	from Philippians 2:15. As the heavenly
	luminaries' light is closely connected with the life of
	animals, so ye hold forth the light of Christ's "word"
	(received from me) which is the "life" of the Gentiles
	(John 1:4; 1 John 1:1;
	1 John 1:5-7). Christ is "the
	Light of the world" (1 John 1:5-62.1.7- :); believers are only "light-bearers" reflecting
	His light. 
	that I may rejoice
	in—literally, "with a view to (your being) a
	subject of rejoicing to me against the day of Christ"
	(Philippians 4:1; 2 Corinthians 1:14;
	1 Thessalonians 2:19). 
	that I have not run in
	vain—that it was not in vain that I labored for your spiritual
	good.
