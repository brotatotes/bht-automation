2. Fulfil—that is, Make full.
	I have joy in you, complete it by that which is still wanting,
	namely, unity (Philippians 1:9). 
	likeminded—literally,
	"that ye be of the same mind"; more general than the
	following "of one mind." 
	having the same love—equally
	disposed to love and be loved. 
	being of one
	accord—literally, "with united souls." This
	pairs with the following clause, thus, "With united souls, being
	of one mind"; as the former two also pair together, "That
	ye be likeminded, having the same love."
