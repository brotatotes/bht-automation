10. That I may know
	him—experimentally. The aim of the "righteousness"
	just mentioned. This verse resumes, and more fully explains, "the
	excellency of the knowledge of Christ" ( :-). To know HIM is
	more than merely to know a doctrine about Him. Believers are
	brought not only to redemption, but to the Redeemer Himself. 
	the power of his
	resurrection—assuring believers of their justification (Romans 4:25;
	1 Corinthians 15:17), and raising them up
	spiritually with Him, by virtue of their identification with Him in
	this, as in all the acts of His redeeming work for us (Romans 6:4;
	Colossians 2:12; Colossians 3:1).
	The power of the Divine Spirit, which raised Him from literal death,
	is the same which raises believers from spiritual death now (Ephesians 1:19;
	Ephesians 1:20), and shall raise their
	bodies from literal death hereafter (Ephesians 1:20- :). 
	the fellowship of his
	sufferings—by identification with Him in His sufferings and
	death, by imputation; also, in actually bearing the
	cross whatever is laid on us, after His example, and so "filling
	up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ" (Ephesians 1:20- :); and in the will to bear aught for His sake (Matthew 10:38;
	Matthew 16:24; 2 Timothy 2:11).
	As He bore all our sufferings (2 Timothy 2:11- :), so we participate in His. 
	made conformable unto his
	death—"conformed to the likeness of His death,"
	namely, by continued sufferings for His sake, and mortifying of the
	carnal self (Romans 8:29; 1 Corinthians 15:31;
	2 Corinthians 4:10-12; Galatians 2:20).
