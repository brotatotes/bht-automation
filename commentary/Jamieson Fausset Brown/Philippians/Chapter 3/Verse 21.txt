21. Greek, "Who
	shall transfigure the body of our humiliation (namely,
	in which our humiliation has place, 2 Corinthians 4:10;
	Ephesians 2:19; 2 Timothy 2:12),
	that it may be conformed unto the body of His glory
	(namely, in which His glory is manifested), according to the
	effectual working whereby," c. Not only shall He come as
	our "Saviour," but also as our Glorifier.
evenâ€”not only to make
	the body like His own, but "to subdue all things,"
	even death itself, as well as Satan and sin. He gave a sample of the
	coming transfiguration on the mount (2 Timothy 2:12- :, &c.). Not a change of identity, but of fashion
	or form (Psalms 17:15
1 Corinthians 15:51). Our spiritual
	resurrection now is the pledge of our bodily resurrection to glory
	hereafter (Philippians 3:20; Romans 8:11).
	As Christ's glorified body was essentially identical with His body of
	humiliation; so our resurrection bodies as believers, since they
	shall be like His, shall be identical essentially with our present
	bodies, and yet "spiritual bodies" (Romans 8:11- :). Our "hope" is, that Christ, by His rising
	from the dead, hath obtained the power, and is become the pattern, of
	our resurrection (Micah 2:13).
