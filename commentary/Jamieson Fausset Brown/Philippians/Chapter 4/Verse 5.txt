5. moderation—from a Greek
	root, "to yield," whence yieldingness [TRENCH];
	or from a root, "it is fitting," whence "reasonableness
	of dealing" [ALFORD],
	that considerateness for others, not urging one's own rights to
	the uttermost, but waiving a part, and thereby rectifying the
	injustices of justice. The archetype of this grace is God, who
	presses not the strictness of His law against us as we deserve
	(Psalms 130:3; Psalms 130:4);
	though having exacted the fullest payment for us from our Divine
	Surety. There are included in "moderation," candor
	and kindliness. Joy in the Lord raises us above rigorism
	towards others (Philippians 4:5), and
	carefulness (Philippians 4:6) as to
	one's own affairs. Sadness produces morose harshness towards
	others, and a troublesome spirit in ourselves. 
	Let . . . be known—that
	is, in your conduct to others, let nothing inconsistent with
	"moderation" be seen. Not a precept to make a display
	of moderation. Let this grace "be known" to men in acts;
	let "your requests be made to God" in word (Philippians 4:6- :). 
	unto all men—even to
	the "perverse" (Philippians 4:6- :), that so ye may win them. Exercise "forbearance"
	even to your persecutors. None is so ungracious as not to be kindly
	to someone, from some motive or another, on some occasion; the
	believer is to be so "unto all men" at all times.The Lord is at hand—The
	Lord's coming again speedily is the grand motive to every Christian
	grace (James 5:8; James 5:9).
	Harshness to others (the opposite of "moderation") would be
	taking into our own hands prematurely the prerogatives of judging,
	which belongs to the Lord alone (James 5:9- :); and so provoking God to judge us by the strict letter of
	the law (James 2:12; James 2:13).
