	"And THE LIVING
	ONE": connected with
	last sentence, Revelation 1:17. 
	and was—Greek,
	"and (yet) I became." 
	alive for evermore—Greek,
	"living unto the ages of ages": not merely "I
	live," but I have life, and am the source of it to My
	people. "To Him belongs absolute being, as contrasted
	with the relative being of the creature; others may share,
	He only hath immortality: being in essence, not by mere
	participation, immortal" [THEODORET
	in TRENCH]. One oldest
	manuscript, with English Version, reads Amen." Two
	others, and most of the oldest versions and Fathers, omit it. His
	having passed through death as one of us, and now living in the
	infinite plenitude of life, reassures His people, since through Him
	death is the gate of resurrection to eternal life. 
	have . . . keys of
	hell—Greek, "Hades"; Hebrew, "Sheol."
	"Hell" in the sense, the place of torment, answers
	to a different Greek word, namely, Gehenna. I can
	release from the unseen world of spirits and from DEATH
	whom I will. The oldest manuscripts read by transposition,
	"Death and Hades," or Hell." It is death (which came
	in by sin, robbing man of his immortal birthright, Revelation 1:17- :) that peoples Hades, and therefore should stand first in
	order. Keys are emblems of authority, opening and shutting at
	will "the gates of Hades" (Psalms 9:13;
	Psalms 9:14; Isaiah 38:10;
	Matthew 16:18).
