 CHAPTER 10 
	
 :-. VISION OF THE
	LITTLE BOOK.
	 
	As an episode was introduced
	between the sixth and seventh seals, so there is one here ( :-) after the sixth and introductory to the seventh
	trumpet (Revelation 11:15, which forms
	the grand consummation). The Church and her fortunes are the subject
	of this episode: as the judgments on the unbelieving inhabiters of
	the earth (Revelation 8:13) were
	the exclusive subject of the fifth and sixth woe-trumpets. Revelation 8:13- : is plainly referred to in Revelation 8:13- : below; in Revelation 6:11 the
	martyrs crying to be avenged were told they must "rest yet for a
	little season" or time: in Revelation 6:11- : here they are assured, "There shall be no longer (any
	interval of) time"; their prayer shall have no longer to wait,
	but (Revelation 10:7) at the trumpet
	sounding of the seventh angel shall be consummated, and the
	mystery of God (His mighty plan heretofore hidden, but then to be
	revealed) shall be finished. The little open book
	(Revelation 10:2; Revelation 10:9;
	Revelation 10:10) is given to John by
	the angel, with a charge (Revelation 10:10- :) that he must prophesy again concerning (so the
	Greek) peoples, nations, tongues, and kings: which
	prophecy (as appears from Revelation 10:10- :) affects those peoples, nations, tongues, and kings
	only in relation to ISRAEL AND
	THE CHURCH, who
	form the main object of the prophecy.
