5. lifted up his handâ€”So A and
	Vulgate read. But B, C, Aleph, Syriac, and
	Coptic, ". . . his right hand." It was
	customary to lift up the hand towards heaven, appealing to the God of
	truth, in taking a solemn oath. There is in this part of the vision
	an allusion to Daniel 12:1-13.
	Compare Revelation 10:4; Daniel 12:4;
	Daniel 12:9; and Revelation 10:5;
	Revelation 10:6; Daniel 12:7.
	But there the angel clothed in linen, and standing upon the waters,
	sware "a time, times, and a half" were to interpose before
	the consummation; here, on the contrary, the angel standing with his
	left foot on the earth, and his right upon the sea, swears there
	shall be time no longer. There he lifted up both hands to heaven;
	here he has the little book now open (whereas in Daniel
	the book is sealed) in his left hand (Daniel 12:7- :), and he lifts up only his right hand to heaven.
