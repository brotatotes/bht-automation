9. I went—Greek, "I
	went away." John here leaves heaven, his standing-point
	of observation heretofore, to be near the angel standing on the earth
	and sea. 
	Give—A, B, C, and
	Vulgate read the infinitive, "Telling him to give."
	eat it up—appropriate
	its contents so entirely as to be assimilated with (as food), and
	become part of thyself, so as to impart them the more vividly to
	others. His finding the roll sweet to the taste at first, is because
	it was the Lord's will he was doing, and because, divesting himself
	of carnal feeling, he regarded God's will as always agreeable,
	however bitter might be the message of judgment to be announced.
	Compare Psalms 40:8, Margin,
	as to Christ's inner complete appropriation of God's word. 
	thy belly bitter—parallel
	to Ezekiel 2:10, "There was
	written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe." 
	as honey— (Psalms 19:10;
	Psalms 119:103). Honey, sweet to the
	mouth, sometimes turns into bile in the stomach. The thought that God
	would be glorified (Revelation 11:3-6;
	Revelation 11:11-18) gave him the
	sweetest pleasure. Yet, afterwards the belly, or carnal
	natural feeling, was embittered with grief at the prophecy of the
	coming bitter persecutions of the Church (Revelation 11:11-66.11.18- :); compare John 16:1;
	John 16:2. The revelation of the
	secrets of futurity is sweet to one at first, but bitter
	and distasteful to our natural man, when we learn the cross which is
	to be borne before the crown shall be won. John was grieved at the
	coming apostasy and the sufferings of the Church at the hands of
	Antichrist.
