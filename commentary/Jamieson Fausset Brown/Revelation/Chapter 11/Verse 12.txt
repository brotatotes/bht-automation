	a cloud—Greek,
	"the cloud"; which may be merely the generic expression for
	what we are familiar with, as we say "the clouds."
	But I prefer taking the article as definitely alluding to THE
	cloud which received Jesus at His ascension,  :- (where there is no article, as there is no allusion to a
	previous cloud, such as there is here). As they resembled Him in
	their three and a half years' witnessing, their three and a half days
	lying in death (though not for exactly the same time, nor put in a
	tomb as He was), so also in their ascension is the translation and
	transfiguration of the sealed of Israel ( :-), and the elect of all nations, caught up out of the reach
	of the Antichristian foe. In  :-, He is represented as sitting on a white cloud.
their enemies beheld them—and
	were thus openly convicted by God for their unbelief and persecution
	of His servants; unlike Elijah's ascension formerly, in the sight of
	friends only. The Church caught up to meet the Lord in the air, and
	transfigured in body, is justified by her Lord before the world, even
	as the man-child (Jesus) was "caught up unto God and His throne"
	from before the dragon standing ready to devour the woman's child
	as soon as born.
