17. thanks—for the answer to
	our prayers (Revelation 6:10; Revelation 6:11)
	in destroying them which destroy the earth (Revelation 6:11- :), thereby preparing the way for setting up the kingdom of
	Thyself and Thy saints. 
	and art to come—omitted
	in A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, CYPRIAN,
	and ANDREAS. The
	consummation having actually come, they do not address Him as they
	did when it was still future, "Thou that art to come."
	Compare Revelation 11:18, "is
	come." From the sounding of the seventh trumpet He is to His
	people JAH, the ever
	present Lord, WHO IS, more
	peculiarly than JEHOVAH
	"who is, was, and is to come." 
	taken to thee thy great
	power—"to Thee" is not in the Greek. Christ
	takes to Him the kingdom as His own of right.
