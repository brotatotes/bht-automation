4. standing before the God of the
	earthâ€”A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS
	read "Lord" for "God": so  :-. Ministering to (Luke 1:19),
	and as in the sight of Him, who, though now so widely disowned on
	"earth," is its rightful King, and shall at last be openly
	recognized as such (Revelation 11:15).
	The phrase alludes to Zechariah 4:10;
	Zechariah 4:14, "the two anointed
	ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth." The article
	"the" marks this allusion. They are "the two
	candlesticks," not that they are the Church, the one
	candlestick, but as its representative light-bearers (Greek,
	"phosteres," Zechariah 4:14- :), and ministering for its encouragement in a time of
	apostasy. WORDSWORTH'S
	view is worth consideration, whether it may not constitute a
	secondary sense: the two witnesses, the olive trees, are THE
	TWO TESTAMENTS
	ministering their testimony to the Church of the old
	dispensation, as well as to that of the new, which explains the two
	witnesses being called also the two candlesticks (the Old and
	New Testament churches; the candlestick in Zechariah 4:14- : is but one as there was then but one Testament, and
	one Church, the Jewish). The Church in both dispensations has no
	light in herself, but derives it from the Spirit through the witness
	of the twofold word, the two olive trees: compare Note, see on
	Revelation 11:1, which is connected
	with this, the reed, the Scripture canon, being the
	measure of the Church: so PRIMASIUS
	[X, p. 314]: the two witnesses preach in sackcloth, marking the
	ignominious treatment which the word, like Christ Himself, receives
	from the world. So the twenty-four elders represent the ministers of
	the two dispensations by the double twelve. But Revelation 11:1- : proves that primarily the two Testaments cannot be meant;
	for these shall never be "killed," and never "shall
	have finished their testimony" till the world is finished.
