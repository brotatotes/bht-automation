10. Now—Now that Satan
	has been cast out of heaven. Primarily fulfilled in part at Jesus'
	resurrection and ascension, when He said ( :-), "All power [Greek, 'exousia,'
	'authority,' as here; see below] is given unto Me in heaven and in
	earth"; connected with  :-, "Her child was caught up unto God and to His
	throne." In the ulterior sense, it refers to the eve of
	Christ's second coming, when Israel is about to be restored as
	mother-church of Christendom, Satan, who had resisted her restoration
	on the ground of her unworthiness, having been cast out by the
	instrumentality of Michael, Israel's angelic prince (see on  :-). Thus this is parallel, and the necessary preliminary to
	the glorious event similarly expressed,  :-, "The kingdom of this world is become (the very word
	here, Greek, 'egeneto,' 'is come,' 'hath come to pass')
	our Lord's and His Christ's," the result of Israel's resuming
	her place. 
	salvation, c.—Greek,
	"the salvation (namely, fully, finally, and victoriously
	accomplished, Hebrews 9:28 compare
	Luke 3:6, yet future; hence, not
	till now do the blessed raise the fullest hallelujah for
	salvation to the Lamb, Revelation 7:10;
	Revelation 19:1) the power
	(Greek, 'dunamis'), and the authority (Greek,
	'exousia'; 'legitimate power'; see above) of His
	Christ." 
	accused them before our God
	day and night—Hence the need that the oppressed Church, God's
	own elect (like the widow, continually coming, so as even
	to weary the unjust judge), should cry day and night unto
	Him.
