	the remnant of her
	seed—distinct in some sense from the woman herself. Satan's
	first effort was to root out the Christian Church, so that there
	should be no visible profession of Christianity. Foiled in this, he
	wars (Revelation 11:7; Revelation 13:7)
	against the invisible Church, namely, "those who keep the
	commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus" (A, B, and
	C omit "Christ"). These are "the remnant," or
	rest of her seed, as distinguished from her seed, "the
	man-child" (Revelation 12:5), on
	one hand, and from mere professors on the other. The Church, in her
	beauty and unity (Israel at the head of Christendom, the whole
	forming one perfect Church), is now not manifested, but awaiting the
	manifestations of the sons of God at Christ's coming. Unable
	to destroy Christianity and the Church as a whole, Satan directs his
	enmity against true Christians, the elect remnant: the others
	he leaves unmolested.
