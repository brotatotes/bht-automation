	wonder—Greek,
	"semeion," "sign." 
	red—So A and Vulgate
	read. But B, C, and Coptic read, "of fire." In
	either case, the color of the dragon implies his fiery rage as
	a murderer from the beginning. His representative, the
	beast, corresponds, having seven heads and ten horns (the
	number of horns on the fourth beast of Daniel 7:7;
	Revelation 13:1). But there, ten
	crowns are on the ten horns (for before the end, the fourth
	empire is divided into ten kingdoms); here, seven
	crowns (rather, "diadems," Greek, "diademata,"
	not stephanoi, "wreaths") are upon his seven
	heads. In Daniel 7:4-7
	the Antichristian powers up to Christ's second coming are represented
	by four beasts, which have among them seven heads, that is,
	the first, second, and fourth beasts having one head each, the
	third, four heads. His universal dominion as prince of this
	fallen world is implied by the seven diadems (contrast the
	"many diadems on Christ's head," Daniel 7:4-27.7.7- :, when coming to destroy him and his), the caricature of the
	seven Spirits of God. His worldly instruments of power are
	marked by the ten horns, ten being the number of the world. It
	marks his self-contradictions that he and the beast bear both the
	number seven (the divine number) and ten (the world
	number).
