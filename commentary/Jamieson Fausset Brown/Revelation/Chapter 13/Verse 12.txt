	non-existence of the beast embraces the whole Germanic Christian
	period. The healing of the wound and return of the beast is
	represented [in regard to its final Antichristian
	manifestation though including also, meanwhile, its healing and
	return under Popery, which is baptized heathenism] in that principle
	which, since 1789, has manifested itself in beast-like outbreaks"

	which dwell therein—the
	earthly-minded. The Church becomes the harlot: the world's
	political power, the Antichristian beast; the world's wisdom
	and civilization, the false prophet. Christ's three offices
	are thus perverted: the first beast is the false kingship; the
	harlot, the false priesthood; the second beast, the false
	prophet. The beast is the bodily, the false prophet the
	intellectual, the harlot the spiritual power of
	Antichristianity [AUBERLEN].
	The Old-Testament Church stood under the power of the beast,
	the heathen world power: the Middle-Ages Church under that of
	the harlot: in modern times the false prophet predominates.
	But in the last days all these God-opposed powers which have
	succeeded each other shall co-operate, and raise each other to
	the most terrible and intense power of their nature: the false
	prophet causes men to worship the beast, and the beast carries the
	harlot. These three forms of apostasy are reducible to two: the
	apostate Church and the apostate world, pseudo-Christianity
	and Antichristianity, the harlot and the beast; for the false
	prophet is also a beast; and the two beasts, as different
	manifestations of the same beast-like principle, stand in
	contradistinction to the harlot, and are finally judged together,
	whereas separate judgment falls on the harlot [AUBERLEN].
