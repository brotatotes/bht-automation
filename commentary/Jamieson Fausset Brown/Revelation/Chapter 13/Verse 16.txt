16. to receive a markâ€”literally,
	"that they should give them a mark"; such a brand as
	masters stamp on their slaves, and monarchs on their subjects.
	Soldiers voluntarily punctured their arms with marks of the general
	under whom they served. Votaries of idols branded themselves with the
	idol's cipher or symbol. Thus Antiochus Epiphanes branded the Jews
	with the ivy leaf, the symbol of Bacchus (2 Maccabees 6:7; 3
	Maccabees 2:29). Contrast God's seal and name in the
	foreheads of His servants, Revelation 7:3;
	Revelation 14:1; Revelation 22:4;
	and Galatians 6:17, "I bear in my
	body the marks of the Lord Jesus," that is, I am His soldier and
	servant. The mark in the right hand and forehead implies the
	prostration of bodily and intellectual powers to the
	beast's domination. "In the forehead by way of
	profession; in the hand with respect to work and service"
	[AUGUSTINE].
