	seal "upon their foreheads" in  :-. As the 144,000 of Israel are "the first-fruits"
	(Revelation 14:4), so "the
	harvest" (Revelation 14:15) is
	the general assembly of Gentile saints to be translated by Christ as
	His first act in assuming His kingdom, prior to His judgment (Revelation 14:15- :, the last seven vials) on the Antichristian world, in
	executing which His saints shall share. As Noah and Lot were taken
	seasonably out of the judgment, but exposed to the trial
	to the last moment [DE
	BURGH], so those who shall
	reign with Christ shall first suffer with Him, being delivered out of
	the judgments, but not out of the trials. The Jews are
	meant by "the saints of the Most High": against them
	Antichrist makes war, changing their times and laws; for true
	Israelites cannot join in the idolatry of the beast, any more than
	true Christians. The common affliction will draw closely together, in
	opposing the beast's worship, the Old Testament and New Testament
	people of God. Thus the way is paved for Israel's conversion. This
	last utter scattering of the holy people's power leads them,
	under the Spirit, to seek Messiah, and to cry at His approach,
	"Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord."
