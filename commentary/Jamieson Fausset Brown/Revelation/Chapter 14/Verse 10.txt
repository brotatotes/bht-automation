10. The same—Greek, "he
	also," as the just and inevitable retribution. 
	wine of . . . wrath of God—
	(Psalms 75:8). 
	without mixture—whereas
	wine was so commonly mixed with water that to mix wine
	is used in Greek for to pour out wine; this wine
	of God's wrath is undiluted; there is no drop of water to cool
	its heat. Naught of grace or hope is blended with it. This terrible
	threat may well raise us above the fear of man's threats. This
	unmixed cup is already mingled and prepared for Satan
	and the beast's followers. 
	indignation—Greek,
	"orges," "abiding wrath," But the Greek
	for "wrath" above (Greek, "thumou")
	is boiling indignation, from (Greek, "thuo")
	a root meaning "to boil"; this is temporary ebullition of
	anger; that is lasting [AMMONIUS],
	and accompanied with a purpose of vengeance [ORIGEN
	on Psalm 2:5]. 
	tormented . . . in the
	presence of . . . angels— (Psalms 49:14;
	Psalms 58:10; Psalms 139:21;
	Isaiah 66:24). God's enemies are
	regarded by the saints as their enemies, and when the day of
	probation is past, their mind shall be so entirely one with God's,
	that they shall rejoice in witnessing visibly the judicial
	vindication of God's righteousness in sinners' punishment.
