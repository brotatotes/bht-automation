11. for ever and ever—Greek,
	"unto ages of ages." 
	no rest day nor
	night—Contrast the very different sense in which the same is
	said of the four living creatures in heaven, "They rest not day
	and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy"; yet they do "rest"
	in another sense; they rest from sin and sorrow, weariness and
	weakness, trial and temptation ( :-); the lost have no rest from sin and Satan, terror,
	torment, and remorse.
