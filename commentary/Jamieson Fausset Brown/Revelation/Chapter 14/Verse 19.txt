19. "The vine" is what
	is the subject of judgment because its grapes are not what God looked
	for considering its careful culture, but "wild grapes" ( :-). The apostate world of Christendom, not the world of
	heathendom who have not heard of Christ, is the object of judgment.
	Compare the emblem, Revelation 19:15;
	Isaiah 63:2; Isaiah 63:3;
	Joel 3:13.
