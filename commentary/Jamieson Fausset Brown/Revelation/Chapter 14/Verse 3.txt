3. sung—Greek, "sing."
	as it were—So A, C, and
	Vulgate read. It is "as it were" a new song;
	for it is, in truth, as old as God's eternal purpose. But B, Syriac,
	Coptic, ORIGEN, and
	ANDREAS omit these words. 
	new song— (Revelation 5:9;
	Revelation 5:10). The song is that of
	victory after conflict with the dragon, beast, and false prophet:
	never sung before, for such a conflict had never been fought before;
	therefore new: till now the kingdom of Christ on earth
	had been usurped; they sing the new song in anticipation of His
	blood-bought kingdom with His saints. 
	four beasts—rather, as
	Greek, "four living creatures." The harpers and
	singers evidently include the 144,000: so the parallel proves
	(Revelation 15:2; Revelation 15:3),
	where the same act is attributed to the general company of the
	saints, the harvest (Revelation 15:3- :) from all nations. Not as ALFORD,
	"the harpers and song are in heaven, but the 144,000 are on
	earth." 
	redeemed—literally,
	"purchased." Not even the angels can learn that song, for
	they know not experimentally what it is to have "come out
	of the great tribulation, and washed their robes white in the blood
	of the Lamb" (Revelation 7:14).
