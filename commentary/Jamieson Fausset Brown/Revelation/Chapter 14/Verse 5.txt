5. guile—So ANDREAS
	in one copy. But A, B, C, ORIGEN,
	and ANDREAS in other
	copies read, "falsehood." Compare with English Version
	reading Psalms 32:2; Isaiah 53:9;
	John 1:47. 
	for—So B, Syriac,
	Coptic, ORIGEN, and
	ANDREAS read. But A and C
	omit. 
	without fault—Greek,
	"blameless": in respect to the sincerity of their fidelity
	to Him. Not absolutely, and in themselves blameless; but
	regarded as such on the ground of His righteousness in whom alone
	they trusted, and whom they faithfully served by His Spirit in them.
	The allusion seems to be to Psalms 15:1;
	Psalms 15:2. Compare Psalms 15:2- :, "stood on Mount Sion." 
	before the throne of God—A,
	B, C, Syriac, Coptic, ORIGEN,
	and ANDREAS omit these
	words. The oldest Vulgate manuscript supports them.
