	manuscript. Translate, "kings of the whole habitable world,"
	who are "of this world," in contrast to "the kings of
	(from) the East" (the sun-rising),  :-, namely, the saints to whom Christ has appointed a
	kingdom, and who are "children of light." God, in
	permitting Satan's miracles, as in the case of the Egyptian
	magicians who were His instruments in hardening Pharaoh's heart,
	gives the reprobate up to judicial delusion preparatory to their
	destruction. As Aaron's rod was changed into a serpent, so were those
	of the Egyptian magicians. Aaron turned the water into blood so did
	the magicians. Aaron brought up frogs; so did the magicians. With the
	frogs their power ceased. So this, or whatever is antitypical
	to it, will be the last effort of the dragon, beast, and false
	prophet. 
	battle—Greek,
	"war"; the final conflict for the kingship of the world
	described in Revelation 19:17-21.
