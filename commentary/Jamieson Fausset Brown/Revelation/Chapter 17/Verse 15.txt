15. (Revelation 17:1;
	Isaiah 8:7.) An impious parody of
	Jehovah who "sitteth upon the flood" [ALFORD].
	Also, contrast the "many waters" Isaiah 8:7- :, "Alleluia." 
	peoples, and multitudes, and
	nations, and tonguesâ€”The "peoples," c., here mark the
	universality of the spiritual fornication of the Church. The
	"tongues" remind us of the original Babel, the confusion of
	tongues, the beginning of Babylon, and the first commencement
	of idolatrous apostasy after the flood, as the tower was doubtless
	dedicated to the deified heavens. Thus, Babylon is the appropriate
	name of the harlot. The Pope, as the chief representative of the
	harlot, claims a double supremacy over all peoples, typified
	by the "two swords" according to the interpretation of
	Boniface VIII in the Bull, "Unam Sanctam," and
	represented by the two keys: spiritual as the universal bishop,
	whence he is crowned with the miter and temporal, whence he is also
	crowned with the tiara in token of his imperial supremacy. Contrast
	with the Pope's diadems the "many diadems" of Him
	who alone has claim to, and shall exercise when He shall come, the
	twofold dominion (Revelation 19:12).
