	"his mind," or purpose; while they think only of
	doing their own purpose. 
	to agree—literally, "to
	do" (or accomplish) one mind" or "purpose."

	the rise and downfall of the beast; Greek, "hoi
	logoi," in A, B, and ANDREAS.
	English Version reading is Greek, "ta rhemata,"
	which is not well supported. No mere articulate utterances, but the
	efficient words of Him who is the Word: Greek, "logos."
	fulfilled— ( :-).
