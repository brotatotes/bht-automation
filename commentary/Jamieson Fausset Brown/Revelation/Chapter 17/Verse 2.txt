	particular seat of error be meant, but I incline to think that the
	judgment (Revelation 18:2) and the
	spiritual fornication (Revelation 18:3),

	Protestant, so far as it has been seduced from its "first love"
	(Revelation 2:4) to Christ, the heavenly
	Bridegroom, and given its affections to worldly pomps and idols. The
	woman (Revelation 12:1) is the
	congregation of God in its purity under the Old and New Testament,
	and appears again as the Bride of the Lamb, the transfigured Church
	prepared for the marriage feast. The woman, the invisible Church, is
	latent in the apostate Church, and is the Church militant; the Bride
	is the Church triumphant.
