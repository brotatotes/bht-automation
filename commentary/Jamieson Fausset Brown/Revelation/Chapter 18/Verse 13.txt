13. cinnamon—designed by God
	for better purposes: being an ingredient in the holy anointing oil,
	and a plant in the garden of the Beloved ( :-); but desecrated to vile uses by the adulteress ( :-). 
	odours—of incense. A,
	C, Vulgate, and Syriac prefix "and amomium"
	(a precious hair ointment made from an Asiatic shrub). English
	Version reading is supported by Coptic and ANDREAS,
	but not oldest manuscripts. 
	ointments—Greek,
	"ointment." 
	frankincense—Contrast
	the true "incense" which God loves (Psalms 141:2;
	Malachi 1:11). 
	fine flour—the similago
	of the Latins [ALFORD]. 
	beasts—of burden:
	cattle. 
	slaves—Greek,
	"bodies." 
	souls of men— (Malachi 1:11- :). Said of slaves. Appropriate to the spiritual
	harlot, apostate Christendom, especially Rome, which has so often
	enslaved both bodies and souls of men. Though
	the New Testament does not directly forbid slavery, which would, in
	the then state of the world, have incited a slave revolt, it
	virtually condemns it, as here. Popery has derived its greatest gains
	from the sale of masses for the souls of men after death, and
	of indulgences purchased from the Papal chancery by rich merchants in
	various countries, to be retailed at a profit [MOSHEIM,
	III, 95, 96].
