23. What a blessed contrast is
	Revelation 22:5, respecting the city of
	God: "They need no candle (just as Babylon shall no
	more have the light of a candle, but for a widely
	different reason), for the Lord God giveth them light." 
	candle—Translate as
	Greek, "lamp." 
	bridegroom . . . bride . . .
	no more . . . in thee—Contrast the heavenly city, with its
	Bridegroom, Bride, and blessed marriage supper (Revelation 19:7;
	Revelation 19:9; Revelation 21:2;
	Revelation 21:9; Isaiah 62:4;
	Isaiah 62:5). 
	thy merchants were—So
	most of the best authorities read. But A omits the Greek
	article before "merchants," and then translates, "The
	great men of . . . were thy merchants." 
	sorceries—Greek,
	"sorcery."
