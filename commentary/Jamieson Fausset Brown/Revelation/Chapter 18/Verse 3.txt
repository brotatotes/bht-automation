3. drunk—  :-, from which perhaps "the wine" may have been
	interpolated. They have drunk of her fornication, the
	consequence of which will be wrath to themselves. But A, B,
	and C read, "(owing to the wrath of her fornication all nations)
	have fallen." Vulgate and most versions read as
	English Version, which may be the right reading though not
	supported by the oldest manuscripts. Babylon, the whore, is destroyed
	before the beast slays the two witnesses ( :-), and then the beast himself is destroyed. 
	the wine—so B, Syriac,
	and Coptic. But A, C, and Vulgate omit. 
	abundance—literally,
	"power." 
	delicacies—Greek,
	"luxury." See on  :-,
	where the Greek verb "wax wanton" is akin to the
	noun here. Translate, "wanton luxury." The reference is not
	to earthly merchandise, but to spiritual wares, indulgences,
	idolatries, superstitions, worldly compromises, wherewith the harlot,
	that is, the apostate Church, has made merchandise of men.
	This applies especially to Rome; but the Greek, and even in a
	less degree Protestant churches, are not guiltless. However, the
	principle of evangelical Protestantism is pure, but the
	principle of Rome and the Greek church is not so.
