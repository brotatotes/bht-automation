6. Addressed to the executioners
	of God's wrath. 
	Reward—Greek,
	"repay." 
	she rewarded—English
	Version reading adds "you" with none of the oldest
	manuscripts. But A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic
	omit it. She had not rewarded or repaid the world power
	for some injury which the world power had inflicted on her; but she
	had given the world power that which was its due,
	namely, spiritual delusions, because it did not like to retain God in
	its knowledge; the unfaithful Church's principle was, "Populus
	vult decipi, et decipiatur." "The people like to be
	deceived, and let them be deceived." 
	double—of sorrow.
	Contrast with this the double of joy which Jerusalem shall
	receive for her past suffering (Isaiah 61:7;
	Zechariah 9:12); even as she has
	received double punishment for her sins (Zechariah 9:12- :). 
	unto her—So Syriac,
	Coptic, and ANDREAS.
	A, B, and C omit it. 
	in the cup— (Revelation 18:3;
	Revelation 14:8; Revelation 17:4).
	filled—literally
	"mixed." 
	fill to her double—of
	the Lord's cup of wrath.
