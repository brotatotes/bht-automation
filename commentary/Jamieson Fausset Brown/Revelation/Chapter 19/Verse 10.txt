10. at—Greek, "before."
	John's intending to worship the angel here, as in  :-, on having revealed to him the glory of the new Jerusalem,
	is the involuntary impulse of adoring joy at so blessed a prospect.
	It forms a marked contrast to the sorrowful wonder with which
	he had looked on the Church in her apostasy as the harlot ( :-). It exemplifies the corrupt tendencies of our fallen nature
	that even John, an apostle, should have all but fallen into
	"voluntary humility and worshipping of angels," which Paul
	warns us against. 
	and of thy brethren—that
	is, a fellow servant of thy brethren. 
	have the testimony of
	Jesus—(See on Revelation 19:1). 
	the testimony of—that
	is, respecting Jesus. 
	is the spirit of prophecy—is
	the result of the same spirit of prophecy in you as in myself. We
	angels, and you apostles, all alike have the testimony of (bear
	testimony concerning) Jesus by the operation of one and the same
	Spirit, who enables me to show you these revelations and enables you
	to record them: wherefore we are fellow servants, not I your
	lord to be worshipped by you. Compare Revelation 19:1- :, "I am fellow servant of thee and of thy brethren the
	prophets"; whence the "FOR
	the testimony," c., here, may be explained as giving the reason
	for his adding "and (fellow servant) of thy brethren that have
	the testimony of Jesus." I mean, of the prophets "for
	it is of Jesus that thy brethren, the prophets, testify
	by the Spirit in them." A clear condemnation of Romish
	invocation of saints as if they were our superiors to be adored.
