18. Contrast with this "supper,"
	Revelation 19:17; Revelation 19:18,
	the marriage supper of the Lamb, Revelation 19:18- :. 
	captains—Greek,
	"captains of thousands," that is, chief captains.
	The "kings" are "the ten" who "give their
	power unto the beast." 
	free and bond—specified
	in Revelation 13:16, as "receiving
	the mark of the beast." The repetition of flesh (in the
	Greek it is plural: masses of flesh) five times in this
	verse, marks the gross carnality of the followers of the
	beast. Again, the giving of their flesh to the fowls to eat, is a
	righteous retribution for their not suffering the dead bodies
	of Christ's witnesses to be put in graves.
