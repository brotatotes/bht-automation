 CHAPTER 2 
	
 :-. EPISTLES TO
	EPHESUS, SMYRNA,
	PERGAMOS, THYATIRA.
	 
	Each of the seven epistles in this
	and the third chapter, commences with, "I know thy works."
	Each contains a promise from Christ, "To him that overcometh."
	Each ends with, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the
	Spirit saith unto the churches." The title of our Lord in each
	case accords with the nature of the address, and is mainly taken from
	the imagery of the vision,  :-. Each address has a threat or a promise, and most of the
	addresses have both. Their order seems to be ecclesiastical, civil,
	and geographical: Ephesus first, as being the Asiatic metropolis
	(termed "the light of Asia," and "first city of
	Asia"), the nearest to Patmos, where John received the epistle
	to the seven churches, and also as being that Church with which John
	was especially connected; then the churches on the west coast of
	Asia; then those in the interior. Smyrna and Philadelphia alone
	receive unmixed praise. Sardis and Laodicea receive almost solely
	censure. In Ephesus, Pergamos, and Thyatira, there are some things to
	praise, others to condemn, the latter element preponderating in one
	case (Ephesus), the former in the two others (Pergamos and Thyatira).
	Thus the main characteristics of the different states of different
	churches, in all times and places, are portrayed, and they are
	suitably encouraged or warned.
