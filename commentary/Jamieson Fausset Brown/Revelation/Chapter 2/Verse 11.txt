11. shall not be hurt—Greek,
	"shall not by any means (or possibly) be hurt." 
	the second death—"the
	lake of fire." "The death in life of the lost, as
	contrasted with the life in death of the saved" [TRENCH].
	The phrase "the second death" is peculiar to the
	Apocalypse. What matter about the first death, which sooner or later
	must pass over us, if we escape the second death? "It
	seems that they who die that death shall be hurt by it;
	whereas, if it were annihilation, and so a conclusion of their
	torments, it would be no way hurtful, but highly beneficial to them.
	But the living torments are the second death" [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. "The life
	of the damned is death" [AUGUSTINE].
	Smyrna (meaning myrrh) yielded its sweet perfume in being
	bruised even to death. Myrrh was used in embalming dead bodies ( :-); was an ingredient in the holy anointing oil ( :-); a perfume of the heavenly Bridegroom ( :-), and of the bride ( :-). "Affliction, like it, is bitter for the time
	being, but salutary; preserving the elect from corruption,
	and seasoning them for immortality, and gives scope for the
	exercise of the fragrantly breathing Christian virtues"
	[VITRINGA]. POLYCARP'S
	noble words to his heathen judges who wished him to recant, are well
	known: "Fourscore and six years have I served the Lord, and He
	never wronged me, how then can I blaspheme my King and Saviour?"
	Smyrna's faithfulness is rewarded by its candlestick not having been
	removed out of its place (Revelation 2:5);
	Christianity has never wholly left it; whence the Turks call it,
	"Infidel Smyrna."
