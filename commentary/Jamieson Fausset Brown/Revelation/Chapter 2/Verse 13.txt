13. I know thy works—Two
	oldest manuscripts omit this clause; one oldest manuscript retains
	it. 
	Satan's seat—rather as
	the Greek is translated all through Revelation, "throne."
	Satan, in impious mimicry of God's heavenly throne, sets up his
	earthly throne (Revelation 4:2).
	Æsculapius was worshipped there under the serpent form; and Satan,
	the old serpent, as the instigator (compare Revelation 4:2- :) of fanatical devotees of Æsculapius, and, through them, of
	the supreme magistracy at Pergamos, persecuted one of the Lord's
	people (Antipas) even to death. Thus, this address is an anticipatory
	preface to Revelation 12:1-17;
	Note: "throne . . . the dragon, Satan . . . war
	with her seed," Revelation 12:5;
	Revelation 12:9; Revelation 12:17.
	even in those days—Two
	oldest manuscripts omit "even"; two retain it. 
	wherein—Two oldest
	manuscripts omit this (then translate, "in the days of Antipas,
	My faithful witness," or "martyr"); two retain it. Two
	oldest manuscripts read, "My witness, MY faithful one"; two
	read as English Version. Antipas is another form for
	Antipater. SIMEON
	METAPHRASTES has a
	palpably legendary story, unknown to the early Fathers, that Antipas,
	in Domitian's reign, was shut up in a red-hot brazen bull, and ended
	his life in thanksgivings and prayers. HENGSTENBERG
	makes the name, like other apocalyptic names, symbolical, meaning one
	standing out "against all" for Christ's sake.
