16. The three oldest manuscripts
	read, "Repent, therefore." Not only the
	Nicolaitanes, but the whole Church of Pergamos is called on to repent
	of not having hated the Nicolaitane teaching and practice.
	Contrast Paul, Acts 20:26. 
	I will come—I am

	fight against them—Greek,
	"war with them"; with the Nicolaitanes primarily; but
	including also chastisement of the whole Church at Pergamos:
	compare "unto THEE."
	with the sword of my
	mouth—resumed from Revelation 1:16,
	but with an allusion to the drawn sword with which the angel
	of the Lord confronted Balaam on his way to curse Israel: an earnest
	of the sword by which he and the seduced Israelites fell at
	last. The spiritual Balaamites of John's day are to be smitten with
	the Lord's spiritual sword, the word or "rod of His mouth."
