6. But—How graciously, after
	necessary censure, He returns to praise for our consolation, and as
	an example to us, that we would show, when we reprove, we have
	more pleasure in praising than in fault-finding. 
	hatest the deeds—We
	should hate men's evil deeds, not hate the men themselves. 
	Nicolaitanes—IRENÆUS
	[Against Heresies, 1.26.3] and TERTULLIAN
	[Prescription against Heretics, 46] make these followers of
	Nicolas, one of the seven (honorably mentioned, Acts 6:3;
	Acts 6:5). They (CLEMENT
	OF ALEXANDRIA
	[Miscellanies, 2.20 3.4] and EPIPHANIUS
	[Heresies, 25]) evidently confound the latter Gnostic
	Nicolaitanes, or followers of one Nicolaos, with those of Revelation.
	MICHAELIS' view is
	probable: Nicolaos (conqueror of the people) is the Greek
	version of Balaam, from Hebrew "Belang Am,"
	"Destroyer of the people." Revelation abounds in such
	duplicate Hebrew and Greek names: as Apollyon, Abaddon:
	Devil, Satan: Yea (Greek, "Nai"), Amen. The
	name, like other names, Egypt, Babylon, Sodom, is symbolic. Compare
	Revelation 2:14; Revelation 2:15,
	which shows the true sense of Nicolaitanes; they are not a sect, but
	professing Christians who, like Balaam of old. tried to introduce
	into the Church a false freedom, that is, licentiousness; this was a
	reaction in the opposite direction from Judaism, the first danger to
	the Church combated in the council of Jerusalem, and by Paul in the
	Epistle to Galatians. These symbolical Nicolaitanes, or followers of
	Balaam, abused Paul's doctrine of the grace of God into a plea for
	lasciviousness (2 Peter 2:15; 2 Peter 2:16;
	2 Peter 2:19; Judges 1:4;
	Judges 1:11 who both describe the
	same sort of seducers as followers of Balaam). The difficulty
	that they should appropriate a name branded with infamy in Scripture
	is met by TRENCH: The
	Antinomian Gnostics were so opposed to John as a Judaizing apostle
	that they would assume as a name of chiefest honor one which John
	branded with dishonor.
