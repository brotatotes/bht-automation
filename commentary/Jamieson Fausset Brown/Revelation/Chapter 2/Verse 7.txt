7. He that hath an ear—This
	clause precedes the promise in the first three addresses, succeeds it
	in the last four. Thus the promises are enclosed on both sides with
	the precept urging the deepest attention as to the most momentous
	truths. Every man "hath an ear" naturally, but he alone
	will be able to hear spiritually to whom God has given "the
	hearing ear"; whose "ear God hath wakened" and
	"opened." Compare "Faith, the ears of the soul"
	[CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA].
	the Spirit saith—What
	Christ saith, the Spirit saith; so one are the Second
	and Third Persons. 
	unto the churches—not
	merely to the particular, but to the universal Church. 
	overcometh—In John's
	Gospel (John 16:33) and First
	Epistle (1 John 2:13; 1 John 2:14;
	1 John 5:4; 1 John 5:5)
	an object follows, namely, "the world," "the wicked
	one." Here, where the final issue is spoken of, the conqueror
	is named absolutely. Paul uses a similar image (1 Corinthians 9:24;
	1 Corinthians 9:25; 2 Timothy 2:5;
	but not the same as John's phrase, except 2 Timothy 2:5- :). 
	will I give—as the
	Judge. The tree of life in Paradise, lost by the fall, is restored by
	the Redeemer. Allusions to it occur in Proverbs 3:18;
	Proverbs 11:30; Proverbs 13:12;
	Proverbs 15:4, and prophetically,
	Revelation 22:2; Revelation 22:14;
	Ezekiel 47:12; compare Ezekiel 47:12- :. It is interesting to note how closely these introductory
	addresses are linked to the body of Revelation. Thus, the tree of
	life here, with Revelation 22:1;
	deliverance from the second death (Revelation 22:1- :), with Revelation 20:14;
	Revelation 21:8; the new name (Revelation 21:8- :), with Revelation 14:1; power
	over the nations, with Revelation 20:4;
	the morning star (Revelation 2:28),
	with Revelation 22:16; the white
	raiment (Revelation 3:5), with
	Revelation 4:4; Revelation 16:15;
	the name in the book of life (Revelation 16:15- :), with Revelation 13:8; Revelation 20:15;
	the new Jerusalem and its citizenship (Revelation 20:15- :), with Revelation 21:10. 
	give . . . tree of life—The
	thing promised corresponds to the kind of faithfulness manifested.
	They who refrain from Nicolaitane indulgences (Revelation 21:10- :) and idol-meats (Revelation 2:14;
	Revelation 2:15), shall eat of meat
	infinitely superior, namely, the fruit of the tree of life, and the
	hidden manna (Revelation 2:17). 
	in the midst of the
	paradise—The oldest manuscripts omit "the midst of."
	In Genesis 2:9 these words are
	appropriate, for there were other trees in the garden, but not
	in the midst of it. Here the tree of life is simply in
	the paradise, for no other tree is mentioned in it; in Genesis 2:9- : the tree of life is "in the midst of the street
	of Jerusalem"; from this the clause was inserted here. Paradise
	(a Persian, or else Semitic word), originally used of any garden of
	delight; then specially of Eden; then the temporary abode of separate
	souls in bliss; then "the Paradise of God," the
	third heaven, the immediate presence of God. 
	of God— (Genesis 2:9- :). One oldest manuscript, with Vulgate, Syriac, and
	Coptic, and CYPRIAN,
	read, "MY God,"
	as in Revelation 3:12. So Christ calls
	God, "My God and your God" (Revelation 3:12- :; compare Ephesians 1:17).
	God is our God, in virtue of being peculiarly Christ's
	God. The main bliss of Paradise is that it is the Paradise of God;
	God Himself dwelling there (Ephesians 1:17- :).
