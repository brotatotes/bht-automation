	the beast and the false
	prophet are— (Revelation 19:20).
	day and night—figurative
	for without intermission (Revelation 19:20- :), such as now is caused by night interposing between day and

	beast and the false prophet led the former conspiracy against Christ
	and His people, so Satan in person heads the last conspiracy. Satan
	shall not be permitted to enter this Paradise regained, to show the
	perfect security of believers, unlike the first Adam whom Satan
	succeeded in robbing of Paradise; and shall, like Pharaoh at the Rod
	Sea, receive in this last attempt his final doom. 
	for ever and ever—Greek,
	"to the ages of the ages."
