2. And I John—"John"
	is omitted in A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS;
	also the "I" in the Greek of these authorities is
	not emphatic. The insertion of "I John" in the Greek
	would somewhat interfere with the close connection which subsists
	between "the new heaven and earth,"  :-, and the "new Jerusalem" in this verse. 
	Jerusalem . . . out of
	heaven— (Revelation 3:12; Galatians 4:26,
	"Jerusalem which is above"; Hebrews 11:10;
	Hebrews 12:22; Hebrews 13:14).
	The descent of the new Jerusalem out of heaven is
	plainly distinct from the earthly Jerusalem in which Israel in
	the flesh shall dwell during the millennium, and follows on the
	creation of the new heaven and earth. John in his Gospel always
	writes [Greek] Hierosoluma of the old city; in the
	Apocalypse always Hierousaleem of the heavenly city (Hebrews 13:14- :). Hierousaleem is a Hebrew name, the original
	and holy appellation. Hierosoluma is the common Greek
	term, used in a political sense. Paul observes the same distinction
	when refuting Judaism (Galatians 4:26;
	compare Galatians 1:17; Galatians 1:18;
	Galatians 2:1; Hebrews 12:22),
	though not so in the Epistles to Romans and Corinthians [BENGEL].
	bride—made up of the
	blessed citizens of "the holy city." There is no longer
	merely a Paradise as in Eden (though there is that also, Hebrews 12:22- :), no longer a mere garden, but now the city of God on
	earth, costlier, statelier, and more glorious, but at the same time
	the result of labor and pains such as had not to be expended by man
	in dressing the primitive garden of Eden. "The lively stones"
	were severally in time laboriously chiselled into shape, after the
	pattern of "the Chief corner-stone," to prepare them for
	the place which they shall everlastingly fill in the heavenly
	Jerusalem.
