25. not be shut . . . by
	dayâ€”therefore shall never be shut: for it shall always
	be day. Gates are usually shut by night: but in it shall be no night.
	There shall be continual free ingress into it, so as that all which
	is blessed and glorious may continually be brought into it. So in the
	millennial type.
