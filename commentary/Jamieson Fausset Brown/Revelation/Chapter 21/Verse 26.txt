26. All that was truly glorious
	and excellent in the earth and its converted nations shall be
	gathered into it; and while all shall form one Bride, there
	shall be various orders among the redeemed, analogous to the
	divisions of nations on earth constituting the one great human
	family, and to the various orders of angels.
