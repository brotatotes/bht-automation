27. anything that defileth—Greek,
	"koinoun." A and B read [koinon,] "anything
	unclean." 
	in the Lamb's book of
	life—(See on Revelation 21:2; Revelation 21:2- :). As all the filth of the old Jerusalem was carried outside

	glories of the heavenly city, is he also who speaks most plainly of
	the terrors of hell. On Revelation 21:26;
	Revelation 21:27, ALFORD

	above what is written, and not at all required by the sacred text:
	compare Note, see on Revelation 21:27- :.
