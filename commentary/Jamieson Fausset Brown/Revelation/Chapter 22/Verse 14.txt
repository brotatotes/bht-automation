	But A, Aleph, and Vulgate read, "(Blessed are they
	that) wash their robes," namely, in the blood of the

	This reading takes away the pretext for the notion of salvation by

	with salvation by grace; for God's first and grand Gospel
	"commandment" is to believe on Jesus. Thus our "right"
	to (Greek, "privilege" or "lawful authority
	over") the tree of life is due not to our doings, but to what He
	has done for us. The right, or privilege, is founded,
	not on our merits, but on God's grace.
