19. book—None of our
	manuscripts read this. A, B, Aleph, Vulgate, Syriac,
	and Coptic read, "(take away his part, that is, portion)
	from the tree of life," that is, shall deprive him of
	participation in the tree of life. 
	and from the things—so
	Vulgate. But A, B, Aleph, Syriac, Coptic, and
	ANDREAS omit "and";
	then "which are written in this book" will refer to "the
	holy city and the tree of life." As in the beginning of this
	book (Revelation 1:3) a blessing was
	promised to the devout, obedient student of it, so now at its close a
	curse is denounced against those who add to, or take from, it.
