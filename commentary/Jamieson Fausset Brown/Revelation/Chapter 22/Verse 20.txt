20. Amen. Even so, comeâ€”The
	Song of Solomon (Song of Solomon 8:14)
	closes with the same yearning prayer for Christ's coming. A, B, and
	Aleph omit "Even so," Greek, "nai":
	then translate for Amen, "So be it, come, Lord
	Jesus"; joining the "Amen," or "So be it,"
	not with Christ's saying (for He calls Himself the "Amen"
	at the beginning of sentences, rather than puts it as a confirmation
	at the end), but with John's reply. Christ's "I come," and
	John's "Come," are almost coincident in time; so truly does
	the believer reflect the mind of his Lord.
