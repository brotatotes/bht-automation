	Christ—so B, Vulgate,
	Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS.
	But A and Aleph omit. 
	with you all—so none of
	our manuscripts. B has, "with all the saints." A and
	Vulgate have, "with all." Aleph has, "with
	the saints." This closing benediction, Paul's mark in his
	Epistles, was after Paul's death taken up by John. The Old Testament
	ended with a "curse" in connection with the law; the
	New Testament ends with a blessing in union with the Lord Jesus. 
	Amen—so B, Aleph,
	and ANDREAS. A and Vulgate
	Fuldensis omit it. 
	May the Blessed Lord who has
	caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our learning, bless this
	humble effort to make Scripture expound itself, and make it an
	instrument towards the conversion of sinners and the edification of
	saints, to the glory of His great name and the hastening of His
	kingdom! Amen.
