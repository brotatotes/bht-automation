1. Sardis—the ancient capital
	of Lydia, the kingdom of wealthy Croesus, on the river Pactolus. The
	address to this Church is full of rebuke. It does not seem to have
	been in vain; for MELITO,
	bishop of Sardis in the second century, was eminent for piety and
	learning. He visited Palestine to assure himself and his flock as to
	the Old Testament canon and wrote an epistle on the subject [EUSEBIUS
	Ecclesiastical History, 4.26]; he also wrote a commentary on
	the Apocalypse [EUSEBIUS,
	Ecclesiastical History, 4.26; JEROME,
	On Illustrious Men, 24]. 
	he that hath the seven
	Spirits of God—that is, He who hath all the fulness of the
	Spirit (Revelation 1:4; Revelation 4:5;
	Revelation 5:6, with which compare
	Zechariah 3:9; Zechariah 4:10,
	proving His Godhead). This attribute implies His infinite power by
	the Spirit to convict of sin and of a hollow profession. 
	and the seven stars—
	(Revelation 1:16; Revelation 1:20).
	His having the seven stars, or presiding ministers, flows, as
	a consequence, from His having the seven Spirits, or the
	fulness of the Holy Spirit. The human ministry is the fruit of
	Christ's sending down the gifts of the Spirit. Stars imply
	brilliancy and glory; the fulness of the Spirit, and the fulness of
	brilliant light in Him, form a designed contrast to the formality
	which He reproves. 
	name . . . livest . . . dead—
	(1 Timothy 5:6; 2 Timothy 3:5;
	Titus 1:16; compare Ephesians 2:1;
	Ephesians 2:5; Ephesians 5:14).
	"A name," that is, a reputation. Sardis was famed among the
	churches for spiritual vitality; yet the Heart-searcher, who
	seeth not as man seeth, pronounces her dead; how great
	searchings of heart should her case create among even the best of us!
	Laodicea deceived herself as to her true state (Ephesians 5:14- :), but it is not written that she had a high name
	among the other churches, as Sardis had.
