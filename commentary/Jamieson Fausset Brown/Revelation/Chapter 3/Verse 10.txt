	"The word of My endurance" is My Gospel word, which
	teaches patient endurance in expectation of my coming ( :-). My endurance is the endurance which I require, and
	which I practice. Christ Himself now endures, patiently
	waiting until the usurper be cast out, and all "His enemies be

	Revelation 9:21; Revelation 16:11;
	Revelation 16:21). The particular
	persecutions which befell Philadelphia shortly after, were the
	earnest of the great last tribulation before Christ's coming, to
	which the Church's attention in all ages is directed.
