15. neither coldâ€”The
	antithesis to "hot," literally, "boiling"
	("fervent," Acts 18:25;
	Romans 12:11; compare Song of Solomon 8:6;
	Luke 24:32), requires that "cold"
	should here mean more than negatively cold; it is rather, positively
	icy cold: having never yet been warmed. The Laodiceans were in
	spiritual things cold comparatively, but not cold as
	the world outside, and as those who had never belonged to the Church.
	The lukewarm state, if it be the transitional stage to a warmer, is a
	desirable state (for a little religion, if real, is better than
	none); but most fatal when, as here, an abiding condition, for it is
	mistaken for a safe state (Luke 24:32- :). This accounts for Christ's desiring that they were cold
	rather than lukewarm. For then there would not be the same
	"danger of mixed motive and disregarded principle"
	[ALFORD]. Also, there is
	more hope of the "cold," that is, those who are of the
	world, and not yet warmed by the Gospel call; for, when called, they
	may become hot and fervent Christians: such did the once-cold
	publicans, Zaccheus and Matthew, become. But the lukewarm has
	been brought within reach of the holy fire, without being heated by
	it into fervor: having religion enough to lull the conscience
	in false security, but not religion enough to save the soul: as
	Demas, 2 Timothy 4:10. Such were the
	halters between two opinions in Israel (2 Timothy 4:10- :; compare 2 Kings 17:41;
	Matthew 6:24).
