16. neither cold nor hot—So
	one oldest manuscript, B, and Vulgate read. But two oldest
	manuscripts, Syriac, and Coptic transpose thus, "hot
	nor cold." It is remarkable that the Greek adjectives are
	in the masculine, agreeing with the angel, not feminine, agreeing
	with the Church. The Lord addresses the angel as the embodiment and
	representative of the Church. The chief minister is answerable for
	his flock if he have not faithfully warned the members of it. 
	I will—Greek, "I
	am about to," "I am ready to": I have it in my mind:
	implying graciously the possibility of the threat not being executed,
	if only they repent at once. His dealings towards them will depend on
	theirs towards Him. 
	spue thee out of my
	month—reject with righteous loathing, as Canaan spued out its
	inhabitants for their abominations. Physicians used lukewarm
	water to cause vomiting. Cold and hot drinks were
	common at feasts, but never lukewarm. There were hot and cold
	springs near Laodicea.
