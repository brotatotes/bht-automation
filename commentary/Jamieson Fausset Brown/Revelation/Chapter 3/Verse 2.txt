2. Be—Greek. "Become,"
	what thou art not, "watchful," or "wakeful,"
	literally, "waking." 
	the things which
	remain—Strengthen those thy remaining few graces, which, in thy
	spiritual deadly slumber, are not yet quite extinct [ALFORD].
	"The things that remain" can hardly mean "the PERSONS
	that are not yet dead, but are ready to die"; for  :- implies that the "few" faithful ones at Sardis were
	not "ready to die," but were full of life. 
	are—The two oldest
	manuscripts read, "were ready," literally, "were about
	to die," namely, at the time when you "strengthen"
	them. This implies that "thou art dead,"  :-, is to be taken with limitation; for those must have some
	life who are told to strengthen the things that remain.
perfect—literally,
	"filled up in full complement"; Translate, "complete."
	Weighed in the balance of Him who requires living faith as the motive
	of works, and found wanting. 
	before God—Greek,
	"in the sight of God." The three oldest manuscripts,
	Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic, read, "before (in the
	sight of) MY God"; Christ's judgment is God the Father's
	judgment. In the sight of men, Sardis had "a name of living":
	"so many and so great are the obligations of pastors, that he
	who would in reality fulfil even a third of them, would be esteemed
	holy by men, whereas, if content with that alone, he would be sure
	not to escape hell" [JUAN
	D'AVILA]. Note: in Sardis
	and Laodicea alone of the seven we read of no conflict with foes
	within or without the Church. Not that either had renounced the
	appearance of opposition to the world; but neither had the
	faithfulness to witness for God by word and example, so as to
	"torment them that dwelt on the earth" ( :-).
