8. I have set—Greek,
	"given": it is My gracious gift to thee. 
	open door—for
	evangelization; a door of spiritual usefulness. The opening of a
	door by Him to the Philadelphian Church accords with the previous
	assignation to Him of "the key of David." 
	and—The three oldest
	manuscripts, A, B, C, and ORIGEN
	read, "which no man can shut." 
	for—"because."
	a little—This gives the
	idea that Christ says, He sets before Philadelphia an open door
	because she has some little strength; whereas the sense rather
	is, He does so because she has "but little strength":
	being consciously weak herself, she is the fitter object for God's
	power to rest on [so AQUINAS],
	that so the Lord Christ may have all the glory. 
	and hast kept—and
	so, the littleness of thy strength becoming the source of
	Almighty power to thee, as leading thee to rest wholly on My great
	power, thou hast kept My word. GROTIUS
	makes "little strength" to mean that she had a Church small
	in numbers and external resources: "a little flock poor in
	worldly goods, and of small account in the eyes of men"
	[TRENCH]. So ALFORD.
	I prefer the view given above. The Greek verbs are in the
	aorist tense: "Thou didst keep . . . didst not deny My name":
	alluding to some particular occasion when her faithfulness was put to
	the test.
