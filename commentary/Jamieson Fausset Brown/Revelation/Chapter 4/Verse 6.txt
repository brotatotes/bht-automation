6. Two oldest manuscripts, A, B,
	Vulgate, Coptic, and Syriac read, "As it were
	a sea of glass." 
	like . . . crystal—not
	imperfectly transparent as the ancient common glass, but like rock
	crystal. Contrast the turbid "many waters" on which the
	harlot "sitteth" (Revelation 17:1;
	Revelation 17:15). Compare Revelation 17:15- :, "the sky . . . as a molten looking-glass." Thus,
	primarily, the pure ether which separates God's throne from John, and
	from all things before it, may be meant, symbolizing the "purity,
	calmness, and majesty of God's rule" [ALFORD].
	But see the analogue in the temple, the molten sea before the
	sanctuary (see on Revelation 4:4,
	above). There is in this sea depth and transparency, but not the
	fluidity and instability of the natural sea (compare Revelation 4:4- :). It stands solid, calm, and clear, God's judgments
	are called "a great deep" (Revelation 4:4- :). In Revelation 15:2 it is a
	"sea of glass mingled with fire." Thus there is
	symbolized here the purificatory baptism of water and the Spirit of
	all who are made "kings and priests unto God." In Revelation 15:2- : the baptism with the fire of trial is meant. Through both
	all the king-priests have to pass in coming to God: His judgments,
	which overwhelm the ungodly, they stand firmly upon, as on a solid
	sea of glass; able like Christ to walk on the sea, as though it were
	solid. 
	round about the throne—one
	in the midst of each side of the throne. 
	four beasts—The Greek
	for "beasts," Revelation 13:1;
	Revelation 13:11, is different, therion,
	the symbol for the carnal man by opposition to God losing his true
	glory, as lord, under Him, of the lower creatures, and degraded to
	the level of the beast. Here it is zoon, "living
	creatures"; not beast.
