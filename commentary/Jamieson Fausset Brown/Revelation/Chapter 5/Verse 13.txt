13. The universal chorus of
	creation, including the outermost circles as well as the inner (of
	saints and angels), winds up the doxology. The full
	accomplishment of this is to be when Christ takes His great power and
	reigns visibly. 
	every creature—"all
	His works in all places of His dominion" ( :-). 
	under the earth—the
	departed spirits in Hades. 
	such as are—So B and
	Vulgate. But A omits this. 
	in the sea—Greek,
	"upon the sea": the sea animals which are regarded
	as being on the surface [ALFORD].
	all that are in them—So
	Vulgate reads. A omits "all (things)" here (Greek,
	"panta"), and reads, "I heard all (Greek,
	"pantas") saying": implying the harmonious
	concert of all in the four quarters of the universe. 
	Blessing, &c.—Greek,
	"the blessing, the honor, and the glory,
	and the might to the ages of the ages." The fourfold
	ascription indicates world-wide universality.
