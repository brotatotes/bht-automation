4. and to readâ€”inserted in
	English Version Greek text without good authority. One oldest
	manuscript, ORIGEN,
	CYPRIAN, and HILARY
	omit the clause. "To read" would be awkward standing
	between "to open the book" and "to look thereon."
	John having been promised a revelation of "things which must be
	hereafter," weeps now at his earnest desire being
	apparently frustrated. He is a pattern to us to imitate, as an eager
	and teachable learner of the Apocalypse.
