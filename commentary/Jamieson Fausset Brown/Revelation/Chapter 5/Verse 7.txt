7. The book lay on the open hand
	of Him that sat on the throne for any to take who was found worthy
	[ALFORD]. The Lamb takes
	it from the Father in token of formal investiture into His universal
	and everlasting dominion as Son of man. This introductory vision thus
	presents before us, in summary, the consummation to which all the
	events in the seals, trumpets, and vials converge, namely, the
	setting up of Christ's kingdom visibly. Prophecy ever hurries to the
	grand crisis or end, and dwells on intermediate events only in their
	typical relation to, and representation of, the end.
