10. How long—Greek,
	"Until when?" As in the parable the woman (symbol of the
	Church) cries day and night to the unjust judge for justice
	against her adversary who is always oppressing her (compare below,  :-); so the elect (not only on earth, but under Christ's
	covering, and in His presence in Paradise) cry day and night
	to God, who will assuredly, in His own time, avenge His and their
	cause, "though He bear long with them." These
	passages need not be restricted to some particular martyrdoms,
	but have been, and are receiving, and shall receive partial
	fulfilments, until their last exhaustive fulfilment before Christ's
	coming. So as to the other events foretold here. The glory even of
	those in Paradise will only be complete when Christ's and the
	Church's foes are cast out, and the earth will become Christ's
	kingdom at His coming to raise the sleeping saints. 
	Lord—Greek,
	"Master"; implying that He has them and their foes and all
	His creatures as absolutely at His disposal, as a master has his
	slaves; hence, in Revelation 6:11,
	"fellow servants," or fellow slaves follows. 
	holy—Greek, "the
	Holy one." 
	avenge—"exact
	vengeance for our blood." 
	on—Greek, "from
	them." 
	that dwell on the earth—the
	ungodly, of earth, earthly, as distinguished from the Church, whose
	home and heart are even now in heavenly places.
