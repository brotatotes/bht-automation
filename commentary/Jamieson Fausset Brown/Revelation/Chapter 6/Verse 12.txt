12. As Revelation 6:4;
	Revelation 6:6-8, the sword,
	famine, and pestilence, answer to Matthew 24:6;
	Matthew 24:7; Revelation 6:9;
	Revelation 6:10, as to martyrdoms,
	answer to Matthew 24:9; Matthew 24:10;
	so this passage, Revelation 6:12;
	Revelation 6:17, answers to Matthew 24:29;
	Matthew 24:30, "the sun shall be
	darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall
	fall from heaven; . . . then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn,
	and they shall see the Son of man coming"; imagery describing
	the portents of the immediate coming of the day of the Lord;
	but not the coming itself until the elect are sealed, and the
	judgments invoked by the martyrs descend on the earth, the sea, and
	the trees (Revelation 7:1-3). 
	and, lo—So A reads. But
	B and C omit "lo." 
	earthquake—Greek,
	"shaking" of the heavens, the sea, and the dry land;
	the shaking of these mutable things being the necessary preliminary
	to the setting up of those things which cannot be shaken. This
	is one of the catchwords [WORDSWORTH]
	connecting the sixth seal with the sixth trumpet (Revelation 7:1-66.7.3- :) and the seventh vial (Revelation 7:1-66.7.3- :); also the seventh seal (Revelation 7:1-66.7.3- :). 
	sackcloth—One kind,
	made of the "hair" of Cilician goats, was called
	"cilicium," or Cilician cloth, and was used for tents, c.
	Paul, a Cilician, made such tents (Revelation 7:1-66.7.3- :). 
	moon—A, B, C, and
	oldest versions read, "the whole moon" the full moon; not
	merely the crescent moon. 
	as blood— (Revelation 7:1-66.7.3- :).
