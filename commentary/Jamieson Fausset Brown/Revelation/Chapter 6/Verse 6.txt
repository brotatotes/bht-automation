6. a voice—Two oldest
	manuscripts, A, C, read, "as it were a voice." B
	reads as English Version. The voice is heard "in the
	midst of the four living creatures" (as Jehovah in the
	Shekinah-cloud manifested His presence between the cherubim); because
	it is only for the sake of, and in connection with, His redeemed,
	that God mitigates His judgments on the earth. 
	A measure—"A
	choelignix." While making food scarce, do not make it so much so
	that a choelignix (about a day's provision of wheat, variously
	estimated at two or three pints) shall not be obtainable "for a
	penny" (denarius, eight and a half pence of our money,
	probably the day's wages of a laborer). Famine generally
	follows the sword. Ordinarily, from sixteen to twenty measures
	were given for a denarius. The sword, famine, noisome beasts,
	and the pestilence, are God's four judgments on the earth. A
	spiritual famine, too, may be included in the judgment. The "Come,"
	in the case of this third seal, is said by the third of the four
	living creatures, whose likeness is a man indicative of
	sympathy and human compassion for the sufferers. God in it tempers
	judgment with mercy. Compare  :-, which indicates the very calamities foretold in these
	seals, nation rising against nation (the sword), famines,
	pestilences (Revelation 6:8), and
	earthquakes (Revelation 6:12). 
	three measures of barley for
	a penny—the cheaper and less nutritious grain, bought by the
	laborer who could not buy enough wheat for his family with his day's
	wages, a denarius, and, therefore, buys barley. 
	see thou hurt not the oil,
	and the wine—the luxuries of life, rather than necessaries; the
	oil and wine were to be spared for the refreshment of the sufferers.
