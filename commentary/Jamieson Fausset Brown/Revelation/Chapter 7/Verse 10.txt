10. cried—Greek, "cry,"
	in the three oldest manuscripts, A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, and
	Coptic. It is their continuing, ceaseless employment. 
	Salvation—literally,
	"THE salvation";
	all the praise of our salvation be ascribed to our God. At the Lord's
	entry into Jerusalem, the type, similarly "salvation" is
	the cry of the palm-bearing multitudes. Hosanna means "save
	us now"; taken from  :-, in which Psalm (Psalms 118:14;
	Psalms 118:15; Psalms 118:21;
	Psalms 118:26) the same connection
	occurs between salvation, the tabernacles of the
	righteous, and the Jews' cry to be repeated by the whole nation at
	Christ's coming, "Blessed be He that cometh in the name of the
	Lord."
