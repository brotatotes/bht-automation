4. Twelve is the number
	of the tribes, and appropriate to the Church: three by four:
	three, the divine number, multiplied by four, the number for
	world-wide extension. Twelve by twelve implies fixity and
	completeness, which is taken a thousandfold in 144,000. A
	thousand implies the world perfectly pervaded by the
	divine; for it is ten, the world number, raised to the
	power of three, the number of God. 
	of all the tribes—literally,
	"out of every tribe"; not 144,000 of each tribe, but the
	aggregate of the twelve thousand from every tribe.
children—Greek,
	"sons of Israel." Revelation 3:12;
	Revelation 21:12, are no objection, as
	ALFORD thinks, to the
	literal Israel being meant; for, in consummated glory, still the
	Church will be that "built on the foundation of the (Twelve)
	apostles (Israelites), Jesus Christ (an Israelite) being the chief
	corner-stone." Gentile believers shall have the name of
	Jerusalem written on them, in that they shall share the
	citizenship antitypical to that of the literal Jerusalem.
