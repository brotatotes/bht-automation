7. The common feature of the
	first four trumpets is, the judgments under them affect natural
	objects, the accessories of life, the earth, trees, grass, the
	sea, rivers, fountains, the light of the sun, moon, and stars. The
	last three, the woe-trumpets ( :-), affect men's life with pain, death, and hell. The language
	is evidently drawn from the plagues of Egypt, five or six out of the
	ten exactly corresponding: the hail, the fire ( :-), the WATER
	turned to blood (Exodus 7:19),
	the darkness (Exodus 10:21),
	the locusts (Exodus 10:12),
	and perhaps the death (Exodus 10:12- :). Judicial retribution in kind characterizes the inflictions
	of the first four, those elements which had been abused punishing
	their abusers. 
	mingled with—A, B, and
	Vulgate read, Greek, ". . . IN
	blood." So in the case of the second and third vials (Revelation 16:3;
	Revelation 16:4). 
	upon the earth—Greek,
	"unto the earth." A, B, Vulgate, and Syriac
	add, "And the third of the earth was burnt up." So under
	the third trumpet, the third of the rivers is affected: also,
	under the sixth trumpet, the third part of men are killed. In
	Zechariah 13:8; Zechariah 13:9
	this tripartite division appears, but the proportions reversed, two
	parts killed, only a third preserved. Here, vice versa, two-thirds
	escape, one-third is smitten. The fire was the predominant element. 
	all green grass—no
	longer a third, but all is burnt up.
