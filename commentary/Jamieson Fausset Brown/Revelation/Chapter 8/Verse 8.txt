8. as it were—not literally a
	mountain: a mountain-like burning mass. There is a plain allusion to
	Jeremiah 51:25; Amos 7:4.
	third part of the sea became
	blood—In the parallel second vial, the whole sea (not
	merely a third) becomes blood. The overthrow of
	Jericho, the type of the Antichristian Babylon, after which Israel,
	under Joshua (the same name as Jesus), victoriously took
	possession of Canaan, the type of Christ's and His people's kingdom,
	is perhaps alluded to in the SEVEN
	trumpets, which end in the overthrow of all Christ's foes, and
	the setting up of His kingdom. On the seventh day, at the
	seventh time, when the seven priests blew the seven
	ram's horn trumpets, the people shouted, and the walls fell flat: and
	then ensued the blood-shedding of the foe. A mountain-like
	fiery mass would not naturally change water into blood; nor would the
	third part of ships be thereby destroyed.
