11. And—so Syriac. But
	A, B, and Aleph, omit "and." 
	had—Greek,
	"have." 
	a king . . . which
	is the angel—English Version, agreeing with
	A, Aleph, reads the (Greek) article before "angel,"
	in which reading we must translate, "They have as king over them
	the angel," c. Satan (compare  :-). Omitting the article with B, we must translate, "They
	have as king an angel," &c.: one of the chief demons
	under Satan: I prefer from Revelation 9:1,
	the former. 
	bottomless pit—Greek,
	"abyss." 
	Abaddon—that is,
	perdition or destruction (Job 26:6
Proverbs 27:20). The locusts are
	supernatural instruments in the hands of Satan to torment, and yet
	not kill, the ungodly, under this fifth trumpet. Just as in the case
	of godly Job, Satan was allowed to torment with elephantiasis, but
	not to touch his life. In Proverbs 27:20- :, these two woe-trumpets are expressly called "plagues."
	ANDREAS OF CÆSAREA,
	A.D. 500, held, in his
	Commentary on Revelation, that the locusts mean evil
	spirits again permitted to come forth on earth and afflict men
	with various plagues.
