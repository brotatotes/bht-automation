12. Greek, "The
	one woe." 
	hereafterâ€”Greek,
	"after these things." I agree with ALFORD
	and DE BURGH,
	that these locusts from the abyss refer to judgments about to
	fall on the ungodly immediately before Christ's second advent. None
	of the interpretations which regard them as past, are satisfactory.
	Joel 1:2-7; Joel 2:1-11,
	is strictly parallel and expressly refers (Joel 2:1-29.2.11- :) to THE DAY OF THE
	LORD GREAT AND VERY TERRIBLE:
	Joel 2:10 gives the portents
	accompanying the day of the Lord's coming, the earth quaking, the
	heavens trembling, the sun, moon, and stars, withdrawing their
	shining: Joel 2:18; Joel 2:31;
	Joel 2:32, also point to the
	immediately succeeding deliverance of Jerusalem: compare also, the
	previous last conflict in the valley of Jehoshaphat, and the dwelling
	of God thenceforth in Zion, blessing Judah. DE
	BURGH confines the locust
	judgment to the Israelite land, even as the sealed in Joel 2:32- : are Israelites: not that there are not others sealed as
	elect in the earth; but that, the judgment being confined to
	Palestine, the sealed of Israel alone needed to be
	expressly excepted from the visitation. Therefore, he translates
	throughout, "the land" (that is, of Israel and Judah),
	instead of "the earth." I incline to agree with him.
