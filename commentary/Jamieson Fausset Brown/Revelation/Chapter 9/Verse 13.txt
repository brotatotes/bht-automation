13. a voice—literally, "one
	voice." 
	from—Greek, "out
	of." 
	the four horns—A,
	Vulgate (Amiatinus manuscript), Coptic, and
	Syriac omit "four." B and CYPRIAN
	support it. The four horns together gave forth their voice,
	not diverse, but one. God's revelation (for example, the
	Gospel), though in its aspects fourfold (four expressing
	world-wide extension: whence four is the number of the
	Evangelists), still has but one and the same voice. However, from the
	parallelism of this sixth trumpet to the fifth seal (Revelation 6:9;
	Revelation 6:10), the martyrs' cry for
	the avenging of their blood from the altar reaching its consummation
	under the sixth seal and sixth trumpet, I prefer understanding this
	cry from the four corners of the altar to refer to the saints'
	prayerful cry from the four quarters of the world, incensed by
	the angel, and ascending to God from the golden altar of incense, and
	bringing down in consequence fiery judgments. Aleph omits the
	whole clause, "one from the four horns."
