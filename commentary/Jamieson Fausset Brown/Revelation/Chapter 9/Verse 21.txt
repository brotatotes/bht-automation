21. sorceries—witchcrafts by
	means of drugs (so the Greek). One of the fruits of the
	unrenewed flesh: the sin of the heathen: about to be repeated by
	apostate Christians in the last days,  :-, "sorcerers." The heathen who shall have rejected
	the proffered Gospel and clung to their fleshly lusts, and apostate
	Christians who shall have relapsed into the same shall share the same
	terrible judgments. The worship of images was established in the East
	in A.D. 842. 
	fornication—singular:
	whereas the other sins are in the plural. Other sins are perpetrated
	at intervals: those lacking purity of heart indulge in one
	perpetual fornication [BENGEL].
