1. Paul—(See on  :-). 
	a servant of Jesus Christ—The
	word here rendered "servant" means "bond-servant,"
	or one subject to the will and wholly at the disposal of another. In
	this sense it is applied to the disciples of Christ at large ( :-), as in the Old Testament to all the people of God ( :-). But as, in addition to this, the prophets and kings of
	Israel were officially "the servants of the Lord"
	(Joshua 1:1; Psalms 18:1,
	title), the apostles call themselves, in the same official sense,
	"the servants of Christ" (as here, and Philippians 1:1;
	James 1:1; 2 Peter 1:1;
	Judges 1:1), expressing such absolute
	subjection and devotion to the Lord Jesus as they would never have
	yielded to a mere creature. (See on Judges 1:1- :; Judges 1:1- :). 
	called to be an apostle—when
	first he "saw the Lord"; the indispensable qualification
	for apostleship. (See on Judges 1:1- :; Judges 1:1- :; Judges 1:1- :). 
	separated unto the—preaching
	of the 
	gospel—neither so late
	as when "the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and
	Saul" (Acts 13:2), nor so
	early as when "separated from his mother's womb"
	(see on Acts 13:2- :). He was called at
	one and the same time to the faith and the apostleship of Christ (Acts 13:2- :). 
	of God—that is, the
	Gospel of which God is the glorious Author. (So Romans 15:16;
	1 Thessalonians 2:2; 1 Thessalonians 2:8;
	1 Thessalonians 2:9; 1 Peter 4:17).
