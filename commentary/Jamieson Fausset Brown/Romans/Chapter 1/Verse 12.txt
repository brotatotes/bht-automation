12. That is, that I may be comforted
	together with you by the mutual faith both of you and meâ€”"Not
	wishing to "lord it over their faith," but rather to be a
	"helper of their joy," the apostle corrects his former
	expressions: my desire is to instruct you and do you good, that is,
	for us to instruct and do one another good: in giving I shall also
	receive" [JOWETT].
	"Nor is he insincere in so speaking, for there is none so poor
	in the Church of Christ who may not impart to us something of value:
	it is only our malignity and pride that hinder us from gathering such
	fruit from every quarter" [CALVIN].
	How "widely different is the apostolic style from that of the
	court of Papal Rome!" [BENGEL].
