13. oftentimes I purposed to come
	unto you, but was let—hindered. 
	hitherto—chiefly by his
	desire to go first to places where Christ was not known ( :-). 
	that I might have some
	fruit—of my ministry 
	among you also, even as among
	other Gentiles—The GENTILE
	origin of the Church at Rome is here so explicitly stated, that those
	who conclude, merely from the Jewish strain of the argument, that
	they must have been mostly Israelites, decide in opposition to the
	apostle himself. (But see on  :-
	to this Epistle.)
