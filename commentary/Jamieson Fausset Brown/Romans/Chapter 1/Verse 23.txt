23. And changed—or
	"exchanged." 
	the glory of the
	uncorruptible God into—or "for" 
	an image . . . like to
	corruptible man—The allusion here is doubtless to the Greek
	worship, and the apostle may have had in his mind those exquisite
	chisellings of the human form which lay so profusely beneath and
	around him as he stood on Mars' Hill; and "beheld their
	devotions." (See on  :-).
	But as if that had not been a deep enough degradation of the living
	God, there was found "a lower deep" still. 
	and to birds, and four-footed
	beasts, and to creeping things—referring now to the Egyptian
	and Oriental worship. In the face of these plain declarations
	of the descent of man's religious belief from loftier to ever
	lower and more debasing conceptions of the Supreme Being, there are
	expositors of this very Epistle (as REICHE
	and JOWETT), who,
	believing neither in any fall from primeval innocence, nor in the
	noble traces of that innocence which lingered even after the fall and
	were only by degrees obliterated by wilful violence to the dictates
	of conscience, maintain that man's religious history has been all
	along a struggle to rise, from the lowest forms of nature
	worship, suited to the childhood of our race, into that which is more
	rational and spiritual.
