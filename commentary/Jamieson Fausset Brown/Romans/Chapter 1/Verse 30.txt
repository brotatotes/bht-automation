30. haters of Godâ€”The word
	usually signifies "God-hated," which some here prefer, in
	the sense of "abhorred of the Lord"; expressing the
	detestableness of their character in His sight (compare Proverbs 22:14;
	Psalms 73:20). But the active sense
	of the word, adopted in our version and by the majority of
	expositors, though rarer, agrees perhaps better with the context.
