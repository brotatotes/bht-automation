9. For God . . . whom I serve—the
	word denotes religious service. 
	with my spirit—from my
	inmost soul. 
	in the gospel of his Son—to
	which Paul's whole religious life and official activity were
	consecrated. 
	is my witness, that without
	ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers—so for the
	Ephesians (Ephesians 1:15; Ephesians 1:16);
	so for the Philippians (Philippians 1:3;
	Philippians 1:4); so for the Colossians
	(Colossians 1:3; Colossians 1:4);
	so for the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 1:2;
	1 Thessalonians 1:3). What catholic love,
	what all-absorbing spirituality, what impassioned devotion to the
	glory of Christ among men!
