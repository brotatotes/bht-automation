2. For I bear them record—or,
	"witness," as he well could from his own sad experience. 
	that they have a zeal
	of—"for" 
	God, but not according to
	knowledge—(Compare Acts 22:3;
	Acts 26:9-11; Galatians 1:13;
	Galatians 1:14). He alludes to this
	well-meaning of his people, notwithstanding their spiritual
	blindness, not certainly to excuse their rejection of Christ and rage
	against His saints, but as some ground of hope regarding them. (See
	1 Timothy 1:13).
