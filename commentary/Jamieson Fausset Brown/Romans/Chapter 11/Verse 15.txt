	them—The apostle had denied that they were east away ( :-); here he affirms it. But both are true; they were
	cast away, though neither totally nor finally, and it is of this
	partial and temporary rejection that the apostle here speaks. 
	be the reconciling of
	the—Gentile

	receiving of them be, but life from the dead?—The reception of
	the whole family of Israel, scattered as they are among all nations
	under heaven, and the most inveterate enemies of the Lord Jesus, will
	be such a stupendous manifestation of the power of God upon the
	spirits of men, and of His glorious presence with the heralds of the
	Cross, as will not only kindle devout astonishment far and wide, but
	so change the dominant mode of thinking and feeling on all spiritual
	things as to seem like a resurrection from the dead.
