22, 23. Behold therefore the
	goodness and severity of God: on them that fell, severity—in
	rejecting the chosen seed. 
	but toward thee,
	goodness—"God's goodness" is the true reading, that
	is, His sovereign goodness in admitting thee to a covenant standing
	who before wert a "stranger to the covenants of promise"
	(Ephesians 2:12-20). 
	if thou continue in his
	goodness—in believing dependence on that pure goodness which
	made thee what thou art.
