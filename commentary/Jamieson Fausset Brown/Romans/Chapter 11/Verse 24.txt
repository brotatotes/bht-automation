	cut off" 
	from the olive tree, which is
	wild by nature, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive
	tree; how much more shall these, c.—This is just the converse
	of Romans 11:21: "As the
	excision of the merely engrafted Gentiles through unbelief is
	a thing much more to be expected than was the excision of the natural
	Israel, before it happened so the restoration of Israel, when they
	shall be brought to believe in Jesus, is a thing far more in the line
	of what we should expect, than the admission of the Gentiles to a
	standing which they never before enjoyed."
