31. Even so have these—the
	Jews. 
	now not believed—or,
	"now been disobedient" 
	that through your mercy—the
	mercy shown to you. 
	they also may obtain
	mercy—Here is an entirely new idea. The apostle has hitherto
	dwelt upon the unbelief of the Jews as making way for the faith of
	the Gentiles—the exclusion of the one occasioning the reception of
	the other; a truth yielding to generous, believing Gentiles but
	mingled satisfaction. Now, opening a more cheering prospect, he
	speaks of the mercy shown to the Gentiles as a means of Israel's
	recovery; which seems to mean that it will be by the instrumentality
	of believing Gentiles that Israel as a nation is at length to "look
	on Him whom they have pierced and mourn for Him," and so to
	"obtain mercy." (See 2 Corinthians 3:15;
	2 Corinthians 3:16).
