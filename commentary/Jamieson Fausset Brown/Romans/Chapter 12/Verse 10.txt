10. Be, 
	c.â€”better, "In brotherly love be affectionate one to another
	in [giving, or showing] honor, outdoing each other." The word
	rendered "prefer" means rather "to go before,"
	"take the lead," that is, "show an example." How
	opposite is this to the reigning morality of the heathen world! and
	though Christianity has so changed the spirit of society, that a
	certain beautiful disinterestedness and self-sacrifice shines in the
	character of not a few who are but partially, if at all under the
	transforming power of the Gospel, it is only those whom "the
	love of Christ constrains to live not unto themselves," who are
	capable of thoroughly acting in the spirit of this precept.
