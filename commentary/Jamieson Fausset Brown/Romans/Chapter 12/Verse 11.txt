	word rendered "business" means "zeal,"
	"diligence," "purpose"; denoting the energy of

	serving the Lord—that
	is, the Lord Jesus (see  :-). Another reading—"serving the time," or "the
	occasion"—which differs in form but very slightly from the

	OLSHAUSEN, FRITZSCHE,
	MEYER]. But as manuscript
	authority is decidedly against it, so is internal evidence; and
	comparatively few favor it. Nor is the sense which it yields a very
	Christian one.
