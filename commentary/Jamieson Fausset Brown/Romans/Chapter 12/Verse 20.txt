20. if thine enemy hunger,
	c.—This is taken from Proverbs 25:21
Proverbs 25:22, which without doubt
	supplied the basis of those lofty precepts on that subject which form
	the culminating point of the Sermon on the Mount. 
	in so doing thou shalt heap
	coals of fire on his head—As the heaping of "coals of
	fire" is in the Old Testament the figurative expression of
	divine vengeance (Psalms 140:10;
	Psalms 11:6, &c.), the true
	sense of these words seems to be, "That will be the most
	effectual vengeance—a vengeance under which he will be fain to
	bend" (So ALFORD,
	HODGE, &c.). Psalms 11:6- : confirms this.
