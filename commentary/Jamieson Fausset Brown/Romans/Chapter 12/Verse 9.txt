9. Let love be without
	dissimulation—"Let your love be unfeigned" (as in
	2 Corinthians 6:6; 1 Peter 2:22;
	and see 1 John 3:18). 
	Abhor that which is evil;
	cleave to that which is good—What a lofty tone of moral
	principle and feeling is here inculcated! It is not, Abstain from the
	one, and do the other; nor, Turn away from the one, and draw to the
	other; but, Abhor the one, and cling, with deepest sympathy, to the
	other.
