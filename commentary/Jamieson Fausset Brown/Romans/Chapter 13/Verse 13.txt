	as in the day—"Men
	choose the night for their revels, but our night is past, for we are

	light of such a day." 
	not in rioting and
	drunkenness—varied forms of intemperance; denoting revels in
	general, usually ending in intoxication. 
	not in chambering and
	wantonness—varied forms of impurity; the one pointing to
	definite acts, the other more general. 
	not in strife and
	envying—varied forms of that venomous feeling between man and
	man which reverses the law of love.
