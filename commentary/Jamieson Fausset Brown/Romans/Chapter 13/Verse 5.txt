5. Wherefore ye must needs be
	subject, not only for wrath—for fear of the magistrate's
	vengeance. 
	but also for conscience'
	sake—from reverence for God's authority. It is of Magistracy
	in general, considered as a divine ordinance, that this is
	spoken: and the statement applies equally to all forms of government,
	from an unchecked despotism—such as flourished when this was
	written, under the Emperor Nero—to a pure democracy. The
	inalienable right of all subjects to endeavor to alter or improve the
	form of government under which they live is left untouched here. But
	since Christians were constantly charged with turning the world
	upside down, and since there certainly were elements enough in
	Christianity of moral and social revolution to give plausibility to
	the charge, and tempt noble spirits, crushed under misgovernment, to
	take redress into their own hands, it was of special importance that
	the pacific, submissive, loyal spirit of those Christians who resided
	at the great seat of political power, should furnish a visible
	refutation of this charge.
