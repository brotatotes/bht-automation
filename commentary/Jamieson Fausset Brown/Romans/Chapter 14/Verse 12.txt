12. So then—infers the
	apostle. 
	every one of us shall give
	account of himself to God—Now, if it be remembered that all
	this is adduced quite incidentally, to show that CHRIST
	is the absolute Master of all Christians, to rule their judgments and
	feelings towards each other while "living," and to dispose
	of them "dying," the testimony which it bears to the
	absolute Divinity of Christ will appear remarkable. On any other
	view, the quotation to show that we shall all stand before the
	judgment-seat of God would be a strange proof that Christians
	are all amenable to Christ.
