21. It is good not to eat flesh, nor
	to drink wine, nor any thing—"nor to do any thing" 
	whereby—"wherein"
	thy brother stumbleth, or is
	offended, or is made weak—rather, "is weak." These
	three words, it has been remarked, are each intentionally weaker than
	the other:—"Which may cause a brother to stumble, or even be
	obstructed in his Christian course, nay—though neither of these may
	follow—wherein he continues weak; unable wholly to disregard the
	example, and yet unprepared to follow it." But this injunction
	to abstain from flesh, from wine, and from whatsoever
	may hurt the conscience of a brother, must be properly understood.
	Manifestly, the apostle is treating of the regulation of the
	Christian's conduct with reference simply to the prejudices of the
	weak in faith; and his directions are to be considered not as
	prescriptions for one's entire lifetime, even to promote the
	good of men on a large scale, but simply as cautions against the too
	free use of Christian liberty in matters where other Christians,
	through weakness, are not persuaded that such liberty is divinely
	allowed. How far the principle involved in this may be
	legitimately extended, we do not inquire here; but ere we consider
	that question, it is of great importance to fix how far it is here
	actually expressed, and what is the precise nature of the
	illustrations given of it.
