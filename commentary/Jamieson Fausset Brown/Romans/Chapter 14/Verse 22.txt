22. Hast thou faith—on such
	matters? 
	have it to thyself—within
	thine own breast 
	before God—a most
	important clause. It is not mere sincerity, or a private
	opinion, of which the apostle speaks; it is conviction as to
	what is the truth and will of God. If thou hast formed this
	conviction in the sight of God, keep thyself in this frame before
	Him. Of course, this is not to be over-pressed, as if it were wrong
	to discuss such points at all with our weaker brethren. All that is
	here condemned is such a zeal for small points as endangers Christian
	love. 
	Happy is he that condemneth
	not himself in that which he alloweth—allows himself to do
	nothing, about the lawfulness of which he has scruples; does only
	what he neither knows nor fears to be sinful.
