4. Who art thou that judges another
	man's—rather, "another's" 
	servant?—that is,
	CHRIST'S, as the whole
	context shows, especially Romans 14:8;
	Romans 14:9. 
	Yea, c.—"But he
	shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand" that
	is, to make good his standing, not at the day of judgment, of which
	the apostle treats in Romans 14:10,
	but in the true fellowship of the Church here, in spite of thy
	censures.
