8. For whether we live, we live unto
	the Lord—the Lord CHRIST;
	see Romans 14:9. 
	and whether we die, we die
	unto the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, we are the
	Lord's—Nothing but the most vivid explanation of these
	remarkable words could make them endurable to any Christian ear, if
	Christ were a mere creature. For Christ is here—in the most
	emphatic terms, and yet in the most unimpassioned tone—held up as
	the supreme Object of the Christian's life, and of his death too; and
	that by the man whose horror of creature worship was such, that when
	the poor Lycaonians would have worshipped him, he rushed forth to
	arrest the deed, directing them to "the living God," as the
	only legitimate Object of worship (Romans 14:9- :). Nor does Paul teach this here, but rather appeals
	to it as a known and recognized fact, of which he had only to remind
	his readers. And since the apostle, when he wrote these words, had
	never been at Rome, he could only know that the Roman Christians
	would assent to this view of Christ, because it was the common
	teaching of all the accredited preachers of Christianity, and the
	common faith of all Christians.
