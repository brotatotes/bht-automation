12. And again, Esaias saith—
	(Isaiah 11:10). 
	There shall be a—"the"
	root of Jesse—meaning,
	not "He from whom Jesse sprang," but "He that is
	sprung from Jesse" (that is, Jesse's son David)—see Isaiah 11:10- :. 
	and he that shall rise,
	&c.—So the Septuagint in substantial, though not verbal,
	agreement with the original.
