13. Now, c.—This seems a
	concluding prayer, suggested by the whole preceding subject matter of
	the epistle. 
	the God of hope—(See on
	Romans 15:1). 
	fill you with all joy and
	peace in believing—the native truth of that faith which
	is the great theme of this epistle (compare Romans 15:1- :). 
	that ye may abound in
	hope—"of the glory of God." (See on Romans 15:1- :). 
	through the power of the Holy
	Ghost—to whom, in the economy of redemption, it belongs to
	inspire believers with all gracious affections. 
	On the foregoing portion, Note,
	(1) No Christian is at liberty to regard himself as an isolated
	disciple of the Lord Jesus, having to decide questions of duty and
	liberty solely with reference to himself. As Christians are one body
	in Christ, so the great law of love binds them to act in all things
	with tenderness and consideration for their brethren in "the
	common salvation" (Romans 15:1
Romans 15:2). (2) Of this
	unselfishness CHRIST is
	the perfect model of all Christians (Romans 15:2- :). (3) Holy Scripture is the divine storehouse of all
	furniture for the Christian life, even in its most trying and
	delicate features (Romans 15:4).
	(4) The harmonious glorification of the God and Father of our Lord
	Jesus Christ by the whole body of the redeemed, as it is the most
	exalted fruit of the scheme of redemption, so it is the last end of
	God in it (Romans 15:5-7). 
	Romans 15:5-45.15.7- :. CONCLUSION:
	IN WHICH
	THE APOSTLE
	APOLOGIZES FOR THUS
	WRITING TO THE ROMAN
	CHRISTIANS, EXPLAINS
	WHY HE
	HAD NOT
	YET VISITED
	THEM, ANNOUNCES
	HIS FUTURE
	PLANS, AND ASKS
	THEIR PRAYERS
	FOR THE COMPLETION OF
	THEM.
