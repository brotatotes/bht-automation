30. Now I beseech you, brethren, for
	the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit—or,
	"by the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit"—not
	the love which the Spirit bears to us, but that love which He kindles
	in the hearts of believers towards each other; that is "By that
	Saviour whose name is alike dear to all of us and whose unsearchable
	riches I live only to proclaim, and by that love one to another which
	the blessed Spirit diffuses through all the brotherhood, making the
	labors of Christ's servants a matter of common interest to all—I
	beseech you." 
	that ye strive together with
	me in your prayers to God for me—implying that he had his
	grounds for anxious fear in this matter.
