14, 15. Salute Asyncritus,
	&c.—These have been thought to be the names of ten less notable
	Christians than those already named. But this will hardly be supposed
	if it be observed that they are divided into two pairs of five each,
	and that after the first of these pairs it is added, "and the
	brethren which are with them," while after the second pair we
	have the words, "and all the saints which are with them."
	This perhaps hardly means that each of the five in both pairs had "a
	church at his house," else probably this would have been more
	expressly said. But at least it would seem to indicate that they were
	each a center of some few Christians who met at his house—it may be
	for further instruction, for prayer, for missionary purposes, or for
	some other Christian objects. These little peeps into the rudimental
	forms which Christian fellowship first took in the great cities,
	though too indistinct for more than conjecture, are singularly
	interesting. Our apostle would seem to have been kept minutely
	informed as to the state of the church at Rome, both as to its
	membership and its varied activities, probably by Priscilla and
	Aquila.
