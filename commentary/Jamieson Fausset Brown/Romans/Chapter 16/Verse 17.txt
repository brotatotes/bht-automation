17. Now I beseech you, brethren,
	mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine
	which ye have learned—"which ye learned." 
	and avoid them—The
	fomentors of "divisions" here referred to are probably
	those who were unfriendly to the truths taught in this epistle, while
	those who caused "offenses" were probably those referred to
	in Romans 14:15 as haughtily
	disregarding the prejudices of the weak. The direction as to both is,
	first, to "mark" such, lest the evil should be done ere it
	was fully discovered; and next, to "avoid" them (compare
	2 Thessalonians 3:6; 2 Thessalonians 3:14),
	so as neither to bear any responsibility for their procedure, nor
	seem to give them the least countenance.
