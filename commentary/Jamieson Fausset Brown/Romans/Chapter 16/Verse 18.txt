18. For they that are such serve not
	our Lord Jesus Christ—"our Lord Christ" appears to be
	the true reading. 
	but their own belly—not
	in the grosset sense, but as "living for low ends of their own"
	(compare Philippians 3:19). 
	and by good words and fair
	speeches deceive the simple—the unwary, the unsuspecting. (See
	Proverbs 14:15).
