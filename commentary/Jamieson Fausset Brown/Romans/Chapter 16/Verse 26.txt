26. But is now made manifest—The
	reference here is to that peculiar feature of the Gospel economy
	which Paul himself was specially employed to carry into practical
	effect and to unfold by his teaching—the introduction of the
	Gentile believers to an equality with their Jewish brethren, and the
	new, and, to the Jews, quite unexpected form which this gave to the
	whole Kingdom of God (compare  :-, c.). This the apostle calls here a mystery hitherto
	undisclosed, in what sense  :- will show, but now fully unfolded and his prayer for the
	Roman Christians, in the form of a doxology to Him who was able to do
	what he asked, is that they might be established in the truth of the
	Gospel, not only in its essential character, but specially in that
	feature of it which gave themselves, as Gentile believers, their
	whole standing among the people of God. 
	and by the scriptures of the
	prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made
	known to all nations for—in order to 
	the obedience of faith—Lest
	they should think, from what he had just said, that God had brought
	in upon his people so vast a change on their condition without giving
	them any previous notice, the apostle here adds that, on the
	contrary, "the Scriptures of the prophets" contain all that
	he and other preachers of the Gospel had to declare on these topics,
	and indeed that the same "everlasting God," who "from
	eternal ages" had kept these things hid, had given "commandment"
	that they should now, according to the tenor of those prophetic
	Scriptures, be imparted to every nation for their believing
	acceptance.
