7. Andronicus and Junia—or, as
	it might be, "Junias," a contracted form of "Junianus";
	in this case, it is a man's name. But if, as is more probable, the
	word be, as in our version, "Junia," the person meant was
	no doubt either the wife or the sister of Andronicus. 
	my kinsmen—or,
	"relatives." 
	and my fellow prisoners—on
	what occasion, it is impossible to say, as the apostle elsewhere
	tells us that he was "in prisons more frequent" ( :-). 
	which are of note among the
	apostles—Those who think the word "apostle" is used
	in a lax sense, in the Acts and Epistles, take this to mean "noted
	apostles" [CHRYSOSTOM,
	LUTHER, CALVIN,
	BENGEL, OLSHAUSEN,
	THOLUCK, ALFORD,
	JOWETT]; others, who are
	not clear that the word "apostle" is applied to any without
	the circle of the Twelve, save where the connection or some
	qualifying words show that the literal meaning of "one sent"
	is the thing intended, understand by the expression used here,
	"persons esteemed by the apostles" [BEZA,
	GROTIUS, DE
	WETTE, MEYER,
	FRITZSCHE, STUART,
	PHILIPPI, HODGE].
	And of course, if "Junia" is to be taken for a woman, this
	latter must be the meaning. 
	who also were in Christ
	before me—The apostle writes as if he envied them this priority
	in the faith. And, indeed, if to be "in Christ" be the most
	enviable human condition, the earlier the date of this blessed
	translation, the greater the grace of it. This latter statement about
	Andronicus and Junia seems to throw some light on the preceding one.
	Very possibly they may have been among the first-fruits of Peter's
	labors, gained to Christ either on the day of Pentecost or on some of
	the succeeding days. In that case they may have attracted the special
	esteem of those apostles who for some time resided chiefly at
	Jerusalem and its neighborhood; and our apostle, though he came late
	in contact with the other apostles, if he was aware of this fact,
	would have pleasure in alluding to it.
