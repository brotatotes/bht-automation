 CHAPTER 2 
	
 :-. THE JEW
	UNDER LIKE
	CONDEMNATION WITH THE
	GENTILE. 
	From those without, the
	apostle now turns to those within the pale of revealed
	religion, the self-righteous Jews, who looked down upon the
	uncovenanted heathen as beyond the pale of God's mercies, within
	which they deemed themselves secure, however inconsistent their life
	may be. Alas! what multitudes wrap themselves up in like fatal
	confidence, who occupy the corresponding position in the Christian
	Church!
