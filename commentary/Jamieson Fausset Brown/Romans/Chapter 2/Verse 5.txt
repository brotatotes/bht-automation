5. treasurest up unto thyself wrath
	against—rather "in." 
	the day of wrath—that
	is wrath to come on thee in the day of wrath. What an awful idea is
	here expressed—that the sinner himself is amassing, like hoarded
	treasure, an ever accumulating stock of divine wrath, to burst upon
	him in "the day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of
	God!" And this is said not of the reckless, but of those who
	boasted of their purity of faith and life.
