23. for all have sinned—Though
	men differ greatly in the nature and extent of their
	sinfulness, there is absolutely no difference between the best and
	the worst of men, in the fact that "all have sinned,"
	and so underlie the wrath of God. 
	and come short of the
	glory—or "praise" 
	of God—that is, "have
	failed to earn His approbation" (compare  :-, Greek). So the best interpreters.
