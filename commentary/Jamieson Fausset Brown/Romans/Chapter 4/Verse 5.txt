	despairing of acceptance with God by "working" for it the
	work of obedience, does not attempt it. 
	but believeth on him that
	justifieth the ungodly—casts himself upon the mercy of Him that
	justifieth those who deserve only condemnation. 
	his faith, &c.—(See
	on  :-). 
	Second: David sings of the same
	justification.
