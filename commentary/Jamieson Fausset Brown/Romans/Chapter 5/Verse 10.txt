10. For if, when we were enemies, we
	were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being
	now—"having now been" 
	reconciled, we shall be saved
	by his life—that is "If that part of the Saviour's work
	which cost Him His blood, and which had to be wrought for persons
	incapable of the least sympathy either with His love or His labors in
	their behalf—even our 'justification,' our 'reconciliation'—is
	already completed; how much more will He do all that remains to be
	done, since He has it to do, not by death agonies any more, but in
	untroubled 'life,' and no longer for enemies, but for friends—from
	whom, at every stage of it, He receives the grateful response of
	redeemed and adoring souls?" To be "saved from wrath
	through Him," denotes here the whole work of Christ towards
	believers, from the moment of justification, when the wrath of
	God is turned away from them, till the Judge on the great white
	throne shall discharge that wrath upon them that "obey not the
	Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ"; and that work may all be
	summed up in "keeping them from falling, and presenting them
	faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy"
	(Judges 1:24): thus are they "saved
	from wrath through Him."
