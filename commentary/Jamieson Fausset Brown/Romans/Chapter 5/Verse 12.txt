12. Wherefore—that is, Things
	being so; referring back to the whole preceding argument. 
	as by one man—Adam. 
	sin—considered here in
	its guilt, criminality, penal desert. 
	entered into the world, and
	death by sin—as the penalty of sin. 
	and so death passed upon all
	men, for that all have sinned—rather, "all sinned,"
	that is, in that one man's first sin. Thus death reaches every
	individual of the human family, as the penalty due to himself.
	(So, in substance, BENGEL,
	HODGE, PHILIPPI).
	Here we should have expected the apostle to finish his sentence, in
	some such way as this: "Even so, by one man righteousness has
	entered into the world, and life by righteousness." But, instead
	of this, we have a digression, extending to five verses, to
	illustrate the important statement of  :-; and it is only at Romans 5:18
	that the comparison is resumed and finished.
