15. But—"Yet,"
	"Howbeit." 
	not as the
	offence—"trespass." 
	so also is the free gift—or
	"the gracious gift," "the gift of grace." The two
	cases present points of contrast as well as resemblance. 
	For if, c.—rather, "For
	if through the offense of the one the many died (that is, in that one
	man's first sin), much more did the grace of God, and the free gift
	by grace, even that of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the
	many." By "the many" is meant the mass of
	mankind represented respectively by Adam and Christ, as opposed, not
	to few, but to "the one" who represented them. By
	"the free gift" is meant (as in  :-) the glorious gift of justifying righteousness this
	is expressly distinguished from "the grace of God," as the
	effect from the cause; and both are said to "abound"
	towards us in Christ—in what sense will appear in Romans 5:16;
	Romans 5:17. And the "much
	more," of the one case than the other, does not mean that we get
	much more of good by Christ than of evil by Adam (for it is not a
	case of quantity at all); but that we have much more reason to
	expect, or it is much more agreeable to our ideas of God, that the
	many should be benefited by the merit of one, than that they should
	suffer for the sin of one; and if the latter has happened, much
	more may we assure ourselves of the former [PHILIPPI,
	HODGE].
