16. And not as it was by one that
	sinned, so is the gift—"Another point of contrast may be
	mentioned." 
	for the judgment—"sentence."
	was by one—rather, "was
	of one," meaning not "one man," but, as appears from
	the next clause, "one offense." 
	to condemnation, but the free
	gift—"gift of grace." 
	is of many offences unto
	justification—a glorious point of contrast. "The
	condemnation by Adam was for one sin; but the justification by
	Christ is an absolution not only from the guilt of that first
	offense, mysteriously attaching to every individual of the race, but
	from the countless offenses it, to which, as a germ lodged in
	the bosom of every child of Adam, it unfolds itself in his life."
	This is the meaning of "grace abounding towards us in the
	abundance of the gift of righteousness." It is a grace
	not only rich in its character, but rich in detail; it
	is a "righteousness" not only rich in a complete
	justification of the guilty, condemned sinner; but rich in the
	amplitude of the ground which it covers, leaving no one sin of
	any of the justified uncancelled, but making him, though loaded with
	the guilt of myriads of offenses, "the righteousness of God in
	Christ."
