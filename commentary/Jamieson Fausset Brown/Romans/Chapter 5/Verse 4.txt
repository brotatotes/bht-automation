4. patience worketh
	experience—rather, "proof," as the same word is
	rendered in 2 Corinthians 2:9; 2 Corinthians 13:3;
	Philippians 2:22; that is, experimental
	evidence that we have "believed through grace." 
	and experience—"proof."
	hope—"of the glory
	of God," as prepared for us. Thus have we hope in two distinct
	ways, and at two successive stages of the Christian life: first,
	immediately on believing, along with the sense of peace and abiding
	access to God (Romans 5:1); next,
	after the reality of this faith has been "proved,"
	particularly by the patient endurance of trials sent to test it. We
	first get it by looking away from ourselves to the Lamb of
	God; next by looking into or upon ourselves as
	transformed by that "looking unto Jesus." In the one case,
	the mind acts (as they say) objectively; in the other,
	subjectively. The one is (as divines say) the assurance of
	faith; the other, the assurance of sense.
