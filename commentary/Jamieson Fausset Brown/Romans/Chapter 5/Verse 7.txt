	will one—"any one"
	die: yet peradventure for a
	good man—a man who, besides being unexceptionable, is
	distinguished for goodness, a benefactor to society. 
	some—"some one."
	would—rather, "doth."
	even dare to die—"Scarce
	an instance occurs of self-sacrifice for one merely upright; though

	found an example of such noble surrender of life" (So BENGEL,
	OLSHAUSEN, THOLUCK,
	ALFORD, PHILIPPI).
	(To make the "righteous" and the "good" man here
	to mean the same person, and the whole sense to be that "though
	rare, the case may occur, of one making a sacrifice of life for a
	worthy character" [as CALVIN,
	BEZA, FRITZSCHE,
	JOWETT], is extremely
	flat.)
