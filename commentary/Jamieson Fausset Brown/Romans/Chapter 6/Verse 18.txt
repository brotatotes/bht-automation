18. Being then—"And
	being"; it is the continuation and conclusion of the preceding
	sentence; not a new one. 
	made free from Sin, ye became
	the servants of—"servants to" 
	Righteousness—The case
	is one of emancipation from entire servitude to one Master to entire
	servitude to another, whose property we are (see on  :-). There is no middle state of personal independence; for
	which we were never made, and to which we have no claim. When we
	would not that God should reign over us, we were in righteous
	judgment "sold under Sin"; now being through grace "made
	free from Sin," it is only to become "servants to
	Righteousness," which is our true freedom.
