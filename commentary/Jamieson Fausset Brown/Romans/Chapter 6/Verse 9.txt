9-11. Christ being raised from the
	dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over himâ€”Though
	Christ's death was in the most absolute sense a voluntary act
	(John 10:17; John 10:18;
	Acts 2:24), that voluntary
	surrender gave death such rightful "dominion over Him"
	as dissolved its dominion over us. But this once past, "death
	hath," even in that sense, "dominion over Him no more."
