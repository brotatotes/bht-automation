10, 11. And—thus. 
	the commandment, which was,
	&c.—designed 
	to—give 
	life—through the
	keeping of it. 
	I found to be unto
	death—through breaking it. 
	For sin—my sinful
	nature. 
	taking occasion by the
	commandment, deceived me—or "seduced me"—drew me
	aside into the very thing which the commandment forbade. 
	and by it slew me—"discovered
	me to myself to be a condemned and gone man" (compare  :-, "I died").
