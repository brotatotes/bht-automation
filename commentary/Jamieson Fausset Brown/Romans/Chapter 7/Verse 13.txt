13. Was then that which is good
	made—"Hath then that which is good become" 
	death unto me? God
	forbid—that is, "Does the blame of my death lie
	with the good law? Away with such a thought." 
	But sin—became death
	unto me, to the end. 
	that it might appear sin—that
	it might be seen in its true light. 
	working death in—rather,
	"to" 
	me by that which is good,
	that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful—"that
	its enormous turpitude might stand out to view, through its turning
	God's holy, just, and good law into a provocative to the very things
	which is forbids." So much for the law in relation to the
	unregenerate, of whom the apostle takes himself as the example;
	first, in his ignorant, self-satisfied condition; next, under
	humbling discoveries of his inability to keep the law, through inward
	contrariety to it; finally, as self-condemned, and already, in law, a
	dead man. Some inquire to what period of his recorded history these
	circumstances relate. But there is no reason to think they were
	wrought into such conscious and explicit discovery at any period of
	his history before he "met the Lord in the way"; and
	though, "amidst the multitude of his thoughts within him"
	during his memorable three day's blindness immediately after that,
	such views of the law and of himself would doubtless be tossed up and
	down till they took shape much as they are here described (see
	on  :-) we regard this whole
	description of his inward struggles and progress rather as the
	finished result of all his past recollections and subsequent
	reflections on his unregenerate state, which he throws into
	historical form only for greater vividness. But now the apostle
	proceeds to repel false inferences regarding the law,
	secondly: Romans 7:14-25,
	in the case of the REGENERATE;
	taking himself here also as the example.
