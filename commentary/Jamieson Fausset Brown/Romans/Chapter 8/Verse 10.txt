10, 11. And if Christ be in you—by
	His indwelling Spirit in virtue of which we have one life with
	him. 
	the body—"the body
	indeed." 
	is dead
	because of—"by reason of" 
	sin; but the spirit is
	life because—or, "by reason" 
	of righteousness—The
	word "indeed," which the original requires, is of the
	nature of a concession—"I grant you that the body is dead . .
	. and so far redemption is incomplete, but," c. that is,
	"If Christ be in you by His indwelling Spirit, though your
	'bodies' have to pass through the stage of 'death' in consequence of
	the first Adam's 'sin,' your spirit is instinct with new and undying
	'life,' brought in by the 'righteousness' of the second Adam"
