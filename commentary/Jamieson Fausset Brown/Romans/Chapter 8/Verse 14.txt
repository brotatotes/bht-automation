14. For as many as are led by the
	Spirit of God, they are the sons of God, they, &c.—"these
	are sons of God." Hitherto the apostle has spoken of the Spirit
	simply as a power through which believers mortify sin: now he
	speaks of Him as a gracious, loving Guide, whose
	"leading"—enjoyed by all in whom is the Spirit of God's
	dear Son—shows that they also are "sons of God."
