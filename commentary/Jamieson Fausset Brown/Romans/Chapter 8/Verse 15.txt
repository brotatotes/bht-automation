	law which "worketh wrath," that is, "Such was your

	word "cry" is emphatic, expressing the spontaneousness, the
	strength, and the exuberance of the final emotions. In  :- this cry is said to proceed from the Spirit in us,
	drawing forth the filial exclamation in our hearts. Here, it is said
	to proceed from our own hearts under the vitalizing energy of
	the Spirit, as the very element of the new life in believers (compare
	Matthew 10:19 Matthew 10:20;

	is the Syro-Chaldaic word for "Father"; and the
	Greek word for that is added, not surely to tell the reader
	that both mean the same thing, but for the same reason which drew
	both words from the lips of Christ Himself during his agony in the
	garden (Mark 14:36). He,
	doubtless, loved to utter His Father's name in both the accustomed
	forms; beginning with His cherished mother tongue, and adding that of
	the learned. In this view the use of both words here has a charming
	simplicity and warmth.
