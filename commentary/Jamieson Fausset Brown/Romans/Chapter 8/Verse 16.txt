16. The Spirit itself—It
	should be "Himself" (see on  :-). 
	beareth witness with our
	spirit, that we are the children—"are children" 
	of God—The testimony of
	our own spirit is borne in that cry of conscious sonship,
	"Abba, Father"; but we are not therein alone; for the Holy
	Ghost within us, yea, even in that very cry which it is His to draw
	forth, sets His own distinct seal to ours; and thus, "in the
	mouth of two witnesses" the thing is established. The apostle
	had before called us "sons of God," referring to our
	adoption; here the word changes to "children,"
	referring to our new birth. The one expresses the dignity
	to which we are admitted; the other the new life which
	we receive. The latter is more suitable here; because a son by
	adoption might not be heir of the property, whereas a son by
	birth certainly is, and this is what the apostle is now coming
	to.
