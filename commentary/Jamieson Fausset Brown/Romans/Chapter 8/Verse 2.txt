2. For the law of the Spirit of life
	in Christ Jesus hath made me free—rather, "freed
	me"—referring to the time of his conversion, when first he
	believed. 
	from the law of sin and
	death—It is the Holy Ghost who is here called "the Spirit
	of life," as opening up in the souls of believers a
	fountain of spiritual life (see on  :-); just as He is called "the Spirit of truth,"
	as "guiding them into all truth" ( :-), and "the Spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
	knowledge and the fear of the Lord" ( :-), as the inspirer of these qualities. And He is called "the
	Spirit of life in Christ Jesus," because it is as members
	of Christ that He takes up His abode in believers, who in consequence
	of this have one life with their Head. And as the word "law"
	here has the same meaning as in  :-, namely, "an inward principle of action, operating with
	the fixedness and regularity of a law," it thus appears that
	"the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" here
	means, "that new principle of action which the Spirit of Christ
	has opened up within us—the law of our new being." This "sets
	us free," as soon as it takes possession of our inner man,
	"from the law of sin and death" that is, from the enslaving
	power of that corrupt principle which carries death in its bosom. The
	"strong man armed" is overpowered by the "stronger
	than he"; the weaker principle is dethroned and expelled by the
	more powerful; the principle of spiritual life prevails against and
	brings into captivity the principle of spiritual death—"leading
	captivity captive." If this be the apostle's meaning, the whole
	verse is to this effect: That the triumph of believers over their
	inward corruption, through the power of Christ's Spirit in them,
	proves them to be in Christ Jesus, and as such absolved from
	condemnation. But this is now explained more fully.
