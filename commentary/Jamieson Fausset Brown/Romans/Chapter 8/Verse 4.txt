4. That the righteousness of the
	law—"the righteous demand," "the requirement"
	[ALFORD], Or "the
	precept" of the law; for it is not precisely the word so often
	used in this Epistle to denote "the righteousness which
	justifies" (Romans 1:17;
	Romans 3:21; Romans 4:5;
	Romans 4:6; Romans 5:17;
	Romans 5:18; Romans 5:21),
	but another form of the same word, intended to express the enactment
	of the law, meaning here, we believe, the practical obedience which
	the law calls for. 
	might be fulfilled in us—or,
	as we say, "realized in us." 
	who walk—the most
	ancient expression of the bent of one's life, whether in the
	direction of good or of evil (Genesis 48:15;
	Psalms 1:1; Isaiah 2:5;
	Micah 4:5; Ephesians 4:17;
	1 John 1:6; 1 John 1:7).
	not after—that is,
	according to the dictates of 
	the flesh, but after the
	spirit—From Romans 8:9 it
	would seem that what is more immediately intended by "the
	spirit" here is our own mind as renewed and actuated by
	the Holy Ghost.
