9. But ye are not in the flesh, but
	in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you—This
	does not mean, "if the disposition or mind of God
	dwell in you"; but "if the Holy Ghost dwell in you"
	(see 1 Corinthians 6:11; 1 Corinthians 6:19;
	1 Corinthians 3:16, c.). (It thus appears
	that to be "in the spirit" means here to be under the
	dominion of our own renewed mind because the indwelling of
	God's Spirit is given as the evidence that we are "in the
	spirit"). 
	Now—"But." 
	if any man have not the
	Spirit of Christ—Again, this does not mean "the
	disposition or mind of Christ," but the Holy
	Ghost; here called "the Spirit of Christ," just as He is
	called "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" (see on 1 Corinthians 3:16- :). It is as "the Spirit of Christ" that the Holy
	Ghost takes possession of believers, introducing into them all the
	gracious, dove-like disposition which dwelt in Him (Matthew 3:16;
	John 3:34). Now if any man's heart
	be void, not of such dispositions, but of the blessed Author of them,
	"the Spirit of Christ." 
	he is none of his—even
	though intellectually convinced of the truth of Christianity, and in
	a general sense influence by its spirit. Sharp, solemn statement
	this!
