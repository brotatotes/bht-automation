24. even us, whom he hath called,
	c.—rather, "Whom he hath also called, even us," &c.,
	in not only "afore preparing," but in due time
	effectually "calling us." 
	not of the Jews,
	&c.—better, "not from among Jews only, but also from among
	Gentiles." Here for the first title in this chapter the
	calling of the Gentiles is introduced all before having respect,
	not to the substitution of the called Gentiles for the rejected Jews,
	but to the choice of one portion and the rejection of another of the
	same Israel. Had Israel's rejection been total, God's promise to
	Abraham would not have been fulfilled by the substitution of
	the Gentiles in their room; but Israel's rejection being only
	partial, the preservation of a "remnant," in which the
	promise was made good, was but "according to the election of
	grace." And now, for the first time, the apostle tells us that
	along with this elect remnant of Israel, it is God's purpose
	to "take out of the Gentiles a people for His name"
	(Acts 28:14); and that subject,
	thus introduced, is now continued to the end of the eleventh chapter.
