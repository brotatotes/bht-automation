25. As he saith also in
	Osee—"Hosea." 
	I will call them my people,
	which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not
	beloved—quoted, though not quite to the letter, from  :-, a passage relating immediately, not to the heathen, but to
	the kingdom of the ten tribes; but since they had sunk to the level
	of the heathen, who were "not God's people," and in that
	sense "not beloved," the apostle legitimately applies it to
	the heathen, as "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and
	strangers to the covenants of promise" (so  :-).
