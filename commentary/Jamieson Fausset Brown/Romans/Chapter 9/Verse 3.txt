3. For I could wish that myself were
	accursed from Christ for—"in behalf of" 
	my brethren, my kinsmen
	according to the flesh—In proportion as he felt himself severed
	from his nation, he seems to have realized all the more vividly their
	natural relationship. To explain away the wish here expressed, as too
	strong for any Christian to utter or conceive, some have rendered the
	opening words, "I did wish," referring it to his
	former unenlightened state; a sense of the words too tame to be
	endured: others unwarrantably soften the sense of the word
	"accursed." But our version gives the true import of the
	original; and if it be understood as the language rather of "strong
	and indistinct emotions than of definite ideas" [HODGE],
	expressing passionately how he felt his whole being swallowed up in
	the salvation of his people, the difficulty will vanish, and we shall
	be reminded of the similar idea so nobly expressed by Moses ( :-).
