1. servant of God—not found
	elsewhere in the same connection. In  :- it is "servant of Jesus Christ" (Galatians 1:10;
	Philippians 1:1; compare Acts 16:17;
	Revelation 1:1; Revelation 15:3).
	In Romans 1:1, there follows,
	"called to be an apostle," which corresponds to the
	general designation of the office first, "servant of
	GOD," here, followed
	by the special description, "apostle of Jesus Christ."
	The full expression of his apostolic office answers, in both
	Epistles, to the design, and is a comprehensive index to the
	contents. The peculiar form here would never have proceeded
	from a forger. 
	according to the
	faith—rather, "for," "with a view to subserve
	the faith"; this is the object of my apostleship (compare
	Titus 1:4; Titus 1:9;
	Romans 1:5). 
	the elect—for whose
	sake we ought to endure all things (Romans 1:5- :). This election has its ground, not in anything belonging to
	those thus distinguished, but in the purpose and will of God from
	everlasting (2 Timothy 1:9; Romans 8:30-33;
	compare Luke 18:7; Ephesians 1:4;
	Colossians 3:12). Colossians 3:12- : shows that all faith on the part of the elect, rests on the
	divine foreordination: they do not become elect by their
	faith, but receive faith, and so become believers, because
	they are elect.
and the acknowledging of the
	truth—"and (for promoting) the full knowledge of
	the truth," that is, the Christian truth (Colossians 3:12- :). 
	after godliness—that
	is, which belongs to piety: opposed to the knowledge which has
	not for its object the truth, but error, doctrinal and practical
	(Titus 1:11; Titus 1:16;
	1 Timothy 6:3); or even which has for
	its object mere earthly truth, not growth in the divine life.
	"Godliness," or "piety," is a term peculiar to
	the Pastoral Epistles: a fact explained by the apostle having in them
	to combat doctrine tending to "ungodliness" (1 Timothy 6:3- :; compare Titus 2:11;
	Titus 2:12).
