2. In hope of eternal life—connected
	with the whole preceding sentence. That whereon rests my aim as an
	apostle to promote the elect's faith and full knowledge of the
	truth, is, "the hope of eternal life" (Titus 2:13;
	Titus 3:7; Acts 23:6;
	Acts 24:15). 
	that cannot lie—
	(Romans 3:4; Romans 11:29;
	Hebrews 6:18). 
	promised before the world
	began—a contracted expression for "purposed before
	the world began (literally, 'before the ages of time'), and promised
	actually in time," the promise springing from the eternal
	purpose; as in 2 Timothy 1:9, the gift
	of grace was the result of the eternal purpose "before the world
	began."
