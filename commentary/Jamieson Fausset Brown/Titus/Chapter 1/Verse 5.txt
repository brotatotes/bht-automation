5. I left thee—"I left
	thee behind" [ALFORD]
	when I left the island: not implying permanence of
	commission (compare 1 Timothy 1:3). 
	in Crete—now Candia. 
	set in order—rather as
	Greek, "that thou mightest follow up (the work
	begun by me), setting right the things that are wanting," which
	I was unable to complete by reason of the shortness of my stay in
	Crete. Christianity, doubtless, had long existed in Crete: there were
	some Cretans among those who heard Peter's preaching on Pentecost (1 Timothy 1:3- :). The number of Jews in Crete was large (1 Timothy 1:3- :), and it is likely that those scattered in the persecution
	of Stephen (Acts 11:19) preached
	to them, as they did to the Jews of Cyprus, c. Paul also was there on
	his voyage to Rome (Acts 11:19- :). By all these instrumentalities the Gospel was sure to
	reach Crete. But until Paul's later visit, after his first
	imprisonment at Rome, the Cretan Christians were without Church
	organization. This Paul began, and had commissioned (before leaving
	Crete) Titus to go on with, and now reminds him of that commission. 
	ordain—rather,
	"appoint," "constitute." 
	in every city—"from
	city to city." 
	as I . . . appointed
	thee—that is, as I directed thee prescribing as well the act
	of constituting elders, as also the manner of doing so, which
	latter includes the qualifications required in a presbyter presently
	stated. Those called "elders" here are called "bishops"
	in Titus 1:7. Elder is the
	term of dignity in relation to the college of presbyters;
	bishop points to the duties of his office in relation
	to the flock. From the unsound state of the Cretan Christians
	described here, we see the danger of the want of Church government.
	The appointment of presbyters was designed to check idle talk
	and speculation, by setting forth the "faithful word."
