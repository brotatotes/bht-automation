7. For . . . must—The emphasis
	is on "must." The reason why I said "blameless,"
	is the very idea of a "bishop" (an overseer of the flock;
	he here substitutes for "presbyter" the term which
	expresses his duties) involves the necessity for such
	blamelessness, if he is to have influence over the flock. 
	steward of God—The
	greater the master is, the greater the virtues required in His
	servant [BENGEL], ( :-); the Church is God's house, over which the minister is set
	as a steward (Hebrews 3:2-6;
	1 Peter 4:10; 1 Peter 4:17).
	Note: ministers are not merely Church officers, but God's
	stewards; Church government is of divine appointment. 
	not self-willed—literally,
	"self-pleasing"; unaccommodating to others; harsh,
	the opposite of "a lover of hospitality" (1 Peter 4:17- :); so Nabal (1 Peter 4:17- :); self-loving and imperious; such a spirit would
	incapacitate him for leading a willing flock, instead of
	driving.
not given to wine—(See
	on 1 Peter 4:17- :; 1 Peter 4:17- :). 
	not given to filthy lucre—not
	making the Gospel a means of gain (1 Timothy 3:3;
	1 Timothy 3:8). In opposition to those
	"teaching for filthy lucre's sake" (Titus 1:11;
	1 Timothy 6:5; 1 Peter 5:2).
