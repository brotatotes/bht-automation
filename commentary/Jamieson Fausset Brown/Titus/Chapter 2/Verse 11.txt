11. the grace of God—God's
	gratuitous favor in the scheme of redemption. 
	hath appeared—Greek,
	"hath been made to appear," or "shine
	forth" (Isaiah 9:2; Luke 1:79).
	"hath been manifested" (Luke 1:79- :), after having been long hidden in the loving counsels of God
	(Colossians 1:26; 2 Timothy 1:9;
	2 Timothy 1:10). The image is
	illustrated in Acts 27:20. The
	grace of God hath now been embodied in Jesus, the brightness
	of the Father's glory," manifested as the "Sun of
	righteousness," "the Word made flesh." The Gospel
	dispensation is hence termed "the day" (1 Thessalonians 5:5;
	1 Thessalonians 5:8; there is a double
	"appearing," that of "grace" here, that of
	"glory," Titus 2:13;
	compare Romans 13:12). Connect it
	not as English Version, but, "The grace . . . that
	bringeth salvation to all men hath appeared," or "been
	manifested" (1 Timothy 2:4;
	1 Timothy 4:10). Hence God is called
	"our Saviour" (1 Timothy 4:10- :). The very name Jesus means the same. 
	to all—of whom he
	enumerated the different classes (1 Timothy 4:10- :): even to servants; to us Gentiles, once aliens from God.
	Hence arises our obligation to all men (1 Timothy 4:10- :).
