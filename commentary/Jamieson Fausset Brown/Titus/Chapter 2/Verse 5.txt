5. keepers at home—as
	"guardians of the house," as the Greek expresses.
	The oldest manuscripts read, "Workers at home":
	active in household duties (Proverbs 7:11;
	1 Timothy 5:13). 
	good—kind, beneficent
	(Matthew 20:15; Romans 5:7;
	1 Peter 2:18). Not churlish and
	niggardly, but thrifty as housewives. 
	obedient—rather
	"submissive," as the Greek is translated; (see on
	1 Peter 2:18- :; 1 Peter 2:18- :). 
	their own—marking the
	duty of subjection which they owe them, as being their own
	husbands (Ephesians 5:22; Colossians 3:18).
	blasphemed—"evil
	spoken of." That no reproach may be cast on the Gospel, through
	the inconsistencies of its professors (Titus 2:8;
	Titus 2:10; Romans 2:24;
	1 Timothy 5:14; 1 Timothy 6:1).
	"Unless we are virtuous, blasphemy will come through us to the
	faith" [THEOPHYLACT].
