7. In—with respect to
	all things. 
	thyself a pattern—though
	but a young man thyself. All teaching is useless unless the teacher's
	example confirm his word. 
	in doctrine—in
	thy ministerial teaching (showing) uncorruptness, that
	is, untainted purity of motive on thy part (compare  :-), so as to be "a pattern" to all. As "gravity,"
	c., refers to Titus himself, so "uncorruptness" though,
	doubtless, uncorruptness of the doctrine will be sure to
	follow as a consequence of the Christian minister being of simple,
	uncorrupt integrity himself. 
	gravity—dignified
	seriousness in setting forth the truth. 
	sincerity—omitted in
	the oldest manuscripts.
