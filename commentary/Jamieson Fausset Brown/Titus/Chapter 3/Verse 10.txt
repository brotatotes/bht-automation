10. heretic—Greek
	"heresy," originally meant a division resulting from
	individual self-will; the individual doing and teaching what he
	chose, independent of the teaching and practice of the Church.
	In course of time it came to mean definitely "heresy" in
	the modern sense; and in the later Epistles it has almost assumed
	this meaning. The heretics of Crete, when Titus was there, were in
	doctrine followers of their own self-willed "questions"
	reprobated in Titus 3:9, and
	immoral in practice. 
	reject—decline, avoid;
	not formal excommunication, but, "have nothing more to do with
	him," either in admonition or intercourse.
