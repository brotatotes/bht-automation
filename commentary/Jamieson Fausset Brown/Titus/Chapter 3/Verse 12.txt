12. When I shall send—have
	sent. 
	Artemas or Tychicus—to
	supply thy place in Crete. Artemas is said to have been subsequently
	bishop of Lystra. Tychicus was sent twice by Paul from Rome to Lesser
	Asia in his first imprisonment (which shows how well qualified he was
	to become Titus' successor in Crete);  :-; and in his second,  :-. Tradition makes him subsequently bishop of Chalcedon, in
	Bithynia. 
	Nicopolis—"the
	city of victory," called so from the battle of Actium, in
	Epirus. This Epistle was probably written from Corinth in the autumn.
	Paul purposed a journey through Ætolia and Acarnania, into Epirus,
	and there "to winter." See my  :-
	to the Pastoral Epistles.
