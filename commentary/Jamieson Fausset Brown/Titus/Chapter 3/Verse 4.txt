4. To show how little reason the
	Cretan Christians had to be proud of themselves, and despise others
	not Christians (see on Titus 3:2).
	It is to the "kindness and love of God," not to their own
	merits, that they owe salvation. 
	kindness—Greek,
	"goodness," "benignity," which manifests His
	grace.
love . . . toward
	man—teaching us to have such "love (benevolence) toward
	man" (Greek, "philanthropy"), "showing
	all meekness unto all men" (Titus 3:2- :), even as God had "toward man" (Titus 3:2- :); opposed to the "hateful and hating"
	characteristics of unrenewed men, whose wretchedness moved God's
	benevolent kindness.
of God our Saviour—Greek,
	"of our Saviour God," namely, the Father (Titus 3:2- :), who "saved us" (Titus 3:2- :) "through Jesus Christ our Saviour" (Titus 3:2- :). 
	appeared—Greek,
	"was made to appear"; was manifested.
