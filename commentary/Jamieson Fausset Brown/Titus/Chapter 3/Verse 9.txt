9. avoid—stand aloof from.
	Same Greek, as in 2 Timothy 2:16;
	see on 2 Timothy 2:16- :. 
	foolish—Greek,
	"insipid"; producing no moral fruit. "Vain talkers."
	genealogies—akin to the
	"fables" (see on 2 Timothy 2:16- :).
	Not so much direct heresy as yet is here referred to, as profitless
	discussions about genealogies of aeons, c., which ultimately led to
	Gnosticism. Synagogue discourses were termed daraschoth, that
	is, "discussions." Compare "disputer of this
	world (Greek, 'dispensation')." 
	strivings about the law—about
	the authority of the "commandments of men," which they
	sought to confirm by the law (2 Timothy 2:16- : see on 2 Timothy 2:16- :), and about
	the mystical meaning of the various parts of the law in connection
	with the "genealogies."
