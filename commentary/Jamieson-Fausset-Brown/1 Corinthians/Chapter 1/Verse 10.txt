<p><b>10. Now</b>—Ye already have
	<i>knowledge, utterance,</i> and <i>hope,</i> maintain also <i>love.</i>
</p>
<p><b>brethren</b>—The very title
	is an argument for <i>love.</i>

<p><b>by . . . Christ</b>—whom
	Paul wishes to be all in all to the Corinthians, and therefore names
	Him so often in this chapter. 
	</p>
<p><b>speak . . . same thing</b>—not
	speaking different things as ye do (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), in a spirit of variance. 
	</p>
<p><b>divisions</b>—literally,
	"splits," "breaches." 
	</p>
<p><b>but</b>—"but rather."
	</p>
<p><b>perfectly joined together</b>—the
	opposite word to "divisions." It is applied to <i>healing a
	wound,</i> or <i>making whole a rent.</i>
</p>
<p><b>mind . . . judgment</b>—the
	view taken by the <i>understanding,</i> and the <i>practical decision</i>
	arrived at [CONYBEARE and
	HOWSON], as to what is to
	be done. The <i>mind,</i> within, refers to things to be believed:
	the <i>judgment</i> is displayed outwardly in things to be done
	[BENGEL].
	<i>Disposition—opinion</i> [ALFORD].</p>
