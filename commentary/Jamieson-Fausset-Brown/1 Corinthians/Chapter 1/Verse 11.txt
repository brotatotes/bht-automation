	and of the Corinthians. The Corinthians "wrote" to the
	apostle (1 Corinthians 7:1), consulting
	him concerning certain points; marriage, the eating of things offered
	to idols, the decorum to be observed by women in religious
	assemblies. But they said not a syllable about the enormities and
	disorders that had crept in among them. That information
	reached Paul by other quarters. Hence his language about those evils
	is, "It hath been declared unto me," c. "It is
	reported commonly" (1 Corinthians 5:1;
	1 Corinthians 5:2). All this he says before
	he refers to their letter, which shows that the latter did not
	give him any intimation of those evils. An undesigned proof of
	genuineness [PALEY, Horæ
	Paulinæ]. Observe his prudence: He names the family, to let it
	be seen that he made his allegation not without authority: he does
	not name the individuals, not to excite odium against them. He
	tacitly implies that the information ought rather to have come to him
	directly from their presbyters, as they had consulted him about
	matters of less moment.

	severe a word as "divisions," literally, "schisms"
