<p><b>by them . . . of . . . house
	of Chloe</b>—They seem to have been alike in the confidence of Paul
	and of the Corinthians. The Corinthians "wrote" to the
	apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>), consulting
	him concerning certain points; marriage, the eating of things offered
	to idols, the decorum to be observed by women in religious
	assemblies. But they said not a syllable about the enormities and
	disorders that had crept in among them. <i>That</i> information
	reached Paul by other quarters. Hence his language about those evils
	is, "It hath been declared unto me," c. "It is
	reported commonly" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:2">1 Corinthians 5:2</span>). All this he says <i>before</i>
	he refers to their <i>letter,</i> which shows that the latter did not
	give him any intimation of those evils. An undesigned proof of
	genuineness [PALEY, <i>Horæ
	Paulinæ</i>]. Observe his prudence: He names the family, to let it
	be seen that he made his allegation not without authority: he does
	not name the individuals, not to excite odium against them. He
	tacitly implies that the information ought rather to have come to him
	directly from their presbyters, as they had consulted him about
	matters of less moment.
