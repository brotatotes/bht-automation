<p><b>12. this I say</b>—this is what <i>I
	mean</i> in saying "contentions" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>every one of you saith</b>—Ye
	say severally, "glorying in men" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21">1 Corinthians 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span>),
	one, I am of Paul; another, I am of Apollos, c. Not that they formed
	<i>definite</i> parties, but they individually betrayed the <i>spirit</i>
	of party in contentions under the name of different favorite
	teachers. Paul will not allow himself to be flattered even by those
	who made his name their party cry, so as to connive at the dishonor
	thereby done to Christ. These probably were converted under his
	ministry. Those alleging the name of Apollos, Paul's successor at
	Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:24">Acts 18:24</span>, &amp;c.),
	were persons attracted by his rhetorical style (probably acquired in
	Alexandria, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span>), as
	contrasted with the "weak bodily presence" and
	"contemptible speech" of the apostle. Apollos, doubtless,
	did not willingly foster this spirit of undue preference (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:8">1 Corinthians 4:8</span>); nay, to discourage it,
	he would not repeat his visit just then (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:8- :">1 Corinthians 4:8- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>I of Cephas</b>—probably
	Judaizers, who sheltered themselves under the name of Peter, the
	apostle of the circumcision ("Cephas" is the <i>Hebrew,</i>
	"Peter" the <i>Greek</i> name; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11">Galatians 2:11</span>, c.): the subjects
	handled in the seventh through ninth chapters were probably suggested
	as matters of doubt by them. The church there began from the Jewish
	synagogue, Crispus the chief ruler, and Sosthenes his successor
	(probably), being converts. Hence some Jewish leaven, though not so
	much as elsewhere, is traceable (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11- :">Galatians 2:11- :</span>). <i>Petrism</i> afterwards sprang up much more rankly at
	Rome. If it be wrong to boast "I am of Peter," how much
	more so to boast I am of the Pope!" [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>I of Christ</b>—A fair
	pretext used to slight the ministry of Paul and their other teachers
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:8">1 Corinthians 4:8</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:7-11">2 Corinthians 10:7-11</span>).</p>
