13. Is Christ divided?—into
	various parts (one under one leader, another under another) [ALFORD].
	The unity of His body is not to be cut in pieces, as if all did not
	belong to Him, the One Head. 
	was Paul crucified for
	you?—In the Greek the interrogation implies that a
	strong negative answer is expected: "Was it Paul (surely you
	will not say so) that was crucified for you?" In the former
	question the majesty of "CHRIST"
	(the Anointed One of God) implies the impossibility of His being
	"divided." in the latter, Paul's insignificance
	implies the impossibility of his being the head of redemption,
	"crucified for" them, and giving his name to the redeemed.
	This, which is true of Paul the founder of the Church of
	Corinth, holds equally good of Cephas and Apollos, who had not such a
	claim as Paul in the Corinthian Church. 
	crucified . . . baptized—The
	cross claims us for Christ, as redeemed by Him; baptism, as dedicated
	to Him. 
	in the name—rather,
	"into the name" ( :-), implying the incorporation involved in the idea of
	baptism.
