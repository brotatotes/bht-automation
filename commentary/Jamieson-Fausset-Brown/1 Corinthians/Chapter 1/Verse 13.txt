<p><b>13. Is Christ divided?</b>—into
	various parts (one under one leader, another under another) [ALFORD].
	The unity of His body is not to be cut in pieces, as if all did not
	belong to Him, the One Head. 
	</p>
<p><b>was Paul crucified for
	you?</b>—In the <i>Greek</i> the interrogation implies that a
	strong negative answer is expected: "Was it Paul (<i>surely you
	will not say so</i>) that was crucified for you?" In the former
	question the majesty of "CHRIST"
	(the Anointed One of God) implies the impossibility of His being
	"divided." in the latter, <i>Paul's</i> insignificance
	implies the impossibility of his being the head of redemption,
	"crucified for" them, and giving his name to the redeemed.
	This, which is true of Paul the <i>founder</i> of the Church of
	Corinth, holds equally good of Cephas and Apollos, who had not such a
	claim as Paul in the Corinthian Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>crucified . . . baptized</b>—The
	cross claims us for Christ, as redeemed by Him; baptism, as dedicated
	to Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the name</b>—rather,
	"<i>into</i> the name" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), implying the <i>incorporation</i> involved in the idea of
	baptism.</p>
