<p><b>14.</b> I thank God's providence
	now, who so ordered it that I baptized none of you but Crispus (the
	former ruler of the synagogue, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) and Gaius (written by the Romans <i>Caius,</i> the host of
	Paul at Corinth, and of the church, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; a person therefore in good circumstances). Baptizing was
	the office of the deacons (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) rather than of the apostles, whose office was that of
	establishing and superintending generally the churches. The deacons
	had a better opportunity of giving the necessary <i>course of
	instruction preparatory to baptism.</i> Crispus and Gaius were
	probably among the first converts, and hence were baptized by Paul
	himself, who founded the church.</p>
