14. I thank God's providence
	now, who so ordered it that I baptized none of you but Crispus (the
	former ruler of the synagogue,  :-) and Gaius (written by the Romans Caius, the host of
	Paul at Corinth, and of the church,  :-; a person therefore in good circumstances). Baptizing was
	the office of the deacons ( :-) rather than of the apostles, whose office was that of
	establishing and superintending generally the churches. The deacons
	had a better opportunity of giving the necessary course of
	instruction preparatory to baptism. Crispus and Gaius were
	probably among the first converts, and hence were baptized by Paul
	himself, who founded the church.
