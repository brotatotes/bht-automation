<p><b>17.</b> Paul says this not to
	depreciate baptism; for he exalts it most highly (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). He baptized some first converts; and would have baptized
	more, but that his and the apostles' peculiar work was to preach the
	Gospel, to found by their autoptic testimony particular churches, and
	then to superintend the churches in general.

<p><b>not to baptize</b>—even in
	Christ's name, much less in my own.

<p><b>not with wisdom of words</b>—or
	<i>speech; philosophical reasoning</i> set off with <i>oratorical
