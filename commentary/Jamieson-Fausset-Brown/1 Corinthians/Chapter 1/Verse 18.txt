<p><b>18. preaching,</b> c.—literally,
	"the word," or speech as to the cross in contrast to the
	"wisdom of <i>words</i>" (so called), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>them that perish</b>—rather,
	"them that are perishing," namely, by preferring human
	"wisdom of words" to the doctrine of the "cross of
	Christ." It is not the final state that is referred to; but,
	"them that are in the way of perishing." So also in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:15">2 Corinthians 2:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:16">2 Corinthians 2:16</span>.

<p><b>us which are saved</b>—In
	the <i>Greek</i> the collocation is more modest, "to them that
	are being saved (that are in the way of salvation) as," that is,
	to which class <i>we</i> belong. 
	</p>
<p><b>power of God</b>—which
	includes in it that it is the wisdom of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:16- :">2 Corinthians 2:16- :</span>). God's powerful instrument of salvation; the highest
	exhibition of God's power (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:16- :">2 Corinthians 2:16- :</span>). What seems to the world "weakness" in God's plan
	of salvation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:25">1 Corinthians 1:25</span>), and in
	its mode of delivery by His apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:25- :">1 Corinthians 1:25- :</span>) is really His mighty "power." What seems
	"foolishness" because wanting man's "wisdom of words"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17">1 Corinthians 1:17</span>), is really the
	highest "wisdom of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:17- :">1 Corinthians 1:17- :</span>).</p>
