	that man can by the light of nature discover his duty to God, is
	disproved by the fact that man <i>has</i> never discovered it without
	revelation. All the stars and moon cannot make it day; that is the
	prerogative of the sun. Nor can nature's highest gifts make the moral
	day arise; that is the office of Christ. Even the Jew missed this

	wisdom.
