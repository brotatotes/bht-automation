<p><b>22. For</b>—literally, "Since,"
	seeing that. This verse illustrates how the "preaching" of
	Christ crucified came to be deemed "foolishness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>a sign</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read "signs." The <i>singular</i> was a later
	correction from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:38">Matthew 12:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:1">Matthew 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:18">John 2:18</span>.
	The signs the Jews craved for were not mere miracles, but direct
	tokens from heaven that Jesus was Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:18- :">John 2:18- :</span>).

<p><b>Greeks seek . . .
	wisdom</b>—namely, a philosophic demonstration of Christianity.
	Whereas Christ, instead of <i>demonstrative</i> proof, demands <i>faith</i>
	on the ground of <i>His word,</i> and of a reasonable amount of
	evidence that the alleged revelation is His word. Christianity begins
	not with solving intellectual difficulties, but with satisfying the
	heart that longs for forgiveness. Hence not the refined Greeks, but
	the theocratic Jews were the chosen organ for propagating revelation.
	Again, intellectual Athens (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:18- :">John 2:18- :</span>, &amp;c.) received the Gospel less readily than
	commercial Corinth.</p>
