	<i>Greek</i> expresses not the mere fact of His crucifixion, but the
	<i>permanent character</i> acquired by the transaction, whereby He is

	was the stone on which the Jews stumbled (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:1- :">Galatians 3:1- :</span>). The opposition of Jew and Gentile alike shows that a
	religion so seemingly contemptible in its origin could not have
	succeeded if it had not been divine.
