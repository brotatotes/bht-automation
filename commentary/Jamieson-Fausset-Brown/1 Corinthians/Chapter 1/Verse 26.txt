<p><b>26. ye see</b>—rather, from the
	prominence of the verb in the <i>Greek,</i> "see" or
	"consider" (imperative) [ALFORD
	from <i>Vulgate</i> and IRENÆUS].
	</p>
<p><b>your calling . . . </b><i><b>are
	called</b></i><b> </b>—Instead of the words in italics, supplied by
	<i>English Version,</i> supply, "were your callers." What
	Paul is dwelling on (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:27">1 Corinthians 1:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:28">1 Corinthians 1:28</span>) is the weakness of the
	instrumentality which the Lord employed to convert the world [HINDS
	and WHATELY; so ANSELM].
	However, <i>English Version</i> accords well with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:28- :">1 Corinthians 1:28- :</span>. "The whole history of the expansion of the Church is a
	progressive victory of the ignorant over the learned, the lowly over
	the lofty, until the emperor himself laid down his crown before the
	cross of Christ" [OLSHAUSEN].
	</p>
<p><b>wise . . . after the
	flesh</b>—the wisdom of this world acquired by human study without
	the Spirit. (Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>).</p>
