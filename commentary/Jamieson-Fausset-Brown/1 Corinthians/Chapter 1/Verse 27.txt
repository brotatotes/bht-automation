<p><b>27. the foolish things</b>—a
	general phrase for <i>all persons and things foolish.</i> Even <i>things</i>
	(and those, too, <i>foolish things</i>) are chosen by God to confound
	<i>persons,</i> (and those too persons who are <i>wise</i>). This
	seems to me the force of the change from neuter to masculine. 
	</p>
<p><b>to confound</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	is stronger, "<i>that</i> He might confound (or put to shame)."
	God confounds the wise by effecting through His instruments, without
	human wisdom, that the worldly wise, with it, cannot effect, namely,
	to bring men to salvation. 
	</p>
<p><b>chosen . . . chosen</b>—The
	repetition indicates the gracious deliberateness of God's purpose
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:5">James 2:5</span>).</p>
