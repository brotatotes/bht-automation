<p><b>28. </b><i><b>yea,</b></i><b> and
	things which are not</b>â€”<i>Yea</i> is not in the <i>Greek.</i>
	Also some of the oldest manuscripts omit "and." Thus the
	clause, "things which are not" (are regarded as naught), is
	in apposition with "foolish . . . weak . . . base (that is,
	lowborn) and despised things." God has chosen all four, though
	regarded as <i>things that are not,</i> to bring to naught things
	that are.</p>
