28. yea, and
	things which are notâ€”Yea is not in the Greek.
	Also some of the oldest manuscripts omit "and." Thus the
	clause, "things which are not" (are regarded as naught), is
	in apposition with "foolish . . . weak . . . base (that is,
	lowborn) and despised things." God has chosen all four, though
	regarded as things that are not, to bring to naught things
	that are.
