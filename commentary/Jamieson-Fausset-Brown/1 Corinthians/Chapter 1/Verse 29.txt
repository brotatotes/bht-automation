<p><b>29. no flesh . . . glory</b>—For
	they who try to glory (boast) because of human greatness and wisdom,
	are "confounded" or <i>put to shame</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Flesh, like "the flower of the field," is
	beautiful, but frail (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:6">Isaiah 40:6</span>).

<p><b>in his presence</b>—We are
	to glory not <i>before</i> Him, but in Him [BENGEL].</p>
