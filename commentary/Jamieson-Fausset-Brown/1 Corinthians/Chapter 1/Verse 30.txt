<p><b>of him are</b>—not of
	yourselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>), but of Him
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>). <i>From</i> Him ye
	are (that is, have spiritual life, who once were spiritually among
	the "things which are not." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36- :">Romans 11:36- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in Christ</b>—by living
	union with Him. Not "in the flesh" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:26">1 Corinthians 1:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:29">1 Corinthians 1:29</span>).

	</p>
<p><b>wisdom</b>—unattainable by
	the worldly mode of seeking it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:19">1 Corinthians 1:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>; contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:3">Colossians 2:3</span>;

	By it we become "wise unto salvation," owing to His <i>wisdom</i>
	in originating and executing the plan, whereas once we were "fools."

<p><b>righteousness</b>—the
	ground of our justification (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:5">Jeremiah 23:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:6">Jeremiah 23:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>); whereas once we were
	"weak" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:6">Romans 5:6</span>).
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:21">Isaiah 42:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:24">Isaiah 45:24</span>.

<p><b>sanctification</b>—by His
	Spirit; whereas formerly we were "base." Hereafter our
	righteousness and sanctification alike shall be both perfect and
	inherent. Now the righteousness wherewith we are justified is
	perfect, but not inherent; that wherewith we are sanctified is
	inherent, but not perfect [HOOKER].
	Now sanctification is perfect in principle, but not in attainment.
	These two are joined in the <i>Greek</i> as forming essentially but
	<i>one</i> thing, as distinguished from the "wisdom" in
	<i>devising</i> and executing the plan for us ("abounded toward
	us in all wisdom," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:8">Ephesians 1:8</span>),
	and "redemption," the <i>final completion</i> of the scheme
	in the deliverance of the body (the position of "redemption"
	last shows that this limited sense is the one intended here). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28">Luke 21:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>;

<p><b>redemption</b>—whereas once
