30. But . . . ye—in contrast
	to them that "glory" in worldly wisdom and greatness. 
	of him are—not of
	yourselves (Ephesians 2:8), but of Him
	(Romans 11:36). From Him ye
	are (that is, have spiritual life, who once were spiritually among
	the "things which are not." Romans 11:36- :). 
	in Christ—by living
	union with Him. Not "in the flesh" (1 Corinthians 1:26;
	1 Corinthians 1:29). 
	of God—from God;
	emanating from Him and sent by Him. 
	is made unto us—has
	been made to us, to our eternal gain. 
	wisdom—unattainable by
	the worldly mode of seeking it (1 Corinthians 1:19;
	1 Corinthians 1:20; contrast Colossians 2:3;
	Proverbs 8:1-36; Isaiah 9:6).
	By it we become "wise unto salvation," owing to His wisdom
	in originating and executing the plan, whereas once we were "fools."
	righteousness—the
	ground of our justification (Jeremiah 23:5;
	Jeremiah 23:6; Romans 4:25;
	2 Corinthians 5:21); whereas once we were
	"weak" (Romans 5:6).
	Isaiah 42:21; Isaiah 45:24.
	sanctification—by His
	Spirit; whereas formerly we were "base." Hereafter our
	righteousness and sanctification alike shall be both perfect and
	inherent. Now the righteousness wherewith we are justified is
	perfect, but not inherent; that wherewith we are sanctified is
	inherent, but not perfect [HOOKER].
	Now sanctification is perfect in principle, but not in attainment.
	These two are joined in the Greek as forming essentially but
	one thing, as distinguished from the "wisdom" in
	devising and executing the plan for us ("abounded toward
	us in all wisdom," Ephesians 1:8),
	and "redemption," the final completion of the scheme
	in the deliverance of the body (the position of "redemption"
	last shows that this limited sense is the one intended here). Luke 21:28;
	Romans 8:23; Ephesians 1:14;
	Ephesians 4:30. 
	redemption—whereas once
	we were "despised."
