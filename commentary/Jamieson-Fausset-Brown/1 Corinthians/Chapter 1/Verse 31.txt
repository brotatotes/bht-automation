<p><b>31. glory in . . . Lord</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:23">Jeremiah 9:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:24">Jeremiah 9:24</span>)
	—in opposition to "flesh glorying in His presence" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:24- :">Jeremiah 9:24- :</span>). In contrast to morbid slavish self-abasement, Paul joins
	with humility the elevating consciousness of our true dignity in
	Christ. He who glories is to glory in the Lord, not in the flesh, nor
	in the world.</p>
