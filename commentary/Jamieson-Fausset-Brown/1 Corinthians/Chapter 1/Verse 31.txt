31. glory in . . . Lord—
	(Jeremiah 9:23; Jeremiah 9:24)
	—in opposition to "flesh glorying in His presence" (Jeremiah 9:24- :). In contrast to morbid slavish self-abasement, Paul joins
	with humility the elevating consciousness of our true dignity in
	Christ. He who glories is to glory in the Lord, not in the flesh, nor
	in the world.
