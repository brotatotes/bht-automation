<p><b>5. utterance</b>â€”ALFORD
	from MENOCHIUS translates,
	"doctrine." Ye are rich in <i>preachers</i> or the
	<i>preaching</i> of the word, and rich in <i>knowledge</i> or
	<i>apprehension</i> of it: literally "(the) <i>word</i>
	(preached)." <i>English Version</i> (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) is better: for Paul, purposing presently to dwell on the
	<i>abuse</i> of the two gifts on which the Corinthians most prided
	themselves, <i>utterance</i> (speech) and <i>knowledge</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:18">1 Corinthians 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:19">1 Corinthians 4:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1-14">1 Corinthians 13:1-14</span>), previously
	gains their goodwill by congratulating them on <i>having</i> those
	gifts.</p>
