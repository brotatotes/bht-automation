5. utteranceâ€”ALFORD
	from MENOCHIUS translates,
	"doctrine." Ye are rich in preachers or the
	preaching of the word, and rich in knowledge or
	apprehension of it: literally "(the) word
	(preached)." English Version (as in  :-) is better: for Paul, purposing presently to dwell on the
	abuse of the two gifts on which the Corinthians most prided
	themselves, utterance (speech) and knowledge (1 Corinthians 1:20;
	1 Corinthians 3:18; 1 Corinthians 4:19;
	1 Corinthians 13:1-14), previously
	gains their goodwill by congratulating them on having those
	gifts.
