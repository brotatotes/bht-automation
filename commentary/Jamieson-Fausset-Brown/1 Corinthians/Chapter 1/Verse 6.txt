6. According as the testimony of
	(of, and concerning) Christ (who is both the object and author of
	this testimony [BENGEL];
	1 Corinthians 2:1; 1 Timothy 2:6;
	2 Timothy 1:8) was confirmed among
	[ALFORD] you; that is, by
	God, through my preaching and through the miracles accompanying it
	(1 Corinthians 12:3; Mark 16:20;
	2 Corinthians 1:21; 2 Corinthians 1:22;
	Galatians 3:2; Galatians 3:5;
	Ephesians 4:7; Ephesians 4:8;
	Hebrews 2:4). God confirmed
	(compare Philippians 1:7; Hebrews 2:3),
	or gave effect to the Gospel among (or better as English Version,
	"in") the Corinthians by their accepting it and
	setting their seal to its truth, through the inward power of His
	Spirit, and the outward gifts and miracles accompanying it [CALVIN].
