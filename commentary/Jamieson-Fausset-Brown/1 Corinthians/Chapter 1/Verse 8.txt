8. Who—God,  :- (not Jesus Christ, 1 Corinthians 1:7,
	in which case it would be "in His day"). 
	unto the end—namely,
	"the coming of Christ." 
	blameless in the day of . . .
	Christ— (1 Thessalonians 5:23). After
	that day there is no danger (Ephesians 4:30;
	Philippians 1:6). Now is our day to work,
	and the day of our enemies to try us: then will be the day of Christ,
	and of His glory in the saints [BENGEL].
