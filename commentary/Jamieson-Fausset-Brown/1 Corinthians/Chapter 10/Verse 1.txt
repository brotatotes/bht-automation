<p><b>1. Moreover</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read "for." Thus the connection with the
	foregoing chapter is expressed. Ye need to exercise self-denying
	watchfulness notwithstanding all your privileges, lest ye be
	castaways. For the Israelites with all their privileges were most of
	them castaways through want of it.

<p><b>ignorant</b>—with all your
	boasted "knowledge."

<p><b>our fathers</b>—The Jewish
	Church stands in the relation of parent to the Christian Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>all</b>—Arrange as the
	<i>Greek,</i> "Our fathers were <i>all</i> under the <i>cloud</i>";
	giving the "all" its proper emphasis. Not so much as one of
	so great a multitude was detained by force or disease (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) [BENGEL]. Five
	times the "all" is repeated, in the enumeration of the five
	favors which God bestowed on Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Five times, correspondingly, they sinned (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). In contrast to the "all" stands "many
	(rather, 'the most') of them" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>All</i> of them had great privileges, yet <i>most</i>
	of them were castaways through lust. Beware you, having greater
	privileges, of sharing the same doom through a similar sin.
	Continuing the reasoning (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "They which run in a race, run <i>all,</i> but <i>one</i>
	receiveth the prize."

<p><b>under the cloud</b>—were

	symbol of the divine presence (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:21">Exodus 13:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:22">Exodus 13:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:39">Psalms 105:39</span>;
