<p><b>the ends of the

	dispensation in its successive phases (<i>plural,</i> "ends")
	being the winding up of all former "ages." No new
	dispensation shall appear till Christ comes as Avenger and Judge;
	till then the "ends," being many, include various
	successive periods (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). As we live in the last dispensation, which is the
	consummation of all that went before, our responsibilities are the
	greater; and the greater is the guilt, Paul implies, to the
	Corinthians, which they incur if they fall short of their privileges.</p>
