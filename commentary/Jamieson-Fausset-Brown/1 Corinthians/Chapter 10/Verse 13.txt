<p><b>13.</b> Consolation to them, under
	their temptation; it is none but such as is "common to man,"
	or "such as man can bear," "adapted to man's powers of
	endurance" [WAHL].

<p><b>faithful</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+125:3">Psalms 125:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+27:3">Isaiah 27:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+27:8">Isaiah 27:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10">Revelation 3:10</span>). "God is faithful"
	to the covenant which He made with you in calling you (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10- :">Revelation 3:10- :</span>). To be <i>led into</i> temptation is distinct from <i>running</i>
	into it, which would be "tempting God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:9">1 Corinthians 10:9</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:9">2 Peter 2:9</span>). The <i>Greek</i> is,
	"<i>the</i> way of escape"; the appropriate way of escape
	in each particular temptation; not an immediate escape, but one in
	due time, after patience has had her perfect work (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2-4">James 1:2-4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>). He "makes"
	the way of escape simultaneously with the temptation which His
	providence permissively arranges for His people.

<p><b>to bear it</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"to bear up under it," or "against it." Not, He
	will take it away (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12- :">James 1:12- :</span>).</p>
