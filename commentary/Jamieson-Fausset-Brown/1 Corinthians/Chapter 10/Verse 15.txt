<p><b>15.</b> Appeal to their own powers
	of <i>judgment</i> to weigh the force of the argument that follows:
	namely, that as the partaking of the Lord's Supper involves a
	partaking of the Lord Himself, and the partaking of the Jewish
	sacrificial meats involved a partaking of the altar of God, and, as
	the heathens sacrifice to devils, to partake of an idol feast is to
	have fellowship with devils. We cannot divest ourselves of the
	responsibility of "judging" for ourselves. The weakness of
	private judgment is not an argument against its use, but its abuse.
	We should the more take pains in searching the infallible word, with
	every aid within our reach, and above all with humble prayer for the
	Spirit's teaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:11">Acts 17:11</span>).
	If Paul, an inspired apostle, not only permits, but urges, men to
	<i>judge</i> his sayings by Scripture, much more should the fallible
	ministers of the present visible Church do so. 
	</p>
<p><b>To wise men</b>â€”refers with
	a mixture of irony to the Corinthian boast of "wisdom"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:10">1 Corinthians 4:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:19">2 Corinthians 11:19</span>).
	Here you have an opportunity of exercising your "wisdom" in
	judging "what I say."</p>
