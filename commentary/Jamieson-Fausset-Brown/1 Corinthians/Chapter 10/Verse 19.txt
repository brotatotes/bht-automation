19, 20. What say I then?â€”The
	inference might be drawn from the analogies of the Lord's Supper and
	Jewish sacrifices, that an idol is really what the heathen thought
	it to be, a god, and that in eating idol-meats they had
	fellowship with the god. This verse guards against such an inference:
	"What would I say then? that a thing sacrificed to an idol is
	any real thing (in the sense that the heathen regard it), or that an
	idol is any real thing?" (The oldest manuscripts read the words
	in this order. Supply "Nay") "But [I say] that
	the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils
	(demons)." Paul here introduces a new fact. It is true that, as
	I said, an idol has no reality in the sense that the heathen regard
	it, but it has a reality in another sense; heathendom being under
	Satan's dominion as "prince of this world," he and
	his demons are in fact the powers worshipped by the heathen,
	whether they are or are not conscious of it (Deuteronomy 32:17;
	Leviticus 17:7; 2 Chronicles 11:15;
	Psalms 106:37; Revelation 9:20).
	"Devil" is in the Greek restricted to Satan;
	"demons" is the term applied to his subordinate evil
	spirits. Fear, rather than love, is the motive of heathen worship
	(compare the English word "panic," from PAN,
	whose human form with horns and cloven hoofs gave rise to the vulgar
	representations of Satan which prevail now); just as fear is the
	spirit of Satan and his demons (Revelation 9:20- :).
