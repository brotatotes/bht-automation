2. And—"And so"
	[BENGEL]. 
	baptized unto Moses—the
	servant of God and representative of the Old Testament covenant of
	the law: as Jesus, the Son of God, is of the Gospel covenant (John 1:17;
	Hebrews 3:5; Hebrews 3:6).
	The people were led to believe in Moses as God's servant by the
	miracle of the cloud protecting them, and by their being conducted
	under him safely through the Red Sea; therefore they are said to be
	"baptized unto" him (Hebrews 3:6- :). "Baptized" is here equivalent to "initiated":
	it is used in accommodation to Paul's argument to the Corinthians;
	they, it is true, have been "baptized," but so also
	virtually were the Israelites of old; if the virtual baptism of the
	latter availed not to save them from the doom of lust, neither will
	the actual baptism of the former save them. There is a resemblance
	between the symbols also: for the cloud and sea consist of water, and
	as these took the Israelites out of sight, and then restored them
	again to view, so the water does to the baptized [BENGEL].
	OLSHAUSEN understands "the
	cloud" and "the sea" as symbolizing the Spirit
	and water respectively (John 3:5;
	Acts 10:44-47). Christ is
	the pillar cloud that screens us from the heat of God's wrath. Christ
	as "the light of the world" is our "pillar of fire"
	to guide us in the darkness of the world. As the rock when smitten
	sent forth the waters, so Christ, having been once for all smitten,
	sends forth the waters of the Spirit. As the manna bruised in mills
	fed Israel, so Christ, when "it pleased the Lord to bruise Him,"
	has become our spiritual food. A strong proof of inspiration is given
	in this fact, that the historical parts of Scripture, without
	the consciousness even of the authors, are covert prophecies of the
	future.
