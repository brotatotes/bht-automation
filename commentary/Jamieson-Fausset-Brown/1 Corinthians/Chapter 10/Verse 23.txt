23. All things are lawful for me,
	&c.—Recurring to the Corinthian plea ( :-), he repeats his qualification of it. The oldest manuscripts

	edify not—tend not to
	build up the spiritual temple, the Church, in faith and love.
	Paul does not appeal to the apostolic decision ( :-), which seems to have been not so much regarded outside
	of Palestine, but rather to the broad principle of true Christian
	freedom, which does not allow us to be governed by external things,

	(1 Corinthians 6:12). Their use or
	non-use is to be regulated by regard to edification.
