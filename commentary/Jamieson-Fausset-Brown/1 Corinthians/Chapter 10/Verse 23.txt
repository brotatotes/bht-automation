<p><b>23. All things are lawful for me,</b>
	&amp;c.—Recurring to the Corinthian plea (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), he repeats his qualification of it. The oldest manuscripts
	omit both times "for me."

<p><b>edify not</b>—tend not to
	<i>build up</i> the spiritual temple, the Church, in faith and love.
	Paul does not appeal to the apostolic decision (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), which seems to have been not so much regarded outside
	of Palestine, but rather to the broad principle of true Christian
	freedom, which does not allow us to be governed by external things,
	as though, because we <i>can</i> use them, we <i>must</i> use them
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:12">1 Corinthians 6:12</span>). Their use or
	non-use is to be regulated by regard to <i>edification.</i></p>
