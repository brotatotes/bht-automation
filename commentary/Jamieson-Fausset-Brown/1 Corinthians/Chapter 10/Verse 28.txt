<p><b>28. if any man</b>—a weak
	Christian at table, wishing to warn his brother. 
	</p>
<p><b>offered in sacrifice unto
	idols</b>—The oldest manuscripts omit "unto idols." At a
	heathen's table the expression, offensive to him, would naturally be
	avoided. 
	</p>
<p><b>for conscience' sake</b>—not
	to cause a stumbling-block to the conscience of thy weak brother (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>for the earth is the Lord's,</b>
	&amp;c.—not in the oldest manuscripts.</p>
