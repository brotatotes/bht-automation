<p><b>29. Conscience . . . of the
	other</b>—the weak brother introduced in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>for why is my liberty judged
	off another man's conscience?</b>—Paul passes to the first person,
	to teach his converts by putting himself as it were in their
	position. The <i>Greek</i> terms for "the other" and
	"another" are distinct. "<i>The other</i>" is <i>the
	one with whom Paul's and his Corinthian converts' concern is;</i>
	"<i>another</i>" is <i>any other with whom he and they have
	no concern.</i> If a guest know the meat to be idol meat while I know
	it not, I have "liberty" to eat without being condemned by
	his "conscience" [GROTIUS].
	Thus the "for," c., is an argument for <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Eat, asking no questions." Or, Why should I
	give occasion by the rash use of my liberty that another should
	condemn it [ESTIUS], or
	that my liberty should cause the destruction of my weak brother?"
	[MENOCHIUS]. Or, the words
	are those of the Corinthian objector (perhaps used in their letter,
	and so quoted by Paul), "Why is my liberty judged by another's
	conscience?" Why should not I be judged only by my own, and have
	liberty to do whatever it sanctions? Paul replies in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, Your doing so ought always to be limited by regard to what
	most tends "to the glory of God" [VATABLUS,
	CONYBEARE and HOWSON].
	The first explanation is simplest the "for," c., in it
	refers to "not thine own" (that is, "not <i>my</i>
	own," in Paul's change to the first person) I am to abstain only
	in the case of liability to offend <i>another's</i> conscience; in
	cases where <i>my own</i> has no scruple, I am not bound, in God's
	judgment, by any other conscience than my own.</p>
