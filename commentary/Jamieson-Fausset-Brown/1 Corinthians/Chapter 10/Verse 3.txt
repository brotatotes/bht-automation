<p><b>3. same spiritual meat</b>â€”As the
	Israelites had the water from the rock, which answered to <i>baptism,</i>
	so they had the manna which corresponded to the other of the two
	Christian sacraments, the Lord's Supper. Paul plainly implies the
	<i>importance</i> which was attached to these two sacraments by all
	Christians in those days: "an inspired protest against those who
	lower their dignity, or deny their necessity" [ALFORD].
	Still he guards against the other extreme of thinking the mere
	external possession of such privileges will ensure salvation.
	Moreover, had there been seven sacraments, as Rome teaches, Paul
	would have alluded to them, whereas he refers to only the two. He
	does not mean by "the same" that <i>the Israelites and we
	Christians</i> have the "same" sacrament; but that
	<i>believing and unbelieving</i> Israelites alike had "the same"
	spiritual privilege of the manna (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). It was "<i>spiritual</i> meat" or food; because
	given by the power of God's spirit, not by human labor [GROTIUS
	and ALFORD] <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "born after the Spirit," that is, supernaturally.
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:24">Psalms 78:24</span>, "corn of
	heaven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:40">Psalms 105:40</span>).
	Rather, "spiritual" in its <i>typical</i> signification,
	Christ, the true Bread of heaven, being signified (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+105:40- :">Psalms 105:40- :</span>). Not that the Israelites clearly understood the
	signification; but believers among them would feel that in the type
	something more was meant; and their implicit and reverent, though
	indistinct, faith was counted to them for justification, of which the
	manna was a kind of sacramental seal. "They are not to be heard
	which feign that the old fathers did look only for transitory
	promises" [Article VII, Church of England], as appears from this
	passage (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span>).</p>
