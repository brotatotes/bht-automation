	things indifferent (1 Corinthians 8:13;
	Romans 14:13; 2 Corinthians 6:3);
	for in all essential things affecting Christian doctrine and
	practice, even in the smallest detail, we must not swerve from
	principle, whatever offense may be the result (2 Corinthians 6:3- :). Giving offense is unnecessary, if our own spirit cause it;
	necessary, if it be caused by the truth.
