<p><b>32. Give none offence</b>â€”in
	things indifferent (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:13">Romans 14:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:3">2 Corinthians 6:3</span>);
	for in all essential things affecting Christian doctrine and
	practice, even in the smallest <i>detail,</i> we must not swerve from
	principle, whatever offense may be the result (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:3- :">2 Corinthians 6:3- :</span>). Giving offense is unnecessary, if our own spirit cause it;
	necessary, if it be caused by the truth.</p>
