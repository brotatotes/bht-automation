	beasts" also are mentioned as having drunk. The literal water

	called. 
	spiritual Rock that followed
	them—rather, "accompanied them." Not the
	literal rock (or its water) "followed" them, as ALFORD
	explains, as if Paul sanctioned the Jews' tradition (Rabbi Solomon on
	Numbers 20:2) that the rock itself,
	or at least the stream from it, followed the Israelites from place to
	place (compare Deuteronomy 9:21). But
	Christ, the "Spiritual Rock" (Psalms 78:20;
	Psalms 78:35; Deuteronomy 32:4;
	Deuteronomy 32:15; Deuteronomy 32:18;
	Deuteronomy 32:30; Deuteronomy 32:31;
	Deuteronomy 32:37; Isaiah 28:16;
	1 Peter 2:6), accompanied them (1 Peter 2:6- :). "Followed" implies His attending on them
	to minister to them; thus, though mostly going before
	them, He, when occasion required it, followed "behind"
	(Exodus 14:19). He satisfied all
	alike as to their bodily thirst whenever they needed it; as on three
	occasions is expressly recorded (Exodus 15:24;
	Exodus 15:25; Exodus 17:6;
	Numbers 20:8); and this drink for the
	body symbolized the spiritual drink from the Spiritual Rock (compare
	John 4:13; John 4:14;
	see on 1 Corinthians 10:1).
