<p><b>4. drink</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:8">Numbers 20:8</span>, "the
	beasts" also are mentioned as having drunk. The literal water
	typified "<i>spiritual</i> drink," and is therefore so
	called.

<p><b>spiritual Rock that followed
	them</b>—rather, "<i>accompanied</i> them." Not the
	literal rock (or its water) "followed" them, as ALFORD
	explains, as if Paul sanctioned the Jews' tradition (Rabbi Solomon on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:2">Numbers 20:2</span>) that the rock itself,
	or at least the stream from it, followed the Israelites from place to
	place (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+9:21">Deuteronomy 9:21</span>). But
	Christ, the "Spiritual Rock" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:20">Psalms 78:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:35">Psalms 78:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:4">Deuteronomy 32:4</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6">1 Peter 2:6</span>), accompanied them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6- :">1 Peter 2:6- :</span>). "Followed" implies His <i>attending on</i> them
	to <i>minister to</i> them; thus, though mostly going <i>before</i>
	them, He, when occasion required it, <i>followed</i> "<i>behind</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:19">Exodus 14:19</span>). He satisfied all
	alike as to their bodily thirst whenever they needed it; as on three
	occasions is expressly recorded (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:24">Exodus 15:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:25">Exodus 15:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:6">Exodus 17:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:8">Numbers 20:8</span>); and this drink for the
	body symbolized the spiritual drink from the Spiritual Rock (compare
