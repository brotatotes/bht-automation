<p><b>7. idolaters</b>—A case in point.
	As the Israelites <i>sat down</i> (a deliberate act), <i>ate,</i> and
	<i>drank</i> at the idol feast to the calves in Horeb, so the
	Corinthians were in danger of idolatry by a like act, though not
	professedly worshipping an idol as the Israelites (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:10">1 Corinthians 8:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:11">1 Corinthians 8:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:14">1 Corinthians 10:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:21">1 Corinthians 10:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:6">Exodus 32:6</span>). He passes here from the
	first to the second person, as they alone (not he also) were in
	danger of idolatry, &amp;c. He resumes the first person appropriately
	at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:16">1 Corinthians 10:16</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>some</b>—The multitude
	follow the lead of some bad men. 
	</p>
<p><b>play</b>—with lascivious
	dancing, singing, and drumming round the calf (compare "rejoiced,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:41">Acts 7:41</span>).</p>
