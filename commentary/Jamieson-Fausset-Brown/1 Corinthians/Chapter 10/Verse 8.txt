8. fornication—literally,
	Fornication was generally, as in this case ( :-), associated at the idol feasts with spiritual
	fornication, that is, idolatry. This all applied to the Corinthians
	(1 Corinthians 5:1; 1 Corinthians 5:9;
	1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Corinthians 6:15;
	1 Corinthians 6:18; 1 Corinthians 8:10).
	Balaam tempted Israel to both sins with Midian (1 Corinthians 8:10- :). Compare 1 Corinthians 8:7;
	1 Corinthians 8:9, "stumbling-block,"
	"eat . . . thing offered unto . . . idol." 
	three and twenty thousand—in
	Numbers 25:9 "twenty and four
	thousand." If this were a real discrepancy, it would militate
	rather against inspiration of the subject matter and thought,
	than against verbal inspiration. The solution is: Moses in
	Numbers includes all who died "in the plague"; Paul, all
	who died "in one day"; one thousand more may have
	fallen the next day [KITTO,
	Biblical Cyclopædia]. Or, the real number may have been
	between twenty-three thousand and twenty-four thousand, say
	twenty-three thousand five hundred, or twenty-three thousand six
	hundred; when writing generally where the exact figures were not
	needed, one writer might quite veraciously give one of the two round
	numbers near the exact one, and the other writer the other [BENGEL].
	Whichever be the true way of reconciling the seeming discrepant
	statements, at least the ways given above prove they are not really
	irreconcilable.
