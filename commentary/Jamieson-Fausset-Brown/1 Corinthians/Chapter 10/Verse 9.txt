<p><b>9. tempt Christ</b>—So the oldest
	<i>versions,</i> IRENÆUS
	(264), and <i>good</i> manuscripts read. Some of the <i>oldest</i>
	manuscripts read "Lord"; and one manuscript only "God."
	If "Lord" be read, it will mean <i>Christ.</i> As "Christ"
	was referred to in one of the five privileges of Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), so it is natural that He should be mentioned here in one
	of the five corresponding sins of that people. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> it is "spake against <i>God</i>" (whence probably
	arose the alteration in the one manuscript, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "God," to harmonize it with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). As either "Christ" or "Lord" is the
	genuine reading, "Christ" must be "God." Compare
	"Why do ye tempt the Lord?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:2">Exodus 17:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:7">Exodus 17:7</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:11">Romans 14:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:22">Isaiah 45:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:23">Isaiah 45:23</span>).
	Israel's discontented complainings were temptings of Christ
	especially, the "Angel" of the covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:20">Exodus 23:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:21">Exodus 23:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:34">Exodus 32:34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:9">Isaiah 63:9</span>). Though they drank of
	"that Rock . . . Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:9- :">Isaiah 63:9- :</span>), they yet complained for want of water (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:2">Exodus 17:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:7">Exodus 17:7</span>). Though also eating the
	same spiritual meat (Christ, "the true manna," "the
	bread of life"), they yet murmured, "Our soul loatheth this
	light bread." In this case, being punished by the fiery
	serpents, they were saved by the brazen serpent, the emblem of <i>Christ</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:56">John 8:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:26">Hebrews 11:26</span>).
	The <i>Greek</i> for "tempt" means, <i>tempt</i> or <i>try,
	so as to wear out</i> the long-suffering of Christ (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:8">Psalms 95:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+95:9">Psalms 95:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:22">Numbers 14:22</span>).
	The Corinthians were in danger of provoking God's long-suffering by
	walking on the verge of idolatry, through overweening confidence in
	their knowledge.</p>
