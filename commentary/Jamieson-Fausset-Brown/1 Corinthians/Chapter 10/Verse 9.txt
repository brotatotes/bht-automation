9. tempt Christ—So the oldest
	versions, IRENÆUS
	(264), and good manuscripts read. Some of the oldest
	manuscripts read "Lord"; and one manuscript only "God."
	If "Lord" be read, it will mean Christ. As "Christ"
	was referred to in one of the five privileges of Israel ( :-), so it is natural that He should be mentioned here in one
	of the five corresponding sins of that people. In  :- it is "spake against God" (whence probably
	arose the alteration in the one manuscript,  :-, "God," to harmonize it with  :-). As either "Christ" or "Lord" is the
	genuine reading, "Christ" must be "God." Compare
	"Why do ye tempt the Lord?" (Exodus 17:2;
	Exodus 17:7. Compare Romans 14:11;
	Isaiah 45:22; Isaiah 45:23).
	Israel's discontented complainings were temptings of Christ
	especially, the "Angel" of the covenant (Exodus 23:20;
	Exodus 23:21; Exodus 32:34;
	Isaiah 63:9). Though they drank of
	"that Rock . . . Christ" (Isaiah 63:9- :), they yet complained for want of water (Exodus 17:2;
	Exodus 17:7). Though also eating the
	same spiritual meat (Christ, "the true manna," "the
	bread of life"), they yet murmured, "Our soul loatheth this
	light bread." In this case, being punished by the fiery
	serpents, they were saved by the brazen serpent, the emblem of Christ
	(compare John 8:56; Hebrews 11:26).
	The Greek for "tempt" means, tempt or try,
	so as to wear out the long-suffering of Christ (compare Psalms 95:8;
	Psalms 95:9; Numbers 14:22).
	The Corinthians were in danger of provoking God's long-suffering by
	walking on the verge of idolatry, through overweening confidence in
	their knowledge.
