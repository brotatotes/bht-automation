	kerchief: French couvre chef, head-covering, the emblem of
	"power on her head"; the sign of her being under man's
	power, and exercising delegated authority under him. Paul had before

	Ephesians 3:10; Ecclesiastes 5:6).
	HAMMOND quotes CHRYSOSTOM,
	"Thou standest with angels; thou singest with them; thou hymnest
	with them; and yet dost thou stand laughing?" BENGEL
	explains, "As the angels are in relation to God, so the woman is
	in relation to man. God's face is uncovered; angels in His presence
	are veiled (Isaiah 6:2). Man's face
	is uncovered; woman in His presence is to be veiled. For her not to
	be so, would, by its indecorousness, offend the angels (Matthew 18:10;
	Matthew 18:31). She, by her weakness,
	especially needs their ministry; she ought, therefore, to be the more
	careful not to offend them."
