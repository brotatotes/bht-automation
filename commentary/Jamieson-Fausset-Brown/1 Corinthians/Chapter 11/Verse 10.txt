	kerchief: French <i>couvre chef, head-covering, the emblem</i> of
	"power on her head"; the sign of her being under man's
	power, and exercising delegated authority under him. Paul had before
	his mind the root-connection between the <i>Hebrew</i> terms for
	"veil" (<i>radid</i>), and "subjection" (<i>radad</i>).

<p><b>because of the angels</b>—who
	are present at our Christian assemblies (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "gods," that is, <i>angels</i>), and delight in
	the orderly subordination of the several ranks of God's worshippers
	in their respective places, the outward demeanor and dress of the
	latter being indicative of that inward humility which angels know to
	be most pleasing to their common Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>;

	HAMMOND quotes CHRYSOSTOM,
	"Thou standest with angels; thou singest with them; thou hymnest
	with them; and yet dost thou stand laughing?" BENGEL
	explains, "As the angels are in relation to God, so the woman is
	in relation to man. God's face is uncovered; angels in His presence
	are veiled (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:2">Isaiah 6:2</span>). Man's face
	is uncovered; woman in His presence is to be veiled. For her not to
	be so, would, by its indecorousness, offend the angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:10">Matthew 18:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:31">Matthew 18:31</span>). She, by her weakness,
	especially needs their ministry; she ought, therefore, to be the more
	careful not to offend them."</p>
