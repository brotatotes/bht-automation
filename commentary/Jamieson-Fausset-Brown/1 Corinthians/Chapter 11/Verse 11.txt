<p><b>11.</b> Yet neither sex is insulated
	and independent of the other in the Christian life [ALFORD].
	The one needs the other in the sexual relation; and in respect to
	Christ ("in the Lord"), the man and the woman together (for
	neither can be dispensed with) realize the ideal of redeemed humanity
	represented by the bride, the Church.</p>
