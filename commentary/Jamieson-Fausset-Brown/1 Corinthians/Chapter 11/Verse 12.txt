<p><b>12.</b> As the woman was formed <i>out
	of</i> (from) the man, even so is man born <i>by means</i> of woman;
	but all things (including both man and woman) are <i>from</i> God as
	their source (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18">2 Corinthians 5:18</span>).
	They depend mutually each on the other, and both on him.</p>
