<p><b>14.</b> The fact that nature has
	provided woman, and not man, with long hair, proves that man was
	designed to be uncovered, and woman covered. The Nazarite, however,
	wore long hair lawfully, as being part of a vow sanctioned by God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Compare as to Absalom, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+14:26">2 Samuel 14:26</span>;
