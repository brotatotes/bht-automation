<p><b>16.</b> A summary close to the
	argument by appeal to the universal custom of the churches. 
	</p>
<p><b>if any . . . seem</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> also means "<i>thinks</i>" (fit) (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). If any man <i>chooses</i> (still after all my arguments) to
	be contentious. If any be contentious and <i>thinks</i> himself <i>right</i>
	in being so. A reproof of the Corinthians' self-sufficiency and
	disputatiousness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:20">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>we</b>—apostles: or we of
	the Jewish nation, from whom ye have received the Gospel, and whose
	usages in all that is good ye ought to follow: Jewish women veiled
	themselves when in public, according to TERTULLIAN
	[ESTIUS]. The former
	explanation is best, as the Jews are not referred to in the context:
	but he often refers to himself and his fellow apostles, by the
	expression, "we—us" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:10">1 Corinthians 4:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>no such custom</b>—as that
	of women praying uncovered. Not as CHRYSOSTOM,
	"that of being contentious." The <i>Greek</i> term implies
	a <i>usage,</i> rather than a <i>mental habit</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:10- :">1 Corinthians 4:10- :</span>). The usage of true "churches (plural: not, as Rome
	uses it, 'the Church,' as an abstract entity; but '<i>the churches,</i>'
	as a number of <i>independent witnesses</i>) of God" (the
	churches which God Himself recognizes), is a valid argument <i>in the
	case of external rites,</i> especially, <i>negatively,</i> for
	example, Such rites were not received among them, therefore, ought
	not to be admitted among us: but in questions of <i>doctrine,</i> or
	the <i>essentials of worship,</i> the argument is not valid [SCLATER]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:17">1 Corinthians 7:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:33">1 Corinthians 14:33</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>neither</b>—nor yet.
	Catholic usage is not an infallible test of <i>truth,</i> but a
	general test of <i>decency.</i></p>
