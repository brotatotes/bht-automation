16. A summary close to the
	argument by appeal to the universal custom of the churches. 
	if any . . . seem—The
	Greek also means "thinks" (fit) (compare  :-). If any man chooses (still after all my arguments) to
	be contentious. If any be contentious and thinks himself right
	in being so. A reproof of the Corinthians' self-sufficiency and
	disputatiousness (1 Corinthians 1:20). 
	we—apostles: or we of
	the Jewish nation, from whom ye have received the Gospel, and whose
	usages in all that is good ye ought to follow: Jewish women veiled
	themselves when in public, according to TERTULLIAN
	[ESTIUS]. The former
	explanation is best, as the Jews are not referred to in the context:
	but he often refers to himself and his fellow apostles, by the
	expression, "we—us" (1 Corinthians 4:9;
	1 Corinthians 4:10). 
	no such custom—as that
	of women praying uncovered. Not as CHRYSOSTOM,
	"that of being contentious." The Greek term implies
	a usage, rather than a mental habit (1 Corinthians 4:10- :). The usage of true "churches (plural: not, as Rome
	uses it, 'the Church,' as an abstract entity; but 'the churches,'
	as a number of independent witnesses) of God" (the
	churches which God Himself recognizes), is a valid argument in the
	case of external rites, especially, negatively, for
	example, Such rites were not received among them, therefore, ought
	not to be admitted among us: but in questions of doctrine, or
	the essentials of worship, the argument is not valid [SCLATER]
	(1 Corinthians 7:17; 1 Corinthians 14:33).
	neither—nor yet.
	Catholic usage is not an infallible test of truth, but a
	general test of decency.
