18. first of all—In the first
	place. The "divisions" (Greek, "schisms")
	meant, are not merely those of opinion ( :-), but in outward acts at the love-feasts (Agapæ),
	(1 Corinthians 11:21). He does not
	follow up the expression, "in the first place," by "in
	the second place." But though not expressed, a second
	abuse was in his mind when he said, "In the first place,"
	namely, THE ABUSE OF SPIRITUAL
	GIFTS, which also created disorder in their assemblies
	[ALFORD], (1 Corinthians 12:1;
	1 Corinthians 14:23; 1 Corinthians 14:26;
	1 Corinthians 14:33; 1 Corinthians 14:40).
	in the church—not the
	place of worship; for ISIDORE OF
	PELUSIUM denies that there
	were such places specially set apart for worship in the apostles'
	times [Epistle, 246.2]. But, "in the assembly" or
	"congregation"; in convocation for worship, where
	especially love, order, and harmony should prevail. The very
	ordinance instituted for uniting together believers in one body, was
	made an occasion of "divisions" (schisms). 
	partly—He hereby
	excepts the innocent. "I am unwilling to believe all I
	hear, but some I cannot help believing" [ALFORD]:
	while my love is unaffected by it [BENGEL].
