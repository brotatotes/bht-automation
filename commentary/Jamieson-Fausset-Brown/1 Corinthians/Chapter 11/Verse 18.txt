<p><b>18. first of all</b>—In the first
	place. The "divisions" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>schisms</i>")
	meant, are not merely those of opinion (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), but in outward acts at the love-feasts (<i>Agapæ</i>),
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:21">1 Corinthians 11:21</span>). He does not
	follow up the expression, "in the first place," by "in
	the second place." But though not expressed, a <i>second</i>
	abuse was in his mind when he said, "In the first place,"
	namely, THE ABUSE OF SPIRITUAL
	GIFTS, <i>which also created disorder in their assemblies</i>
	[ALFORD], (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:1">1 Corinthians 12:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:23">1 Corinthians 14:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:26">1 Corinthians 14:26</span>;

<p><b>in the church</b>—not the
	place of worship; for ISIDORE OF
	PELUSIUM denies that there
	were such places specially set apart for worship in the apostles'
	times [<i>Epistle,</i> 246.2]. But, "in the assembly" or
	"congregation"; in convocation for worship, where
	especially love, order, and harmony should prevail. The very
	ordinance instituted for uniting together believers in one body, was
	made an occasion of "divisions" (schisms). 
	</p>
<p><b>partly</b>—He hereby
	excepts the innocent. "I am unwilling to believe <i>all</i> I
	hear, but <i>some</i> I cannot help believing" [ALFORD]:
	while my love is unaffected by it [BENGEL].</p>
