<p><b>19. heresies</b>—Not merely
	"schisms" or "divisions" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), which are "<i>recent</i> dissensions of the
	congregation through differences of opinion" [AUGUSTINE,
	<i>Con. Crescon. Don.</i> 2.7, quoted by TRENCH,
	<i>Greek Synonyms of the New Testament</i>], but also "heresies,"
	that is, "schisms which have now become <i>inveterate</i>";
	"Sects" [CAMPBELL,
	vol. 2, pp. 126, 127]: so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:17">Acts 5:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:5">Acts 15:5</span> translate the same
	<i>Greek.</i> At present there were dissensions at the love-feasts;
	but Paul, remembering Jesus' words (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:7">Matthew 18:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:10">Matthew 24:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:12">Matthew 24:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:1">Luke 17:1</span>) foresees "there
	must be (come) also" <i>matured separations,</i> and established
	parties in secession, as separatists. The "must be" arises
	from sin in professors necessarily bearing its natural fruits: these
	are overruled by God to the probation of character of both the godly
	and the ungodly, and to the discipline of the former for glory.
	"Heresies" had not yet its technical sense
	ecclesiastically, referring to doctrinal errors: it means <i>confirmed
	schisms.</i> ST.
	AUGUSTINE'S rule is a
	golden rule as regards questions of heresy and catholicity: "In
	doubtful questions, liberty; in essentials, unity; in all things,
	charity."
