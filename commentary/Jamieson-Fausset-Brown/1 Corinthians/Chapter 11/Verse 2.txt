<p><b>2.</b> Here the chapter ought to

<p><b>ye remember me in all

	<i>particular</i> instances which follow ye fail.

<p><b>ordinances</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"traditions," that is, apostolic directions given by word
	of mouth or in writing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15">2 Thessalonians 2:15</span>).
	The reference here is mainly to <i>ceremonies:</i> for in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15- :">2 Thessalonians 2:15- :</span>, as to the LORD'S
	SUPPER, which is not a
	mere ceremony, he says, not merely, "I <i>delivered</i> unto
	you," but also, "I received of the Lord"; here he says
	only, "I delivered to you." Romanists argue hence for oral
	traditions. But the difficulty is to know <i>what is a</i> genuine
	apostolic tradition intended for all ages. Any that can be <i>proved</i>
	to be such ought to be observed; any that cannot, ought to be
	rejected (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:18">Revelation 22:18</span>). Those
	preserved in the written word alone can be proved to be such.</p>
