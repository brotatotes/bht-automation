	ordinances—Greek,
	"traditions," that is, apostolic directions given by word
	of mouth or in writing (1 Corinthians 11:23;
	1 Corinthians 15:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:15).
	The reference here is mainly to ceremonies: for in 2 Thessalonians 2:15- :, as to the LORD'S
	SUPPER, which is not a
	mere ceremony, he says, not merely, "I delivered unto
	you," but also, "I received of the Lord"; here he says
	only, "I delivered to you." Romanists argue hence for oral
	traditions. But the difficulty is to know what is a genuine
	apostolic tradition intended for all ages. Any that can be proved
	to be such ought to be observed; any that cannot, ought to be
	rejected (Revelation 22:18). Those
	preserved in the written word alone can be proved to be such.
