<p><b>20. When . . . therefore</b>—Resuming

<p><i><b>this</b></i><b> is not
	to</b>—rather, "there is no such thing as eating the LORD'S
	Supper"; <i>it is not possible</i> where each is greedily intent
	only on devouring "HIS OWN
	supper," and some are excluded altogether, not having been
	waited for (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:33">1 Corinthians 11:33</span>), where
	some are "drunken," while others are "hungry"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:21">1 Corinthians 11:21</span>). The love-feast
	usually preceded the Lord's Supper (as eating the Passover came
	before the Lord's Supper at the first institution of the latter). It
	was a club-feast, where each brought his portion, and the rich, extra
	portions for the poor; from it the bread and wine were taken for the
	Eucharist; and it was at it that the excesses took place, which made
	a <i>true</i> celebration of the Lord's Supper during or after it,
	with true discernment of its solemnity, out of the question.</p>
