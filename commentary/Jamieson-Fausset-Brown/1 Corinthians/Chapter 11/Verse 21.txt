<p><b>21. one taketh before </b><i><b>other</b></i><b>
</b>—the rich "before" the poor, who had no supper of
	their own. Instead of "tarrying for one another" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); hence the precept (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:21">1 Corinthians 12:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:25">1 Corinthians 12:25</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>his own supper</b>—"His
	own" belly is his God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:25- :">1 Corinthians 12:25- :</span>); "the <i>Lord's</i> Supper," the spiritual feast,
	never enters his thoughts. 
	</p>
<p><b>drunken</b>—The one has
	more than is good for him, the other less [BENGEL].</p>
