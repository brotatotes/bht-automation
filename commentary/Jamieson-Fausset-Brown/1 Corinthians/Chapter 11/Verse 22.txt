<p><b>houses</b>—(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) —"at home." That is the place to satiate the

	"God hath chosen," however ye show contempt for them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); compare "of God" here, marking the true honor of

	therefore, ought to have received their portion at the love-feasts
	from their wealthier brethren.
