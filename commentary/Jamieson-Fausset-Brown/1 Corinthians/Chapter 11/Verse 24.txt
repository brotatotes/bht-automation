<p><b>24. brake</b>—The <i>breaking</i>
	of the bread involves its <i>distribution</i> and reproves the
	Corinthian mode at the love-feast, of "every one taking before
	other his own supper."

<p><b>my body . . . broken for
	you</b>—"given" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) for you (<i>Greek,</i> "in your behalf"), and
	"broken," so as to be distributed among you. The oldest
	manuscripts omit "broken," leaving it to be supplied from
	"brake." The two old versions, Memphitic and Thebaic, read
	from Luke, "given." The literal "body" could not
	have been meant; for Christ was still sensibly present among His
	disciples when He said, "This is My body." They <i>could</i>
	only have understood Him symbolically and analogically: As this bread
	is to your bodily health, so My body is to the spiritual health of
	the believing communicant. The words, "Take, eat," are not
	in the oldest manuscripts.
