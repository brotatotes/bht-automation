<p><b>25. when he had supped</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"after the eating of supper," namely, the Passover supper
	which preceded the Lord's Supper, as the love-feast did subsequently.
	Therefore, you Corinthians ought to separate common meals from the
	Lord's Supper [BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>the new testament</b>—or
	"covenant." The cup is the parchment-deed, as it were, on
	which My new covenant, or last will is written and sealed, making
	over to you all blessings here and hereafter. 
	</p>
<p><b>in my blood</b>—ratified by
	MY blood: "not by the
	blood of goats and calves" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>as oft as</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"as many times soever": implying that it is an ordinance
	<i>often</i> to be partaken of. 
	</p>
<p><b>in remembrance of me</b>—Luke
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19">Luke 22:19</span>) expresses this,
	which is understood by Matthew and Mark. Paul twice records it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:19- :">Luke 22:19- :</span> and here) as suiting his purpose. The old sacrifices
	brought <i>sins</i> continually to remembrance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:3">Hebrews 10:3</span>). The Lord's Supper
	brings to remembrance <i>Christ</i> and His sacrifice once for all
	for the full and final <i>remission of sins.</i></p>
