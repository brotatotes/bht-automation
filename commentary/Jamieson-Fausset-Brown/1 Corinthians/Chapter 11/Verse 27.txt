<p><b>27. eat and drink</b>â€”So one of
	the oldest manuscripts reads. But three or four equally old
	manuscripts, the <i>Vulgate</i> and CYPRIAN,
	read, "or." Romanists quote this reading in favor of
	communion in one kind. This consequence does not follow. Paul says,
	"Whosoever is guilty of unworthy conduct, <i>either</i> in
	eating the bread, <i>or</i> in drinking the cup, is guilty of the
	body and blood of Christ." Impropriety in only <i>one</i> of the
	two elements, vitiates true communion in <i>both.</i> Therefore, in
	the end of the verse, he says, not "body <i>or</i> blood,"
	but "body and blood." Any who takes the bread without the
	wine, <i>or</i> the wine without the bread, "<i>unworthily</i>"
	communicates, and so "is guilty of Christ's body and blood";
	for he disobeys Christ's express command to partake of both. If we do
	not partake of the sacramental symbol of the Lord's death worthily,
	we share in the guilt of that death. (Compare "crucify to
	themselves the Son of God afresh," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>Unworthiness in the person,</i> is not what ought to
	exclude any, but <i>unworthily communicating:</i> However unworthy we
	be, if we examine ourselves so as to find that we penitently believe
	in Christ's Gospel, we may worthily communicate.</p>
