<p><b>28. examine</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"prove" or "test" his own state of mind in
	respect to Christ's death, and his capability of "discerning the
	Lord's body" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:31">1 Corinthians 11:31</span>). Not auricular
	confession to a priest, but self-examination is necessary. 
	</p>
<p><b>so</b>—after due
	self-examination. 
	</p>
<p><b>of . . . of</b>—In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:31- :">1 Corinthians 11:31- :</span>, where the receiving was <i>unworthily,</i> the expression
	was, "eat this bread, drink . . . cup" without "of."
	Here the "of" implies due circumspection in communicating
	[BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>let him eat</b>—His
	self-examination is not in order that he may stay away, but that he
	may eat, that is, communicate.</p>
