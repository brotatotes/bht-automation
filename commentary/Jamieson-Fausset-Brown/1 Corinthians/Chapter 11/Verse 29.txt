<p><b>29. damnation</b>—A mistranslation
	which has put a stumbling-block in the way of many in respect to
	communicating. The right translation is "judgment." The
	<i>judgment</i> is described (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) as temporal. 
	</p>
<p><b>not discerning</b>—<i>not
	duty judging: not distinguishing in judgment</i> (so the <i>Greek:</i>
	the sin and its punishment thus being marked as corresponding) from
	common food, the sacramental pledges of the Lord's body. Most of the
	oldest manuscripts omit "Lord's" (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Omitting also "unworthily," with most of the
	oldest manuscripts, we must translate, "He that eateth and
	drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, IF he discern not
	the body" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>).
	The Church is "the body of <i>Christ</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29- :">Hebrews 10:29- :</span>). The Lord's body is <i>His literal body</i> appreciated
	and discerned by the soul in the faithful receiving, and not present
	in the elements themselves.</p>
