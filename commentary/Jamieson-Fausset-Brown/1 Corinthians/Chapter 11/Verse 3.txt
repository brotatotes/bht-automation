3. The Corinthian women, on the
	ground of the abolition of distinction of sexes in Christ, claimed
	equality with the male sex, and, overstepping the bounds of
	propriety, came forward to pray and prophesy without the customary
	head-covering of females. The Gospel, doubtless, did raise women from
	the degradation in which they had been sunk, especially in the East.
	Yet, while on a level with males as to the offer of, and standing
	in grace (Galatians 3:28), their
	subjection in point of order, modesty, and seemliness,
	is to be maintained. Paul reproves here their unseemliness as to
	dress: in 1 Corinthians 14:34, as

	"Jesus, therefore, must be of the same essence as God: for,
	since the man is the head of the woman, and since the head is of the
	same essence as the body, and God is the head of the Son, it follows
	the Son is of the same essence as the Father" [CHRYSOSTOM].
	"The woman is of the essence of the man, and not made by the
	man; so, too, the Son is not made by the Father, but of the essence
	of the Father" [THEODORET,
	t. 3, p. 171].
