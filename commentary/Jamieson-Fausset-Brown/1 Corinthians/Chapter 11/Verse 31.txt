<p><b>31. if we would judge ourselves</b>â€”Most
	of the oldest manuscripts, read "But," not "For."
	Translate also literally "If we duly judged ourselves, we should
	not be (or <i>not have been</i>) judged," that is, we should
	escape (or <i>have escaped</i>) our present judgments. In order to
	<i>duly judge</i> or "discern [appreciate] the Lord's body,"
	we need to "duly judge ourselves." A prescient warning
	against the dogma of priestly absolution after full confession, as
	the necessary preliminary to receiving the Lord's Supper.</p>
