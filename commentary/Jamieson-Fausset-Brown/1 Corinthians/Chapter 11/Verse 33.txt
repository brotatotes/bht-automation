<p><b>33. tarry one for another</b>â€”In
	contrast to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:21">1 Corinthians 11:21</span>. The
	expression is not, "Give a share to one another," for all
	the viands brought to the feast were <i>common</i> property, and,
	therefore, they should "tarry" till all were met to partake
	together of the common feast of fellowship [THEOPHYLACT].</p>
