<p><b>34. if any . . . hunger</b>—so as
	not to be able to "tarry for others," let him take off the
	edge of his hunger at home [ALFORD]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:22">1 Corinthians 11:22</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the rest</b>—"the
	other questions you asked me as to the due celebration of the Lord's
	Supper." Not other questions in <i>general;</i> for he does
	subsequently set in order other general questions in this Epistle.</p>
