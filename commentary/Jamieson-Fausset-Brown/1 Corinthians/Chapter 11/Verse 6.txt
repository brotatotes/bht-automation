<p><b>6.</b> A woman would not like to be
	"shorn" or (what is worse) "shaven"; but if she
	chooses to be uncovered (unveiled) in front, let her be so also
	behind, that is, "shorn." 
	</p>
<p><b>a shame</b>â€”an unbecoming
	thing (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Thus the shaving of nuns is "a shame."</p>
