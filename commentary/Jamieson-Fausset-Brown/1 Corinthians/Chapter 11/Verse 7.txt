7-9. Argument, also, from man's
	more immediate relation to God, and the woman's to man. 
	he is . . . image . . . glory
	of God—being created in God's "image," first
	and directly: the woman, subsequently, and indirectly,
	through the mediation of man. Man is the representative of God's
	"glory" this ideal of man being realized most fully in the
	Son of man (Psalms 8:4; Psalms 8:5;
	compare 2 Corinthians 8:23). Man is
	declared in Scripture to be both the "image," and in the
	"likeness," of God (compare 2 Corinthians 8:23- :). But "image" alone is applied to the Son of God
	(Colossians 1:15; compare Colossians 1:15- :). "Express image," Greek, "the
	impress." The Divine Son is not merely "like"
	God, He is God of God, "being of one substance (essence) with
	the Father." [Nicene Creed]. 
	woman . . . glory of . . .
	man—He does not say, also, "the image of the man."
	For the sexes differ: moreover, the woman is created in the image
	of God, as well as the man (Genesis 1:26;
	Genesis 1:27). But as the moon in
	relation to the sun (Genesis 37:9),
	so woman shines not so much with light direct from God, as with light
	derived from man, that is, in her order in creation; not that
	she does not in grace come individually into direct
	communion with God; but even here much of her knowledge is mediately
	given her through man, on whom she is naturally dependent.
