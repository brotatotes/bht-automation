<p><b>7-9.</b> Argument, also, from man's
	more immediate relation to God, and the woman's to man.

<p><b>he is . . . image . . . glory
	of God</b>—being created in God's "image," <i>first</i>
	and <i>directly:</i> the woman, <i>subsequently,</i> and <i>indirectly,</i>
	through the mediation of man. Man is the representative of God's
	"glory" this ideal of man being realized most fully in the
	Son of man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:4">Psalms 8:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:5">Psalms 8:5</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span>). Man is
	declared in Scripture to be both the "image," and in the
	"likeness," of God (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23- :">2 Corinthians 8:23- :</span>). But "image" alone is applied to the Son of God
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15- :">Colossians 1:15- :</span>). "Express image," <i>Greek,</i> "the
	impress." The Divine Son is not merely "<i>like</i>"
	God, He is God of God, "being of one substance (essence) with
	the Father." [<i>Nicene Creed</i>].

<p><b>woman . . . glory of . . .
	man</b>—He does not say, also, "<i>the image</i> of the man."
	For the sexes differ: moreover, the woman is created in the <i>image
	of God,</i> as well as the man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:27">Genesis 1:27</span>). But as the moon in
	relation to the sun (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+37:9">Genesis 37:9</span>),
	so woman shines not so much with light direct from God, as with light
	derived from man, that is, <i>in her order in creation;</i> not that
	she does not <i>in grace</i> come individually into <i>direct</i>
	communion with God; but even here much of her knowledge is mediately
	given her through man, on whom she is naturally dependent.</p>
