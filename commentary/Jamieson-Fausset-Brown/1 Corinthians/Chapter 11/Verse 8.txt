<p><b>8. is of . . . of</b>â€”<i>takes his
	being from</i> ("out of") . . . <i>from:</i> referring to
	woman's original creation, "taken out of man" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The woman was made by God mediately through the man, who
	was, as it were, a veil or medium placed between her and God, and
	therefore, should wear the veil or head-covering in public worship,
	in acknowledgement of this subordination to man in the order of
	creation. The man being made immediately by God as His glory, has no
	veil between himself and God [FABER
	STAPULENSIS in BENGEL].</p>
