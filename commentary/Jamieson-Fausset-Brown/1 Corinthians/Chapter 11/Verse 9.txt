<p><b>9. Neither</b>â€”rather, "For
	also"; <i>Another argument: The immediate object of woman's
	creation.</i> "The man was not created for the sake of the
	woman; but the woman for the sake of the man" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:18">Genesis 2:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:21">Genesis 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:22">Genesis 2:22</span>).
	Just as the Church, the bride, is made for Christ; and yet in both
	the natural and the spiritual creations, the bride, while made for
	the bridegroom, in fulfilling that end, attains her own true "glory,"
	and brings "shame" and "dishonor" on herself by
	any departure from it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:4">1 Corinthians 11:4</span>;
