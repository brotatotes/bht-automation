<p><b>1. spiritual gifts</b>—the signs
	of the Spirit's continued efficacious presence in the Church, which
	is Christ's body, the complement of His incarnation, as the body is
	the complement of the head. By the love which pervades the whole, the
	gifts of the several members, forming reciprocal complements to each
	other, tend to the one object of perfecting the body of Christ. The
	ordinary and permanent gifts are comprehended together with the
	extraordinary, without distinction specified, as both alike flow from
	the divine indwelling Spirit of life. The extraordinary gifts, so far
	from making professors more peculiarly <i>saints</i> than in our day,
	did not always even <i>prove</i> that such persons were in a safe
	state at all (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22">Matthew 7:22</span>). They
	were needed at first in the Church: (1) as a pledge to Christians
	themselves who had just passed over from Judaism or heathendom, that
	God was in the Church; (2) for the propagation of Christianity in the
	world; (3) for the edification of the Church. Now that we have the
	whole <i>written</i> New Testament (which they had not) and
	Christianity established as the result of the miracles, we need no
	further miracle to attest the truth. So the pillar of cloud which
	guided the Israelites was withdrawn when they were sufficiently
	assured of the Divine Presence, the manifestation of God's glory
	being thenceforward enclosed in the Most Holy Place [ARCHBISHOP
	WHATELY]. Paul sets forth
	in order: (1). The unity of the body (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22- :">Matthew 7:22- :</span>). (2). The variety of its members and functions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22- :">Matthew 7:22- :</span>). (3). The grand principle for the right exercise of the
	gifts, namely, love (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:31">1 Corinthians 12:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1-13">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</span>). (4) The
	comparison of the gifts with one another (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1-46.13.13- :">1 Corinthians 13:1-46.13.13- :</span>).
