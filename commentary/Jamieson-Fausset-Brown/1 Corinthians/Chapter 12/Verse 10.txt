10. working of miracles—As
	"healings" are miracles, those here meant must refer to
	miracles of special and extraordinary POWER
	(so the Greek for "miracles" means); for example,
	healings might be effected by human skill in course of time; but the
	raising of the dead, the infliction of death by a word, the innocuous
	use of poisons, c., are miracles of special power. Compare
	Mark 6:5 Acts 19:11.
	prophecy—Here,
	probably, not in the wider sense of public teaching by the Spirit
	(1 Corinthians 11:4; 1 Corinthians 11:5;
	1 Corinthians 14:1-5; 1 Corinthians 14:22-39);
	but, as its position between "miracles" and a "discerning
	of spirits" implies, the inspired disclosure of the future
	(Acts 11:27; Acts 11:28;
	Acts 21:11; 1 Timothy 1:18),
	[HENDERSON]. It depends on
	"faith" (1 Corinthians 12:9;
	Romans 12:6). The prophets
	ranked next to the apostles (1 Corinthians 12:28;
	Ephesians 3:5; Ephesians 4:11).
	As prophecy is part of the whole scheme of redemption, an
	inspired insight into the obscurer parts of the existing Scriptures,
	was the necessary preparation for the miraculous foresight of the
	future. 
	discerning of
	spirits—discerning between the operation of God's Spirit, and
	the evil spirit, or unaided human spirit (Ephesians 4:11- :; compare 1 Timothy 4:1;
	1 John 4:1). 
	kinds of tongues—the
	power of speaking various languages: also a spiritual
	language unknown to man, uttered in ecstasy (1 John 4:1- :). This is marked as a distinct genus in the Greek,
	"To another and a different class." 
	interpretation of tongues—
	(1 Corinthians 14:13; 1 Corinthians 14:26;
	1 Corinthians 14:27).
