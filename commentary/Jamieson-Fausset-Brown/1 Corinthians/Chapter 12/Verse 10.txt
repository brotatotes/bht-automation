<p><b>10. working of miracles</b>—As
	"healings" are miracles, those here meant must refer to
	miracles of special and extraordinary POWER
	(so the <i>Greek</i> for "miracles" means); for example,
	healings might be effected by human skill in course of time; but the
	raising of the dead, the infliction of death by a word, the innocuous
	use of poisons, c., are <i>miracles of special power.</i> Compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:5">Mark 6:5</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:11">Acts 19:11</span>.
	</p>
<p><b>prophecy</b>—Here,
	probably, not in the wider sense of public teaching by the Spirit
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:4">1 Corinthians 11:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:5">1 Corinthians 11:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1-5">1 Corinthians 14:1-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:22-39">1 Corinthians 14:22-39</span>);
	but, as its position between "miracles" and a "discerning
	of spirits" implies, <i>the inspired disclosure of the future</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:27">Acts 11:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:28">Acts 11:28</span>;

	[HENDERSON]. It depends on
	"faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:9">1 Corinthians 12:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:6">Romans 12:6</span>). The <i>prophets</i>
	ranked next to the <i>apostles</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>).
	As <i>prophecy</i> is part of the whole scheme of redemption, an
	inspired insight into the obscurer parts of the existing Scriptures,
	was the necessary preparation for the miraculous foresight of the
	future.

<p><b>discerning of
	spirits</b>—discerning between the operation of God's Spirit, and
	the evil spirit, or unaided human spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11- :">Ephesians 4:11- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>).

<p><b>kinds of tongues</b>—the
	power of speaking <i>various languages:</i> also a <i>spiritual
	language unknown to man, uttered in ecstasy</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1- :">1 John 4:1- :</span>). This is marked as a distinct genus in the <i>Greek,</i>
	"To another and a <i>different</i> class."
