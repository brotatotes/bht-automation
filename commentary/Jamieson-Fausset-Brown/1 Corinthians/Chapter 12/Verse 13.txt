<p><b>13. by . . . Spirit . . .
	baptized</b>—literally, "in"; in virtue of; through. The
	<i>designed</i> effect of baptism, which is realized when not
	frustrated by the unfaithfulness of man. 
	</p>
<p><b>Gentiles</b>—literally,
	"Greeks." 
	</p>
<p><b>all made to drink into one
	Spirit</b>—The oldest manuscripts read, "Made to drink of one
	Spirit," omitting "into" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). There is an indirect allusion to the Lord's Supper, as
	there is a direct allusion to baptism in the beginning of the verse.
	So the "Spirit, the water, and the blood" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), similarly combine the two outward signs with the inward
	things signified, the Spirit's grace. 
	</p>
<p><b>are . . . have been</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "were . . . were" (the past tense).</p>
