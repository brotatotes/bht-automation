<p><b>all . . . suffer with
	it</b>—"When a thorn enters the heel, the whole body feels it,
	and is concerned: the back bends, the belly and thighs contract
	themselves, the hands come forward and draw out the thorn, the head
	stoops, and the eyes regard the affected member with intense gaze"

	the head is crowned, the whole man feels honored, the mouth
	expresses, and the eyes look, gladness" [CHRYSOSTOM].</p>
