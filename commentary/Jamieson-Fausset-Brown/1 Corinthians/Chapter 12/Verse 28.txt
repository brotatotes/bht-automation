<p><b>28. set . . . in the church</b>—as
	He has "set the members . . . in the body" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>first apostles</b>—above
	even the <i>prophets.</i> Not merely the <i>Twelve,</i> but others
	are so called, for example, Barnabas, c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>teachers</b>—who taught,
	for the most part, truths already revealed whereas the <i>prophets</i>
	made new revelations and spoke all their prophesyings under the
	Spirit's influence. As the teachers had the "word of knowledge,"
	so the prophets "the word of wisdom" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Under "teachers" are included "evangelists
	and pastors." 
	</p>
<p><b>miracles</b>—literally,
	"powers" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>):
	ranked below "teachers," as the function of <i>teaching</i>
	is more edifying, though less dazzling than working miracles. 
	</p>
<p><b>helps, governments</b>—lower
	and higher departments of "ministrations" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10- :">1 Corinthians 12:10- :</span>); as instances of the former, deacons whose office it was to
	<i>help</i> in the relief of the poor, and in baptizing and
	preaching, subordinate to higher ministers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:1-10">Acts 6:1-10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:5-17">Acts 8:5-17</span>); also, others
	who <i>helped</i> with their time and means, in the Lord's cause
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:13">1 Corinthians 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:17">Numbers 11:17</span>).
	The Americans similarly use "helps" for "<i>helpers.</i>"
	And, as instances of the latter, <i>presbyters,</i> or <i>bishops,</i>
	whose office it was to <i>govern</i> the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:17">Hebrews 13:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:24">Hebrews 13:24</span>).
	These officers, though now ordinary and permanent, were originally
	specially endowed with the Spirit for their office, whence they are
	here classified with other functions of an inspired character.
	Government (literally, "<i>guiding the helm</i>" of
	affairs), as being occupied with external things, notwithstanding the
	outward status it gives, is ranked by the Spirit with the lower
	functions. Compare "He that giveth" (answering to
	"helps")—"he that ruleth" (answering to
	"governments") (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>).
	Translate, literally, "Helpings, governings" [ALFORD].

<p><b>diversities of tongues</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>). "<i>Divers</i>
	kinds of tongues."</p>
