3. The negative and positive
	criteria of inspiration by the Spirit—the rejection or confession
	of Jesus as Lord [ALFORD]
	(1 John 4:2; 1 John 5:1).
	Paul gives a test of truth against the Gentiles; John, against the
	false prophets. 
	by the Spirit—rather,
	as Greek, "IN
	the Spirit"; that being the power pervading him, and the element
	in which he speaks [ALFORD],
	(Matthew 16:17; John 15:26).
	of God . . . Holy—The
	same Spirit is called at one time "the Spirit of GOD";
	at another, "the HOLY
	Ghost," or "Holy Spirit." Infinite Holiness is
	almost synonymous with Godhead.
speaking . . . say—"Speak"
	implies the act of utterance; "say" refers to that which is
	uttered. Here, "say" means a spiritual and believing
	confession of Him. 
	Jesus—not an abstract
	doctrine, but the historical, living God-man (John 15:26- :). 
	accursed—as the Jews
	and Gentiles treated Him (Galatians 3:13).
	Compare "to curse Christ" in the heathen PLINY'S
	letter [Epistles, 10.97]. The spiritual man feels Him to be
	the Source of all blessings (Galatians 3:13- :) and to be severed from Him is to be accursed (Galatians 3:13- :). 
	Lord—acknowledging
	himself as His servant (Galatians 3:13- :). "Lord" is the Septuagint translation for
	the incommunicable Hebrew name JEHOVAH.
