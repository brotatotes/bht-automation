<p><b>3.</b> The negative and positive
	criteria of inspiration by the Spirit—the rejection or confession
	of Jesus as Lord [ALFORD]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span>).
	Paul gives a test of truth against the Gentiles; John, against the
	false prophets. 
	</p>
<p><b>by the Spirit</b>—rather,
	as <i>Greek,</i> "IN
	the Spirit"; that being the power pervading him, and the element
	in which he speaks [ALFORD],
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26">John 15:26</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>of God . . . Holy</b>—The
	same Spirit is called at one time "the Spirit of GOD";
	at another, "the HOLY
	Ghost," or "Holy Spirit." Infinite <i>Holiness</i> is
	almost synonymous with <i>Godhead.</i>
</p>
<p><b>speaking . . . say</b>—"Speak"
	implies the act of utterance; "say" refers to that which is
	uttered. Here, "say" means a <i>spiritual</i> and <i>believing</i>
	confession of Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>Jesus</b>—not an abstract
	doctrine, but the historical, living God-man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:26- :">John 15:26- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>accursed</b>—as the Jews
	and Gentiles treated Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>).
	Compare "to curse Christ" in the heathen PLINY'S
	letter [<i>Epistles,</i> 10.97]. The spiritual man feels Him to be
	the Source of all blessings (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13- :">Galatians 3:13- :</span>) and to be severed from Him is to be accursed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13- :">Galatians 3:13- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Lord</b>—acknowledging
	himself as His servant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13- :">Galatians 3:13- :</span>). "Lord" is the <i>Septuagint translation</i> for
	the incommunicable <i>Hebrew</i> name JEHOVAH.</p>
