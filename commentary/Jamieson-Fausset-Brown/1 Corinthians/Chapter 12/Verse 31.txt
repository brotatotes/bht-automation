<p><b>31. covet earnestly</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"emulously desire." Not in the spirit of <i>discontented</i>
	"coveting." The Spirit "divides to every man severally
	<i>as He will</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:1">1 Corinthians 12:1</span>);
	but this does not prevent men <i>earnestly seeking,</i> by prayer and
	watchfulness, and cultivation of their faculties, the <i>greatest</i>
	gifts. BEZA explains,
	"Hold in the highest estimation"; which accords with the
	distinction in his view (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:1">1 Corinthians 14:1</span>)
	between "<i>follow after</i> charity—<i>zealously esteem</i>
	spiritual gifts"; also with (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:18">1 Corinthians 12:18</span>) the sovereign will
	with which the Spirit distributes the gifts, precluding individuals
	from desiring gifts not vouchsafed to them. But see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:18- :">1 Corinthians 12:18- :</span>.

<p><b>the best gifts</b>—Most of
	the oldest manuscripts read, "the <i>greatest gifts.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>and yet</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"and <i>moreover.</i>" <i>Besides</i> recommending your
	zealous desire for the greatest gifts, I am about to show you a
	something still more excellent (literally, "a way most
	way-like") to desire, "the way of love" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:18- :">1 Corinthians 12:18- :</span>). This love, or "charity," includes both "faith"
	and "hope" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7">1 Corinthians 13:7</span>),
	and bears the same fruits (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7- :">1 Corinthians 13:7- :</span>) as the ordinary and permanent fruits of the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7- :">1 Corinthians 13:7- :</span>). Thus "long-suffering," compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7- :">1 Corinthians 13:7- :</span>; "faith," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7- :">1 Corinthians 13:7- :</span>; "joy," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7- :">1 Corinthians 13:7- :</span>; "meekness," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7- :">1 Corinthians 13:7- :</span>; "goodness," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7- :">1 Corinthians 13:7- :</span>; "gentleness," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7- :">1 Corinthians 13:7- :</span> (the <i>Greek</i> is the same for "is kind"). It
	is the work of the Holy Spirit, and consists in love to God, on
	account of God's love in Christ to us, and as a consequence, love to
	man, especially to the brethren in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:30">Romans 15:30</span>). This is more to be
	desired than gifts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:20">Luke 10:20</span>).</p>
