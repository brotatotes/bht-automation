31. covet earnestly—Greek,
	"emulously desire." Not in the spirit of discontented
	"coveting." The Spirit "divides to every man severally
	as He will" (1 Corinthians 12:1);
	but this does not prevent men earnestly seeking, by prayer and
	watchfulness, and cultivation of their faculties, the greatest
	gifts. BEZA explains,
	"Hold in the highest estimation"; which accords with the
	distinction in his view (1 Corinthians 14:1)
	between "follow after charity—zealously esteem
	spiritual gifts"; also with (1 Corinthians 12:11;
	1 Corinthians 12:18) the sovereign will
	with which the Spirit distributes the gifts, precluding individuals
	from desiring gifts not vouchsafed to them. But see on 1 Corinthians 12:18- :. 
	the best gifts—Most of
	the oldest manuscripts read, "the greatest gifts." 
	and yet—Greek,
	"and moreover." Besides recommending your
	zealous desire for the greatest gifts, I am about to show you a
	something still more excellent (literally, "a way most
	way-like") to desire, "the way of love" (compare 1 Corinthians 12:18- :). This love, or "charity," includes both "faith"
	and "hope" (1 Corinthians 13:7),
	and bears the same fruits (1 Corinthians 13:7- :) as the ordinary and permanent fruits of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 13:7- :). Thus "long-suffering," compare 1 Corinthians 13:7- :; "faith," 1 Corinthians 13:7- :; "joy," 1 Corinthians 13:7- :; "meekness," 1 Corinthians 13:7- :; "goodness," 1 Corinthians 13:7- :; "gentleness," 1 Corinthians 13:7- : (the Greek is the same for "is kind"). It
	is the work of the Holy Spirit, and consists in love to God, on
	account of God's love in Christ to us, and as a consequence, love to
	man, especially to the brethren in Christ (Romans 5:5;
	Romans 15:30). This is more to be
	desired than gifts (Luke 10:20).
