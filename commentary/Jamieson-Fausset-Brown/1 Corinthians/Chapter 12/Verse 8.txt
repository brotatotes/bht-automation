<p><b>8-10.</b> Three classes of gifts are
	distinguished by a distinct <i>Greek</i> word for "another"
	(<i>a distinct class</i>), marking the three several <i>genera: allo</i>
	marks the species, <i>hetero</i> the <i>genera</i> (compare <i>Greek,</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:39-41">1 Corinthians 15:39-41</span>). I.
	Gifts of intellect, namely, (1) wisdom; (2) knowledge. II. Gifts
	dependent on a special <i>faith,</i> namely, that of miracles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:39-46.15.41- :">1 Corinthians 15:39-46.15.41- :</span>): (1) healings; (2) workings of miracles; (3) prophecy of
	future events; (4) discerning of spirits, or the divinely given
	faculty of distinguishing between those really inspired, and those
	who pretended to inspiration. III. Gifts referring to the <i>tongues:</i>
	(1) diverse kinds of tongues; (2) interpretation of tongues. The
	catalogue in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span> is not
	meant strictly to harmonize with the one here, though there are some
	particulars in which they correspond. The three genera are summarily
	referred to by single instances of each in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28- :">1 Corinthians 12:28- :</span>. The first genus refers more to believers; the second, to
	unbelievers. 
	</p>
<p><b>by . . . by . . . by</b>—The
	first in <i>Greek</i> is, "By means of," or "through
	the operation of"; the second is, "according to" the
	disposing of (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:11">1 Corinthians 12:11</span>);
	the third is, "in," that is, <i>under the influence of</i>
	(so the <i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:43">Matthew 22:43</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:27">Luke 2:27</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>word of wisdom</b>—the
	ready <i>utterance of</i> (for imparting to others, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:27- :">Luke 2:27- :</span>) <i>wisdom,</i> namely, new revelations of the divine wisdom
	in redemption, as contrasted with human philosophy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:24">1 Corinthians 1:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:8">Ephesians 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:3">Colossians 2:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>word of knowledge</b>—ready
	<i>utterance supernaturally</i> imparted of truths ALREADY
	REVEALED (in this it is distinguished from "the word of
	wisdom," which related to NEW
	revelations). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:6">1 Corinthians 14:6</span>,
	where "revelation" (answering to "wisdom" here)
	is distinguished from "knowledge" [HENDERSON].
	<i>Wisdom</i> or <i>revelation</i> belonged to the "prophets";
	<i>knowledge,</i> to the "teachers." <i>Wisdom</i>
	penetrates deeper than <i>knowledge. Knowledge</i> relates to things
	that are to be done. <i>Wisdom,</i> to things eternal: hence, <i>wisdom</i>
	is not, like <i>knowledge,</i> said to "pass away" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:6- :">1 Corinthians 14:6- :</span>), [BENGEL].</p>
