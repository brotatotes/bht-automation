<p><b>9. faith</b>—not of doctrines, but
	of miracles: confidence in God, by the impulse of His Spirit, that He
	would enable them to perform any required miracle (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:2">1 Corinthians 13:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:23">Mark 11:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:15">James 5:15</span>).
	Its nature, or principle, is the same as that of saving faith,
	namely, reliance on God; the producing cause, also, in the same,'
	namely, a power altogether supernatural (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>). But the objects of
	faith differ respectively. Hence, we see, saving faith does not save
	by its instrinsic merit, but by the merits of Him who is the object
	of it.

<p><b>healing</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	plural, "healings"; referring to different kinds of disease
	which need different kinds of healing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20- :">Ephesians 1:20- :</span>).</p>
