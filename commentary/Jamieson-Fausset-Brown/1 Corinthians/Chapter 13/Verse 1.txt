<p><b>1. tongues</b>—from these he
	ascends to "prophecy" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); then, to "faith"; then to benevolent and
	self-sacrificing deeds: a climax. He does not except even himself,
	and so passes from addressing <i>them</i> ("unto you," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) to putting the case in his own person, "Though I,"
	c.

<p><b>speak with the tongues</b>—with
	the eloquence which was so much admired at Corinth (for example,
	Apollos, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:24">Acts 18:24</span> compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21">1 Corinthians 3:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span>), and with the command
	of various languages, which some at Corinth abused to purposes of
	mere ostentation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>,
	&amp;c.). 
	</p>
<p><b>of angels</b>—higher than
	men, and therefore, it is to be supposed, speaking a more exalted
	language. 
	</p>
<p><b>charity</b>—the principle
	of the ordinary and more important gifts of the Spirit, as contrasted
	with the extraordinary gifts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2- :">1 Corinthians 14:2- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>sounding . . . tinkling</b>—<i>sound</i>
	without soul or feeling: such are "tongues" without
	<i>charity.</i>
</p>
<p><b>cymbal</b>—Two kinds are
	noticed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+150:5">Psalms 150:5</span>), the loud
	or <i>clear,</i> and the <i>high-sounding</i> one: hand cymbals and
	finger cymbals, or castanets. The sound is sharp and piercing.</p>
