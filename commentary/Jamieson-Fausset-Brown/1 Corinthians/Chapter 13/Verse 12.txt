<p><b>12. now</b>—in our present state.

<p><b>see</b>—an appropriate
	expression, in connection with the "prophets" of <i>seers</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:9">1 Samuel 9:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>through a glass</b>—that
	is, in a mirror; the reflection <i>seeming</i> to the eye to be
	behind the mirror, so that we see it <i>through</i> the mirror.
	Ancient mirrors were made of polished brass or other metals. The
	contrast is between the inadequate knowledge of an object gained by
	seeing it reflected in a dim mirror (such as ancient mirrors were),
	compared with the perfect idea we have of it by seeing itself
	directly. 
	</p>
<p><b>darkly</b>—literally, "in
	enigma." As a "mirror" conveys an image to the <i>eye,</i>
	so an "enigma" to the <i>ear.</i> But neither "eye nor
	ear" can fully represent (though the believer's soul gets a
	small revelation now of) "the things which God hath prepared for
	them that love Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:9">1 Corinthians 2:9</span>).
	Paul alludes to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:8">Numbers 12:8</span>, "not
	in <i>dark</i> speeches"; the <i>Septuagint,</i> "not in
	<i>enigmas.</i>" Compared with the <i>visions</i> and <i>dreams</i>
	vouchsafed to other prophets, God's communications with Moses were
	"not in enigmas." But compared with the intuitive and
	direct vision of God hereafter, even the revealed word now is "a
	dark discourse," or a shadowing forth <i>by enigma</i> of God's
	reflected likeness. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:8- :">Numbers 12:8- :</span>, where the "light" or <i>candle</i> in a dark
	place stands in contrast with the "day" dawning. God's word
	is called a <i>glass</i> or mirror also in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:8- :">Numbers 12:8- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>then</b>—"when that
	which is perfect is come" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:8- :">Numbers 12:8- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>face to face</b>—not merely
	"mouth to mouth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:8- :">Numbers 12:8- :</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+32:30">Genesis 32:30</span> was a type
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:50">John 1:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>know . . . known</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "<i>fully</i> know . . . <i>fully</i> known."
	Now we <i>are known by,</i> rather than <i>know,</i> God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:3">1 Corinthians 8:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>).</p>
