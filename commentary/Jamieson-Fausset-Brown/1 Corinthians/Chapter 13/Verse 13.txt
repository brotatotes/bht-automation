<p><b>13. And now</b>—Translate, "<i>But</i>
	now." "In this present state" [HENDERSON].
	Or, "now" does not express time, but <i>opposition,</i> as
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span>, "the case
	being so" [GROTIUS];
	whereas <i>it is the case that</i> the <i>three</i> gifts,
	"prophecy," "tongues," and "knowledge"
	(cited as specimens of the whole class of gifts) "fail"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:8">1 Corinthians 13:8</span>), <i>there abide</i>
	permanently only <i>these three—faith, hope, charity.</i> In one
	sense <i>faith</i> and <i>hope</i> shall be done away, faith being
	superseded by sight, and hope by actual fruition (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:7">2 Corinthians 5:7</span>); and charity, or love,
	alone never faileth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:8">1 Corinthians 13:8</span>).
	But in another sense, "faith and hope," as well as
	"charity," ABIDE;
	namely, after the extraordinary gifts have ceased; for those three
	are <i>necessary and sufficient for salvation at all times,</i>
	whereas the extraordinary gifts are not at all so; compare the use of
	"abide," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:14">1 Corinthians 3:14</span>.
	<i>Charity,</i> or love, is connected specially with the Holy Spirit,
	who is the bond of the loving union between the brethren (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:30">Romans 15:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:8">Colossians 1:8</span>). <i>Faith</i> is towards
	God. <i>Hope</i> is in behalf of ourselves. <i>Charity</i> is love to
	God creating in us love towards our neighbor. In an unbeliever there
	is more or less of the three opposites—unbelief, despair, hatred.
	Even hereafter <i>faith</i> in the sense of <i>trust in God</i>
	"abideth"; also "hope," in relation to ever new
	joys in prospect, and at the anticipation of ever increasing
	blessedness, sure never to be disappointed. But love alone in every
	sense "abideth"; it is therefore "the greatest"
	of the three, as also because it presupposes "faith," which
	without "love" and its consequent "works" is dead
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6">Galatians 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:17">James 2:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:20">James 2:20</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>but</b>—rather, "and";
	as there is not so strong opposition between charity and the other
	two, faith and hope, which like it also "abide."</p>
