	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>). <i>Mysteries</i>
	refer to the deep counsels of God hitherto secret, but now revealed
	to His saints. <i>Knowledge,</i> to truths long known.

<p><b>faith . . . remove mountains</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:20">Matthew 17:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</span>).
	The practical power of the will elevated by faith [NEANDER];
	confidence in God that the miraculous result will surely follow the
	exercise of the will at the secret impulse of His Spirit. Without
	"love" prophecy, knowledge, and faith, are not what they
	seem (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:2">1 Corinthians 8:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:22">Matthew 7:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:14">James 2:14</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:8">1 Corinthians 13:8</span>), and so fail
	of the heavenly reward (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:2">Matthew 6:2</span>).
	Thus Paul, who teaches justification by faith only (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:5">Romans 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7-14">Galatians 3:7-14</span>), is shown to
	agree with James, who teaches (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7-48.3.14- :">Galatians 3:7-48.3.14- :</span>) "by works" (that is, by LOVE,
	which is the "spirit" of faith, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7-48.3.14- :">Galatians 3:7-48.3.14- :</span>) a man is justified, "and not by faith only."</p>
