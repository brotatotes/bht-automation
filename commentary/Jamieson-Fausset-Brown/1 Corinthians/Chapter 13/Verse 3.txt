3. bestow . . . goods . . .
	poor—literally, "dole out in food" all my goods; one
	of the highest functions of the "helps" ( :-). 
	give . . . body to be
	burned—literally, "to such a degree as that I should be
	burned." As the three youths did ( :-), "yielded their bodies" (compare  :-). These are most noble exemplifications of love in giving
	and in suffering. Yet they may be without love; in which case the
	"goods" and "body" are given, but not the soul,
	which is the sphere of love. Without the soul God rejects all else,
	and so rejects the man, who is therefore "profited" nothing
	(Matthew 16:26; Luke 9:23-25).
	Men will fight for Christianity, and die for Christianity, but not
	live in its spirit, which is love.
