<p><b>3. bestow . . . goods . . .
	poor</b>—literally, "dole out in food" all my goods; one
	of the highest functions of the "helps" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>give . . . body to be
	burned</b>—literally, "to such a degree as that I should be
	burned." As the three youths did (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "yielded their bodies" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). These are most noble exemplifications of love in giving
	and in suffering. Yet they may be without love; in which case the
	"goods" and "body" are given, but not the <i>soul,</i>
	which is the sphere of love. Without the soul God rejects all else,
	and so rejects the man, who is therefore "profited" nothing
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:23-25">Luke 9:23-25</span>).
	Men will fight for Christianity, and die for Christianity, but not
	live in its spirit, which is <i>love.</i></p>
