<p><b>4. suffereth long</b>—under
	provocations of <i>evil from</i> others. The negative side of <i>love.</i>
</p>
<p><b>is kind</b>—the positive
	side. Extending <i>good</i> to others. Compare with love's features
	here those of the "wisdom from above" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>envieth</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	includes also <i>jealousy.</i>
</p>
<p><b>vaunteth not</b>—in words,
	even of gifts which it really possesses; an indirect rebuke of those
	at Corinth who used the gift of tongues for mere display. 
	</p>
<p><b>not puffed up</b>—with
	party zeal, as some at Corinth were (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
