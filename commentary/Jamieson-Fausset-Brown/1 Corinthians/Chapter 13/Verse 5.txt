<p><b>5. not . . . unseemly</b>—<i>is
	not uncourteous,</i> or inattentive to civility and propriety. 
	</p>
<p><b>thinketh no evil</b>—<i>imputeth
	not evil</i> [ALFORD];
	literally, "<i>the</i> evil" which actually is there
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:12">Proverbs 10:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:8">1 Peter 4:8</span>).
	Love makes allowances for the falls of others, and is ready to put on
	them a charitable construction. Love, so far from devising evil
	against another, excuses "<i>the</i> evil" which another
	inflicts on her [ESTIUS];
	<i>doth not meditate upon evil</i> inflicted by another [BENGEL];
	and in doubtful cases, takes the more charitable view [GROTIUS].</p>
