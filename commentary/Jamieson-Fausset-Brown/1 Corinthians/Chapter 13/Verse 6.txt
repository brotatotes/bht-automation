6. rejoiceth in the truthâ€”rather,
	"rejoiceth with the truth." Exults not at the
	perpetration of iniquity (unrighteousness) by others (compare Genesis 9:22;
	Genesis 9:23), but rejoices when the
	truth rejoices; sympathizes with it in its triumphs (Genesis 9:23- :). See the opposite (2 Timothy 3:8),
	"Resist the truth." So "the truth" and
	"unrighteousness" are contrasted (2 Timothy 3:8- :). "The truth" is the Gospel truth, the inseparable
	ally of love (Ephesians 4:15; 2 John 1:12).
	The false charity which compromises "the truth" by glossing
	over "iniquity" or unrighteousness is thus tacitly
	condemned (Proverbs 17:15).
