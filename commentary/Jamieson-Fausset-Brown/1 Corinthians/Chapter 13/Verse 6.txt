<p><b>6. rejoiceth in the truth</b>â€”rather,
	"rejoiceth <i>with</i> the truth." Exults not at the
	perpetration of iniquity (unrighteousness) by others (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:22">Genesis 9:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:23">Genesis 9:23</span>), but rejoices when the
	truth rejoices; sympathizes with it in its triumphs (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:23- :">Genesis 9:23- :</span>). See the opposite (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:8">2 Timothy 3:8</span>),
	"Resist the truth." So "the truth" and
	"unrighteousness" are contrasted (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:8- :">2 Timothy 3:8- :</span>). "The truth" is the Gospel truth, the inseparable
	ally of love (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:15">Ephesians 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:12">2 John 1:12</span>).
	The false charity which compromises "the truth" by glossing
	over "iniquity" or unrighteousness is thus tacitly
	condemned (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+17:15">Proverbs 17:15</span>).</p>
