<p><b>7. Beareth all things</b>—without
	speaking of what it has to bear. The same <i>Greek</i> verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. It <i>endures without divulging</i> to the world personal
	distress. Literally said of <i>holding fast</i> like a watertight
	vessel; so the charitable man <i>contains himself</i> in silence from
	giving vent to what selfishness would prompt under personal hardship.
	</p>
<p><b>believeth all
	things</b>—unsuspiciously believes all that is not palpably false,
	all that it can with a good conscience believe to the credit of
	another. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:17">James 3:17</span>,
	"easy to be entreated"; <i>Greek,</i> "easily
	persuaded." 
	</p>
<p><b>hopeth</b>—what is good of
	another, even when others have ceased to hope. 
	</p>
<p><b>endureth</b>—persecutions
	in a patient and loving spirit.</p>
