7. Beareth all things—without
	speaking of what it has to bear. The same Greek verb as in  :-. It endures without divulging to the world personal
	distress. Literally said of holding fast like a watertight
	vessel; so the charitable man contains himself in silence from
	giving vent to what selfishness would prompt under personal hardship.
	believeth all
	things—unsuspiciously believes all that is not palpably false,
	all that it can with a good conscience believe to the credit of
	another. Compare James 3:17,
	"easy to be entreated"; Greek, "easily
	persuaded." 
	hopeth—what is good of
	another, even when others have ceased to hope. 
	endureth—persecutions
	in a patient and loving spirit.
