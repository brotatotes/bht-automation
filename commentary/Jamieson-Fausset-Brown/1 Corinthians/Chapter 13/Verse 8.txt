<p><b>8. never faileth</b>—never is to
	be out of use; it always holds its place. 
	</p>
<p><b>shall fail . . . vanish
	away</b>—The same <i>Greek</i> verb is used for both; and that
	different from the <i>Greek</i> verb for "faileth."
	Translate, "Shall be done away with," that is, shall be
	dispensed with at the Lord's coming, being superseded by their more
	perfect heavenly analogues; for instance, <i>knowledge</i> by
	<i>intuition.</i> Of "tongues," which are still more
	temporary, the verb is "shall <i>cease.</i>" A primary
	fulfilment of Paul's statement took place when the Church attained
	its maturity; then "tongues" entirely "ceased,"
	and "prophesyings" and "knowledge," so far as
	they were supernatural gifts of the Spirit, were superseded as no
	longer required when the ordinary preaching of the word, and the
	Scriptures of the New Testament collected together, had become
	established institutions.</p>
