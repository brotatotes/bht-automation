<p><b>1. Follow after charity</b>—as
	your first and chief aim, seeing that it is "the greatest"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:13">1 Corinthians 13:13</span>).

<p><b>and desire</b>—Translate,
	"Yet (as a <i>secondary</i> aim) desire zealously (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:13- :">1 Corinthians 13:13- :</span>) spiritual gifts."

<p><b>but rather</b>—"<i>but
	chiefly</i> that ye may prophesy" (speak and exhort under
	inspiration) (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+29:18">Proverbs 29:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:20">1 Thessalonians 5:20</span>), whether as to future
	events, that is, strict <i>prophecy,</i> or explaining obscure parts
	of Scripture, especially the prophetical Scriptures or illustrating
	and setting forth questions of Christian doctrine and practice. Our
	modern <i>preaching</i> is the successor of <i>prophecy,</i> but
	without the inspiration. Desire zealously this (prophecy) <i>more</i>
	than any other spiritual gift; or <i>in preference to</i> "tongues"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:2">1 Corinthians 14:2</span>, &amp;c.) [BENGEL].</p>
