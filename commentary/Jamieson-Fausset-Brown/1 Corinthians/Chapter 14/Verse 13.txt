<p><b>13.</b> Explain, "Let him who
	speaketh with a tongue [unknown] <i>in his prayer</i> (or, <i>when
	praying</i>) <i>strive</i> that he may interpret" [ALFORD].
	This explanation of "pray" is needed by its logical
	connection with "prayer in an unknown tongue" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Though his words be unintelligible to his hearers, let
	him in them pray that he may obtain the gift of interpreting, which
	will make them "edifying" to "the church" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
