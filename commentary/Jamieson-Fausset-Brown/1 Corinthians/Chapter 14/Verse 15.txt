<p><b>and</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"but"; I will not only pray with my spirit, which (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) might leave the understanding unedified, BUT

	cannot pray with the understanding (so as to make myself understood
	by others). A prescient warning, <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> against the
	Roman and Greek practice of keeping liturgies in dead languages,
	which long since have become unintelligible to the masses; though
	their forefathers spoke them at a time when those liturgies were
	framed for <i>general</i> use.</p>
