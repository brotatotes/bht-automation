15. What is it then?—What is
	my determination thereupon? 
	and—rather as Greek,
	"but"; I will not only pray with my spirit, which ( :-) might leave the understanding unedified, BUT
	with the understanding also [ALFORD
	and ELLICOTT]. 
	pray with the understanding
	also—and, by inference, I will keep silence altogether if I
	cannot pray with the understanding (so as to make myself understood
	by others). A prescient warning, mutatis mutandis, against the
	Roman and Greek practice of keeping liturgies in dead languages,
	which long since have become unintelligible to the masses; though
	their forefathers spoke them at a time when those liturgies were
	framed for general use.
