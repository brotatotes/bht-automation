<p><b>19. I had rather</b>â€”The <i>Greek</i>
	verb more literally expresses this meaning, "I WISH
	to speak five words with my understanding (rather) than ten thousand
	words in an unknown tongue"; even the two thousandth part of ten
	thousand. The <i>Greek</i> for "I would rather," would be a
	different verb. Paul would NOT
	wish at all to speak "ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."</p>
