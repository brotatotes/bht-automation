2. speaketh . . . unto God—who
	alone understands all languages. 
	no man
	understandeth—generally speaking; the few who have the gift of
	interpreting tongues are the exception. 
	in the spirit—as
	opposed to "the understanding" ( :-). 
	mysteries—unintelligible
	to the hearers, exciting their wonder, rather than instructing them.
	Corinth, being a mart resorted to by merchants from Asia, Africa, and
	Europe, would give scope amidst its mixed population for the exercise
	of the gift of tongues; but its legitimate use was in an audience
	understanding the tongue of the speaker, not, as the Corinthians
	abused it, in mere display.
