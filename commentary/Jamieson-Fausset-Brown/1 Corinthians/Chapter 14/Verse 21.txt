<p><b>21. In the law</b>â€”as the whole
	Old Testament is called, being all of it the law of God. Compare the
	citation of the Psalms as the "law," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Here the quotation is from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:11">Isaiah 28:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:12">Isaiah 28:12</span>, where God virtually
	says of Israel, This people hear Me not, though I speak to. them in
	the language with which they are familiar; I will therefore speak to
	them in other tongues, namely, those of the foes whom I will send
	against them; but even then they will not hearken to Me; which Paul
	thus applies, Ye see that it is a penalty to be associated with men
	of a strange tongue, yet ye impose this on the Church [GROTIUS];
	they who speak in foreign tongues are like "children" just
	"weaned from the milk" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:12- :">Isaiah 28:12- :</span>), "with stammering lips" speaking unintelligibly
	to the hearers, appearing ridiculous (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:12- :">Isaiah 28:12- :</span>), or as babbling drunkards (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:12- :">Isaiah 28:12- :</span>), or madmen (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:23">1 Corinthians 14:23</span>).</p>
