21. In the lawâ€”as the whole
	Old Testament is called, being all of it the law of God. Compare the
	citation of the Psalms as the "law,"  :-. Here the quotation is from Isaiah 28:11;
	Isaiah 28:12, where God virtually
	says of Israel, This people hear Me not, though I speak to. them in
	the language with which they are familiar; I will therefore speak to
	them in other tongues, namely, those of the foes whom I will send
	against them; but even then they will not hearken to Me; which Paul
	thus applies, Ye see that it is a penalty to be associated with men
	of a strange tongue, yet ye impose this on the Church [GROTIUS];
	they who speak in foreign tongues are like "children" just
	"weaned from the milk" (Isaiah 28:12- :), "with stammering lips" speaking unintelligibly
	to the hearers, appearing ridiculous (Isaiah 28:12- :), or as babbling drunkards (Isaiah 28:12- :), or madmen (1 Corinthians 14:23).
