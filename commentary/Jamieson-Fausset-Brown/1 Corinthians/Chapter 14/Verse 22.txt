22. Thus from Isaiah it appears,
	reasons Paul, that "tongues" (unknown and uninterpreted)
	are not a sign mainly intended for believers (though at the
	conversion of Cornelius and the Gentiles with him, tongues were
	vouchsafed to him and them to confirm their faith), but mainly to be
	a condemnation to those, the majority, who, like Israel in
	Isaiah's day, reject the sign and the accompanying message. Compare
	"yet . . . will they not hear Me" ( :-). "Sign" is often used for a condemnatory
	sign (Ezekiel 4:3; Ezekiel 4:4;
	Matthew 12:39-42). Since they
	will not understand, they shall not understand. 
	prophesying . . . not for
	them that believe not, but . . . believeâ€”that is, prophesying
	has no effect on them that are radically and obstinately like Israel
	(Isaiah 28:11; Isaiah 28:12),
	unbelievers, but on them that are either in receptivity or in fact
	believers; it makes believers of those not wilfully unbelievers
	(1 Corinthians 14:24; 1 Corinthians 14:25;
	Romans 10:17), and spiritually
	nourishes those that already believe.
