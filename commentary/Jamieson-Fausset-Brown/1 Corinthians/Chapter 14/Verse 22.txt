<p><b>22.</b> Thus from Isaiah it appears,
	reasons Paul, that "tongues" (unknown and uninterpreted)
	are not a sign mainly intended for believers (though at the
	conversion of Cornelius and the Gentiles with him, tongues were
	vouchsafed to him and them to confirm their faith), but mainly to be
	a <i>condemnation</i> to those, the majority, who, like Israel in
	Isaiah's day, reject the sign and the accompanying message. Compare
	"yet . . . will they not hear Me" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "Sign" is often used for a <i>condemnatory</i>
	sign (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+4:3">Ezekiel 4:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+4:4">Ezekiel 4:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:39-42">Matthew 12:39-42</span>). Since they
	<i>will</i> not understand, they <i>shall</i> not understand.

<p><b>prophesying . . . not for
	them that believe not, but . . . believe</b>â€”that is, prophesying
	has no effect on them that are radically and obstinately like Israel
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:11">Isaiah 28:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:12">Isaiah 28:12</span>),
	unbelievers, but on them that are either in receptivity or in fact
	believers; it makes believers of those not wilfully unbelievers
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:24">1 Corinthians 14:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:25">1 Corinthians 14:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:17">Romans 10:17</span>), and spiritually
	nourishes those that already believe.</p>
