	tongues</b>—The more there are assembled, and the more that speak
	in unknown tongues, the more will the impression be conveyed to
	strangers "coming in" from curiosity ("unbelievers"),
	or even from a better motive ("unlearned"), that the <i>whole</i>
	body of worshippers is a mob of fanatical "madmen"; and
	that "the Church is like the company of builders of Babel after
	the confusion of tongues, or like the cause tried between two deaf
	men before a deaf judge, celebrated in the Greek epigram"
	[GROTIUS].
