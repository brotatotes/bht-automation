<p><b>secrets of his heart made

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:23">James 1:23</span>), the word of God, in
	the hand of him who prophesieth. Compare the same effect produced on
	Nebuchadnezzar (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:30">Daniel 2:30</span> and end
	of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:47">Daniel 2:47</span>). No argument is

	and by implication that the God who is in you is of a truth the God.
