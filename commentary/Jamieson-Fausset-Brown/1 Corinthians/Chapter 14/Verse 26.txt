<p><b>26. How is it then?</b>—rather,
	"<i>What then</i> is the true rule to be observed as to the use
	of gifts?" Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:15">1 Corinthians 14:15</span>,
	where the same <i>Greek</i> occurs.

<p><b>a psalm</b>—extemporary,
	inspired by the Spirit, as that of Mary, Zechariah, Simeon, and Anna
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:46-55">Luke 1:46-55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:67-79">Luke 1:67-79</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34-38">Luke 2:34-38</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>a doctrine</b>—to impart
	and set forth to the congregation. 
	</p>
<p><b>a tongue . . . a
	revelation</b>—The oldest manuscripts transpose the order:
	"revelation . . . tongue"; "interpretation"
	properly following "tongue" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34-42.2.38- :">Luke 2:34-42.2.38- :</span>).

<p><b>Let all things be done unto
	edifying</b>—The general rule under which this particular case
	fails; an answer to the question at the beginning of this verse. Each
	is bound to obey the ordinances of his church not adverse to
	Scripture. See Article XXXIV, <i>Church of England Prayer Book.</i></p>
