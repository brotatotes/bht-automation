<p><b>32. And</b>â€”following up the
	assertion in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:31">1 Corinthians 14:31</span>, "Ye
	can (if ye will) prophesy one by one," that is, restrain
	yourselves from speaking all together; "and the spirits of the
	prophets," that is, their own spirits, acted on by the Holy
	Spirit, are not so hurried away by His influence, as to cease to be
	under their own control; they can if they will hear others, and not
	demand that they alone should be heard uttering communications from
	God.</p>
