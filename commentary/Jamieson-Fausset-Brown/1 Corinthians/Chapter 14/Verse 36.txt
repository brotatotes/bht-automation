<p><b>36. What!</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i> "Or."
	Are you about to obey me? <i>Or,</i> if you set up your judgment
	above that of other churches. I wish to know, do you pretend that
	your church is the first church FROM which the gospel word came, that
	you should give the law to all others? Or are you the only persons
	In, fro whom it has come?</p>
