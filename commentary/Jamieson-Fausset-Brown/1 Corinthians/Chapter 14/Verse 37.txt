	spiritually endowed. The followers of Apollos prided themselves as

	commandments of the Lord—a direct assertion of inspiration.
	Paul's words as an apostle are Christ's words. Paul appeals not
	merely to one or two, but to a body of men, for the reality of
	three facts about which no body of men could possibly be mistaken:
	(1) that his having converted them was not due to mere eloquence, but
	to the "demonstration of the Spirit and of power"; (2) that
	part of this demonstration consisted in the communication of
	miraculous power, which they were then exercising so generally as to
	require to be corrected in the irregular employment of it; (3) that
	among these miraculous gifts was one which enabled the "prophet"
	or "spiritual person" to decide whether Paul's Epistle was
	Scripture or not. He could not have written so, unless the facts were
	notoriously true: for he takes them for granted, as
	consciously known by the whole body of men whom he addresses [HINDS,
	On Inspiration].
