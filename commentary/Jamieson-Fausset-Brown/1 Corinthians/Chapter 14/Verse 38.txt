<p><b>38. if any man be ignorant</b>—wilfully;
	not wishing to recognize these ordinances and my apostolic authority
	in enjoining them. 
	</p>
<p><b>let him be ignorant</b>—I
	leave him to his ignorance: it will be at his own peril; I feel it a
	waste of words to speak anything further to convince him. An argument
	likely to have weight with the Corinthians, who admired "knowledge"
	so much.</p>
