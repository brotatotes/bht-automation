40. Let, c.â€”The oldest
	manuscripts read, "But let," &c. This verse is
	connected with 1 Corinthians 14:39, "But
	(while desiring prophecy, and not forbidding tongues)
	let all things be done decently." "Church government is the
	best security for Christian liberty" [J. NEWTON].
	(Compare 1 Corinthians 14:23 1 Corinthians 14:26-33).
