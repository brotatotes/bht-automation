<p><b>revelation . . .
	prophesying</b>â€”corresponding one to the other; "revelation"
	being the supernatural <i>unveiling</i> of divine truths to man,
	"prophesying" the enunciation to men of such revelations.
	So "knowledge" corresponds to "doctrine," which
	is the gift of <i>teaching</i> to others our knowledge. As the former

	pair refers to the <i>general obvious truths of salvation,</i>
	brought from the common storehouse of believers.</p>
