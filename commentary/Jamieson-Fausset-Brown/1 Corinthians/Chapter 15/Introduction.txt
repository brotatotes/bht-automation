	RESURRECTION PROVED
	AGAINST THE DENIERS OF
	IT AT CORINTH.
	 
	</p>
<p>Christ's resurrection rests on the
	evidence of many eye-witnesses, including Paul himself, and is the
	great fact preached as the groundwork of the Gospel: they who deny
	the resurrection in general, must deny that of Christ, and the
	consequence of the latter will be, that Christian preaching and faith
	are vain.</p>
