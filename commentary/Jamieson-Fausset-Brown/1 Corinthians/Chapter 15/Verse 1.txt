<p><b>1. Moreover</b>—"Now"
	[ALFORD and ELLICOTT].
	</p>
<p><b>I declare</b>—literally, "I
	make known": it implies some degree of reproach that it should
	be now necessary to make it known to them afresh, owing to some of
	them "not having the knowledge of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:11">Galatians 1:11</span>.

<p><b>wherein ye stand</b>—wherein
	ye now take your stand. This is your present actual privilege, if ye
	suffer not yourselves to fall from your high standing.</p>
