<p><b>10. by . . . grace . . . and his
	grace</b>—The repetition implies the prominence which God's <i>grace</i>
	had in his mind, as the sole cause of his marvellous conversion and
	subsequent labors. Though "not meet to be called an apostle,"
	grace has given him, in Christ, the meetness needed for the office.
	Translate as the <i>Greek,</i> "His grace which was (showed)
	<i>towards</i> me." 
	</p>
<p><b>what I am</b>—occupying the
	honorable office of an apostle. Contrast with this the
	self-sufficient prayer of another Pharisee (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>but I laboured</b>—by God's
	grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:16">Philippians 2:16</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>than they all</b>—than any
	of the apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:7">1 Corinthians 15:7</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>grace of God . . . with
	me</b>—Compare "the Lord working with them" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:7- :">1 Corinthians 15:7- :</span>). The oldest manuscripts omit "which was." The
	"not I, but grace," implies, that though the human will
	concurred <i>with</i> God when brought by His Spirit into conformity
	with His will, yet "grace" so preponderated in the work,
	that his own co-operation is regarded as nothing, and grace as
	virtually the sole agent. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:20">Matthew 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:1">2 Corinthians 6:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:12">Philippians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span>).</p>
