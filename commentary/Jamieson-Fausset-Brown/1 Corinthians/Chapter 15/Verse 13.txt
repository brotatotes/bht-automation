<p><b>13.</b> If there be no general
	resurrection, which is the consequent, then there can have been no
	resurrection of Christ, which is the antecedent. The head and the
	members of the body stand on the same footing: what does not hold
	good of them, does not hold good of Him either: His resurrection and
	theirs are inseparably joined (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20-22">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</span>;
