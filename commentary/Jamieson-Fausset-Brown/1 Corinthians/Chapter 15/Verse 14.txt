14. your faith . . . vainâ€”
	(1 Corinthians 15:11). The Greek
	for "vain" here is, empty, unreal: in 1 Corinthians 15:11- :, on the other hand, it is, without use, frustrated.
	The principal argument of the first preachers in support of
	Christianity was that God had raised Christ from the dead (Acts 1:22;
	Acts 2:32; Acts 4:10;
	Acts 4:33; Acts 13:37;
	Romans 1:4). If this fact were
	false, the faith built on it must be false too.
