<p><b>18. fallen asleep in Christ</b>—in
	communion with Christ as His members. "In Christ's case the term
	used is <i>death,</i> to assure us of the reality of His suffering;
	in our case, <i>sleep,</i> to give us consolation: In His case, His
	resurrection having actually taken place, Paul shrinks not from the
	term death; in ours, the resurrection being still only a matter of
	hope, he uses the term <i>falling asleep</i>" [PHOTIUS,
	<i>Quæstiones Amphilochiæ,</i> 197].
