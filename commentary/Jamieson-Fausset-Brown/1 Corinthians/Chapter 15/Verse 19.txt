<p><b>19.</b> If our hopes in Christ were
	limited to this life only, we should be, of all men, most to be
	pitied; namely, because, while others live unmolested, we are exposed
	to every trial and persecution, and, after all, are doomed to bitter
	disappointment in our most cherished hope; for all our hope of
	salvation, even of the soul (not merely of the body), hangs on the
	resurrection of Christ, without which His death would be of no avail
	to us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>). The heathen are
	"without hope" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span>). We should be even
	worse, for we should be also without present enjoyment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13- :">1 Thessalonians 4:13- :</span>).</p>
