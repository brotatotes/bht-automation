2. ye are saved—rather, "ye
	are being saved." 
	if ye keep in memory what I
	preached unto you—Able critics, BENGEL
	and others, prefer connecting the words thus, "I declare unto
	you the Gospel (1 Corinthians 15:1) in
	what words I preached it unto you." Paul reminds them, or rather
	makes known to them, as if anew, not only the fact of the Gospel, but
	also with what words, and by what arguments, he
	preached it to them. Translate in that case, "if ye hold it
	fast." I prefer arranging as English Version, "By
	which ye are saved, if ye hold fast (in memory and personal
	appropriation) with what speech I preached it unto you." 
	unless—which is
	impossible, your faith is vain, in resting on Christ's resurrection
	as an objective reality.
