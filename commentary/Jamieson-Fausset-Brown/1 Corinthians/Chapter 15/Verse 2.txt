<p><b>2. ye are saved</b>—rather, "ye
	are being saved." 
	</p>
<p><b>if ye keep in memory what I
	preached unto you</b>—Able critics, BENGEL
	and others, prefer connecting the words thus, "I declare unto
	you the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:1">1 Corinthians 15:1</span>) in
	what words I preached it unto you." Paul reminds them, or rather
	makes known to them, as if anew, not only the fact of the Gospel, but
	also <i>with what words,</i> and <i>by what arguments,</i> he
	preached it to them. Translate in that case, "if ye hold it
	fast." I prefer arranging as <i>English Version,</i> "By
	which ye are saved, if ye hold fast (in memory and personal
	appropriation) <i>with what speech</i> I preached it unto you." 
	</p>
<p><b>unless</b>—which is
	impossible, your faith is vain, in resting on Christ's resurrection
	as an objective reality.</p>
