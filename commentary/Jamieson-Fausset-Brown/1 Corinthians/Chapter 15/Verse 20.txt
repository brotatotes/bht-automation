<p><b>the first-fruits</b>—the
	earnest or pledge, that the whole resurrection harvest will follow,
	so that our faith is not vain, nor our hope limited to this life. The
	time of writing this Epistle was probably about the Passover (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); the day after the Passover sabbath was that for offering
	<i>the first-fruits</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+23:10">Leviticus 23:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+23:11">Leviticus 23:11</span>), and the same was the
	day of Christ's resurrection: whence appears the appropriateness of
	the image.</p>
