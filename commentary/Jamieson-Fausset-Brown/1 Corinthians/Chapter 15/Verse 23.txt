<p><b>23. But every man in his own
	order</b>â€”rather, "rank": the <i>Greek</i> is not in the
	abstract, but concrete: image from troops, "each in his own
	regiment." Though all shall rise again, let not any think all
	shall be saved; nay, each shall have his proper place, Christ first
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>), and after Him the
	godly who die in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>),
	in a separate band from the ungodly, and then "the end,"
	that is, the resurrection of the rest of the dead. Christian
	churches, ministers, and individuals seem about to be judged first
	"at His coming" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16- :">1 Thessalonians 4:16- :</span>); then "all the nations" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16- :">1 Thessalonians 4:16- :</span>). Christ's own flock shall share His glory "at His
	coming," which is not to be confounded with "the end,"
	or general judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4-6">Revelation 20:4-6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11-15">Revelation 20:11-15</span>). The latter
	is not in this chapter specially discussed, but only the first
	resurrection, namely, that of the saints: not even the judgment of
	Christian hollow professors (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:11-66.20.15- :">Revelation 20:11-66.20.15- :</span>) at His coming, is handled, but only the glory of them
	"that are Christ's," who alone in the highest sense "obtain
	the resurrection from the dead" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:14">Luke 14:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:35">Luke 20:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:36">Luke 20:36</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:11">Philippians 3:11</span>; see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:11- :">Philippians 3:11- :</span>). The second coming of Christ is not a mere <i>point</i> of
	time, but a <i>period</i> beginning with the resurrection of the just
	at His appearing, and ending with the general judgment. The ground of
	the universal resurrection is the union of all mankind in nature with
	Christ, their representative Head, who has done away with death, by
	His own death in their stead: the ground of the resurrection of
	believers is not merely this, but their personal union with Him as
	<i>their</i> "Life" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:11- :">Philippians 3:11- :</span>), effected <i>causatively</i> by the Holy Spirit, and
	<i>instrumentally</i> by faith as the <i>subjective,</i> and by
	ordinances as the <i>objective</i> means.</p>
