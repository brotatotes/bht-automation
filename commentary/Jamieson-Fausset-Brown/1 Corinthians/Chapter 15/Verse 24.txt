<p><b>24. Then</b>—after that: next in

<p><b>the end</b>—the general
	resurrection, and final judgment and consummation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>delivered up . . . kingdom to
	. . . Father</b>—(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Seeming at variance with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "His dominion is an <i>everlasting</i> dominion which
	<i>shall not pass away.</i>" <i>Really,</i> His giving up of the
	<i>mediatorial</i> kingdom to the Father, when the end for which the
	mediatorial economy was established has been accomplished, is
	altogether in harmony with its continuing everlastingly. The change
	which shall then take place, shall be in the <i>manner</i> of
	administration, not in the <i>kingdom</i> itself; God shall then come
	into <i>direct</i> connection with the earth, instead of
	mediatorially, when Christ shall have fully and finally removed
	everything that severs asunder the holy God and a sinful earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The glory of God is the final end of Christ's mediatorial
	office (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10">Philippians 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:11">Philippians 2:11</span>).
	His co-equality with the Father is independent of the latter, and
	prior to it, and shall, therefore, continue when its function shall
	have ceased. His manhood, too, shall everlastingly continue, though,
	as now, subordinate to the Father. The <i>throne of the Lamb</i> (but
	no longer mediatorial) as well as of God, shall be in the heavenly
	city (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3">Revelation 22:3</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3- :">Revelation 22:3- :</span>). The unity of the Godhead, and the unity of the Church,
	shall be simultaneously manifested at Christ's second coming. Compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zep+3:9">Zephaniah 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:9">Zechariah 14:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:21-24">John 17:21-24</span>. The oldest
	manuscripts for "<i>shall have</i> delivered up," read,
	"<i>delivereth</i> up," which suits the sense better. It is
	"when He <i>shall have</i> put down all rule," that "He
	<i>delivereth</i> up the kingdom to the Father." 
	</p>
<p><b>shall have put down all
	rule</b>—the effect produced during the millennary reign of Himself
	and His saints (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1">Psalms 110:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:6">Psalms 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:6-9">Psalms 2:6-9</span>),
	to which passages Paul refers, resting his argument on the two words,
	"all" and "until," of the Psalmist: a proof of
	verbal inspiration of Scripture (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:26">Revelation 2:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span>). Meanwhile, He "rules
	in the midst of His enemies" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27- :">Revelation 2:27- :</span>). He is styled "the King" when He takes His great
	power (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:17">Revelation 11:17</span>). The <i>Greek</i> for
	"put down" is, "<i>done away with,</i>" or
	"brought to naught." "All" must be subject to
	Him, whether openly opposed powers, as Satan and his angels, or kings
	and angelic principalities (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:17- :">Revelation 11:17- :</span>).</p>
