26. shall beâ€”Greek, "is
	done away with" (Revelation 20:14;
	compare Revelation 1:18). It is to
	believers especially this applies (Revelation 1:18- :); even in the case of unbelievers, death is done away
	with by the general resurrection. Satan brought in sin, and
	sin brought in death! So they shall be destroyed
	(rendered utterly powerless) in the same order (1 Corinthians 15:56;
	Hebrews 2:14; Revelation 19:20;
	Revelation 20:10; Revelation 20:14).
