28. Son . . . himself . . .
	subject—not as the creatures are, but as a Son voluntarily
	subordinate to, though co-equal with, the Father. In the
	mediatorial kingdom, the Son had been, in a manner, distinct from the
	Father. Now, His kingdom shall merge in the Father's, with whom He is
	one; not that there is thus any derogation from His honor; for the
	Father Himself wills "that all should honor the Son, as they
	honor the Father" (John 5:22;
	John 5:23; Hebrews 1:6).
	God . . . all in all—as
	Christ is all in all (Colossians 3:11;
	compare Zechariah 14:9). Then,
	and not till then, "all things," without the least
	infringement of the divine prerogative, shall be subject to the Son,
	and the Son subordinate to the Father, while co-equally sharing His
	glory. Contrast Psalms 10:4; Psalms 14:1.
	Even the saints do not fully realize God as their "all" (Psalms 14:1- :) now, through desiring it; then each shall feel, God is
	all to me.
