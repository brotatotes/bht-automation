<p><b>28. Son . . . himself . . .
	subject</b>—not as the creatures are, but as a Son <i>voluntarily
	subordinate</i> to, though co-equal with, the Father. In the
	mediatorial kingdom, the Son had been, in a manner, distinct from the
	Father. Now, His kingdom shall merge in the Father's, with whom He is
	one; not that there is thus any derogation from His honor; for the
	Father Himself wills "that all should honor the Son, as they
	honor the Father" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>God . . . all in all</b>—as
	Christ is all in all (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11">Colossians 3:11</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:9">Zechariah 14:9</span>). <i>Then,</i>
	and not till then, "<i>all</i> things," without the least
	infringement of the divine prerogative, shall be subject to the Son,
	and the Son subordinate to the Father, while co-equally sharing His
	glory. Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+10:4">Psalms 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1">Psalms 14:1</span>.
	Even the saints do not fully realize God as their "all" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1- :">Psalms 14:1- :</span>) now, through desiring it; then each shall feel, <i>God is
	all to me.</i></p>
