29. Else—if there be no
	resurrection. 
	what shall they do?—How
	wretched is their lot! 
	they . . . which are baptized
	for the dead—third person; a class distinct from that in which
	the apostle places himself, "we" ( :-); first person. ALFORD
	thinks there is an allusion to a practice at Corinth of baptizing a
	living person in behalf of a friend who died unbaptized; thus
	Paul, without giving the least sanction to the practice, uses an ad
	hominem argument from it against its practicers, some of whom,
	though using it, denied the resurrection: "What account can they
	give of their practice; why are they at the trouble of it, if the
	dead rise not?" [So Jesus used an ad hominem argument,  :-]. But if so, it is strange there is no direct censure of
	it. Some Marcionites adopted the practice at a later period, probably
	from taking this passage, as ALFORD
	does; but, generally, it was unknown in the Church. BENGEL
	translates, "over (immediately upon) the dead," that is,
	who will be gathered to the dead immediately after baptism.
	Compare Job 17:1, "the
	graves are ready for me." The price they get for their trouble
	is, that they should be gathered to the dead for ever (1 Corinthians 15:13;
	1 Corinthians 15:16). Many in the ancient
	Church put off baptism till near death. This seems the better view;
	though there may have been some rites of symbolical baptism at
	Corinth, now unknown, perhaps grounded on Jesus' words (Matthew 20:22;
	Matthew 20:23), which Paul here
	alludes to. The best punctuation is, "If the dead rise not at
	all, why are they then baptized for them" (so the oldest
	manuscripts read the last words, instead of "for the dead")?
