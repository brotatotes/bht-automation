<p><b>29. Else</b>—if there be no
	resurrection. 
	</p>
<p><b>what shall they do?</b>—How
	wretched is their lot! 
	</p>
<p><b>they . . . which are baptized
	for the dead</b>—third person; a class distinct from that in which
	the apostle places himself, "we" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); first person. ALFORD
	thinks there is an allusion to a practice at Corinth of baptizing a
	living person <i>in behalf of</i> a friend who died unbaptized; thus
	Paul, without giving the least sanction to the practice, uses an <i>ad
	hominem</i> argument from it against its practicers, some of whom,
	though using it, denied the resurrection: "What account can they
	give of their practice; why are they at the trouble of it, if the
	dead rise not?" [So Jesus used an <i>ad hominem</i> argument, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>]. But if so, it is strange there is no direct censure of
	it. Some Marcionites adopted the practice at a later period, probably
	from taking this passage, as ALFORD
	does; but, generally, it was unknown in the Church. BENGEL
	translates, "over (immediately upon) the dead," that is,
	who will be gathered to the dead <i>immediately after</i> baptism.
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+17:1">Job 17:1</span>, "the
	graves are ready for me." The price they get for their trouble
	is, that they should be gathered to the dead for ever (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:13">1 Corinthians 15:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:16">1 Corinthians 15:16</span>). Many in the ancient
	Church put off baptism till near death. This seems the better view;
	though there may have been some rites of symbolical baptism at
	Corinth, now unknown, perhaps grounded on Jesus' words (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:22">Matthew 20:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span>), which Paul here
	alludes to. The best punctuation is, "If the dead rise not at
	all, why are they then baptized <i>for them</i>" (so the oldest
	manuscripts read the last words, instead of "for the dead")?</p>
