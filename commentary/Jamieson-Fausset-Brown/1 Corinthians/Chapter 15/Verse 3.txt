<p><b>3. I delivered unto you</b>—A
	short creed, or summary of articles of faith, was probably even then
	existing; and a profession in accordance with it was required of
	candidates for baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:37">Acts 8:37</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>first of all</b>—literally,
	"among the foremost points" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:37- :">Acts 8:37- :</span>). The atonement is, in Paul's view, of primary importance. 
	</p>
<p><b>which I . . . received</b>—from
	Christ Himself by special revelation (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:37- :">Acts 8:37- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>died for our sins</b>—that
	is, to atone FOR them; <i>for</i>
	taking away <i>our sins</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:37- :">Acts 8:37- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4">Galatians 1:4</span>): "gave
	Himself for our sins" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:5">Isaiah 53:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:15">2 Corinthians 5:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>).
	The "for" here does not, as in some passages, imply
	vicarious substitution, but "in behalf of" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:3">Hebrews 5:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span>). It does not, however,
	mean merely "on account of," which is expressed by a
	different <i>Greek</i> word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:24- :">1 Peter 2:24- :</span>), (though in <i>English Version</i> translated similarly,
	"for"). 
	</p>
<p><b>according to the
	scriptures</b>—which "cannot be broken." Paul puts the
	testimony of <i>Scripture</i> above that of those who saw the Lord
	after His resurrection [BENGEL].
	So our Lord quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12">Isaiah 53:12</span>,
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:37">Luke 22:37</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:15">Psalms 22:15</span>;
