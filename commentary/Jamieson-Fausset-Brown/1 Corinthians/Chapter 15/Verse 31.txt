<p><b>31. by your rejoicing</b>—<i>by
	the glorying which I have concerning you,</i> as the fruit of my
	labors in the Lord. Some of the earliest manuscripts and fathers read
	"our," with the same sense. BENGEL
	understands "your rejoicing," to be the <i>enjoyable state
	of the Corinthians,</i> as contrasted with his dying daily to give
	his converts <i>rejoicing</i> or <i>glorying</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:8">1 Corinthians 4:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:12">2 Corinthians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:15">2 Corinthians 4:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:13">Ephesians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:26">Philippians 1:26</span>).
	But the words, "which I have," favor the explanation—"<i>the
	rejoicing which I have over you.</i>" Many of the oldest
	manuscripts and <i>Vulgate</i> insert "brethren" here. 
	</p>
<p><b>I die daily</b>—This ought
	to stand first in the sentence, as it is so put prominently forward
	in the <i>Greek.</i> I am day by day in sight of death, exposed to
	it, and expecting it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:12">2 Corinthians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:8">2 Corinthians 1:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:9">2 Corinthians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:23">2 Corinthians 11:23</span>).</p>
