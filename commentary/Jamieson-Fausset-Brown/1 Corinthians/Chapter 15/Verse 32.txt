<p><b>32.</b> Punctuate thus: "If
	after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what
	advantageth it me? If the dead rise not, let us eat and drink,"
	c. [BENGEL]. If "<i>merely
	as a man</i>" (with the mere human hope of the present life not
	with the Christian's hope of the resurrection; answering to "If
	the dead rise not," the parallel clause in the next sentence), I
	have fought with men resembling savage beasts. Heraclitus, of
	Ephesus, had termed his countrymen "wild beasts" four
	hundred years before. So Epimenides called the Cretians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Paul was still at Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and there his life was daily in danger (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:8">2 Corinthians 1:8</span>).
	Though the tumult (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:30">Acts 19:30</span>) had <i>not yet taken
	place</i> (for after it he set out <i>immediately</i> for Macedonia),
	this Epistle was written evidently just before it, when the storm was
	gathering; "many adversaries" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:30- :">Acts 19:30- :</span>) were already menacing him. 
	</p>
<p><b>what advantageth it
	me?</b>—seeing I have renounced all that, "<i>as a mere man,</i>"
	might compensate me for such sufferings, gain, fame, &amp;c. 
	</p>
<p><b>let us eat,</b> &amp;c.—Quoted
	from the <i>Septuagint,</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:30- :">Acts 19:30- :</span>), where the prophet describes the reckless self-indulgence
	of the despisers of God's call to mourning, Let us enjoy the good
	things of life now, for it soon will end. Paul imitates the language
	of such skeptics, to reprove both their theory and practice. "If
	men but persuade themselves that they shall die like the beasts, they
	soon will live like beasts too" [SOUTH].</p>
