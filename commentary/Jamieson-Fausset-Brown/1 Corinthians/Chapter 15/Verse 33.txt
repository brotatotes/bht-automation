<p><b>33. evil communications corrupt good
	manners</b>—a current saying, forming a verse in MENANDER,
	the comic poet, who probably took it from Euripides [SOCRATES,
	<i>Ecclesiastical History,</i> 3.16]. "Evil communications"
	refer to intercourse with those who deny the resurrection. Their
	notion seems to have been that the resurrection is merely spiritual,
	that sin has its seat solely in the body, and will be left behind
	when the soul leaves it, if, indeed, the soul survive death at all.

<p><b>good</b>—not only
	<i>good-natured,</i> but <i>pliant.</i> Intimacy with the profligate
	society around was apt to corrupt the principles of the Corinthians.</p>
