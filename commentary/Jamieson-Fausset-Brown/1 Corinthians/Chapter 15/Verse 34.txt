<p><b>34. Awake</b>—literally, "<i>out

<p><b>sin not</b>—Do not give
	yourselves up to sinful pleasures. The <i>Greek</i> expresses a
	continued state of abstinence from sin. Thus, Paul implies that they
	who live in sinful pleasures readily persuade themselves of what they
	wish, namely, that there is to be no resurrection.

	habitual <i>ignorance:</i> wilful, in that they prefer to keep their
	sins, rather than part with them, in order to <i>know God</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:15">1 Peter 2:15</span>).

<p><b>to your shame</b>—that you
	Corinthian Christians, who boast of your <i>knowledge,</i> should
	have among you, and maintain intercourse with, those so practically
	ignorant of God, as to deny the resurrection.</p>
