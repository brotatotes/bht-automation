34. Awake—literally, "out
	of the sleep" of carnal intoxication into which ye are
	thrown by the influence of these skeptics (1 Corinthians 15:32;
	Joel 1:5). 
	to righteousness—in
	contrast with "sin" in this verse, and corrupt manners
	(1 Corinthians 15:33). 
	sin not—Do not give
	yourselves up to sinful pleasures. The Greek expresses a
	continued state of abstinence from sin. Thus, Paul implies that they
	who live in sinful pleasures readily persuade themselves of what they
	wish, namely, that there is to be no resurrection. 
	some—the same as in 1 Corinthians 15:33- :. 
	have not the knowledge of
	God—and so know not His power in the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:33- :). Stronger than "are ignorant of God." An
	habitual ignorance: wilful, in that they prefer to keep their
	sins, rather than part with them, in order to know God
	(compare John 7:17; 1 Peter 2:15).
	to your shame—that you
	Corinthian Christians, who boast of your knowledge, should
	have among you, and maintain intercourse with, those so practically
	ignorant of God, as to deny the resurrection.
