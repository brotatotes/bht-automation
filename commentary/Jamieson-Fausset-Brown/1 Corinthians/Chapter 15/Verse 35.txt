<p><b>35. How</b>—It is folly to deny a
	fact of REVELATION,
	because we do not know the "<i>how.</i>" Some measure God's
	power by their petty intelligence, and won't admit, <i>even on His
	assurance,</i> anything which they cannot explain. Ezekiel's <i>answer
	of faith</i> to the question is the truly wise one (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). So Jesus argues not on principles of philosophy, but
	wholly from "the power of God," as declared by the Word of
	God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:26">Matthew 19:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:27">Mark 10:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:23">Mark 12:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:27">Luke 18:27</span>).

<p><b>come</b>—The dead are said
	to <i>depart,</i> or to be <i>deceased:</i> those rising again to
	<i>come.</i> The objector could not understand <i>how</i> the dead
	are to rise, and with <i>what kind of a body</i> they are to come. Is
	it to be the same body? If so, how is this, since the resurrection
	bodies will not eat or drink, or beget children, as the natural
	bodies do? Besides, the latter have mouldered into dust. <i>How</i>
	then can they rise again? If it be a different body, how can the
	personal identity be preserved? Paul answers, In one sense it will be
	the same body, in another, a distinct body. It will be a body, but a
	spiritual, not a natural, body.</p>
