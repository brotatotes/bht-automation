<p><b>that which thou</b>—"thou,"
	emphatical: appeal to the objector's <i>own</i> experience: "The
	seed which <i>thou thyself</i> sowest." Paul, in this verse and
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:42">1 Corinthians 15:42</span>, answers the
	question of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:35">1 Corinthians 15:35</span>, "How?"
	and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:37-41">1 Corinthians 15:37-41</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:43">1 Corinthians 15:43</span>, the question, "With
	<i>what kind</i> of body?" He converts the very objection (the
	death of the natural body) into an argument. Death, so far from
	preventing <i>quickening,</i> is the necessary prelude and
	prognostication of it, just as the seed "is not quickened"
	into a new sprout with increased produce, "except it die"
	(except a dissolution of its previous organization takes place).
	Christ by His death for us has not given us a reprieve from death as
	to the life which we have from Adam; nay, He permits the law to take
	its course on our fleshly nature; but He brings from Himself new
	spiritual and heavenly life out of death (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:43- :">1 Corinthians 15:43- :</span>).</p>
