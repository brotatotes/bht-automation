	There is not an identity of all the particles of the old and the new
	body. For the perpetual transmutation of matter is inconsistent with
	this. But there is a hidden germ which constitutes the identity of
	body amidst all outward changes: the outward accretions fall off in
	its development, while the germ remains the same. Every such germ

	"shall have its own body," and be instantly recognized,
	just as each plant now is known from the seed that was sown (see on

	same image illustrated the truth that His death was the necessary
	prelude of His putting on His glorified body, which is the ground of
	the regeneration of the many who believe (1 Corinthians 6:13- :). Progress is the law of the spiritual, as of the natural
	world. Death is the avenue not to mere revivification or
	reanimation, but to resurrection and regeneration
	(Matthew 19:28; Philippians 3:21).
