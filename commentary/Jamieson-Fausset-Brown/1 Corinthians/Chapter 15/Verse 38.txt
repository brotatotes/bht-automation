<p><b>38. as it hath pleased him</b>â€”at
	creation, when He gave <i>to each of the</i> (kinds of) <i>seeds</i>
	(so the <i>Greek</i> is for "to every seed") <i>a body of
	its own</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:11">Genesis 1:11</span>, "after
	its kind," suited to its species). So God can and will give to
	the blessed at the resurrection <i>their own</i> appropriate <i>body,</i>
	such <i>as it pleases Him,</i> and such as is suitable to their
	glorified state: a body peculiar to the individual, substantially the
	same as the body sown.</p>
