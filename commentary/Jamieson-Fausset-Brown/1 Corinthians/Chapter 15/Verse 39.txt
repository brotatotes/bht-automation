39-41. Illustrations of the
	suitability of bodies, however various, to their species: the flesh
	of the several species of animals; bodies celestial and terrestrial;
	the various kinds of light in the sun, moon, and stars, respectively.
	flesh—animal organism
	[DE WETTE].
	He implies by the word that our resurrection bodies shall be in some
	sense really flesh, not mere phantoms of air [ESTIUS].
	So some of the oldest creeds expressed it, "I believe in the
	resurrection of the flesh." Compare as to Jesus' own
	resurrection body, Luke 24:39;
	John 20:27; to which ours shall
	be made like, and therefore shall be flesh, but not of
	animal organism (Philippians 3:21) and
	liable to corruption. But Philippians 3:21- : below implies, it is not "flesh and blood" in the
	animal sense we now understand them; for these "shall not
	inherit the kingdom of God." 
	not the same—not flesh
	of the same nature and excellency. As the kinds of flesh, however
	widely differing from one another, do not cease to be flesh, so the
	kinds of bodies, however differing from one another, are still
	bodies. All this is to illustrate the difference of the new celestial
	body from its terrestrial seed, while retaining a substantial
	identity. 
	beasts—quadrupeds. 
	another of fishes . . .
	another of birds—Most of the oldest manuscripts read thus,
	"another FLESH of
	birds . . . another of fishes": the order of
	nature.
