<p><b>flesh</b>—animal organism
	[DE WETTE].
	He implies by the word that our resurrection bodies shall be in some
	sense really flesh, not mere phantoms of air [ESTIUS].
	So some of the oldest creeds expressed it, "I believe in the
	resurrection of the <i>flesh.</i>" Compare as to Jesus' own
	resurrection body, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:39">Luke 24:39</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:27">John 20:27</span>; to which <i>ours shall
	be made like,</i> and therefore shall be <i>flesh,</i> but not of
	animal organism (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>) and
	liable to corruption. But <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21- :">Philippians 3:21- :</span> below implies, it is not "flesh and blood" in the
	animal sense we now understand them; for these "shall not
	inherit the kingdom of God."

<p><b>not the same</b>—not flesh
	of the same nature and excellency. As the kinds of flesh, however
	widely differing from one another, do not cease to be flesh, so the
	kinds of bodies, however differing from one another, are still
	bodies. All this is to illustrate the difference of the new celestial
	body from its terrestrial seed, while retaining a substantial
	identity.

<p><b>beasts</b>—quadrupeds.

<p><b>another of fishes . . .
	another of birds</b>—Most of the oldest manuscripts read thus,
	"another FLESH of
	<i>birds</i> . . . another of <i>fishes</i>": the order of
	nature.</p>
