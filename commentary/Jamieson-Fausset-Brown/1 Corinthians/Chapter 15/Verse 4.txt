	burial is more closely connected with His resurrection than His
	death. At the moment of His death, the power of His inextinguishable
	life exerted itself (Matthew 27:52).
	The grave was to Him not the destined receptacle of corruption, but
	an apartment fitted for entering into life (Matthew 27:52- :) [BENGEL]. 
	rose again—Greek,
	"hath risen": the state thus begun, and its consequences,
	still continue.
