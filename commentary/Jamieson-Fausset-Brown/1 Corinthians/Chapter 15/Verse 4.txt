<p><b>4. buried . . . rose again</b>—His
	burial is more closely connected with His resurrection than His
	death. At the moment of His death, the power of His inextinguishable
	life exerted itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:52">Matthew 27:52</span>).
	The grave was to Him not the destined receptacle of corruption, but
	an apartment fitted for entering into life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:52- :">Matthew 27:52- :</span>) [BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>rose again</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"hath risen": the state thus begun, and its consequences,
	still continue.</p>
