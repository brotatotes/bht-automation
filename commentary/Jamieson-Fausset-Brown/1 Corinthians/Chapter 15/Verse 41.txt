41. one glory of . . . sun . . .
	another . . . of . . . moonâ€”The analogy is not to prove
	different degrees of glory among the blessed (whether this may be, or
	not, indirectly hinted at), but this: As the various fountains
	of light, which is so similar in its aspect and properties,
	differ (the sun from the moon, and the moon from the stars; and
	even one star from another star, though all seem so much alike);
	so there is nothing unreasonable in the doctrine that our present
	bodies differ from our resurrection bodies, though still
	continuing bodies. Compare the same simile, appropriate
	especially in the clear Eastern skies (Daniel 12:3;
	Matthew 13:43). Also that of seed
	in the same parable (Matthew 13:24;
	Galatians 6:7; Galatians 6:8).
