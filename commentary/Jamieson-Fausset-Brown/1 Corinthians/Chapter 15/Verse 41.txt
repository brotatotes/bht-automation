<p><b>41. one glory of . . . sun . . .
	another . . . of . . . moon</b>â€”The analogy is not to prove
	different degrees of glory among the blessed (whether this may be, or
	not, <i>indirectly</i> hinted at), but this: As the various fountains
	of <i>light,</i> which is so similar in its aspect and properties,
	differ (the sun from the moon, and the moon from the stars; <i>and
	even</i> one star from another star, though all seem so much alike);
	so there is nothing unreasonable in the doctrine that <i>our present
	bodies</i> differ from <i>our resurrection bodies,</i> though still
	continuing <i>bodies.</i> Compare the same simile, appropriate
	especially in the clear Eastern skies (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:3">Daniel 12:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:43">Matthew 13:43</span>). Also that of <i>seed</i>
	in the same parable (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:24">Matthew 13:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:7">Galatians 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:8">Galatians 6:8</span>).</p>
