<p><b>44. a natural body</b>—literally,
	"<i>an animal body,</i>" a body moulded in its organism of
	"flesh and blood" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) to suit the animal soul which predominates in it. The Holy
	Spirit <i>in the spirit</i> of believers, indeed, is an earnest of a
	superior state (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>), but
	meanwhile <i>in the body</i> the animal soul preponderates; hereafter
	the Spirit shall predominate, and the animal soul be duly
	subordinate. 
	</p>
<p><b>spiritual body</b>—a body
	wholly moulded by the Spirit, and its organism not conformed to the
	lower and animal (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:35">Luke 20:35</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:36">Luke 20:36</span>), but to the higher and
	spiritual, life (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>There is,</b> &amp;c.—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "IF
	there is a natural (or <i>animal-souled</i>) body, there is <i>also</i>
	a spiritual body." It is no more wonderful a thing, that there
	should be a body fitted to the capacities and want of man's highest
	part, his spirit (which we see to be the case), than that there
	should be one fitted to the capacities and wants of his subordinate
	part, the animal soul [ALFORD].</p>
