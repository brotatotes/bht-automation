	"an animal body," a body moulded in its organism of
	"flesh and blood" ( :-) to suit the animal soul which predominates in it. The Holy
	Spirit in the spirit of believers, indeed, is an earnest of a
	superior state (Romans 8:11), but
	meanwhile in the body the animal soul preponderates; hereafter
	the Spirit shall predominate, and the animal soul be duly
	subordinate. 
	spiritual body—a body
	wholly moulded by the Spirit, and its organism not conformed to the
	lower and animal (Luke 20:35;
	Luke 20:36), but to the higher and
	spiritual, life (compare 1 Corinthians 2:14;
	1 Thessalonians 5:23).

	oldest manuscripts read, "IF
	there is a natural (or animal-souled) body, there is also
	a spiritual body." It is no more wonderful a thing, that there
	should be a body fitted to the capacities and want of man's highest
	part, his spirit (which we see to be the case), than that there
	should be one fitted to the capacities and wants of his subordinate
	part, the animal soul [ALFORD].
