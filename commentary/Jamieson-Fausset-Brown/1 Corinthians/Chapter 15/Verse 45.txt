<p><b>45. so</b>—in accordance with the
	distinction just mentioned between the natural or <i>animal-souled</i>
	body and the <i>spiritual</i> body. 
	</p>
<p><b>it is written</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); "Man became (was made to become) a living soul,"
	that is, endowed with <i>an animal soul,</i> the living principle of
	his body. 
	</p>
<p><b>the last Adam</b>—the LAST
	Head of humanity, who is to be fully manifested in <i>the last day,</i>
	which is <i>His</i> day (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span>).
	He is so called in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+19:25">Job 19:25</span>;
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+19:25- :">Job 19:25- :</span> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+19:25- :">Job 19:25- :</span>). In contrast to "the last," Paul calls "man"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:7">Genesis 2:7</span>) "the FIRST
	Adam." 
	</p>
<p><b>quickening</b>—not only
	living, but <i>making alive</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:33">John 6:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span>;

	As the <i>natural</i> or <i>animal-souled</i> body (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11- :">Romans 8:11- :</span>) is the fruit of our union with the first Adam, an
	<i>animal-souled</i> man, so the <i>spiritual</i> body is the fruit
	of our union with the second Adam, who is the quickening Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11- :">Romans 8:11- :</span>). As He became representative of the whole of humanity in
	His union of the two natures, He exhausted in His own person the
	sentence of death passed on all men, and giveth spiritual and
	everlasting life to whom He will.</p>
