<p><b>46. afterward</b>â€”Adam had a soul
	not necessarily mortal, as it afterwards became by sin, but "a
	<i>living</i> soul," and destined to live for ever, if he had
	eaten of the tree of life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:22">Genesis 3:22</span>);
	still his body was but an <i>animal-souled</i> body, not a <i>spiritual</i>
	body, such as believers shall have; much less was he a "life-giving
	spirit," as Christ. His soul had the germ of the Spirit, rather
	than the fulness of it, such as man shall have when restored "body,
	soul, and spirit," by the second Adam (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:22- :">Genesis 3:22- :</span>). As the first and lower Adam came before the second and
	heavenly Adam, so the animal-souled body comes first, and must die
	before it be changed into the spiritual body (that is, that in which
	the Spirit predominates over the animal soul).</p>
