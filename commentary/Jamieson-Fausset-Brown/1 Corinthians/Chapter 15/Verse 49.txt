<p><b>49. as</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "even
	as" (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:3">Genesis 5:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>we shall also bear</b>—or
	wear as a garment [BENGEL].
	The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "We must also bear,"
	or "let us also bear." It implies the divine appointment
	(compare "must," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+5:3- :">Genesis 5:3- :</span>) and faith assenting to it. An exhortation, and yet
	implying a promise (so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>).
	The conformity to the image of the heavenly Representative man is to
	be begun here in our souls, in part, and shall be perfected at the
	resurrection in both bodies and souls.</p>
