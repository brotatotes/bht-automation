<p><b>5. seen of Cephas</b>—Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>the twelve</b>—The round
	number for "the Eleven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:33">Luke 24:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:36">Luke 24:36</span>). "The Twelve"
	was their ordinary appellation, even when their number was not full.
	However, very possibly Matthias was present (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:23">Acts 1:23</span>). Some of the oldest
	manuscripts and versions read, "the Eleven": but the best
	on the whole, "the Twelve."</p>
