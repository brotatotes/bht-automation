	and blood" of the same animal and corruptible nature as our
	present (1 Corinthians 15:44)
	animal-souled bodies, cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
	Therefore the believer acquiesces gladly in the unrepealed sentence
	of the holy law, which appoints the death of the present body as the
	necessary preliminary to the resurrection body of glory. Hence he
	"dies daily" to the flesh and to the world, as the

	the change of body possible, but it is necessary. The
	spirit extracted from the dregs of wine does not so much differ from
	them, as the glorified man does from the mortal man [BENGEL]

	1 Corinthians 15:53).
