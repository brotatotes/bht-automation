	<i>animal-souled</i> bodies, cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
	Therefore the believer acquiesces gladly in the unrepealed sentence
	of the holy law, which appoints the death of the present body as the
	necessary preliminary to the resurrection body of glory. Hence he
	"dies daily" to the flesh and to the world, as the
	necessary condition to his regeneration here and hereafter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:6">John 3:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>). As the being <i>born
	of the flesh</i> constitutes a child of Adam, so the being <i>born of
	the Spirit</i> constitutes a child of God.

	of mere animal flesh and blood (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20- :">Galatians 2:20- :</span>). The resurrection body will be still a body though
