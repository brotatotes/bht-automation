<p><b>51. Behold</b>—Calling attention
	to the "mystery" heretofore hidden in God's purposes, but
	now revealed.

<p><b>you</b>—emphatical in the
	<i>Greek;</i> I show (<i>Greek,</i> "tell," namely, <i>by
	the word of the Lord,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>)
	YOU, who think you have so
	much knowledge, "a mystery" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15- :">1 Thessalonians 4:15- :</span>) which your reason could never have discovered. Many of the
	old manuscripts and Fathers read, "We shall all sleep, but we
	shall not all be changed"; but this is plainly a corrupt
	reading, inconsistent with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</span>, and with the apostle's
	argument here, which is that a <i>change</i> is necessary (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:17- :">1 Thessalonians 4:17- :</span>). <i>English Version</i> is supported by some of the oldest
	manuscripts and Fathers. The <i>Greek</i> is literally "We all
	shall not sleep, but," c. The putting off of the corruptible
	body for an incorruptible by an instantaneous <i>change</i> will, in
	the case of "the quick," stand as equivalent to death,
	appointed to all men (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:27">Hebrews 9:27</span>)
	of this Enoch and Elijah are types and forerunners. The "we"
	implies that Christians in that age and every successive age since
	and hereafter were designed to stand waiting, as if Christ might come
	again in their time, and as if they might be found among "the
	quick."</p>
