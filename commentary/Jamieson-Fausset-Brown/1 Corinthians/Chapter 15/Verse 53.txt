<p><b>immortality</b>—Here only,
	besides <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:16">1 Timothy 6:16</span>, the word
	"immortality" is found. Nowhere is the immortality of the
	<i>soul,</i> distinct from the body, taught; a notion which many
	erroneously have derived from heathen philosophers. Scripture does
	not contemplate the anomalous state brought about by death, as the
	consummation to be earnestly looked for (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:16- :">1 Timothy 6:16- :</span>), but the resurrection.</p>
