54. then—not before. Death has
	as yet a sting even to the believer, in that his body
	is to be under its power till the resurrection. But then the sting
	and power of death shall cease for ever. 
	Death is swallowed up in
	victory—In Hebrew of  :-, from which it is quoted, "He (Jehovah) will
	swallow up death in victory"; that is, for ever: as
	"in victory" often means in Hebrew idiom (Jeremiah 3:5;
	Lamentations 5:20). Christ will swallow it
	up so altogether victoriously that it shall never more regain
	its power (compare Hosea 6:2;
	Hosea 13:14; 2 Corinthians 5:4;
	Hebrews 2:14; Hebrews 2:15;
	Revelation 20:14; Revelation 21:4).
