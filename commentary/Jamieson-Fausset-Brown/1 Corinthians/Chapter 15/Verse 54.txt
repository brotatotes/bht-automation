<p><b>54. then</b>—not before. Death has
	as yet <i>a sting</i> even to the believer, in that his <i>body</i>
	is to be under its power till the resurrection. But then the sting
	and power of death shall cease for ever.

<p><b>Death is swallowed up in
	victory</b>—In <i>Hebrew</i> of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, from which it is quoted, "<i>He</i> (Jehovah) <i>will
	swallow up</i> death in victory"; that is, <i>for ever:</i> as
	"in victory" often means in <i>Hebrew</i> idiom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:5">Jeremiah 3:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="la+5:20">Lamentations 5:20</span>). Christ will swallow it
	up <i>so altogether victoriously</i> that it shall never more regain
	its power (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:2">Hosea 6:2</span>;
