<p><b>55.</b> Quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, substantially; but freely used by the warrant of the
	Spirit by which Paul wrote. The <i>Hebrew</i> may be translated, "O
	death, where are thy plagues? Where, O Hades, is thy destruction?"
	The <i>Septuagint,</i> "Where is thy victory (literally, <i>in a
	lawsuit</i>), O death? Where is thy sting, O Hades? . . . Sting"
	answers to the <i>Hebrew</i> "plagues," namely, a poisoned
	<i>sting</i> causing <i>plagues.</i> Appropriate, as to the old
	serpent (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:14">Genesis 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:6">Numbers 21:6</span>). "Victory"
	answers to the <i>Hebrew</i> "destruction." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+21:6- :">Numbers 21:6- :</span>, "<i>destroy</i> . . . veil . . . over all nations,"
	namely, <i>victoriously destroy</i> it; and to "in victory"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:54">1 Corinthians 15:54</span>), which he
	triumphantly repeats. The "where" implies their past
	victorious destroying power and sting, now gone for ever; obtained
	through Satan's triumph over man in Eden, which enlisted God's law on
	the side of Satan and death against man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:17">Romans 5:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:21">Romans 5:21</span>).
	The souls in Hades being freed by the resurrection, death's sting and
	victory are gone. For "O grave," the oldest manuscripts and
	versions read, "O death," the second time.</p>
