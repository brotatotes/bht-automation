<p><b>56.</b> If there were no sin, there
	would be no death. Man's transgression of the law gives death its

<p><b>strength of sin </b><i><b>is</b></i><b>
	the law</b>â€”Without the law sin is not perceived or imputed
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:13">Romans 5:13</span>). The law makes sin the
	more grievous by making God's will the clearer (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:13- :">Romans 5:13- :</span>). Christ's people are no longer "under the law"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:14">Romans 6:14</span>).</p>
