<p><b>57. to God</b>—The victory was in
	no way due to ourselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+98:1">Psalms 98:1</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>giveth</b>—a present
	certainty. 
	</p>
<p><b>the victory</b>—which death
	and Hades ("the grave") had aimed at, but which,
	notwithstanding the opposition of them, as well as of the law and
	sin, we have gained. The repetition of the word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:54">1 Corinthians 15:54</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:55">1 Corinthians 15:55</span>) is appropriate to the
	triumph gained.</p>
