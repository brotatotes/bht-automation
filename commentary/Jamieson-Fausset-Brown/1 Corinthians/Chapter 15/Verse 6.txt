	appearance was probably on the mountain (Tabor, according to
	tradition), in Galilee, when His most solemn and public appearance,
	according to His special promise, was vouchsafed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:32">Matthew 26:32</span>;

	this place, as one remote from Jerusalem, so that believers might
	assemble there more freely and securely. ALFORD'S
	theory of <i>Jerusalem</i> being the scene, is improbable; as such a
	multitude of believers could not, with any safety, have met in one
	place in the metropolis, after His crucifixion there. The number of
	disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15">Acts 1:15</span>) at
	Jerusalem shortly after, was one hundred and twenty, those in Galilee
	and elsewhere not being reckoned. Andronicus and JUNIUS
	were, perhaps, of the number (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15- :">Acts 1:15- :</span>): they are said to be "among the apostles" (who
	all were witnesses of the resurrection, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:15- :">Acts 1:15- :</span>).
