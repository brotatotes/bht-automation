<p><b>8. One born out of due time</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"the one abortively born": the abortion in the family of
	the apostles. As a child <i>born before the due time</i> is puny, and
	though born alive, yet not of the proper size, and scarcely worthy of
	the name of man, so "I am <i>the least</i> of the apostles,"
	scarcely "meet to be called an apostle"; a supernumerary
	taken into the college of apostles out of regular course, not led to
	Christ by long instruction, like a natural birth, but by a sudden
	power, as those prematurely born [GROTIUS].
	Compare the similar image from childbirth, and by the same spiritual
	power, the resurrection of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "<i>Begotten again</i> by the <i>resurrection</i> of
	Jesus." Jesus' appearance to Paul, on the way to Damascus, is
	the one here referred to.</p>
