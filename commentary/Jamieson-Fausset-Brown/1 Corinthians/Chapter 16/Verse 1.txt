<p><b>1. collection for the saints</b>—at
	Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:26">Romans 15:26</span>) and in
	Judea (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:17">Acts 24:17</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:1">2 Corinthians 9:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span>).
	He says "saints" rather than "the poor," to
	remind the Corinthians that in giving, it is to <i>the Lord's people,</i>
	their own <i>brethren in the faith.</i> Towards the close of the
	national existence of the Jews, Judea and Jerusalem were harassed
	with various troubles, which in part affected the Jewish Christians.
	The community of goods which existed among them for a time gave
	temporary relief but tended ultimately to impoverish all by
	paralyzing individual exertion (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12- :">2 Corinthians 9:12- :</span>), and hence was soon discontinued. A beautiful fruit of
	grace it was, that he who had by persecutions robbed many of their
	all (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10">Acts 26:10</span>), should become
	the foremost in exertions for their relief.

<p><b>as I have given</b>—rather,
	"<i>gave</i> order," namely, during my journey through
	Galatia, that mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:10- :">Acts 26:10- :</span>. The churches of Galatia and Phrygia were the last which
	Paul visited before writing this Epistle. He was now at Ephesus, and
	came thither immediately from visiting them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:1">Acts 19:1</span>). That he had not been
	silent in Galatia on contributions for the poor, appears from the
	hint let fall in his Epistle to that church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:1- :">Acts 19:1- :</span>): an undesigned coincidence and mark of genuineness [PALEY,
	<i>Horæ Paulinæ</i>]. He proposes the Galatians as an example to
	the Corinthians, the Corinthians to the Macedonians, the Corinthians
	and Macedonians to the Romans (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:26">Romans 15:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:27">Romans 15:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span>).
	There is great force in example.</p>
