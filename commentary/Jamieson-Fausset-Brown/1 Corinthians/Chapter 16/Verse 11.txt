<p><b>11. despise</b>—This charge is not
	given concerning any other of the many messengers whom Paul sent. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> accounts for it (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). He was a <i>young man,</i> younger probably than those
	usually employed in the Christian missions; whence Paul apprehending
	lest he should, on that account, be exposed to contempt, cautions
	him, "Let no man despise thy youth" [PALEY,
	<i>Horæ Paulinæ</i>].

<p><b>conduct</b>—set him on his
	way with every mark of respect, and with whatever he needs (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>in peace</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:33">Acts 15:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:31">Hebrews 11:31</span>). "Peace" is
	the salutation of kindness and respect in the East; and so it stands
	for every blessing. Perhaps here there is too a contrast between
	"peace" and the "contentions" prevalent at
	Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:11">1 Corinthians 1:11</span>).

<p><b>I look for him</b>—He and
	Titus were appointed to meet Paul in Troas, whither the apostle
	purposed proceeding from Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13">2 Corinthians 2:13</span>). Paul thus claims their
	respect for Timothy as one whom he felt so necessary to himself as
	"look for" to him [THEOPHYLACT].
	</p>
<p><b>with the brethren</b>—Others
	besides Erastus accompanied Timothy to Macedonia (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:12">1 Corinthians 16:12</span>;
