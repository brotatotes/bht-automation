<p><b>12. Apollos, I greatly desired . . .
	to come unto you</b>—He says this lest they should suspect that he
	from jealousy prevented Apollos' coming to them; perhaps they had
	expressly requested Apollos to be sent to them. Apollos was not at
	Ephesus when Paul wrote (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:1">1 Corinthians 1:1</span>). Probably Apollos'
	unwillingness to go to Corinth at this time was because, being aware
	of the undue admiration of his rhetorical style which led astray many
	at Corinth, he did not wish to sanction it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:4">1 Corinthians 3:4</span>). Paul's noble freedom
	from all selfish jealousy led him to urge Apollos to go; and, on the
	other hand, Apollos, having heard of the abuse of his name at Corinth
	to party purposes, perseveringly refused to go. Paul, of course,
	could not state in his letter particularly these reasons in the
	existing state of division prevalent there. He calls Apollos
	"brother" to mark the unity that was between the two. 
	</p>
<p><b>with the brethren</b>—who
	bear this letter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:17">1 Corinthians 16:17</span>).
	(See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:24">1 Corinthians 16:24</span>, subscription
	added to the Epistle). CONYBEARE
	thinks Titus was one of the bearers of this first letter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:16-24">2 Corinthians 8:16-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:18">2 Corinthians 12:18</span>).
	ALFORD thinks "the
	brethren" here may be the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:18- :">2 Corinthians 12:18- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>convenient time</b>—Apollos
	did return to Corinth when their divisions were moderated [JEROME],
	and so it was a more seasonable time.</p>
