<p><b>the Lord</b>—who ought to
	be "loved" above Paul, Apollos, and all other teachers.
	Love to one another is to be in connection with love to Him above
	all. IGNATIUS [<i>Epistle
	to the Romans,</i> 7] writes of Christ, "My love, has been
	crucified" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+2:7">Song of Solomon 2:7</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>Jesus Christ</b>—omitted in
	the oldest manuscripts. 
	</p>
<p><b>let him be Anathema</b>—<i>accursed</i>
	with that curse which the Jews who call Jesus "accursed"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>) are bringing
	righteously on their own heads [BENGEL].
	So far from "saluting" him, I bid him be <i>accursed.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Maranatha</b>—<i>Syriac</i>
	for, "the Lord cometh." A motto or watchword to urge them
	to preparedness for the Lord's coming; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3- :">1 Corinthians 12:3- :</span>, "The Lord is at hand."</p>
