<p><b>3. approve by your letters</b>—rather
	translate, "Whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send <i>with</i>
	letters": namely, letters to several persons at Jerusalem, which
	would be their credentials. There could be no need of letters <i>from
	them</i> before Paul's coming, if the persons recommended were <i>not
	to be sent off before it.</i> Literally, "by letters"; an
	abbreviated expression for "I will send, recommending them by
	letters" [GROTIUS].
	If <i>English Version</i> be retained, the sense will be, "When
	I come, I will send those whom by your letters, <i>then to be given
	them,</i> ye shall approve." But the antithesis (opposition or
	contrast) to Paul himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) favors GROTIUS'
	view. So "by" means <i>with</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); and the <i>Greek</i> for "by" is translated,
	<i>with</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:4">2 Corinthians 2:4</span>).

<p><b>liberality</b>—literally,
	<i>gracious</i> or <i>free gift</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:4- :">2 Corinthians 2:4- :</span>).</p>
