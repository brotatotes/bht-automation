3. approve by your letters—rather
	translate, "Whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with
	letters": namely, letters to several persons at Jerusalem, which
	would be their credentials. There could be no need of letters from
	them before Paul's coming, if the persons recommended were not
	to be sent off before it. Literally, "by letters"; an
	abbreviated expression for "I will send, recommending them by
	letters" [GROTIUS].
	If English Version be retained, the sense will be, "When
	I come, I will send those whom by your letters, then to be given
	them, ye shall approve." But the antithesis (opposition or
	contrast) to Paul himself ( :-) favors GROTIUS'
	view. So "by" means with ( :-); and the Greek for "by" is translated,
	with (2 Corinthians 2:4). 
	liberality—literally,
	gracious or free gift (2 Corinthians 2:4- :).
