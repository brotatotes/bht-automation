<p><b>5-7.</b> His first intention had
	been (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15">2 Corinthians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:16">2 Corinthians 1:16</span>)
	to pass through them (Corinth) to Macedonia, and again return to them
	from Macedonia, and so to Judea; this he had announced in the lost
	epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span>); now having
	laid aside this intention (for which he was charged with levity, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9- :">1 Corinthians 5:9- :</span>, c., whereas it was through lenity, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:23">2 Corinthians 1:23</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:1">2 Corinthians 2:1</span>), he announces his second
	plan of "not seeing them now by the way," but "passing
	through Macedonia" first on his way to them, and then "tarrying
	a while," and even "abiding and wintering with them." 
	</p>
<p><b>for I do pass</b>â€”as much
	as to say, "This is what I at last <i>resolve upon</i>"
	(not as the erroneous subscription of the Epistle represents it, as
	if he was THEN at
	Philippi, <i>on his way through</i> Macedonia); implying that there
	had been some previous communication upon the subject of the journey,
	and also that there had been some indecisiveness in the apostle's
	plan [PALEY]. In
	accordance with his second plan, we find him in Macedonia when Second
	Corinthians was written (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13">2 Corinthians 2:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:1">2 Corinthians 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:2">2 Corinthians 9:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:4">2 Corinthians 9:4</span>), and on his way to
	Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1">2 Corinthians 13:1</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:1">Acts 20:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2">Acts 20:2</span>).
	"Pass through" is opposed to "abide" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2- :">Acts 20:2- :</span>). He was <i>not yet</i> in Macedonia (as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2- :">Acts 20:2- :</span> shows), but at Ephesus; but he was <i>thinking</i> of
	<i>passing through</i> it (not <i>abiding</i> as he purposed to do at
	Corinth).</p>
