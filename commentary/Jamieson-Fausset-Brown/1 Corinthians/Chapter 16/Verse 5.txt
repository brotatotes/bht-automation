5-7. His first intention had
	been (2 Corinthians 1:15; 2 Corinthians 1:16)
	to pass through them (Corinth) to Macedonia, and again return to them
	from Macedonia, and so to Judea; this he had announced in the lost
	epistle (1 Corinthians 5:9); now having
	laid aside this intention (for which he was charged with levity, 1 Corinthians 5:9- :, c., whereas it was through lenity, 2 Corinthians 1:23
2 Corinthians 2:1), he announces his second
	plan of "not seeing them now by the way," but "passing
	through Macedonia" first on his way to them, and then "tarrying
	a while," and even "abiding and wintering with them." 
	for I do passâ€”as much
	as to say, "This is what I at last resolve upon"
	(not as the erroneous subscription of the Epistle represents it, as
	if he was THEN at
	Philippi, on his way through Macedonia); implying that there
	had been some previous communication upon the subject of the journey,
	and also that there had been some indecisiveness in the apostle's
	plan [PALEY]. In
	accordance with his second plan, we find him in Macedonia when Second
	Corinthians was written (2 Corinthians 2:13;
	2 Corinthians 8:1; 2 Corinthians 9:2;
	2 Corinthians 9:4), and on his way to
	Corinth (2 Corinthians 12:14; 2 Corinthians 13:1;
	compare Acts 20:1; Acts 20:2).
	"Pass through" is opposed to "abide" (Acts 20:2- :). He was not yet in Macedonia (as Acts 20:2- : shows), but at Ephesus; but he was thinking of
	passing through it (not abiding as he purposed to do at
	Corinth).
