<p><b>8. at Ephesus</b>—whence Paul
	writes this Epistle. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Asia," wherein Ephesus was. 
	</p>
<p><b>until Pentecost</b>—He
	seems to have stayed as he here purposes: for just when the tumult
	which drove him away broke out, he was already intending to leave
	Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>).
	Combined with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:8">1 Corinthians 5:8</span>,
	this verse fixes the date of this Epistle to a few weeks before
	Pentecost, and very soon after the Passover.</p>
