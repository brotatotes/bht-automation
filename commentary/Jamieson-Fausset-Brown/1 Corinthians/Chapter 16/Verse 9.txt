<p><b>9. door</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). An <i>opening</i> for the extension of the Gospel. Wise
	men are on the watch for, and avail themselves of, <i>opportunities.</i>
	So "<i>door</i> of hope," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. "Door of faith," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. "An open door," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. "A door of utterance," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. "Great," that is, extensive. "Effectual,"
	that is, <i>requiring great labors</i> [ESTIUS];
	or <i>opportune for effecting great results</i> [BEZA].

<p><b>many adversaries</b>—who
	would block up the way and prevent us from entering the open door.
	Not here false teachers, but open adversaries: both Jews and heathen.
	After Paul, by his now long-continued labors at Ephesus, had produced
	effects which threatened the interests of those whose gains were
	derived from idolatry, "many adversaries" arose (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Where great good is, there evil is sure to start up as
	its antagonist.</p>
