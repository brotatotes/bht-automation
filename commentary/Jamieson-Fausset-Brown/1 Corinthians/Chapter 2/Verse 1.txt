1. And I—"So I"
	[CONYBEARE] as one of the
	"foolish, weak, and despised" instruments employed by God
	(1 Corinthians 1:27; 1 Corinthians 1:28);
	"glorying in the Lord," not in man's wisdom (1 Corinthians 1:28- :). Compare 1 Corinthians 1:23,
	"We." 
	when I came— (1 Corinthians 1:23- :, c.). Paul might, had he pleased, have used an ornate style,
	having studied secular learning at Tarsus of Cilicia, which STRABO
	preferred as a school of learning to Athens or Alexandria here,
	doubtless, he read the Cilician Aratus' poems (which he
	quotes, Acts 17:28), and
	Epimenides (Titus 1:12), and
	Menander (1 Corinthians 15:33). Grecian
	intellectual development was an important element in preparing the
	way for the Gospel, but it failed to regenerate the world, showing
	that for this a superhuman power is needed. Hellenistic (Grecizing)
	Judaism at Tarsus and Alexandria was the connecting link between the
	schools of Athens and those of the Rabbis. No more fitting birthplace
	could there have been for the apostle of the Gentiles than Tarsus,
	free as it was from the warping influences of Rome, Alexandria, and
	Athens. He had at the same time Roman citizenship, which
	protected him from sudden violence. Again, he was reared in the
	Hebrew divine law at Jerusalem. Thus, as the three elements,
	Greek cultivation, Roman polity (1 Corinthians 15:33- :), and the divine law given to the Jews, combined just at
	Christ's time, to prepare the world for the Gospel, so the same
	three, by God's marvellous providence, met together in the apostle to
	the Gentiles [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON]. 
	testimony of God—"the
	testimony of Christ" (1 Corinthians 15:33- :); therefore Christ is God.
