11. what man, &c.—literally,
	"who of men knoweth the things of a man, save the
	spirit of that man?" 
	things of God knoweth no
	man—rather, "none knoweth," not angel or man.
	This proves the impossibility of any knowing the things of God, save
	by the Spirit of God (who alone knows them, since even in the case of
	man, so infinitely inferior in mind to God, none of his fellow men,
	but his own spirit alone knows the things hidden within him).
