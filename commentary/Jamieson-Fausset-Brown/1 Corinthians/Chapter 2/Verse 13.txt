<p><b>comparing spiritual things

	Scripture, by comparison with the Gospel which Jesus by the same
	Spirit revealed [GROTIUS];
	and conversely illustrating the Gospel mysteries by comparing them
	with the Old Testament types [CHRYSOSTOM].
	So the <i>Greek</i> word is translated, "comparing" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). WAHL (<i>Key
	of the New Testament</i>) translates, "<i>explaining</i> (as the
	<i>Greek</i> is translated, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+40:8">Genesis 40:8</span>,
	the <i>Septuagint</i>) to spiritual (that is, Spirit-taught) men,
	spiritual things (the things which we ourselves are taught by the
	Spirit)." Spirit-taught men alone can comprehend spiritual
	truths. This accords with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:9">1 Corinthians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:1">1 Corinthians 3:1</span>. ALFORD
	translates, "Putting together (combining) spirituals with
	spirituals"; that is, attaching spiritual <i>words</i> to
	spiritual <i>things,</i> which we should not do, if we were to use
	words of worldly wisdom to expound spiritual things (so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>).
	Perhaps the generality of the neuters is designed to comprehend these
	several notions by implication. Comparing, or combining, spirituals
	with spirituals; implying both that spiritual things are only suited
	to spiritual persons (so "things" comprehended <i>persons,</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:27">1 Corinthians 1:27</span>), and also that
	spiritual truths can only be combined with spiritual (not
	worldly-wise) words; and lastly, spirituals of the Old and New
	Testaments can only be understood by mutual comparison or
	combination, not by combination with worldly "wisdom," or
	natural perceptions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:21">1 Corinthians 1:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:22">1 Corinthians 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</span>;
