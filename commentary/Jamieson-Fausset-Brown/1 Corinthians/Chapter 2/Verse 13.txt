13. also—We not only know
	by the Holy Ghost, but we also speak the "things freely
	given to us of God" ( :-). 
	which the Holy Ghost
	teacheth—The old manuscripts read "the Spirit"
	simply, without "Holy." 
	comparing spiritual things
	with spiritual—expounding the Spirit-inspired Old Testament
	Scripture, by comparison with the Gospel which Jesus by the same
	Spirit revealed [GROTIUS];
	and conversely illustrating the Gospel mysteries by comparing them
	with the Old Testament types [CHRYSOSTOM].
	So the Greek word is translated, "comparing" ( :-). WAHL (Key
	of the New Testament) translates, "explaining (as the
	Greek is translated, Genesis 40:8,
	the Septuagint) to spiritual (that is, Spirit-taught) men,
	spiritual things (the things which we ourselves are taught by the
	Spirit)." Spirit-taught men alone can comprehend spiritual
	truths. This accords with 1 Corinthians 2:6;
	1 Corinthians 2:9; 1 Corinthians 2:10;
	1 Corinthians 2:14; 1 Corinthians 2:15;
	1 Corinthians 3:1. ALFORD
	translates, "Putting together (combining) spirituals with
	spirituals"; that is, attaching spiritual words to
	spiritual things, which we should not do, if we were to use
	words of worldly wisdom to expound spiritual things (so 1 Corinthians 2:1;
	1 Corinthians 2:4; 1 Peter 4:11).
	Perhaps the generality of the neuters is designed to comprehend these
	several notions by implication. Comparing, or combining, spirituals
	with spirituals; implying both that spiritual things are only suited
	to spiritual persons (so "things" comprehended persons,
1 Corinthians 1:27), and also that
	spiritual truths can only be combined with spiritual (not
	worldly-wise) words; and lastly, spirituals of the Old and New
	Testaments can only be understood by mutual comparison or
	combination, not by combination with worldly "wisdom," or
	natural perceptions (1 Corinthians 1:21;
	1 Corinthians 1:22; 1 Corinthians 2:1;
	1 Corinthians 2:4-9; compare 1 Corinthians 2:4-46.2.9- :).
