<p><b>14. natural man</b>—literally, "a
	man of animal soul." As contrasted with the <i>spiritual</i>
	man, he is governed by the animal soul, which overbears his <i>spirit,</i>
	which latter is without the Spirit of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). So the <i>animal</i> (<i>English Version,</i> "natural")
	body, or body led by the lower animal nature (including both the mere
	human fallen <i>reason</i> and <i>heart</i>), is contrasted with the
	Spirit-quickened body (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The <i>carnal</i> man (the man led by bodily
	appetites, and also by a self-exalting spirit, estranged from the
	divine life) is closely akin; so too the "earthly."
	"Devilish," or "demon-like"; "led by an evil
	spirit," is the awful character of such a one, in its worst type
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:15">James 3:15</span>).

<p><b>receiveth not</b>—though
	they are offered to him, and are "worthy of being <i>received</i>
	by all men" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>they are foolishness unto
	him</b>—whereas he seeks "wisdom" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15- :">1 Timothy 1:15- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>neither can he</b>—Not only
	<i>does</i> he not, but he <i>cannot</i> know them, and therefore has
	no wish to "receive" them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15- :">1 Timothy 1:15- :</span>).</p>
