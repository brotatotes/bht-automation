15. He that is spiritual—literally,
	"the spiritual (man)." In  :-, it is "A [not 'the,' as English
	Version] natural man." The spiritual is the
	man distinguished above his fellow men, as he in whom the Spirit
	rules. In the unregenerate, the spirit which ought to be the organ of
	the Holy Spirit (and which is so in the regenerate), is overridden by
	the animal soul, and is in abeyance, so that such a one is never
	called "spiritual." 
	judgeth all things—and
	persons, by their true standard (compare 1 Corinthians 6:2-4;
	1 John 4:1), in so far as he is
	spiritual. "Discerneth . . . is discerned," would better
	accord with the translation of the same Greek (1 John 4:1- :). Otherwise for "discerned," in 1 John 4:1- :, translate, "judged of," to accord with the
	translation, "judgeth . . . is judged" in this fifteenth
	verse. He has a practical insight into the verities of the Gospel,
	though he is not infallible on all theoretical points. If an
	individual may have the Spirit without being infallible, why may not
	the Church have the Spirit, and yet not be infallible (a refutation
	of the plea of Rome for the Church's infallibility, from Matthew 28:20;
	John 16:13)? As the believer and
	the Church have the Spirit, and are yet not therefore impeccable, so
	he and the Church have the Spirit, and yet are not infallible or
	impeccable. He and the Church are both infallible and impeccable,
	only in proportion to the degree in which they are led by the
	Spirit. The Spirit leads into all truth and holiness; but His
	influence on believers and on the Church is as yet partial. Jesus
	alone, who had the Spirit without measure (John 16:13- :), is both infallible and impeccable. Scripture, because it
	was written by men, who while writing were infallibly inspired, is
	unmixed truth (Proverbs 28:5; 1 John 2:27).
