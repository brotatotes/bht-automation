<p><b>16. For</b>—proof of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, that the spiritual man "is judged of no man." In
	order to judge the spiritual man, the ordinary man must "know
	the mind of the Lord." But "who of ordinary men knows"

<p><b>that he may instruct him</b>—that

	So the <i>Septuagint</i> translates the <i>Greek</i> verb, which
	means to "prove," in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:14- :">Isaiah 40:14- :</span>. Natural men who judge spiritual men, living according to
	the mind of God ("We have the mind of Christ"), are
	virtually wishing to instruct God, and bring Him to another mind, as
	counsellors setting to right their king.

<p><b>we have the mind of Christ</b>—in
	our degree of capability to apprehend it. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:13">Isaiah 40:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:14">Isaiah 40:14</span> refers to JEHOVAH:
	therefore, as it is applied here to <i>Christ,</i> He is Jehovah.</p>
