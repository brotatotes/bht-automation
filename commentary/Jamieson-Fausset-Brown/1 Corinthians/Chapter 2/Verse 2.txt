2. The Greek implies,
	"The only definite thing that I made it my business to know
	among you, was to know Jesus Christ (His person) and Him crucified
	(His office)" [ALFORD],
	not exalted on the earthly throne of David, but executed as the
	vilest malefactor. The historical fact of Christ's crucifixion had
	probably been put less prominently forward by the seekers after human
	wisdom in the Corinthian church, to avoid offending learned heathens
	and Jews. Christ's person and Christ's office
	constitute the sum of the Gospel.
