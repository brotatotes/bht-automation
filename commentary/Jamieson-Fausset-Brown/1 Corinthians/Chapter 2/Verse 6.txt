<p><b>we speak</b>—resuming "we"
	(preachers, I, Apollos, c.) from "we preach" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), only that here, "we speak" refers to something

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:2">1 Corinthians 3:2</span>), and cannot therefore

	Paul does not mean by the "mystery" or "hidden wisdom"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>) some <i>hidden
	tradition distinct from the Gospel</i> (like the Church of Rome's
	<i>disciplina arcani</i> and doctrine of reserve), but the <i>unfolding</i>
	of the treasures of knowledge, once hidden in God's counsels, but <i>now</i>
	announced to all, which would be intelligently comprehended in
	proportion as the hearer's inner life became perfectly transformed
	into the image of Christ. Compare instances of such "mysteries,"
	that is, deeper Christian truths, not preached at Paul's first coming
	to Corinth, when he confined himself to the fundamental elements (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7- :">1 Corinthians 2:7- :</span>), but now spoken to the "perfect" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>;
