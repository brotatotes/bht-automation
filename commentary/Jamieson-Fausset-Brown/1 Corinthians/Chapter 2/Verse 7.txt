<p><b>7. wisdom of God</b>—emphatically
	contrasted with the wisdom <i>of men</i> and <i>of this world</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:5">1 Corinthians 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>in a mystery</b>—connected
	in construction with "we speak": We speak as dealing with a
	mystery; that is not something <i>to be kept hidden,</i> but what
	heretofore was so, but is <i>now revealed.</i> Whereas the pagan
	mysteries were revealed only to a chosen few, the Gospel mysteries
	were made known to all who would obey the truth. "If our Gospel
	be <i>hid,</i> it is hid to them that are <i>lost</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6- :">1 Corinthians 2:6- :</span>), "whom the God of this world hath <i>blinded.</i>"
	Ordinarily we use "mystery" in reference to those from whom
	the knowledge is <i>withheld;</i> the apostles, in reference to those
	to whom it is <i>revealed</i> [WHATELY].
	It is hidden before it is brought forward, and when it is brought
	forward it still remains hidden to those that are imperfect [BENGEL].

<p><b>ordained</b>—literally,
	"foreordained" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6- :">1 Corinthians 2:6- :</span>), "prepared for them that love Him." 
	</p>
<p><b>before the world</b>—rather,
	"before <i>the ages</i>" (of time), that is, from eternity.
	This infinitely antedates worldly wisdom in antiquity. It was before
	not only the wisdom of the world, but eternally before the world
	itself and its ages. 
	</p>
<p><b>to our glory</b>—ours both
	now and hereafter, from "the Lord of <i>glory</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6- :">1 Corinthians 2:6- :</span>), who <i>brings to naught</i> "the princes of this
	world."</p>
