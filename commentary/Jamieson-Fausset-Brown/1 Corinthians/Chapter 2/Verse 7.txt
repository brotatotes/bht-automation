7. wisdom of God—emphatically
	contrasted with the wisdom of men and of this world
	(1 Corinthians 2:5; 1 Corinthians 2:6).
	in a mystery—connected
	in construction with "we speak": We speak as dealing with a
	mystery; that is not something to be kept hidden, but what
	heretofore was so, but is now revealed. Whereas the pagan
	mysteries were revealed only to a chosen few, the Gospel mysteries
	were made known to all who would obey the truth. "If our Gospel
	be hid, it is hid to them that are lost" (1 Corinthians 2:6- :), "whom the God of this world hath blinded."
	Ordinarily we use "mystery" in reference to those from whom
	the knowledge is withheld; the apostles, in reference to those
	to whom it is revealed [WHATELY].
	It is hidden before it is brought forward, and when it is brought
	forward it still remains hidden to those that are imperfect [BENGEL].
	ordained—literally,
	"foreordained" (compare 1 Corinthians 2:6- :), "prepared for them that love Him." 
	before the world—rather,
	"before the ages" (of time), that is, from eternity.
	This infinitely antedates worldly wisdom in antiquity. It was before
	not only the wisdom of the world, but eternally before the world
	itself and its ages. 
	to our glory—ours both
	now and hereafter, from "the Lord of glory" (1 Corinthians 2:6- :), who brings to naught "the princes of this
	world."
