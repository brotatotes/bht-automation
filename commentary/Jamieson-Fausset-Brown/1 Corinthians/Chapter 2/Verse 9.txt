	c.—ALFORD translates,
	"The things which eye saw not . . . the things which God
	prepared . . . to us God revealed through His Spirit." Thus,
	however, the "but" of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> is ignored. Rather construe, as ESTIUS,
	"('We speak,' supplied from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), things which eye saw not (heretofore), . . . things which
	God prepared . . . But God revealed them to us," &amp;c. The
	quotation is not a verbatim one, but an inspired <i>exposition</i> of
	the "wisdom" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6">1 Corinthians 2:6</span>,
	from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+64:4">Isaiah 64:4</span>). The exceptive
	words, "O God, <i>beside</i> (that is, except) Thee," are
	not quoted directly, but are virtually expressed in the exposition of
	them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>), "None <i>but
	thou,</i> O God, seest these mysteries, and <i>God hath revealed them
	to us by His Spirit.</i>"

In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10- :">1 Corinthians 2:10- :</span> it is "Prepared (literally, 'will do') for him that
	<i>waiteth for</i> Him" here, "for them that <i>love</i>
	Him." For Isaiah spake to them who <i>waited for</i> Messiah's
	appearance as future; Paul, to them <i>who love Him</i> as having
	actually appeared (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:19">1 John 4:19</span>);
