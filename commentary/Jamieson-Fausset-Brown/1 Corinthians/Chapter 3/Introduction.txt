<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. PAUL COULD
	NOT SPEAK
	TO THEM OF DEEP
	SPIRITUAL TRUTHS,
	AS THEY WERE
	CARNAL, CONTENDING
	FOR THEIR SEVERAL
	TEACHERS; THESE
	ARE NOTHING
	BUT WORKERS FOR
	GOD, TO WHOM
	THEY MUST
	GIVE ACCOUNT
	IN THE DAY OF FIERY
	JUDGMENT. THE
	HEARERS ARE
	GOD'S TEMPLE,
	WHICH THEY
	MUST NOT
	DEFILE BY CONTENTIONS
	FOR TEACHERS, WHO,
	AS WELL AS ALL
	THINGS, ARE
	THEIRS, BEING
	CHRIST'S.</p>
