1. And I—that is, as the
	natural (animal) man cannot receive, so I also could not speak
	unto you the deep things of God, as I would to the
	spiritual; but I was compelled to speak to you as I would

	or natural. Carnal, or fleshly, implies not they were
	wholly natural or unregenerate ( :-), but that they had much of a carnal tendency; for
	example their divisions. Paul had to speak to them as he would to men

	babes—contrasted with
	the perfect (fully matured) in Christ ( :-; compare Hebrews 5:13;
	Hebrews 5:14). This implies they were

	1 Corinthians 1:7; therefore he says as)
	babes in Christ, when by this time they ought to have "come
	unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
	Christ" (Ephesians 4:13). In Ephesians 4:13- :, also the oldest manuscripts read, "I am a man of
	flesh."
