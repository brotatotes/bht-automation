<p><b>1. And I</b>—that is, as the
	natural (animal) man cannot receive, so <i>I also could not speak
	unto you</i> the deep things of God, <i>as</i> I would <i>to the
	spiritual; but</i> I was compelled to speak to you <i>as</i> I would
	<i>to</i> MEN OF FLESH.
	The oldest manuscripts read this for "carnal." The former
	(literally, "fleshy") implies men wholly <i>of flesh,</i>
	or <i>natural. Carnal,</i> or <i>fleshly,</i> implies not they were
	<i>wholly natural</i> or unregenerate (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), but that they had much of a <i>carnal tendency;</i> for
	example their divisions. Paul had to speak to them as he would to men
	<i>wholly natural,</i> inasmuch as they are <i>still carnal</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) in many respects, notwithstanding their conversion (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>babes</b>—contrasted with
	the <i>perfect</i> (fully matured) <i>in Christ</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:13">Hebrews 5:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:14">Hebrews 5:14</span>). This implies they were
	not men wholly <i>of flesh,</i> though carnal in tendencies. They had
	life in Christ, but it was weak. He blames them for being still in a
	degree (not <i>altogether,</i> compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:5">1 Corinthians 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>; therefore he says <i>as</i>)
	<i>babes</i> in Christ, when by this time they ought to have "come
	unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
	Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13- :">Ephesians 4:13- :</span>, also the oldest manuscripts read, "I am a man <i>of
	flesh.</i>"</p>
