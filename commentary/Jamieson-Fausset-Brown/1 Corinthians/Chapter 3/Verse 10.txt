10. grace . . . given unto me—Paul
	puts this first, to guard against seeming to want humility, in
	pronouncing himself "a WISE
	master builder," in the clause following [CHRYSOSTOM].
	The "grace" is that "given" to him in common with
	all Christians (1 Corinthians 3:5), only
	proportioned to the work which God had for him to do [ALFORD].
	wise—that is, skilful.
	His skill is shown in his laying a foundation. The
	unskilful builder lays none (1 Corinthians 3:5- :). Christ is the foundation (1 Corinthians 3:5- :). 
	another—who ever comes
	after me. He does not name Apollos; for he speaks generally of
	all successors, whoever they be. His warning, "Let every
	man (every teacher) take heed how," c., refers to other
	successors rather than Apollos, who doubtless did not, as they, build
	wood, hay, &c., on the foundation (compare 1 Corinthians 3:5- :). "I have done my part, let them who follow me see (so
	the Greek for 'take heed') to theirs" [BENGEL].
	how—with what material
	[ALFORD]. How far wisely,
	and in builder-like style (1 Corinthians 3:5- :). 
	buildeth thereupon—Here
	the building or superstructure raised on Christ
	the "foundation," laid by Paul (1 Corinthians 3:5- :) is not, as in Ephesians 2:20
Ephesians 2:21, the Christian Church
	made up of believers, the "lively stones" (Ephesians 2:21- :), but the doctrinal and practical teaching which the
	teachers who succeeded Paul, superadded to his first teaching; not
	that they taught what was false, but their teaching was subtle and
	speculative reasoning, rather than solid and simple truth.
