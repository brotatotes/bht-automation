<p><b>10. grace . . . given unto me</b>—Paul
	puts this first, to guard against seeming to want humility, in
	pronouncing himself "a WISE
	master builder," in the clause following [CHRYSOSTOM].
	The "grace" is that "given" to him in common with
	all Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5">1 Corinthians 3:5</span>), only
	proportioned to the work which God had for him to do [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>wise</b>—that is, skilful.
	His <i>skill</i> is shown in his <i>laying a foundation.</i> The
	unskilful builder lays none (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5- :">1 Corinthians 3:5- :</span>). Christ is the foundation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5- :">1 Corinthians 3:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>another</b>—who ever comes
	after me. He does not name <i>Apollos;</i> for he speaks generally of
	<i>all successors,</i> whoever they be. His warning, "Let every
	man (every <i>teacher</i>) take heed how," c., refers to other
	successors rather than Apollos, who doubtless did not, as they, build
	wood, hay, &amp;c., on the foundation (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5- :">1 Corinthians 3:5- :</span>). "I have done my part, let them who follow me see (so
	the <i>Greek</i> for 'take heed') to theirs" [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>how</b>—with what material
	[ALFORD]. How far <i>wisely,</i>
	and in builder-like style (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5- :">1 Corinthians 3:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>buildeth thereupon</b>—Here
	the <i>building</i> or <i>superstructure</i> raised <i>on</i> Christ
	the "foundation," laid by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:5- :">1 Corinthians 3:5- :</span>) is not, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span>, the Christian Church
	made up of believers, the "lively stones" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21- :">Ephesians 2:21- :</span>), but <i>the doctrinal and practical teaching</i> which the
	teachers who succeeded Paul, superadded to his first teaching; not
	that they taught what was false, but their teaching was subtle and
	speculative reasoning, rather than solid and simple truth.</p>
