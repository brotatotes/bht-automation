<p><b>12. Now</b>â€”rather, "But."
	The image is that of a building on a solid foundation, and partly
	composed of durable and precious, partly of perishable, materials.
	The "gold, silver, precious stones," which all can
	withstand fire (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:18">Revelation 21:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:19">Revelation 21:19</span>), are <i>teachings</i>
	that will stand the fiery test of judgment; "wood, hay,
	stubble," are those which cannot stand it; not positive heresy,
	for that would destroy the foundation, but teaching mixed up with
	human philosophy and Judaism, curious rather than useful. Besides the
	<i>teachings,</i> the superstructure represents also the <i>persons</i>
	cemented to the Church by them, the reality of whose conversion,
	through the teachers' instrumentality, will be tested at the last
	day. Where there is the least grain of real gold of faith, it shall
	never be lost (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>; compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>). On the other hand,
	the lightest straw feeds the fire [BENGEL]
