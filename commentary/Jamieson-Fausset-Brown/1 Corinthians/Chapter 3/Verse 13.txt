	The <i>fire</i> (probably <i>figurative</i> here, as the <i>gold,
	hay,</i> c.) is not <i>purgatory</i> (as Rome teaches, that is,
	<i>purificatory</i> and <i>punitive</i>), but <i>probatory,</i> not
	restricted to those dying in "venial sin" the supposed
	<i>intermediate class</i> between those entering heaven at once, and
	those dying in mortal sin who go to hell, but <i>universal,</i>
	testing the godly and ungodly alike (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:1- :">Malachi 4:1- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:49">Mark 9:49</span>).
	This fire is not till the <i>last</i> day, the supposed fire of
	purgatory begins <i>at death.</i> The fire of Paul is to try the
	<i>works,</i> the fire of purgatory the <i>persons,</i> of men.
	Paul's fire causes "loss" to the sufferers; Rome's
	purgatory, great gain, namely, heaven at last to those purged by it,
	if only it were true. Thus this passage, quoted by Rome for, is
	altogether against, purgatory. "It was not this doctrine that
	gave rise to prayers for the dead; but the practice of praying for
	the dead [which crept in from the affectionate but mistaken
	solicitude of survivors] gave rise to the doctrine" [WHATELY].</p>
