16. Know ye not—It is no new
	thing I tell you, in calling you "God's building"; ye know
	and ought to remember, ye are the noblest kind of building, "the
	temple of God." 
	ye—all Christians form
	together one vast temple. The expression is not, "ye are
	temples," but "ye are the temple"
	collectively, and "lively stones" ( :-) individually. 
	God . . . Spirit—God's
	indwelling, and that of the Holy Spirit, are one; therefore the Holy
	Spirit is God. No literal "temple" is recognized by the New
	Testament in the Christian Church. The only one is the spiritual
	temple, the whole body of believing worshippers in which the Holy
	Spirit dwells (1 Corinthians 6:19; John 4:23;
	John 4:24). The synagogue,
	not the temple, was the model of the Christian house of worship. The
	temple was the house of sacrifice, rather than of prayer.
	Prayers in the temple were silent and individual (Luke 1:10;
	Luke 18:10-13), not joint
	and public, nor with reading of Scripture, as in the synagogue. The
	temple, as the name means (from a Greek root "to dwell"),
	was the earthly dwelling-place of God, where alone He put His
	name. The synagogue (as the name means an assembly) was the
	place for assembling men. God now too has His earthly temple, not one
	of wood and stone, but the congregation of believers, the "living
	stones" on the "spiritual house." Believers are all
	spiritual priests in it. Jesus Christ, our High Priest, has the only
	literal priesthood (Malachi 1:11;
	Matthew 18:20; 1 Peter 2:5)
