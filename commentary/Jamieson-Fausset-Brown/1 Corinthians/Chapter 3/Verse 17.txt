<p><b>17. If any . . . defile . . .
	destroy</b>—rather as the <i>Greek</i> verb is the same in both
	cases, "<i>destroy</i> . . . destroy." God repays in kind
	by a righteous retaliation. The destroyer shall himself be destroyed.
	As temporal death was the penalty of marring the material temple
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:2">Leviticus 16:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+5:2">Daniel 5:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+5:3">Daniel 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+5:30">Daniel 5:30</span>),
	so eternal death is the penalty of marring the spiritual temple—the
	Church. The <i>destroyers</i> here (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:16">1 Corinthians 3:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:17">1 Corinthians 3:17</span>), are distinct from the
	<i>unwise</i> or unskilful builders (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:12">1 Corinthians 3:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:15">1 Corinthians 3:15</span>); the latter held fast
	the "foundation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:15- :">1 Corinthians 3:15- :</span>), and, therefore, though they lose their work of
	superstructure and the special reward, yet they are themselves saved;
	the destroyers, on the contrary, assailed with false teaching the
	foundation, and so subvert the temple itself, and shall therefore be
	destroyed. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:10">1 Corinthians 3:10</span>),
	[ESTIUS and NEANDER].
	I think Paul passes here from the teachers to all the members of the
	Church, who, by profession, are "priests unto God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:6">Revelation 1:6</span>).
	As the Aaronic priests were doomed to die if they violated the old
	temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:43">Exodus 28:43</span>), so any
	Christian who violates the sanctity of the spiritual temple, shall
	perish eternally (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:31">Hebrews 10:31</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>holy</b>—inviolable (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:31- :">Hebrews 10:31- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>which </b><i><b>temple</b></i><b>
	ye are</b>—rather, "the which (that is, holy) are ye"
	[ALFORD], and, therefore,
	want of holiness on the part of any of you (or, as ESTIUS,
	"to tamper with <i>the foundation</i> in <i>teaching</i> you")
	is a violation of the temple, which cannot be let to pass with
	impunity. GROTIUS supports
	<i>English Version.</i></p>
