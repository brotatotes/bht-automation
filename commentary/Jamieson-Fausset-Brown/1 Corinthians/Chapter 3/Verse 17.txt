17. If any . . . defile . . .
	destroy—rather as the Greek verb is the same in both
	cases, "destroy . . . destroy." God repays in kind
	by a righteous retaliation. The destroyer shall himself be destroyed.
	As temporal death was the penalty of marring the material temple
	(Leviticus 16:2; Daniel 5:2;
	Daniel 5:3; Daniel 5:30),
	so eternal death is the penalty of marring the spiritual temple—the
	Church. The destroyers here (1 Corinthians 3:16;
	1 Corinthians 3:17), are distinct from the
	unwise or unskilful builders (1 Corinthians 3:12;
	1 Corinthians 3:15); the latter held fast
	the "foundation" (1 Corinthians 3:15- :), and, therefore, though they lose their work of
	superstructure and the special reward, yet they are themselves saved;
	the destroyers, on the contrary, assailed with false teaching the
	foundation, and so subvert the temple itself, and shall therefore be
	destroyed. (See on 1 Corinthians 3:10),
	[ESTIUS and NEANDER].
	I think Paul passes here from the teachers to all the members of the
	Church, who, by profession, are "priests unto God" (Exodus 19:6;
	1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6).
	As the Aaronic priests were doomed to die if they violated the old
	temple (Exodus 28:43), so any
	Christian who violates the sanctity of the spiritual temple, shall
	perish eternally (Hebrews 12:14;
	Hebrews 10:26; Hebrews 10:31).
	holy—inviolable (Hebrews 10:31- :). 
	which temple
	ye are—rather, "the which (that is, holy) are ye"
	[ALFORD], and, therefore,
	want of holiness on the part of any of you (or, as ESTIUS,
	"to tamper with the foundation in teaching you")
	is a violation of the temple, which cannot be let to pass with
	impunity. GROTIUS supports
	English Version.
