<p><b>21. let no man glory in men</b>—resuming
	the subject from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:4">1 Corinthians 3:4</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:31">1 Corinthians 1:31</span>,
	where the true object of glorying is stated: "He that glorieth,
	let him glory in THE LORD."
	Also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span>, "That no one
	of you be puffed up for one against another." 
	</p>
<p><b>For all things</b>—not only
	<i>all men.</i> For you to glory thus in men, is lowering yourselves
	from your high position as heirs of <i>all things.</i> All men
	(including your teachers) belong to Christ, and therefore to you, by
	your union with Him; He makes them and all things work together for
	your good (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>). Ye are not
	for the sake of them, but they for the sake of you (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:5">2 Corinthians 4:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:15">2 Corinthians 4:15</span>). They belong to you,
	not you to them.</p>
