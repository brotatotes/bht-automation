21. let no man glory in men—resuming
	the subject from 1 Corinthians 3:4;
	compare 1 Corinthians 1:12; 1 Corinthians 1:31,
	where the true object of glorying is stated: "He that glorieth,
	let him glory in THE LORD."
	Also 1 Corinthians 4:6, "That no one
	of you be puffed up for one against another." 
	For all things—not only
	all men. For you to glory thus in men, is lowering yourselves
	from your high position as heirs of all things. All men
	(including your teachers) belong to Christ, and therefore to you, by
	your union with Him; He makes them and all things work together for
	your good (Romans 8:28). Ye are not
	for the sake of them, but they for the sake of you (2 Corinthians 4:5;
	2 Corinthians 4:15). They belong to you,
	not you to them.
