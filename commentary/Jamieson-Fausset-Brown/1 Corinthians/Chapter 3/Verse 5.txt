<p><b>5. Who then</b>—Seeing then that
	ye severally strive so for your favorite teachers, "Who is (of
	what intrinsic power and dignity) Paul?" If so great an apostle
	reasons so of himself, how much more does humility, rather than
	self-seeking, become ordinary ministers! 
	</p>
<p><b>Paul . . . Apollos</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read in the reverse order, "Apollos," c.
	Paul." He puts Apollos before himself in humility. 
	</p>
<p><b>but ministers,</b> &amp;c.—The
	oldest manuscripts have no "but." "Who is Apollos . .
	. Paul? (mere) ministers (a lowly word appropriate here, <i>servants</i>),
	by whom (not "<i>in whom</i>" <i>by whose ministrations</i>)
	ye believed." 
	</p>
<p><b>as . . . Lord gave to every
	man</b>—that is, to the several hearers, for it was GOD
	that "gave the increase" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
