6. I . . . planted, Apollos watered—
	(Acts 18:1; Acts 19:1).
	Apollos at his own desire (Acts 19:1- :) was sent by the brethren to Corinth, and there followed up
	the work which Paul had begun. 
	God gave the increase—that
	is, the growth (1 Corinthians 3:10;
	Acts 18:27). "Believed
	through grace." Though ministers are nothing, and God all
	in all, yet God works by instruments, and promises the Holy Spirit in
	the faithful use of means. This is the dispensation of the Spirit,
	and ours is the ministry of the Spirit.
