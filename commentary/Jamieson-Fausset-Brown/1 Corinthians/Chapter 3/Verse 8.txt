<p><b>and every man</b>—rather
	"<i>but</i> every man." Though in their service or
	ministry, they are essentially "one," yet every minister is
	separately responsible in "<i>his own</i>" work, and "shall
	receive <i>his own</i> (emphatically repeated) reward, according to
	<i>his own</i> labor." The <i>reward</i> is something over and
	above personal salvation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:14">1 Corinthians 3:14</span>;

	He shall be rewarded according to, not his success or the amount of
	work done, but "according to his own labor." It shall be
	said to him, "Well done, thou good and (not <i>successful,</i>
	but) <i>faithful</i> servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord"
