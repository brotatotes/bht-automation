1. account . . . us—Paul and
	Apollos. 
	ministers of Christ—not
	heads of the Church in whom ye are severally to glory ( :-); the headship belongs to Christ alone; we are but His
	servants ministering to you (1 Corinthians 1:13;
	1 Corinthians 3:5; 1 Corinthians 3:22).
	stewards— (Luke 12:42;
	1 Peter 4:10). Not the depositories
	of grace, but dispensers of it ("rightly dividing" or
	dispensing it), so far as God gives us it, to others. The
	chazan, or "overseer," in the synagogue answered to
	the bishop or "angel" of the Church, who called
	seven of the synagogue to read the law every sabbath, and oversaw
	them. The parnasin of the synagogue, like the ancient "deacon"
	of the Church, took care of the poor (1 Peter 4:10- :) and subsequently preached in subordination to the
	presbyters or bishops, as Stephen and Philip did. The Church is not
	the appendage to the priesthood; but the minister is the steward of
	God to the Church. Man shrinks from too close contact with God; hence
	he willingly puts a priesthood between, and would serve God by
	deputy. The pagan (like the modern Romish) priest was rather to
	conceal than to explain "the mysteries of God." The
	minister's office is to "preach" (literally, "proclaim
	as a herald," Matthew 10:27)
	the deep truths of God ("mysteries," heavenly truths, only
	known by revelation), so far as they have been revealed, and so far
	as his hearers are disposed to receive them. JOSEPHUS
	says that the Jewish religion made known to all the people the
	mysteries of their religion, while the pagans concealed from all but
	the "initiated" few, the mysteries of theirs.
