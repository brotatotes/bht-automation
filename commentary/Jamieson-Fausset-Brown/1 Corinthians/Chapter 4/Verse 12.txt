	proceedings at <i>Ephesus,</i> from which city he wrote this Epistle
	(though it is expressly stated of him <i>at Corinth,</i> compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:19">Acts 18:19</span>).
	But in his <i>address</i> to the Ephesian elders at Miletus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:19- :">Acts 18:19- :</span>), he says, "Ye yourselves know that these hands have
	ministered unto my necessities," &amp;c. The undesignedness of
	the coincidence thus indirectly brought out is incompatible with
	forgery.</p>
