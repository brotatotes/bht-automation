<p><b>in Christ</b>—Paul admits
	that these "instructors" were not mere legalists, but
	<i>evangelical</i> teachers. He uses, however, a stronger phrase of
	himself in begetting them spiritually, "In Christ Jesus,"
	implying both the Saviour's <i>office and person.</i> As Paul was the
	means of spiritually <i>regenerating</i> them, and yet "baptized
	none of them save Crispus, Gaius, and the household of Stephanas,"
	regeneration cannot be inseparably <i>in</i> and <i>by</i> baptism
