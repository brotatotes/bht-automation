<p><b>sent . . . Timotheus</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10">1 Corinthians 16:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>). "Paul purposed .
	. . when he had passed through Macedonia and <i>Achaia,</i> to go to
	Jerusalem. So he sent into Macedonia Timotheus and Erastus."
	Here it is not expressly said that he sent Timothy into Achaia (of
	which Corinth was the capital), but it is <i>implied,</i> for he sent
	him with Erastus <i>before him.</i> As he therefore purposed to go
	into Achaia himself, there is every probability they were to go
	thither also. They are said only to have been sent into Macedonia,
	because it was the country to which they went immediately from
	Ephesus. The undesignedness of the coincidence establishes the
	genuineness of both the Epistle and the history. In both, Timothy's
	journey is closely connected with Paul's own (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22- :">Acts 19:22- :</span>). Erastus is not specified in the Epistle, probably because
	it was Timothy who was charged with Paul's orders, and possibly
	Erastus was a Corinthian, who, in accompanying Timothy, was only
	returning home. The seeming discrepancy at least shows that the
	passages were not taken from one another [PALEY,
	<i>Horæ Paulinæ</i>].

<p><b>bring you into
	remembrance</b>—Timothy, from his spiritual connection with Paul,
	as converted by him, was best suited to <i>remind</i> them of the
	apostle's walk and teaching (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:2- :">2 Timothy 1:2- :</span>), which they in some respects, though not altogether (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:2- :">2 Timothy 1:2- :</span>), had forgotten.

<p><b>as I teach . . . in every
