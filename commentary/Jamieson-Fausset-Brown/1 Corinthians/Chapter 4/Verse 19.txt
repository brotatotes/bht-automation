	translates, "But come I will"; an emphatical negation of
	their supposition (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:18">1 Corinthians 4:18</span>).

<p><b>if the Lord will</b>—a wise
	proviso (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:15">James 4:15</span>). He does not

	</p>
<p><b>and will know</b>—take
	cognizance of.

	I desire to know is "their power," whether they be really

	godliness, showed itself at Corinth.</p>
