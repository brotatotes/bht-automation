<p><b>2. Moreover</b>â€”The oldest
	manuscripts read, "Moreover here" (that is, on earth). The
	contrast thus is between man's usage as to stewards (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and God's way (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:3">1 Corinthians 4:3</span>).
	Though <i>here</i> below, <i>in the case of stewards, inquiry is
	made, that one man be found</i> (that is, proved to be) faithful; yet
	God's steward awaits no such <i>judgment</i> of man, in man's day,
	but the Lord's judgment in His great day. Another argument against
	the Corinthians for their partial preferences of certain teachers for
	their gifts: whereas what God requires in His stewards is
	<i>faithfulness</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+3:20">1 Samuel 3:20</span>,
	<i>Margin;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:5">Hebrews 3:5</span>); as
	indeed is required in earthly stewards, but with this difference (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:5- :">Hebrews 3:5- :</span>), that God's stewards await not man's judgment to test them,
	but the testing which shall be in the day of the Lord.</p>
