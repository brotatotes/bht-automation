<p><b>3. it is a very small

	not that I despise <i>your</i> judgment, but as compared with God's,
	it almost comes to nothing.

<p><b>judged . . . of man's
	judgment</b>—literally, "man's <i>day,</i>" contrasted
	with the day (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span>) of the
	Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span>).
	"The day of man" is here put before us as a <i>person</i>
	[WAHL]. All days previous
	to the day of the Lord <i>are man's days.</i> EMESTI
	translates the thrice recurring <i>Greek</i> for "judged . . .
	judge . . . judgeth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:4">1 Corinthians 4:4</span>),
	thus: To me for my part (though capable of being found faithful) it
	is a very small matter that I should <i>be approved of</i> by man's
	judgment; yea, I do not even <i>assume the right of judgment and
	approving</i> myself—but He that <i>has the right, and is able to</i>
	judge on my case (the Dijudicator), is the Lord.</p>
