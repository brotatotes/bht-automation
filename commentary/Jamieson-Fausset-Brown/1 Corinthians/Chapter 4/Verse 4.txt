<p><b>4. by myself</b>—Translate, "I
	am conscious to myself of no (ministerial) unfaithfulness."
	BENGEL explains the <i>Greek</i>
	compound, "<i>to decide in judgments on</i> one in relation to
	others," not simply to <i>judge.</i>
</p>
<p><b>am I not hereby
	justified</b>—Therefore conscience is not an infallible guide. Paul
	did not consider his so. This verse is directly against the judicial
	power claimed by the priests of Rome.</p>
