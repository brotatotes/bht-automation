<p><b>5.</b> Disproving the judicial power
	claimed by the Romish priesthood in the confessional. 
	</p>
<p><b>Therefore</b>—as the Lord
	is the sole Decider or Dijudicator. 
	</p>
<p><b>judge</b>—not the same
	<i>Greek</i> word as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:3">1 Corinthians 4:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:4">1 Corinthians 4:4</span>, where the meaning is to
	<i>approve of</i> or <i>decide on,</i> the merits of one's case. Here
	all <i>judgments</i> in general are forbidden, which would, on our
	part, presumptuously forestall God's prerogative of final <i>judgment.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Lord</b>—Jesus Christ,
	whose "ministers" we are (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:4- :">1 Corinthians 4:4- :</span>), and who is to be the judge (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:27">John 5:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:42">Acts 10:42</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:31">Acts 17:31</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>manifest . . . hearts</b>—Our
	judgments now (as those of the Corinthians respecting their teachers)
	are necessarily defective; as we only see the outward <i>act,</i> we
	cannot see the <i>motives</i> of "hearts." "Faithfulness"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:2">1 Corinthians 4:2</span>) will hereby be
	estimated, and the "Lord" will "justify," or the
	reverse (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:4">1 Corinthians 4:4</span>), according to
	the state of the <i>heart.</i>
</p>
<p><b>then shall every man have
	praise</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:8">1 Corinthians 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+26:23">1 Samuel 26:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:21">Matthew 25:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:23">Matthew 25:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:28">Matthew 25:28</span>). Rather, "<i>his
	due</i> praise," not exaggerated praise, such as the Corinthians
	heaped on favorite teachers; "the praise" (so the <i>Greek</i>)
	due for acts estimated by the motives. "Then," not before:
	therefore wait till <i>then</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:28- :">Matthew 25:28- :</span>).</p>
