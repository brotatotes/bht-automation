<p><b>in a figure transferred to
	myself</b>—that is, I have represented under the persons of Apollos
	and myself what really holds good of all teachers, making us two a
	<i>figure</i> or <i>type</i> of all the others. I have mentioned us
	two, whose names have been used as a party cry; but under our names I
	mean others to be understood, whom I do not name, in order not to
	shame you [ESTIUS].

<p><b>not to think,</b> &amp;c.—The
	best manuscripts omit "think." Translate, "That in us
	(as your example) ye might learn (this), not (to go) beyond what is
	written." Revere the <i>silence</i> of Holy Writ, as much as its
	<i>declarations:</i> so you will less dogmatize on what is not
	expressly revealed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+29:29">Deuteronomy 29:29</span>).

<p><b>puffed up for one</b>—namely,
	"for one (favorite minister) against another." The <i>Greek</i>
	indicative implies, "That ye be not puffed up <i>as ye are.</i>"</p>
