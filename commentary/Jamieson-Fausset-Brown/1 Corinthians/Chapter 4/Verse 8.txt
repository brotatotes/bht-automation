<p><b>8.</b> Irony. Translate, "<i>Already</i>
	ye are filled full (with spiritual food), <i>already</i> ye are rich,
	ye have seated yourselves upon your throne as kings, without us."
	The emphasis is on "already" and "without us"; ye
	act as if ye needed no more to "hunger and thirst after
	righteousness," and as if already ye had reached the "kingdom"
	for which Christians have to strive and suffer. Ye are so puffed up
	with your favorite teachers, and your own fancied spiritual
	attainments in knowledge through them, that ye feel like those
	"filled full" at a feast, or as a "rich" man
	priding himself in his riches: so ye feel ye can now do "without
	us," your first spiritual fathers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). They forgot that before the "kingdom" and the
	"<i>fulness</i> of joy," at the marriage feast of the Lamb,
	must come the cross, and suffering, to every true believer (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:5">2 Timothy 2:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:12">2 Timothy 2:12</span>).
	They were like the self-complacent Laodiceans (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:12- :">2 Timothy 2:12- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+12:8">Hosea 12:8</span>).
	<i>Temporal</i> fulness and riches doubtless <i>tended</i> in some
	cases at Corinth, to generate this spiritual self-sufficiency; the
	contrast to the apostle's literal "hunger and thirst" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+12:8- :">Hosea 12:8- :</span>) proves this.

<p><b>I would . . . ye did
	reign</b>—Translate, "I would <i>indeed,</i>" &amp;c. I
	would truly it were so, and that your kingdom had really begun. 
	</p>
<p><b>that we also might reign with
	you</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span>). "I
	seek not yours, but you." Your spiritual prosperity would
	redound to that of us, your fathers in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14- :">2 Corinthians 12:14- :</span>). When you reach the kingdom, you shall be our "crown
	of rejoicing, in the presence of our Lord Jesus" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14- :">2 Corinthians 12:14- :</span>).</p>
