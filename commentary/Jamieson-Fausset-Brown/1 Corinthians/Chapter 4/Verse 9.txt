<p><b>9. For</b>—assigning the reason
	for desiring that the "reign" of himself and his fellow
	apostles with the Corinthians were come; namely, the present
	afflictions of the former. 
	</p>
<p><b>I think</b>—The Corinthians
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:18">1 Corinthians 3:18</span>) "seemed"
	to (literally, as here, "thought") themselves "wise in
	this world." Paul, in contrast, "thinks" that God has
	sent forth him and his fellow ministers "last," that is,
	the lowest in this world. The apostles fared worse than even the
	prophets, who, though sometimes afflicted, were often honored
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+1:10">2 Kings 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:9">2 Kings 5:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+8:9">2 Kings 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+8:12">2 Kings 8:12</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>set forth</b>—as a
	spectacle or gazing-stock. 
	</p>
<p><b>us the apostles</b>—Paul
	includes Apollos with the apostles, in the broader sense of the word;
	so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7">Romans 16:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span>
	(<i>Greek</i> for "messengers," <i>apostles</i>). 
	</p>
<p><b>as it were appointed to
	death</b>—as criminals condemned to die. 
	</p>
<p><b>made a spectacle</b>—literally,
	"a theatrical spectacle." So the <i>Greek</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23- :">2 Corinthians 8:23- :</span>, "made a <i>gazing-stock</i> by reproaches and
	afflictions." Criminals "condemned to die," in Paul's
	time, were exhibited as a gazing-stock to amuse the populace in the
	amphitheater. They were "set forth last" in the show, to
	fight with wild beasts. This explains the imagery of Paul here.
	(Compare TERTULLIAN [<i>On
	Modesty,</i> 14]). 
	</p>
<p><b>the world</b>—to the whole
	world, including "both angels and men"; "the whole
	family in heaven and earth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23- :">2 Corinthians 8:23- :</span>). As Jesus was "seen of angels" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23- :">2 Corinthians 8:23- :</span>), so His followers are a spectacle to the holy angels who
	take a deep interest in all the progressive steps of redemption
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>).
	Paul tacitly implies that though "last" and lowest in the
	world's judgment, Christ's servants are deemed by angels a spectacle
	worthy of their most intense regard [CHRYSOSTOM].
	However, since "the world" is a comprehensive expression,
	and is applied in this Epistle to the evil especially (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:27">1 Corinthians 1:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:28">1 Corinthians 1:28</span>), and since the
	spectators (in the image drawn from the amphitheater) gaze at the
	show with savage delight, rather than with sympathy for the
	sufferers, I think <i>bad</i> angels are included, besides <i>good</i>
	angels. ESTIUS makes the
	bad <i>alone</i> to be meant. But the generality of the term
	"angels," and its frequent use in a good sense, as well as
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>,
	incline me to include <i>good</i> as well as <i>bad</i> angels,
	though, for the reasons stated above, the bad may be principally
	meant.</p>
