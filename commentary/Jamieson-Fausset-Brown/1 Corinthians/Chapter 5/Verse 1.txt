<p><b>1. commonly</b>—rather, "actually"
	[ALFORD]. Absolutely
	[BENGEL]. "It is
	reported," implies, that the Corinthians, though they "wrote"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>) to Paul on other
	points, gave him no information on those things which bore against
	themselves. These latter matters reached the apostle indirectly (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1- :">1 Corinthians 7:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>so much as named</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts and authorities omit "named":
	"Fornication of such a gross kind as (exists) not even among the
	heathen, so that one (of you) hath (in concubinage) his father's
	wife," that is, his stepmother, while his father is still alive
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:12">2 Corinthians 7:12</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:12- :">2 Corinthians 7:12- :</span>). She was perhaps a heathen, for which reason he does not
	direct his rebuke against her (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:12">1 Corinthians 5:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:13">1 Corinthians 5:13</span>). ALFORD
	thinks "have" means <i>have in marriage:</i> but the
	connection is called "fornication," and neither Christian
	nor Gentile <i>law</i> would have sanctioned such a <i>marriage,</i>
	however Corinth's notorious profligacy might wink at the concubinage.</p>
