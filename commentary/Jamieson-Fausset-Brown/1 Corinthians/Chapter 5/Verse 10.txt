<p><b>10.</b> Limitation of the
	prohibition alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span>.
	As in dissolute Corinth to "company with no fornicators,"
	c., would be almost to company with none in the (unbelieving) world
	ye need not <i>utterly</i> ("altogether") forego
	intercourse with fornicators, c., of the unbelieving world (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:27">1 Corinthians 10:27</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:18">1 John 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19">1 John 5:19</span>).
	As "fornicators" sin against themselves, so "extortioners"
	against their neighbors, and "idolaters" against God. The
	attempt to get "out of the world," in violation of God's
	will that believers should remain in it but keep themselves from its
	evil, led to monasticism and its consequent evils.</p>
