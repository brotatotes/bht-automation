11. But now—"Now"
	does not express time, but "the case being so,"
	namely, that to avoid fornicators, c., of the world, you would
	have to leave the world altogether, which would be absurd. So "now"
	is used in Hebrews 11:16. Thus we
	avoid making the apostle now retract a command which he had
	before given. 
	I have written—that is,
	my meaning in the letter I wrote was "not to keep company,"
	&c. 
	a brother—contrasted
	with a "fornicator . . . of the world" (Hebrews 11:16- :). There is less danger in associating with open worldlings
	than with carnal professors. Here, as in Ephesians 5:3
Ephesians 5:5, "covetousness"
	is joined with "fornication": the common fount of both
	being "the fierce and ever fiercer longing of the creature,
	which has turned from God, to fill itself with the inferior objects
	of sense" [TRENCH,
	Greek Synonyms of the New Testament]. Hence "idolatry"
	is associated with them: and the covetous man is termed an "idolater"
	(Numbers 25:1; Numbers 25:2).
	The Corinthians did not fall into open idolatry, but ate things
	offered to idols, so making a compromise with the heathen; just as
	they connived at fornication. Thus this verse prepares for the
	precepts in 1 Corinthians 8:4, c. Compare
	the similar case of fornication, combined with a similar idolatrous
	compromise, after the pattern of Israel with the Midianites (1 Corinthians 8:4- :). 
	no not to eat—not to
	sit at the same table with such whether at the love-feasts (agapæ)
	or in private intercourse, much more at the Lord's table: at the
	last, too often now the guests "are not as children in one
	family, but like a heterogeneous crowd of strangers in an inn"
	[BENGEL] (compare Galatians 2:12;
	2 John 1:10; 2 John 1:11).
