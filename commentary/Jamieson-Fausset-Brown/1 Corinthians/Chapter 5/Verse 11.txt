<p><b>11. But now</b>—"Now"
	does not express <i>time,</i> but "<i>the case being so,</i>"
	namely, that to avoid fornicators, c., <i>of the world,</i> you would
	have to leave the world altogether, which would be absurd. So "now"
	is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:16">Hebrews 11:16</span>. Thus we
	avoid making the apostle <i>now</i> retract a command which he had
	before given. 
	</p>
<p><b>I have written</b>—that is,
	my meaning in the letter I wrote was "not to keep company,"
	&amp;c. 
	</p>
<p><b>a brother</b>—contrasted
	with a "fornicator . . . <i>of the world</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:16- :">Hebrews 11:16- :</span>). There is less danger in associating with open worldlings
	than with carnal professors. Here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>, "covetousness"
	is joined with "fornication": the common fount of both
	being "the fierce and ever fiercer longing of the creature,
	which has turned from God, to fill itself with the inferior objects
	of sense" [TRENCH,
	<i>Greek Synonyms of the New Testament</i>]. Hence "idolatry"
	is associated with them: and the covetous man is termed an "idolater"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:1">Numbers 25:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:2">Numbers 25:2</span>).
	The Corinthians did not fall into open idolatry, but ate things
	offered to idols, so making a compromise with the heathen; just as
	they connived at fornication. Thus this verse prepares for the
	precepts in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4">1 Corinthians 8:4</span>, c. Compare
	the similar case of fornication, combined with a similar idolatrous
	compromise, after the pattern of Israel with the Midianites (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4- :">1 Corinthians 8:4- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>no not to eat</b>—not to
	sit at the same table with such whether at the love-feasts (<i>agapæ</i>)
	or in private intercourse, much more at the Lord's table: at the
	last, too often now the guests "are not as children in one
	family, but like a heterogeneous crowd of strangers in an inn"
	[BENGEL] (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:12">Galatians 2:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:10">2 John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:11">2 John 1:11</span>).</p>
