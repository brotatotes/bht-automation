<p><b>2. puffed up</b>—with your own
	wisdom and knowledge, and the eloquence of your favorite teachers: at
	a time when ye ought to be "mourning" at the scandal caused
	to religion by the incest. Paul <i>mourned</i> because they did not
	mourn (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:4">2 Corinthians 2:4</span>). We ought to
	<i>mourn</i> over the transgressions of others, and <i>repent</i> of
	our own (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:21">2 Corinthians 12:21</span>) [BENGEL].

<p><b>that</b>—ye have not felt
	such mourning as would lead to the result <i>that,</i> &amp;c. 
	</p>
<p><b>taken away from among you</b>—by
	excommunication. The incestuous person was hereby brought to bitter
	repentance, in the interval between the sending of the first and
	second Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:21- :">2 Corinthians 12:21- :</span>). Excommunication in the Christian Church corresponded to
	that in the Jewish synagogue, in there being a lighter and heavier
	form: the latter an utter separation from church fellowship and the
	Lord's house, the former exclusion from the Lord's Supper only but
	not from the Church.</p>
