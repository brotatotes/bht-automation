<p><b>4. In the name of our Lord Jesus
	Christ</b>â€”By His authority and as representing His <i>person</i>
	and will (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:10">2 Corinthians 2:10</span>). Join this
	with "to deliver such a one unto Satan" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:10- :">2 Corinthians 2:10- :</span>). The clause, "When ye have been gathered together and
	my spirit (wherein I am 'present,' though 'absent in body,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:10- :">2 Corinthians 2:10- :</span>), with the power of our Lord Jesus," stands in a
	parenthesis between. Paul speaking of himself uses the word "spirit";
	of Christ, "power." Christ's power was promised to be
	present with HIS Church
	"gathered together in His name" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:10- :">2 Corinthians 2:10- :</span>): and here Paul by inspiration gives a special promise
	of his apostolic spirit, which in such cases was guided by the Holy
	Spirit, ratifying their decree passed according to his <i>judgment</i>
	("I have judged," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:10- :">2 Corinthians 2:10- :</span>), as though he were present in person (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:21-23">John 20:21-23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:3-10">2 Corinthians 13:3-10</span>). This power of
	infallible judgment was limited to the apostles; for they alone had
	the power of working miracles as their credentials to attest their
	infallibility. Their successors, to establish their claim to the
	latter, must produce the former (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:3-47.13.10- :">2 Corinthians 13:3-47.13.10- :</span>). Even the apostles in ordinary cases, and where not
	specially and consciously inspired, were fallible (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:13">Acts 8:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:23">Acts 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:11-14">Galatians 2:11-14</span>).</p>
