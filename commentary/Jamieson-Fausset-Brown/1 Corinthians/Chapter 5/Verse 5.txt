<p><b>5.</b> Besides excommunication (of
	which the Corinthians themselves had the power), Paul delegates here
	to the Corinthian Church <i>his own</i> special power as an apostle,
	of inflicting corporeal disease or death in punishment for sin ("to
	deliver to Satan such an one," that is, so heinous a sinner).
	For instances of this power, see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:1-11">Acts 5:1-11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:11">Acts 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>.
	As Satan receives power at times to try the godly, as Job (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20- :">1 Timothy 1:20- :</span>) and Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>;
	compare also as to Peter, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7- :">2 Corinthians 12:7- :</span>), much more the ungodly. Satan, the "accuser of the
	brethren" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:10">Revelation 12:10</span>) and
	the "adversary" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8">1 Peter 5:8</span>),
	demands the sinner for punishment on account of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8- :">1 Peter 5:8- :</span>). When God lets Satan have his way, He is said to "deliver
	the sinner unto Satan" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8- :">1 Peter 5:8- :</span>). Here it is not finally; but for the affliction of the
	body with disease, and even <i>death</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:30">1 Corinthians 11:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:32">1 Corinthians 11:32</span>), so as to <i>destroy
	fleshly lust.</i> He does not say, "for the destruction of the
	<i>body,</i>" for <i>it</i> shall share in redemption (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:32- :">1 Corinthians 11:32- :</span>); but of the corrupt "flesh" which "cannot
	inherit the kingdom of God," and the lusts of which had prompted
	this offender to incest (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:5">Romans 7:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>).
	The "destruction of the flesh" answers to "<i>mortify</i>
	the deeds of the <i>body</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10- :">Romans 8:10- :</span>), only that the latter is done by one's self, the former is
	effected by chastisement from God (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10- :">Romans 8:10- :</span>): 
	</p>
<p><b>the spirit . . . saved</b>â€”the
	spiritual part of man, in the believer the organ of the Holy Spirit.
	Temporary affliction often leads to permanent salvation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10- :">Romans 8:10- :</span>).</p>
