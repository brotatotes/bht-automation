8. not . . . old leaven—of our
	unconverted state as Jews or heathen. 
	malice—the opposite of
	"sincerity," which allows no leaven of evil to be mixed up
	with good (Matthew 16:6). 
	wickedness—the opposite
	of "truth," which allows not evil to be mistaken for good.
	The Greek for "malice" means the evil habit
	of mind; "wickedness," the outcoming of the same in
	word and deed. The Greek for "sincerity" expresses
	literally, a thing which, when examined by the sun's light, is
	found pure and unadulterated.
