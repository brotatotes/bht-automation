1. Dare—This word implies
	treason against Christian brotherhood [BENGEL].
	before the unjust—The
	Gentile judges are here so termed by an epithet appropriate to the
	subject in question, namely, one concerning justice. Though
	all Gentiles were not altogether unjust, yet in the highest
	view of justice which has regard to God as the Supreme Judge, they
	are so: Christians, on the other hand, as regarding God as the only
	Fountain of justice, should not expect justice from them. 
	before . . . saints—The
	Jews abroad were permitted to refer their disputes to Jewish
	arbitrators [JOSEPHUS,
	Antiquities, 14.10,17]. So the Christians were allowed to have
	Christian arbitrators.
