<p><b>1. Dare</b>—This word implies
	treason against Christian brotherhood [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>before the unjust</b>—The
	Gentile judges are here so termed by an epithet appropriate to the
	subject in question, namely, one concerning <i>justice.</i> Though
	all Gentiles were not altogether <i>unjust,</i> yet in the highest
	view of justice which has regard to God as the Supreme Judge, they
	are so: Christians, on the other hand, as regarding God as the only
	Fountain of justice, should not expect justice from them. 
	</p>
<p><b>before . . . saints</b>—The
	Jews abroad were permitted to refer their disputes to Jewish
	<i>arbitrators</i> [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 14.10,17]. So the Christians were allowed to have
	Christian arbitrators.</p>
