<p><b>11. ye are washed</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	middle voice expresses, "Ye have had yourselves washed."
	This washing implies the admission to the <i>benefits of Christ's
	salvation</i> generally; of which the parts are; (1) <i>Sanctification,</i>
	or the setting apart from the world, and adoption into the Church: so
	"sanctified" is used <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:14">1 Corinthians 7:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19- :">John 17:19- :</span>, where it rather seems to mean the <i>setting apart</i> of
	one as <i>consecrated by the Spirit in the eternal purpose God.</i>
	(2) <i>Justification</i> from condemnation through the righteousness
	of God in Christ by faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19- :">John 17:19- :</span>). So PARÆUS. The
	order of <i>sanctification</i> before <i>justification</i> shows that
	it must be so taken, and not in the sense of <i>progressive</i>
	sanctification. "Washed" precedes both, and so must refer
	to the Christian's outward new birth of water, the sign of the inward
	setting apart to the Lord by the inspiration of the Spirit as the
	seed of new life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:26">Ephesians 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:22">Hebrews 10:22</span>). Paul (compare the
	Church of England Baptismal Service), in charity, and faith in the
	ideal of the Church, presumes that baptism realizes its original
	design, and that those outwardly baptized inwardly enter into vital
	communion with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:27">Galatians 3:27</span>).
	He presents the grand ideal which those alone realized in whom the
	inward and the outward baptism coalesced. At the same time he
	recognizes the fact that this in many cases does not hold good (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:27- :">Galatians 3:27- :</span>), leaving it to God to decide who are the really "washed,"
	while he only decides on broad general principles. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the name of . . . Jesus,
	and by the Spirit</b>—rather, "in the Spirit," that is,
	by His <i>in</i>-dwelling. Both clauses belong to the three—"washed,
	sanctified, justified." 
	</p>
<p><b>our God</b>—The "our"
	reminds the that amidst all his reproofs God is still the common God
	of himself and them.

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:27- :">Galatians 3:27- :</span>. REFUTATION OF THE
	ANTINOMIAN DEFENSE
	OF FORNICATION AS IF
	IT WAS
	LAWFUL BECAUSE
	MEATS ARE
	SO.</p>
