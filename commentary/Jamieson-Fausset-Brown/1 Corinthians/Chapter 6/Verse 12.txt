<p><b>12. All things are lawful unto
	me</b>—These, which were Paul's own words on a former occasion (to
	the Corinthians, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:23">Galatians 5:23</span>), were made a pretext
	for excusing the eating of meats offered to idols, and so of what was
	generally connected with idolatry (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:23- :">Galatians 5:23- :</span>), "fornication" (perhaps in the letter of the
	Corinthians to Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1">1 Corinthians 7:1</span>).
	Paul's remark had referred only to things <i>indifferent:</i> but
	they wished to treat fornication as such, on the ground that the
	existence of bodily appetites proved the <i>lawfulness</i> of their
	gratification. 
	</p>
<p><b>me</b>—Paul giving himself
	as a sample of Christians in general. 
	</p>
<p><b>but I</b>—whatever others
	do, <i>I will not,</i> c. 
	</p>
<p><b>lawful . . . brought under
	the power</b>—The <i>Greek</i> words are from the same root, whence
	there is a play on the words: All things <i>are in</i> my <i>power,</i>
	but I will not be <i>brought under the power of any</i> of them (the
	"all things"). He who commits "fornication,"
	steps aside from his own legitimate power or liberty, and is "brought
	under the power" of an harlot (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:1- :">1 Corinthians 7:1- :</span> compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:4">1 Corinthians 7:4</span>). The
	"power" ought to be in the hands of the <i>believer,</i>
	not in the <i>things which he uses</i> [BENGEL];
	else his liberty is forfeited; he ceases to be his own master
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:34-36">John 8:34-36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:13">Galatians 5:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:16">1 Peter 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:19">2 Peter 2:19</span>).
	Unlawful things ruin thousands; "lawful" things (unlawfully
	used), ten thousands.</p>
