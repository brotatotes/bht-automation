<p><b>raised up</b>—rather,
	"raised," to distinguish it from "will raise <i>up</i>
	us"; the <i>Greek</i> of the latter being a compound, the former
	a simple verb. Believers shall be raised up <i>out of</i> the rest of
	the dead (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); the
	first resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:5">Revelation 20:5</span>).

	the possibility of his being found in the grave when Christ comes;
	elsewhere, of his being possibly found alive (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:5- :">Revelation 20:5- :</span>). In either event, the Lord's coming rather than death is
	the great object of the Christian's expectation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:5- :">Revelation 20:5- :</span>).</p>
