<p><b>18. Flee</b>—The only safety in
	such temptations is <i>flight</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+39:12">Genesis 39:12</span>;

<p><b>Every sin</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	is forcible. "<i>Every sin whatsoever</i> that a man doeth."
	Every <i>other</i> sin; even gluttony, drunkenness, and self-murder
	are "without," that is, comparatively external to the body
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:18">Mark 7:18</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:18- :">Mark 7:18- :</span>). He certainly injures, but he does not alienate the body
	itself; the sin is not terminated in the body; he rather sins against
	the perishing accidents of the body (as the "belly," and
	the body's present temporary organization), and against the soul than
	against the body in its permanent essence, designed "for the
	Lord." "But" the fornicator alienates that body which
	is the Lord's, and makes it one with a harlot's body, and so "sinneth
	against his own body," that is, against the <i>verity</i> and
	<i>nature</i> of his body; not a mere <i>effect</i> on the body from
	without, but a <i>contradiction</i> of the truth of the body, wrought
	<i>within itself</i> [ALFORD].</p>
