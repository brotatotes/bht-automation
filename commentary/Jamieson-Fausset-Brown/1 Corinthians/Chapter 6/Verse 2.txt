<p><b>2. Do ye not know</b>—as a truth
	universally recognized by Christians. Notwithstanding all your
	glorying in your "knowledge," ye are acting contrary to it
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:4">1 Corinthians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:5">1 Corinthians 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>). The oldest manuscripts
	have "Or" before "know ye not"; that is, "What!
	(expressing surprise) know ye not," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>saints . . . judge</b>—that
	is, "rule," including <i>judgment:</i> as assessors of
	Christ. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>, "judging,"
	that is, "ruling over." (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+49:14">Psalms 49:14</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:22">Daniel 7:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:27">Daniel 7:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:26">Revelation 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>). There is a distinction
	drawn by able expositors between the saints who <i>judge</i> or <i>rule,</i>
	and the world which is ruled by them: as there is between the elected
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:23">Matthew 20:23</span>) twelve apostles who
	sit on thrones judging, and the twelve tribes of Israel that are
	judged by them. To <i>reign,</i> and to be <i>saved,</i> are not
	necessarily synonymous. As Jehovah employed angels to carry the law
	into effect when He descended on Sinai to establish His throne in
	Israel, so at His coming the saints shall administer the kingdom for,
	and under, Him. The nations of the earth, and Israel the foremost, in
	the flesh, shall, in this view, be the <i>subjects</i> of the rule of
	the Lord and His saints in glorified bodies. The mistake of the
	Chiliasts was that they took the merely carnal view, restricting the
	kingdom to the terrestrial part. This part shall have place with the
	accession of spiritual and temporal blessings such as Christ's
	presence must produce. Besides this earthly glory, there shall be the
	heavenly glory of the saints reigning in transfigured bodies, and
	holding such blessed intercourse with mortal men, as angels had with
	men of old, and as Christ, Moses, and Elias, in glory had with Peter,
	James, and John, in the flesh at the transfiguration (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:12">2 Timothy 2:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16-18">2 Peter 1:16-18</span>). But here the
	"world" seems to be the unbelieving world that is to be
	"condemned" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:22">1 Corinthians 11:22</span>),
	rather than the whole world, including the subject nations which are
	to be brought under Christ's sway; however, it may include <i>both</i>
	those to be condemned, with the bad angels, and those about to be
	brought into obedience to the sway of Christ with His saints. Compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:32">Matthew 25:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40">Matthew 25:40</span>,
	"all nations," "these my brethren" on the thrones
	with Him. The event will decide the truth of this view.

<p><b>judged by you</b>—or,
	<i>before</i> you (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40- :">Matthew 25:40- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>smallest matters</b>—The
	weightiest of earthly questions at issue are infinitely <i>small</i>
	compared with those to be decided on the judgment-day.</p>
