	Christ's blood is strictly a ransom paid to God's justice by the love
	of God in Christ for our redemption (Matthew 20:28;
	Acts 20:28; Galatians 3:13;
	Hebrews 9:12; 1 Peter 1:18;
	1 Peter 1:19; 2 Peter 2:1;
	Revelation 5:9). While He thus took off
	our obligation to punishment, He laid upon us a new obligation to
	obedience (1 Corinthians 7:22; 1 Corinthians 7:23).
	If we accept Him as our Prophet to reveal God to us, and our Priest

	needed for the sense, as the context refers mainly to the
	"body" (1 Corinthians 6:16;
	1 Corinthians 6:18; 1 Corinthians 6:19).
	The "spirit" is incidentally mentioned in 1 Corinthians 6:19- :, which perhaps gave rise to the interpolation, at first
	written in the Margin, afterwards inserted in the text.
