<p><b>20. bought with a price</b>—Therefore
	Christ's blood is strictly a ransom paid to God's justice by the love
	of God in Christ for our redemption (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>;

	our obligation to punishment, He laid upon us a new obligation to

	If we accept Him as our Prophet to reveal God to us, and our Priest
	to atone for us, we must also accept Him as our King to rule over us
	as wholly His, presenting every token of our fealty (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:23- :">1 Corinthians 7:23- :</span>).

<p><b>and in your spirit, which are
	God's</b>—not in the oldest manuscripts and versions, and not
	needed for the sense, as the context refers <i>mainly</i> to the
	"body" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:16">1 Corinthians 6:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:18">1 Corinthians 6:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19">1 Corinthians 6:19</span>).
	The "spirit" is <i>incidentally</i> mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19- :">1 Corinthians 6:19- :</span>, which perhaps gave rise to the interpolation, at first
	written in the <i>Margin,</i> afterwards inserted in the text.</p>
