<p><b>3. judge angels</b>â€”namely, <i>bad</i>
	angels. We who are now "a spectacle to angels" shall then
	"judge angels." The saints shall join in approving the
	final sentence of the Judge on them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Believers shall, as administrators of the kingdom under
	Jesus, put down all rule that is hostile to God. Perhaps, too, <i>good</i>
	angels shall then receive from the Judge, with the approval of the
	saints, higher honors.</p>
