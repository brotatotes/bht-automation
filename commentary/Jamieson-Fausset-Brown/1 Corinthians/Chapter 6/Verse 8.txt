<p><b>8. ye</b>â€”emphatic. <i>Ye,</i>
	whom your Lord commanded to return good for evil, <i>on the contrary,</i>
	"do wrong (by taking away) and defraud" (by retaining what
	is entrusted to you; or "defraud" marks the <i>effect</i>
	of the "wrong" done, namely, the loss inflicted). Not only
	do ye not bear, but ye inflict wrongs.</p>
