<p><b>13. the woman</b>—a believer. 
	</p>
<p><b>let her not leave him</b>—"her
	husband," instead of "him," is the reading of the
	oldest manuscripts The <i>Greek</i> for "leave" is the same
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:12">1 Corinthians 7:12</span>, "put
	away"; translate, "Let her not <i>put away</i> [that is,
	part with] her husband." The wife had the power of effecting a
	divorce by Greek and Roman law.</p>
