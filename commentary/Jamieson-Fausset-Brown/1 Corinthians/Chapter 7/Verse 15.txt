15. if . . . depart—that is,
	wishes for separation. Translate, "separateth himself":
	offended with her Christianity, and refusing to live with her unless
	she renounce it. 
	brother or a sister is not
	under bondage—is not bound to renounce the faith for the sake
	of retaining her unbelieving husband [HAMMOND].
	So Deuteronomy 13:6; Matthew 10:35-37;
	Luke 14:26. The believer does not
	lie under the same obligation in the case of a union with an
	unbeliever, as in the case of one with a believer. In the former case
	he is not bound not to separate, if the unbeliever separate or
	"depart," in the latter nothing but "fornication"
	justifies separation [PHOTIUS
	in Æcumenius]. 
	but God hath called us to
	peace—Our Christian calling is one that tends to "peace"
	(Romans 12:18), not quarrelling;
	therefore the believer should not ordinarily depart from the
	unbelieving consort (Romans 12:18- :), on the one hand; and on the other, in the exceptional
	case of the unbeliever desiring to depart, the believer is not bound
	to force the other party to stay in a state of continual discord (Romans 12:18- :). Better still it would be not to enter into such unequal
	alliances at all (1 Corinthians 7:40;
	2 Corinthians 6:14).
