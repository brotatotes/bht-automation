<p><b>15. if . . . depart</b>—that is,
	wishes for separation. Translate, "separateth himself":
	offended with her Christianity, and refusing to live with her unless
	she renounce it. 
	</p>
<p><b>brother or a sister is not
	under bondage</b>—is not bound to renounce the faith for the sake
	of retaining her unbelieving husband [HAMMOND].
	So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+13:6">Deuteronomy 13:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:35-37">Matthew 10:35-37</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:26">Luke 14:26</span>. The believer does not
	lie under the same obligation in the case of a union with an
	unbeliever, as in the case of one with a believer. In the former case
	he is not bound not to separate, if the unbeliever separate or
	"depart," in the latter nothing but "fornication"
	justifies separation [PHOTIUS
	in <i>Æcumenius</i>].

<p><b>but God hath called us to
	peace</b>—Our Christian calling is one that tends to "peace"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:18">Romans 12:18</span>), not quarrelling;
	therefore the believer should not ordinarily depart from the
	unbelieving consort (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:18- :">Romans 12:18- :</span>), on the one hand; and on the other, in the exceptional
	case of the unbeliever desiring to depart, the believer is not bound
	to force the other party to stay in a state of continual discord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:18- :">Romans 12:18- :</span>). Better still it would be not to enter into such unequal
	alliances at all (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:40">1 Corinthians 7:40</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:14">2 Corinthians 6:14</span>).</p>
