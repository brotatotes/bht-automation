16. What knowest thou but that
	by staying with thy unbelieving partner thou mayest save him or her?
	Enforcing the precept to stay with the unbelieving consort ( :-). So Ruth the Moabitess became a convert to her husband's
	faith: and Joseph and Moses probably gained over their wives. So
	conversely the unbelieving husband may be won by the believing wife
	(1 Peter 3:1) [CALVIN].
	Or else (1 Corinthians 7:15), if thy
	unbelieving consort wishes to depart, let him go, so that thou mayest
	live "in peace": for thou canst not be sure of
	converting him, so as to make it obligatory on thee at all costs
	to stay with him against his will [MENOCHIUS
	and ALFORD]. 
	saveâ€”be the instrument
	of salvation to (James 5:20).
