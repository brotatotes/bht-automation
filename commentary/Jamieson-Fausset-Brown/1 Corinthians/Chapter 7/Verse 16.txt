<p><b>16.</b> What knowest thou but that
	by staying with thy unbelieving partner thou mayest save him or her?
	Enforcing the precept to stay with the unbelieving consort (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). So Ruth the Moabitess became a convert to her husband's
	faith: and Joseph and Moses probably gained over their wives. So
	conversely the unbelieving husband may be won by the believing wife
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>) [CALVIN].
	Or else (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:15">1 Corinthians 7:15</span>), if thy
	unbelieving consort wishes to depart, let him go, so that thou mayest
	live "in peace": for <i>thou canst not be sure of
	converting him,</i> so as to make it obligatory on thee at all costs
	to stay with him against his will [MENOCHIUS
	and ALFORD].
