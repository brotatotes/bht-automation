<p><b>17. But</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "If
	not." "Only." Caution that believers should not make
	this direction (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:16">1 Corinthians 7:16</span>; as
	ALFORD explains it) a
	ground for separating "of themselves" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:16- :">1 Corinthians 7:16- :</span>). Or, <i>But if</i> there be <i>no</i> hope of gaining
	over the unbeliever, still let the general principle be maintained,
	"As <i>the Lord</i> hath allotted to each, as <i>God</i> hath
	called each, so let him walk" (so the <i>Greek</i> in the oldest
	reading); let him walk in the path allotted to him and wherein he was
	called. The heavenly calling does not set aside our earthly callings.
