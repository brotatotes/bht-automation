<p><b>19. Circumcision . . . nothing, but
	. . . keeping of . . . commandments of God</b>â€”namely, is all in
	all. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6">Galatians 5:6</span> this "keeping
	of the commandments of God" is defined to be "faith which
	worketh by love"; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6- :">Galatians 5:6- :</span>, "a new creature." Circumcision was a commandment
	of God: but not for ever, as "love."</p>
