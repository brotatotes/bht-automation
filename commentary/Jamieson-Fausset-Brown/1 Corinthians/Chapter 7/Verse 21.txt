	rather in thy state as a servant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:20">1 Corinthians 7:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:2">1 Timothy 6:2</span>).
	The <i>Greek,</i> "But if <i>even</i> thou mayest be made free,
	<i>use</i> it," and the context (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:20">1 Corinthians 7:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:22">1 Corinthians 7:22</span>) favors this view
	[CHRYSOSTOM, BENGEL,
	and ALFORD]. This advice
	(if this translation be right) is not absolute, as the spirit of the
	Gospel is against slavery. What is advised here is, contentment under
	one's existing condition (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:22- :">1 Corinthians 7:22- :</span>), though an undesirable one, since in our union with Christ
	all outward disparities of condition are compensated (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:22- :">1 Corinthians 7:22- :</span>). Be not unduly impatient to cast off "<i>even</i>"
	thy condition as a servant <i>by unlawful means</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:22- :">1 Corinthians 7:22- :</span>); as, for example, Onesimus did by fleeing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:22- :">1 Corinthians 7:22- :</span>). The precept (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:23">1 Corinthians 7:23</span>),
	"Become not (so the <i>Greek</i>) the servants of men,"
	implies plainly that slavery is abnormal (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:23- :">1 Corinthians 7:23- :</span>). "Men stealers," or slave dealers, are classed
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10">1 Timothy 1:10</span>, with "murderers"
	and "perjurers." NEANDER,
	GROTIUS, c., explain, "If
	called, being a slave, to Christianity, be content—but yet, if <i>also</i>
	thou canst be free (as a still <i>additional</i> good, which if thou
	canst not attain, be satisfied without it but which, if offered to
	thee, is not to be despised), <i>make use of the opportunity of
	becoming free, rather than</i> by neglecting it to remain a slave."
	I prefer this latter view, as more according to the tenor of the
	Gospel, and fully justified by the <i>Greek.</i></p>
