<p><b>23. be not ye</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"become not ye." Paul here changes from "thou"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:21">1 Corinthians 7:21</span>) to "ye."
	YE ALL are "bought"
	with the blood of Christ, whatever be your earthly state (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:21- :">1 Corinthians 7:21- :</span>). "Become not servants to men," either externally,
	or spiritually; the former sense applying to the free alone: the
	latter to Christian freemen and slaves alike, that they should not be
	servile adherents to their party leaders at Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21">1 Corinthians 3:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:8-10">Matthew 23:8-10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>); nor indeed slaves to
	men generally, so far as their condition admits. The external and
	internal conditions, so far as is attainable, should correspond, and
	the former be subservient to the latter (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:21">1 Corinthians 7:21</span>;
