	chiefly careful of the footing on which he stands towards God rather
	than that towards men. This clause, "with God," limits the
	similar precept in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:20">1 Corinthians 7:20</span>. A
	man may cease to "abide in the calling wherein he was called,"
	and yet not violate the precept here. If a man's calling be not
	favorable to his "abiding with God" (retaining holy
	fellowship with Him), he may use lawful means to change from it
	(compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:20- :">1 Corinthians 7:20- :</span>).</p>
