<p><b>25. no commandment of the Lord: yet
	. . . my judgment</b>—I have no <i>express revelation</i> from the
	Lord <i>commanding</i> it, but I give my <i>judgment</i> (opinion);
	namely, under the ordinary inspiration which accompanied the apostles
	in all their canonical writings (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:40">1 Corinthians 7:40</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:37">1 Corinthians 14:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>).
	The Lord inspires me in this case to give you only a <i>recommendation,</i>
	which you are free to adopt or reject—not a positive <i>command.</i>
	In the second case (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:10">1 Corinthians 7:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:11">1 Corinthians 7:11</span>) it was a positive
	command; for the Lord had already made known His will (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+2:14">Malachi 2:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+2:15">Malachi 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:31">Matthew 5:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32">Matthew 5:32</span>). In the third case (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:32- :">Matthew 5:32- :</span>), the Old Testament commandment of God to put away strange
	wives (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+10:3">Ezra 10:3</span>), Paul by the
	Spirit revokes. 
	</p>
<p><b>mercy of the Lord</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+10:3- :">Ezra 10:3- :</span>). He attributes his apostleship and the gifts accompanying
	it (including inspiration) to God's grace alone. 
	</p>
<p><b>faithful</b>—in dispensing
	to you the inspired directions received by me from the Lord.</p>
