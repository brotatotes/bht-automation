<p><b>28. trouble in the flesh</b>—Those
	who marry, he says, shall incur "trouble in the flesh"
	(that is, in their outward state, by reason of the present distress),
	not <i>sin,</i> which is the trouble of the <i>spirit.</i>
</p>
<p><b>but I spare you</b>—The
	emphasis in the <i>Greek</i> is on "I." <i>My</i> motive in
	advising you so is, to "spare you" such trouble in the
	flesh. So ALFORD after
	CALVIN, BENGEL,
	and others. ESTIUS from
	AUGUSTINE explains it, "I
	spare you further details of the inconveniences of matrimony, lest
	even the incontinent may at the peril of lust be deterred from
	matrimony: thus I have regard for your infirmity." The
	antithesis in the <i>Greek</i> of "I . . . you" and "such"
	favors the former.</p>
