<p><b>29. this I say</b>—A summing up of
	the whole, wherein he draws the practical inference from what
	precedes (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:50">1 Corinthians 15:50</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the time</b>—the <i>season</i>
	(so the <i>Greek</i>) of this present dispensation up to the coming
	of the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:11">Romans 13:11</span>). He
	uses the <i>Greek</i> expression which the Lord used in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:8">Luke 21:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+13:33">Mark 13:33</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>short</b>—literally,
	"contracted." 
	</p>
<p><b>it remaineth</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "The time (season) is shortened <i>as to what
	remains,</i> in order that both they," c. that is, the effect
	which the shortening of the time ought to have is, "that for the
	remaining time (henceforth), both they," &amp;c. The clause, "as
	to what remains," though in <i>construction</i> belonging to the
	previous clause, in <i>sense</i> belongs to the following. However,
	CYPRIAN and <i>Vulgate</i>
	support <i>English Version.</i>
</p>
<p><b>as though they had none</b>—We
	ought to consider nothing as our own in real or permanent possession.</p>
