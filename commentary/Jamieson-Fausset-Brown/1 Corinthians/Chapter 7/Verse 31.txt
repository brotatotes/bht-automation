<p><b>31. not abusing it</b>—not abusing
	it by an <i>overmuch using</i> of it. The meaning of "abusing"
	here is, not so much <i>perverting,</i> as <i>using it to the full</i>
	[BENGEL]. We are to use
	it, "not to <i>take our fill</i>" of its pursuits as our
	chief aim (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). As the planets while turning on their own axis, yet
	revolve round the sun; so while we do our part in our own worldly
	sphere, God is to be the center of all our desires.

<p><b>fashion</b>—the present
	fleeting <i>form.</i> Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "vain show"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "a dream"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "a vapor."

<p><b>passeth away</b>—not merely
	<i>shall pass away,</i> but <i>is</i> now actually <i>passing away.</i>
	The image is drawn from a <i>shifting</i> scene in a play represented
	on the stage (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:17">1 John 2:17</span>). Paul
	inculcates not so much the outward denial of earthly things, as the
	inward spirit whereby the married and the rich, as well as the
	unmarried and the poor, would be ready to sacrifice all for Christ's
	sake.</p>
