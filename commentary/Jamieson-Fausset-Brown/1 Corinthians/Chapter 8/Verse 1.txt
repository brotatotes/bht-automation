<p><b>1.</b> Though to those knowing that
	an idol has no existence, the question of eating meats offered to
	idols (referred to in the letter of the Corinthians, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) might seem unimportant, it is not so with some, and the
	infirmities of such should be respected. The portions of the victims
	not offered on the altars belonged partly to the priests, partly to
	the offerers; and were eaten at feasts in the temples and in private
	houses and were often sold in the markets; so that Christians were
	constantly exposed to the temptation of receiving them, which was
	forbidden (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:2">Numbers 25:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+106:28">Psalms 106:28</span>).
	The apostles forbade it in their decree issued from Jerusalem
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:1-29">Acts 15:1-29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:25">Acts 21:25</span>);
	but Paul does not allude here to that decree, as he rests his
	precepts rather on his own independent apostolic authority. 
	</p>
<p><b>we know that we all have
	knowledge</b>—The Corinthians doubtless had referred to their
	"knowledge" (namely, of the indifference of meats, as in
	themselves having no sanctity or pollution). Paul replies, "We
	are aware that we all have [speaking <i>generally,</i> and so far as
	Christian <i>theory</i> goes; for in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:25- :">Acts 21:25- :</span> he speaks of some who <i>practically</i> have <i>not</i>]
	this knowledge." 
	</p>
<p><b>Knowledge puffeth up</b>—when
	without "love." Here a parenthesis begins; and the main
	subject is resumed in the same words, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:25- :">Acts 21:25- :</span>. "As concerning [touching] therefore the eating,"
	c. "Puffing up" is to please self. "Edifying" is
	to please one's neighbor Knowledge only says, All things are lawful
	for me; Love adds, But all things do not edify [BENGEL],
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:23">1 Corinthians 10:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:15">Romans 14:15</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>edifieth</b>—tends to <i>build
	up</i> the spiritual temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>;
