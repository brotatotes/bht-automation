<p><b>10. if any man</b>—being weak. 
	</p>
<p><b>which hast knowledge</b>—The
	very knowledge which thou pridest thyself on (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), will lead the weak after thy example to do that against his
	conscience, which thou doest without any scruple of conscience;
	namely, to eat meats offered to idols. 
	</p>
<p><b>conscience of him which is
	weak</b>—rather, "His conscience, <i>seeing he</i> is weak"
	[ALFORD and others]. 
	</p>
<p><b>emboldened</b>—literally,
	"built up." You ought to have <i>built up</i> your brother
	in good: but by your example your <i>building</i> him <i>up</i> is
	the emboldening him to violate his conscience.</p>
