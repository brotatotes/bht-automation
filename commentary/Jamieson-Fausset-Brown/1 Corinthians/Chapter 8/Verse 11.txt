<p><b>11. shall . . . perish</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read "perisheth." A single act seemingly
	unimportant may produce everlasting consequences. The weak brother
	loses his faith, and if he do not recover it, his salvation [BENGEL]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>for whom Christ died</b>—and
	for whose sake we too ought to be willing to die (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23- :">Romans 14:23- :</span>). And yet professing Christians at Corinth virtually tempted
	their brethren to their damnation, so far were they from sacrificing
	aught for their salvation. Note here, that it is no argument against
	the dogma that <i>Christ died for all, even for those who perish,</i>
	to say that thus He would have died <i>in vain</i> for many.
	Scripture is our rule, not our suppositions as to consequences. More
	is involved in redemption than the salvation of man: the <i>character
	of God</i> as at once just and loving is vindicated even in the case
	of the lost for they might have been saved, and so even in their case
	Christ has not died in vain. So the mercies of God's providence are
	not in vain, though many abuse them. Even the condemned shall
	manifest God's love in the great day, in that they too had the offer
	of God's mercy. It shall be the most awful ingredient in their cup
	that they might have been saved but would not: Christ died to redeem
	even them.</p>
