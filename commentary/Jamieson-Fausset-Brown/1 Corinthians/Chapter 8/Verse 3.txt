<p><b>3. love God</b>—the source of love
	to our neighbor (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:11">1 John 4:11</span>;

<p><b>the same</b>—literally,
	"this man"; he who loves, not he who "thinks that he
	knows," not having "charity" or love (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>;

<p><b>is known of him</b>—is
	known with the knowledge of approval and is acknowledged by God as
	His (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:6">Psalms 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>;

	never knew you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>).
	To love God is to know God; and he who thus knows God has been first
	known by God (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>;
