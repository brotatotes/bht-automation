<p><b>idol is nothing</b>—has no
	true being at all, the god it represents is not a living reality.
	This does not contradict <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1- :">1 Corinthians 8:1- :</span>, which states that they who worship idols, worship devils
	for here it is the GODS
	<i>believed by the worshippers to be represented by the idols</i>
	which are denied to have any existence, not the devils which really
	under the idols delude the worshippers. 
	</p>
<p><b>none other God</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts omit the word "other"; which gives a
	clearer sense.</p>
