6. to us—believers. 
	of whom—from whom as
	Creator all things derive their existence. 
	we in him—rather, "we
	for Him," or "unto Him." God the FATHER
	is the end for whom and for whose glory believers live. In  :- all things are said to be created (not only "by"
	Christ, but also) "for Him" (CHRIST).
	So entirely are the Father and Son one (compare Romans 11:36;
	Hebrews 2:10). 
	one Lord—contrasted
	with the "many lords" of heathendom (Hebrews 2:10- :). 
	by whom— (John 1:3;
	Hebrews 1:2). 
	we by him—as all things
	are "of" the Father by creation, so they (we
	believers especially) are restored to Him by the new creation
	(Colossians 1:20; Revelation 21:5).
	Also, as all things are by Christ by creation, so they (we
	especially) are restored by Him by the new creation.
