<p><b>6. to us</b>—believers. 
	</p>
<p><b>of whom</b>—from whom as
	Creator all things derive their existence. 
	</p>
<p><b>we in him</b>—rather, "we
	<i>for</i> Him," or "<i>unto</i> Him." God the FATHER
	is the end <i>for</i> whom and for whose glory believers live. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> all things are said to be created (not only "<i>by</i>"
	Christ, but also) "<i>for</i> Him" (CHRIST).
	<i>So entirely are the Father and Son one</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>).

<p><b>one Lord</b>—contrasted
	with the "many lords" of heathendom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10- :">Hebrews 2:10- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>by whom</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>we by him</b>—as all things
	are "<i>of</i>" the Father by creation, so they (we
	believers especially) are restored <i>to</i> Him by the new creation
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:5">Revelation 21:5</span>).
	Also, as all things are <i>by</i> Christ by creation, so they (we
	especially) are restored <i>by</i> Him by the new creation.</p>
