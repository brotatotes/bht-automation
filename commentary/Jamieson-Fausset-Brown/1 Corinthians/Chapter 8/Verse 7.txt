<p><b>7. Howbeit</b>—Though to us who
	"have knowledge" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:4-6">1 Corinthians 8:4-6</span>) all meats are
	indifferent, yet "this knowledge is not in all" in the same
	degree as we have it. Paul had admitted to the Corinthians that "we
	all have knowledge" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>),
	that is, so far as Christian <i>theory</i> goes; but <i>practically</i>
	some have it not in the same degree. 
	</p>
<p><b>with conscience</b>—an
	ancient reading; but other very old manuscripts read "association"
	or "habit." In either reading the meaning is: Some Gentile
	Christians, whether from old <i>association</i> of ideas or
	misdirected <i>conscience,</i> when they ate such meats, ate them
	with some feeling as if the idol were something real (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1- :">1 Corinthians 8:1- :</span>), and had changed the meats by the fact of the consecration
	into something either holy or else polluted. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto this hour</b>—after
	they have embraced Christianity; an implied censure, that they are
	not further advanced by this time in Christian "knowledge."
	</p>
<p><b>their conscience . . . is
	defiled</b>—by their eating it "as a thing offered to idols."
	If they ate it unconscious at the time that it had been offered to
	idols, there would be no defilement of conscience. But conscious of
	what it was, and not having such knowledge as other Corinthians
	boasted of, namely, that an idol is nothing and can therefore neither
	pollute nor sanctify meats, they by eating them sin against
	conscience (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1- :">1 Corinthians 8:1- :</span>). It was on the ground of Christian expediency, not to
	cause a stumbling-block to "weak" brethren, that the
	Jerusalem decree against partaking of such meats (though indifferent
	<i>in themselves</i>) was passed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1- :">1 Corinthians 8:1- :</span>). Hence he here vindicates it against the Corinthian
	asserters of an inexpedient liberty.</p>
