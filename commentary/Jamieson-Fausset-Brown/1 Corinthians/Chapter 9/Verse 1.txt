<p><b>1. Am I not an apostle? am I not
	free?</b>—The oldest manuscripts read the order thus, "Am I
	not free? am I not an apostle?" He alludes to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "this liberty of yours": If you claim it, I appeal
	to yourselves as the witnesses, have not I also it? "Am I not
	free?" If you be so, much more I. For "am I not an
	apostle?" so that I can claim not only Christian, but also
	apostolic, liberty.

<p><b>have I not seen
	Jesus</b>—<i>corporeally,</i> not in a mere vision: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, where the fact of the resurrection, which he wishes to
	prove, could only be established by an actual bodily appearance, such
	as was vouchsafed to Peter and the other apostles. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:7">Acts 9:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span> the contrast between
	"the men with him seeing <i>no man,</i>" and "Jesus
	that appeared unto thee in the way," shows that Jesus actually
	appeared to him in going to Damascus. His vision of Christ in the
	temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span>) was "in
	a trance." To be a witness of Christ's resurrection was a
	leading function of an apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17- :">Acts 22:17- :</span>). The best manuscripts omit "Christ."

<p><b>ye my work in the Lord</b>—Your
	conversion is His workmanship (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17- :">Acts 22:17- :</span>) through my instrumentality: the "seal of mine
	apostleship" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:2">1 Corinthians 9:2</span>).</p>
