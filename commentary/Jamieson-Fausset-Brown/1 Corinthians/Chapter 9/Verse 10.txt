<p><b>10. altogether</b>—Join this with
	"saith." "Does he (the divine lawgiver) by all means
	say it for our sakes?" It would be untrue, that God saith it
	<i>altogether</i> (in the sense of solely) for <i>our</i> sakes. But
	it is true, that He <i>by all means saith it</i> for our sakes as the
	ultimate object in the lower world. GROTIUS,
	however, translates, "mainly" or "especially,"
	instead of <i>altogether.</i>

<p><b>that</b>—"meaning

<p><b>should plough</b>—<i>ought</i>
	to plough in hope. The obligation rests with the people not to let
	their minister labor without remuneration.

<p><b>he that thresheth in hope
	should be partaker of his hope</b>—The oldest manuscript versions
	and Fathers read, "He that thresheth (<i>should</i> or <i>ought
	to thresh</i>) in the hope of partaking" (namely, <i>of the
	fruit of his threshing</i>). "He that plougheth,"
	spiritually, is the first planter of a church in a place (compare

	"he that thresheth," the minister who tends a church
	already planted.</p>
