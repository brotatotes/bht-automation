<p><b>11. we . . . we</b>â€”emphatical in
	the <i>Greek.</i> WE, the
	same persons who have sown to you the infinitely more precious
	treasures of the <i>Spirit,</i> may at least claim in return what is
	the only thing you have to give, namely, the goods that nourish the
	<i>flesh</i> ("<i>your</i> carnal things").</p>
