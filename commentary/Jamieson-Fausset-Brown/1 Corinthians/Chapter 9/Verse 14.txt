<p><b>14. Even so</b>—The only inference
	to be drawn from this passage is, not that the Christian ministry is
	of a sacrificial character as the Jewish priesthood, but simply, that
	as the latter was supported by the contributions of the people, so
	should the former. The stipends of the clergy were at first from
	voluntary offerings at the Lord's Supper. At the love-feast preceding
	it every believer, according to his ability, offered a gift; and when
	the expense of the table had been defrayed, the bishop laid aside a
	portion for himself, the presbyters, and deacons; and with the rest
	relieved widows, orphans, confessors, and the poor generally
	[TERTULLIAN, <i>Apology,</i>
	39]. The stipend was in proportion to the dignity and merits of the
	several bishops, presbyters, and deacons [CYPRIAN,
	c. 4, ep. 6].

<p><b>preach . . . gospel</b>—plainly
	marked as the duty of the Christian minister, in contrast to the
	<i>ministering about sacrifices</i> (<i>Greek</i>) <i>and waiting at
	the altar</i> of the Jewish priesthood and Levites (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). If the Lord's Supper were a <i>sacrifice</i> (as the Mass
	is supposed to be), this fourteenth verse would certainly have been
	worded so, to answer to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:13">1 Corinthians 9:13</span>.
	Note the same Lord Christ "ordains" the ordinances in the
	Old and in the New Testaments (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10">Matthew 10:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:7">Luke 10:7</span>).</p>
