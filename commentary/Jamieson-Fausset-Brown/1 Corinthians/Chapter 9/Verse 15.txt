<p><b>15.</b> Paul's special gift of
	continency, which enabled him to abstain from marriage, and his
	ability to maintain himself without interrupting seriously his
	ministry, made that expedient to him which is ordinarily inexpedient;
	namely, that the ministry should not be supported by the people. What
	to him was a duty, would be the opposite to one, for instance, to
	whom God had committed a family, without other means of support.

<p><b>I have used none of these
	things</b>—none of these "powers" or rights which I might
	have used (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:4-6">1 Corinthians 9:4-6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:12">1 Corinthians 9:12</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>neither</b>—rather, "<i>Yet</i>
	I have <i>not</i> written." 
	</p>
<p><b>so done unto me</b>—literally,
	"in my case": as is done in the case of a soldier, a
	planter, a shepherd, a ploughman, and a sacrificing priest (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:7">1 Corinthians 9:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:10">1 Corinthians 9:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:13">1 Corinthians 9:13</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>make my glorying void</b>—deprive
	me of my privilege of preaching the Gospel without remuneration (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:13- :">1 Corinthians 9:13- :</span>). Rather than hinder the progress of the Gospel by giving
	any pretext for a charge of interested motives (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:17">2 Corinthians 12:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:18">2 Corinthians 12:18</span>), Paul would "die"
	of hunger. Compare Abraham's similar disinterestedness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:22">Genesis 14:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:23">Genesis 14:23</span>).</p>
