<p><b>16. though I preach . . . I have
	nothing to glory of</b>â€”that is, If I preach the Gospel, and do so
	not gratuitously, I have no matter for "glorying." For the
	"necessity" that is laid on me to preach (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and the case of Jonah) does away with ground for
	"glorying." The sole ground for the latter that I have, is
	my preaching <i>without charge</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): since there is no necessity laid on me as to the latter,
	it is my voluntary act for the Gospel's sake.</p>
