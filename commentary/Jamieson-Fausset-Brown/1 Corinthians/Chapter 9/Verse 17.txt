17. Translate, "If I be
	doing this (that is, preaching) of my own accord (which I am not, for
	the 'necessity' is laid on me which binds a servant to obey his
	master), I have a reward; but if (as is the case) involuntarily
	(Acts 9:15; Acts 22:15;
	Acts 26:16); not of my own natural
	will, but by the constraining grace of God; (Romans 9:16;
	1 Timothy 1:13-16), I have had a
	dispensation (of the Gospel) entrusted to me" (and so can claim
	no "reward," seeing that I only "have done that which
	was my duty to do," Luke 17:10,
	but incur the "woe," Luke 17:10- :, if I fail in it).
