<p><b>18. What is my reward?</b>—The
	answer is in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:19">1 Corinthians 9:19</span>; namely,
	that by making the Gospel without charge, where I might have
	rightfully claimed maintenance, I might "win the more."

<p><b>of Christ</b>—The oldest

<p><b>abuse</b>—rather "that
	<i>I use</i> not <i>to the full</i> my power." This is his
	matter for "<i>glorying</i>"; the "<i>reward</i>"
	ultimately aimed at is the gaining of the more (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:19- :">1 Corinthians 9:19- :</span>). The former, as involving the latter, is verbally made the
	answer to the question, "What is my reward?" But really the
	"reward" is that which is the ultimate aim of his preaching
	without charge, namely, that he may gain the more; it was for this
	end, not to have matter of glorying, that he did so.</p>
