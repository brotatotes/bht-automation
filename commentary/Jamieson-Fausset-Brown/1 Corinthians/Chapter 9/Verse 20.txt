<p><b>20. I became as a Jew</b>—in
	things not defined by the <i>law,</i> but by Jewish usage. Not
	Judaizing in essentials, but in matters where there was no compromise
	of principle (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:3">Acts 16:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:20-26">Acts 21:20-26</span>); an
	undesigned coincidence between the history and the Epistle, and so a
	sure proof of genuineness. 
	</p>
<p><b>to them that are under the
	law, as under the law</b>—in things defined by <i>the law;</i> such
	as ceremonies not then repugnant to Christianity. Perhaps the reason
	for distinguishing this class from the former is that Paul himself
	belonged <i>nationally</i> to "the Jews," but did not in
	<i>creed</i> belong to the class of "them that are under the
	law." This view is confirmed by the reading inserted here by the
	oldest manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, "not being (that is,
	parenthetically, 'not that I am') myself under the law."</p>
