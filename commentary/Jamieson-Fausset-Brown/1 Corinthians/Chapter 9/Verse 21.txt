<p><b>21. To them . . . without law</b>—that
	is, without <i>revealed</i> law: the heathen (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:12">Romans 2:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:15">1 Corinthians 9:15</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>as without law</b>—not
	urging on them the ceremonies and "works of the law," but
	"the hearing of faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:15- :">1 Corinthians 9:15- :</span>). Also discoursing in their own manner, as at Athens, with
	arguments from their own poets (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:15- :">1 Corinthians 9:15- :</span>).

<p><b>being not without law to
	God</b>—"While thus conforming to others in matters
	indifferent, taking care not to be <i>without law</i> in relation to
	God, but <i>responsible to law</i> (literally, "IN
	LAW") in relation to Christ." This is the
	Christian's true position in relation to the world, to himself, and
	to God. Everything develops itself according to its proper law. So
	the Christian, though no longer subject to the literal law as
	constraining him from without, is subject to an inward principle or
	law, the spirit of faith in Christ acting from within as the germ of
	a new life. He does not in the <i>Greek</i> (as in <i>English
	Version</i>) say "<i>under the law</i> (as he does in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:15- :">1 Corinthians 9:15- :</span>) to Christ"; but uses the milder term, "in . . .
	law," <i>responsible to law.</i> Christ was responsible to the
	law for us, so that we are no longer responsible to it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>), but to Him, as the
	members to the Head (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:22">1 Corinthians 7:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:1-4">Romans 8:1-4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:16">1 Peter 2:16</span>).
	Christians serve Christ in newness of spirit, no longer in oldness of
	the letter (that is, the old <i>external</i> law <i>as such</i>), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:16- :">1 Peter 2:16- :</span>. To Christ, as man's Head, the Father has properly
	delegated His authority (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:27">John 5:27</span>); whence here he
	substitutes "Christ" for "God" in the second
	clause, "not without law <i>to God,</i> but under the law to
	<i>Christ.</i>" The law of Christ is the law of love (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:27- :">John 5:27- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:13">Galatians 5:13</span>).</p>
