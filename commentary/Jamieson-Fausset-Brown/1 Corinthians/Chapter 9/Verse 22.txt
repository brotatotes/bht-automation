	thinks the "weak" are not Christians at all, for these have
	been already "won"; but those outside the Church, who are
	yet "without strength" to believe (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:7- :">1 Corinthians 8:7- :</span>). But when "weak" <i>Christians</i> are by the
	condescending love of stronger brethren kept from falling from faith,
	they are well said to be "gained" or won.
