24. Know ye not—The Isthmian
	games, in which the foot race was a leading one, were of course well
	known, and a subject of patriotic pride to the Corinthians, who lived
	in the immediate neighborhood. These periodical games were to the
	Greeks rather a passion than a mere amusement: hence their
	suitableness as an image of Christian earnestness. 
	in a race—Greek,
	"in a race course." 
	all . . . one—Although
	we knew that one alone could be saved, still it Would be well worth
	our while to run [BENGEL].
	Even in the Christian race not "all" who enter on the race
	win (1 Corinthians 10:1-5). 
	So run, that ye may
	obtain—said parenthetically. These are the words in which the
	instructors of the young in the exercise schools (gymnasia)
	and the spectators on the race course exhorted their pupils to
	stimulate them to put forth all exertions. The gymnasium was a
	prominent feature in every Greek city. Every candidate had to take an
	oath that he had been ten months in training, and that he would
	violate none of the regulations (1 Corinthians 10:1-46.10.5- :; compare 1 Timothy 4:7;
	1 Timothy 4:8). He lived on a strict
	self-denying diet, refraining from wine and pleasant foods, and
	enduring cold and heat and most laborious discipline. The "prize"
	awarded by the judge or umpire was a chaplet of green leaves; at the
	Isthmus, those of the indigenous pine, for which parsley leaves were
	temporarily substituted (1 Corinthians 9:25).
	The Greek for "obtain" is fully obtain. It is
	in vain to begin, unless we persevere to the end (Matthew 10:22;
	Matthew 24:13; Revelation 2:10).
	The "so" expresses, Run with such perseverance in
	the heavenly course, as "all" the runners exhibit in the
	earthly "race" just spoken of: to the end that ye
	may attain the prize.
