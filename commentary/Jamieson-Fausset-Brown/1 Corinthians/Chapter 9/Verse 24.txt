<p><b>24. Know ye not</b>—The Isthmian
	games, in which the foot race was a leading one, were of course well
	known, and a subject of patriotic pride to the Corinthians, who lived
	in the immediate neighborhood. These periodical games were to the
	Greeks rather a passion than a mere amusement: hence their
	suitableness as an image of Christian earnestness. 
	</p>
<p><b>in a race</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in a race course." 
	</p>
<p><b>all . . . one</b>—Although
	we knew that one alone could be saved, still it Would be well worth
	our while to run [BENGEL].
	Even in the Christian race not "all" who enter on the race
	win (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:1-5">1 Corinthians 10:1-5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>So run, that ye may
	obtain</b>—said parenthetically. These are the words in which the
	instructors of the young in the exercise schools (<i>gymnasia</i>)
	and the spectators on the race course exhorted their pupils to
	stimulate them to put forth all exertions. The <i>gymnasium</i> was a
	prominent feature in every Greek city. Every candidate had to take an
	oath that he had been ten months in training, and that he would
	violate none of the regulations (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:1-46.10.5- :">1 Corinthians 10:1-46.10.5- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7">1 Timothy 4:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>). He lived on a strict
	self-denying diet, refraining from wine and pleasant foods, and
	enduring cold and heat and most laborious discipline. The "prize"
	awarded by the judge or umpire was a chaplet of green leaves; at the
	Isthmus, those of the indigenous pine, for which parsley leaves were
	temporarily substituted (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>).
	The <i>Greek</i> for "obtain" is <i>fully obtain.</i> It is
	in vain to begin, unless we persevere to the end (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:22">Matthew 10:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:13">Matthew 24:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>).
	The "so" expresses, Run <i>with such perseverance</i> in
	the heavenly course, as "all" the runners exhibit in the
	earthly "race" just spoken of: <i>to the end that</i> ye
	may attain the prize.</p>
