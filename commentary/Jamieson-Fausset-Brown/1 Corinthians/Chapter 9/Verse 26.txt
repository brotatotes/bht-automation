<p><b>26. I</b>—Paul returns to his main
	subject, <i>his own</i> self-denial, and his motive in it. 
	</p>
<p><b>run, not as uncertainly</b>—not
	as a runner uncertain of the goal. Ye Corinthians gain no end in your
	entering idol temples or eating idol meats. But <i>I,</i> for my
	part, in all my acts, whether in my becoming "all things to all
	men," or in receiving no sustenance from my converts, have a
	definite end in view, namely, to "gain the more." I know
	what 1 aim at, and how to aim at it. He who runs with a clear aim,
	looks straightforward to the goal, makes it his sole aim, casts away
	every encumbrance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>), is indifferent to what
	the by-standers say, and sometimes even a fall only serves to rouse
	him the more [BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>not as one that beateth the
	air</b>—instead of beating the adversary. Alluding to the
	<i>sciamachia</i> or <i>sparring in the school in sham-fight</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:9">1 Corinthians 14:9</span>), wherein
	they struck out into the air as if at an imaginary adversary. The
	real adversary is Satan acting on us through the flesh.</p>
