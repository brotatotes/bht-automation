<p><b>27. keep under</b>—literally,
	"bruise the face under the eyes," so as to render it black
	and blue; so, to <i>chastise</i> in the most sensitive part. Compare
	"<i>mortify</i> the deeds of the body," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:11">1 Peter 2:11</span>. It is
	not ascetic fasts or macerations of the body which are here
	recommended, but the <i>keeping under</i> of our natural
	self-seeking, so as, like Paul, to lay ourselves out entirely for the
	great work. 
	</p>
<p><b>my body</b>—the old man and
	the remainders of lust in my flesh. "My body," so far as by
	the <i>flesh</i> it opposes the <i>spirit</i> [ESTIUS]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span>). Men may be severe to
	their bodies and yet indulge their lust. Ascetic "neglect of the
	body" may be all the while a more subtile "satisfying of
	the flesh" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>).
	Unless the soul keep the body under, the body will get above the
	soul. The body may be made a good servant, but is a bad master. 
	</p>
<p><b>bring it into subjection</b>—or
	bondage, as a <i>slave</i> or servant <i>led away captive;</i> so the
	<i>Greek.</i>
</p>
<p><b>preached</b>—literally,
	"heralded." He keeps up the image from the races. The
	<i>heralds</i> summoned the candidates for the foot race into the
	race course [PLATO, <i>Laws,</i>
	8.833], and placed the crowns on the brows of the conquerors,
	announcing their names [BENGEL].
	They probably proclaimed also the laws of the combat; answering to
	the <i>preaching</i> of the apostles [ALFORD].
	The The <i>Christian</i> herald is also a <i>combatant,</i> in which
	respect he is distinguished from the herald at the games. 
	</p>
<p><b>a castaway</b>—failing
	shamefully of the prize myself, after I have <i>called</i> others to
	the contest. <i>Rejected</i> by God, the Judge of the Christian race,
	notwithstanding my having, by my preaching, led others to be
	accepted. Compare the equivalent term, "reprobate," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+6:30">Jeremiah 6:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:6">2 Corinthians 13:6</span>. Paul implies, if such
	earnest, self-denying watchfulness over himself be needed still, with
	all his labors for others, to make his own calling sure, much more is
	the same needed by the Corinthians, instead of their going, as they
	do, to the extreme limit of Christian liberty.</p>
