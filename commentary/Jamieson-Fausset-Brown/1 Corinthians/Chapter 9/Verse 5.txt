<p><b>5. lead about a sister, a wife</b>—that
	is, "a sister <i>as a wife</i>"; "a sister" by
	faith, which makes all believers brethren and sisters in the one
	family of God: "a wife" by marriage covenant. Paul implies
	he did not exercise his undoubted right to marry and "lead
	about" a believer, for the sake of Christian expediency, as well
	to save the Church the expense of maintaining her in his wide
	circuits, as also that he might give himself more undistractedly to
	building up the Church of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span>;

	Contrast the Corinthians' want of self-sacrifice in the exercise of
	their "liberty" at the cost of destroying, instead of
	edifying, the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:9">1 Corinthians 8:9</span>,

	that some of them had availed themselves of the power which they all
	had, of marrying. We know from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:9- :">1 Corinthians 8:9- :</span>, that Cephas (Peter) was a married man. A confutation of
	Peter's self-styled followers, the Romanists, who exclude the clergy
	from marriage. CLEMENT OF
	ALEXANDRIA [<i>Miscellanies,</i>
	7.63] records a tradition that he encouraged his wife when being led
	to death by saying, "Remember, my dear one, the Lord."

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:9">Galatians 1:9</span>). James, Joses, Simon,
	and Judas. Probably <i>cousins</i> of Jesus: as cousins were termed
	by the Jews "brethren." ALFORD
	makes them literally <i>brothers</i> of Jesus by Joseph and Mary.
