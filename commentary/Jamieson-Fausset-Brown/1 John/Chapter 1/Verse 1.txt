<p><b>1.</b> Instead of a formal, John
	adopts a virtual address (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). To wish <i>joy</i> to the reader was the ancient customary
	address. The sentence begun in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> is broken off by the parenthetic <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and is resumed at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>
	with the repetition of some words from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3- :">1 John 1:3- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>That which was</b>—not
	"began to be," but <i>was</i> essentially (<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>een,</i>" not "<i>egeneto</i>") before He was
	<i>manifested</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span>);
	answering to "Him that is <i>from the beginning</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2- :">1 John 1:2- :</span>); so John's Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2- :">1 John 1:2- :</span>, "In the beginning was the Word." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2- :">1 John 1:2- :</span>, "I was set up from everlasting, <i>from the beginning,</i>
	or ever the earth was." 
	</p>
<p><b>we</b>—apostles. 
	</p>
<p><b>heard . . . seen . . . looked
	upon . . . handled</b>—a series rising in gradation. <i>Seeing</i>
	is a more convincing proof than <i>hearing</i> of; <i>handling,</i>
	than even <i>seeing.</i> "<i>Have</i> heard . . . <i>have</i>
	seen" (perfect tenses), as a possession <i>still abiding</i>
	with us; but in <i>Greek</i> (not as <i>English Version</i> "have,"
	but simply) "looked upon" (not perfect tense, as of a
	<i>continuing</i> thing, but aorist, <i>past</i> time) while Christ
	the incarnate Word was still with us. "Seen," namely, His
	glory, as revealed in the Transfiguration and in His miracles; and
	His passion and death in a real body of flesh and blood. "Looked
	upon" as a wondrous spectacle steadfastly, deeply,
	contemplatively; so the <i>Greek.</i> Appropriate to John's
	contemplative character. 
	</p>
<p><b>hands . . . handled</b>—Thomas
	and the other disciples on distinct occasions after the resurrection.
	John himself had leaned on Jesus' breast at the last supper. Contrast
	the wisest of the heathen <i>feeling after</i> (the same <i>Greek</i>
	as here; <i>groping after</i> WITH
	THE HANDS") <i>if haply they might find God</i> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2- :">1 John 1:2- :</span>). This proves against Socinians he is here speaking of the
	<i>personal incarnate Word,</i> not of Christ's <i>teaching</i> from
	the beginning of His official life. 
	</p>
<p><b>of</b>—"concerning";
	following "heard." "Heard" is the verb most
	applying to the purpose of the Epistle, namely the truth which John
	had <i>heard concerning the Word of life,</i> that is, (Christ) <i>the
	Word</i> who is <i>the life.</i> "Heard," namely, from
	Christ Himself, including all Christ's teachings about Himself.
	Therefore he puts "of," or "concerning," before
	"the word of life," which is inapplicable to any of the
	verbs except "heard"; also "heard" is the only
	one of the verbs which he resumes at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2- :">1 John 1:2- :</span>.</p>
