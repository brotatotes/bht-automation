<p><b>we have not sinned</b>—referring
	to the commission of actual <i>sins,</i> even after regeneration and
	conversion; whereas in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span>,
	"we have no sin," refers to the present GUILT
	remaining (until cleansed) from the <i>actual sins</i> committed, and
	to the SIN of our corrupt
	old nature still adhering to us. The perfect "have . . . sinned"
	brings down the commission of sins to the present time, not merely
	sins committed <i>before,</i> but <i>since, conversion.</i>
</p>
<p><b>we make him a liar</b>—a
	gradation; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:6">1 John 1:6</span>, "we
	lie"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span>, "we
	deceive ourselves"; worst of all, "we make Him a liar,"
	by denying His word that all men are sinners (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8- :">1 John 1:8- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>his word is not in us</b>—"His
	word," which is "the truth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8- :">1 John 1:8- :</span>), accuses us truly; by denying it we drive it from our hearts
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:38">John 5:38</span>). Our
	rejection of "His word" in respect to our being sinners,
	implies as the consequence our rejection of His word and will
	revealed in the law and Gospel <i>as a whole;</i> for these
	throughout rest on the fact that <i>we have sinned,</i> and <i>have
	sin.</i></p>
