10. Parallel to  :-. 
	we have not sinned—referring
	to the commission of actual sins, even after regeneration and
	conversion; whereas in 1 John 1:8,
	"we have no sin," refers to the present GUILT
	remaining (until cleansed) from the actual sins committed, and
	to the SIN of our corrupt
	old nature still adhering to us. The perfect "have . . . sinned"
	brings down the commission of sins to the present time, not merely
	sins committed before, but since, conversion.
we make him a liar—a
	gradation; 1 John 1:6, "we
	lie"; 1 John 1:8, "we
	deceive ourselves"; worst of all, "we make Him a liar,"
	by denying His word that all men are sinners (compare 1 John 1:8- :). 
	his word is not in us—"His
	word," which is "the truth" (1 John 1:8- :), accuses us truly; by denying it we drive it from our hearts
	(compare John 5:38). Our
	rejection of "His word" in respect to our being sinners,
	implies as the consequence our rejection of His word and will
	revealed in the law and Gospel as a whole; for these
	throughout rest on the fact that we have sinned, and have
	sin.
