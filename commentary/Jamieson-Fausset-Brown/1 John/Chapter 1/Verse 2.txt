2. the life—Jesus, "the
	Word of life." 
	was manifested—who had
	previously been "with the Father." 
	show—Translate as in
	1 John 1:3, "declare"
	(compare 1 John 1:5). Declare
	is the general term; write is the particular (1 John 1:5- :). 
	that eternal life—Greek,
	"the life which is eternal." As the Epistle begins, so it
	ends with "eternal life," which we shall ever enjoy with,
	and in, Him who is "the life eternal." 
	which—Greek,
	"the which." the before-mentioned (1 John 1:5- :) life which was with the Father "from the
	beginning" (compare John 1:1).
	This proves the distinctness of the First and Second Persons in the
	one Godhead.
