<p><b>2. the life</b>—Jesus, "the
	Word of life." 
	</p>
<p><b>was manifested</b>—who had
	previously been "with the Father." 
	</p>
<p><b>show</b>—Translate as in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>, "declare"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>). <i>Declare</i>
	is the general term; <i>write</i> is the particular (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5- :">1 John 1:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that eternal life</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the life which is eternal." As the Epistle begins, so it
	ends with "eternal life," which we shall ever enjoy with,
	and in, Him who is "the life eternal." 
	</p>
<p><b>which</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the which." the before-mentioned (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5- :">1 John 1:5- :</span>) life <i>which</i> was with the Father "from the
	beginning" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>).
	This proves the distinctness of the First and Second Persons in the
	one Godhead.</p>
