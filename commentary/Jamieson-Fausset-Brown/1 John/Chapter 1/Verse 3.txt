<p><b>that ye also may have
	fellowship with us</b>—that <i>ye also</i> who have not seen, <i>may</i>
	have the <i>fellowship</i> with us which we who have seen enjoy; what
	that fellowship consists in he proceeds to state, "Our
	fellowship is with the Father and with His Son." Faith realizes
	what we have not seen as spiritually visible; not till by faith we
	too have seen, do we know all the excellency of the true Solomon. He
	Himself is ours; He in us and we in Him. We are "partakers of
	the divine nature." We know God only by having fellowship with
	Him; He may thus be <i>known,</i> but not <i>comprehended.</i> The
	repetition of "with" before the "Son,"
	distinguishes the <i>persons,</i> while the <i>fellowship</i> or
	<i>communion</i> with both <i>Father</i> and <i>Son,</i> implies
	their unity. It is not added "and with the Holy Ghost"; for
	it is <i>by</i> the Holy Ghost or Spirit of the Father and Son in us,
	that we are enabled to have <i>fellowship with the Father and Son</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span>). Believers
	enjoy the fellowship OF,
	but not WITH, the Holy
	Ghost. "Through Christ God closes up the chasm that separated
	Him from the human race, and imparts Himself to them in the communion
	of the divine life" [NEANDER].</p>
