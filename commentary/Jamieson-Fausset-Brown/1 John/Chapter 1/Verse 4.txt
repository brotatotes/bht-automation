<p><b>4. these things</b>—and none
	other, namely, this whole Epistle. 
	</p>
<p><b>write we unto you</b>—Some
	oldest manuscripts omit "unto you," and emphasize "we."
	Thus the antithesis is between "we" (apostles and
	eye-witnesses) and "your." <i>We</i> write thus that <i>your
	joy</i> may be full. Other oldest manuscripts and versions read "OUR
	joy," namely, <i>that our joy may be filled full by</i> bringing
	you also into fellowship with the Father and Son. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, end; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:2">Philippians 2:2</span>, "Fulfil
	ye my joy," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:16">Philippians 2:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:1">Philippians 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:8">2 John 1:8</span>).
	It is possible that "your" may be a correction of
	transcribers to make this verse harmonize with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:11">John 15:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:24">John 16:24</span>; however, as John often
	repeats favorite phrases, he may do so here, so "your" may
	be from himself. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:12">2 John 1:12</span>,
	"your" in oldest manuscripts. The authority of manuscripts
	and versions on both sides here is almost evenly balanced. Christ
	Himself is the source, object, and center of His people's joy
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:3">1 John 1:3</span>, end); it is in
	<i>fellowship with</i> Him that we have <i>joy,</i> the fruit of
	faith.</p>
