5. First division of the body of
	the Epistle (compare  :-). 
	declare—Greek,
	"announce"; report in turn; a different Greek word
	from 1 John 1:3. As the Son
	announced the message heard from the Father as His apostle, so the
	Son's apostles announce what they have heard from the Son. John
	nowhere uses the term "Gospel"; but the witness or
	testimony, the word, the truth, and here the message.
God is light—What light
	is in the natural world, that God, the source of even material light,
	is in the spiritual, the fountain of wisdom, purity, beauty, joy, and
	glory. As all material life and growth depends on light, so
	all spiritual life and growth depends on GOD.
	As God here, so Christ, in 1 John 2:8,
	is called "the true light." 
	no darkness at all—strong
	negation; Greek, "No, not even one speck of darkness";
	no ignorance, error, untruthfulness, sin, or death. John heard this
	from Christ, not only in express words, but in His acted words,
	namely, His is whole manifestation in the flesh as "the
	brightness of the Father's glory." Christ Himself was the
	embodiment of "the message," representing fully in all His
	sayings, doings, and sufferings, Him who is LIGHT.
