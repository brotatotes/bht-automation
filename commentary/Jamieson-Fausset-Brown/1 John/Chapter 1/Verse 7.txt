	<i>in the light,</i> the element in which God Himself is, constitutes

	speaking not of justification through His blood once for all, but of
	the <i>present sanctification</i> ("cleanseth" is <i>present</i>
	tense) which the believer, <i>walking in the light</i> and having
	<i>fellowship with God and the saints,</i> enjoys as His privilege.

	Christ's blood is the cleansing mean, whereby gradually, being
	already justified and in fellowship with God, we become <i>clean</i>
	from all sin which would mar our fellowship with God. Faith applies
	the cleansing, purifying blood. Some oldest manuscripts omit
	"Christ"; others retain it.</p>
