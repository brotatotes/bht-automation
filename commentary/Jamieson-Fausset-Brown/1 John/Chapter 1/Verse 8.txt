8. The confession of sins
	is a necessary consequence of "walking in the light" ( :-). "If thou shalt confess thyself a sinner, the truth
	is in thee; for the truth is itself light. Not yet has
	thy life become perfectly light, as sins are still in thee, but yet
	thou hast already begun to be illuminated, because there is in thee
	confession of sins" [AUGUSTINE].
	that we have no sin—"HAVE,"
	not "have had," must refer not to the past sinful
	life while unconverted, but to the present state wherein
	believers have sin even still. Observe, "sin" is in
	the singular; "(confess our) sins" ( :-) in the plural. Sin refers to the corruption of the
	old man still present in us, and the stain created by the
	actual sins flowing from that old nature in us. To confess our
	need of cleansing from present sin is essential to "walking
	in the light"; so far is the presence of some sin incompatible
	with our in the main "walking in light." But the
	believer hates, confesses, and longs to be delivered from all sin,
	which is darkness. "They who defend their sins, will see
	in the great day whether their sins can defend them." 
	deceive ourselves—We
	cannot deceive God; we only make ourselves to err from the right
	path. 
	the truth— ( :-). True faith. "The truth respecting God's holiness and
	our sinfulness, which is the very first spark of light in us, has no
	place in us" [ALFORD].
