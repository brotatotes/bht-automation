<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. THE ADVOCACY
	OF CHRIST IS
	OUR ANTIDOTE
	TO SIN WHILE
	WALKING IN THE LIGHT;
	FOR TO KNOW GOD,
	WE MUST
	KEEP HIS
	COMMANDMENTS AND LOVE
	THE BRETHREN, AND
	NOT LOVE
	THE WORLD, NOR
	GIVE HEED
	TO ANTICHRISTS, AGAINST
	WHOM OUR
	SAFETY IS
	THROUGH THE INWARD
	ANOINTING OF GOD
	TO ABIDE IN GOD:
	SO AT CHRIST'S
	COMING WE
	SHALL NOT
	BE ASHAMED.</p>
