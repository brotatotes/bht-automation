<p><b>My little children</b>—The
	diminutive expresses the tender affection of an aged pastor and
	spiritual father. <i>My own dear children,</i> that is, sons and
	daughters (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:12">1 John 2:12</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>these things</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:12- :">1 John 2:12- :</span>). My purpose in writing what I have just written is not
	that you should abuse them as giving a license to sin but, on the
	contrary, "in order that ye may not sin at all" (the <i>Greek</i>
	aorist, implying the absence not only of the habit, but of <i>single
	acts</i> of sin [ALFORD]).
	In order to "walk in the light" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>), the first step is
	<i>confession of sin</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:9">1 John 1:9</span>),
	the next (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>) is that we
	should <i>forsake all sin.</i> The divine purpose has for its aim,
	either to prevent the commission of, or to destroy sin [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>And,</b> c.—connected with
	the former <i>Furthermore,</i> "if any man sin," let him,
	while loathing and condemning it, not fear to go at once to God, the
	Judge, confessing it, for "we have an Advocate with Him."
	He is speaking of a BELIEVER'S
	<i>occasional</i> sins of infirmity through Satan's fraud and malice.
	The use of "we" immediately afterwards implies that <i>we
	all</i> are <i>liable</i> to this, though not necessarily constrained
	to sin. 
	</p>
<p><b>we have an advocate</b>—Advocacy
	is God's family blessing; other blessings He grants to good and bad
	alike, but justification, sanctification, continued intercession, and
	peace, He grants to His children alone. 
	</p>
<p><b>advocate</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>paraclete,</i>" the same term as is applied to the Holy
	Ghost, as the "other Comforter"; showing the unity of the
	Second and Third Persons of the Trinity. Christ is the Intercessor
	<i>for us</i> above; and, in His absence, here below the Holy Ghost
	is the other Intercessor <i>in us.</i> Christ's <i>advocacy</i> is
	inseparable from the Holy Spirit's <i>comfort</i> and working in us,
	as the spirit of intercessory prayer. 
	</p>
<p><b>righteous</b>—As our
	"advocate," Christ is not a mere suppliant petitioner. He
	pleads for us on the ground of <i>justice,</i> or <i>righteousness,</i>
	as well as mercy. Though He can say nothing good <i>of</i> us, He can
	say much <i>for</i> us. It is His <i>righteousness,</i> or obedience
	to the law, and endurance of its full penalty for us, on which He
	grounds His claim for our acquittal. The sense therefore is, "in
	that He is <i>righteous</i>"; in contrast to our <i>sin</i> ("if
	any man <i>sin</i>"). The Father, by raising Him from the dead,
	and setting Him at His own right, has once for all accepted Christ's
	claim for us. Therefore the accuser's charges against God's children
	are vain. "The righteousness of Christ stands on our side; for
	God's righteousness is, in Jesus Christ, ours" [LUTHER].</p>
