10. Abiding in love is
	abiding in the light; for the Gospel light not only
	illumines the understanding, but warms the heart into love. 
	none occasion of stumblingâ€”In
	contrast to, "He that hateth his brother is in darkness, and
	walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that
	darkness hath blinded his eyes." "In him who loves there is
	neither blindness nor occasion of stumbling [to himself]: in
	him who does not love, there is both blindness and occasion of
	stumbling. He who hates his brother, is both a stumbling-block to
	himself, and stumbles against himself and everything within and
	without; he who loves has an unimpeded path" [BENGEL].
	John has in mind Jesus' words, John 11:9;
	John 11:10. ALFORD
	well says, "The light and the darkness are within ourselves;
	admitted into us by the eye, whose singleness fills the whole body
	with light."
