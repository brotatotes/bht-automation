<p><b>12. little children</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"little <i>sons,</i>" or "dear sons and daughters";
	not the same <i>Greek</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "little <i>children,</i>" "infants" (in
	age and standing). He calls ALL
	to whom he writes, "little <i>sons</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, <i>Greek;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:28">1 John 2:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:18">1 John 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:4">1 John 4:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:21">1 John 5:21</span>); but only in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span> he uses the term "little
	children," or "infants." Our Lord, whose Spirit John
	so deeply drank into, used to His disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18- :">1 John 2:18- :</span>) the term "little sons," or <i>dear sons and
	daughters;</i> but in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:5">John 21:5</span>,
	"little children." It is an undesigned coincidence with the
	Epistle here, that in John's Gospel somewhat similarly the
	classification, "lambs, sheep, sheep," occurs.

<p><b>are forgiven</b>—"have
	been, and are forgiven you": ALL
	God's <i>sons and daughters</i> alike enjoy this privilege.</p>
