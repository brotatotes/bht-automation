<p><b>13, 14.</b> All three classes are
	first addressed in the present. "I write"; then in the past
	(aorist) tense, "I wrote" (not "I have written";
	moreover, in the oldest manuscripts and versions, in the end of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, it is past, "I wrote," not as <i>English Version,</i>
	"I write"). Two classes, "fathers" and "young
	men," are addressed with the same words each time (except that
	the address to the <i>young men</i> has an addition expressing the
	source and means of their victory); but the "little sons"
	and "little children" are differently addressed.

<p><b>have known</b>—and do know:
	so the <i>Greek</i> perfect means. The "I wrote" refers not
	to a former Epistle, but to this Epistle. It was an idiom to put the
	<i>past</i> tense, regarding the time from the <i>reader's</i> point
	of view; when he should receive the Epistle the writing would be
	<i>past.</i> When he uses "I write," he speaks from <i>his
	own</i> point of view.

<p><b>overcome</b>—The <i>fathers,</i>
	appropriately to their age, are characterized by <i>knowledge.</i>
	The <i>young men,</i> appropriately to theirs, by <i>activity in
	conflict.</i> The <i>fathers,</i> too, have <i>conquered;</i> but now
	their active service is past, and they and <i>the children</i> alike
	are characterized by <i>knowing</i> (the <i>fathers</i> know <i>Christ,</i>
	"Him that was from the beginning"; <i>the children</i> know
	the Father). The first thing that the <i>little children</i> realize
	is that God is their <i>Father;</i> answering in the parallel clause
	to "little sons . . . your sins are forgiven you for His name's
	sake," the universal first privilege of <i>all</i> those
	really-dear <i>sons</i> of God. Thus this latter clause includes <i>all,</i>
	whereas the former clause refers to those more especially who are in
	the <i>first</i> stage of spiritual life, "little children."
	Of course, these can only know <i>the Father</i> as theirs through
	<i>the Son</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>). It
	is beautiful to see how the <i>fathers</i> are characterized as
	reverting back to the first great truths of spiritual childhood, and
	the sum and ripest fruit of advanced experience, the <i>knowledge of
	Him that was from the beginning</i> (twice repeated, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:14">1 John 2:14</span>). Many of them had
	probably known <i>Jesus</i> in person, as well as by faith.</p>
