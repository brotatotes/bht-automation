<p><b>15. Love not the world</b>—that
	<i>lieth in the wicked one</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), whom ye young men <i>have overcome.</i> Having once for
	all, through <i>faith, overcome the world</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:4">1 John 4:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>), carry forward the
	conquest by not loving it. "The world" here means "man,
	and man's world" [ALFORD],
	in his and its state as <i>fallen from God.</i> "God loved [with
	the love of <i>compassion</i>] the world," and we should feel
	the same kind of love for the fallen world; but we are <i>not</i> to
	<i>love</i> the world with <i>congeniality</i> and <i>sympathy</i> in
	its alienation from God; we cannot have this latter kind of love for
	the God-estranged world, and yet have also "the love of the
	Father in" us. 
	</p>
<p><b>neither</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"nor yet." A man might deny in general that he <i>loved the
	world,</i> while keenly following some one of THE
	THINGS IN IT: its riches, honors, or pleasures; this clause
	prevents him escaping from conviction. 
	</p>
<p><b>any man</b>—therefore the
	warning, though primarily addressed to the young, applies to <i>all.</i>
</p>
<p><b>love of</b>—that is,
	<i>towards</i> "the Father." The two, God and the (sinful)
	world, are so opposed, that both cannot be congenially loved at once.</p>
