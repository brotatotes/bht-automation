<p><b>abideth for ever</b>—"even
	as God also abideth for ever" (with whom the godly is one;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:19">Psalms 55:19</span>, "God,
	even He that abideth of old): a true <i>comment,</i> which CYPRIAN
	and LUCIFER have added to
	the <i>text</i> without support of <i>Greek</i> manuscripts. In
	contrast to the three <i>passing</i> lusts of the world, the doer of
	God's will has three <i>abiding</i> goods, "riches, honor, and
	life" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+22:4">Proverbs 22:4</span>).</p>
