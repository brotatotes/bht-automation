<p><b>18. Little children</b>—same <i>Greek</i>
	as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span>; children <i>in
	age.</i> After the <i>fathers</i> and <i>young men</i> were gone,
	"the last time" with its "many Antichrists" was
	about to come suddenly on <i>the children.</i> "In this <i>last
	hour</i> we all even still live" [BENGEL].
	Each successive age has had in it some of the signs of "the last
	time" which precedes Christ's coming, in order to keep the
	Church in continual waiting for the Lord. The connection with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13- :">1 John 2:13- :</span> is: There are coming those seducers who are of the world
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:5">1 John 4:5</span>), and would tempt you
	to go out from us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:19">1 John 2:19</span>)
	and deny Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>as ye have heard</b>—from
	the apostles, preachers of the Gospel (for example, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22- :">1 John 2:22- :</span>; and in the region of Ephesus, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:29">Acts 20:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:30">Acts 20:30</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>shall come</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"cometh," namely, out of his own place. <i>Antichrist</i>
	is interpreted in two ways: a false Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>), literally, "<i>instead</i>
	of Christ"; or an <i>adversary</i> of Christ, literally,
	"<i>against</i> Christ." As John never uses <i>pseudo-Christ,</i>
	or "false Christ," for <i>Antichrist,</i> it is plain he
	means an <i>adversary of Christ,</i> claiming to himself what belongs
	to Christ, and wishing to substitute himself for Christ as the
	supreme object of worship. He <i>denies the Son,</i> not merely, like
	the pope, acts in the name of the Son, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24- :">Matthew 24:24- :</span>, "Who <i>opposeth</i> himself (<i>Greek,</i> "
	ANTI-<i>keimenos</i>")
	[to] all that is called God," decides this. For God's great
	truth, "God is man," he would substitute his own lie, "man
	is God" [TRENCH]. 
	</p>
<p><b>are there</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"there have begun to be"; there have arisen. These "many
	Antichrists" answer to "the spirit of lawlessness (<i>Greek</i>)
	doth already work." The Antichristian principle appeared then,
	as now, in evil men and evil teachings and writings; but still "THE
	Antichrist" means a hostile <i>person,</i> even as "THE
	Christ" is a personal Saviour. As "cometh" is used of
	Christ, <i>so</i> here of Antichrist, the embodiment in his own
	person of all the Antichristian features and spirit of those "many
	Antichrists" which have been, and are, his forerunners. John
	uses the singular of him. No other New Testament writer uses the
	term. He probably answers to "the little horn having the eyes of
	a man, and speaking great things" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:8">Daniel 7:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:20">Daniel 7:20</span>); "the man of sin,
	son of perdition" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>);
	"the beast ascending out of the bottomless pit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:7">Revelation 11:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>), or rather, "the
	false prophet," the same as "the second beast coming up out
	of the earth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11-18">Revelation 13:11-18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:13">Revelation 16:13</span>).</p>
