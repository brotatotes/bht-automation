19. out from us—from our
	Christian communion. Not necessarily a formal secession or going
	out: thus Rome has spiritually gone out, though formally
	still of the Christian Church. 
	not of us—by spiritual
	fellowship (1 John 1:3). "They
	are like bad humors in the body of Christ, the Church: when they are
	vomited out, then the body is relieved; the body of Christ is now
	still under treatment, and has not yet attained the perfect soundness
	which it shall have only at the resurrection" [AUGUSTINE,
	Ten Homilies on the First Epistle of John, Homily 3.4]. 
	they would . . . have
	continued—implying the indefectibility of grace in the elect.
	"Where God's call is effectual, there will be sure perseverance"
	[CALVIN]. Still, it is no
	fatal necessity, but a "voluntary necessity" [DIDYMUS],
	which causes men to remain, or else go from the body of Christ. "We
	are either among the members, or else among the bad humors. It is of
	his own will that each is either an Antichrist, or in Christ"
	[AUGUSTINE]. Still God's
	actings in eternal election harmonize in a way inexplicable to us,
	with man's free agency and responsibility. It is men's own evil will
	that chooses the way to hell; it is God's free and sovereign grace
	that draws any to Himself and to heaven. To God the latter shall
	ascribe wholly their salvation from first to last: the former shall
	reproach themselves alone, and not God's decree, with their
	condemnation (1 John 3:9; 1 John 5:18).
	that they were not all of
	us—This translation would imply that some of the Antichrists
	are of us! Translate, therefore, "that all (who are for a
	time among us) are not of us." Compare 1 John 5:18- :, "There must be heresies among you, that they which
	are approved may be made manifest among you." For "were"
	some of the oldest manuscripts read "are." Such occasions
	test who are, and who are not, the Lord's people.
