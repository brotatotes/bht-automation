	vomited out, then the body is relieved; the body of Christ is now
	still under treatment, and has not yet attained the perfect soundness

	"Where God's call is effectual, there will be sure perseverance"
	[CALVIN]. Still, it is no
	fatal necessity, but a "voluntary necessity" [DIDYMUS],
	which causes men to remain, or else go from the body of Christ. "We
	are either among the members, or else among the bad humors. It is of
	his own will that each is either an Antichrist, or in Christ"
	[AUGUSTINE]. Still God's
	actings in eternal election harmonize in a way <i>inexplicable to us,</i>
	with man's free agency and responsibility. It is men's own evil will
	that chooses the way to hell; it is God's free and sovereign grace
	that draws any to Himself and to heaven. To God the latter shall
	ascribe wholly their salvation from first to last: the former shall
	reproach themselves alone, and not God's decree, with their
	condemnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9">1 John 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:18">1 John 5:18</span>).
