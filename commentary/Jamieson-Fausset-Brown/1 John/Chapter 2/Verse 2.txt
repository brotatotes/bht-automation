<p><b>2. And he</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "And
	<i>Himself.</i>" He is our all-prevailing Advocate, because He
	is <i>Himself</i> "the propitiation"; <i>abstract,</i> as
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>: He is to us <i>all
	that is needed for propitiation</i> "in behalf of our sins";
	<i>the propitiatory sacrifice,</i> provided by the Father's love,
	removing the estrangement, and appeasing the righteous wrath, on
	God's part, against the sinner. "There is no incongruity that a
	father should be <i>offended</i> with that son whom he loveth, and at
	that time offended with him when he <i>loveth</i> him" [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. The only other
	place in the New Testament where <i>Greek</i> "propitiation"
	occurs, is <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span>; it answers
	in the <i>Septuagint</i> to <i>Hebrew,</i> "<i>caphar,</i>"
	to <i>effect an atonement</i> or <i>reconciliation</i> with God; and
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+44:29">Ezekiel 44:29</span>, to the <i>sin
	offering.</i> In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>,
	<i>Greek,</i> it is "propitiatory," that is, the mercy
	seat, or lid of the ark whereon God, represented by the Shekinah
	glory above it, met His people, represented by the high priest who
	sprinkled the blood of the sacrifice on it.

<p><b>ours</b>—believers: not
	<i>Jews,</i> in contrast to Gentiles; for he is not writing to Jews
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:21">1 John 5:21</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>also for the sins of the
	whole world</b>—Christ's "advocacy" is limited to
	<i>believers</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7">1 John 1:7</span>): His <i>propitiation</i>
	extends as widely as <i>sin</i> extends: see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7- :">1 John 1:7- :</span>, "denying the Lord that <i>bought them.</i>" "The
	whole world" cannot be restricted to the <i>believing</i>
	portion of the world (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7- :">1 John 1:7- :</span>; and "the whole world," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:7- :">1 John 1:7- :</span>). "Thou, too, art part of the world, so that thine
	heart cannot deceive itself and think, The Lord died for Peter and
	Paul, but not for me" [LUTHER].</p>
