20. But—Greek, "And."
	He here states the means which they as believers have wherewith to
	withstand. Antichrists ( :-), namely, the chrism (so the Greek: a play
	upon similar sounds), or "anointing unguent," namely, the
	Holy Spirit (more plainly mentioned further on, as in John's style,
	1 John 3:24; 1 John 4:13;
	1 John 5:6), which they ("ye"
	is emphatical in contrast to those apostates, 1 John 5:6- :) have "from the Holy One, Christ" (John 1:33;
	John 3:34; John 15:26;
	John 16:14): "the righteous"
	(1 John 2:1), "pure" (1 John 2:1- :), "the Holy One" (1 John 2:1- :) "of God"; 1 John 2:1- :. Those anointed of God in Christ alone can resist
	those anointed with the spirit of Satan, Antichrists, who
	would sever them from the Father and from the Son. Believers have the
	anointing Spirit from the Father also, as well as from the
	Son; even as the Son is anointed therewith by the Father. Hence the
	Spirit is the token that we are in the Father and in the Son; without
	it a man is none of Christ. The material unguent of costliest
	ingredients, poured on the head of priests and kings, typified this
	spiritual unguent, derived from Christ, the Head, to us, His members.
	We can have no share in Him as Jesus, except we become truly
	Christians, and so be in Him as Christ, anointed with
	that unction from the Holy One. The Spirit poured on Christ, the
	Head, is by Him diffused through all the members. "It appears
	that we all are the body of Christ, because we all are
	anointed: and we all in Him are both Christ's and Christ,
	because in some measure the whole Christ is Head and body."
	and—therefore. 
	ye know all things—needful
	for acting aright against Antichrist's seductions, and for Christian
	life and godliness. In the same measure as one hath the Spirit,
	in that measure (no more and no less) he knows all these things.
