<p><b>21. but because ye know it, and
	that,</b> &amp;c.â€”Ye not <i>only know</i> what is the truth
	(concerning the Son and the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), but also are able to detect a lie as a thing opposed to
	the truth. For right (a straight line) is the index of itself and of
	what is crooked [ESTIUS].
	The <i>Greek</i> is susceptible of ALFORD'S
	translation, "Because ye know it, and <i>because</i> no lie is
	of the truth" (literally, "every lie is excluded from being
	of the truth"). I therefore wrote (in this Epistle) to point out
	what the lie is, and who the liars are.</p>
