<p><b>22. a liar</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "Who
	is the liar?" namely, guilty of <i>the</i> lie just mentioned
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:21">1 John 2:21</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that Jesus is the Christ</b>—the
	grand central truth. 
	</p>
<p><b>He is Antichrist</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the</i> Antichrist"; not however here <i>personal,</i>
	but in the abstract; the ideal of Antichrist is "he that denieth
	the Father and the Son." To deny the latter is virtually to deny
	the former. Again, the truth as to the Son must be held in its
	integrity; to deny that Jesus is the Christ, or that He is the Son of
	God, or that He came in the flesh, invalidates the whole (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:21- :">1 John 2:21- :</span>).</p>
