<p><b>23.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "Every
	one who denieth the Son, hath not the Father either" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span>): "inasmuch as God
	hath given Himself to us wholly to be enjoyed in Christ"
	[CALVIN].

<p><b>he</b>—<i>that
	acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.</i> These words ought not
	to be in italics, as though they were not in the original: for the
	oldest <i>Greek</i> manuscripts have them. 
	</p>
<p><b>hath</b>—namely, in his
	abiding possession as his "portion"; by living personal
	"fellowship." 
	</p>
<p><b>acknowledgeth</b>—by open
	confession of Christ.</p>
