<p><b>27. But</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "And
	you (contrasting the believing readers with the <i>seducers;</i> the
	words 'and you' stand prominent, the construction of the sentence
	following being altered, and no verb agreeing with 'and you' until
	'need not') . . . the anointing," c. (resumed from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>received of him</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). So we "are unto God a sweet savor of Christ." 
	</p>
<p><b>abideth in you</b>—He
	tacitly thus admonishes them to say, when tempted by seducers, "The
	anointing abideth in us we do not need a teacher [for we have the
	Holy Spirit as our teacher, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:34">Jeremiah 31:34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:45">John 6:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:13">John 16:13</span>];
	it teaches us the truth; in that teaching we will abide"
	[BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>and</b>—and therefore. God
	is sufficient for them who are taught of Him; they are independent of
	all others, though, of course, not declining the Christian counsel of
	faithful ministers. "Mutual communication is not set aside, but
	approved of, in the case of those who are partakers of the anointing
	in one body" [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>the same anointing</b>—which
	ye once for all received, and which now still abides in you. 
	</p>
<p><b>of</b>—"concerning."
	</p>
<p><b>all things</b>—essential to
	salvation; the point under discussion. Not that the believer is made
	infallible, for no believer here receives the Spirit in all its
	fulness, but only the measure needful for keeping him from
	soul-destroying error. So the Church, though having the Spirit in
	her, is not infallible (for many fallible members can never make an
	infallible whole), but is kept from ever wholly losing the saving
	truth. 
	</p>
<p><b>no lie</b>—as Antichristian
	teaching. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye shall abide in him</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:24">1 John 2:24</span>, end); even as "the
	anointing abideth in you." The oldest manuscripts read the
	imperative, "<i>abide</i> in Him."</p>
