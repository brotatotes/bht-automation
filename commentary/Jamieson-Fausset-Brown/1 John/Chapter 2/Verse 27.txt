	you (contrasting the believing readers with the seducers; the
	words 'and you' stand prominent, the construction of the sentence
	following being altered, and no verb agreeing with 'and you' until
	'need not') . . . the anointing," c. (resumed from  :-).

	tacitly thus admonishes them to say, when tempted by seducers, "The
	anointing abideth in us we do not need a teacher [for we have the
	Holy Spirit as our teacher, Jeremiah 31:34;
	John 6:45; John 16:13];

	her, is not infallible (for many fallible members can never make an
	infallible whole), but is kept from ever wholly losing the saving
	truth.

	anointing abideth in you." The oldest manuscripts read the
	imperative, "abide in Him."
