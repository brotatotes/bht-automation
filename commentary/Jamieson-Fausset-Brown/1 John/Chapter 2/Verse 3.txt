<p><b>3. hereby</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "in
	this." "It is <i>herein,</i>" and herein only, that we
	know (present tense) that we have knowledge of (perfect tense,
	once-for-all obtained and continuing <i>knowledge of</i>) <i>Him</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:4">1 John 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:14">1 John 2:14</span>). Tokens whereby to
	discern grace are frequently given in this Epistle. The Gnostics, by
	the Spirit's prescient forewarning, are refuted, who boasted of
	<i>knowledge,</i> but set aside <i>obedience.</i> "Know Him,"
	namely, as "the righteous" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:29">1 John 2:29</span>); our "Advocate and
	Intercessor." 
	</p>
<p><b>keep</b>—John's favorite
	word, instead of "do," literally, "watch,"
	"guard," and "keep safe" as a precious thing;
	observing so as to keep. So Christ Himself. Not faultless conformity,
	but hearty acceptance of, and willing subjection to, God's whole
	revealed will, is meant. 
	</p>
<p><b>commandments</b>—<i>injunctions</i>
	of faith, love, and obedience. John never uses "the law" to
	express the rule of Christian obedience: he uses it as the Mosaic
	law.</p>
