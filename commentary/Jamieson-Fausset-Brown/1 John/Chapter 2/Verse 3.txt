3. hereby—Greek, "in
	this." "It is herein," and herein only, that we
	know (present tense) that we have knowledge of (perfect tense,
	once-for-all obtained and continuing knowledge of) Him"
	(1 John 2:4; 1 John 2:13;
	1 John 2:14). Tokens whereby to
	discern grace are frequently given in this Epistle. The Gnostics, by
	the Spirit's prescient forewarning, are refuted, who boasted of
	knowledge, but set aside obedience. "Know Him,"
	namely, as "the righteous" (1 John 2:1;
	1 John 2:29); our "Advocate and
	Intercessor." 
	keep—John's favorite
	word, instead of "do," literally, "watch,"
	"guard," and "keep safe" as a precious thing;
	observing so as to keep. So Christ Himself. Not faultless conformity,
	but hearty acceptance of, and willing subjection to, God's whole
	revealed will, is meant. 
	commandments—injunctions
	of faith, love, and obedience. John never uses "the law" to
	express the rule of Christian obedience: he uses it as the Mosaic
	law.
