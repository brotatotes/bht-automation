	is the love of (that is towards) God perfected," and "we
	are in Him." <i>Love</i> here answers to <i>knowledge</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:3- :">1 John 2:3- :</span>. In proportion as we love God, in that same proportion we
	<i>know</i> Him, and vice versa, until our <i>love and knowledge</i>

	Him"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:5">1 John 2:5</span>, "we <i>are</i>
