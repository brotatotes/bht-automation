<p><b>7. Brethren</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts and versions read instead, "Beloved,"
	appropriate to the subject here, <i>love.</i>
</p>
<p><b>no new commandment</b>—namely,
	<i>love,</i> the main principle of walking <i>as Christ walked</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:6">1 John 2:6</span>), and that commandment,
	of which one exemplification is presently given, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:9">1 John 2:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:10">1 John 2:10</span>, <i>the love of
	brethren.</i>
</p>
<p><b>ye had from the
	beginning</b>—from the time that ye first heard the Gospel word
	preached.</p>
