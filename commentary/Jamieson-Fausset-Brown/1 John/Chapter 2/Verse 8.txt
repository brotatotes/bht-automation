<p><b>8. a new commandment</b>—It was
	"old," in that <i>Christians</i> as such had heard it <i>from
	the first;</i> but "new" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>kaine,</i>"
	not "<i>nea</i>": <i>new and different</i> from the <i>old</i>
	legal precept) in that it was first <i>clearly</i> promulgated with
	Christianity; though the inner <i>spirit</i> of the law was <i>love</i>
	even to enemies, yet it was enveloped in some bitter precepts which
	caused it to be temporarily almost unrecognized, till the Gospel
	came. Christianity first put <i>love to brethren</i> on the <i>new</i>
	and highest MOTIVE,
	instinctive love to Him who first loved us, constraining us to love
	all, even enemies, thereby walking in the steps of Him who loved us
	when enemies. So Jesus calls it "new," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:35">John 13:35</span>, "Love one another
	<i>as I have loved you</i>" (the new motive); <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:35- :">John 13:35- :</span>.

<p><b>which thing is true in him
	and in you</b>—"<i>In Christ</i> all things are always true,
	and were so from the beginning; but <i>in Christ and in us</i>
	conjointly <i>the commandment</i> [the love of brethren] <i>is then
	true</i> when we acknowledge the truth which is <i>in Him,</i> and
	have the same flourishing <i>in us</i>" [BENGEL].
	ALFORD explains, "Which
	thing (<i>the fact that the commandment is a new one</i>) is true in
	Him and in you because the darkness is <i>passing away,</i> and the
	true light is now shining; that is, the commandment <i>is a new one,</i>
	and this is true both in the case of Christ and in the case of you;
	because <i>in you</i> the darkness is passing away, and <i>in Him</i>
	the true light is shining; therefore, on both accounts, the command
	is a <i>new one:</i> new as regards you, because you are newly come
	from darkness into light; new as regards Him, because He uttered it
	when He came into the world to lighten every man, and began that
	shining which even now continues." I prefer, as BENGEL,
	to explain, The <i>new commandment</i> finds its <i>truth</i> in its
	practical <i>realization</i> in the walk of Christians in union with
	Christ. Compare the use of "verily," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:35- :">John 13:35- :</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:42">John 4:42</span>, "indeed";
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:55">John 6:55</span>. The repetition of
	"in" before "you," "in Him and in you,"
	not "in Him and you" implies that the love commandment
	finds its realization <i>separately:</i> first it did so "<i>in
	Him,</i>" and then it does so "in us," in so far as we
	now "also walk even as He walked"; and yet it finds its
	realization also <i>conjointly,</i> by the two being united in one
	sentence, even as it is by virtue of the love commandment having been
	first fulfilled <i>in Him,</i> that it is also now fulfilled <i>in
	us,</i> through His Spirit in us: compare a similar case, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:55- :">John 6:55- :</span>, "<i>My Father</i> and <i>your</i> Father"; by
	virtue of His being "<i>My</i> Father," He is also <i>your</i>
	Father. 
	</p>
<p><b>darkness is past</b>—rather,
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:17">1 John 2:17</span>, "is
	passing away." It shall not be wholly "past" until
	"the Sun of righteousness" shall arise <i>visibly;</i> "the
	light is now shining" <i>already,</i> though but partially until
	the day bursts forth.</p>
