<p><b>1. Behold</b>—calling attention,
	as to some wonderful exhibition, little as the world sees to admire.
	This verse is connected with the previous <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, thus: All our <i>doing of righteousness</i> is a mere sign
	that God, of His matchless love, has adopted us as children; it does
	not save us, but is a proof that we are saved of His grace. 
	</p>
<p><b>what manner of</b>—of what
	surpassing excellence, how gracious on His part, how precious to us. 
	</p>
<p><b>love . . . bestowed</b>—He
	does not say that God hath given us some gift, but <i>love itself</i>
	and the fountain of all honors, the heart itself, and that not for
	our works or efforts, but of His grace [LUTHER].
	</p>
<p><b>that</b>—"what manner
	of love"; resulting in, proved by, our being, &amp;c. The
	immediate <i>effect aimed at</i> in the bestowal of this love is,
	"<i>that</i> we should be called children of God." 
	</p>
<p><b>should be called</b>—should
	have received the privilege of such a glorious <i>title</i> (though
	seeming so imaginary to the world), along with the glorious <i>reality.</i>
	With God <i>to call</i> is to <i>make really to be.</i> Who so great
	as God? What nearer relationship than that of <i>sons?</i> The oldest
	manuscripts add, "And we ARE
	SO" really. 
	</p>
<p><b>therefore</b>—"on this
	account," because "we are (really) so." 
	</p>
<p><b>us</b>—the children, like
	the Father. 
	</p>
<p><b>it knew him not</b>—namely,
	the Father. "If they who regard not God, hold thee in any
	account, feel alarmed about thy state" [BENGEL].
	Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span>. The world's
	whole course is one great act of non-recognition of God.</p>
