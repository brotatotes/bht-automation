<p><b>11. the message</b>â€”"announcement,"
	as of something good; not a mere <i>command,</i> as the law. The
	Gospel <i>message</i> of Him who loved us, announced by His servants,
	is, that we <i>love the brethren;</i> not here all mankind, but those
	who are our brethren in Christ, children of the same family of God,
	of whom we have been born anew.</p>
