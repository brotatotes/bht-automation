11. the messageâ€”"announcement,"
	as of something good; not a mere command, as the law. The
	Gospel message of Him who loved us, announced by His servants,
	is, that we love the brethren; not here all mankind, but those
	who are our brethren in Christ, children of the same family of God,
	of whom we have been born anew.
