<p><b>14. We</b>—emphatical; hated
	though we be by the world, <i>we</i> know what the world knows not. 
	</p>
<p><b>know</b>—as an assured
	fact. 
	</p>
<p><b>passed</b>—<i>changed our
	state.</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:13">Colossians 1:13</span>, "from
	the power of darkness . . . translated into the kingdom of His dear
	Son." 
	</p>
<p><b>from death unto
	life</b>—literally, "<i>out of the</i> death (which enthrals
	the unregenerate) <i>into the</i> life (of the regenerate)." A
	palpable coincidence of language and thought, the beloved disciple
	adopting his Lord's words. 
	</p>
<p><b>because we love the
	brethren</b>—the ground, not of our <i>passing over out of death
	into life,</i> but of our <i>knowing</i> that we have so. <i>Love,</i>
	on our part, is the <i>evidence</i> of our justification and
	regeneration, not the <i>cause</i> of them. "Let each go to his
	own heart; if he find there love to the brethren, let him feel
	assured that he has passed from death unto life. Let him not mind
	that his glory is only hidden; when the Lord shall come, then shall
	he appear in glory. For he has vital energy, but it is still
	wintertime; the root has vigor, but the branches are as it were dry;
	within there is marrow which is vigorous, within are leaves, within
	fruits, but they must wait for summer" [AUGUSTINE].
	</p>
<p><b>He that loveth not</b>—Most
	of the oldest manuscripts omit "his brother," which makes
	the statement more general. 
	</p>
<p><b>abideth</b>—still. 
	</p>
<p><b>in death</b>—"in <i>the</i>
	(spiritual) death" (ending in eternal death) which is the state
	of all by nature. His want of <i>love</i> evidences that no saving
	change has passed over him.</p>
