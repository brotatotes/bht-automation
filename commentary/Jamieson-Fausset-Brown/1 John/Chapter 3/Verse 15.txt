	there is no medium between the two. "Love and hatred, like light
	and darkness, life and death, necessarily replace, as well as
	necessarily exclude, one another" [ALFORD].

<p><b>is a murderer</b>—because
	indulging in that passion, which, if followed out to its natural
	consequences, would make him one. "Whereas, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:14- :">1 John 3:14- :</span> desires us to lay down our lives for the brethren; <i>duels</i>
	require one (awful to say!) to risk <i>his own</i> life, rather than
	not deprive <i>another</i> of life" [BENGEL].
	God regards the inward disposition as tantamount to the outward act
	which would flow from it. Whomsoever one hates, one wishes to be
	dead.

	"abideth in death." It is not his <i>future</i> state, but
	his <i>present,</i> which is referred to. He who hates (that is,
	loveth not) his brother (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:14">1 John 3:14</span>),
	cannot in this his present state have eternal life abiding in him.</p>
