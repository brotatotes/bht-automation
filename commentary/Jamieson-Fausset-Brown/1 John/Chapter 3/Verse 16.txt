<p><b>16.</b> What true <i>love to the
	brethren</i> is, illustrated by the love of Christ to us.

<p><b>Hereby</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Herein." 
	</p>
<p><b>the love </b><i><b>of God</b></i><b>
</b>—The words "of God" are not in the original.
	Translate, "We arrive at the knowledge of love"; we
	apprehend what true love is. 
	</p>
<p><b>he</b>—Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>and we</b>—on our part, if
	absolutely needed for the glory of God, the good of the Church, or
	the salvation of a brother. 
	</p>
<p><b>lives</b>—Christ alone laid
	down His one <i>life</i> for us all; we ought to lay down our <i>lives</i>
	severally for the lives of the brethren; if not actually, at least
	virtually, by giving our time, care, labors, prayers, substance: <i>Non
	nobis, sed omnibus.</i> Our life ought not to be dearer to us than
	God's own Son was to Him. The apostles and martyrs acted on this
	principle.</p>
