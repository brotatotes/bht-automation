16. What true love to the
	brethren is, illustrated by the love of Christ to us. 
	Hereby—Greek,
	"Herein." 
	the love of God
—The words "of God" are not in the original.
	Translate, "We arrive at the knowledge of love"; we
	apprehend what true love is. 
	he—Christ. 
	and we—on our part, if
	absolutely needed for the glory of God, the good of the Church, or
	the salvation of a brother. 
	lives—Christ alone laid
	down His one life for us all; we ought to lay down our lives
	severally for the lives of the brethren; if not actually, at least
	virtually, by giving our time, care, labors, prayers, substance: Non
	nobis, sed omnibus. Our life ought not to be dearer to us than
	God's own Son was to Him. The apostles and martyrs acted on this
	principle.
