<p><b>17. this world's good</b>—literally,
	"livelihood" or substance. If we ought to lay down our

	<i>spectacle</i> of his brother's need. The "bowels" mean

<p><b>how</b>—<i>How</i> is it
	possible that "the love of (that is, '<i>to</i>') God dwelleth
	(<i>Greek,</i> 'abideth') in him?" Our superfluities should
	yield to the necessities; our comforts, and even our necessaries in
	some measure, should yield to the extreme wants of our brethren.
