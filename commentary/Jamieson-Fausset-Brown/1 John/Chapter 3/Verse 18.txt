18. When the venerable John
	could no longer walk to the meetings of the Church but was borne
	thither by his disciples, he always uttered the same address to the
	Church; he reminded them of that one commandment which he had
	received from Christ Himself, as comprising all the rest, and forming
	the distinction of the new covenant, "My little children, love
	one another." When the brethren present, wearied of hearing the
	same thing so often, asked why he always repeated the same thing, he
	replied, "Because it is the commandment of the Lord, and if this
	one thing be attained, it is enough" [JEROME].
	in word—Greek,
	"with word . . . with tongue, but in deed and truth."
