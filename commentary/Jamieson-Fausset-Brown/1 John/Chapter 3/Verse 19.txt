<p><b>19. hereby</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"herein"; in our <i>loving in deed and in truth</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>we know</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts have "we shall know," namely, if we fulfil the
	command (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:18">1 John 3:18</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of the truth</b>—that we
	are real disciples of, and belonging to, <i>the truth,</i> as it is
	in Jesus: begotten of God with the word of truth. Having herein <i>the
	truth</i> radically, we shall be sure not to love merely <i>in word
	and tongue.</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:18">1 John 3:18</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>assure</b>—literally,
	"persuade," namely, so as to cease to condemn us; satisfy
	the questionings and doubts of our consciences as to whether we be
	accepted <i>before</i> God or not (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:14">Matthew 28:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:20">Acts 12:20</span>, "<i>having made</i>
	Blastus their friend," literally, "persuaded"). The
	"heart," as the seat of the feelings, is our inward <i>judge;</i>
	the <i>conscience,</i> as the witness, acts either as our justifying
	advocate, or our condemning accuser, before God even now. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:20- :">Acts 12:20- :</span>, has "conscience," but the passage is omitted in
	most old manuscripts. John nowhere else uses the term "conscience."
	Peter and Paul alone use it. 
	</p>
<p><b>before him</b>—as in the
	sight of Him, the omniscient Searcher of <i>hearts. Assurance</i> is
	designed to be the ordinary experience and privilege of the believer.</p>
