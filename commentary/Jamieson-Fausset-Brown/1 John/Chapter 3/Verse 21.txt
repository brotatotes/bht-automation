21. Belovedâ€”There is no "But"
	contrasting the two cases, 1 John 3:20;
	1 John 3:21, because "Beloved"
	sufficiently marks the transition to the case of the brethren walking
	in the full confidence of love (1 John 3:21- :). The two results of our being able to "assure our
	hearts before Him" (1 John 3:19),
	and of "our heart condemning us not" (of insincerity as to
	the truth in general, and as to LOVE
	in particular) are, (1) confidence toward God; (2) a sure answer to
	our prayers. John does not mean that all whose hearts do not condemn
	them, are therefore safe before God; for some have their conscience
	seared, others are ignorant of the truth, and it is not only
	sincerity, but sincerity in the truth which can save
	men. Christians are those meant here: knowing Christ's precepts and
	testing themselves by them.
