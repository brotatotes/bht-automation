<p><b>21. Beloved</b>â€”There is no "But"
	contrasting the two cases, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:20">1 John 3:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:21">1 John 3:21</span>, because "Beloved"
	sufficiently marks the transition to the case of the brethren walking
	in the full confidence of <i>love</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:21- :">1 John 3:21- :</span>). The two results of our being able to "assure our
	hearts before Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:19">1 John 3:19</span>),
	and of "our heart condemning us not" (of insincerity as to
	<i>the truth</i> in general, and as to LOVE
	in particular) are, (1) confidence toward God; (2) a sure answer to
	our prayers. John does not mean that all whose hearts do not condemn
	them, are therefore safe before God; for some have their conscience
	seared, others are ignorant of the truth, and it is not only
	<i>sincerity,</i> but <i>sincerity in the truth</i> which can save
	men. Christians are those meant here: knowing Christ's precepts and
	testing themselves by them.</p>
