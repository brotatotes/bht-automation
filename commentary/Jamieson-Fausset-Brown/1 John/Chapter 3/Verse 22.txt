<p><b>22. we receive</b>—as a matter of
	fact, according to His promise. Believers, as such, ask only what is
	in accordance with God's will; or if they ask what God wills not,
	they bow their will to God's will, and so God grants them either
	their request, or something better than it.

<p><b>because we keep his
	commandments</b>—Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+66:18">Psalms 66:18</span>;

	merits earned a hearing for our prayers, but when we are believers in
	Christ, all our works of faith being the fruit of <i>His</i> Spirit
	in us, are "pleasing in God's sight"; and our prayers being
	the voice of the same Spirit of God in us, naturally and necessarily
	are answered by Him.</p>
