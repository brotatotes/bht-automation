22. we receive—as a matter of
	fact, according to His promise. Believers, as such, ask only what is
	in accordance with God's will; or if they ask what God wills not,
	they bow their will to God's will, and so God grants them either
	their request, or something better than it. 
	because we keep his
	commandments—Compare Psalms 66:18;
	Psalms 34:15; Psalms 145:18;
	Psalms 145:19. Not as though our
	merits earned a hearing for our prayers, but when we are believers in
	Christ, all our works of faith being the fruit of His Spirit
	in us, are "pleasing in God's sight"; and our prayers being
	the voice of the same Spirit of God in us, naturally and necessarily
	are answered by Him.
