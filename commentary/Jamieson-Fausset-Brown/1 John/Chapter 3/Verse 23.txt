23. Summing up of God's
	commandments under the Gospel dispensation in one commandment. 
	this is his
	commandment—singular: for faith and love are not
	separate commandments, but are indissolubly united. We cannot
	truly love one another without faith in Christ, nor can
	we truly believe in Him without love. 
	believe—once for
	all; Greek aorist. 
	on the name of his Son—on
	all that is revealed in the Gospel concerning Him, and on Himself in
	respect to His person, offices, and atoning work. 
	as he—as Jesus
	gave us commandment.
