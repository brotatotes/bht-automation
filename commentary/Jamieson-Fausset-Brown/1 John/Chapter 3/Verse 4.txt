<p><b>4.</b> Sin is incompatible with
	birth from God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:1-3">1 John 3:1-3</span>).
	John often sets forth the same truth <i>negatively,</i> which he had
	before set forth <i>positively.</i> He had shown, birth from God
	involves self-purification; he now shows where sin, that is, the want
	of self-purification, is, there is no birth from God. 
	</p>
<p><b>Whosoever</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Every one who." 
	</p>
<p><b>committeth sin</b>—in
	contrast to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>, "Every
	man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself"; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3- :">1 John 3:3- :</span>, "He that doeth righteousness." 
	</p>
<p><b>transgresseth . . . the
	law</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "committeth transgression of law."
	God's law of purity; and so shows he has no such hope of being
	hereafter pure as God is pure, and, therefore, that he is not born of
	God. 
	</p>
<p><b>for</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"and." 
	</p>
<p><b>sin is . . . transgression of
	. . . law</b>—definition of <i>sin</i> in general. The <i>Greek</i>
	having the article to both, implies that they are convertible terms.
	The <i>Greek</i> "sin" (<i>hamartia</i>) is literally, "a
	missing of the mark." God's will being that mark to be ever
	aimed at. "By the law is the knowledge of sin." The
	crookedness of a line is shown by being brought into juxtaposition
	with a straight ruler.</p>
