<p><b>6.</b> He reasons from Christ's own
	entire separation from sin, that those in him must also be separate
	from it. 
	</p>
<p><b>abideth in him</b>—as the
	branch in the vine, by vital union living by His life. 
	</p>
<p><b>sinneth not</b>—In so far
	as he abides in Christ, so far is he free from all sin. The ideal of
	the Christian. The life of sin and the life of God mutually exclude
	one another, just as darkness and light. In matter of fact, believers
	do fall into sins (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8-10">1 John 1:8-10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:1">1 John 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>);
	but all such sins are alien from the life of God, and need Christ's
	cleansing blood, without application to which the life of God could
	not be maintained. He sinneth not so long as he abideth in Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>whosoever sinneth hath not
	seen him</b>—<i>Greek</i> perfect, "has not seen, and does not
	see Him." Again the <i>ideal</i> of Christian intuition and
	knowledge is presented (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>).
	All sin as such is at variance with the notion of one regenerated.
	Not that "whosoever is betrayed into sins has never seen nor
	known God"; but <i>in so far</i> as sin exists, <i>in that
	degree</i> the spiritual intuition and knowledge of God do not exist
	in him. 
	</p>
<p><b>neither</b>—"not
	even." To <i>see</i> spiritually is a further step than <i>to
	know;</i> for by <i>knowing</i> we come to <i>seeing</i> by vivid
	realization and experimentally.</p>
