<p><b>7, 8.</b> The same truth stated,
	with the addition that he who sins is, so far as he sins, "of
	the devil."

<p><b>let no man deceive you</b>—as
	Antinomians try to mislead men.

<p><b>righteousness</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the</i> righteousness," namely, of Christ or God. 
	</p>
<p><b>he that doeth . . . is
	righteous</b>—Not his <i>doing</i> makes him <i>righteous,</i> but
	his <i>being righteous</i> (justified by the righteousness of God in
	Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:3-10">Romans 10:3-10</span>)
	makes him to do <i>righteousness:</i> an inversion common in familiar
	language, logical in reality, though not in form, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:47">Luke 7:47</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:47">John 8:47</span>. Works do not justify,
	but the justified man works. We infer from his <i>doing righteousness</i>
	that he is already <i>righteous</i> (that is, has the true and only
	principle of <i>doing righteousness,</i> namely, <i>faith</i>), and
	is therefore <i>born of God</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:47- :">John 8:47- :</span>); just as we might say, The tree that bears good fruit is a
	good tree, and has a living root; not that the fruit <i>makes</i> the
	tree and its root to be good, but it <i>shows</i> that they are so.

<p><b>he</b>—Christ.</p>
