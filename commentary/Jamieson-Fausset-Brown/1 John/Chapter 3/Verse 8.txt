<p><b>8. He that committeth sin is of the
	devil</b>—in contrast to "He that doeth righteousness,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:7">1 John 3:7</span>. He is <i>a son of the
	devil</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:10">1 John 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:44">John 8:44</span>).
	John does not, however, say, "born of the devil." as he
	does "born of God," for "the devil begets none, nor
	does he create any; but whoever imitates the devil becomes a child of
	the devil by imitating him, not by proper birth" [AUGUSTINE,
	<i>Ten Homilies on the First Epistle of John,</i> Homily 4.10]. From
	the devil there is not generation, but corruption [BENGEL].

<p><b>sinneth from the
	beginning</b>—from the time that any began to sin [ALFORD]:
	from the time that he became what he is, the devil. He seems to have
	kept his first estate only a very short time after his creation
	[BENGEL]. <i>Since the
	fall of man</i> [at the beginning <i>of our world</i>] <i>the devil
	is</i> (<i>ever</i>) <i>sinning</i> (this is the force of "sinneth";
	he has sinned from the beginning, is the cause of all sins, and still
	goes on sinning; present). As the author of sin, and prince of this
	world, he has never ceased to seduce man to sin [LUECKE].

<p><b>destroy</b>—break up and do
	away with; bruising and crushing the serpent's head. 
	</p>
<p><b>works of the devil</b>—sin,
	and all its awful consequences. John argues, Christians cannot do
	that which Christ came to destroy.</p>
