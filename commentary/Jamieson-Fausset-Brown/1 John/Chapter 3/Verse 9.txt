<p><b>9. Whosoever is born of
	God</b>—literally, "Everyone that is begotten of God." 
	</p>
<p><b>doth not commit sin</b>—His
	higher nature, as one born or begotten of God, doth not sin. <i>To be
	begotten of God</i> and <i>to sin,</i> are states mutually excluding
	one another. In so far as one sins, he makes it doubtful whether he
	be <i>born of God.</i>

<p><b>his seed</b>—the living

	<i>regeneration,</i> by cleansing away every sin into which they may

<p><b>cannot sin, because he is
	born of God</b>—"because it is <i>of God</i> that <i>he is
	born</i>" (so the <i>Greek</i> order, as compared with the order
	of the same words in the beginning of the verse); not "because
	he <i>was</i> born of God" (the <i>Greek</i> is perfect tense,
	which is <i>present</i> in meaning, not aorist); it is not said,
	Because a man was once for all born of God he never afterwards can
	sin; but, Because he is born of God, the seed abiding now in Him, he
	cannot sin; so long as it energetically abides, sin can have no
	place. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+39:9">Genesis 39:9</span>, Joseph,
	"How CAN I do this
	great wickedness and sin against God?" The principle within me
	is at utter variance with it. The regenerate life is incompatible
	with sin, and gives the believer a hatred for sin in every shape, and
	an unceasing desire to resist it. "The child of God in this
	conflict receives indeed wounds daily, but never throws away his arms
	or makes peace with his deadly foe" [LUTHER].
	The exceptional sins into which the regenerate are surprised, are
	owing to the new life principle being for a time suffered to lie
	dormant, and to the sword of the Spirit not being drawn instantly.
	Sin is ever active, but no longer reigns. The <i>normal</i> direction
	of the believer's energies is against sin; the law of God after the
	inward man is the <i>ruling</i> principle of his true self though the
	old nature, not yet <i>fully</i> deadened, rebels and sins. Contrast
