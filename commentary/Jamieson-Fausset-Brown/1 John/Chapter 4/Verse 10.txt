<p><b>10. Herein is love</b>—<i>love</i>
	in the abstract: <i>love,</i> in its highest ideal, is herein. The
	love was all on God's side, none on ours. 
	</p>
<p><b>not that we loved God</b>—though
	so altogether worthy of love. 
	</p>
<p><b>he loved us</b>—though so
	altogether unworthy of love. The <i>Greek</i> aorist expresses, Not
	that we <i>did</i> any act of love <i>at any time</i> to God, but
	that He <i>did</i> the act of love to us in sending Christ.</p>
