12. God, whom no man
	hath seen at any time, hath appointed His children as the visible
	recipients of our outward kindness which flows from love to Himself,
	"whom not having seen, we love," compare
	Notes, 1 John 4:11, 1 John 4:11- :. Thus 1 John 4:12
	explains why, instead (in 1 John 4:11)
	of saying, "If God so loved us, we ought also to love God,"
	he said, "We ought also to love one another." 
	If we love one another, God
	dwelleth in us—for God is love; and it must have been from Him
	dwelling in us that we drew the real love we bear to the brethren
	(1 John 4:8; 1 John 4:16).
	John discusses this in 1 John 4:16- :. 
	his love—rather, "the
	love of Him," that is, "to Him" (1 John 4:16- :), evinced by our love to His representatives, our brethren. 
	is perfected in us—John
	discusses this in 1 John 4:16- :. Compare 1 John 2:5,
	"is perfected," that is, attains its proper maturity.
