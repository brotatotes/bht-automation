<p><b>13. Hereby</b>â€”"Herein."
	The token vouchsafed to us of God's dwelling (<i>Greek,</i> "abide")
	in us, though we see Him not, is this, that He hath given us "of
	His Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span>).
	Where the Spirit of God is, there God is. ONE
	Spirit dwells in the Church: each believer receives a measure "of"
	that Spirit in the proportion God thinks fit. <i>Love</i> is His
	first-fruit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>). In Jesus
	alone the Spirit dwelt without measure (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22- :">Galatians 5:22- :</span>).</p>
