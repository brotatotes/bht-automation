14. And we—primarily, we
	apostles, Christ's appointed eye-witnesses to testify to the
	facts concerning Him. The internal evidence of the indwelling Spirit
	(1 John 4:13) is corroborated by
	the external evidence of the eye-witnesses to the fact of the Father
	having "sent His Son to be the Saviour of the world." 
	seen—Greek,
	"contemplated," "attentively beheld" (see on 1 John 4:13- :). 
	sent—Greek,
	"hath sent": not an entirely past fact (aorist), but
	one of which the effects continue (perfect tense).
