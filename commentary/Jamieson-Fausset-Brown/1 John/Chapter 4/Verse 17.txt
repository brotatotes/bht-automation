<p><b>our love</b>—rather as the
	<i>Greek,</i> "LOVE
	(in the abstract, the principle of love [ALFORD])
	is made perfect (in its relations) <i>with us.</i>" Love
	dwelling in us advances to its consummation "<i>with us</i>"
	that is, as it is concerned <i>with us:</i> so <i>Greek.</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "showed mercy upon (literally, 'with') her": <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, the truth "shall be <i>with us</i> for ever." 
	</p>
<p><b>boldness</b>—"confidence":
	the same <i>Greek</i> as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:21">1 John 3:21</span>,
	to which this passage is parallel. The opposite of "fear,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:18">1 John 4:18</span>. <i>Herein</i> is our
	love perfected, namely, <i>in God dwelling in us, and our dwelling in
	God</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:16">1 John 4:16</span>), involving
	as its <i>result</i> "that we can have confidence (or <i>boldness</i>)
	in the day of judgment" (so terrible to all other men, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:25">Acts 24:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16">Romans 2:16</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>because,</b> &amp;c.—The
	ground of our "confidence" is, "<i>because</i> even as
	He (Christ) is, we also are in this world" (and He will not, in
	that day, condemn those who are <i>like Himself</i>), that is, we are
	<i>righteous</i> as He is righteous, especially in respect to that
	which is the sum of righteousness, <i>love</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16- :">Romans 2:16- :</span>). Christ IS
	righteous, and <i>love</i> itself, in heaven: so are we, His members,
	who are still "in this world." Our oneness with Him even
	<i>now</i> in His exalted position above (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:16- :">Romans 2:16- :</span>), so that all that belongs to Him of righteousness, &amp;c.,
	belongs to us also by perfect imputation and progressive impartation,
	is the ground of our <i>love</i> being <i>perfected so that we can
	have confidence in the day of judgment.</i> We are <i>in,</i> not <i>of,</i>
	this world.</p>
