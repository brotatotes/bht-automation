17, 18. (Compare  :-.) 
	our love—rather as the
	Greek, "LOVE
	(in the abstract, the principle of love [ALFORD])
	is made perfect (in its relations) with us." Love
	dwelling in us advances to its consummation "with us"
	that is, as it is concerned with us: so Greek.  :-, "showed mercy upon (literally, 'with') her":  :-, the truth "shall be with us for ever." 
	boldness—"confidence":
	the same Greek as 1 John 3:21,
	to which this passage is parallel. The opposite of "fear,"
	1 John 4:18. Herein is our
	love perfected, namely, in God dwelling in us, and our dwelling in
	God (1 John 4:16), involving
	as its result "that we can have confidence (or boldness)
	in the day of judgment" (so terrible to all other men, Acts 24:25;
	Romans 2:16). 
	because, &c.—The
	ground of our "confidence" is, "because even as
	He (Christ) is, we also are in this world" (and He will not, in
	that day, condemn those who are like Himself), that is, we are
	righteous as He is righteous, especially in respect to that
	which is the sum of righteousness, love (Romans 2:16- :). Christ IS
	righteous, and love itself, in heaven: so are we, His members,
	who are still "in this world." Our oneness with Him even
	now in His exalted position above (Romans 2:16- :), so that all that belongs to Him of righteousness, &c.,
	belongs to us also by perfect imputation and progressive impartation,
	is the ground of our love being perfected so that we can
	have confidence in the day of judgment. We are in, not of,
	this world.
