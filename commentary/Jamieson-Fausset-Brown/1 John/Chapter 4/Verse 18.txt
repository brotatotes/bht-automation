<p><b>18.</b> <i>Fear</i> has no place in
	<i>love. Bold confidence</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), based on <i>love,</i> cannot coexist with <i>fear. Love,</i>
	which, when <i>perfected,</i> gives <i>bold confidence, casts out
	fear</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:15">Hebrews 2:15</span>). The design of Christ's
	propitiatory death was to <i>deliver</i> from this <i>bondage</i> of
	<i>fear.</i>

<p><b>fear hath torment</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"punishment." Fear is always revolving in the mind the
	punishment deserved [ESTIUS].
	Fear, by anticipating punishment (through consciousness of deserving
	it), has it even now, that is, the foretaste of it. <i>Perfect love</i>
	is incompatible with such a self-punishing <i>fear. Godly fear</i> of
	offending God is quite distinct from slavish fear of consciously
	deserved punishment. The latter <i>fear</i> is natural to us all
	until <i>love casts</i> it <i>out.</i> "Men's states vary: one
	is without fear and love; another, with fear without love; another,
	with fear and love; another, without fear with love" [BENGEL].</p>
