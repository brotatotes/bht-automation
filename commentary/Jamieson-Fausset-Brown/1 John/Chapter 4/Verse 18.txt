18. Fear has no place in
	love. Bold confidence ( :-), based on love, cannot coexist with fear. Love,
	which, when perfected, gives bold confidence, casts out
	fear (compare Hebrews 2:14;
	Hebrews 2:15). The design of Christ's
	propitiatory death was to deliver from this bondage of
	fear.

	fear hath torment—Greek,
	"punishment." Fear is always revolving in the mind the
	punishment deserved [ESTIUS].
	Fear, by anticipating punishment (through consciousness of deserving
	it), has it even now, that is, the foretaste of it. Perfect love
	is incompatible with such a self-punishing fear. Godly fear of
	offending God is quite distinct from slavish fear of consciously
	deserved punishment. The latter fear is natural to us all
	until love casts it out. "Men's states vary: one
	is without fear and love; another, with fear without love; another,
	with fear and love; another, without fear with love" [BENGEL].
