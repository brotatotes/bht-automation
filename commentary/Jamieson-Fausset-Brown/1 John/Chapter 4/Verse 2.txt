2. Hereby—"Herein." 
	know . . . the Spirit of
	God—whether he be, or not, in those teachers professing to be
	moved by Him. 
	Every spirit—that is,
	Every teacher claiming inspiration by the HOLY
	SPIRIT. 
	confesseth—The truth is
	taken for granted as established. Man is required to confess
	it, that is, in his teaching to profess it openly. 
	Jesus Christ is come in the
	flesh—a twofold truth confessed, that Jesus is the
	Christ, and that He is come (the Greek perfect
	tense implies not a mere past historical fact, as the aorist would,
	but also the present continuance of the fact and its blessed
	effects) in the flesh ("clothed with flesh": not
	with a mere seeming humanity, as the Docetæ afterwards
	taught: He therefore was, previously, something far above flesh). His
	flesh implies His death for us, for only by assuming
	flesh could He die (for as God He could not), Hebrews 2:9;
	Hebrews 2:10; Hebrews 2:14;
	Hebrews 2:16; and His death implies
	His LOVE for us (Hebrews 2:16- :). To deny the reality of His flesh is to deny His
	love, and so cast away the root which produces all true love on the
	believer's part (1 John 4:9-11;
	1 John 4:19). Rome, by the doctrine
	of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, denies Christ's
	proper humanity.
