<p><b>confesseth</b>—The truth is

<p><b>Jesus Christ is come in the
	flesh</b>—a twofold truth confessed, that <i>Jesus</i> is the
	<i>Christ,</i> and that <i>He is come</i> (the <i>Greek</i> perfect
	tense implies not a mere past historical fact, as the aorist would,
	but also the <i>present continuance</i> of the fact and its blessed
	effects) <i>in the flesh</i> ("clothed with flesh": not
	with a mere <i>seeming</i> humanity, as the Docetæ afterwards
	taught: He therefore was, previously, something far above flesh). His
	<i>flesh</i> implies His <i>death</i> for us, for only by assuming
	flesh could He die (for as God He could not), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16">Hebrews 2:16</span>; and His death implies
	His LOVE for us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16- :">Hebrews 2:16- :</span>). To deny the reality of <i>His flesh</i> is to deny His
	love, and so cast away the root which produces all true love on the
	believer's part (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9-11">1 John 4:9-11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:19">1 John 4:19</span>). Rome, by the doctrine
	of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, denies Christ's
	proper humanity.</p>
