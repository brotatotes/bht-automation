<p><b>20. loveth not . . . brother whom he
	hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen</b>—It is
	easier for us, influenced as we are here by sense, to direct love
	towards one within the range of our senses than towards One unseen,
	appreciable only by faith. "Nature is prior to grace; and we by
	nature love things seen, before we love things unseen" [ESTIUS].
	<i>The eyes are our leaders in love.</i> "Seeing is an incentive
	to love" [OEligCUMENIUS].
	If we do not love <i>the brethren,</i> the visible representatives of
	<i>God,</i> how can we love God, the invisible One, <i>whose children
	they are?</i> The true ideal of man, lost in Adam, is realized in
	Christ, in whom God is revealed as He is, and man as he ought to be.
	Thus, by faith in Christ, we learn to love both the true God, and the
	true man, and so to love the brethren as bearing His image.
