4. Ye—emphatical: YE
	who confess Jesus: in contrast to "them," the false
	teachers. 
	overcome them— (1 John 5:4;
	1 John 5:5); instead of being
	"overcome and brought into (spiritual) bondage" by them
	(2 Peter 2:19). John 10:8;
	John 10:5, "the sheep did not
	hear them": "a stranger will they not follow, but will
	flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers." 
	he that is in you—God,
	of whom ye are. 
	he that is in the word—the
	spirit of Antichrist, the devil, "the prince of this world."
