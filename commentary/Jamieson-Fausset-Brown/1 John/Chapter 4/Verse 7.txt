	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:29">1 John 2:29</span>). <i>Love,</i> the
	sum of <i>righteousness,</i> is the test of our being <i>born of God.</i>
	Love flows from a sense of God's love to us: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16">1 John 3:16</span>, which <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:16- :">1 John 3:16- :</span> resumes; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:13">1 John 4:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span>, which similarly <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24- :">1 John 3:24- :</span> resumes. At the same time, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24- :">1 John 3:24- :</span> is connected with the immediately preceding context, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24- :">1 John 3:24- :</span> setting forth <i>Christ's incarnation, the great proof of
	God's love</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span>).

<p><b>Beloved</b>—an address
	appropriate to his subject, "love."

<p><b>love</b>—<i>All love</i> is
	<i>from God</i> as its fountain: especially that embodiment of love,
	God manifest in the flesh. The <i>Father</i> also is <i>love</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10- :">1 John 4:10- :</span>). The <i>Holy Ghost</i> sheds <i>love</i> as its first <i>fruit</i>
	abroad in the heart.

	experimentally, and habitually.</p>
