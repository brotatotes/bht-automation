<p><b>8. knoweth not</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	aorist: not only <i>knoweth</i> not now, but never <i>knew, has not
	once for all known</i> God. 
	</p>
<p><b>God is love</b>—There is no
	<i>Greek</i> article to <i>love,</i> but to <i>God;</i> therefore we
	cannot translate, <i>Love is God.</i> God is fundamentally and
	essentially LOVE: not
	merely <i>is loving,</i> for then John's argument would not stand;
	for the conclusion from the premises then would be this, <i>This man
	is not loving: God is loving; therefore he knoweth not</i> God IN
	SO FAR AS GOD IS LOVING;
	still he might know Him in His <i>other</i> attributes. But when we
	take love as God's essence, the argument is sound: <i>This man doth
	not love,</i> and <i>therefore knows not love: God is essentially
	love, therefore he knows not God.</i></p>
