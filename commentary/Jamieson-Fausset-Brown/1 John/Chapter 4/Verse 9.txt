<p><b>into the world</b>—a proof
	against Socinians, that the Son existed before He was "sent into
	the world." Otherwise, too, He could not have been our <i>life</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span>), our "<i>propitiation</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:10">1 John 4:10</span>), or our "Saviour"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:14">1 John 4:14</span>). It is the grand
	<i>proof</i> of God's love, His having sent "<i>His
	only-begotten Son, that we might live through Him,</i>" who is
	<i>the Life,</i> and who has redeemed our forfeited life; and it is
	also the grand <i>motive</i> to our mutual love.</p>
