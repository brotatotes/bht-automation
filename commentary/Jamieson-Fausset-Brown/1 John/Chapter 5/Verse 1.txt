<p><b>1.</b> Reason why our "brother"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:21">1 John 4:21</span>) is entitled to such
	<i>love,</i> namely, because he is "born (begotten) of God":
	so that if we want to show our love to <i>God,</i> we must show it to
	God's visible representative. 
	</p>
<p><b>Whosoever</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Everyone that." He could not be our "Jesus"
	(God-Saviour) unless He were "the Christ"; for He could not
	reveal the way of salvation, except He were a <i>prophet:</i> He
	could not work out that salvation, except He were a <i>priest:</i> He
	could not confer that salvation upon us, except He were a <i>king:</i>
	He could not be <i>prophet, priest,</i> and <i>king,</i> except He
	were the Christ [PEARSON,
	<i>Exposition of the Creed</i>]. 
	</p>
<p><b>born</b>—Translate,
	"begotten," as in the latter part of the verse, the <i>Greek</i>
	being the same. Christ is the "only-begotten Son" by
	<i>generation;</i> we become begotten sons of God by <i>regeneration</i>
	and adoption. 
	</p>
<p><b>every one that loveth him
	that begat</b>—sincerely, not in mere profession (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:21- :">1 John 4:21- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>loveth him also that is
	begotten of him</b>—namely, "his brethren" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:21- :">1 John 4:21- :</span>).</p>
