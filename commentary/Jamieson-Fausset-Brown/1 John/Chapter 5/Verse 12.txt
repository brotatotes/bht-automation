<p><b>12. the Son . . . life</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"THE life."
	BENGEL remarks, The verse
	has two clauses: in the former the Son is mentioned without the
	addition "of God," for believers know <i>the Son:</i> in
	the second clause the addition "of God" is made, that
	unbelievers may know thereby what a serious thing it is not to have
	Him. In the former clause "has" bears the emphasis; in the
	second, <i>life.</i> To <i>have the Son</i> is to be able to say as
	the bride, "I am my Beloved's, and <i>my Beloved is mine</i>"
	[<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+6:3">Song of Solomon 6:3</span>]. <i>Faith</i> is the
	mean whereby the regenerate HAVE
	Christ as a <i>present</i> possession, and in having Him <i>have life</i>
	in its germ and reality now, and shall have life in its fully
	developed manifestation hereafter. <i>Eternal life</i> here is: (1)
	<i>initial,</i> and is an earnest of that which is to follow; in the
	intermediate state (2) <i>partial,</i> belonging but to a part of a
	man, though that is his nobler part, the soul separated from the
	body; at and after the resurrection (3) <i>perfectional.</i> This
	life is not only natural, consisting of the union of the soul and the
	body (as that of the reprobate in eternal pain, which ought to be
	termed <i>death</i> eternal, not <i>life</i>), but also spiritual,
	the union of the soul to God, and supremely blessed for ever (for
	<i>life</i> is another term for <i>happiness</i>) [PEARSON,
	<i>Exposition of the Creed</i>].</p>
