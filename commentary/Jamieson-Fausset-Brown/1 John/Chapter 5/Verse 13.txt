<p><b>13.</b> The oldest manuscripts and
	versions read, "These things have I written unto you [omitting
	'<i>that believe on the name of the Son of God</i>'] that ye may know
	that ye have eternal life (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), THOSE (of you I
	mean) WHO believe (not as
	<i>English Version</i> reads, '<i>and that ye may believe</i>') on
	the name of the Son of God." <i>English Version,</i> in the
	latter clause, will mean, "that ye may <i>continue</i> to
	believe," c. (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>These things</b>â€”This
	Epistle. He, towards the close of his Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30">John 20:30</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:31">John 20:31</span>), wrote similarly,
	stating his purpose in having written. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:31- :">John 20:31- :</span> he states the object of his writing this Epistle to be, "that
	your joy may be full." To "<i>know that we have eternal
	life</i>" is the sure way to "joy in God."</p>
