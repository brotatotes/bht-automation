	results from <i>knowing that we have eternal life</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:13">1 John 5:13</span>;

<p><b>according to his will</b>—which
	is the believer's will, and which is therefore no restraint to his
	prayers. In so far as God's will is not our will, we are not abiding
	in faith, and our prayers are not accepted. ALFORD
	well says, If we <i>knew</i> God's will thoroughly, and <i>submitted</i>
	to it heartily, it would be impossible for us to ask anything for the
	spirit or for the body which He should not perform; it is this ideal
	state which the apostle has in view. It is the <i>Spirit</i> who
	teaches us inwardly, and Himself in us asks according to the will of
	God.</p>
