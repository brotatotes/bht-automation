<p><b>15. hear</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "that
	He <i>heareth</i> us." 
	</p>
<p><b>we have the petitions that we
	desired of him</b>—<i>We have,</i> as present possessions,
	everything <i>whatsoever we desired</i> (<i>asked</i>) <i>from Him.</i>
	Not one of our <i>past</i> prayers offered in faith, <i>according to
	His will,</i> is lost. Like Hannah, we can rejoice over them as
	granted even before the event; and can recognize the event when it
	comes to pass, as not from chance, but obtained by our past prayers.
	Compare also Jehoshaphat's believing confidence in the issue of his
	prayers, so much so that he appointed singers to praise the Lord
	beforehand.</p>
