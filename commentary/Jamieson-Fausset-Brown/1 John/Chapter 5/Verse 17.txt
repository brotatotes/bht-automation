	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:4">1 John 3:4</span>. Every coming short of

<p><b>and there is a sin not unto

	<i>Death</i> and <i>life</i> stand in correlative opposition (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:4- :">1 John 3:4- :</span>). <i>The sin unto death</i> must be one tending "towards"
	(so the <i>Greek</i>), and so resulting in, <i>death.</i> ALFORD
	makes it to be an appreciable ACT of sin, namely, <i>the denying
	Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of God</i> (in contrast to confess
	this truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:5">1 John 5:5</span>),
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:19">1 John 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:22">1 John 2:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:2">1 John 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:10">1 John 5:10</span>. Such wilful deniers of
	Christ are not to be received into one's house, or wished "God
	speed." Still, I think with BENGEL,
	not merely the <i>act,</i> but also the <i>state</i> of apostasy
	accompanying the <i>act,</i> is included—a "state of soul in
	which faith, love, and hope, in short, the new life, is extinguished.
	The chief commandment is <i>faith</i> and <i>love.</i> Therefore, the
	chief sin is that by which faith and love are destroyed. In the
	former case is <i>life;</i> in the latter, death. As long as it is
	not evident (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:16">1 John 5:16</span>,
	on 'see') that it is a sin unto death, it is lawful to pray. But when
	it is deliberate rejection of grace, and the man puts from him life
	thereby, how can others procure for him life?" Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:16- :">1 John 5:16- :</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:31">Matthew 12:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:32">Matthew 12:32</span> as to the wilful
	rejection of Christ, and resistance to the Holy Ghost's plain
	testimony to Him as the divine Messiah. Jesus, on the cross, pleaded
	only for those who KNEW NOT
	<i>what they were doing</i> in crucifying Him, not for those wilfully
	resisting grace and knowledge. If we <i>pray for</i> the impenitent,
	it must be with humble reference of the matter to God's will, not
	with the intercessory <i>request</i> which we should offer for <i>a
	brother</i> when erring.</p>
