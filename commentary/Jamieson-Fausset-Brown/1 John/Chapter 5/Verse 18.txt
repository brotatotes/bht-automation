<p><b>18.</b> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.) 
	</p>
<p><b>We know</b>—Thrice repeated
	emphatically, to enforce the three truths which the words preface, as
	matters of the brethren's joint experimental knowledge. This <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> warns against abusing <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:16">1 John 5:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:17">1 John 5:17</span>, as warranting carnal
	security. 
	</p>
<p><b>whosoever</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"every one who." Not only advanced believers, but <i>every
	one</i> who is born again, "sinneth not." 
	</p>
<p><b>he that is begotten</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	aorist, "has been (once for all in <i>past</i> time) begotten of
	God"; in the beginning of the verse it is perfect. "Is
	begotten," or "born," as a <i>continuing</i> state. 
	</p>
<p><b>keepeth himself</b>—The
	<i>Vulgate</i> translates, "The having been begotten of God
	keepeth HIM" (so one
	of the oldest manuscripts reads): so ALFORD.
	Literally, "He having been begotten of God (nominative pendent),
	<i>it</i> (the divine generation implied in the nominative) keepeth
	him." So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9">1 John 3:9</span>, "His
	seed remaineth in him." Still, in <i>English Version</i>
	reading, God's working by His Spirit inwardly, and man's working
	under the power of that Spirit as a responsible agent, is what often
	occurs elsewhere. That <i>God</i> must <i>keep</i> us, if we are to
	<i>keep ourselves</i> from evil, is certain. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:9- :">1 John 3:9- :</span> especially with this verse. 
	</p>
<p><b>that wicked one toucheth him
	not</b>—so as to hurt him. In so far as he realizes his
	regeneration-life, the prince of this world <i>hath nothing in him</i>
	to fasten his deadly temptations on, as in Christ's own case. His
	divine regeneration has severed once for all his connection with the
	prince of this world.</p>
