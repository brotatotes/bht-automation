18. ( :-.) 
	We know—Thrice repeated
	emphatically, to enforce the three truths which the words preface, as
	matters of the brethren's joint experimental knowledge. This  :- warns against abusing 1 John 5:16;
	1 John 5:17, as warranting carnal
	security. 
	whosoever—Greek,
	"every one who." Not only advanced believers, but every
	one who is born again, "sinneth not." 
	he that is begotten—Greek
	aorist, "has been (once for all in past time) begotten of
	God"; in the beginning of the verse it is perfect. "Is
	begotten," or "born," as a continuing state. 
	keepeth himself—The
	Vulgate translates, "The having been begotten of God
	keepeth HIM" (so one
	of the oldest manuscripts reads): so ALFORD.
	Literally, "He having been begotten of God (nominative pendent),
	it (the divine generation implied in the nominative) keepeth
	him." So 1 John 3:9, "His
	seed remaineth in him." Still, in English Version
	reading, God's working by His Spirit inwardly, and man's working
	under the power of that Spirit as a responsible agent, is what often
	occurs elsewhere. That God must keep us, if we are to
	keep ourselves from evil, is certain. Compare 1 John 3:9- : especially with this verse. 
	that wicked one toucheth him
	not—so as to hurt him. In so far as he realizes his
	regeneration-life, the prince of this world hath nothing in him
	to fasten his deadly temptations on, as in Christ's own case. His
	divine regeneration has severed once for all his connection with the
	prince of this world.
