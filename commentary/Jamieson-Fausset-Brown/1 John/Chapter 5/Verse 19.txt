<p><b>19. world lieth in
	wickedness</b>â€”rather, "lieth in <i>the wicked one,</i>"
	as the <i>Greek</i> is translated in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:18">1 John 5:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:14">1 John 2:14</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:4">1 John 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:14">John 17:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>. The world <i>lieth</i>
	in the power of, and abiding in, the wicked one, as the resting-place
	and lord of his slaves; compare "abideth in death," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15- :">John 17:15- :</span>; contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span>,
	"we are in Him that is true." While the believer has been
	delivered out of his power, the whole world <i>lieth</i> helpless and
	motionless still in it, just as it was; including the wise, great,
	respectable, and all who are not by vital union in Christ.</p>
