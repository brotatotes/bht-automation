19. world lieth in
	wickednessâ€”rather, "lieth in the wicked one,"
	as the Greek is translated in 1 John 5:18;
	1 John 2:13; 1 John 2:14;
	compare 1 John 4:4; John 17:14;
	John 17:15. The world lieth
	in the power of, and abiding in, the wicked one, as the resting-place
	and lord of his slaves; compare "abideth in death," John 17:15- :; contrast 1 John 5:20,
	"we are in Him that is true." While the believer has been
	delivered out of his power, the whole world lieth helpless and
	motionless still in it, just as it was; including the wise, great,
	respectable, and all who are not by vital union in Christ.
