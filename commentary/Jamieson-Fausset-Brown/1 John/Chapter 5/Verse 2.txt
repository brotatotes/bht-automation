<p><b>2. By</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "In."
	As our <i>love to the brethren</i> is the sign and test of our <i>love
	to God,</i> so (John here says) our <i>love to God</i> (tested by our
	"keeping his commandments") is, conversely, the ground and
	only true basis of <i>love to our brother.</i>
</p>
<p><b>we know</b>—John means
	here, not the <i>outward</i> criteria of genuine brotherly love, but
	the <i>inward spiritual</i> criteria of it, <i>consciousness of love
	to God</i> manifested in a hearty keeping of His commandments. When
	we have this inwardly and outwardly confirmed <i>love to God,</i> we
	can <i>know</i> assuredly that we truly <i>love the children of God.</i>
	"<i>Love to one's brother</i> is prior, according to the order
	of nature (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:20">1 John 4:20</span>);
	<i>love to God</i> is so, according to the order of grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:20- :">1 John 4:20- :</span>). At one time the former is more immediately known, at
	another time the latter, according as the mind is more engaged in
	human relations or in what concerns the divine honor" [ESTIUS].
	John shows what true <i>love</i> is, namely, that which is referred
	to God as its first object. As previously John urged the effect, so
	now he urges the cause. For he wishes mutual love to be so cultivated
	among us, as that <i>God</i> should always be placed first [CALVIN].</p>
