<p><b>20.</b> Summary of our Christian
	privileges. 
	</p>
<p><b>is come</b>—<i>is present,
	having come.</i> "HE IS
	HERE—all is full of Him—His incarnation, work, and abiding
	presence, is to us a living fact" [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>given us an
	understanding</b>—Christ's, office is to give the inner spiritual
	understanding to discern the things of God. 
	</p>
<p><b>that we may know</b>—Some
	oldest manuscripts read, "(so) that <i>we know.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>him that is true</b>—God,
	as opposed to every kind of <i>idol</i> or false god (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Jesus, by virtue of His oneness with God, is also "He
	that is true" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:7">Revelation 3:7</span>). 
	</p>
<p><i><b>even</b></i><b> </b>—"we
	are in the true" God, <i>by virtue of being</i> "in His Son
	Jesus Christ." 
	</p>
<p><b>This is the true God</b>—"<i>This</i>
	Jesus Christ (the last-named Person) is the true God"
	(identifying Him thus with the Father in His attribute, "the
	only true God," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>,
	primarily attributed to the Father). 
	</p>
<p><b>and eternal life</b>—predicated
	of the Son of God; ALFORD
	wrongly says, He was <i>the life,</i> but not <i>eternal life.</i>
	The Father is indeed <i>eternal life</i> as its source, but the Son
	also is that <i>eternal life manifested,</i> as the very passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3- :">John 17:3- :</span>) which ALFORD
	quotes, proves against him. Compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:11">1 John 5:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:13">1 John 5:13</span>. Plainly it is as the
	<i>Mediator of</i> ETERNAL LIFE
	<i>to us</i> that Christ is here contemplated. The <i>Greek</i> is,
	"The true God and eternal life is this" Jesus Christ, that
	is, In believing in Him we believe in the true God, and have eternal
	life. The Son is called "He that is TRUE,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:7">Revelation 3:7</span>, as here. This naturally
	prepares the way for warning against <i>false</i> gods (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:7- :">Revelation 3:7- :</span>). Jesus Christ is the only "express image of God's
	person" which is sanctioned, the only true visible manifestation
	of God. All other representations of God are forbidden as <i>idols.</i>
	Thus the Epistle closes as it began (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span>).</p>
