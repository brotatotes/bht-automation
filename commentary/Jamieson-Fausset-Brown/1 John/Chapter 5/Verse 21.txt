21. Affectionate parting
	caution. 
	from idolsâ€”Christians
	were then everywhere surrounded by idolaters, with whom it was
	impossible to avoid intercourse. Hence the need of being on their
	guard against any even indirect compromise or act of communion with
	idolatry. Some at Pergamos, in the region whence John wrote, fell
	into the snare of eating things sacrificed to idols. The moment we
	cease to abide "in Him that is true (by abiding) in Jesus
	Christ," we become part of "the world that lieth in the
	wicked one," given up to spiritual, if not in all places
	literal, idolatry (Ephesians 5:5;
	Colossians 3:5).
