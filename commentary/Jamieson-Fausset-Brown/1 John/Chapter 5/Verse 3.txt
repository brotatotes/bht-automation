<p><b>3. this is</b>—the <i>love</i> of

<p><b>not grievous</b>—as so many
	think them. It is "the way of the transgressor" that "is
	hard." What makes them to the regenerate "not grievous,"
	is <i>faith</i> which "overcometh the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): in proportion as faith is strong, the grievousness of God's
	commandments to the rebellious flesh is overcome. The reason why
	believers feel any degree of irksomeness in God's commandments is,
	they do not realize fully by faith the privileges of their spiritual
	life.</p>
