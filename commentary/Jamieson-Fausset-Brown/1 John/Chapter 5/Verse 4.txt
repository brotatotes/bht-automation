4. For—(See on  :-). The reason why "His commandments are not grievous."
	Though there is a conflict in keeping them, the sue for the whole
	body of the regenerate is victory over every opposing influence;
	meanwhile there is a present joy to each believer in keeping
	them which makes them "not grievous." 
	whatsoever—Greek,
	"all that is begotten of God." The neuter expresses
	the universal whole, or aggregate of the regenerate,
	regarded as one collective body John 3:6;
	John 6:37; John 6:39,
	"where BENGEL
	remarks, that in Jesus' discourses, what the Father has given Him is
	called, in the singular number and neuter gender, all
	whatsoever; those who come to the Son are described in the
	masculine gender and plural number, they all, or singular,
	every one. The Father has given, as it were, the whole mass to
	the Son, that all whom He gave may be one whole: that
	universal whole the Son singly evolves, in the execution of
	the divine plan." 
	overcometh—habitually. 
	the world—all that is
	opposed to keeping the commandments of God, or draws us off from God,
	in this world, including our corrupt flesh, on which the
	world's blandishments or threats act, as also including Satan, the
	prince of this world (John 12:31;
	John 14:30; John 16:11).
	this is the victory that
	overcometh—Greek aorist, ". . . that hath
	(already) overcome the world": the victory (where
	faith is) hereby is implied as having been already obtained
	(1 John 2:13; 1 John 4:4).
