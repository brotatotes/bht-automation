	"but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God:" "the

	Confirming, by a triumphant question defying all contradiction, as an
	undeniable fact, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>, that
	<i>the victory</i> which overcomes the world is <i>faith.</i> For it
	is by <i>believing:</i> that we are made one with <i>Jesus the Son of
	God,</i> so that we partake of <i>His victory over the world,</i> and
	have dwelling in us One greater than he who is in the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4- :">1 John 5:4- :</span>). "Survey the whole world, and show me even one of whom
	it can be affirmed with truth that he overcomes the world, who is not
	a Christian, and endowed with this faith" [EPISCOPIUS
	in ALFORD].</p>
