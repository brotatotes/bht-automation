<p><b>6. This</b>—the Person mentioned
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:5">1 John 5:5</span>. This <i>Jesus.</i>
</p>
<p><b>he that came by water and
	blood</b>—"by water," when His ministry was inaugurated
	by baptism in the Jordan, and He received the Father's testimony to
	His Messiahship and divine <i>Sonship.</i> Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:5- :">1 John 5:5- :</span>, "believeth that Jesus is the <i>Son of God,</i>"
	with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:33">John 1:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:34">John 1:34</span>,
	"The Spirit . . . remaining on Him . . . I saw and bare record
	that this is <i>the Son of God</i>"; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:34- :">John 1:34- :</span>, below, "there are three that bear <i>witness</i> in
	earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood." Corresponding
	to this is <i>the baptism of water and the Spirit</i> which He has
	instituted as a standing seal and mean of initiatory incorporation
	with Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>and blood</b>—He came by
	"the blood of His cross" (so "by" is used, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:34- :">John 1:34- :</span>: "by," that is, <i>with,</i> "His own blood
	He entered in once into the holy place"): a fact <i>seen</i> and
	so solemnly <i>witnessed</i> to by John. "These two past facts
	in the Lord's life are this abiding <i>testimony</i> to us, by virtue
	of the permanent application to us of their cleansing and atoning
	power." 
	</p>
<p><b>Jesus Christ</b>—not a mere
	appellation, but a solemn assertion of the Lord's Person and
	Messiahship. 
	</p>
<p><b>not by,</b> c.—<i>Greek,</i>
	"not IN <i>the</i>
	water only, but IN <i>the</i>
	water and IN (so oldest
	manuscripts add) <i>the</i> blood." As "<i>by</i>"
	implies the mean <i>through,</i> or <i>with,</i> which He came: so
	"<i>in,</i>" the element <i>in</i> which He came. "The"
	implies that <i>the water</i> and <i>the blood</i> were sacred and
	well-known symbols. John Baptist came only baptizing with water, and
	therefore was not the <i>Messiah.</i> Jesus came first to undergo
	Himself the double baptism of water and blood, and then to baptize us
	with the Spirit-cleansing, of which <i>water</i> is the sacramental
	seal, and with His atoning <i>blood,</i> the efficacy of which, once
	for all shed, is perpetual in the Church and therefore is <i>the
	Messiah.</i> It was His shed <i>blood</i> which first gave <i>water
	baptism</i> its spiritual significancy. We are baptized <i>into His
	death:</i> the grand point of union between us and Him, and, through
	Him, between us and God. 
	</p>
<p><b>it is the Spirit,</b> c.—<i>The
	Holy Spirit</i> is an additional witness (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:34- :">John 1:34- :</span>), besides the <i>water</i> and the <i>blood,</i> to Jesus'
	<i>Sonship</i> and <i>Messiahship.</i> The Spirit attested these
	truths at Jesus' baptism by descending on Him, and throughout His
	ministry by enabling Him to speak and do what man never before or
	since has spoken or, done and "it is the Spirit that beareth
	witness" of Christ, now permanently in the Church: both in the
	inspired New Testament Scriptures, and in the hearts of believers,
	and in the spiritual reception of baptism and the Lord's Supper. 
	</p>
<p><b>because the Spirit is
	truth</b>—It is His essential <i>truth</i> which gives His witness
	such infallible authority.</p>
