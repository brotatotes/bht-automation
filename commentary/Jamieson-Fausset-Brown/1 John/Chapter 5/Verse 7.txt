<p><b>7. three</b>—Two or three
	witnesses were required by law to constitute adequate testimony. The
	only <i>Greek</i> manuscripts <i>in any form</i> which support the
	words, "in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and
	these three are one; and there are three that bear witness in earth,"
	are the <i>Montfortianus</i> of Dublin, copied evidently from the
	<i>modern Latin Vulgate;</i> the <i>Ravianus,</i> copied from the
	<i>Complutensian Polyglot;</i> a manuscript at Naples, with the words
	added in the <i>Margin</i> by a recent hand; <i>Ottobonianus,</i>
	298, of the fifteenth century, the <i>Greek</i> of which is a mere
	translation of the accompanying <i>Latin.</i> All the old versions
	omit the words. The oldest manuscripts of the <i>Vulgate</i> omit
	them: the earliest <i>Vulgate</i> manuscript which has them being
	<i>Wizanburgensis,</i> 99, of the eighth century. A scholium quoted
	in <i>Matthæi,</i> shows that the words did not arise from fraud;
	for in the words, in all <i>Greek</i> manuscripts "there are
	<i>three</i> that bear record," as the Scholiast notices, the
	word "three" is <i>masculine,</i> because the three things
	(<i>the Spirit, the water,</i> and <i>the blood</i>) are SYMBOLS
	OF THE TRINITY. To
	this CYPRIAN, 196, also
	refers, "Of the <i>Father, Son</i> and <i>Holy Spirit,</i> it is
	written, '<i>And these</i> three are one' (a unity)." There must
	be some mystical truth implied in using "<i>three</i>"
	(<i>Greek</i>) in the <i>masculine,</i> though the antecedents,
	"Spirit, water, and blood," are <i>neuter.</i> That THE
	TRINITY was the truth
	meant is a natural inference: the triad specified pointing to a still
	Higher Trinity; as is plain also from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "the witness of GOD,"
	referring to the <i>Trinity</i> alluded to in the Spirit, water, and
	blood. It was therefore first written as a <i>marginal</i> comment to
	complete the sense of the <i>text,</i> and then, as early at least as
	the eighth century, was introduced into the text of the <i>Latin
	Vulgate.</i> The testimony, however, could only be borne <i>on earth</i>
	to men, not in <i>heaven.</i> The marginal comment, therefore, that
	inserted "in heaven," was inappropriate. It is <i>on earth</i>
	that the context evidently requires the witness of the three, <i>the
	Spirit, the water,</i> and <i>the blood,</i> to be borne: mystically
	setting forth the divine <i>triune</i> witnesses, the Father, the
	Spirit, and the Son. LUECKE
	notices as internal evidence against the words, John never uses "the
	Father" and "the Word" as correlates, but, like other
	New Testament writers, associates "the Son" with "the
	Father," and always refers "the Word" to "God"
	as its correlate, not "the Father." Vigilius, at the end of
	the fifth century, is the first who quotes the disputed words as in
	the text; but no <i>Greek</i> manuscript earlier than the fifteenth
	is extant with them. The <i>term</i> "Trinity" occurs first
	in the third century in TERTULLIAN
	[<i>Against Praxeas,</i> 3].</p>
