	unto one result"; their agreeing testimony to Jesus' Sonship and
	Messiahship they give by the sacramental grace in the <i>water</i> of
	baptism, received by the penitent believer, by the atoning efficacy
	of His <i>blood,</i> and by the internal witness of His <i>Spirit</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:10">1 John 5:10</span>): answering to the
	testimony given to <i>Jesus'</i> Sonship and Messiahship by His
	baptism, His crucifixion, and the Spirit's manifestations in Him (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:6">1 John 5:6</span>). It was by His
	<i>coming by water</i> (that is, His baptism in Jordan) that Jesus
	was solemnly inaugurated in office, and revealed Himself as Messiah;
	this must have been peculiarly important in John's estimation, who
	was first led to Christ by the testimony of the Baptist. By the
	baptism then received by Christ, and by His redeeming <i>blood</i>-shedding,
	and by that which the Spirit of God, whose witness is infallible, has
	effected, and still effects, by Him, the <i>Spirit,</i> the <i>water,</i>
	and the <i>blood,</i> unite, as the threefold witness, to verify His
	divine Messiahship [NEANDER].</p>
