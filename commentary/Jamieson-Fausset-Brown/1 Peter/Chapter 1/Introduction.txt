	ELECTED OF THE GODHEAD:
	THANKSGIVING FOR THE
	LIVING HOPE
	TO WHICH WE
	ARE BEGOTTEN,
	PRODUCING JOY
	AMIDST SUFFERINGS:
	THIS SALVATION
	AN OBJECT OF
	DEEPEST INTEREST
	TO PROPHETS AND TO
	ANGELS: ITS
	COSTLY PRICE
	A MOTIVE TO
	HOLINESS AND LOVE,
	AS WE ARE
	BORN AGAIN
	OF THE EVER-ABIDING
	WORD OF GOD.
