<p><b>11. what</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "<i>In
	reference to</i> what, or what manner of time." <i>What</i>
	expresses the <i>time</i> absolutely: what was to be the era of
	Messiah's coming; <i>what manner of time;</i> what events and
	features should characterize the time of His coming. The "or"
	implies that some of the prophets, if they could not as individuals
	discover the exact <i>time,</i> searched into its characteristic
	features and events. The <i>Greek</i> for "time" is <i>the
	season,</i> the epoch, the fit time in God's purposes.

	manuscripts, "the Spirit of Jesus"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:7- :">Acts 16:7- :</span>). So JUSTIN
	MARTYR says, "Jesus
	was He who appeared and communed with Moses, Abraham, and the other
	patriarchs." CLEMENT OF
	ALEXANDRIA calls Him "the
	Prophet of prophets, and Lord of all the prophetical spirit."

<p><b>of</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "the
	sufferers (appointed) <i>unto</i> Christ," or <i>foretold in
	regard to Christ.</i> "Christ," <i>the anointed</i>
	Mediator, whose <i>sufferings</i> are the price of our "salvation"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:9">1 Peter 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:10">1 Peter 1:10</span>),

<p><b>the glory</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"glories," namely, of His resurrection, of His ascension,
	of His judgment and coming kingdom, the necessary consequence of the
	sufferings.

<p><b>that should follow</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"after these (sufferings)," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18-22">1 Peter 3:18-22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:1">1 Peter 5:1</span>. Since "the Spirit
	of Christ" is the <i>Spirit</i> of God, Christ is God. It is
	only because the Son of God was to become our Christ that He
	manifested Himself and the Father through Him in the Old Testament,
	and by the Holy Spirit, eternally proceeding from the Father and
	Himself, spake in the prophets.</p>
