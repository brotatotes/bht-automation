13. Wherefore—Seeing that the
	prophets ministered unto you in these high Gospel privileges which
	they did not themselves fully share in, though "searching"
	into them, and seeing that even angels "desire to look into"
	them, how earnest you ought to be and watchful in respect to them! 
	gird up . . . loins—referring
	to Christ's own words, Luke 12:35;
	an image taken from the way in which the Israelites ate the passover
	with the loose outer robe girded up about the waist with a girdle, as
	ready for a journey. Workmen, pilgrims, runners, wrestlers, and
	warriors (all of whom are types of the Christians), so gird
	themselves up, both to shorten the garment so as not to impede
	motion, and to gird up the body itself so as to be braced for action.
	The believer is to have his mind (mental powers) collected and always
	ready for Christ's coming. "Gather in the strength of your
	spirit" [HENSLER].
	Sobriety, that is, spiritual self-restraint, lest one
	be overcome by the allurements of the world and of sense, and patient
	hopeful waiting for Christ's revelation, are the true ways of
	"girding up the loins of the mind." 
	to the end—rather,
	"perfectly," so that there may be nothing deficient in your
	hope, no casting away of your confidence. Still, there may be
	an allusion to the "end" mentioned in Luke 12:35- :. Hope so perfectly (Greek, "teleios")
	as to reach unto the end (telos) of your faith and
	hope, namely, "the grace that is being brought unto you in (so
	the Greek) the revelation of Christ." As grace
	shall then be perfected, so you ought to hope perfectly.
	"Hope" is repeated from Luke 12:35- :. The two appearances are but different stages of the ONE
	great revelation of Christ, comprising the New Testament from the
	beginning to the end.
