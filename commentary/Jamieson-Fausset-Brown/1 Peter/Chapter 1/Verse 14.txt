<p><b>14.</b> From <i>sobriety of spirit</i>
	and <i>endurance of hope</i> Peter passes to <i>obedience, holiness,</i>
	and <i>reverential fear.</i>
</p>
<p><b>As</b>—marking their
	present actual character as "born again" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>obedient children</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"children of obedience": children to whom <i>obedience</i>
	is their characteristic and ruling nature, as a child is of the same
	nature as the mother and father. Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22- :">1 Peter 1:22- :</span>, "the children of disobedience." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22- :">1 Peter 1:22- :</span>, "obeying the Father" whose "children"
	ye are. Having the obedience of <i>faith</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22- :">1 Peter 1:22- :</span>) and so of <i>practice</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:16">1 Peter 1:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>). "Faith is the
	highest obedience, because discharged to the highest command"
	[LUTHER]. 
	</p>
<p><b>fashioning</b>—The outward
	<i>fashion</i> (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>schema</i>") is fleeting,
	and merely on the surface. The "form," or <i>conformation</i>
	in the New Testament, is something deeper and more perfect and
	essential. 
	</p>
<p><b>the former lusts in</b>—which
	were characteristic of your state of ignorance of God: true of both
	Jews and Gentiles. The sanctification is first described negatively
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:14">1 Peter 1:14</span>, "not fashioning
	yourselves," c. the putting off the old man, even in the outward
	<i>fashion,</i> as well as in the inward <i>conformation</i>), then
	positively (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:15">1 Peter 1:15</span>, putting
	on the new man, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span>). "Lusts" flow
	from the original birth-sin (inherited from our first parents, who by
	self-willed desire brought sin into the world), the <i>lust</i>
	which, ever since man has been alienated from God, seeks to fill up
	with earthly things the emptiness of his being; the manifold forms
	which the mother-lust assumes are called in the plural <i>lusts.</i>
	In the regenerate, as far as the <i>new man</i> is concerned, which
	constitutes his truest self, "sin" no longer exists; but in
	the flesh or old man it does. Hence arises the conflict,
	uninterruptedly maintained through life, wherein the new man in the
	main prevails, and at last completely. But the natural man knows only
	the combat of his lusts with one another, or with the law, without
	power to conquer them.</p>
