<p><b>15.</b> Literally, "But
	(rather) after the pattern of Him who hath called you (whose
	characteristic is that He is) holy, be (<i>Greek,</i> 'become') ye
	yourselves also holy." God is our grand model. God's <i>calling</i>
	is a frequently urged motive in Peter's Epistles. Every one that
	begets, begets an offspring resembling himself [EPIPHANIUS].
	"Let the acts of the offspring indicate similarity to the
	Father" [AUGUSTINE]. 
	</p>
<p><b>conversation</b>â€”deportment,
	course of life: one's way of going about, as distinguished from one's
	internal nature, to which it must outwardly correspond. Christians
	are already holy unto God by consecration; they must be so also in
	their <i>outward walk and behavior in all respects.</i> The outward
	must correspond to the inward man.</p>
