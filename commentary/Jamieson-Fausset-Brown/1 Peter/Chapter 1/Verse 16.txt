<p><b>16.</b> <i>Scripture</i> is the true
	source of all authority in questions of doctrine and practice. 
	</p>
<p><b>Be ye . . . for I am</b>â€”It
	is I with whom ye have to do. Ye are mine. Therefore abstain from
	Gentile pollutions. We are too prone to have respect unto men
	[CALVIN]. As I am the
	fountain of holiness, being holy in My <i>essence,</i> be ye
	therefore zealous to be <i>partakers</i> of holiness, that ye may be
	as I also am [DIDYMUS].
	God is essentially holy: the creature is holy in so far as it is
	sanctified by God. God, in giving the command, is willing to give
	also the power to obey it, namely, through the sanctifying of the
	Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>).</p>
