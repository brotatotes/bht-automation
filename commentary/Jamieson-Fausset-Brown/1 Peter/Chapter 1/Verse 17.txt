<p><b>17. if ye call on</b>—that is,
	"<i>seeing that</i> ye call on," for all the regenerate
	pray as <i>children</i> of God, "Our <i>Father</i> who art in
	heaven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:9">Matthew 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:2">Luke 11:2</span>).

<p><b>the Father</b>—rather,
	"Call upon <i>as Father</i> Him who without acceptance of
	persons (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:34">Acts 10:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:11">Romans 2:11</span>;

	This marks the harmonious and complete unity of the Trinity.

<p><b>work</b>—Each man's <i>work</i>
	is <i>one</i> complete whole, whether good or bad. The particular
	works of each are manifestations of the general character of his
	lifework, whether it was of faith and love whereby alone we can
	please God and escape condemnation. 
	</p>
<p><b>pass</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"conduct yourselves during." 
	</p>
<p><b>sojourning</b>—The outward
	state of the Jews in their <i>dispersion</i> is an emblem of the
	<i>sojourner-like</i> state of all believers in this world, away from
	our true Fatherland. 
	</p>
<p><b>fear</b>—reverential, not
	slavish. He who is your Father, is also your Judge—a thought which
	may well inspire reverential fear. THEOPHYLACT
	observes, A double fear is mentioned in Scripture: (1) <i>elementary,</i>
	causing one to become serious (2) <i>perfective:</i> the latter is
	here the motive by which Peter urges them as sons of God to be
	obedient. <i>Fear</i> is not here opposed to <i>assurance,</i> but to
	carnal <i>security:</i> fear producing vigilant caution lest we
	offend God and backslide. "<i>Fear</i> and <i>hope</i> flow from
	the same fountain: <i>fear</i> prevents us from falling away from
	<i>hope</i>" [BENGEL].
	Though <i>love</i> has no <i>fear</i> IN
	it, yet in our present state of imperfect love, it needs to have fear
	going ALONG WITH It as a
	subordinate principle. This fear drowns all other fears. The believer
	fears God, and so has none else to fear. Not to fear God is the
	greatest baseness and folly. The martyrs' more than mere human
	courage flowed from this.</p>
