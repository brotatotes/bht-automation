19. preciousâ€”of inestimable
	value. The Greek order is, "With precious blood, as of a
	lamb without blemish (in itself) and without spot (contracted
	by contact with others), (even the blood) of Christ." Though
	very man, He remained pure in Himself ("without
	blemish"), and uninfected by any impression of sin from
	without ("without spot"), which would have unfitted Him
	for being our atoning Redeemer: so the passover lamb, and every
	sacrificial victim; so too, the Church, the Bride, by her union with
	Him. As Israel's redemption from Egypt required the blood of the
	paschal lamb, so our redemption from sin and the curse required the
	blood of Christ; "foreordained" ( :-) from eternity, as the passover lamb was taken up on the
	tenth day of the month.
