<p><b>2. foreknowledge</b>—<i>foreordaining</i>
	love (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>), inseparable
	from God's <i>foreknowledge,</i> the origin <i>from</i> which, and
	pattern <i>according to</i> which, election takes place. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:23">Acts 2:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:2">Romans 11:2</span>, prove "foreknowledge"
	to be <i>foreordination.</i> God's <i>foreknowledge</i> is not the
	perception of any ground of action out of Himself; still in it
	liberty is comprehended, and all absolute constraint debarred [ANSELM
	in STEIGER]. For so the
	Son of God was "foreknown" (so the <i>Greek</i> for
	"foreordained," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>)
	to be the sacrificial Lamb, not against, or without His will, but His
	will rested in the will of the Father; this includes self-conscious
	action; nay, even cheerful acquiescense. The <i>Hebrew</i> and <i>Greek</i>
	"know" include <i>approval</i> and <i>acknowledging</i> as
	one's own. The <i>Hebrew</i> marks the oneness of <i>loving</i> and
	<i>choosing,</i> by having one word for both, <i>bachar</i> (<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>hairetizo,</i>" <i>Septuagint</i>). Peter descends from
	the eternal "election" of God through the <i>new birth,</i>
	to the believer's "sanctification," that from this he might
	again raise them through the consideration of their <i>new birth</i>
	to a "living hope" of the heavenly "inheritance"
	[HEIDEGGER]. The divine
	three are introduced in their respective functions in redemption. 
	</p>
<p><b>through</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in"; the element in which we are elected. The "election"
	of God realized and manifested itself "IN"
	their sanctification. Believers are "sanctified through the
	offering of Christ once for all" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20- :">1 Peter 1:20- :</span>). "Thou must believe and know that thou art holy; not,
	however, through thine own piety, but through the blood of Christ"
	[LUTHER]. This is the true
	sanctification of the Spirit, to obey the Gospel, to trust in Christ
	[BULLINGER]. 
	</p>
<p><b>sanctification</b>—the
	Spirit's setting apart of the saint as consecrated to God. The
	execution of God's <i>choice</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20- :">1 Peter 1:20- :</span>). God the Father gives us salvation by gratuitous election;
	the Son earns it by His blood-shedding; the Holy Spirit applies the
	merit of the Son to the soul by the Gospel word [CALVIN].
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:24-26">Numbers 6:24-26</span>, the
	Old Testament triple blessing.

<p><b>unto obedience</b>—the
	result or <i>end aimed at</i> by God as respects us, the <i>obedience</i>
	which consists in faith, and that which flows from faith; "obeying
	the truth through the Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:24-4.6.26- :">Numbers 6:24-4.6.26- :</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span>, "obedience
	to the faith," and obedience the fruit of faith. 
	</p>
<p><b>sprinkling,</b> c.—not in
	justification through the atonement once for all, which is expressed
	in the previous clauses, but (as the order proves) <i>the daily being
	sprinkled by Christ's blood, and so cleansed from all sin,</i> which
	is the privilege of one already justified and "walking in the
	light." 
	</p>
<p><b>Grace</b>—the source of
	"peace." 
	</p>
<p><b>be multiplied</b>—still
	further than already. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+4:1">Daniel 4:1</span>,
	"Ye have now peace and grace, but still not in perfection
	therefore, ye must go on increasing until the old Adam be dead"
	[LUTHER].</p>
