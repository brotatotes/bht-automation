20. God's eternal foreordination
	of Christ's redeeming sacrifice, and completion of it in these
	last times for us, are an additional obligation on us to our
	maintaining a holy walk, considering how great things have been thus
	done for us. Peter's language in the history corresponds with this
	here: an undesigned coincidence and mark of genuineness. Redemption
	was no afterthought, or remedy of an unforeseen evil, devised at the
	time of its arising. God's foreordaining of the Redeemer
	refutes the slander that, on the Christian theory, there is a period
	of four thousand years of nothing but an incensed God. God chose
	us in Christ before the foundation of the world ( :-). 
	manifest—in His
	incarnation in the fulness of the time. He existed from eternity
	before He was manifested.
in these last times—
	1 Corinthians 10:11, "the ends of
	the world." This last dispensation, made up of "times"
	marked by great changes, but still retaining a general unity,
	stretches from Christ's ascension to His coming to judgment.
