<p><b>20.</b> God's eternal foreordination
	of Christ's redeeming sacrifice, and completion of it <i>in these
	last times for us,</i> are an additional obligation on us to our
	maintaining a holy walk, considering how great things have been thus
	done for us. Peter's language in the history corresponds with this
	here: an undesigned coincidence and mark of genuineness. Redemption
	was no afterthought, or remedy of an unforeseen evil, devised at the
	time of its arising. God's <i>foreordaining</i> of the Redeemer
	refutes the slander that, on the Christian theory, there is a period
	of four thousand years of nothing but an incensed God. God <i>chose
	us in Christ before the foundation of the world</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>manifest</b>—in His
	incarnation in the fulness of the time. He existed from eternity
	before He was <i>manifested.</i>
</p>
<p><b>in these last times</b>—
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:11">1 Corinthians 10:11</span>, "the ends of
	the world." This last dispensation, made up of "times"
	marked by great changes, but still retaining a general unity,
	stretches from Christ's ascension to His coming to judgment.</p>
