<p><b>22. purified . . . in obeying the
	truth</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "in <i>your</i> (or '<i>the</i>')
	obedience of (that is, '<i>to</i>') the truth (the Gospel way of
	salvation)," that is, in the fact of your <i>believing. Faith</i>
	purifies the heart as giving it the only pure motive, love to God
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9">Acts 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span>,
	"<i>obedience</i> to the faith"). 
	</p>
<p><b>through the Spirit</b>—omitted
	in the oldest manuscripts. The Holy Spirit is the purifier by
	bestowing the obedience of faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>unto</b>—with a view to:
	the proper result of the <i>purifying</i> of your hearts by faith.
	"For what end must we lead a chaste life? That we may thereby be
	saved? No: but for this, that we may serve our neighbor"
	[LUTHER]. 
	</p>
<p><b>unfeigned</b>— <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1">1 Peter 2:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:2">1 Peter 2:2</span>, "laying aside . . .
	<i>hypocrisies</i> . . . sincere." 
	</p>
<p><b>love of the brethren</b>—that
	is, of Christians. <i>Brotherly love</i> is distinct from common
	<i>love.</i> "The Christian loves primarily those in Christ;
	secondarily, all who might be in Christ, namely, all men, as Christ
	as man died for all, and as he hopes that they, too, may become his
	Christian brethren" [STEIGER].
	BENGEL remarks that as
	here, so in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5-7">2 Peter 1:5-7</span>,
	"brotherly love" is preceded by the purifying graces,
	"<i>faith,</i> knowledge, and godliness," &amp;c. Love to
	the brethren is the evidence of our regeneration and justification by
	faith. 
	</p>
<p><b>love one another</b>—When
	the <i>purifying by faith into love of the brethren</i> has formed
	the <i>habit,</i> then the <i>act</i> follows, so that the "love"
	is at once <i>habit</i> and <i>act.</i>
</p>
<p><b>with a pure heart</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "(love) from the heart." 
	</p>
<p><b>fervently</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"intensely": with all the powers <i>on the stretch</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5-61.1.7- :">2 Peter 1:5-61.1.7- :</span>). "Instantly" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5-61.1.7- :">2 Peter 1:5-61.1.7- :</span>).</p>
