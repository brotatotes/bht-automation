22. purified . . . in obeying the
	truth—Greek, "in your (or 'the')
	obedience of (that is, 'to') the truth (the Gospel way of
	salvation)," that is, in the fact of your believing. Faith
	purifies the heart as giving it the only pure motive, love to God
	(Acts 15:9; Romans 1:5,
	"obedience to the faith"). 
	through the Spirit—omitted
	in the oldest manuscripts. The Holy Spirit is the purifier by
	bestowing the obedience of faith (1 Peter 1:2;
	1 Corinthians 12:3). 
	unto—with a view to:
	the proper result of the purifying of your hearts by faith.
	"For what end must we lead a chaste life? That we may thereby be
	saved? No: but for this, that we may serve our neighbor"
	[LUTHER]. 
	unfeigned— 1 Peter 2:1;
	1 Peter 2:2, "laying aside . . .
	hypocrisies . . . sincere." 
	love of the brethren—that
	is, of Christians. Brotherly love is distinct from common
	love. "The Christian loves primarily those in Christ;
	secondarily, all who might be in Christ, namely, all men, as Christ
	as man died for all, and as he hopes that they, too, may become his
	Christian brethren" [STEIGER].
	BENGEL remarks that as
	here, so in 2 Peter 1:5-7,
	"brotherly love" is preceded by the purifying graces,
	"faith, knowledge, and godliness," &c. Love to
	the brethren is the evidence of our regeneration and justification by
	faith. 
	love one another—When
	the purifying by faith into love of the brethren has formed
	the habit, then the act follows, so that the "love"
	is at once habit and act.
with a pure heart—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "(love) from the heart." 
	fervently—Greek,
	"intensely": with all the powers on the stretch (2 Peter 1:5-61.1.7- :). "Instantly" (2 Peter 1:5-61.1.7- :).
