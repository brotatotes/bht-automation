<p><b>24.</b> Scripture proof that the
	word of God lives for ever, in contrast to man's natural frailty. If
	ye were born again of flesh, corruptible seed, ye must also perish
	again as the grass; but now that from which you have derived life
	remains eternally, and so also will render you eternal. 
	</p>
<p><b>flesh</b>—man in his mere
	earthly nature. 
	</p>
<p><b>as</b>—omitted in some of
	the oldest manuscripts. 
	</p>
<p><b>of man</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "of it" (that is, of the flesh). "The
	glory" is the wisdom, strength, riches, learning, honor, beauty,
	art, virtue, and righteousness of the NATURAL
	man (expressed by "flesh"), which all are transitory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), not OF MAN (as
	<i>English Version</i> reads) absolutely, for the glory of <i>man, in
	his true ideal</i> realized in the believer, is eternal. 
	</p>
<p><b>withereth</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	aorist: literally, "withered," that is, is withered as a
	thing of the past. So also the <i>Greek</i> for "falleth"
	is "<i>fell</i> away," that is, is fallen away: it no
	sooner is than it is gone. 
	</p>
<p><b>thereof</b>—omitted in the
	best manuscripts and versions. "The grass" is the <i>flesh:</i>
	"the flower" its <i>glory.</i></p>
