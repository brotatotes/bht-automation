25. ( :-.) 
	this is the word . . .
	preached unto youâ€”That is eternal which is born of
	incorruptible seed (1 Peter 1:24):
	but ye have received the incorruptible seed, the word (1 Peter 1:24- :); therefore ye are born for eternity, and so are bound now
	to live for eternity (1 Peter 1:22;
	1 Peter 1:23). Ye have not far to
	look for the word; it is among you, even the joyful Gospel message
	which we preach. Doubt not that the Gospel preached to you by
	our brother Paul, and which ye have embraced, is the eternal truth.
	Thus the oneness of Paul's and Peter's creed appears. See my
	1 Peter 1:23- : showing Peter
	addresses some of the same churches as Paul labored among and wrote
	to.
