<p><b>this is the word . . .
	preached unto you</b>â€”That is eternal which is born of
	incorruptible seed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:24">1 Peter 1:24</span>):
	but ye have received the incorruptible seed, the word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:24- :">1 Peter 1:24- :</span>); therefore ye are born for eternity, and so are bound now
	to live for eternity (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23">1 Peter 1:23</span>). Ye have not far to
	look for the word; it is among you, even the joyful Gospel message
	which we preach. Doubt not that the Gospel <i>preached to you</i> by
	our brother Paul, and which ye have embraced, is the eternal truth.
	Thus the <i>oneness</i> of Paul's and Peter's creed appears. See my
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23- :">1 Peter 1:23- :</span> showing Peter
	addresses some of the same churches as Paul labored among and wrote
	to.</p>
