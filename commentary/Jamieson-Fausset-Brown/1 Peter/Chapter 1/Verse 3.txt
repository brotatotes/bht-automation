<p><b>3.</b> He begins, like Paul, in
	opening his Epistles with giving thanks to God for the greatness of
	the salvation; herein he looks forward (1) into the future (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); (2) backward into the past (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) [ALFORD].

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:7">1 Peter 4:7</span>, for allusions to <i>prayer.</i>
	"<i>Barak,</i>" <i>Hebrew</i> "bless," is
	literally "kneel." God, as the original source of blessing,
	must be blessed through all His works. 
	</p>
<p><b>abundant</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"much," "full." That God's "mercy"
	should reach <i>us,</i> guilty and enemies, proves its fulness.
	"Mercy" met our <i>misery;</i> "grace," our
	<i>guilt.</i>
</p>
<p><b>begotten us again</b>—of
	the <i>Spirit</i> by the <i>word</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:7- :">1 Peter 4:7- :</span>); whereas we were children of wrath naturally, and <i>dead</i>
	in sins. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto</b>—so that we have. 
	</p>
<p><b>lively</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"living." It has life in itself, gives life, and looks for
	life as its object [DE
	WETTE]. <i>Living</i> is a
	favorite expression of Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:23">1 Peter 1:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>).
	He delights in contemplating <i>life</i> overcoming death in the
	believer. <i>Faith</i> and <i>love</i> follow <i>hope</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:21">1 Peter 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span>).
	"(Unto) a lively hope" is further explained by "(To)
	an inheritance incorruptible . . . fadeth not away," and "(unto)
	salvation . . . ready to be revealed in the last time." I prefer
	with BENGEL and STEIGER
	to join as in <i>Greek,</i> "Unto a hope <i>living</i>
	(possessing life and vitality) <i>through</i> the resurrection of
	Jesus Christ." Faith, the subjective means of the spiritual
	resurrection of the soul, is wrought by the same power whereby Christ
	was raised from the dead. Baptism is an objective means (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22- :">1 Peter 1:22- :</span>). Its moral fruit is a new life. The connection of our
	sonship with the resurrection appears also in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:36">Luke 20:36</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span>. Christ's resurrection
	is the cause of ours, (1) as an efficient cause (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33- :">Acts 13:33- :</span>); (2) as an exemplary cause, all the saints being about to
	rise after the similitude of His resurrection. Our "hope"
	is, Christ rising from the dead hath ordained the power, and is
	become the pattern of the believer's resurrection. The soul, born
	again from its natural state into the life of grace, is after that
	born again unto the life of glory. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33- :">Acts 13:33- :</span>, "regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in the
	throne of His glory"; the resurrection of our bodies is a kind
	of coming out of the womb of the earth and entering upon immortality,
	a nativity into another life [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. The four causes
	of our salvation are; (1) the primary cause, God's mercy; (2) the
	proximate cause, Christ's death and resurrection; (3) the formal
	cause, our regeneration; (4) the final cause, our eternal bliss. As
	John is the disciple of <i>love,</i> so Paul of <i>faith,</i> and
	Peter of <i>hope.</i> Hence, Peter, most of all the apostles, urges
	the resurrection of Christ; an undesigned coincidence between the
	history and the Epistle, and so a proof of genuineness. Christ's
	resurrection was the occasion of his own restoration by Christ after
	his fall.</p>
