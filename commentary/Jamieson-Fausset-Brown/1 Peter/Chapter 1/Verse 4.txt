<p><b>4. To an inheritance</b>—the
	object of our "hope" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), which is therefore not a <i>dead,</i> but a "<i>living</i>"
	hope. The inheritance is the believer's already by title, being
	actually assigned to him; the entrance on its possession is future,
	and hoped for as a certainty. Being "begotten again" as a
	"son," he is an "heir," as earthly fathers <i>beget</i>
	children who shall <i>inherit</i> their goods. The <i>inheritance</i>
	is "salvation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:5">1 Peter 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:9">1 Peter 1:9</span>); "the grace to be
	brought at the revelation of Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:9- :">1 Peter 1:9- :</span>); "a crown of glory that fadeth not away." 
	</p>
<p><b>incorruptible</b>—not
	having within the germs of death. Negations of the imperfections
	which meet us on every side here are the chief means of conveying to
	our minds a conception of the heavenly things which "have not
	entered into the heart of man," and which we have not faculties
	now capable of fully knowing. Peter, sanguine, impulsive, and highly
	susceptible of outward impressions, was the more likely to feel
	painfully the deep-seated <i>corruption</i> which, lurking under the
	outward splendor of the loveliest of earthly things, dooms them soon
	to rottenness and decay. 
	</p>
<p><b>undefiled</b>—not stained
	as earthly goods by sin, either in the acquiring, or in the using of
	them; unsusceptible of any stain. "The rich man is either a
	dishonest man himself, or the heir of a dishonest man" [JEROME].
	Even Israel's inheritance was <i>defiled</i> by the people's sins.
	Defilement intrudes even on our holy things now, whereas God's
	service ought to be undefiled. 
	</p>
<p><b>that fadeth not away</b>—Contrast
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:24">1 Peter 1:24</span>. Even the most
	delicate part of the heavenly inheritance, its bloom, continues
	<i>unfading.</i> "In <i>substance</i> incorruptible; in <i>purity</i>
	undefiled; in <i>beauty</i> unfading" [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>reserved</b>—<i>kept up</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>, "<i>laid up</i>
	for you in heaven," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>);
	<i>Greek</i> perfect, expressing a <i>fixed and abiding state,</i>
	"which has been and is reserved." The inheritance is in
	security, beyond risk, out of the reach of Satan, though we for whom
	it is reserved are still in the midst of dangers. Still, if we be
	believers, we too, as well as the inheritance, are "kept"
	(the same <i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span>)
	by Jesus safely (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:5">1 Peter 1:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in heaven</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in the heavens," where it can neither be destroyed nor
	plundered. It does not follow that, because it is <i>now</i> laid up
	in <i>heaven,</i> it shall not <i>hereafter</i> be on <i>earth</i>
	also. 
	</p>
<p><b>for you</b>—It is secure
	not only in itself from all misfortune, but also from all alienation,
	so that no other can receive it in your stead. He had said us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:5- :">1 Peter 1:5- :</span>); he now turns his address to the elect in order to encourage
	and exhort them.</p>
