<p><b>greatly rejoice</b>—"exult
	with joy": "are exuberantly glad." <i>Salvation</i> is
	realized by faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:9">1 Peter 1:9</span>) as a
	thing so actually present as to cause exulting joy in spite of

	"for a little time."

<p><b>if need be</b>—"if it
	be God's will that it should be so" [ALFORD],
	for not all believers are afflicted. One need not invite or lay a
	cross on himself, but only "take up" the cross which God
	imposes ("his cross"); <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:9- :">1 Peter 1:9- :</span> is not to be pressed too far. Not every believer, nor every
	sinner, is tried with afflictions [THEOPHYLACT].
	Some falsely think that notwithstanding our forgiveness in Christ, a
	kind of atonement, or expiation by suffering, is needed.

<p><b>ye are in heaviness</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"ye were grieved." The "grieved" is regarded as
	<i>past,</i> the "exulting joy" present. Because the
	realized joy of the coming salvation makes the <i>present grief</i>
	seem as a thing of the <i>past.</i> At the first shock of affliction
	<i>ye were grieved,</i> but now <i>by anticipation ye rejoice,</i>
	regarding the present grief as past.
