<p><b>7.</b> Aim of the "temptations."
	</p>
<p><b>trial</b>—testing, proving.
	That your <i>faith so proved</i> "may be found (aorist; <i>once
	for all,</i> as the result of its being proved on the judgment-day)
	unto (eventuating in) praise," c., namely, the praise to be
	bestowed by the Judge. 
	</p>
<p><b>than that of gold</b>—rather,
	"than gold." 
	</p>
<p><b>though</b>—"which
	perisheth, YET is tried
	with fire." If gold, though perishing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), is yet tried with fire in order to remove dross and test
	its genuineness, how much more does your faith, which shall never
	perish, need to pass through a fiery trial to remove whatever is
	defective, and to test its genuineness and full value? 
	</p>
<p><b>glory</b>—"Honor"
	is not so strong as "glory." As "praise" is in
	<i>words,</i> so "honor" is in deeds: <i>honorary reward.</i>
</p>
<p><b>appearing</b>—Translate as
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:13">1 Peter 1:13</span>, "revelation."
	At Christ's revelation shall take place also the revelation of the
	sons of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19">Romans 8:19</span>,
	"manifestation," <i>Greek,</i> "revelation" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19- :">Romans 8:19- :</span>, Greek, "manifested . . . manifested," for "appear
	. . . appear").</p>
