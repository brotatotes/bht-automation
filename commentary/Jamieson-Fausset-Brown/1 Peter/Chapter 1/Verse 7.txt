7. Aim of the "temptations."
	trial—testing, proving.
	That your faith so proved "may be found (aorist; once
	for all, as the result of its being proved on the judgment-day)
	unto (eventuating in) praise," c., namely, the praise to be
	bestowed by the Judge. 
	than that of gold—rather,
	"than gold." 
	though—"which
	perisheth, YET is tried
	with fire." If gold, though perishing ( :-), is yet tried with fire in order to remove dross and test
	its genuineness, how much more does your faith, which shall never
	perish, need to pass through a fiery trial to remove whatever is
	defective, and to test its genuineness and full value? 
	glory—"Honor"
	is not so strong as "glory." As "praise" is in
	words, so "honor" is in deeds: honorary reward.
appearing—Translate as
	in 1 Peter 1:13, "revelation."
	At Christ's revelation shall take place also the revelation of the
	sons of God (Romans 8:19,
	"manifestation," Greek, "revelation" Romans 8:19- :, Greek, "manifested . . . manifested," for "appear
	. . . appear").
