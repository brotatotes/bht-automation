	and yet have believed," than they who believed because they have

	in whom—connected with
	"believing": the result of which is "ye rejoice"

	"glorified." A joy now already encompassed with glory.
	The "glory" is partly in present possession, through the
	presence of Christ, "the Lord of glory," in the soul;
	partly in assured anticipation. "The Christian's joy is
	bound up with love to Jesus: its ground is faith; it is
	not therefore either self-seeking or self-sufficient" [STEIGER].
