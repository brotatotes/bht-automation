<p><b>9. Receiving</b>—in sure
	anticipation; "the end of your faith," that is, its
	crowning consummation, finally completed "salvation" (Peter
	here confirms Paul's teaching as to <i>justification by faith</i>):
	also receiving <i>now</i> the title to it and the first-fruits of it.
	In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:10">1 Peter 1:10</span> the "salvation"
	is represented as <i>already present,</i> whereas "the prophets"
	had it not as yet present. It must, therefore, in this verse, refer
	to the present: <i>Deliverance now from a state of wrath:</i>
	believers even now "receive salvation," though its full
	"revelation" is future. 
	</p>
<p><b>of . . . souls</b>—The
	immortal <i>soul</i> was what was lost, so "salvation"
	primarily concerns the soul; the <i>body</i> shall share in
	redemption hereafter; the <i>soul</i> of the believer is saved
	already: an additional proof that "receiving . . . salvation"
	is here a thing present.</p>
