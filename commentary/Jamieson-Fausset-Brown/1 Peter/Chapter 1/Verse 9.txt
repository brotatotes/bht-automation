9. Receiving—in sure
	anticipation; "the end of your faith," that is, its
	crowning consummation, finally completed "salvation" (Peter
	here confirms Paul's teaching as to justification by faith):
	also receiving now the title to it and the first-fruits of it.
	In 1 Peter 1:10 the "salvation"
	is represented as already present, whereas "the prophets"
	had it not as yet present. It must, therefore, in this verse, refer
	to the present: Deliverance now from a state of wrath:
	believers even now "receive salvation," though its full
	"revelation" is future. 
	of . . . souls—The
	immortal soul was what was lost, so "salvation"
	primarily concerns the soul; the body shall share in
	redemption hereafter; the soul of the believer is saved
	already: an additional proof that "receiving . . . salvation"
	is here a thing present.
