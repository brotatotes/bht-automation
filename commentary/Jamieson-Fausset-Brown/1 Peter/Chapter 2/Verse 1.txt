<p><b>1. laying aside</b>â€”once for all:
	so the <i>Greek</i> aorist expresses as a garment <i>put off.</i> The
	exhortation applies to Christians alone, for in none else is the new
	nature existing which, as "the inward man" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) can cast off the old as an outward thing, so that the
	Christian, through the continual renewal of his inward man, can also
	exhibit himself externally as a new man. But to unbelievers the
	demand is addressed, that <i>inwardly,</i> in regard to the <i>nous</i>
	(mind), they must become changed, <i>meta-noeisthai</i> (<i>re-pent</i>)
	[STEIGER]. The "therefore"
	resumes the exhortation begun in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Seeing that ye are born again of an incorruptible seed, be
	not again entangled in evil, which "has no substantial being,
	but is an acting in contrariety to the being formed in us"
	[THEOPHYLACT]. "Malice,"
	c., are utterly inconsistent with the "love of the brethren,"
	unto which ye have "purified your souls" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The vices here are those which offend against the
	BROTHERLY LOVE inculcated
	above. Each succeeding one springs out of that which immediately
	precedes, so as to form a <i>genealogy</i> of the sins against love.
	Out of <i>malice</i> springs <i>guile</i> out of <i>guile, hypocrises</i>
	(pretending to be what we are not, and not showing what we really
	are; the opposite of "love unfeigned," and "without
	dissimulation"); out of <i>hypocrisies, envies</i> of those to
	whom we think ourselves obliged to play the hypocrite; out of <i>envies,
	evil-speaking,</i> malicious, envious detraction of others. <i>Guile</i>
	is the permanent <i>disposition; hypocrisies</i> the <i>acts</i>
	flowing from it. The guileless knows no envy. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "sincere," <i>Greek,</i> "<i>guileless.</i>"
	"<i>Malice</i> delights in another's hurt; <i>envy</i> pines at
	another's good; <i>guile</i> imparts duplicity to the heart;
	<i>hypocrisy</i> (flattery) imparts duplicity to the tongue;
	<i>evil-speakings</i> wound the character of another"
	[AUGUSTINE].</p>
