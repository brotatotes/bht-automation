1. laying asideâ€”once for all:
	so the Greek aorist expresses as a garment put off. The
	exhortation applies to Christians alone, for in none else is the new
	nature existing which, as "the inward man" ( :-) can cast off the old as an outward thing, so that the
	Christian, through the continual renewal of his inward man, can also
	exhibit himself externally as a new man. But to unbelievers the
	demand is addressed, that inwardly, in regard to the nous
	(mind), they must become changed, meta-noeisthai (re-pent)
	[STEIGER]. The "therefore"
	resumes the exhortation begun in  :-. Seeing that ye are born again of an incorruptible seed, be
	not again entangled in evil, which "has no substantial being,
	but is an acting in contrariety to the being formed in us"
	[THEOPHYLACT]. "Malice,"
	c., are utterly inconsistent with the "love of the brethren,"
	unto which ye have "purified your souls" ( :-). The vices here are those which offend against the
	BROTHERLY LOVE inculcated
	above. Each succeeding one springs out of that which immediately
	precedes, so as to form a genealogy of the sins against love.
	Out of malice springs guile out of guile, hypocrises
	(pretending to be what we are not, and not showing what we really
	are; the opposite of "love unfeigned," and "without
	dissimulation"); out of hypocrisies, envies of those to
	whom we think ourselves obliged to play the hypocrite; out of envies,
	evil-speaking, malicious, envious detraction of others. Guile
	is the permanent disposition; hypocrisies the acts
	flowing from it. The guileless knows no envy. Compare  :-, "sincere," Greek, "guileless."
	"Malice delights in another's hurt; envy pines at
	another's good; guile imparts duplicity to the heart;
	hypocrisy (flattery) imparts duplicity to the tongue;
	evil-speakings wound the character of another"
	[AUGUSTINE].
