	Peter plainly confirms Paul, who quotes the passage as implying the
	call of the Gentiles to become spiritually that which Israel had been
	literally, "the people of God." Primarily, the prophecy
	refers to literal Israel, hereafter to be fully that which in their
	best days they were only partially, God's people.

<p><b>not obtained mercy</b>â€”literally,
	"who were men not compassionated." Implying that it was
	God's pure <i>mercy,</i> not their merits, which made the blessed
	change in their state; a thought which ought to kindle their lively
	<i>gratitude,</i> to be shown with their life, as well as their lips.</p>
