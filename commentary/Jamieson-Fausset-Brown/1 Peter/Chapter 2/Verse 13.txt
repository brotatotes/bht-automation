<p><b>13. every ordinance of man</b>—"every
	human institution" [ALFORD],
	literally, "every human <i>creation.</i>" For though of
	divine appointment, yet in the mode of nomination and in the exercise
	of their authority, earthly governors are but human institutions,
	being <i>of men,</i> and <i>in relation to men.</i> The apostle
	speaks as one raised above all human things. But lest they should
	think themselves so ennobled by faith as to be raised above
	subordination to human authorities, he tells them to <i>submit
	themselves for the sake of Christ,</i> who desires you to be subject,
	and who once was subject to earthly rulers Himself, though having all
	things subject to Him, and whose honor is at stake in you as His
	earthly representatives. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Be subject for conscience' sake."

<p><b>king</b>—The Roman emperor
	was "supreme" in the Roman provinces to which this Epistle
	was addressed. The Jewish zealots refused obedience. The distinction
	between "the king as supreme" and "governors sent by
	him" implies that "if the king command one thing, and the
	subordinate magistrate another, we ought rather to obey the superior"
	[AUGUSTINE in GROTIUS].
	Scripture prescribes nothing upon the form of government, but simply
	subjects Christians to that everywhere subsisting, without entering
	into the question of the <i>right</i> of the rulers (thus the Roman
	emperors had by force seized supreme authority, and Rome had, by
	unjustifiable means, made herself mistress of Asia), because the <i>de
	facto</i> governors have not been made by chance, but by the
	providence of God.</p>
