<p><b>14. governors</b>—subordinate to
	the emperor, "sent," or delegated by Cæsar to preside over
	the provinces. 
	</p>
<p><b>for the punishment</b>—No
	tyranny ever has been so unprincipled as that some appearance of
	equity was not maintained in it; however corrupt a government be, God
	never suffers it to be so much so as not to be better than anarchy
	[CALVIN]. Although bad
	kings often oppress the good, yet that is scarcely ever done by
	public authority (and it is of what is done by public authority that
	Peter speaks), save under the mask of right. Tyranny harasses many,
	but anarchy overwhelms the whole state [HORNEIUS].
	The only justifiable exception is in cases where obedience to the
	earthly king plainly involves disobedience to the express command of
	the King of kings.

<p><b>praise of them that do
	well</b>—Every government recognizes the excellence of truly
	Christian subjects. Thus PLINY,
	in his letter to the Emperor Trajan, acknowledges, "I have found
	in them nothing else save a perverse and extravagant superstition."
	The recognition in the long run mitigates persecution (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
