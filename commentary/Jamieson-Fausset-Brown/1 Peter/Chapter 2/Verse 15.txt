<p><b>ignorance</b>—spiritual not
	having "the knowledge of God," and therefore ignorant of
	the children of God, and misconstruing their acts; influenced by mere
	appearances, and ever ready to open their mouths, rather than their
	eyes and ears. Their <i>ignorance</i> should move the believer's
	pity, not his anger. They judge of things which they are incapable of
	judging through unbelief (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Maintain such a walk that they shall have no charge
	against you, except touching your faith; and so their minds shall be
	favorably disposed towards Christianity.</p>
