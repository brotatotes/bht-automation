15. Ground of his directing them
	to submit themselves ( :-). 
	put to silence—literally,
	"to muzzle," "to stop the mouth." 
	ignorance—spiritual not
	having "the knowledge of God," and therefore ignorant of
	the children of God, and misconstruing their acts; influenced by mere
	appearances, and ever ready to open their mouths, rather than their
	eyes and ears. Their ignorance should move the believer's
	pity, not his anger. They judge of things which they are incapable of
	judging through unbelief (compare  :-). Maintain such a walk that they shall have no charge
	against you, except touching your faith; and so their minds shall be
	favorably disposed towards Christianity.
