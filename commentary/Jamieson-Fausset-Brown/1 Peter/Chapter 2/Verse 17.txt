17. Honour all men—according
	to whatever honor is due in each case. Equals have a respect due
	to them. Christ has dignified our humanity by assuming it; therefore
	we should not dishonor, but be considerate to and honor our common
	humanity, even in the very humblest. The first "honor" is
	in the Greek aorist imperative, implying, "In every
	case render promptly every man's due" [ALFORD].
	The second is in the present tense, implying, Habitually
	and continually honor the king. Thus the first is the general
	precept; the three following are its three great divisions. 
	Love—present:
	Habitually love with the special and congenial affection that
	you ought to feel to brethren, besides the general love to all
	men. 
	Fear God . . . the king—The
	king is to be honored; but God alone, in the highest sense,
	feared.
