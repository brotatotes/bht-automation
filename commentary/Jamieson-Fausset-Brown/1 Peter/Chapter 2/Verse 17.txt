<p><b>17. Honour all men</b>—<i>according
	to whatever honor is due in each case.</i> Equals have a respect due
	to them. Christ has dignified our humanity by assuming it; therefore
	we should not dishonor, but be considerate to and honor our common
	humanity, even in the very humblest. The first "honor" is
	in the <i>Greek</i> aorist imperative, implying, "<i>In every
	case render promptly</i> every man's due" [ALFORD].
	The second is in the <i>present</i> tense, implying, <i>Habitually
	and continually</i> honor the king. Thus the first is the general
	precept; the three following are its three great divisions.

<p><b>Love</b>—present:
	<i>Habitually love</i> with the special and congenial affection that
	you ought to feel to brethren, besides the general <i>love</i> to all
	men. 
	</p>
<p><b>Fear God . . . the king</b>—The
	king is to be <i>honored;</i> but God alone, in the highest sense,
	<i>feared.</i></p>
