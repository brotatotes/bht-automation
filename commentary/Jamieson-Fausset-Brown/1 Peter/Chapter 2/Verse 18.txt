<p><b>18. Servants</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"household servants": not here the <i>Greek</i> for
	"slaves." Probably including <i>freedmen</i> still
	remaining in their master's house. <i>Masters</i> were not commonly
	Christians: he therefore mentions only the duties of the <i>servants.</i>
	These were then often persecuted by their unbelieving masters.
	Peter's special object seems to be to teach them <i>submission,</i>
	whatever the character of the masters might be. Paul not having this
	as his prominent design, includes <i>masters</i> in his monitions. 
	</p>
<p><b>be subject</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"being subject": the participle expresses a particular
	instance of the general exhortation to good conduct, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:11">1 Peter 2:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12">1 Peter 2:12</span>, of which the first
	particular precept is given <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12- :">1 Peter 2:12- :</span>, "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the
	Lord's sake." The general exhortation is taken up again in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12- :">1 Peter 2:12- :</span>; and so the participle <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12- :">1 Peter 2:12- :</span>, "being subject," is joined to the hortatory
	imperatives going before, namely, "abstain," "submit
	yourselves." "honor all men." 
	</p>
<p><b>with</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>in.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>all</b>—all possible: under
	all circumstances, such as are presently detailed. 
	</p>
<p><b>fear</b>—the awe of one
	subject: God, however, is the ultimate object of the "fear":
	<i>fear</i> "for the Lord's sake" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:12- :">1 Peter 2:12- :</span>), not merely slavish fear of masters. 
	</p>
<p><b>good</b>—kind. 
	</p>
<p><b>gentle</b>—indulgent
	towards errors: considerate: yielding, not exacting all which justice
	might demand. 
	</p>
<p><b>froward</b>—perverse:
	harsh. Those bound to obey must not make the disposition and behavior
	of the superior the measure of the fulfilment of their obligations.</p>
