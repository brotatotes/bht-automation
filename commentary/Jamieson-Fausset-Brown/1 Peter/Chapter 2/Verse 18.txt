18. Servants—Greek,
	"household servants": not here the Greek for
	"slaves." Probably including freedmen still
	remaining in their master's house. Masters were not commonly
	Christians: he therefore mentions only the duties of the servants.
	These were then often persecuted by their unbelieving masters.
	Peter's special object seems to be to teach them submission,
	whatever the character of the masters might be. Paul not having this
	as his prominent design, includes masters in his monitions. 
	be subject—Greek,
	"being subject": the participle expresses a particular
	instance of the general exhortation to good conduct, 1 Peter 2:11;
	1 Peter 2:12, of which the first
	particular precept is given 1 Peter 2:12- :, "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the
	Lord's sake." The general exhortation is taken up again in 1 Peter 2:12- :; and so the participle 1 Peter 2:12- :, "being subject," is joined to the hortatory
	imperatives going before, namely, "abstain," "submit
	yourselves." "honor all men." 
	with—Greek,
	"in." 
	all—all possible: under
	all circumstances, such as are presently detailed. 
	fear—the awe of one
	subject: God, however, is the ultimate object of the "fear":
	fear "for the Lord's sake" (1 Peter 2:12- :), not merely slavish fear of masters. 
	good—kind. 
	gentle—indulgent
	towards errors: considerate: yielding, not exacting all which justice
	might demand. 
	froward—perverse:
	harsh. Those bound to obey must not make the disposition and behavior
	of the superior the measure of the fulfilment of their obligations.
