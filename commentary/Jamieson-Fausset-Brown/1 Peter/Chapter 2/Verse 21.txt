<p><b>hereunto</b>—to the patient
	endurance of unmerited suffering (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Christ is an example to servants, even as He was once in
	"the form of a servant."

<p><b>for us</b>—<i>His dying for
	us</i> is the highest exemplification of "doing well" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Ye must patiently suffer, being innocent, as Christ also
	innocently suffered (not for Himself, but <i>for us</i>). The oldest
	manuscripts for "us . . . us," read, "you . . . for
	you." Christ's sufferings, while they are for an example, were
	also primarily sufferings "<i>for us,</i>" a consideration
	which imposes an everlasting obligation on us to please Him.
