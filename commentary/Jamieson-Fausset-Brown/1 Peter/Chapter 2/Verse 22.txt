	though suffering.

<p><b>did</b>—<i>Greek</i>

</p>
<p><b>neither</b>—nor yet: not
	even [ALFORD]. Sinlessness
	as to the <i>mouth</i> is a mark of <i>perfection. Guile</i> is a
	common fault of servants. "If any boast of his innocency, Christ
	surely did not suffer as an evildoer" [CALVIN],
	yet He took it patiently (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:9- :">Isaiah 53:9- :</span>). On Christ's sinlessness, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>;
