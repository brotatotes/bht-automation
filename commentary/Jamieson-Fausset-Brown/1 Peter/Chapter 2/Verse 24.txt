<p><b>24. his own self</b>—there being
	<i>none other</i> but <i>Himself</i> who could have done it. His
	<i>voluntary</i> undertaking of the work of redemption is implied.
	The <i>Greek</i> puts in antithetical juxtaposition, OUR,
	and His OWN SELF, to mark
	the idea of <i>His substitution for us.</i> His "well-doing"
	in His sufferings is set forth here as an example to servants and to
	us all (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:20">1 Peter 2:20</span>).

<p><b>bare</b>—to sacrifice:
	<i>carried and offered up:</i> a sacrificial term. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11">Isaiah 53:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12">Isaiah 53:12</span>, "He <i>bare</i>
	the sin of many": where the <i>idea of bearing on Himself</i> is
	the prominent one; here the <i>offering in sacrifice</i> is combined
	with that idea. So the same <i>Greek</i> means in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12- :">Isaiah 53:12- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>our sins</b>—In <i>offering</i>
	or <i>presenting in sacrifice</i> (as the <i>Greek</i> for "bare"
	implies) His body, Christ offered in it the <i>guilt</i> of our sins
	upon the cross, as upon the altar of God, that it might be expiated
	in Him, and so taken away from us. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12- :">Isaiah 53:12- :</span>, "Thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin."
	Peter thus means by "bare" what the <i>Syriac</i> takes two
	words to express, <i>to bear</i> and <i>to offer:</i> (1) He hath
	<i>borne</i> our sins laid upon Him [namely, their guilt, curse, and
	punishment]; (2) He hath so borne them that He <i>offered</i> them
	along with Himself on the altar. He refers to the animals upon which
	sins were first laid, and which were then <i>offered</i> thus laden
	[VITRINGA]. Sin or guilt
	among the Semitic nations is considered as a burden lying heavily
	upon the sinner [GESENIUS].
	</p>
<p><b>on the tree</b>—the cross,
	the proper place for One on whom the <i>curse</i> was laid: this
	curse stuck to Him until it was legally (through His death as the
	guilt-bearer) destroyed in His body: thus the handwriting of the bond
	against us is cancelled by His death. 
	</p>
<p><b>that we being dead to
	sins</b>—the effect of His death to "sin" in the
	aggregate, and to all particular "sins," namely, that we
	should be as entirely <i>delivered from</i> them, as a slave that is
	<i>dead</i> is delivered from service <i>to</i> his master. This is
	our spiritful <i>standing</i> through faith by virtue of Christ's
	death: our actual mortification of particular <i>sins</i> is in
	proportion to the degree of our effectually being made conformable to
	His death. "That we should <i>die to the sins</i> whose
	collected guilt Christ carried away in His death, and so LIVE
	TO THE RIGHTEOUSNESS (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12- :">Isaiah 53:12- :</span>. 'My <i>righteous</i> servant shall <i>justify</i> many'),
	the gracious relation to God which He has brought in" [STEIGER].

	paradox, yet true. "Ye servants (compare 'buffeted,' 'the tree,'
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:20">1 Peter 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:24">1 Peter 2:24</span>)
	often bear <i>the strife;</i> but it is not more than your Lord
	Himself bore; learn from Him patience in wrongful sufferings.</p>
