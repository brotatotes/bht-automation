<p><b>3.</b> Peter alludes to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The first "tastes" of God's goodness are
	afterwards followed by fuller and happier experiences. A taste whets
	the appetite [BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>gracious</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"good," benignant, kind; as God is revealed to us in
	Christ, "the Lord" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), we who are born again ought so to be <i>good</i> and <i>kind</i>
	to the brethren (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span>).
	"Whosoever has not tasted the word to him it is not sweet it has
	not reached the heart; but to them who have experienced it, who with
	the heart believe, 'Christ has been sent <i>for me</i> and is become
	<i>my own:</i> my miseries are His, and His <i>life</i> mine,' it
	tastes sweet" [LUTHER].</p>
