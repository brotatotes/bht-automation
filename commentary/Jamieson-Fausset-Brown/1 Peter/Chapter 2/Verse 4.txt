<p><b>4. coming</b>—<i>drawing near</i>
	(same <i>Greek</i> as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) by faith continually; present tense: not having come once
	for all at conversion. 
	</p>
<p><b>stone</b>—<i>Peter</i>
	(that is, <i>a stone,</i> named so by Christ) desires that all
	similarly should be <i>living stones</i> BUILT
	ON CHRIST, THE TRUE
	FOUNDATION-STONE; compare his speech in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. An undesigned coincidence and mark of genuineness. The
	Spirit foreseeing the Romanist perversion of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16">Matthew 16:16</span>,
	"Son of the LIVING
	God," which coincides with his language here, "the LIVING
	stone"), presciently makes Peter himself to refuse it. He herein
	confirms Paul's teaching. Omit the <i>as unto</i> of <i>English
	Version.</i> Christ is positively termed the "living stone";
	<i>living,</i> as having life in Himself from the beginning, and as
	raised from the dead to live evermore (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16- :">Matthew 16:16- :</span>) after His rejection by men, and so the source of life to
	us. Like no earthly <i>rock,</i> He lives and gives life. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:16- :">Matthew 16:16- :</span>, and the type, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+17:6">Exodus 17:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:11">Numbers 20:11</span>.

<p><b>disallowed</b>—rejected,
	reprobated; referred to also by Christ Himself: also by Paul; compare
	the kindred prophecies, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34">Luke 2:34</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>chosen of God</b>—literally,
	"<i>with</i> (or '<i>in the presence and judgment of</i>') God
	elect," or, "chosen out" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:34- :">Luke 2:34- :</span>). Many are alienated from the Gospel, because it is not
	everywhere in favor, but is on the contrary rejected by most men.
	Peter answers that, though rejected by men, Christ is peculiarly the
	<i>stone</i> of salvation honored by God, first so designated by
	Jacob in his deathbed prophecy.</p>
