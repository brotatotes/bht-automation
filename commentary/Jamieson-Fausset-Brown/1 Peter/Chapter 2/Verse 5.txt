<p><b>5. Ye also, as lively
	stones</b>—partaking of the name and life which is in "THE
	LIVING STONE"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>).
	Many names which belong to Christ in the singular are assigned to
	Christians in the plural. He is "THE
	SON," "High
	Priest," "King," "Lamb"; they, "sons,"
	"priests," "kings," "sheep," "lambs."
	So the Shulamite called from Solomon [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>are built up</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"are being built up," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11- :">1 Corinthians 3:11- :</span>. Not as ALFORD,
	"Be ye built up." Peter grounds his exhortations, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:2">1 Peter 2:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:11">1 Peter 2:11</span>, c., on their conscious
	sense of their high privileges as <i>living stones in the course of
	being built up into a spiritual house</i> (that is, "the
	habitation of the Spirit"). 
	</p>
<p><b>priesthood</b>—Christians
	are both the spiritual <i>temple</i> and the <i>priests</i> of the
	temple. There are two <i>Greek</i> words for "temple"
	<i>hieron</i> (<i>the sacred place</i>), the whole building,
	including the courts wherein the sacrifice <i>was killed;</i> and
	<i>naos</i> (<i>the dwelling,</i> namely, of God), the inner shrine
	wherein God peculiarly manifested Himself, and where, in the holiest
	place, the <i>blood</i> of the slain sacrifice was presented before
	Him. All believers alike, and not merely ministers, are now the
	dwelling of God (and are called the "<i>naos,</i>" <i>Greek,</i>
	not the <i>hieron</i>) and priests unto God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:11- :">1 Peter 2:11- :</span>). The minister is not, like the Jewish priest (<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>hiercus</i>"), admitted nearer to God than the people,
	but merely for order's sake leads the spiritual services of the
	people. <i>Priest</i> is the abbreviation of <i>presbyter</i> in the
	<i>Church of England Prayer Book,</i> not corresponding to the
	Aaronic <i>priest</i> (<i>hiereus,</i> who offered <i>literal</i>
	sacrifices). Christ is the only literal <i>hiereus-priest</i> in the
	New Testament through whom alone we may always draw near to God.
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>, "a royal
	priesthood," that is, <i>a body of priest-kings,</i> such as was
	Melchisedec. The Spirit never, in New Testament, gives the name
	<i>hiereus,</i> or <i>sacerdotal</i> priest, to ministers of the
	Gospel. 
	</p>
<p><b>holy</b>—consecrated to
	God. 
	</p>
<p><b>spiritual sacrifices</b>—not
	the literal one of the mass, as the Romish self-styled disciples of
	Peter teach. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:7">Isaiah 56:7</span>,
	which compare with "<i>acceptable</i> to God" here; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+4:5">Psalms 4:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+50:14">Psalms 50:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:17">Psalms 51:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:19">Psalms 51:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+14:2">Hosea 14:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</span>. "Among spiritual
	sacrifices the first place belongs to the general oblation of
	ourselves. For never can we offer anything to God until we have
	offered ourselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:5">2 Corinthians 8:5</span>) in
	sacrifice to Him. There follow afterwards prayers, giving of thanks,
	alms deeds, and all exercises of piety" [CALVIN].
	Christian houses of worship are never called temples because the
	<i>temple</i> was a place for <i>sacrifice,</i> which has no place in
	the Christian dispensation; the Christian temple is the congregation
	of spiritual worshippers. The synagogue (where reading of Scripture
	and prayer constituted the worship) was the model of the Christian
	house of worship (compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:5- :">2 Corinthians 8:5- :</span>, <i>Greek,</i> "synagogue"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:5- :">2 Corinthians 8:5- :</span>). Our sacrifices are those of prayer, praise, and
	self-denying services in the cause of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:5- :">2 Corinthians 8:5- :</span>, end). 
	</p>
<p><b>by Jesus Christ</b>—as our
	mediating High Priest before God. Connect these words with "offer
	up." Christ is both <i>precious</i> Himself and makes us
	<i>accepted</i> [BENGEL].
	As the temple, so also the priesthood, is built on Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:4">1 Peter 2:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:5">1 Peter 2:5</span>) [BEZA].
	Imperfect as are our services, we are not with unbelieving timidity,
	which is close akin to refined self-righteousness, to doubt their
	acceptance THROUGH CHRIST.
	After extolling the dignity of Christians he goes back to CHRIST
	as the sole source of it.</p>
