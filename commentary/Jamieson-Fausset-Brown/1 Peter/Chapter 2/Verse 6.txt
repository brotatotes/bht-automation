6. Wherefore also—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "Because that." The statement above is so
	"because it is contained in Scripture." 
	Behold—calling
	attention to the glorious announcement of His eternal counsel. 
	elect—so also believers
	(1 Peter 2:9, "chosen,"
	Greek, "elect generation"). 
	precious—in Hebrew,
Isaiah 28:16, "a
	corner-stone of preciousness." See on Isaiah 28:16- :. So in 1 Peter 2:7, Christ
	is said to be, to believers, "precious," Greek,
	"preciousness." 
	confounded—same Greek
	as in Romans 9:33 (Peter here as
	elsewhere confirming Paul's teaching. See Romans 9:33- :
	also Romans 10:11), "ashamed."
	In Isaiah 28:16, "make
	haste," that is, flee in sudden panic, covered with the shame
	of confounded hopes.
