<p><b>7.</b> Application of the Scripture
	just quoted first to the believer, then to the unbeliever. On the
	opposite effects of the same Gospel on different classes, compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:39">John 9:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:15">2 Corinthians 2:15</span>;

<p><b>precious</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"THE preciousness"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6">1 Peter 2:6</span>). To you believers
	belongs <i>the preciousness</i> of Christ just mentioned. 
	</p>
<p><b>disobedient</b>—to the
	faith, and so disobedient in practice. 
	</p>
<p><b>the stone which . . . head of
	. . . corner</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:22">Psalms 118:22</span>).
	Those who rejected the STONE
	were all the while in spite of themselves unconsciously contributing
	to its becoming Head of the corner. The same magnet has two poles,
	the one repulsive, the other attractive; so the Gospel has opposite
	effects on believers and unbelievers respectively.</p>
