<p><b>8. stone of stumbling,</b> c.—quoted
	from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:14">Isaiah 8:14</span>. Not merely they
	<i>stumbled,</i> in that their prejudices were offended but their
	stumbling implies the <i>judicial punishment</i> of their reception
	of Messiah; they hurt themselves in stumbling over the corner-stone,
	as "stumble" means in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+13:16">Jeremiah 13:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:19">Daniel 11:19</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>at the word</b>—rather,
	join "being disobedient to the word"; so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17">1 Peter 4:17</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>whereunto</b>—to penal
	<i>stumbling;</i> to the judicial punishment of their unbelief. See
	above. 
	</p>
<p><b>also</b>—an additional
	thought; God's ordination; not that God ordains or <i>appoints</i>
	them to <i>sin,</i> but they are given up to "the fruit of <i>their
	own</i> ways" according to the eternal counsel of God. The moral
	ordering of the world is altogether of God. God appoints the ungodly
	to be <i>given up unto</i> sin, and a <i>reprobate mind,</i> and its
	necessary penalty. "Were appointed," <i>Greek,</i> "set,"
	answers to "<i>I</i> lay," <i>Greek,</i> "set,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:6">1 Peter 2:6</span>. God, in the active, is
	said to <i>appoint</i> Christ and the elect (directly). Unbelievers,
	in the passive, are said to be <i>appointed</i> (God acting less
	directly in the appointment of the sinner's awful course) [BENGEL].
	God ordains the wicked to punishment, not to crime [J. CAPPEL].
	"Appointed" or "set" (not here "FORE-ordained")
	refers, not to the eternal counsel so directly, as to the penal
	justice of God. Through the same Christ whom sinners rejected, they
	shall be rejected; unlike believers, they are by God <i>appointed
	unto wrath</i> as FITTED
	for it. The lost shall lay all the blame of their ruin on their own
	sinful perversity, not on God's decree; the saved shall ascribe all
	the merit of their salvation to God's electing love and grace.</p>
