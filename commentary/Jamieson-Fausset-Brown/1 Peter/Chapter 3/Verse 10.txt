	literally, "cause to cease"; implying that our natural
	inclination and custom is to speak evil. "Men commonly think
	that they would be exposed to the wantonness of their enemies if they
	did not strenuously vindicate their rights. But the Spirit promises a
	life of blessedness to none but those who are gentle and patient of
	evils" [CALVIN].

	deceitful, double-tongued speaking; next, against <i>acts</i> of
	injury to one's neighbor.</p>
