	<i>eyes</i> imply <i>favorable</i> regard; the <i>face</i> of the
	Lord <i>upon</i> (not as <i>English Version,</i> "against")
	them that do evil, implies that He narrowly observes them, so as not
	to let them really and lastingly hurt His people (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:15- :">1 John 5:15- :</span>).</p>
