13. who . . . will harm you—This
	fearless confidence in God's protection from harm, Christ, the Head,
	in His sufferings realized; so His members. 
	if ye be—Greek,
	"if ye have become." 
	followers—The oldest
	manuscripts read "emulous," "zealous of" ( :-). 
	good—The contrast in
	Greek is, "Who will do you evil, if ye be zealous
	of good?"
