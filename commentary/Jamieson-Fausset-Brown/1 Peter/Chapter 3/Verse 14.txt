<p><b>14. But and if</b>—"But if
	even." "The promises of <i>this</i> life extend only so far
	as it is expedient for us that they should be fulfilled"
	[CALVIN]. So he proceeds
	to state the exceptions to the promise (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and how the truly wise will behave in such exceptional
	cases. "If ye should <i>suffer</i>"; if it should so
	happen; "suffer," a milder word than <i>harm.</i>
</p>
<p><b>for righteousness</b>—"not
	the suffering, but the cause for which one suffers, makes the martyr"
	[AUGUSTINE]. 
	</p>
<p><b>happy</b>—Not even can
	<i>suffering</i> take away your <i>blessedness,</i> but rather
	promotes it. 
	</p>
<p><b>and</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"but." Do not impair your blessing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) by <i>fearing</i> man's <i>terror</i> in your times of
	adversity. Literally, "Be not terrified with their terror,"
	that is, with that which they try to strike into you, and which
	strikes themselves when in adversity. This verse and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> is quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:12">Isaiah 8:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:13">Isaiah 8:13</span>. God alone is to be
	feared; he that fears God has none else to fear. 
	</p>
<p><b>neither be troubled</b>—the
	threat of the law, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+26:36">Leviticus 26:36</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+28:65">Deuteronomy 28:65</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+28:66">Deuteronomy 28:66</span>;
	in contrast to which the Gospel gives the believer a heart assured of
	God's favor, and therefore unruffled, amidst all adversities. Not
	only be not <i>afraid,</i> but be not even <i>agitated.</i></p>
