15. sanctify—hallow; honor
	as holy, enshrining Him in your hearts. So in the Lord's
	Prayer, Matthew 6:9. God's holiness
	is thus glorified in our hearts as the dwelling-place of His Spirit. 
	the Lord God—The oldest
	manuscripts read "Christ." Translate, "Sanctify Christ
	as Lord." 
	and—Greek,
	"but," or "moreover." Besides this inward
	sanctification of God in the heart, be also ready always to give,
	c. 
	answer—an apologetic
	answer defending your faith. 
	to every man that asketh
	you—The last words limit the universality of the "always"
	not to a roller, but to everyone among the heathen who inquires
	honestly. 
	a reason—a reasonable
	account. This refutes Rome's dogma, "I believe it, because the
	Church believes it." Credulity is believing without evidence;
	faith is believing on evidence. There is no repose for reason itself
	but in faith. This verse does not impose an obligation to bring
	forward a learned proof and logical defense of revelation. But as
	believers deny themselves, crucify the world, and brave persecution,
	they must be buoyed up by some strong "hope"; men of the
	world, having no such hope themselves, are moved by curiosity to ask
	the secret of this hope; the believer must be ready to give an
	experimental account "how this hope arose in him, what it
	contains, and on what it rests" [STEIGER].
	with—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "but with." Be ready, but
	with "meekness." Not pertly and arrogantly. 
	meekness— (Matthew 6:9- :). The most effective way; not self-sufficient impetuosity. 
	fear—due respect
	towards man, and reverence towards God, remembering His cause does
	not need man's hot temper to uphold it.
