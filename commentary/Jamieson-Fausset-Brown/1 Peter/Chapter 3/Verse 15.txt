<p><b>15. sanctify</b>—<i>hallow; honor
	as holy,</i> enshrining Him <i>in your hearts.</i> So in the Lord's
	Prayer, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:9">Matthew 6:9</span>. God's holiness
	is thus glorified in our hearts as the dwelling-place of His Spirit. 
	</p>
<p><b>the Lord God</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read "Christ." Translate, "Sanctify <i>Christ
	as Lord.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>and</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"but," or "moreover." <i>Besides</i> this inward
	sanctification of God <i>in the heart, be also ready always to give,</i>
	c. 
	</p>
<p><b>answer</b>—an apologetic
	answer defending your faith. 
	</p>
<p><b>to every man that asketh
	you</b>—The last words limit the universality of the "always"
	not to a roller, but to everyone among the heathen who inquires
	honestly. 
	</p>
<p><b>a reason</b>—a reasonable
	account. This refutes Rome's dogma, "I believe it, because the
	Church believes it." Credulity is believing without evidence;
	faith is believing on evidence. There is no repose for reason itself
	but in faith. This verse does not impose an obligation to bring
	forward a learned proof and logical defense of revelation. But as
	believers deny themselves, crucify the world, and brave persecution,
	they must be buoyed up by some strong "hope"; men of the
	world, having no such hope themselves, are moved by curiosity to <i>ask</i>
	the secret of this hope; the believer must be <i>ready</i> to give an
	<i>experimental account</i> "how this hope arose in him, what it
	contains, and on what it rests" [STEIGER].
	</p>
<p><b>with</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "<i>but</i> with." Be ready, <i>but</i>
	with "meekness." Not pertly and arrogantly. 
	</p>
<p><b>meekness</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:9- :">Matthew 6:9- :</span>). The most effective way; not self-sufficient impetuosity. 
	</p>
<p><b>fear</b>—due respect
	towards man, and reverence towards God, remembering His cause does
	not need man's hot temper to uphold it.</p>
