16. Having a good conscience—the
	secret spring of readiness to give account of our hope.
	So hope and good conscience go together in Acts 24:15;
	Acts 24:16. Profession without
	practice has no weight. But those who have a good conscience
	can afford to give an account of their hope "with meekness."
	whereas— (Acts 24:16- :). 
	they speak evil of you, as of
	evildoers—One oldest manuscript reads, "ye are spoken
	against," omitting the rest. 
	falsely accuse—"calumniate";
	the Greek expresses malice shown in deeds as well as in words.
	It is translated, "despitefully use," Matthew 5:44;
	Luke 6:28. 
	conversation—life,
	conduct. 
	in Christ—who is the
	very element of your life as Christians. "In Christ"
	defines "good." It is your good walk as Christians,
	not as citizens, that calls forth malice (1 Peter 4:4;
	1 Peter 4:5; 1 Peter 4:14).
