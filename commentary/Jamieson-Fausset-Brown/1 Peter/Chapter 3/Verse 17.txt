<p><b>17. better</b>—One may object, I
	would not bear it so ill if I had deserved it. Peter replies, it is
	<i>better</i> that you did not deserve it, in order that doing well
	and yet being spoken against, you may prove yourself a true Christian
	[GERHARD]. 
	</p>
<p><b>if the will of God be
	so</b>—rather as the optative is in the oldest manuscripts, "if
	the will of God should will it so." Those who honor God's will
	as their highest law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:15">1 Peter 2:15</span>)
	have the comfort to know that suffering is God's appointment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:15- :">1 Peter 2:15- :</span>). So Christ Himself; our inclination does not wish it.</p>
