	That is "better," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, means of which we are rendered more like to Christ in death
	and in life; for His death brought the best issue to Himself and to

<p><b>Christ</b>—the Anointed
	<i>Holy</i> One of God; the <i>Holy</i> suffered for <i>sins,</i> the
	<i>Just</i> for the <i>unjust.</i>

<p><b>also</b>—as well as
	yourselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:17">1 Peter 3:17</span>). Compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:21">1 Peter 2:21</span>; there His suffering
	was brought forward as an example to us; here, as a proof of the
	blessedness of suffering for well-doing. 
	</p>
<p><b>once</b>—for all; never
	again to suffer. It is "better" for us also once to suffer
	with Christ, than for ever without Christ We now are suffering our
	"once"; it will soon be a thing of the past; a bright
	consolation to the tried. 
	</p>
<p><b>for sins</b>—as though He
	had Himself committed them. He exposed Himself to death by His
	"confession," even as we are called on to "give an
	answer to him that asketh a reason of our hope." This was
	"well-doing" in its highest manifestation. As He suffered,
	"The Just," so we ought willingly to suffer, for
	<i>righteousness'</i> sake (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:21- :">1 Peter 2:21- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:12">1 Peter 3:12</span>;

<p><b>that he might bring us to
	God</b>—together with Himself in His ascension to the right hand of
	God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>). He brings us,
	"the unjust," justified together with Him into heaven. So
	the result of Christ's death is His <i>drawing men to Him;</i>
	spiritually now, in our having <i>access into the Holiest,</i> opened
	by Christ's ascension; literally hereafter. "Bring us,"
	moreover, by the same steps of humiliation and exaltation through
	which He Himself passed. The several steps of Christ's progress from
	lowliness to glory are trodden over again by His people in virtue of
	their oneness with Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22- :">1 Peter 3:22- :</span>). "To God," is <i>Greek</i> dative (not the
	preposition and case), implying that <i>God wishes it</i> [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>put to death</b>—the means
	of His <i>bringing us to God.</i>
</p>
<p><b>in the flesh</b>—that is,
	<i>in respect to</i> the life of <i>flesh</i> and blood. 
	</p>
<p><b>quickened by the Spirit</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts omit the <i>Greek</i> article. Translate with the
	preposition "in," as the antithesis to the previous "<i>in</i>
	the flesh" requires, "IN
	spirit," that is, in respect to His Spirit. "Put to death"
	in the former <i>mode of life;</i> "quickened" in the
	other. Not that His Spirit ever died and was <i>quickened,</i> or
	made alive again, but whereas He had lived after the manner of mortal
	men in the flesh, He <i>began to live a spiritual</i> "resurrection"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>) <i>life,</i> whereby
	He has the power to bring us to God. Two ways of explaining <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:19">1 Peter 3:19</span>, are open to us: (1)
	"Quickened in Spirit," that is, <i>immediately</i> on His
	release from the "flesh," the energy of His undying
	spirit-life was "quickened" by God the Father, into new
	modes of action, namely, "in the Spirit He <i>went</i> down (as
	subsequently He <i>went</i> up to heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:19- :">1 Peter 3:19- :</span>, the same <i>Greek</i> verb) and heralded [not <i>salvation,</i>
	as ALFORD, contrary to
	Scripture, which everywhere represents man's state, whether saved or
	lost, after death irreversible. Nor is any mention made of the
	<i>conversion</i> of the spirits in prison. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:19- :">1 Peter 3:19- :</span>. Nor is the phrase here 'preached <i>the Gospel</i>'
	(<i>evangelizo</i>), but 'heralded' (<i>ekeruxe</i>) or 'preached';
	but simply <i>made the announcement</i> of His finished work; so the
	same <i>Greek</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:45">Mark 1:45</span>,
	'publish,' confirming Enoch and Noah's testimony, and thereby
	declaring the virtual condemnation of their unbelief, and the
	salvation of Noah and believers; a sample of the similar opposite
	effects of the same work on <i>all</i> unbelievers, and believers,
	respectively; also a consolation to those whom Peter addresses, in
	their sufferings at the hands of unbelievers; specially selected for
	the sake of 'baptism,' its 'antitype' (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:45- :">Mark 1:45- :</span>), which, as a seal, marks believers as separated from the
	rest of the doomed world] to the spirits (His <i>Spirit</i> speaking
	to the <i>spirits</i>) in prison (in Hades or Sheol, awaiting the
	judgment, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>), which were
	of old disobedient when," c. (2) The strongest point in favor of
	(1) is the position of "sometime," that is, <i>of old,</i>
	connected with "disobedient" whereas if the <i>preaching</i>
	or announcing were a thing long past, we should expect "sometime,"
	or <i>of old,</i> to be joined to "went and preached." But
	this transposition may express that <i>their disobedience preceded
	His preaching.</i> The <i>Greek</i> participle expresses the reason
	of His <i>preaching,</i> "<i>inasmuch as</i> they were sometime
	disobedient" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:6">1 Peter 4:6</span>).
	Also "went" seems to mean a <i>personal</i> going, as in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>, not merely <i>in
	spirit.</i> But see the answer below. The objections are "quickened"
	must refer to Christ's <i>body</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22- :">1 Peter 3:22- :</span>, end), for as His <i>Spirit</i> never ceased to live, it
	cannot be said to be "quickened." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>, and other passages,
	where "quicken" is used of the <i>bodily</i> resurrection.
	Also, not His <i>Spirit,</i> but His <i>soul,</i> went to Hades. His
	Spirit was commended by Him at death to His Father, and was thereupon
	"in Paradise." The theory—(1) would thus require that His
	descent to the spirits in prison should be <i>after</i> His
	resurrection! Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:9">Ephesians 4:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:10">Ephesians 4:10</span>, which makes the <i>descent</i>
	precede the <i>ascent.</i> Also Scripture elsewhere is silent about
	such a heralding, though possibly Christ's death had immediate
	effects on the state of both the godly and the ungodly in Hades: the
	souls of the godly heretofore in comparative confinement, perhaps
	then having been, as some Fathers thought, translated to God's
	immediate and heavenly presence; but this cannot be <i>proved</i>
	from Scripture. Compare however, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>. <i>Prison</i> is always
	used in a <i>bad</i> sense in Scripture. "Paradise" and
	"Abraham's bosom," the abode of good spirits in Old
	Testament times, are separated by a wide gulf from Hell or Hades, and
	cannot be called "prison." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:2">2 Corinthians 12:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:4">2 Corinthians 12:4</span>, where "paradise"
	and the "third heaven" correspond. Also, why should the
	antediluvian unbelievers in particular be selected as the objects of
	His preaching in Hades? Therefore explain: "Quickened in spirit,
	in which (as distinguished from <i>in person;</i> the words "in
	which," that is, <i>in spirit,</i> expressly obviating the
	objection that "went" implies a <i>personal going</i>) He
	went (in the person of Noah, "a preacher of righteousness,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>: ALFORD'S
	own <i>Note,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span>, is
	the best reply to his argument from "went" that a <i>local</i>
	going to Hades <i>in person</i> is meant. As "He CAME
	and preached peace" <i>by His Spirit</i> in the apostles and
	ministers after His death and ascension: so before His incarnation He
	preached in Spirit through Noah to the antediluvians, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:18">John 14:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:28">John 14:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:23">Acts 26:23</span>.
	"Christ should show," literally, "<i>announce</i>
	light to the Gentiles") and preached unto the spirits in prison,
	that is, the antediluvians, whose bodies indeed seemed free, but
	their spirits were in prison, shut up in the earth as one great
	condemned cell (exactly parallel to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:22">Isaiah 24:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:23">Isaiah 24:23</span> "upon the earth .
	. . they shall be gathered together as <i>prisoners</i> are gathered
	in the pit, and shall be shut up <i>in the prison,</i>" c. [just
	as the fallen angels are judicially regarded as "in chains of
	darkness," though for a time now at large on the earth, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:23- :">Isaiah 24:23- :</span>], where <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span> has a
	plain allusion to the flood, "the <i>windows from on high</i>
	are open," compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+7:11">Genesis 7:11</span>)
	from this prison the only way of escape was that preached by Christ
	in Noah. Christ, who in our times came in the flesh, in the days of
	Noah preached <i>in Spirit</i> by Noah to the spirits then in prison
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span>, end, "the
	Spirit of the Lord God hath sent me to <i>proclaim</i> the opening of
	the <i>prison</i> to them that are bound"). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1- :">Isaiah 61:1- :</span>, "the Spirit of Christ" is said to have testified
	in the prophets. As Christ suffered even to death by enemies, and was
	afterwards quickened in virtue of His "Spirit" (or divine
	nature, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3">Romans 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>), which henceforth
	acted in its full energy, the first result of which was the raising
	of His body (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>, end)
	from the prison of the grave and His soul from Hades; so the same
	Spirit of Christ enabled Noah, amidst reproach and trials, to preach
	to the disobedient spirits fast bound in wrath. That Spirit in you
	can enable you also to suffer patiently now, looking for the
	resurrection deliverance.</p>
