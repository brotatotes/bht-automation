<p><b>20. once</b>—not in the oldest
	manuscripts. 
	</p>
<p><b>when . . . the long-suffering
	of God waited in the days of Noah</b>—Oldest manuscripts. <i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>was continuing to wait on</i>" (if haply men in the
	hundred twenty years of grace would repent) until the <i>end</i> of
	His waiting came in their death by the flood. This refutes ALFORD'S
	idea of a second day of grace having been given in Hades. Noah's days
	are selected, as the ark and the destroying flood answer respectively
	to "baptism" and the coming destruction of unbelievers by
	fire. 
	</p>
<p><b>while the ark was
	a-preparing</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:7">Hebrews 11:7</span>).
	A long period of God's "long-suffering and waiting," as
	Noah had few to help him, which rendered the world's unbelief the
	more inexcusable. 
	</p>
<p><b>wherein</b>—literally, "(by
	having entered) <i>into</i> which." 
	</p>
<p><b>eight</b>—seven (the sacred
	number) with ungodly Ham. 
	</p>
<p><b>few</b>—so now. 
	</p>
<p><b>souls</b>—As this term is
	here used of <i>living</i> persons, why should not "spirits"
	also? Noah preached to their ears, but Christ <i>in spirit,</i> to
	their <i>spirits,</i> or spiritual natures. 
	</p>
<p><b>saved by water</b>—The same
	water which drowned the unbelieving, buoyed up the ark in which the
	eight were saved. Not as some translate, "were brought safe
	<i>through</i> the water." However, the sense of the preposition
	may be as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:15">1 Corinthians 3:15</span>, "they
	were safely preserved through the water," though having to be <i>in
	the water.</i></p>
