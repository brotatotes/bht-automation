<p><b>6. Sara</b>—an example of <i>faith.</i>
</p>
<p><b>calling him lord</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>ye are</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"ye have become": "children" of Abraham and Sara
	by <i>faith,</i> whereas ye were Gentile aliens from the covenant. 
	</p>
<p><b>afraid with any
	amazement</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "fluttering alarm,"
	"consternation." <i>Act well, and be not thrown into sudden
	panic,</i> as weak females are apt to be, by any opposition from
	without. BENGEL
	translates, "Not afraid OF
	<i>any fluttering terror</i> coming from without" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). So the <i>Septuagint,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> uses the same <i>Greek</i> word, which Peter probably refers
	to. Anger assails men; <i>fear,</i> women. You need fear no man in
	doing what is right: not thrown into fluttering agitation by any
	sudden outbreak of temper on the part of your unbelieving husbands,
	while you <i>do well.</i></p>
