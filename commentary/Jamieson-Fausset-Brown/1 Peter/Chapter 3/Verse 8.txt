<p><b>8.</b> <i>General</i> summary of
	relative duty, after having detailed <i>particular</i> duties from
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:18">1 Peter 2:18</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>of one mind</b>—as to the
	faith. 
	</p>
<p><b>having compassion one of
	another</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "sympathizing" in the joy and
	sorrow of others. 
	</p>
<p><b>love as brethren</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"loving the brethren." 
	</p>
<p><b>pitiful</b>—towards the
	afflicted. 
	</p>
<p><b>courteous</b>—genuine
	Christian politeness; not the tinsel of the world's politeness;
	stamped with <i>unfeigned love</i> on one side, and <i>humility</i>
	on the other. But the oldest manuscripts read, "humble-minded."
	It is slightly different from "humble," in that it marks a
	<i>conscious effort</i> to be truly <i>humble.</i></p>
