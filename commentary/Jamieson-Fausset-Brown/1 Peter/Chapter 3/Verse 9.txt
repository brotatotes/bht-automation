<p><b>inherit a blessing</b>—not
	only passive, but also active; receiving spiritual blessing from God
	by faith, and in your turn blessing others from love [GERHARD
	in ALFORD]. "It is
	not in order to inherit a blessing that we must bless, but because
	our portion is blessing." No <i>railing</i> can injure you (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Imitate God who "blesses" you. The first fruits
	of His <i>blessing</i> for eternity are enjoyed by the righteous even
	now (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:10">1 Peter 3:10</span>) [BENGEL].</p>
