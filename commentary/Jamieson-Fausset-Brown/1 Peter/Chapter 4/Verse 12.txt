12. strange—they might think
	it strange that God should allow His chosen children to be sore
	tried. 
	fiery trial—like the
	fire by which metals are tested and their dross removed. The Greek
	adds, "in your case." 
	which is to try you—Greek,
	"which is taking place for a trial to you." Instead of its
	"happening to you" as some strange and untoward
	chance, it "is taking place" with the gracious
	design of trying you; God has a wise design in it—a
	consolatory reflection.
