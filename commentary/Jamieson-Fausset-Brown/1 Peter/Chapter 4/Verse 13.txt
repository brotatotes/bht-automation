<p><b>13. inasmuch as</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "in proportion as"; "in as far as"
	ye by suffering are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that is, by
	faith enter into realizing fellowship with them; willingly for His
	sake suffering as He suffered. 
	</p>
<p><b>with exceeding joy</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>exulting</i> joy"; now ye <i>rejoice</i> amidst
	sufferings; then ye shall EXULT,
	for ever free from sufferings (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:6">1 Peter 1:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:8">1 Peter 1:8</span>). If we will not bear
	suffering for Christ now, we must bear eternal sufferings hereafter.</p>
