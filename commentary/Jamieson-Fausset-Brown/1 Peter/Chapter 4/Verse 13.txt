13. inasmuch as—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "in proportion as"; "in as far as"
	ye by suffering are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that is, by
	faith enter into realizing fellowship with them; willingly for His
	sake suffering as He suffered. 
	with exceeding joy—Greek,
	"exulting joy"; now ye rejoice amidst
	sufferings; then ye shall EXULT,
	for ever free from sufferings (1 Peter 1:6;
	1 Peter 1:8). If we will not bear
	suffering for Christ now, we must bear eternal sufferings hereafter.
