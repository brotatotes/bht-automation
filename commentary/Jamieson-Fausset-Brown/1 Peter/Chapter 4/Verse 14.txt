14. for—Greek, "IN
	the name of Christ," namely, as Christians (1 Peter 4:16;
	1 Peter 3:14, above); "in My
	name, because ye belong to Christ." The emphasis lies
	on this: 1 Peter 4:15, "as a
	murderer, thief," c., stands in contrast. Let your suffering be
	on account of Christ, not on account of evil-doing (1 Peter 4:15- :). 
	reproached—Reproach
	affects noble minds more than loss of goods, or even bodily
	sufferings. 
	the spirit . . . upon you—the
	same Spirit as rested on Christ (1 Peter 4:15- :). "The Spirit of glory" is His Spirit, for
	He is the "Lord of glory" (1 Peter 4:15- :). Believers may well overcome the "reproach"
	(compare Hebrews 11:26), seeing
	that "the Spirit of glory" rests upon them, as upon
	Him. It cannot prevent the happiness of the righteous, if they are
	reproached for Christ, because they retain before God their glory
	entire, as having the Spirit, with whom glory is inseparably
	joined [CALVIN]. 
	and of God—Greek,
	"and the (Spirit) of God" implying that the
	Spirit of glory (which is Christ's Spirit) is at the same time
	also the Spirit of God.
on their part he is evil
	spoken of, but on your part he is glorified—omitted in the two
	oldest Greek manuscripts and Syriac and Coptic
	versions, but supported by one very old manuscript, Vulgate,
	Sahidic, CYPRIAN, c.
	"Evil spoken of," literally, "blasphemed" not
	merely do they "speak against you," as in Hebrews 11:26- :, but blasphemously mock Christ and Christianity
	itself.
