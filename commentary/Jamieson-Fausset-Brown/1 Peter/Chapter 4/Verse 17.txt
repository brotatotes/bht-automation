<p><b>17.</b> Another ground of
	consolation to Christians. All must pass under the judgment of God;
	God's own household first, their chastisement being here, for which
	they should glorify Him as a proof of their membership in His family,
	and a pledge of their escape from the end of those whom the last
	judgment shall find disobedient to the Gospel.

<p><b>the time</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"season," "fit time." 
	</p>
<p><b>judgment must begin at the
	house of God</b>—the Church of living believers. Peter has in mind
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+9:6">Ezekiel 9:6</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="am+3:2">Amos 3:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+25:29">Jeremiah 25:29</span>. Judgment is already
	begun, the Gospel word, as a "two-edged sword," having the
	double effect of saving some and condemning others, and shall be
	consummated at the last judgment. "When power is given to the
	destroyer, he observes no distinction between the righteous and the
	wicked; not only so, but he begins first at the righteous"
	[WETSTEIN from <i>Rabbins</i>].
	But God limits the destroyer's power over His people. 
	</p>
<p><b>if . . . at us, what shall
	the end </b><i><b>be</b></i><b> of them,</b> &amp;c.—If even the
	godly have chastening judgments now, how much more shall the ungodly
	be doomed to damnatory judgments at last. 
	</p>
<p><b>gospel of God</b>—the very
	God who is to judge them.</p>
