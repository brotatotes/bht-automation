<p><b>19.</b> General conclusion from
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:17">1 Peter 4:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:18">1 Peter 4:18</span>.
	Seeing that the godly know that their sufferings are <i>by God's
	will,</i> to chasten them that they may not perish with the world,
	they have good reason to trust God cheerfully amidst sufferings,
	persevering <i>in well-doing.</i>
</p>
<p><b>let them</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"let them <i>also,</i>" "let <i>even</i> them,"
	as well as those not suffering. Not only under ordinary
	circumstances, but <i>also</i> in time <i>of suffering, let</i>
	believers <i>commit.</i> (Compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:18- :">1 Peter 4:18- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>according to the will of
	God</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:17">1 Peter 3:17</span>).
	God's will that the believer should suffer (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:17- :">1 Peter 3:17- :</span>), is for his good. One oldest manuscript and <i>Vulgate</i>
	read, "in <i>well-doings</i>"; contrast ill-doings, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:17- :">1 Peter 3:17- :</span>. Our committing of ourselves to God is to be, not in
	indolent and passive quietism, but accompanied with active
	<i>well-doings.</i>
</p>
<p><b>faithful</b>—to His
	covenant promises. 
	</p>
<p><b>Creator</b>—who is
	therefore also our Almighty Preserver. He, not we, must <i>keep</i>
	our souls. Sin destroyed the original spiritual relation between
	creature and Creator, leaving that only of government. Faith restores
	it; so that the believer, living to <i>the will of God</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:17- :">1 Peter 3:17- :</span>), rests implicitly on his <i>Creator's</i> faithfulness.</p>
