<p><b>2. That he,</b> &amp;c.â€”"That
	he (the believer, who has once for all obtained cessation from sin by
	suffering, in the person of Christ, namely, in virtue of his union
	with the crucified Christ) should no longer live the rest of his time
	in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God" as his
	rule. "<i>Rest of his time in the flesh</i>" (the <i>Greek</i>
	has the preposition "in" here, not in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> as to Christ) proves that the reference is here not to
	Christ, but to the believer, whose remaining time for glorifying God
	is short (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:3">1 Peter 4:3</span>). "Live"
	in the truest sense, for heretofore he was <i>dead.</i> Not as
	ALFORD, "<i>Arm
	yourselves</i> . . . with a view no longer to live the rest of <i>your</i>
	time."</p>
