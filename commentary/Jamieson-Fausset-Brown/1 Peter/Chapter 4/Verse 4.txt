4. Wherein—In respect to which
	abandonment of your former walk ( :-). 
	run not with them—eagerly,
	in troops [BENGEL]. 
	excess—literally,
	"profusion"; a sink: stagnant water remaining after an
	inundation. 
	riot—profligacy. 
	speaking evil—charging
	you with pride, singularity, hypocrisy, and secret crimes (1 Peter 4:14;
	2 Peter 2:2). However, there is no
	"of you" in the Greek, but simply "blaspheming."
	It seems to me always to be used, either directly or indirectly, in
	the sense of impious reviling against God, Christ, or the Holy
	Spirit, and the Christian religion, not merely against men as
	such; Greek, 1 Peter 4:14,
	below.
