<p><b>7.</b> Resuming the idea in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>the end of all things</b>—and
	therefore also of the wantonness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:3">1 Peter 4:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:4">1 Peter 4:4</span>) of the wicked, and of
	the sufferings of the righteous [BENGEL].
	The nearness meant is not that of mere "time," but that
	<i>before the Lord;</i> as he explains to guard against
	misapprehension, and defends God from the charge of procrastination:
	We live in the last dispensation, not like the Jews under the Old
	Testament. The Lord will come as a thief; He is "ready"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:5">1 Peter 4:5</span>) to judge the world at
	any moment; it is only God's long-suffering and His will that the
	Gospel should be preached as a witness to all nations, that induces
	Him to lengthen out the time which is with Him still as nothing. 
	</p>
<p><b>sober</b>—"self-restrained."
	The opposite duties to the sins in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:5- :">1 Peter 4:5- :</span> are here inculcated. Thus "sober" is the opposite
	of "lasciviousness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:5- :">1 Peter 4:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>watch</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "be
	soberly vigilant"; not intoxicated with worldly cares and
	pleasures. Temperance promotes <i>wakefulness</i> or watchfulness,
	and both promote prayer. Drink makes drowsy, and drowsiness prevents
	prayer. 
	</p>
<p><b>prayer</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"prayers"; the end for which we should exercise vigilance.</p>
