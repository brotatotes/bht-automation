8. above all things—not that
	"charity" or love is placed above "prayer,"
	but because love is the animating spirit, without which all
	other duties are dead. Translate as Greek, "Having your
	mutual (literally, 'towards yourselves') charity intense." He
	presupposes its existence among them; he urges them to make it more
	fervent. 
	charity shall cover the
	multitude, c.—The oldest manuscripts have "covereth."
	Quoted from Proverbs 10:12 compare
	Proverbs 17:9. "Covereth"
	so as not harshly to condemn or expose faults; but forbearingly to
	bear the other's burdens, forgiving and forgetting past offenses.
	Perhaps the additional idea is included, By prayer for them,
	love tries to have them covered by God; and so being the
	instrument of converting the sinner from his error, "covereth a
	(not 'the,' as English Version) multitude of sins"; but
	the former idea from Proverbs is the prominent one. It is not,
	as Rome teaches, "covereth" his own sins; for then
	the Greek middle voice would be used; and Proverbs 10:12;
	Proverbs 17:9 support the Protestant
	view. "As God with His love covers my sins if I believe, so must
	I also cover the sins of my neighbor" [LUTHER].
	Compare the conduct of Shem and Japheth to Noah (Proverbs 17:9- :), in contrast to Ham's exposure of his father's shame. We
	ought to cover others' sins only where love itself does not require
	the contrary.
