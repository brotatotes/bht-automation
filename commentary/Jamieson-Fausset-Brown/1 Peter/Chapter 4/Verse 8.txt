<p><b>8. above all things</b>—not that
	"charity" or <i>love</i> is placed above "prayer,"
	but because <i>love</i> is the animating spirit, without which all
	other duties are dead. Translate as <i>Greek,</i> "Having your
	mutual (literally, 'towards yourselves') charity intense." He
	presupposes its existence among them; he urges them to make it more
	fervent.

<p><b>charity shall cover the
	multitude,</b> c.—The oldest manuscripts have "covereth."
	Quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:12">Proverbs 10:12</span> compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+17:9">Proverbs 17:9</span>. "Covereth"
	so as not harshly to condemn or expose faults; but forbearingly to
	bear the other's burdens, forgiving and forgetting past offenses.
	Perhaps the <i>additional</i> idea is included, By prayer for them,
	<i>love tries to have them covered by God;</i> and so being the
	instrument of converting the sinner from his error, "covereth a
	(not 'the,' as <i>English Version</i>) multitude of sins"; but
	the former idea from Proverbs is the <i>prominent</i> one. It is not,
	as Rome teaches, "covereth" <i>his own</i> sins; for then
	the <i>Greek</i> middle voice would be used; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:12">Proverbs 10:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+17:9">Proverbs 17:9</span> support the Protestant
	view. "As God with His love covers my sins if I believe, so must
	I also <i>cover the sins of my neighbor</i>" [LUTHER].
	Compare the conduct of Shem and Japheth to Noah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+17:9- :">Proverbs 17:9- :</span>), in contrast to Ham's exposure of his father's shame. We
	ought to cover others' sins only where love itself does not require
	the contrary.</p>
