<p><b>9.</b> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:13">Romans 12:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:2">Hebrews 13:2</span>.) Not the spurious
	hospitality which passes current in the world, but the entertaining
	of those <i>needing</i> it, especially those exiled for the faith, as
	the representatives of Christ, and all hospitality to whomsoever
	exercised from genuine Christian love.

<p><b>without grudging</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"murmuring." "He that giveth, let him do it with
	simplicity," that is open-hearted sincerity; with cordiality.
	Not secretly speaking against the person whom we entertain, or
	upbraiding him with the favor we have conferred in him.</p>
