9. (Romans 12:13;
	Hebrews 13:2.) Not the spurious
	hospitality which passes current in the world, but the entertaining
	of those needing it, especially those exiled for the faith, as
	the representatives of Christ, and all hospitality to whomsoever
	exercised from genuine Christian love. 
	without grudgingâ€”Greek,
	"murmuring." "He that giveth, let him do it with
	simplicity," that is open-hearted sincerity; with cordiality.
	Not secretly speaking against the person whom we entertain, or
	upbraiding him with the favor we have conferred in him.
