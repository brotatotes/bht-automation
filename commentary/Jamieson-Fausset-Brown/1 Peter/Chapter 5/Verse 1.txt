<p><b>1. elders</b>—alike in office and
	age (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:5">1 Peter 5:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>I . . . also an elder</b>—To
	put one's self on a level with those whom we exhort, gives weight to
	one's exhortations (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:1">2 John 1:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:2">2 John 1:2</span>). Peter, in true humility
	for the Gospel's sake, does not put forward his <i>apostleship</i>
	here, wherein he <i>presided over the elders.</i> In the apostleship
	the apostles have no successors, for "the signs of an apostle"
	have not been transmitted. The presidents over the presbyters and
	deacons, by whatever name designated, <i>angel, bishop,</i> or
	<i>moderator,</i> c., though <i>of the same</i> ORDER <i>as the
	presbyters,</i> yet have virtually succeeded to a superintendency of
	the Church analogous to that exercised by the apostles (this
	superintendency and priority existed from the earliest times after
	the apostles [TERTULLIAN])
	just as the Jewish synagogue (the model which the Church followed)
	was governed by a council of presbyters, presided over by one of
	themselves, "the chief ruler of the synagogue." (Compare
	VITRINGA [<i>Synagogue and
	Temple,</i> Part II, chs. 3 and 7]). 
	</p>
<p><b>witness</b>—an <i>eye-witness</i>
	of Christ's sufferings, and so qualified to exhort you to believing
	patience in <i>suffering for well-doing</i> after His example
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:19">1 Peter 4:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:20">1 Peter 2:20</span>).
	This explains the "therefore" inserted in the oldest
	manuscripts, "I therefore exhort," resuming exhortation
	from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:19">1 Peter 4:19</span>. His higher
	dignity as an <i>apostle</i> is herein delicately implied, as
	<i>eye-witnessing</i> was a necessary qualification for apostleship:
	compare Peter's own speeches, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:21">Acts 1:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:32">Acts 2:32</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:39">Acts 10:39</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>also</b>—implying the
	righteous recompense corresponding to the sufferings. 
	</p>
<p><b>partaker of the
	glory</b>—according to Christ's promise; an earnest of which was
	given in the transfiguration.</p>
