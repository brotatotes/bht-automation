	its source all grace is to be referred; who in grace completes what
	in grace He began. He from the first "called (so the oldest
	manuscripts read for "us") unto (with a view to) glory."
	He will not let His purpose fall short of completion. If He does so
	in punishing, much more in grace. The three are fitly conjoined: the
	<i>call,</i> the <i>glory</i> to which we are called, and the way
	(<i>suffering</i>); the fourth is the ground of the calling, namely,
	<i>the grace of God in Christ.</i>

	"settle," literally, "ground," or "fix on a

	reads it in spite of the oldest manuscripts The authority of the
	latter I prefer moreover the climax seems to require rather a verb of
	<i>completing</i> the work of grace, than, as the <i>Greek</i> means,
	<i>founding</i> it. The <i>Greek</i> has, "shall HIMSELF
	perfect you": though you are called on to <i>watch</i> and
	<i>resist</i> the foe, God <i>Himself</i> must really do all in and
	through you. The same God who begins must <i>Himself</i> complete the
	work. The <i>Greek</i> for "stablish" (so as to be
	"steadfast in the faith," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33- :">John 16:33- :</span>) is the same as "strengthen," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33- :">John 16:33- :</span>. Peter has in mind Christ's charge, "When thou art
	converted, <i>strengthen</i> thy brethren." His exhortation
	accords with his name <i>Peter,</i> "Thou art <i>Peter,</i> and
	upon this <i>rock</i> I will build My Church." "Stablish,"
	so as not to waver. "Strengthen" <i>with might in the inner
	man by His Spirit,</i> against the foe.</p>
