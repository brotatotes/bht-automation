<p><b>2. Feed</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "Tend
	as a shepherd," by discipline and doctrine. Lead, feed, heed: by
	prayer, exhortation, government, and example. The dignity is marked
	by the term "<i>elder</i>"; the <i>duties</i> of the
	office, to <i>tend</i> or <i>oversee,</i> by "<i>bishop.</i>"
	Peter has in mind Christ's injunction to him, "Feed (<i>tend</i>)
	My sheep . . . Feed (<i>pasture</i>) My lambs" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). He invites the elders to share with him the same duty
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>). The flock
	is Christ's. 
	</p>
<p><b>which is among you</b>—While
	having a concern for <i>all</i> the Church, your special duty is to
	feed that portion of it "which is among you." 
	</p>
<p><b>oversight</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"bishopric," or duty of bishops, that is, overseer. 
	</p>
<p><b>not by constraint</b>—Necessity
	is laid upon them, but willingness prevents it being felt, both in
	undertaking and in fulfilling the duty [BENGEL].
	"He is a true presbyter and minister of the counsel of God who
	doeth and teacheth the things of the Lord, being not accounted
	righteous merely because he is a presbyter, but because righteous,
	chosen into the presbytery" [CLEMENT
	OF ALEXANDRIA]. 
	</p>
<p><b>willingly</b>—One oldest
	manuscript, <i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> and <i>Coptic,</i> add, "as
	God would have it to be done" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28- :">Acts 20:28- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>not for filthy lucre</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:11">Isaiah 56:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:7">Titus 1:7</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>of a ready mind</b>—promptly
	and heartily, without selfish motive of gain-seeking, as the
	Israelites gave their services <i>willing-heartedly</i> to the
	sanctuary.</p>
