3. being lords—Greek,
	"lording it": implying pride and oppression. "Not that
	we have dominion over your faith." 
	God's
	heritage—Greek, "the inheritances," that is,
	the portions of the Church committed severally to your
	pastoral charge [BENGEL].
	It is explained by "the flock" in the next clause. However,
	in 1 Peter 5:2, "flock of
	God which is among you," answering to "(God's)
	heritages" (plural to express the sheep who are God's
	portion and inheritance, Deuteronomy 32:9)
	committed to you, favors English Version. The flock, as one
	whole, is God's heritage, or flock in the singular.
	Regarded in relation to its component sheep, divided among
	several pastors, it is in the plural "heritages." Compare
	Acts 1:17; Acts 1:25,
	"part" (the same Greek). BERNARD
	OF CLAIRVAUX, wrote
	to Pope Eugene, "Peter could not give thee what he had not: what
	he had he gave: the care over the Church, not dominion."
	being—Greek,
	"becoming." 
	ensamples—the most
	effective recommendation of precept (Acts 1:25- :). Titus 2:7, "patterns."
	So Jesus. "A monstrosity it is to see the highest rank joined
	with the meanest mind, the first seat with the lowest life, a
	grandiloquent tongue with a lazy life, much talking with no fruit"
