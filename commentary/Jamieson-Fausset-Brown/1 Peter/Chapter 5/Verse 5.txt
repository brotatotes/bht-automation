<p><b>5. ye younger</b>—The <i>deacons</i>
	were originally the younger men, the <i>presbyters</i> older; but
	subsequently as presbyter expressed the <i>office</i> of Church ruler
	or teacher, so <i>Greek</i> "<i>neoteros</i>" means not (as
	literally) <i>young men</i> in age, but <i>subordinate ministers</i>
	and servants of the Church. So Christ uses the term "younger."
	For He explains it by "he that doth serve," literally, "he
	that ministereth as a deacon"; just as He explains "the
	greatness" by "he that is chief," literally, "he
	that <i>ruleth,</i>" the very word applied to the <i>bishops</i>
	or <i>presbyters.</i> So "the young men" are undoubtedly
	the deacons of the Church of Jerusalem, of whom, as being all
	<i>Hebrews,</i> the Hellenistic Christians subsequently complained as
	neglecting their <i>Grecian</i> widows, whence arose the appointment
	of the seven others, <i>Hellenistic</i> deacons. So here, Peter,
	having exhorted the <i>presbyters,</i> or elders, not to lord it over
	those committed to them, adds, Likewise ye <i>neoters</i> or younger,
	that is, subordinate ministers and deacons, submit cheerfully to the
	command of the elders [MOSHEIM].
	There is no Scripture sanction for "younger" meaning <i>laymen</i>
	in general (as ALFORD
	explains): its use in this sense is probably of later date. The "<i>all</i>
	of you" that follows, refers to the <i>congregation</i>
	generally; and it is likely that, like Paul, Peter should notice,
	previous to the general congregation, the <i>subordinate ministers</i>
	as well as the <i>presbyters,</i> writing as he did to the same
	region (Ephesus), and to confirm the teaching of the apostle of the
	Gentiles.

<p><b>Yea</b>—to sum up all my
	exhortations in one.

<p><b>be subject</b>—omitted in
	the oldest manuscripts and versions, but TISCHENDORF
	quotes the <i>Vatican</i> manuscript for it. Then translate, "Gird
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:13">1 Peter 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:1">1 Peter 4:1</span>)
	fast on humility (lowliness of mind) to one another." The verb
	is literally, "tie on with a fast <i>knot</i>" [WAHL].
	Or, "<i>gird on</i> humility as <i>the slave dress</i>
	(<i>encomboma</i>)": as the Lord girded Himself with a towel to
	perform a servile office of humility and love, washing His disciples'
	feet, a scene in which Peter had played an important part, so that he
	would naturally have it before his mind. Compare similarly <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:2">1 Peter 5:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15-17">John 21:15-17</span>. Clothing was
	the original badge of man's sin and shame. Pride caused the need of
	man's clothing, and pride still reigns in dress; the Christian
	therefore clothes himself in humility (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:3">1 Peter 3:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:4">1 Peter 3:4</span>). God provides him with
	the robe of Christ's righteousness, in order to receive which man
	must be stripped of pride.

<p><b>God resisteth the
	proud</b>—Quoted, as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:6">James 4:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:34">Proverbs 3:34</span>. Peter had James before
	his mind, and gives his Epistle inspired sanction. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:9">1 Peter 5:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:7">James 4:7</span>, literally, "arrayeth
	Himself against." Other sins flee from God: pride alone opposeth
	itself to God; therefore, God also in turn <i>opposes Himself</i> to
	the proud [GERHARD in
	ALFORD]. Humility is the
	vessel of all graces [AUGUSTINE].</p>
