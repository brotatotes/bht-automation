7. Casting—once for all:
	so the Greek aorist. 
	care—"anxiety? The
	advantage flowing from humbling ourselves under God's hand
	(1 Peter 5:6) is confident reliance
	on His goodness. Exemption from care goes along with humble
	submission to God. 
	careth for you—literally
	"respecting you." Care is a burden which faith casts
	off the man on his God. Compare Psalms 22:10;
	Psalms 37:5; Psalms 55:22,
	to which Peter alludes; Luke 12:22;
	Luke 12:37; Philippians 4:6.
	careth—not so strong a
	Greek word as the previous Greek "anxiety."
