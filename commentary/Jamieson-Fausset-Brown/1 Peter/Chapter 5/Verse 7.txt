<p><b>7. Casting</b>—<i>once for all:</i>
	so the <i>Greek</i> aorist.

<p><b>care</b>—"anxiety? The
	advantage flowing from <i>humbling ourselves under God's hand</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:6">1 Peter 5:6</span>) is confident reliance
	on His goodness. Exemption from care goes along with humble
	submission to God. 
	</p>
<p><b>careth for you</b>—literally
	"<i>respecting</i> you." Care is a burden which faith casts
	off the man on his God. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:10">Psalms 22:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:5">Psalms 37:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:22">Psalms 55:22</span>,
	to which Peter alludes; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:22">Luke 12:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:37">Luke 12:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:6">Philippians 4:6</span>.

<p><b>careth</b>—not so strong a
	<i>Greek</i> word as the previous <i>Greek</i> "anxiety."</p>
