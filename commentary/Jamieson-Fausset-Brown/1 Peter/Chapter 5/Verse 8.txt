<p><b>8.</b> Peter has in mind Christ's
	warning to himself to <i>watch</i> against <i>Satan,</i> from
	forgetting which he fell. 
	</p>
<p><b>Be sober . . .
	vigilant</b>—"Care," that is, <i>anxiety,</i> will
	intoxicate the soul; therefore be sober, that is, self-restrained.
	Yet, lest this freedom from <i>care</i> should lead any to false
	security, he adds, "Be vigilant" against "your
	adversary." Let this be your "care." God provides,
	therefore do not be anxious. The devil seeks, therefore watch
	[BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>because</b>—omitted in the
	oldest manuscripts The broken and disjointed sentences are more
	fervid and forcible. LUCIFER OF
	CAGLIARI reads as <i>English
	Version.</i>
</p>
<p><b>adversary</b>—literally,
	"opponent in a court of justice" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "Satan" means <i>opponent.</i> "Devil,"
	<i>accuser</i> or <i>slanderer</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "The enemy" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "A murderer from the beginning" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). He counteracts the Gospel and its agents. "The
	tempter." 
	</p>
<p><b>roaring lion</b>—implying
	his violent and insatiable thirst for prey as a hungry lion. Through
	man's sin he got God's justice on his side against us; but Christ,
	our Advocate, by fulfilling all the demands of justice for us, has
	made our redemption altogether consistent with justice. 
	</p>
<p><b>walketh about</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:7">Job 1:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+2:2">Job 2:2</span>). So the children of the
	wicked one <i>cannot rest.</i> Evil spirits are in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:6">Judges 1:6</span>, said to be already in
	chains of darkness and in hell. This probably means that this is
	their doom <i>finally:</i> a doom already begun in part; though for a
	time they are permitted to roam in the world (of which Satan is
	prince), especially in the dark air that surrounds the earth. Hence
	perhaps arises the miasma of the air at times, as physical and moral
	evil are closely connected. 
	</p>
<p><b>devour</b>—entangle in
	worldly "care" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:7">1 Peter 5:7</span>)
	and other snares, so as finally to destroy. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:15">Revelation 12:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:16">Revelation 12:16</span>.</p>
