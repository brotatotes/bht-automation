8. Peter has in mind Christ's
	warning to himself to watch against Satan, from
	forgetting which he fell. 
	Be sober . . .
	vigilant—"Care," that is, anxiety, will
	intoxicate the soul; therefore be sober, that is, self-restrained.
	Yet, lest this freedom from care should lead any to false
	security, he adds, "Be vigilant" against "your
	adversary." Let this be your "care." God provides,
	therefore do not be anxious. The devil seeks, therefore watch

	Judges 1:6, said to be already in
	chains of darkness and in hell. This probably means that this is
	their doom finally: a doom already begun in part; though for a
	time they are permitted to roam in the world (of which Satan is
	prince), especially in the dark air that surrounds the earth. Hence
	perhaps arises the miasma of the air at times, as physical and moral
	evil are closely connected.
