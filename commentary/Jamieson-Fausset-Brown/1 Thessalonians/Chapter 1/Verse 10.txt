<p><b>10.</b> This verse distinguishes
	them from the <i>Jews,</i> as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> from the <i>idolatrous</i> Gentiles. To wait for the Lord's
	coming is a sure characteristic of a true believer, and was prominent
	amidst the graces of the Thessalonians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8">1 Corinthians 1:8</span>). His <i>coming</i> is
	seldom called his <i>return</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8- :">1 Corinthians 1:8- :</span>); because the two advents are regarded as different phases
	of the same coming; and the second coming shall have features
	altogether new connected with it, so that it will not be a mere
	repetition of the first, or a mere coming <i>back again.</i>
</p>
<p><b>his Son . . . raised from the
	dead</b>—the grand proof of His divine <i>Sonship</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:8- :">1 Corinthians 1:8- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>delivered</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "who <i>delivereth us</i>." Christ has once
	for all <i>redeemed</i> us; He is <i>our Deliverer</i> ALWAYS.
