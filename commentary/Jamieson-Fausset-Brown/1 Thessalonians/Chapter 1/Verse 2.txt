2. (Romans 1:9;
	2 Timothy 1:3.) The structure of the
	sentences in this and the following verses, each successive sentence
	repeating with greater fulness the preceding, characteristically
	marks Paul's abounding love and thankfulness in respect to his
	converts, as if he were seeking by words heaped on words to convey
	some idea of his exuberant feelings towards them. 
	Weâ€”I, Silvanus, and
	Timotheus. Romans 1:9 supports
	ALFORD in translating,
	"making mention of you in our prayers without ceasing" (Romans 1:9- :). Thus, "without ceasing," in the second clause,
	answers in parallelism to "always," in the first.
