3. work of faith—the
	working reality of your faith; its alacrity in receiving
	the truth, and in evincing itself by its fruits. Not an otiose
	assent; but a realizing, working faith; not "in word
	only," but in one continuous chain of "work"
	(singular, not plural, works), 1 Thessalonians 1:5-10;
	James 2:22. So "the work of
	faith" in 2 Thessalonians 1:11 implies
	its perfect development (compare 2 Thessalonians 1:11- :). The other governing substantives similarly mark
	respectively the characteristic manifestation of the grace which
	follows each in the genitive. Faith, love, and hope,
	are the three great Christian graces (1 Thessalonians 5:8;
	1 Corinthians 13:13). 
	labour of love—The
	Greek implies toil, or troublesome labor, which
	we are stimulated by love to bear (1 Thessalonians 2:9;
	Revelation 2:2). For instances of
	self-denying labors of love, see Acts 20:35;
	Romans 16:12. Not here ministerial
	labors. Those who shun trouble for others, love little (compare Romans 16:12- :). 
	patience—Translate,
	"endurance of hope"; the persevering endurance
	of trials which flows from "hope." Romans 16:12- : shows that "patience" also nourishes "hope."
	hope in our Lord
	Jesus—literally, "hope of our Lord Jesus,"
	namely, of His coming (1 Thessalonians 1:10):
	a hope that looked forward beyond all present things for the
	manifestation of Christ. 
	in the sight of God and our
	Father—Your "faith, hope, and love" were not merely
	such as would pass for genuine before men, but "in the
	sight of God," the Searcher of hearts [GOMARUS].
	Things are really what they are before God. BENGEL
	takes this clause with "remembering." Whenever we pray,
	we remember before God your faith, hope, and love. But its
	separation from "remembering" in the order, and its
	connection with "your . . . faith," &c., make me to
	prefer the former view. 
	and, &c.—The Greek
	implies, "in the sight of Him who is [at once] God and
	our Father."
