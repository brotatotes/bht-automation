<p><b>3. work of faith</b>—<i>the
	working reality of your faith;</i> its alacrity in <i>receiving</i>
	the truth, and in <i>evincing</i> itself by its fruits. Not an otiose
	assent; but a <i>realizing, working faith;</i> not "in word
	only," but in <i>one</i> continuous chain of "work"
	(singular, not plural, <i>works</i>), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:5-10">1 Thessalonians 1:5-10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:22">James 2:22</span>. So "the work of
	faith" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:11">2 Thessalonians 1:11</span> implies
	its <i>perfect development</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:11- :">2 Thessalonians 1:11- :</span>). The other governing substantives similarly mark
	respectively the characteristic manifestation of the grace which
	follows each in the genitive. <i>Faith, love,</i> and <i>hope,</i>
	are the three great Christian graces (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:13">1 Corinthians 13:13</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>labour of love</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> implies <i>toil,</i> or <i>troublesome labor,</i> which
	we are stimulated by love to bear (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:2">Revelation 2:2</span>). For instances of
	self-denying <i>labors of love,</i> see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:12">Romans 16:12</span>. Not here <i>ministerial</i>
	labors. Those who shun trouble for others, love little (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:12- :">Romans 16:12- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>patience</b>—Translate,
	"<i>endurance</i> of hope"; the <i>persevering endurance</i>
	of trials which flows from "hope." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:12- :">Romans 16:12- :</span> shows that "patience" also nourishes "hope."
	</p>
<p><b>hope in our Lord
	Jesus</b>—literally, "hope <i>of</i> our Lord Jesus,"
	namely, of His coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</span>):
	a hope that looked forward beyond all present things for the
	manifestation of Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the sight of God and our
	Father</b>—Your "faith, hope, and love" were not merely
	such as would pass for genuine <i>before men,</i> but "in the
	sight of God," the Searcher of hearts [GOMARUS].
	Things are really what they are before God. BENGEL
	takes this clause with "remembering." Whenever we <i>pray,</i>
	we <i>remember before God</i> your faith, hope, and love. But its
	separation from "remembering" in the order, and its
	connection with "your . . . faith," &amp;c., make me to
	prefer the former view. 
	</p>
<p><b>and,</b> &amp;c.—The <i>Greek</i>
	implies, "in the sight of <i>Him who</i> is [at once] God and
	our Father."</p>
