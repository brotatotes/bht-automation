<p><b>5. our gospel</b>—namely, the
	Gospel which we preached. 
	</p>
<p><b>came</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "was
	made," namely, by God, its Author and Sender. God's having made
	our preaching among you to be attended with such "power,"
	is the proof that you are "elect of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in power</b>—in the
	efficacy of the Holy Spirit clothing us with power (see end of verse;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:33">Acts 4:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:5">Acts 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:8">Acts 6:8</span>)
	in preaching the Gospel, and making it in you the power of God unto
	salvation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16">Romans 1:16</span>). As "power"
	produces <i>faith;</i> so "the Holy Ghost," <i>love;</i>
	and "much assurance" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16- :">Romans 1:16- :</span>, <i>full persuasion</i>), <i>hope</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16- :">Romans 1:16- :</span>), resting on faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16- :">Romans 1:16- :</span>). So <i>faith, love,</i> and <i>hope</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:16- :">Romans 1:16- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>as ye know</b>—answering to
	the "knowing," that is, <i>as</i> WE
	<i>know</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:4">1 Thessalonians 1:4</span>) your
	character as <i>the elect of God,</i> so YE
	<i>know</i> ours as <i>preachers.</i>
</p>
<p><b>for your sake</b>—The
	purpose herein indicated is not so much that of the apostles, as that
	of God. "You know what <i>God enabled us to be . . . how mighty
	in preaching the word</i> . . . for your sakes . . . thereby proving
	that He had <i>chosen</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:4">1 Thessalonians 1:4</span>)
	you for His own" [ALFORD].
	I think, from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:10-12">1 Thessalonians 2:10-12</span>,
	that, in "what manner of men we were among you," besides
	the <i>power in preaching,</i> there is included also Paul's and his
	fellow missionaries' whole <i>conduct</i> which confirmed their
	preaching; and in this sense, the "for your sake" will mean
	"in order to win you." This, though not the sole, yet would
	be a strong, motive to holy circumspection, namely, so as to win
	those without (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>; compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:19-23">1 Corinthians 9:19-23</span>).</p>
