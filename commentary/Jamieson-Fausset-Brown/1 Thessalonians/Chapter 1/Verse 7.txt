<p><b>7. ensamples</b>â€”So some of the
	oldest manuscripts read. Others, "ensample" (singular), the
	whole Church being regarded as <i>one.</i> The <i>Macedonian</i>
	Church of Philippi was the only one in Europe converted before the
	Thessalonians. Therefore he means their past conduct is an ensample
	to all believers now; of whom he specifies those "in Macedonia"
	because he had been there since the conversion of the Thessalonians,
	and had left Silvanus and Timotheus there; and those in "Achaia,"
	because he was now at Corinth in Achaia.</p>
