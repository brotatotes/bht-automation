	outward conduct. 
	God—as to our inner
	motives.

	unblamably—in relation
	to ourselves. 
	behaved ourselves—Greek,
	"were made to be," namely, by God. 
	among you that
	believe—rather, "before (that is, in the eyes of)
	you that believe"; whatever we may have seemed in the eyes of
	the unbelieving. As 1 Thessalonians 2:9
	refers to their outward occupation in the world; so 1 Thessalonians 2:9- :, to their character among believers.
