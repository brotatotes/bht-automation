<p><b>11. exhorted and
	comforted</b>—<i>Exhortation</i> leads one to do a thing willingly;
	<i>consolation,</i> to do it joyfully [BENGEL],
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14">1 Thessalonians 5:14</span>). Even in the former
	term, "exhorted," the <i>Greek</i> includes the additional
	idea of <i>comforting</i> and <i>advocating</i> one's cause:
	"encouragingly exhorted." Appropriate in this case, as the
	Thessalonians were in sorrow, both through persecutions, and also
	through deaths of friends (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:14- :">1 Thessalonians 5:14- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>charged</b>—"conjured
	solemnly," literally, "testifying"; <i>appealing
	solemnly</i> to you before God. 
	</p>
<p><b>every one of you</b>—in
	private (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:20">Acts 20:20</span>), as well as
	publicly. The minister, if he would be useful, must not deal merely
	in generalities, but must individualize and particularize. 
	</p>
<p><b>as a father</b>—with mild
	gravity. The <i>Greek</i> is, "<i>his own</i> children."</p>
