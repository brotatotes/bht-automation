<p><b>13. For this cause</b>—Seeing ye
	have had such teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) [BENGEL], "we
	also (as well as 'all that believe' in Macedonia and Achaia) thank
	God without ceasing ('always' . . . 'in our prayers,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), that when ye received the word of God which ye heard from
	us (literally, 'God's word of hearing from us,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:16">Romans 10:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:17">Romans 10:17</span>), ye accepted it not as
	the word of men, but, even as it is truly, the word of God."
	ALFORD omits the "as"
	of <i>English Version.</i> But the "as" is required by the
	clause, "even as it is truly." "Ye accepted it, not
	(<i>as</i>) the word of men (which it might have been <i>supposed</i>
	to be), but (as) the word of God, <i>even as it really is.</i>"
	The <i>Greek</i> for the first "received," implies simply
	the hearing of it; the <i>Greek</i> of the second is "accepted,"
	or "welcomed" it. The proper object of faith, it hence
	appears, is <i>the word of God,</i> at first oral, then for security
	against error, written (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30">John 20:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:31">John 20:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:4">Romans 15:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:30">Galatians 4:30</span>). Also, that faith is
	<i>the work of divine grace,</i> is implied by Paul's <i>thanksgiving.</i>

<p><b>effectually worketh also in
	you that believe</b>—"Also," besides your accepting it
	with your hearts, it evidences itself in your lives. It shows its
	<i>energy</i> in its practical effects on you; for instance, working
	in you patient endurance in trial (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:30- :">Galatians 4:30- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span>;
