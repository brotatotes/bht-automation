<p><b>14. followers</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"imitators." Divine <i>working</i> is most of all seen and
	felt in affliction. 
	</p>
<p><b>in Judea</b>—The churches
	of Judea were naturally the patterns to other churches, as having
	been the first founded, and that on the very scene of Christ's own
	ministry. Reference to them is specially appropriate here, as the
	Thessalonians, with Paul and Silas, had experienced from Jews in
	their city persecutions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) similar to those which "the churches in Judea"
	experienced from Jews in that country. 
	</p>
<p><b>in Christ Jesus</b>—not
	merely "in God"; for the synagogues of the Jews (one of
	which the Thessalonians were familiar with, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) were also <i>in God.</i> But the Christian churches alone
	were not only <i>in God,</i> as the Jews in contrast to the
	Thessalonian idolaters were, but also <i>in Christ,</i> which the
	Jews were not. 
	</p>
<p><b>of your own
	countrymen</b>—including primarily the Jews settled at
	Thessalonica, from whom the persecution originated, and also the
	Gentiles there, instigated by the Jews; thus, "fellow
	countrymen" (the <i>Greek</i> term, according to Herodian,
	implies, not the <i>enduring</i> relation of fellow citizenship, but
	sameness of country <i>for the time being</i>), including naturalized
	Jews and native Thessalonians, stand in contrast to the pure "Jews"
	in Judea (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:36">Matthew 10:36</span>). It is an
	undesigned coincidence, that Paul at this time was suffering
	persecutions of the Jews at Corinth, whence he writes (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:5">Acts 18:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:6">Acts 18:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12">Acts 18:12</span>);
	naturally his letter would the more vividly dwell on Jewish
	bitterness against Christians. 
	</p>
<p><b>even as they</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:12- :">Acts 18:12- :</span>). There was a <i>likeness</i> in respect to <i>the
	nation</i> from which both suffered, namely, Jews, and those <i>their
	own countrymen;</i> in the <i>cause</i> for which, and in the <i>evils</i>
	which, they suffered, and also in the steadfast <i>manner</i> in
	which they suffered them. Such sameness of fruits, afflictions, and
	experimental characteristics of believers, in all places and at all
	times, is a subsidiary evidence of the truth of the Gospel.</p>
