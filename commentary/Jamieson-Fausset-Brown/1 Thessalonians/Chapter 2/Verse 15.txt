	universal voice of the world, which even they themselves cannot
	contradict, they are declared to be perversely "contrary to all
	men." JOSEPHUS
	[<i>Against Apion,</i> 2.14], represents one calling them "Atheists
	and Misanthropes, the dullest of barbarians"; and TACITUS
	[<i>Histories,</i> 5.5], "They have a hostile hatred of all
	other men." However, the <i>contrariety to all men</i> here
	meant is, <i>in that they</i> "forbid us to speak to the
	Gentiles that they may be saved" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:49- :">Luke 11:49- :</span>).</p>
