<p><b>17. But we</b>—resumed from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; in contrast to <i>the Jews,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:15">1 Thessalonians 2:15</span>;

	"severed (violently, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:16- :">1 Thessalonians 2:16- :</span>) from you," as parents bereft of their children. So
	"I will not leave you comfortless," <i>Greek,</i>
	"orphanized" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:16- :">1 Thessalonians 2:16- :</span>).

<p><b>for a short time</b>—literally,
	"for the space of an hour." "When we had been severed
	from you but a very short time (perhaps alluding to the suddenness of
	his unexpected departure), we the more abundantly (the shorter was
	our separation; for the desire of meeting again is the more vivid,
	the more recent has been the parting) endeavored," c. (Compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:4">2 Timothy 1:4</span>). He does not hereby, as
	many explain, anticipate a short separation from them, which would be
	a false anticipation for he did not soon revisit them. The <i>Greek</i>
	past participle also forbids their view.</p>
