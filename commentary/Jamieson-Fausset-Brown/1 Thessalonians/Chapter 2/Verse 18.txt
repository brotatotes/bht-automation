<p><b>18. Wherefore</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "Because," or "Inasmuch as." 
	</p>
<p><b>we would</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>we wished</i> to come"; we intended to come. 
	</p>
<p><b>even I Paul</b>—My fellow
	missionaries as well as myself wished to come; I can answer for
	<i>myself</i> that I intended it more than once. His slightly
	distinguishing himself here from his fellow missionaries, whom
	throughout this Epistle he associates with himself in the plural,
	accords with the fact that Silvanus and Timothy stayed at Berea when
	Paul went on to Athens; where subsequently Timothy joined him, and
	was thence sent <i>by Paul alone</i> to Thessalonica (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Satan hindered us</b>—On a
	different occasion "the Holy Ghost, the Spirit <i>of Jesus</i>"
	(so the oldest manuscripts read), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:7">Acts 16:7</span>, forbad or hindered them
	in a missionary design; here it is <i>Satan,</i> acting perhaps by
	wicked men, some of whom had already driven him out of Thessalonica
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:13">Acts 17:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:27">John 13:27</span>), or else by
	some more direct "messenger of Satan—a thorn in the flesh"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7- :">2 Corinthians 12:7- :</span>). In any event, the Holy Ghost and the providence of God
	overruled Satan's opposition to further His own purpose. <i>We</i>
	cannot, in each case, define whence hindrances in good undertakings
	arise; <i>Paul</i> in this case, by inspiration, was enabled to say;
	the hindrance was from Satan. GROTIUS
	thinks Satan's mode of hindering Paul's journey to Thessalonica was
	by instigating the Stoic and Epicurean philosophers to cavil, which
	entailed on Paul the necessity of replying, and so detained him; but
	he seems to have left Athens leisurely (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:33">Acts 17:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:34">Acts 17:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1">Acts 18:1</span>).
	The <i>Greek</i> for "hindered" is literally, "to cut
	a trench between one's self and an advancing foe, to prevent his
	progress"; so Satan opposing the progress of the missionaries.</p>
