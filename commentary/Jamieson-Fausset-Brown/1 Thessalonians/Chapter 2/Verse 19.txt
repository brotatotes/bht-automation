<p><b>Are not even ye in the

	or "also," implies that not <i>they alone</i> will be his
	crown) our hope, joy, and crown of rejoicing before Jesus, when He
	shall come (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:14">2 Corinthians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:16">Philippians 2:16</span>;

	here meant is his hope (in a lower sense), that these his converts
	might be found in Christ at His advent (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:1- :">Philippians 4:1- :</span>). Paul's <i>chief</i> "hope" was JESUS
