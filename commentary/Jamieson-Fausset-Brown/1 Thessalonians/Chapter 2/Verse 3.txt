	"boldness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>),
	his freedom from all "deceit, uncleanness, and guile";
	<i>guile,</i> before God, <i>deceit</i> (<i>Greek,</i> "imposture"),
	towards men (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>;

	<i>uncleanness,</i> in relation to one's self (impure motives of
	carnal self-gratification in gain, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14- :">Ephesians 4:14- :</span>), or lust; such as actuated false teachers of the Gentiles
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:16">Philippians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span>;

<p><b>exhortation</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	means "consolation" as well as "exhortation." The
	same Gospel which exhorts comforts. Its first lesson to each is that
	of peace in believing amidst outward and inward sorrows. It comforts
	them that mourn (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:11">1 Thessalonians 2:11</span>;
