<p><b>6.</b> Literally, "Nor of men
	(have we been found, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:5">1 Thessalonians 2:5</span>)
	seeking glory." The "of" here represents a different
	<i>Greek</i> word from "of" in the clause "<i>of</i>
	you . . . <i>of</i> others." ALFORD
	makes the former (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>ex</i>") express the
	<i>abstract ground</i> of the glory; the latter (<i>apo</i>) the
	<i>concrete object</i> from which it was to come. The former means
	"originating from"; the latter means "on the part of."
	Many teach heretical novelties, though not for fain, yet for "glory."
	Paul and his associates were free even from this motive [GROTIUS],
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:44">John 5:44</span>).

<p><b>we might have been
	burdensome</b>—that is, by claiming maintenance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:9">2 Corinthians 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:16">2 Corinthians 12:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</span>). As, however, "glory"
	precedes, as well as "covetousness," the reference cannot
	be <i>restricted</i> to the latter, though I think it is not
	<i>excluded.</i> Translate, "when we might have borne heavily
	upon you," by pressing you <i>with the weight of self-glorifying
	authority,</i> and <i>with the burden</i> of our <i>sustenance.</i>
	Thus the antithesis is appropriate in the words following, "But
	we were <i>gentle</i> (the opposite of <i>pressing weightily</i>)
	among you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:7">1 Thessalonians 2:7</span>). On
	<i>weight</i> being connected with authority, compare <i>Note,</i>
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:7- :">1 Thessalonians 2:7- :</span>, "His letters
	are weighty" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span>).
	ALFORD'S translation,
	which <i>excludes</i> reference to his right of claiming <i>maintenance</i>
	("when we might have stood on our <i>dignity</i>"), seems
	to me disproved by <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>,
	which uses <i>the same Greek word</i> unequivocally for "chargeable."
