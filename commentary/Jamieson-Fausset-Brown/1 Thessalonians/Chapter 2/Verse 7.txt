<p><b>7. we were</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "we

<p><b>gentle</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>mild</i> in bearing with the faults of others"
	[TITTMANN]; one, too, who
	is gentle (though firm) in reproving the erroneous opinions of others
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:24">2 Timothy 2:24</span>). Some of the oldest
	manuscripts read, "we became <i>little children</i>"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:3">Matthew 18:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:4">Matthew 18:4</span>).
	Others support the <i>English Version</i> reading, which forms a
	better antithesis to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:7">1 Thessalonians 2:7</span>, and harmonizes better
	with what follows; for he would hardly, in the same sentence, compare
	himself both to the "infants" or "little children,"
	and to "a nurse," or rather, "suckling mother."
	<i>Gentleness</i> is the fitting characteristic of <i>a nurse.</i>
