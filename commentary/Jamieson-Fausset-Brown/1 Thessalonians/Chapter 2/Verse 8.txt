8. So—to be joined to "we
	were willing"; "As a nurse cherisheth . . . so
	we were willing," c. [ALFORD].
	But BENGEL, "So,"
	that is, seeing that we have such affection for you.
being affectionately
	desirous—The oldest reading in the Greek implies,
	literally, to connect one's self with another to be closely
	attached to another. 
	willing—The Greek
	is stronger, "we were well content"; "we would
	gladly have imparted," c. "even our own lives"
	(so the Greek for "souls" ought to be translated) as
	we showed in the sufferings we endured in giving you the Gospel ( :-). As a nursing mother is ready to impart not only her
	milk to them, but her life for them, so we not only imparted gladly
	the spiritual milk of the word to you, but risked our own lives for
	your spiritual nourishment, imitating Him who laid down His life for
	His friends, the greatest proof of love ( :-). 
	ye were—Greek,
	"ye were become," as having become our spiritual children. 
	dear—Greek,
	"dearly beloved."
