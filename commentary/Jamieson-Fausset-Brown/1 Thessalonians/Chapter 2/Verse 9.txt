<p><b>9. labour and travail</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> for "labor" means <i>hardship in bearing;</i>
	that for "travail," <i>hardship in doing;</i> the former,
	toil with the utmost solicitude; the latter, the being wearied with
	fatigue [GROTIUS].
	ZANCHIUS refers the former
	to <i>spiritual</i> (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5">1 Thessalonians 3:5</span>),
	the latter to <i>manual</i> labor. I would translate, "weariness
	(so the <i>Greek</i> is translated, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5- :">1 Thessalonians 3:5- :</span>) and travail" (hard labor, <i>toil</i>). 
	</p>
<p><b>for</b>—omitted in the
	oldest manuscripts. 
	</p>
<p><b>labouring</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"working," namely, at tent-making (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5- :">1 Thessalonians 3:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>night and day</b>—The Jews
	reckoned the day from sunset to sunset, so that "night" is
	put before "day" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5- :">1 Thessalonians 3:5- :</span>). Their labors with their hands for a scanty livelihood had
	to be engaged in not only by day, but by night also, in the intervals
	between spiritual labors. 
	</p>
<p><b>because we would not be
	chargeable</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "<i>with a view to</i> not
	<i>burdening</i> any of you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:9">2 Corinthians 11:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:10">2 Corinthians 11:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>preached unto you</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"unto and among you." Though but "three Sabbaths"
	are mentioned, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:2">Acts 17:2</span>, these
	refer merely to the time of his preaching <i>to the Jews in the
	synagogue.</i> When rejected by them as a body, after having
	converted a few Jews, he turned to the Gentiles; of these (whom he
	preached to in a place distinct from the synagogue) "a great
	multitude believed" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:4">Acts 17:4</span>,
	where the oldest manuscripts read, "of the devout [proselytes]
	and Greeks a great multitude"); then after he had, by labors
	continued <i>among the Gentiles</i> for some time, gathered in many
	converts, the Jews, provoked by his success, assaulted Jason's house,
	and drove him away. His receiving "once and again" supplies
	from Philippi, implies a longer stay at Thessalonica than three weeks
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:16">Philippians 4:16</span>).</p>
