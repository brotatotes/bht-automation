	my <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> This implies that
	he sent Timothy <i>from Athens,</i> whither the latter had followed
	him. However, the "we" favors ALFORD'S
	view that the determination to send Timothy was formed during the
	hasty consultation of Paul, Silas, and Timothy, <i>previous to his
	departure from Berea,</i> and that then he with them "resolved"
	to be "left alone" at Athens, when he should arrive there:
	Timothy and Silas not accompanying him, but remaining at Berea. Thus
	the "I," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:5">1 Thessalonians 3:5</span>, will
	express that the <i>act</i> of sending Timothy, when he arrived at
	Athens, was <i>Paul's,</i> while the determination that Paul should
	be left alone at Athens, was that of the brethren as well as himself,
	at Berea, whence he uses, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:1">1 Thessalonians 3:1</span>,
	"we." The non-mention of Silas at Athens implies that he
	did not follow Paul to Athens as was at first intended; but Timothy
	did. Thus the history, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:15">Acts 17:15</span>, accords with the
	Epistle. The word "left behind" (<i>Greek</i>) implies that
	Timothy had been with him <i>at Athens.</i> It was an act of
	self-denial for their sakes that Paul deprived himself of the
	presence of Timothy at Athens, which would have been so cheering to
	him in the midst of philosophic cavillers; but from love to the
	Thessalonians, he is well content to be left all "alone" in
	the great city.</p>
