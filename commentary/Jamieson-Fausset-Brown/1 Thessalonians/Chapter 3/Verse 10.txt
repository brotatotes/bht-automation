<p><b>10. Night and day</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Night is the season for the saint's holiest meditations and
	prayers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3">2 Timothy 1:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>praying</b>—connected with,
	"we joy"; we joy while we pray; or else as ALFORD,
	<i>What thanks can we render to God while we pray?</i> The <i>Greek</i>
	implies a <i>beseeching</i> request. 
	</p>
<p><b>exceedingly</b>—literally,
	"more than exceeding abundantly" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3- :">2 Timothy 1:3- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that which is lacking</b>—Even
	the Thessalonians had points in which they needed improvement
	[BENGEL], (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3- :">2 Timothy 1:3- :</span>). Their doctrinal views as to the nearness of Christ's
	coming, and as to the state of those who had fallen asleep, and their
	practice in some points, needed correction (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3- :">2 Timothy 1:3- :</span>). Paul's method was to begin by commending what was
	praiseworthy, and then to correct what was amiss; a good pattern to
	all admonishers of others.</p>
