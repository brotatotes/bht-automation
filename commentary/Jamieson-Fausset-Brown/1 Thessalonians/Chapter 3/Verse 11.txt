11. Translate, "May
	God Himself, even our Father (there being but one article in
	the Greek, requires this translation, 'He who is at once God
	and our Father'), direct," c. The "Himself" stands in
	contrast with "we" ( :-) we desired to come but could not through Satan's
	hindrance; but if God Himself direct our way (as we pray),
	none can hinder Him (2 Thessalonians 2:16;
	2 Thessalonians 2:17). It is a remarkable
	proof of the unity of the Father and Son, that in the Greek
	here, and in 2 Thessalonians 2:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:17,
	the verb is singular, implying that the subject, the Father
	and Son, are but one in essential Being, not in mere unity of
	will. Almost all the chapters in both Epistles to the Thessalonians
	are sealed, each with its own prayer (1 Thessalonians 5:23;
	2 Thessalonians 1:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:16;
	2 Thessalonians 3:5; 2 Thessalonians 3:16)
	[BENGEL]. Paul does not
	think the prosperous issue of a journey an unfit subject for prayer
	(Romans 1:10; Romans 15:32)
	[EDMUNDS]. His prayer,
	though the answer was deferred, in about five years afterwards was
	fulfilled in his return to Macedonia.
