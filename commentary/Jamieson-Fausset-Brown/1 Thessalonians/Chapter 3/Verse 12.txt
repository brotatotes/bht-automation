<p><b>12.</b> The "you" in the
	<i>Greek</i> is emphatically put <i>first;</i> "But" (so
	the <i>Greek</i> for "and") what concerns "YOU,"
	whether we come or not, "may the Lord make you to increase and
	abound in love," c. The <i>Greek</i> for "increase"
	has a more <i>positive</i> force that for "abound" a more
	<i>comparative</i> force, "make you <i>full</i> (supplying 'that
	which is lacking,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:10">1 Thessalonians 3:10</span>)
	and even abound." "The Lord" may here be the Holy
	Spirit; so the Three Persons of the Trinity will be appealed to
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13- :">1 Thessalonians 3:13- :</span>. So the Holy Ghost is called "the Lord" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13- :">1 Thessalonians 3:13- :</span>). "Love" is the fruit of the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13- :">1 Thessalonians 3:13- :</span>), and His office is "to stablish in holiness"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>).</p>
