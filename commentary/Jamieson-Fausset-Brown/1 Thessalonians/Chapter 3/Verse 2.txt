<p><b>2. minister of God and our fellow
	labourer</b>—Some oldest manuscripts read, "fellow workman
	with God"; others, "minister of God." The former is
	probably genuine, as copyists probably altered it to the latter to
	avoid the bold phrase, which, however, is sanctioned by <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:1">2 Corinthians 6:1</span>. The <i>English Version</i>
	reading is not well supported, and is plainly compounded out of the
	two other readings. Paul calls Timothy "our <i>brother</i>"
	here; but in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:17">1 Corinthians 4:17</span>, "my
	<i>son.</i>" He speaks thus highly of one so lately ordained,
	both to impress the Thessalonians with a high respect for the
	delegate sent to them, and to encourage Timothy, who seems to have
	been of a timid character (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:23">1 Timothy 5:23</span>). "Gospel ministers
	do the work of God <i>with</i> Him, <i>for</i> Him, and <i>under</i>
	Him" [EDMUNDS]. 
	</p>
<p><b>establish</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"confirm." In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:3">2 Thessalonians 3:3</span>,
	GOD is said to "stablish":
	He is the true establisher: ministers are His "instruments."
	</p>
<p><b>concerning</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in behalf of," that is, <i>for the furtherance</i> of your
	faith. The <i>Greek</i> for "comfort" includes also the
	idea, "exhort." The Thessalonians in their trials needed
	both (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:3">1 Thessalonians 3:3</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:3- :">1 Thessalonians 3:3- :</span>).</p>
