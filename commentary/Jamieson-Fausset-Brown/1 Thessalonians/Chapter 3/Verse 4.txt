<p><b>4. that we should suffer</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"that we are about (we are sure) to suffer" according to
	the <i>appointment</i> of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>even as</b>—"<i>even</i>
	(exactly) as it <i>both</i> came to pass <i>and</i> ye know"; ye
	know <i>both</i> that it came to pass, <i>and</i> that we foretold it
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:19">John 13:19</span>). The
	correspondence of the event to the prediction powerfully confirms
	faith: "Forewarned, forearmed" [EDMUNDS].
	The repetition of "ye know," so frequently, is designed as
	an argument, that being forewarned of coming affliction, they should
	be less readily "moved" by it.</p>
