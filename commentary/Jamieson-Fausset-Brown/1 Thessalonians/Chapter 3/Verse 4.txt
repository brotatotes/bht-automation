4. that we should suffer—Greek,
	"that we are about (we are sure) to suffer" according to
	the appointment of God ( :-). 
	even as—"even
	(exactly) as it both came to pass and ye know"; ye
	know both that it came to pass, and that we foretold it
	(compare John 13:19). The
	correspondence of the event to the prediction powerfully confirms
	faith: "Forewarned, forearmed" [EDMUNDS].
	The repetition of "ye know," so frequently, is designed as
	an argument, that being forewarned of coming affliction, they should
	be less readily "moved" by it.
