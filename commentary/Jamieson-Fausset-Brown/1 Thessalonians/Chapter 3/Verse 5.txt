5. For this cause—Because I
	know of your "tribulation" having actually begun ( :-). 
	when I—Greek,
	"when I also (as well as Timothy, who, Paul delicately
	implies, was equally anxious respecting them, compare "we,"
	1 Thessalonians 3:1), could no longer
	contain myself (endure the suspense)." 
	I sent—Paul was the
	actual sender; hence the "I" here: Paul, Silas, and Timothy
	himself had agreed on the mission already, before Paul went to
	Athens: hence the "we," (see on 1 Thessalonians 3:1- :). 
	to know—to learn the
	state of your faith, whether it stood the trial (1 Thessalonians 3:1- :). 
	lest . . . have tempted . . .
	and . . . be—The indicative is used in the former sentence, the
	subjunctive in the latter. Translate therefore, "To know . . .
	whether haply the tempter have tempted you (the
	indicative implying that he supposed such was the case), and lest
	(in that case) our labor may prove to be in vain"
	(compare Galatians 4:11). Our labor in
	preaching would in that case be vain, so far as ye are
	concerned, but not as concerns us in so far as we have
	sincerely labored (Isaiah 49:4;
	1 Corinthians 3:8).
