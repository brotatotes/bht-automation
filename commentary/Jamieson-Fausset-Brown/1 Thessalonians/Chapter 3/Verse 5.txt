<p><b>5. For this cause</b>—Because I
	know of your "tribulation" having actually begun (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>when I</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"when I <i>also</i> (as well as Timothy, who, Paul delicately
	implies, was equally anxious respecting them, compare "we,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:1">1 Thessalonians 3:1</span>), could no longer
	contain myself (<i>endure</i> the suspense)." 
	</p>
<p><b>I sent</b>—Paul was the
	actual sender; hence the "I" here: Paul, Silas, and Timothy
	himself had agreed on the mission already, before Paul went to
	Athens: hence the "we," (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:1- :">1 Thessalonians 3:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>to know</b>—to learn the
	state of your faith, whether it stood the trial (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:1- :">1 Thessalonians 3:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>lest . . . have tempted . . .
	and . . . be</b>—The indicative is used in the former sentence, the
	subjunctive in the latter. Translate therefore, "To know . . .
	<i>whether haply</i> the tempter <i>have</i> tempted you (the
	indicative implying that he supposed such was the case), and <i>lest</i>
	(in that case) our labor <i>may prove to be</i> in vain"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:11">Galatians 4:11</span>). Our labor in
	preaching would in that case be vain, so far as <i>ye</i> are
	concerned, but not as concerns <i>us</i> in so far as <i>we</i> have
	sincerely labored (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:4">Isaiah 49:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:8">1 Corinthians 3:8</span>).</p>
