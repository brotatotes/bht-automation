<p><b>work with your own hands</b>—The
	Thessalonian converts were, it thus seems, chiefly of the <i>working</i>
	classes. Their expectation of the immediate coming of Christ led some
	enthusiasts among them to neglect their daily work and be dependent
	on the bounty of others. See end of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:12- :">2 Thessalonians 3:12- :</span>. The expectation was right in so far as that the Church
	should be always looking for Him; but they were wrong in making it a
	ground for neglecting their daily work. The evil, as it subsequently
	became worse, is more strongly reproved in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:12- :">2 Thessalonians 3:12- :</span>.</p>
