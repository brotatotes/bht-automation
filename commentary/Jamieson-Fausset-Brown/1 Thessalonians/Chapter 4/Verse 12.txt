<p><b>12. honestly</b>—in the <i>Old</i>
	English sense, "becomingly," as becomes your Christian
	profession; not bringing discredit on it in the eyes of the outer
	world, as if Christianity led to sloth and poverty (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>;

	the Christian Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:11">Mark 4:11</span>).

<p><b>have lack of nothing</b>—not
	have to beg from others for the supply of your wants (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:11- :">Mark 4:11- :</span>). So far from needing to beg from others, we ought to work
	and get the means of supplying the need of others. Freedom from
	pecuniary embarrassment is to be desired by the Christian on account
	of the liberty which it bestows.</p>
