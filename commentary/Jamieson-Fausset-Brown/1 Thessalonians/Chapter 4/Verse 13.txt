13. The leading topic of Paul's
	preaching at Thessalonica having been the coming kingdom ( :-), some perverted it into a cause for fear in respect to
	friends lately deceased, as if these would be excluded from the glory
	which those found alive alone should share. This error Paul here
	corrects (compare 1 Thessalonians 5:10). 
	I would not—All the
	oldest manuscripts and versions have "we would not."
	My fellow labourers (Silas and Timothy) and myself desire that ye
	should not be ignorant. 
	them which are asleep—The
	oldest manuscripts read present tense, "them which are
	sleeping"; the same as "the dead in Christ"
	(1 Thessalonians 4:16), to whose bodies (1 Thessalonians 4:16- :, not their souls; Ecclesiastes 12:7;
	2 Corinthians 5:8) death is a calm and holy
	sleep, from which the resurrection shall waken them to glory. The
	word "cemetery" means a sleeping-place. Observe, the
	glory and chief hope of the Church are not to be realized at death,
	but at the Lord's coming; one is not to anticipate the other, but all
	are to be glorified together at Christ's coming (Colossians 3:4;
	Hebrews 11:40). Death affects the
	mere individual; but the coming of Jesus the whole Church; at death
	our souls are invisibly and individually with the Lord; at Christ's
	coming the whole Church, with all its members, in body and soul,
	shall be visibly and collectively with Him. As this is offered as a
	consolation to mourning relatives, the mutual recognition of the
	saints at Christ's coming is hereby implied. 
	that ye sorrow not, even as
	others—Greek, "the rest"; all the rest of the
	world besides Christians. Not all natural mourning for dead
	friends is forbidden: for the Lord Jesus and Paul sinlessly gave way
	to it (John 11:31; John 11:33;
	John 11:35; Philippians 2:27);
	but sorrow as though there were "no hope," which indeed the
	heathen had not (Ephesians 2:12): the
	Christian hope here meant is that of the resurrection.
Psalms 16:9; Psalms 16:11;
	Psalms 17:15; Psalms 73:24;
	Proverbs 14:32, show that the Old
	Testament Church, though not having the hope so bright
	(Isaiah 38:18; Isaiah 38:19),
	yet had this hope. Contrast CATULLUS
	[Carmina 5.4], "When once our brief day has set, we must
	sleep one everlasting night." The sepulchral inscriptions of
	heathen Thessalonica express the hopeless view taken as to those once
	dead: as AESCHYLUS writes,
	"Of one once dead there is no resurrection." Whatever
	glimpses some heathen philosophers, had of the existence of the soul
	after death, they had none whatever of the body (Acts 17:18;
	Acts 17:20; Acts 17:32).
