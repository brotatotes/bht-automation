<p><b>13.</b> The leading topic of Paul's
	preaching at Thessalonica having been the coming <i>kingdom</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), some perverted it into a cause for fear in respect to
	friends lately deceased, as if these would be excluded from the glory
	which those found alive alone should share. This error Paul here
	corrects (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:10">1 Thessalonians 5:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>I would not</b>—All the
	oldest manuscripts and versions have "<i>we</i> would not."
	My fellow labourers (Silas and Timothy) and myself desire that ye
	should not be ignorant. 
	</p>
<p><b>them which are asleep</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read <i>present tense,</i> "them which are
	<i>sleeping</i>"; the same as "the dead in Christ"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>), to whose bodies (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16- :">1 Thessalonians 4:16- :</span>, not their <i>souls;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+12:7">Ecclesiastes 12:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:8">2 Corinthians 5:8</span>) death is a calm and holy
	sleep, from which the resurrection shall waken them to glory. The
	word "cemetery" means <i>a sleeping-place.</i> Observe, the
	glory and chief hope of the Church are not to be realized at death,
	but at the Lord's coming; one is not to anticipate the other, but all
	are to be glorified together at Christ's coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:40">Hebrews 11:40</span>). Death affects the
	mere individual; but the coming of Jesus the whole Church; at death
	our souls are invisibly and individually with the Lord; at Christ's
	coming the whole Church, with all its members, in body and soul,
	shall be visibly and collectively with Him. As this is offered as a
	consolation to mourning relatives, <i>the mutual recognition of the
	saints</i> at Christ's coming is hereby implied. 
	</p>
<p><b>that ye sorrow not, even as
	others</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "the rest"; all the rest of the
	world besides Christians. Not all natural <i>mourning</i> for dead
	friends is forbidden: for the Lord Jesus and Paul sinlessly gave way
	to it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:31">John 11:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:33">John 11:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:35">John 11:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:27">Philippians 2:27</span>);
	but sorrow as though there were "no hope," which indeed the
	heathen had not (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>): the
	Christian <i>hope</i> here meant is that of <i>the resurrection.</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:9">Psalms 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:11">Psalms 16:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+17:15">Psalms 17:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+73:24">Psalms 73:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+14:32">Proverbs 14:32</span>, show that the Old
	Testament Church, though not having the hope <i>so bright</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+38:18">Isaiah 38:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+38:19">Isaiah 38:19</span>),
	yet <i>had</i> this hope. Contrast CATULLUS
	[<i>Carmina</i> 5.4], "When once our brief day has set, we must
	sleep one everlasting night." The sepulchral inscriptions of
	heathen Thessalonica express the hopeless view taken as to those once
	dead: as AESCHYLUS writes,
	"Of one once dead there is no resurrection." Whatever
	glimpses some heathen philosophers, had of the existence of the soul
	after death, they had none whatever of the body (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:20">Acts 17:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:32">Acts 17:32</span>).</p>
