<p><b>14. For if</b>â€”confirmation of his
	statement, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span>, that the
	removal of <i>ignorance</i> as to the sleeping believers would remove
	undue grief respecting them. See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13- :">1 Thessalonians 4:13- :</span>, "hope." Hence it appears our <i>hope</i> rests on
	our <i>faith</i> ("if we believe"). "As surely as we
	all believe that Christ died and rose again (the very doctrine
	specified as taught at Thessalonica, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:13- :">1 Thessalonians 4:13- :</span>), <i>so also</i> will God bring <i>those laid to sleep by
	Jesus</i> with Him (Jesus)." (So the order and balance of the
	members of the <i>Greek</i> sentence require us to translate).
	Believers are laid in sleep by Jesus, and so will be brought back
	from sleep with Jesus in His train when He comes. The disembodied
	souls are not here spoken of; the reference is to the sleeping
	<i>bodies.</i> The facts of Christ's experience are repeated in the
	believer's. He died and then rose: so believers shall die and then
	rise with Him. But in His case <i>death</i> is the term used, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:6">1 Corinthians 15:6</span>, c. in theirs, <i>sleep;</i>
	because His death has taken for them the sting from death. The same
	Hand that shall raise them is that which <i>laid them to sleep.</i>
	"Laid to sleep by Jesus," answers to "dead in Christ"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>).</p>
