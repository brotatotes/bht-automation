<p><b>16. himself</b>—in all the Majesty
	of His presence in person, not by deputy. 
	</p>
<p><b>descend</b>—even as He
	ascended (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11">Acts 1:11</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>with</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in," implying one concomitant circumstance attending His
	appearing. 
	</p>
<p><b>shout</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"signal shout," "war shout." Jesus is represented
	as a victorious King, giving the word of command to the hosts of
	heaven in His train for the last onslaught, at His final triumph over
	sin, death, and Satan (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:11- :">Acts 1:11- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the voice of . . .
	archangel</b>—distinct from the "signal shout." Michael
	is perhaps meant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:9">Judges 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:7">Revelation 12:7</span>), to whom especially is
	committed the guardianship of the people of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:7- :">Revelation 12:7- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>trump of God</b>—the
	trumpet blast which usually accompanies God's manifestation in glory
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:16">Exodus 19:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+47:5">Psalms 47:5</span>);
	here the last of the three accompaniments of His appearing: as the
	trumpet was used to convene God's people to their solemn convocations
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+10:2">Numbers 10:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+10:10">Numbers 10:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:6">Numbers 31:6</span>), so here to summon God's
	elect together, preparatory to their glorification with Christ
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+50:1-5">Psalms 50:1-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:31">Matthew 24:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52">1 Corinthians 15:52</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>shall rise first</b>—previously
	to the living being "caught up." The "first" here
	has no reference to the <i>first</i> resurrection, as contrasted with
	that of "the rest of the dead." That reference occurs
	elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:41">Matthew 13:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:42">Matthew 13:42</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23">1 Corinthians 15:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24">1 Corinthians 15:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:5">Revelation 20:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6">Revelation 20:6</span>);
	it simply stands in opposition to "then," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6- :">Revelation 20:6- :</span>. FIRST, "the
	<i>dead</i> in Christ" shall rise, THEN
	the <i>living</i> shall be caught up. The Lord's people alone are
	spoken of here.</p>
