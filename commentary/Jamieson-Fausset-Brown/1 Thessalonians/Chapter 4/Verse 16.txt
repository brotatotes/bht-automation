16. himself—in all the Majesty
	of His presence in person, not by deputy. 
	descend—even as He
	ascended (Acts 1:11). 
	with—Greek,
	"in," implying one concomitant circumstance attending His
	appearing. 
	shout—Greek,
	"signal shout," "war shout." Jesus is represented
	as a victorious King, giving the word of command to the hosts of
	heaven in His train for the last onslaught, at His final triumph over
	sin, death, and Satan (Acts 1:11- :). 
	the voice of . . .
	archangel—distinct from the "signal shout." Michael
	is perhaps meant (Judges 1:9;
	Revelation 12:7), to whom especially is
	committed the guardianship of the people of God (Revelation 12:7- :). 
	trump of God—the
	trumpet blast which usually accompanies God's manifestation in glory
	(Exodus 19:16; Psalms 47:5);
	here the last of the three accompaniments of His appearing: as the
	trumpet was used to convene God's people to their solemn convocations
	(Numbers 10:2; Numbers 10:10;
	Numbers 31:6), so here to summon God's
	elect together, preparatory to their glorification with Christ
	(Psalms 50:1-5; Matthew 24:31;
	1 Corinthians 15:52). 
	shall rise first—previously
	to the living being "caught up." The "first" here
	has no reference to the first resurrection, as contrasted with
	that of "the rest of the dead." That reference occurs
	elsewhere (Matthew 13:41; Matthew 13:42;
	Matthew 13:50; John 5:29;
	1 Corinthians 15:23; 1 Corinthians 15:24;
	Revelation 20:5; Revelation 20:6);
	it simply stands in opposition to "then," Revelation 20:6- :. FIRST, "the
	dead in Christ" shall rise, THEN
	the living shall be caught up. The Lord's people alone are
	spoken of here.
