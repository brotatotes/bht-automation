17. we which are alive . . . shall
	be caught up—after having been "changed in a moment"
	(1 Corinthians 15:51; 1 Corinthians 15:52).
	Again he says, "we," recommending thus the expression to
	Christians of all ages, each generation bequeathing to the succeeding
	one a continually increasing obligation to look for the coming of the
	Lord. [EDMUNDS]. 
	together with them—all
	together: the raised dead, and changed living, forming one joint
	body. 
	in the clouds—Greek,
	"in clouds." The same honor is conferred on them as on
	their Lord. As He was taken in a cloud at His ascension (1 Corinthians 15:52- :), so at His return with clouds (1 Corinthians 15:52- :), they shall be caught up in clouds. The clouds are His and
	their triumphal chariot (Psalms 104:3;
	Daniel 7:13). ELLICOTT
	explains the Greek, "robed round by upbearing clouds"
	[Aids to Faith]. 
	in the air—rather,
	"into the air"; caught up into the region
	just above the earth, where the meeting (compare Matthew 25:1;
	Matthew 25:6) shall take place
	between them ascending, and their Lord descending towards the earth.
	Not that the air is to be the place of their lasting abode
	with Him. 
	and so shall we ever be with
	the Lord—no more parting, and no more going out (Re 3:12). His
	point being established, that the dead in Christ shall be on terms of
	equal advantage with those found alive at Christ's coming, he leaves
	undefined here the other events foretold elsewhere (as not being
	necessary to his discussion), Christ's reign on earth with His saints
	(1 Corinthians 6:2; 1 Corinthians 6:3),
	the final judgment and glorification of His saints in the new heaven
	and earth.
