<p><b>17. we which are alive . . . shall
	be caught up</b>—after having been "changed in a moment"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52">1 Corinthians 15:52</span>).
	Again he says, "we," recommending thus the expression to
	Christians of all ages, each generation bequeathing to the succeeding
	one a continually increasing obligation to look for the coming of the
	Lord. [EDMUNDS]. 
	</p>
<p><b>together with them</b>—all
	together: the raised dead, and changed living, forming one joint
	body. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the clouds</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in clouds." The same honor is conferred on them as on
	their Lord. As He was taken in a cloud at His ascension (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52- :">1 Corinthians 15:52- :</span>), so at His return with clouds (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52- :">1 Corinthians 15:52- :</span>), they shall be caught up in clouds. The clouds are His and
	their triumphal chariot (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:3">Psalms 104:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>). ELLICOTT
	explains the <i>Greek,</i> "robed round by upbearing clouds"
	[<i>Aids to Faith</i>]. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the air</b>—rather,
	"<i>into</i> the air"; caught up <i>into</i> the region
	just above the earth, where the <i>meeting</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1">Matthew 25:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span>) shall take place
	between them ascending, and their Lord descending towards the earth.
	Not that the air is to be the place of their <i>lasting abode</i>
	with Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>and so shall we ever be with
	the Lord</b>—no more parting, and no more going out (Re 3:12). His
	point being established, that the dead in Christ shall be on terms of
	equal advantage with those found alive at Christ's coming, he leaves
	undefined here the other events foretold elsewhere (as not being
	necessary to his discussion), Christ's reign on earth with His saints
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:2">1 Corinthians 6:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:3">1 Corinthians 6:3</span>),
	the final judgment and glorification of His saints in the new heaven
	and earth.</p>
