<p><b>2. by the Lord Jesus</b>â€”by His
	authority and direction, not by our own. He uses the strong term,
	"commandments," in writing to this Church not long founded,
	knowing that they would take it in a right spirit, and feeling it
	desirable that they should understand he spake with divine authority.
	He seldom uses the term in writing subsequently, when his authority
	was established, to other churches. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:10">1 Corinthians 7:10</span>;

	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:18">1 Thessalonians 4:18</span>, where the subject
	accounts for the strong expression) are the exceptions. "The
	Lord" marks His paramount authority, requiring implicit
	obedience.</p>
