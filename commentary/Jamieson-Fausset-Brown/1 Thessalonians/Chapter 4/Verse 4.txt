<p><b>how to possess his

	for himself) <i>his own</i> vessel," that is, that each should
	have <i>his own wife</i> so as to avoid fornication (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:3">1 Thessalonians 4:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:2">1 Corinthians 7:2</span>). The emphatical position
	of "his own" in the <i>Greek,</i> and the use of "vessel"
	for <i>wife,</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:7">1 Peter 3:7</span>, and
	in common Jewish phraseology, and the correct translation "acquire,"
	all justify this rendering.
