8. despiseth, c.—Greek,
	"setteth at naught" such engagements imposed on him in his
	calling, 1 Thessalonians 4:7 in relation to
	his "brother," 1 Thessalonians 4:6.
	He who doth so, "sets at naught not man (as for instance his
	brother), but God" (Psalms 51:4)
	is used of despising or rejecting God's minister, it
	may mean here, "He who despiseth" or "rejecteth"
	these our ministerial precepts. 
	who hath also given unto
	us—So some oldest manuscripts read, but most oldest manuscripts
	read, "Who (without 'also') giveth (present) unto you"
	(not "us"). 
	his Spirit—Greek,
	"His own Spirit, the Holy (One)"; thus emphatically
	marking "holiness" (Psalms 51:4- :) as the end for which the Holy (One) is being given. "Unto
	you," in the Greek, implies that the Spirit is being
	given unto, into (put "into" your hearts), and
	among you (compare 1 Thessalonians 2:9;
	Ephesians 4:30). "Giveth"
	implies that sanctification is not merely a work once for all
	accomplished in the past, but a present progressive work. So
	the Church of England Catechism, "sanctifieth (present)
	all the elect people of God." "His own" implies that
	as He gives you that which is essentially identical with Himself, He
	expects you should become like Himself (1 Peter 1:16;
	2 Peter 1:4).
