<p><b>8. despiseth,</b> c.—<i>Greek,</i>
	"setteth at naught" such engagements imposed on him in his
	calling, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:7">1 Thessalonians 4:7</span> in relation to
	his "brother," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:6">1 Thessalonians 4:6</span>.
	He who doth so, "sets at naught not man (as for instance his
	brother), but God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:4">Psalms 51:4</span>)
	is used of <i>despising</i> or <i>rejecting</i> God's minister, it
	may mean here, "He who despiseth" or "rejecteth"
	these our ministerial precepts. 
	</p>
<p><b>who hath also given unto
	us</b>—So some oldest manuscripts read, but most oldest manuscripts
	read, "Who (without 'also') <i>giveth</i> (present) unto <i>you</i>"
	(not "us"). 
	</p>
<p><b>his Spirit</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"His own Spirit, the <i>Holy</i> (One)"; thus emphatically
	marking "holiness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:4- :">Psalms 51:4- :</span>) as the end for which the Holy (One) is being given. "Unto
	you," in the <i>Greek,</i> implies that the Spirit is being
	given <i>unto, into</i> (put "into" your hearts), <i>and
	among</i> you (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:30">Ephesians 4:30</span>). "Giveth"
	implies that sanctification is not merely a work once for all
	accomplished in the past, but a <i>present progressive</i> work. So
	the Church of England Catechism, "<i>sanctifieth</i> (present)
	all the elect people of God." "His own" implies that
	as He gives you that which is essentially identical with Himself, He
	expects you should become like Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:16">1 Peter 1:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>).</p>
