<p><b>11. comfort yourselves</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"one another." Here he reverts to the same consolatory
	strain as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:18">1 Thessalonians 4:18</span>.

<p><b>edify one another</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "edify (ye) the one the other"; "edify,"
	literally, "build up," namely, in faith, hope, and love, by
	discoursing together on such edifying topics as the Lord's coming,
	and the glory of the saints (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:18- :">1 Thessalonians 4:18- :</span>).</p>
