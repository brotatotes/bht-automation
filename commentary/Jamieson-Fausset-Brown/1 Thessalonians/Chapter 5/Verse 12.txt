12. beseech—"Exhort"
	is the expression in 1 Thessalonians 5:14;
	here, "we beseech you," as if it were a personal favor
	(Paul making the cause of the Thessalonian presbyters, as it were,
	his own). 
	know—to have a regard
	and respect for. Recognize their office, and treat them accordingly
	(compare 1 Corinthians 16:18) with
	reverence and with liberality in supplying their needs (1 Corinthians 16:18- :). The Thessalonian Church having been newly planted, the
	ministers were necessarily novices (1 Corinthians 16:18- :), which may have been in part the cause of the people's
	treating them with less respect. Paul's practice seems to have been
	to ordain elders in every Church soon after its establishment (1 Corinthians 16:18- :). 
	them which labour . . . are
	over . . . admonish you—not three classes of ministers, but
	one, as there is but one article common to the three in the Greek.
	"Labor" expresses their laborious life; "are over
	you," their pre-eminence as presidents or superintendents
	("bishops," that is, overseers, 1 Corinthians 16:18- :, "them that have rule over you," literally,
	leaders, Hebrews 13:17;
	"pastors," literally, shepherds, Hebrews 13:17- :); "admonish you," one of their leading functions;
	the Greek is "put in mind," implying not arbitrary
	authority, but gentle, though faithful, admonition (2 Timothy 2:14;
	2 Timothy 2:24; 2 Timothy 2:25;
	1 Peter 5:3). 
	in the Lord—Their
	presidency over you is in divine things; not in worldly
	affairs, but in things appertaining to the Lord.
