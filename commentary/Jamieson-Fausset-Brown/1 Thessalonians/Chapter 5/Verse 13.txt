<p><b>for their work's sake</b>—The
	high nature of their work alone, the furtherance of your salvation
	and of the kingdom of Christ, should be a sufficient motive to claim
	your reverential love. At the same time, the word "work,"
	teaches ministers that, while claiming the reverence due to their
	office, it is not a sinecure, but a "work"; compare "<i>labor</i>"
	(even to <i>weariness:</i> so the <i>Greek</i>), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.

<p><b>be at peace among
	yourselves</b>—The "and" is not in the original. Let
	there not only be peace between ministers and their flocks, but also
	no party rivalries among yourselves, one contending in behalf of some
	one favorite minister, another in behalf of another (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:50">Mark 9:50</span>;
