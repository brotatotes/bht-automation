<p><b>14. brethren</b>—This exhortation
	to "warm (<i>Greek,</i> 'admonish,' as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) the unruly (those 'disorderly' persons, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:11">2 Thessalonians 3:11</span>, who would not work, and
	yet expected to be maintained, literally, said of soldiers who will
	<i>not</i> remain <i>in their ranks,</i> compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:11- :">2 Thessalonians 3:11- :</span>; also those insubordinate as to Church discipline, in
	relation to those 'over' the Church, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:11- :">2 Thessalonians 3:11- :</span>), comfort the feeble-minded (the <i>faint-hearted,</i> who
	are ready to sink 'without hope' in afflictions, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:11- :">2 Thessalonians 3:11- :</span>, and temptations)," applies to all clergy and laity
	alike, though primarily the duty of the clergy (who are meant in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:11- :">2 Thessalonians 3:11- :</span>)." 
	</p>
<p><b>support</b>—literally, "lay
	fast hold on so as to support." 
	</p>
<p><b>the weak</b>—spiritually.
	Paul practiced what he preached (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:11- :">2 Thessalonians 3:11- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>be patient toward all
	men</b>—There is no believer who needs not the exercise of patience
	"toward" him; there is none to whom a believer ought not to
	show it; many show it more to strangers than to their own families,
	more to the great than to the humble; but we ought to show it "toward
	<i>all men</i>" [BENGEL].
	Compare "the long-suffering of our Lord" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1">2 Corinthians 10:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:15">2 Peter 3:15</span>).</p>
