18. In every thing—even what
	seems adverse: for nothing is really so (compare
	Romans 8:28; Ephesians 5:20).
	See Christ's example (Matthew 15:36;
	Matthew 26:27; Luke 10:21;
	John 11:41). 
	this—That ye should
	"rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing, (and) in every thing
	give thanks," "is the will of God in Christ Jesus (as the
	Mediator and Revealer of that will, observed by those who are in
	Christ by faith, compare John 11:41- :) concerning you." God's will is the believer's
	law. LACHMANN rightly
	reads commas at the end of the three precepts (John 11:41- :), making "this" refer to all three.
