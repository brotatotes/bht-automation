2. as a thief in the nightâ€”The
	apostles in this image follow the parable of their Lord, expressing
	how the Lord's coming shall take men by surprise (Matthew 24:43;
	2 Peter 3:10). "The night
	is wherever there is quiet unconcern" [BENGEL].
	"At midnight" (perhaps figurative: to some parts of the
	earth it will be literal night), 2 Peter 3:10- :. The thief not only gives no notice of his approach but
	takes all precaution to prevent the household knowing of it. So the
	Lord (Revelation 16:15). Signs
	will precede the coming, to confirm the patient hope of the watchful
	believer; but the coming itself shall be sudden at last (Matthew 24:32-36;
	Luke 21:25-32; Luke 21:35).
