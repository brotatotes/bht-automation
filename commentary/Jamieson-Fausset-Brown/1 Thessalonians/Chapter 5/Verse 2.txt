<p><b>2. as a thief in the night</b>â€”The
	apostles in this image follow the parable of their Lord, expressing
	how the Lord's coming shall take men by surprise (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:43">Matthew 24:43</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span>). "The <i>night</i>
	is wherever there is quiet unconcern" [BENGEL].
	"At midnight" (perhaps figurative: to some parts of the
	earth it will be <i>literal</i> night), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10- :">2 Peter 3:10- :</span>. The thief not only gives no notice of his approach but
	takes all precaution to prevent the household knowing of it. So the
	Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>). <i>Signs</i>
	will precede the coming, to confirm the patient hope of the watchful
	believer; but the coming itself shall be sudden at last (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:32-36">Matthew 24:32-36</span>;
