<p><b>21, 22.</b> Some of the oldest
	manuscripts insert "But." You ought indeed not to "quench"
	the manifestations of "the Spirit," nor "despise
	prophesyings"; "but," at the same time, do not take
	"all" as genuine which professes to be so; "prove
	(test) all" such manifestations. The means of testing them
	existed in the Church, in those who had the "discerning of
	spirits" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:10">1 Corinthians 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:29">1 Corinthians 14:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1">1 John 4:1</span>). Another sure test,
	which we also have, is, to try the professed revelation whether it
	accords with Scripture, as the noble Bereans did (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:20">Isaiah 8:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:11">Acts 17:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:9">Galatians 1:9</span>). This precept negatives
	the Romish priest's assumption of infallibly laying down the law,
	without the laity having the right, in the exercise of private
	judgment, to test it by Scripture. LOCKE
	says, Those who are for laying aside reason in matters of revelation,
	resemble one who would <i>put out his eyes</i> in order to use a
	<i>telescope.</i>

<p><b>hold fast that which is
	good</b>â€”Join this clause with the next clause (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:9- :">Galatians 1:9- :</span>), not merely with the sentence preceding. As the result of
	your "proving all things," and especially all <i>prophesyings,</i>
	"<i>hold fast</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:15">Luke 8:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:1">Hebrews 2:1</span>)
	the good, and <i>hold yourselves aloof from</i> every appearance of
	evil" ("<i>every evil species</i>" [BENGEL
	and WAHL]). Do not accept
	even a professedly spirit-inspired communication, if it be at
	variance with the truth taught you (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:1- :">Hebrews 2:1- :</span>).</p>
