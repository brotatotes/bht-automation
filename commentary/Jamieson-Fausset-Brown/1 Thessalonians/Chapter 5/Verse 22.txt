<p><b>22.</b> TITTMANN
	supports <i>English Version,</i> "from every evil <i>appearance</i>"
	or "semblance." The context, however, does not refer to
	<i>evil appearances</i> IN
	OURSELVES which we ought to abstain from, but to <i>holding
	ourselves aloof from every evil appearance</i> IN
	OTHERS; as for instance, in the pretenders to spirit-inspired
	prophesyings. In many cases the Christian should <i>not</i> abstain
	from what has the <i>semblance</i> ("appearance") of evil,
	though really good. Jesus healed on the sabbath, and ate with
	publicans and sinners, acts which wore the <i>appearance</i> of evil,
	but which were not to be abstained from on that account, being really
	good. I agree with TITTMANN
	rather than with BENGEL,
	whom ALFORD follows. The
	context favors this sense: However <i>specious</i> be the <i>form</i>
	or <i>outward appearance</i> of such would-be prophets and their
	prophesyings, hold yourselves aloof from every such form when it is
	evil, literally, "Hold yourselves aloof from every evil
	appearance" or "form."</p>
