22. TITTMANN
	supports English Version, "from every evil appearance"
	or "semblance." The context, however, does not refer to
	evil appearances IN
	OURSELVES which we ought to abstain from, but to holding
	ourselves aloof from every evil appearance IN
	OTHERS; as for instance, in the pretenders to spirit-inspired
	prophesyings. In many cases the Christian should not abstain
	from what has the semblance ("appearance") of evil,
	though really good. Jesus healed on the sabbath, and ate with
	publicans and sinners, acts which wore the appearance of evil,
	but which were not to be abstained from on that account, being really
	good. I agree with TITTMANN
	rather than with BENGEL,
	whom ALFORD follows. The
	context favors this sense: However specious be the form
	or outward appearance of such would-be prophets and their
	prophesyings, hold yourselves aloof from every such form when it is
	evil, literally, "Hold yourselves aloof from every evil
	appearance" or "form."
