<p><b>23. the very God</b>—rather as the
	<i>Greek,</i> "the God of peace <i>Himself</i>"; who can do
	for you by His own power what <i>I</i> cannot do by all my monitions,
	nor <i>you</i> by all your efforts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20">Hebrews 13:20</span>), namely, keep you from
	all evil, and give you all that is good. 
	</p>
<p><b>sanctify you</b>—for
	<i>holiness</i> is the necessary condition of "peace" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20- :">Hebrews 13:20- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>wholly</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"(so that you should be) perfect in every respect"
	[TITTMANN]. 
	</p>
<p><b>and</b>—that is, "<i>and</i>
	so (omit 'I pray God'; not in the <i>Greek</i>) may your . . . spirit
	and soul and body be preserved," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>whole</b>—A different <i>Greek</i>
	word from "wholly." Translate, "entire" with none
	of the integral parts wanting [TITTMANN].
	It refers to man in his normal integrity, as originally designed; an
	ideal which shall be attained by the glorified believer. All three,
	spirit, soul, and body, each in its due place, constitute man
	"entire." The "spirit" links man with the higher
	intelligences of heaven, and is that highest part of man which is
	receptive of the quickening Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20- :">Hebrews 13:20- :</span>). In the unspiritual, the spirit is so sunk under the lower
	animal <i>soul</i> (which it ought to keep under) that such are
	termed "animal" (<i>English Version.</i> "sensual,"
	having merely the <i>body</i> of organized matter, and the <i>soul</i>
	the immaterial animating essence), having <i>not the Spirit</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14">1 Corinthians 2:14</span>; see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14- :">1 Corinthians 2:14- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14- :">1 Corinthians 2:14- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14- :">1 Corinthians 2:14- :</span>). The unbeliever shall rise with an <i>animal</i>
	(soul-animated) <i>body,</i> but not like the believer with a
	<i>spiritual</i> (spirit-endued) <i>body</i> like Christ's (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14- :">1 Corinthians 2:14- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>blameless unto</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "blamelessly (so as to be in a blameless state)
	at the coming of Christ." In <i>Hebrew,</i> "peace"
	and "wholly" (perfect in every respect) are kindred terms;
	so that the prayer shows what the title "God of peace"
	implies. BENGEL takes
	"wholly" as <i>collectively,</i> all the Thessalonians
	without exception, so that no one should fail. And "whole
	(entire)," <i>individually,</i> each one of them entire, with
	"spirit, soul, and body." The mention of the preservation
	of the <i>body</i> accords with the subject (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:14- :">1 Corinthians 2:14- :</span>). TRENCH better
	regards "wholly" as meaning, "having perfectly
	attained the moral <i>end,</i>" namely, to be a full-grown man
	in Christ. "Whole," <i>complete,</i> with no grace which
	ought to be wanting in a Christian.</p>
