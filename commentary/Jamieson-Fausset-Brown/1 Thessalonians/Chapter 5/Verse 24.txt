24. Faithful—to His covenant
	promises (John 10:27-29;
	1 Corinthians 1:9; 1 Corinthians 10:23;
	Philippians 1:6). 
	he that calleth you—God,
	the caller of His people, will cause His calling not to fall short of
	its designed end. 
	do it—preserve and
	present you blameless at the coming of Christ (1 Thessalonians 5:23;
	Romans 8:30; 1 Peter 5:10).
	You must not look at the foes before and behind, on the right hand
	and on the left, but to God's faithfulness to His promises, God's
	zeal for His honor, and God's love for those whom He calls.
