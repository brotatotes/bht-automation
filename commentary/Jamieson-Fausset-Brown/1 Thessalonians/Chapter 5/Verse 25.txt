25. Some oldest manuscripts
	read, "Pray ye also for (literally, 'concerning')
	us"; make us and our work the subject of your prayers, even as
	we have been just praying for you ( :-). Others omit the "also." The clergy need much the
	prayers of their flocks. Paul makes the same request in the Epistles
	to Romans, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, and in
	Second Corinthians; not so in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus,
	whose intercessions, as his spiritual sons, he was already sure of;
	nor in the Epistles, I Corinthians, and Galatians, as these Epistles
	abound in rebuke.
