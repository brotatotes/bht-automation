<p><b>27. I charge</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "I
	adjure you." 
	</p>
<p><b>read unto all</b>—namely,
	publicly in the congregation at a particular time. The <i>Greek</i>
	aorist tense implies a single act done at a particular time. The
	earnestness of his adjuration implies how solemnly important he felt
	this divinely inspired message to be. Also, as this was the FIRST
	of the Epistles of the New Testament, he makes this the occasion of a
	solemn charge, that so its being publicly read should be a sample of
	what should be done in the case of the others, just as the Pentateuch
	and the Prophets were publicly read under the Old Testament, and are
	still read in the synagogue. Compare the same injunction as to the
	public reading of the Apocalypse, the LAST
	of the New Testament canon (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>).
	The "all" includes women and children, and especially those
	who could not read it themselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+31:12">Deuteronomy 31:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jos+8:33-35">Joshua 8:33-35</span>). What Paul
	commands with an adjuration, Rome forbids under a curse [BENGEL].
	Though these Epistles had difficulties, the laity were all to hear
	them read (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:11">1 Peter 4:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span>;
	even the very young, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>). "Holy" is
	omitted before "brethren" in most of the oldest
	manuscripts, though some of them support it.</p>
