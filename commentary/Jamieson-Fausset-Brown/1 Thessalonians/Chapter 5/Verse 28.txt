<p><b>28.</b> (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.) Paul ends as he began (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), with "grace." The oldest manuscripts omit "Amen,"
	which probably was the response of the Church after the public
	reading of the Epistle. 
	</p>
<p>The subscription is a
	comparatively modern addition. The Epistle was not, as it states,
	written from Athens, but from Corinth; for it is written in the names
	of Silas and Timothy (besides Paul), who did not join the apostle
	before he reached the latter city (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
