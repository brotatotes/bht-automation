	"FOR ye are all,"
	c. Ye have no reason for fear, or for being taken by surprise, by the
	coming of the day of the Lord: "For ye are all sons (so
	the Greek) of light and sons of day" a Hebrew
	idiom, implying that as sons resemble their fathers, so you
	are in character light (intellectually and morally illuminated
	in a spiritual point of view), Luke 16:8;
	John 12:36. 
	are not ofâ€”that is,
	belong not to night nor darkness. The change of person from
	"ye" to "we" implies this: Ye are sons of
	light because ye are Christians; and we, Christians, are not
	of night nor darkness.
