7. This verse is to be taken in
	the literal sense. Night is the time when sleepers sleep, and
	drinking men are drunk. To sleep by day would imply great indolence;
	to be drunken by day, great shamelessness. Now, in a spiritual sense,
	"we Christians profess to be day people, not night people;
	therefore our work ought to be day work, not night work; our conduct
	such as will bear the eye of day, and such has no need of the veil of
	night" [EDMUNDS],
	(1 Thessalonians 5:8).
