<p><b>8.</b> <i>Faith, hope,</i> and <i>love,</i>
	are the three pre-eminent graces (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:13">1 Corinthians 13:13</span>). We must not only be
	awake and sober, but also <i>armed;</i> not only watchful, but also
	guarded. The armor here is only <i>defensive;</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:13- :">1 Corinthians 13:13- :</span>, also <i>offensive.</i> Here, therefore, the reference is
	to the Christian means of being <i>guarded</i> against being
	surprised by the day of the Lord as a thief in the night. The <i>helmet</i>
	and <i>breastplate</i> defend the two vital parts, the head and the
	heart respectively. "With head and heart right, the whole man is
	right" [EDMUNDS]. The
	head needs to be kept from error, the heart from sin. For "the
	breastplate of righteousness," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:13- :">1 Corinthians 13:13- :</span>, we have here "the breastplate of faith and love";
	for the righteousness which is imputed to man for justification, is
	"faith working by love" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:22-24">Romans 4:22-24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6">Galatians 5:6</span>).
	"Faith," as the motive <i>within,</i> and "love,"
	exhibited in <i>outward</i> acts, constitute the perfection of
	<i>righteousness.</i> In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:17">Ephesians 6:17</span>
	the helmet is "salvation"; here, "the <i>hope</i> of
	salvation." In one aspect "salvation" is a present
	possession (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:13">1 John 5:13</span>); in another, it is a
	matter of "hope" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:25">Romans 8:25</span>). Our Head primarily
	wore the "breastplate of righteousness" and "helmet of
	salvation," that we might, by union with Him, receive both.</p>
