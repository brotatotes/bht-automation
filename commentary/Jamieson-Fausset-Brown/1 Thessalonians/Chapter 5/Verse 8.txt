8. Faith, hope, and love,
	are the three pre-eminent graces (1 Thessalonians 1:3;
	1 Corinthians 13:13). We must not only be
	awake and sober, but also armed; not only watchful, but also
	guarded. The armor here is only defensive; in 1 Corinthians 13:13- :, also offensive. Here, therefore, the reference is
	to the Christian means of being guarded against being
	surprised by the day of the Lord as a thief in the night. The helmet
	and breastplate defend the two vital parts, the head and the
	heart respectively. "With head and heart right, the whole man is
	right" [EDMUNDS]. The
	head needs to be kept from error, the heart from sin. For "the
	breastplate of righteousness," 1 Corinthians 13:13- :, we have here "the breastplate of faith and love";
	for the righteousness which is imputed to man for justification, is
	"faith working by love" (Romans 4:3;
	Romans 4:22-24; Galatians 5:6).
	"Faith," as the motive within, and "love,"
	exhibited in outward acts, constitute the perfection of
	righteousness. In Ephesians 6:17
	the helmet is "salvation"; here, "the hope of
	salvation." In one aspect "salvation" is a present
	possession (John 3:36; John 5:24;
	1 John 5:13); in another, it is a
	matter of "hope" (Romans 8:24;
	Romans 8:25). Our Head primarily
	wore the "breastplate of righteousness" and "helmet of
	salvation," that we might, by union with Him, receive both.
