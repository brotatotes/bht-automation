	Christ "acquired (so the <i>Greek</i> for 'purchased') the
	Church (and its salvation) with His own blood" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5- :">Ephesians 1:5- :</span>); each member is said to be appointed by God to the
	"acquiring of salvation." In the primary sense, God does
	the work; in the secondary sense, man does it.</p>
