	"set" (Acts 13:47), in

	to obtain—Greek,
	"to the acquisition of salvation"; said, according to
	BENGEL, Of One saved out
	of a general wreck, when all things else have been lost: so of the
	elect saved out of the multitude of the lost (2 Thessalonians 2:13;
	2 Thessalonians 2:14). The fact of God's
	"appointment" of His grace "through Jesus Christ"
	(Ephesians 1:5), takes away the notion
	of our being able to "acquire" salvation of ourselves.
	Christ "acquired (so the Greek for 'purchased') the
	Church (and its salvation) with His own blood" (Ephesians 1:5- :); each member is said to be appointed by God to the
	"acquiring of salvation." In the primary sense, God does
	the work; in the secondary sense, man does it.
