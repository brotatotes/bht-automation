<p><b>1. by the commandment of God</b>—the
	authoritative <i>injunction,</i> as well as the commission, of God.
	In the earlier Epistles the phrase is, "by the <i>will</i> of
	God." Here it is expressed in a manner implying that a necessity
	was laid on him to act as an apostle, not that it was merely at his
	option. The same expression occurs in the doxology, probably written
	long after the Epistle itself [ALFORD]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:26">Romans 16:26</span>).

	It was a Jewish expression in devotion, drawn from the Old Testament
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+106:21">Psalms 106:21</span>).
