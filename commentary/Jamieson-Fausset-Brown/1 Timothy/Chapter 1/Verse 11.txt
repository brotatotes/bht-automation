<p><b>11. According to the glorious
	gospel</b>—The <i>Christian's freedom from the law as a sanctifier,
	as well as a justifier,</i> implied in the previous, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:9">1 Timothy 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10">1 Timothy 1:10</span>, is what this <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10- :">1 Timothy 1:10- :</span> is connected with. This exemption of the righteous from the
	law, and assignment of it to the lawless as its true object, is
	"according to the Gospel <i>of the glory</i> (so the <i>Greek,</i>
	compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10- :">1 Timothy 1:10- :</span>)
	of the blessed God." The Gospel manifests God's glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span>) in accounting
	"righteous" the believer, through the righteousness of
	Christ, without "the law" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:16- :">Ephesians 3:16- :</span>); and in imparting that righteousness whereby he loathes all
	those sins against which (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:9">1 Timothy 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10">1 Timothy 1:10</span>) the law is directed.
	The term, "blessed," indicates at once <i>immortality</i>
	and <i>supreme happiness.</i> The supremely blessed One is He from
	whom all blessedness flows. This term, as applied to GOD,
	occurs only here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:15">1 Timothy 6:15</span>:
	appropriate in speaking here of the Gospel blessedness, in contrast
	to the <i>curse</i> on those under the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:9">1 Timothy 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10">Galatians 3:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>committed to my
	trust</b>—Translate as in the <i>Greek</i> order, which brings into
	prominent emphasis <i>Paul,</i> "committed in trust to me";
	in contrast to the kind of law-teaching which <i>they</i> (who had no
	Gospel commission), the false teachers, <i>assumed to themselves</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:8">1 Timothy 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:3">Titus 1:3</span>).</p>
