11. According to the glorious
	gospel—The Christian's freedom from the law as a sanctifier,
	as well as a justifier, implied in the previous, 1 Timothy 1:9;
	1 Timothy 1:10, is what this 1 Timothy 1:10- : is connected with. This exemption of the righteous from the
	law, and assignment of it to the lawless as its true object, is
	"according to the Gospel of the glory (so the Greek,
	compare Note, see on 1 Timothy 1:10- :)
	of the blessed God." The Gospel manifests God's glory (Ephesians 1:17;
	Ephesians 3:16) in accounting
	"righteous" the believer, through the righteousness of
	Christ, without "the law" (Ephesians 3:16- :); and in imparting that righteousness whereby he loathes all
	those sins against which (1 Timothy 1:9;
	1 Timothy 1:10) the law is directed.
	The term, "blessed," indicates at once immortality
	and supreme happiness. The supremely blessed One is He from
	whom all blessedness flows. This term, as applied to GOD,
	occurs only here and in 1 Timothy 6:15:
	appropriate in speaking here of the Gospel blessedness, in contrast
	to the curse on those under the law (1 Timothy 1:9;
	Galatians 3:10). 
	committed to my
	trust—Translate as in the Greek order, which brings into
	prominent emphasis Paul, "committed in trust to me";
	in contrast to the kind of law-teaching which they (who had no
	Gospel commission), the false teachers, assumed to themselves
	(1 Timothy 1:8; Titus 1:3).
