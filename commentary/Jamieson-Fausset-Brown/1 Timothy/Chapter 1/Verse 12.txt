<p><b>12.</b> The honor done him in having
	the Gospel ministry committed to him suggests the digression to what
	he once was, no better (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:13">1 Timothy 1:13</span>)
	than those lawless ones described above (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:9">1 Timothy 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:10">1 Timothy 1:10</span>), when the grace of our
	Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:14">1 Timothy 1:14</span>) visited him.

<p><b>And</b>—omitted in most
	(not all) of the oldest manuscripts. 
	</p>
<p><b>I thank</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"I have (that is, feel) gratitude." 
	</p>
<p><b>enabled me</b>—the same
	<i>Greek</i> verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22">Acts 9:22</span>,
	"Saul increased the more in strength." An undesigned
	coincidence between Paul and Luke, his companion. <i>Enabled</i> me,
	namely, for the ministry. "It is not in my own strength that I
	bring this doctrine to men, but as strengthened and nerved by Him who
	saved me" [THEODORET].
	Man is by nature "without strength" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22- :">Acts 9:22- :</span>). True conversion and calling confer power [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>for that</b>—the main
	ground of his "thanking Christ." 
	</p>
<p><b>he counted me faithful</b>—He
	foreordered and foresaw that I would be faithful to the trust
	committed to me. Paul's <i>thanking</i> God for this shows that the
	merit of his faithfulness was due solely to God's grace, not to his
	own natural strength (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span>).
	<i>Faithfulness</i> is the quality required in a steward (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25- :">1 Corinthians 7:25- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>putting me into</b>—rather
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9">1 Thessalonians 5:9</span>, "appointing
	me (in His sovereign purposes of grace) unto the ministry" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:9- :">1 Thessalonians 5:9- :</span>).</p>
