12. The honor done him in having
	the Gospel ministry committed to him suggests the digression to what
	he once was, no better (1 Timothy 1:13)
	than those lawless ones described above (1 Timothy 1:9;
	1 Timothy 1:10), when the grace of our
	Lord (1 Timothy 1:14) visited him. 
	And—omitted in most
	(not all) of the oldest manuscripts. 
	I thank—Greek,
	"I have (that is, feel) gratitude." 
	enabled me—the same
	Greek verb as in Acts 9:22,
	"Saul increased the more in strength." An undesigned
	coincidence between Paul and Luke, his companion. Enabled me,
	namely, for the ministry. "It is not in my own strength that I
	bring this doctrine to men, but as strengthened and nerved by Him who
	saved me" [THEODORET].
	Man is by nature "without strength" (Acts 9:22- :). True conversion and calling confer power [BENGEL].
	for that—the main
	ground of his "thanking Christ." 
	he counted me faithful—He
	foreordered and foresaw that I would be faithful to the trust
	committed to me. Paul's thanking God for this shows that the
	merit of his faithfulness was due solely to God's grace, not to his
	own natural strength (1 Corinthians 7:25).
	Faithfulness is the quality required in a steward (1 Corinthians 7:25- :). 
	putting me into—rather
	as in 1 Thessalonians 5:9, "appointing
	me (in His sovereign purposes of grace) unto the ministry" (1 Thessalonians 5:9- :).
