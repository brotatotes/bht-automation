<p><b>13. Who was before</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Formerly being a blasphemer." "<i>Notwithstanding
	that I was</i> before a blasphemer," c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9">Acts 26:9</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11">Acts 26:11</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>persecutor</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:11- :">Acts 26:11- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>injurious</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"insulter"; one who acts injuriously from arrogant contempt
	of others. Translate, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:30">Romans 1:30</span>,
	"despiteful." One who added insult to injury. BENGEL
	translates, "a despiser." I prefer the idea, <i>contumelious
	to others</i> [WAHL].
	Still I agree with BENGEL
	that "blasphemer" is against <i>God,</i> "persecutor,"
	against holy <i>men,</i> and "insolently injurious"
	includes, with the idea of injuring others, that of insolent
	"uppishness" [DONALDSON]
	in relation to <i>one's self.</i> This threefold relation to God, to
	one's neighbor, and to one's self, occurs often in this Epistle
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:9">1 Timothy 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:14">1 Timothy 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:12">Titus 2:12</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>I obtained mercy</b>—God's
	mercy, and Paul's want of it, stand in sharp contrast [ELLICOTT];
	<i>Greek,</i> "I was made the object of mercy." The sense
	of mercy was perpetual in the mind of the apostle (compare <i>Note,</i>
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>). Those who have
	felt mercy can best have mercy on those out of the way (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:2">Hebrews 5:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:3">Hebrews 5:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>because I did it
	ignorantly</b>—<i>Ignorance</i> does not in itself deserve pardon;
	but it is a less culpable cause of unbelief than pride and wilful
	hardening of one's self against the truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:41">John 9:41</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9">Acts 26:9</span>). Hence it is Christ's
	plea of intercession for His murderers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9- :">Acts 26:9- :</span>); and it is made by the apostles a mitigating circumstance
	in the Jews' sin, and one giving a hope of a door of repentance
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:17">Acts 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:2">Romans 10:2</span>).
	The "because," c., does not imply that ignorance was a
	sufficient reason for <i>mercy</i> being bestowed but shows how it
	was possible that such a sinner could obtain mercy. The positive
	ground of mercy being shown to him, lies solely in the compassion of
	God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5">Titus 3:5</span>). The ground of the
	<i>ignorance</i> lies in the <i>unbelief,</i> which implies that this
	ignorance is not unaccompanied with guilt. But there is a great
	difference between his honest zeal for the law, and a wilful striving
	against the Spirit of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24-32">Matthew 12:24-32</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:52">Luke 11:52</span>) [WIESINGER].</p>
