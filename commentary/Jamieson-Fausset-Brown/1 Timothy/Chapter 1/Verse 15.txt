15. faithful—worthy of credit,
	because "God" who says it "is faithful" to His
	word (1 Corinthians 1:9; 1 Thessalonians 5:24;
	2 Thessalonians 3:3; Revelation 21:5;
	Revelation 22:6). This seems to have
	become an axiomatic saying among Christians the phrase,
	"faithful saying," is peculiar to the Pastoral Epistles
	(1 Timothy 2:11; 1 Timothy 4:9;
	Titus 3:8). Translate as Greek,
	"Faithful is the saying." 
	all—all possible; full;
	to be received by all, and with all the faculties of the soul, mind,
	and heart. Paul, unlike the false teachers (Titus 3:8- :), understands what he is saying, and whereof he affirms;
	and by his simplicity of style and subject, setting forth the grand
	fundamental truth of salvation through Christ, confutes the false
	teachers' abstruse and unpractical speculations (1 Corinthians 1:18-28;
	Titus 2:1). 
	acceptation—reception
	(as of a boon) into the heart, as well as the understanding, with all
	gladness; this is faith acting on the Gospel offer, and welcoming and
	appropriating it (Acts 2:41). 
	Christ—as promised. 
	Jesus—as manifested
	[BENGEL]. 
	came into the world—which
	was full of sin (John 1:29;
	Romans 5:12; 1 John 2:2).
	This implies His pre-existence. 1 John 2:2- :, Greek, "the true Light that, coming into the
	world, lighteth every man." 
	to save sinners—even
	notable sinners like Saul of Tarsus. His instance was without a rival
	since the ascension, in point of the greatness of the sin and the
	greatness of the mercy: that the consenter to Stephen, the
	proto-martyr's death, should be the successor of the same! 
	I am—not merely, "I
	was chief" (1 Corinthians 15:9;
	Ephesians 3:8; compare Ephesians 3:8- :). To each believer his own sins must always appear, as long
	as he lives, greater than those of others, which he never can know as
	he can know his own. 
	chief—the same Greek
	as in 1 Timothy 1:16, "first,"
	which alludes to this 1 Timothy 1:16- :, Translate in both verses, "foremost." Well might
	he infer where there was mercy for him, there is mercy for all
	who will come to Christ (Matthew 18:11;
	Luke 19:10).
