<p><b>15. faithful</b>—worthy of credit,
	because "God" who says it "is faithful" to His
	word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:9">1 Corinthians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:24">1 Thessalonians 5:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:3">2 Thessalonians 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:5">Revelation 21:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:6">Revelation 22:6</span>). This seems to have
	become an axiomatic <i>saying</i> among Christians the phrase,
	"faithful saying," is peculiar to the Pastoral Epistles
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11">1 Timothy 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:9">1 Timothy 4:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:8">Titus 3:8</span>). Translate as <i>Greek,</i>
	"Faithful is the saying." 
	</p>
<p><b>all</b>—all possible; full;
	to be received by all, and with all the faculties of the soul, mind,
	and heart. Paul, unlike the false teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:8- :">Titus 3:8- :</span>), <i>understands what he is saying, and whereof he affirms;</i>
	and by his simplicity of style and subject, setting forth the grand
	fundamental truth of salvation through Christ, confutes the false
	teachers' abstruse and unpractical speculations (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:18-28">1 Corinthians 1:18-28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:1">Titus 2:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>acceptation</b>—<i>reception</i>
	(as of a boon) into the heart, as well as the understanding, with all
	gladness; this is faith acting on the Gospel offer, and welcoming and
	appropriating it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:41">Acts 2:41</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Christ</b>—as promised. 
	</p>
<p><b>Jesus</b>—as manifested
	[BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>came into the world</b>—which
	was full of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>).
	This implies His pre-existence. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2- :">1 John 2:2- :</span>, <i>Greek,</i> "the true Light that, <i>coming into the
	world,</i> lighteth every man." 
	</p>
<p><b>to save sinners</b>—even
	notable sinners like Saul of Tarsus. His instance was without a rival
	since the ascension, in point of the greatness of the sin and the
	greatness of the mercy: that the consenter to Stephen, the
	proto-martyr's death, should be the successor of the same! 
	</p>
<p><b>I am</b>—not merely, "I
	was chief" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8- :">Ephesians 3:8- :</span>). To each believer his own sins must always appear, as long
	as he lives, greater than those of others, which he never can know as
	he can know his own. 
	</p>
<p><b>chief</b>—the same <i>Greek</i>
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:16">1 Timothy 1:16</span>, "first,"
	which alludes to this <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:16- :">1 Timothy 1:16- :</span>, Translate in both verses, "foremost." Well might
	he infer where there was mercy for <i>him,</i> there is mercy for all
	who will come to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:11">Matthew 18:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:10">Luke 19:10</span>).</p>
