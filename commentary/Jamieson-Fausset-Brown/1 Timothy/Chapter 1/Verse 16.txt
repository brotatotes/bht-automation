<p><b>16. Howbeit</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"But"; contrasting his own conscious sinfulness with God's
	gracious visitation of him in mercy. 
	</p>
<p><b>for this cause</b>—for this
	very purpose. 
	</p>
<p><b>that in me</b>—in my case. 
	</p>
<p><b>first</b>—"foremost."
	As I was "foremost" (<i>Greek</i> for <i>chief,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) in sin, so God has made me the "foremost" sample
	of <i>mercy.</i>
</p>

	(the middle <i>Greek,</i> voice), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>all long-suffering</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the whole (of His) long-suffering," namely, in bearing so
	long with me while I was a persecutor. 
	</p>
<p><b>a pattern</b>—a sample
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:6">1 Corinthians 10:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:11">1 Corinthians 10:11</span>)
	to assure the greatest sinners of the certainty that they shall not
	be rejected in coming to Christ, since even Saul found mercy. So
	David made his own case of pardon, notwithstanding the greatness of
	his sin, a sample to encourage other sinners to seek pardon (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:5">Psalms 32:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:6">Psalms 32:6</span>). The <i>Greek</i> for
	"pattern" is sometimes used for a "sketch" or
	outline—the filling up to take place in each man's own case.

<p><b>believe on him</b>—Belief
	rests ON Him as the only
	foundation on which faith relies. 
	</p>
<p><b>to life everlasting</b>—the
	ultimate aim which faith always keeps in view (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:6- :">Psalms 32:6- :</span>).</p>
