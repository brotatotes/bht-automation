17. A suitable conclusion to the
	beautifully simple enunciation of the Gospel, of which his own
	history is a living sample or pattern. It is from the experimental
	sense of grace that the doxology flows [BENGEL].
	the King, eternal—literally,
	"King of the (eternal) ages." The Septuagint
	translates Exodus 15:18, "The
	Lord shall reign for ages and beyond them." Exodus 15:18- :, Margin, "Thy kingdom is an everlasting
	kingdom," literally, "a kingdom of all ages." The
	"life everlasting" (Exodus 15:18- :) suggested here "the King eternal," or
	everlasting. It answers also to "for ever and ever"
	at the close, literally, "to the ages of the ages" (the
	countless succession of ages made up of ages). 
	immortal—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "incorruptible." The Vulgate,
	however, and one very old manuscript read as English Version
	(Romans 1:23). 
	invisible— (1 Timothy 6:16;
	Exodus 33:20; John 1:18;
	Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 11:27).
	the only wise God—The
	oldest manuscripts omit "wise," which probably crept in
	from Romans 16:27, where it is
	more appropriate to the context than here (compare Romans 16:27- :). "The only Potentate" (1 Timothy 6:15;
	Psalms 86:10; John 5:44).
	for ever, &c.—See
	note, above. The thought of eternity (terrible as it is to
	unbelievers) is delightful to those assured of grace (John 5:44- :) [BENGEL].
