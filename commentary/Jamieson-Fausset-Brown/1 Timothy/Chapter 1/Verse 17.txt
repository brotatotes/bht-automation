<p><b>17.</b> A suitable conclusion to the
	beautifully simple enunciation of the Gospel, of which his own
	history is a living sample or pattern. It is from the experimental
	sense of grace that the doxology flows [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>the King, eternal</b>—literally,
	"King of the (eternal) ages." The <i>Septuagint</i>
	translates <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:18">Exodus 15:18</span>, "The
	Lord shall reign <i>for ages and beyond them.</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:18- :">Exodus 15:18- :</span>, <i>Margin,</i> "Thy kingdom is an everlasting
	kingdom," literally, "a kingdom of all ages." The
	"life everlasting" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+15:18- :">Exodus 15:18- :</span>) suggested here "the King <i>eternal,</i>" or
	<i>everlasting.</i> It answers also to "for ever and ever"
	at the close, literally, "to the ages of the ages" (the
	countless succession of ages made up of ages). 
	</p>
<p><b>immortal</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "incorruptible." The <i>Vulgate,</i>
	however, and one very old manuscript read as <i>English Version</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:23">Romans 1:23</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>invisible</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:16">1 Timothy 6:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:20">Exodus 33:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:27">Hebrews 11:27</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>the only wise God</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts omit "wise," which probably crept in
	from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27">Romans 16:27</span>, where it is
	more appropriate to the context than here (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:27- :">Romans 16:27- :</span>). "The only Potentate" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:15">1 Timothy 6:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+86:10">Psalms 86:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:44">John 5:44</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>for ever,</b> &amp;c.—See
	note, above. The thought of eternity (terrible as it is to
	unbelievers) is delightful to those assured of grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:44- :">John 5:44- :</span>) [BENGEL].</p>
