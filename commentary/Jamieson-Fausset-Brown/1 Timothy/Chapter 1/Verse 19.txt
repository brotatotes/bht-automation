19. Holding—Keeping hold of
	"faith" and "good conscience" ( :-); not "putting the latter away" as "some."
	Faith is like a very precious liquor; a good conscience
	is the clean, pure glass that contains it [BENGEL].
	The loss of good conscience entails the shipwreck of faith.
	Consciousness of sin (unrepented of and forgiven) kills the germ of
	faith in man [WIESINGER]. 
	which—Greek
	singular, namely, "good conscience," not "faith"
	also; however, the result of putting away good conscience is,
	one loses faith also. 
	put away—a wilful act.
	They thrust it from them as a troublesome monitor. It reluctantly
	withdraws, extruded by force, when its owner is tired of its
	importunity, and is resolved to retain his sin at the cost of losing
	it. One cannot be on friendly terms with it and with sin at one and
	the same time. 
	made shipwreck—"with
	respect to THE faith."
	Faith is the vessel in which they had professedly embarked, of
	which "good conscience" is the anchor. The ancient Church
	often used this image, comparing the course of faith to navigation.
	The Greek does not imply that one having once had faith
	makes shipwreck of it, but that they who put away good conscience
	"make shipwreck with respect to THE
	faith."
