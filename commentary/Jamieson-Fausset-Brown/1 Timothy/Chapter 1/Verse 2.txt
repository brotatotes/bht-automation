2. my own son—literally, "a
	genuine son" (compare Acts 16:1;
	1 Corinthians 4:14-17). See
	1 Corinthians 4:14-46.4.17- :
mercy—added here, in
	addressing Timothy, to the ordinary salutation, "Grace unto you
	(Romans 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:3,
	c.), and peace." In Galatians 6:16,
	"peace and mercy" occur. There are many similarities
	of style between the Epistle to the Galatians and the Pastoral
	Epistles (see Galatians 6:16- :);
	perhaps owing to his there, as here, having, as a leading object in
	writing, the correction of false teachers, especially as to the right
	and wrong use of the law (Galatians 6:16- :). If the earlier date be assigned to First Timothy, it will
	fall not long after, or before (according as the Epistle to the
	Galatians was written at Ephesus or at Corinth) the writing of the
	Epistle to the Galatians, which also would account for some
	similarity of style. "Mercy" is grace of a more tender
	kind, exercised towards the miserable, the experience of which
	in one's own case especially fits for the Gospel MINISTRY.
	Compare as to Paul himself (1 Timothy 1:14;
	1 Timothy 1:16; 1 Corinthians 7:25;
	2 Corinthians 4:1; Hebrews 2:17)
	[BENGEL]. He did not use
	"mercy" as to the churches, because "mercy" in
	all its fulness already existed towards them; but in the case of an
	individual minister, fresh measures of it were continually needed.
	"Grace" has reference to the sins of men; "mercy"
	to their misery. God extends His grace to men as they
	are guilty; His "mercy" to them as they are miserable
	[TRENCH]. 
	Jesus Christ—The oldest
	manuscripts read the order, "Christ Jesus." In the Pastoral
	Epistles "Christ" is often put before "Jesus," to
	give prominence to the fact that the Messianic promises of the
	Old Testament, well known to Timothy (Hebrews 2:17- :), were fulfilled in Jesus.
