<p><b>2. my own son</b>—literally, "a

<p><b>mercy</b>—added here, in

	c.), and peace." In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16">Galatians 6:16</span>,
	"peace and <i>mercy</i>" occur. There are many similarities
	of style between the Epistle to the Galatians and the Pastoral
	Epistles (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16- :">Galatians 6:16- :</span>);
	perhaps owing to his there, as here, having, as a leading object in
	writing, the correction of false teachers, especially as to the right
	and wrong use of the <i>law</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16- :">Galatians 6:16- :</span>). If the earlier date be assigned to First Timothy, it will
	fall not long after, or before (according as the Epistle to the
	Galatians was written at Ephesus or at Corinth) the writing of the
	Epistle to the Galatians, which also would account for some
	similarity of style. "Mercy" is grace of a more tender
	kind, exercised towards the <i>miserable,</i> the experience of which
	in one's own case especially fits for the Gospel MINISTRY.
	Compare as to Paul himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:14">1 Timothy 1:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:16">1 Timothy 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:25">1 Corinthians 7:25</span>;

	[BENGEL]. He did not use
	"mercy" as to the churches, because "mercy" in
	all its fulness already existed towards them; but in the case of an
	individual minister, fresh measures of it were continually needed.
	"Grace" has reference to the <i>sins</i> of men; "mercy"
	to their <i>misery.</i> God extends His <i>grace</i> to men as they
	are guilty; His "mercy" to them as they are miserable

<p><b>Jesus Christ</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read the order, "Christ Jesus." In the Pastoral
	Epistles "Christ" is often put before "Jesus," to
	give prominence to the fact that the <i>Messianic</i> promises of the
	Old Testament, well known to Timothy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17- :">Hebrews 2:17- :</span>), were fulfilled in Jesus.</p>
