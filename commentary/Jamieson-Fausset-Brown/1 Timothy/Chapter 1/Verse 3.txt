<p><b>3.</b> Timothy's superintendence of
	the Church at Ephesus was as <i>locum tenens</i> for the apostle, and
	so was temporary. Thus, the office of superintending overseer, needed
	for a time at Ephesus or Crete, in the absence of the presiding
	apostle, subsequently became a permanent institution on the removal,
	by death, of the apostles who heretofore superintended the churches.
	The first title of these overseers seems to have been "angels"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>As I besought thee to abide
	still</b>—He meant to have added, "<i>so</i> I still beseech
	thee," but does not complete the sentence until he does so
	<i>virtually,</i> not formally, at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20- :">Revelation 1:20- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>at Ephesus</b>—Paul, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20- :">Revelation 1:20- :</span>, declared to the Ephesian elders, "I <i>know</i> that
	ye all shall see my face no more." If, then, as the balance of
	arguments seems to favor (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20- :">Revelation 1:20- :</span>),
	this Epistle was written subsequently to Paul's first imprisonment,
	the apparent discrepancy between his prophecy and the event may be
	reconciled by considering that the terms of the former were not that
	<i>he</i> should never visit <i>Ephesus</i> again (which this verse
	implies he did), but that <i>they all</i> should "see his face
	no more." I cannot think with BIRKS,
	that this verse is compatible with his theory, that Paul did not
	actually visit Ephesus, though in its immediate neighborhood (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:14">1 Timothy 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:13">1 Timothy 4:13</span>).
	The corresponding conjunction to "as" is not given, the
	sentence not being completed till it is virtually so at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:13- :">1 Timothy 4:13- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>I besought</b>—a mild word,
	instead of authoritative command, to Timothy, as a fellow helper. 
	</p>
<p><b>some</b>—The indefinite
	pronoun is <i>slightly</i> contemptuous as to them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:12">Galatians 2:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:4">Judges 1:4</span>), [ELLICOTT].
	</p>
<p><b>teach no other doctrine</b>—than
	what I have taught (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:4- :">Judges 1:4- :</span>). His prophetic bodings some years before (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:29">Acts 20:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:30">Acts 20:30</span>) were now being
	realized (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:3">1 Timothy 6:3</span>).</p>
