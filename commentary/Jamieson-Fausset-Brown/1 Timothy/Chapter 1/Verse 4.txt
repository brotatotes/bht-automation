<p><b>4. fables</b>—legends about the
	origin and propagation of angels, such as the false teachers taught
	at Colosse (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18-23">Colossians 2:18-23</span>).
	"Jewish fables" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18-51.2.23- :">Colossians 2:18-51.2.23- :</span>). "Profane, and old wives' fables" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7">1 Timothy 4:7</span>;

<p><b>genealogies</b>—not merely
	such civil genealogies as were common among the Jews, whereby they
	traced their descent from the patriarchs, to which Paul would not
	object, and which he would not as here class with "fables,"
	but Gnostic genealogies of spirits and aeons, as they called them,
	"Lists of Gnostic emanations" [ALFORD].
	So TERTULLIAN [<i>Against
	Valentinian,</i> c. 3], and IRENÆUS
	[<i>Preface</i>]. The Judaizers here alluded to, while maintaining
	the perpetual obligation of the Mosaic law, joined with it a
	theosophic ascetic tendency, pretending to see in it mysteries deeper
	than others could see. The <i>seeds, not the full-grown</i>
	Gnosticism of the post-apostolic age, then existed. This formed the
	transition stage between Judaism and Gnosticism. "Endless"
	refers to the tedious unprofitableness of their lengthy genealogies
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:9">Titus 3:9</span>). Paul opposes
	to their "aeons," the "King of <i>the aeons</i> (so
	the <i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17">1 Timothy 1:17</span>),
	whom be glory throughout the aeons of aeons." The <i>word</i>
	"aeons" was probably not used in the technical sense of the
	latter Gnostics as yet; but "the only wise God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17- :">1 Timothy 1:17- :</span>), by anticipation, confutes the subsequently adopted notions
	in the Gnostics' own phraseology. 
	</p>
<p><b>questions</b>—of mere
	speculation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+25:20">Acts 25:20</span>), not
	practical; generating merely curious discussions. "Questions and
	strifes of words" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:4">1 Timothy 6:4</span>):
	"to no profit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:4- :">1 Timothy 6:4- :</span>); "gendering strifes" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:4- :">1 Timothy 6:4- :</span>). "Vain jangling" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:6">1 Timothy 1:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:7">1 Timothy 1:7</span>) of would-be "teachers
	of the law." 
	</p>
<p><b>godly edifying</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "<i>the dispensation</i> of God,"
	the Gospel dispensation of God towards man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:7- :">1 Timothy 1:7- :</span>), "which is (has its element) in faith." CONYBEARE
	translates, "The exercising of <i>the stewardship</i> of God"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:17">1 Corinthians 9:17</span>). He infers that the
	false teachers in Ephesus were presbyters, which accords with the
	prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:30">Acts 20:30</span>. However,
	the oldest <i>Latin</i> versions, and IRENÆUS
	and HILARY, support
	<i>English Version</i> reading. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:30- :">Acts 20:30- :</span>, "faith unfeigned."</p>
