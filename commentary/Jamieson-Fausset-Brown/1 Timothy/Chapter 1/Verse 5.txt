<p><b>5. But</b>—in contrast to the
	doctrine of the false teachers. 
	</p>
<p><b>the end</b>—the aim. 
	</p>
<p><b>the commandment</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"of the charge" which you ought to urge on your flock.
	Referring to the same <i>Greek</i> word as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>; here, however, in a
	larger sense, as including <i>the Gospel</i> "<i>dispensation</i>
	of God" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:11">1 Timothy 1:11</span>), which was the sum
	and substance of the "charge" committed to Timothy
	wherewith he should "charge" his flock. 
	</p>
<p><b>charity</b>—LOVE; the sum
	and end of the law and of the Gospel alike, and that wherein the
	Gospel is the fulfilment of the spirit of the law in its every
	essential jot and tittle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:11- :">1 Timothy 1:11- :</span>). The foundation is <i>faith</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:11- :">1 Timothy 1:11- :</span>), the "end" is <i>love</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:14">1 Timothy 1:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:15">Titus 3:15</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>out of</b>—springing as
	from a fountain. 
	</p>
<p><b>pure heart</b>—a heart
	purified by faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:9">Acts 15:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22">2 Timothy 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:15">Titus 1:15</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>good conscience</b>—a
	conscience cleared from guilt by the effect of sound faith in Christ
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:3">2 Timothy 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>).
	Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:2">1 Timothy 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:15">Titus 1:15</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:1">Acts 23:1</span>. John uses
	"heart," where Paul would use "conscience." In
	Paul the understanding is the seat of <i>conscience;</i> the <i>heart</i>
	is the seat of <i>love</i> [BENGEL].
	A good conscience is joined with sound faith; a bad conscience with
	unsoundness in the faith (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:1- :">Acts 23:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>faith unfeigned</b>—not a
	hypocritical, dead, and unfruitful faith, but faith working by love
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6">Galatians 5:6</span>). The false teachers
	drew men off from such a loving, working, real faith, to profitless,
	speculative "questions" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6- :">Galatians 5:6- :</span>) and jangling (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:6">1 Timothy 1:6</span>).</p>
