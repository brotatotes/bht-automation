	The Judaizers here meant seem to be distinct from those impugned in
	the Epistles to the Galatians and Romans, who made the works of the
	law necessary to justification in opposition to Gospel grace. The
	Judaizers here meant corrupted the law with "fables," which
	they pretended to found on it, subversive of morals as well as of
	truth. Their error was not in maintaining the <i>obligation</i> of
	the law, but in <i>abusing</i> it by fabulous and immoral
	interpretations of, and additions to, it.
