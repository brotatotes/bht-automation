<p><b>1. therefore</b>—taking up again
	the general subject of the Epistle in continuation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "What I have therefore to say to thee by way of a
	<i>charge</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>),
	is," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>that, first of all . . . be
	made</b>—ALFORD takes
	it, "I <i>exhort first of all to make.</i>" "First of
	all," doubtless, is to be connected with "I exhort"
	what I <i>begin with</i> (for special reasons), is . . . As the
	destruction of Jerusalem drew near, the Jews (including those at
	Ephesus) were seized with the dream of freedom from every yoke; and
	so virtually "'blasphemed" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18- :">1 Timothy 1:18- :</span>) God's name by "speaking evil of dignities"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:1">1 Timothy 6:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:8">Judges 1:8</span>). Hence Paul, in
	opposition, gives prominence to the injunction that prayer be made
	for <i>all</i> men, especially for <i>magistrates</i> and <i>kings</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:1-3">Titus 3:1-3</span>) [OLSHAUSEN].
	Some professing Christians looked down on all not Christians, as
	doomed to perdition; but Paul says <i>all men</i> are to be prayed
	for, as Christ died for all (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:1-56.3.3- :">Titus 3:1-56.3.3- :</span>).

<p><b>supplications</b>—a term
	implying the suppliant's <i>sense of need,</i> and of <i>his own
	insufficiency.</i>
</p>
<p><b>prayers</b>—implying
	devotion. 
	</p>
<p><b>intercessions</b>—properly
	the <i>coming near to God</i> with childlike confidence, generally <i>in
	behalf of another.</i> The accumulation of terms implies prayer in
	its every form and aspect, according to all the relations implied in
	it.</p>
