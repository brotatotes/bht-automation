<p><b>10. professing</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"promising": engaging to follow. 
	</p>
<p><b>with good works</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> preposition is not the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; "by means of," or "<i>through</i> good
	works." Their adorning is to be effected <i>by means of</i> good
	works: not that they are to be clothed <i>in,</i> or <i>with,</i>
	them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:10">Ephesians 2:10</span>). Works, not
	words in public, is their province (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:8">1 Timothy 2:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11">1 Timothy 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:1">1 Peter 3:1</span>). <i>Works</i> are often
	mentioned in the Pastoral Epistles in order to oppose the loose
	living, combined with the loose doctrine, of the false teachers. The
	discharge of everyday duties is honored with the designation, "good
	works."</p>
