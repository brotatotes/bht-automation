<p><b>14. Adam was not deceived</b>—as
	Eve was <i>deceived</i> by the serpent; but was <i>persuaded</i> by
	his wife. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:17">Genesis 3:17</span>, "hearkened
	unto . . . voice of . . . wife." But in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:17- :">Genesis 3:17- :</span>, Eve says, "The <i>serpent beguiled</i> me." Being
	more easily deceived, she more easily deceives [BENGEL],
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3">2 Corinthians 11:3</span>). Last in being, she
	was first in sin—indeed, she alone was <i>deceived.</i> The subtle
	serpent knew that she was "the weaker vessel" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3- :">2 Corinthians 11:3- :</span>). He therefore tempted her, not Adam. She yielded to the
	temptations of sense and the <i>deceits of Satan;</i> he, to <i>conjugal</i>
	love. Hence, in the order of God's judicial sentence, the serpent,
	the prime offender, stands first; the woman, who was deceived, next;
	and the man, persuaded by his wife, last (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:3- :">2 Corinthians 11:3- :</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>, Adam
	is represented as the first transgressor; but there no reference is
	made to Eve, and Adam is regarded as the head of the sinning race.
	Hence, as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11">1 Timothy 2:11</span>, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11- :">1 Timothy 2:11- :</span>, woman's "subjection" is represented as the
	consequence of her being deceived. 
	</p>
<p><b>being deceived</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read the compound <i>Greek</i> verb for the
	simple, "Having been <i>seduced by deceit</i>": implying
	how <i>completely</i> Satan <i>succeeded in deceiving</i> her. 
	</p>
<p><b>was in the
	transgression</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "<i>came to be</i> in the
	transgression": became involved in the existing state of
	transgression, literally, "the going beyond a command";
	breach of a positive precept (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11- :">1 Timothy 2:11- :</span>).</p>
