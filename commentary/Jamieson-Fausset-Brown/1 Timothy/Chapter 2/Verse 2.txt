<p><b>2. For kings</b>—an effectual
	confutation of the adversaries who accused the Christians of
	disaffection to the ruling powers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:7">Acts 17:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1-7">Romans 13:1-7</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>all . . . in
	authority</b>—literally, "in eminence"; in stations of
	eminence. The "quiet" of Christians was often more
	dependent on subordinate rulers, than on the supreme king; hence,
	"<i>all</i> . . . in authority" are to be prayed for. 
	</p>
<p><b>that we may lead</b>—that
	we may be blessed with such good government as to lead . . . ; or
	rather, as <i>Greek,</i> "to <i>pass</i>" or "spend."
	The prayers of Christians for the government bring down from heaven
	peace and order in a state. 
	</p>
<p><b>quiet</b>—not troubled <i>from
	without.</i>
</p>
<p><b>peaceable</b>—"tranquil";
	not troubled <i>from within</i> [OLSHAUSEN].
	"He is <i>peaceable</i> (<i>Greek</i>) who makes no disturbance;
	he is <i>quiet</i> (<i>Greek</i>) who is himself free from
	disturbance" [TITTMANN].
	</p>
<p><b>in all godliness</b>—"in
	all (possible . . . requisite) <i>piety</i>" [ALFORD].
	A distinct <i>Greek</i> word, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:1-45.13.7- :">Romans 13:1-45.13.7- :</span>, expresses "godliness." 
	</p>
<p><b>honesty</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"gravity" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:2">Titus 2:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:7">Titus 2:7</span>), "decorum," or
	propriety of conduct. As "piety" is in relation to <i>God,</i>
	"gravity" is propriety of behavior among men. In the Old
	Testament the Jews were commanded to pray for their heathen rulers
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+6:10">Ezra 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+29:7">Jeremiah 29:7</span>).
	The Jews, by Augustus' order, offered a lamb daily for the Roman
	emperor, till near the destruction of Jerusalem. The Jewish Zealots,
	instigated by Eleazar, caused this custom to cease [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Wars of the Jews,</i> 2.17], whence the war originated, according
	to JOSEPHUS.</p>
