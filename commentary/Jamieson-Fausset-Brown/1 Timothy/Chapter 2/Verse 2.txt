2. For kings—an effectual
	confutation of the adversaries who accused the Christians of
	disaffection to the ruling powers (Acts 17:7;
	Romans 13:1-7). 
	all . . . in
	authority—literally, "in eminence"; in stations of
	eminence. The "quiet" of Christians was often more
	dependent on subordinate rulers, than on the supreme king; hence,
	"all . . . in authority" are to be prayed for. 
	that we may lead—that
	we may be blessed with such good government as to lead . . . ; or
	rather, as Greek, "to pass" or "spend."
	The prayers of Christians for the government bring down from heaven
	peace and order in a state. 
	quiet—not troubled from
	without.
peaceable—"tranquil";
	not troubled from within [OLSHAUSEN].
	"He is peaceable (Greek) who makes no disturbance;
	he is quiet (Greek) who is himself free from
	disturbance" [TITTMANN].
	in all godliness—"in
	all (possible . . . requisite) piety" [ALFORD].
	A distinct Greek word, Romans 13:1-45.13.7- :, expresses "godliness." 
	honesty—Greek,
	"gravity" (Titus 2:2;
	Titus 2:7), "decorum," or
	propriety of conduct. As "piety" is in relation to God,
	"gravity" is propriety of behavior among men. In the Old
	Testament the Jews were commanded to pray for their heathen rulers
	(Ezra 6:10; Jeremiah 29:7).
	The Jews, by Augustus' order, offered a lamb daily for the Roman
	emperor, till near the destruction of Jerusalem. The Jewish Zealots,
	instigated by Eleazar, caused this custom to cease [JOSEPHUS,
	Wars of the Jews, 2.17], whence the war originated, according
	to JOSEPHUS.
