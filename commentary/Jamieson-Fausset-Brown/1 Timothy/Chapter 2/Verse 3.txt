3. this—praying for all men. 
	in the sight of God—not
	merely before men, as if it were their favor that we sought
	(2 Corinthians 8:21). 
	our Saviour—a title
	appropriate to the matter in hand. He who is "our Saviour"
	is willing that all should be saved (1 Timothy 2:4;
	Romans 5:18); therefore we should
	meet the will of God in behalf of others, by praying for the
	salvation of all men. More would be converted if we would pray more.
	He has actually saved us who believe, being "our
	Saviour." He is willing that all should be saved, even those who
	do not as yet believe, if they will believe (compare 1 Timothy 4:10;
	Titus 2:11).
