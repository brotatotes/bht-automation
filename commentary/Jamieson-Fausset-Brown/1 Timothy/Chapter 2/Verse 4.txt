<p><b>4.</b> "Imitate God."
	Since He wishes that all should be saved, do you also wish it; and if
	you wish it, pray for it. For prayer is the instrument of effecting
	such things [CHRYSOSTOM].
	Paul does not say, "He wishes <i>to save</i> all"; for then
	he <i>would</i> have saved all in matter of fact; but "will have
	all men to be saved," implies the possibility of man's accepting
	it (through God's prevenient grace) or rejecting it (through man's
	own perversity). Our prayers ought to include <i>all, as</i> God's
	grace included <i>all.</i>

<p><b>to come</b>—They are not
	forced. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto the knowledge</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the <i>full</i> knowledge" or "recognition" (See
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the truth</b>—the saving
	truth as it is in, and by, Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>;
