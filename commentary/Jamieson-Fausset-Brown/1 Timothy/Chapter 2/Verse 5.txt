<p><b>5. For there is one God</b>—God's
	<i>unity</i> in essence and purpose is a proof of His comprehending
	all His human children alike (created in His image) in His offer of
	grace (compare the same argument from His unity, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:30">Romans 3:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:20">Galatians 3:20</span>); therefore all are to
	be prayed for. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:5">1 Timothy 2:5</span>
	is proved from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:5">1 Timothy 2:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:1">1 Timothy 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>.
	The <i>one God</i> is common to all (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+45:22">Isaiah 45:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:26">Acts 17:26</span>). The one Mediator is
	mediator between God and all men potentially (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:29">Romans 3:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:5">Ephesians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:6">Ephesians 4:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15">Hebrews 9:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:24">Hebrews 12:24</span>). They who have not
	this one God by one Mediator, have none: literally, a "go-between."
	The <i>Greek</i> order is not "<i>and</i> one mediator,"
	but "one mediator <i>also</i> between . . . While God will have
	all men to be saved by knowing God and the Mediator, there is a
	legitimate, holy order in the exercise of that will wherewith men
	ought to receive it. All mankind constitute, as it were, ONE
	MAN before God [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>the man</b>—rather "man,"
	absolutely and genetically: not a mere <i>individual man:</i> the
	Second Head of humanity, representing and embodying in Himself <i>the
	whole human race and nature.</i> There is no "the" in the
	<i>Greek.</i> This epithet is thus the strongest corroboration of his
	argument, namely, that Christ's mediation affects the whole race,
	since there is but the one Mediator, designed as the Representative
	Man for all men alike (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:15">Romans 5:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:14">Colossians 2:14</span>). His being "man"
	was necessary to His being a Mediator, sympathizing with us through
	experimental knowledge of our nature (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:4">Isaiah 50:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>).
	Even in nature, almost all blessings are conveyed to us from God, not
	immediately, but through the mediation of various agents. The
	effectual intercession of Moses for Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:13-19">Numbers 14:13-19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+9:1-29">Deuteronomy 9:1-29</span>); of Abraham for
	Abimelech (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+20:7">Genesis 20:7</span>); of Job for
	his friends (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+42:10">Job 42:10</span>), the
	mediation being PRESCRIBED
	<i>by God</i> while declaring His purposes of forgiveness: all
	prefigure the grand mediation for all by the one Mediator. On the
	other hand, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span> asserts
	that He was also <i>God.</i></p>
