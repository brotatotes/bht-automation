5. For there is one God—God's
	unity in essence and purpose is a proof of His comprehending
	all His human children alike (created in His image) in His offer of
	grace (compare the same argument from His unity, Romans 3:30;
	Galatians 3:20); therefore all are to
	be prayed for. 1 Timothy 2:4; 1 Timothy 2:5
	is proved from 1 Timothy 2:4; 1 Timothy 2:5;
	1 Timothy 2:1; 1 Timothy 2:4.
	The one God is common to all (Isaiah 45:22;
	Acts 17:26). The one Mediator is
	mediator between God and all men potentially (Romans 3:29;
	Ephesians 4:5; Ephesians 4:6;
	Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 9:15;
	Hebrews 12:24). They who have not
	this one God by one Mediator, have none: literally, a "go-between."
	The Greek order is not "and one mediator,"
	but "one mediator also between . . . While God will have
	all men to be saved by knowing God and the Mediator, there is a
	legitimate, holy order in the exercise of that will wherewith men
	ought to receive it. All mankind constitute, as it were, ONE
	MAN before God [BENGEL].
	the man—rather "man,"
	absolutely and genetically: not a mere individual man: the
	Second Head of humanity, representing and embodying in Himself the
	whole human race and nature. There is no "the" in the
	Greek. This epithet is thus the strongest corroboration of his
	argument, namely, that Christ's mediation affects the whole race,
	since there is but the one Mediator, designed as the Representative
	Man for all men alike (compare Romans 5:15;
	1 Corinthians 8:6; 2 Corinthians 5:19;
	Colossians 2:14). His being "man"
	was necessary to His being a Mediator, sympathizing with us through
	experimental knowledge of our nature (Isaiah 50:4;
	Hebrews 2:14; Hebrews 4:15).
	Even in nature, almost all blessings are conveyed to us from God, not
	immediately, but through the mediation of various agents. The
	effectual intercession of Moses for Israel (Numbers 14:13-19;
	Deuteronomy 9:1-29); of Abraham for
	Abimelech (Genesis 20:7); of Job for
	his friends (Job 42:10), the
	mediation being PRESCRIBED
	by God while declaring His purposes of forgiveness: all
	prefigure the grand mediation for all by the one Mediator. On the
	other hand, 1 Timothy 3:16 asserts
	that He was also God.
