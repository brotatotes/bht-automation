	ransom—properly of a
	captive slave. Man was the captive slave of Satan, sold under sin. He
	was unable to ransom himself, because absolute obedience is due to
	God, and therefore no act of ours can satisfy for the least offense.
	Leviticus 25:48 allowed one sold
	captive to be redeemed by one of his brethren. The Son of God,
	therefore, became man in order that, being made like unto us in all
	things, sin only excepted, as our elder brother He should redeem us
	(Matthew 20:28; Ephesians 1:7;
	1 Peter 1:18; 1 Peter 1:19).
	The Greek implies not merely ransom, but a substituted
	or equivalent ransom: the Greek preposition, "anti,"
	implying reciprocity and vicarious substitution. 
	for all—Greek,
	"in behalf of all": not merely for a privileged few;
	compare 1 Timothy 2:1: the argument
	for praying in behalf of all is given here. 
	to be testified—Greek,
	"the testimony (that which was to be testified of, 1 Timothy 2:1- :) in its own due times," or seasons, that is,
	in the times appointed by God for its being testified of (1 Timothy 6:15;
	Titus 1:3). The oneness of the
	Mediator, involving the universality of redemption (which faith,
	however, alone appropriates), was the great subject of Christian
	testimony [ALFORD]
	(1 Corinthians 1:6; 1 Corinthians 2:1;
	2 Thessalonians 1:10).
