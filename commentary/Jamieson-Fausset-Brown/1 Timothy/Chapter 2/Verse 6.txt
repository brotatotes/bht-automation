<p><b>ransom</b>—properly of a
	captive slave. Man was the captive slave of Satan, sold under sin. He
	was unable to ransom himself, because absolute obedience is due to
	God, and therefore no act of ours can satisfy for the least offense.
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+25:48">Leviticus 25:48</span> allowed one sold
	captive to be redeemed by one of his brethren. The Son of God,
	therefore, became man in order that, being made like unto us in all
	things, sin only excepted, as our elder brother He should redeem us
