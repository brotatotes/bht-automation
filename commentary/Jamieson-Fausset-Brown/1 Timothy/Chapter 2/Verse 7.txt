<p><b>7. Whereunto</b>—For the giving of
	which testimony. 
	</p>
<p><b>I am ordained</b>—literally,
	"I was set": the same <i>Greek,</i> as "putting me,"
	c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>preacher</b>—literally,
	"herald" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:21">1 Corinthians 1:21</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:11">1 Corinthians 15:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:11">2 Timothy 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:3">Titus 1:3</span>).
	He recurs to himself, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:3- :">Titus 1:3- :</span>, in <i>himself</i> a living <i>pattern</i> or announcement
	of the Gospel, so here "a herald and teacher of (it to) the
	Gentiles" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1-12">Ephesians 3:1-12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>). The universality of
	his commission is an appropriate assertion here, where he is arguing
	to prove that prayers are to be made "for <i>all</i> men"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:1">1 Timothy 2:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>I speak the truth . . . and
	lie not</b>—a strong asseveration of his universal commission,
	characteristic of the ardor of the apostle, exposed to frequent
	conflict (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:1">Romans 11:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13">2 Corinthians 11:13</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>in faith and verity</b>—rather,
	"in <i>the</i> faith and <i>the</i> truth." The sphere in
	which his ministry was appointed to be exercised was <i>the faith</i>
	and <i>the truth</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>):
	<i>the Gospel truth,</i> the subject matter of <i>the faith</i>
