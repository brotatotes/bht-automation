8. I will—The active
	wish, or desire, is meant. 
	that men—rather as
	Greek, "that the men," as distinguished from
	"the women," to whom he has something different to say from
	what he said to the men (1 Timothy 2:9-12;
	1 Corinthians 11:14; 1 Corinthians 11:15;
	1 Corinthians 14:34; 1 Corinthians 14:35).
	The emphasis, however, is not on this, but on the precept of
	praying, resumed from 1 Corinthians 14:35- :. 
	everywhere—Greek,
	"in every place," namely, of public prayer. Fulfilling 1 Corinthians 14:35- :, "In every place . . . from the rising of the
	sun even unto the going down of the same . . . incense shall be
	offered unto My name"; and Jesus' words, Matthew 18:20;
	John 4:21; John 4:23.
	lifting up holy hands—The
	early Christians turned up their palms towards heaven, as those
	craving help do. So also Solomon (1 Kings 8:22;
	Psalms 141:2). The Jews washed their
	hands before prayer (Psalms 26:6).
	Paul figuratively (compare Job 17:9;
	James 4:8) uses language alluding
	to this custom here: so Isaiah 1:15;
	Isaiah 1:16. The Greek for
	"holy" means hands which have committed no impiety,
	and observed every sacred duty. This (or at least the contrite
	desire to be so) is a needful qualification for effectual prayer
	(Psalms 24:3; Psalms 24:4).
	without wrath—putting
	it away (Matthew 5:23; Matthew 5:24;
	Matthew 6:15). 
	doubting—rather,
	"disputing," as the Greek is translated in Matthew 6:15- :. Such things hinder prayer (Luke 9:46;
	Romans 14:1; 1 Peter 3:7).
	BENGEL supports English
	Version (compare an instance, 2 Kings 7:2;
	Matthew 14:31; Mark 11:22-24;
	James 1:6).
