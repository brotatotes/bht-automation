<p><b>9, 10.</b> The context requires that
	we understand these directions as to women, in relation to their
	deportment <i>in public worship,</i> though the rules will hold good
	on <i>other</i> occasions <i>also.</i>
</p>
<p><b>in modest apparel</b>—"in
	seemly guise" [ELLICOTT].
	The adjective means properly. <i>orderly, decorous,</i> becoming; the
	noun in secular writings means <i>conduct, bearing.</i> But here
	"apparel." Women are apt to love fine dress; and at Ephesus
	the riches of some (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:17">1 Timothy 6:17</span>)
	would lead them to dress luxuriously. The <i>Greek</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:17- :">1 Timothy 6:17- :</span> is a more general term meaning "deportment." 
	</p>
<p><b>shamefacedness</b>—TRENCH
	spells this word according to its true derivation, "shamefastness"
	(that which is made fast by an honorable shame); as "steadfastness"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11">1 Timothy 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>sobriety</b>—"self-restraint"
	[ALFORD]. Habitual inner
	self-government [TRENCH].
	I prefer ELLICOTT'S
	translation, "sober-mindedness": the well-balanced state of
	mind arising from habitual self-restraint. 
	</p>
<p><b>with</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in." 
	</p>
<p><b>braided hair</b>—literally,
	"plaits," that is, plaited hair: probably with the "gold
	and pearls" intertwined (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12- :">1 Timothy 2:12- :</span>). Such gaud is characteristic of the spiritual harlot (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12- :">1 Timothy 2:12- :</span>).</p>
