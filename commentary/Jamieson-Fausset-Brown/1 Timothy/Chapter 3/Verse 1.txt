1. Translate as Greek,
	"Faithful is the saying." A needful preface to what
	follows: for the office of a bishop or overseer in Paul's day,
	attended as it was with hardship and often persecution, would not
	seem to the world generally a desirable and "good work." 
	desire—literally,
	"stretch one's self forward to grasp"; "aim at":
	a distinct Greek verb from that for "desireth." What
	one does voluntarily is more esteemed than what he does when asked
	(1 Corinthians 16:15). This is utterly
	distinct from ambitious desires after office in the Church. (1 Corinthians 16:15- :). 
	bishop—overseer: as yet
	identical with "presbyter" (Acts 20:17;
	Acts 20:28; Titus 1:5-7).
	good work—literally,
	"honorable work." Not the honor associated with it, but the
	work, is the prominent thought (Acts 15:38;
	Philippians 2:30; compare Philippians 2:30- :). He who aims at the office must remember the high
	qualifications needed for the due discharge of its functions.
