<p><b>1.</b> Translate as <i>Greek,</i>
	"Faithful is the saying." A needful preface to what
	follows: for the office of a bishop or overseer in Paul's day,
	attended as it was with hardship and often persecution, would not
	seem to the world generally a desirable and "good work." 
	</p>
<p><b>desire</b>—literally,
	"stretch one's self forward to grasp"; "aim at":
	a distinct <i>Greek</i> verb from that for "desireth." What
	one does voluntarily is more esteemed than what he does when asked
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>). This is utterly
	distinct from ambitious desires after office in the Church. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15- :">1 Corinthians 16:15- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>bishop</b>—overseer: as yet
	identical with "presbyter" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:17">Acts 20:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5-7">Titus 1:5-7</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>good work</b>—literally,
	"honorable work." Not the honor associated with it, but the
	<i>work,</i> is the prominent thought (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:38">Acts 15:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:30">Philippians 2:30</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:30- :">Philippians 2:30- :</span>). He who aims at the office must remember the high
	qualifications needed for the due discharge of its functions.</p>
