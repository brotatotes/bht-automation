11. their wives—rather, "the
	women," that is, the deaconesses. For there is no reason
	that special rules should be laid down as to the wives of the
	deacons, and not also as to the wives of the bishops or overseers.
	Moreover, if the wives of the deacons were meant, there seems no
	reason for the omission of "their" (not in the Greek).
	Also the Greek for "even so" (the same as for
	"likewise," 1 Timothy 3:8,
	and "in like manner," 1 Timothy 3:8- :), denotes a transition to another class of persons. Further,
	there were doubtless deaconesses at Ephesus, such as Phoeligbe was at
	Cenchrea (Romans 16:1, "servant,"
	Greek, "deaconess"), yet no mention is made of them
	in this Epistle if not here; whereas, supposing them to be meant
	here, the third chapter embraces in due proportion all the persons in
	the service of the Church. Naturally after specifying the
	qualifications of the deacon, Paul passes to those of the kindred
	office, the deaconess. "Grave" occurs in the case of both.
	"Not slanderers" here, answers to "not double-tongued"
	in the deacons; so "not false accusers" (Romans 16:1- :). "Sober" here answers to "not given to much
	wine," in the case of the deacons (Romans 16:1- :). Thus it appears he requires the same qualifications in
	female deacons as in deacons, only with such modifications as the
	difference of sex suggested. PLINY,
	in his celebrated letter to Trajan, calls them "female
	ministers." 
	faithful in all things—of
	life as well as faith. Trustworthy in respect to the alms committed
	to them and their other functions, answering to "not greedy of
	filthy lucre," 1 Timothy 3:8, in
	the case of the deacons.
