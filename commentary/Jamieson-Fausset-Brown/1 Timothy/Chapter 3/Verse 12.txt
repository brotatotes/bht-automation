<p><b>ruling their children</b>—There
	is no article in the <i>Greek,</i> "ruling children";
	implying that he regarded the <i>having children to rule</i> as a
	qualification (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:4">1 Timothy 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6">Titus 1:6</span>).

<p><b>their own houses</b>—as
	distinguished from "the Church of God" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6- :">Titus 1:6- :</span>). In the case of the deacons, as in that of the bishops, he
	mentions the first condition of receiving office, rather than the
	special qualifications for its discharge. The practical side of
	Christianity is the one most dwelt on in the Pastoral Epistles, in
	opposition to the heretical teachers; moreover, as the miraculous
	gifts began to be withdrawn, the safest criterion of efficiency would
	be the previous moral character of the candidate, the disposition and
	talent for the office being presupposed. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6- :">Titus 1:6- :</span>, a similar criterion was applied, "Look ye out among you
	seven men <i>of honest report.</i>" Less stress is laid on
	personal dignity in the case of the deacon than in that of the bishop
	(compare <i>Notes,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6- :">Titus 1:6- :</span>).</p>
