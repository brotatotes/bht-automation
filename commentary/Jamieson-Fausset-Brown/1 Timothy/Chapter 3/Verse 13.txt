13. purchase to themselves a good
	degree—literally, "are acquiring . . . a . . .
	step." Understood by many as "a higher step,"
	that is, promotion to the higher office of presbyter. But ambition of
	rising seems hardly the motive to faithfulness which the apostle
	would urge; besides, it would require the comparative, "a better
	degree." Then the past aorist participle, "they that
	used the office of deacon well," implies that the present
	verb, "are acquiring to themselves boldness," is the
	result of the completed action of using the diaconate well. Also,
	Paul would not probably hold out to every deacon the prospect of
	promotion to the presbytery in reward of his service. The idea of
	moving upwards in Church offices was as yet unknown (compare Romans 12:7;
	1 Corinthians 12:4-11). Moreover,
	there seems little connection between reference to a higher Church
	rank and the words "great boldness." Therefore, what those
	who have faithfully discharged the diaconate acquire for themselves
	is "a good standing-place" [ALFORD]
	(a well-grounded hope of salvation) against the day of
	judgment, 1 Timothy 6:19; 1 Corinthians 3:13;
	1 Corinthians 3:14 (the figurative meaning
	of "degree" or "step," being the degree of
	worth which one has obtained in the eye of God [WIESINGER]);
	and boldness (resting on that standing-place"), as well
	for preaching and admonishing others now (1 Corinthians 3:14- :; a firm standing forth for the truth against error), as also
	especially in relation to God their coming Judge, before whom they
	may be boldly confident (Acts 24:16;
	1 John 2:28; 1 John 3:21;
	1 John 4:17; Hebrews 4:16).
	in the faith—rather as
	Greek, "in faith," that is, boldness resting on
	their own faith. 
	which is in Christ
	Jesus—resting in Christ Jesus.
