<p><b>14. write I . . . hoping</b>—that
	is, "though I hope to come unto thee shortly" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). As his hope was not very confident (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), he provides for Timothy's lengthened superintendence by
	giving him the preceding rules to guide him. He now proceeds to give
	more general instructions to him as an evangelist, having a "gift"
	committed to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>).

<p><b>shortly</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"sooner," namely, than is presupposed in the preceding
	directions given to him. See my <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14- :">1 Timothy 4:14- :</span>
	on this verse. This verse best suits the theory that this First
	Epistle was not written after Paul's visit and departure from Ephesus
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:1-20">Acts 19:1-20</span>) when
	he had resolved to winter at Corinth after passing the summer in
	Macedonia (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:6">1 Corinthians 16:6</span>), but after
	his first imprisonment at Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:6- :">1 Corinthians 16:6- :</span>); probably at Corinth, where he might have some thoughts
	of going on to Epirus before returning to Ephesus [BIRKS].</p>
