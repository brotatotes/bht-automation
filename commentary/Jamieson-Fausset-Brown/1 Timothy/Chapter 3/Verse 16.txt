<p><b>16. And</b>—following up <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>: The pillar of the truth is the Church in which thou art
	required to minister; "AND
	(that thou mayest know how grand is that <i>truth</i> which the
	Church so upholds) confessedly (so the <i>Greek</i> for 'without
	controversy') great is the mystery of godliness: (namely), HE
	WHO (so the oldest manuscripts and versions read for 'God')
	was manifested in (the) flesh (He who) was justified in the Spirit,"
	c. There is set before us the whole dignity of Christ's person. If He
	were not essentially superhuman (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), how could the apostle emphatically declare that He was
	<i>manifested in</i> (the) <i>flesh?</i> [TREGELLES,
	<i>Printed Text of the Greek New Testament</i>]. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>

	aspects, is Himself "the mystery of godliness." He who

<p><b>the mystery</b>—the divine
	scheme embodied in CHRIST
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>), once hidden from,
	but now revealed to, us who believe.

<p><b>of godliness</b>—rather,
	"piety"; a different <i>Greek,</i> expresses godliness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27- :">Colossians 1:27- :</span>). In opposition to the <i>ungodliness</i> or <i>impiety</i>
	inseparable from error (<i>departure from the faith:</i> "doctrines
	of devils," "profane fables," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7">1 Timothy 4:7</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7- :">1 Timothy 4:7- :</span>). To the victims of such error, the "mystery of piety"
	(that is, Christ Himself) remains a <i>mystery unrevealed</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7- :">1 Timothy 4:7- :</span>). It is accessible only to "piety" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7- :">1 Timothy 4:7- :</span>): in relation to the pious it is termed a "mystery,"
	though <i>revealed</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7- :">1 Timothy 4:7- :</span>), to imply the excellence of Him who is the surpassing
	essential subject of it, and who is Himself "wonderful"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>), surpassing knowledge

	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:32">Ephesians 5:32</span>. The apostle
	now proceeds to unfold this confessedly great mystery in its details.
	It is not unlikely that some formula of confession or hymn existed in
	the Church and was generally accepted, to which Paul alludes in the
	words "<i>confessedly</i> great is the mystery," c. (to
	wit), "He who was manifested," &amp;c. Such hymns were then
	used (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:19">Ephesians 5:19</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:16">Colossians 3:16</span>).
	PLINY [1.10, <i>Epistle,</i>
	97], "They are wont on a fixed day before dawn to meet and sing
	a hymn in alternate responses to Christ, <i>as being God</i>";
	and EUSEBIUS
	[<i>Ecclesiastical History,</i> 5.28]. The short unconnected
	sentences with the words similarly arranged, and the number of
	syllables almost equal, and the ideas antithetically related, are
	characteristics of a Christian hymn. The clauses stand in
	parallelism; each two are connected as a pair, and form an antithesis
	turning on the opposition of heaven to earth; the order of this
	antithesis is reversed in each new pair of clauses: <i>flesh</i> and
	<i>spirit, angels</i> and <i>Gentiles, world</i> and <i>glory;</i>
	and there is a correspondence between the first and the last clause:
	"manifested in the flesh, received up into glory"
	[WIESINGER].

<p><b>justified</b>—that is,
	approved to be righteous [ALFORD].
	Christ, while "in the flesh," seemed to be just such a one
	as men in the flesh, and in fact bore their <i>sins;</i> but by
	having died to sin, and having risen again, He gained for Himself and
	His people <i>justifying righteousness</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:8">Isaiah 50:8</span>;

	or rather, as the antithesis to "was manifest in the flesh"
	requires, He was justified in the Spirit <i>at the same time</i> that
	He was manifest in the flesh, that is, He was vindicated as divine
	"in His Spirit," that is, in <i>His higher nature;</i> in
	contrast to "in the flesh," <i>His visible human nature.</i>
	This contrasted opposition requires "in the Spirit" to be
	thus explained: not "by the Spirit," as ALFORD
	explains it. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:3">Romans 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>,
	"Made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and <i>declared
	to be the Son of God with power,</i> according to the Spirit of
	holiness, by the resurrection from the dead." So "justified"
	is used to mean <i>vindicated in one's true character</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:19">Matthew 11:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:35">Luke 7:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:4">Romans 3:4</span>).
	His manifestation "in the flesh" exposed him to
	<i>misapprehension,</i> as though he were nothing more (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:41">John 6:41</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:27">John 7:27</span>). His <i>justification,</i>
	or vindication, <i>in respect to His Spirit</i> or higher being, was
	effected by ALL <i>that
	manifested that higher being,</i> His words (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:29">Matthew 7:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:46">John 7:46</span>), His works (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:11">John 2:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:2">John 3:2</span>), by His Father's
	testimony at His baptism (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>),
	and at the transfiguration (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17- :">Matthew 3:17- :</span>), and especially by His resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>), though not by this
	<i>exclusively,</i> as BENGEL
	limits it.

<p><b>seen of angels</b>—answering
	to "preached unto the Gentiles" (or rather "among <i>the
	nations</i>"; including the Jews), on the other hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:26">Romans 16:26</span>).
	"Angels saw the Son of God with us, not having seen Him before"
	[CHRYSOSTOM].' "not
	even they had seen His divine nature, which is not visible to any
	creature, but they saw Him incarnate" [THEODORET]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>). What angels came to
	know by <i>seeing,</i> the nations learned by <i>preaching.</i> He is
	a new message to the one class as well as to the other; in the
	wondrous union in His person of things most opposite, namely, heaven
	and earth, lies "the mystery" [WIESINGER].
	If the <i>English Version,</i> "Gentiles," be retained, the
	antithesis will be between the <i>angels</i> who are so <i>near</i>
	the Son of God, the Lord of "angels," and <i>the Gentiles</i>
	who were so utterly "afar off" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20- :">Colossians 1:20- :</span>).

<p><b>received up into glory</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in glory." However, <i>English Version</i> may be retained
	thus, "Received up (<i>so as now to be</i>) in glory," that
