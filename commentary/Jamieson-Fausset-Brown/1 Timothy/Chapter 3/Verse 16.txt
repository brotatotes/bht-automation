16. And—following up  :-: The pillar of the truth is the Church in which thou art
	required to minister; "AND
	(that thou mayest know how grand is that truth which the
	Church so upholds) confessedly (so the Greek for 'without
	controversy') great is the mystery of godliness: (namely), HE
	WHO (so the oldest manuscripts and versions read for 'God')
	was manifested in (the) flesh (He who) was justified in the Spirit,"
	c. There is set before us the whole dignity of Christ's person. If He
	were not essentially superhuman ( :-), how could the apostle emphatically declare that He was
	manifested in (the) flesh? [TREGELLES,
	Printed Text of the Greek New Testament]. (John 1:14
Philippians 2:7; 1 John 1:2;
	1 John 4:2). Christ, in all His
	aspects, is Himself "the mystery of godliness." He who
	before was hidden "with God" was made manifest
	(John 1:1; John 1:14;
	Romans 16:25; Romans 16:26;
	Colossians 1:26; 2 Timothy 1:10;
	Titus 2:11; Titus 3:4;
	1 John 3:5; 1 John 3:8).
	"Confessedly," that is, by the universal confession of the
	members of "the Church," which is in this respect the
	"pillar" or upholder "of the truth." 
	the mystery—the divine
	scheme embodied in CHRIST
	(Colossians 1:27), once hidden from,
	but now revealed to, us who believe. 
	of godliness—rather,
	"piety"; a different Greek, expresses godliness (Colossians 1:27- :). In opposition to the ungodliness or impiety
	inseparable from error (departure from the faith: "doctrines
	of devils," "profane fables," 1 Timothy 4:1;
	1 Timothy 4:7; compare 1 Timothy 4:7- :). To the victims of such error, the "mystery of piety"
	(that is, Christ Himself) remains a mystery unrevealed (1 Timothy 4:7- :). It is accessible only to "piety" (1 Timothy 4:7- :): in relation to the pious it is termed a "mystery,"
	though revealed (1 Timothy 4:7- :), to imply the excellence of Him who is the surpassing
	essential subject of it, and who is Himself "wonderful"
	(Isaiah 9:6), surpassing knowledge
	(Ephesians 3:18; Ephesians 3:19);
	compare Ephesians 5:32. The apostle
	now proceeds to unfold this confessedly great mystery in its details.
	It is not unlikely that some formula of confession or hymn existed in
	the Church and was generally accepted, to which Paul alludes in the
	words "confessedly great is the mystery," c. (to
	wit), "He who was manifested," &c. Such hymns were then
	used (compare Ephesians 5:19 Colossians 3:16).
	PLINY [1.10, Epistle,
	97], "They are wont on a fixed day before dawn to meet and sing
	a hymn in alternate responses to Christ, as being God";
	and EUSEBIUS
	[Ecclesiastical History, 5.28]. The short unconnected
	sentences with the words similarly arranged, and the number of
	syllables almost equal, and the ideas antithetically related, are
	characteristics of a Christian hymn. The clauses stand in
	parallelism; each two are connected as a pair, and form an antithesis
	turning on the opposition of heaven to earth; the order of this
	antithesis is reversed in each new pair of clauses: flesh and
	spirit, angels and Gentiles, world and glory;
	and there is a correspondence between the first and the last clause:
	"manifested in the flesh, received up into glory"
	[WIESINGER]. 
	justified—that is,
	approved to be righteous [ALFORD].
	Christ, while "in the flesh," seemed to be just such a one
	as men in the flesh, and in fact bore their sins; but by
	having died to sin, and having risen again, He gained for Himself and
	His people justifying righteousness (Isaiah 50:8;
	John 16:10; Acts 22:14;
	Romans 4:25; Romans 6:7;
	Romans 6:10; Hebrews 9:28;
	1 Peter 3:18; 1 Peter 4:1
1 John 2:1) [BENGEL];
	or rather, as the antithesis to "was manifest in the flesh"
	requires, He was justified in the Spirit at the same time that
	He was manifest in the flesh, that is, He was vindicated as divine
	"in His Spirit," that is, in His higher nature; in
	contrast to "in the flesh," His visible human nature.
	This contrasted opposition requires "in the Spirit" to be
	thus explained: not "by the Spirit," as ALFORD
	explains it. So Romans 1:3; Romans 1:4,
	"Made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared
	to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of
	holiness, by the resurrection from the dead." So "justified"
	is used to mean vindicated in one's true character (Matthew 11:19;
	Luke 7:35; Romans 3:4).
	His manifestation "in the flesh" exposed him to
	misapprehension, as though he were nothing more (John 6:41;
	John 7:27). His justification,
	or vindication, in respect to His Spirit or higher being, was
	effected by ALL that
	manifested that higher being, His words (Matthew 7:29;
	John 7:46), His works (John 2:11;
	John 3:2), by His Father's
	testimony at His baptism (Matthew 3:17),
	and at the transfiguration (Matthew 3:17- :), and especially by His resurrection (Acts 13:33;
	Romans 1:4), though not by this
	exclusively, as BENGEL
	limits it. 
	seen of angels—answering
	to "preached unto the Gentiles" (or rather "among the
	nations"; including the Jews), on the other hand (Matthew 28:19;
	Romans 16:25; Romans 16:26).
	"Angels saw the Son of God with us, not having seen Him before"
	[CHRYSOSTOM].' "not
	even they had seen His divine nature, which is not visible to any
	creature, but they saw Him incarnate" [THEODORET]
	(Ephesians 3:8; Ephesians 3:10;
	1 Peter 1:12; compare Colossians 1:16;
	Colossians 1:20). What angels came to
	know by seeing, the nations learned by preaching. He is
	a new message to the one class as well as to the other; in the
	wondrous union in His person of things most opposite, namely, heaven
	and earth, lies "the mystery" [WIESINGER].
	If the English Version, "Gentiles," be retained, the
	antithesis will be between the angels who are so near
	the Son of God, the Lord of "angels," and the Gentiles
	who were so utterly "afar off" (Colossians 1:20- :). 
	believed on in the
	world—which lieth in wickedness (1 John 2:15;
	1 John 5:19). Opposed to "glory"
	(John 3:16; John 3:17).
	This followed upon His being "preached" (John 3:17- :). 
	received up into glory—Greek,
	"in glory." However, English Version may be retained
	thus, "Received up (so as now to be) in glory," that
	is, into glory (Mark 16:19;
	Luke 24:51; Acts 1:11).
	His reception in heaven answers to His reception on earth by being
	"believed on."
