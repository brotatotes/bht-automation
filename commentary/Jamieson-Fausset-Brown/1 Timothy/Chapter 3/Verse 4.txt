<p><b>4. ruleth</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"presiding over." 
	</p>
<p><b>his own house</b>—children
	and servants, as contrasted with "the church" (house) of
	God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:5">1 Timothy 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:15">1 Timothy 3:15</span>)
	which he may be called on to preside over. 
	</p>
<p><b>having his children</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "having children (who are) in subjection"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:6">Titus 1:6</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>gravity</b>—propriety:
	<i>reverent</i> modesty on the part of the children [ALFORD].
	The fact that <i>he has children</i> who are <i>in subjection to him
	in all gravity,</i> is the recommendation in his favor as one likely
	to rule well the Church.</p>
