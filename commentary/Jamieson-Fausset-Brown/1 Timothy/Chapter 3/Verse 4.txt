4. ruleth—Greek,
	"presiding over." 
	his own house—children
	and servants, as contrasted with "the church" (house) of
	God (1 Timothy 3:5; 1 Timothy 3:15)
	which he may be called on to preside over. 
	having his children—rather
	as Greek, "having children (who are) in subjection"
	(Titus 1:6). 
	gravity—propriety:
	reverent modesty on the part of the children [ALFORD].
	The fact that he has children who are in subjection to him
	in all gravity, is the recommendation in his favor as one likely
	to rule well the Church.
