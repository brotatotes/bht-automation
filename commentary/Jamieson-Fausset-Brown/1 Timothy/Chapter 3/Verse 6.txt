<p><b>6. not a novice</b>—one just
	converted. This proves the Church of Ephesus was established now for
	some time. The absence of this rule in the Epistle to Titus, accords
	with the recent planting of the Church at Crete. <i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>neophyte,</i>" literally, "a young plant";
	luxuriantly verdant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:17">Romans 11:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span>).
	The young convert has not yet been disciplined and matured by
	afflictions and temptations. Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6- :">1 Corinthians 3:6- :</span>, "an old disciple." 
	</p>
<p><b>lifted up with pride</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	literally, "wrapt in smoke," so that, inflated with
	self-conceit and exaggerated ideas of his own importance, he cannot
	see himself or others in the true light (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:4">1 Timothy 6:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:4">2 Timothy 3:4</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>condemnation of the
	devil</b>—into the same condemnation as Satan fell into (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:7">1 Timothy 3:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span>). Pride was the cause of
	Satan's condemnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+38:15">Job 38:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:12-15">Isaiah 14:12-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:11">John 16:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:6">Judges 1:6</span>). It cannot mean
	condemnation or accusation <i>on the part of the devil.</i> The devil
	may bring a <i>reproach</i> on men (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:6- :">Judges 1:6- :</span>), but he cannot bring them into <i>condemnation,</i> for he
	does not judge, but is judged [BENGEL].</p>
