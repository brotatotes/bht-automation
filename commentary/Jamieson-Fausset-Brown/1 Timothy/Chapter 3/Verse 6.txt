6. not a novice—one just
	converted. This proves the Church of Ephesus was established now for
	some time. The absence of this rule in the Epistle to Titus, accords
	with the recent planting of the Church at Crete. Greek,
	"neophyte," literally, "a young plant";
	luxuriantly verdant (Romans 6:5;
	Romans 11:17; 1 Corinthians 3:6).
	The young convert has not yet been disciplined and matured by
	afflictions and temptations. Contrast 1 Corinthians 3:6- :, "an old disciple." 
	lifted up with pride—Greek,
	literally, "wrapt in smoke," so that, inflated with
	self-conceit and exaggerated ideas of his own importance, he cannot
	see himself or others in the true light (1 Timothy 6:4;
	2 Timothy 3:4). 
	condemnation of the
	devil—into the same condemnation as Satan fell into (1 Timothy 3:7;
	2 Timothy 2:26). Pride was the cause of
	Satan's condemnation (Job 38:15;
	Isaiah 14:12-15; John 12:31;
	John 16:11; 2 Peter 2:4;
	Judges 1:6). It cannot mean
	condemnation or accusation on the part of the devil. The devil
	may bring a reproach on men (Judges 1:6- :), but he cannot bring them into condemnation, for he
	does not judge, but is judged [BENGEL].
