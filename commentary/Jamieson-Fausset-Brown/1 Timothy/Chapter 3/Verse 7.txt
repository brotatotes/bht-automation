<p><b>7. a good report</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"testimony." So Paul was influenced by the good report
	given of Timothy to choose him as his companion (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of them which are
	without</b>—from the as yet unconverted Gentiles around (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:12">1 Corinthians 5:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:12">1 Thessalonians 4:12</span>),
	that they may be the more readily won to the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:12- :">1 Thessalonians 4:12- :</span>), and that the name of Christ may be glorified. Not even the
	former life of a bishop should be open to reproach [BENGEL].

<p><b>reproach and the snare of the
	devil</b>—<i>reproach</i> of men (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:12- :">1 Thessalonians 4:12- :</span>) proving the occasion of his falling into <i>the snare of
	the devil</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:9">1 Timothy 6:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:15">Matthew 22:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span>). The <i>reproach</i>
	continually surrounding him for former sins might lead him into <i>the
	snare</i> of becoming as bad as his reputation. Despair of recovering
	<i>reputation</i> might, in a weak moment, lead some into
	recklessness of living (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26- :">2 Timothy 2:26- :</span>). The reason why only moral qualities of a general kind are
	specified is, he presupposes in candidates for a bishopric the
	special gifts of the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26- :">2 Timothy 2:26- :</span>) and true faith, which he desires to be evidenced outwardly;
	also he requires qualifications <i>in a bishop</i> not so
	indispensable in others.</p>
