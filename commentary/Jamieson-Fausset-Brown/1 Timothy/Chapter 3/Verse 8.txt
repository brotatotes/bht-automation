8. The deacons were
	chosen by the voice of the people. CYPRIAN
	[Epistle, 2.5] says that good bishops never departed from the
	old custom of consulting the people. The deacons answer to the
	chazzan of the synagogue: the attendant ministers, or
	subordinate coadjutors of the presbyter (as Timothy himself was to
	Paul, 1 Timothy 4:6; Philemon 1:13;
	and John Mark, Acts 13:5). Their
	duty was to read the Scriptures in the Church, to instruct the
	catechumens in Christian truths, to assist the presbyters at the
	sacraments, to receive oblations, and to preach and instruct. As the
	"chazzan" covered and uncovered the ark in the synagogue,
	containing the law, so the deacon in the ancient Church put the
	covering on the communion table. (See CHRYSOSTOM
	[19], Homily on Acts; THEOPHYLACT
	on Luke 19; and BALSAMAN
	on Canon 22, Council of Laodicea). The appointing of
	"the seven" in Acts 13:5- : is perhaps not meant to describe the first
	appointment of the deacons of the Church. At least the chazzan
	previously suggested the similar order of deacons. 
	double-tongued—literally,
	"of double speech"; saying one thing to this person, and
	another to that person [THEODORET].
	The extensive personal intercourse that deacons would have with the
	members of the Church might prove a temptation to such a fault.
	Others explain it, "Saying one thing, thinking another"
	(Proverbs 20:19; Galatians 2:13).
	I prefer the former. 
	not greedy of filthy
	lucre—All gain is filthy (literally, "base") which is
	set before a man as a by-end in his work for God [ALFORD]
	(1 Peter 5:2). The deacon's office
	of collecting and distributing alms would render this a necessary
	qualification.
