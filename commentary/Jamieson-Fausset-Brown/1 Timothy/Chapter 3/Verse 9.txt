<p><b>9. the mystery of the faith</b>â€”<i>holding
	the faith,</i> which to the natural man remains <i>a mystery,</i> but
	which has been revealed by the Spirit to them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7-10">1 Corinthians 2:7-10</span>), <i>in a pure
	conscience</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>).
	("Pure," that is, in which nothing base or foreign is
	intermixed [TITTMANN]).
	Though deacons were not ordinarily called on to preach (Stephen and
	Philip are not exceptions to this, since it was as <i>evangelists,</i>
	rather than as <i>deacons,</i> they preached), yet as being
	office-bearers in the Church, and having much intercourse with all
	the members, they especially needed to have this characteristic,
	which every Christian ought to have.</p>
