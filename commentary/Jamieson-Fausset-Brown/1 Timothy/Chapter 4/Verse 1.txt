<p><b>1. Now</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "But."
	In contrast to the "mystery of godliness."

<p><b>the Spirit</b>—speaking by
	the prophets in the Church (whose prophecies rested on those of the
	Old Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25">Daniel 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:23">Daniel 8:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:30">Daniel 11:30</span>, as also on those of
	Jesus in the New Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:30- :">Daniel 11:30- :</span>), and also by Paul himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:30- :">Daniel 11:30- :</span> (with whom accord <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:3">2 Peter 3:3</span>;

	</p>
<p><b>expressly</b>—"in
	plain words." This shows that he refers to prophecies of the
	Spirit then lying before him. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the latter times</b>—in
	the times <i>following upon the times in which he is now writing.</i>
	Not some remote future, but times <i>immediately subsequent,</i> the
	beginnings of the apostasy being already discernible (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:18- :">Judges 1:18- :</span>): these are the forerunners of "the <i>last</i> days"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:1">2 Timothy 3:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>depart from the faith</b>—The
	apostasy was to be within the Church, the faithful one becoming the
	harlot. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span> (written
	earlier), the apostasy of the Jews from God (joining the heathen
	against Christianity) is the groundwork on which the prophecy rises;
	whereas here, in the Pastoral Epistles, the prophecy is connected
	with Gnostic errors, the seeds of which had already been sown in the
	Church [AUBERLEN] (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3- :">2 Thessalonians 2:3- :</span>). Apollonius Tyanæus, a heretic, came to Ephesus in the
	lifetime of Timothy.

<p><b>seducing spirits</b>—working

	"the spirit of error," opposed to "the spirit of
	truth," "the Spirit" which "speaketh" in the
	true prophets against them.

	"teachings of (that is suggested by) demons." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:6- :">1 John 4:6- :</span>, "wisdom . . . devilish"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:6- :">1 John 4:6- :</span>, "Satan's ministers."</p>
