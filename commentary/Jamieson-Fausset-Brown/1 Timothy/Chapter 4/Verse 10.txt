<p><b>10. therefore</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"with a view to this." <i>The reason why</i> "we both
	('both' is omitted in the oldest manuscripts) labor (endure hardship)
	and suffer reproach (some oldest manuscripts read 'strive') is
	<i>because</i> we have rested, and do rest our hope, on the living
	(and therefore, <i>life-giving,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) God." 
	</p>
<p><b>Saviour</b>—even in this
	life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>specially of those that
	believe</b>—Their "labor and reproach" are not
	inconsistent with their having from the living God, their Saviour,
	even the present life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:30">Mark 10:30</span>,
	"a hundred fold now in this time . . . with persecutions"),
	much more the life to come. If God is in a sense "Saviour"
	of unbelievers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:4">1 Timothy 2:4</span>, that
	is, is <i>willing</i> to be so <i>everlastingly,</i> and <i>is
	temporally here</i> their <i>Preserver</i> and <i>Benefactor</i>),
	much more of believers. He is the Saviour of all men <i>potentially</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>); of believers alone
	<i>effectually.</i></p>
