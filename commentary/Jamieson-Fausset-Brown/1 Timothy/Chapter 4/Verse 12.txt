12. Let no man despise thy youth—Act
	so as to be respected in spite of thy youth (1 Corinthians 16:11;
	Titus 2:15); compare "youthful"
	as to Timothy (2 Timothy 2:22). He
	was but a mere youth when he joined Paul (2 Timothy 2:22- :). Eleven years had elapsed since then to the time
	subsequent to Paul's first imprisonment. He was, therefore, still
	young; especially in comparison with Paul, whose place he was
	filling; also in relation to elderly presbyters whom he should
	"entreat as a father" (2 Timothy 2:22- :), and generally in respect to his duties in rebuking,
	exhorting, and ordaining (1 Timothy 3:1),
	which ordinarily accord best with an elderly person (1 Timothy 3:1- :). 
	be thou an example—Greek,
	"become a pattern" (1 Timothy 3:1- :); the true way of making men not to despise (slight, or
	disregard) thy youth. 
	in word—in all that
	thou sayest in public and private. 
	conversation—that is,
	"behavior" the Old English sense of the word. 
	in charity . . . faith—the
	two cardinal principles of the Christian (1 Timothy 3:1- :). The oldest manuscripts omit, "in spirit." 
	in purity—simplicity of
	holy motive followed out in consistency of holy action [ALFORD]
	(1 Timothy 5:22; 2 Corinthians 6:6;
	James 3:17; James 4:8;
	1 Peter 1:22).
