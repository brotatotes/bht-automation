<p><b>12. Let no man despise thy youth</b>—Act

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:15">Titus 2:15</span>); compare "youthful"
	as to Timothy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22">2 Timothy 2:22</span>). He
	was but a mere youth when he joined Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22- :">2 Timothy 2:22- :</span>). Eleven years had elapsed since then to the time
	subsequent to Paul's first imprisonment. He was, therefore, still
	young; especially in comparison with Paul, whose place he was
	filling; also in relation to elderly presbyters whom he should
	"entreat as a father" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22- :">2 Timothy 2:22- :</span>), and generally in respect to his duties in rebuking,
	exhorting, and ordaining (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1">1 Timothy 3:1</span>),
	which ordinarily accord best with an elderly person (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1- :">1 Timothy 3:1- :</span>).

	disregard) thy youth.
