13. Till I come—when Timothy's
	commission would be superseded for the time by the presence of the
	apostle himself (1 Timothy 1:3;
	1 Timothy 3:14). 
	reading—especially in
	the public congregation. The practice of reading Scripture was
	transferred from the Jewish synagogue to the Christian Church
	(Luke 4:16-20; Acts 13:15;
	Acts 15:21; 2 Corinthians 3:14).
	The New Testament Gospel and Epistles being recognized as inspired by
	those who had the gift of discerning spirits, were from the
	first, according as they were written, read along with the Old
	Testament in the Church (1 Thessalonians 5:21;
	1 Thessalonians 5:27; Colossians 4:16),
	[JUSTIN MARTYR,
	Apology, 1.67]. I think that while public reading is
	the prominent thought, the Spirit intended also to teach that
	Scripture reading in private should be "the fountain of all
	wisdom from which pastors ought to draw whatever they bring before
	their flock" [ALFORD].
	exhortation—addressed
	to the feelings and will with a view to the regulation of the
	conduct. 
	doctrine—Greek
	(ministerial), "teaching" or instruction. Addressed
	to the understanding, so as to impart knowledge (1 Timothy 6:2;
	Romans 12:7; Romans 12:8).
	Whether in public or private, exhortation and instruction
	should be based on Scripture reading.
