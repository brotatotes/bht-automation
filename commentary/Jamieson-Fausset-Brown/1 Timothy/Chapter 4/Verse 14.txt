<p><b>14. Neglect not the gift</b>—by
	letting it lie unused. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span>
	the gift is represented as a <i>spark</i> of the Spirit lying within
	him, and sure to smoulder by neglect, the <i>stirring up</i> or
	keeping in lively exercise of which depends on the will of him on
	whom it is bestowed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:18">Matthew 25:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:25">Matthew 25:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:27">Matthew 25:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:28">Matthew 25:28</span>). The <i>charism</i> or
	spiritual gift, is that of the Spirit which qualified him for "the
	work of an evangelist" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:5">2 Timothy 4:5</span>), or perhaps <i>the gift
	of discerning spirits,</i> specially needed in his function of
	ordaining, as overseer [BISHOP
	HINDS]. 
	</p>
<p><b>given thee</b>—by God
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:6">1 Corinthians 12:6</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>by prophecy</b>—that is, by
	the Holy Spirit, at his general ordination, or else consecration, to
	the special see of Ephesus, speaking through the prophets God's will
	to give him the graces needed to qualify him for his work (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1-3">Acts 13:1-3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>with . . . laying on of . . .
	hands</b>—So in Joshua's case (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+27:18-20">Numbers 27:18-20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+34:9">Deuteronomy 34:9</span>). The gift was connected
	with the symbolical act of laying on hands. But the <i>Greek</i>
	"with" implies that the <i>presbyter's</i> laying on hands
	was the mere <i>accompaniment</i> of the conferring of the gift. "By"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span>) implies that <i>Paul's</i>
	laying on his hands was the actual <i>instrument</i> of its being
	conferred. 
	</p>
<p><b>of the presbytery</b>—In
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span> the apostle mentions
	only <i>his own</i> laying on of hands. But there his aim is to
	remind Timothy specially of the part he himself took in imparting to
	him the gift. Here he mentions the fact, quite consistent with the
	other, that the neighboring presbyters took part in the ordination or
	consecration, he, however, taking the foremost part. Paul, though
	having the general oversight of the elders everywhere, was an elder
	himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:1">1 Peter 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:1">2 John 1:1</span>).
	The Jewish council was composed of the elders of the Church (the
	presbytery, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:66">Luke 22:66</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:5">Acts 22:5</span>),
	and a presiding rabbi; so the Christian Church was composed of
	apostles, elders, and a president (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:5- :">Acts 22:5- :</span>). As the president of the synagogue was of the same order
	as his presbyters, so the bishop was of the same order as his
	presbyters. At the ordination of the president of the synagogue there
	were always three presbyters present to lay on hands, so the early
	Church canons required three bishops to be present at the
	consecration of a bishop. As the president of the synagogue, so the
	bishop of the Church alone could ordain, he acting as the
	representative, and in the name of the whole presbytery [VITRINGA].
	So, in the Anglican Church, the bishop ordains, the presbyters or
	priests present joining with him in laying on hands.</p>
