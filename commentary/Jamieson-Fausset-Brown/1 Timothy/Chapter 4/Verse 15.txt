15. Meditate—Greek,
	"Meditate CAREFULLY
	upon" (Psalms 1:2;
	Psalms 119:15; compare "Isaac,"
	Genesis 24:63). 
	these things— (Genesis 24:63- :). As food would not nourish without digestion, which
	assimilates the food to the substance of the body, so spiritual food,
	in order to benefit us, needs to be appropriated by prayerful
	meditation. 
	give thyself wholly
	to—literally, "BE
	in these things"; let them engross thee wholly; be wholly
	absorbed in them. Entire self-dedication, as in other
	pursuits, so especially in religion, is the secret of proficiency.
	There are changes as to all other studies, fashionable to-day, out of
	fashion to-morrow; this study alone is never obsolete, and when made
	the all-engrossing aim sanctifies all other studies. The exercise of
	the ministry threatens the spirit of the ministry, unless it be
	sustained within. The minister must be first his own scholar before
	he can be another's teacher. 
	profiting—Greek,
	"progress" towards perfection in the Christian life, and
	especially towards the fullest realization of the ideal of a
	Christian minister (1 Timothy 4:12). 
	may appear to all—not
	for thy glory, but for the winning of souls (1 Timothy 4:12- :).
