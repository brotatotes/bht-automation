<p><b>16. Take heed</b>—Give heed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>thyself, and . . .
	doctrine</b>—"and unto thy teaching." The two requisites
	of a good pastor: His teaching will be of no avail unless his own
	life accord with it; and his own purity of life is not enough unless
	he be diligent in teaching [CALVIN].
	This verse is a summary of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>continue in them</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in doing this</b>—not "<i>by</i>
	doing this," as though he could save himself by works. 
	</p>
<p><b>thou shalt . . . save
	thyself, and them that hear thee</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+33:9">Ezekiel 33:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:20">James 5:20</span>). In performing
	faithfully his duty to others, the minister is promoting his own
	salvation. Indeed he cannot "give heed unto the teaching"
	of others, unless he be at the same time "giving heed unto
	himself."</p>
