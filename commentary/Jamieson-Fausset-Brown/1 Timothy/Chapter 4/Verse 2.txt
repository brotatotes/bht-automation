<p><b>2.</b> Rather translate, "Through
	(literally, '<i>in</i>'; the element <i>in</i> which the apostasy has
	place) the hypocrisy of lying speakers"; this expresses the
	means <i>through</i> which "some shall (be led to) depart from
	the faith," namely, the reigned sanctity of the seducers
	(compare "deceivers," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>having their conscience
	seared</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i> "having <i>their own</i> conscience,"
	c., that is, not only "speaking lies" <i>to others,</i> but
	also having <i>their own</i> conscience seared. Professing to lead
	others to holiness, <i>their</i> own conscience is all the while
	defiled. Bad consciences always have recourse to hypocrisy. As <i>faith</i>
	and a <i>good conscience</i> are joined (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) so <i>hypocrisy</i> (that is, <i>unbelief,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:51">Matthew 24:51</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:51- :">Matthew 24:51- :</span>) and a <i>bad conscience</i> here. THEODORET
	explains like <i>English Version,</i> "seared," as implying
	their extreme <i>insensibility;</i> the effect of cauterizing being
	to deaden sensation. The <i>Greek,</i> however, primarily means
	"branded" with the consciousness of crimes committed
	against their better knowledge and conscience, like so many scars
	burnt in by a branding iron: Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:15">Titus 1:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:11">Titus 3:11</span>, "condemned of
	himself." They are conscious of the brand within, and yet with a
	hypocritical show of sanctity, they strive to seduce others. As "a
	seal" is used in a good sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:11- :">Titus 3:11- :</span>), so "a brand" in a bad sense. The image is taken
	from the branding of criminals.</p>
