<p><b>3.</b> Sensuality leads to false
	spiritualism. Their own inward impurity is reflected in their eyes in
	the world without them, and hence their asceticism (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:14">Titus 1:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:15">Titus 1:15</span>) [WIESINGER].
	By a spurious spiritualism (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:15- :">Titus 1:15- :</span>), which made moral perfection consist in abstinence from
	outward things, they pretended to attain to a higher perfection. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:15- :">Titus 1:15- :</span> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:8">1 Corinthians 7:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:26">1 Corinthians 7:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:38">1 Corinthians 7:38</span>)
	gave a seeming handle to their "forbidding marriage"
	(contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:14">1 Timothy 5:14</span>); and the
	Old Testament distinction as to clean and unclean, gave a pretext for
	teaching to "abstain from meats" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:16">Colossians 2:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:17">Colossians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20-23">Colossians 2:20-23</span>).
	As these Judaizing Gnostics combined the harlot or apostate Old
	Testament Church with the beast (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20-51.2.23- :">Colossians 2:20-51.2.23- :</span>), or Gnostic spiritualizing anti-Christianity, so Rome's
	Judaizing elements (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>)
	shall ultimately be combined with the open worldly-wise
	anti-Christianity of the false prophet or beast (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:20">1 Timothy 6:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:21">1 Timothy 6:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>;

	Austerity gained for them a show of sanctity while preaching false
	doctrine (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>). EUSEBIUS
	[<i>Ecclesiastical History,</i> 4.29] quotes from IRENÆUS
	[1.28] a statement that Saturninus, Marcion, and the Encratites
	preached abstinence from marriage and animal meats. Paul
	prophetically warns against such notions, the seeds of which already
	were being sown (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:20">1 Timothy 6:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:17">2 Timothy 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18">2 Timothy 2:18</span>).
