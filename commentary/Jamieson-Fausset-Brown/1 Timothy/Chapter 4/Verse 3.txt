3. Sensuality leads to false
	spiritualism. Their own inward impurity is reflected in their eyes in
	the world without them, and hence their asceticism (Titus 1:14;
	Titus 1:15) [WIESINGER].
	By a spurious spiritualism (Titus 1:15- :), which made moral perfection consist in abstinence from
	outward things, they pretended to attain to a higher perfection. Titus 1:15- : (compare 1 Corinthians 7:8;
	1 Corinthians 7:26; 1 Corinthians 7:38)
	gave a seeming handle to their "forbidding marriage"
	(contrast 1 Timothy 5:14); and the
	Old Testament distinction as to clean and unclean, gave a pretext for
	teaching to "abstain from meats" (compare Colossians 2:16;
	Colossians 2:17; Colossians 2:20-23).
	As these Judaizing Gnostics combined the harlot or apostate Old
	Testament Church with the beast (Colossians 2:20-51.2.23- :), or Gnostic spiritualizing anti-Christianity, so Rome's
	Judaizing elements (1 Timothy 4:3)
	shall ultimately be combined with the open worldly-wise
	anti-Christianity of the false prophet or beast (1 Timothy 6:20;
	1 Timothy 6:21; Colossians 2:8;
	1 John 4:1-3; Revelation 13:12-15).
	Austerity gained for them a show of sanctity while preaching false
	doctrine (Colossians 2:23). EUSEBIUS
	[Ecclesiastical History, 4.29] quotes from IRENÆUS
	[1.28] a statement that Saturninus, Marcion, and the Encratites
	preached abstinence from marriage and animal meats. Paul
	prophetically warns against such notions, the seeds of which already
	were being sown (1 Timothy 6:20;
	2 Timothy 2:17; 2 Timothy 2:18).
	to be received—Greek,
	"to be partaken of." 
	of them—literally,
	(created and designed) "for them," Though all
	(even the unbelieving, Psalms 104:14;
	Matthew 5:45) are partakers in these
	foods created by God, "they which believe" alone fulfil
	God's design in creation by partaking of them with thanksgiving;
	as opposed to those who abstain from them, or in partaking of
	them, do not do so with thanksgiving. The unbelieving have not
	the designed use of such foods by reason of their "conscience
	being defiled" (Titus 1:15).
	The children of God alone "inherit the earth"; for
	obedience is the necessary qualification (as it was in the original
	grant of the earth to Adam), which they alone possess. 
	and know the
	truth—explanatory and defining who are "they which
	believe." Translate as Greek, "and have full
	knowledge of the truth" (see on Titus 1:15- :). Thus he contradicts the assumption of superior knowledge
	and higher moral perfection, put forward by the heretics, on the
	ground of their abstinence from marriage and meats. "The truth"
	stands in opposition to their "lies" (Titus 1:15- :).
