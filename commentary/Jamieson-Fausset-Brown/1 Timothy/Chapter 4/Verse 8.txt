8. profiteth little—Greek,
	"profiteth to (but) a small extent." Paul does not deny
	that fasting and abstinence from conjugal intercourse for a time,
	with a view to reaching the inward man through the outward, do profit
	somewhat, Acts 13:3; 1 Corinthians 7:5;
	1 Corinthians 7:7; 1 Corinthians 9:26;
	1 Corinthians 9:27 (though in its
	degenerate form, asceticism, dwelling solely on what is outward, 1 Corinthians 9:27- :, is not only not profitable but injurious). Timothy seems to
	have had a leaning to such outward self-discipline (compare 1 Corinthians 9:27- :). Paul, therefore, while not disapproving of this in its due
	proportion and place, shows the vast superiority of godliness
	or piety, as being profitable not merely "to a
	small extent," but unto all things; for, having its seat
	within, it extends thence to the whole outward life of a man. Not
	unto one portion only of his being, but to every portion of it,
	bodily and spiritual, temporal and eternal [ALFORD].
	"He who has piety (which is 'profitable unto all
	things') wants nothing needed to his well-being, even though he be
	without those helps which, 'to a small extent,' bodily exercise
	furnishes" [CALVIN].
	"Piety," which is the end for which thou art
	to "exercise thyself" (1 Corinthians 9:27- :), is the essential thing: the means are secondary. 
	having promise,
	c.—Translate as Greek, "Having promise of life, that
	which now is, and that which is to come." "Life" in
	its truest and best sense now and hereafter (1 Corinthians 9:27- :). Length of life now so far as it is really good for the
	believer life in its truest enjoyments and employments now, and life
	blessed and eternal hereafter (Matthew 6:33;
	Mark 10:29; Mark 10:30).
	"Now in this time" (Psalms 84:11;
	Psalms 112:1-10; Romans 8:28;
	1 Corinthians 3:21; 1 Corinthians 3:22,
	"all things are yours . . . the world, life . . . things
	present, things to come"). Christianity, which seems to aim only
	at our happiness hereafter, effectually promotes it here (1 Timothy 6:6;
	2 Peter 1:3). Compare Solomon's
	prayer and the answer (2 Peter 1:3- :).
