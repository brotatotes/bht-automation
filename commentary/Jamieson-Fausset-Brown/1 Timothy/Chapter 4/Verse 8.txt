<p><b>8. profiteth little</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"profiteth to (but) a small extent." Paul does not deny
	that fasting and abstinence from conjugal intercourse for a time,
	with a view to reaching the inward man through the outward, do profit
	somewhat, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:5">1 Corinthians 7:5</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span> (though in its
	degenerate form, asceticism, dwelling solely on what is outward, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27- :">1 Corinthians 9:27- :</span>, is not only not profitable but injurious). Timothy seems to
	have had a leaning to such outward self-discipline (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27- :">1 Corinthians 9:27- :</span>). Paul, therefore, while not disapproving of this in its due
	proportion and place, shows the vast superiority of <i>godliness</i>
	or <i>piety,</i> as being <i>profitable</i> not merely "to a
	small extent," but unto <i>all</i> things; for, having its seat
	within, it extends thence to the whole outward life of a man. Not
	unto one portion only of his being, but to every portion of it,
	bodily and spiritual, temporal and eternal [ALFORD].
	"He who has <i>piety</i> (which is 'profitable unto <i>all</i>
	things') wants nothing needed to his well-being, even though he be
	without those helps which, 'to a small extent,' <i>bodily exercise</i>
	furnishes" [CALVIN].
	"<i>Piety,</i>" which is the <i>end</i> for which thou art
	to "exercise thyself" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27- :">1 Corinthians 9:27- :</span>), is the essential thing: the means are secondary.

<p><b>having promise,</b>
	c.—Translate as <i>Greek,</i> "Having promise of life, that
	which now is, and that which is to come." "Life" in
	its truest and best sense now and hereafter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27- :">1 Corinthians 9:27- :</span>). Length of life now so far as it is really good for the
	believer life in its truest enjoyments and employments now, and life
	blessed and eternal hereafter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:33">Matthew 6:33</span>;

	at our happiness hereafter, effectually promotes it here (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:6">1 Timothy 6:6</span>;
