<p><b>9.</b> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). This verse (<i>Greek</i>), "faithful is the saying, "
	&amp;c. confirms the assertion as to the "promise" attached
	to "godliness," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>,
	and forms a prefatory introduction to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8- :">1 Timothy 4:8- :</span>, which is joined to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:9">1 Timothy 4:9</span>
	by "For." So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span>.
	Godly men seem to suffer loss as to this life: Paul hereby refutes
	the notion [BENGEL]. "God
	is the <i>Saviour</i> specially of those that believe" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11- :">2 Timothy 2:11- :</span>), both as to "the life that now is," and also as
	to "the life which is to come" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11- :">2 Timothy 2:11- :</span>).</p>
