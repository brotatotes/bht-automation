<p><b>1. an elder</b>—<i>in age;</i>
	probably not an elder <i>in the ministry;</i> these latter are not
	mentioned till <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>, "the
	elders that rule." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17- :">1 Timothy 5:17- :</span>, "your old men," literally, "elders."
	Contrasted with "the younger men." As Timothy was
	admonished so to conduct himself as to give no man reason to <i>despise</i>
	his <i>youth</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>); so
	here he is told to bear in mind his youth, and to behave with the
	modesty which becomes a young man in relation to his elders.

<p><b>Rebuke not</b>—literally,
	"Strike not hard upon"; <i>Rebuke not sharply:</i> a
	different word from "rebuke" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12- :">1 Timothy 4:12- :</span>.

<p><b>entreat</b>—exhort.

<p><b>as brethren</b>—and
	therefore equals; not lording it over them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12- :">1 Timothy 4:12- :</span>).</p>
