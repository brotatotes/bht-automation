<p><b>cast off their first

	There could be no hardship at the age of sixty or upwards in not
	marrying again (end of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9">1 Timothy 5:9</span>),
	for the sake of serving better the cause of Christ as presbyteresses;
	though, to ordinary widows, no barrier existed against remarriage
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:39">1 Corinthians 7:39</span>). This is altogether
	distinct from Rome's unnatural vows of celibacy in the case of young
	marriageable women. The widow-presbyteresses, moreover, engaged to
	remain single, not as though single life were holier than married
	life (according to Rome's teaching), but because the interests of
	Christ's cause made it desirable (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:39- :">1 Corinthians 7:39- :</span>). They had pledged "their first faith" to Christ as
	presbyteress widows; they now wish to transfer their faith to a
	husband (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:32">1 Corinthians 7:32</span>;
