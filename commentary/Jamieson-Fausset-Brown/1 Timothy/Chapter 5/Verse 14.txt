	namely younger widows in general, as distinguished from <i>the older

	of the two cases were distinct (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:40- :">1 Corinthians 7:40- :</span>). Here remarriage is recommended as an antidote to <i>sexual
	passion, idleness,</i> and the other evils noted in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:40- :">1 Corinthians 7:40- :</span>. Of course, where there was no tendency to these evils,
	marriage again would not be so requisite; Paul speaks of what is
	generally desirable, and supposing there should be danger of such
	evils, as was likely. "He does not impose <i>a law,</i> but
