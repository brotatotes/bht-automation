<p><b>16. If any . . . have widows</b>—of
	his family, however related to him. Most of the oldest manuscripts
	and versions omit "man or," and read, "If any woman
	that believeth." But the Received text <i>seems</i> preferable.
	If, however, the weightiest <i>authorities</i> are to prevail, the
	sense will be: He was speaking of younger widows; He now says, If <i>any
	believing young widow</i> have widows related to her needing support,
	let her relieve them, thereby casing the Church of the burden,

	(<i>there</i> it was <i>the children</i> and <i>grandchildren;</i>

	<i>widow-presbyteress</i>).

<p><b>let them</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "let him," or "her"; "let such
	a one" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:10">1 Timothy 5:10</span>).
