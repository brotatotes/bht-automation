<p><b>17.</b> The transition from the
	widow presbyteresses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:9">1 Timothy 5:9</span>)
	to the presbyters here, is natural. 
	</p>
<p><b>rule well</b>—literally,
	"preside well," with wisdom, ability, and loving
	faithfulness, over the flock assigned to them. 
	</p>
<p><b>be counted worthy of double
	honour</b>—that is, the honor which is expressed by gifts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:3">1 Timothy 5:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:18">1 Timothy 5:18</span>) and otherwise. If a
	presbyter as such, in virtue of his office, is already worthy of
	honor, he who <i>rules well</i> is <i>doubly so</i> [WIESINGER]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:14">1 Corinthians 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:6">Galatians 6:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span>). Not literally that a
	presbyter who rules well should get <i>double the salary</i> of one
	who does not rule well [ALFORD],
	or of a presbyteress widow, or of the deacons [CHRYSOSTOM].
	"Double" is used for large in general (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12- :">1 Thessalonians 5:12- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>specially they who labour in
	the word and doctrine</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "teaching";
	preaching of the word, and instruction, catechetical or otherwise.
	This implies that of the <i>ruling presbyters</i> there were two
	kinds, those who <i>labored in the word and teaching,</i> and those
	who did not. Lay presbyters, so called merely because of their <i>age,</i>
	have no place here; for both classes mentioned here alike are <i>ruling</i>
	presbyters. A college of presbyters is implied as existing in each
	large congregation. As in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:12- :">1 Thessalonians 5:12- :</span> their qualifications are spoken of, so here the
	acknowledgments due to them for their services.</p>
