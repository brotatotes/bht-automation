17. The transition from the
	widow presbyteresses (1 Timothy 5:9)
	to the presbyters here, is natural. 
	rule well—literally,
	"preside well," with wisdom, ability, and loving
	faithfulness, over the flock assigned to them. 
	be counted worthy of double
	honour—that is, the honor which is expressed by gifts (1 Timothy 5:3;
	1 Timothy 5:18) and otherwise. If a
	presbyter as such, in virtue of his office, is already worthy of
	honor, he who rules well is doubly so [WIESINGER]
	(1 Corinthians 9:14; Galatians 6:6;
	1 Thessalonians 5:12). Not literally that a
	presbyter who rules well should get double the salary of one
	who does not rule well [ALFORD],
	or of a presbyteress widow, or of the deacons [CHRYSOSTOM].
	"Double" is used for large in general (1 Thessalonians 5:12- :). 
	specially they who labour in
	the word and doctrine—Greek, "teaching";
	preaching of the word, and instruction, catechetical or otherwise.
	This implies that of the ruling presbyters there were two
	kinds, those who labored in the word and teaching, and those
	who did not. Lay presbyters, so called merely because of their age,
	have no place here; for both classes mentioned here alike are ruling
	presbyters. A college of presbyters is implied as existing in each
	large congregation. As in 1 Thessalonians 5:12- : their qualifications are spoken of, so here the
	acknowledgments due to them for their services.
