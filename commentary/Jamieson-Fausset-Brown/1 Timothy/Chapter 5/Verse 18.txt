<p><b>18. the scripture</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; quoted before in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</span>).

<p><b>the ox that treadeth

<p><b>The labourer is worthy of his
	reward</b>—or "hire"; quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:9- :">1 Corinthians 9:9- :</span>, whereas <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10">Matthew 10:10</span> has
	"his meat," or "food." If Paul extends the
	phrase, "Scripture saith," to this second clause, as well
	as to the first, he will be hereby recognizing the Gospel of Luke,
	his own helper (whence appears the undesigned appositeness of the
	quotation), as inspired <i>Scripture.</i> This I think the correct
	view. The Gospel according to Luke was probably in circulation then
	about eight or nine years. However, it is possible "Scripture
	saith" applies only to the passage quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:10- :">Matthew 10:10- :</span>; and then his quotation will be that of a common proverb,
	quoted also by the Lord, which commends itself to the approval of
	all, and is approved by the Lord and His apostle.</p>
