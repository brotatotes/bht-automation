19. Against an elder—a
	presbyter of the Church. 
	receive not—"entertain
	not" [ALFORD]. 
	but before two or three
	witnesses—A judicial conviction was not permitted in
	Deuteronomy 17:6; Deuteronomy 19:15,
	except on the testimony of at least two or three witnesses (compare
	Matthew 18:16; John 8:17;
	2 Corinthians 13:1; 1 John 5:6;
	1 John 5:7). But Timothy's
	entertaining an accusation against anyone is a different case,
	where the object was not judicially to punish, but to admonish: here
	he might ordinarily entertain it without the need of two or
	three witnesses; but not in the case of an elder, since the more
	earnest an elder was to convince gainsayers (1 John 5:7- :), the more exposed would he be to vexatious and false
	accusations. How important then was it that Timothy should not,
	without strong testimony, entertain a charge against presbyters, who
	should, in order to be efficient, be "blameless" (1 Timothy 3:2;
	Titus 1:6). 1 Timothy 5:21;
	1 Timothy 5:24 imply that Timothy had
	the power of judging in the Church. Doubtless he would not condemn
	any save on the testimony of two or three witnesses, but in ordinary
	cases he would cite them, as the law of Moses also allowed, though
	there were only one witness. But in the case of elders, he would
	require two or three witnesses before even citing them; for their
	character for innocence stands higher, and they are exposed to envy
	and calumny more than others "Receive" does not, as ALFORD
	thinks, include both citation and conviction, but means only the
	former.
