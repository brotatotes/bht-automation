20. Them that sin—whether
	presbyters or laymen. 
	rebuke before all—publicly
	before the Church (Matthew 18:15-17;
	1 Corinthians 5:9-13; Ephesians 5:11).
	Not until this "rebuke" was disregarded was the offender to
	be excommunicated. 
	others . . . fear—that
	other members of the Church may have a wholesome fear of offending
	(Deuteronomy 13:11; Acts 5:11).
