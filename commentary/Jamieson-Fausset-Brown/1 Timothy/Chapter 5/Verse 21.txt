<p><b>21. I charge thee</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "I <i>adjure</i> thee"; so it ought to be
	translated (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:1">2 Timothy 4:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>before</b>—"<i>in the
	presence of</i> God." 
	</p>
<p><b>Lord</b>—omitted in the
	oldest manuscripts <i>God the Father, and Christ the Son,</i> will
	testify against thee, if thou disregardest my injunction. He vividly
	sets before Timothy <i>the last judgment,</i> in which God shall be
	revealed, and Christ seen face to face with His angels 
	</p>
<p><b>elect angels</b>—an epithet
	of reverence. The objects of divine electing love (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:1- :">2 Timothy 4:1- :</span>). Not only "<i>elect</i>" (according to the
	everlasting purpose of God) in contradistinction to <i>the reprobate</i>
	angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>), but also to
	mark the excellence of the angels in general (as God's chosen
	ministers, "holy angels," "angels of light"), and
	so to give more solemnity to their testimony [CALVIN]
	as witnesses to Paul's adjuration. Angels take part by action and
	sympathy in the affairs of the earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:10">Luke 15:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>these things</b>—the
	injunctions, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:19">1 Timothy 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20">1 Timothy 5:20</span>.
	</p>
<p><b>without preferring one before
	another</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i> "<i>prejudice</i>";
	"judging before" hearing all the facts of a case. There
	ought to be judgment, but not prejudging. Compare "suddenly,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22">1 Timothy 5:22</span>, also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:22- :">1 Timothy 5:22- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>partiality</b>—<i>in favor
	of</i> a man, as "prejudice" is bias <i>against</i> a man.
	Some of the oldest manuscripts read, "in the way of <i>summoning</i>
	(brethren) <i>before a</i> (heathen) <i>judge.</i>" But <i>Vulgate</i>
	and other good authorities favor the more probable reading in <i>English
	Version.</i></p>
