<p><b>22. Lay hands</b>—that is, ordain
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>). The connection is with
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:19">1 Timothy 5:19</span>. The way to guard
	against scandals occurring in the case of presbyters is, be cautious
	as to the character of the candidate before ordaining him; this will
	apply to other Church officers so ordained, as well as to presbyters.
	Thus, this clause refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:19- :">1 Timothy 5:19- :</span>, as next clause, "neither be partaker of other men's
	sins," refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20">1 Timothy 5:20</span>.
	ELLICOTT and WIESINGER
	understand it of <i>receiving back into Church fellowship</i> or
	<i>absolution, by laying hands on those who had been</i> "<i>rebuked</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20">1 Timothy 5:20</span>) <i>and then
	excommunicated</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:17">Matthew 18:17</span>);
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20">1 Timothy 5:20</span> favors this. But as in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:6">Acts 6:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6">2 Timothy 1:6</span>,
	the laying on of hands is used of <i>ordination</i> (compare however
	as to <i>confirmation,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:6- :">2 Timothy 1:6- :</span>), it seems better to take it so here. 
	</p>
<p><b>suddenly</b>—hastily:
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:24">1 Timothy 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:25">1 Timothy 5:25</span>
	show that waiting for a time is salutary. 
	</p>
<p><b>neither be partaker of other
	men's sins</b>—by negligence in ordaining ungodly candidates, and
	so becoming in some degree responsible for their sins. Or, there is
	the same transition from the <i>elders</i> to <i>all in general</i>
	who may sin, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:19">1 Timothy 5:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20">1 Timothy 5:20</span>. Be not a partaker in
	other men's sins by not "rebuking them that sin before all,"
	as well as those that are candidates for the presbytery, as also all
	"that sin." 
	</p>
<p><b>keep thyself pure</b>—"thyself'
	is emphatic. "Keep THYSELF"
	<i>clear</i> of participation in OTHER
	men's sin by not failing to <i>rebuke them that sin</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20- :">1 Timothy 5:20- :</span>). Thus the transition is easy to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:20- :">1 Timothy 5:20- :</span>, which is concerning Timothy <i>personally;</i> compare also
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:24">1 Timothy 5:24</span>.</p>
