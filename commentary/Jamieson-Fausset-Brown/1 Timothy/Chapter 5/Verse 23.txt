<p><b>23. no longer</b>â€”as a habit. This
	injunction to drink wine occasionally is a modification of the
	preceding "keep thyself pure." The presbyter and deacon
	were enjoined to be "not given to wine" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:3">1 Timothy 3:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>). Timothy seems to have
	had a tendency to undue ascetical strictness on this point (compare
	<i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8">1 Timothy 4:8</span>;
	compare the Nazarene vow, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:8- :">1 Timothy 4:8- :</span>; John the Baptist, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:15">Luke 1:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:14">Luke 1:14</span>). Paul therefore
	modifies the preceding words, "keep thyself pure,"
	virtually saying, "Not that I mean to enjoin that kind of purity
	which consists in asceticism, nay, <i>be no longer a water-drinker,</i>"
	that is, no longer drink <i>only</i> water, but <i>use a little wine,</i>
	as much as is needed for thy health. So ELLICOTT
	and WIESINGER. ALFORD
	thus: Timothy was of a feeble frame (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:14- :">Luke 1:14- :</span>), and prone to timidity in his duties as overseer where
	vigorous action was needed; hence Paul exhorts him to take all proper
	means to raise his bodily condition above these infirmities. God
	hereby commands believers to use all due means for preserving health,
	and condemns by anticipation the human traditions which among various
	sects have denied the use of wine to the faithful.</p>
