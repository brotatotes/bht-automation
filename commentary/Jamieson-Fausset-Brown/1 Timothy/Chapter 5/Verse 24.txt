24. Two kinds of sins are
	specified: those palpably manifest (so the Greek for
	"open beforehand" ought to be translated; so in  :-, it is translated "evident"; literally, "before"
	the eyes, that is, notorious), further explained as "going
	before to judgment"; and those which follow after the men ("some
	men they, that is, their sins, follow after"), namely, not going
	beforehand, loudly accusing, but hidden till they come to the
	judgment: so 1 Timothy 5:25, the
	good works are of two classes: those palpably manifest
	(translate so, instead of "manifest beforehand") and "those
	that are otherwise," that is, not palpably manifest. Both
	alike "cannot be hid"; the former class in the case of bad
	and good are manifest already; the latter class in the case of
	both are not manifest now, but shall be so at the final judgment.
going before to judgmentâ€”as
	heralds; crying sins which accuse their perpetrator. The connection
	seems to me this: He had enjoined Timothy, 1 Timothy 5:25- :, "Rebuke them that sin before all": and in
	1 Timothy 5:22, "Neither be
	partaker of other men's sins," by ordaining ungodly men; having
	then by a digression at the clause, "keep thyself pure,"
	guarded against an ascetical error of Timothy in fancying purity
	consisted in asceticism, and having exhorted him to use wine for
	strengthening him in his work, he returns to the subject of his being
	vigorous as an overseer in rebuking sin, whether in presbyters
	or people, and in avoiding participation in men's sins by ordaining
	ungodly candidates. He says, therefore, there are two classes of
	sins, as there are two classes of good works: those
	palpably manifest, and those not so; the former are those on
	which thou shouldest act decidedly at once when called on, whether to
	rebuke in general, or to ordain ministers in particular; as to the
	latter, the final judgment alone can decide; however hidden
	now they "cannot be hid" then. This could only be said of
	the final judgment (1 Corinthians 4:5;
	therefore, ALFORD'S
	reference of this verse to Timothy's judgment in choosing
	elders must be wrong); all judgments before then are fallible. Thus
	he implies that Timothy can only be responsible if he connive at
	manifest, or evident sins; not that those that are
	otherwise shall escape judgment at last: just as in the case of
	good works, he can only be responsible for taking into account
	in his judgments those which are patent to all, not those secret good
	works which nevertheless will not remain hidden at the final
	judgment.
