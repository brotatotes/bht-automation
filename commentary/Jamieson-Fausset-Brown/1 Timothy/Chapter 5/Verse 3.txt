	church roll, as fit objects of charitable sustenance (1 Timothy 5:9;
	1 Timothy 5:17; 1 Timothy 5:18;
	Acts 6:1). So "honor" is
	used for support with necessaries (Matthew 15:4;
	Matthew 15:6; Acts 28:10).
	widows indeed— (Acts 28:10- :). Those really desolate; not like those (Acts 28:10- :) having children or relations answerable for their support,

	live in pleasure"; but such as, from their earthly desolation as
	to friends, are most likely to trust wholly in God, persevere in
	continual prayers, and carry out the religious duties assigned to
	Church widows (1 Timothy 5:5). Care
	for widows was transferred from the Jewish economy to the Christian
	(Deuteronomy 14:29; Deuteronomy 16:11;
	Deuteronomy 24:17; Deuteronomy 24:19).
