<p><b>widows indeed</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:10- :">Acts 28:10- :</span>). Those really desolate; not like those (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:10- :">Acts 28:10- :</span>) having children or relations answerable for their support,
	nor like those (in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:6">1 Timothy 5:6</span>) "who
	live in pleasure"; but such as, from their earthly desolation as
	to friends, are most likely to trust wholly in God, persevere in
	continual prayers, and carry out the religious duties assigned to
	Church widows (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:5">1 Timothy 5:5</span>). Care
	for widows was transferred from the Jewish economy to the Christian
