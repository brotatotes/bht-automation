<p><b>4. if any widow have children</b>—not
	"a widow indeed," as having children who ought to support
	her. 
	</p>
<p><b>nephews</b>—rather, as
	<i>Greek,</i> "descendants," or "grandchildren"
	[HESYCHIUS]. "Nephews"
	in <i>old</i> English meant "grandchildren" [HOOKER,
	<i>Ecclesiastical Polity,</i> 5.20]. 
	</p>
<p><b>let them</b>—the children
	and descendants. 
	</p>
<p><b>learn first</b>—ere it
	falls to the Church to support them. 
	</p>
<p><b>to show piety at home</b>—filial
	piety towards their widowed mother or grandmother, by giving her
	sustenance. Literally, "to show piety towards <i>their own
	house.</i>" "Piety is applied to the reverential discharge
	of filial duties; as the parental relation is the earthly
	representation of God our heavenly Father's relation to us. "<i>Their
	own</i>" stands in opposition to <i>the Church,</i> in relation
	to which the widow is comparatively a stranger. She has a claim on
	<i>her own</i> children, prior to her claim on the Church; let them
	fulfil this prior claim which she has on them, by sustaining her and
	not burdening the Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>parents</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	(living) "progenitors," that is, their mother or
	grandmother, as the case may be. "Let them learn," implies
	that abuses of this kind had crept into the Church, widows claiming
	Church support though they had children or grandchildren able to
	support them. 
	</p>
<p><b>good and</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts omit. The words are probably inserted by a transcriber
	from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:3">1 Timothy 2:3</span>.</p>
