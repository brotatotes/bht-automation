<p><b>5. widow indeed, and
	desolate</b>—contrasted with her who has children or grandchildren
	to support her (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:4">1 Timothy 5:4</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>trusteth in God</b>—perfect
	tense in <i>Greek,</i> "hath rested, and doth rest her hope in
	God." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:5">1 Timothy 5:5</span> <i>adds
	another</i> qualification in a widow for Church maintenance, besides
	her being" desolate" or destitute of children to support
	her. She must be not one "that liveth in pleasure" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:5- :">1 Timothy 5:5- :</span>), but one making God her main hope (the accusative in <i>Greek</i>
	expresses that God is <i>the ultimate aim whereto</i> her hope is
	<i>directed;</i> whereas, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:10">1 Timothy 4:10</span>,
	dative expresses hope <i>resting on</i> God as her present stay
	[WIESINGER]), and
	continuing constantly in prayers. Her destitution of children and of
	all ties to earth would leave her more unencumbered for devoting the
	rest of her days to God and the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:33">1 Corinthians 7:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:34">1 Corinthians 7:34</span>). Compare also "Anna
	a widow," who remained unmarried after her husband's death and
	"departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and
	prayers day and night" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:36">Luke 2:36</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:37">Luke 2:37</span>). Such a one, Paul
	implies, would be the fittest object for the Church's help (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:37- :">Luke 2:37- :</span>); for such a one is promoting the cause of Christ's Church by
	her prayers for it. "Ardor in prayers flows from hoping
	confidence in God" [LEO].

<p><b>in supplications and
	prayers</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "in <i>her</i> supplications and
	prayers"; the former signifies <i>asking under a sense of need,</i>
	the latter, <i>prayer</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:37- :">Luke 2:37- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:37- :">Luke 2:37- :</span>).

<p><b>night and day</b>—another
	coincidence with Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:7">Luke 18:7</span>,
	"cry day and night"); contrast Satan's accusations "day
	and night" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:10">Revelation 12:10</span>).</p>
