<p><b>8. But</b>—reverting to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "If any (a general proposition; therefore including in
	its application <i>the widow's children or grandchildren</i>) provide
	not for his own (relations in general), and especially for those of
	his own house (in particular), he hath (practically) denied the
	faith." Faith without love and its works is dead; "for the
	subject matter of faith is not mere opinion, but the grace and truth
	of God, to which he that believes gives up his spirit, as he that
	loves gives up his heart" [MACK].
	If in any case a duty of love is plain, it is in relation to one's
	own relatives; to fail in so plain an obligation is a plain proof of
	want of love, and therefore of want of faith. "Faith does not
	set aside natural duties, but strengthens them" [BENGEL].

<p><b>worse than an infidel</b>—because
	even an infidel (or unbeliever) is taught by nature to provide for
	his own relatives, and generally recognizes the duty; the Christian
	who does not so, is worse (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:46">Matthew 5:46</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:47">Matthew 5:47</span>). He has less excuse
	with his greater light than the infidel who may break the laws of
	nature.</p>
