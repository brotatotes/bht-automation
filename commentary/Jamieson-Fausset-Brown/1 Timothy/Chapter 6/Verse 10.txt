	money itself, but the love of it—the wishing to be rich
	(1 Timothy 6:9) —"is a
	root (ELLICOTT and
	MIDDLETON: not as English

	prosperity of fools destroys them" (1 Timothy 4:1- :). BENGEL and
	WIESINGER make them the
	gnawings of conscience, producing remorse for wealth badly acquired;
	the harbingers of the future "perdition" (1 Timothy 4:1- :).
