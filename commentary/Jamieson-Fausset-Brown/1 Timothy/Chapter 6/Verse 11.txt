<p><b>11. But thou</b>—in contrast to
	the "some" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10">1 Timothy 6:10</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>man of God</b>—who hast God
	as thy true riches (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:1">Genesis 15:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:5">Psalms 16:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="la+3:24">Lamentations 3:24</span>).
	Applying primarily to Timothy as a minister (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="la+3:24- :">Lamentations 3:24- :</span>), just as the term was used of Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="la+3:24- :">Lamentations 3:24- :</span>), Samuel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:6">1 Samuel 9:6</span>),
	Elijah, and Elisha; but, as the exhortation is as to duties <i>incumbent
	also on all Christians,</i> the term applies secondarily to him (so
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:17">2 Timothy 3:17</span>) as a Christian man
	<i>born of God</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:1">1 John 5:1</span>), no longer a <i>man of
	the world</i> raised above earthly things; therefore, God's property,
	not his own, bought with a price, and so having parted with all right
	in himself: Christ's work is to be <i>his</i> great work: he is to be
	Christ's living representative. 
	</p>
<p><b>flee these things</b>—namely,
	"the love of money" with its evil results (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:9">1 Timothy 6:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10">1 Timothy 6:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>follow after righteousness</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22">2 Timothy 2:22</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>godliness</b>—"piety."
	<i>Righteousness</i> is more in relation to our fellow man; <i>piety</i>
	("godliness") to God"; <i>faith</i> is the root of
	both (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22- :">2 Timothy 2:22- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>love</b>—by which "faith
	worketh." 
	</p>
<p><b>patience</b>—<i>enduring
	perseverance</i> amidst trials. 
	</p>
<p><b>meekness</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "meek-spiritedness," namely, towards the
	opponents of the Gospel.</p>
