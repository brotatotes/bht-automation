13. quickeneth all things—that
	is, "maketh alive." But the oldest manuscripts read,
	"preserveth alive"; as the same Greek means in  :-; compare Nehemiah 9:6. He
	urges Timothy to faithfulness here by the present manifestation of
	God's power in preserving all things, as in Nehemiah 9:6- :, by the future manifestation of God's power at the appearing
	of Christ. The assurance that "eternal life," Nehemiah 9:6- :, will be the result of "fighting the good fight,"
	rests on the fulness and power of Him who is the God of all life,
	present and to come. 
	witnessed—It was the
	Lord's part to witness, Timothy's part to confess (or
	"profess," 1 Timothy 6:12)
	"the good confession" [BENGEL].
	The confession was His testimony that He was King, and His
	kingdom that of the truth (see on 1 Timothy 6:12- :; 1 Timothy 6:15; Matthew 27:11).
	Christ, in attesting, or bearing witness to this truth, attested the
	truth of the whole of Christianity. Timothy's profession, or
	confession, included therefore the whole of the Christian
	truth.
