<p><b>13. quickeneth all things</b>—that
	is, "maketh alive." But the oldest manuscripts read,
	"preserveth alive"; as the same <i>Greek</i> means in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:6">Nehemiah 9:6</span>. He
	urges Timothy to faithfulness here by the present manifestation of
	God's power in preserving all things, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:6- :">Nehemiah 9:6- :</span>, by the future manifestation of God's power at the appearing
	of Christ. The assurance that "eternal life," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:6- :">Nehemiah 9:6- :</span>, will be the result of "fighting the good fight,"
	rests on the fulness and power of Him who is the God of all life,
	present and to come.

<p><b>witnessed</b>—It was the
	Lord's part to <i>witness,</i> Timothy's part to <i>confess</i> (or
	"profess," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span>)
	"<i>the</i> good confession" [BENGEL].
	<i>The</i> confession was His testimony that He was King, and His
	kingdom that of <i>the truth</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12- :">1 Timothy 6:12- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:15">1 Timothy 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:11">Matthew 27:11</span>).
	Christ, in attesting, or bearing witness to this truth, attested the
	truth of the whole of Christianity. Timothy's <i>profession,</i> or
	<i>confession,</i> included therefore the whole of the Christian
	truth.</p>
