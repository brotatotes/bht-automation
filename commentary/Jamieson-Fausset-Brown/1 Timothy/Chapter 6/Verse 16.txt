<p><b>16. Who only hath immortality</b>—in
	His own essence, not merely at the will of another, as all other
	immortal beings [JUSTIN
	MARTYR, <i>Quæst. ad
	Orthod.,</i> 61]. As He <i>hath immortality,</i> so will He give it
	to us who believe; to be out of Him is death. It is mere heathen
	philosophy that attributes to the soul indestructibility in itself,
	which is to be attributed solely to God's gift. As He hath life <i>in
	Himself,</i> so hath He given to the Son to have life <i>in Himself</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:26">John 5:26</span>). The term used in
	the New Testament for "immortal," which does not occur, is
	"incorruptible." "Immortality" is found in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:53">1 Corinthians 15:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:54">1 Corinthians 15:54</span>.

<p><b>dwelling in the light which
	no man can approach unto</b>—After <i>life</i> comes mention of
	<i>light,</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>.
	That <i>light</i> is <i>unapproachable</i> to creatures, except in so
	far as they are admitted by Him, and as He goes forth to them
	[BENGEL]. It is
	<i>unapproachable</i> on account of its exceeding brightness
	[THEOPHYLACT]. If one
	cannot gaze steadfastly at the sun, which is but a small part of
	creation, by reason of its exceeding heat and power, how much less
	can mortal man gaze at the inexpressible glory of God [THEOPHYLACT,
	<i>To Autolycus</i>] (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:2">Psalms 104:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>no man hath seen</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+23:20">Exodus 23:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:12">1 John 4:12</span>). Perhaps even in the
	perfect state no creature shall fully see God. Still the saints
	shall, in some sense, have the blessedness of <i>seeing</i> Him,
	which is denied to mere <i>man</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:8">Matthew 5:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>;
