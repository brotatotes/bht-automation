16. Who only hath immortality—in
	His own essence, not merely at the will of another, as all other
	immortal beings [JUSTIN
	MARTYR, Quæst. ad
	Orthod., 61]. As He hath immortality, so will He give it
	to us who believe; to be out of Him is death. It is mere heathen
	philosophy that attributes to the soul indestructibility in itself,
	which is to be attributed solely to God's gift. As He hath life in
	Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself
	(John 5:26). The term used in
	the New Testament for "immortal," which does not occur, is
	"incorruptible." "Immortality" is found in
	1 Corinthians 15:53; 1 Corinthians 15:54.
	dwelling in the light which
	no man can approach unto—After life comes mention of
	light, as in John 1:4.
	That light is unapproachable to creatures, except in so
	far as they are admitted by Him, and as He goes forth to them
	[BENGEL]. It is
	unapproachable on account of its exceeding brightness
	[THEOPHYLACT]. If one
	cannot gaze steadfastly at the sun, which is but a small part of
	creation, by reason of its exceeding heat and power, how much less
	can mortal man gaze at the inexpressible glory of God [THEOPHYLACT,
	To Autolycus] (Psalms 104:2;
	1 John 1:5). 
	no man hath seen—
	(Exodus 23:20; John 1:18;
	Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 11:27;
	1 John 4:12). Perhaps even in the
	perfect state no creature shall fully see God. Still the saints
	shall, in some sense, have the blessedness of seeing Him,
	which is denied to mere man (Matthew 5:8;
	1 Corinthians 13:12; 1 John 3:2;
	Revelation 22:4).
