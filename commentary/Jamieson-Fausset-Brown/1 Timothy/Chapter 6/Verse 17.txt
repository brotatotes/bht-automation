<p><b>17.</b> Resuming the subject from
	above, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:5">1 Timothy 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10">1 Timothy 6:10</span>.
	The immortality of God, alone rich in glory, and of His people
	through Him, is opposed to the lust of money (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10- :">1 Timothy 6:10- :</span>). From speaking of the <i>desire</i> to be rich, he here
	passes to those who <i>are</i> rich: (1) What ought to be their
	disposition; (2) What use they ought to make of their riches, and,
	(3) The consequences of their so using them. 
	</p>
<p><b>rich in this world</b>—contrasted
	with the riches of the future kingdom to be the portion of believers
	at Christ's "appearing," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10- :">1 Timothy 6:10- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>high-minded</b>—often the
	character of the rich (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10- :">1 Timothy 6:10- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>trust</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "to
	have their trust resting." 
	</p>
<p><b>in . . . in</b>—rather,
	"upon . . . upon," as the oldest manuscripts. 
	</p>
<p><b>uncertain riches</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "the <i>uncertainty</i> of riches." They
	who rest their trust on riches, rest trust on <i>uncertainty</i>
	itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+23:5">Proverbs 23:5</span>). Now they
	belong to one person, now to another, and that which has many masters
	is possessed by none [THEODORET].
	</p>
<p><b>living God</b>—The best
	manuscripts and versions omit "living." He who trusts in
	riches transfers to them the duty he owes to God [CALVIN].
	</p>
<p><b>who giveth</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"affordeth." 
	</p>
<p><b>all things richly</b>—temporal
	and eternal, for the body and for the soul. In order to be truly
	rich, seek to be blessed of, and in, God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:22">Proverbs 10:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:3">2 Peter 1:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>to enjoy</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"for enjoyment." Not that the heart may cleave to them as
	its idol and <i>trust</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>).
	<i>Enjoyment</i> consists in giving, not in holding fast.
	Non-employment should be far removed, as from man, so from his
	resources (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:2">James 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:3">James 5:3</span>)
	[BENGEL].</p>
