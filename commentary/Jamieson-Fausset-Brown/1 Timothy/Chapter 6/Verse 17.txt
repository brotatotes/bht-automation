17. Resuming the subject from
	above, 1 Timothy 6:5; 1 Timothy 6:10.
	The immortality of God, alone rich in glory, and of His people
	through Him, is opposed to the lust of money (compare 1 Timothy 6:10- :). From speaking of the desire to be rich, he here
	passes to those who are rich: (1) What ought to be their
	disposition; (2) What use they ought to make of their riches, and,
	(3) The consequences of their so using them. 
	rich in this world—contrasted
	with the riches of the future kingdom to be the portion of believers
	at Christ's "appearing," 1 Timothy 6:10- :. 
	high-minded—often the
	character of the rich (see 1 Timothy 6:10- :). 
	trust—Greek, "to
	have their trust resting." 
	in . . . in—rather,
	"upon . . . upon," as the oldest manuscripts. 
	uncertain riches—rather
	as Greek, "the uncertainty of riches." They
	who rest their trust on riches, rest trust on uncertainty
	itself (Proverbs 23:5). Now they
	belong to one person, now to another, and that which has many masters
	is possessed by none [THEODORET].
	living God—The best
	manuscripts and versions omit "living." He who trusts in
	riches transfers to them the duty he owes to God [CALVIN].
	who giveth—Greek,
	"affordeth." 
	all things richly—temporal
	and eternal, for the body and for the soul. In order to be truly
	rich, seek to be blessed of, and in, God (Proverbs 10:22;
	2 Peter 1:3). 
	to enjoy—Greek,
	"for enjoyment." Not that the heart may cleave to them as
	its idol and trust (1 Timothy 4:3).
	Enjoyment consists in giving, not in holding fast.
	Non-employment should be far removed, as from man, so from his
	resources (James 5:2; James 5:3)
