<p><b>19. Laying up in store</b>—"therefrom
	(that is, by this means [ALFORD];
	but BENGEL makes the <i>Greek</i>
	"<i>apo</i>" mean laying apart <i>against a future time</i>),
	laying up for themselves as a treasure" [ALFORD]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:19">Matthew 6:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:20">Matthew 6:20</span>).
	This is a treasure which we act wisely in <i>laying up in store,</i>
	whereas the wisest thing we can do with earthly treasures is "to
	distribute" them and give others a share of them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:20- :">Matthew 6:20- :</span>).

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>). The sure reversion of
	the future heavenly inheritance: earthly riches <i>scattered</i> in
	faith lay up in store a sure <i>increase</i> of heavenly riches. We
	gather by scattering (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+11:24">Proverbs 11:24</span>;

<p><b>that . . . eternal life</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts and versions read, "<i>that which is really
	life,</i>" its joys being solid and enduring (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:9- :">Luke 16:9- :</span>). The life that now is cannot be called so, its goods being
	unsubstantial, and itself a vapor (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:9- :">Luke 16:9- :</span>). "In order that ('with their feet so to speak on this
	foundation' [DE WETTE])
	they may lay hold on that which is life indeed."</p>
