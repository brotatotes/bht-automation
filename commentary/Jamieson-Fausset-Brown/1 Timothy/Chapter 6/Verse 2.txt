2. And—rather, "But."
	The opposition is between those Christian slaves under the yoke
	of heathen, and those that have believing masters (he does not
	use the phrase "under the yoke" in the latter case, for
	service under believers is not a yoke). Connect the following
	words thus, "Let them (the slaves) not, because they (the
	masters) are brethren (and so equals, masters and slaves alike
	being Christians), despise them (the masters)." 
	but rather, c.—"but
	all the more (so much the more: with the greater good will) do them
	service because they (the masters) are faithful (that is, believers)
	and beloved who receive (in the mutual interchange of relative
	duties between master and servant so the Greek) the benefit"
	(English Version violates Greek grammar). This latter
	clause is parallel to, "because they are brethren"; which
	proves that "they" refers to the masters, not the
	servants, as TITTMANN
	takes it, explaining the verb in the common sense (Luke 1:54;
	Acts 20:35), "who sedulously
	labor for their (masters') benefit." The very term "benefit"
	delicately implies service done with the right motive,
	Christian "good will" (Acts 20:35- :). If the common sense of the Greek verb be urged, the
	sense must be, "Because they (the masters) are faithful and
	beloved who are sedulously intent on the benefiting" of
	their servants. But PORPHYRY
	[On Abstinence, 1.46] justifies the sense of the Greek
	verb given above, which also better accords with the context; for
	otherwise, the article "the," will have nothing in
	the preceding words to explain it, whereas in my explanation above
	"the benefit" will be that of the slaves' service.
These things teach—
