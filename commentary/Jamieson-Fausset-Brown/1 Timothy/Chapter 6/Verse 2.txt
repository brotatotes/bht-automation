<p><b>2. And</b>—rather, "But."
	The opposition is between those Christian slaves <i>under the yoke</i>
	of heathen, and <i>those that have believing masters</i> (he does not
	use the phrase "under the yoke" in the latter case, for
	service under believers is not a <i>yoke</i>). Connect the following
	words thus, "Let them (the slaves) not, because they (the
	masters) are brethren (and so <i>equals,</i> masters and slaves alike
	being Christians), despise them (the masters)." 
	</p>
<p><b>but rather,</b> c.—"but
	all the more (so much the more: with the greater good will) do them
	service because they (the masters) are faithful (that is, believers)
	and beloved who receive (in the mutual <i>interchange</i> of relative
	duties between master and servant so the <i>Greek</i>) the benefit"
	(<i>English Version</i> violates <i>Greek</i> grammar). This latter
	clause is parallel to, "because they are brethren"; which
	proves that "they" refers to the <i>masters,</i> not the
	<i>servants,</i> as TITTMANN
	takes it, explaining the verb in the common sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:54">Luke 1:54</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span>), "who <i>sedulously
	labor for</i> their (masters') benefit." The very term "benefit"
	delicately implies service done with the right <i>motive,</i>
	Christian "good will" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35- :">Acts 20:35- :</span>). If the common sense of the <i>Greek</i> verb be urged, the
	sense must be, "Because they (the masters) are faithful and
	beloved who <i>are sedulously intent on the benefiting</i>" of
	their servants. But PORPHYRY
	[<i>On Abstinence,</i> 1.46] justifies the sense of the <i>Greek</i>
	verb given above, which also better accords with the context; for
	otherwise, the article "<i>the,</i>" will have nothing in
	the preceding words to explain it, whereas in my explanation above
	"<i>the</i> benefit" will be that of the slaves' <i>service.</i>
