<p><b>20, 21.</b> Recapitulatory
	conclusion: the main aim of the whole Epistle being here summarily
	stated. 
	</p>
<p><b>O Timothy</b>—a personal
	appeal, marking at once his affection for Timothy, and his prescience
	of the coming heresies. 
	</p>
<p><b>keep</b>—from spiritual
	thieves, and from enemies who will, while men sleep, sow tares amidst
	the good seed sown by the Son of man. 
	</p>
<p><b>that which is committed to
	thy trust</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "the deposit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:14">2 Timothy 1:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:2">2 Timothy 2:2</span>). "<i>The true</i>"
	or "<i>sound doctrine</i>" to be taught, as opposed to "<i>the
	science falsely</i> so <i>called,</i>" which leads to "<i>error
	concerning the faith</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:2- :">2 Timothy 2:2- :</span>). "It is not thine: it is another's property with which
	thou hast been entrusted: Diminish it not at all" [CHRYSOSTOM].
	"That which was entrusted to thee, not found by thee; which thou
	hast received, not invented; a matter not of genius, but of teaching;
	not of private usurpation, but of public tradition; a matter brought
	to thee, not put forth by thee, in which thou oughtest to be not an
	enlarger, but a guardian; not an originator, but a disciple; not
	leading, but following. 'Keep,' saith he, 'the deposit,'; preserve
	intact and inviolate the talent of the catholic faith. What has been
	entrusted to thee, let that same remain with thee; let that same be
	handed down by thee. Gold thou hast received, gold return. I should
	be sorry thou shouldest substitute aught else. I should be sorry that
	for gold thou shouldest substitute lead impudently, or brass
	fraudulently. I do not want the mere appearance of gold, but its
	actual reality. Not that there is to be no progress in religion in
	Christ's Church. Let there be so by all means, and the greatest
	progress; but then let it be real progress, not a change of the
	faith. Let the intelligence of the whole Church and its individual
	members increase exceedingly, provided it be only in its own kind,
	the doctrine being still the same. Let the religion of the soul
	resemble the growth of the body,which, though it develops its several
	parts in the progress of years, yet remains the same as it was
	essentially" [VINCENTIUS
	LIRINENSIS, A.D.
	434].

<p><b>avoiding</b>—"turning
	away from" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:4">2 Timothy 3:4</span>).
	Even as they have "turned away from the truth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:6">1 Timothy 1:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:15">1 Timothy 5:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:4">2 Timothy 4:4</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>profane</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:7">1 Timothy 4:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:16">2 Timothy 2:16</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>vain</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"empty": mere "strifes of words," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:16- :">2 Timothy 2:16- :</span>, producing no moral fruit. 
	</p>
<p><b>oppositions</b>—dialectic
	antithesis of the false teachers [ALFORD].
	WIESINGER, not so
	probably, "oppositions to the sound doctrine." I think it
	likely germs existed already of the heresy of dualistic oppositions,
	namely, between the good and evil principle, afterwards fully
	developed in Gnosticism. Contrast Paul's just antithesis (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:5">1 Timothy 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:6">1 Timothy 6:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:15-23">2 Timothy 2:15-23</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>science falsely so
	called</b>—where there is not faith, there is not knowledge
	[CHRYSOSTOM]. There was
	true "knowledge," a special gift of the Spirit, which was
	abused by some (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8">1 Corinthians 12:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:6">1 Corinthians 14:6</span>). This gift was soon
	counterfeited by false teachers arrogating to themselves
	pre-eminently the gift (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>).
	Hence arose the creeds of the Church, called <i>symbols,</i> that is,
	in <i>Greek,</i> "watchwords," or a test whereby the
	orthodox might distinguish one another in opposition to the
	heretical. Perhaps here, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:20">1 Timothy 6:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:14">2 Timothy 1:14</span>,
	imply the existence of some such brief formula of doctrine then
	existing in the Church; if so, we see a good reason for its not being
	written in Scripture, which is designed not to give dogmatic
	formularies, but to be the fountain whence all such formularies are
	to be drawn according to the exigencies of the several churches and
	ages. Probably thus a portion of the so-called apostle's creed may
	have had their sanction, and been preserved solely by tradition on
	this account. "The creed, handed down from the apostles, is not
	written on paper and with ink, but on fleshy tables of the heart"
	JEROME [<i>Against John of
	Jerusalem,</i> 9]. Thus, in the creed, contrary to the "oppositions"
	(the germs of which probably existed in the Church in Paul's latter
	days) whereby the aeons were <i>set off</i> in pairs, God is stated
	to be "the Father Almighty," or <i>all-governing</i> "maker
	of heaven and earth" [BISHOP
	HINDS].</p>
