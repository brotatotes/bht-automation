<p><b>5. Perverse disputings</b>—useless
	disputings. The oldest manuscripts read, "lasting contests"
	[WIESINGER]; "incessant
	collisions" [ALFORD].
	"Strifes of words" had already been mentioned so that he
	would not be likely to repeat the same idea (as in the <i>English
	Version</i> reading) again.

<p><b>corrupt minds</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"of men corrupted (depraved) in mind." The inmost source of
	the evil is in the perverted mind (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:4">1 Timothy 6:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:8">2 Timothy 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:15">Titus 1:15</span>).

<p><b>destitute of the truth</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:14">Titus 1:14</span>). They had had the
	truth, but through want of moral integrity and of love of the truth,
	they were misled by a pretended deeper gnosis (knowledge) and higher
	ascetical holiness, of which they made a trade [WIESINGER].

<p><b>supposing,</b> c.—The <i>Greek</i>
	requires, "supposing (regarding the matter in this point of
	view) that piety (so translated for 'godliness') is a means of gain
	(that is, a way of advancing one's worldly interests: a different
	<i>Greek</i> form, <i>poriswa,</i> expresses <i>the thing gained,
	gain</i>)" not "that gain is godliness," as <i>English
	Version.</i>

<p><b>from such withdraw
	thyself</b>—omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The connection with
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:6">1 Timothy 6:6</span> favors the omission of
	these words, which interrupt the connection.</p>
