6. Butâ€”Though they err in
	this, there is a sense in which "piety is" not merely gain,
	but "great means of gain": not the gaining
	which they pursue, and which makes men to be discontented with
	their present possessions, and to use religion as "a cloak of
	covetousness" (1 Thessalonians 2:5) and
	means of earthly gain, but the present and eternal gain
	which piety, whose accompaniment is contentment,
	secures to the soul. WIESINGER
	remarks that Paul observed in Timothy a tendency to indolence and
	shrinking from the conflict, whence he felt (1 Thessalonians 2:5- :) that Timothy needed cautioning against such temptation;
	compare also the second Epistle. Not merely contentment is
	great gain (a sentiment of the heathen CICERO
	[Paradox 6], "the greatest and surest riches"), but
	"piety with contentment"; for piety not only feels no need
	of what it has not, but also has that which exalts it above what it
	has not [WIESINGER]. The
	Greek for contentment is translated "sufficiency"
	(2 Corinthians 9:8). But the adjective
	(Philippians 4:11) "content";
	literally, "having a sufficiency in one's self"
	independent of others. "The Lord always supplies His people with
	what is necessary for them. True happiness lies in piety, but this
	sufficiency [supplied by God, with which moreover His people
	are content] is thrown into the scale as a kind of overweight"
	[CALVIN] (1 Kings 17:1-16;
	Psalms 37:19; Isaiah 33:6;
	Isaiah 33:16; Jeremiah 37:21).
