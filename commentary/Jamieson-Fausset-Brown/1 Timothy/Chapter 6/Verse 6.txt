<p><b>6. But</b>â€”Though they err in
	this, there is a sense in which "piety is" not merely gain,
	but "<i>great</i> means of gain": not the <i>gaining</i>
	which they pursue, and which makes men to be <i>discontented</i> with
	their present possessions, and to use religion as "a cloak of
	covetousness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:5">1 Thessalonians 2:5</span>) and
	<i>means of earthly gain,</i> but <i>the present and eternal gain</i>
	which <i>piety,</i> whose accompaniment is <i>contentment,</i>
	secures to the soul. WIESINGER
	remarks that Paul observed in Timothy a tendency to indolence and
	shrinking from the conflict, whence he felt (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:5- :">1 Thessalonians 2:5- :</span>) that Timothy needed cautioning against such temptation;
	compare also the second Epistle. Not merely <i>contentment</i> is
	great gain (a sentiment of the heathen CICERO
	[<i>Paradox</i> 6], "the greatest and surest riches"), but
	"piety with contentment"; for piety not only feels no need
	of what it has not, but also has that which exalts it above what it
	has not [WIESINGER]. The
	<i>Greek</i> for <i>contentment</i> is translated "sufficiency"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:8">2 Corinthians 9:8</span>). But the adjective
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:11">Philippians 4:11</span>) "content";
	literally, "having a <i>sufficiency in one's self</i>"
	independent of others. "The Lord always supplies His people with
	what is necessary for them. True happiness lies in piety, but this
	<i>sufficiency</i> [supplied by God, with which moreover His people
	are <i>content</i>] is thrown into the scale as a kind of overweight"
