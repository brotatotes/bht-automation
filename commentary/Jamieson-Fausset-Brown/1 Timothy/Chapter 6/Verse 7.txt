<p><b>7. For</b>—confirming the
	reasonableness of "contentment." 
	</p>
<p><b>and it is certain</b>—<i>Vulgate</i>
	and other old versions support this reading. The oldest manuscripts,
	however, omit "and it is certain"; then the translation
	will be, "We brought nothing into the world (to teach us to
	remember) that neither can we carry anything out" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:21">Job 1:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+5:15">Ecclesiastes 5:15</span>). Therefore, we should
	have no gain-seeking anxiety, the breeder of discontent (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+5:15- :">Ecclesiastes 5:15- :</span>).</p>
