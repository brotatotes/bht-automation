<p><b>9. will be rich</b>—have more than
	"<i>food</i> and raiment." <i>Greek,</i> "<i>wish</i>
	to be rich"; not merely <i>are willing,</i> but are resolved,
	and earnestly <i>desire</i> to have riches at any cost (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+28:20">Proverbs 28:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+28:22">Proverbs 28:22</span>). This <i>wishing</i>
	(not the riches themselves) is fatal to "contentment" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+28:22- :">Proverbs 28:22- :</span>). Rich men are not told to cast away their riches, but not to
	"trust" in them, and to "do good" with them
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:17">1 Timothy 6:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:18">1 Timothy 6:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+62:10">Psalms 62:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>fall into temptation</b>—not
	merely "are exposed to temptation," but actually "<i>fall
	into</i>" it. The <i>falling into</i> it is what we are to pray
	against, "Lead us not into temptation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+62:10- :">Psalms 62:10- :</span>); such a one is already in a sinful state, even before any
	overt act of sin. The <i>Greek</i> for "temptation" and
	"gain" contains a play on sounds—<i>porasmus, peirasmus.</i>
</p>
<p><b>snare</b>—a further step
	downwards (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:7">1 Timothy 3:7</span>). He falls
	into "the snare of the devil." 
	</p>
<p><b>foolish</b>—irrational. 
	</p>
<p><b>hurtful</b>—to those who
	fall into the snare. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:7- :">1 Timothy 3:7- :</span>, "deceitful lusts" which deceive to one's deadly
	hurt. 
	</p>
<p><b>lusts</b>—With the one evil
	lust ("<i>wish</i> to be rich") many others join
	themselves: the one is the "root of all evils" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:7- :">1 Timothy 3:7- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>which</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"whatever (lusts)." 
	</p>
<p><b>drown</b>—an awful
	descending climax from "fall into"; this is the last step
	in the terrible descent (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:15">James 1:15</span>);
	translated "sink," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:7">Luke 5:7</span>.

<p><b>destruction . . .
	perdition</b>—<i>destruction</i> in general (temporal or eternal),
	and <i>perdition</i> in particular, namely, that of body and soul in
	hell.</p>
