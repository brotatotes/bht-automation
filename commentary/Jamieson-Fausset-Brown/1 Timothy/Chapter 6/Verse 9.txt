9. will be rich—have more than
	"food and raiment." Greek, "wish
	to be rich"; not merely are willing, but are resolved,
	and earnestly desire to have riches at any cost (Proverbs 28:20;
	Proverbs 28:22). This wishing
	(not the riches themselves) is fatal to "contentment" (Proverbs 28:22- :). Rich men are not told to cast away their riches, but not to
	"trust" in them, and to "do good" with them
	(1 Timothy 6:17; 1 Timothy 6:18;
	Psalms 62:10). 
	fall into temptation—not
	merely "are exposed to temptation," but actually "fall
	into" it. The falling into it is what we are to pray
	against, "Lead us not into temptation" (Psalms 62:10- :); such a one is already in a sinful state, even before any
	overt act of sin. The Greek for "temptation" and
	"gain" contains a play on sounds—porasmus, peirasmus.
snare—a further step
	downwards (1 Timothy 3:7). He falls
	into "the snare of the devil." 
	foolish—irrational. 
	hurtful—to those who
	fall into the snare. Compare 1 Timothy 3:7- :, "deceitful lusts" which deceive to one's deadly
	hurt. 
	lusts—With the one evil
	lust ("wish to be rich") many others join
	themselves: the one is the "root of all evils" (1 Timothy 3:7- :). 
	which—Greek,
	"whatever (lusts)." 
	drown—an awful
	descending climax from "fall into"; this is the last step
	in the terrible descent (James 1:15);
	translated "sink," Luke 5:7.
	destruction . . .
	perdition—destruction in general (temporal or eternal),
	and perdition in particular, namely, that of body and soul in
	hell.
