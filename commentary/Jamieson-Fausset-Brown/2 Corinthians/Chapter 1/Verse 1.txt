<p><b>1. Timothy our brother</b>—When
	writing <i>to</i> Timothy himself, he calls him "my son"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>). Writing <i>of</i>
	him, "brother," and "my beloved son" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18- :">1 Timothy 1:18- :</span>). He had been sent before to Macedonia, and had met Paul at
	Philippi, when the apostle passed over from Troas to Macedonia
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13">2 Corinthians 2:13</span>;
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13- :">2 Corinthians 2:13- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in all Achaia</b>—comprising
	Hellas and the Peloponnese. The Gentiles themselves, and Annæus
	Gallio, the proconsul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:13- :">2 Corinthians 2:13- :</span>), strongly testified their disapproval of the accusation
	brought by the Jews against Paul. Hence, the apostle was enabled to
	labor in the whole province of Achaia with such success as to
	establish several churches there (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:8">1 Thessalonians 1:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:4">2 Thessalonians 1:4</span>), where, writing from
	Corinth, he speaks of the "churches," namely, not only the
	Corinthian, but others also—Athens, Cenchrea, and, perhaps, Sicyon,
	Argos, &amp;c. He addresses "the Church in Corinth,"
	<i>directly,</i> and all "the saints" in the province,
	<i>indirectly.</i> In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:2">Galatians 1:2</span> all
	the "<i>churches</i>" are addressed <i>directly</i> in the
	same circular Epistle. Hence, here he does not say, <i>all the
	churches,</i> but "all the saints."</p>
