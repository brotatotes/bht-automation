<p><b>12. For</b>—reason why he may
	confidently look for their prayers for him. 
	</p>
<p><b>our rejoicing</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"our glorying." Not that he glories in the testimony of his
	conscience, as something <i>to boast of;</i> nay, this testimony is
	itself the thing <i>in which</i> his glorying consists. 
	</p>
<p><b>in simplicity</b>—Most of
	the oldest manuscripts read, "in holiness." <i>English
	Version</i> reading is perhaps a gloss from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> [ALFORD]. Some of
	the oldest manuscripts and versions, however, support it. 
	</p>
<p><b>godly sincerity</b>—literally,
	"sincerity of God"; that is, sincerity as in the presence
	of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:8">1 Corinthians 5:8</span>). We <i>glory</i>
	in this in spite of all our adversities. <i>Sincerity</i> in <i>Greek</i>
	implies the non-admixture of any foreign element. He had no sinister
	or selfish aims (as some insinuated) in failing to visit them as he
	had promised: such aims belonged to his adversaries, not to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:8- :">1 Corinthians 5:8- :</span>). "Fleshly wisdom" suggests tortuous and insincere
	courses; but the "grace of God," which influenced him by
	God's gifts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:3">Romans 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:15">Romans 15:15</span>),
	suggests holy straightforwardness and sincere faithfulness to
	promises (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:17-20">2 Corinthians 1:17-20</span>),
	even as God is faithful to His promises. The prudence which subserves
	selfish interests, or employs unchristian means, or relies on human
	means more than on the Divine Spirit, is "fleshly wisdom." 
	</p>
<p><b>in the world</b>—even in
	relation to the world at large, which is full of disingenuousness. 
	</p>
<p><b>more abundantly to you-ward</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:4">2 Corinthians 2:4</span>). His greater love to
	them would lead him to manifest, especially to them, proofs of his
	sincerity, which his less close connection with <i>the world</i> did
	not admit of his exhibiting towards it.</p>
