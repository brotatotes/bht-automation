<p><b>13.</b> We write none other things
	(in this Epistle) than what ye read (in my former Epistle [BENGEL];
	<i>present,</i> because the Epistle <i>continued still</i> to be read
	in the Church as an apostolic rule). CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON think Paul had
	been suspected of writing privately to some individuals in the Church
	in a different strain from that of his public letters; and
	translates, "I write nothing else to you but what ye read <i>openly</i>
	(the <i>Greek</i> meaning, 'ye <i>read aloud,</i>' namely, when
	Paul's Epistles were publicly read in the congregation, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); yea, and what you acknowledge <i>inwardly.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>or acknowledge</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"or even acknowledge." The <i>Greek</i> for "read"
	and for "acknowledge" are words kindred in sound and root.
	I would translate, "None other things than what ye know by
	reading (by comparing my former Epistle with my present Epistle), or
	even know as a matter of fact (namely, the consistency of my acts
	with my words)." 
	</p>
<p><b>even to the end</b>—of my
	life. Not excluding reference to <i>the day of the Lord</i> (end of
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:14">2 Corinthians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span>).</p>
