<p><b>14. in part</b>—In contrast to
	"even to the end": the testimony <i>of his life</i> was not
	yet completed [THEOPHYLACT
	and BENGEL]. Rather, "in
	part," that is, some of you, not all [GROTIUS,
	ALFORD]. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:5">2 Corinthians 2:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span>. The majority at
	Corinth had shown a willing compliance with Paul's directions in the
	first Epistle: but some were still refractory. Hence arises the
	difference of tone in different parts of this Epistle. See
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25- :">Romans 11:25- :</span>

<p><b>your rejoicing</b>—your
	subject of <i>glorying</i> or <i>boast.</i> "Are" (not
	merely <i>shall be</i>) implies the present recognition of one
	another as a subject of mutual <i>glorying:</i> that <i>glorying</i>
	being about to be realized in its fulness "in the day (of the
	coming) of the Lord Jesus."</p>
