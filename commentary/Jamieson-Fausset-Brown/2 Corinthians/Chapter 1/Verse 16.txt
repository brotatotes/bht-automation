	them <i>on the way</i> to Macedonia, as well as after having passed
	through it, must have reached the ears of the Corinthians in some way
	or otherâ€”perhaps in the lost Epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:18">1 Corinthians 4:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span>). The sense comes out
	more clearly in the <i>Greek</i> order, "By you to pass into
	Macedonia, and from Macedonia to come again unto you."</p>
