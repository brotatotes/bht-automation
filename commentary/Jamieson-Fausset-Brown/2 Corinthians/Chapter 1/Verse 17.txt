<p><b>17. use lightness</b>—Was I guilty
	of levity? namely, by promising more than I performed. 
	</p>
<p><b>or . . . according to the
	flesh, that with me there should be yea, yea . . . nay, nay?</b>—The
	"or" expresses a different alternative: Did I act with
	levity, or (on the other hand) do I purpose what I purpose like
	worldly (fleshly) men, so that my "yea" must at all costs
	be yea, and my "nay" nay [BENGEL,
	WINER, CALVIN],
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:7">Matthew 14:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:9">Matthew 14:9</span>)?
	The repetition of the "yea" and "nay" hardly
	agrees with ALFORD'S view,
	"What I purpose do I purpose according to the changeable
	purposes of the fleshly (worldly) man, that there may be with me the
	yea yea, and the nay nay (that is, both affirmation and negation
	concerning the same thing)?" The repetition will thus stand for
	the single yea and nay, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:37">Matthew 5:37</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:12">James 5:12</span>. But the latter passage
	implies that the double "yea" here is not equivalent to the
	single "yea": BENGEL'S
	view, therefore, seems preferable.</p>
