19. Proof of the
	unchangeableness of the doctrine from the unchangeableness of the
	subject of it, namely, Jesus Christ. He is called "the Son of
	God" to show the impossibility of change in One who is co-equal
	with God himself (compare 1 Samuel 15:29;
	Malachi 3:6). 
	by me . . . Silvanus and
	Timotheus—The Son of God, though preached by different
	preachers, was one and the same, unchangeable. Silvanus is
	contracted into Silas (Malachi 3:6- :; compare 1 Peter 5:12). 
	in him was yea—Greek,
	"is made yea in Him"; that is, our preaching of the
	Son of God is confirmed as true in Him (that is, through Him;
	through the miracles wherewith He has confirmed our preaching)
	[GROTIUS]; or rather, by
	the witness of the Spirit which He has given (2 Corinthians 1:21;
	2 Corinthians 1:22) and of which miracles
	were only one, and that a subordinate manifestation.
