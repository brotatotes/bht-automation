<p><b>19.</b> Proof of the
	unchangeableness of the doctrine from the unchangeableness of the
	subject of it, namely, Jesus Christ. He is called "the Son of
	God" to show the impossibility of change in One who is co-equal
	with God himself (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:29">1 Samuel 15:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:6">Malachi 3:6</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>by me . . . Silvanus and
	Timotheus</b>—The Son of God, though preached by different
	preachers, was one and the same, unchangeable. <i>Silvanus</i> is
	contracted into <i>Silas</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:6- :">Malachi 3:6- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:12">1 Peter 5:12</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in him was yea</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>is made</i> yea in Him"; that is, our preaching of the
	Son of God is confirmed as true in Him (that is, <i>through</i> Him;
	through the miracles wherewith He has confirmed our preaching)
	[GROTIUS]; or rather, by
	the witness of the Spirit which He has given (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:21">2 Corinthians 1:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:22">2 Corinthians 1:22</span>) and of which miracles
	were only one, and that a subordinate manifestation.</p>
