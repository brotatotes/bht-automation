<p><b>20.</b> Rather, How many soever be
	the promises of God, in Him is the "yea" ("<i>faithfulness
	in His word</i>": contrasted with the "yea and nay,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:19">2 Corinthians 1:19</span>, that is, <i>inconstancy
	as to one's word</i>).

<p><b>and in him Amen</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "<i>Wherefore through</i> Him is <i>the</i>
	Amen"; that is, In Him is <i>faithfulness</i> ("yea")
	to His word, "wherefore through Him" is the immutable
	verification of it ("Amen"). As "yea" is His
	<i>word,</i> so "Amen" is His <i>oath,</i> which makes our
	assurance of the fulfilment doubly sure. Compare "two immutable
	things (namely, His word and His oath) in which it was impossible for
	God to lie" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18">Hebrews 6:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:14">Revelation 3:14</span>). The whole range of Old
	Testament and New Testament promises are secure in their fulfilment
	for us in Christ.

<p><b>unto the glory of God by
	us</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "for glory unto God by us" (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:15">2 Corinthians 4:15</span>), that is, by our
	ministerial labors; by us His promises, and His unchangeable
	faithfulness to them, are proclaimed. CONYBEARE
	takes the "Amen" to be the Amen at the close of
	thanksgiving: but then "by us" would have to mean what it
	cannot mean here, "by us <i>and you.</i>"</p>
