<p><b>23. Moreover I</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"But <i>I</i> (for my part)," in contrast to GOD
	who hath assured us of <i>His</i> promises being hereafter fulfilled
	certainly (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:20-22">2 Corinthians 1:20-22</span>).

<p><b>call God</b>—the
	all-knowing One, who avenges wilful unfaithfulness to promises. 
	</p>
<p><b>for a record upon my soul</b>—As
	a witness <i>as to</i> the secret purposes of my soul, and a witness
	<i>against</i> it, if I lie (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:20-47.1.22- :">2 Corinthians 1:20-47.1.22- :</span>).

<p><b>to spare you</b>—in order
	not to come in a rebuking spirit, as I should have had to come to
	you, if I had come <i>then.</i>
</p>
<p><b>I came not as yet</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"no longer"; that is, I <i>gave up my purpose of then</i>
	visiting Corinth. He wished to give them time for repentance, that he
	might not have to use severity towards them. Hence he sent Titus
	before him. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:11">2 Corinthians 10:11</span>, which shows that his
	detractors represented him as threatening what he had not courage to
	perform (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:18">1 Corinthians 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:19">1 Corinthians 4:19</span>).</p>
