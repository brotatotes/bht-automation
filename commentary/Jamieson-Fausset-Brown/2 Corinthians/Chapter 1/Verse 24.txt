24. Not for thatâ€”that is, Not
	that. "Faith" is here emphatic. He had "dominion"
	or a right to control them in matters of discipline, but in
	matters of "faith" he was only a "fellow
	helper of their joy" (namely, in believing, Romans 15:13;
	Philippians 1:25). The Greek is,
	"Not that we lord it over your faith." This he adds
	to soften the magisterial tone of Philippians 1:25- :. His desire is to cause them not sorrow (2 Corinthians 2:1;
	2 Corinthians 2:2), but "joy."
	The Greek for "helpers" implies a mutual leaning,
	one on the other, like the mutually supporting buttresses of a sacred
	building. "By faith (2 Corinthians 2:2- :) ye stand"; therefore it is that I bestow such pains
	in "helping" your faith, which is the source of all true
	"joy" (Romans 15:13). I
	want nothing more, not to lord it over your faith.
