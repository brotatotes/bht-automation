<p><b>24. Not for that</b>â€”that is, Not
	that. "<i>Faith</i>" is here emphatic. He had "dominion"
	or a right to control them in matters of <i>discipline,</i> but in
	matters of "<i>faith</i>" he was only a "<i>fellow
	helper</i> of their joy" (namely, in believing, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:13">Romans 15:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:25">Philippians 1:25</span>). The <i>Greek</i> is,
	"Not that we <i>lord</i> it over your faith." This he adds
	to soften the magisterial tone of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:25- :">Philippians 1:25- :</span>. His desire is to cause them not <i>sorrow</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:1">2 Corinthians 2:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:2">2 Corinthians 2:2</span>), but "<i>joy.</i>"
	The <i>Greek</i> for "helpers" implies a mutual leaning,
	one on the other, like the mutually supporting buttresses of a sacred
	building. "By faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:2- :">2 Corinthians 2:2- :</span>) ye stand"; therefore it is that I bestow such pains
	in "helping" your faith, which is the source of all true
	"joy" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:13">Romans 15:13</span>). I
	want nothing more, not to <i>lord it over your faith.</i></p>
