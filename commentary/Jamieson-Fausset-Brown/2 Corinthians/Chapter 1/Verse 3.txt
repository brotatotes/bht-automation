<p><b>3.</b> This thanksgiving for his
	late deliverance forms a suitable introduction for conciliating their
	favorable reception of his reasons for not having fulfilled his
	promise of visiting them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>Father of mercies</b>—that
	is, the SOURCE of all
	mercies (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:17">James 1:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>).

<p><b>comfort</b>—which flows
	from His "mercies" experienced. Like a true man of faith,
	he mentions "mercies" and "comfort," before he
	proceeds to speak of <i>afflictions</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1- :">Romans 12:1- :</span>). The "tribulation" of believers is not
	inconsistent with God's mercy, and does not beget in them suspicion
	of it; nay, in the end they feel that He is "the God of ALL
	comfort," that is, who imparts <i>the only true and perfect</i>
	comfort <i>in every instance</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+146:3">Psalms 146:3</span>;
