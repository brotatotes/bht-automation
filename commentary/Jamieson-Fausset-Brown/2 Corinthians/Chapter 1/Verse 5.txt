5. sufferings—standing in
	contrast with "salvation" ( :-); as "tribulation" (distress of mind), with comfort
	or "consolation." 
	of Christ—Compare  :-. The sufferings endured, whether by Himself, or by
	His Church, with which He considers Himself identified (Matthew 25:40;
	Matthew 25:45; Acts 9:4;
	1 John 4:17-21). Christ calls
	His people's sufferings His own suffering: (1) because of the
	sympathy and mystical union between Him and us (Romans 8:17;
	1 Corinthians 4:10); (2) They are borne for
	His sake; (3) They tend to His glory (Ephesians 4:1;
	1 Peter 4:14; 1 Peter 4:16).
	abound in us—Greek,
	"abound unto us." The order of the Greek
	following words is more forcible than in English Version,
	"Even so through Christ aboundeth also our comfort." The
	sufferings (plural) are many; but the consolation
	(though singular) swallows up them all. Comfort preponderates in this
	Epistle above that in the first Epistle, as now by the effect of the
	latter most of the Corinthians had been much impressed.
