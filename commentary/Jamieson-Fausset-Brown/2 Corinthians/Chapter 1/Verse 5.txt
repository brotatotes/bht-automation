<p><b>5. sufferings</b>—standing in
	contrast with "salvation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); as "tribulation" (distress of mind), with <i>comfort</i>

<p><b>of Christ</b>—Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The <i>sufferings</i> endured, whether by Himself, or by
	His Church, with which He considers Himself identified (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40">Matthew 25:40</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:45">Matthew 25:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:4">Acts 9:4</span>;

	His people's sufferings His own suffering: (1) because of the
	sympathy and mystical union between Him and us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:10">1 Corinthians 4:10</span>); (2) They are borne for
	His sake; (3) They tend to His glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>;

<p><b>abound in us</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"abound <i>unto</i> us." The order of the <i>Greek</i>
	following words is more forcible than in <i>English Version,</i>
	"Even so through Christ aboundeth also our comfort." The
	<i>sufferings</i> (plural) are many; but the <i>consolation</i>
	(though singular) swallows up them all. Comfort preponderates in this
	Epistle above that in the first Epistle, as now by the effect of the
	latter most of the Corinthians had been much impressed.</p>
