<p><b>6. we . . . afflicted . . . for your
	consolation</b>—exemplifying the communion of saints. Their hearts
	were, so to speak, mirrors reflecting the likenesses of each other
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:26">Philippians 2:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:27">Philippians 2:27</span>)
	[BENGEL]. Alike the
	afflictions and the consolations of the apostle tend, as in him so in
	them, as having communion with him, to their consolation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:4">2 Corinthians 1:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:15">2 Corinthians 4:15</span>). The <i>Greek</i> for
	"afflicted" is the same as before, and ought to be
	translated, "Whether we <i>be in tribulation.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>which is effectual</b>—literally,
	"worketh effectually." 
	</p>
<p><b>in the enduring,</b> &amp;c.—that
	is, in enabling you to endure "the same sufferings which we also
	suffer." Here follows, in the oldest manuscripts (not as <i>English
	Version</i> in the beginning of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:15- :">2 Corinthians 4:15- :</span>), the clause, "And our hope is steadfast on your
	behalf."</p>
