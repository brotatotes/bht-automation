<p><b>8, 9.</b> Referring to the imminent
	risk of life which he ran in Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) when the whole multitude were wrought up to fury by
	Demetrius, on the plea of Paul and his associates having assailed the
	religion of Diana of Ephesus. The words (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "we had the sentence of death in ourselves,"
	mean, that <i>he looked upon himself as a man condemned to die</i>
	[PALEY]. ALFORD
	thinks the danger at Ephesus was comparatively so slight that it
	cannot be supposed to be the subject of reference here, without
	exposing the apostle to a charge of cowardice, very unlike his
	fearless character; hence, he supposes Paul refers to some deadly
	<i>sickness</i> which he had suffered under (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:9">2 Corinthians 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:10">2 Corinthians 1:10</span>). But there is little
	doubt that, had Paul been found by the mob in the excitement, he
	would have been torn in pieces; and probably, besides what Luke in
	Acts records, there were other dangers of an equally distressing
	kind, such as, "lyings in wait of the Jews" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:10- :">2 Corinthians 1:10- :</span>), his ceaseless foes. They, doubtless, had incited the
	multitude at Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:9">Acts 19:9</span>),
	and were the chief of the "many adversaries" and "[wild]
	beasts," which he had to fight with there (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:32">1 Corinthians 15:32</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:9">1 Corinthians 16:9</span>). His weak state of
	health at the time combined with all this to make him regard himself
	as all but dead (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:29">2 Corinthians 11:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10">2 Corinthians 12:10</span>). What makes my
	supposition probable is, that the very cause of his not having
	visited Corinth directly as he had intended, and for which he
	proceeds to apologize (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10- :">2 Corinthians 12:10- :</span>), was, that there might be time to see whether the evils
	arising there not only from Greek, but from <i>Jewish</i> disturbers
	of the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:29">2 Corinthians 11:29</span>),
	would be checked by his first Epistle; there not being fully so was
	what entailed on him the need of writing this second Epistle. His not
	specifying this here <i>expressly</i> is just what we might expect in
	the outset of this letter; towards the close, when he had won their
	favorable hearing by a kindly and firm tone, he gives a more distinct
	reference to Jewish agitators (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:29- :">2 Corinthians 11:29- :</span>).

<p><b>above strength</b>—that is,
	ordinary, natural powers of endurance. 
	</p>
<p><b>despaired</b>—as far as
	human help or hope from man was concerned. But in respect to help
	from God we were "not in despair" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:29- :">2 Corinthians 11:29- :</span>).</p>
