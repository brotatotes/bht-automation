<p><b>1. I Paul myself</b>—no longer
	"we," "us," "our" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): <i>I</i> who am represented by depreciators as "base,"
	I, the same Paul, <i>of my own accord</i> "beseech you"; or
	rather "entreat," "exhort" you <i>for your sake.</i>
	As "I beseech you" (a distinct <i>Greek</i> verb, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) <i>for my sake.</i>
</p>
<p><b>by the meekness and
	gentleness of Christ</b>—He mentions these graces of Christ
	especially (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:35">Psalms 18:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>),
	as on account of his imitation of them in particular he was despised
	[GROTIUS]. He entreats
	them by these, in order to show that though he must have recourse to
	more severe measures, he is naturally inclined to gentle ones after
	Christ's example [MENOCHIUS].
	"Meekness" is more in the mind internally; "gentleness"
	in the external behavior, and in relation to others; for instance,
	the condescending <i>yieldingness</i> of a superior to an inferior,
	the former not insisting on his strict rights [TRENCH].
	BENGEL explains it, "By
	the meekness and gentleness <i>derived by me from Christ,</i>"
	not from my own nature: he objects to understanding it of <i>Christ's</i>
	meekness and gentleness, since nowhere else is "gentleness"
	attributed to Him. But though the exact <i>Greek</i> word is not
	applied to Him, the idea expressed by it is (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:11">Isaiah 40:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:19">Matthew 12:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:20">Matthew 12:20</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>in presence</b>—in personal
	appearance when present with you. 
	</p>
<p><b>base</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"lowly"; timid, humbly diffident: opposed to "bold."
	"Am" stands here by ironical concession for "am
	reputed to be" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:20- :">Matthew 12:20- :</span>).</p>
