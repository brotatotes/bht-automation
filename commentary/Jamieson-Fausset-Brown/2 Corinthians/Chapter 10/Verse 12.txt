<p><b>12.</b> "We do not presume
	(irony) to judge ourselves among, or in comparison with, some of them
	that commend themselves." The charge falsely brought against him
	of <i>commending himself</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1">2 Corinthians 3:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span>), really holds good of
	the false teachers. The phrase, "judge ourselves of the number,"
	is drawn from the testing of athletes and senators, the "approved"
	being set down on the roll [WAHL].
	</p>
<p><b>measuring themselves by
	themselves</b>—"<i>among</i> themselves": to correspond
	to the previous verb, "judge ourselves <i>among</i> them."
	Instead of measuring themselves by the public standard, they measure
	themselves by one made by themselves: they do not compare themselves
	with others who excel them, but with those like themselves: hence
	their high self-esteem. The one-eyed is easily king among the blind. 
	</p>
<p><b>are not wise</b>—with all
	their boasted "wisdom" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12- :">2 Corinthians 5:12- :</span>), they are anything but "wise."</p>
