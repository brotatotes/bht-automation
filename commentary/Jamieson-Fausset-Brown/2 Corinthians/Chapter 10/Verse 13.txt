<p><b>13. not boast . . . without . . .
	measure</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "to unmeasured bounds." There
	is no limit to a man's high opinion of himself, so long as he
	measures himself by himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) and his fellows, and does not compare himself with his
	superiors. It marks the <i>personal</i> character of this Epistle
	that the word "boast" occurs twenty-nine times in it, and
	only twenty-six times in all the other Epistles put together.
	Undeterred by the charge of vanity, he felt he must vindicate his
	apostolic authority by facts [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON]. It would be
	to "boast of things without our measure," were we to boast
	of conversions made by "other men's labors" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>to reach</b>—"that we
	should reach as far as even to you": not that he meant to go no
	further (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:16">2 Corinthians 10:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:20-24">Romans 15:20-24</span>).
	Paul's "measure" is the <i>apportionment</i> of his sphere
	of Gospel labors <i>ruled</i> for him by God. A "rule"
	among the so-called "apostolic canons" subsequently was,
	that no bishop should appoint ministers beyond his own limits. At
	Corinth no minister ought to have been received without Paul's
	sanction, as Corinth was <i>apportioned</i> to him by God as <i>his
	apostolic sphere.</i> The Epistle here incidentally, and therefore
	undesignedly, confirms the independent history, the Acts, which
	represents Corinth as the extreme limit as yet of his preaching, <i>at
	which he had stopped,</i> after he had from Philippi passed southward
	successively through Amphipolis, Apollonia, Thessalonica, Berea, and
	Athens [PALEY, <i>Horæ
	Paulinæ</i>].</p>
