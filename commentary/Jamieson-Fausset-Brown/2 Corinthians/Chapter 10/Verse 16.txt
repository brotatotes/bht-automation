<p><b>16. To</b>—that is, <i>so as to</i>
	preach . . . beyond you (and) not to boast, c. 
	</p>
<p><b>in another man's line of
	things made ready to our hand</b>—Do not connect "line of
	things," &amp;c. but "boast of things," &amp;c. To
	make this clearer, arrange the words thus, "Not to boast as to
	things (already made by the preaching of others) ready to our hand in
	another man's line (that is, within the line, or sphere of labor,
	apportioned by God to another)."</p>
