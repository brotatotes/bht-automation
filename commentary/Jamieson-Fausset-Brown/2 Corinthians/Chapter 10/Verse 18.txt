<p><b>whom the Lord commendeth</b>—to
	whom the Lord has given as His "Epistle of commendation,"
	the believers whom he has been the instrument of converting: as was
	Paul's case (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:1-3">2 Corinthians 3:1-3</span>).

<p><b>is approved</b>—can stand
	the test of the final trial. A metaphor from testing metals (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:10">Romans 16:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:19">1 Corinthians 11:19</span>). So on the other hand
	those finally rejected by the Lord are termed "<i>reprobate</i>
	silver" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+6:30">Jeremiah 6:30</span>).</p>
