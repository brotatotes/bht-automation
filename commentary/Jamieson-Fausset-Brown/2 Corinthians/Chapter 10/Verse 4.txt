<p><b>4.</b> A confutation of those who
	try to propagate their creed by force and persecution (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>weapons</b>—for punishing
	offending members (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:6">2 Corinthians 10:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:21">1 Corinthians 4:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:13">1 Corinthians 5:13</span>); boldness of speech,
	ecclesiastical discipline (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:10">2 Corinthians 13:10</span>), the power of the
	word, and of the sacraments, the various extraordinary gifts of the
	Spirit. 
	</p>
<p><b>carnal</b>—Translate,
	"fleshly," to preserve the allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:2">2 Corinthians 10:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3">2 Corinthians 10:3</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>mighty through God</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"mighty to God," that is, mighty before God: not humanly,
	but divinely powerful. The power is not ours, but God's. Compare
	"fair to God," that is, divinely fair (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3- :">2 Corinthians 10:3- :</span>, <i>Margin</i>). Also above (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3- :">2 Corinthians 10:3- :</span>), "<i>unto God</i> a sweet savor." "The
	efficacy of the Christian religion proves its truth" [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>pulling down</b>—As the
	<i>Greek</i> is the same as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3- :">2 Corinthians 10:3- :</span>, translate, "casting down." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3- :">2 Corinthians 10:3- :</span>: the inspired servants of God inherit the commission of the
	Old Testament prophets. 
	</p>
<p><b>strongholds</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:3- :">2 Corinthians 10:3- :</span>); namely, in which sinners entrench themselves against
	reproof; all that opposes itself to Christ; the learning, and
	eloquence, and philosophical subtleties on which the Corinthians
	prided themselves. So Joshua's trumpet blast was "mighty"
	under God to overthrow the walls of Jericho.</p>
