<p><b>high thing</b>—So it ought
	to be translated (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:39">Romans 8:39</span>). A
	distinct <i>Greek</i> word from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:39- :">Romans 8:39- :</span>, "height," and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:39- :">Romans 8:39- :</span>, which belongs to God and heaven from whence we receive
	nothing hurtful. But "high thing" is not so much "height"
	as <i>something made high,</i> and belongs to those regions of air
	where the powers of darkness ::exalt themselves" against Christ
	and us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>;

<p><b>exalteth itself</b>— <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:4- :">2 Thessalonians 2:4- :</span> supports <i>English Version</i> rather than the translation
	of ELLICOTT, c., "is
	lifted up." Such were the <i>high towers</i> of Judaic
	self-righteousness, philosophic speculations, and rhetorical
	sophistries, the "knowledge" so much prized by many
	(opposed to "the knowledge of God"), which endangered a
	section of the Corinthian Church.

	of self, there knowledge of God is wanting [BENGEL].
	Arrange the words following thus: "Bringing every thought (that
	is, <i>intent of the mind or will</i>) into captivity to the
	obedience of Christ," that is, to obey Christ. The three steps
	of the apostle's spiritual warfare are: (1) It demolishes what is
	opposed to Christ (2) It leads captive; (3) It brings into obedience
	to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:26">Romans 16:26</span>).
	The "reasonings" (<i>English Version,</i> "imaginations")
	are utterly "cast down." The "mental intents"
	(<i>English Version,</i> "thoughts") are taken willing
	captives, and tender the voluntary obedience of faith to Christ the
	Conqueror.</p>
