<p><b>7.</b> Do ye regard mere outward
	appearance (mere external recommendations, personal appearance,
	voice, manner, oratory of teachers <i>present face to face,</i> such
	as they admired in the false teachers to the disparagement of Paul,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>; see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10- :">2 Corinthians 10:10- :</span>)? Even in <i>outward bearing</i> when I shall be <i>present</i>
	with you (in contrast to "by <i>letters,</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10- :">2 Corinthians 10:10- :</span>) I will show that I am more really armed with the authority
	of Christ, than those who arrogate to themselves the title of being
	peculiarly "Christ's" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10- :">2 Corinthians 10:10- :</span>). A Jewish emissary seems to have led this party.

<p><b>let him of himself think this
	again</b>â€”He may "of himself," without needing to be
	taught it in a more severe manner, by "thinking again,"
	arrive at "this" conclusion, "that even as," &amp;c.
	Paul modestly demands for himself only an equal place with those whom
	he had begotten in the Gospel [BENGEL].</p>
