8. "For even if I were to
	boast somewhat more exceedingly (than I do,  :-) of our (apostolic) authority (2 Corinthians 10:6;
	2 Corinthians 13:10) . . . I should not be
	put to shame (by the fact; as I should be if my authority proved to
	be without foundation: my threats of punishment not being carried
	into effect)." 
	for edification . . . not for
	. . . destructionâ€”Greek, "for building up . . . not
	for . . . CASTING DOWN"
	(the same Greek as in 2 Corinthians 13:10- :): the image of a building as in 2 Corinthians 10:4;
	2 Corinthians 10:5. Though we "cast
	down reasonings," this is not in order to destroy, but really to
	build up ("edify"), by removing those things which
	are hindrances to edification, and testing what is unsound, and
	putting together all that is true in the building [CHRYSOSTOM].
