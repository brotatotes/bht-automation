<p><b>1. Would to God</b>—Translate as
	<i>Greek,</i> "I would that." 
	</p>
<p><b>bear with me</b>—I may ask
	not unreasonably to be borne with; not so the false apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:4">2 Corinthians 11:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>my</b>—not in the oldest
	manuscripts. 
	</p>
<p><b>folly</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	is a milder term than that for "foolishness" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:19">1 Corinthians 3:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:22">Matthew 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:2">Matthew 25:2</span>.
	The <i>Greek</i> for "folly" here implies <i>imprudence;</i>
	the <i>Greek</i> for "foolishness" includes the idea of
	<i>perversity</i> and <i>wickedness.</i>
</p>
<p><b>and indeed bear</b>—A
	request (so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:16">2 Corinthians 11:16</span>). But
	the <i>Greek</i> and the sense favor the translation, "But
	indeed (I need not wish it, for) ye <i>do</i> bear with me";
	still I wish you to bear with me further, while I enter at large into
	self-commendations.</p>
