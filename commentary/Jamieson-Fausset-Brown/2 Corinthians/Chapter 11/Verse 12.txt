	joins this clause with "the occasion," namely, <i>of
	glorying</i> or <i>boasting;</i> the occasion "that they may be
	found (a point wherein they glory) even as we," that is, quite
	as disinterested, or virtually, quite as gain-seeking and
	self-seeking. It cannot mean that the false teachers taught
	gratuitously even as Paul (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:20">2 Corinthians 11:20</span>;

	less clearly explains by reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:12- :">1 Corinthians 9:12- :</span>, c., where the "glorying" here is taken up and
	described as "glorying after the flesh" thus it means, that
	in the matters of which they beast they may be found even as we, that
	is, we may been a fair and equal footing; that there may be no
	<i>adventitious</i> comparisons made between us, arising out of
	<i>misrepresentations</i> of my course of procedure, but that in
	every matter of boasting we may be fairly compared and judged by
	<i>facts;</i> FOR (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:12- :">1 Corinthians 9:12- :</span>) realities they have none, no weapons but
	misrepresentation, being <i>false apostles.</i></p>
