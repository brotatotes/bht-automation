<p><b>14. is transformed</b>â€”rather,
	"transforms himself" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); habitually; the first occasion of his doing so was in
	tempting Eve. "Himself" is emphatical: If their master
	<i>himself,</i> who is the "prince of darkness," the most
	alien to light, does so, it is less marvellous in the case of them
	who are his servants (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:54">Luke 22:54</span>;
