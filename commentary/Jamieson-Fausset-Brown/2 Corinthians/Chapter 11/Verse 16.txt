<p><b>16. I say again</b>—again taking
	up from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:1">2 Corinthians 11:1</span> the
	anticipatory apology for his boasting. 
	</p>
<p><b>if otherwise</b>—but if ye
	will not grant this; if ye will think me a fool. 
	</p>
<p><b>yet as a fool</b>—"yet
	even as a fool receive me"; grant me the indulgent hearing
	conceded even to one suspected of folly. The <i>Greek</i> denotes one
	who does not rightly use his mental powers; not having the idea of
	blame necessarily attached to it; one deceived by foolish vanities,
	yet boasting himself [TITTMANN],
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:17">2 Corinthians 11:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:19">2 Corinthians 11:19</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>that I</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "that I, <i>too,</i>" namely, <i>as well
	as they,</i> may boast myself.</p>
