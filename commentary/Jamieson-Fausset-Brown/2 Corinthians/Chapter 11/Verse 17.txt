17. not after the Lord—By
	inspired guidance he excepts this "glorying" or
	"boasting" from the inspired authoritativeness which
	belongs to all else that he wrote; even this boasting, though
	undesirable in itself, was permitted by the Spirit, taking into
	account its aim, namely, to draw off the Corinthians from their false
	teachers to the apostle. Therefore this passage gives no proof that
	any portion of Scripture is uninspired. It merely guards against his
	boasting being made a justification of boasting in general, which is
	not ordinarily "after the Lord," that is, consistent with
	Christian humility. 
	foolishly—Greek,
	"in foolishness." 
	confidence of boasting—
	(2 Corinthians 9:4).
