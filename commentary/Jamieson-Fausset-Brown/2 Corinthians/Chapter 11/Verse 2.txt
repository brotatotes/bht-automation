<p><b>2. For I am jealous</b>—The
	justification of his self-commendations lies in his zealous care lest
	they should fall from Christ, to whom he, as "the friend of the
	Bridegroom" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29">John 3:29</span>),
	has espoused them; in order to lead them back from the false apostles
	to Christ, he is obliged to boast as an apostle of Christ, in a way
	which, but for the motive, would be "folly." 
	</p>
<p><b>godly jealousy</b>—literally,
	"jealousy of God" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29- :">John 3:29- :</span>, "godly sincerity," literally, "sincerity of
	God"). "If I am immoderate, I am immoderate to God"
	[BENGEL]. A jealousy which
	has God's honor at heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:29- :">John 3:29- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>I . . . espoused you</b>—Paul
	uses a <i>Greek</i> term applied properly to <i>the bridegroom,</i>
	just as he ascribes to himself "jealousy," a feeling
	properly belonging to the husband; so entirely does he identify
	himself with Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>present </b><i><b>you as</b></i><b>
	a chaste virgin to Christ</b>—at His coming, when the heavenly
	<i>marriage</i> shall take place (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span>).
	What Paul here says he desires to do, namely, "present" the
	Church as "a chaste virgin" to Christ, <i>Christ Himself</i>
	is said to do in the fuller sense. Whatever ministers do effectively,
	is really done by Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9- :">Revelation 19:9- :</span>). The <i>espousals</i> are going on now. He does not say
	"chaste virgins"; for not individual members, but the whole
	body of believers conjointly constitute the Bride.</p>
