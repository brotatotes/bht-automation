20. For—Ye may well "bear
	with" fools; for ye even "bear with" oppressors.
	Translate, "Ye bear with them." 
	a man—as the false
	apostles do. 
	bring you into bondage—to
	himself. Translate "brings," not "bring"; for the
	case is not merely a supposed case, but a case actually then
	occurring. Also "devours" (namely, by exactions, Matthew 23:24;
	Psalms 53:4), "takes,"
	"exalts," "smites." 
	take of you
—So the Greek for "take" is used for "take
	away from" (Revelation 6:4). ALFORD
	translates, as in 2 Corinthians 12:16,
	"catches you." 
	exalt himself—under the
	pretext of apostolic dignity. 
	smite you on the face—under
	the pretext of divine zeal. The height of insolence on their part,
	and of servile endurance on yours (1 Kings 22:24;
	Nehemiah 13:25; Luke 22:64;
	Acts 23:2; 1 Timothy 3:3).
