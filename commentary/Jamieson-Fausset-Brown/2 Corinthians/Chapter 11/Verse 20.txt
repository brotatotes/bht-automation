	Translate, "Ye bear with them."

<p><b>a man</b>—as the false
	apostles do.

<p><b>bring you into bondage</b>—to
	himself. Translate "brings," not "bring"; for the
	case is not merely a supposed case, but a case actually then
	occurring. Also "devours" (namely, by exactions, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:24">Matthew 23:24</span>;

</b>—So the <i>Greek</i> for "take" is used for "take
	away from" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:4">Revelation 6:4</span>). ALFORD

<p><b>exalt himself</b>—under the

<p><b>smite you on the face</b>—under

	and of servile endurance on yours (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:24">1 Kings 22:24</span>;
