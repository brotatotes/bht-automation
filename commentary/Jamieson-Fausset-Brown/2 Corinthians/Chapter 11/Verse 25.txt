<p><b>25.</b> The beating by Roman
	magistrates at Philippi (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:23">Acts 16:23</span>)

	stayed for some time after his conversion, and from which, as being a
	seafaring place, he was likely to make missionary voyages to
	adjoining places (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30">Acts 9:30</span>;
