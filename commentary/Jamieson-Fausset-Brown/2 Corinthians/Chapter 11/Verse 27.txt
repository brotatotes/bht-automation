27. fastings—voluntary,
	in order to kindle devotions (Acts 13:2;
	Acts 13:3; Acts 14:23;
	1 Corinthians 9:27); for they are
	distinguished from "hunger and thirst," which were
	involuntary [GROTIUS].
	However, see on 2 Corinthians 6:5. The
	context refers solely to hardships, not to self-imposed
	devotional mortification. "Hunger and thirst" are not
	synonymous with "foodlessness" (as the Greek of
	"fasting" means), but are its consequences. 
	cold . . . nakedness—"cold"
	resulting from "nakedness," or insufficient clothing, as
	the Greek often means: as "hunger and thirst" result
	from "foodlessness." (Compare Acts 28:2;
	Romans 8:35). "When we remember
	that he who endured all this was a man constantly suffering from
	infirm health (2 Corinthians 4:7-12;
	2 Corinthians 12:7-10; Galatians 4:13;
	Galatians 4:14), such heroic
	self-devotion seems almost superhuman" [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON].
