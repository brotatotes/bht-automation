<p><b>27. fastings</b>—<i>voluntary,</i>
	in order to kindle devotions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:23">Acts 14:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span>); for they are
	distinguished from "hunger and thirst," which were
	<i>involuntary</i> [GROTIUS].
	However, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:5">2 Corinthians 6:5</span>. The
	context refers solely to <i>hardships,</i> not to self-imposed
	devotional mortification. "Hunger and thirst" are not
	synonymous with "foodlessness" (as the <i>Greek</i> of
	"fasting" means), but are its consequences.

<p><b>cold . . . nakedness</b>—"cold"
	resulting from "nakedness," or insufficient clothing, as
	the <i>Greek</i> often means: as "hunger and thirst" result
	from "foodlessness." (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:2">Acts 28:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:35">Romans 8:35</span>). "When we remember
	that he who endured all this was a man constantly suffering from
	infirm health (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7-12">2 Corinthians 4:7-12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7-10">2 Corinthians 12:7-10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:13">Galatians 4:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:14">Galatians 4:14</span>), such heroic
	self-devotion seems almost superhuman" [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON].</p>
