<p><b>28. without</b>—"Beside"
	trials falling on me <i>externally,</i> just recounted, there is
	"that which cometh upon me (literally, <i>the impetuous
	concourse to me</i> of business; properly, <i>a crowd rising up
	against one again and again, and ready to bear him down</i>), the
	care of all the churches" (including those not yet seen in the
	flesh, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span>): an <i>internal</i>
	and more weighty anxiety. But the oldest manuscripts for "that
	which cometh," read, "the <i>pressure</i>": "the
	<i>pressing care-taking</i>" or "inspection that is upon me
	daily." ALFORD
	translates, "Omitting what is BESIDES";
	namely, those other trials <i>besides</i> those recounted. But the
	<i>Vulgate,</i> ESTIUS,
	and BENGEL, support
	<i>English Version.</i>

<p><b>the care</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	implies, "my <i>anxious solicitude</i> for all the churches."</p>
