<p><b>29. I . . . weak</b>—in
	condescending sympathy with the weak (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "<i>Care</i> generates sympathy, which causes the
	minister of Christ personally to enter into the feelings of all his
	people, as if he stood in their position, so as to accommodate
	himself to all" [CALVIN].
	</p>
<p><b>offended</b>—by some
	stumbling-block put in his way by others: the "weak" is
	most liable to be "offended." 
	</p>
<p><b>I burn not</b>—The "I"
	in the <i>Greek</i> is emphatic, which it is not in the former
	clause, "I am not weak." I not only enter into the feeling
	of the party offended, but <i>I</i> burn with indignation at the
	offender, <i>I myself</i> taking up his cause as my own. "Who
	meets with a stumbling-block and I am not disturbed even more than
	himself" [NEANDER].</p>
