3. I fear— ( :-); not inconsistent with love. His source of fear was their
	yielding character. 
	subtilty—the utter foe
	of the "simplicity" which is intent on ONE
	object, Jesus, and seeks none "other," and no "other"
	and different Spirit (2 Corinthians 11:4);
	but loves him with tender SINGLENESS
	OF AFFECTION. Where Eve first gave way, was in mentally
	harboring for a moment the possibility insinuated by the serpent, of
	GOD not having her truest
	interests at heart, and of this "other" professing friend
	being more concerned for her than God. 
	corrupted—so as to lose
	their virgin purity through seducers (2 Corinthians 11:4- :). The same Greek stands for "minds" as for
	"thoughts" (2 Corinthians 10:5,
	also see on 2 Corinthians 11:2); intents
	of the will, or mind. The oldest manuscripts after
	"simplicity," add, "and the purity" or
	"chastity." 
	in Christ—rather, "that
	is towards Christ."
