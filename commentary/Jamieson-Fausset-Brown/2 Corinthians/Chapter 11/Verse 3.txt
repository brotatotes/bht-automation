<p><b>subtilty</b>—the utter foe
	of the "simplicity" which is intent on ONE

	OF AFFECTION. Where Eve first gave way, was in mentally
	harboring for a moment the possibility insinuated by the serpent, of
	GOD not having her truest
	interests at heart, and of this "other" professing friend
	being more concerned for her than God.
