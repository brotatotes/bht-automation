<p><b>31.</b> This solemn asseveration
	refers to what follows. The persecution at Damascus was one of the
	first and greatest, and having no human witness of it to adduce to
	the Corinthians, as being a fact that happened long before and was
	known to few, he appeals to God for its truth. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) afterwards recorded it (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), [BENGEL]. It
	may ALSO refer to the
	revelation in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1">2 Corinthians 12:1</span>,
	standing in beautiful contrast to his humiliating escape from
	Damascus.</p>
