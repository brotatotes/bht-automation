32. governorâ€”Greek,
	"Ethnarch": a Jewish officer to whom heathen rulers gave
	authority over Jews in large cities where they were numerous. He was
	in this case under Aretas, king of Arabia. Damascus was in a Roman
	province. But at this time, A.D.
	38 or 39, three years after Paul's conversion, A.D.
	36, Aretas, against whom the Emperor Tiberius as the ally of Herod
	Agrippa had sent an army under Vitellius, had got possession of
	Damascus on the death of the emperor, and the consequent interruption
	of Vitellius' operations. His possession of it was put an end to
	immediately after by the Romans [NEANDER].
	Rather, it was granted by Caligula (A.D.
	38) to Aretas, whose predecessors had possessed it. This is proved by
	our having no Damascus coins of Caligula or Claudius, though we do
	have of their immediate imperial predecessors and successors
	[ALFORD].
