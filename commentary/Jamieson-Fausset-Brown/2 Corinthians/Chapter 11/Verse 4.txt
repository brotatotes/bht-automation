<p><b>4. if,</b> c.—which in <i>fact</i>
	is impossible. However, if it were possible, ye might then bear with
	them (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>). But
	there can be no <i>new Gospel</i> there is but the <i>one</i> which I

<p><b>he that cometh</b>—the
	high-sounding title assumed by the false teachers, who arrogated
	Christ's own peculiar title (<i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:3">Matthew 11:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:37">Hebrews 10:37</span>), "He that is
	coming." Perhaps he was leader of the party which assumed
	peculiarly to be "Christ's" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:7">2 Corinthians 10:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>); hence his assumption
	of the title.

<p><b>preacheth . . . receive</b>—is

<p><b>Jesus</b>—the "Jesus"
	of Gospel <i>history.</i> He therefore does not say "Christ,"
	which refers to the <i>office.</i>
</p>
<p><b>another . . . another</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"another Jesus . . . a <i>different</i> Spirit . . . a <i>different</i>
	Gospel." <i>Another</i> implies a distinct individual of the
	same kind; <i>different</i> implies one quite distinct in kind.

<p><b>which ye have not

<p><b>spirit . . . received . . .

	the "Spirit"; but it is actively concurrent with the will
	of God (which goes before to give the good will) in ACCEPTING
	the "Gospel." 
	</p>
<p><b>ye might well bear with

	(for ye ought to give heed to no Gospel other than what ye have
	already heard from me, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>); but the false teachers
	do not even pretend they have "another Jesus" and a
	"different Gospel" to bring before you; they merely try to
	supplant me, your accredited Teacher. Yet ye not only "bear
	with" them, but prefer them.</p>
