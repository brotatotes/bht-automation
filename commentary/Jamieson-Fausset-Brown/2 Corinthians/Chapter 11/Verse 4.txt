4. if, c.—which in fact
	is impossible. However, if it were possible, ye might then bear with
	them (see on 2 Corinthians 11:2). But
	there can be no new Gospel there is but the one which I
	first preached; therefore it ought not to be "borne" by
	you, that the false teachers should attempt to supersede me. 
	he that cometh—the
	high-sounding title assumed by the false teachers, who arrogated
	Christ's own peculiar title (Greek, Matthew 11:3;
	Hebrews 10:37), "He that is
	coming." Perhaps he was leader of the party which assumed
	peculiarly to be "Christ's" (2 Corinthians 10:7;
	1 Corinthians 1:12); hence his assumption
	of the title. 
	preacheth . . . receive—is
	preaching . . . ye are receiving. 
	Jesus—the "Jesus"
	of Gospel history. He therefore does not say "Christ,"
	which refers to the office.
another . . . another—Greek,
	"another Jesus . . . a different Spirit . . . a different
	Gospel." Another implies a distinct individual of the
	same kind; different implies one quite distinct in kind. 
	which ye have not
	received—from us. 
	spirit . . . received . . .
	gospel . . . accepted—The will of man is passive in RECEIVING
	the "Spirit"; but it is actively concurrent with the will
	of God (which goes before to give the good will) in ACCEPTING
	the "Gospel." 
	ye might well bear with
	him—There would be an excuse for your conduct, though a bad one
	(for ye ought to give heed to no Gospel other than what ye have
	already heard from me, Galatians 1:6;
	Galatians 1:7); but the false teachers
	do not even pretend they have "another Jesus" and a
	"different Gospel" to bring before you; they merely try to
	supplant me, your accredited Teacher. Yet ye not only "bear
	with" them, but prefer them.
