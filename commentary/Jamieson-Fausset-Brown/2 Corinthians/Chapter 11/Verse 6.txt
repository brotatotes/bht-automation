6. rude—Greek, "a
	common man"; a "laic"; not rhetorically trained;
	unskilled in finish of diction. 1 Corinthians 2:1-4;
	1 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 10:10;
	2 Corinthians 10:11, shows his words
	were not without weight, though his "speech" was
	deficient in oratorical artifice. "Yet I am not so in my
	knowledge" (2 Corinthians 12:1-5;
	Ephesians 3:1-5). 
	have been . . . made
	manifest—Read with the oldest manuscripts, "We have made
	things (Gospel truths) manifest," thus showing our "knowledge."
	English Version would mean, I leave it to yourselves to decide
	whether I be rude in speech . . . : for we have been thoroughly
	(literally, "in everything") made manifest among you
	(literally, "in respect to you"; "in relation to
	you"). He had not by reserve kept back his "knowledge"
	in divine mysteries from them (2 Corinthians 2:17;
	2 Corinthians 4:2; Acts 20:20;
	Acts 20:27). 
	in all things—The Greek
	rather favors the translation, "among all men"; the sense
	then is, we have manifested the whole truth among all men with a view
	to your benefit [ALFORD].
	But the Greek in Philippians 4:12,
	"In each thing and in all things," sanctions English
	Version, which gives a clearer sense.
