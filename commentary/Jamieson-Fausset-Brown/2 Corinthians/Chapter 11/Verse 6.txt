<p><b>6. rude</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "a
	common man"; a "laic"; not rhetorically trained;
	unskilled in finish of diction. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:1-4">1 Corinthians 2:1-4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:13">1 Corinthians 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:11">2 Corinthians 10:11</span>, shows his <i>words</i>
	were not without <i>weight,</i> though his "speech" was
	deficient in oratorical artifice. "Yet I am not so in my
	knowledge" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1-5">2 Corinthians 12:1-5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1-5">Ephesians 3:1-5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>have been . . . made
	manifest</b>—Read with the oldest manuscripts, "We have made
	things (Gospel truths) manifest," thus showing our "knowledge."
	<i>English Version</i> would mean, I leave it to yourselves to decide
	whether I be rude in speech . . . : for we have been thoroughly
	(literally, "in everything") made manifest among you
	(literally, "in respect to you"; "in relation to
	you"). He had not by reserve kept back his "knowledge"
	in divine mysteries from them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:20">Acts 20:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:27">Acts 20:27</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in all things</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	rather favors the translation, "among all men"; the sense
	then is, we have manifested the whole truth among all men with a view
	to your benefit [ALFORD].
	But the <i>Greek</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:12">Philippians 4:12</span>,
	"In each thing and in all things," sanctions <i>English
	Version,</i> which gives a clearer sense.</p>
