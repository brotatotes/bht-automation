9. wanted—"was in want."
	chargeable—Greek,
	"burdensome," literally, "to torpify," and so to
	oppress. JEROME
	says it is a Cilician word (2 Corinthians 12:14;
	2 Corinthians 12:16). 
	the brethren which
	came—rather, as Greek, "the brethren when they
	came." Perhaps Timotheus and Silas (Acts 8:1;
	Acts 8:5). Compare Philippians 4:15;
	Philippians 4:16, which refers to
	donations received from the Philippians (who were in Macedonia) at
	two distinct periods ("once and again"), one at
	Thessalonica, the other after his departure from Macedonia, that is,
	when he came into Achaia to Corinth (from the church in which city he
	would receive no help); and this "in the beginning of the
	Gospel," that is, at its first preaching in these parts. Thus
	all three, the two Epistles and history, mutually, and no doubt
	undesignedly, coincide; a sure test of genuineness. 
	supplied—Greek,
	"supplied in addition," namely, in addition to their former
	contributions; or as BENGEL,
	in addition to the supply obtained by my own manual labor.
