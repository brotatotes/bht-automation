<p><b>1.</b> He proceeds to illustrate the
	"glorying in infirmities" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). He gave one instance which might expose him to ridicule
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:33">2 Corinthians 11:33</span>); he now gives
	another, but this one connected with a glorious revelation of which
	it was the sequel: but he dwells not on the glory done to himself,
	but on the <i>infirmity</i> which followed it, as displaying Christ's
	power. The oldest manuscripts read, "I MUST
	NEEDS boast (or glory) though it be not expedient; <i>for</i>
	I will come." The "for" gives a proof that it is "not
	expedient to boast": I will take the case of revelations, in
	which if anywhere boasting might be thought harmless. "Visions"
	refers to things <i>seen:</i> "revelations," to things
	heard (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+9:15">1 Samuel 9:15</span>) or
	<i>revealed</i> in any way. In "visions" their
	signification was not always vouchsafed; in "revelations"
	there was always an unveiling of truths before hidden (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:19">Daniel 2:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:31">Daniel 2:31</span>). All parts of Scripture
	alike are matter of <i>inspiration;</i> but not all of <i>revelation.</i>
	There are degrees of revelation; but not of inspiration.
