<p><b>11. in glorying</b>—omitted in the
	oldest manuscripts. "I am become a fool." He sounds a
	retreat [BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye</b>—emphatic. "It
	is YE who have compelled me; for I ought to have been commended by
	you," instead of having to commend myself. 
	</p>
<p><b>am I behind</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "was I behind" when I was with you?

<p><b>the very chiefest</b>—rather,
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:5">2 Corinthians 11:5</span>, "those
	overmuch apostles." 
	</p>
<p><b>though I be nothing</b>—in
	myself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:9">1 Corinthians 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:10">1 Corinthians 15:10</span>).</p>
