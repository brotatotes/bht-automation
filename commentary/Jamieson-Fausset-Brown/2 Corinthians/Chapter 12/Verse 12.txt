<p><b>12. Truly,</b> c.—There is
	understood some such clause as this, "And yet I have not been
	commended by you." 
	</p>
<p><b>in all patience, in signs,</b>
	&amp;c.—The oldest manuscripts omit "in." "Patience"
	is not one of the "signs," but the element IN which they
	were wrought: endurance of opposition which did not cause me to leave
	off working [ALFORD].
	Translate, "IN . . .
	patience, BY signs,"
	&amp;c. His mode of expression is modest, putting himself, the
	worker, in the background, "were wrought," not "<i>I</i>
	wrought." As the <i>signs</i> have not been transmitted to us,
	neither has the apostleship. The apostles have no literal successors
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:21">Acts 1:21</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:22">Acts 1:22</span>).

<p><b>mighty deeds</b>—palpable
	works of divine omnipotence. The silence of the apostles in fourteen
	Epistles, as to miracles, arises from the design of those Epistles
	being hortatory, not controversial. The passing allusions to miracles
	in seven Epistles prove that the writers were not enthusiasts to whom
	<i>miracles</i> seem the most important thing. <i>Doctrines</i> were
	with them the important matter, save when convincing adversaries. In
	the seven Epistles the mention of miracles is not <i>obtrusive,</i>
	but marked by a calm air of assurance, as of facts <i>acknowledged on
	all hands,</i> and therefore unnecessary to dwell on. This is a much
	stronger proof of their reality than if they were formally and
	obtrusively asserted. Signs and wonders is the regular formula of the
	Old Testament, which New Testament readers would necessarily
	understand of supernatural works. Again, in the Gospels the miracles
	are so inseparably and congruously tied up with the history, that you
	cannot deny the former without denying the latter also. And then you
	have a greater difficulty than ever, namely, <i>to account for the
	rise of Christianity;</i> so that the infidel has something
	infinitely more difficult to believe than that which he rejects, and
	which the Christian more rationally accepts.</p>
