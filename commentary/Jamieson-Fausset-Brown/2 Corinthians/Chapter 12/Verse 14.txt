	His <i>second</i> visit was probably a short one (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and attended with humiliation through the scandalous
	conduct of some of his converts (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:21">2 Corinthians 12:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:1">2 Corinthians 2:1</span>). It was probably paid
	during his three years' sojourn at Ephesus, from which he could pass
	so readily by sea to Corinth (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:15">2 Corinthians 1:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:16">2 Corinthians 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1">2 Corinthians 13:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:2">2 Corinthians 13:2</span>). The context here
	implies nothing of a <i>third preparation</i> to come; but, "I
	am coming, and the third time, and will not burden you this time any
	more than I did at my <i>two previous visits</i>" [ALFORD].
