<p><b>15. I will . . . spend</b>—all I
	have. 
	</p>
<p><b>be spent</b>—all that I am.
	This is more than even natural parents do. They "lay up
	<i>treasures</i> for their children." But I spend not merely my
	treasures, but <i>myself.</i>
</p>
<p><b>for you</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"for your souls"; not for your mere bodies. 
	</p>
<p><b>the less I be loved</b>—Love
	rather descends than ascends [BENGEL].
	Love him as a true friend who seeks your good more than your good
	will.</p>
