15. I will . . . spend—all I
	have. 
	be spent—all that I am.
	This is more than even natural parents do. They "lay up
	treasures for their children." But I spend not merely my
	treasures, but myself.
for you—Greek,
	"for your souls"; not for your mere bodies. 
	the less I be loved—Love
	rather descends than ascends [BENGEL].
	Love him as a true friend who seeks your good more than your good
	will.
