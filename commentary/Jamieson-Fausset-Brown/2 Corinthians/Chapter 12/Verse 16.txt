16. I did not burden youâ€”The
	"I" in the Greek is emphatic. A possible insinuation
	of the Corinthians is hereby anticipated and refuted: "But, you
	may say, granted that I did not burden you myself;
	nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you (in my net) with guile";
	namely, made a gain of you by means of others ( :-).
