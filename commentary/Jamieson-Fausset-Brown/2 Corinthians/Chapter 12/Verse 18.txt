<p><b>18. I desired Titus</b>—namely, to
	go unto you. Not the mission mentioned <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:17">2 Corinthians 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:22">2 Corinthians 8:22</span>;
	but a mission previous to this Epistle, probably that from which he
	had just returned announcing to Paul their penitence (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:22- :">2 Corinthians 8:22- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>a brother</b>—rather "OUR
	(literally, 'the') brother"; one well known to the Corinthians,
	and perhaps a Corinthian; probably one of the two mentioned in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:18">2 Corinthians 8:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:22">2 Corinthians 8:22</span>.
	</p>
<p><b>same spirit</b>—inwardly. 
	</p>
<p><b>steps</b>—outwardly.</p>
