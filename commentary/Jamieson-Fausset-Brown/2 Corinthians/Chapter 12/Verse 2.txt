	But he purposely thus distinguishes between the <i>rapt and glorified</i>
	person of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:2">2 Corinthians 12:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:4">2 Corinthians 12:4</span>,
	and <i>himself</i> the infirmity-laden victim of the "thorn in
	the flesh" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span>).
	Such glory belonged not to <i>him,</i> but the <i>weakness</i> did.
	Nay, he did not even know whether he was in or out of the body when
	the glory was put upon him, so far was the glory from being <i>his</i>
	[ALFORD]. His spiritual
	self was his highest and truest self: the flesh with its infirmity
	merely his temporary self (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:7- :">2 Corinthians 12:7- :</span>). Here, however, the latter is the prominent thought.

	"fourteen years ago." This Epistle was written A.D.
	55-57. Fourteen years before will bring the vision to A.D.
	41-43, the time of his second visit to Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:7- :">Romans 16:7- :</span>). He had long been intimate with the Corinthians, yet had
	never mentioned this revelation before: it was not a matter lightly
	to be spoken of.

<p><b>I cannot tell</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "I know not." If <i>in the body,</i> he must
	have been caught up bodily; if <i>out of the body,</i> as seems to be
	Paul's <i>opinion,</i> his spirit must have been caught up out of the
	body. At all events he recognizes the possibility of conscious
	receptivity in disembodied spirits.

<p><b>to the third heaven</b>—<i>even
	to,</i> c. These <i>raptures</i> (note the <i>plural,</i> "visions,"
	"revelations," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1">2 Corinthians 12:1</span>)
	had two degrees: first he was <i>caught up</i> "to the third
	heaven," and from thence to "Paradise" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1- :">2 Corinthians 12:1- :</span>) [CLEMENT OF
	ALEXANDRIA, <i>Miscellanies,</i>
	5.427], which seems to denote an inner recess of the third heaven
	[BENGEL] (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:43">Luke 23:43</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>). Paul was permitted not
	only to "hear" the things of Paradise, but to see also in
	some degree the things of the third heaven (compare "visions,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1">2 Corinthians 12:1</span>). The occurrence TWICE
	of "whether in the body . . . I know not, God knoweth," and
	of "lest I should be exalted above measure," marks two
	stages in the revelation. "Ignorance of the <i>mode</i> does not
	set aside the certain knowledge of the <i>fact.</i> The apostles were
	ignorant of many things" [BENGEL].
	The first heaven is that of the clouds, the <i>air;</i> the second,
	that of the stars, the <i>sky;</i> the third is <i>spiritual</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:1- :">2 Corinthians 12:1- :</span>).</p>
