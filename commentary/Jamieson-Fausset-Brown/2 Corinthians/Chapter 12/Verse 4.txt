<p><b>4. unspeakable</b>â€”not in
	themselves, otherwise Paul could not have heard them; but as the
	explanation states, "which it is not lawful . . . to utter"
	[ALFORD]. They were
	designed for Paul's own consolation, and not for communication to
	others. Some heavenly words are communicable (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:6">Exodus 34:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:3">Isaiah 6:3</span>). These were not so. Paul
	had not the power adequately to utter; nor if he had, would he have
	been permitted; nor would earthly men comprehend them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:12">John 3:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:9">1 Corinthians 2:9</span>). A man may hear and know
	more than he can speak.</p>
