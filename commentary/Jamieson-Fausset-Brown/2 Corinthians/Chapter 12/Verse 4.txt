	themselves, otherwise Paul could not have heard them; but as the
	explanation states, "which it is not lawful . . . to utter"
	[ALFORD]. They were
	designed for Paul's own consolation, and not for communication to
	others. Some heavenly words are communicable (Exodus 34:6;
	Isaiah 6:3). These were not so. Paul
	had not the power adequately to utter; nor if he had, would he have
	been permitted; nor would earthly men comprehend them (John 3:12;
	1 Corinthians 2:9). A man may hear and know
	more than he can speak.
