6. For—Not but that I might
	glory as to "myself" ( :-); "FOR if I
	should desire to glory, I shall not be a fool"; for I have
	things to glory, or boast of which are good matter for glorying of
	(not mere external fleshly advantages which when he gloried in [ :-] he termed such glorying "folly," 2 Corinthians 11:1;
	2 Corinthians 11:16; 2 Corinthians 11:17).
	think of me—Greek,
	"form his estimate respecting me." 
	heareth of me—Greek,
	"heareth aught from me." Whatever haply he heareth from me
	in person. If on account of healing a cripple (Acts 14:12;
	Acts 14:13), and shaking off a
	viper (Acts 28:5), the people
	thought him a god, what would they have not done, if he had disclosed
	those revelations? [ESTIUS].
	I wish each of you to estimate me by "what he sees" my
	present acts and "hears" my teaching to be; not by
	my boasting of past revelations. They who allow themselves to
	be thought of more highly than is lawful, defraud themselves of the
	honor which is at God's disposal [BENGEL]
	(John 5:44; John 12:43).
