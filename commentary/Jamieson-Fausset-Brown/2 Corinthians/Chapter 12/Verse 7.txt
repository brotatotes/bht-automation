<p><b>7. exalted above measure</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"overmuch uplifted." How dangerous must self-exaltation be,
	when even the apostle required so much restraint! [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>abundance</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the excess"; exceeding greatness. 
	</p>
<p><b>given . . . me</b>—namely,
	by God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+5:6">Job 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:29">Philippians 1:29</span>).

<p><b>thorn in the flesh</b>—

	ALFORD thinks it to be the
	same bodily affliction as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:13">Galatians 4:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:14">Galatians 4:14</span>. It certainly was
	something personal, affecting him individually, and not as an
	apostle: causing at once <i>acute pain</i> (as "thorn"
	implies) and <i>shame</i> ("buffet": as slaves are
	<i>buffeted,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:20">1 Peter 2:20</span>).

<p><b>messenger of Satan</b>—who
	is permitted by God to afflict His saints, as Job (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+2:7">Job 2:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:16">Luke 13:16</span>).

<p><b>to buffet me</b>—In <i>Greek,
	present:</i> to buffet me even now continuously. After experiencing
	the state of the blissful angels, he is now exposed to the influence
	of an evil angel. The chastisement from hell follows soon upon the
	revelation from heaven. As his <i>sight</i> and <i>hearing</i> had
	been ravished with heavenly "revelations," so his <i>touch</i>
	is pained with the "thorn in the flesh."</p>
