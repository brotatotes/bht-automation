<p><b>9. said</b>—literally, "He

<p><b>is sufficient</b>—The trial
	must endure, but the grace shall also endure and never fail thee
	[ALFORD], (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The Lord puts the words into Paul's mouth, that following
	them up he might say, "O Lord, Thy grace is sufficient for me"
	[BENGEL].

	My power is perfected in man's "strengthlessness" (so the
	<i>Greek</i>). The "for" implies, thy "strengthlessness"
	(the same <i>Greek</i> as is translated "weakness"; and in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10">2 Corinthians 12:10</span>, "infirmities")
	is the very element in which My "power" (which moves
	coincident with "My grace") exhibits itself more perfectly.
	So that Paul instead of desiring the infirmity to "depart,"
	"rather" henceforth "<i>glories</i> in infirmities,
	that the power of Christ may rest (<i>Greek,</i> 'tabernacle upon,'
	cover my infirmity all over as with a tabernacle; compare <i>Greek,</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span>) upon" him. This
	effect of Christ's assurance on him appears, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:3">1 Corinthians 2:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:14">1 Peter 4:14</span>. The "My"
	is omitted in some of the oldest manuscripts; the sense is the same,
	"power" (referring to God's power) standing absolutely, in
	contrast to "weakness" (put absolutely, for man's
	weakness). Paul often repeats the word "weakness" or
	"infirmity" (the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth
	chapters) as being Christ's own word. The Lord has more need of our
	weakness than of our strength: our strength is often His rival; our
	weakness, His servant, drawing on His resources, and showing forth
	His glory. Man's extremity is God's opportunity; man's security is
	Satan's opportunity. God's way is not to take His children out of
	trial, but to give them strength to bear up against it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+88:7">Psalms 88:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>).</p>
