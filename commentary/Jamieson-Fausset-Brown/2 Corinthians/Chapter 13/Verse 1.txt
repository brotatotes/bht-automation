<p><b>1. This is the third time I am
	coming to you</b>—not merely <i>preparing</i> to come to you. This
	proves an <i>intermediate visit</i> between the two recorded in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:1">Acts 18:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2">Acts 20:2</span>.
	</p>
<p><b>In the mouth of two or three
	witnesses shall every word be established</b>—Quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:2- :">Acts 20:2- :</span>, <i>Septuagint.</i> "I will judge not without
	examination, nor will I abstain from punishing upon due evidence"
	[CONYBEARE and HOWSON].
	I will no longer be among you "in all patience" towards
	offenders (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:12">2 Corinthians 12:12</span>). The
	apostle in this case, where ordinary testimony was to be had, does
	not look for an immediate revelation, nor does he order the culprits
	to be cast out of the church before his arrival. Others understand
	the "two or three witnesses" to mean <i>his two or three
	visits</i> as establishing either (1) the truth of the facts alleged
	against the offenders, or (2) the reality of his threats. I prefer
	the first explanation to either of the two latter.</p>
