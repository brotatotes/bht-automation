14. The benediction which proves
	the doctrine of the Divine Trinity in unity. "The grace of
	Christ" comes first, for it is only by it we come to "the
	love of God" the Father ( :-). The variety in the order of Persons proves that "in
	this Trinity none is afore or after other" [Athanasian
	Creed]. 
	communion—joint
	fellowship, or participation, in the same Holy Ghost, which joins in
	one catholic Church, His temple, both Jews and Gentiles. Whoever has
	"the fellowship of the Holy Ghost," has also "the
	grace of our Lord Jesus Christ," and "the love of God";
	and vice versa. For the three are inseparable, as the three Persons
	of the Trinity itself [CHRYSOSTOM].
	The doctrine of the Trinity was not revealed clearly and fully till
	Christ came, and the whole scheme of our redemption was manifested in
	Him, and we know the Holy Three in One more in their relations to
	us (as set forth summarily in this benediction), than in their
	mutual relations to one another ( :-). 
	Amen—omitted in the
	oldest manuscripts. Probably added subsequently for the exigencies of
	public joint worship.
