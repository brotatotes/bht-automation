<p><b>2.</b> Rather, "I have already
	said (at my second visit), and tell you (now) beforehand, AS (I did)
	WHEN I WAS PRESENT THE SECOND
	TIME, SO also NOW
	in my absence (the oldest manuscripts omit the 'I write,' which here
	wrongly follows in <i>English Version Greek</i> text) to them which
	heretofore have sinned (namely, before my second visit, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and to all others (who have sinned since my second visit,
	or are in danger of sinning)." The <i>English Version,</i> "<i>as
	if I were</i> present the <i>second</i> time," namely, this next
	time, is quite inconsistent with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "this is the <i>third</i> time I am coming to you,"
	as Paul could not have called the same journey at once "the
	second" and "the third time" of his coming. The
	antithesis between "the second time" and "now" is
	palpable.

<p><b>if I come again,</b> &amp;c.â€”that
	is, <i>whensoever I come again</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). These were probably the very words of his former threat
	which he now repeats again.</p>
