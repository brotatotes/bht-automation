2. Rather, "I have already
	said (at my second visit), and tell you (now) beforehand, AS (I did)
	WHEN I WAS PRESENT THE SECOND
	TIME, SO also NOW
	in my absence (the oldest manuscripts omit the 'I write,' which here
	wrongly follows in English Version Greek text) to them which
	heretofore have sinned (namely, before my second visit,  :-), and to all others (who have sinned since my second visit,
	or are in danger of sinning)." The English Version, "as
	if I were present the second time," namely, this next
	time, is quite inconsistent with  :-, "this is the third time I am coming to you,"
	as Paul could not have called the same journey at once "the
	second" and "the third time" of his coming. The
	antithesis between "the second time" and "now" is
	palpable. 
	if I come again, &c.â€”that
	is, whensoever I come again ( :-). These were probably the very words of his former threat
	which he now repeats again.
