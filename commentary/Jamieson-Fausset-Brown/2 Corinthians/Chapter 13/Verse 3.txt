<p><b>3. Since</b>—The reason why he
	will not spare: Since ye challenge me to give a "proof"
	that Christ speaks in me. It would be better if ye would "<i>prove</i>
	your own selves" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:5">2 Corinthians 13:5</span>).
	This disproves the assertion of some that Scripture nowhere asserts
	the infallibility of its writers when writing it. 
	</p>
<p><b>which</b>—"who"
	(Christ). 
	</p>
<p><b>is not weak</b>—in relation
	to you, by me and in this very Epistle, in exercising upon you strong
	discipline. 
	</p>
<p><b>mighty in you</b>—has given
	many proofs of His power in miracles, and even in punishing offenders
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:11">2 Corinthians 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>). Ye have no need to put
	me to the proof in this, as long ago Christ has exhibited great
	proofs of His power by me among you (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21- :">2 Corinthians 5:21- :</span>) [GROTIUS]. It
	is therefore not me, but Christ, whom ye wrong: it is His patience
	that ye try in despising my admonitions, and derogating from my
	authority [CALVIN].</p>
