<p><b>through weakness</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"from weakness" that is, His assumption of our weakness was
	the source, or necessary condition, <i>from</i> which the possibility
	of His crucifixion flowed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>;

<p><b>weak in him</b>—that is, in
	virtue of our union with Him, and after His pattern, weakness
	predominates in us for a time (exhibited in our "infirmities"
	and weak "bodily presence," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:10">2 Corinthians 12:10</span>; and also in our not
	putting into immediate exercise our power of punishing offenders,
	just as Christ for a time kept in abeyance His power).

<p><b>we shall live with him</b>—not
	only hereafter with Him, free from our present infirmities, in the
	resurrection life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>),
	but presently in the exercise of our apostolic authority against
	offenders, which flows to us <i>in respect to you</i> from <i>the
	power of God,</i> however "weak" we now seem to you. "With
	Him," that is, even as He now exercises His power in His
	glorified resurrection life, after His weakness for a time.</p>
