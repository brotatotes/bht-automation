5. Examine—Greek, "Try
	(make trial of) yourselves." 
	prove your own selves—This
	should be your first aim, rather than "seeking a proof of Christ
	speaking in me" ( :-). 
	your own selves—I need
	not speak much in proof of Christ being in me, your minister ( :-), for if ye try your own selves ye will see that
	Christ is also in you [CHRYSOSTOM],
	(Romans 8:10). Finding Christ
	dwelling in yourselves by faith, ye may well believe that He speaks
	in me, by whose ministry ye have received this faith [ESTIUS].
	To doubt it would be the sin of Israel, who, after so many miracles
	and experimental proofs of God's presence, still cried (Romans 8:10- :), "Is the Lord among us or not?" (Compare Romans 8:10- :). 
	except ye be reprobates—The
	Greek softens the expression, "somewhat
	reprobates," that is, not abiding the "proof"
	(alluding to the same word in the context); failing when tested.
	Image from metals (Jeremiah 6:30;
	Daniel 5:27; Romans 1:28).
