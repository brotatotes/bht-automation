<p><b>6. we . . . not reprobates</b>â€”not

	<i>recognized</i> by you (observe, "ye shall <i>know,</i>"
	answers to "<i>know</i> your own selves," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) as sufficient "proof" that ye are not reprobates,
	but that "Christ speaks in me," without needing a proof
	from me more trying to yourselves. If ye doubt my apostleship, ye
