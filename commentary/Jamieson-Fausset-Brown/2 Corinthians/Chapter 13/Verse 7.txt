<p><b>7. I pray</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "we pray." 
	</p>
<p><b>not that we should appear
	approved</b>—not to gain credit for ourselves, your ministers, by
	your Christian conduct; but for your good [ALFORD].
	The antithesis to "reprobates" leads me to prefer
	explaining with BENGEL,
	"We do <i>not</i> pray <i>that</i> we may appear <i>approved,</i>"
	by restraining you when ye do evil; "but that ye should do what
	is <i>right</i>" (<i>English Version,</i> "honest"). 
	</p>
<p><b>though we be as
	reprobates</b>—though we be thereby deprived of the occasion for
	exercising our apostolic power (namely, in punishing), and so may
	appear "as reprobates" (<i>incapable of affording proof</i>
	of Christ speaking in us).</p>
