<p><b>9. are glad</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"rejoice."

<p><b>when we are weak</b>—having
	no occasion for displaying our power; and so seeming "weak,"
	as being compassed with "infirmities" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:10">2 Corinthians 10:10</span>;

	"perfect restoration"; literally, that of a dislocated
	limb. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>, "Be
