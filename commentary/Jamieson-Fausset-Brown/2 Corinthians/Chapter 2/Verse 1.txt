<p><b>1. with myself</b>—in contrast to
	"you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:23">2 Corinthians 1:23</span>). The
	same antithesis between Paul and them appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:23- :">2 Corinthians 1:23- :</span>.

<p><b>not come again . . . in
	heaviness</b>—"sorrow"; implying that he had <i>already</i>
	paid them <i>one</i> visit <i>in sorrow</i> since his coming for the
	first time to Corinth. At that visit he had warned them "he
	would not spare if he should come again" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:23- :">2 Corinthians 1:23- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1">2 Corinthians 13:1</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1- :">2 Corinthians 13:1- :</span>
	to the first Epistle. The "in heaviness" implies <i>mutual</i>
	pain; they grieving him, and he them. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1- :">2 Corinthians 13:1- :</span>, "I make you sorry," and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1- :">2 Corinthians 13:1- :</span>, "If any have caused grief (sorrow)." In this verse
	he accounts for having postponed his visit, following up <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1- :">2 Corinthians 13:1- :</span>.</p>
