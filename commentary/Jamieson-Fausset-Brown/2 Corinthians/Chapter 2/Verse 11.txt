11. Literally, "That we may
	have no advantage gained over us by Satan," namely, by letting
	one of our members be lost to us through despair, we ourselves
	furnishing Satan with the weapon, by our repulsive harshness to one
	now penitent. The loss of a single sinner is a common loss;
	therefore, in 2 Corinthians 2:10, he
	said, "for your sakes." Paul had "delivered" the
	offender "to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the
	Spirit might be saved" (2 Corinthians 2:10- :). Satan sought to destroy the spirit also: to let him do so,
	would be to give him an advantage, and let him overreach us. 
	not ignorant of his
	devicesâ€”"Ignorant" and "devices" are words
	akin in sound and root in Greek: we are not without knowledge
	of his knowing schemes.
