<p><b>12.</b> Paul expected to meet Titus
	at Troas, to receive the tidings as to the effect of his first
	Epistle on the Corinthian Church; but, disappointed in his
	expectation <i>there,</i> he passed on to Macedonia, where he met him
	at last (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:5">2 Corinthians 7:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:6">2 Corinthians 7:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:7">2 Corinthians 7:7</span>) The <i>history</i>
	(Acts) does not record his passing through Troas, in going from
	Ephesus <i>to</i> Macedonia; but it does in coming <i>from</i> that
	country (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6">Acts 20:6</span>); also, that
	he had disciples there (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7">Acts 20:7</span>),
	which accords with the <i>Epistle</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7- :">Acts 20:7- :</span>, "a door was opened unto me of the Lord"). An
	undesigned coincidence marking genuineness [PALEY,
	<i>Horæ Paulinæ</i>]. Doubtless Paul had fixed a time with Titus to
	meet him at Troas; and had desired him, if detained so as not to be
	able to be at Troas at that time, to proceed at once to Macedonia to
	Philippi, the next station on his own journey. Hence, though a wide
	door of Christian usefulness opened to him at Troas, his eagerness to
	hear from Titus the tidings from Corinth, led him not to stay longer
	there when the time fixed was past, but he hastened on to Macedonia
	to meet him there [BIRKS].

<p><b>to </b><i><b>preach</b></i><b>
</b>—literally, "for the Gospel." He had been at Troas
	before, but the vision of a man from Macedonia inviting him to come
	over, prevented his remaining there (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7- :">Acts 20:7- :</span>). On his return to Asia, after the longer visit mentioned
	here, he stayed seven days (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:7- :">Acts 20:7- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and</b>—that is, <i>though</i>
	Paul would, under ordinary circumstances, have gladly stayed in
	Troas.

<p><b>door . . . opened . . . of

	in His work, and by His gracious Providence.</p>
