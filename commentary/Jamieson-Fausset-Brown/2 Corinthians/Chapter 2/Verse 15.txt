<p><b>15.</b> The order is in <i>Greek,</i>
	"For (it is) of Christ (that) we are a sweet savor unto God";
	thus, the "for" justifies his previous words (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "the savor of HIS
	(Christ's) knowledge." We not only scatter the savor; but "we
	<i>are</i> the sweet savor" itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>;

<p><b>in them that are
	saved</b>—rather, "that <i>are being</i> saved . . . that are
	perishing" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:27- :">1 John 2:27- :</span>).
	As the light, though it blinds in darkness the weak, is for all that
	still light; and honey, though it taste bitter to the sick, is in
	itself still sweet; so the Gospel is still of a sweet savor, though
	many perish through unbelief [CHRYSOSTOM,
	<i>Homilies,</i> 5.467], (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:3">2 Corinthians 4:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>).
	As some of the conquered foes led in triumph were put to death when
	the procession reached the capitol, and to them the smell of the
	incense was the "savor of death unto death," while to those
	saved alive, it was the "savor of life," so the Gospel was
	to the different classes respectively. 
	</p>
<p><b>and in them</b>—in the case
	of them. "Those being saved" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6- :">2 Corinthians 4:6- :</span>): "Those that are perishing" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6- :">2 Corinthians 4:6- :</span>).</p>
