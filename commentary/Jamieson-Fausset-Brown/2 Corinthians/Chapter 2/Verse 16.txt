16. savour of death unto death . . .
	of life unto life—an odor arising out of death (a
	mere announcement of a dead Christ, and a virtually lifeless
	Gospel, in which light unbelievers regard the Gospel message), ending
	(as the just and natural consequence) in death (to the
	unbeliever); (but to the believer) an odor arising out of
	life (that is, the announcement of a risen and living
	Saviour), ending in life (to the believer) (Matthew 21:44;
	Luke 2:34; John 9:39).
	who is sufficient for these
	things?—namely, for diffusing aright everywhere the savor of
	Christ, so diverse in its effects on believers and unbelievers. He
	here prepares the way for one purpose of his Epistle, namely, to
	vindicate his apostolic mission from its detractors at Corinth, who
	denied his sufficiency. The Greek order puts prominently
	foremost the momentous and difficult task assigned to him, "For
	these things, who is sufficient?" He answers his own question
	(2 Corinthians 3:5; 2 Corinthians 3:6),
	"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, but our
	sufficiency is of God, who hath made us able (Greek,
	'sufficient') ministers," &c.
