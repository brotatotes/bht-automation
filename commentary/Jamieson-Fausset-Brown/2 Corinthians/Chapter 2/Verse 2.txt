<p><b>if I</b>—The "I"
	is emphatic. Some detractor may say that <i>this</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) is not my reason for not coming as I proposed; since I
	showed no scruple in causing "heaviness," or <i>sorrow,</i>
	in my Epistle (the first Epistle to the Corinthians). But I answer,
	If <i>I</i> be the one to cause you sorrow, it is not that I have any
	pleasure in doing so. Nay, my object was that he "who was made
	sorry by me" (namely, <i>the Corinthians in general,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; but with tacit reference to <i>the incestuous person in
	particular</i>) should repent, and so "make me glad," as
	has actually taken place; "for . . . who is he then that?"
