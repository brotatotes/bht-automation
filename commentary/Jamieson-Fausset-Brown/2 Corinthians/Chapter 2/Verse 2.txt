2. For—proof that he shrinks
	from causing them sorrow ("heaviness"). 
	if I—The "I"
	is emphatic. Some detractor may say that this ( :-) is not my reason for not coming as I proposed; since I
	showed no scruple in causing "heaviness," or sorrow,
	in my Epistle (the first Epistle to the Corinthians). But I answer,
	If I be the one to cause you sorrow, it is not that I have any
	pleasure in doing so. Nay, my object was that he "who was made
	sorry by me" (namely, the Corinthians in general,  :-; but with tacit reference to the incestuous person in
	particular) should repent, and so "make me glad," as
	has actually taken place; "for . . . who is he then that?"
