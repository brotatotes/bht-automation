<p><b>3. I wrote this same unto

	heaviness" (causing <i>sorrow</i> both to him and them, owing to

<p><b>sorrow from them of whom I

	when he ought, on the contrary, to have <i>joy</i> from their

	Epistle, whereas the former would have been the result, had he <i>then</i>
	visited them as he had originally proposed.

	The communion of saints, he feels confident in them "ALL"
	(his charity overlooking, for the moment the small section of his
	detractors at Corinth, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:7">1 Corinthians 13:7</span>),
	will make <i>his joy</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:2">2 Corinthians 2:2</span>)
	<i>their joy.</i></p>
