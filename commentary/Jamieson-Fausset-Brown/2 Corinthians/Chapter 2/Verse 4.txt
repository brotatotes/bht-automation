4. So far from my change of
	purpose being due to "lightness" ( :-), I wrote my letter to you ( :-) "out of much affliction (Greek, 'trouble') and
	anguish of heart, and with many tears." 
	not that ye should be
	grieved—Translate, "be made sorry," to accord with
	the translation, 2 Corinthians 2:2. My
	ultimate and main object was, "not that ye might be made sorry,"
	but that through sorrow you might be led to repentance, and so to
	joy, redounding both to you and me (2 Corinthians 2:2;
	2 Corinthians 2:3). I made you sorry before
	going to you, that when I went it might not be necessary. He is
	easily made sorry, who is admonished by a friend himself weeping
	[BENGEL]. 
	that ye might know the
	love—of which it is a proof to rebuke sins openly and in season
	[ESTIUS], (Psalms 141:5;
	Proverbs 27:6). "Love" is
	the source from which sincere reproof springs; that the Corinthians
	might ultimately recognize this as his motive, was the apostle's aim.
	which I have more abundantly
	unto you—who have been particularly committed to me by God
	(Acts 18:10; 1 Corinthians 4:15;
	1 Corinthians 9:2).
