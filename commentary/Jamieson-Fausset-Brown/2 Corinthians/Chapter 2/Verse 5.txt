<p><b>5. grief . . . grieved</b>—Translate
	as before, "sorrow . . . made sorry." The "any"
	is a delicate way of referring to the incestuous person. 
	</p>
<p><b>not . . . me, but in part</b>—He
	has grieved me only in part (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:14">2 Corinthians 1:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span>), that is, <i>I am not
	the sole party aggrieved;</i> most of <i>you,</i> also, were
	aggrieved. 
	</p>
<p><b>that I may not
	overcharge</b>—that I may not unduly lay the weight of the charge
	on you all, which I should do, if I made myself to be the sole party
	aggrieved. ALFORD
	punctuates, "He hath not made sorry me, but in part (that I
	press not too heavily; namely, on him) you all." Thus "you
	all" is in contrast to "me"; and "<i>in part</i>"
	is explained in the parenthetical clause.</p>
