<p><b>to such a man</b>—a milder
	designation of the offender than if he had been <i>named</i> [MEYER].
	Rather, it expresses estrangement from <i>such a one</i> who had
	caused such grief to the Church, and scandal to religion (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:22">Acts 22:22</span>;

<p><b>this punishment</b>—His
	being "delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh";
	not only excommunication, but bodily disease (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5- :">1 Corinthians 5:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>inflicted of many</b>—rather,
	"by the majority" (the more part of you). Not by an
	individual priest, as in the Church of Rome, nor by the bishops and
	clergy alone, but by the whole body of the Church.</p>
