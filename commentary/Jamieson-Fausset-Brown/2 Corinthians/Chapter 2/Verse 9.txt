<p><b>9. For</b>—Additional reason why
	they should restore the offender, namely, as a "proof" of
	their obedience "in all things"; now in <i>love,</i> as
	previously in <i>punishing</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), at the apostle's desire. Besides his other reasons for
	deferring his visit, he had the further view, though, perhaps,
	unperceived by them, of making an experiment of their fidelity. This
	accounts for his deferring to give, in his Epistle, the <i>reason</i>
	for his change of plan (resolved on before writing it). This full
	discovery of his motive comes naturally from him now, in the second
	Epistle, after he had seen the success of his measures, but would not
	have been a seasonable communication before. All this accords with
	reality, and is as remote as possible from imposture [PALEY,
	<i>Horæ Paulinæ</i>]. The interchange of feeling is marked (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "I wrote . . . that <i>ye</i> might know the love,"
	&amp;c.: here, "I did write, that <i>I</i> might know the proof
	of <i>you.</i>"</p>
