<p><b>1.</b> Are we beginning again to
	recommend ourselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:12">2 Corinthians 5:12</span>)
	(as some of them might say he had done in his first Epistle; or, a
	reproof to "some" who had <i>begun</i> doing so)! 
	</p>
<p><b>commendation</b>â€”recommendation.
	(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:18">2 Corinthians 10:18</span>). The
	"some" refers to particular persons of the "many"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span>) teachers who opposed
	him, and who came to Corinth with letters of recommendation from
	other churches; and when leaving that city obtained similar letters
	from the Corinthians to other churches. The thirteenth canon of the
	Council of Chalcedon (A.D.
	451) ordained that "clergymen coming to a city where they were
	unknown, should not be allowed to officiate without letters
	commendatory from their own bishop." The history (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+2:17- :">2 Corinthians 2:17- :</span>) confirms the existence of the custom here alluded to in
	the Epistle: "When Apollos was disposed to pass into Achaia
	[Corinth], <i>the brethren</i> [of Ephesus] <i>wrote,</i> exhorting
	the disciples to receive him." This was about two years before
	the Epistle,and is probably <i>one</i> of the instances to which Paul
	refers, as many at Corinth boasted of their being followers of
	Apollos (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>).</p>
