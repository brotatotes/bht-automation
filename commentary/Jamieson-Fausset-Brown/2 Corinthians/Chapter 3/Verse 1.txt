1. Are we beginning again to
	recommend ourselves (2 Corinthians 5:12)
	(as some of them might say he had done in his first Epistle; or, a
	reproof to "some" who had begun doing so)! 
	commendationâ€”recommendation.
	(Compare 2 Corinthians 10:18). The
	"some" refers to particular persons of the "many"
	(2 Corinthians 2:17) teachers who opposed
	him, and who came to Corinth with letters of recommendation from
	other churches; and when leaving that city obtained similar letters
	from the Corinthians to other churches. The thirteenth canon of the
	Council of Chalcedon (A.D.
	451) ordained that "clergymen coming to a city where they were
	unknown, should not be allowed to officiate without letters
	commendatory from their own bishop." The history (2 Corinthians 2:17- :) confirms the existence of the custom here alluded to in
	the Epistle: "When Apollos was disposed to pass into Achaia
	[Corinth], the brethren [of Ephesus] wrote, exhorting
	the disciples to receive him." This was about two years before
	the Epistle,and is probably one of the instances to which Paul
	refers, as many at Corinth boasted of their being followers of
	Apollos (1 Corinthians 1:12).
