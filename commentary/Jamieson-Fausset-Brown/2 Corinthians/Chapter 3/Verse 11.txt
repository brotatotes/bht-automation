<p><b>is glorious</b>—literally,
	"is <i>in glory.</i>" The <i>Greek</i> "with" or
	"by" is appropriately applied to that of which the glory
	was <i>transient.</i> "In" to that of which the glory is
	permanent. The contrast of the Old and New Testaments proves that
	Paul's chief opponents at Corinth were Judaizers.</p>
