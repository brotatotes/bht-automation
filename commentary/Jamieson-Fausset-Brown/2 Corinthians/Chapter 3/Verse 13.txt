13. We use no disguise, "as
	Moses put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel might not
	look steadfastly upon the end of that which was to be done away"
	[ELLICOTT and others]. The
	view of Exodus 34:30-35,
	according to the Septuagint is adopted by Paul, that Moses in
	going in to speak to God removed the veil till he came out and had
	spoken to the people; and then when he had done speaking,
	he put on the veil that they might not look on the end, or the
	fading, of that transitory glory. The veil was the symbol of
	concealment, put on directly after Moses' speaking; so that
	God's revelations by him were interrupted by intervals of concealment
	[ALFORD]. But ALFORD'S
	view does not accord with 2 Corinthians 3:7;
	the Israelites "could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses
	for the glory of his countenance." Plainly Moses' veil was put
	on because of their not having been able to "look
	steadfastly at him." Paul here (2 Corinthians 3:7- :) passes from the literal fact to the truth symbolized by it,
	the blindness of Jews and Judaizers to the ultimate end of the law:
	stating that Moses put on the veil that they might not look
	steadfastly at (Christ, 2 Corinthians 3:7- :) the end of that (law) which (like Moses'
	glory) is done away. Not that Moses had this purpose;
	but often God attributes to His prophets the purpose which He has
	Himself. Because the Jews would not see, God judicially gave
	them up so as not to see. The glory of Moses' face is
	antitypically Christ s glory shining behind the veil of legal
	ordinances. The veil which has been taken off to the believer is left
	on to the unbelieving Jew, so that he should not see (Isaiah 6:10;
	Acts 28:26; Acts 28:27).
	He stops short at the letter of the law, not seeing the end of it.
	The evangelical glory of the law, like the shining of Moses' face,
	cannot be borne by a carnal people, and therefore remains veiled to
	them until the Spirit comes to take away the veil (Acts 28:27- :) [CAMERON].
