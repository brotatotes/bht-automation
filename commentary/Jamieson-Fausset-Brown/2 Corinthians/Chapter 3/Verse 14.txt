	"Because it is done away in Christ," that is, it is not
	done away save in Christ: the veil <i>therefore</i> remains untaken
	away from them, <i>because</i> they will not come to Christ, who does
	away, with the law as a mere letter. If they once saw that the law is
	done away in Him, the veil would be no longer on their hearts in
	reading it publicly in their synagogues (so "reading"
	means, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:21">Acts 15:21</span>). I prefer the
