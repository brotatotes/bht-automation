15. the veil isâ€”rather, "a
	veil lieth upon their heart" (their understanding,
	affected by the corrupt will, John 8:43;
	1 Corinthians 2:14). The Tallith was
	worn in the synagogue by every worshipper, and to this veil hanging
	over the breast there may be an indirect allusion here (see on 1 Corinthians 2:14- :): the apostle making it symbolize the spiritual veil on
	their heart.
