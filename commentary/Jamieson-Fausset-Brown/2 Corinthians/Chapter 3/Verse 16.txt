<p><b>16.</b> Moses took off the veil on
	entering into the presence of the Lord. So as to the Israelites whom
	Moses represents, "whensoever their heart (it) <i>turns</i> (not
	as <i>English Version,</i> 'shall turn') to the Lord, the veil is (by
	the very fact; not as <i>English Version,</i> '<i>shall be</i>')
	taken away." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:34">Exodus 34:34</span> is
	the allusion; not <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:30">Exodus 34:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:31">Exodus 34:31</span>, as ALFORD
	thinks. Whenever the Israelites turn to the Lord, who is the Spirit
	of the law, the veil is taken off their hearts in the presence of the
	Lord: as the literal veil was taken off by Moses in going before God:
	no longer resting on the dead letter, <i>the veil,</i> they by the
	Spirit commune with God and with the inner spirit of the Mosaic
	covenant (which answers to the glory of <i>Moses' face unveiled</i>
	in God's presence).</p>
