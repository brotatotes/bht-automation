16. Moses took off the veil on
	entering into the presence of the Lord. So as to the Israelites whom
	Moses represents, "whensoever their heart (it) turns (not
	as English Version, 'shall turn') to the Lord, the veil is (by
	the very fact; not as English Version, 'shall be')
	taken away." Exodus 34:34 is
	the allusion; not Exodus 34:30;
	Exodus 34:31, as ALFORD
	thinks. Whenever the Israelites turn to the Lord, who is the Spirit
	of the law, the veil is taken off their hearts in the presence of the
	Lord: as the literal veil was taken off by Moses in going before God:
	no longer resting on the dead letter, the veil, they by the
	Spirit commune with God and with the inner spirit of the Mosaic
	covenant (which answers to the glory of Moses' face unveiled
	in God's presence).
