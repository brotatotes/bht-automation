	is that Spirit—is THE
	Spirit, namely, that Spirit spoken of in 2 Corinthians 4:5- :, and here resumed after the parenthesis (2 Corinthians 4:5- :): Christ is the Spirit and "end" of the Old
	Testament, who giveth life to it, whereas "the letter killeth"
	(1 Corinthians 15:45; Revelation 19:10,
	end). 
	where the Spirit of the Lord
	is—in a man's "heart" (2 Corinthians 3:15;
	Romans 8:9; Romans 8:10).
	there is liberty— (Romans 8:10- :). "There," and there only. Such cease to be
	slaves to the letter, which they were while the veil was on their
	heart. They are free to serve God in the Spirit, and rejoice in
	Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:3): they
	have no longer the spirit of bondage, but of free sonship (Romans 8:15;
	Galatians 4:7). "Liberty" is
	opposed to the letter (of the legal ordinances), and to the veil, the
	badge of slavery: also to the fear which the Israelites felt
	in beholding Moses' glory unveiled (Exodus 34:30;
	1 John 4:18).
