18. But we all—Christians, as
	contrasted with the Jews who have a veil on their hearts, answering
	to Moses' veil on his face. He does not resume reference to ministers
	till 2 Corinthians 4:1. 
	with open face—Translate,
	"with unveiled face" (the veil being removed
	at conversion): contrasted with "hid" (2 Corinthians 4:1- :). 
	as in a glass—in a
	mirror, namely, the Gospel which reflects the glory of God and Christ
	(2 Corinthians 4:4; 1 Corinthians 13:12;
	James 1:23; James 1:25).
	are changed into the same
	image—namely, the image of Christ's glory, spiritually now
	(Romans 8:29; 1 John 3:3);
	an earnest of the bodily change hereafter (1 John 3:3- :). However many they be, believers all reflect the same
	image of Christ more or less: a proof of the truth of Christianity. 
	from glory to glory—from
	one degree of glory to another. As Moses' face caught a reflection of
	God's glory from being in His presence, so believers are changed into
	His image by beholding Him.

	expected from "the Lord the Spirit" (not as English
	Version, "the Spirit of the Lord") [ALFORD]
	(2 Corinthians 3:17): "who receives
	of the things of Christ, and shows them to us" (John 16:14
Romans 8:10; Romans 8:11).

	Revelation 22:4).
