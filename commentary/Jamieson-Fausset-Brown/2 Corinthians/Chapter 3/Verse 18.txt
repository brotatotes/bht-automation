<p><b>18. But we all</b>—Christians, as
	contrasted with the Jews who have a veil on their hearts, answering
	to Moses' veil on his face. He does not resume reference to <i>ministers</i>
	till <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1">2 Corinthians 4:1</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>with open face</b>—Translate,
	"with <i>unveiled</i> face" (the <i>veil</i> being removed
	at conversion): contrasted with "hid" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:1- :">2 Corinthians 4:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>as in a glass</b>—in a
	mirror, namely, the Gospel which reflects the glory of God and Christ
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12">1 Corinthians 13:12</span>;

<p><b>are changed into the same
	image</b>—namely, the image of Christ's glory, spiritually now
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>);
	an earnest of the bodily change hereafter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3- :">1 John 3:3- :</span>). However many they be, believers all reflect the <i>same</i>
	image of Christ more or less: a proof of the truth of Christianity. 
	</p>
<p><b>from glory to glory</b>—from
	one degree of glory to another. As Moses' face caught a reflection of
	God's glory from being in His presence, so believers are changed into
	His image by beholding Him. 
	</p>
<p><i><b>even</b></i><b> as,</b>
	c.—Just such a transformation "<i>as</i>" was to be
	expected from "the Lord the Spirit" (not as <i>English
	Version,</i> "the Spirit of the Lord") [ALFORD]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span>): "who receives
	of the things of Christ, and shows them to us" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:14">John 16:14</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>).
