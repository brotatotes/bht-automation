<p><b>2. our epistle</b>—of
	recommendation. 
	</p>
<p><b>in our hearts</b>—not
	letters borne merely <i>in the hands.</i> Your conversion through my
	instrumentality, and your faith which is "known of all men"
	by widespread report (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and which is written by memory and affection on my inmost
	heart and is borne about wherever I go, is my letter of
	recommendation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:2">1 Corinthians 9:2</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>known and read</b>—words
	akin in root, sound, and sense (so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:2- :">1 Corinthians 9:2- :</span>). "Ye are <i>known</i> to be my converts by general
	knowledge: then ye are <i>known</i> more particularly by your
	reflecting my doctrine in your Christian life." The handwriting
	is first "known," then the Epistle is "read"
	[GROTIUS] (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:25">1 Corinthians 14:25</span>). There is not so
	powerful a sermon in the world, as a consistent Christian life. The
	eye of the world takes in more than the ear. Christians' lives are
	the only religious books the world reads. IGNATIUS
	[<i>Epistle to the Ephesians,</i> 10] writes, "Give unbelievers
	the chance of believing through you. Consider yourselves employed by
	God; your lives the form of language in which He addresses them. Be
	mild when they are angry, humble when they are haughty; to their
	blasphemy oppose prayer without ceasing; to their inconsistency, a
	steadfast adherence to your faith."</p>
