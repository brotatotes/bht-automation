2. our epistle—of
	recommendation. 
	in our hearts—not
	letters borne merely in the hands. Your conversion through my
	instrumentality, and your faith which is "known of all men"
	by widespread report ( :-), and which is written by memory and affection on my inmost
	heart and is borne about wherever I go, is my letter of
	recommendation (1 Corinthians 9:2). 
	known and read—words
	akin in root, sound, and sense (so 1 Corinthians 9:2- :). "Ye are known to be my converts by general
	knowledge: then ye are known more particularly by your
	reflecting my doctrine in your Christian life." The handwriting
	is first "known," then the Epistle is "read"
	[GROTIUS] (2 Corinthians 4:2;
	1 Corinthians 14:25). There is not so
	powerful a sermon in the world, as a consistent Christian life. The
	eye of the world takes in more than the ear. Christians' lives are
	the only religious books the world reads. IGNATIUS
	[Epistle to the Ephesians, 10] writes, "Give unbelievers
	the chance of believing through you. Consider yourselves employed by
	God; your lives the form of language in which He addresses them. Be
	mild when they are angry, humble when they are haughty; to their
	blasphemy oppose prayer without ceasing; to their inconsistency, a
	steadfast adherence to your faith."
