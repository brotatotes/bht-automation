<p><b>3. declared</b>—The letter is
	written so legibly that it can be "read by all men" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Translate, "Being manifestly shown to be an Epistle of
	Christ"; a letter coming manifestly from Christ, and "ministered
	by us," that is, carried about and presented by us as its
	(ministering) bearers to those (the world) for whom it is intended:
	Christ is the Writer and the Recommender, ye are the letter
	recommending us. 
	</p>
<p><b>written not with ink, but
	with the Spirit of the living God</b>—Paul was the ministering pen
	or other instrument of writing, as well as the ministering bearer and
	presenter of the letter. "Not with ink" stands in contrast
	to the letters of commendation which "some" at Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) used. "Ink" is also used here to include all
	outward materials for writing, such as the Sinaitic tables of stone
	were. These, however, were not written with ink, but "graven"
	by "the finger of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+31:18">Exodus 31:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:16">Exodus 32:16</span>). Christ's Epistle (His
	believing members converted by Paul) is better still: it is written
	not merely with the <i>finger,</i> but with the "<i>Spirit</i>
	of the <i>living God</i>"; it is not the "ministration of
	death" as the law, but of the "<i>living</i> Spirit"
	that "giveth life" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:16- :">Exodus 32:16- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>not in</b>—not <i>on</i>
	tables (tablets) of stone, as the ten commandments were written (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:16- :">Exodus 32:16- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in fleshy tables of the
	heart</b>—ALL the best
	manuscripts read, "On [your] <i>hearts</i> [which are] tables of
	flesh." Once your hearts were spiritually what the tables of the
	law were physically, tables of stone, but God has "taken away
	the stony heart out of your flesh, given you a heart of flesh"
	(<i>fleshy,</i> not <i>fleshly,</i> that is, carnal; hence it is
	written, "out of your <i>flesh</i>" that is, your <i>carnal</i>
	nature), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+11:19">Ezekiel 11:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:26">Ezekiel 36:26</span>.
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:2">2 Corinthians 3:2</span>, "As ye are
	our Epistle written in our hearts," so Christ has in the first
	instance made you "His Epistle written with the Spirit in (on)
	your hearts." I bear on my heart, as a testimony to all men,
	that which Christ has by His Spirit written in your heart [ALFORD].
	(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:3">Proverbs 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+7:3">Proverbs 7:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:31-34">Jeremiah 31:31-34</span>). This passage
	is quoted by PALEY [<i>Horæ
	Paulinæ</i>] as illustrating one peculiarity of Paul's style,
	namely, his <i>going off at a word into a parenthetic reflection:</i>
	here it is on the word "Epistle." So "savor," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:31-24.31.34- :">Jeremiah 31:31-24.31.34- :</span>.</p>
