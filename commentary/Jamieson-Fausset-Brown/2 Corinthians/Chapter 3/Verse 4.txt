	2 Corinthians 3:6; 2 Corinthians 2:16

	work, the ministry committed by Him to us, for which we must render
	an account to Him). Confidence toward God is solid and real, as
	looking to Him for the strength needed now, and also for the reward
	of grace to be given hereafter. Compare 2 Corinthians 2:16- :, "hope toward God." Human confidence is unreal in
	that it looks to man for its help and its reward.
