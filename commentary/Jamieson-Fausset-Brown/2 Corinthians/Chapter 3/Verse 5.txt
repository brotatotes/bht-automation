	that we are (even yet after so long experience as ministers)
	sufficient to think anything OF ourselves as (coming) FROM
	ourselves; but our sufficiency is (derived) FROM
	God." "<i>From</i>" more definitely refers to the
	<i>source</i> out of which a thing comes; "of" is more
	general.

<p><b>to think</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	to "reason out" or "devise"; <i>to attain to</i>
	sound preaching <i>by our reasonings</i> [THEODORET].
	The "we" refers here to <i>ministers</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>anything</b>—even the
	least. We cannot expect too little from man, or too much from God.</p>
