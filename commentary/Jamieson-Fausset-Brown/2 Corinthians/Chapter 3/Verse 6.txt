	is the same, corresponding to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, translate, "<i>sufficient</i> as ministers"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:7">Ephesians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:23">Colossians 1:23</span>).

<p><b>the new testament</b>—"the

	or covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:25">1 Corinthians 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:24">Galatians 4:24</span>).
	He reverts here again to the contrast between the law on "tables
	of stone," and that "written by the Spirit on fleshly
	tables of the heart" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:3">2 Corinthians 3:3</span>).

<p><b>not of the letter</b>—joined
	with "ministers"; ministers not of <i>the mere literal
	precept,</i> in which the old law, as then understood, consisted;
	"but of the Spirit," that is, <i>the spiritual holiness</i>
	which lay under the old law, and which the new covenant brings to
	light (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17-48">Matthew 5:17-48</span>) with
	new <i>motives</i> added, and a new <i>power</i> of obedience
	imparted, namely, the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17-40.5.48- :">Matthew 5:17-40.5.48- :</span>). Even in <i>writing the letter</i> of the New Testament,
	Paul and the other sacred writers were ministers <i>not of the
	letter, but of the spirit.</i> No piety of spirit could exempt a man
	from the yoke of the letter of each legal ordinance under the Old
	Testament; for God had appointed this as the way in which He chose a
	devout Jew to express his state of mind towards God. Christianity, on
	the other hand, makes the spirit of our outward observances
	everything, and the letter a secondary consideration (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17-40.5.48- :">Matthew 5:17-40.5.48- :</span>). Still the moral law of the ten commandments, being written
	by the finger of God, is as obligatory now as ever; but put more on
	the Gospel spirit of "love," than on the letter of a
	servile obedience, and in a deeper and fuller spirituality (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17-48">Matthew 5:17-48</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span>). No literal precepts
	could fully comprehend the wide range of holiness which LOVE, the
	work of the Holy Spirit, under the Gospel, suggests to the believer's
	heart instinctively from the word understood in its deep
	spirituality.

<p><b>letter killeth</b>—by

<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7">2 Corinthians 3:7</span>, "ministration of

<p><b>spirit giveth life</b>—The
	spirit of the Gospel when brought home to the heart by the Holy
	Spirit, gives new spiritual life to a man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:11">Romans 6:11</span>). This "spirit of
	life" is for us in Christ Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>), who dwells in the
	believer as a "quickening" or "life-giving Spirit"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:45">1 Corinthians 15:45</span>). Note, the
	spiritualism of rationalists is very different. It would admit no
	"stereotyped revelation," except so much as man's own inner
	instrument of revelation, the conscience and reason, can approve of:
	thus making the conscience judge of the written word, whereas the
	apostles make the written word the judge of the conscience (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:11">Acts 17:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:1">1 Peter 4:1</span>). True spirituality rests
	on the whole written word, applied to the soul by the Holy Spirit as
	the only infallible interpreter of its far-reaching spirituality. The
	<i>letter</i> is nothing without the <i>spirit,</i> in a subject
	essentially spiritual. The <i>spirit</i> is nothing without the
	<i>letter,</i> in a record substantially historical.</p>
