<p><b>7. the ministration of death</b>—the
	legal dispensation, summed up in the Decalogue, which denounces <i>death</i>
	against man for transgression. 
	</p>
<p><b>written </b><i><b>and</b></i><b>
	engraven in stones</b>—There is no "and" in the <i>Greek.</i>
	The literal translation is, "The ministration of death <i>in
	letters,</i>" of which "engraven on stones" is an
	explanation. The preponderance of oldest manuscripts is for the
	<i>English Version</i> reading. But one (perhaps the oldest existing
	manuscript) has "in the letter," which refers to the
	preceding words (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6">2 Corinthians 3:6</span>), "<i>the
	letter</i> killeth," and this seems the probable reading. Even
	if we read as <i>English Version,</i> "The ministration of death
	(written) in letters," alludes to <i>the literal precepts</i> of
	the law as only bringing us the knowledge of sin and "<i>death,</i>"
	in contrast to "<i>the Spirit</i>" in the Gospel bringing
	us "<i>life</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:6- :">2 Corinthians 3:6- :</span>). The opposition between "the letters" and "the
	Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:8">2 Corinthians 3:8</span>) confirms
	this. This explains why the phrase in <i>Greek</i> should be "in
	letters," instead of the ordinary one which <i>English Version</i>
	has substituted, "written <i>and.</i>"

<p><b>was glorious</b>—literally,
	"was made (invested) in glory," glory was the atmosphere
	with which it was encompassed. 
	</p>
<p><b>could not steadfastly
	behold</b>—literally, "fix their eyes on." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:8- :">2 Corinthians 3:8- :</span>, "The skin of his face shone; and they were AFRAID
	<i>to come nigh him.</i>" "Could not," therefore means
	here, "for FEAR."
	The "glory of Moses' countenance" on Sinai passed away when
	the occasion was over: a type of the transitory character of the
	dispensation which he represented (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:8- :">2 Corinthians 3:8- :</span>), as contrasted with the permanency of the Christian
	dispensation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:11">2 Corinthians 3:11</span>).</p>
