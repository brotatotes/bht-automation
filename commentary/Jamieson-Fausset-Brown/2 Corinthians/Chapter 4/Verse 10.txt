10. bearing about in the body the
	dying of the Lord Jesus—that is, having my body exposed to
	being put to death in the cause of Jesus (the oldest manuscripts omit
	"the Lord"), and having in it the marks of such sufferings,
	I thus bear about wheresoever I go, an image of the suffering Saviour
	in my own person (2 Corinthians 4:11;
	2 Corinthians 1:5; compare 2 Corinthians 1:5- :). Doubtless, Paul was exposed to more dangers than are
	recorded in Acts (compare 2 Corinthians 7:5;
	2 Corinthians 11:26). The Greek for
	"the dying" is literally, "the being made a corpse,"
	such Paul regarded his body, yet a corpse which shares in the
	life-giving power of Christ's resurrection, as it has shared in His
	dying and death. 
	that the life also of Jesus
	might be made manifest in our body—rather, "may be."
	The name "Jesus," by itself is often repeated here as Paul
	seems, amidst sufferings, peculiarly to have felt its sweetness. In
	2 Corinthians 4:11 the same words occur
	with the variation, "in our mortal flesh. The fact of a
	dying, corpse-like body being sustained amidst such trials, manifests
	that "the (resurrection) life also," as well as the dying,
	"of Jesus," exerts its power in us. I thus bear about in my
	own person an image of the risen and living, as well as of the
	suffering, Saviour. The "our" is added here to "body,"
	though not in the beginning of the verse. "For the body is ours
	not so much in death, as in life" [BENGEL].
