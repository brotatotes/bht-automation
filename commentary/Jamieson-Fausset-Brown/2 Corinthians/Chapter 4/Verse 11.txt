<p><b>11. we which live</b>—in the power
	of Christ's "life" manifested in us, in our whole man body
	as well as spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:10">Romans 8:10</span>;

	Paul regards his preservation amidst so many exposures to "death,"
	by which Stephen and James were cut off, as a standing miracle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:15- :">2 Corinthians 5:15- :</span>).

<p><b>delivered unto</b>—not by
	chance; by the ordering of Providence, who shows "the excellency
	of His power" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:7">2 Corinthians 4:7</span>), in
	<i>delivering unto</i> DEATH
	His living saints, that He may manifest LIFE
	also in their dying flesh. "Flesh," the very element of
	decay (not merely their "body"), is by Him made to manifest
	<i>life.</i></p>
