<p><b>12.</b> The "<i>death</i>"
	of Christ manifested in the continual "perishing of our outward
	man" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:16">2 Corinthians 4:16</span>), works
	peculiarly in us, and is the means of working <i>spiritual</i> "<i>life</i>"
	in you. The <i>life</i> whereof we witness in our bodily <i>dying,</i>
	extends beyond ourselves, and is brought by our very dying to you.</p>
