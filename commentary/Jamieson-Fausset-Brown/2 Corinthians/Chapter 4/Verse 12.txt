12. The "death"
	of Christ manifested in the continual "perishing of our outward
	man" (2 Corinthians 4:16), works
	peculiarly in us, and is the means of working spiritual "life"
	in you. The life whereof we witness in our bodily dying,
	extends beyond ourselves, and is brought by our very dying to you.
