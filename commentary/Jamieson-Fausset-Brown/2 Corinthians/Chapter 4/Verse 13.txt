<p><b>the same spirit of faith,

	Spirit acting on our spirit. Though "death worketh in us, and
	life in you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:12">2 Corinthians 4:12</span>),
	yet <i>as we have the same spirit of faith as you,</i> we therefore
	[believingly] look for the same immortal <i>life</i> as you [ESTIUS],
	and <i>speak</i> as we believe. ALFORD

	that described</i> in the Scriptures" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:12- :">2 Corinthians 4:12- :</span>). The balance of the sentence requires the parallelism to
	be this, "According to that which is written, I believed, and
	therefore have I spoken we also believe, and therefore speak,"
	namely, without fear, amidst "afflictions" and "deaths"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:17">2 Corinthians 4:17</span>).</p>
