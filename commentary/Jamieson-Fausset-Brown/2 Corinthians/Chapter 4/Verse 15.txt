	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span>). The <i>Greek</i> is
	susceptible also of this translation, "That grace, being made
	the greater (multiplied) on account of the thanksgiving of the
	greater number (for grace already received), may abound (abundantly
	redound) to," c. Thus the <i>Greek</i> for "abound"
	has not to be taken in an active sense, but in its ordinary neuter
	sense, and so the other <i>Greek</i> words. Thanksgiving invites more
	abundant grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+20:19-22">2 Chronicles 20:19-22</span>
