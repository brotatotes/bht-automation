	Compare "<i>now for a season</i> . . . in heaviness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The contrast, however, between this and the "ETERNAL
	weight of glory" requires, I think, the translation, "Which
	is but for <i>the present passing moment.</i>" So WAHL.
	"The <i>lightness</i> of affliction" (he does not <i>express</i>
	"burden" after "light"; the <i>Greek</i> is "the
	light of affliction") contrasts beautifully with the "<i>weight</i>
	of the glory."
