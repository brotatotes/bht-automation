<p><b>things . . . seen</b>—"earthly
	things" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:19">Philippians 3:19</span>). We
	mind not the things seen, whether affliction or refreshment come, so
	as to be seduced by the latter, or deterred by the former
	[CHRYSOSTOM].

<p><b>things . . . not seen</b>—not
	"the invisible things" of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:19- :">Philippians 3:19- :</span>, but the things which, though not seen now, shall be so
	hereafter.

<p><b>temporal</b>—rather, "for
	a time"; in contrast to eternal. <i>English Version</i> uses
	"temporal" for <i>temporary.</i> The <i>Greek</i> is
	rightly translated in the similar passage, "the pleasures of sin
	<i>for a season.</i>"</p>
