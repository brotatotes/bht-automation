<p><b>4. In whom</b>—Translate, "In
	whose case." 
	</p>
<p><b>god of this world</b>—The
	worldly <i>make him their God</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). He is, <i>in fact,</i> "the prince of the power of
	the air, <i>the spirit that ruleth in the children of disobedience</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>minds</b>—"understandings":
	"mental perceptions," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2- :">Ephesians 2:2- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>them which believe not</b>—the
	same as "them that are lost" (or "are perishing").
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:10-12">2 Thessalonians 2:10-12</span>.
	SOUTH quaintly says, "when
	the malefactor's eyes are covered, he is not far from his execution"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="es+7:8">Esther 7:8</span>). Those perishing
	unbelievers are not merely veiled, but blinded (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:14">2 Corinthians 3:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:15">2 Corinthians 3:15</span>): <i>Greek,</i> not
	"blinded," but "<i>hardened.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>light of the glorious gospel
	of Christ</b>—Translate, "The illumination (<i>enlightening:</i>
	the <i>propagation</i> from those already enlightened, to others <i>of
	the light</i>) of the Gospel of the glory of Christ." "The
	glory of Christ" is not a mere <i>quality</i> (as "glorious"
	would express) of the Gospel; it is its very <i>essence and subject
	matter.</i>
</p>
<p><b>image of God</b>—implying
	identity of nature and essence (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>).
	He who desires to see "the glory of God," may see it "in
	the face of Jesus Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:14-16">1 Timothy 6:14-16</span>). Paul here
	recurs to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>. Christ is
	"the image of God," into which "same image" we,
	looking on it in the mirror of the Gospel, are changed by the Spirit;
	but this image is not visible to those blinded by Satan [ALFORD].</p>
