<p><b>6. For</b>—proof that we are true
	servants of Jesus unto you.

<p><b>commanded the light</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"By speaking the word, commanded light" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>hath shined</b>—rather, as
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>is He who</i> shined." (It <i>is God</i>)
	<i>who commanded light,</i> c., <i>that shined,</i> &amp;c., (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): Himself our Light and Sun, as well as the Creator of
	light (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12">John 8:12</span>).
	The physical world answers to the spiritual.

<p><b>in our hearts</b>—in
	themselves dark.

<p><b>to give the light</b>—that
	is, to propagate <i>to others</i> the light, &amp;c., <i>which is in
	us</i> (compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12- :">John 8:12- :</span>).

<p><b>the glory of God</b>—answering
	to "the glory of Christ" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:12- :">John 8:12- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in the face of Jesus
	Christ</b>—Some of the oldest manuscripts retain "Jesus."
	Others omit it. Christ is the manifestation of the glory of God, as
	His image (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>). The
	allusion is still to the brightness on Moses' "face." The
	only true and full manifestation of God's brightness and glory is "in
	the face of Jesus" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>).</p>
