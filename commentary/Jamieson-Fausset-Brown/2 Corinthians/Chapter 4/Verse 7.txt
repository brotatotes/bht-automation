	How then is it that we continue to enjoy such unspeakable glory
	in a mortal body? Paul replies, this very fact is one of the most
	marvellous proofs of God's power, that an earthen vessel could bear
	such splendor and keep such a treasure" [CHRYSOSTOM,
	Homilies, 8.496, A]. The treasure or "the light of the
	knowledge of the glory of God." The fragile "earthen

	Spirit), in respect to its surpassing "excellency,"

	chipped and broken, that the excellency of the treasure contained,
	and of the power which that treasure has, may be all His (2 Corinthians 4:10
2 Corinthians 4:11; John 3:30).

	us—rather, as Greek, "may be God's (may be
	seen and be thankfully [2 Corinthians 4:15]
	acknowledged to belong to God), and not (to come) from
	us." The power not merely comes from God, but belongs
	to Him continually, and is to be ascribed to him.
