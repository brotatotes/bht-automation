<p><b>7.</b> "Lest any should say,
	How then is it that we continue to enjoy <i>such unspeakable glory</i>
	in a mortal body? Paul replies, this very fact is one of the most
	marvellous proofs of God's power, that an earthen vessel could bear
	such splendor and keep <i>such a treasure</i>" [CHRYSOSTOM,
	<i>Homilies,</i> 8.496, A]. The treasure or "the light of the
	knowledge of the glory of God." The fragile "earthen
	vessel" is the <i>body,</i> the "outward man" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>),
	liable to afflictions and death. So the light in Gideon's pitchers,
	the type (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+7:16-20">Judges 7:16-20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+7:22">Judges 7:22</span>). The ancients often kept
	their treasures in jars or vessels of earthenware. "There are
	earthen vessels which yet may be clean; whereas a golden vessel may
	be filthy" [BENGEL].

<p><b>that the excellency of the
	power,</b> c.—that the <i>power</i> of the ministry (the Holy
	Spirit), in respect to its surpassing "excellency,"
	exhibited in winning souls (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:4">1 Corinthians 2:4</span>)
	and in sustaining us ministers, might be ascribed solely to God, we
	being weak as earthen vessels. God often allows the vessel to be
	chipped and broken, that the excellency of the treasure contained,
	and of the power which that treasure has, may be all His (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>

<p><b>may be of God . . . not of
	us</b>—rather, as <i>Greek,</i> "may be <i>God's</i> (may be
	seen and be thankfully [<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:15">2 Corinthians 4:15</span>]
	acknowledged to <i>belong</i> to God), and not (to come) <i>from</i>
	us." The power not merely comes <i>from</i> God, but <i>belongs
	to</i> Him continually, and is to be ascribed to him.</p>
