<p><b>9. not forsaken</b>—by God and
	man. Jesus was forsaken by both; so much do His sufferings exceed
	those of His people (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:46">Matthew 27:46</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>cast down</b>—or "struck
	down"; not only "persecuted," that is, <i>chased</i>
	as a deer or bird (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+26:20">1 Samuel 26:20</span>),
	but actually <i>struck</i> down as with a dart in the chase (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+26:20- :">1 Samuel 26:20- :</span>). The <i>Greek</i> "always" in this verse
	means, "throughout the whole time"; in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+26:20- :">1 Samuel 26:20- :</span> the <i>Greek</i> is different, and means, "at every
	time," "in every case when the occasion occurs."</p>
