<p><b>10. appear</b>—rather, "be
	made manifest," namely, in our true character. So "appear,"
	<i>Greek,</i> "be manifested" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span>). We
	are at all times, even now, manifest to God; <i>then</i> we shall be
	so to the assembled intelligent universe and to ourselves: for the
	judgment shall be not only in order to assign the everlasting portion
	to each, but to vindicate God's righteousness, so that it shall be
	manifest to all His creatures, and even to the conscience of the
	sinner himself.

<p><b>receive</b>—His reward of
	grace proportioned to "the things done," c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:6-9">2 Corinthians 9:6-9</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:8">2 John 1:8</span>). Though salvation be of
	grace purely, independent of works, the saved may have a greater or
	less <i>reward,</i> according as he lives to, and labors for, Christ
	more or less. Hence there is scope for the holy "ambition"
	(see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:9">2 Corinthians 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:9- :">2 Corinthians 5:9- :</span>). This verse guards against the Corinthians supposing that
	<i>all</i> share in the house "from heaven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:2">2 Corinthians 5:2</span>). There shall be a
	searching judgment which shall sever the bad from the good, according
	to their respective,deeds, the <i>motive</i> of the deeds being taken
	into account, not the mere external act; faith and love to God are
	the sole motives recognized by God as sound and good (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:36">Matthew 12:36</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:37">Matthew 12:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:35-45">Matthew 25:35-45</span>),

<p><b>done in his body</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> may be, "by the instrumentality of the body";
	but <i>English Version</i> is legitimate (compare <i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:35-40.25.45- :">Matthew 25:35-40.25.45- :</span>). Justice requires that <i>substantially the same</i> body
	which has been the instrument of the unbelievers' sin, should be the
	object of punishment. A proof of the essential identity of the
	natural and the resurrection body.</p>
