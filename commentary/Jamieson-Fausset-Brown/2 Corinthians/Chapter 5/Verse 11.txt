<p><b>11. terror of the Lord</b>—the
	coming judgment, so full of terrors to unbelievers [ESTIUS].
	ELLICOTT and ALFORD,
	after GROTIUS and BENGEL,
	translate, "The fear of the Lord" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:1">2 Corinthians 7:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+12:13">Ecclesiastes 12:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:31">Acts 9:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:18">Romans 3:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21">Ephesians 5:21</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>persuade</b>—Ministers
	should use the terrors of the Lord to <i>persuade</i> men, not to
	rouse their enmity (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:23">Judges 1:23</span>).
	BENGEL, ESTIUS,
	and ALFORD explain:
	"Persuade men" (by our whole lives, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:23- :">Judges 1:23- :</span>), namely, of our integrity as ministers. But this would have
	been expressed after "persuade," had it been the sense. The
	connection seems as follows: He had been accused of seeking to please
	and win men, he therefore says (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:23- :">Judges 1:23- :</span>), "It is as knowing the terror (or <i>fear</i>) of the
	Lord that we persuade men; but (whether <i>men</i> who hear our
	preaching recognize our sincerity or not) we are made manifest unto
	God as acting on such motives (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:23- :">Judges 1:23- :</span>); and I trust also in your consciences." Those so
	"manifested" need have no "terror" as to their
	being "manifested (<i>English Version,</i> 'appear') before the
	judgment-seat" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>).</p>
