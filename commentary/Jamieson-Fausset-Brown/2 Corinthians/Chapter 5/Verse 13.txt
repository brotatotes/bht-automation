<p><b>13. be</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"have been." The contrast is between the single act implied
	by the past tense, "If we <i>have ever been</i> beside
	ourselves," and the habitual state implied by the present, "Or
	whether we <i>be</i> sober," that is, <i>of sound mind.</i>
	beside ourselves—The accusation brought by Festus against him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The holy enthusiasm with which he spake of what God
	effected by His apostolic ministry, seemed to many to be <i>boasting
	madness.</i>
</p>
<p><b>sober</b>—humbling myself
	before you, and not using my apostolic power and privileges. 
	</p>
<p><b>to God . . . for your
	cause</b>—The glorifying of his office was not for his own, but for
	God's glory. The abasing of himself was in adaptation to their
	infirmity, to gain them to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
