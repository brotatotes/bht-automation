<p><b>14. For</b>—Accounting for his
	being "beside himself" with enthusiasm: the love of Christ
	towards us (in His death for us, the highest proof of it, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), producing in turn love in us to Him, and not mere
	"terror" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:11">2 Corinthians 5:11</span>).

<p><b>constraineth us</b>—with
	irresistible power <i>limits</i> us to the one great object to the
	exclusion of other considerations. The <i>Greek</i> implies <i>to
	compress forcibly</i> the energies into one channel. Love is <i>jealous</i>
	of any rival object engrossing the soul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:11- :">2 Corinthians 5:11- :</span>).

	a judgment formed at conversion, and ever since regarded as a settled
	truth.

<p><b>that if</b>—that is, that
	<i>since.</i> But the oldest manuscripts omit "if." "That
	one died for all (<i>Greek,</i> 'in behalf of all')." Thus the
	following clause will be, "Therefore all (literally, '<i>the</i>
	all,' namely, for whom He 'died') died." <i>His</i> dying is
	just the same as if <i>they all died;</i> and in their so dying, they
	died to sin and self, that they might live to God their Redeemer,
	whose henceforth they are (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2-11">Romans 6:2-11</span>;
