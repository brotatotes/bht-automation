14. For—Accounting for his
	being "beside himself" with enthusiasm: the love of Christ
	towards us (in His death for us, the highest proof of it,  :-), producing in turn love in us to Him, and not mere
	"terror" (2 Corinthians 5:11). 
	constraineth us—with
	irresistible power limits us to the one great object to the
	exclusion of other considerations. The Greek implies to
	compress forcibly the energies into one channel. Love is jealous

	because we thus
	judge—literally, "(as) having judged thus"; implying
	a judgment formed at conversion, and ever since regarded as a settled
	truth. 
	that if—that is, that
	since. But the oldest manuscripts omit "if." "That
	one died for all (Greek, 'in behalf of all')." Thus the
	following clause will be, "Therefore all (literally, 'the
	all,' namely, for whom He 'died') died." His dying is
	just the same as if they all died; and in their so dying, they
	died to sin and self, that they might live to God their Redeemer,
	whose henceforth they are (Romans 6:2-11;
	Galatians 2:20; Colossians 3:3;
	1 Peter 4:1-3).
