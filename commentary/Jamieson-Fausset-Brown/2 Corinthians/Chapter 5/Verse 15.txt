<p><b>15. they which live</b>—in the
	present life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:11">2 Corinthians 4:11</span>, "we
	which live") [ALFORD];
	or, they who are thus indebted to Him for life of soul as well as
	body [MENOCHIUS]. 
	</p>
<p><b>died for them</b>—He does
	not add, "rose again for them," a phrase not found in
	Paul's language [BENGEL].
	He died <i>in their stead,</i> He arose again <i>for their good,</i>
	"<i>for</i> (<i>the effecting of</i>) their justification"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>), and that He might be
	their Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:7-9">Romans 14:7-9</span>).
	ELLICOTT and ALFORD
	join "for them" with both "died" and "rose
	again"; as Christ's death is <i>our death,</i> so His
	resurrection is <i>our resurrection; Greek,</i> "Who for them
	died and rose again." 
	</p>
<p><b>not henceforth</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"no longer"; namely, now that His death for them has taken
	place, and that they know that His death saves them from death
	eternal, and His resurrection life brings spiritual and everlasting
	life to them.</p>
