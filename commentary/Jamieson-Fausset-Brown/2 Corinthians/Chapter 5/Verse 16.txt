16. Wherefore—because of our
	settled judgment (2 Corinthians 5:14),
	henceforth—since our
	knowing Christ's constraining love in His death for us. 
	know we no man after the
	flesh—that is, according to his mere worldly and external
	relations (2 Corinthians 11:18; John 8:15;
	Philippians 3:4), as distinguished from
	what he is according to the Spirit, as a "new creature"
	(2 Corinthians 5:17). For instance, the
	outward distinctions of Jew or Gentile, rich or poor, slave or free,
	learned or unlearned, are lost sight of in the higher life of those
	who are dead in Christ's death, and alive with Him in the new life of
	His resurrection (Galatians 2:6;
	Galatians 3:28). 
	yea, though—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "if even." 
	known Christ after the
	flesh—Paul when a Jew had looked for a temporal reigning, not a
	spiritual, Messiah. (He says "Christ," not Jesus:
	for he had not known personally Jesus in the days of His flesh, but
	he had looked for Christ or the Messiah). When once he was converted
	he no longer "conferred with flesh and blood" (Galatians 3:28- :). He had this advantage over the Twelve, that as one born
	out of due time he had never known Christ save in His heavenly life.
	To the Twelve it was "expedient that Christ should go away"
	that the Comforter should come, and so they might know Christ in the
	higher spiritual aspect and in His new life-giving power, and not
	merely "after the flesh," in the carnal aspect of Him
	(Romans 6:9-11; 1 Corinthians 15:45;
	1 Peter 3:18; 1 Peter 4:1;
	1 Peter 4:2). Doubtless Judaizing
	Christians at Corinth prided themselves on the mere fleshly (1 Peter 4:2- :) advantage of their belonging to Israel, the nation of
	Christ, or on their having seen Him in the flesh, and thence claimed
	superiority over others as having a nearer connection with Him
	(2 Corinthians 5:12; 2 Corinthians 10:7).
	Paul here shows the true aim should be to know Him spiritually as new
	creatures (2 Corinthians 5:15; 2 Corinthians 5:17),
	and that outward relations towards Him profit nothing (Luke 18:19-21;
	John 16:7; John 16:22;
	Philippians 3:3-10). This is at
	variance with both Romish Mariolatry and transubstantiation. Two
	distinct Greek verbs are used here for "know"; the
	first ("know we no man") means "to be
	personally acquainted with"; the latter ("known Christ . .
	. know . . . more") is to recognize, or estimate. Paul's
	estimate of Christ, or the expected Messiah, was carnal, but
	is so now no more.
