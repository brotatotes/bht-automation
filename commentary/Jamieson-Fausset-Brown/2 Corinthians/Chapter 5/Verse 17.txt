<p><b>17. Therefore</b>—connected with
	the words in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:16">2 Corinthians 5:16</span>, "We
	know Christ no more after the flesh." As Christ has entered on
	His new heavenly life by His resurrection and ascension, so all who
	are "in Christ" (that is, united to Him by faith as the
	branch is In the vine) are new creatures (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:16- :">2 Corinthians 5:16- :</span>). "New" in the <i>Greek</i> implies a new nature
	quite different from anything previously existing, not merely <i>recent,</i>
	which is expressed by a different <i>Greek</i> word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:16- :">2 Corinthians 5:16- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>creature</b>—literally,
	"creation," and so the <i>creature</i> resulting from the
	creation (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:3">John 3:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5">John 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:10">Ephesians 2:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:23">Ephesians 4:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11">Colossians 3:11</span>). As we are "in
	Christ," so "God was in Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11- :">Colossians 3:11- :</span>): hence He is Mediator between God and us.

<p><b>old things</b>—selfish,
	carnal views (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:16">2 Corinthians 5:16</span>)
	of ourselves, of other men, and of Christ.
