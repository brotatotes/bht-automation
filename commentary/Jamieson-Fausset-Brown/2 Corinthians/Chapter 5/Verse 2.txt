<p><b>2. For in this</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"For <i>also</i> in this"; "herein" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). ALFORD takes
	it, "in this" tabernacle. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, which seems parallel, favors this. But the parallelism is
	sufficiently exact by making "in this we groan" refer
	generally to what was just said (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), namely, that we cannot obtain our "house in the
	heavens" except our "earthly tabernacle" be first
	dissolved by death. 
	</p>
<p><b>we groan</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) under the body's weaknesses now and liability to death. 
	</p>
<p><b>earnestly desiring to be
	clothed upon</b>—translate, "earnestly <i>longing</i> to <i>have
	ourselves clothed upon,</i>" c., namely, by being found <i>alive</i>
	at Christ's coming, and so to escape <i>dissolution</i> by death
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</span>),
	and to have our heavenly body put on over the earthly. The groans of
	the saints prove the existence of the longing desire for the heavenly
	glory, a desire which cannot be planted by God within us in vain, as
	doomed to disappointment. 
	</p>
<p><b>our house</b>—different
	<i>Greek</i> from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>;
	translate, "our habitation," "our domicile"; it
	has a more distinct reference to the <i>inhabitant</i> than the
	general term "house" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1- :">2 Corinthians 5:1- :</span>) [BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>from heaven</b>—This
	domicile is "<i>from heaven</i>" in its origin, and is to
	be brought to us by the Lord at His coming again "from heaven"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>). Therefore this
	"habitation" or "domicile" is not heaven itself.</p>
