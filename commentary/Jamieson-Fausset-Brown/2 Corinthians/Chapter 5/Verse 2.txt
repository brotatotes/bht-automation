2. For in this—Greek,
	"For also in this"; "herein" ( :-). ALFORD takes
	it, "in this" tabernacle.  :-, which seems parallel, favors this. But the parallelism is
	sufficiently exact by making "in this we groan" refer
	generally to what was just said ( :-), namely, that we cannot obtain our "house in the
	heavens" except our "earthly tabernacle" be first
	dissolved by death. 
	we groan— ( :-) under the body's weaknesses now and liability to death. 
	earnestly desiring to be
	clothed upon—translate, "earnestly longing to have
	ourselves clothed upon," c., namely, by being found alive
	at Christ's coming, and so to escape dissolution by death
	(2 Corinthians 5:1 2 Corinthians 5:4),
	and to have our heavenly body put on over the earthly. The groans of
	the saints prove the existence of the longing desire for the heavenly
	glory, a desire which cannot be planted by God within us in vain, as
	doomed to disappointment. 
	our house—different
	Greek from that in 2 Corinthians 5:1;
	translate, "our habitation," "our domicile"; it
	has a more distinct reference to the inhabitant than the
	general term "house" (2 Corinthians 5:1- :) [BENGEL]. 
	from heaven—This
	domicile is "from heaven" in its origin, and is to
	be brought to us by the Lord at His coming again "from heaven"
	(1 Thessalonians 4:16). Therefore this
	"habitation" or "domicile" is not heaven itself.
