<p><b>20. for Christ . . . in Christ's
	stead</b>—The <i>Greek</i> of both is the same: translate in both
	cases "on Christ's behalf." 
	</p>
<p><b>beseech . . . pray</b>—rather,
	"entreat [plead with you] . . . beseech." Such "beseeching"
	is uncommon in the case of "ambassadors," who generally
	stand on their dignity (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:2">2 Corinthians 10:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:6">1 Thessalonians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:7">1 Thessalonians 2:7</span>).

<p><b>be ye reconciled to
	God</b>—<i>English Version</i> here inserts "ye," which
	is not in the original, and which gives the wrong impression, as if
	it were emphatic thus: <i>God</i> is reconciled to you, be ye
	reconciled to God. The <i>Greek</i> expresses rather, God was the
	RECONCILER in Christ . . .
	let this reconciliation then have its designed effect. <i>Be
	reconciled to God,</i> that is, let God reconcile you to Himself
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18">2 Corinthians 5:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span>).</p>
