	course here on earth. 
	not by sight—Greek,
	"not by appearance." Our life is governed by faith in our
	immortal hope; not by the outward specious appearance of
	present things [TITTMANN,
	Greek Synonyms of the New Testament]. Compare "apparently,"
	the Septuagint, "by appearance,"  :-. WAHL supports
	English Version. 2 Corinthians 4:18
	also confirms it (compare Romans 8:24;
	1 Corinthians 13:12; 1 Corinthians 13:13).
	God has appointed in this life faith for our great duty, and
	in the next, vision for our reward [SOUTH]
	(1 Peter 1:8).
