<p><b>not by sight</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"not by appearance." Our life is governed by faith in our
	immortal hope; not by the outward specious <i>appearance</i> of
	present things [TITTMANN,
	<i>Greek Synonyms of the New Testament</i>]. Compare "apparently,"
	the <i>Septuagint,</i> "by appearance," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. WAHL supports
