8. willingâ€”literally, "well
	content." Translate also, "To go (literally, migrate)
	from our home in the body, and to come to our home with the Lord."
	We should prefer to be found alive at the Lord's coming, and to be
	clothed upon with our heavenly body ( :-). But feeling, as we do, the sojourn in the body to be a
	separation from our true home "with the Lord," we prefer
	even dissolution by death, so that in the intermediate disembodied
	state we may go to be "with the Lord" ( :-). "To be with Christ" (the disembodied state) is
	distinguished from Christ's coming to take us to be with Him
	in soul and body ( :-, "with the Lord"). Perhaps the disembodied
	spirits of believers have fulness of communion with Christ
	unseen; but not the mutual recognition of one another, until clothed
	with their visible bodies at the resurrection (compare  :-), when they shall with joy recognize Christ's image in
	each other perfect.
