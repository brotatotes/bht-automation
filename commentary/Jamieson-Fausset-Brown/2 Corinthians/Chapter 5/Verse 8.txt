<p><b>8. willing</b>â€”literally, "well
	content." Translate also, "To go (literally, <i>migrate</i>)
	from our home in the body, and to come to our home with the Lord."
	We should prefer to be found alive at the Lord's coming, and to be
	clothed upon with our heavenly body (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). But feeling, as we do, the sojourn in the body to be a
	separation from our true home "with the Lord," we prefer
	even dissolution by death, so that <i>in the intermediate disembodied
	state</i> we may go to be "with the Lord" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "To be with Christ" (the disembodied state) is
	distinguished from Christ's coming to take us to <i>be with Him</i>
	in soul and body (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "with the Lord"). Perhaps the disembodied
	spirits of believers have fulness of communion <i>with Christ</i>
	unseen; but not the mutual recognition of one another, until clothed
	with their visible bodies at the resurrection (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), when they shall with joy recognize Christ's image in
	each other perfect.</p>
