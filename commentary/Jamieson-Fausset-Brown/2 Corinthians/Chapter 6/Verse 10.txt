	(1 Corinthians 1:5), after the example of
	our Lord, who "by His poverty made many rich" (1 Corinthians 1:5- :). 
	having nothing—Whatever
	of earthly goods we have, and these are few, we have as though we had

	possessing all things—The
	Greek implies firm possession, holding fast in possession

	sense, the believer's in possession, for he possesses them all in
	Christ, his lasting possession, though the full fruition of
	them is reserved for the future eternity.
