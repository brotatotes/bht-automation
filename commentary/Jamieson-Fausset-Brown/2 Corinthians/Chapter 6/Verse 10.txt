<p><b>10.</b> The "as" no longer
	is used to express the opinion of his adversaries, but the real state
	of him and his fellow laborers.

<p><b>making many rich</b>—Spiritually
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:5">1 Corinthians 1:5</span>), after the example of
	our Lord, who "by His poverty made many rich" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:5- :">1 Corinthians 1:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>having nothing</b>—Whatever
	of earthly goods we have, and these are few, we have as though we had
	not; as tenants removable at will, not owners (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:5- :">1 Corinthians 1:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>possessing all things</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> implies <i>firm possession, holding fast in possession</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21">1 Corinthians 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:22">1 Corinthians 3:22</span>).
	The things both of the present and of the future are, in the truest
	sense, the believer's in possession, for he possesses them all in
	Christ, his lasting possession, though the full <i>fruition</i> of
	them is reserved for the future eternity.</p>
