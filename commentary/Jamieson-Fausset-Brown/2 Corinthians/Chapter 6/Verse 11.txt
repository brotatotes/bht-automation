<p><b>11. mouth . . . open unto you</b>â€”I
	use no concealment, such as some at Corinth have insinuated (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). I use all freedom and openness of speech to you as to
	beloved friends. Hence he introduces here, "O Corinthians"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:15">Philippians 4:15</span>). The
	<i>enlargement</i> of his <i>heart</i> towards them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:15- :">Philippians 4:15- :</span>) produced his <i>openness</i> of <i>mouth,</i> that is, his
	unreserved expression of his inmost feelings. As an unloving man is
	<i>narrow</i> in heart, so the apostle's heart is <i>enlarged</i> by
	love, so as to take in his converts at Corinth, not only with their
	graces, but with their many shortcomings (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+4:29">1 Kings 4:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+119:32">Psalms 119:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:5">Isaiah 60:5</span>).</p>
