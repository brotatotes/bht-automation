<p><b>12.</b> Any constraint ye feel
	towards me, or narrowness of heart, is not from want of largeness of
	heart on my part towards you, but from want of it on your part
	towards me.

<p><b>bowels</b>—that is,
	affections (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:15">2 Corinthians 12:15</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>not straitened in us</b>—that
	is, for want of room in our hearts to take you in.</p>
