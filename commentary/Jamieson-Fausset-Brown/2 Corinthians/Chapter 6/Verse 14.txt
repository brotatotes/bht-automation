<p><b>14. Be not</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>Become</i> not."

<p><b>unequally yoked</b>—"yoked
	with one alien in spirit." The image is from the symbolical
	precept of the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+19:19">Leviticus 19:19</span>),
	"Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind";
	or the precept (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+22:10">Deuteronomy 22:10</span>),
	"Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together."
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+7:3">Deuteronomy 7:3</span>, forbidding
	marriages with the heathen; also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+7:3- :">Deuteronomy 7:3- :</span>. The believer and unbeliever are utterly <i>heterogeneous.</i>
	Too close intercourse with unbelievers in other relations also is
	included (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:16">2 Corinthians 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:10">1 Corinthians 8:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:14">1 Corinthians 10:14</span>).

<p><b>fellowship</b>—literally,
	"share," or "participation." 
	</p>
<p><b>righteousness</b>—the state
	of the believer, justified by faith. 
	</p>
<p><b>unrighteousness</b>—rather,
	as always translated elsewhere, "iniquity"; the state of
	the unbeliever, the fruit of unbelief. 
	</p>
<p><b>light</b>—of which
	believers are the children (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:14- :">1 Corinthians 10:14- :</span>).</p>
