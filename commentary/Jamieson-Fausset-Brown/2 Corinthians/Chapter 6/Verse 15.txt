<p><b>15. Belial</b>—<i>Hebrew,</i>
	"worthlessness, unprofitableness, wickedness." As Satan is
	opposed to God, and Antichrist to Christ; Belial being here opposed
	to Christ, must denounce all manner of Antichristian uncleanness
	[BENGEL].

<p><b>he that believeth with an
	infidel</b>—Translate, "a believer with an unbeliever."</p>
