17. Quoted from  :-, with the freedom of one inspired, who gives variations
	sanctioned by the Holy Spirit. 
	be ye separate—"be
	separated" (Hosea 4:17). 
	touch not the unclean
	thing—rather, "anything unclean" (2 Corinthians 7:1;
	Micah 2:10). Touching is
	more polluting, as implying participation, than seeing. 
	receive you—The Greek
	implies, "to myself"; as persons heretofore out of doors,
	but now admitted within (Micah 2:10- :). With this accords the clause, "Come out from
	among them," namely, so as to be received to me. So Micah 2:10- :, "I will accept you"; and Micah 2:10- :, "gather her that was driven out." "The
	intercourse of believers with the world should resemble that of
	angels, who, when they have been sent a message from heaven,
	discharge their office with the utmost promptness, and joyfully fly
	back home to the presence of God" (1 Corinthians 7:31;
	1 Corinthians 5:9; 1 Corinthians 5:10).
