	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+2:10">Micah 2:10</span>). <i>Touching</i> is

<p><b>receive you</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	implies, "to myself"; as persons heretofore out of doors,
	but now admitted <i>within</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+2:10- :">Micah 2:10- :</span>). With this accords the clause, "Come <i>out from
	among</i> them," namely, so as to be received to me. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+2:10- :">Micah 2:10- :</span>, "I will accept you"; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+2:10- :">Micah 2:10- :</span>, "gather her that was driven out." "The
	intercourse of believers with the world should resemble that of
	angels, who, when they have been sent a message from heaven,
	discharge their office with the utmost promptness, and joyfully fly
	back home to the presence of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:31">1 Corinthians 7:31</span>;
