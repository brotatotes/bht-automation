<p><b>3.</b> Resuming the connection with
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:1">2 Corinthians 6:1</span>, interrupted by the
	parenthetical <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:2">2 Corinthians 6:2</span>. "Giving
	no offense" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:2- :">2 Corinthians 6:2- :</span>), "approving ourselves," and all the other
	participles down to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:10">2 Corinthians 6:10</span>,
	are nominatives to "we also entreat you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:10- :">2 Corinthians 6:10- :</span>), to show the pains he took to enforce his exhortation by
	example, as well as precept [ALFORD].
	"Offense" would be given, if we were without "patience"
	and the other qualifications which he therefore subjoins (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:10- :">2 Corinthians 6:10- :</span>).</p>
