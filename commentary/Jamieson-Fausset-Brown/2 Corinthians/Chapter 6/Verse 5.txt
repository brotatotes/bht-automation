<p><b>fastings</b>—The context
	here refers to his <i>trials,</i> rather than <i>devotional exercises</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:27">2 Corinthians 11:27</span>). Thus
	"foodlessness" would seem to be the sense (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:11">1 Corinthians 4:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:12">Philippians 4:12</span>). But the usual sense of
	the <i>Greek</i> is <i>fasts,</i> in the strict sense; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:12- :">Philippians 4:12- :</span> it is spoken of independently of "hunger and thirst."

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:3">Mark 8:3</span>, justify the sense, more
	favored by the context, <i>foodlessness,</i> though a rare use of the
	word. GAUSSEN remarks "The
	apostles combine the highest offices with the humblest exterior: as
	everything in the Church was to be cast in the mould of death and
	resurrection, the cardinal principle throughout Christianity."</p>
