5. stripes— (2 Corinthians 11:23;
	2 Corinthians 11:24; Acts 16:23).
	imprisonments— (Acts 16:23- :). He had been, doubtless, elsewhere imprisoned besides at
	Philippi when he wrote this Epistle. 
	tumults— (Acts 13:50;
	Acts 14:5; Acts 14:19;
	Acts 16:22; and recently Acts 16:22- :). 
	labours—in the cause of
	Christ (2 Corinthians 11:23; Romans 16:12).
	watchings— (Romans 16:12- :). Sleepless nights. 
	fastings—The context
	here refers to his trials, rather than devotional exercises
	(compare 2 Corinthians 11:27). Thus
	"foodlessness" would seem to be the sense (compare 1 Corinthians 4:11;
	Philippians 4:12). But the usual sense of
	the Greek is fasts, in the strict sense; and in Philippians 4:12- : it is spoken of independently of "hunger and thirst."
	(Compare Luke 2:37; Acts 10:30;
	Acts 14:23). However, Matthew 15:32;
	Mark 8:3, justify the sense, more
	favored by the context, foodlessness, though a rare use of the
	word. GAUSSEN remarks "The
	apostles combine the highest offices with the humblest exterior: as
	everything in the Church was to be cast in the mould of death and
	resurrection, the cardinal principle throughout Christianity."
