1. cleanse ourselves—This is
	the conclusion of the exhortation (2 Corinthians 6:1;
	2 Corinthians 6:14; 1 John 3:3;
	Revelation 22:11). 
	filthiness—"the
	unclean thing" (2 Corinthians 6:17).
	of the flesh—for
	instance, fornication, prevalent at Corinth (2 Corinthians 6:17- :). 
	and spirit—for
	instance, idolatry, direct or indirect (1 Corinthians 6:9;
	1 Corinthians 8:1; 1 Corinthians 8:7;
	1 Corinthians 10:7; 1 Corinthians 10:21;
	1 Corinthians 10:22). The spirit (1 Corinthians 10:22- :) receives pollution through the flesh, the instrument of
	uncleanness. 
	perfecting holiness—The
	cleansing away impurity is a positive step towards holiness
	(2 Corinthians 6:17). It is not enough to
	begin; the end crowns the work (Galatians 3:3;
	Galatians 5:7; Philippians 1:6).
	fear of God—often
	conjoined with the consideration of the most glorious promises
	(2 Corinthians 5:11; Hebrews 4:1).
	Privilege and promise go hand in hand.
