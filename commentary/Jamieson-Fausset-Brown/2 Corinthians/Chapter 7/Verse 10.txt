<p><b>10. worketh . . . worketh</b>—In
	the best <i>Greek</i> reading the translation is, "worketh
	(simply) . . . worketh <i>out.</i>" "Sorrow" is not
	repentance, but, where it is "godly," "worketh"
	it; that is, <i>contributes</i> or <i>tends to</i> it (the same <i>Greek</i>
	word is in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:10">Romans 13:10</span>). The
	"sorrow of the world" (that is, such as is felt by the
	worldly) "worketh <i>out,</i>" as its <i>result at last,</i>
	(eternal) death (the same <i>Greek</i> verb is in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:10- :">Romans 13:10- :</span>; also see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:17">2 Corinthians 4:17</span>).

<p><b>repentance . . . not to be
	repented of</b>—There is not in the <i>Greek</i> this play on
	words, so that the word qualified is not "repentance"
	merely, but "repentance unto salvation"; this, he says,
	<i>none will ever regret,</i> however attended with "sorrow"
	at the time. "<i>Repentance</i>" implies a <i>coming to a
	right mind;</i> "regret" implies merely uneasiness of
	feeling at the past or present, and is applied even to the <i>remorse</i>
	of Judas (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:3">Matthew 27:3</span>; <i>Greek,</i>
	"stricken with remorse," not as <i>English Version,</i>
	"repented himself"); so that, though always accompanying
	repentance, it is not always accompanied by repentance. "Repentance"
	removes the impediments in the way of "salvation" (to which
	"death," namely, of the soul, is opposed). "The sorrow
	of the world" is not at the <i>sin</i> itself, but at its <i>penal
	consequences:</i> so that the tears of pain are no sooner dried up,
	than the pleasures of ungodliness are renewed. So Pharaoh, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+9:27">Exodus 9:27</span>;
