<p><b>11.</b> Confirmation of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> from the Corinthians' own experience. 
	</p>
<p><b>carefulness</b>—solicitude,
	literally, "diligence"; opposed to their past negligence in
	the matter. 
	</p>
<p><b>in you</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	"for you." 
	</p>
<p><b>yea</b>—not only
	"carefulness" or <i>diligence,</i> but also "clearing
	of yourselves," namely, to me by Titus: anxiety to show you
	disapproved of the deed. 
	</p>
<p><b>indignation</b>—against the
	offender. 
	</p>
<p><b>fear</b>—of the wrath of
	God, and of sinning any more [SCLATER
	and CALVIN]; fear of Paul
	[GROTIUS], (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:2">1 Corinthians 4:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:19-21">1 Corinthians 4:19-21</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>vehement desire</b>—longing
	for restoration to Paul's approval [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON]. "Fear"
	is in spite of one's self. "Longing desire" is spontaneous,
	and implies strong love and an aspiration for correction [CALVIN].
	"Desire" <i>for the presence of Paul,</i> as he had given
	them the hope of it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:19">1 Corinthians 4:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:5">1 Corinthians 16:5</span>) [GROTIUS
	and ESTIUS]. 
	</p>
<p><b>zeal</b>—for right and for
	God's honor against what is wrong. Or, "for the good of the soul
	of the offender" [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>revenge</b>—<i>Translate,</i>
	"Exacting of punishment" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:2">1 Corinthians 5:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:3">1 Corinthians 5:3</span>). Their "carefulness"
	was exhibited in the six points just specified: "clearing of
	themselves," and "indignation" in relation to
	themselves; "fear" and "vehement desire" in
	respect to the apostle; "zeal" and "revenge" in
	respect to the offender [BENGEL];
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:7">2 Corinthians 7:7</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>In all</b>—the respects
	just stated. 
	</p>
<p><b>clear</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"pure," namely, from complicity in the guilty deed.
	"Approved yourselves," <i>Greek,</i> "commended
	yourselves." Whatever suspicion of complicity rested on you
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:2">1 Corinthians 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:6">1 Corinthians 5:6</span>)
	through your former remissness, you have cleared off by your present
	strenuousness in reprobating the deed.</p>
