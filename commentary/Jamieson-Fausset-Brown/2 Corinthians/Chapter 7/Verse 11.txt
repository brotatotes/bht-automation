11. Confirmation of  :- from the Corinthians' own experience. 
	carefulness—solicitude,
	literally, "diligence"; opposed to their past negligence in
	the matter. 
	in you—Greek
	"for you." 
	yea—not only
	"carefulness" or diligence, but also "clearing
	of yourselves," namely, to me by Titus: anxiety to show you
	disapproved of the deed. 
	indignation—against the
	offender. 
	fear—of the wrath of
	God, and of sinning any more [SCLATER
	and CALVIN]; fear of Paul
	[GROTIUS], (1 Corinthians 4:2;
	1 Corinthians 4:19-21). 
	vehement desire—longing
	for restoration to Paul's approval [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON]. "Fear"
	is in spite of one's self. "Longing desire" is spontaneous,
	and implies strong love and an aspiration for correction [CALVIN].
	"Desire" for the presence of Paul, as he had given
	them the hope of it (1 Corinthians 4:19;
	1 Corinthians 16:5) [GROTIUS
	and ESTIUS]. 
	zeal—for right and for
	God's honor against what is wrong. Or, "for the good of the soul
	of the offender" [BENGEL].
	revenge—Translate,
	"Exacting of punishment" (1 Corinthians 5:2;
	1 Corinthians 5:3). Their "carefulness"
	was exhibited in the six points just specified: "clearing of
	themselves," and "indignation" in relation to
	themselves; "fear" and "vehement desire" in
	respect to the apostle; "zeal" and "revenge" in
	respect to the offender [BENGEL];
	(compare 2 Corinthians 7:7). 
	In all—the respects
	just stated. 
	clear—Greek,
	"pure," namely, from complicity in the guilty deed.
	"Approved yourselves," Greek, "commended
	yourselves." Whatever suspicion of complicity rested on you
	(1 Corinthians 5:2; 1 Corinthians 5:6)
	through your former remissness, you have cleared off by your present
	strenuousness in reprobating the deed.
