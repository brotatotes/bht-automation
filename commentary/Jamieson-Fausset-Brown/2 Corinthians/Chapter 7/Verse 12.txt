	c.—Some of the oldest manuscripts read thus, "That YOUR
	care for us might be made manifest unto you," &c. But the
	words, "unto you," thus, would be rather obscure still the
	obscurity of the genuine reading may have been the very reason for
	the change being made by correctors into the reading of English
	Version. ALFORD
	explains the reading: "He wrote in order to bring out their zeal
	on his behalf (that is, to obey his command), and make it manifest to
	themselves in God's sight, that is, to bring out among them
	their zeal to regard and obey him." But some of the oldest
	manuscripts and versions (including the Vulgate and old
	Italian) support English Version. And the words, "to
	you," suit it better than the other reading. 1 Corinthians 5:1- :, "I wrote . . . that ye might know the love which I have
	more abundantly unto you," plainly accords with it, and
	disproves ALFORD'S
	assertion that English Version is inconsistent with the
	fact as to the purpose of his letter. His writing, he says, was
	not so much for the sake of the individual offender, or the
	individual offended, but from his "earnest care" or concern
	for the welfare of the Church.
