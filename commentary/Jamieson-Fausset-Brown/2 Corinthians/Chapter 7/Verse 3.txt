3. In excusing myself, I do not
	accuse you, as though you suspected me of such things [MENOCHIUS],
	or as though you were guilty of such things; for I speak only of the
	false apostles [ESTIUS and
	Greek commentators]. Rather, "as though you were
	ungrateful and treacherous" [BEZA].
	I have said before—in
	2 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 6:12;
	compare Philippians 1:7. 
	die and live with you—the
	height of friendship. I am ready to die and live with you and for you
	(Philippians 1:7; Philippians 1:20;
	Philippians 1:24; Philippians 2:17;
	Philippians 2:18). Compare as to Christ,
	John 10:11.
