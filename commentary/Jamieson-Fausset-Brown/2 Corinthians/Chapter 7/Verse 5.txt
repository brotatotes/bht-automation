5. Greek, "For also"
	(for "even"). This verse is thus connected with
	2 Corinthians 7:5; 2 Corinthians 2:12;
	2 Corinthians 2:13, "When I came to
	Troas, I had no rest in my spirit"; so "also"
	now, when I came to Macedonia, my "flesh" had no
	rest (he, by the term "flesh," excepts his spiritual
	consolations) from "fightings" with adversaries "without"
	(1 Corinthians 5:12), and from fears for
	the Corinthian believers "within" the Church, owing to
	"false brethren" (1 Corinthians 5:12- :). Compare 2 Corinthians 4:8;
	Deuteronomy 32:25, to which he seems to
	allude.
