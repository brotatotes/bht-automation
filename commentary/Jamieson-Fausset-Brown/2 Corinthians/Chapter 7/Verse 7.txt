<p><b>7. when he told us</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"telling us." We shared in the comfort which Titus felt in
	recording your desire (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:13">2 Corinthians 7:13</span>).
	<i>He</i> rejoiced in telling the news; <i>we</i> in hearing them
	[ALFORD]. 
	</p>
<p><b>earnest desire</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"longing desire," namely, <i>to see me</i> [GROTIUS];
	or, in general, <i>towards me, to please me.</i>
</p>
<p><b>mourning</b>—over your own
	remissness in not having immediately punished the sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:13- :">2 Corinthians 7:13- :</span>, c.) which called forth my rebuke. 
	</p>
<p><b>fervent mind</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"zeal" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:17">John 2:17</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>toward me</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"for me"; for my sake. They <i>in Paul's behalf</i> showed
	the zeal against the sin which Paul would have shown had he been
	present.
