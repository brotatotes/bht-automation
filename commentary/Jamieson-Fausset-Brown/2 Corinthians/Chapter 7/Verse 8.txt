<p><b>8. with a letter</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in the letter" namely, the first Epistle to the
	Corinthians. 
	</p>
<p><b>I do not repent, though I did
	repent</b>—Translate, "I do not <i>regret</i> it, though I did
	<i>regret</i> it." The <i>Greek</i> words for <i>regret</i> and
	<i>repent</i> are distinct. Paul was almost regretting, through
	parental tenderness, his having used rebukes calculated to grieve the
	Corinthians; but now that he has learned from Titus the salutary
	effect produced on them, he no longer regrets it. 
	</p>
<p><b>for I perceive,</b> &amp;c.—This
	is explanatory of "I did repent" or "regret it,"
	and is parenthetical ("for I perceive <i>that</i> that Epistle
	did make you sorry, though it was but for a season").</p>
