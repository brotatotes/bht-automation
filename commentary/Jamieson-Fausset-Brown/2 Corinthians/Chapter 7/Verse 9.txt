<p><b>9. Now I rejoice</b>—Whereas "I
	did repent" or regret having made you sorry by my letter, I
	rejoice NOW, not that ye
	were caused sorrow, but that your sorrow resulted in your repentance.
	</p>
<p><b>ye sorrowed</b>—rather, as
	before, "ye were made sorry." 
	</p>
<p><b>after a godly
	manner</b>—literally, "according to God," that is, your
	sorrow having regard to God, and rendering your mind conformable to
	God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:22">Romans 14:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:6">1 Peter 4:6</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>that</b>—Translate in <i>Greek</i>
	order, "<i>to the end that</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:6- :">1 Peter 4:6- :</span>) ye might in nothing receive damage from us," which ye
	would have received, had your sorrow been other than that "after
	a godly manner" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:10">2 Corinthians 7:10</span>).</p>
