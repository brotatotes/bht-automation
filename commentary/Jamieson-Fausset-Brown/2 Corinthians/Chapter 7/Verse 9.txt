9. Now I rejoice—Whereas "I
	did repent" or regret having made you sorry by my letter, I
	rejoice NOW, not that ye
	were caused sorrow, but that your sorrow resulted in your repentance.
	ye sorrowed—rather, as
	before, "ye were made sorry." 
	after a godly
	manner—literally, "according to God," that is, your
	sorrow having regard to God, and rendering your mind conformable to
	God (Romans 14:22; 1 Peter 4:6).
	that—Translate in Greek
	order, "to the end that (compare 1 Peter 4:6- :) ye might in nothing receive damage from us," which ye
	would have received, had your sorrow been other than that "after
	a godly manner" (2 Corinthians 7:10).
