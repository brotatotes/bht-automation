<p><b>the grace of God bestowed on
	the churches of Macedonia</b>—Their liberality was not of
	themselves naturally, but of God's grace bestowed on them, and
	enabling them to be the instrument of God's "grace" to
	others (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>).
	The importance given in this Epistle to the collection, arose as well
	from Paul's engagement (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:10">Galatians 2:10</span>),
	as also chiefly from his hope to conciliate the Judaizing Christians
	at Jerusalem to himself and the Gentile believers, by such an act of
	love on the part of the latter towards their Jewish brethren.</p>
