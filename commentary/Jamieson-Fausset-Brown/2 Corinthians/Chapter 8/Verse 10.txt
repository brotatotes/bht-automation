10. advice—Herein he does not
	(as some misinterpret the passage) disclaim inspiration for the
	advice he gives; but under the Spirit, states that it is his
	"opinion" [ALFORD]
	or "judgment" [ELLICOTT,
	and others], not a command, that so their offering might be
	free and spontaneous. 
	this—my giving you an
	advice, not a command. 
	who have begun before—"seeing
	that ye have begun before" the Macedonian
	churches; "a year ago" should be connected with this
	clause. 
	not only to do, but also to
	be forward—There were three steps: (1) the forwardness,
	more literally, "the will"; (2) the setting about
	it, literally, "doing it"; (3) completion of it
	[ALFORD]. In the two
	former, not only the act, but the intention, the
	Corinthians preceded the Macedonians. BENGEL
	explains, "Not only to do" FOR
	THE PAST YEAR, "but also to be forward" or willing
	FOR THIS YEAR. ELLICOTT
	translates, "already," instead of "before": "Ye
	began already a year ago, not only to do, but also to be forward."
	It appears hence, that something had been done in the matter a year
	before; other texts, however, show the collection was not yet paid
	(compare 2 Corinthians 8:11; 2 Corinthians 9:5;
	2 Corinthians 9:7). This agrees with one,
	and only one supposition, namely, that every man had laid by in store
	the fund from which he was afterwards to contribute, the very case
	which is shown by 1 Corinthians 16:2 to
	have existed [PALEY, Horæ
	Paulinæ].
