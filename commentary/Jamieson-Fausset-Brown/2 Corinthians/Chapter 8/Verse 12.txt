	"According to whatsoever it have"; the <i>willing mind,</i>
	or "readiness" to will, is personified [ALFORD].
	Or better, as BENGEL, "<i>He
	is</i> accepted according to whatsoever he have"; so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:11- :">2 Corinthians 8:11- :</span>, The Lord loveth a cheerful <i>giver.</i>" Compare as to
	David, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:18">1 Kings 8:18</span>. God accepts
	the will for the deed. He judges not according to what a man has the
	opportunity to do, but according to what he would do if he had the
	opportunity (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span>;
	and the widow's mite, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:3">Luke 21:3</span>;
