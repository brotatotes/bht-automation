<p><b>14. by an equality</b>—"by
	the rule of equality" [ALFORD]:
	literally, "Out of equality."

<p><b>now at this time</b>—<i>Greek,</i>

<p><b>that their abundance also</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> being distinct from the previous "that,"
	translate, "in order that," namely, <i>at another season,</i>
	when your relative circumstances may be reversed. The reference is
	solely to <i>temporal</i> wants and supplies. Those, as BENGEL,
	who quote <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:27">Romans 15:27</span> for
	interpreting it of spiritual supplies from the Jews to the Gentiles,
	forget that <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:27">Romans 15:27</span> refers to
	the <i>past</i> benefit spiritually, which the Jews have conferred on
	the Gentiles, as a motive to <i>gratitude</i> on the part of the
	latter, not to a <i>prospective</i> benefit to be looked for from the
	former, which the text refers to.</p>
