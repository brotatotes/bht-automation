14. by an equality—"by
	the rule of equality" [ALFORD]:
	literally, "Out of equality." 
	now at this time—Greek,
	"at the present juncture" or season. 
	that their abundance also—The
	Greek being distinct from the previous "that,"
	translate, "in order that," namely, at another season,
	when your relative circumstances may be reversed. The reference is
	solely to temporal wants and supplies. Those, as BENGEL,
	who quote Romans 15:27 for
	interpreting it of spiritual supplies from the Jews to the Gentiles,
	forget that Romans 15:27 refers to
	the past benefit spiritually, which the Jews have conferred on
	the Gentiles, as a motive to gratitude on the part of the
	latter, not to a prospective benefit to be looked for from the
	former, which the text refers to.
