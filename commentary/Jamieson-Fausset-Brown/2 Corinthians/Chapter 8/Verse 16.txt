	"Which put the same earnest care for you into the heart of
	Titus," as was in myself. My care for you led me to "<i>desire</i>"

	"<i>exhortation,</i>" the same <i>Greek</i>); but Titus had
	of himself the same care, whence he "accepted (gladly) my
	exhortation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:17">2 Corinthians 8:17</span>) to
	go to you (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>).</p>
