<p><b>18. the brother, whose praise is in
	the gospel</b>â€”whose praise is known in connection with the Gospel:
	<i>Luke</i> may be meant; not that "the Gospel" here refers
	to his <i>written</i> Gospel; but the language implies some one well
	known throughout the churches, and at that time with Paul, as Luke
	then was (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6">Acts 20:6</span>). Not a
	Macedonian, as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:4">2 Corinthians 9:4</span>.
	Of all Paul's "companions in travel" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:19">2 Corinthians 8:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>), Luke was the most
	prominent, having been his companion in preaching the Gospel at his
	first entrance into Europe (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29- :">Acts 19:29- :</span>). The fact that the person here referred to was "chosen
	of the churches" as their trustee to travel with Paul in
	conveying the contribution to Jerusalem, implies that he had resided
	among them some time before: this is true of Luke, who after parting
	from Paul at Philippi (as he marks by the change from "we"
	to "they," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:11">Acts 16:11</span>)
	six years before, is now again found in his company in Macedonia. In
	the interim he had probably become so well known that "his
	praise was throughout all the churches." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:18">2 Corinthians 12:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span>. He who is faithful in
	the Gospel will be faithful also in matters of inferior importance
	[BENGEL].</p>
