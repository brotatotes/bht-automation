	This and the previous clause, "to the glory of the same Lord,"
	do not follow "administered by us," but "chosen of the
	churches to travel," &amp;c. The union of the brother with Paul
	in this affair of the collection was done to guard against suspicions
	injurious "to the glory" of the Lord. It was also done in
	order to produce a "readiness" on the part of Paul and the
	brother to undertake the office which each, by himself, would have
	been less ready to undertake, for fear of suspicions arising (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23- :">2 Corinthians 8:23- :</span>) as to their appropriation of any of the money.</p>
