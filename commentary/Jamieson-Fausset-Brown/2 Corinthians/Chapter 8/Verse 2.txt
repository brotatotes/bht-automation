2. trial of affliction—The
	Greek expresses, "in affliction (or, 'tribulation') which
	tested them"; literally, "in a great testing of
	affliction." 
	abundance of their joy—The
	greater was the depth of their poverty, the greater was the abundance
	of their joy. A delightful contrast in terms, and triumph, in fact,
	of spirit over flesh. 
	their deep poverty—Greek,
	"their poverty down to the death of it." 
	abounded unto the riches of
	their liberality—another beautiful contrast in terms: their
	poverty had the effect, not of producing stinted gifts, but of
	"abounding in the riches of liberality" (not as
	Margin, "simplicity"; though the idea of singleness
	of motive to God's glory and man's good, probably enters into the
	idea); (compare Romans 12:8, and
	Margin; 2 Corinthians 9:11,
	Margin; see on 2 Corinthians 9:13;
	James 1:5).
