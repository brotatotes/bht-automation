<p><b>23. fellow helper concerning
	you</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "fellow worker towards you." 
	</p>
<p><b>our brethren</b>—the two
	mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:18">2 Corinthians 8:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:22">2 Corinthians 8:22</span>.
	</p>
<p><b>messengers</b>—rather, as
	the <i>Greek,</i> "apostles": in the less strict sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:22- :">2 Corinthians 8:22- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of the churches</b>—sent by
	the churches, as we are by the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:22- :">2 Corinthians 8:22- :</span>). There was in the synagogue an ecclesiastical officer,
	called "the angel of the Church," whence the title seems
	derived (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:1">Revelation 2:1</span>).</p>
