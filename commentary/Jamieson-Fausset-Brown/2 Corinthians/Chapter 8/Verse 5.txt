<p><b>5. And </b><i><b>this they did,</b></i><b>
	not as we hoped</b>—Translate, "And not as we hoped (that is,
	far beyond our hopes), but their own selves gave they first to the
	Lord." "First," not indicating priority of time, but
	first of all, <i>above all in importance.</i> The giving of
	themselves takes precedency of their other gifts, as being the motive
	which led them to the latter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>by the will of God</b>—not
	"<i>according</i> to the will of God," but "<i>moved
	by</i> the will of God, who made them willing" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). It is therefore called (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "the grace of God."</p>
