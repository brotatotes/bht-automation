<p><b>6. Insomuch that</b>—As we saw the
	Macedonians' alacrity in giving, we could not but exhort Titus, that
	as we collected in Macedonia, so he in Corinth should complete the
	work of collecting which he had already begun there, lest ye, the
	wealthy people of Corinth, should be outdone in liberality by the
	poor Macedonians. 
	</p>
<p><b>as he had begun</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>previously</i> begun," namely, the collection at
	Corinth, <i>before</i> the Macedonians began to contribute, during
	the visit to Corinth from which he had just returned. 
	</p>
<p><b>finish in you the same
	grace</b>—complete among you this act of grace or beneficence on
	your part. 
	</p>
<p><b>also</b>—as well as other
	things which he had to do among them [ALFORD].</p>
