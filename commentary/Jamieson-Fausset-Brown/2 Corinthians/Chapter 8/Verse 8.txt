<p><b>8. not by commandment</b>—"not
	by way of commandment."

<p><b>but by occasion of the
	forwardness of others, and</b> &amp;c.—rather, "But by
	(mention of) the forwardness of others (as an inducement to you), and
	to prove (literally, 'proving') the sincerity of your love." The
	<i>Greek</i> is "<i>by means of,</i>" not "<i>on
	account of</i> the forwardness," &amp;c. BENGEL,
	ELLICOTT, and others
	translate, "<i>By means of</i> the forwardness of others,
	proving the sincerity of your love ALSO."
	The former is the simpler construction in the <i>Greek.</i></p>
