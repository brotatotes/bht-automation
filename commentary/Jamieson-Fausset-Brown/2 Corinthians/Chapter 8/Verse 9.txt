<p><b>9. ye know the grace</b>—the act
	of gratuitous love whereby the Lord emptied Himself of His previous
	heavenly glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:6">Philippians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:7">Philippians 2:7</span>)
	for your sakes. 
	</p>
<p><b>became poor</b>—Yet this is
	not demanded of you (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:14">2 Corinthians 8:14</span>);
	but merely that, without impoverishing yourselves, you should relieve
	others with your abundance. If the Lord did so much more, and at so
	much heavier a cost, for your sakes; much more may you do an act of
	love to your brethren at so little a sacrifice of self.

<p><b>might be rich</b>—in the
	heavenly glory which constitutes His riches, and all other things, so
	far as is really good for us (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21">1 Corinthians 3:21</span>;
