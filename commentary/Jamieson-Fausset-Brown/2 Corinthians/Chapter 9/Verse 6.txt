6. I say
—ELLICOTT and others
	supply the ellipsis thus: "But remember this." 
	bountifully—literally,
	"with," or "in blessings." The word
	itself implies a beneficent spirit in the giver (compare  :-, end), and the plural implies the abundance and
	liberality of the gifts. "The reaping shall correspond to the
	proportions and spirit of the sowing" [BENGEL].
	Compare Ezekiel 34:26, "Showers
	of blessing."
