<p><b>9. As it is written</b>—realizing
	the highly blessed character portrayed in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>He</b>—the "good man"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:5">Psalms 112:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>dispersed</b>—as seed sown
	with full and open hand, without anxious thought in what direction
	each grain may fall. It is implied also that he <i>has</i> always
	what he may disperse [BENGEL].
	So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:9">Psalms 112:9</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>the poor</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	word is found here only in New Testament, "one in straitened
	circumstances, who earns his bread by labor." The word usually
	employed means "one so poor as to live by begging." 
	</p>
<p><b>his righteousness</b>—Here
	"beneficence": the evidence of his being <i>righteous</i>
	before God and man. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+24:13">Deuteronomy 24:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:1">Matthew 6:1</span>, "alms"; <i>Greek,</i>
	"righteousness." 
	</p>
<p><b>remaineth</b>—unexhausted
	and unfailing.</p>
