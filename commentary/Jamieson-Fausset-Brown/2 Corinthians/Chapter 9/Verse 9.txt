9. As it is written—realizing
	the highly blessed character portrayed in  :-. 
	He—the "good man"
	(Psalms 112:5). 
	dispersed—as seed sown
	with full and open hand, without anxious thought in what direction
	each grain may fall. It is implied also that he has always
	what he may disperse [BENGEL].
	So in Psalms 112:9. 
	the poor—The Greek
	word is found here only in New Testament, "one in straitened
	circumstances, who earns his bread by labor." The word usually
	employed means "one so poor as to live by begging." 
	his righteousness—Here
	"beneficence": the evidence of his being righteous
	before God and man. Compare Deuteronomy 24:13;
	Matthew 6:1, "alms"; Greek,
	"righteousness." 
	remaineth—unexhausted
	and unfailing.
