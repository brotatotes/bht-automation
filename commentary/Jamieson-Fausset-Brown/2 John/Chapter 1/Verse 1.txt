<p style=" "><b>The
	elder</b>
	— In a familiar letter John gives himself a less authoritative
	designation than “apostle”; so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>lady</b>
	— Bengel takes the <i>Greek</i>
	as a proper name Kyria, answering to the <i>Hebrew</i>
	“Martha.” Being a person of influence, “deceivers” (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>)
	were insinuating themselves into her family to seduce her and her
	children from the faith [Tirinus], whence John felt it necessary to
	write a warning to her. (But see my Introduction and see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	A particular <i>Church,</i>
	probably that at Babylon, was intended. “Church” is derived from
	<i>Greek</i>
	“Kuriake,” akin to Kuria, or Kyria here; the latter word among
	the Romans and Athenians means the same as ecclesia, the term
	appropriated to designate the <i>Church
	assembly.</i></p>
<p style=" "><b>love
	in the truth</b>
	— Christian <i>love</i>
	rests on the Christian <i>truth</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	end). Not merely “I love <i>in
	truth,</i>”
	but “I love in THE truth.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>all</b>
	— All Christians form one fellowship, rejoicing in the spiritual
	prosperity of one another. “The communion of love is as wide as the
	communion of faith” [Alford].</p>
