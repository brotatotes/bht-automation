<p style=" "><b>If
	there come any</b>
	— as a teacher or brother. The <i>Greek</i>
	is indicative, not subjunctive; implying that such persons <i>do
	actually come,</i>
	and <i>are
	sure to come;</i>
	when any comes, as there will. True love is combined with hearty
	renunciation and separation from all that is false, whether persons
	or doctrines.</p>
<p style=" "><b>receive
	him not ... neither bid him God speed</b>
	— This is not said of those who were always aliens from the Church,
	but of those who wish to be esteemed brethren, and subvert the true
	doctrine [Grotius]. The greeting salutation forbidden in the case of
	such a one is that <i>usual
	among Christian brethren</i>
	in those days, not a mere formality, but a token of <i>Christian
	brotherhood.</i></p>
