<p style=" ">By
	wishing a false brother or teacher “God (or ‘<i>good</i>’)
	speed,” you imply that he is capable as such of good speed and <i>joy</i>
	(the literal meaning of the <i>Greek</i>),
	and that you wish him it while opposing Christ; so you identify
	yourself with “his evil deeds.” The <i>Greek</i>
	of “partaker” is “having communion with.” We cannot have
	communion with saints and with Antichrist at the same time. Here we
	see John’s naturally fiery zeal directed to a right end. Polycarp,
	the disciple of John, told contemporaries of Irenaeus, who narrates
	the story on their authority, that on one occasion when John was
	about to bathe, and heard that Cerinthus, the heretic, was within, he
	retired with abhorrence, exclaiming, Surely the house will fall in
	ruins since the enemy of the truth is there.</p>
