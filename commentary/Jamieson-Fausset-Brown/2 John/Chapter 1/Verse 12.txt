<p style=" "><b>I
	would not write</b>
	— A heart full of love pours itself out more freely face to face,
	than by letter.</p>
<p style=" "><b>paper</b>
	— made of Egyptian papyrus. Pens were then reeds split.</p>
<p style=" "><b>ink</b>
	— made of soot and water, thickened with gum. Parchment was used
	for the permanent manuscripts in which the Epistles were preserved.
	Writing <i>tablets</i>
	were used merely for temporary purposes, as our slates.</p>
<p style=" "><b>face
	to face</b>
	— literally, “mouth to mouth.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>full</b>
	— <i>Greek,</i>
	“filled full.” Your joy will be complete in hearing from me in
	person the joyful Gospel truths which I now defer communicating till
	I see you. On other occasions his writing the glad truths was for the
	same purpose.</p>
