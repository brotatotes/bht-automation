<p style=" "><b>Grace
	be with you</b>
	— One of the oldest manuscripts and several versions have “us”
	for <i>you.</i>
	The <i>Greek</i>
	is literally, “Grace <i>shall
	be</i>
	with us,” that is, with both <i>you
	and me.</i>
	A prayer, however, is implied besides a confident affirmation.</p>
<p style=" "><b>grace
	... mercy ... peace</b>
	— “<i>Grace</i>”
	covers the sins of men; “mercy,” their miseries. <i>Grace</i>
	must first do away with man’s guilt before his misery can be
	relieved by <i>mercy.</i>
	Therefore <i>grace</i>
	stands before <i>mercy.
	Peace</i>
	is the result of both, and therefore stands third in order. Casting
	all our care on the Lord, with thanksgiving, maintains this peace.</p>
<p style=" "><b>the
	Lord</b> —
	The oldest manuscripts and most of the oldest versions omit “the
	Lord.” John never elsewhere uses this title in his Epistles, but
	“the Son of God.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>in
	truth and love</b>
	— The element or sphere in which alone <i>grace,
	mercy,</i>
	and <i>peace,</i>
	have place. He mentions <i>truth</i>
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;
	<i>love,</i>
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.
	Paul uses FAITH and <i>love;</i>
	for <i>faith</i>
	and <i>truth</i>
	are close akin.</p>
