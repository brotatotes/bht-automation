<p style=" "><b>I
	beseech</b>
	— rather (compare <i>Note,</i>

	“I request thee,” implying some degree of <i>authority.</i></p>
<p style=" "><b>not

	— It was <i>old</i>
	in that Christians heard it from the first in the Gospel preaching;
	<i>new,</i>
	in that the Gospel rested love on the new principle of filial
	imitation of God who first loved us, and gave Jesus to die for <i>us;</i>
	and also, in that <i>love</i>
	is now set forth with greater clearness than in the Old Testament
	dispensation. Love performs both tables of the law, and is the end of
	the law and the Gospel alike (compare <i>Notes,</i>
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
<p style=" "><b>that
	we</b> —
	implying that he already had love, and urging her to join him in the
	same Christian grace. This verse seems to me to decide that a <i>Church,</i>
	not an <i>individual
	lady,</i>
	is meant. For a man to urge a woman (“THEE”; not <i>thee
	and thy children</i>)
	that he and she should <i>love
	one another,</i>
	is hardly like an apostolic precept, however pure may be the love
	enjoined; but all is clear if “the lady” represent a <i>Church.</i></p>
