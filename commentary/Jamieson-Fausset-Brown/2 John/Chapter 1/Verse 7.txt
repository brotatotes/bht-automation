	“coming.” He who denies Christ’s <i>coming</i>

	denies its <i>actuality.</i>
	They denied the possibility of a Messiah’s appearing, or <i>coming,</i>
	in the flesh [Neander]. I think the <i>Greek</i>
	present participle implies <i>both</i>
	the first and the second advent of Christ. He is often elsewhere
	called <i>the
	Coming One</i>
	(<i>Greek</i>),

	The denial of the reality of His manifestation in the flesh, at His
	first coming, and of His personal advent again, constitutes
	Antichrist. “The world <i>turns
	away</i>
	from God and Christ, busily intent upon its own husks; but to OPPOSE
	God and Christ is of the leaven of Satan” [Bengel].</p>
<p style=" "><b>This

	— <i>Greek,</i>
	“This (such a one as has been just described) is <i>the</i>
	deceiver and <i>the</i>
	Antichrist.” The <i>many</i>
	who in a degree fulfil the character, are forerunners of the final
	personal Antichrist, who shall concentrate in himself all the
	features of previous Antichristian systems.</p>
