<p style=" "><b>Look
	to yourselves</b>
	— amidst the widespread prevalence of deception so many being led
	astray. So Christ’s warning, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>we
	lose not ... we receive</b>
	— The oldest manuscripts and versions read, “That YE lose not,
	but that YE receive.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>which
	we have wrought</b>
	— So one oldest manuscript reads. Other very old manuscripts,
	versions, and Fathers, read, “which YE have wrought.” The <i>we</i>
	being seemingly the more difficult reading is less likely to have
	been a transcriber’s alteration. Look that ye lose not the
	believing state of “truth and love,” which WE (as God’s
	workmen, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>)
	were the instruments of working in you.</p>
<p style=" "><b>a
	full reward</b>
	— of grace not of debt. <i>Fully</i>
	consummated glory. If “which YE have wrought” be read with very
	old authorities, the reward meant is that of their “work (of faith)
	and labor of love.” There are degrees of heavenly reward
	proportioned to the degrees of capability of receiving heavenly
	blessedness. Each vessel of glory hanging on Jesus shall be fully
	happy. But the larger the vessel, the greater will be its capacity
	for receiving heavenly bliss. He who with one pound made ten,
	received authority over ten cities. He who made five pounds received
	five cities; each according to his capacity of rule, and in
	proportion to his faithfulness. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.
	“There is no half reward of the saints. It is either lost
	altogether, or received <i>in
	full;</i>
	in <i>full</i>
	communion with God” [Bengel]. Still no service of minister or
	people shall fail to receive its reward.</p>
