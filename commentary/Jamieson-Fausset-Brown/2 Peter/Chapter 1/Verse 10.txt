	in your virtue knowledge,</i> c. God must work all these graces in
	us, yet not so that we should be mere <i>machines,</i> but <i>willing
	instruments</i> in His hands in making His election of us "secure."
	The <i>ensuring</i> of our <i>election</i> is spoken of not in
	respect to God, whose counsel is steadfast and everlasting, but in
	respect to <i>our part.</i> There is no uncertainty on His part, but
	on ours the only security is our <i>faith</i> in His promise and the
	fruits of the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5-7">2 Peter 1:5-7</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:11">2 Peter 1:11</span>). Peter subjoins
	<i>election</i> to <i>calling,</i> because the <i>calling</i> is the
	effect and proof of God's <i>election,</i> which goes before and is
	the main thing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:30">Romans 8:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33">Romans 8:33</span>, where God's "<i>elect</i>"
	are those "<i>predestinated,</i>" and election is "His
	<i>purpose,</i>" <i>according to</i> which He "called"
	them). We know His <i>calling</i> before His <i>election,</i> thereby
	<i>calling</i> is put first.
