<p><b>11. an entrance</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>the</i> entrance" which ye look for. 
	</p>
<p><b>ministered</b>—the same
	verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>. <i>Minister</i>
	in your faith virtue and the other graces, so shall there be
	<i>ministered to you</i> the entrance into that heaven where these
	graces shine most brightly. The reward of grace hereafter shall
	correspond to the work of grace here. 
	</p>
<p><b>abundantly</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"richly." It answers to "abound," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5- :">2 Peter 1:5- :</span>. If these graces <i>abound</i> in you, you shall have your
	entrance into heaven not merely "scarcely" (as he had said,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:18">1 Peter 4:18</span>), nor "so as by
	fire," like one escaping with life after having lost all his
	goods, but in triumph without "stumbling and falling."</p>
