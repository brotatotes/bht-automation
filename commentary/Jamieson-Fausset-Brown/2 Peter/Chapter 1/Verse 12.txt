<p><b>12. Wherefore</b>—as these graces
	are so necessary to your abundant entrance into Christ's kingdom
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:10">2 Peter 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:11">2 Peter 1:11</span>).

<p><b>I will not be negligent</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "<i>I will be about</i> always to put
	you in remembrance" (an accumulated future: I will regard you as
	always needing to be reminded): compare "I will endeavor,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:15">2 Peter 1:15</span>. "I will be sure
	always to remind you" [ALFORD].
	"Always"; implying the reason why he writes the second
	Epistle so soon after the first. He feels <i>there is likely</i> to
	be more and more need of admonition on account of the increasing
	corruption (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:1">2 Peter 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:2">2 Peter 2:2</span>).

<p><b>in the present truth</b>—<i>the
	Gospel truth now present with you:</i> formerly promised to Old
	Testament believers as <i>about to be, now</i> in the New Testament
	<i>actually present</i> with, and in, believers, so that they are
	"established" in it as a "present" reality. Its
	importance renders frequent monitions never superfluous: compare
	Paul's similar apology, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:14">Romans 15:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:15">Romans 15:15</span>.</p>
