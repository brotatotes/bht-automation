<p><b>14. shortly I must put off</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"the putting off (as a garment) of my tabernacle is speedy":
	implying a <i>soon approaching,</i> and also a <i>sudden</i> death
	(as a violent death is). Christ's words, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:18">John 21:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:19">John 21:19</span>, "When thou art
	old," &amp;c., were the ground of his "knowing," now
	that he was old, that his foretold martyrdom was near. Compare as to
	Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6">2 Timothy 4:6</span>. Though a violent
	death, he calls it a "departure" (<i>Greek</i> for
	"decease," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:15">2 Peter 1:15</span>),
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:60">Acts 7:60</span>.</p>
