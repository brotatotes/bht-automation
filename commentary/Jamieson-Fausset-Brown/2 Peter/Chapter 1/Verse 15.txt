<p><b>15. endeavour</b>—"use my
	diligence": the same <i>Greek</i> word as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>: this is the field in which my <i>diligence</i> has scope.
	Peter thus fulfils Christ's charge, "Feed My sheep"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:16">John 21:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:17">John 21:17</span>).

<p><b>decease</b>—"departure."
	The very word ("exodus") used in the Transfiguration, Moses
	and Elias conversing about Christ's <i>decease</i> (<i>found nowhere
	else in the New Testament,</i> but <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:17- :">John 21:17- :</span>, "the <i>departing</i> of Israel" out of Egypt,
	to which the saints' deliverance from the present bondage of
	corruption answers). "Tabernacle" is another term found
	here as well as there (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:31">Luke 9:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:33">Luke 9:33</span>): an undesigned
	coincidence confirming Peter's authorship of this Epistle.

<p><b>that ye may be able</b>—by
	the help of this written Epistle; and perhaps also of Mark's Gospel,
	which Peter superintended.

<p><b>always</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"on each occasion": as often as occasion may require. 
	</p>
<p><b>to have . . . in
	remembrance</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "to exercise remembrance of."
	Not merely "to remember," as sometimes we do, things we
	care not about; but "have them in (earnest) remembrance,"
	as momentous and precious truths.</p>
