16. For—reason why he is so
	earnest that the remembrance of these things should be continued
	after his death. 
	followed—out in detail.
	cunningly devised—Greek,
	"devised by (man's) wisdom"; as distinguished
	from what the Holy Ghost teaches (compare  :-). But compare also 2 Peter 2:3,
	"feigned words." 
	fables—as the heathen
	mythologies, and the subsequent Gnostic "fables and
	genealogies," of which the germs already existed in the junction
	of Judaism with Oriental philosophy in Asia Minor. A precautionary
	protest of the Spirit against the rationalistic theory of the Gospel
	history being myth.
when we made known unto
	you—not that Peter himself had personally taught the
	churches in Pontus, Galatia, c., but he was one of the apostles whose
	testimony was borne to them, and to the Church in general, to
	whom this Epistle is addressed (2 Peter 2:3- :, including, but not restricted, as First Peter,
	to the churches in Pontus, &c.). 
	power—the opposite of
	"fables" compare the contrast of "word" and
	"power," 1 Corinthians 4:20. A
	specimen of His power was given at the Transfiguration also of
	His "coming" again, and its attendant glory. The
	Greek for "coming" is always used of His second
	advent. A refutation of the scoffers (1 Corinthians 4:20- :): I, James and John, saw with our own eyes a mysterious
	sample of His coming glory. 
	were—Greek,
	"were made." 
	eye-witnesses—As
	initiated spectators of mysteries (so the Greek), we were
	admitted into His innermost secrets, namely, at the Transfiguration. 
	his—emphatical (compare
	Greek): "THAT
	great ONE'S majesty."
