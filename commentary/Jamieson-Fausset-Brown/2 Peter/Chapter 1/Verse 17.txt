17. received . . . honour—in
	the voice that spake to Him. 
	glory—in the light
	which shone around Him. 
	came—Greek, "was
	borne": the same phrase occurs only in  :-; one of several instances showing that the argument against
	the authenticity of this Second Epistle, from its dissimilarity of
	style as compared with First Peter, is not well founded. 
	such a voice—as he
	proceeds to describe. 
	from the excellent
	glory—rather as Greek, "by (that is, uttered by)
	the magnificent glory (that is, by God: as His glorious
	manifested presence is often called by the Hebrews "the Glory,"
	compare "His Excellency," Deuteronomy 33:26;
	Psalms 21:5)." 
	in whom—Greek,
	"in regard to whom" (accusative case); but Psalms 21:5- :, "in whom" (dative case) centers and rests My good
	pleasure. Peter also omits, as not required by his purpose, "hear
	Him," showing his independence in his inspired testimony. 
	I am—Greek
	aorist, past time, "My good pleasure rested from
	eternity."
