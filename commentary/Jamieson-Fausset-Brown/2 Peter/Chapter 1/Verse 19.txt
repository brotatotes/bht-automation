<p><b>19. We</b>—all believers. 
	</p>
<p><b>a more sure</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "we have <i>the</i> word of prophecy more sure
	(confirmed)." Previously we knew its <i>sureness</i> by faith,
	but, through that visible specimen of its hereafter entire
	fulfilment, assurance is made <i>doubly sure.</i> Prophecy assures us
	that Christ's <i>sufferings,</i> now past, are to be followed by
	Christ's <i>glory,</i> still future: the Transfiguration gives us a
	pledge to make our faith still stronger, that "the day" of
	His glory will "dawn" ere long. He does not mean to say
	that "the word of prophecy," or Scripture, is surer than
	<i>the voice of God</i> heard at the Transfiguration, as <i>English
	Version;</i> for this is plainly not the fact. The fulfilment of
	<i>prophecy</i> so far in Christ's history makes us the <i>surer</i>
	of what is yet to be fulfilled, His consummated glory. The word was
	the "lamp (<i>Greek</i> for 'light') heeded" by Old
	Testament believers, until a gleam of the "day dawn" was
	given at Christ's first coming, and especially in His
	Transfiguration. So the word is <i>a lamp</i> to us still, until "the
	day" burst forth fully at the second coming of "the Sun of
	righteousness." <i>The day,</i> when it dawns upon you, makes
	<i>sure</i> the fact that you saw correctly, though indistinctly, the
	objects revealed by <i>the lamp.</i>
</p>
<p><b>whereunto</b>—to which word
	of prophecy, primarily the Old Testament in Peter's <i>day;</i> but
	now also in our day the New Testament, which, though brighter than
	the Old Testament (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span>,
	end), is but a <i>lamp</i> even still as compared with the brightness
	of the eternal day (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8- :">1 John 2:8- :</span>). Oral teachings and traditions of ministers are to be tested
	by the written word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:11">Acts 17:11</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>dark</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	implies <i>squalid,</i> having neither water nor light: such
	spiritually is the world without, and the smaller world (microcosm)
	within, the heart in its natural state. Compare the "<i>dry</i>
	places" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:24">Luke 11:24</span> (namely,
	unwatered by the Spirit), through which the unclean spirit goeth. 
	</p>
<p><b>dawn</b>—bursting <i>through</i>
	the darkness. 
	</p>
<p><b>day star</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	the morning star," as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:24- :">Luke 11:24- :</span>. The Lord Jesus. 
	</p>
<p><b>in your hearts</b>—Christ's
	<i>arising in the heart</i> by His Spirit giving full assurance,
	creates spiritually full day in the heart, the means to which is
	prayerfully <i>giving heed to the word.</i> This is associated with
	the coming of <i>the day of the Lord,</i> as being the earnest of it.
	Indeed, even our <i>hearts</i> shall not <i>fully</i> realize Christ
	in all His unspeakable glory and felt presence, until He shall come
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:14">Isaiah 66:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:15">Isaiah 66:15</span>, "When you see
	this, your <i>heart</i> shall rejoice . . . For, behold, the Lord
	will come." However, TREGELLES'
	punctuation is best, "whereunto ye do well to take heed (as unto
	a light shining in a dark place, until the day have dawned and the
	morning star arisen) in your hearts." For the day has already
	dawned in the heart of believers; what they wait for is its visible
	manifestation at Christ's coming.</p>
