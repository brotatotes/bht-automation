	marking how entirely <i>one</i> the Father and Son are (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1- :">2 Peter 1:1- :</span>). The <i>Vulgate</i> omits "of God and"; but
	oldest manuscripts support the words. Still the prominent object of
	Peter's exhortation is "the knowledge <i>of Jesus our Lord</i>"
	(a phrase only in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:24">Romans 4:24</span>),
	and, only secondarily, of the Father through Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:8">2 Peter 1:8</span>;
