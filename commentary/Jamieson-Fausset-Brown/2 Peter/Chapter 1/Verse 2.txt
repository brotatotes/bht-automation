2. Grace . . . peace— ( :-). 
	through—Greek,
	"in": the sphere IN
	which alone grace and peace can be multiplied. 
	knowledge—Greek,
	"full knowledge." 
	of God, and of Jesus our
	Lord—The Father is here meant by "God," but
	the Son in 2 Peter 1:1:
	marking how entirely one the Father and Son are (2 Peter 1:1- :). The Vulgate omits "of God and"; but
	oldest manuscripts support the words. Still the prominent object of
	Peter's exhortation is "the knowledge of Jesus our Lord"
	(a phrase only in Romans 4:24),
	and, only secondarily, of the Father through Him (2 Peter 1:8;
	2 Peter 2:20; 2 Peter 3:18).
