<p><b>first</b>—the <i>foremost</i>
	consideration in studying the word of prophecy. Laying it down as a
	<i>first principle</i> never to be lost sight of. 
	</p>
<p><b>is</b>—<i>Greek,</i> not
	the simple verb, <i>to be,</i> but <i>to begin to be,</i> "proves
	to be," "becometh." No prophecy is found to be the
	result of "private (the mere individual writer's uninspired)
	<i>interpretation</i>" (<i>solution</i>), and so <i>origination.</i>
	The <i>Greek</i> noun <i>epilusis,</i> does not mean in itself
	<i>origination;</i> but that which the sacred writer could not always
	fully <i>interpret,</i> though being the speaker or writer (as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18- :">1 Peter 1:18- :</span> implies), was plainly not of his own, but of God's
	<i>disclosure, origination,</i> and <i>inspiration,</i> as Peter
	proceeds to add, "But holy men . . . spake (and afterwards
	<i>wrote</i>) . . . moved by the Holy Ghost": a reason why ye
	should "give" all "heed" to it. The parallelism
	to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16">2 Peter 1:16</span> shows that "<i>private
	interpretation,</i>" contrasted with "moved by the Holy
	Ghost," here answers to "fables <i>devised by</i> (<i>human</i>)
	<i>wisdom,</i>" contrasted with "we were eye-witnesses of
	<i>His majesty,</i>" as attested by the "voice from God."
	The words of the prophetical (and so of all) Scripture writers were
	not mere words <i>of the individuals,</i> and therefore to be
	<i>interpreted by them,</i> but of "the Holy Ghost" by whom
	they were "moved." "Private" is explained, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:16- :">2 Peter 1:16- :</span>, "by the will of man" (namely, the individual
	writer). In a secondary sense the text teaches also, as the word is
	the <i>Holy Spirit's,</i> it cannot be <i>interpreted</i> by its
	<i>readers</i> (any more than by its <i>writers</i>) by their mere
	<i>private</i> human powers, but by the teaching of <i>the Holy Ghost</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:14">John 16:14</span>). "He who is
	the author of Scripture is its supreme interpreter" [GERHARD].
	ALFORD translates,
	"springs not out of human interpretation," that is, is not
	a prognostication made by a man <i>knowing what he means</i> when he
	utters it, but," &amp;c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:14- :">John 16:14- :</span>). Rightly: except that the verb is rather, <i>doth
	become,</i> or <i>prove to be.</i> It not being of private
	interpretation, you must "<i>give heed</i>" to it, looking
	for the <i>Spirit's</i> illumination "in your hearts"
	(compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:14- :">John 16:14- :</span>).</p>
