<p><b>21. came not in old time</b>—rather,
	"was never at any time borne" (to us).

<p><b>by the will of man</b>—alone.
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:26">Jeremiah 23:26</span>, "prophets of

<p><b>holy</b>—One oldest
	manuscript has, "<i>men</i> FROM
	<i>God</i>": the emissaries from God. "Holy," if read,
	will mean because they had the Holy Spirit.

<p><b>moved</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"borne" (along) as by a mighty wind: <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:26- :">Jeremiah 23:26- :</span>, "<i>rushing</i> (the same <i>Greek</i>) wind":
	rapt out of themselves: still not in fanatical excitement (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:26- :">Jeremiah 23:26- :</span>). The <i>Hebrew</i> "<i>nabi,</i>" "prophet,"
	meant an <i>announcer</i> or interpreter of God: he, as <i>God's
	spokesman, interpreted</i> not his own "private" will or
	thought, but God's "Man <i>of the Spirit</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:26- :">Jeremiah 23:26- :</span>, <i>Margin</i>). "Thou testifiedst by Thy Spirit in Thy
	prophets." "Seer," on the other hand, refers to the
	<i>mode of receiving</i> the communications from God, rather than to
	the <i>utterance</i> of them to others. "Spake" implies
	that, both in its original oral announcement, and now even when in
	writing, it has been always, and is, <i>the living voice</i> of God
	<i>speaking</i> to us through His inspired servants. <i>Greek,</i>
	"borne (along)" forms a beautiful antithesis to "was
	borne." They were passive, rather than active instruments. The
	<i>Old Testament</i> prophets primarily, but including also <i>all</i>
	the inspired penmen, whether of the New or Old Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:26- :">Jeremiah 23:26- :</span>).</p>
