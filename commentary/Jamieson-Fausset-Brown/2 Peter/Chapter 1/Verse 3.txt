<p><b>3. According as,</b> c.—Seeing

	He hath given us ALL
	things (needful) for life and godliness, (so) do you give us ALL
	diligence," &amp;c. The oil and flame are given wholly of grace
	by God, and "taken" by believers: their part henceforth is
	to "trim their lamps" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:3">2 Peter 1:3</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:5">2 Peter 1:5</span>,

<p><b>life and godliness</b>—Spiritual
	<i>life</i> must exist first before there can be true <i>godliness.
	Knowledge of God</i> experimentally is the first step to <i>life</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>). The child must have
	vital breath. first, and then cry to, and walk in the ways of, his
	father. It is not by <i>godliness</i> that we obtain <i>life,</i> but
	by <i>life, godliness.</i> To <i>life</i> stands opposed <i>corruption</i>
	to <i>godliness, lust</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>).

<p><b>to glory and virtue</b>—rather,
	"<i>through</i> (His) glory." Thus <i>English Version</i>
	reads as one oldest manuscript. But other oldest manuscripts and
	<i>Vulgate</i> read, "<i>By His own</i> (peculiar) glory and
	virtue"; being the explanation of "His divine power";
	<i>glory</i> and <i>moral excellency</i> (the same attribute is given
	to God in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>, "praises,"
	literally, "virtues") characterize God's "power."
	"Virtue," the standing word in heathen ethics, is found
	only once in Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:8">Philippians 4:8</span>), and
	in Peter in a distinct sense from its classic usage; it (in the
	heathen sense) is a term too low and earthly for expressing the gifts
	of the Spirit [TRENCH,
	<i>Greek Synonyms of the New Testament</i>].</p>
