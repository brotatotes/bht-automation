	He hath given us ALL

	life must exist first before there can be true godliness.
	Knowledge of God experimentally is the first step to life

	only once in Paul (Philippians 4:8), and
	in Peter in a distinct sense from its classic usage; it (in the
	heathen sense) is a term too low and earthly for expressing the gifts
	of the Spirit [TRENCH,
