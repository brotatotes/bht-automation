<p><b>4. Whereby,</b> c.—By His <i>glory</i>
	and <i>virtue:</i> His <i>glory</i> making the "promises"
	to be <i>exceeding great</i> His <i>virtue</i> making them "precious"
	[BENGEL]. <i>Precious
	promises</i> are the object of <i>precious faith.</i>
</p>
<p><b>given</b>—The <i>promises</i>
	themselves are a <i>gift:</i> for God's <i>promises</i> are as sure
	as if they were fulfilled. 
	</p>
<p><b>by these</b>—<i>promises.</i>
	They are the object of faith, and even now have a sanctifying effect
	on the believer, assimilating him to God. Still more so, when they
	shall be <i>fulfilled.</i>
</p>
<p><b>might,</b> c.—<i>Greek,</i>
	"that ye MAY become
	partakers of the divine nature," even now in part hereafter
	perfectly; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>, "We
	shall be like Him." 
	</p>
<p><b>the divine nature</b>—not
	God's essence, but His <i>holiness,</i> including His "glory"
	and "virtue," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:3">2 Peter 1:3</span>;
	the opposite to "corruption through lust." Sanctification
	is the imparting to us of <i>God Himself</i> by the Holy Spirit in
	the soul. We by faith partake also of the material nature of Jesus
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:30">Ephesians 5:30</span>). The "divine
	<i>power</i>" enables us to be partakers of "the divine
	<i>nature.</i>"

<p><b>escaped the corruption</b>—which
	involves in, and with itself, <i>destruction</i> at last of soul and
	body; on "escaped" as from a condemned cell, compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:18-20">2 Peter 2:18-20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+19:17">Genesis 19:17</span>;

	</p>
<p><b>through</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in." "The corruption in the world" has its seat,
	not so much in the surrounding elements, as in the "lust"
	or concupiscence of men's hearts.</p>
