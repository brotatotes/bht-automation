4. Whereby, c.—By His glory
	and virtue: His glory making the "promises"
	to be exceeding great His virtue making them "precious"
	[BENGEL]. Precious
	promises are the object of precious faith.
given—The promises
	themselves are a gift: for God's promises are as sure
	as if they were fulfilled. 
	by these—promises.
	They are the object of faith, and even now have a sanctifying effect
	on the believer, assimilating him to God. Still more so, when they
	shall be fulfilled.
might, c.—Greek,
	"that ye MAY become
	partakers of the divine nature," even now in part hereafter
	perfectly; 1 John 3:2, "We
	shall be like Him." 
	the divine nature—not
	God's essence, but His holiness, including His "glory"
	and "virtue," 2 Peter 1:3;
	the opposite to "corruption through lust." Sanctification
	is the imparting to us of God Himself by the Holy Spirit in
	the soul. We by faith partake also of the material nature of Jesus
	(Ephesians 5:30). The "divine
	power" enables us to be partakers of "the divine
	nature." 
	escaped the corruption—which
	involves in, and with itself, destruction at last of soul and
	body; on "escaped" as from a condemned cell, compare
	2 Peter 2:18-20; Genesis 19:17;
	Colossians 1:13. 
	through—Greek,
	"in." "The corruption in the world" has its seat,
	not so much in the surrounding elements, as in the "lust"
	or concupiscence of men's hearts.
