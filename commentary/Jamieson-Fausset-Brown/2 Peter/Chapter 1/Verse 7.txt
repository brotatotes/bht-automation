7. "And in your godliness
	brotherly kindness"; not suffering your godliness to be
	moroseness, nor a sullen solitary habit of life, but kind, generous,
	and courteous [ALFORD].
	Your natural affection and brotherly kindness are to be
	sanctified by godliness. "And in your brotherly kindness
	love," namely, to all men, even to enemies, in thought,
	word, and deed. From brotherly kindness we are to go forward
	to love. Compare 1 Thessalonians 3:12,
	"Love one toward another (brotherly kindness), and toward all
	men (charity)." So charity completes the choir of graces
	in Colossians 3:14. In a retrograde
	order, he who has love will exercise brotherly kindness;
	he who has brotherly kindness will feel godliness
	needful; the godly will mix nothing stoical with his patience;
	to the patient, temperance is easy; the temperate weighs
	things well, and so has knowledge; knowledge guards against
	sudden impulse carrying away its virtue [BENGEL].
