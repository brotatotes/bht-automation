<p><b>7.</b> "And in your godliness
	brotherly kindness"; not suffering your godliness to be
	moroseness, nor a sullen solitary habit of life, but kind, generous,
	and courteous [ALFORD].
	Your natural affection and <i>brotherly kindness</i> are to be
	sanctified by <i>godliness.</i> "And in your brotherly kindness
	love," namely, to <i>all</i> men, even to enemies, in thought,
	word, and deed. From <i>brotherly kindness</i> we are to go forward
	to <i>love.</i> Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:12">1 Thessalonians 3:12</span>,
	"Love one toward another (brotherly kindness), and toward all
	men (charity)." So <i>charity</i> completes the choir of graces
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:14">Colossians 3:14</span>. In a retrograde
	order, he who has <i>love</i> will exercise <i>brotherly kindness;</i>
	he who has <i>brotherly kindness</i> will feel <i>godliness</i>
	needful; the <i>godly</i> will mix nothing stoical with his <i>patience;</i>
	to the patient, <i>temperance</i> is easy; the temperate weighs
	things well, and so has <i>knowledge;</i> knowledge guards against
	sudden impulse carrying away its <i>virtue</i> [BENGEL].</p>
