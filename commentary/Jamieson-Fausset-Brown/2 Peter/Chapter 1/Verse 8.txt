<p><b>8. be</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "subsist"
	that is, supposing these things to have an actual <i>subsistence</i>
	in you; "be" would express the mere matter-of-fact <i>being</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:20">Acts 16:20</span>).

<p><b>abound</b>—<i>more than in

</p>
<p><b>make</b>—"render,"
	"constitute you," habitually, by the very fact of
	possessing these graces. 
	</p>
<p><b>barren</b>—"inactive,"
	and, as a field lying fallow and <i>unworked</i> (<i>Greek</i>), so
	<i>barren</i> and <i>useless.</i>
</p>
<p><b>unfruitful in</b>—rather, <i>.
	. . in respect to,</i> "The <i>full knowledge</i> (<i>Greek</i>)
	of Christ" is the goal towards which all these graces tend. As
	their <i>subsisting</i> in us constitutes us <i>not barren</i> or
	idle, so their <i>abounding</i> in us constitutes us <i>not
	unfruitful</i> in respect to it. It is through <i>doing</i> His will,
	and so becoming like Him, that we grow in <i>knowing</i> Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:20- :">Acts 16:20- :</span>).</p>
