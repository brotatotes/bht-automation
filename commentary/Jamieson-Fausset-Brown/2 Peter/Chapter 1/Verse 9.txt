<p><b>and cannot see afar

	(<i>Greek</i>) as unable to see distant objects (namely, heavenly
	things), and fixes his gaze on present and earthly things which alone
	he can see. Perhaps a degree of <i>wilfulness</i> in the blindness is

	forgiven, is the strongest stimulus to every grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). This once-for-all accomplished cleansing of unbelievers

	for all) needeth not save to <i>wash</i> his feet (of the soils
	contracted in the daily walk), but is clean every whit (in Christ our
	righteousness)." "Once purged (with Christ's blood), we
	should have no more consciousness of sin (as condemning us, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, because of God's promise)." Baptism is the sacramental
	pledge of this.</p>
