<p><b>1. But</b>—in contrast to the
	prophets "moved by the Holy Ghost" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>also</b>—as well as the
	true prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Paul had already testified the entrance of false
	prophets into the same churches. 
	</p>
<p><b>among the people</b>—Israel:
	he is writing to believing <i>Israelites</i> primarily (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Such a "false prophet" was Balaam (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>there shall be</b>—Already
	symptoms of the evil were appearing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:9-22">2 Peter 2:9-22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:4-13">Judges 1:4-13</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>false teachers</b>—teachers
	of falsehood. In contrast to the true teachers, whom he exhorts his
	readers to give heed to (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:2">2 Peter 3:2</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>who</b>—<i>such as</i>
	(literally, "the which") shall. 
	</p>
<p><b>privily</b>—not at first
	openly and directly, but <i>by the way,</i> bringing in error <i>by
	the side</i> of the true doctrine (so the <i>Greek</i>): Rome
	objects, Protestants cannot point out the exact date of the
	beginnings of the false doctrines superadded to the original truth;
	we answer, Peter foretells us it would be so, that the first
	introduction of them would be stealthy and unobserved (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:2- :">2 Peter 3:2- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>damnable</b>—literally, "of
	destruction"; entailing destruction (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:2- :">2 Peter 3:2- :</span>) on all who follow them. 
	</p>
<p><b>heresies</b>—<i>self-chosen</i>
	doctrines, not emanating from God (compare "will-worship,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>even</b>—going <i>even</i>
	to such a length as to <i>deny</i> both in teaching and practice.
	<i>Peter</i> knew, by bitter repentance, what a fearful thing it is
	to deny the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61">Luke 22:61</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:62">Luke 22:62</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>denying</b>—Him whom, above
	all others, they ought to <i>confess.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Lord</b>—"Master and
	Owner" (<i>Greek</i>), compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:62- :">Luke 22:62- :</span>, <i>Greek.</i> Whom the true doctrine teaches to be their OWNER
	<i>by</i> right of purchase. Literally, "denying Him who bought
	them (that He should be thereby), their Master." 
	</p>
<p><b>bought them</b>—Even the
	ungodly were bought by His "precious blood." It shall be
	their bitterest self-reproach in hell, that, as far as Christ's
	redemption was concerned, they might have been saved. The denial of
	His <i>propitiatory</i> sacrifice is included in the meaning (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>bring upon themselves</b>—compare
	"God <i>bringing in</i> the flood <i>upon</i> the world,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:5">2 Peter 2:5</span>. Man brings upon himself
	the vengeance which God brings upon him. 
	</p>
<p><b>swift</b>—swiftly
	descending: as the Lord's coming shall be swift and sudden. As the
	ground swallowed up Korah and Dathan, and "they went down <i>quick</i>
	into the pit." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:11">Judges 1:11</span>,
	which is akin to this passage.</p>
