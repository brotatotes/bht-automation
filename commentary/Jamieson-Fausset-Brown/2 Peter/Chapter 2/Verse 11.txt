	Judgment belongs to God, not the angels. How great is the dignity of
	the saints who, as Christ's assessors, shall hereafter judge angels!
	Meanwhile, <i>railing judgments,</i> though spoken with truth,
	<i>against dignities,</i> as being uttered irreverently, are of the
	nature of "blasphemies" (<i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:4">1 Corinthians 4:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span>). If superior angels dare
	not, as being in the presence of God, the Judge, speak evil even of
	the bad angels, how awful the presumption of those who speak evil
	blasphemously of good "dignities." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+16:7">2 Samuel 16:7</span>;

	"Were ye (Aaron and Miriam) <i>not afraid to speak evil</i> of
	My servant Moses?" The angels who sinned still retain the
	indelible impress of majesty. Satan is still "a strong man":
	"prince of this world"; and under him are "principalities,
	powers, rulers of the darkness of this world." We are to avoid
	irreverence in regard to them, not on their account, but on account
	of God. A warning to those who use Satan's name irreverently and in
	blasphemy. "When the ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth his own
	soul."</p>
