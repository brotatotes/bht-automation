	Perhaps it is implied, <i>unrighteousness</i> shall be its own <i>reward</i>
	or punishment. "Wages of unrighteousness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) has a different sense, namely, <i>the earthly gain to be

<p><b>in the daytime</b>—Translate
	as <i>Greek,</i> "counting the luxury which is in the daytime

	are deceived themselves. Compare with <i>English Version,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:22- :">Matthew 13:22- :</span>, "Whose glory is in their shame." "Their own"
	stands in opposition to "you": "While partaking of the

	their own deceivings"; Jude, the negative, "feeding

	manuscripts, <i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> and <i>Sahidic Versions</i> read
	(as Jude), "In their own love-feasts": "their own"
