13. receive—"shall carry
	off as their due." 
	reward of—that is, for
	their "unrighteousness" [ALFORD].
	Perhaps it is implied, unrighteousness shall be its own reward
	or punishment. "Wages of unrighteousness" ( :-) has a different sense, namely, the earthly gain to be
	gotten by "unrighteousness." 
	in the daytime—Translate
	as Greek, "counting the luxury which is in the daytime
	(not restricted to night, as ordinary revelling. Or as Vulgate
	and CALVIN, "the
	luxury which is but for a day": so  :-, "the pleasures of sin for a season"; and
	Hebrews 12:16, Esau) to be
	pleasure," that is, to be their chief good and highest
	enjoyment. 
	Spots—in themselves.
blemishes—disgraces:
	bringing blame (so the Greek) on the Church and on
	Christianity itself. 
	sporting themselves—Greek,
	"luxuriating." 
	with—Greek,
	"in." 
	deceivings—or else
	passively, "deceits": luxuries gotten by deceit.
	Compare Matthew 13:22,
	"Deceitfulness of riches"; Matthew 13:22- :, "Deceitful lusts." While deceiving others, they
	are deceived themselves. Compare with English Version, Matthew 13:22- :, "Whose glory is in their shame." "Their own"
	stands in opposition to "you": "While partaking of the
	love-feast (compare Judges 1:12)
	with you," they are at the same time "luxuriating in
	their own deceivings," or "deceits" (to which
	latter clause answers Judges 1:12,
	end: Peter presents the positive side, "they luxuriate in
	their own deceivings"; Jude, the negative, "feeding
	themselves without fear"). But several of the oldest
	manuscripts, Vulgate, Syriac, and Sahidic Versions read
	(as Jude), "In their own love-feasts": "their own"
	will then imply that they pervert the love-feasts so as to
	make them subserve their own self-indulgent purposes.
