14. full of adultery—literally,
	"full of an adulteress," as though they carried about
	adulteresses always dwelling in their eyes: the eye being the avenue
	of lust [HORNEIUS]. BENGEL
	makes the adulteress who fills their eyes, to be "alluring
	desire." 
	that cannot cease—"that
	cannot be made to cease from sin." 
	beguiling—"laying
	baits for." 
	unstable—not firmly
	established in faith and piety. 
	heart—not only the
	eyes, which are the channel, but the heart, the
	fountain head of lust. Job 31:7,
	"Mine heart walked after mine eyes." 
	covetous practices—The
	oldest manuscripts read singular, "covetousness." 
	cursed children—rather
	as Greek, "children of curse," that is, devoted to
	the curse. Cursing and covetousness, as in Balaam's
	case, often go together: the curse he designed for Israel fell on
	Israel's foes and on himself. True believers bless, and curse
	not, and so are blessed.
