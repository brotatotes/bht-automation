<p><b>14. full of adultery</b>—literally,
	"full of an adulteress," as though they carried about
	adulteresses always dwelling in their eyes: the eye being the avenue
	of lust [HORNEIUS]. BENGEL
	makes the <i>adulteress</i> who fills their eyes, to be "alluring
	desire." 
	</p>
<p><b>that cannot cease</b>—"that
	cannot <i>be made to cease</i> from sin." 
	</p>
<p><b>beguiling</b>—"laying
	baits for." 
	</p>
<p><b>unstable</b>—not firmly
	established in faith and piety. 
	</p>
<p><b>heart</b>—not only the
	<i>eyes,</i> which are the channel, but the <i>heart,</i> the
	fountain head of lust. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+31:7">Job 31:7</span>,
	"Mine <i>heart</i> walked after mine <i>eyes.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>covetous practices</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read singular, "covetousness." 
	</p>
<p><b>cursed children</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "children of curse," that is, devoted to
	the curse. <i>Cursing</i> and <i>covetousness,</i> as in Balaam's
	case, often go together: the curse he designed for Israel fell on
	Israel's foes and on himself. True believers <i>bless,</i> and curse
	not, and <i>so are blessed.</i></p>
