16. was rebuked—Greek,
	"had a rebuke," or conviction; an exposure of
	his specious wickedness on his being tested (the root verb of
	the Greek noun means to "convict on testing"). 
	his—Greek, "his
	own": his own beast convicted him of his own iniquity. 
	ass—literally, "beast
	of burden"; the ass was the ordinary animal used in riding in
	Palestine. 
	dumb—Greek,
	"voiceless-speaking in man's voice"; marking
	the marvellous nature of the miracle. 
	forbade—literally,
	"hindered." It was not the words of the ass (for it
	merely deprecated his beating it), but the miraculous fact of its
	speaking at all, which withstood Balaam's perversity in
	desiring to go after God had forbidden him in the first instance.
	Thus indirectly the ass, and directly the angel, rebuked his
	worse than asinine obstinacy; the ass turned aside at the
	sight of the angel, but Balaam, after God had plainly said, Thou
	shalt not go, persevered in wishing to go for gain; thus the ass, in
	act, forbade his madness. How awful a contrast—a dumb beast
	forbidding an inspired prophet!
