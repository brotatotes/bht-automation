<p><b>16. was rebuked</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"had a rebuke," or <i>conviction;</i> an <i>exposure</i> of
	his specious wickedness on his being <i>tested</i> (the root verb of
	the <i>Greek</i> noun means to "convict on testing"). 
	</p>
<p><b>his</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "his
	own": his own beast convicted him of <i>his own</i> iniquity. 
	</p>
<p><b>ass</b>—literally, "beast
	of burden"; the ass was the ordinary animal used in riding in
	Palestine. 
	</p>
<p><b>dumb</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"voiceless-speaking <i>in</i> man's <i>voice</i>"; marking
	the marvellous nature of the miracle. 
	</p>
<p><b>forbade</b>—literally,
	"hindered." It was not the <i>words</i> of the ass (for it
	merely deprecated his beating it), but <i>the miraculous fact of its
	speaking at all,</i> which <i>withstood</i> Balaam's perversity in
	desiring to go after God had forbidden him in the first instance.
	Thus indirectly the ass, and directly the angel, <i>rebuked</i> his
	worse than asinine obstinacy; the ass <i>turned aside</i> at the
	sight of the angel, but Balaam, after God had plainly said, Thou
	shalt not go, persevered in wishing to go for gain; thus the ass, <i>in
	act, forbade</i> his madness. How awful a contrast—a <i>dumb beast</i>
	forbidding an <i>inspired prophet!</i></p>
