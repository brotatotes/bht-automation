<p><b>wells</b>—"clouds"
	in Jude; both <i>promising</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:13- :">Judges 1:13- :</span>) water, but yielding none; so their "great swelling
	words" are found on trial to be but "vanity" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:13- :">Judges 1:13- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>clouds</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts and versions read, "mists," <i>dark,</i> and
	not transparent and bright as "clouds" often are, whence
	the latter term is applied sometimes to the saints; fit emblem of the
	children of darkness. "Clouds" is a transcriber's
	correction from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:12">Judges 1:12</span>, where
	it is appropriate, "clouds . . . without water" (promising
	what they do not perform); but not here, "mists driven along by
	a tempest."

<p><b>mist</b>—<i>blackness;</i>
