<p><b>22. But</b>â€”You need not wonder at
	the event; for <i>dogs</i> and <i>swine</i> they were before, and
	dogs and swine they will continue. They "scarcely" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) have escaped from their filthy folly, when they again are
	entangled in it. Then they seduce others who have in like manner "for
	a little time escaped from them that live in error" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Peter often quoted Proverbs in his First Epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:7">1 Peter 1:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:17">1 Peter 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:8">1 Peter 4:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:18">1 Peter 4:18</span>); another proof that
	both Epistles come from the same writer.</p>
