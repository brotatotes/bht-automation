4. if—The apodosis or
	consequent member of the sentence is not expressed, but is virtually
	contained in 2 Peter 2:9. If God in
	past time has punished the ungodly and saved His people, He will be
	sure to do so also in our days (compare end of 2 Peter 2:9- :). 
	angels—the highest of
	intelligent creatures (compare with this verse, 2 Peter 2:9- :), yet not spared when they sinned. 
	hell—Greek,
	"Tartarus": nowhere else in New Testament or the
	Septuagint: equivalent to the usual Greek, "Gehenna."
	Not inconsistent with 1 Peter 5:8;
	for though their final doom is hell, yet for a time they are
	permitted to roam beyond it in "the darkness of this world."
	Slaves of Tartarus (called "the abyss," or "deep,"
	Luke 8:31; "the bottomless
	pit," Revelation 9:11) may also
	come upon earth. Step by step they are given to Tartarus, until at
	last they shall be wholly bound to it. 
	delivered—as the judge
	delivers the condemned prisoner to the officers (Revelation 9:11- :). 
	into chains— (Revelation 9:11- :). The oldest manuscripts read, "dens," as ALFORD
	translates: the Greek, however, may, in Hellenistic Greek,
	mean "chains," as Jude expresses it. They are "reserved"
	unto hell's "mist of darkness" as their final "judgment"
	or doom, and meanwhile their exclusion from the light of heaven is
	begun. So the ungodly were considered as virtually "in prison,"
	though at large on the earth, from the moment that God's sentence
	went forth, though not executed till one hundred twenty years after.
