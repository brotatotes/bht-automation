<p><b>4. if</b>—The apodosis or
	consequent member of the sentence is not expressed, but is virtually
	contained in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:9">2 Peter 2:9</span>. If God in
	past time has punished the ungodly and saved His people, He will be
	sure to do so also in our days (compare end of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:9- :">2 Peter 2:9- :</span>).

<p><b>angels</b>—the highest of
	intelligent creatures (compare with this verse, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:9- :">2 Peter 2:9- :</span>), yet not spared when they sinned. 
	</p>
<p><b>hell</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>Tartarus</i>": nowhere else in New Testament or the
	<i>Septuagint:</i> equivalent to the usual <i>Greek,</i> "<i>Gehenna.</i>"
	Not inconsistent with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8">1 Peter 5:8</span>;
	for though their final doom is <i>hell,</i> yet for a time they are
	permitted to roam beyond it in "the darkness of this world."
	Slaves of <i>Tartarus</i> (called "the abyss," or "deep,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:31">Luke 8:31</span>; "the bottomless
	pit," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:11">Revelation 9:11</span>) may also
	come upon earth. Step by step they are given to Tartarus, until at
	last they shall be wholly bound to it. 
	</p>
<p><b>delivered</b>—as the judge
	delivers the condemned prisoner to the officers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:11- :">Revelation 9:11- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>into chains</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:11- :">Revelation 9:11- :</span>). The oldest manuscripts read, "dens," as ALFORD
	translates: the <i>Greek,</i> however, may, in Hellenistic <i>Greek,</i>
	mean "chains," as Jude expresses it. They are "reserved"
	unto hell's "mist of darkness" as their final "judgment"
	or doom, and meanwhile their exclusion from the light of heaven is
	begun. So the ungodly were considered as virtually "in prison,"
	though at large on the earth, from the moment that God's sentence
	went forth, though not executed till one hundred twenty years after.</p>
