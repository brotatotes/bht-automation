<p><b>10.</b> The certainty, suddenness,
	and concomitant effects, of the coming of the day of the Lord. FABER
	argues from this that the millennium, c., must <i>precede</i>
	Christ's literal coming, not <i>follow</i> it. But "the day of
	the Lord" comprehends the whole series of events, beginning with
	the pre-millennial advent, and ending with the destruction of the
	wicked, and final conflagration, and general judgment (which last
	intervenes between the conflagration and the renovation of the
	earth).

<p><b>will</b>—emphatical. But
	(in spite of the mockers, and notwithstanding the delay) <i>come and
	be present</i> the day of the Lord SHALL.

<p><b>as a thief</b>—Peter

<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:41">Luke 12:41</span>) used in the

<p><b>elements</b>—<i>the
	component materials of the world</i> [WAHL].
	However, as "the works" in the earth are mentioned
	separately from "the earth," so it is likely by "elements,"
	mentioned after "the heavens," are meant "the works
	therein," namely, <i>the sun, moon, and stars</i> (as THEOPHILUS
	OF ANTIOCH [p. 22,
	148, 228]; and JUSTIN
	MARTYR [<i>Apology,</i>
	2.44], use the word "elements"): these, as at creation, so
	in the destruction of the world, are mentioned [BENGEL].
	But as "elements" is not so used in Scripture <i>Greek,</i>
	perhaps it refers to <i>the component materials</i> of "the
	heavens," including <i>the heavenly bodies;</i> it clearly
	belongs to the former clause, "the heavens," not to the
	following, "the earth," &amp;c.
