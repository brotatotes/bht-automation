<p><b>12. hasting unto</b>—<i>with the
	utmost eagerness desiring</i> [WAHL],
	praying for, and contemplating, the coming Saviour as at hand. The
	<i>Greek may</i> mean "hastening (that is, <i>urging onward</i>
	[ALFORD]) the day of God";
	not that God's eternal appointment of the time is changeable, but God
	appoints <i>us</i> as instruments of accomplishing those events which
	must be first before the day of God can come. By praying for His
	coming, furthering the preaching of the Gospel for a witness to all
	nations, and bringing in those whom "the long-suffering of God"
	waits to save, we <i>hasten the coming of the day of God.</i> The
	<i>Greek</i> verb is always in New Testament used as neuter (as
	<i>English Version</i> here), not active; but the <i>Septuagint</i>
	uses it <i>actively. Christ</i> says, "Surely I come quickly.
	Amen." <i>Our</i> part is to <i>speed forward</i> this
	consummation by praying, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the coming</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>presence</i>" of a <i>person:</i> usually, of the
	Saviour. 
	</p>
<p><b>the day of God</b>—God has
	given many myriads of days to <i>men:</i> one shall be the great "day
	of God" Himself. 
	</p>
<p><b>wherein</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "on account of (or <i>owing to</i>) which"
	day. 
	</p>
<p><b>heavens</b>—the upper and
	lower regions of the sky. 
	</p>
<p><b>melt</b>—Our igneous rocks
	show that they were once in a liquid state.</p>
