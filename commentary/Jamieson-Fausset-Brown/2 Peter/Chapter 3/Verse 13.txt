<p><b>13. Nevertheless</b>—"But":
	in contrast to the destructive effects of the day of God stand its
	constructive effects. As the flood was the baptism of the earth,
	eventuating in a renovated earth, partially delivered from "the
	curse," so the baptism with fire shall purify the earth so as to
	be the renovated abode of regenerated man, wholly freed from the
	curse.

<p><b>his promise</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:17">Isaiah 65:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:22">Isaiah 66:22</span>). The "we" is
	not emphatical as in <i>English Version.</i>
</p>
<p><b>new heavens</b>—new
	atmospheric heavens surrounding the renovated earth. 
	</p>
<p><b>righteousness</b>—<i>dwelleth</i>
	in that coming world as its essential feature, all pollutions having
	been removed.</p>
