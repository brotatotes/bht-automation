14. that ye . . . be found of
	him—"in His sight" [ALFORD],
	at His coming; plainly implying a personal coming. 
	without spot—at the
	coming marriage feast of the Lamb, in contrast to  :-, "Spots they are and blemishes while they feast,"
	not having on the King's pure wedding garment. 
	blameless— (1 Corinthians 1:8;
	Philippians 1:10; 1 Thessalonians 3:13;
	1 Thessalonians 5:23). 
	in peace—in all its
	aspects, towards God, your own consciences, and your fellow men, and
	as its consequence eternal blessedness: "the God of
	peace" will effect this for you.
