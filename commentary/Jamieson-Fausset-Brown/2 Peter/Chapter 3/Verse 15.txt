<p><b>15. account . . . the long-suffering

	to be gathered into the Church: whereas those scoffers "count it

<p><b>our beloved brother Paul</b>—a
	beautiful instance of love and humility. Peter praises the very
	Epistles which contain his condemnation. 
	</p>
<p><b>according to the wisdom given

	Ephesians, <i>Colossians,</i> the same region as Peter addresses.
	Compare "in peace," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, a practical exhibition of which Peter now gives in showing
	how perfectly agreeing Paul (who wrote the Epistle to the <i>Galatians</i>)
	and he are, notwithstanding the event recorded (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span> refers to
	<i>Christ's second coming.</i> The Epistle to the Hebrews, too
	(addressed not only to the Palestinian, but also secondarily to the
	Hebrew Christians everywhere), may be referred to, as Peter primarily
	(though not exclusively) addresses in both Epistles the <i>Hebrew</i>
	Christians of the dispersion (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4- :">Colossians 3:4- :</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:27">Hebrews 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span>;

	"speak of these things" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:37- :">Hebrews 10:37- :</span>) which Peter has been handling, namely, the coming of the
	day of the Lord, delayed through His "long-suffering," yet
	near and sudden.</p>
