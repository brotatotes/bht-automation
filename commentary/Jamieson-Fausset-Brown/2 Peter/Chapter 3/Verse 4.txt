4. (Compare Psalms 10:11;
	Psalms 73:11.) Presumptuous
	skepticism and lawless lust, setting nature and its so-called laws
	above the God of nature and revelation, and arguing from the past
	continuity of nature's phenomena that there can be no future
	interruption to them, was the sin of the antediluvians, and shall be
	that of the scoffers in the last days. 
	Where—implying that it
	ought to have taken place before this, if ever it was to take place,
	but that it never will. 
	the promise—which you,
	believers, are so continually looking for the fulfilment of (Psalms 73:11- :). What becomes of the promise which you talk so much of? 
	his—Christ's;
	the subject of prophecy from the earliest days. 
	the fathers—to whom the
	promise was made, and who rested all their hopes on it. 
	all things—in the
	natural world; skeptics look not beyond this. 
	as they were—continue
	as they do; as we see them to continue. From the time of the
	promise of Christ's coming as Saviour and King being given to the
	fathers, down to the present time, all things continue, and have
	continued, as they now are, from "the beginning of
	creation." The "scoffers" here are not necessarily
	atheists, nor do they maintain that the world existed from eternity.
	They are willing to recognize a God, but not the God of
	revelation. They reason from seeming delay against the fulfilment
	of God's word at all.
