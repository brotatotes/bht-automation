<p><b>5.</b> Refutation of their scoffing
	from Scripture history. 
	</p>
<p><b>willingly</b>—wilfully;
	they do not <i>wish</i> to know. Their ignorance is voluntary. 
	</p>
<p><b>they . . . are ignorant of</b>—in
	contrast to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:8">2 Peter 3:8</span>, "Be
	not ignorant of this." Literally, in both verses, "This
	escapes THEIR notice
	(sagacious philosophers though they think themselves)"; "let
	this not escape YOUR
	notice." They obstinately shut their eyes to the Scripture
	record of the creation and the deluge; the latter is the very
	parallel to the coming judgment by fire, which Jesus mentions, as
	Peter doubtless remembered. 
	</p>
<p><b>by the word of God</b>—not
	by a fortuitous concurrence of atoms [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>of old</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"from of old"; from the first beginning of all things. A
	confutation of their objection, "all things continue as they
	were FROM THE BEGINNING OF
	CREATION." Before the flood, the same objection to the
	possibility of the flood might have been urged with the same
	plausibility: The heavens (sky) and earth have been FROM
	OF OLD, how unlikely then that they should not <i>continue</i>
	so! But, replies Peter, the flood came in spite of their reasonings;
	so will the conflagration of the earth come in spite of the
	"scoffers" of the last days, changing the whole order of
	things (the present "world," or as <i>Greek</i> means,
	"order"), and introducing the new heavens and earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:8- :">2 Peter 3:8- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>earth standing out of</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"consisting of," that is, "formed out of the water."
	The waters under the firmament were at creation gathered together
	into one place, and the dry land emerged <i>out of</i> and above,
	them. 
	</p>
<p><b>in,</b> &amp;c.—rather, "<i>by
	means of</i> the water," as a great instrument (along with <i>fire</i>)
	in the changes wrought on the earth's surface to prepare it for man.
	Held together BY the
	water. The earth arose <i>out of</i> the water <i>by the efficacy of
	the water</i> itself [TITTMANN].</p>
