<p><b>6. Whereby</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i> "By
	which" (plural). <i>By means of which</i> heavens and earth (in
	respect to the WATERS
	which flowed together <i>from both</i>) <i>the then world perished</i>
	(that is, in respect to its <i>occupants,</i> men and animals, and
	its then existing <i>order:</i> not <i>was annihilated</i>); for in
	the flood "the fountains of the great deep were broken up"
	from <i>the earth</i> (1) below, and "the windows of <i>heaven</i>"
	(2) above "were opened." The earth was deluged by that
	water <i>out of</i> which it had originally risen.</p>
