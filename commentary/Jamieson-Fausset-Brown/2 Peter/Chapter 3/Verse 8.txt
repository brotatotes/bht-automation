<p><b>8. be not ignorant</b>—as those
	scoffers are (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:5">2 Peter 3:5</span>). Besides
	the refutation of them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:5- :">2 Peter 3:5- :</span>) drawn from the history of the deluge, here he adds another
	(addressed more to believers than to the mockers): God's delay in
	fulfilling His promise is not, like men's delays, owing to inability
	or fickleness in keeping His word, but through "long-suffering."
	</p>
<p><b>this one thing</b>—as the
	consideration <i>of chief importance</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:5- :">2 Peter 3:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>one day . . . thousand years</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+90:4">Psalms 90:4</span>): Moses there says,
	Thy <i>eternity,</i> knowing no distinction between a <i>thousand</i>
	years and a <i>day,</i> is the refuge of us creatures of a day. Peter
	views God's eternity in relation to the last day: that day seems to
	us, short-lived beings, long in coming, but <i>with the Lord</i> the
	interval is irrespective of the idea of long or short. His eternity
	exceeds all measures of time: to His divine knowledge all future
	things are present: His power requires not long delays for the
	performance of His work: His long-suffering excludes all impatient
	expectation and eager haste, such as we men feel. He is equally
	blessed in one day and in a thousand years. He can do the work of a
	thousand years in one day: so in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+90:4- :">Psalms 90:4- :</span> it is said, "He is not slack," that is, "slow":
	He has always the power to fulfil His "promise." 
	</p>
<p><b>thousand years as one day</b>—No
	delay which occurs is long to God: as to a man of countless riches, a
	thousand guineas are as a single penny. God's oeligonologe
	(<i>eternal-ages</i> measurer) differs wholly from man's horologe
	(<i>hour</i>-glass). His gnomon (dial-pointer) shows all the hours at
	once in the greatest activity and in perfect repose. To Him the hours
	pass away, neither more slowly, nor more quickly, than befits His
	economy. There is nothing to make Him need either to hasten or delay
	the end. The words, "with the Lord" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+90:4- :">Psalms 90:4- :</span>, "In Thy sight"), silence all man's objections on
	the ground of his incapability of understanding this [BENGEL].</p>
