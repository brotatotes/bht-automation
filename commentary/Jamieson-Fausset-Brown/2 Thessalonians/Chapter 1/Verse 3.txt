<p><b>3. We are bound</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"We owe it as a debt" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). They had prayed for the Thessalonians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) that they might "increase and abound in love";
	their prayer having been heard, it is a small but a bounden return
	for them to make, to thank God for it. Thus, Paul and his fellow
	missionaries practice what they preach (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>, their
	thanksgiving was for the Thessalonians' faith, love, and patience";
	here, for their <i>exceeding growth</i> in <i>faith,</i> and for
	their <i>charity abounding.</i> "We are bound" expresses
	the duty of thanksgiving from its subjective side as an inward
	conviction. "As it is meet," from the <i>objective:</i>
	side as something answering to the state of circumstances [ALFORD].
	Observe the exact correspondence of the prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3- :">1 Thessalonians 1:3- :</span>, "The Lord make you to abound in love") and the
	answer, "The love of every one of you all toward each other
	aboundeth" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:10">1 Thessalonians 4:10</span>).
