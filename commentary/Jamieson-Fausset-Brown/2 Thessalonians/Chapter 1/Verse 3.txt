3. We are bound—Greek,
	"We owe it as a debt" ( :-). They had prayed for the Thessalonians ( :-) that they might "increase and abound in love";
	their prayer having been heard, it is a small but a bounden return
	for them to make, to thank God for it. Thus, Paul and his fellow
	missionaries practice what they preach ( :-). In 1 Thessalonians 1:3, their
	thanksgiving was for the Thessalonians' faith, love, and patience";
	here, for their exceeding growth in faith, and for
	their charity abounding. "We are bound" expresses
	the duty of thanksgiving from its subjective side as an inward
	conviction. "As it is meet," from the objective:
	side as something answering to the state of circumstances [ALFORD].
	Observe the exact correspondence of the prayer (1 Thessalonians 1:3- :, "The Lord make you to abound in love") and the
	answer, "The love of every one of you all toward each other
	aboundeth" (compare 1 Thessalonians 4:10).
	meet—right.
