4. glory in you—make our boast
	of you, literally, "in your case." "Ourselves"
	implies that not merely did they hear others speaking of the
	Thessalonians' faith, but they, the missionaries themselves,
	boasted of it. Compare 1 Thessalonians 1:8,
	wherein the apostle said, their faith was so well known in various
	places, that he and his fellow missionaries had no need to speak of
	it; but here he says, so abounding is their love, combined with faith
	and patience, that he and his fellow missionaries themselves,
	make it a matter of glorying in the various churches elsewhere (he
	was now at Corinth in Achaia, and boasted there of the faith of the
	Macedonian churches, 2 Corinthians 10:15-17;
	2 Corinthians 8:1, at the same time giving
	the glory to the Lord), not only looking forward to glorying thereat
	at Christ's coming (1 Thessalonians 2:19),
	but doing so even now. 
	patience—in 1 Thessalonians 2:19- :, "patience of hope." Here hope is
	tacitly implied as the ground of their patience; 2 Thessalonians 1:5;
	2 Thessalonians 1:7 state the object of their
	hope, namely, the kingdom for which they suffer. 
	tribulations—literally,
	"pressures." The Jews were the instigators of the populace
	and of the magistrates against Christians (Acts 17:6;
	Acts 17:8). 
	which ye endure—Greek,
	"are (now) enduring."
