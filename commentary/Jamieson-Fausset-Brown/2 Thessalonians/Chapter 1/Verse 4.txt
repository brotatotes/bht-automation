<p><b>4. glory in you</b>—make our boast
	of you, literally, "in your case." "Ourselves"
	implies that not merely did they hear others speaking of the
	Thessalonians' faith, but they, the missionaries <i>themselves,</i>
	boasted of it. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:8">1 Thessalonians 1:8</span>,
	wherein the apostle said, their faith was so well known in various
	places, that he and his fellow missionaries had no need to speak of
	it; but here he says, so abounding is their love, combined with faith
	and patience, that he and his fellow missionaries <i>themselves,</i>
	make it a matter of glorying in the various churches elsewhere (he
	was now at Corinth in Achaia, and boasted there of the faith of the
	Macedonian churches, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:15-17">2 Corinthians 10:15-17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:1">2 Corinthians 8:1</span>, at the same time giving
	the glory to the Lord), not only looking forward to glorying thereat
	at Christ's coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>),
	but doing so even now.

<p><b>patience</b>—in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19- :">1 Thessalonians 2:19- :</span>, "patience <i>of hope.</i>" Here <i>hope</i> is
	tacitly implied as the ground of their patience; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:5">2 Thessalonians 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span> state the object of their
	hope, namely, the kingdom for which they suffer.

<p><b>tribulations</b>—literally,
	"pressures." The Jews were the instigators of the populace
	and of the magistrates against Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:6">Acts 17:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:8">Acts 17:8</span>).
