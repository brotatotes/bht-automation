<p><b>5. Which</b>—Your <i>enduring</i>
	these tribulations is a "token of the righteous judgment of
	God," manifested in your being enabled to endure them, and in
	your adversaries thereby filling up the measure of their guilt. The
	judgment is even now begun, but its consummation will be at the
	Lord's coming. David (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) and Jeremiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) were perplexed at the wicked prospering and the godly
	suffering. But Paul, by the light of the New Testament, makes this
	fact a matter of consolation. It is a <i>proof</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>)
	of the future judgment, which will set to rights the anomalies of the
	present state, by rewarding the now suffering saint, and by punishing
	the persecutor. And even now "the Judge of all the earth does
	right" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:25">Genesis 18:25</span>); for the
	godly are in themselves sinful and need chastisement to amend them.
	What they suffer unjustly at the hands of cruel men they suffer
	justly at the hands of God; and they have their evil things here that
	they may escape condemnation with the world and have their good
	things hereafter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:25">Luke 16:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:32">1 Corinthians 11:32</span>) [EDMUNDS].

<p><b>that ye may be counted
	worthy</b>—expressing the purpose of God's "righteous
	judgment" as regards you.

<p><b>for which</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>in behalf</i> of which ye are also suffering" (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:41">Acts 5:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:16">Acts 9:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:29">Philippians 1:29</span>). "Worthy"
	implies that, though men are justified by faith, they shall be judged
	"according to their works" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:29- :">Philippians 1:29- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:12">1 Thessalonians 2:12</span>;

	implies the connection between <i>the suffering for the kingdom</i>
	and <i>being counted worthy</i> of it. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>;
