<p><b>6. seeing it is a righteous
	thing</b>—This justifies the assertion above of there being a
	"<i>righteous</i> judgment" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), namely, "seeing that it is (literally, '<i>if at
	least,</i>' '<i>if at all events it is</i>') a <i>righteous</i> thing
	with (that is, in the estimation of) God" (which, as we all
	feel, it certainly is). Our own innate feeling of what is just, in
	this confirms what is revealed.

<p><b>recompense</b>—requite <i>in
	kind,</i> namely, <i>tribulation</i> to them that trouble you
	(<i>affliction</i> to those that <i>afflict</i> you); and to you who
	are <i>troubled, rest from trouble.</i></p>
