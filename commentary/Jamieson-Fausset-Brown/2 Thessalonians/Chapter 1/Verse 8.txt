8. In flaming fire—Greek,
	"In flame of fire"; or, as other oldest manuscripts read,
	"in fire of flame." This flame of fire
	accompanied His manifestation in the bush ( :-); also His giving of the law at Sinai ( :-). Also it shall accompany His revelation at His advent
	(Daniel 7:9; Daniel 7:10),
	symbolizing His own bright glory and His consuming vengeance against
	His foes (Hebrews 10:27; Hebrews 12:29;
	2 Peter 3:7; 2 Peter 3:10).
	taking—literally,
	"giving" them, as their portion, "vengeance."
	know not God—the
	Gentiles primarily (Psalms 79:6;
	Galatians 4:8; 1 Thessalonians 4:5);
	not of course those involuntarily not knowing God, but those
	wilfully not knowing Him, as Pharaoh, who might have known God
	if he would, but who boasted "I know not the Lord" (1 Thessalonians 4:5- :); and as the heathen persecutors who might have known God by
	the preaching of those whom they persecuted. Secondarily, all who
	"profess to know God but in works deny Him" (1 Thessalonians 4:5- :). 
	obey not the gospel—primarily
	the unbelieving Jews (Romans 10:3;
	Romans 10:16); secondarily, all who
	obey not the truth (Romans 2:8). 
	Christ—omitted by some
	of the oldest manuscripts, and retained by others.
