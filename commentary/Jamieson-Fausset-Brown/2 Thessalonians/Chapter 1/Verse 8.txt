<p><b>8. In flaming fire</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"In flame of fire"; or, as other oldest manuscripts read,
	"<i>in fire of flame.</i>" This <i>flame of fire</i>
	accompanied His manifestation in the bush (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); also His giving of the law at Sinai (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Also it shall accompany His revelation at His advent
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:9">Daniel 7:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:10">Daniel 7:10</span>),
	symbolizing His own bright glory and His consuming vengeance against
	His foes (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:27">Hebrews 10:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:29">Hebrews 12:29</span>;

<p><b>know not God</b>—the
	Gentiles primarily (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+79:6">Psalms 79:6</span>;

	not of course those <i>involuntarily</i> not knowing God, but those
	<i>wilfully</i> not knowing Him, as Pharaoh, who might have known God
	if he would, but who boasted "I know not the Lord" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:5- :">1 Thessalonians 4:5- :</span>); and as the heathen persecutors who might have known God by
	the preaching of those whom they persecuted. Secondarily, all who
	"profess to know God but in works deny Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:5- :">1 Thessalonians 4:5- :</span>).

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:16">Romans 10:16</span>); secondarily, all who
