9. Who—Greek, "persons
	who," c. 
	destruction from the presence
	of the Lord—driven far from His presence [ALFORD].
	The sentence emanating from Him in person, sitting as Judge
	[BENGEL], and driving
	them far from Him (Matthew 25:41
Revelation 6:16; Revelation 12:14;
	compare 1 Peter 3:12; Isaiah 2:10;
	Isaiah 2:19). "The presence of
	the Lord" is the source whence the sentence goes forth; "the
	glory of His power" is the instrument whereby the sentence is
	carried into execution [EDMUNDS].
	But ALFORD better
	interprets the latter clause (see Isaiah 2:19- :), driven "from the manifestation of His power in the
	glorification of His saints." Cast out from the presence
	of the Lord is the idea at the root of eternal death, the law of
	evil left to its unrestricted working, without one counteracting
	influence of the presence of God, who is the source of all light and
	holiness (Isaiah 66:24; Mark 9:44).
