<p><b>9. Who</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "persons

	</p>
<p><b>destruction from the presence
	of the Lord</b>—driven <i>far from</i> His presence [ALFORD].
	The sentence <i>emanating from Him</i> in person, sitting as Judge
	[BENGEL], and <i>driving
	them far from</i> Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:41">Matthew 25:41</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:16">Revelation 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:14">Revelation 12:14</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:12">1 Peter 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:10">Isaiah 2:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:19">Isaiah 2:19</span>). "The presence of
	the Lord" is the source whence the sentence goes forth; "the
	glory of His power" is the instrument whereby the sentence is
	carried into execution [EDMUNDS].
	But ALFORD better
	interprets the latter clause (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+2:19- :">Isaiah 2:19- :</span>), driven "from the manifestation of His power <i>in the
	glorification of His saints.</i>" <i>Cast out from the presence
	of the Lord</i> is the idea at the root of eternal death, the law of
	evil left to its unrestricted working, without one counteracting
	influence of the presence of God, who is the source of all light and
	holiness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:24">Isaiah 66:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:44">Mark 9:44</span>).</p>
