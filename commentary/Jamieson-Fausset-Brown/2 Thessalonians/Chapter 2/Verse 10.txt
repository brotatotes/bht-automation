10. deceivableness—rather as
	Greek, "deceit of (to promote) unrighteousness" ( :-). 
	in—The oldest
	manuscripts and versions omit "in." Translate, "unto
	them that are perishing" (2 Corinthians 2:15;
	2 Corinthians 2:16; 2 Corinthians 4:3):
	the victims of him whose very name describes his perishing
	nature, "the son of perdition"; in contrast to you
	whom (2 Thessalonians 2:13) "God hath
	from the beginning chosen to salvation through sanctification
	of the Spirit and belief of the truth." 
	because—literally, "in
	requital for"; in just retribution for their having no love
	for the truth which was within their reach (on account of its putting
	a check on their bad passions), and for their having "pleasure
	in unrighteousness" (2 Thessalonians 2:12;
	Romans 1:18); they are lost
	because they loved not, but rejected, the truth which would have
	saved them. 
	received not—Greek,
	"welcomed not"; admitted it not cordially. 
	love of the truth—not
	merely love of truth, but love of THE
	truth (and of, Jesus who is the Truth, in opposition to
	Satan's "lie," 2 Thessalonians 2:9;
	2 Thessalonians 2:11; John 8:42-44),
	can save (Ephesians 4:21). We
	are required not merely to assent to, but to love the truth
	(Psalms 119:97). The Jews
	rejected Him who came in His divine Father's name; they will receive
	Antichrist coming in his own name (Psalms 119:97- :). Their pleasant sin shall prove their terrible scourge.
