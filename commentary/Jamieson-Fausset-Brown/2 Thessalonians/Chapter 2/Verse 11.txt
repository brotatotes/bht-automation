	"they received not the love of the truth." The best
	safeguard against error is "the love of the truth." 
	shall send—Greek,
	"sends," or "is sending"; the "delusion"
	is already beginning. God judicially sends hardness of heart on those
	who have rejected the truth, and gives them up in righteous judgment
	to Satan's delusions (Isaiah 6:9;
	Isaiah 6:10; Romans 1:24-26;
	Romans 1:28). They first cast off
	the love of the truth, then God gives them up to Satan's delusions,
	then they settle down into "believing the lie": an awful
	climax (1 Kings 22:22; 1 Kings 22:23;
	Ezekiel 14:9; Job 12:16;
	Matthew 24:5; Matthew 24:11;
	1 Timothy 4:1). 
	strong delusion—Greek,
	"the powerful working of error," answering to the
	energizing "working of Satan" (1 Timothy 4:1- :); the same expression as is applied to the Holy Ghost's
	operation in believers: "powerful" or "effectual
	(energizing) working" (1 Timothy 4:1- :). 
	believe a lie—rather,
	"the lie" which Antichrist tells them, appealing to
	his miracles as proofs of it . . . (1 Timothy 4:1- :).
