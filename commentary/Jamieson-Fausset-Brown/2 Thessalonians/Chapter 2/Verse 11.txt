<p><b>shall send</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"sends," or "is sending"; the "delusion"
	is already beginning. God judicially sends hardness of heart on those
	who have rejected the truth, and gives them up in righteous judgment
	to Satan's delusions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:9">Isaiah 6:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:10">Isaiah 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24-26">Romans 1:24-26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>). They first cast off
	the love of the truth, then God gives them up to Satan's delusions,
	then they settle down into "believing the lie": an awful
	climax (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:22">1 Kings 22:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+22:23">1 Kings 22:23</span>;

	"the powerful working of error," answering to the

	operation in believers: "powerful" or "effectual
	(energizing) working" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1- :">1 Timothy 4:1- :</span>).
