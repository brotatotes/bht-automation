13. But—In delightful contrast
	to the damnation of the lost ( :-) stands the "salvation" of Paul's converts. 
	are bound—in duty ( :-). 
	thanks . . . to God—not
	to ourselves, your ministers, nor to you, our converts. 
	beloved of the Lord—Jesus
	(Romans 8:37; Galatians 2:20;
	Ephesians 5:2; Ephesians 5:25).
	Elsewhere God the Father is said to love us (2 Thessalonians 2:16;
	John 3:16; Ephesians 2:4;
	Colossians 3:12). Therefore Jesus and
	the Father are one. 
	from the beginning—"before
	the foundation of the world" (Colossians 3:12- :; compare 1 Corinthians 2:7;
	2 Timothy 1:9); in contrast to those
	that shall "worship the beast, whose names are not written in
	the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"
	(Revelation 13:8). Some of the oldest
	manuscripts read as English Version, but other oldest
	manuscripts and Vulgate read, "as first-fruits."
	The Thessalonians were among the first converts in Europe (compare
	Romans 16:5; 1 Corinthians 16:15).

	Revelation 14:4; so I understand it here
	including the more restricted sense. 
	chosen you—The Greek,
	is not the ordinary word for "elected," implying His
	eternal selection; but taken for Himself, implying His
	having adopted them in His eternal purpose. It is found in the
	Septuagint (Deuteronomy 7:7;
	Deuteronomy 10:15). 
	through—rather as
	Greek, "in sanctification" as the element in
	which the choice to salvation had place (compare Deuteronomy 10:15- :), standing in contrast to the "unrighteousness,"
	the element in which Antichrist's followers are given over by God to
	damnation (2 Thessalonians 2:12). 
	of the Spirit—wrought
	by the Spirit who sanctifies all the elect people of God, first by
	eternally consecrating them to perfect holiness in Christ, once for
	all, next by progressively imparting it. 
	belief of the
	truth—contrasted with "believed not the truth" (2 Thessalonians 2:12- :).
