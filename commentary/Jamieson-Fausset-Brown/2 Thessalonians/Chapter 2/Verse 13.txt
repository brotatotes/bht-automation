<p><b>13. But</b>—In delightful contrast
	to the damnation of the lost (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) stands the "salvation" of Paul's converts. 
	</p>
<p><b>are bound</b>—in duty (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>thanks . . . to God</b>—not
	to ourselves, your ministers, nor to you, our converts. 
	</p>
<p><b>beloved of the Lord</b>—Jesus
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:37">Romans 8:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>;

	Elsewhere <i>God the Father</i> is said to love us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:16">2 Thessalonians 2:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:16">John 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:4">Ephesians 2:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>). Therefore Jesus and
	the Father are one. 
	</p>
<p><b>from the beginning</b>—"before
	the foundation of the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12- :">Colossians 3:12- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>); in contrast to those
	that shall "worship the beast, whose names are not written in
	the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>). Some of the oldest
	manuscripts read as <i>English Version,</i> but other oldest
	manuscripts and <i>Vulgate</i> read, "as <i>first-fruits.</i>"
	The Thessalonians were among the first converts in Europe (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5">Romans 16:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:15">1 Corinthians 16:15</span>).
	In a more general sense, it occurs in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:4">Revelation 14:4</span>; so I understand it here
	including the more restricted sense.

<p><b>chosen you</b>—The <i>Greek,</i>
	is not the ordinary word for "elected," implying His
	eternal <i>selection;</i> but <i>taken for Himself,</i> implying His
	having <i>adopted</i> them in His eternal purpose. It is found in the
	<i>Septuagint</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+7:7">Deuteronomy 7:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:15">Deuteronomy 10:15</span>).

<p><b>through</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>in</i> sanctification" as the element in
	which <i>the choice to salvation</i> had place (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+10:15- :">Deuteronomy 10:15- :</span>), standing in contrast to the "unrighteousness,"
	the element in which Antichrist's followers are given over by God to
	<i>damnation</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:12">2 Thessalonians 2:12</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of the Spirit</b>—wrought
	by the Spirit who sanctifies all the elect people of God, first by
	eternally consecrating them to perfect holiness in Christ, once for
	all, next by progressively imparting it.

<p><b>belief of the
