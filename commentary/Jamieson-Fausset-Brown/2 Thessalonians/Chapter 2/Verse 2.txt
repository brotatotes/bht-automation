2. soon—on trifling grounds,
	without due consideration. 
	shaken—literally,
	"tossed" as ships tossed by an agitated sea. Compare for
	the same image, Ephesians 4:14. 
	in mind—rather as the
	Greek, "from your mind," that is, from your
	mental steadfastness on the subject. 
	troubled—This verb
	applies to emotional agitation; as "shaken" to
	intellectual.
by spirit—by a person
	professing to have the spirit of prophecy (1 Corinthians 12:8-10;
	1 John 4:1-3). The
	Thessalonians had been warned (1 Thessalonians 5:20;
	1 Thessalonians 5:21) to "prove"
	such professed prophesyings, and to "hold fast (only) that which
	is good." 
	by word—of mouth
	(compare 2 Thessalonians 2:5; 2 Thessalonians 2:15);
	some word or saying alleged to be that of Paul, orally communicated.
	If oral tradition was liable to such perversion in the apostolic age
	(compare a similar instance, 2 Thessalonians 2:15- :), how much more in our age! 
	by letter as from
	us—purporting to be from us, whereas it is a forgery. Hence he
	gives a test by which to know his genuine letters (2 Thessalonians 2:15- :). 
	day of Christ—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "day of the Lord." 
	is at hand—rather, "is
	immediately imminent," literally, "is present";
	"is instantly coming." Christ and His apostles
	always taught that the day of the Lord's coming is at hand;
	and it is not likely that Paul would imply anything contrary here;
	what he denies is, that it is so immediately imminent, instant,
	or present, as to justify the neglect of everyday worldly
	duties. CHRYSOSTOM, and
	after him ALFORD,
	translates, "is (already) present" (compare 2 Thessalonians 2:15- :), a kindred error. But in 2 Thessalonians 2:15- :, the same Greek verb is translated "come."
	WAHL supports this view.
	The Greek is usually used of actual presence; but is quite
	susceptible of the translation, "is all but present."
