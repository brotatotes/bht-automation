<p><b>2. soon</b>—on trifling grounds,
	without due consideration. 
	</p>
<p><b>shaken</b>—literally,
	"tossed" as ships tossed by an agitated sea. Compare for
	the same image, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>in mind</b>—rather as the
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>from</i> your mind," that is, from your
	mental steadfastness on the subject. 
	</p>
<p><b>troubled</b>—This verb
	applies to <i>emotional</i> agitation; as "shaken" to
	<i>intellectual.</i>
</p>
<p><b>by spirit</b>—by a <i>person
	professing</i> to have the <i>spirit</i> of prophecy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:8-10">1 Corinthians 12:8-10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:1-3">1 John 4:1-3</span>). The
	Thessalonians had been warned (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:20">1 Thessalonians 5:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:21">1 Thessalonians 5:21</span>) to "prove"
	such professed prophesyings, and to "hold fast (only) that which
	is good." 
	</p>
<p><b>by word</b>—<i>of mouth</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:5">2 Thessalonians 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15">2 Thessalonians 2:15</span>);
	some word or saying alleged to be that of Paul, orally communicated.
	If oral tradition was liable to such perversion in the apostolic age
	(compare a similar instance, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15- :">2 Thessalonians 2:15- :</span>), how much more in our age! 
	</p>
<p><b>by letter as from
	us</b>—purporting to be from us, whereas it is a forgery. Hence he
	gives a test by which to know his genuine letters (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15- :">2 Thessalonians 2:15- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>day of Christ</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "day of <i>the Lord.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>is at hand</b>—rather, "is
	<i>immediately imminent,</i>" literally, "is <i>present</i>";
	"is <i>instantly</i> coming." Christ and His apostles
	always taught that the day of the Lord's coming <i>is at hand;</i>
	and it is not likely that Paul would imply anything contrary here;
	what he denies is, that it is so <i>immediately imminent, instant,</i>
	or <i>present,</i> as to justify the neglect of everyday worldly
	duties. CHRYSOSTOM, and
	after him ALFORD,
	translates, "is (already) present" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15- :">2 Thessalonians 2:15- :</span>), a kindred error. But in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:15- :">2 Thessalonians 2:15- :</span>, the same <i>Greek</i> verb is translated "come."
	WAHL supports this view.
	The <i>Greek</i> is usually used of actual presence; but is quite
	susceptible of the translation, "is all but present."</p>
