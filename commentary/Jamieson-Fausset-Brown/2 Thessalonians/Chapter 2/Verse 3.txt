<p><b>3. by any means</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in any manner." Christ, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, gives the same warning in connection with the same event.
	He had indicated three ways (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) in which they might be deceived (compare other ways, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:9">2 Thessalonians 2:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:5">Matthew 24:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>).

<p><b>a falling away</b>—rather
	as the <i>Greek,</i> "<i>the</i> falling away," or
	"apostasy," namely, <i>the</i> one of which "I told
	you" before (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:5">2 Thessalonians 2:5</span>),
	"when I was yet with you," and of which the Lord gave some
	intimation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:10-12">Matthew 24:10-12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:43">John 5:43</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that man of sin be
	revealed</b>—The <i>Greek</i> order is, "And there have been
	revealed the man of sin." As Christ was first in <i>mystery,</i>
	and afterwards <i>revealed</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:43- :">John 5:43- :</span>), so Antichrist (the term used <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:18">1 John 2:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span>) is first in mystery, and
	afterwards shall be developed and revealed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3- :">1 John 4:3- :</span>). As righteousness found its embodiment in Christ, "the
	Lord our righteousness," so "sin" shall have its
	embodiment in "the man of sin." <i>The hindering</i> power
	meanwhile restrains its manifestation; when that shall be removed,
	then this manifestation shall take place. The articles, "<i>the</i>
	apostasy," and "<i>the</i> man of sin," may also refer
	to their being <i>well known as foretold</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:8">Daniel 7:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25">Daniel 7:25</span>, "the little horn
	speaking great words against the Most High, and thinking to change
	times and laws"; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25- :">Daniel 7:25- :</span>, the wilful king who "shall exalt and magnify himself
	above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of
	gods; neither shall he regard any god."

<p><b>the son of perdition</b>—a
	title applied besides to Judas (the traitor, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25- :">Daniel 7:25- :</span>), and to none else. Antichrist (the second "beast"
	coming up out of the earth); therefore he shall at first be "like
	a lamb, while he speaks as a dragon" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:25- :">Daniel 7:25- :</span>); "coming in peaceably and by flatteries,"
	"working deceitfully," but "his heart shall be against
	the holy covenant" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:21">Daniel 11:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:23">Daniel 11:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:28">Daniel 11:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:30">Daniel 11:30</span>). Seeds of "the
	falling away" soon appear (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:30- :">Daniel 11:30- :</span>), but the full development and concentration of these
	anti-Christian elements in one person are still to appear. Contrast
	the King of Zion's coming as JESUS:
	(1) righteous or <i>just;</i> (2) having <i>salvation;</i> (3) <i>lowly;</i>
	whereas Antichrist is: (1) "the man of (the embodiment of) <i>sin;</i>
	(2) the son of <i>perdition;</i> (3) <i>exalting himself</i> above
	all that is worshipped. He is <i>the son of perdition,</i> as
	consigning many to it, and finally doomed to it himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:11">Revelation 17:11</span>). "He whose
	essence and inheritance is perdition" [ALFORD].
	As "the <i>kingdom</i> of heaven" is first brought before
	us in the abstract, then in the concrete, the <i>King,</i> the Lord
	Jesus; so here, first we have (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:11- :">Revelation 17:11- :</span>) "the mystery of <i>iniquity,</i>" then "the
	<i>iniquitous one</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:11- :">Revelation 17:11- :</span>). Doubtless "the apostasy" of <i>Romanism</i> (the
	abstract) is one of the greatest instances of the working of <i>the
	mystery of iniquity,</i> and its blasphemous claims for the Pope (the
	concrete) are forerunners of the final concentration of blasphemy in
	<i>the man of sin,</i> who shall not merely, as the Pope, usurp God's
	honor as <i>vicegerent</i> of God, but <i>oppose</i> God openly at
	last.</p>
