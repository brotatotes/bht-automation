<p><b>7. the mystery of iniquity</b>—the
	counterwork to "the mystery of godliness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Anti-Christianity <i>latently</i> working, as
	distinguished from its final <i>open</i> manifestation. "Mystery"
	in Scripture means, not what remains always a secret, but that which
	is for a while hidden, but in due time manifested (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:4">Ephesians 3:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5">Ephesians 3:5</span>). Satan will resort to a
	mode of opposition more conformed to the then imminent "appearing"
	and "presence" of the Saviour, and will anticipate Him with
	a last effort to maintain the dominion of the world [DE
	BURGH], just as at His
	first advent he rushed into open opposition, by taking possession of
	the bodies of men. "Iniquity," <i>Greek,</i> "<i>lawlessness</i>";
	defiant rejection of God's <i>law</i> (compare <i>Note,</i> see on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5- :">Ephesians 3:5- :</span>, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5- :">Ephesians 3:5- :</span>). "<i>Wickedness</i>" (translated by the
	<i>Septuagint</i> by the same <i>Greek,</i> meaning "lawlessness,"
	which Paul employs here), embodied there as a woman, answers to "the
	mystery of iniquity," here embodied finally in "the man of
	sin": as the former was ultimately banished for ever from the
	Holy Land to her own congenial soil, Babylon, so iniquity and the man
	of sin shall fall before Michael and the Lord Himself, who shall
	appear as the Deliverer of His people (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1-3">Daniel 12:1-3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:3-9">Zechariah 14:3-9</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:3-38.14.9- :">Zechariah 14:3-38.14.9- :</span>. The Jewish nation dispossessed of the evil spirit, the
	demon of idolatry being cast out through the Babylonian captivity,
	receives ultimately a worse form of the evil spirit, Christ-opposing
	self-righteousness. Also, the Christian Church in course of time
	taken possession of by the demon of Romish idolatry, then
	dispossessed of it by the Reformation, then its house "garnished"
	by hypocrisy, secularity, and rationalism, but "swept empty"
	of living faith, then finally apostatizing and repossessed by "the
	man of sin," and <i>outwardly</i> destroyed for a brief time
	(though even then Christ shall have witnesses for Him among both the
	Jews, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:9">Zechariah 13:9</span>, and Gentiles,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:20">Matthew 28:20</span>), when Christ shall
	suddenly come (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:32-45">Daniel 11:32-45</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:7">Luke 18:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:8">Luke 18:8</span>).

<p><b>already</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:9">2 John 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:10">2 John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18-23">Colossians 2:18-23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>); compare "even now

	as distinguished from "in his own time" of being revealed
	<i>hereafter.</i> Antiquity, it appears from hence, is not a
	justification for unscriptural usages or dogmas, since these were
	"already," even in Paul's time, beginning to spring up: the
	written word is the only sure test. "Judaism infecting
	Christianity is the fuel; the mystery of iniquity is the spark."
	"It is one and the same impurity diffusing itself over many
	ages" [BENGEL].

<p><b>only he who now letteth </b><i><b>will
	let</b></i><b> </b>—The italicized words are not in the <i>Greek.</i>
	Therefore, translate rather, "only (that is, the continuance of
	<i>the</i> MYSTERY <i>of
	iniquity-working</i> will be <i>only</i>) until he who now
	<i>withholdeth</i> (the same <i>Greek</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3- :">1 John 4:3- :</span>) be taken out of the way." "Only (<i>waiting,</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:13">Hebrews 10:13</span>) until he," &amp;c.
	Then it will work no longer in <i>mystery,</i> but in open
	manifestation.</p>
