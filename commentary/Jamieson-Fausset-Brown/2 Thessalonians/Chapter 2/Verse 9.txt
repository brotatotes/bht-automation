9. whose coming—The same Greek
	as was used for the Lord's coming ( :-) or personal "presence." 
	is—in its essential
	character. 
	after—according to
	the working ("energy") of Satan, as opposed to the energy
	or working of the Holy Spirit in the Church (see on  :-). As Christ is related to God, so is Antichrist to Satan,
	his visible embodiment and manifestation: Satan works through him.  :-, "The dragon gave him (the beast) his power . . . seat
	. . . great authority." 
	lying wonders—literally,
	"wonders" or "prodigies of falsehood." His
	"power, signs, and wonders," all have falsehood for
	their base, essence, and aim ( :-), [ALFORD]. In  :- Jesus implies that the miracles shall be real, though
	demoniac, such mysterious effects of the powers of darkness as we
	read of in the case of the Egyptian sorcerers, not such as Jesus
	performed in their character, power, or aim; for they are against the
	revealed Word, and therefore not to be accepted as evidences of
	truth; nay, on the authority of that sure Word of prophecy (here, and
	Matthew 24:24), to be known and
	rejected as wrought in support of falsehood (Deuteronomy 13:1-3;
	Deuteronomy 13:5; Galatians 1:8;
	Galatians 1:9; Revelation 13:11-15;
	Revelation 19:20). The same three Greek
	words occur for miracles of Jesus (Acts 2:22;
	Hebrews 2:4); showing that as the
	Egyptian magicians imitated Moses (Hebrews 2:4- :), so Antichrist will try to imitate Christ's works as a
	"sign," or proof of divinity.
