<p><b>9. whose coming</b>—The same <i>Greek</i>
	as was used for <i>the</i> Lord's coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) or personal "presence." 
	</p>
<p><b>is</b>—in its essential

<p><b>after</b>—<i>according to</i>
	the working ("energy") of Satan, as opposed to the <i>energy</i>
	or <i>working</i> of the Holy Spirit in the Church (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). As Christ is related to God, so is Antichrist to Satan,
	his visible embodiment and manifestation: Satan works through him. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "The dragon gave him (the beast) his power . . . seat

<p><b>lying wonders</b>—literally,
	"wonders" or "prodigies of falsehood." His
	"power, signs, and wonders," all have <i>falsehood</i> for
	their base, essence, and aim (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), [ALFORD]. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> Jesus implies that the miracles shall be real, though
	demoniac, such mysterious effects of the powers of darkness as we
	read of in the case of the Egyptian sorcerers, not such as Jesus
	performed in their character, power, or aim; for they are against the
	revealed Word, and therefore not to be accepted as evidences of
	truth; nay, on the authority of that sure Word of prophecy (here, and
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>), to be known and
	rejected as wrought in support of <i>falsehood</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+13:1-3">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+13:5">Deuteronomy 13:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>). The same three <i>Greek</i>
	words occur for <i>miracles of Jesus</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span>); showing that as the
	Egyptian magicians imitated Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:4- :">Hebrews 2:4- :</span>), so Antichrist will try to imitate Christ's works as a
	"sign," or <i>proof</i> of divinity.</p>
