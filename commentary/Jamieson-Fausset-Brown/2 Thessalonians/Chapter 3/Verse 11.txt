<p><b>11. busy bodies</b>â€”In the <i>Greek</i>
	the similarity of sound marks the antithesis, "Doing none of
	their own business, yet overdoing in the business of others."
	Busy about everyone's business but their own. "Nature abhors a
	vacuum"; so if not doing one's own business, one is apt to
	meddle with his neighbor's business. Idleness is the parent of
	busybodies (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:13">1 Timothy 5:13</span>). Contrast
