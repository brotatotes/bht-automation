<p><b>13. be not weary</b>â€”The oldest
	manuscripts read, "Be not cowardly in"; do not be wanting
	in strenuousness in doing well. EDMUNDS
	explains it: Do not <i>culpably</i> neglect to do well, namely, with
	patient industry do your duty in your several callings. In contrast
	to the "disorderly, not-working busybodies" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:9">Galatians 6:9</span>).</p>
