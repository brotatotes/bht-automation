16. Lord of peace—Jesus
	Christ. The same title is given to Him as to the Father, "the
	GOD of peace"
	(Romans 15:33; Romans 16:20;
	2 Corinthians 13:11). An appropriate title
	in the prayer here, where the harmony of the Christian community was
	liable to interruption from the "disorderly." The Greek
	article requires the translation, "Give you the peace"
	which it is "His to give." "Peace" outward and
	inward, here and hereafter (2 Corinthians 13:11- :). 
	always—unbroken, not
	changing with outward circumstances. 
	by all means—Greek,
	"in every way." Most of the oldest manuscripts read, "in
	every place"; thus he prays for their peace in all
	times ("always") and places.
Lord be with you all—May
	He bless you not only with peace, but also with His presence
	(Matthew 28:20). Even the
	disorderly brethren (compare Matthew 28:20- :, "a brother") are included in this prayer.
