<p><b>16. Lord of peace</b>—Jesus
	Christ. The same title is given to Him as to the Father, "the
	GOD of peace"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:33">Romans 15:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11">2 Corinthians 13:11</span>). An appropriate title
	in the prayer here, where the harmony of the Christian community was
	liable to interruption from the "disorderly." The <i>Greek</i>
	article requires the translation, "Give you <i>the</i> peace"
	which it is "His to give." "Peace" outward and
	inward, here and hereafter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:11- :">2 Corinthians 13:11- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>always</b>—unbroken, not
	changing with outward circumstances. 
	</p>
<p><b>by all means</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in every way." Most of the oldest manuscripts read, "in
	every <i>place</i>"; thus he prays for their peace <i>in all
	times</i> ("always") <i>and places.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Lord be with you all</b>—May
	He bless you not only with <i>peace,</i> but also with His <i>presence</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:20">Matthew 28:20</span>). Even the
	disorderly brethren (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:20- :">Matthew 28:20- :</span>, "a brother") are included in this prayer.</p>
