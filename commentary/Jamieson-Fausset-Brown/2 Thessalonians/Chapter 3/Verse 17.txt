<p><b>17.</b> The Epistle was written by
	an amanuensis (perhaps Silas or Timothy), and only the closing
	salutation written by Paul's "own hand" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:22">Romans 16:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</span>).
	Wherever Paul does not subjoin this autograph salutation, we may
	presume he wrote the whole Epistle himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18- :">Colossians 4:18- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>which</b>—<i>which</i>
	autograph salutation. 
	</p>
<p><b>the token</b>—to
	distinguish genuine Epistles from spurious ones put forth in my name
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:2">2 Thessalonians 2:2</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in every epistle</b>—Some
	think he signed his name to every Epistle with his own hand; but as
	there is no trace of this in any manuscripts of <i>all</i> the
	Epistles, it is more likely that he alludes to <i>his writing with
	his own hand in closing every Epistle,</i> even in those Epistles
	(Romans, Second Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, First
	Thessalonians) wherein he does not specify his having done so. 
	</p>
<p><b>so I write</b>—so I sign my
	name: this is a specimen of my <i>handwriting,</i> by which to
	distinguish my geniune letters from forgeries.</p>
