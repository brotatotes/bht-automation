2. that we . . . be delivered from
	unreasonable . . . men—literally, men out of place, inept,
	unseemly: out of the way bad: more than ordinarily bad. An
	undesigned coincidence with  :-. Paul was now at Corinth, where the JEWS
	"opposed themselves" to his preaching: in answer to his
	prayers and those of his converts at Thessalonica and elsewhere, "the
	Lord, in vision," assured him of exemption from "the hurt,"
	and of success in bringing in "much people." On the
	unreasonable, out-of-the way perversity of the Jews, as known to the
	Thessalonians, see 1 Thessalonians 2:15;
	1 Thessalonians 2:16. 
	have not faith—or as
	Greek, "the faith" of the Christian: the only
	antidote to what is "unreasonable and wicked." The
	Thessalonians, from their ready acceptance of the Gospel (1 Thessalonians 1:5;
	1 Thessalonians 1:6), might think "all"
	would similarly receive it; but the Jews were far from having such a
	readiness to believe the truth.
