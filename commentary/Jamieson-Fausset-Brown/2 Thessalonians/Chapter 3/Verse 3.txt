<p><b>3. faithful</b>—alluding to
	"faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:2">2 Thessalonians 3:2</span>):
	though many will not believe, the Lord (other very old manuscripts
	read "God") is still to be believed in as faithful to His
	promises (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:24">1 Thessalonians 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:13">2 Timothy 2:13</span>).
	<i>Faith</i> on the part of man answers to faithfulness on the part
	of God.

<p><b>stablish you</b>—as he had
	prayed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:17">2 Thessalonians 2:17</span>). Though it
	was on himself that wicked men were making their onset, he turns away
	from asking the Thessalonians' prayers for HIS
	deliverance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:2">2 Thessalonians 3:2</span>: so
	unselfish was he, even in religion), to express his assurance of
	THEIR establishment in the
	faith, and preservation from evil. This assurance thus exactly
	answers to his prayer for them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:2- :">2 Thessalonians 3:2- :</span>), "Our Lord . . . <i>stablish</i> you in every good
	word and work." He has before his mind the Lord's Prayer, "Lead
	us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil"; where, as
	here, the translation may be, "from the evil one"; the
	great hinderer of "every good word and work." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:2- :">2 Thessalonians 3:2- :</span>, "the wicked one."</p>
