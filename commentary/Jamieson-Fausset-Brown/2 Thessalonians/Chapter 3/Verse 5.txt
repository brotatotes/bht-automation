<p><b>5.</b> If "the Lord" be
	here the Holy Ghost (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:17">2 Corinthians 3:17</span>),
	the three Persons of the Trinity will occur in this verse. 
	</p>
<p><b>love of God</b>—love to
	God. 
	</p>
<p><b>patient waiting for
	Christ</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i> "the patience (endurance)
	of Christ," namely, which Christ showed [ALFORD]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>).
	ESTIUS, however, supports
	<i>English Version</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:9">Revelation 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10">Revelation 3:10</span>). At all events, this
	grace, "patience," or <i>persevering endurance,</i> is
	connected with the "hope" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</span>) of <i>Christ's coming.</i>
	In ALFORD'S translation we
	may compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>,
	"Run with <i>patience</i> (<i>endurance</i>) . . . looking to
	JESUS . . . who, for the
	joy that was before Him, <i>endured</i> the cross"; so WE
	are to endure, as looking for the hope to be realized at His coming
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:36">Hebrews 10:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:37">Hebrews 10:37</span>).</p>
