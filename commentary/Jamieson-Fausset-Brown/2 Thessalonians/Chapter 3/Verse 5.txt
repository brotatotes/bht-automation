5. If "the Lord" be
	here the Holy Ghost (2 Corinthians 3:17),
	the three Persons of the Trinity will occur in this verse. 
	love of God—love to
	God. 
	patient waiting for
	Christ—rather as Greek, "the patience (endurance)
	of Christ," namely, which Christ showed [ALFORD]
	(2 Thessalonians 2:4; 1 Thessalonians 1:3).
	ESTIUS, however, supports
	English Version (compare Revelation 1:9;
	Revelation 3:10). At all events, this
	grace, "patience," or persevering endurance, is
	connected with the "hope" (1 Thessalonians 1:3;
	1 Thessalonians 1:10) of Christ's coming.
	In ALFORD'S translation we
	may compare Hebrews 12:1; Hebrews 12:2,
	"Run with patience (endurance) . . . looking to
	JESUS . . . who, for the
	joy that was before Him, endured the cross"; so WE
	are to endure, as looking for the hope to be realized at His coming
	(Hebrews 10:36; Hebrews 10:37).
