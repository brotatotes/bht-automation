<p><b>6. we command you</b>—Hereby he
	puts to a particular test their obedience in general to his <i>commands,</i>
	which obedience he had recognized in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>withdraw</b>—literally, "to
	furl the sails"; as we say, <i>to steer clear of</i> (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:14">2 Thessalonians 3:14</span>). Some had given up
	labor as though the Lord's day was immediately coming. He had
	enjoined mild censure of such in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:14- :">2 Thessalonians 3:14- :</span>, "<i>Warn</i> . . . the unruly"; but now that the
	mischief had become more confirmed, he enjoins stricter discipline,
	namely, withdrawal from their company (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:11">1 Corinthians 5:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:10">2 John 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:11">2 John 1:11</span>):
	not a formal sentence of excommunication, such as was subsequently
	passed on more heinous offenders (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>). He says "brother,"
	that is, professing Christian; for in the case of unprofessing
	heathen, believers needed not be so strict (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20- :">1 Timothy 1:20- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>disorderly</b>—Paul plainly
	would not have sanctioned the <i>order</i> of Mendicant Friars, who
	reduce such a "disorderly" and lazy life to a system. Call
	it not an <i>order,</i> but a <i>burden</i> to the community (BENGEL,
	alluding to the <i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20- :">1 Timothy 1:20- :</span>, for "be chargeable," literally, "be a
	burden"). 
	</p>
<p><b>the tradition</b>—the oral
	instruction which he had given to them when present (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:20- :">1 Timothy 1:20- :</span>), and subsequently committed to writing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:12">1 Thessalonians 4:12</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>which he received of us</b>—Some
	oldest manuscripts read, "<i>ye</i> received"; others,
	"<i>they</i> received." The <i>English Version</i> reading
	has no very old authority.</p>
