6. we command you—Hereby he
	puts to a particular test their obedience in general to his commands,
	which obedience he had recognized in  :-. 
	withdraw—literally, "to
	furl the sails"; as we say, to steer clear of (compare
	2 Thessalonians 3:14). Some had given up
	labor as though the Lord's day was immediately coming. He had
	enjoined mild censure of such in 2 Thessalonians 3:14- :, "Warn . . . the unruly"; but now that the
	mischief had become more confirmed, he enjoins stricter discipline,
	namely, withdrawal from their company (compare 1 Corinthians 5:11;
	2 John 1:10; 2 John 1:11):
	not a formal sentence of excommunication, such as was subsequently
	passed on more heinous offenders (as in 1 Corinthians 5:5;
	1 Timothy 1:20). He says "brother,"
	that is, professing Christian; for in the case of unprofessing
	heathen, believers needed not be so strict (1 Timothy 1:20- :). 
	disorderly—Paul plainly
	would not have sanctioned the order of Mendicant Friars, who
	reduce such a "disorderly" and lazy life to a system. Call
	it not an order, but a burden to the community (BENGEL,
	alluding to the Greek, 1 Timothy 1:20- :, for "be chargeable," literally, "be a
	burden"). 
	the tradition—the oral
	instruction which he had given to them when present (1 Timothy 1:20- :), and subsequently committed to writing (1 Thessalonians 4:11;
	1 Thessalonians 4:12). 
	which he received of us—Some
	oldest manuscripts read, "ye received"; others,
	"they received." The English Version reading
	has no very old authority.
