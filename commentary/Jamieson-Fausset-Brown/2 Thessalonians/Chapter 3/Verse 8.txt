<p><b>wrought</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:12- :">2 Thessalonians 3:12- :</span>). In both Epistles they state they maintained themselves by
	labor; but in this second Epistle they do so in order to offer
	themselves herein as an example to the idle; whereas, in the first,
	their object in doing so is to vindicate themselves from all
	imputation of mercenary motives in preaching the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:5">1 Thessalonians 2:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</span>) [EDMUNDS].
	They preached gratuitously though they might have claimed maintenance
	from their converts.

<p><b>chargeable</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"a burden," or "burdensome." The Philippians did
	not regard it as a <i>burden</i> to contribute to his support
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:15">Philippians 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:16">Philippians 4:16</span>),
	sending to him while he was in this very Thessalonica (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:15">Acts 16:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:34">Acts 16:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:40">Acts 16:40</span>).
	Many Thessalonians, doubtless, would have felt it a privilege to
	contribute, but as he saw some idlers among them who would have made
	a pretext of his example to justify themselves, he waived his right.
	His reason for the same course at Corinth was to mark how different
	were his aims from those of the false teachers who sought their own
	lucre (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:9">2 Corinthians 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:12">2 Corinthians 11:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13">2 Corinthians 11:13</span>). It is at the very
	time and place of writing these Epistles that Paul is expressly said
	to have <i>wrought at tent-making</i> with Aquila (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:13- :">2 Corinthians 11:13- :</span>); an undesigned coincidence.</p>
