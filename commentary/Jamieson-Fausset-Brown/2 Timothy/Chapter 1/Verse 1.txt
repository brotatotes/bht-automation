<p><b>1.</b> This Epistle is the last
	testament and swan-like death song of Paul [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>according to the promise of
	life . . . in Christ</b>â€”Paul's <i>apostleship</i> is <i>in order
	to carry into effect</i> this promise. Compare "according to the
	faith . . . in hope of eternal life . . . promise," c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:1">Titus 1:1</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:2">Titus 1:2</span>). This "promise of
	life in Christ" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:8">2 Timothy 2:8</span>) was needed to nerve
	Timothy to fortitude amidst trials, and to boldness in undertaking
	the journey to Rome, which would be attended with much risk (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:8- :">2 Timothy 2:8- :</span>).</p>
