<p><b>abolished death</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"taken away <i>the power</i> from death" [TITTMANN].
	The <i>Greek</i> article before "death" implies that Christ
	abolished death, not only in some particular instance, but in its
	very essence, being, and idea, as well as in all its aspects and
	consequences (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:26">John 11:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:2">Romans 8:2</span>;

	The carrying out of the abolition of death into full effect is to be
	at the resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>).
	The death of the body meanwhile is but temporary, and is made no
	account of by Christ and the apostles. 
	</p>
<p><b>brought . . . to light</b>—making
	visible by the Gospel what was before hidden in God's purpose. 
	</p>
<p><b>life</b>—of the Spirit,
	acting first on the soul here, about to act on the body also at the
	resurrection. 
	</p>
<p><b>immortality</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"incorruptibility" of the new life, not merely of the risen
	body [ALFORD], (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14- :">Revelation 20:14- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>through</b>—<i>by means of
	the Gospel,</i> which <i>brings to light the life and immortality</i>
	purposed by God from eternity, but manifested now first to man by
	Christ, who in His own resurrection has given the pledge of His
	people's final triumph over death through Him. Before the Gospel
	revelation from God, man, by the light of nature, under the most
	favorable circumstances, had but a glimmering idea of the possibility
	of a future being of <i>the soul,</i> but not the faintest idea of
	the resurrection of <i>the body</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:18">Acts 17:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:32">Acts 17:32</span>). If Christ were not
	"the life," the dead could never live; if He were not the
	resurrection, they could never rise; had He not the keys of hell and
	death (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>), we could never
	break through the bars of death or gates of hell [BISHOP
	PEARSON].</p>
