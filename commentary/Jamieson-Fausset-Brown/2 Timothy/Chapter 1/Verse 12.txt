<p><b>I also suffer</b>—besides
	my <i>active</i> work as a missionary. ELLICOTT
	translates, "I suffer even these things"; the sufferings
	attendant on my being a prisoner (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:8">2 Timothy 1:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:15">2 Timothy 1:15</span>).

	<i>faithful,</i> promise-keeping God He is (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:25- :">John 17:25- :</span>). It is not, I know <i>how</i> I have believed, but, I know
	WHOM I have believed; a

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:19">1 Peter 4:19</span>). So Christ Himself in

	deposits with us His word; we deposit with God our spirit"
	[GROTIUS]. There is one
	deposit (His revelation) committed by God to us, which we ought to
	keep (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:13">2 Timothy 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:14">2 Timothy 1:14</span>)
	and transmit to others (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:2">2 Timothy 2:2</span>);
	there is another committed by God to us, which we should commit to
	His keeping, namely, ourselves and our heavenly portion.
