12. For the which cause—For
	the Gospel cause of which I was appointed a preacher (2 Timothy 1:10;
	2 Timothy 1:11). 
	I also suffer—besides
	my active work as a missionary. ELLICOTT
	translates, "I suffer even these things"; the sufferings
	attendant on my being a prisoner (2 Timothy 1:8;
	2 Timothy 1:15). 
	I am not ashamed—neither
	be thou (2 Timothy 1:8). 
	for—Confidence as to
	the future drives away shame [BENGEL].
	I know—though the world
	knows Him not (John 10:14;
	John 17:25). 
	whom—I know what a
	faithful, promise-keeping God He is (John 17:25- :). It is not, I know how I have believed, but, I know
	WHOM I have believed; a
	feeble faith may clasp a strong Saviour. 
	believed—rather,
	"trusted"; carrying out the metaphor of a depositor
	depositing his pledge with one whom he trusts.
am persuaded— (John 17:25- :). 
	he is able—in spite of
	so many foes around me. 
	that which I have committed
	unto him—Greek, "my deposit"; the body, soul,
	and spirit, which I have deposited in God's safe keeping (1 Thessalonians 5:23;
	1 Peter 4:19). So Christ Himself in
	dying (Luke 23:46). "God
	deposits with us His word; we deposit with God our spirit"
	[GROTIUS]. There is one
	deposit (His revelation) committed by God to us, which we ought to
	keep (2 Timothy 1:13; 2 Timothy 1:14)
	and transmit to others (2 Timothy 2:2);
	there is another committed by God to us, which we should commit to
	His keeping, namely, ourselves and our heavenly portion. 
	that day—the day of His
	appearing (2 Timothy 1:18; 2 Timothy 4:8).
