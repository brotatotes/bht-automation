	as <i>Greek,</i> "<i>Have</i> (that is, keep) a <i>pattern</i>
	of sound (<i>Greek,</i> 'healthy') words which thou hast heard from
	me, in faith and love." "Keep" suits the reference to
	a <i>deposit</i> in the context. The secondary position of the verb
	in the <i>Greek</i> forbids our taking it so strongly as <i>English
	Version,</i> "Hold fast." The <i>Greek</i> for "form"

	drawn from my <i>sound</i> words, in opposition to the <i>unsound</i>
	doctrines so current at Ephesus, <i>vividly impressed</i> (WAHL
	translates it "delineation"; the verb implies "to make
	<i>a lively and lasting impress</i>") on thy mind.
