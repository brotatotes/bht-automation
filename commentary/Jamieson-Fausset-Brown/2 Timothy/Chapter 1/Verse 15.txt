	they were in Rome (not 'be' or 'are,' but) turned
	from me" then; were "ashamed of my chain," in contrast
	to ONESIPHORUS; did not

	Hermogenes—specified perhaps, as being persons from whom such
	pusillanimous conduct could least be expected; or, as being well
	known to Timothy, and spoken of before in conversations between him
	and Paul, when the latter was in Asia Minor.
