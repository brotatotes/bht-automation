<p><b>15. all they which are in
	Asia</b>—Proconsular Asia; "all who are there <i>now, when
	they were in Rome</i> (not '<i>be</i>' or '<i>are,</i>' but) turned
	from me" then; were "ashamed of my chain," in contrast
	to ONESIPHORUS; did not
	stand with me but forsook me (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). It is possible that the occasion of their turning from him
	was at his apprehension in Nicopolis, whither they had escorted him
	on his way to Rome, but from which they turned back to Asia. A hint
	to Timothy, now in Asia, not to be like them, but to imitate rather
	ONESIPHORUS, and to come
	to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:21">2 Timothy 4:21</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Phygellus and
	Hermogenes</b>—specified perhaps, as being persons from whom such
	pusillanimous conduct could least be expected; or, as being well
	known to Timothy, and spoken of before in conversations between him
	and Paul, when the latter was in Asia Minor.</p>
