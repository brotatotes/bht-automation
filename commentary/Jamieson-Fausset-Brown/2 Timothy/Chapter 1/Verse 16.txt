<p><b>16. The Lord give mercy</b>—even
	as ONESIPHORUS had
	abounded in works of <i>mercy.</i>
</p>
<p><b>the house of Onesiphorus</b>—He
	himself was then absent from Ephesus, which accounts for the form of
	expression (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:19">2 Timothy 4:19</span>). His
	<i>household</i> would hardly retain his name after the master was
	dead, as BENGEL supposes
	him to have been. Nowhere has Paul prayers for the dead, which is
	fatal to the theory, favored by ALFORD
	also, that he was dead. God blesses not only the righteous man
	himself, but all his household.

<p><b>my chain</b>—Paul in the
	second, as in his first imprisonment, was bound by a chain to the
	soldier who guarded him.</p>
