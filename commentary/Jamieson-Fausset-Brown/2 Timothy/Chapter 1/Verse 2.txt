<p><b>2. my dearly beloved son</b>â€”In
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4">Titus 1:4</span>,
	written at an earlier period than this Epistle, the expression used
	is in the <i>Greek,</i> "my <i>genuine</i> son." ALFORD
	sees in the change of expression an intimation of an altered tone as
	to Timothy, more of mere love, and less of confidence, as though Paul
	saw m him a want of firmness, whence arose the need of his <i>stirring
	up</i> afresh the faith and grace in Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:4- :">Titus 1:4- :</span>). But this seems to me not justified by the <i>Greek</i> word
	<i>agapetos,</i> which implies the attachment of <i>reasoning</i> and
	<i>choice,</i> on the ground of <i>merit</i> in the one "beloved,"
	not of merely <i>instinctive</i> love. See TRENCH
	[<i>Greek Synonyms of the New Testament</i>].</p>
