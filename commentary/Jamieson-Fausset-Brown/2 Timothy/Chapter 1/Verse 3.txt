<p><b>3. I thank</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "I
	<i>feel gratitude</i> to God." 
	</p>
<p><b>whom I serve from my
	forefathers</b>—<i>whom I serve</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) <i>as did my forefathers.</i> He does not mean to put on the
	same footing the Jewish and Christian service of God; but simply to
	assert his own conscientious service of God as he had received it
	from his <i>progenitors</i> (not Abraham, Isaac, c., whom he calls
	"the fathers," not "progenitors" as the <i>Greek</i>
	is here <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>). The memory of
	those who had gone before to whom he is about to be gathered, is now,
	on the eve of death, pleasant to him; hence also, he calls to mind
	the faith of the mother and grandmother of Timothy; as he walks in
	the faith of his forefathers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:1">Acts 23:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:6">Acts 26:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:7">Acts 26:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:20">Acts 28:20</span>),
	so Timothy should persevere firmly in the faith of his parent and
	grandparent. Not only Paul, but the Jews who reject Christ, forsake
	the faith of their forefathers, who looked for Christ; when they
	accept Him, the hearts of the children shall only be returning to the
	faith of their forefathers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:6">Malachi 4:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:17">Luke 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:23">Romans 11:23</span>;

	Probably Paul had, in his recent defense, dwelt on this topic,
	namely, that he was, in being a Christian, only following his
	<i>hereditary faith.</i>

<p><b>that . . . I have remembrance
	of thee</b>—"<i>how</i> unceasing I <i>make my mention</i>
	concerning thee" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:28- :">Romans 11:28- :</span>). The cause of Paul's feeling thankful is, not that he
	remembers Timothy unceasingly in his prayers, but for what Timothy is
	in faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>) and graces;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:8">Romans 1:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:9">Romans 1:9</span>,
	from which supply the elliptical sentence thus, "I thank God
	(for thee, for God is my witness) whom I serve . . . that (or <i>how</i>)
	without ceasing I have remembrance (or <i>make mention</i>) of thee,"
	&amp;c.
