<p><b>4. desiring</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"with <i>yearning</i> as for one much <i>missed.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>mindful of thy tears</b>—not
	only at our parting (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:37">Acts 20:37</span>),
	but also often when under pious feelings. 
	</p>
<p><b>that I may be filled with
	joy</b>—to be joined with "desiring to see thee" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:11">Romans 1:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:12">Romans 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:32">Romans 15:32</span>).</p>
