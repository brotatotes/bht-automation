<p><b>5. When I call to remembrance</b>—This
	increased his "desire to see" Timothy. The oldest
	manuscripts read, "When I <i>called</i> to remembrance";
	implying that some recent incident (perhaps the contrasted cowardice
	of the hypocrite Demas, who forsook him) had reminded him of the
	sincerity of Timothy's faith. 
	</p>
<p><b>faith that is in thee</b>—ALFORD
	translates, "that <i>was</i> in thee." He remembers
	Timothy's faith in the <i>past</i> as a fact; its <i>present</i>
	existence in him is only matter of his confident <i>persuasion</i> or
	hope. 
	</p>
<p><b>which</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"such as." 
	</p>
<p><b>dwelt</b>—"made its
	dwelling" or abode (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The past tense implies they were now dead. 
	</p>
<p><b>first</b>—before it dwelt
	in thee. She was the furthest back of the progenitors of Timothy whom
	Paul knew. 
	</p>
<p><b>mother Eunice</b>—a
	believing Jewess; but his father was a Greek, that is, a heathen (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The faith of the one parent sanctified the child (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:14">1 Corinthians 7:14</span>). She was probably
	converted at Paul's first visit to Lystra (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:14- :">1 Corinthians 7:14- :</span>). It is an undesigned coincidence, and so a mark of truth,
	that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span> the belief of
	the mother <i>alone</i> is mentioned, just as here praise is bestowed
	on the faith of the mother, while no notice is taken of the father
	[PALEY, <i>Horæ Paulinæ</i>].
	</p>
<p><b>and</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"but," that is, notwithstanding appearances [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>persuaded that</b>—<i>it
	dwells,</i> or <i>it shall dwell</i> "in thee also." The
	mention of the faith of his mother and grandmother is designed as an
	incentive to stir up his faith.</p>
