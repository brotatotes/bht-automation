<p><b>6. Wherefore</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"For which cause," namely, because thou hast inherited,
	didst once possess, and I trust ("am persuaded") still dost
	possess, such unfeigned faith [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>stir up</b>—literally,
	"rekindle," "revive the spark of"; the opposite
	of "quench" or "extinguish" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Paul does not doubt the existence of real faith in
	Timothy, but he desires it to be put into active exercise. Timothy
	seems to have become somewhat remiss from being so long without Paul
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22">2 Timothy 2:22</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>gift of God</b>—the
	spiritual grace received for his ministerial office, either at his
	original ordination, or at his consecration to the particular office
	of superintending the Ephesian Church (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22- :">2 Timothy 2:22- :</span>), imparting <i>fearlessness, power, love, and a sound mind</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:7">2 Timothy 1:7</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>by the putting on of my
	hands</b>—In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>, it is
	"with [not <i>by</i>] the laying on of the hands <i>of the
	presbytery.</i>" The apostle was chief in the ordination, and to
	him "BY" is
	applied. The presbytery were his assistants; so "with,"
	implying merely <i>accompaniment,</i> is said of them. Paul was the
	instrument in Timothy's ordination and reception of the grace then
	conferred; the presbyters were the concurrent participants in the act
	of ordination; so the <i>Greek,</i> "<i>dia</i>" and
	"<i>meta.</i>" So in ordinations by a bishop in our days,
	he does the <i>principal</i> act; they join in laying on hands <i>with</i>
	him.</p>
