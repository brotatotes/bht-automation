6. Wherefore—Greek,
	"For which cause," namely, because thou hast inherited,
	didst once possess, and I trust ("am persuaded") still dost
	possess, such unfeigned faith [ALFORD].
	stir up—literally,
	"rekindle," "revive the spark of"; the opposite
	of "quench" or "extinguish" ( :-). Paul does not doubt the existence of real faith in
	Timothy, but he desires it to be put into active exercise. Timothy
	seems to have become somewhat remiss from being so long without Paul
	(2 Timothy 2:22). 
	gift of God—the
	spiritual grace received for his ministerial office, either at his
	original ordination, or at his consecration to the particular office
	of superintending the Ephesian Church (see on 2 Timothy 2:22- :), imparting fearlessness, power, love, and a sound mind
	(2 Timothy 1:7). 
	by the putting on of my
	hands—In 1 Timothy 4:14, it is
	"with [not by] the laying on of the hands of the
	presbytery." The apostle was chief in the ordination, and to
	him "BY" is
	applied. The presbytery were his assistants; so "with,"
	implying merely accompaniment, is said of them. Paul was the
	instrument in Timothy's ordination and reception of the grace then
	conferred; the presbyters were the concurrent participants in the act
	of ordination; so the Greek, "dia" and
	"meta." So in ordinations by a bishop in our days,
	he does the principal act; they join in laying on hands with
	him.
