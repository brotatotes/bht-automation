<p><b>7. For,</b> c.—implying that
	Timothy needed the exhortation "to stir up the gift of God in
	him," being constitutionally "timid": "For God
	<i>did not give</i> us (so the <i>Greek,</i> namely, at our
	ordination or consecration) the spirit of <i>fear.</i>" The
	spirit which He gave us, was not the spirit of timidity (literally,
	"cowardice," which is weakness), but of "power"
	(exhibited in a fearless "testimony" for Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "Power is the invariable accompaniment of the gift of
	<i>the Holy Ghost.</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:49">Luke 24:49</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8">Acts 1:8</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:8- :">Acts 1:8- :</span>, "full of faith and of the <i>Holy Ghost,</i>" with
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:8">2 Timothy 1:8</span>, "full of faith and
	<i>power.</i>" Fear is the result of "the spirit of
	bondage" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>). Fear
	<i>within</i> exaggerates the causes of fear <i>without.</i> "The
	spirit of power" is the spirit of man dwelt in by the Spirit of
	God imparting <i>power;</i> this power "casteth out fear"
	from ourselves, and stimulates us to try to cast it out of others
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:18">1 John 4:18</span>).

<p><b>love</b>—which moves the
	believer while "speaking the truth" with <i>power,</i> when
	giving his testimony for Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:18- :">1 John 4:18- :</span>), at the same time to do so "in love" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:18- :">1 John 4:18- :</span>).

<p><b>a sound mind</b>—The <i>Greek,</i>
	is rather, "the bringing of men to a sound mind" [WAHL].
	BENGEL supports <i>English
	Version,</i> "a sound mind," or "sober-mindedness";
	a duty to which a young man like Timothy especially needed to be
	exhorted (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:22">2 Timothy 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:12">1 Timothy 4:12</span>;

	So Paul urges him, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:4">2 Timothy 2:4</span>,
	to give up worldly entanglements, which as <i>thorns</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:4- :">2 Timothy 2:4- :</span>) choke the word. These three gifts are preferable to any
	miraculous powers whatever.</p>
