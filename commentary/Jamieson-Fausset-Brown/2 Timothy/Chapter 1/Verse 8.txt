<p><b>8. therefore</b>—seeing that God
	hath given us such a spirit, not that of <i>fear.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Be not thou . . . ashamed</b>—I
	agree with ELLICOTT, in
	opposition to ALFORD, that
	the <i>Greek</i> subjunctive here, with the negative, implies action
	<i>completed at one time,</i> not <i>continued action,</i> which the
	present imperative would express; thus implying that Timothy had <i>not</i>
	decidedly <i>yet</i> evinced such feeling of <i>shame;</i> though I
	think, Paul, amidst the desertion of others who once promised fair,
	and from being aware of Timothy's constitutional <i>timidity</i> (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:7">2 Timothy 1:7</span>), felt it necessary
	to stir him up and guard him against the possibility of unchristian
	dereliction of duty as to bold confession of Christ. <i>Shame</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:8">2 Timothy 1:8</span>) is the companion of
	<i>fear</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:7">2 Timothy 1:7</span>); if fear
	be overcome, false shame flees [BENGEL].
	Paul himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>), and
	Onesiphorus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:16">2 Timothy 1:16</span>), were
	instances of fearless profession removing false shame. He presents in
	contrast sad instances of fear and shame (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:16- :">2 Timothy 1:16- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of the testimony of our
	Lord</b>—<i>of the testimony</i> which thou art bound to give in
	the cause <i>of our Lord;</i> he says "our," to connect
	Timothy and himself together in the testimony which both should give
	for their common Lord. <i>The testimony which Christ gave before
	Pilate</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:12">1 Timothy 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:13">1 Timothy 6:13</span>),
	is an incentive to the believer that he should, after His Lord's
	example, <i>witness a good testimony</i> or <i>confession.</i>
</p>
<p><b>nor of me his prisoner</b>—The
	cause of God's servants is the cause of God Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:13- :">1 Timothy 6:13- :</span>). Timothy might easily be tempted to be ashamed of one in
	prison, especially as not only worldly shame, but great risk,
	attended any recognition of Paul the prisoner. 
	</p>
<p><b>be thou partaker</b>—<i>with
	me.</i>
</p>
<p><b>of the gospel</b>—rather,
	as <i>Greek,</i> "<i>for</i> the Gospel," that is, suffered
	<i>for the Gospel</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:3-5">2 Timothy 2:3-5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:13">Philemon 1:13</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>according to the power of
	God</b>—exhibited in having <i>saved</i> and <i>called</i> us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:13- :">Philemon 1:13- :</span>). God who has done the greater act of power (that is, saved
	us), will surely do the less (carry us safe through <i>afflictions</i>
	borne <i>for the Gospel</i>). "Think not that thou hast to bear
	these afflictions by thine own power; nay, it is by the power of God.
	It was a greater exercise of power than His making the heaven, His
	persuading the world to embrace salvation" [CHRYSOSTOM].</p>
