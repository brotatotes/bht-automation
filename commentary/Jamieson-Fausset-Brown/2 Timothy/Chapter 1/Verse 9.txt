9. Who . . . called us—namely,
	God the Father (Galatians 1:6). The
	having "saved us" in His eternal purpose of "grace,
	given us in Christ before the world began," precedes his actual
	"calling" of us in due time with a call made effective to
	us by the Holy Spirit; therefore, "saved us" comes before
	"called us" (Galatians 1:6- :). 
	holy calling—the actual
	call to a life of holiness. Galatians 1:6- :, "heavenly calling" [TITTMANN,
	Greek Synonyms of the New Testament]; whereas we were sinners
	and enemies (Ephesians 1:18;
	Ephesians 4:1). The call comes wholly
	from God and claims us wholly for God. "Holy"
	implies the separation of believers from the rest of the world
	unto God. 
	not according to—not
	having regard to our works in His election and calling of grace
	(Romans 9:11; Ephesians 2:8;
	Ephesians 2:9). 
	his own purpose—The
	origination of salvation was of His own purpose, flowing from
	His own goodness, not for works of ours coming first, but wholly
	because of His own gratuitous, electing love [THEODORET
	and CALVIN]. 
	grace . . . given us—in
	His everlasting purpose, regarded as the same as when actually
	accomplished in due time. 
	in Christ—believers
	being regarded by God as IN
	HIM, with whom the Father
	makes the covenant of salvation (Ephesians 1:4;
	Ephesians 3:11). 
	before the world began—Greek,
	"before the times (periods) of ages"; the enduring ages of
	which no end is contemplated (1 Corinthians 2:7;
	Ephesians 3:11).
