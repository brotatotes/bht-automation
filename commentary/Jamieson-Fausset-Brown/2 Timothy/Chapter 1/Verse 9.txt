<p><b>9. Who . . . called us</b>—namely,
	God the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>). The
	having "saved us" in His eternal purpose of "grace,
	given us in Christ before the world began," precedes his actual
	"calling" of us in due time with a call made effective to
	us by the Holy Spirit; therefore, "saved us" comes before
	"called us" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6- :">Galatians 1:6- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>holy calling</b>—the actual
	call <i>to</i> a life of <i>holiness.</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6- :">Galatians 1:6- :</span>, "heavenly calling" [TITTMANN,
	<i>Greek Synonyms of the New Testament</i>]; whereas we were <i>sinners</i>
	and <i>enemies</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>). The call comes wholly
	<i>from</i> God and claims us wholly <i>for</i> God. "Holy"
	implies the <i>separation</i> of believers from the rest of the world
	unto God. 
	</p>
<p><b>not according to</b>—not
	having regard to our works in His election and calling of grace
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:11">Romans 9:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:9">Ephesians 2:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>his own purpose</b>—The
	origination of salvation was of <i>His own purpose,</i> flowing from
	His own goodness, not for works of ours coming first, but wholly
	because of His own gratuitous, electing love [THEODORET
	and CALVIN]. 
	</p>
<p><b>grace . . . given us</b>—in
	His everlasting purpose, regarded as the same as when actually
	accomplished in due time. 
	</p>
<p><b>in Christ</b>—believers
	being regarded by God as IN
	HIM, with whom the Father
	makes the covenant of salvation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>before the world began</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"before the times (periods) of ages"; the enduring ages of
	which no end is contemplated (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span>).</p>
