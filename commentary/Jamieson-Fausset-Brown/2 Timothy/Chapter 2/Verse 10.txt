<p><b>10. Therefore</b>—Because of the
	anxiety I feel that the Gospel should be extended; that anxiety being
	implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:9">2 Timothy 2:9</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>endure</b>—not merely "I
	passively <i>suffer,</i>" but "I actively and perseveringly
	<i>endure,</i>" and "am ready to endure patiently all

<p><b>the elect's sakes</b>—for
	the sake of the Church: all the members of Christ's spiritual body
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>). 
	</p>

<p><b>salvation . . . glory</b>—not
	only <i>salvation</i> from wrath, but <i>glory</i> in <i>reigning</i>
	with Him eternally (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:12">2 Timothy 2:12</span>).
	Glory is the full expansion of <i>salvation</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:47">Acts 2:47</span>;
