<p><b>11.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "Faithful
	is the saying."

<p><b>For</b>â€”"For" the
	fact is so that, "if we be dead with Him (the <i>Greek</i>
	aorist tense implies <i>a state once for all entered into in past
	times</i> at the moment of regeneration, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3">Romans 6:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:8">Romans 6:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>), we shall also live
	with Him." The symmetrical form of "the saying," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12- :">Colossians 2:12- :</span>, and the rhythmical balance of the parallel clauses,
	makes it likely, they formed part of a Church hymn (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12- :">Colossians 2:12- :</span>), or accepted formula, perhaps first uttered by some of the
	Christian "prophets" in the public assembly (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12- :">Colossians 2:12- :</span>). The phrase "faithful is the saying," which
	seems to have been the usual formula (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:1">1 Timothy 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:9">1 Timothy 4:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:8">Titus 3:8</span>) in such cases, favors
	this.</p>
