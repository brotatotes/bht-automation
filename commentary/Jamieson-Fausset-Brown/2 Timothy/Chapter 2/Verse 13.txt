<p><b>13. believe not</b>â€”"If we
	are unbelievers (literally, 'unfaithful'), He remains <i>faithful</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+7:9">Deuteronomy 7:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+7:10">Deuteronomy 7:10</span>).
	The oldest manuscripts read, "For He cannot (it is an
	<i>impossibility</i> that He should) deny Himself." <i>He</i>
	cannot be unfaithful to His word that He will deny those who deny
	Him, though <i>we</i> be not faithful to our profession of faith in
	Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:3">Romans 3:3</span>). Three things are
	impossible to God, to die, to lie, and to be deceived [AUGUSTINE,
	<i>The Creed,</i> 1.1], (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18">Hebrews 6:18</span>).
	This impossibility is not one of infirmity, but of infinite power and
	majesty. Also, indirectly, comfort is suggested to believers, that He
	is faithful to His promises to them; at the same time that apostates
	are shaken out of their self-deceiving fancy, that because they
	change, Christ similarly may change. A warning to Timothy to be
	steadfast in the faith.</p>
