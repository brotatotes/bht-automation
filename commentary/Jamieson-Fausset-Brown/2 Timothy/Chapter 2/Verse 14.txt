	The oldest manuscripts put a stop at "charging them before the

	remembrance") and read the imperative, "Strive not thou in
	words," c.

<p><b>to no profit</b>—not
	qualifying "words" but <i>Greek</i> neuter, in apposition
	with "strive in words," "(a thing tending) to no
	profit," literally, "profitable for nothing"; the
	opposite of "meet for the master's use" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:15- :">Acts 18:15- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>to the subverting</b>—sure
	to subvert (overturn) the hearers: the opposite of "edifying"
	(building up) (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:10">2 Corinthians 13:10</span>).</p>
