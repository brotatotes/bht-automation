<p><b>rightly dividing</b>—"rightly

	[ALFORD]; literally,
	cutting "straight" or "right": the metaphor being

	<i>cutting</i> and <i>distributing</i> bread among his children
	[VITRINGA and CALVIN],

	use it of "making one's way": so BENGEL
	here takes Paul to mean that Timothy may <i>make ready a straight way
	for</i> "the word of truth," and may himself walk straight
	forward according to this line, turning neither to the right nor to
	the left, "teaching no other doctrine" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+11:5- :">Proverbs 11:5- :</span>). The same image of a <i>way</i> appears in the <i>Greek</i>
	for "increase" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+11:5- :">Proverbs 11:5- :</span>). The opposite to "rightly handling," or
	"dispensing," is, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+11:5- :">Proverbs 11:5- :</span>, "corrupt the word of God."
