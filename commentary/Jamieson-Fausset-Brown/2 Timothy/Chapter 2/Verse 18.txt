18. erred—Greek,
	"missed the aim" (see  :-). 
	is past already—has
	already taken place. The beginnings of the subsequent Gnostic heresy
	already existed. They "wrested" ( :-) Paul's own words (Romans 6:4;
	Ephesians 2:6; Colossians 2:12)
	"to their own destruction," as though the resurrection was
	merely the spiritual raising of souls from the death of sin. Compare
	1 Corinthians 15:12, where he shows all
	our hopes of future glory rest on the literal reality of the
	resurrection. To believe it past (as the Seleucians or Hermians did,
	according to AUGUSTINE
	[Epistles, 119.55, To Januarius, 4]), is to deny it in
	its true sense. 
	overthrow—trying to
	subvert "the foundation" on which alone faith can rest
	secure (2 Timothy 2:19; compare 2 Timothy 2:19- :).
