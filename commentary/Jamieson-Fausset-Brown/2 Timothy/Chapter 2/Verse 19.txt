<p><b>19. Nevertheless</b>—Notwithstanding
	the subversion of <i>their</i> faith, "the firm foundation of
	<i>God</i> standeth" fast (so the <i>Greek</i> ought to be
	translated). The "foundation" here is "the Church"
	[ALFORD], "the
	ground" or basement support "of the truth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), Christ Himself being the ultimate "foundation"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>). In the steadfast
	standing of <i>the Church</i> there is involved the steadfast
	certainty of the <i>doctrine</i> in question (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11- :">1 Corinthians 3:11- :</span>). Thus the "house" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:11- :">1 Corinthians 3:11- :</span>) answers to the "foundation"; it is made up of the
	elect whom "the Lord knoweth" (acknowledgeth, recognizes,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:6">Psalms 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>;

	as "His," and who persevere to the end, though others "err
	concerning the faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:28">John 10:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38">Romans 8:38</span>;

	BENGEL takes "the
	foundation" to be <i>the immovable faithfulness of God</i> (to
	His promises to His elect [CALVIN]).
	This contrasts well with the <i>erring from the faith</i> on the part
	of the reprobate, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18">2 Timothy 2:18</span>.
	Though <i>they</i> deny <i>the faith, God</i> abates not <i>His
	faithfulness</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18- :">2 Timothy 2:18- :</span>).

	indicating <i>ownership</i> and <i>destination:</i> inscriptions were
	often engraven on a "foundation" stone (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18- :">2 Timothy 2:18- :</span>) [ALFORD]. This
	will agree with the view that "the foundation" is <i>the
	Church</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>). If it be
	taken God's <i>immovable faithfulness,</i> the "seal" will
	be regarded as attached to His covenant promise, with the inscription
	or legend, on one side of its round surface, "The Lord knoweth
	(it is 'knew' in the <i>Septuagint,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20- :">Ephesians 2:20- :</span>, to which Paul here alludes, altering it for his purpose by
	the Spirit) them that are His"; on the observe side, "Let
	every one that nameth (as <i>his</i> Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20- :">Ephesians 2:20- :</span>, or preacheth in His name, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20- :">Ephesians 2:20- :</span>) Christ."

<p><b>from iniquity</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20- :">Ephesians 2:20- :</span>). In both clauses there may be an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:5">Numbers 16:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:26">Numbers 16:26</span>, <i>Septuagint.</i>
	God's part and man's part are marked out. God chooseth and knoweth
	His elect; our part is to believe, and by the Spirit depart from all
	iniquity, an unequivocal proof of our being the Lord's (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+29:29">Deuteronomy 29:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:23-27">Luke 13:23-27</span>).
	St. Lucian when asked by his persecutors, "Of what country art
	thou?" replied, "I am a Christian." "What is your
	occupation? . . . I am a Christian." "Of what family? . . .
	I am a Christian." [CHRYSOSTOM,
	<i>Orations,</i> 75]. He cannot be honored with the name Christian,
	who dishonors by iniquity, Christ, the Author of the name. Blandina's
	refreshment amidst her tortures was to say, "I am a Christian,
	and <i>with us Christians no evil is done</i>" [EUSEBIUS,
	<i>Ecclesiastical History,</i> 5.1]. Apostasy from the faith is sure
	soon to be followed by indulgence in iniquity. It was so with the
	false teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:2-8">2 Timothy 3:2-8</span>;
