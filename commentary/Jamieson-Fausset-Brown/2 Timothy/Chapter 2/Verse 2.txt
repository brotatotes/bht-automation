	"through," that is, with the attestation (literally,
	"intervention") of many witnesses, namely, the presbyters
	and others present at his ordination or consecration (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>;

	"(persons) <i>such as</i> shall be competent to teach (them to)
	others also." Thus the way is prepared for inculcating the duty
	of faithful endurance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:14- :">2 Timothy 1:14- :</span>). Thou shouldest consider as a motive to endurance, that
	thou hast not only to keep the deposit for thyself, but to transmit
	it unimpaired to others, who in their turn shall fulfil the same
	office. This is so far from supporting oral tradition <i>now</i> that
	it rather teaches how precarious a mode of preserving revealed truth
	it was, depending, as it did, on the trustworthiness of each
	individual in the chain of succession; and how thankful we ought to
	be that <i>God Himself</i> has given <i>the written Word,</i> which
	is exempt from such risk.</p>
