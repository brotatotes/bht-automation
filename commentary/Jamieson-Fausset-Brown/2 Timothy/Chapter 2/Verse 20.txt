<p><b>20. in a great house</b>—that is,
	the visible professing Christian Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Paul is speaking, not of those without, but of the

	So the parable of the sweep-net (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) gathering together of every kind, good and bad: as the
	good and bad cannot be distinguished while under the waves, but only
	when brought to shore, so believers and unbelievers continue in the
	same Church, until the judgment makes the everlasting distinction.
	"The ark of Noah is a type of the Church; as in the former there
	were together the leopard and the kid, the wolf and the lamb; so in
	the latter, the righteous and sinners, vessels of gold and silver,
	with vessels of wood and earth" [JEROME,
	<i>Dialogue against the Luciferians,</i> 302] (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
