<p><b>22. Flee</b>—There are many lusts
	from which our greatest safety is in <i>flight</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Avoid occasions of sin. From the abstemious character of
	Timothy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:23">1 Timothy 5:23</span>) it is likely
	that not animal indulgences, but the impetuosity, rash
	self-confidence, hastiness, strife, and vainglory of young men (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:23- :">1 Timothy 5:23- :</span>), are what <i>he</i> is here warned against: though the
	Spirit probably intended the warning to include <i>both</i> in its
	application to the Church <i>in general.</i>

<p><b>peace, with,</b> c.—rather,

	We are to <i>love</i> all men, but it is not possible to be at <i>peace</i>
	with all men, for this needs community of purpose and opinion; they
	alone who call on the Lord sincerely (as contrasted with the false
	teachers who had only the form of godliness, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:5">2 Timothy 3:5</span>;
