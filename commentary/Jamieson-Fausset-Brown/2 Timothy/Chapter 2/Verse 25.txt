<p><b>25. instructing</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"disciplining," <i>instructing with correction,</i> which
	those who deal in "<i>uninstructive</i>" or "undisciplined
	questions" need (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>if . . . peradventure</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"if at any time."

<p><b>repentance</b>—which they
	need as antecedent to <i>the full knowledge</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>
	for '<i>acknowledgment</i>') <i>of the truth</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), their minds being corrupted (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and their lives immoral. The cause of the spiritual
	ignorance which prompts such "questions" is moral, having
	its seat in the <i>will,</i> not in the intellect (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Therefore repentance is their first need. That, not man,
	but God alone can "give" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
