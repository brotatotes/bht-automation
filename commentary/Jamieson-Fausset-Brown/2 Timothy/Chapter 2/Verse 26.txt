<p><b>26. recover themselves</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"awake to soberness," namely from the spiritual
	intoxication whereby they have fallen into the snare of the devil. 
	</p>
<p><b>the snare</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "the wiles of the devil": <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:7">1 Timothy 3:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:9">1 Timothy 6:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>taken captive by him at his
	will</b>—<i>so as to follow the will of</i> "THAT"
	(the <i>Greek</i> emphatically marks Satan thus) foe. However,
	different <i>Greek</i> pronouns stand for "him" and "his";
	and the <i>Greek</i> for "taken captive" means not
	"captured <i>for destruction,</i>" but "<i>for being
	saved alive,</i>" as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:9- :">1 Timothy 6:9- :</span>, "Thou shalt catch men to save them unto life";
	also there is no article before the <i>Greek</i> participle, which
	the <i>English Version</i> "who are taken captive," would
	require. Therefore, translate, "That they may awake . . . taken
	as saved (and willing) captives by him (the servant of the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:9- :">1 Timothy 6:9- :</span>), so as to follow the will of HIM
	(the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:24">2 Timothy 2:24</span>, or "God,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>)." There are here
	two evils, the "snare" and <i>sleep,</i> from which they
	are delivered: and two goods to which they are translated, <i>awaking</i>
	and deliverance. Instead of Satan's thrall comes the free and willing
	<i>captivity</i> of <i>obedience</i> to Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25- :">2 Timothy 2:25- :</span>). It is God who goes before, <i>giving repentance</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25- :">2 Timothy 2:25- :</span>); then the work of His servant following is sure to be
	crowned with success, leading the convert henceforth to "live to
	the will of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:2">1 Peter 4:2</span>).</p>
