4. "No one while serving as
	a soldier." 
	the affairs of (this)
	life—"the businesses of life" [ALFORD];
	mercantile, or other than military. 
	him who hath chosen him—the
	general who at the first enlisted him as a soldier. Paul himself
	worked at tent-making (Acts 18:3).
	Therefore what is prohibited here is, not all other save religious
	occupation, but the becoming entangled, or over-engrossed
	therewith.
