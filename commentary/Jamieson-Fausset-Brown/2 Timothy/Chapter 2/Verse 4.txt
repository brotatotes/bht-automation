<p><b>4.</b> "No one while serving as
	a soldier." 
	</p>
<p><b>the affairs of (this)
	life</b>—"the businesses of life" [ALFORD];
	mercantile, or other than military. 
	</p>
<p><b>him who hath chosen him</b>—the
	general who at the first enlisted him as a soldier. Paul himself
	worked at tent-making (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:3">Acts 18:3</span>).
	Therefore what is prohibited here is, not all other save religious
	occupation, but the becoming <i>entangled,</i> or over-engrossed
	therewith.</p>
