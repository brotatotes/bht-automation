<p><b>7.</b> Consider the force of the
	illustrations I have given from the soldier, the contender in the
	games, and the husbandmen, as <i>applying to thyself in thy ministry.</i>
</p>
<p><b>and the Lord give,</b> c.â€”The
	oldest manuscripts read, "<i>for</i> the Lord <i>will give</i>
	thee understanding." Thou canst understand my meaning so as
	personally to apply it to thyself for the Lord will give thee
	understanding when thou seekest it from Him "in all things."
	Not intellectual perception, but personal appropriation of the truths
	metaphorically expressed, was what he needed to be given him by the
	Lord.</p>
