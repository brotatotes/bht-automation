<p><b>8.</b> Rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead." Remember
	Christ risen, so as to follow Him. As He was raised after death, so
	if thou wouldest share His risen "life," thou must now
	share His "death" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The <i>Greek</i> perfect passive participle, implies a
	<i>permanent character</i> acquired by Jesus as <i>the risen</i>
	Saviour, and <i>our permanent interest in Him as such.</i> Christ's
	resurrection is put prominently forward as being the truth now
	assailed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18">2 Timothy 2:18</span>), and the
	one best calculated to stimulate Timothy to steadfastness in sharing
	Paul's sufferings for the Gospel's sake (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:18- :">2 Timothy 2:18- :</span>).

<p><b>of the seed of David</b>—The
	one and only genealogy (as contrasted with the "endless
	genealogies," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:4">1 Timothy 1:4</span>)
	worth thinking of, for it proves Jesus to be the Messiah. The absence
	of the article in the <i>Greek,</i> and this formula, "of the
	seed of David" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:4- :">1 Timothy 1:4- :</span>), imply that the words were probably part of a recognized
	short oral creed. In His death He assured us of His humanity; by His
	resurrection, of His divinity. That He was not crucified for <i>His
	own</i> sin appears from His resurrection; that He was crucified
	shows that He bore sin, <i>on</i> Him, though not in Him.
