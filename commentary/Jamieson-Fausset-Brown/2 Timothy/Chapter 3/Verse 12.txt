	consideration for Timothy: if he wishes to live godly in Christ,
	he must make up his mind to encounter persecution.

	"all whose will is to live," &c. So far should
	persecution be from being a stumbling-block to Timothy, he should
	consider it a mark of the pious. So the same Greek is used of
	the same thing, Luke 14:28 Luke 14:33,
	"intending (Greek, 'wishing') to build a tower . .

	There is no godliness (Greek, "piously") or piety

	BISHOP PEARSON
	proves the divine origination of Christianity from its success being
	inexplicable on the supposition of its being of human origin. The
	nature of its doctrine was no way likely to command success: (1) it
	condemns all other religions, some established for ages; (2) it
	enjoins precepts ungrateful to flesh and blood, the mortifying of the
	flesh, the love of enemies, and the bearing of the cross; (3) it
	enforces these seemingly unreasonable precepts by promises seemingly
	incredible; not good things such as afford complacency to our senses,
	but such as cannot be obtained till after this life, and presuppose
	what then seemed impossible, the resurrection; (4) it predicts to its
	followers what would seem sure to keep most of the world from
	embracing it, persecutions.
