<p><b>12. Yea, and</b>—an additional
	consideration for Timothy: if he <i>wishes to live godly in Christ,</i>
	he must make up his mind to encounter persecution. 
	</p>
<p><b>that will,</b> c.—<i>Greek,</i>
	"all whose <i>will is to</i> live," &amp;c. So far should
	persecution be from being a stumbling-block to Timothy, he should
	consider it a mark of the pious. So the same <i>Greek</i> is used of
	the same thing, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:28">Luke 14:28</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:33">Luke 14:33</span>,
	"intending (<i>Greek,</i> '<i>wishing</i>') to build a tower . .

<p><b>live godly in Christ</b>—

	There is no godliness (<i>Greek,</i> "piously") or <i>piety</i>
	out of Christ. The world easily puts up with the mask of a religion
	which depends on itself, but the piety which derives its vigor
	directly from Christ is as odious to modern Christians as it was to
	the ancient Jews [BENGEL].

	BISHOP PEARSON
	proves the divine origination of Christianity from its success being
	inexplicable on the supposition of its being of human origin. The
	nature of its doctrine was no way likely to command success: (1) it
	condemns all other religions, some established for ages; (2) it
	enjoins precepts ungrateful to flesh and blood, the mortifying of the
	flesh, the love of enemies, and the bearing of the cross; (3) it
	enforces these seemingly unreasonable precepts by promises seemingly
	incredible; not good things such as afford complacency to our senses,
	but such as cannot be obtained till after this life, and presuppose
	what then seemed impossible, the resurrection; (4) it predicts to its
	followers what would seem sure to keep most of the world from
	embracing it, <i>persecutions.</i></p>
