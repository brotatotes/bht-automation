<p><b>13.</b> Reason why persecutions must
	be expected, and these becoming worse and worse as the end
	approaches. The breach between light and darkness, so far from being
	healed, shall be widened [ALFORD].

<p><b>evil men</b>—in contrast to
	the "godly" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:12">2 Timothy 3:12</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>seducers</b>—literally,
	"conjurers." Magical arts prevailed at Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:12- :">2 Timothy 3:12- :</span>), and had been renounced by many Ephesians on embracing
	Christianity: but now when Paul was writing to Ephesus, symptoms of a
	return to <i>conjuring</i> tricks appeared: an undesigned coincidence
	[BURTON]. Probably <i>sorcery</i>
	will characterize the final apostasy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:15">Revelation 13:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:23">Revelation 18:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:15">Revelation 22:15</span>).

<p><b>wax worse</b>—literally,
	"advance in the direction of worse" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:15- :">Revelation 22:15- :</span>). Not contradictory to that verse: there the <i>diffusion</i>
	of the evil was spoken of; here its <i>intensity</i> [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>deceiving, and being
	deceived</b>—He who has once begun to deceive others, is the less
	easily able to recover himself from error, and the more easily
	embraces in turn the errors of others [BENGEL].</p>
