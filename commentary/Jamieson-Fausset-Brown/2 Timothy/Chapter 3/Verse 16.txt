<p><b>16. All scripture</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Every Scripture," that is, Scripture in its every part.
	However, <i>English Version</i> is sustained, though the <i>Greek</i>
	article be wanting, by the technical use of the term "Scripture"
	being so well known as not to need the article (compare <i>Greek,</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:15">Ephesians 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span>).
	The <i>Greek</i> is never used of <i>writings</i> in general, but
	only of the sacred Scriptures. The position of the two <i>Greek</i>
	adjectives closely united by "and," forbids our taking the
	one as an epithet, the other as predicated and translated as ALFORD
	and ELLICOTT. "Every
	Scripture given by inspiration of God is <i>also</i> profitable."
	<i>Vulgate</i> and the best manuscripts, favor <i>English Version.</i>
	Clearly the adjectives are so closely connected that as surely as one
	is a predicate, the other must be so too. ALFORD
	admits his translation to be harsh, though legitimate. It is better
	with <i>English Version</i> to take it in a construction legitimate,
	and at the same time <i>not harsh.</i> The <i>Greek,</i>
	"God-inspired," is found nowhere else. Most of the New
	Testament books were written when Paul wrote this his latest Epistle:
	so he includes in the clause "All Scripture is God-inspired,"
	not only the <i>Old Testament,</i> in which alone Timothy was taught
	when a child (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15">2 Timothy 3:15</span>), but
	the New Testament books according as they were recognized in the
	churches which had men gifted with "discerning of spirits,"
	and so able to distinguish really inspired utterances, persons, and
	so their writings from spurious. Paul means, "All Scripture is
	God-inspired <i>and therefore</i> useful"; because <i>we</i> see
	no utility in any words or portion of it, it does not follow it is
	not God-inspired. It is <i>useful,</i> because <i>God-inspired;</i>
	not <i>God-inspired,</i> because useful. One reason for the article
	not being before the <i>Greek,</i> "Scripture," may be
	that, if it had, it <i>might</i> be supposed that it limited the
	sense to the <i>hiera grammata,</i> "Holy Scriptures" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:15- :">2 Timothy 3:15- :</span>) <i>of the Old Testament,</i> whereas here the assertion is
	more general: "<i>all</i> Scripture" (compare <i>Greek,</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:20">2 Peter 1:20</span>). The translation,
	"all Scripture that is God-inspired is also useful," would
	imply that there is some <i>Scripture</i> which is not God-inspired.
	But this would exclude the appropriated sense of the word
	"Scripture"; and who would need to be told that "all
	divine Scripture is <i>useful</i> ('profitable')?" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:20- :">2 Peter 1:20- :</span> would, in ALFORD'S
	view, have to be rendered, "All naked things are <i>also</i>
	open to the eyes of Him," c.: so also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:20- :">2 Peter 1:20- :</span>, which would be absurd [TREGELLES,
	<i>Remarks on the Prophetic Visions of the Book of Daniel</i>]. Knapp
	well defines inspiration, "An extraordinary divine agency upon
	teachers while giving instruction, whether oral or written, by which
	they were taught how and what they should speak or write"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+23:1">2 Samuel 23:1</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:25">Acts 4:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:21">2 Peter 1:21</span>). The <i>inspiration</i>
	gives the divine <i>sanction</i> to all the words of Scripture,
	though those words be the utterances of the individual writer, and
	only in special cases <i>revealed</i> directly by God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:21- :">2 Peter 1:21- :</span>). <i>Inspiration</i> is here predicated of the <i>writings,</i>
	"all Scripture," not of the persons. The question is not
	<i>how</i> God has done it; it is as to the <i>word,</i> not the <i>men</i>
	who wrote it. What we must believe is that He <i>has</i> done it, and
	that all the sacred writings are every where inspired, though not all
	alike matter of special <i>revelation:</i> and that even the very
	<i>words</i> are stamped with divine sanction, as Jesus used them
	(for example in the temptation and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:34">John 10:34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:35">John 10:35</span>), for deciding all
	questions of doctrine and practice. There are degrees of <i>revelation</i>
	in Scripture, but not of <i>inspiration.</i> The sacred writers did
	not even always know the full significancy of their own God-inspired
	words (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:10">1 Peter 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:11">1 Peter 1:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>). Verbal inspiration
	does not mean mechanical dictation, but all "Scripture is (so)
	inspired by God," that everything in it, its narratives,
	prophecies, citations, the whole—ideas, phrases, and words—are
	such as He saw fit to be there. The <i>present condition</i> of the
	text is no ground for concluding against the <i>original text</i>
	being inspired, but is a reason why we should use all critical
	diligence to restore the original inspired text. Again, inspiration
	may be accompanied by revelation or not, but it is as much needed for
	writing <i>known</i> doctrines or facts authoritatively, as for
	communicating <i>new</i> truths [TREGELLES].
	The omission here of the substantive verb is,' I think, designed to
	mark that, not only the Scripture <i>then</i> existing, but what was
	<i>still to be written till the canon should be completed,</i> is
	included as <i>God-inspired.</i> The Old Testament law was the
	schoolmaster to bring us to Christ; so it is appropriately said to be
	"able to make <i>wise</i> unto salvation through faith in Jesus
	Christ": the term <i>wisdom</i> being appropriated to a
	knowledge of the relations between the Old and New Testaments, and
	opposed to the pretended <i>wisdom</i> of the false teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:7">1 Timothy 1:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:8">1 Timothy 1:8</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>doctrine</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"teaching," that is, <i>teaching the ignorant dogmatic</i>
	truths which they cannot otherwise know. He so uses the Old
	Testament, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>reproof</b>—"refutation,"
	<i>convicting the erring</i> of their error. Including <i>polemical</i>
	divinity. As an example of this use of the Old Testament, compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:6">Galatians 3:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>. "Doctrine and
	reproof" comprehend the <i>speculative</i> parts of divinity.
	Next follow the <i>practical:</i> Scripture is profitable for: (1)
	<i>correction</i> (<i>Greek,</i> "setting one right";
	compare an example, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16- :">Galatians 3:16- :</span>) and <i>instruction</i> (<i>Greek,</i> "disciplining,"
	as a father does his child, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16- :">Galatians 3:16- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:4">Ephesians 6:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:5">Hebrews 12:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:11">Hebrews 12:11</span>, or "training"
	by instruction, warning, example, kindnesses, promises, and
	chastisements; compare an example, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:11- :">Hebrews 12:11- :</span>). Thus the whole science of theology is complete in
	Scripture. Since Paul is speaking of Scripture in general and in the
	notion of it, the only <i>general</i> reason why, in order to
	<i>perfecting</i> the godly (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:11- :">Hebrews 12:11- :</span>), it should extend to <i>every department</i> of revealed
	truth, must be that it was intended to be the <i>complete and
	sufficient rule</i> in all things touching perfection. See Article
	VI, <i>Common Prayer Book.</i>

<p><b>in</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"instruction <i>which is in</i> righteousness," as
	contrasted with the "instruction" in worldly rudiments
