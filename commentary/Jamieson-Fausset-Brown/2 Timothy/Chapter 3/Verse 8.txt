	it is no wonder there should be now such opponents to the truth, for
	their prototypes existed in ancient times [ALFORD].

<p><b>Jannes . . .
	Jambres</b>—traditional names of the Egyptian magicians who
	resisted Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:11">Exodus 7:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:22">Exodus 7:22</span>),
	derived from "the unwritten teaching of the Jews"
	[THEODORET]. In a point so
	immaterial as the names, where Scripture had not recorded them, Paul
	takes the names which general opinion had assigned the magicians.
	EUSEBIUS [<i>Preparation
	of the Gospel</i>], quotes from NUMENIUS,
	"Jannes and Jambres were <i>sacred scribes</i> (a lower order of
	priests in Egypt) skilled in magic." HILLER
	interprets "Jannes" from the Abyssinian language <i>a
	trickster,</i> and "Jambres" <i>a juggler</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:22- :">Exodus 7:22- :</span>).

<p><b>resist</b>—"withstand,"
	as before. They did so by trying to rival Moses' miracles. So the
	false teachers shall exhibit lying wonders in the last days (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:24">Matthew 24:24</span>;

<p><b>reprobate</b>—<i>incapable
	of testing</i> the truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:28">Romans 1:28</span>)
	[BENGEL]. ALFORD
	takes passively, "not abiding the test"; rejected on being
	tested (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+6:30">Jeremiah 6:30</span>).</p>
