	it is no wonder there should be now such opponents to the truth, for
	their prototypes existed in ancient times [ALFORD].
	Jannes . . .
	Jambres—traditional names of the Egyptian magicians who
	resisted Moses (Exodus 7:11; Exodus 7:22),
	derived from "the unwritten teaching of the Jews"
	[THEODORET]. In a point so
	immaterial as the names, where Scripture had not recorded them, Paul
	takes the names which general opinion had assigned the magicians.
	EUSEBIUS [Preparation
	of the Gospel], quotes from NUMENIUS,
	"Jannes and Jambres were sacred scribes (a lower order of
	priests in Egypt) skilled in magic." HILLER
	interprets "Jannes" from the Abyssinian language a
	trickster, and "Jambres" a juggler" (Exodus 7:22- :).

	as before. They did so by trying to rival Moses' miracles. So the
	false teachers shall exhibit lying wonders in the last days (Matthew 24:24;
	2 Thessalonians 2:9; Revelation 13:14;
	Revelation 13:15). 
	reprobate—incapable
	of testing the truth (Romans 1:28)
	[BENGEL]. ALFORD
	takes passively, "not abiding the test"; rejected on being
	tested (Jeremiah 6:30).
