<p><b>9. they shall proceed no
	further</b>—Though <i>for a time</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) "they shall <i>advance</i> or <i>proceed</i> (<i>English
	Version,</i> 'increase') unto more ungodliness," yet there is a
	<i>final</i> limit beyond which they shall not be able to "proceed
	further" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+38:11">Job 38:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:7">Revelation 11:7</span>;

	"wax worse and worse" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:11- :">Revelation 11:11- :</span>), but they shall at last be for ever prevented from seducing

<p><b>as theirs . . . was</b>—as

	to rival Moses in sending boils, but the boils fell upon themselves:
	so as to the lice (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+8:18">Exodus 8:18</span>;
