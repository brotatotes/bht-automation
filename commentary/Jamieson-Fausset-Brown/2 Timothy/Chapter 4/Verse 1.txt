1. charge—Greek,
	"adjure." 
	therefore—omitted in
	the oldest manuscripts. 
	the Lord Jesus Christ—The
	oldest manuscripts read simply, "Christ Jesus." 
	shall judge—His
	commission from God is mentioned,  :-; his resolution to do so,  :-; the execution of his commission, here. 
	at his appearing—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "and" for "at"; then
	translate, "(I charge thee before God . . . ) and by
	His appearing." 
	and his kingdom—to be
	set at His appearing, when we hope to reign with Him. His kingdom is
	real now, but not visible. It shall then be both real and visible
	(Luke 22:18; Luke 22:30;
	Revelation 1:7; Revelation 11:15;
	Revelation 19:6). Now he reigns
	in the midst of His enemies expecting till they shall be
	overthrown (Psalms 110:2; Hebrews 10:13).
	Then He shall reign with His adversaries prostrate.
