<p><b>10. Demas</b>—once a "fellow
	laborer" of Paul, along with Mark and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:14">Colossians 4:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:24">Philemon 1:24</span>). His motive for
	forsaking Paul seems to have been love of worldly ease, safety, and
	comforts at home, and disinclination to brave danger with Paul
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:20">Matthew 13:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:21">Matthew 13:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:22">Matthew 13:22</span>). CHRYSOSTOM
	implies that Thessalonica was his home.

<p><b>Galatia</b>—One oldest
	manuscript supports the reading "Gaul." But most oldest
	manuscripts, c., "Galatia."

<p><b>Titus</b>—He must have
	therefore left Crete after "setting in order" the affairs
	of the churches there (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:5">Titus 1:5</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>Dalmatia</b>—part of the
	Roman province of Illyricum on the coast of the Adriatic. Paul had
	written to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:12">Titus 3:12</span>) to
	come to him in the winter to Nicopolis (in Epirus), intending in the
	spring to preach the Gospel in the adjoining province of Dalmatia.
	Titus seems to have gone thither to carry out the apostle's
	intention, the execution of which was interrupted by his arrest.
	Whether he went of his own accord, as is likely, or was sent by Paul,
	which the expression "is departed" hardly accords with,
	cannot be positively decided. Paul here speaks only of his personal
	attendants having forsaken him he had still friends among the Roman
	Christians who visited him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:12- :">Titus 3:12- :</span>), though they had been afraid to stand by him at his trial
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:16">2 Timothy 4:16</span>).</p>
