<p><b>11. Take</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "take

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:14">Acts 20:14</span>). John Mark was
	probably in, or near, Colosse, as in the Epistle to the Colossians
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>), written two years
	before this, he is mentioned as about to visit them. Timothy was now
	absent from Ephesus and somewhere in the interior of Asia Minor;
	hence he would be sure to fall in with Mark on his journey.

<p><b>he is profitable to me for
	the ministry</b>—Mark had been under a cloud for having forsaken
	Paul at a critical moment in his missionary tour with Barnabas
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:37-40">Acts 15:37-40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:5">Acts 13:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:13">Acts 13:13</span>). Timothy had
	subsequently occupied the same post in relation to Paul as Mark once
	held. Hence Paul, appropriately here, wipes out the past censure by
	high praise of Mark and guards against Timothy's making
	self-complacent comparisons between himself and Mark, as though he
	were superior to the latter (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:13- :">Acts 13:13- :</span>). Demas apostatizes. Mark returns to the right way, and is no
	longer unprofitable, but is profitable for the Gospel ministry (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:13- :">Acts 13:13- :</span>).</p>
