12. Andâ€”Greek, "But."
	Thou art to come to me, but Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus to
	supply thy place (if thou so willest it) in presiding over the Church
	there in thy absence (compare  :-). It is possible Tychicus was the bearer of this Epistle,
	though the omission of "to thee" is rather against this
	view.
