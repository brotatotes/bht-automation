<p><b>12. And</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i> "But."
	Thou art to come to me, <i>but</i> Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus to
	supply thy place (if thou so willest it) in presiding over the Church
	there in thy absence (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). It is possible Tychicus was the bearer of this Epistle,
	though the omission of "to thee" is rather against this
	view.</p>
