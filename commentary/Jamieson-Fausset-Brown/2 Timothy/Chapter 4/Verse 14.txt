<p><b>14. Alexander the coppersmith</b>—or
	"smith" in general. Perhaps the same as the Alexander (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) at Ephesus.
	Excommunicated then he subsequently was restored, and now vented his
	personal malice because of his excommunication in accusing Paul
	before the Roman judges, whether of incendiarism or of introducing a
	new religion. See my <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>
	He may have been the Alexander put forward by the Jews in the tumult
	at Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:33">Acts 19:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:34">Acts 19:34</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>reward</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "<i>shall</i> reward," or "requite
	him." Personal revenge certainly did not influence the apostle
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:16">2 Timothy 4:16</span>, end).</p>
