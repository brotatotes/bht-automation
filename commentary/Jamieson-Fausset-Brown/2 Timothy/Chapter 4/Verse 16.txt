16. At my first answer—that
	is, "defense" in court, at my first public examination.
	Timothy knew nothing of this, it is plain, till Paul now informs him.
	But during his former imprisonment at Rome, Timothy was with
	him (Philippians 1:1; Philippians 1:7).
	This must have been, therefore, a second imprisonment. He must
	have been set free before the persecution in A.D.
	64, when the Christians were accused of causing the conflagration in
	Rome; for, had he been a prisoner then, he certainly would not have
	been spared. The tradition [EUSEBIUS,
	Ecclesiastical History, 2.251] that he was finally beheaded,
	accords with his not having been put to death in the persecution,
	A.D. 64, when burning
	to death was the mode by which the Christians were executed, but
	subsequently to it. His "first" trial in his second
	imprisonment seems to have been on the charge of complicity in the
	conflagration; his absence from Rome may have been the ground of his
	acquittal on that charge; his final condemnation was probably on the
	charge of introducing a new and unlawful religion into Rome. 
	stood with me—Greek,
	"came forward with me" [ALFORD]
	as a friend and advocate. 
	may it
	not be laid to their charge—The position of "their,"
	in the Greek, is emphatic. "May it not be laid to THEIR
	charge," for they were intimidated; their drawing back
	from me was not from bad disposition so much as from fear; it is sure
	to be laid to the charge of those who intimidated them. Still Paul,
	like Stephen, would doubtless have offered the same prayer for his
	persecutors themselves (Acts 7:60).
