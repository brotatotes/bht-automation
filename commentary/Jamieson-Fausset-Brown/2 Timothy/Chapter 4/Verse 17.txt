<p><b>17. the Lord</b>—the more because
	<i>men</i> deserted me.

<p><b>stood with me</b>—stronger
	than "came forward with me" (<i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>strengthened</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>put strength in</i> me." 
	</p>
<p><b>by me</b>—"through

	greatest moment.

<p><b>the preaching</b>—"the
	Gospel proclamation." 
	</p>
<p><b>might be fully known</b>—might
	be fully made (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:5">2 Timothy 4:5</span>).

<p><b>that all the Gentiles</b>—present
	at my trial, "might hear" the Gospel proclaimed then. Rome
	was the capital of the Gentile world, so that a proclamation of the
	truth to the Romans was likely to go forth to the rest of the Gentile
	world.

<p><b>I was delivered out of the
	mouth of the lion</b>—namely, Satan, the roaring, devouring lion
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:31">Luke 22:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:8">1 Peter 5:8</span>).
	I was prevented falling into his snare (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:26">2 Timothy 2:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:21">Psalms 22:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:9">2 Peter 2:9</span>);
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:18">2 Timothy 4:18</span> agrees with this
	interpretation, "The Lord shall <i>deliver</i> me <i>from every
	evil</i> work," namely, both from evil and the evil one, as the
	<i>Greek</i> of the Lord's Prayer expresses it. It was not
	deliverance from Nero (who was called <i>the lion</i>) which he
	rejoiced in, for he did not fear <i>death</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:18- :">2 Timothy 4:18- :</span>), but deliverance from the temptation, through fear, to
	deny His Lord: so ALFORD.</p>
