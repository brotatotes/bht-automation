<p><b>20.</b> In order to depict his
	desertion, he informs Timothy that Erastus, one of his usual
	companions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>, possibly
	the same Erastus as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>,
	though how he could leave his official duties for missionary journeys
	is not clear), stayed behind at Corinth, his native place, or usual
	residence, of which city he was "chamberlain," or city
	steward and treasurer (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23">Romans 16:23</span>);
	and Trophimus he left behind at Miletus sick. (On his former history,
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23- :">Romans 16:23- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:23- :">Romans 16:23- :</span>). This verse is irreconcilable with the imprisonment from
	which he writes being the <i>first:</i> for he did not pass by
	Corinth or Miletus on his way to Rome when about to be imprisoned for
	the first time. As Miletus was near Ephesus, there is a presumption
	that Timothy was <i>not</i> at Ephesus when Paul wrote, or he would
	not need to inform Timothy of Trophimus lying sick in his immediate
	neighborhood. However, Trophimus may not have been still at Miletus
	at the time when Paul wrote, though he had left him there on his way
	to Rome. Prisca and Aquila were most likely to be at <i>Ephesus</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:19">2 Timothy 4:19</span>), and he desires
	Timothy to <i>salute them:</i> so also Onesiphorus' household (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:19- :">2 Timothy 4:19- :</span>). Paul had not the power of healing at will (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:19- :">2 Timothy 4:19- :</span>), but as the Lord allowed him.</p>
