21. before winter—when a
	voyage, according to ancient usages of navigation, would be out of
	the question: also, Paul would need his "cloak" against the
	winter (2 Timothy 4:13). 
	Pudens . . .
	Claudia—afterwards husband and wife (according to MARTIAL
	[Epigrams, 4.13; 11.54]), he a Roman knight, she a Briton,
	surnamed Rufina. TACITUS
	[On Agriculture, 14], mentions that territories in southeast
	Britain were given to a British king; Cogidunus, in reward for his
	fidelity to Rome, A.D. 52,
	while Claudius was emperor. In 1772 a marble was dug up at
	Chichester, mentioning Cogidunus with the surname Claudius, added
	from his patron, the emperor's name; and Pudens in connection
	with Cogidunus, doubtless his father-in-law. His daughter would be
	Claudia, who seems to have been sent to Rome for education, as a
	pledge of the father's fidelity. Here she was under the protection of
	Pomponia, wife of Aulus Plautius, conqueror of Britain. Pomponia was
	accused of foreign superstitions, A.D.
	57 [TACITUS, Annals,
	3.32], probably Christianity. She probably was the instrument
	of converting Claudia, who took the name Rufina from her, that
	being a cognomen of the Pomponian gens (compare 2 Timothy 4:13- :, Rufus, a Christian). Pudens in MARTIAL
	and in the Chichester inscription, appears as a pagan; but
	perhaps he or his friends concealed his Christianity through fear.
	Tradition represents Timothy, a son of Pudens, as taking part
	in converting the Britons. 
	Linus—put third;
	therefore not at this time yet, as he was afterwards, bishop.
	His name being here inserted between Pudens and Claudia, implies the
	two were not yet married. "Eubulus" is identified by some
	with Aristobulus, who, with his converts, is said to have been among
	the first evangelists of Britain. Paul himself, says CLEMENT,
	"visited the farthest west [perhaps Britain, certainly
	Spain], and was martyred under the rulers at Rome," who
	were Nero's vicegerents in his absence from the city.
