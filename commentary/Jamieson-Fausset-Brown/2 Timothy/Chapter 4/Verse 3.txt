<p><b>sound doctrine</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the sound (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>)
	doctrine (<i>didascalias</i>)" or "teaching," namely,
	of the Gospel. Presently follows the concrete, "teachers."

<p><b>heap</b>—one on another: an
	indiscriminate mass of false teachers. Variety delights itching ears.
	"He who despises sound teaching, leaves sound teachers; they
	seek instructors like themselves" [BENGEL].
	It is the corruption of the people in the first instance, that
	creates priestcraft (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:1">Exodus 32:1</span>).

	teachers who give them mere pleasure (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+4:9- :">Hosea 4:9- :</span>), and do not offend by truths grating to their ears.
	They, as it were, tickle with pleasure the levity of the multitude
	[CICERO], who come as to a
	theater to hear what will delight their ears, not to learn [SENECA,
	<i>Epistles,</i> 10.8] what will do them good. "Itch in the ear
	is as bad in any other part of the body, and perhaps worse"
	[SOUTH].</p>
