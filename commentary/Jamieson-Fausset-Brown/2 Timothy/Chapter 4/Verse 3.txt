3. they—professing Christians.
	sound doctrine—Greek,
	"the sound (see on  :-)
	doctrine (didascalias)" or "teaching," namely,
	of the Gospel. Presently follows the concrete, "teachers." 
	after their own lusts—Instead
	of regarding the will of God they dislike being interrupted in their
	lusts by true teachers. 
	heap—one on another: an
	indiscriminate mass of false teachers. Variety delights itching ears.
	"He who despises sound teaching, leaves sound teachers; they
	seek instructors like themselves" [BENGEL].
	It is the corruption of the people in the first instance, that
	creates priestcraft (Exodus 32:1). 
	to themselves—such as
	will suit their depraved tastes; populus vult decipi, et
	decipiatur—"the people wish to be deceived, so let them be
	deceived." "Like priest, like people" (1 Kings 12:31;
	Hosea 4:9). 
	itching—like to hear
	teachers who give them mere pleasure (Hosea 4:9- :), and do not offend by truths grating to their ears.
	They, as it were, tickle with pleasure the levity of the multitude
	[CICERO], who come as to a
	theater to hear what will delight their ears, not to learn [SENECA,
	Epistles, 10.8] what will do them good. "Itch in the ear
	is as bad in any other part of the body, and perhaps worse"
	[SOUTH].
