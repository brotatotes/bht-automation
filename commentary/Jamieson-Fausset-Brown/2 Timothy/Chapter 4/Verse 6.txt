<p><b>6.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "For I am
	already being offered"; literally, as a <i>libation;</i>
	appropriate to the shedding of <i>his blood.</i> Every sacrifice
	began with an initiatory libation on the victim's head (compare <i>Note,</i>
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). A motive to
	stimulate Timothy to faithfulness—the departure and final
	blessedness of Paul; it is the end that crowns the work [BENGEL].
	As the time of his departure was indicated to Peter, so to Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>my departure</b>—literally,
	"loosing anchor" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>Dissolution.</i></p>
