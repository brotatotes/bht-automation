<p><b>8. a crown</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the</i> crown." The "henceforth" marks the
	decisive moment; he looks to his state in a threefold aspect: (1) The
	past "I have fought"; (2) The immediate present; "there
	is laid up for me." (3) The future "the Lord will give in
	that day" [BENGEL].

<p><b>crown</b>—a crown, or
	garland, used to be bestowed at the Greek national games on the
	successful competitor in wrestling, running, c. (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of righteousness</b>—The
	reward is <i>in recognition of righteousness</i> wrought in Paul by
	God's Spirit; the crown is prepared for the righteous; but it is a
	crown <i>which consists in righteousness. Righteousness will be its
	own reward</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:11">Revelation 22:11</span>).
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+39:30">Exodus 39:30</span>. A man is
	justified gratuitously by the merits of Christ through faith; and
	when he is so justified God accepts his works and honors them with a
	reward which is not their due, but is given of grace. "So great
	is God's goodness to men that He wills that their works should be
	merits, though they are merely His own gifts" [POPE
	CELESTINE I., <i>Epistles,</i>
	12]. 
	</p>
<p><b>give</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"shall award" in righteous requital as "Judge"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:31">Acts 17:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:6">2 Thessalonians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>in that day</b>—not until
	His appearing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>). The
	partakers of the first resurrection may receive a <i>crown</i> also
	<i>at the last day,</i> and obtain in that general assembly of all
	men, a <i>new</i> award of praise. The favorable sentence passed on
	the "brethren" of the Judge, who sit with Him on His
	throne, is in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40">Matthew 25:40</span>, taken
	for granted as <i>already</i> awarded, when that affecting those who
	benefited them is being passed [BENGEL].
	The former, the elect Church who reign with Christ in the millennium,
	are fewer than the latter. The <i>righteous</i> heavenly Judge stands
	in contrast to the unrighteous earthly judges who condemned Paul.

<p><b>me</b>—individual
	appropriation. <i>Greek,</i> "not only to me." 
	</p>
<p><b>them that love</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"have loved, and do love"; <i>habitual</i> love and desire
	for Christ's appearing, which presupposes <i>faith</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40- :">Matthew 25:40- :</span>). Compare the sad contrast, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:40- :">Matthew 25:40- :</span>, "having <i>loved</i> this present world."</p>
