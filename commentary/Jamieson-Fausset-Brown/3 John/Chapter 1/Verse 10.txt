<p style=" "><b>casteth

	those that would receive the brethren, by excommunication from the
	Church, which his influence, as a leading man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>)
	in it, enabled him to do. Neander thinks that the missionaries were
	JEWS by birth, whence it is said in their praise they <i>took
	nothing from</i>
	THE GENTILES: in contrast to other Jewish missionaries who abused
	ministers’ right of maintenance elsewhere, as Paul tells us, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.
	Now in the Gentile churches there existed an ultra-Pauline party of
	anti-Jewish tendency, the forerunners of Marcion: Diotrephes possibly
	stood at the head of this party, which fact, as well as this
	domineering spirit, may account for his hostility to the
	missionaries, and to the apostle John, who had, by the power of love,
	tried to harmonize the various elements in the Asiatic churches. At a
	later period, Marcion, we know, attached himself to Paul alone, and
	paid no deference to the authority of John.</p>
