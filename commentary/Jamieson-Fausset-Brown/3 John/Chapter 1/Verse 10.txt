	Church, which his influence, as a leading man ( :-)

	THE GENTILES: in contrast to other Jewish missionaries who abused

	Now in the Gentile churches there existed an ultra-Pauline party of
	anti-Jewish tendency, the forerunners of Marcion: Diotrephes possibly
	stood at the head of this party, which fact, as well as this
	domineering spirit, may account for his hostility to the
	missionaries, and to the apostle John, who had, by the power of love,
	tried to harmonize the various elements in the Asiatic churches. At a
	later period, Marcion, we know, attached himself to Paul alone, and
	paid no deference to the authority of John.
