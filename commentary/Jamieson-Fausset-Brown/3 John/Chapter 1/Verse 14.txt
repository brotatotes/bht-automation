<p style=" "><b>face
	to face</b>
	— <i>Greek,</i>
	“mouth to mouth.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Peace</b>
	— peace inward of conscience, peace fraternal of friendship, peace
	supernal of glory [Lyra].</p>
<p style=" "><b>friends</b>
	— a title seldom used in the New Testament, as it is absorbed in
	the higher titles of “brother, brethren.” Still Christ recognizes
	the relation of <i>friend</i>
	also, based on the highest grounds, obedience to Him from love, and
	entailing the highest privileges, admission to the intimacy of the
	holy and glorious God, and sympathizing Savior; so Christians have
	“friends” in Christ. Here in a friendly letter, mention of
	“friends" appropriately occurs.</p>
<p style=" "><b>by
	name</b> —
	not less than if their names were written [Bengel].</p>
