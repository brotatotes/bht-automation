above
	all things
	— Greek,
	“concerning
	all things”: so Alford: in
	all respects.
	But Wahl justifies English
	Version
	(compare  :-).
	Of course, since his soul’s
	prosperity
	is presupposed, “above all things” does not imply that John
	wishes Gaius’ bodily health above that of his soul, but as the
	first
	object to be desired next
	after spiritual health.
	I know you are prospering in the concerns of your soul. I wish you
	similar prosperity in your body. Perhaps John had heard from the
	brethren ( :-)
	that Gaius was in bad health, and was tried in other ways ( :-),
	to which the wish,  :-,
	refers.prosper
	— in general.be
	in health
	— in particular.
