<p style=" "><b>above
	all things</b>
	— <i>Greek,</i>
	“<i>concerning</i>
	all things”: so Alford: <i>in
	all respects.</i>
	But Wahl justifies <i>English
	Version</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	Of course, since his <i>soul’s
	prosperity</i>
	is presupposed, “above all things” does not imply that John
	wishes Gaius’ bodily health above that of his soul, but as the
	<i>first</i>
	object to be desired <i>next
	after spiritual health.</i>
	I know you are prospering in the concerns of your soul. I wish you
	similar prosperity in your body. Perhaps John had heard from the
	brethren (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>)
	that Gaius was in bad health, and was tried in other ways (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>),
	to which the wish, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	refers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>prosper</b>
	— in general.</p>
<p style=" "><b>be
	in health</b>
	— in particular.</p>
