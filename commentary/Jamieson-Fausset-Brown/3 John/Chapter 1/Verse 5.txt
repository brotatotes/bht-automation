	— an act becoming a faithful man.</p>
<p style=" "><b>whatsoever
	thou doest</b>
	— a distinct <i>Greek</i>
	word from the former “doest”: translate, “workest”:
	whatsoever work, or labor of love, thou dost perform. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	“She hath wrought a good <i>work</i>
	upon me.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>and
	to strangers</b>
	— The oldest manuscripts, “and that (that is, and those brethren)
	strangers.” The fact of the brethren whom thou didst entertain
	being “strangers,” enhances the love manifested in the act.</p>
