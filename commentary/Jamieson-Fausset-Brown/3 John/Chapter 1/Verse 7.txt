<p style=" "><b>went

<p style=" "><b>taking

	— refusing to <i>receive</i>
	aught by way of pay, or maintenance, though justly entitled to it, as
	Paul at Corinth and at Thessalonica.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Gentiles</b>
	— the Christians just gathered out by their labors from among the
	heathen. As Gaius himself was a <i>Gentile</i>
	convert, “the Gentiles” here must mean <i>the
	converts just made from the heathen,</i>
	the Gentiles to whom they had <i>gone
	forth.</i>
	It would have been inexpedient to have taken aught (the <i>Greek</i>
	“meden” implies, not that they <i>got</i>
	nothing, though they had desired it, but that it was of <i>their
	own choice</i>
	they <i>took
	nothing</i>)
	from the infant churches among the heathen: the case was different in
	receiving hospitality from Gaius.</p>
