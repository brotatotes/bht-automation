<p style=" "><b>I
	wrote</b>
	— The oldest manuscripts add “something”: a <i>communication,</i>
	probably, on the subject of <i>receiving
	the brethren</i>
	with brotherly love (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	That Epistle was not designed by the Spirit for the universal Church,
	or else it would have been preserved.</p>
<p style=" "><b>unto
	the church</b>
	— of which Gaius is a member.</p>
<p style=" "><b>loveth
	... pre-eminence</b>
	— through ambition. Evidently occupying a high place in the Church
	where Gaius was (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
<p style=" "><b>among
	them</b> —
	<i>over</i>
	the members of the Church.</p>
<p style=" "><b>receiveth
	us not</b>
	— virtually, namely, by not <i>receiving</i>
	with love the brethren whom we recommended to be received (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
