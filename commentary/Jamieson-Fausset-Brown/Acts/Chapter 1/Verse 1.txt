	very important statement, dividing the work of Christ into two great
	branches: the one embracing His work on earth, the other His
	subsequent work from heaven; the one in His own Person, the
	other by His Spirit; the one the "beginning," the other the
	continuance of the same work; the one complete when He sat down at
	the right hand of the Majesty on high, the other to continue till His
	second appearing; the one recorded in "The Gospels," the
	beginnings only of the other related in this book of "The
	Acts." "Hence the grand history of what Jesus did and
	taught does not conclude with His departure to the Father; but Luke
	now begins it in a higher strain; for all the subsequent labors of
	the apostles are just an exhibition of the ministry of the
	glorified Redeemer Himself because they were acting under His
	authority, and He was the principle that operated in them all"
