<p><b>began to do and teach</b>—a
	very important statement, dividing the work of Christ into two great
	branches: the one embracing His work <i>on earth,</i> the other His
	subsequent work <i>from heaven;</i> the one in His own Person, the
	other by His Spirit; the one the "beginning," the other the
	continuance of the same work; the one complete when He sat down at
	the right hand of the Majesty on high, the other to continue till His
	second appearing; the one recorded in "The Gospels," the
	<i>beginnings</i> only of the other related in this book of "The
	Acts." "Hence the grand history of what Jesus did and
	taught does not conclude with His departure to the Father; but Luke
	now begins it in a higher strain; for all the subsequent labors of
	the apostles are just an exhibition of <i>the ministry of the
	glorified Redeemer Himself</i> because they were acting under His
	authority, and He was the principle that operated in them all"
