<p><b>11. Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
	gazing up into heaven,</b> c.—"as if your now glorified Head
	were gone from you never to return: He is coming again not another,
	but 'this same Jesus'; and 'as ye have seen Him go, in the like
	manner shall He come'—as <i>personally,</i> as <i>visibly,</i> as
	<i>gloriously;</i> and let the joyful expectation of this coming
	swallow up the sorrow of that departure."
