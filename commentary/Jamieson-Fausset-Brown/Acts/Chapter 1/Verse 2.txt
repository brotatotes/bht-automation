	It is worthy of notice that nowhere else are such communications of
	the risen Redeemer said to have been given "through the Holy
	Ghost." In general, this might have been said of all He uttered
	and all He did in His official character; for it was for this very
	end that God "gave not the Spirit by measure unto Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:44-42.24.49- :">Luke 24:44-42.24.49- :</span>). But after His resurrection, as if to signify the new
	relation in which He now stood to the Church, He signalized His first
	meeting with the assembled disciples by <i>breathing</i> on them
	(immediately after dispensing to them His <i>peace</i>) and saying,
	"<i>Receive ye the Holy Ghost</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:44-42.24.49- :">Luke 24:44-42.24.49- :</span>) thus anticipating the donation of the Spirit from His
	hands (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:44-42.24.49- :">Luke 24:44-42.24.49- :</span>); and on
	the same principle His parting charges are here said to have been
	given "through the Holy Ghost," as if to mark that He was
	now all redolent with the Spirit; that what had been husbanded,
	during His suffering work, for His own necessary uses, had now been
	set free, was already overflowing from Himself to His disciples, and
	needed but His ascension and glorification to flow all forth. (See on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:44-42.24.49- :">Luke 24:44-42.24.49- :</span>.)</p>
