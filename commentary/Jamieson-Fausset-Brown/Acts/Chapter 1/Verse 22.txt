<p><b>22. Beginning from the baptism of
	John</b>—by whom our Lord was not only Himself baptized, but first
	officially announced and introduced to his own disciples. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto that same day when he
	was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of
	his resurrection</b>—How clearly is the primary office of the
	apostles here expressed: (1) to testify, from personal observation,
	to the one great fact of "the resurrection of the Lord Jesus";
	(2) to show how this glorified His whole previous life, of which they
	were constant observers, and established His divine claims.</p>
