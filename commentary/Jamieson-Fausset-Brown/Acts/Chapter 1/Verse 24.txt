<p><b>24. prayed and said, Thou, Lord,</b>
	c.—"The word 'Lord,' placed absolutely, denotes in the New
	Testament almost universally THE SON and the words, 'Show whom Thou
	hast chosen,' are decisive. The apostles are just Christ's
	messengers: It is He that sends them, and of Him they bear witness.
	Here, therefore, we have the first example of a prayer offered to the
	exalted Redeemer; furnishing indirectly the strongest proof of His
	divinity" [OLSHAUSEN].
