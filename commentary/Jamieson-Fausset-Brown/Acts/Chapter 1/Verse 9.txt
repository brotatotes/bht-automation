	their sight.</i>" So Elijah, "If thou <i>see me</i> when I
	am taken from thee" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); "And Elisha <i>saw</i> it" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.)</p>
