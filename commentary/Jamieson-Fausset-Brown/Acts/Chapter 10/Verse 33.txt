<p><b>33. we are all here present before
	God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God</b>â€”Beautiful
	expression of entire preparedness to receive the expected divine
	teaching through the lips of this heaven-commissioned teacher, and
	delightful encouragement to Peter to give free utterance to what was
	doubtless already on his lips!</p>
