<p><b>34, 35. Peter opened his mouth</b>—(See
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Of a truth I perceive</b>—that
	is, "I have it now demonstrated before mine eyes." 
	</p>
<p><b>that God is no respecter of
	persons</b>—Not, "I see there is no capricious <i>favoritism</i>
	with God," for Peter would never imagine such a thing; but (as
	the next clause shows), "I see that God has respect only to
	<i>personal character and state</i> in the acceptance of men,
	national and ecclesiastical distinctions being of no account."</p>
