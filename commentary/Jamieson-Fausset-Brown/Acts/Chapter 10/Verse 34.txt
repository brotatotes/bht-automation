34, 35. Peter opened his mouth—(See
	on  :-). 
	Of a truth I perceive—that
	is, "I have it now demonstrated before mine eyes." 
	that God is no respecter of
	persons—Not, "I see there is no capricious favoritism
	with God," for Peter would never imagine such a thing; but (as
	the next clause shows), "I see that God has respect only to
	personal character and state in the acceptance of men,
	national and ecclesiastical distinctions being of no account."
