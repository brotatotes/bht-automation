<p><b>35. But in every nation</b>—not
	(observe), in every <i>religion;</i> according to a common distortion
	of these words. 
	</p>
<p><b>he that feareth him, and
	worketh righteousness</b>—This being the well-known phraseology of
	the Old Testament in describing the truly godly man, within the pale
	of revealed religion, it cannot be alleged that Peter meant it to
	denote a merely <i>virtuous</i> character, in the heathen sense; and
	as Peter had learned enough, from the messengers of Cornelius and
	from his own lips, to convince him that the whole religious character
	of this Roman officer had been moulded in the Jewish faith, there can
	be no doubt that the apostle intended to describe exactly such
	saintship—in its internal spirituality and external fruitfulness—as
	God had already pronounced to be genuine and approved. And since to
	such "He giveth more grace," according to the law of His
	Kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:6">James 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:29">Matthew 25:29</span>),
	He sends Peter, not to be the instrument of his <i>conversion,</i> as
	this is very frequently called, but simply to "show him the way
	of God more perfectly," as before to the devout Ethiopian
	eunuch.</p>
