<p><b>14. Who shall tell thee words
	whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved</b>â€”The historian
	makes the angel express this much more generally (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). So also the subsequent report of it by the deputies and by
	Cornelius himself to Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:22">Acts 10:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:32">Acts 10:32</span>). But as Peter tarried
	with Cornelius certain days, and they doubtless talked over the
	wonderful scene together, perhaps this fuller and richer form of what
	the angel said was given to Peter; or the apostle himself may have
	<i>expressed</i> what the angel certainly <i>designed</i> by
	directing them to send for him. Observe, "salvation" is
	here made to hang upon "<i>words,</i>" that is, the Gospel
	message concerning Christ. But on the "salvation" of
	Cornelius, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>.
	On that of his "house," see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1- :">Acts 11:1- :</span>.</p>
