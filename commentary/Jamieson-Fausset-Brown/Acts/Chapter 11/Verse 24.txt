24. For he was a good man—The
	sense of "good" here is plainly "large-hearted,"
	"liberal-minded," rising above narrow Jewish sectarianism,
	and that because, as the historian adds, he was "full of the
	Holy Ghost and of faith." 
	and much people were added
	unto the Lord—This proceeding of Barnabas, so full of wisdom,
	love, and zeal, was blessed to the great increase of the Christian
	community in that important city. 
	Acts 11:25;
	Acts 11:26. BARNABAS,
	FINDING THE WORK
	IN ANTIOCH TOO
	MUCH FOR HIM,
	GOES TO TARSUS
	FOR SAUL—THEY
	LABOR THERE
	TOGETHER FOR A WHOLE
	YEAR WITH MUCH
	SUCCESS, AND ANTIOCH
	BECOMES THE HONORED
	BIRTHPLACE OF THE TERM
	CHRISTIAN.
