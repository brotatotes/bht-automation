<p><b>25. Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus
	for to seek Saul</b>—Of course, this was after the hasty despatch
	of Saul to Tarsus, no doubt by Barnabas himself among others, to
	escape the fury of the Jews at Jerusalem. And as Barnabas was the
	first to take the converted persecutor by the hand and procure his
	recognition as a disciple by the brethren at Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), so he alone seems at that early period to have discerned
	in him those peculiar endowments by virtue of which he was afterwards
	to eclipse all others. Accordingly, instead of returning to
	Jerusalem, to which, no doubt, he sent accounts of his proceedings
	from time to time, finding that the mine in Antioch was rich in
	promise and required an additional and powerful hand to work, he
	leaves it for a time, takes a journey to Tarsus, "finds Saul"
	(seemingly implying—not that he lay hid [BENGEL],
	but that he was engaged at the time in some preaching circuit—see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1">Acts 11:1</span>), and returns with
	him to Antioch. Nor were his hopes disappointed. As co-pastors, for
	the time being, of the Church there, they so labored that the Gospel,
	even in that great and many-sided community, achieved for itself a
	name which will live and be gloried in as long as this world lasts,
	as the symbol of all that is most precious to the fallen family of
	man:—"<i>The disciples were called</i> CHRISTIANS
	<i>first in Antioch.</i>" This name originated not within, but
	without, the Church; not with their <i>Jewish</i> enemies, by whom
	they were styled "Nazarenes" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:1- :">Acts 11:1- :</span>), but with the <i>heathen</i> in Antioch, and (as the form
	of the word shows) with the <i>Romans,</i> not the <i>Greeks</i>
	there [OLSHAUSEN]. It was
	not at first used in a good sense (as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:28">Acts 26:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:16">1 Peter 4:16</span> show), though hardly
	framed out of contempt (as DE
	WETTE, BAUMGARTEN,
	c.) but as it was a noble testimony to the light in which the Church
	regarded Christ—honoring Him as their only Lord and Saviour,
	dwelling continually on His name, and glorying in it—so it was felt
	to be too apposite and beautiful to be allowed to die.
