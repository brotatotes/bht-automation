<p><b>1-3. Herod the king</b>â€”grandson
	of Herod the Great, and son of Aristobulus. He at this time ruled
	over all his father's dominions. PALEY
	has remarked the accuracy of the historian here. For thirty years
	before this there was no king at Jerusalem exercising supreme
	authority over Judea, nor was there ever afterwards, save during the
	three last years of Herod's life, within which the transactions
	occurred.</p>
