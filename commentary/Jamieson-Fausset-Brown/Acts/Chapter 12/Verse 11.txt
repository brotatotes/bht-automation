	himself—recovered from his bewilderment, and had time to look
	back upon all the steps that had followed each other in such rapid
	succession.

	the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me, &c.—another
	evidence that Peter expected nothing but to seal his testimony with
	his blood on this occasion.
