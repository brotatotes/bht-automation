<p><b>17. But he, beckoning . . . with his
	hand to hold their peace</b>—a lively touch this. In the hubbub of
	joyful and wondering interrogatories there might mingle reflections,
	thrown out by one against another, for holding out so long against
	the testimony of Rhoda; while the emotion of the apostle's own spirit
	would be too deep and solemn to take part in such demonstrations or
	utter a word till, with his hand, he had signified his wish for
	perfect silence.

<p><b>Go show these things unto
	James and to the brethren</b>—Whether James the son of Alpheus, one
	of the Twelve, usually known as "James the Less," and
	"James the Lord's brother" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), were the same person; and if not, whether the James here
	referred to was the former or the latter, critics are singularly
	divided, and the whole question is one of the most difficult. To us,
	it appears that there are strong reasons for thinking that they were
	<i>not</i> the same person, and that the one here meant, and
	throughout the Acts, is <i>the apostle</i> James. (But on this more
	hereafter). James is singled out, because he had probably begun to
	take the oversight of the Church in Jerusalem, which we afterwards
	find him exercising (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>And he departed, and went
	into another place</b>—according to his Lord's express command (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). When told, on a former miraculous liberation from prison,
	to go and speak unto the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), he did it; but in this case to present himself in public
	would have been to tempt God by rushing upon certain destruction.</p>
