<p><b>2. killed James . . . with the
	sword</b>â€”beheaded him; a most ignominious mode of punishment,
	according to the Jews. Blessed martyr! Thou hast indeed "drunk
	of thy Lord's cup, and hast been baptized with his baptism."

	loss this would be to the Church; for though nothing is known of him
	beyond what we read in the Gospels, the place which he had as one of
	the three whom the Lord admitted to His closest intimacy would lead
	the Church to look up to him with a reverence and affection which
	even their enemies would come to hear of. They could spring only upon
	one more prized victim; and flushed with their first success, they
	prevail upon Herod to seize him also.</p>
