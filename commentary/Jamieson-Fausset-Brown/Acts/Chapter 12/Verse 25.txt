<p><b>25. Barnabas and Saul returned from
	Jerusalem</b>—where, it thus appears, they had remained during all
	this persecution. 
	</p>
<p><b>when they had fulfilled their
	ministry</b>—or service; that mentioned on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:29">Acts 11:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:30">Acts 11:30</span>.

<p><b>took with them John . . .
	Mark</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:1">Acts 12:1</span>),
	not to be confounded with the second Evangelist, as is often done. As
	his uncle was Barnabas, so his spiritual father was Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:1- :">Acts 12:1- :</span>).</p>
