6. And when Herod would have brought
	him forth—"was going to bring him forth." 
	the same night—but a
	few hours before the intended execution. Thus long were the disciples
	kept waiting; their prayers apparently unavailing, and their faith,
	as would seem from the sequel, waxing feeble. Such, however, is the
	"law" of God's procedure ( :- and see on  :-). 
	Peter was sleeping between
	two soldiers, bound with two chains—Roman prisoners had a chain
	fastened at one end to the wrist of their fight hand, and at the
	other to the wrist of a soldier's left hand, leaving the right arm of
	the keeper free in case of any attempt to escape. For greater
	security the prisoner was sometimes, as here, chained to two
	soldiers, one on each side. (See  :-.) Ye think your prey secure, bloodthirsty priests and thou
	obsequious tyrant who, to "please the Jews," hast shut in
	this most eminent of the servants of Christ within double gates,
	guarded by double sentinels, while double keepers and double chains
	seem to defy all rescue! So thought the chief priests, who "made
	the sepulchre of the Lord sure, sealing the stone and setting a
	watch." But "He that sitteth in heaven shall laugh at you."
	Meanwhile, "Peter is sleeping!" In a few hours he expects a
	stingless death; "neither counts he his life dear unto him, so
	that he may finish his course with joy and the ministry which he has
	received of the Lord Jesus." In this frame of spirit he has
	dropped asleep, and lies the picture of peace.
