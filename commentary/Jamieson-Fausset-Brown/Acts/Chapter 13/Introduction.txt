<p>The first seven chapters of this

	five (chapters eight through twelve), <i>The Church in Transition
	from Jews to Gentiles;</i> and the last sixteen (chapters thirteen
	through twenty-eight), <i>The Church among the Gentiles</i>
	[BAUMGARTEN]. "Though
	Christianity had already spread beyond the limits of Palestine, still
	the Church continued a stranger to <i>formal</i> missionary effort.
	Casual occurrences, particularly the persecution at Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), had hitherto brought about the diffusion of the Gospel. It
	was from Antioch that teachers were first sent forth with the
	definite purpose of spreading Christianity, and organizing churches,
	with regular institutions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>)" [OLSHAUSEN].</p>
