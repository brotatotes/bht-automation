1. there were . . . certain
	prophets—(See on Acts 13:1).
	and teachers; as Barnabas,
	c.—implying that there were others there, besides but, according to
	what appears the true reading, the meaning is simply that those here
	mentioned were in the Church at Antioch as prophets and teachers. 
	Simeon . . . Niger—of
	whom nothing is known. 
	Lucius of Cyrene— (Acts 13:1- :). He is mentioned, in Acts 13:1- :, as one of Paul's kinsmen. 
	Manaen—or Menahem, the
	name of one of the kings of Israel (Acts 13:1- :). 
	which had been brought up
	with—or, the foster brother of. 
	Herod the tetrarch—that
	is, Antipas, who was himself "brought up with a certain private
	person at Rome" [JOSEPHUS,
	Antiquities, 17.1,3]. How differently did these two foster
	brothers turn out—the one, abandoned to a licentious life and
	stained with the blood of the most distinguished of God's prophets,
	though not without his fits of reformation and seasons of remorse;
	the other, a devoted disciple of the Lord Jesus and prophet of the
	Church at Antioch! But this is only what may be seen in every age:
	"Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in Thy sight.' If the
	courtier, whose son, at the point of death, was healed by our Lord
	(John 4:46) was of Herod's
	establishment, while Susanna's husband was his steward (John 4:46- :), his foster brother's becoming a Christian and a prophet is
	something remarkable. 
	and Saul—last of all,
	but soon to become first. Henceforward this book is almost
	exclusively occupied with him; and his impress on the New Testament,
	on Christendom, and on the world is paramount.
