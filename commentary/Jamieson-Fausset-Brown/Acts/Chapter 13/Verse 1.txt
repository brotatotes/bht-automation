<p><b>Herod the tetrarch</b>—that
	is, Antipas, who was himself "brought up with a certain private
	person at Rome" [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 17.1,3]. How differently did these two foster
	brothers turn out—the one, abandoned to a licentious life and
	stained with the blood of the most distinguished of God's prophets,
	though not without his fits of reformation and seasons of remorse;
	the other, a devoted disciple of the Lord Jesus and prophet of the
	Church at Antioch! But this is only what may be seen in every age:
	"Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in Thy sight.' If the
	courtier, whose son, at the point of death, was healed by our Lord
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46">John 4:46</span>) was of Herod's
	establishment, while Susanna's husband was his steward (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:46- :">John 4:46- :</span>), his foster brother's becoming a Christian and a prophet is
	something remarkable. 
	</p>
<p><b>and Saul</b>—last of all,
	but soon to become first. Henceforward this book is almost
	exclusively occupied with him; and his impress on the New Testament,
	on Christendom, and on the world is paramount.</p>
