<p><b>13. they came to Perga in
	Pamphylia</b>—The distance from Paphos to Attalia, on the Gulf of
	Pamphylia (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>),
	sailing in a northwest direction, is not much greater than from
	Seleucia to Salamis on the east. Perga was the metropolis of
	Pamphylia, on the river Cestrus, and about seven miles inland from
	Attalia.

<p><b>and John departing from them
	returned to Jerusalem</b>—As Paul afterwards peremptorily refused
	to take Mark with him on his second missionary journey, because he
	"had departed [or 'fallen off'] from them and had not gone with
	them to the work" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:38">Acts 15:38</span>),
	there can be no doubt that he had either wearied of it or been
	deterred by the prospect of the dangers which lay before him. (But
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>, &amp;c.).</p>
