<p><b>20. after that he gave . . . judges
	. . . about the space of four hundred and fifty years</b>â€”As this
	appears to contradict <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:1">1 Kings 6:1</span>,
	various solutions have been proposed. Taking the words as they stand
	in the <i>Greek,</i> thus, "after that, by the space of four
	hundred fifty years, He gave judges," the meaning may be, that
	about four hundred fifty years elapsed from the time of the covenant
	with Abraham <i>until</i> the period of the judges; which is
	historically correct, the word "about" showing that
	chronological exactness was not aimed at. But taking the sense to be
	as in our version, that it was the period of the judges itself which
	lasted about four hundred fifty years, this statement also will
	appear historically correct, if we include in it the interval of
	subjection to foreign powers which occurred during the period of the
	judges, and understand it to describe the whole period from the
	settlement of the tribes in Canaan to the establishment of royalty.
	Thus, from the Exodus to the building of the temple were five hundred
	ninety-two years [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 8.3.1]; deduct forty years in the wilderness;
	twenty-five years of Joshua's rule [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 5.1.29]; forty years of Saul's reign (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:1- :">1 Kings 6:1- :</span>); forty of David's and the first four years of Solomon's
	reign (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+6:1">1 Kings 6:1</span>), and there
	remain, just four hundred forty-three years; or, in round numbers,
	"about four hundred fifty years."</p>
