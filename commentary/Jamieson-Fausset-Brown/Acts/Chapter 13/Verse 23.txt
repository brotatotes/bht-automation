<p><b>23-25. Of this man's seed hath God,
	according to . . . promise, raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus</b>—The
	emphasis on this statement lies: (1) in the <i>seed</i> from which
	Christ sprang—David's—and the <i>promise</i> to that effect,
	which was thus fulfilled; (2) on the <i>character</i> in which this
	promised Christ was given of God—"a SAVIOUR."
	His personal name "JESUS"
	is emphatically added, as designed to express that very character.
