<p><b>29. they took him down . . . and
	laid him in a sepulchre</b>â€”Though the burial of Christ was an act
	of honor and love to Him by the disciples to whom the body was
	committed, yet since His enemies looked after it and obtained a guard
	of soldiers to keep watch over it as the remains of their own victim,
	the apostle regards this as the last manifestation on their part of
	enmity to the Saviour, that they might see how God laughed all their
	precautions to scorn by "raising Him from the dead."</p>
