<p><b>33. God hath fulfilled the
	same</b>—"hath completely fulfilled." 
	</p>
<p><b>in that he hath raised up
	Jesus again</b>—literally, "raised up"; but the meaning
	is (notwithstanding the contrary opinion of many excellent
	interpreters) "<i>from the dead</i>"; as the context
	plainly shows. 
	</p>
<p><b>as it is written in the
	second psalm</b>—in many manuscripts "the first Psalm";
	what we call the first being regarded by the ancient Jews as only an
	introduction to the Psalter, which was considered to begin with the
	second. 
	</p>
<p><b>this day have I begotten
	thee</b>—As the apostle in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>
	regards the resurrection of Christ merely as the <i>manifestation</i>
	of a prior Sonship, which he afterwards (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4- :">Romans 1:4- :</span>) represents as <i>essential,</i> it is plain that this is
	his meaning here. (Such <i>declarative</i> meaning of the verb "to
	be" is familiar to every reader of the Bible). See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4- :">Romans 1:4- :</span>, "So shall ye be," that is, <i>be seen</i> to be
	"My disciples." It is against the whole sense of the New
	Testament to ascribe the <i>origin</i> of Christ's Sonship to His
	resurrection.</p>
