<p><b>34-37. now no more to return to
	corruption</b>—that is, to the grave where death reigns; and
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:9">Romans 6:9</span>, "Christ

<p><b>I will give you the sure

	The word rendered "mercies" is peculiar, denoting the
	<i>sanctity</i> of them, as comprehending the whole riches of the new
	covenant; while the other word, "sure," points to the
	<i>certainty</i> with which they would, through David's Seed, be at
	length all substantiated. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:3- :">Isaiah 55:3- :</span>. But how do these words prove the resurrection of Christ?
	"They presuppose it; for since an eternal kingdom was promised
	to David, the Ruler of this kingdom could not remain under the power
	of death. But to strengthen the indefinite prediction by one more
	definite, the apostle adduces <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:3- :">Isaiah 55:3- :</span>, of which Peter had given the same explanation (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:3- :">Isaiah 55:3- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:30">Acts 2:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:31">Acts 2:31</span>),
	both apostles denying the possibility of its proper reference to
