39. by him all that believe are
	justified from all things—The sense requires that a pause in
	the sentence be made here: "By him the believer is absolved from
	all charges of the law." What follows, 
	from which ye could not be
	justified by the law of Moses—is not an exceptional but
	an explanatory clause. The meaning is not, "Though the
	law justifies from many things, it cannot justify from all things,
	but Christ makes up all deficiencies"; but the meaning is, "By
	Christ the believer is justified from all things, whereas the law
	justifies from nothing." (Note.—The deeper sense of
	justification, the positive side of it, is reserved for the
	Epistles, addressed to the justified themselves: and whereas it is
	the resurrection of Christ here, and throughout the Acts
	chiefly, which is dwelt on, because the first thing in order to bring
	peace to the guilty through Christ was to establish His Messiahship
	by His resurrection, in the Epistles to believers His death as
	the way of reconciliation is fully unfolded).
