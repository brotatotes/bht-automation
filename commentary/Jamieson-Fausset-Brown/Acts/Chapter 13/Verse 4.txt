	and five from the Mediterranean shore, on the river Orontes.

<p><b>thence sailed to Cyprus</b>—whose
	high mountain summits are easily seen in clear weather from the coast
	[COLONEL CHESNEY
	in HOWSON]. "Four
	reasons may have induced them to turn in first to this island: (1)
	Its nearness to the mainland; (2) It was the native place of
	Barnabas, and since the time when Andrew found his brother Simon, and
	brought him to Jesus, and "Jesus loved Martha, and her sister,
	and Lazarus," family ties had not been without effect on the
	progress of the Gospel. (3) It could not be unnatural to suppose that
	the truth would be welcomed in Cyprus when brought by Barnabas and
	his kinsman Mark, to their own connections or friends. The Jews were
	numerous in Salamis. By sailing to that city, they were following the
	track of the synagogues; and though their mission was chiefly to the
	Gentiles, their surest course for reaching them was through the
	proselytes and Hellenizing Jews. (4) Some of the Cypriotes were
	already Christians. Indeed, no one place out of Palestine, except
	Antioch, had been so honorably associated with the work of successful
	evangelization" [HOWSON].</p>
