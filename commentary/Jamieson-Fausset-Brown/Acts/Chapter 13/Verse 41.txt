41. ye will not believe though a man
	declare it unto youâ€”that is, even on unexceptionable testimony.
	The words, from Habakkuk 1:5, were
	originally a merciful but fruitless warning against the approaching
	destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans and the Babylonish
	captivity. As such nothing could more fitly describe the more awful
	calamity impending over the generation which the apostle addressed.
