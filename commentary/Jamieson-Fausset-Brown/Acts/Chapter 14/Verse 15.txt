15. We . . . are men of like
	passions, &c.—How unlike either imposture or enthusiasm is
	this, and how high above all self-seeking do these men of Christ show
	themselves to be! 
	unto the living God—This
	is the most glorious and distinctive of all the names of God. It is
	the familiar phraseology of the Old Testament. which, in such
	contrast with all that is to be found within the literature of
	heathenism, is shown to be, with its sequel, the New Testament, the
	one Book of the true religion. 
	who made heaven, and earth,
	and the sea, and all . . . therein—This idea of creation,
	utterly unknown alike to rude and to cultivated heathenism, would not
	only define what was meant by "the living God," but open up
	a new world to the more thoughtful part of the audience.
