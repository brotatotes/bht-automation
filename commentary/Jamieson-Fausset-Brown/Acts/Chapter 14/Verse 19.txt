<p><b>19. came thither </b><i><b>certain</b></i><b>
	Jews from Antioch and Iconium</b>—Furious zeal that would travel so
	far to counteract the missionaries of the Cross! 
	</p>
<p><b>persuaded the people</b>—"the
	multitudes." 
	</p>
<p><b>and having stoned Paul</b>—(See
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:1">Acts 14:1</span>). Barnabas they seem
	to have let alone; Paul, as the prominent actor and speaker, being
	the object of all their rage. The words seem to imply that it was the
	Jews who did this; and no doubt they took the lead (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:1- :">Acts 14:1- :</span>), but it was the act of the instigated and fickle
	multitudes along with them. 
	</p>
<p><b>drew </b><i><b>him</b></i><b>
	out of the city</b>—By comparing this with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:1- :">Acts 14:1- :</span> it will be seen that the Jews were the chief actors in this
	scene.</p>
