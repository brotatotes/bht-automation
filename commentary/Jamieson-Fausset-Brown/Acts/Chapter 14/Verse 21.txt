21, 22. they returned . . . to
	Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, confirming the souls, &c.â€”At
	Derbe, Paul was not far from the well-known pass which leads down
	from the central tableland to Cilicia and Tarsus. But his thoughts
	did not center in an earthly home. He revisited the places where he
	had been reviled and persecuted, but where he had left as sheep in
	the desert the disciples whom his Master had enabled him to gather.
	They needed building up and strengthening in the faith, comforting in
	the midst of their inevitable suffering, and fencing round by
	permanent institutions. Undaunted therefore by the dangers that
	awaited them, our missionaries return to them, using words of
	encouragement which none but the founders of a true religion would
	have ventured to address to their earliest converts, that "we
	can only enter into the kingdom of God by passing through much
	tribulation" [HOWSON].
