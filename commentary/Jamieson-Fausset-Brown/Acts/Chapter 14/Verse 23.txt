23, 24. when they had ordained them
	elders—literally, "chosen by show of hands." But as
	that would imply that this was done by the apostles' own hands, many
	render the word, as in our version, "ordained." Still, as
	there is no evidence in the New Testament that the word had then lost
	its proper meaning, as this is beyond doubt its meaning in  :-, and as there is indisputable evidence that the concurrence
	of the people was required in all elections to sacred office in the
	earliest ages of the Church, it is perhaps better to understand the
	words to mean, "when they had made a choice of elders,"
	that is, superintended such choice on the part of the disciples. 
	and had prayed with
	fasting—literally, "fastings," thus setting them
	solemnly apart. This last clause confirms our interpretation of the
	former. For if "ordination" was by prayer and fasting (see
	Acts 13:3), why should it be said
	they first "ordained elders," and after that "prayed
	with fasting?" Whereas if the first clause refer to the choice
	and the second to the ordination, all is natural. 
	they commended—"committed"
	them—that is, all these
	churches.
