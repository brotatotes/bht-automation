<p><b>6. unto Lystra and Derbe</b>—the
	one some twenty miles to the south, the other some sixty miles to the
	east of Iconium, somewhere near the bases of what are called the
	Black Mountains and the roots of Mount Taurus; but their exact
	position has not yet been discovered.

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. AT LYSTRA
	PAUL HEALING
	A CRIPPLE, THE
	PEOPLE ARE
	SCARCE RESTRAINED
	FROM SACRIFICING TO
	THEM AS GODS,
	BUT AFTERWARDS,
	THEIR MINDS
	BEING POISONED,
	THEY STONE
	PAUL, LEAVING
	HIM FOR DEAD—WITHDRAWING
	TO DERBE, THEY
	PREACH AND TEACH
	THERE.

<p>There being no mention of the
	synagogue at Lystra, it is probable there were too few Jews there to
	form one.</p>
