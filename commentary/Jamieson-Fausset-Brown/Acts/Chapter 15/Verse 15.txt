<p><b>15. to this agree the words of the
	prophets</b>â€”generally; but those of Amos (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) are specified (nearly as in the <i>Septuagint version</i>).
	The point of the passage lies in the predicted purpose of God, under
	the new economy, that "the heathen" or "Gentiles"
	should be "called by His name," or have "His name
	called upon them." By the "building again of the fallen
	tabernacle of David," or restoring its decayed splendor, is
	meant that only and glorious recovery which it was to experience
	under David's "son and Lord."</p>
