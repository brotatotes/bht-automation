20. But . . . that they abstain from
	pollutions of idols—that is, things polluted by having been
	offered in sacrifice to idols. The heathen were accustomed to give
	away or sell portions of such animals. From such food James would
	enjoin the Gentile converts to abstain, lest it should seem to the
	Jews that they were not entirely weaned from idolatry. 
	and from fornication—The
	characteristic sin of heathendom, unblushingly practiced by all ranks
	and classes, and the indulgence of which on the part of the Gentile
	converts would to Jews, whose Scriptures branded it as an abomination
	of the heathen, proclaim them to be yet joined to their old idols. 
	and from things
	strangled—which had the blood in them. 
	and from blood—in every
	form, as peremptorily forbidden to the Jews, and the eating of which,
	therefore, on the part of the Gentile converts, would shock their
	prejudices. See on Acts 15:1.
