	pollutions of idols</b>—that is, things polluted by having been
	offered in sacrifice to idols. The heathen were accustomed to give
	away or sell portions of such animals. From such food James would

	Jews that they were not entirely weaned from idolatry.

	converts would to Jews, whose Scriptures branded it as an abomination
	of the heathen, proclaim them to be yet joined to their old idols.

<p><b>and from things
	strangled</b>—which had the blood in them.

<p><b>and from blood</b>—in every
	form, as peremptorily forbidden to the Jews, and the eating of which,
	therefore, on the part of the Gentile converts, would shock their
	prejudices. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:1">Acts 15:1</span>.</p>
