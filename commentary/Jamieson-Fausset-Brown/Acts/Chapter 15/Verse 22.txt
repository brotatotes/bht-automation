22, 23. Judas surnamed
	Barsabas—therefore not the apostle "Judas the brother of
	James" (Acts 1:13), surnamed
	"Thaddeus" (Matthew 10:3);
	nor can it be shown that he was a brother of "Joseph called
	Barsabas" (Acts 1:23). But
	nothing is known of him beyond what is here said. 
	and Silas—the same as
	"Silvanus" in the Epistles. He became Paul's companion on
	his second missionary journey (Acts 1:23- :). 
	chief men among the
	brethren—selected purposely as such, to express the honor in
	which they held the church at Antioch, and the deputies they had sent
	to the council, and, as the matter affected all Gentile converts, to
	give weight to the written decision of this important assembly. They
	were "prophets," Acts 1:23- : (and see on Acts 15:1),
	and as such doubtless their eminence in the church at Jerusalem had
	been obtained.
