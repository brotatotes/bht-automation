<p><b>23. And they wrote . . . by
	them</b>—This is the first mention in the New Testament history of
	<i>writing</i> as an element in its development. And the combination
	here of written and oral transmission of an important decision
	reminds us of the first occasion of writing mentioned in the Old
	Testament, where a similar combination occurs (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). But whereas <i>there</i> it is the deep <i>difference</i>
	between Israel and the Gentiles which is proclaimed, here it is the
	<i>obliteration of that difference</i> through faith in the Lord
	Jesus [BAUMGARTEN]. 
	</p>
<p><b>greeting</b>—The only other
	place in the New Testament where this word occurs (except in the
	letter of Lysias, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:26">Acts 23:26</span>) is
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>, which seems to show
	that both letters were drawn up by the same hand [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>the Gentiles in Antioch, and
	Syria, and Cilicia</b>—showing that churches then existed in
	Cilicia as well as Syria, which owed their existence, in all
	likelihood, to Paul's labors during the interval between his return
	to Tarsus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30">Acts 9:30</span>) and his
	departure in company with Barnabas for Antioch (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30- :">Acts 9:30- :</span>).</p>
