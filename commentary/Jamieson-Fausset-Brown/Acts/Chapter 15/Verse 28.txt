<p><b>28, 29. For it seemed good to the

	setting His seal on the decision come to: the other, the external
	ecclesiastical authority devoutly embracing, expressing, and
	conveying to the churches that decision:—a great principle this for

<p><b>to lay upon you no greater

	prohibitions, and of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:20">Acts 15:20</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:21">Acts 15:21</span>, implies that they were
	designed as concessions to Jewish feelings on the part of the Gentile
	converts, and not as things which were all of unchanging obligation.
	The only cause for hesitation arises from "fornication"
	being mixed up with the other three things; which has led many to
	regard the whole as permanently prohibited. But the remarks on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:21- :">Acts 15:21- :</span> may clear this (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:21- :">Acts 15:21- :</span>). The then state of heathen society in respect of all the
	four things seems the reason for so mixing them up.</p>
