<p><b>36. And some days after</b>—How
	long is a matter of conjecture.

<p><b>Paul said to Barnabas, Let us
	go again and visit our brethren</b>—the true reading is, "the
	brethren." 
	</p>
<p><b>in every city where we have
	preached . . . and see how they do</b>—whether they were advancing
	or declining, &amp;c.: a pattern for churches and successful
	missionaries in every age. ("Reader, how stands it with thee?")
	[BENGEL]. "Paul felt
	that he was not called to spend a peaceful, though laborious life at
	Antioch, but that his true work was far off among the Gentiles."
	We notice here, for the first time, a trace of that tender solicitude
	for his converts, that earnest longing to see their faces, which
	appears in the letters which he wrote afterwards, as one of the most
	remarkable and attractive features of his character. He thought,
	doubtless, of the Pisidians and Lycaonians, as he thought afterwards
	at Athens and Corinth of the Thessalonians, from whom he had been
	lately "taken in presence, not in heart, night and day praying
	exceedingly that he might see their face and perfect that which was
	lacking in their faith" [HOWSON].</p>
