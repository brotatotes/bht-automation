	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>), as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3- :">Acts 13:3- :</span>. It does not follow from the historian's silence that
	Barnabas was not so recommended, too; for this is the last mention of
	Barnabas in the history, whose sole object now is to relate the
	proceedings of Paul. Nor does it seem quite fair (with DE
	WETTE, MEYER,
	HOWSON, ALFORD,
	HACKET, WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON, &amp;c.) to
	conclude from this that the Church at Antioch took that marked way of
	showing their sympathy with Paul in opposition to Barnabas.</p>
