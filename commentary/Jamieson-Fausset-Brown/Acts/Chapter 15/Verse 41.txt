41. and he went through Syria and
	Cilicia, confirming the churches—"It is very likely that
	Paul and Barnabas made a deliberate and amicable arrangement to
	divide the region of their first mission between them; Paul taking
	the continental, and Barnabas the insular, part of the
	proposed visitation. If Barnabas visited Salamis and Paphos, and if
	Paul (travelling westward), after passing through Derbe, Lystra, and
	Iconium, went as far as Antioch in Pisidia, the whole circuit of the
	proposed visitation was actually accomplished, for it does not appear
	that any converts had been made at Perga and Attalia" [HOWSON].
	"This second missionary tour appears to have proceeded at first
	solely from the desire of visiting the churches already planted. In
	the end, however, it took a much wider sweep, for it brought the
	apostle to Europe" [OLSHAUSEN].
