<p><b>1-5. Then came he to Derbe and

	Lystra (not Derbe, as some conclude from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>named Timotheus</b>—(See on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1">Acts 16:1</span>). As Paul styles him
	"his own son in the faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:1- :">Acts 16:1- :</span>), he must have been gained to Christ at the apostle's first
	visit; and as Paul says he "had fully known his persecutions
	which came on him at Lystra" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:10">2 Timothy 3:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:11">2 Timothy 3:11</span>), he may have been in
	that group of disciples that surrounded the apparently lifeless body
	of the apostle outside the walls of Lystra, and that at a time of
	life when the mind receives its deepest impressions from the
	spectacle of innocent suffering and undaunted courage [HOWSON].
	His would be one of "the souls of the disciples confirmed"
	at the apostle's second visit, "exhorted to continue in the
	faith, and" warned "that we must through much tribulation
	enter into the kingdom of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:21">Acts 14:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22">Acts 14:22</span>).

<p><b>the son of a certain . . .

	grandmother Lois" descended to "his mother Eunice,"
	and thence it passed to this youth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22- :">Acts 14:22- :</span>), who "from a child knew the Holy Scriptures" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22- :">Acts 14:22- :</span>). His gifts and destination to the ministry of Christ had
	already been attested (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>); and though some ten
	years after this Paul speaks of him as still young (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14- :">1 Timothy 4:14- :</span>), "he was already well reported of by the brethren that
	were at Lystra and Iconium" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:14- :">1 Timothy 4:14- :</span>), and consequently must have been well known through all
	that quarter.
