<p><b>11, 12. Therefore loosing from
	Troas, we came</b>—literally, "ran." 
	</p>
<p><b>with a straight course</b>—that
	is, "ran before the wind." 
	</p>
<p><b>to Samothracia</b>—a lofty
	island on the Thracian coast, north from Troas, with an inclination
	westward. The wind must have set in strong from the south or
	south-southeast to bring them there so soon, as the current is strong
	in the opposite direction, and they afterwards took five days to what
	they now did in two (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:6">Acts 20:6</span>)
	[HOWSON].

<p><b>next </b><i><b>day</b></i><b>
	to Neapolis</b>—on the Macedonian, or rather Thracian, coast, about
	sixty-five miles from Samothracia, and ten from Philippi, of which it
	is the harbor.</p>
