<p><b>13. on the sabbath day</b>—the

<p><b>we went out of the
	city</b>—rather, as the true reading is, "outside of the
	(city) gate." 
	</p>
<p><b>by a river-side</b>—one of
	the small streams which gave name to the place ere the city was
	founded by Philip of Macedon.

<p><b>where prayer was wont to be
	made</b>—or a prayer-meeting held. It is plain there was no
	synagogue at Philippi (contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), the number of the Jews being small. The meeting appears to
	have consisted wholly of women, and these not all Jewish. The
	neighborhood of streams was preferred, on account of the ceremonial
	washings used on such occasions. 
	</p>
<p><b>we sat down and spake unto
	the women,</b> &amp;c.—a humble congregation, and simple manner of
	preaching. <i>But here and thus were gathered the first-fruits of
	Europe unto Christ, and they were of the female sex,</i> of whose
	accession and services honorable mention will again and again be
	made.</p>
