<p><b>14, 15. Lydia</b>—a common name
	among the Greeks and Romans. 
	</p>
<p><b>a seller of purple, of the
	city of Thyatira</b>—on the confines of Lydia and Phrygia. The
	Lydians, particularly the inhabitants of Thyatira, were celebrated
	for their dyeing, in which they inherited the reputation of the
	Tyrians. Inscriptions to this effect, yet remaining, confirm the
	accuracy of our historian. This woman appears to have been in good
	circumstances, having an establishment at Philippi large enough to
	accommodate the missionary party (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and receiving her goods from her native town. 
	</p>
<p><b>which worshipped God</b>—that
	is, was a proselyte to the Jewish faith, and as such present at this
	meeting. 
	</p>
<p><b>whose heart the Lord
	opened</b>—that is, the Lord Jesus (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:45">Luke 24:45</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:27">Matthew 11:27</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that she attended to the
	things . . . spoken by Paul</b>—"showing that the inclination
	of the heart towards the truth originates not in the will of man. The
	first disposition to turn to the Gospel is a work of grace"
	[OLSHAUSEN]. Observe here
	the place assigned to "giving attention" or "heed"
	to the truth—that species of attention which consists in having the
	whole mind engrossed with it, and in apprehending and drinking it in,
	in its vital and saving character.</p>
