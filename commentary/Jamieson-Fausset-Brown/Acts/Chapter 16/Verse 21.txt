21. And teach customs, which are not
	lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romansâ€”Here
	also there was a measure of truth; as the introduction of new gods
	was forbidden by the laws, and this might be thought to apply to any
	change of religion. But the whole charge was pure hypocrisy; for as
	these men would have let the missionaries preach what religion they
	pleased if they had not dried up the source of their gains, so they
	conceal the real cause of their rage under color of a zeal for
	religion, and law, and good order: so Acts 17:6;
	Acts 17:7; Acts 19:25;
	Acts 19:27.
