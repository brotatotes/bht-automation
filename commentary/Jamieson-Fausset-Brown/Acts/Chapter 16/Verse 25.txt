25. And at midnight Paul and Silas
	prayed and sang praises—literally, "praying, were singing
	praises"; that is, while engaged in pouring out their hearts in
	prayer, had broken forth into singing, and were hymning loud their
	joy. As the word here employed is that used to denote the Paschal
	hymn sung by our Lord and His disciples after their last Passover ( :-), and which we know to have consisted of  :-, which was chanted at that festival, it is probable
	that it was portions of the Psalms, so rich in such matter, which our
	joyous sufferers chanted forth; nor could any be more seasonable and
	inspiring to them than those very six Psalms, which every devout Jew
	would no doubt know by heart. "He giveth songs in the night"
	(Job 35:10). Though their
	bodies were still bleeding and tortured in the stocks, their spirits,
	under "the expulsive power of a new affection," rose above
	suffering, and made the prison wails resound with their song. "In
	these midnight hymns, by the imprisoned witnesses for Jesus Christ,
	the whole might of Roman injustice and violence against the Church is
	not only set at naught, but converted into a foil to set forth more
	completely the majesty and spiritual power of the Church, which as
	yet the world knew nothing of. And if the sufferings of these two
	witnesses of Christ are the beginning and the type of numberless
	martyrdoms which were to flow upon the Church from the same source,
	in like manner the unparalleled triumph of the Spirit over suffering
	was the beginning and the pledge of a spiritual power which we
	afterwards see shining forth so triumphantly and irresistibly in the
	many martyrs of Christ who were given up as a prey to the same
	imperial might of Rome" [NEANDER
	in BAUMGARTEN]. 
	and the prisoners heard
	them—literally, "were listening to them," that is,
	when the astounding events immediately to be related took place; not
	asleep, but wide awake and rapt (no doubt) in wonder at what they
	heard.
