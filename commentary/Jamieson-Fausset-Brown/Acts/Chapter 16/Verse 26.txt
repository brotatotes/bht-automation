	great earthquake—in answer, doubtless, to the prayers and
	expectations of the sufferers that, for the truth's sake and the

	were loosed—not by the
	earthquake, of course, but by a miraculous energy accompanying it. By
	this and the joyous strains which they had heard from the sufferers,
	not to speak of the change wrought on the jailer, these prisoners
	could hardly fail to have their hearts in some measure opened to the
	truth; and this part of the narrative seems the result of information
	afterwards communicated by one or more of these men.
