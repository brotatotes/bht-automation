<p><b>28. But Paul cried with a loud
	voice</b>—the better to arrest the deed. 
	</p>
<p><b>Do thyself no harm, for we
	are all here</b>—What divine calmness and self-possession! No
	elation at their miraculous liberation, or haste to take advantage of
	it; but one thought filled the apostle's mind at that moment—anxiety
	to save a fellow creature from sending himself into eternity,
	ignorant of the only way of life; and his presence of mind appears in
	the assurance which he so promptly gives to the desperate man, that
	his prisoners had none of them fled as he feared. But how, it has
	been asked by skeptical critics, could Paul in his inner prison know
	what the jailer was about to do? In many conceivable ways, without
	supposing any supernatural communication. Thus, if the jailer slept
	at the door of "the inner prison," which suddenly flew open
	when the earthquake shook the foundations of the building; if, too,
	as may easily be conceived, he uttered some cry of despair on seeing
	the doors open; and, if the clash of the steel, as the affrighted man
	drew it hastily from the scabbard, was audible but a few yards off,
	in the dead midnight stillness, increased by the awe inspired in the
	prisoners by the miracle—what difficulty is there in supposing that
	Paul, perceiving in a moment how matters stood, after crying out,
	stepped hastily to him, uttering the noble entreaty here recorded?
	Not less flat is the question, why the other liberated prisoners did
	not make their escape:—as if there were the smallest difficulty in
	understanding how, under the resistless conviction that there must be
	something supernatural in their instantaneous liberation without
	human hand, such wonder and awe should possess them as to take away
	for the time not only all desire of escape, but even all thought on
	the subject.</p>
