30. Sirs, what must I do to be
	saved?—If this question should seem in advance of any light
	which the jailer could be supposed to possess, let it be considered
	(1) that the "trembling" which came over him could not have
	arisen from any fear for the safety of his prisoners, for they were
	all there; and if it had, he would rather have proceeded to secure
	them again than leave them, to fall down before Paul and Silas. For
	the same reason it is plain that his trembling had nothing to do with
	any account he would have to render to the magistrates. Only one
	explanation of it can be given—that he had become all at once
	alarmed about his spiritual state, and that though, a moment before,
	he was ready to plunge into eternity with the guilt of self-murder on
	his head, without a thought of the sin he was committing and its
	awful consequences, his unfitness to appear before God, and his need
	of salvation, now flashed full upon his soul and drew from the depths
	of his spirit the cry here recorded. If still it be asked how it
	could take such definite shape, let it be considered (2) that the
	jailer could hardly be ignorant of the nature of the charges on which
	these men had been imprisoned, seeing they had been publicly whipped
	by order of the magistrates, which would fill the whole town with the
	facts of the case, including that strange cry of the demoniac from
	day to-day—"These men are the servants of the most high God,
	which show unto us the way of salvation"—words
	proclaiming not only the divine commission of the preachers, but the
	news of salvation they were sent to tell, the miraculous expulsion of
	the demon and the rage of her masters. All this, indeed, would go for
	nothing with such a man, until roused by the mighty earthquake which
	made the building to rock; then despair seizing him at the sight of
	the open doors, the sword of self-destruction was suddenly arrested
	by words from one of those prisoners such as he would never imagine
	could be spoken in their circumstances—words evidencing something
	divine about them. Then would flash across him the light of a new
	discovery; "That was a true cry which the Pythoness uttered,
	'These men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us
	the way of salvation! That I now must know, and from them, as
	divinely sent to me, must I learn that way of salvation!'"
	Substantially, this is the cry of every awakened sinner, though the
	degree of light and the depths of anxiety it expresses will be
	different in each case.
