<p><b>the same hour of the night,
	and washed </b><i><b>their</b></i><b> stripes</b>—in the well or
	fountain which was within or near the precincts of the prison
	[HOWSON]. The mention of
	"the same hour of the night" seems to imply that they had
	to go forth into the open air, which, unseasonable as the hour was,
	they did. These bleeding wounds had never been thought of by the
	indifferent jailer. But now, when his whole heart was opened to his
	spiritual benefactors, he cannot rest until he has done all in his
	power for their bodily relief.

<p><b>and was baptized, he and all
	his, straightway</b>—probably at the same fountain, since it took
	place "straightway"; the one washing on his part being
	immediately succeeded by the other on theirs.</p>
