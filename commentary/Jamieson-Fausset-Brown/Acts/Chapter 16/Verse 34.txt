	believed."

<p><b>in God</b>—as a converted

<p><b>with all his house</b>—the
	wondrous change on himself and the whole house filling his soul with
	joy. "This is the second house which, in the Roman city of
	Philippi, has been consecrated by faith in Jesus, and of which the
	inmates, by hospitable entertainment of the Gospel witnesses, have
	been sanctified to a new beginning of domestic life, pleasing and
	acceptable to God. The first result came to pass in consequence
	simply of the preaching of the Gospel; the second was the fruit of a
	testimony sealed and ennobled by suffering" [BAUMGARTEN].</p>
