<p><b>37. Paul said unto them</b>—to the
	sergeants who had entered the prison along with the jailer, that they
	might be able to report that the men had departed. 
	</p>
<p><b>They have beaten us
	openly</b>—The <i>publicity</i> of the injury done them, exposing
	their naked and bleeding bodies to the rude populace, was evidently
	the most stinging feature of it to the apostle's delicate feeling,
	and to this accordingly he alludes to the Thessalonians, probably a
	year after: "Even after we had suffered before, and <i>were
	shamefully entreated</i> (or 'insulted') as ye know at Philippi"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>uncondemned</b>—unconvicted
	on trial. 
	</p>
<p><b>being Romans</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2- :">1 Thessalonians 2:2- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and cast us into prison</b>—both
	illegal. Of Silas' citizenship, if meant to be included, we know
	nothing. 
	</p>
<p><b>and now do they thrust us
	out</b>—hurry us out—see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:2- :">1 Thessalonians 2:2- :</span>, <i>Greek.</i>
</p>
<p><b>privily?</b>—Mark the
	intended contrast between the <i>public</i> insult they had inflicted
	and the <i>private</i> way in which they ordered them to be off. 
	</p>
<p><b>nay verily</b>—no, indeed. 
	</p>
<p><b>but let them come themselves
	and fetch us out</b>—by open and formal act, equivalent to a public
	declaration of their innocence.</p>
