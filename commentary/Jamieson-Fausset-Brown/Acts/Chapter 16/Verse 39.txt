<p><b>39, 40. And they came</b>—in
	person. 
	</p>
<p><b>and besought </b><i><b>them</b></i><b>
</b>—not to complain of them. What a contrast this suppliant
	attitude of the preachers of Philippi to the tyrannical air with
	which they had the day before treated the preachers! (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:14">Isaiah 60:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>brought </b><i><b>them</b></i><b>
	out</b>—conducted them forth from the prison into the street, as
	insisted on. 
	</p>
<p><b>and desired</b>—"requested."
	</p>
<p><i><b>them</b></i><b> to depart
	out of the city</b>—perhaps fearing again to excite the populace.</p>
