6-8. Now when they had gone
	throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia—proceeding in a
	northwesterly direction. At this time must have been formed "the
	churches of Galatia" (Galatians 1:2;
	1 Corinthians 16:1); founded, as we learn
	from the Epistle to the Galatians (particularly 1 Corinthians 16:1- :), by the apostle Paul, and which were already in existence
	when he was on his third missionary journey, as we learn from
	Acts 18:23, where it appears
	that he was no less successful in Phrygia. Why these
	proceedings, so interesting as we should suppose, are not here
	detailed, it is not easy to say; for the various reasons suggested
	are not very satisfactory: for example, that the historian had not
	joined the party [ALFORD];
	that he was in haste to bring the apostle to Europe [OLSHAUSEN];
	that the main stream of the Church's development was from Jerusalem
	to Rome, and the apostle's labors in Phrygia and Galatia lay quite
	out of the line of that direction [BAUMGARTEN].
	and were forbidden of the
	Holy Ghost—speaking by some prophet, see on Acts 18:23- :. 
	to preach the word in
	Asia—not the great Asiatic continent, nor even the rich
	peninsula now called Asia Minor, but only so much of its western
	coast as constituted the Roman province of Asia.
