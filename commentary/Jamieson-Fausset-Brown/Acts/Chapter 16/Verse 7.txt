7. After they were come to
	Mysia—where, as being part of Roman Asia, they were forbidden
	to labor (Acts 16:8). 
	they assayed—or
	attempted 
	to go into—or, towards.
	Bithynia—to the
	northeast. 
	but the Spirit—speaking
	as before. 
	suffered them not—probably
	because, (1) Europe was ripe for the labors of this missionary party;
	and (2) other instruments were to be honored to establish the Gospel
	in the eastern regions of Asia Minor, especially the apostle Peter
	(see 1 Peter 1:1). By the end of the
	first century, as testified by PLINY
	the governor, Bithynia was filled with Christians. "This is the
	first time that the Holy Ghost is expressly spoken of as determining
	the course they were to follow in their efforts to evangelize the
	nations, and it was evidently designed to show that whereas hitherto
	the diffusion of the Gospel had been carried on in unbroken course,
	connected by natural points of junction, it was now to take a leap to
	which it could not be impelled but by an immediate and independent
	operation of the Spirit; and though primarily, this intimation of the
	Spirit was only negative, and referred but to the immediate
	neighborhood, we may certainly conclude that Paul took it for a sign
	that a new epoch was now to commence in his apostolic labors"
