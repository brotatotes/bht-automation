<p><b>16, 17. wholly given to
	idolatry</b>—"covered with idols"; meaning the city, not
	the inhabitants. Petronius, a contemporary writer at Nero's court,
	says satirically that it was easier to find a god at Athens than a
	man. This "stirred the spirit" of the apostle. "The
	first impression which the masterpieces of man's taste for art left
	on the mind of St. Paul was a revolting one, since all this majesty
	and beauty had placed itself between man and his Creator, and bound
	him the faster to his gods, who were not God. Upon the first contact,
	therefore, which the Spirit of Christ came into with the sublimest
	creations of human art, the judgment of the Holy Ghost—through
	which they have all to pass—is set up as "the strait gate,"
	and this must remain the correct standard for ever"
