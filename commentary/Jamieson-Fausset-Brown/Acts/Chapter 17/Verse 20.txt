	Epicureans—a well-known school of atheistic materialists,
	who taught that pleasure was the chief end of human existence; a
	principle which the more rational interpreted in a refined sense,
	while the sensual explained it in its coarser meaning. 
	and of the Stoics—a
	celebrated school of severe and lofty pantheists, whose
	principle was that the universe was under the law of an iron
	necessity, the spirit of which was what is called the Deity: and that

	all external circumstances and changes, is the perfection of virtue.
	While therefore the Stoical was in itself superior to the Epicurean
	system, both were alike hostile to the Gospel. "The two enemies
	it has ever had to contend with are the two ruling principles of the
	Epicureans and Stoics—Pleasure and Pride" [HOWSON].

	gods—"demons," but in the Greek (not Jewish) sense of
	"objects of worship."

	the resurrection—Not as if they thought he made these to be two
	divinities: the strange gods were Jehovah and the Risen
	Saviour, ordained to judge the world.
