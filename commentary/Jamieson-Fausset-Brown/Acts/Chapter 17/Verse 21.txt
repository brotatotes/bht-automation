<p><b>21. all the Athenians . . . spent
	their time in nothing else but to tell or hear some new
	thing</b>â€”literally, "newer thing," as if what was new
	becoming presently stale, they craved something still more new
	[BENGEL]. This lively
	description of the Athenian character is abundantly attested by their
	own writers.</p>
