23. as I passed by and beheld your
	devotions—rather, "the objects of your devotion,"
	referring, as is plain from the next words, to their works of art
	consecrated to religion. 
	I found an altar . . . To
	the—or, "an" 
	unknown god—erected,
	probably, to commemorate some divine interposition, which they were
	unable to ascribe to any known deity. That there were such altars,
	Greek writers attest; and on this the apostle skilfully fastens at
	the outset, as the text of his discourse, taking it as evidence of
	that dimness of religious conception which, in virtue of his better
	light, he was prepared to dissipate. 
	Whom therefore ye ignorantly
	worship—rather, "Whom, therefore, knowing Him not, ye
	worship," alluding to "The Unknown God." 
	him declare—announce. 
	I unto you—This is
	like none of his previous discourses, save that to the idolaters of
	Lycaonia ( :-). His subject is not, as in the synagogues, the
	Messiahship of Jesus, but THE
	LIVING GOD,
	in opposition to the materialistic and pantheistic polytheism of
	Greece, which subverted all true religion. Nor does he come with
	speculation on this profound subject—of which they
	had had enough from others—but an authoritative "announcement"
	of Him after whom they were groping not giving Him any name, however,
	nor even naming the Saviour Himself but unfolding the true character
	of both as they were able to receive it.
