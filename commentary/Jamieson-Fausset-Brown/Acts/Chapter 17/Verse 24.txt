<p><b>24, 25. God that made the world and
	all . . . therein</b>—The most profound philosophers of Greece were
	unable to conceive any real distinction between God and the universe.
	Thick darkness, therefore, behooved to rest on all their religious
	conceptions. To dissipate this, the apostle sets out with a sharp
	statement of the fact of <i>creation</i> as the central principle of
	all true religion—not less needed now, against the transcendental
	idealism of our day. 
	</p>
<p><b>seeing he is Lord</b>—or
	Sovereign. 
	</p>
<p><b>of heaven and earth</b>—holding
	in free and absolute subjection all the works of His hands; presiding
	in august royalty over them, as well as pervading them all as the
	principle of their being. How different this from the blind Force or
	Fate to which all creatures were regarded as in bondage!

<p><b>dwelleth not in temples made
	with hands</b>—This thought, so familiar to Jewish ears (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:27">1 Kings 8:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:1">Isaiah 66:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:2">Isaiah 66:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:48">Acts 7:48</span>), and so elementary to
	Christians, would serve only more sharply to define to his heathen
	audience the spirituality of that living, personal God, whom he
	"announced" to them.</p>
