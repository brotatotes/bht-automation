<p><b>26, 27. and hath made of one blood
	all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth</b>—Holding
	with the Old Testament teaching, that in the blood is the life
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+9:4">Genesis 9:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+17:11">Leviticus 17:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+12:23">Deuteronomy 12:23</span>), the apostle sees this
	life stream of the whole human race to be one, flowing from one
	source [BAUMGARTEN]. 
	</p>
<p><b>and hath determined the times
	before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation</b>—The
	apostle here opposes both Stoical Fate and Epicurean Chance,
	ascribing the <i>periods</i> and <i>localities</i> in which men and
	nations flourish to the sovereign will and prearrangements of a
	living God.</p>
