26, 27. and hath made of one blood
	all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth—Holding
	with the Old Testament teaching, that in the blood is the life
	(Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:11;
	Deuteronomy 12:23), the apostle sees this
	life stream of the whole human race to be one, flowing from one
	source [BAUMGARTEN]. 
	and hath determined the times
	before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation—The
	apostle here opposes both Stoical Fate and Epicurean Chance,
	ascribing the periods and localities in which men and
	nations flourish to the sovereign will and prearrangements of a
	living God.
