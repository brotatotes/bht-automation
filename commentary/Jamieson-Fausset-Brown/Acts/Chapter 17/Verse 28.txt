	and have our being—(or, more briefly, "exist").—This
	means, not merely, "Without Him we have no life, nor that
	motion which every inanimate nature displays, nor even
	existence itself" [MEYER],
	but that God is the living, immanent Principle of all these in men. 
	as certain also of your own
	poets have said, For we are also his offspring—the first half
	of the fifth line, word for word, of an astronomical poem of Aratus,
	a Greek countryman of the apostle, and his predecessor by about three
	centuries. But, as he hints, the same sentiment is to be found in
	other Greek poets. They meant it doubtless in a pantheistic
	sense; but the truth which it expresses the apostle turns to his own
	purpose—to teach a pure, personal, spiritual Theism. (Probably
	during his quiet retreat at Tarsus.  :-, revolving his special vocation to the Gentiles he gave
	himself to the study of so much Greek literature as might be turned
	to Christian account in his future work. Hence this and his other
	quotations from the Greek poets, 1 Corinthians 15:33;
	Titus 1:12).
