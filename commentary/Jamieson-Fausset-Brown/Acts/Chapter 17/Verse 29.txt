<p><b>that the Godhead is like unto
	gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device</b>—("graven
	by the art or device of man"). One can hardly doubt that the
	apostle would here point to those matchless monuments of the plastic
	art, in gold and silver and costliest stone, which lay so profusely
	beneath and around him. The more intelligent pagan Greeks no more
	pretended that these sculptured gods and goddesses were real deities,
	or even their actual likenesses, than Romanist Christians do their
	images; and Paul doubtless knew this; yet here we find him condemning
	all such efforts visibly to represent the invisible God. How
	shamefully inexcusable then are the Greek and Roman churches in
	paganizing the worship of the Christian Church by the encouragement
	of pictures and images in religious service! (In the eighth century,
	the second council of Nicea decreed that the image of God was as
	proper an object of worship as God Himself).</p>
