<p><b>30. the times of this ignorance God

	that is, bore with, without interposing to punish it, otherwise than
	suffering the debasing tendency of such worship to develop itself
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:16">Acts 14:16</span>, and see on

	—a tacit allusion to the narrow precincts of favored Judaism,
	within which immediate and entire repentance was ever urged. The word
	"repentance" is here used (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:3">Luke 13:3</span>;

	in its most comprehensive sense of "repentance unto life."</p>
