31. Because he hath appointed a day
	in the which he will judge the world—Such language beyond doubt
	teaches that the judgment will, in its essence, be a solemn judicial
	assize held upon all mankind at once. "Aptly is this
	uttered on the Areopagus, the seat of judgment" [BENGEL].
	by that man whom he hath
	ordained—compare John 5:22;
	John 5:23; John 5:27;
	Acts 10:42. 
	whereof he hath given
	assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead—the
	most patent evidence to mankind at large of the judicial authority
	with which the Risen One is clothed.
