<p><b>32-34. when they heard of the
	resurrection of the dead, some mocked</b>—As the Greek religion was
	but the glorification of the present life, by the worship of all its
	most beauteous forms, the Resurrection, which presupposes the vanity
	of the present life, and is nothing but life out of the death of all
	that sin has blighted, could have no charm for the true Greek. It
	gave the death blow to his fundamental and most cherished ideas; nor
	until these were seen to be false and fatal could the Resurrection,
	and the Gospel of which it was a primary doctrine, seem otherwise
	than ridiculous.

<p><b>others said, We will hear
	thee again of this</b>—"an idle compliment to Paul and an
	opiate to their consciences, such as we often meet with in our own
	day. They probably, like Felix, feared to hear more, lest they should
	be constrained to believe unwelcome truths" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span>)
