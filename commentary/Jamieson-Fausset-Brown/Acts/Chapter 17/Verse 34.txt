<p><b>34. Howbeit certain men clave unto
	him</b>—Instead of mocking or politely waiving the subject, having
	listened eagerly, they joined themselves to the apostle for further
	instruction; and so they "believed." 
	</p>
<p><b>Dionysius the Areopagite</b>—a
	member of that august tribunal. Ancient tradition says he was placed
	by the apostle over the little flock at Athens. "Certainly the
	number of converts there and of men fit for office in the Church was
	not so great that there could be much choice" [OLSHAUSEN].
	</p>
<p><b>a woman named Damaris</b>—not
	certainly one of the apostle's audience on the Areopagus, but won to
	the faith either before or after. Nothing else is known of her. Of
	any further labors of the apostle at Athens, and how long he stayed,
	we are not informed. Certainly he was not driven away. But "it
	is a serious and instructive fact that the mercantile populations of
	Thessalonica and Corinth received the message of God with greater
	readiness than the highly educated and polished Athenians. Two
	letters to the Thessalonians, and two to the Corinthians, remain to
	attest the flourishing state of those churches. But we possess no
	letter written by Paul to the Athenians; and we do not read that he
	was ever in Athens again" [HOWSON].</p>
