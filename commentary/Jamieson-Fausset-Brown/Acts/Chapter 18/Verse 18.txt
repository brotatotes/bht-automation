<p><b>18. Paul . . . tarried . . . yet a
	good while</b>—During his long residence at Corinth, Paul planted
	other churches in Achaia (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>then took . . . leave of the

<p><b>Syria</b>—to Antioch, the
	starting-point of all the missions to the Gentiles, which he feels to
	be for the present concluded.

<p><b>with him Priscilla and
	Aquila</b>—In this order the names also occur in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1- :">2 Corinthians 1:1- :</span> (according to the true reading); compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:3">Romans 16:3</span>;

	that the wife was the more prominent and helpful to the Church. Silas
	and Timotheus doubtless accompanied the apostle, as also Erastus,
	Gaius, and Aristarchus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>). Of Silas, as Paul's
	associate, we read no more. His name occurs last in connection with
	Peter and the churches of Asia Minor [WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON].

	head in Cenchrea</b>—the eastern harbor of Corinth, about ten miles

<p><b>had a vow</b>—That it was
	the Nazarite vow (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:1-27">Numbers 6:1-27</span>)
	is not likely. It was probably one made in one of his seasons of
	difficulty or danger, in prosecution of which he cuts off his hair
	and hastens to Jerusalem to offer the requisite sacrifice within the
	prescribed thirty days [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Wars of the Jews,</i> 2.15.1]. This explains the haste with which
	he leaves Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:21">Acts 18:21</span>),
	and the subsequent observance, on the recommendation of the brethren,
	of a similar vow (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:24">Acts 21:24</span>).
	This one at Corinth was voluntary, and shows that even in heathen
	countries he systematically studied the prejudices of his Jewish
	brethren.</p>
