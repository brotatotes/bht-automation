<p><b>2. a Jew . . . Aquila . . . with his
	wife Priscilla</b>—From these <i>Latin</i> names one would conclude
	that they had resided so long in Rome as to lose their Jewish family
	names. 
	</p>
<p><b>born in Pontus</b>—the most
	easterly province of Asia Minor, stretching along the southern shore
	of the Black Sea. From this province there were Jews at Jerusalem on
	the great Pentecost (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9">Acts 2:9</span>),
	and the Christians of it are included among "the strangers of
	the dispersion," to whom Peter addressed his first Epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:9- :">Acts 2:9- :</span>). Whether this couple were converted before Paul made their
	acquaintance, commentators are much divided. They may have brought
	their Christianity with them from Rome [OLSHAUSEN],
	or Paul may have been drawn to them merely by like occupation, and,
	lodging with them, have been the instrument of their conversion
	[MEYER]. They appear to
	have been in good circumstances, and after travelling much, to have
	eventually settled at Ephesus. The Christian friendship now first
	formed continued warm and unbroken, and the highest testimony is once
	and again borne to them by the apostle.

<p><b>Claudius,</b> &amp;c.—This
	edict is almost certainly that mentioned by SUETONIUS,
	in his life of this emperor [<i>Lives of the Cæsars,</i> "Claudius,"
	25].</p>
