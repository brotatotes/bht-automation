<p><b>and gone up</b>—that is, to

<p><b>and saluted the church</b>—In
	these few words does the historian despatch the apostle's FOURTH
	VISIT TO JERUSALEM
	after his conversion. The expression "going <i>up</i>" is
	invariably used of a journey to the metropolis; and thence he
	naturally "went <i>down</i> to Antioch." Perhaps the vessel
	reached too late for the feast, as he seems to have done nothing in
	Jerusalem beyond "saluting the Church," and privately
	offering the sacrifice with which his vow (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) would conclude. It is left to be understood, as on his
	arrival from his first missionary tour, that "when he was come,
	and had gathered the church together, he rehearsed all that God had
	done with him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:27">Acts 14:27</span>)
	on this his <i>second missionary journey.</i>
