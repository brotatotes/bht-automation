<p><b>he departed</b>—little

<p><b>went over all . . . Galatia

	Galatia is mentioned first here, as he would come to it first from
	Antioch. It was on this visitation that he ordained the weekly
	collection (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1">1 Corinthians 16:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:2">1 Corinthians 16:2</span>),
	which has been since adopted generally, and converted into a public
	usage throughout Christendom. Timotheus and Erastus, Gaius and
	Aristarchus, appear to have accompanied him on this journey (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:22">Acts 19:22</span>;

	and from Second Corinthians we may presume, Titus also. The details
	of this visit, as of the former (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1- :">2 Corinthians 1:1- :</span>), are not given.

<p>This is one of the most
	interesting and suggestive incidental narratives in this precious
