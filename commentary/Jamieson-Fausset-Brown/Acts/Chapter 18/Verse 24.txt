	contraction from Apollonius. 
	born at Alexandria—the
	celebrated city of Egypt on the southeastern shore of the
	Mediterranean, called after its founder, Alexander the Great. Nowhere

	and an intelligent Jew educated in that city could hardly fail to
	manifest all these elements in his mental character. 
	eloquent—turning his
	Alexandrian culture to high account. 
	and mighty in the

	enforce skilfully what, as a Jew, he had gathered from a diligent
	study of the Old Testament Scriptures. 
	came to Ephesus—on what
	errand is not known.
