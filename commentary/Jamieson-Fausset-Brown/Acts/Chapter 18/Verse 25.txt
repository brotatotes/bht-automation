<p><b>25. This man was instructed in the
	way of the Lord . . . knowing only the baptism of John</b>—He was
	instructed, probably, by some disciple of the Baptist, in the whole
	circle of John's teaching concerning Jesus, but no more: he had yet
	to learn the new light which the outpouring of the Spirit at
	Pentecost had thrown upon the Redeemer's death and resurrection; as
	appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:2">Acts 19:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:3">Acts 19:3</span>.
	</p>
<p><b>being fervent in the
	spirit</b>—His heart warm, and conscious, probably, of his gifts
	and attainments, he burned to impart to others the truth he had
	himself received. 
	</p>
<p><b>he spake and taught
	diligently</b>—rather, "accurately" (it is the same word
	as is rendered "perfectly" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:3- :">Acts 19:3- :</span>).</p>
