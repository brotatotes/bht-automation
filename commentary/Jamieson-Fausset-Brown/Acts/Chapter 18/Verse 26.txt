26. speak boldly in the synagogue,
	whom when Aquila and Priscilla heard—joying to observe the
	extent of Scripture knowledge and evangelical truth which he
	displayed, and the fervency, courage, and eloquence with which he
	preached the truth. 
	they took him unto
	them—privately. 
	and expounded unto him the
	way of God more perfectly—opening up those truths, to him as
	yet unknown, on which the Spirit had shed such glorious light. (In
	what appears to be the true reading of this verse, Priscilla is put
	before Aquila, as in Acts 18:18
	[see on Acts 18:1]; she being
	probably the more intelligent and devoted of the two). One cannot but
	observe how providential it was that this couple should have been
	left at Ephesus when Paul sailed thence for Syria; and no doubt it
	was chiefly to pave the way for the better understanding of this
	episode that the fact is expressly mentioned by the historian in Acts 18:1- :. We see here also an example of not only lay agency
	(as it is called), but female agency of the highest kind and
	with the most admirable fruit. Nor can one help admiring the humility
	and teachableness of so gifted a teacher in sitting at the feet of a
	Christian woman and her husband.
