	which Corinth, on the opposite coast (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), was the capital; there to proclaim that Gospel which he

<p><b>the brethren</b>—We had not

	to whom Paul preached to retain him among them for some time (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and his promise to return to them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), seem to indicate some drawing towards the Gospel, which,
	no doubt, the zealous private labors of Priscilla and Aquila would
	ripen into discipleship.

<p><b>which believed through
	grace</b>—one of those incidental expressions which show that
	<i>faith's being a production of God's grace in the heart</i> was so
	current and recognized a truth that it was taken for granted, as a
	necessary consequence of the general system of grace, rather than
	expressly insisted on. (It is against the natural order of the words
	to read them, as BENGEL,
	MEYER, and others, do,
	"helped through grace those who believed").</p>
