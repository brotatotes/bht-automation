<p><b>28. For he mightily convinced the
	Jews</b>—The word is very strong: "stoutly bore them down in
	argument," "vigorously argued them down," and the
	<i>tense</i> in that he <i>continued</i> to do it, or that this was
	the characteristic of his ministry.

<p><b>showing by the scriptures
	that Jesus was Christ</b>—Rather, "that the Christ (or
	Messiah) was Jesus." This expression, when compared with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, seems to imply a richer testimony than with his partial
	knowledge he was at first able to bear; and the power with which he
	bore down all opposition in argument is that which made him such an
	acquisition to the brethren. Thus his ministry would be as good as
	another visitation to the Achaian churches by the apostle himself
	(see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span>) and the more as,
	in so far as he was indebted for it to Priscilla and Aquila, it would
	have a decidedly <i>Pauline</i> cast.</p>
