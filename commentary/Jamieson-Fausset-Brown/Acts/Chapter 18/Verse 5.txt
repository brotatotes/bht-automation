5, 6. And when Silas and Timotheus
	were come from Macedonia—that is, from Thessalonica, whither
	Silas had probably accompanied Timothy when sent back from Athens
	(see on Acts 18:1). 
	Paul was pressed in the
	spirit—rather (according to what is certainly the true reading)
	"was pressed with the word"; expressing not only his zeal
	and assiduity in preaching it, but some inward pressure which
	at this time he experienced in the work (to convey which more clearly
	was probably the origin of the common reading). What that pressure
	was we happen to know, with singular minuteness and vividness of
	description, from the apostle himself, in his first Epistles to the
	Corinthians and Thessalonians (1 Corinthians 2:1-5;
	1 Thessalonians 3:1-10). He had come
	away from Athens, as he remained there, in a depressed and anxious
	state of mind, having there met, for the first time, with unwilling
	Gentile ears. He continued, apparently for some time, laboring alone
	in the synagogue of Corinth, full of deep and anxious solicitude for
	his Thessalonian converts. His early ministry at Corinth was colored
	by these feelings. Himself deeply humbled, his power as a preacher
	was more than ever felt to lie in demonstration of the Spirit. At
	length Silas and Timotheus arrived with exhilarating tidings of the
	faith and love of his Thessalonian children, and of their earnest
	longing again to see their father in Christ; bringing with them also,
	in token of their love and duty, a pecuniary contribution for the
	supply of his wants. This seems to have so lifted him as to put new
	life and vigor into his ministry. He now wrote his FIRST
	EPISTLE TO THE
	THESSALONIANS, in which
	the "pressure" which resulted from all this strikingly
	appears. (See 1 Thessalonians 3:1-52.3.10- : to First
	Thessalonians). Such emotions are known only to the ministers of
	Christ, and, even of them, only to such as "travail in birth
	until Christ be formed in" their hearers.
