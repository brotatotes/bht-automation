	entered into a certain man's house, named Justusâ€”not changing
	his lodging, as if Aquila and Priscilla up to this time were with the
	opponents of the apostle [ALFORD],
	but merely ceasing any more to testify in the synagogue, and
	henceforth carrying on his labors in this house of Justus, which
	"joining hard to the synagogue," would be easily accessible
	to such of its worshippers as were still open to light. Justus, too,
	being probably a proselyte, would more easily draw a mixed audience
	than the synagogue. From this time forth conversions rapidly
	increased.
