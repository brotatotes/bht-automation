<p><b>10. this continued . . . two

	second unrecorded visit to Corinth, since the one next recorded (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:2">Acts 19:2</span>) is twice called
	his <i>third</i> visit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:14">2 Corinthians 12:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1">2 Corinthians 13:1</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1- :">2 Corinthians 13:1- :</span>, which might seem inconsistent with this. The passage
	across was quite a short one (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1- :">2 Corinthians 13:1- :</span>) —Towards the close of this long stay at Ephesus, as we
	learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8">1 Corinthians 16:8</span>, he wrote
	his FIRST EPISTLE
	TO THE CORINTHIANS;
	also (though on this opinions are divided) the EPISTLE
	TO THE GALATIANS.
	(See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8- :">1 Corinthians 16:8- :</span> to First
	Corinthians, and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8- :">1 Corinthians 16:8- :</span> to
	Galatians). And just as at Corinth his greatest success was after his
	withdrawal to a separate place of meeting (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8- :">1 Corinthians 16:8- :</span>), so at Ephesus.

<p><b>so that all they which dwelt

<p><b>Asia heard the word of the
	Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks</b>—This is the "great door
	and effectual opened unto him" while resident at Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8- :">1 Corinthians 16:8- :</span>), which induced him to make it his headquarters for so long
	a period. The unwearied and varied character of his labors here are
	best seen in his own subsequent address to the elders of Ephesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:8- :">1 Corinthians 16:8- :</span>, c.). And thus Ephesus became the "ecclesiastical
	center for the entire region, as indeed it remained for a very long
	period" [BAUMGARTEN].
	Churches arose at Colosse, Laodicea, and Hierapolis eastward, either
	through his own labors or those of his faithful helpers whom he sent
	out in different directions, Epaphras, Archippus, Philemon (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:7">Colossians 1:7</span>
