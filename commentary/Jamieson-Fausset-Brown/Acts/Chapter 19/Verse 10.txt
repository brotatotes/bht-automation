10. this continued . . . two
	years—in addition to the former three months. See on  :-. But during some part of this period he must have paid a
	second unrecorded visit to Corinth, since the one next recorded (see
	on Acts 19:2) is twice called
	his third visit (2 Corinthians 12:14;
	2 Corinthians 13:1). See on 2 Corinthians 13:1- :, which might seem inconsistent with this. The passage
	across was quite a short one (see on 2 Corinthians 13:1- :) —Towards the close of this long stay at Ephesus, as we
	learn from 1 Corinthians 16:8, he wrote
	his FIRST EPISTLE
	TO THE CORINTHIANS;
	also (though on this opinions are divided) the EPISTLE
	TO THE GALATIANS.
	(See 1 Corinthians 16:8- : to First
	Corinthians, and 1 Corinthians 16:8- : to
	Galatians). And just as at Corinth his greatest success was after his
	withdrawal to a separate place of meeting (1 Corinthians 16:8- :), so at Ephesus.

	in—the Roman province of 
	Asia heard the word of the
	Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks—This is the "great door
	and effectual opened unto him" while resident at Ephesus (1 Corinthians 16:8- :), which induced him to make it his headquarters for so long
	a period. The unwearied and varied character of his labors here are
	best seen in his own subsequent address to the elders of Ephesus (1 Corinthians 16:8- :, c.). And thus Ephesus became the "ecclesiastical
	center for the entire region, as indeed it remained for a very long
	period" [BAUMGARTEN].
	Churches arose at Colosse, Laodicea, and Hierapolis eastward, either
	through his own labors or those of his faithful helpers whom he sent
	out in different directions, Epaphras, Archippus, Philemon (Colossians 1:7
Colossians 4:12-17; Philemon 1:23).
