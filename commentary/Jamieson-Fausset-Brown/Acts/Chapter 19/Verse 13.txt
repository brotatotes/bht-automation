<p><b>13. vagabond Jews</b>—simply,
	"wandering Jews," who went from place to place practicing
	exorcism, or the art of conjuring evil spirits to depart out of the

	implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:27">Matthew 12:27</span>. But no
	doubt this would breed imposture; and the present case is very
	different from that referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:49">Luke 9:49</span>;
