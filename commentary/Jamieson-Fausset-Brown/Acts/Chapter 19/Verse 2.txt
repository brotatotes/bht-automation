<p><b>2. Have ye received the Holy Ghost
	since ye believed?</b>—rather, "Received ye the Holy Ghost
	when ye believed?" implying, certainly, that the one did not of
	necessity carry the other along with it (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Why this question was asked, we cannot tell; but it was
	probably in consequence of something that passed between them from
	which the apostle was led to suspect the imperfection of their light.
	</p>
<p><b>We have not so much as heard
	whether there be any Holy Ghost</b>—This cannot be the meaning,
	since the personality and office of the Holy Ghost, in connection
	with Christ, formed an especial subject of the Baptist's teaching.
	Literally, the words are, "We did not even hear whether the Holy
	Ghost was (given)"; meaning, at the time of their baptism. That
	the word "given" is the right supplement, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, seems plain from the nature of the case.</p>
