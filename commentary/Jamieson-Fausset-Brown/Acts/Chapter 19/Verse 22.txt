<p><b>22. So he sent into Macedonia . . .
	Timotheus and Erastus</b>—as his pioneers, in part to bring "them
	into remembrance of his ways which were in Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:17">1 Corinthians 4:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10">1 Corinthians 16:10</span>), partly to convey his
	mind on various matters. After a brief stay he was to return (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10- :">1 Corinthians 16:10- :</span>). It is very unlikely that this Erastus was "the
	chamberlain of the city" of Corinth, of that name (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:10- :">1 Corinthians 16:10- :</span>).

<p><b>he himself stayed in</b>—the
	province of 
	</p>
<p><b>Asia for a season</b>—that
	is, at Ephesus, its chief city. (Asia is mentioned in contrast with
	Macedonia in the previous clause).</p>
