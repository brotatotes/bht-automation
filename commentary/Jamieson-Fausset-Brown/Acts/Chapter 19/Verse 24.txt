	the Ephesian temple and of the shrine or chapel of the goddess, or of
	the shrine and statue alone, which were purchased by visitors as
	memorials of what they had seen, and were carried about and deposited
	in houses as a charm. (The models of the chapel of <i>our Lady of
	Loretto,</i> and such like, which the Church of Rome systematically
	encourages, are such a palpable imitation of this heathen practice
	that it is no wonder it should be regarded by impartial judges as
	<i>Christianity paganized</i>).
