<p><b>31. And certain of the chief of
	Asia</b>â€”literally, "And certain also of the Asiarchs."
	These were wealthy and distinguished citizens of the principal towns
	of the Asian province, chosen annually, and ten of whom were selected
	by the proconsul to preside over the games celebrated in the month of
	May (the same month which Romanism dedicates to <i>the Virgin</i>).
	It was an office of the highest honor and greatly coveted. Certain of
	these, it seems, were favorably inclined to the Gospel, at least were
	Paul's "friends," and knowing the passions of a mob,
	excited during the festivals, "sent (a message) to him desiring
	him not to adventure himself into the theater."</p>
