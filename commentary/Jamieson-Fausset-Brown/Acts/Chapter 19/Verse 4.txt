4. Then said Paul, John . . .
	baptized with the baptism of repentance—water unto repentance. 
	saying unto the people, that
	they should believe on him which should come after him—that is,
	who should baptize with the Holy Ghost. The point of contrast is not
	between John and Christ personally, but between the water
	baptism of John unto repentance, and the promised baptism of
	the Spirit from the hands of his coming Master unto new
	life. As to all the facts, or at least the significancy, of this
	baptism, which made the whole life and work of Christ another thing
	from what it was conceived to be before it was vouchsafed, these
	simple disciples were unenlightened.
