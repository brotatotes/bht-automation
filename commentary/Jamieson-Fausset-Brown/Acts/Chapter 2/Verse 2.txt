	from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind,</b> c.â€”"The whole
	description is so picturesque and striking that it could only come
	from an eye-witness" [OLSHAUSEN].

	deepest awe the whole company, and thus complete their preparation
	for the heavenly gift. Wind was a familiar emblem of the Spirit
