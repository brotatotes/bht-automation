29-36. David . . . is . . . dead and
	buried, &c.—Peter, full of the Holy Ghost, sees in this
	sixteenth Psalm, one Holy Man, whose life of high devotedness and
	lofty spirituality is crowned with the assurance, that though He
	taste of death, He shall rise again without seeing corruption, and be
	admitted to the bliss of God's immediate presence. Now as this was
	palpably untrue of David, it could be meant only of One other, even
	of Him whom David was taught to expect as the final Occupant of the
	throne of Israel. (Those, therefore, and they are many, who take
	David himself to be the subject of this Psalm, and the words quoted
	to refer to Christ only in a more eminent sense, nullify the
	whole argument of the apostle). The Psalm is then affirmed to have
	had its only proper fulfilment in JESUS,
	of whose resurrection and ascension they were witnesses, while the
	glorious effusion of the Spirit by the hand of the ascended One,
	setting an infallible seal upon all, was even then witnessed by the
	thousands who stood listening to Him. A further illustration of
	Messiah's ascension and session at God's right hand is drawn from  :-, in which David cannot be thought to speak of himself,
	seeing he is still in his grave.
