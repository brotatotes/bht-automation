	Israel</b>—for in this first discourse the appeal is formally made
	to the whole house of Israel, as the then existing Kingdom of God.

<p><b>know assuredly</b>—by
	indisputable facts, fulfilled predictions, and the seal of the Holy
	Ghost set upon all.

<p><b>that God hath made</b>—for
	Peter's object was to show them that, instead of interfering with the

	crucified</b>—"The sting is at the close" [BENGEL].
	To prove to them merely that Jesus was the Messiah might have left
	them all unchanged in heart. But to convince them that He whom they
	had crucified had been by the right hand of God exalted, and
	constituted the "LORD"

	CHRIST of God, was to
	bring them to "look on Him whom they had pierced and mourn for
	Him."</p>
