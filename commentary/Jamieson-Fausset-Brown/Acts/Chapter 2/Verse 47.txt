<p><b>47. Praising God</b>—"Go thy
	way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart,
	<i>for God now accepteth thy works</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, also see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:39">Acts 8:39</span>).

<p><b>having favour with all the
	people</b>—commending themselves by their lovely demeanor to the
	admiration of all who observed them.

<p><b>And the Lord</b>—that is,
	JESUS, as the glorified
	Head and Ruler of the Church.

<p><b>such as should be
	saved</b>—rather, "the saved," or "those who were
	being saved." "The young Church had but few peculiarities
	in its outward form, or even in its doctrine: the single
	discriminating principle of its few members was that they all
	recognized the crucified Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah. This
	confession would have been a thing of no importance, if it had only
	presented itself as a naked declaration, and would never in such a
	case have been able to form a community that would spread itself over
	the whole Roman empire. It acquired its value only through the power
	of the Holy Ghost, passing from the apostles as they preached to the
	hearers; for He brought the confession from the very hearts of men
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>), and like a burning
	flame made their souls glow with love. By the power of this Spirit,
	therefore, we behold the first Christians not only in a state of
	active fellowship, but also internally changed: the narrow views of
	the natural man are broken through; they have their possessions in
	common, and they regard themselves as one family" [OLSHAUSEN].</p>
