	the whole Roman empire. It acquired its value only through the power
	of the Holy Ghost, passing from the apostles as they preached to the
	hearers; for He brought the confession from the very hearts of men
	(1 Corinthians 12:3), and like a burning
	flame made their souls glow with love. By the power of this Spirit,
	therefore, we behold the first Christians not only in a state of
	active fellowship, but also internally changed: the narrow views of
	the natural man are broken through; they have their possessions in
	common, and they regard themselves as one family" [OLSHAUSEN].
