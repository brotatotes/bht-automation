<p><b>9-11. Parthians,</b> c.—Beginning
	with the farthest east, the Parthians, the enumeration proceeds
	farther and farther westward till it comes to Judea next come the
	western countries, from Cappadocia to Pamphylia; then the southern,
	from Egypt to Cyrene; finally, apart from all geographical
	consideration, Cretes and Arabians are placed together. This
	enumeration is evidently designed to convey an impression of
	universality [BAUMGARTEN].
