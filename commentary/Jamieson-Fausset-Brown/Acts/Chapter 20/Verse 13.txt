<p><b>13, 14. we . . . sailed</b>—from
	Troas. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto Assos; there . . . to
	take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go
	afoot</b>—"to go by land." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). In sailing southward from Troas to Assos, one has to round
	Cape Lecture, and keeping due east to run along the northern shore of
	the Gulf of Adramyttium, on which it lies. This is a sail of nearly
	forty miles; whereas by land, cutting right across, in a
	southeasterly direction, from sea to sea, by that excellent Roman
	road which then existed, the distance was scarcely more than half.
	The one way Paul wished his companions to take, while he himself,
	longing perhaps to enjoy a period of solitude, took the other,
	joining the ship, by appointment, at Assos.</p>
