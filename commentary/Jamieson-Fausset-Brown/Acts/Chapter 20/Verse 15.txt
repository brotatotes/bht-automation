15, 16. came the next day
	over against Chios—now Scio: one of the most beautiful of those
	islands between which and the coast the sail is so charming. They
	appear not to have touched at it. 
	next day
	we arrived—"touched" or "put in." 
	at Samos—another island
	coming quite close to the mainland, and about as far south of Chios
	as it is south of Lesbos. 
	tarried—for the night. 
	at Trogyllium—an
	anchorage on the projecting mainland, not more than a mile from the
	southern extremity of the island of Samos. 
	next day
	we came to Miletus—on the mainland; the ancient capital of
	Ionia, near the mouth of the Meander.
