<p><b>15, 16. came the next </b><i><b>day</b></i><b>
	over against Chios</b>—now Scio: one of the most beautiful of those
	islands between which and the coast the sail is so charming. They
	appear not to have touched at it. 
	</p>
<p><b>next </b><i><b>day</b></i><b>
	we arrived</b>—"touched" or "put in." 
	</p>
<p><b>at Samos</b>—another island
	coming quite close to the mainland, and about as far south of Chios
	as it is south of Lesbos. 
	</p>
<p><b>tarried</b>—for the night. 
	</p>
<p><b>at Trogyllium</b>—an
	anchorage on the projecting mainland, not more than a mile from the
	southern extremity of the island of Samos. 
	</p>
<p><b>next </b><i><b>day</b></i><b>
	we came to Miletus</b>—on the mainland; the ancient capital of
	Ionia, near the mouth of the Meander.</p>
