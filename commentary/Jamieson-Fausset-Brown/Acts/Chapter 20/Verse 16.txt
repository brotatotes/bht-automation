16. For Paul had determined to sail
	by—or "sail past." 
	Ephesus—He was right
	opposite to it when approaching Chios. 
	because he would not spend
	time in Asia—the Asian province of which Ephesus was the chief
	city. 
	for he hasted, if . . .
	possible . . . to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost—as a
	suitable season for giving in the great collection from all the
	western churches, for keeping the feast, and clearing his apostolic
	position with the Church, then represented in large number at
	Jerusalem. The words imply that there was considerable ground to
	doubt if he would attain this object—for more than three of the
	seven weeks from Passover to Pentecost had already expired—and they
	are inserted evidently to explain why he did not once more visit
	Ephesus.
