<p><b>17. from Miletus he sent to Ephesus,
	and called the elders of the church</b>â€”As he was now some forty
	miles south of Ephesus, we might think that more time would be lost
	by sending thus far for the elders to come to him, than by going at
	once to Ephesus itself, when so near it. But if unfavorable winds and
	stormy weather had overtaken them, his object could not have been
	attained, and perhaps he was unwilling to run the risk of detention
	at Ephesus by the state of the church and other causes. Those here
	called "<i>elders</i>" or "presbyters," are in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> called "<i>bishops.</i>" (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The identity of presbyters and bishops in the New
	Testament is beyond all reasonable dispute.</p>
