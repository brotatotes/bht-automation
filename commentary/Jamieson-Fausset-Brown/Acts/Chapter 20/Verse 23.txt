<p><b>23. Save that the Holy Ghost
	witnesseth in every city,</b> c.â€”by prophetic utterances from city
	to city, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:4">Acts 11:4</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:10">Acts 21:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:11">Acts 21:11</span>. Analogous premonitions
	of coming events are not unknown to the general method of God's
	providence. They would tend to season the apostle's spirit.</p>
