<p><b>29, 30. after my departing shall
	grievous wolves enter in among you</b>â€”Two classes of coming
	enemies are here announced, the one more external to themselves, the
	other bred in the bosom of their own community; both were to be
	teachers, but the one, "grievous wolves," not sparing, that
	is, making a prey of the flock; the other (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), simply sectarian "perverters" of the truth,
	with the view of drawing a party after them. Perhaps the one pointed
	to that subtle poison of Oriental Gnosticism which we know to have
	very early infected the Asiatic churches; the other to such Judaizing
	tendencies as we know to have troubled nearly all the early churches.
	See the Epistles to the <i>Ephesians, Colossians,</i> and <i>Timothy,</i>
	also those to the seven churches of Asia (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). But watchfulness against <i>all</i> that tends to
	injure and corrupt the Church is the duty of its pastors in every
	age.</p>
