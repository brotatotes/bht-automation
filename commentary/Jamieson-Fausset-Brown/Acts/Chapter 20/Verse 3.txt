<p><b>3. And there abode three
	months</b>—Though the province only is here mentioned, it is the
	city of CORINTH that is
	meant, as the province of "Macedonia" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) meant the city of Philippi. Some rough work he anticipated
	on his arrival at Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:1-8">2 Corinthians 10:1-8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+10:11">2 Corinthians 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:1-10">2 Corinthians 13:1-10</span>)
	though he had reason to expect satisfaction on the whole; and as we
	know there were other churches in Achaia besides that at Corinth
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:1">2 Corinthians 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:10">2 Corinthians 11:10</span>),
	he would have time enough to pay them all a brief visit during the
	three months of his stay there. This period was rendered further
	memorable by the despatch of <i>the</i> EPISTLE
	TO THE ROMANS,
	written during his stay at Corinth and sent by "Phoeligbe, a
	servant [deaconess] of the Church at Cenchrea" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:10- :">2 Corinthians 11:10- :</span>), a lady apparently of some standing and substance, who was
	going thither on private business. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:10- :">2 Corinthians 11:10- :</span> and see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:10- :">2 Corinthians 11:10- :</span> to
	Romans).

<p><b>And when the Jews laid wait
	for him, as he was about to sail into Syria</b>—He had intended to
	embark, probably at Cenchrea, the eastern harbor of the city, for
	Palestine, on his route to Jerusalem, the <i>third</i> part of his
	plan (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21">Acts 19:21</span>). But having
	detected some conspiracy against his life by his bitter Jewish
	enemies as at Damascus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:21- :">Acts 19:21- :</span>) and Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:29">Acts 9:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:30">Acts 9:30</span>), he changed his plan
	and determined "to return" as he had come, "through
	Macedonia." As he was never more to return to Corinth, so this
	route would bring him, for the last time, face to face with the
	attached disciples of <i>Berea, Thessalonica,</i> and <i>Philippi.</i></p>
