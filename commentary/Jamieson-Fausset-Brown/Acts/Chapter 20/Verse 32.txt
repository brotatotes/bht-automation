32-35. I commend you to God—the
	almighty Conservator of His people. 
	and to the word of his
	grace—that message of His pure grace ( :-) by the faith of which He keeps us ( :-). 
	which—that is, God. 
	is able to build you up, and
	to give you an inheritance, c.—Observe how salvation—not only
	in its initial stages of pardon and regeneration, but in all
	its subsequent stages of "up-building," even to its
	consummation in the final inheritance—is here ascribed to
	the "ability" of God to bestow it, as in Romans 16:25
Ephesians 3:20; particularly Ephesians 3:20- :; and compare 2 Timothy 1:12,
	where the same thing is ascribed to Christ.
among all them which are
	sanctified—Sanctification is here viewed as the final character
	and condition of the heirs of glory, regarded as one saved company.
