<p><b>and to the word of his

	in its <i>initial stages</i> of pardon and regeneration, but in all
	its <i>subsequent stages</i> of "up-building," even to its
	<i>consummation</i> in the final inheritance—is here ascribed to
	the "ability" of God to bestow it, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:20">Ephesians 3:20</span>; particularly <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:20- :">Ephesians 3:20- :</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>,
	where <i>the same thing is ascribed to Christ.</i>

<p><b>among all them which are

	and condition of the heirs of glory, regarded as one saved company.</p>
