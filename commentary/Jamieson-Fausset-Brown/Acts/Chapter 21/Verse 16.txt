	converted on the day of Pentecost, or, more likely still, drawn to
	the Saviour Himself during His lifetime. He had come, probably, with

	to Antioch, "preaching the Lord Jesus unto the Grecians,"

<p>The apostle was full of anxiety
	about this visit to Jerusalem, from the numerous prophetic
	intimations of danger awaiting him, and having reason to expect the
	presence at this feast of the very parties from whose virulent rage
	he had once and again narrowly escaped with his life. Hence we find
	him asking the Roman Christians to wrestle with him in prayer, "for
	the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, <i>that
	he might be delivered from them that believed not in Judea,</i>"
	as well as "that his service which he had for Jerusalem (the
	great collection for the poor saints there) might be accepted of the
	saints" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:30">Romans 15:30</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:31">Romans 15:31</span>).</p>
