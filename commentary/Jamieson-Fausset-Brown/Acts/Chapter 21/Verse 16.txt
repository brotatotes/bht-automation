	One Mnason of Cyprus, an old
	disciple, c.—not an "aged" disciple, but probably "a
	disciple of old standing," perhaps one of the three thousand
	converted on the day of Pentecost, or, more likely still, drawn to
	the Saviour Himself during His lifetime. He had come, probably, with
	the other Cyprians (Acts 11:20),
	to Antioch, "preaching the Lord Jesus unto the Grecians,"
	and now he appears settled at Jerusalem. 
	Acts 11:20- :. PAUL REPORTS
	THE EVENTS OF HIS
	THIRD MISSIONARY
	JOURNEY—IN
	THE TEMPLE,
	PURIFYING HIMSELF
	FROM A JEWISH VOW,
	HE IS
	SEIZED BY A MOB
	AND BEATEN TO THE
	DANGER OF HIS
	LIFE—THE
	UPROAR BECOMING
	UNIVERSAL, THE ROMAN
	COMMANDANT HAS
	HIM BROUGHT
	IN CHAINS TO THE
	FORTRESS, FROM THE STAIRS
	OF WHICH HE
	IS PERMITTED
	TO ADDRESS THE
	PEOPLE. 
	The apostle was full of anxiety
	about this visit to Jerusalem, from the numerous prophetic
	intimations of danger awaiting him, and having reason to expect the
	presence at this feast of the very parties from whose virulent rage
	he had once and again narrowly escaped with his life. Hence we find
	him asking the Roman Christians to wrestle with him in prayer, "for
	the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that
	he might be delivered from them that believed not in Judea,"
	as well as "that his service which he had for Jerusalem (the
	great collection for the poor saints there) might be accepted of the
	saints" (Romans 15:30 Romans 15:31).
