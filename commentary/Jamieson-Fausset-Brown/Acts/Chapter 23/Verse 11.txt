<p><b>11. the night following</b>—his
	heart perhaps sinking, in the solitude of his barrack ward, and
	thinking perhaps that all the predictions of danger at Jerusalem were
	now to be fulfilled in his death there.

<p><b>the Lord</b>—that is,
	Jesus. 
	</p>
<p><b>stood by him . . . Be of good
	cheer, Paul; for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must
	thou . . . also at Rome</b>—that is, "Thy work in Jerusalem is
	done, faithfully and well done; but thou art not to die here; thy
	purpose next to 'see Rome' (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) shall not be disappointed, and there also must thou bear
	witness of Me." As this vision was not unneeded now, so we shall
	find it cheering and upholding him throughout all that befell him up
	to his arrival there.</p>
