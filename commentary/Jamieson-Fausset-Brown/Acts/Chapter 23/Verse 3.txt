<p><b>3, 4. God shall smite thee</b>—as
	indeed He did; for he was killed by an assassin during the Jewish war
	[JOSEPHUS, <i>Wars of the
	Jews,</i> 2.17.9]. 
	</p>
<p><i><b>thou</b></i><b> whited
	wall</b>—that is, hypocrite (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). This epithet, however correctly describing the man, must
	not be defended as addressed to a judge, though the remonstrance
	which follows—"for sittest thou," &amp;c.—ought to have
	put him to shame.</p>
