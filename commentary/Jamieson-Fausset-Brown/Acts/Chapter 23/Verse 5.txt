<p><b>5. I wist not . . . that he was the
	high priest</b>â€”All sorts of explanations of this have been given.
	The high priesthood was in a state of great confusion and constant
	change at this time (as appears from JOSEPHUS),
	and the apostle's long absence from Jerusalem, and perhaps the manner
	in which he was habited or the seat he occupied, with other
	circumstances to us unknown, may account for such a speech. But if he
	was thrown off his guard by an insult which touched him to the quick,
	"what can surpass the grace with which he recovered his
	self-possession, and the frankness with which he acknowledged his
	error? If his conduct in yielding to the momentary impulse was not
	that of Christ Himself under a similar provocation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:22">John 18:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:23">John 18:23</span>), certainly the manner
	in which he atoned for his fault was <i>Christ-like</i>"
