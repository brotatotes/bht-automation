8. the Sadducees say . . . there is
	no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit—(See on  :-). 
	the scribes . . . of the
	Pharisees' part . . . strove, saying, We find no evil in this man,
	but—as to those startling things which he brings to our ears. 
	if a spirit or an angel hath
	spoken to him—referring, perhaps, to his trance in the temple,
	of which he had told them ( :-). They put this favorable construction upon his proceedings
	for no other reason than that they had found him one of their own
	party. They care not to inquire into the truth of what he
	alleged, over and above their opinions, but only to explain it away
	as something not worth raising a noise about. (The following words,
	"Let us not fight against God," seem not to belong to the
	original text, and perhaps are from  :-. In this case, either the meaning is, "If he has had
	some divine communication, what of that?" or, the
	conclusion of the sentence may have been drowned in the hubbub, which
	Acts 23:10 shows to have been
	intense).
