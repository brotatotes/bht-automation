<p><b>14, 15. But this I confess to

<p><b>that after the way they call
	heresy</b>—literally, and better, "a sect." 
	</p>
<p><b>so worship I the God of my

	(1) Our nation is divided into what they call <i>sects</i>—the sect
	of the Pharisees, and that of the Sadducees—all the difference
	between them and me is, that I belong to neither of these, but to
	another sect, or religious section of the nation, which from its Head
	they call <i>Nazarenes:</i> for this reason, and this alone, am I
	hated. (2) The Roman law allows every nation to worship its own
	deities; I claim protection under that law, worshipping the God of my
	ancestors, even as they, only of a different sect of the common
	religion.

<p><b>believing all,</b> &amp;c.—Here,
	disowning all opinions at variance with the Old Testament Scriptures,
	he challenges for the Gospel which he preached the authority of the
	God of their fathers. So much for the charge of <i>heresy.</i></p>
