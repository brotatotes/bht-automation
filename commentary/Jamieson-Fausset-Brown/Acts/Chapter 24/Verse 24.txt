<p><b>24, 25. Felix . . . with his wife
	Drusilla . . . a Jewess</b>—This beautiful but infamous woman was
	the third daughter of Herod Agrippa I, who was eaten of worms (see on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:1">Acts 24:1</span>), and a sister of
	Agrippa II, before whom Paul pleaded, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:1- :">Acts 24:1- :</span>, &amp;c. She was "given in marriage to Azizus, king of
	the Emesenes, who had consented to be circumcised for the sake of the
	alliance. But this marriage was soon dissolved, after this manner:
	When Festus was procurator of Judea, he saw her, and being captivated
	with her beauty, persuaded her to desert her husband, transgress the
	laws of her country, and marry himself" [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 20.7.1,2]. Such was this "wife" of
	Felix.

<p><b>he sent for Paul and heard
	him concerning the faith in Christ</b>—Perceiving from what he had
	heard on the trial that the new sect which was creating such a stir
	was represented by its own advocates as but a particular development
	of the Jewish faith, he probably wished to gratify the curiosity of
	his Jewish wife, as well as his own, by a more particular account of
	it from this distinguished champion. And no doubt Paul would so far
	humor this desire as to present to them the great leading features of
	the Gospel. But from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:25">Acts 24:25</span>
	it is evident that his discourse took an entirely practical turn,
	suited to the life which his two auditors were notoriously leading.</p>
