25. And as he reasoned of
	righteousness—with reference to the public character of
	Felix. 
	temperance—with
	reference to his immoral life. 
	and judgment to come—when
	he would be called to an awful account for both. 
	Felix trembled—and no
	wonder. For, on the testimony of TACITUS,
	the Roman Annalist [Annals, 9; 12.54], he ruled with a mixture
	of cruelty, lust, and servility, and relying on the influence of his
	brother Pallas at court, he thought himself at liberty to commit
	every sort of crime with impunity. How noble the fidelity and courage
	which dared to treat of such topics in such a presence, and what
	withering power must have been in those appeals which made even a
	Felix to tremble! 
	Go thy way for this time; and
	when I have a convenient season I will call for thee—Alas for
	Felix! This was his golden opportunity, but—like multitudes
	still—he missed it. Convenient seasons in abundance he found to
	call for Paul, but never again to "hear him concerning the faith
	in Christ," and writhe under the terrors of the wrath to come.
	Even in those moments of terror he had no thought of submission to
	the Cross or a change of life. The Word discerned the thoughts and
	intents of his heart, but that heart even then clung to its idols;
	even as Herod, who "did many things and heard John gladly,"
	but in his best moments was enslaved to his lusts. How many Felixes
	have appeared from age to age!
