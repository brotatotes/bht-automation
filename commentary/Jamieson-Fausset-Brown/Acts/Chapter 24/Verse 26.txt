	have been given him . . . wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and

	was in all his acts, and his communing with Paul"—as if he
	cared for either him or his message—simply added hypocrisy to
	meanness. The position in life of Paul's Christian visitors might
	beget the hope of extracting something from them for the release of
	their champion; but the apostle would rather lie in prison than stoop
	to this!
