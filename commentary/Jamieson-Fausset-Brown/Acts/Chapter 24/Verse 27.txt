<p><b>27. after two years</b>—What a
	trial to this burning missionary of Christ, to suffer such a tedious
	period of inaction! How mysterious it would seem! But this repose
	would be medicine to his spirit; he would not, and could not, be
	entirely inactive, so long as he was able by pen and message to
	communicate with the churches; and he would doubtless learn the
	salutary truth that even he was not essential to his Master's cause.
	That Luke wrote his Gospel during this period, under the apostle's
	superintendence, is the not unlikely conjecture of able critics. 
	</p>
<p><b>Porcius Festus</b>—Little
	is known of him. He died a few years after this [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 20.8.9-9.1]. 
	</p>
<p><b>came into Felix' room</b>—He
	was recalled, on accusations against him by the Jews of Cæsarea, and
	only acquitted through the intercession of his brother at court
	[JOSEPHUS, <i>Antiquities,</i>
	20.8,10]. 
	</p>
<p><b>Felix, willing to show the
	Jews a pleasure</b>—"to earn the thanks of the Jews,"
	which he did not. 
	</p>
<p><b>left Paul bound</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) —which does not seem to have been till then.</p>
