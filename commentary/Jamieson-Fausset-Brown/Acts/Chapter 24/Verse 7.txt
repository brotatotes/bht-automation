<p><b>7. But . . . Lysias came upon us,
	and with great violence took him out of our hands</b>—a wilful
	falsehood and calumnious charge against a public officer. He had
	commanded the Sanhedrim to meet for no other purpose than to "judge
	him according to their law"; and only when, instead of doing so,
	they fell to disputing among themselves, and the prisoner was in
	danger of being "pulled in pieces of them" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) —or as his own letter says "killed of them"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+23:27">Acts 23:27</span>) —did he rescue
	him, as was his duty, "by force" out of their hands.</p>
