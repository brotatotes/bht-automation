<p><b>13. King Agrippa</b>—great-grandson
	of Herod the Great, and Drusilla's brother (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). On his father's awful death (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), being thought too young (seventeen) to succeed, Judea,
	was attached to the province of Syria. Four years after, on the death
	of his uncle Herod, he was made king of the northern principalities
	of Chalcis, and afterwards got Batanea, Iturea, Trachonitis, Abilene,
	Galilee, and Perea, with the title of king. He died A.D.
	100, after reigning fifty-one years.

<p><b>and Bernice</b>—his sister.
	She was married to her uncle Herod, king of Chalcis, on whose death
	she lived with her brother Agrippa—not without suspicion of
	incestuous intercourse, which her subsequent licentious life tended
	to confirm. 
	</p>
<p><b>came to salute Festus</b>—to
	pay his respects to him on his accession to the procuratorship.</p>
