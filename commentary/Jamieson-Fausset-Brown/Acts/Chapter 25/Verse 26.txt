26. I have no certain—"definite"
	thing to write my lord—Nero.
	"The writer's accuracy should be remarked here. It would have
	been . . . a mistake to apply this term ("lord") to the
	emperor a few years earlier. Neither Augustus nor Tiberius would let
	himself be so called, as implying the relation of master and slave.
	But it had now come (rather, "was coming") into use as one
	of the imperial titles" [HACKET].
