<p><b>7. the Jews . . . from
	Jerusalem</b>—clamorously, as at Jerusalem; see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>many and grievous complaints
	against Paul</b>—From his reply, and Festus' statement of the case
	before Agrippa, these charges seem to have been a jumble of political
	and religious matter which they were unable to substantiate, and
	vociferous cries that he was unfit to live. Paul's reply, not given
	in full, was probably little more than a challenge to prove any of
	their charges, whether political or religious.</p>
