<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. PAUL'S
	DEFENSE OF HIMSELF
	BEFORE KING
	AGRIPPA, WHO
	PRONOUNCES HIM
	INNOCENT, BUT CONCLUDES
	THAT THE APPEAL
	TO CÃ†SAR MUST
	BE CARRIED

<p>This speech, though in substance
	the same as that from the fortress stairs of Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), differs from it in being less directed to meet the
	charge of apostasy from the Jewish faith, and giving more enlarged
	views of his remarkable change and apostolic commission, and the
	divine support under which he was enabled to brave the hostility of
	his countrymen.</p>
