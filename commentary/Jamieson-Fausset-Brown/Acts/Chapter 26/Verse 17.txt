<p><b>17. Delivering thee from the
	people</b>—the Jews. 
	</p>
<p><b>and </b><i><b>from</b></i><b>
	the Gentiles</b>—He was all along the object of Jewish malignity,
	and was at that moment in the hands of the Gentiles; yet he calmly
	reposes on his Master's assurances of deliverance from both, at the
	same time taking all precautions for safety and vindicating all his
	legal rights. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto whom now I send thee</b>—The
	emphatic "I" here denotes the authority of the Sender
	[BENGEL].</p>
