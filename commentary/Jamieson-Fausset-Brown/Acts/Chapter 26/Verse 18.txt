<p><b>18. To open their eyes, and to turn
	them from darkness to light</b>—rather, "that they may turn"
	(as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:20">Acts 26:20</span>), that is, as
	the effect of their eyes being opened. The whole passage leans upon
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1">Isaiah 61:1</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1- :">Isaiah 61:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and from the power of
	Satan</b>—Note the connection here between being "turned from
	darkness" and "from the power of Satan," whose whole
	power over men lies in keeping them <i>in the dark:</i> hence he is
	called "the ruler of the darkness of this world." See on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1- :">Isaiah 61:1- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>that they may receive
	forgiveness . . . and inheritance among the sanctified by faith that
	is in me</b>—<i>Note: Faith</i> is here made the instrument of
	salvation at once in its first stage, <i>forgiveness,</i> and its
	last, <i>admission to the home of the sanctified;</i> and the faith
	which introduces the soul to all this is emphatically declared by the
	glorified Redeemer to <i>rest upon Himself</i>—"FAITH,
	even THAT WHICH IS IN ME."
	And who that believes this can refrain from casting his crown before
	Him or resist offering Him supreme worship?</p>
