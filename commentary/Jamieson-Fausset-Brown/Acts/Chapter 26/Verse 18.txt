18. To open their eyes, and to turn
	them from darkness to light—rather, "that they may turn"
	(as in Acts 26:20), that is, as
	the effect of their eyes being opened. The whole passage leans upon
	Isaiah 61:1 (Isaiah 61:1- :). 
	and from the power of
	Satan—Note the connection here between being "turned from
	darkness" and "from the power of Satan," whose whole
	power over men lies in keeping them in the dark: hence he is
	called "the ruler of the darkness of this world." See on
	Isaiah 61:1- :. 
	that they may receive
	forgiveness . . . and inheritance among the sanctified by faith that
	is in me—Note: Faith is here made the instrument of
	salvation at once in its first stage, forgiveness, and its
	last, admission to the home of the sanctified; and the faith
	which introduces the soul to all this is emphatically declared by the
	glorified Redeemer to rest upon Himself—"FAITH,
	even THAT WHICH IS IN ME."
	And who that believes this can refrain from casting his crown before
	Him or resist offering Him supreme worship?
