<p><b>24. Festus said with a loud
	voice</b>—surprised and bewildered.

<p><b>Paul, thou art beside
	thyself, much learning doth make thee mad</b>—"is turning thy
	head." The union of flowing <i>Greek,</i> deep acquaintance with
	the sacred writings of his nation, reference to a resurrection and
	other doctrines to a Roman utterly unintelligible, and, above all,
	lofty religious earnestness, so strange to the cultivated,
	cold-hearted skeptics of that day—may account for this sudden
	exclamation.</p>
