28. Almost—or, "in a
	little time." 
	thou persuadest me to be a
	Christian—Most modern interpreters think the ordinary
	translation inadmissible, and take the meaning to be, "Thou
	thinkest to make me with little persuasion (or small trouble) a
	Christian"—but I am not to be so easily turned. But the
	apostle's reply can scarcely suit any but the sense given in
	our authorized version, which is that adopted by CHRYSOSTOM
	and some of the best scholars since. The objection on which so much
	stress is laid, that the word "Christian" was at that time
	only a term of contempt, has no force except on the other side; for
	taking it in that view, the sense is, "Thou wilt soon have me
	one of that despised sect."
