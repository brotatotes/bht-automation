<p><b>day and night, hope to

	thought—representing his despised nation, all scattered thought it
	now was, as twelve great branches of one ancient stem, in all places
	of their dispersion offering to the God of their fathers one unbroken
	worship, reposing on one great "promise" made of old unto
	their fathers, and sustained by one "hope" of "coming"
	to its fulfilment; the single point of difference between him and his
	countrymen, and the one cause of all their virulence against him,
	being, that his hope had found rest in One already come, while theirs
	still pointed to the future.

	king" (so the true reading appears to be); of all quarters the
	most surprising for such a charge to come from. The charge of
	<i>sedition</i> is not so much as alluded to throughout this speech.
	It was indeed a mere pretext.</p>
