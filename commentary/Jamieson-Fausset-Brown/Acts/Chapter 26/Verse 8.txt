<p><b>8. Why should it be thought a thing
	incredible . . . that God should raise the dead?</b>â€”rather, "Why
	is it judged a thing incredible if God raises the dead?" the
	case being viewed as an accomplished <i>fact.</i> No one dared to
	call in question the overwhelming evidence of the resurrection of
	Jesus, which proclaimed Him to be the Christ, the Son of God; the
	only way of getting rid of it, therefore, was to pronounce it
	incredible. But <i>why,</i> asks the apostle, <i>is it so judged?</i>
	Leaving this pregnant question to find its answer in the breasts of
	his audience, he now passes to his personal history.</p>
