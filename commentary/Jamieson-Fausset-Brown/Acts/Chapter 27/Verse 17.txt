17. undergirding the ship—that
	is, passing four or five turns of a cable-laid rope round the hull or
	frame of the ship, to enable her to resist the violence of the seas,
	an operation rarely resorted to in modern seamanship. 
	fearing lest they should fall
	into the quicksands—"be cast ashore" or "stranded
	upon the Syrtis," the Syrtis Major, a gulf on the African
	coast, southwest of Crete, the dread of mariners, owing to its
	dangerous shoals. 
	they strake—"struck"
	sail—This cannot be the
	meaning, for to strike sail would have driven them directly towards
	the Syrtis. The meaning must be, "lowered the gear"
	(appurtenances of every kind); here, perhaps, referring to the
	lowering of the heavy mainyard with the sail attached to it [SMITH].
