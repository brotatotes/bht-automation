<p><b>17. undergirding the ship</b>—that
	is, passing four or five turns of a cable-laid rope round the hull or
	frame of the ship, to enable her to resist the violence of the seas,
	an operation rarely resorted to in modern seamanship. 
	</p>
<p><b>fearing lest they should fall
	into the quicksands</b>—"be cast ashore" or "stranded
	upon the Syrtis," the <i>Syrtis Major,</i> a gulf on the African
	coast, southwest of Crete, the dread of mariners, owing to its
	dangerous shoals. 
	</p>
<p><b>they strake</b>—"struck"
	</p>
<p><b>sail</b>—This cannot be the
	meaning, for to strike sail would have driven them directly towards
	the Syrtis. The meaning must be, "lowered the gear"
	(appurtenances of every kind); here, perhaps, referring to the
	lowering of the heavy mainyard with the sail attached to it [SMITH].</p>
