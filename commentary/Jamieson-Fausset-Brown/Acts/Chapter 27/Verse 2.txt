<p><b>Adramyttium</b>—a port on

	expected to find another ship, bound for Italy, at some of the ports
	of Asia Minor, without having to go with this ship all the way to
	Adramyttium; and in this he was not disappointed. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.

	"Aristarchus the Macedonian," c. The word "one"
	should not have been introduced here by our translators, as if this
	name had not occurred before for we find him seized by the Ephesian
	mob as a "man of <i>Macedonia</i> and Paul's companion in
	travel" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>) and as
	a "<i>Thessalonian</i>" accompanying the apostle from
	Ephesus on his voyage back to Palestine (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29- :">Acts 19:29- :</span>). Here both these places are mentioned in connection with
	his name. After this we find him at Rome with the apostle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>;
