<p><b>days</b>—probably most of

<p><b>all hope that we should be

	had been unavailing; they could not tell which way to make for the
	nearest land, in order to run their ship ashore, the only resource
	for a sinking ship: but unless they did make the land, they must
	founder at sea. Their apprehensions, therefore, were not so much
	caused by the fury of the tempest, as by the state of the ship"
	[SMITH]. From the
	inferiority of ancient to modern naval architecture, leaks were
	sprung much more easily, and the means of repairing them were fewer
	than now. Hence the far greater number of shipwrecks from this cause.</p>
