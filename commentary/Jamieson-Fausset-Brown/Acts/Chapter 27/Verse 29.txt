<p><b>29. they cast four anchors out of
	the stern</b>—The ordinary way was to cast the anchor, as now, from
	the <i>bow:</i> but ancient ships, built with both ends alike, were
	fitted with hawseholes in the stern, so that in case of need they
	could anchor either way. And when the fear was, as here, that they
	might fall on the rocks <i>to leeward,</i> and the intention was to
	run the ship ashore as soon as daylight enabled them to fix upon a
	safe spot, the very best thing they could do was to anchor by the
	stern [SMITH]. In stormy
	weather two anchors were used, and we have instances of four being
	employed, as here.

<p><b>for day</b>—the remark this
	of one present, and with all his shipmates alive to the horrors of
	their condition. "The ship might go down at her anchors, or the
	coast to leeward might be iron-bound, affording no beach on which
	they could land with safety. Hence their anxious longing for day, and
	the ungenerous but natural attempt, not peculiar to ancient times, of
	the seamen to save their own lives by taking to the boat"
	[SMITH].</p>
