<p><b>31. Paul said to the centurion and
	to the soldiers</b>—the only parties now to be trusted, and whose
	own safety was now at stake. 
	</p>
<p><b>except ye abide in the ship
	ye cannot be saved</b>—The soldiers and passengers could not be
	expected to possess the necessary seamanship in so very critical a
	case. The flight of the crew, therefore, might well be regarded as
	certain destruction to all who remained. <i>In full assurance of
	ultimate safety, in virtue of a</i> DIVINE
	<i>pledge, to all in the ship, Paul speaks and acts throughout this
	whole scene in the exercise of a sound judgment as to the
	indispensable</i> HUMAN
	<i>conditions of safety;</i> and as there is no trace of any feeling
	of inconsistency between these two things in his mind, so even the
	centurion, under whose orders the soldiers acted on Paul's views,
	seems never to have felt perplexed by the twofold aspect, divine and
	human, in which the same thing presented itself to the mind of Paul.
	<i>Divine agency and human instrumentality are in all the events of
	life quite as much as here.</i> The only difference is that the one
	is for the most part shrouded from view, while the other is ever
	naked and open to the senses.</p>
