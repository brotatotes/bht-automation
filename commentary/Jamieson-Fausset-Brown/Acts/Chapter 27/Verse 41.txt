<p><b>41. falling into a place where two
	seas met</b>—SMITH
	thinks this refers to the channel, not more than one hundred yards
	broad, which separates the small island of Salmone from Malta,
	forming a communication between the sea inside the bay and that
	outside. 
	</p>
<p><b>the fore part stuck fast, and
	remained immovable</b>—"The rocks of Malta disintegrate into
	extremely minute particles of sand and clay, which, when acted upon
	by the currents or surface agitation, form a deposit of tenacious
	clay; but, in still waters, where these causes do not act, mud is
	formed; but it is only in creeks, where there are no currents, and at
	such a depth as to be undisturbed by the waves, that the mud occurs.
	A ship, therefore, impelled by the force of a gale, into a creek,
	with such a bottom, would strike a bottom of mud, graduating into
	tenacious clay, into which the fore part would fix itself, and be
	held fast, while the stern was exposed to the force of the waves"
	[SMITH].

<p><b>hinder part was broken</b>—The
	<i>continued action</i> denoted by the tense here is to be noted—"was
	fast breaking," going to pieces.</p>
