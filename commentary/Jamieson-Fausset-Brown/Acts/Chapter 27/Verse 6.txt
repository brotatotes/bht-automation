<p><b>6. there . . . found a ship of

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2">Acts 27:2</span>). As Egypt was the
	granary of Italy, and this vessel was laden with wheat (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2- :">Acts 27:2- :</span>), we need not wonder it was large enough to carry two
	hundred seventy-six souls, passengers and crew together (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:2- :">Acts 27:2- :</span>). Besides, the Egyptian merchantmen, among the largest in
	the Mediterranean, were equal to the largest merchantmen in our day.
	It may seem strange that on their passage from Alexandria to Italy
	they should be found at a Lycian port. But even still it is not
	unusual to stand to the north towards Asia Minor, for the sake of the
	current.</p>
