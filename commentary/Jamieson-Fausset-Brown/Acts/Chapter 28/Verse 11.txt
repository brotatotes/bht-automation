<p><b>was Castor and Pollux</b>—the
	tutelar gods of mariners, to whom all their good fortune was
	ascribed. St. Anthony is substituted for them in the modern
	superstitions of Mediterranean (Romanist) sailors. They carry his
	image in their boats and ships. It is highly improbable that two
	ships of Alexandra should have been casually found, of which the
	owners were able and willing to receive on board such a number of
	passengers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+27:6">Acts 27:6</span>). We may
	then reasonably conceive that it was compulsory on the owners to
	convey soldiers and state travellers [WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON].</p>
