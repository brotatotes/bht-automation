	ancient and celebrated capital of Sicily, on its eastern coast, about

	would wish to go ashore, to find out and break ground among the Jews
	and proselytes whom such a mercantile center would attract to it; and

	reverence and confidence of all classes with whom he came in contact.
	At any rate we cannot wonder that he should be regarded by the
	Sicilians as the founder of the Church of that island.
