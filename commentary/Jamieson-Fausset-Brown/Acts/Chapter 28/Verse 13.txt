13. from thence we fetched a
	compass—that is, proceeded circuitously, or tacked,
	working to windward probably, and availing themselves of the
	sinuosities of the coast, the wind not being favorable [SMITH].
	What follows confirms this. 
	and came to Rhegium—now
	Reggio, a seaport on the southwest point of the Italian coast,
	opposite the northeast point of Sicily, and at the entrance of the
	narrow straits of Messina. 
	after one day the south wind
	blew—a south wind having sprung up; being now favored with a
	fair wind, for want of which they had been obliged first to stay
	three days at Syracuse, and then to tack and put in for a day at
	Rhegium. 
	the next day to Puteoli—now
	Pozzuoli, situated on the northern part of the magnificent bay
	of Naples about one hundred eighty miles north of Rhegium, a distance
	which they might make, running before their "south wind,"
	in about twenty-six hours. The Alexandrian corn ships enjoyed a
	privilege peculiar to themselves, of not being obliged to strike
	their topsail on landing. By this they were easily recognized as they
	hove in sight by the crowds that we find gathered on the shore on
	such occasions [HOWSON].
