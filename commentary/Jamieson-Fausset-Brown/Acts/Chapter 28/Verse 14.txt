14, 15. Where we found brethren—not
	"the brethren" (see on  :-), from which one would conclude they did not expect to find
	such [WEBSTER and
	WILKINSON]. 
	and were desired—"requested."
	to tarry with them seven
	days—If this request came from Julius, it may have proceeded
	partly from a wish to receive instructions from Rome and make
	arrangements for his journey thither, partly from a wish to gratify
	Paul, as he seems studiously and increasingly to have done to the
	last. One can hardly doubt that he was influenced by both
	considerations. However this may be, the apostle had thus an
	opportunity of spending a Sabbath with the Christians of the place,
	all the more refreshing from his long privation in this respect, and
	as a seasoning for the unknown future that lay before him at the
	metropolis. 
	so we went toward Rome.
