<p><b>they came to meet us as far

<p><b>and the Three Taverns</b>—thirty
	miles from Rome. Thus they came to greet the apostle in two parties,
	one stopping short at the nearer, the other going on to the more
	distant place.

	thanked God</b>—for such a welcome. How sensitive he was to such
	Christian affection all his Epistles show (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, &amp;c.).

	long-cherished purpose to "see Rome" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), there to proclaim the unsearchable riches of Christ, and
	the divine pledge that in this he should be gratified (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), being now about to be auspiciously realized.</p>
