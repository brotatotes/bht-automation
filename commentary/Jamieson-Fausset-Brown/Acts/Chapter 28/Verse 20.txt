<p><b>20. For this cause . . . have I
	called for you . . . because . . . for the hope of Israel</b>—(See
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:2">Acts 28:2</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>I am bound with this
	chain</b>—"This cause is not so much mine as yours; it is the
	nation's cause; all that is dear to the heart and hope of Israel is
	bound up with this case of mine." From the touching allusions
	which the apostle makes to his chains, before Agrippa first, and here
	before the leading members of the Jewish community at Rome, at his
	first interview with them, one would gather that his great soul felt
	keenly his being in such a condition; and it is to this keenness of
	feeling, under the control of Christian principle, that we owe the
	noble use which he made of it in these two cases.</p>
