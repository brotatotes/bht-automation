22. we desire—"deem it
	proper" 
	to hear of thee what thou
	thinkest—what are thy sentiments, views, &c. The apparent
	freedom from prejudice here expressed may have arisen from a prudent
	desire to avoid endangering a repetition of those dissensions about
	Christianity to which, probably, SUETONIUS
	alludes, and which had led to the expulsion of the Jews under
	Claudius [HUMPHRY]. See on
	Acts 28:1.
