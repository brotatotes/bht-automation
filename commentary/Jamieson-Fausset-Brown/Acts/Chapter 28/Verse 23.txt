23, 24. there came
	many—"considerable numbers" 
	into his
	lodging—The word denotes one's place of stay as a guest
	(Philemon 1:1), not "his own
	hired house," mentioned in Philemon 1:1- :. Some Christian friends—possibly Aquila and Priscilla,
	who had returned to Rome (Romans 16:3),
	would be glad to receive him, though he would soon find himself more
	at liberty in a house of his own. 
	to whom he expounded and
	testified the kingdom of God—opening up the great spiritual
	principles of that kingdom in opposition to the contracted and
	secular views of it entertained by the Jews. 
	persuading them concerning
	Jesus—as the ordained and predicted Head of that kingdom. 
	out of the law . . . and the
	prophets—drawing his materials and arguments from a source
	mutually acknowledged. 
	from morning till
	evening—"Who would not wish to have been present?"
	exclaims BENGEL; but
	virtually we are present while listening to those
	Epistles which he dictated from his prison at Rome, and to his
	other epistolary expositions of Christian truth against the Jews.
