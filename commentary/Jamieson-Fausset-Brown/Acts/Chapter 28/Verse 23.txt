	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:1">Philemon 1:1</span>), not "his own
	hired house," mentioned in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:1- :">Philemon 1:1- :</span>. Some Christian friends—possibly Aquila and Priscilla,
	who had returned to Rome (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:3">Romans 16:3</span>),

	exclaims BENGEL; but
	virtually we <i>are</i> present while <i>listening</i> to those
