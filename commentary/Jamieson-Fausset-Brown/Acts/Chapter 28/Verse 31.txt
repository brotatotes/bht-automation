<p><b>31. with all confidence, no man
	forbidding him</b>—enjoying, in the uninterrupted exercise of his
	ministry, all the liberty of a <i>guarded</i> man. Thus closes this
	most precious monument of the beginnings of the Christian Church in
	its march from east to west, among the Jews first, whose center was
	Jerusalem; next among the Gentiles, with Antioch for its
	headquarters; finally, its banner is seen waving over imperial Rome,
	foretokening its universal triumphs. That distinguished apostle whose
	conversion, labors, and sufferings for "the faith which once he
	destroyed" occupy more than half of this History, it leaves a
	prisoner, unheard, so far as appears, for two years. His accusers,
	whose presence was indispensable, would have to await the return of
	spring before starting for the capital, and might not reach it for
	many months; nor, even when there, would they be so sanguine of
	success—after Felix, Festus, and Agrippa had all pronounced him
	innocent—as to be impatient of delay. And if witnesses were
	required to prove the charge advanced by Tertullus, that he was "a
	mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the [Roman] world"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:5">Acts 24:5</span>), they must have seen
	that unless considerable time was allowed them the case would
	certainly break down. If to this be added the capricious delays which
	the emperor himself might interpose, and the practice of Nero to hear
	but one charge at a time, it will not seem strange that the historian
	should have no proceedings in the case to record for two years.
	Begun, probably, before the apostle's arrival, its progress at Rome
	under his own eye would furnish exalted employment, and beguile many
	a tedious hour of his two years' imprisonment. Had the case come on
	for hearing during this period, much more if it had been disposed of,
	it is hardly conceivable that the History should have closed as it
	does. But if, at the end of this period, the Narrative only wanted
	the decision of the case, while hope deferred was making the heart
	sick (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12">Proverbs 13:12</span>), and if, under
	the guidance of that Spirit whose seal was on it all, it seemed of
	more consequence to put the Church at once in possession of this
	History than to keep it back indefinitely for the sake of what might
	come to be otherwise known, we cannot wonder that it should be wound
	up as it is in its two concluding verses. All that we know of the
	apostle's proceedings and history beyond this must be gathered from
	the <i>Epistles of the Imprisonment</i>—Ephesians, Philippians,
	Colossians, and Philemon—written during this period, and the
	<i>Pastoral Epistles</i>—to Timothy and Titus, which, in our
	judgment, are of subsequent date. From the former class of Epistles
	we learn the following particulars: (1) That the trying restraint
	laid upon the apostle's labors by his imprisonment had only turned
	his influence into a new channel; the Gospel having in consequence
	penetrated even into the palace, and pervaded the city, while the
	preachers of Christ were emboldened; and though the Judaizing portion
	of them, observing his success among the Gentiles, had been led to
	inculcate with fresh zeal their own narrower Gospel, even this had
	done much good by extending the truth common to both (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span>); (2) That as
	in addition to all his other labors, "the care of all the
	churches pressed upon him from day to-day" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span>), so with these churches he kept up an active
	correspondence by means of letters and messages, and on such errands
	he lacked not faithful and beloved brethren enough ready to be
	employed—<i>Luke; Timotheus; Tychicus;</i> (John) <i>Mark; Demas;
	Aristarchus; Epaphras; Onesimus; Jesus,</i> called Justus; and, for a
	short time, <i>Epaphroditus</i> (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span>; see
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span> to Ephesians,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span> to Philippians, and
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span> to Philemon). That the
	apostle suffered martyrdom under Nero at Rome has never been doubted.
	But that the appeal which brought him to Rome issued in his
	liberation, that he was at large for some years thereafter and took
	some wide missionary circuits, and that he was again arrested,
	carried to Rome, and then executed—was the undisputed belief of the
	early Church, as expressed by CHRYSOSTOM,
	JEROME, and EUSEBIUS,
	in the fourth century, up to CLEMENT
	OF ROME, the
	"fellow laborer" of the apostle himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span>), in the first century. The strongest possible confirmation
	of this is found in the Pastoral Epistles, which bear marks
	throughout of a more advanced state of the Church, and more matured
	forms of error, than can well have existed at any period before the
	appeal which brought the apostle to Rome; which refer to movements of
	himself and Timothy that cannot without some straining (as we think)
	be made to fit into any prior period; and which are couched in a
	manifestly riper style than any of his other Epistles. (See
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span> to First Timothy,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span> to Second Timothy
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12- :">Proverbs 13:12- :</span> to Titus and <i>Notes</i>).
	All this has been called in question by modern critics of great
	research and acuteness [PETAVIUS,
	LARDNER, DE
	WETTE, WIESELER,
	DAVIDSON, and others]. But
	those who maintain the ancient view are of equal authority and more
	numerous, while the weight of argument appears to us to be decidedly
	on their side.</p>
