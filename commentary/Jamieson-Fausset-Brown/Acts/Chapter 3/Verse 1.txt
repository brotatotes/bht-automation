<p><b>1-11. Peter and John</b>—already
	associated by their Master, first with James (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:29">Mark 1:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:37">Mark 5:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:2">Mark 9:2</span>),
	then by themselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:8">Luke 22:8</span>;
	and see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:23">John 13:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:24">John 13:24</span>).
	Now we find them constantly together, but John (yet young) only as a
	silent actor.
