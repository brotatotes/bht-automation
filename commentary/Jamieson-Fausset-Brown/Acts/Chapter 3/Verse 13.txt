<p><b>13. The God of Abraham,</b> c.—(See
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22">Acts 2:22</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:22- :">Acts 2:22- :</span>).

<p><b>hath glorified his Son
	Jesus</b>—rather, "his Servant Jesus," as the same word
	is rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:18">Matthew 12:18</span>, but
	in that high sense in which Isaiah applies it always to Messiah
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:1">Isaiah 42:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:6">Isaiah 49:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:13">Isaiah 52:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11">Isaiah 53:11</span>).
	When "Son" is intended a different word is used. 
	</p>
<p><b>whom ye delivered up,</b>
	&amp;c.—With what heroic courage does Peter here charge his
	auditors with the heaviest of all conceivable crimes, and with what
	terrific strength of language are these charges clothed!</p>
