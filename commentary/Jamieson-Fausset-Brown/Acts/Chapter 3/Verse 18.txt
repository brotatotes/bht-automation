<p><b>18. that Christ</b>—The best
	manuscripts read, "that His Christ." 
	</p>
<p><b>should suffer</b>—The
	doctrine of a SUFFERING
	MESSIAH was totally at
	variance with the current views of the Jewish Church, and hard to
	digest even by the Twelve, up to the day of their Lord's
	resurrection. Our preacher himself revolted at it, and protested
	against it, when first nakedly announced, for which he received a
	terrible rebuke. Here he affirms it to be the fundamental truth of
	ancient prophecy realized unwittingly by the Jews themselves, yet by
	a glorious divine ordination. How great a change had the Pentecostal
	illumination wrought upon his views!</p>
