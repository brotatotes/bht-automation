22-26. a prophet . . . like unto
	me—particularly in intimacy of communication with God
	(Numbers 12:6-8), and as
	the mediatorial Head of a new order of things (Numbers 12:6-4.12.8- :). Peter takes it for granted that, in the light of all he
	had just said, it would be seen at once that One only had any claim
	to be that Prophet. 
	him shall ye hear in all
	things, &c.—This part of the prediction is emphatically
	added, in order to shut up the audience to the obedience of faith, on
	pain of being finally "cut off" from the congregation of
	the righteous (Psalms 1:1).
