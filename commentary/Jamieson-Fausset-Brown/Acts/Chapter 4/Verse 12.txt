12. Neither is there salvation in
	any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men
	whereby we must be savedâ€”How sublimely does the apostle, in
	these closing words, shut up these rulers of Israel to Jesus for
	salvation, and in what universal and emphatic terms does he hold up
	his Lord as the one Hope of men!
