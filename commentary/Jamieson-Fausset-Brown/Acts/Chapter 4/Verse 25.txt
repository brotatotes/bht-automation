<p><b>25. by the mouth of . . . David</b>â€”to
	whom the Jews ascribed the second Psalm, though anonymous; and
	internal evidence confirms it. David's spirit sees with astonishment
	"the heathen, the people, the kings and princes of the earth,"
	in deadly combination against the sway of Jehovah and <i>His Anointed</i>
	(his Messiah, or Christ), and asks "why" it is. This fierce
	confederacy our praying disciples see in full operation, in the
	"gathering together of Herod and Pilate, the Gentiles (the Roman
	authority), and the people of Israel, against God's holy Child
	('Servant') Jesus." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The best ancient copies read, after "were gathered
	together," "<i>in this city,</i>" which probably
	answers to "upon my holy hill of Zion," in the <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
