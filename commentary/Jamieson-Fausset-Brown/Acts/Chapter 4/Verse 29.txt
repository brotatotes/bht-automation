29. now, Lord, behold their
	threatenings—Recognizing in the threatenings of the Sanhedrim a
	declaration of war by the combined powers of the world against their
	infant cause, they seek not enthusiastically to hide from themselves
	its critical position, but calmly ask the Lord of heaven and earth to
	"look upon their threatenings." 
	that with all boldness they
	may speak thy word—Rising above self, they ask only fearless
	courage to testify for their Master, and divine attestation to their
	testimony by miracles of healing, &c., in His name.
