<p><b>31. Prince and a Saviour</b>—the
	first word expressing that <i>Royalty</i> which all Israel looked for
	in Messiah, the second the <i>Saving</i> character of it which they
	had utterly lost sight of. Each of these features in our Lord's work
	enters into the other, and both make one glorious whole (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>to give</b>—dispensing as a
	"Prince." 
	</p>
<p><b>repentance and remission of
	sins</b>—as a "Saviour"; "repentance" embracing
	all that change which issues in the faith which secures "forgiveness"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:38">Acts 2:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:21">Acts 20:21</span>).
	How gloriously is Christ here exhibited; not, as in other places, as
	the <i>Medium,</i> but as the <i>Dispenser</i> of all spiritual
	blessings!</p>
