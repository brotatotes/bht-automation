<p><b>5. Ananias . . . gave up the ghost .
	. . great fear came on all that heard these things</b>â€”on those
	without the Christian circle; who, instead of disparaging the
	followers of the Lord Jesus, as they might otherwise have done on the
	discovery of such hypocrisy, were awed at the manifest presence of
	Divinity among them, and the mysterious power of throwing off such
	corrupt matter which rested upon the young Church.</p>
