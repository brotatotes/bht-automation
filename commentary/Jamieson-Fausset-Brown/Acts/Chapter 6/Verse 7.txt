7. word of God increased . . .
	disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly—prosperity crowning
	the beautiful spirit which reigned in this mother community. 
	a great company of the
	priests were obedient, c.—This was the crowning triumph of the
	Gospel, whose peaceful prosperity was now at its greatest
	height. After Stephen's teaching and trial made it clear that
	sacerdotal interests could not stand with the Gospel, such priestly
	accessions became rare indeed. Note (1) how easily misunderstandings
	may arise among the most loving and devoted followers of the Lord
	Jesus: but (2) How quickly and effectually such misunderstandings may
	be healed, where honest intentions, love, and wisdom reign: (3) What
	a beautiful model for imitation is furnished by the class here
	complained of, who, though themselves the majority, chose the new
	office-bearers from amongst the complaining minority! (4) How
	superior to the lust of power do the apostles here show themselves to
	be, in not only divesting themselves of the immediate superintendence
	of temporal affairs in the Christian community, but giving the choice
	of those who were to be entrusted with it to the disciples at large!
	(5) How little of formal organization did the apostles give to the
	Church at first, and when an emergency arose which demanded something
	more, how entirely was the remedy suggested by the reason of the
	thing! (6) Though the new office-bearers are not expressly called
	Deacons here, it is universally admitted that this was the
	first institution of that order in the Church the success of the
	expedient securing its permanency, and the qualifications for "the
	office of a Deacon" being laid down in one of the apostolical
	Epistles immediately after those of "a Bishop" ( :-).
