	MARTYRDOM OF STEPHEN.
	 
	</p>
<p>In this long defense Stephen takes
	a much wider range, and goes less directly into the point raised by
	his accusers, than we should have expected. His object seems to have
	been to show (1) that so far from disparaging, he deeply reverenced,
	and was intimately conversant with, the whole history of the ancient
	economy; and (2) that in resisting the erection of the Gospel kingdom
	they were but treading in their fathers' footsteps, the whole history
	of their nation being little else than one continued misapprehension
	of God's high designs towards fallen man and rebellion against them.</p>
