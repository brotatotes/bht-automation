<p><b>51-53. Ye stiffnecked . . . ye do
	always resist the Holy Ghost,</b> &amp;c.—It has been thought that
	symptoms of impatience and irritation in the audience induced Stephen
	to cut short his historical sketch. But as little farther light could
	have been thrown upon Israel's obstinacy from subsequent periods of
	the national history on the testimony of their own Scriptures, we
	should view this as the <i>summing up,</i> the brief import of the
	whole Israelitish history—<i>grossness of heart, spiritual
	deafness, continuous resistance of the Holy Ghost, down to the very
	council before whom Stephen was pleading.</i></p>
