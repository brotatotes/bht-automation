<p><b>56. I see . . . the Son of man

	speaking now not of himself at all (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14- :">Revelation 14:14- :</span>), but entirely by the Spirit, is led to repeat the very
	words in which Jesus Himself, <i>before this same council,</i> had
	foretold His glorification (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14- :">Revelation 14:14- :</span>), assuring them that that exaltation of the SON
