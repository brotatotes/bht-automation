	one to whom Christianity—whether as developed in the New Testament
	or as established in the world—owes more perhaps than to all the
	other apostles together! Here he is, having perhaps already a seat in
	the Sanhedrim, some thirty years of age, in the thick of this
	tumultuous murder of a distinguished witness for Christ, not only
	"consenting unto his death" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:12- :">Hebrews 13:12- :</span>), but doing his own part of the dark deed.</p>
