<p><b>59, 60. calling upon God and saying,
	Lord Jesus,</b> c.—An unhappy supplement of our translators is the
	word "God" here as if, while addressing the Son, he was
	really calling upon the Father. The sense is perfectly clear without
	any supplement at all—"calling upon [invoking] and saying,
	Lord Jesus"; Christ being the Person directly invoked and
	addressed by name (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Even GROTIUS,
	DE WETTE,
	MEYER, c., admit this,
	adding several other examples of direct prayer to Christ and PLINY,
	in his well-known letter to the Emperor Trajan (A.D.
	110 or 111), says it was part of the regular Christian service to
	sing, in alternate strains, a hymn to Christ as God.

<p><b>Lord Jesus, receive my
	spirit</b>—In presenting to Jesus the identical prayer which He
	Himself had on the cross offered to His Father, Stephen renders to
	his glorified Lord absolute divine worship, in the most sublime form,
	and at the most solemn moment of his life. In this commitment of his
	spirit to Jesus, Paul afterwards followed his footsteps with a calm,
	exultant confidence that with Him it was safe for eternity (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
