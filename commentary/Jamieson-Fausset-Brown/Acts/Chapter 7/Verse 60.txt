<p><b>60. cried with a loud voice</b>—with
	something of the gathered energy of his dying Lord (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Lord</b>—that is, JESUS,
	beyond doubt, whom he had just before addressed as Lord. 
	</p>
<p><b>lay not this sin to their
	charge</b>—Comparing this with nearly the same prayer of his dying
	Lord, it will be seen how very richly this martyr of Jesus had drunk
	into his Master's spirit, in its divinest form. 
	</p>
<p><b>he fell asleep</b>—<i>never
	said of the death of Christ.</i> (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). How bright the record of this first martyrdom for Christ,
	amidst all the darkness of its perpetrators; and how many have been
	cheered by it to like faithfulness even unto death!</p>
