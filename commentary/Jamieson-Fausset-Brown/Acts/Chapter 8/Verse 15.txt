<p><b>15, 16. prayed . . . they might
	receive the Holy Ghost. (For only they were baptized in the name of
	the Lord Jesus)</b>—As the baptism of adults presupposed "the
	renewing of the Holy Ghost" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:5-7">Titus 3:5-7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span>), of which the
	profession of faith had to be taken for evidence, this communication
	of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the apostles' hands was clearly
	a <i>superadded</i> thing; and as it was only <i>occasional,</i> so
	it was invariably <i>attended with miraculous manifestations</i> (see
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44">Acts 10:44</span>, where it followed
	Peter's preaching; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:44- :">Acts 10:44- :</span>, where, as here, it followed the laying on of hands). In
	the present case an important object was served by it—"the
	sudden appearance of a body of baptized disciples in Samaria, by the
	agency of one who was not an apostle, requiring the presence and
	power of apostles to perform their special part as the divinely
	appointed founders of the Church" [ALFORD].
	Beautiful, too, was the spectacle exhibited of Jew and Samaritan, one
	in Christ.</p>
