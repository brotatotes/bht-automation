24. Pray ye to the Lord for me—Peter
	had urged him to pray for himself: he asks those wonder-working men
	to do it for him; having no confidence in the prayer of faith, but
	thinking that those men possessed some peculiar interest with heaven.
	that none of these things
	dome upon me—not that the thought of his wicked heart might be
	forgiven him, but only that the evils threatened might be averted
	from him. While this throws great light on Peter's view of his
	melancholy case, it shows that Christianity, as something divine,
	still retained its hold of him. (Tradition represents him as turning
	out a great heresiarch, mingling Oriental or Grecian philosophy with
	some elements of Christianity.)
