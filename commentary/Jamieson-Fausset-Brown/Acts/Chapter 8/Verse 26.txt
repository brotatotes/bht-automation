<p><b>go . . . south, the way that
	goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza</b>—There was such a road, across
	Mount Hebron, which Philip might take without going to Jerusalem (as
	VON RAUMER'S'S
	<i>Palæstina</i> shows).

<p><b>which is desert</b>—that
	is, <i>the way;</i> not Gaza itself, which was the southernmost city
	of Palestine, in the territory of the ancient Philistines. To go from
	a city, where his hands had been full of work, so far away on a
	desert road, could not but be staggering to the faith of Philip,
	especially as he was kept in ignorance of the object of the journey.
	But like Paul, he "was not disobedient to the heavenly vision";
	and like Abram, "he went out not knowing whither he went"
