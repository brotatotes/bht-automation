28. Was returning—Having come
	so far, he not only stayed out the days of the festival, but
	prolonged his stay till now. It says much for his fidelity and value
	to his royal mistress that he had such liberty. But the faith in
	Jehovah and love of His worship and word, with which he was imbued,
	sufficiently explain this. 
	and sitting in his chariot,
	read Esaias—Not contented with the statutory services in which
	he had joined, he beguiles the tedium of the journey homeward by
	reading the Scriptures. But this is not all; for as Philip "heard
	him read the prophet Esaias," he must have been reading aloud
	and not (as is customary still in the East) so as merely to be
	audible, but in a louder voice than he would naturally have used if
	intent on his own benefit only: evidently therefore he was reading
	to his charioteer.
