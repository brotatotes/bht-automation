	was led as a sheep, &c.â€”One cannot but wonder that this, of
	all predictions of Messiah's sufferings in the Old Testament the most
	striking, should have been that which the eunuch was reading before
	Philip joined him. He could hardly miss to have heard at Jerusalem of
	the sufferings and death of Jesus, and of the existence of a
	continually increasing party who acknowledged Him to be the Messiah.
	But his question to Philip, whether the prophet in this passage meant
	himself or some other man, clearly shows that he had not the least
	idea of any connection between this prediction and those facts.
