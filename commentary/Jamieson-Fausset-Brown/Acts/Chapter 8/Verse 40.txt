<p><b>40. Philip was found</b>—that is,
	"found himself," "made his appearance": an
	expression confirming the miraculous manner of his transportation. 
	</p>
<p><b>at Azotus</b>—the ancient
	Ashdod. 
	</p>
<p><b>preached in all the
	cities</b>—along the coast, proceeding northward. 
	</p>
<p><b>till he came to
	Cæsarea</b>—fifty-five miles northwest of Jerusalem, on the
	Mediterranean, just south of Mount Carmel; and so named by Herod, who
	rebuilt it, in honor of Cæsar Augustus. Henceforth we lose sight of
	zealous and honored Philip, as by and by we shall lose sight even of
	Peter. As the chariot of the Gospel rolls on, other agents are raised
	up, each suited to his work. But "he that soweth and he that
	reapeth shall rejoice together." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
