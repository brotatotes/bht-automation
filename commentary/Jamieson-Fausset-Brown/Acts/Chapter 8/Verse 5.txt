<p><b>5. Then Philip</b>—not the apostle
	of that name, as was by some of the Fathers supposed; for besides
	that the apostles remained at Jerusalem, they would in that case have
	had no occasion to send a deputation of their own number to lay their
	hands on the baptized disciples [GROTIUS].
	It was the deacon of that name, who comes next after Stephen in the
	catalogue of the seven, probably as being the next most prominent.
	The persecution may have been directed especially against Stephen's
	colleagues [MEYER]. 
	</p>
<p><b>the city of Samaria</b>—or
	"a city of Samaria"; but the former seems more likely. "It
	furnished the bridge between Jerusalem and the world"
	[BAUMGARTEN].</p>
