1. Saul, yet breathing out
	threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord,
	c.â€”The emphatic "yet" is intended to note the remarkable
	fact, that up to this moment his blind persecuting rage against the
	disciples of the Lord burned as fiercely as ever. (In the teeth of
	this, NEANDER and
	OLSHAUSEN picture him
	deeply impressed with Stephen's joyful faith, remembering passages of
	the Old Testament confirmatory of the Messiahship of Jesus, and
	experiencing such a violent struggle as would inwardly prepare the
	way for the designs of God towards him. Is not dislike, if not
	unconscious disbelief, of sudden conversion at the bottom of
	this?) The word "slaughter" here points to cruelties not
	yet recorded, but the particulars of which are supplied by himself
	nearly thirty years afterwards: "And I persecuted this way unto
	the death" (Acts 22:4)
	"and when they were put to death, I gave my voice [vote]
	against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and
	compelled them to [did my utmost to make them] blaspheme; and being
	exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange
	[foreign] cities" (Acts 26:10;
	Acts 26:11). All this was before
	his present journey.
