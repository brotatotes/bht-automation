11. go into the street . . . called
	Straight—There is still a street of this name in Damascus,
	about half a mile in length, running from east to west through the
	city [MAUNDRELL]. 
	and inquire in the house of
	Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus—There is something touching
	in the minuteness of these directions. Tarsus was the capital of the
	province of Cilicia, lying along the northeast coast of the
	Mediterranean. It was situated on the river Cydnus, was a "large
	and populous city" (says XENOPHON,
	and see Acts 21:39), and under
	the Romans had the privilege of self-government. 
	behold, he prayeth—"breathing
	out" no longer "threatenings and slaughter," but
	struggling desires after light and life in the Persecuted One.
	Beautiful note of encouragement as to the frame in which Ananias
	would find the persecutor.
