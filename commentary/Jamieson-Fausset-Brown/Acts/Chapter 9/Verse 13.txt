13. Ananias answered, Lord, I have
	heard by many of this man, c.—"The objections of Ananias,
	and the removal of them by the Lord, display in a very touching
	manner the childlike relation of the believing soul to its Redeemer.
	The Saviour speaks with Ananias as a man does with his friend"
	[OLSHAUSEN]. 
	how much evil he hath done to
	thy saints—"Thy saints," says Ananias to
	Christ therefore Christ is God [BENGEL].
	So, in Acts 9:14, Ananias
	describes the disciples as "those that called on Christ's name."
	See on Acts 7:59; and compare
	1 Corinthians 1:2.
