17-19. Ananias went his way, and
	putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul—How beautifully
	childlike is the obedience of Ananias to "the heavenly vision!"
	the Lord, even Jesus—This
	clearly shows in what sense the term "Lord" is used in this
	book. It is JESUS that is
	meant, as almost invariably in the Epistles also. 
	who appeared unto thee in the
	way—This knowledge by an inhabitant of Damascus of what had
	happened to Saul before entering it, would show him at once that this
	was the man whom Jesus had already prepared him to expect. 
	and be filled with the Holy
	Ghost—which Ananias probably, without any express instructions
	on that subject, took it for granted would descend upon him; and not
	necessarily after his baptism [BAUMGARTEN,
	WEBSTER and WILKINSON]—for
	Cornelius and his company received it before theirs ( :-) —but perhaps immediately after the recovery of his
	sight by the laying on of Ananias' hands.
