<p><b>17-19. Ananias went his way, and

	childlike is the obedience of Ananias to "the heavenly vision!"

<p><b>the Lord, even Jesus</b>—This
	clearly shows in what sense the term "Lord" is used in this
	book. It is JESUS that is
	meant, as almost invariably in the Epistles also.

<p><b>who appeared unto thee in the

	happened to Saul before entering it, would show him at once that this
	was the man whom Jesus had already prepared him to expect.

<p><b>and be filled with the Holy
	Ghost</b>—which Ananias probably, without any express instructions
	on that subject, took it for granted would descend upon him; and not
	necessarily after his baptism [BAUMGARTEN,
	WEBSTER and WILKINSON]—for
	Cornelius and his company received it before theirs (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) —but perhaps immediately after the recovery of his
	sight by the laying on of Ananias' hands.</p>
