<p><b>26. And when Saul was come to
	Jerusalem</b>—"three years after" his conversion, and
	particularly "to see Peter" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); no doubt because he was the leading apostle, and to
	communicate to him the prescribed sphere of his labors, specially to
	"the Gentiles."

<p><b>he assayed to join himself to
	the disciples</b>—simply as one of them, leaving his apostolic
	commission to manifest itself.

<p><b>they were all afraid of him,</b>
	c.—knowing him only as a persecutor of the faith the rumor of his
	conversion, if it ever was cordially believed, passing away during
	his long absence in Arabia, and the news of his subsequent labors in
	Damascus perhaps not having reached them.</p>
