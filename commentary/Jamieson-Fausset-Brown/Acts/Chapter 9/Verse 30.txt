	himself says of this journey, that he "came into the regions of

	instead of sailing direct for Tarsus, he landed at Seleucia,
	travelled thence to Antioch, and penetrated from this northward into
	Cilicia, ending his journey at Tarsus. As this was his first visit to

	ever was there again. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:21- :">Galatians 1:21- :</span>). It probably was now that he became the instrument of

	"sister," and perhaps her "son," of whom mention
