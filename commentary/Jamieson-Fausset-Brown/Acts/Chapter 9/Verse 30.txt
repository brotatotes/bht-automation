	express injunctions to this effect. (See on  :-). 
	and sent him forth to
	Tarsus—In Galatians 1:21 he
	himself says of this journey, that he "came into the regions of
	Syria and Cilicia"; from which it is natural to infer that
	instead of sailing direct for Tarsus, he landed at Seleucia,
	travelled thence to Antioch, and penetrated from this northward into
	Cilicia, ending his journey at Tarsus. As this was his first visit to
	his native city since his conversion, so it is not certain that he
	ever was there again. (See on Galatians 1:21- :). It probably was now that he became the instrument of
	gathering into the fold of Christ those "kinsmen," that
	"sister," and perhaps her "son," of whom mention
	is made in Acts 23:16; Romans 16:7;
	Romans 16:11; Romans 16:21
