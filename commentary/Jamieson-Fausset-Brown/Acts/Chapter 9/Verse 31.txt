31. Then had all the churches
	rest—rather, "the Church," according to the best
	manuscripts and versions. But this rest was owing not so much to the
	conversion of Saul, as probably to the Jews being engrossed with the
	emperor Caligula's attempt to have his own image set up in the temple
	of Jerusalem [JOSEPHUS,
	Antiquities, 18.8.1, c.]. 
	throughout all Judea, and
	Galilee, and Samaria—This incidental notice of distinct
	churches already dotting all the regions which were the chief scenes
	of our Lord's ministry, and that were best able to test the facts on
	which the whole preaching of the apostles was based, is extremely
	interesting. "The fear of the Lord" expresses their holy
	walk "the comfort of the Holy Ghost," their "peace and
	joy in believing," under the silent operation of the blessed
	Comforter.

	The historian now returns to
	Peter, in order to introduce the all-important narrative of Cornelius
	(Acts 10:1-48). The
	occurrences here related probably took place during Saul's sojourn in
	Arabia.
