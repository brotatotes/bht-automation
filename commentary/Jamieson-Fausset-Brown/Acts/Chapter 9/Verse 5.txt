<p><b>5. Who art thou, Lord?</b>—"Jesus
	knew Saul ere Saul knew Jesus" [BENGEL].
	The term "Lord" here is an indefinite term of respect for
	some unknown but august speaker. That Saul saw as well as <i>heard</i>
	this glorious Speaker, is expressly said by Ananias (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14">Acts 22:14</span>), by Barnabas (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14- :">Acts 22:14- :</span>), and by himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:14- :">Acts 22:14- :</span>); and in claiming apostleship, he explicitly states that he
	had "<i>seen</i> the Lord" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:8">1 Corinthians 15:8</span>), which can refer only
	to this scene. 
	</p>
<p><b>I am Jesus whom thou
	persecutest</b>—The "I" and "thou" here are
	touchingly emphatic in the original; while the term "JESUS"
	is purposely chosen, to convey to him the thrilling information that
	the hated name which he sought to hunt down—"<i>the Nazarene,</i>"
	as it is in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:8">Acts 22:8</span> —was now
	speaking to him from the skies, "crowned with glory and honor"
	(see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:9">Acts 26:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>It is hard for thee to kick
	against the pricks</b>—The metaphor of an ox, only driving the goad
	deeper by kicking against it, is a classic one, and here forcibly
	expresses, not only the vanity of all his measures for crushing the
	Gospel, but the deeper wound which every such effort inflicted upon
	himself.</p>
