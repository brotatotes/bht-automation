7. the men . . . stood
	speechless—This may mean merely that they remained so; but if
	the standing posture be intended, we have only to suppose that
	though at first they "all fell to the earth" ( :-), they arose of their own accord while Saul yet lay
	prostrate. 
	hearing a—rather "the"
	voice—Paul himself
	says, "they heard not the voice of Him that spake to me"
	(Acts 22:9). But just as "the
	people that stood by heard" the voice that saluted our
	Lord with recorded words of consolation and assurance, and yet heard
	not the articulate words, but thought "it thundered" or
	that some "angel spake to Him" (John 12:28;
	John 12:29) —so these men heard
	the voice that spake to Saul, but heard not the articulate
	words. Apparent discrepancies like these, in the different
	narratives of the same scene in one and the same book of Acts,
	furnish the strongest confirmation both of the facts themselves and
	of the book which records them.
