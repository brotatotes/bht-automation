<p><b>8. Saul arose . . . and when his
	eyes were opened, he saw no man</b>â€”after beholding the Lord, since
	he "could not see for the glory of that light" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), he had involuntarily closed his eyes to protect them from
	the glare; and on opening them again he found his vision gone. "It
	is not said, however, that he was <i>blind,</i> for it was no
	punishment" [BENGEL].</p>
