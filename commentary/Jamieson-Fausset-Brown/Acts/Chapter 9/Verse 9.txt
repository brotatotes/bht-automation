<p><b>9. And he was three days without
	sight, and neither did eat nor drink</b>—that is, according to the
	<i>Hebrew</i> mode of computation: he took no food during the
	remainder of that day, the entire day following, and so much of the
	subsequent day as elapsed before the visit of Ananias. Such a period
	of entire abstinence from food, in that state of mental absorption
	and revolution into which he had been so suddenly thrown, is in
	perfect harmony with known laws and numerous facts. But what three
	days those must have been! "Only one other space of three days'
	duration can be mentioned of equal importance in the history of the
	world" [HOWSON].
	Since Jesus had been revealed not only to his <i>eyes</i> but to his
	<i>soul</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>),
	the double conviction must have immediately flashed upon him, that
	his whole reading of the Old Testament hitherto had been wrong, and
	that the system of legal righteousness in which he had, up to that
	moment, rested and prided himself was false and fatal. What materials
	these for spiritual exercise during those three days of total
	darkness, fasting, and solitude! On the one hand, what
	self-condemnation, what anguish, what death of legal hope, what
	difficulty in believing that in such a case there could be hope at
	all; on the other hand, what heartbreaking admiration of the grace
	that had "pulled him out of the fire," what resistless
	conviction that there must be a purpose of love in it, and what
	tender expectation of being yet honored, as a chosen vessel, to
	declare what the Lord had done for his soul, and to spread abroad the
	savor of that Name which he had so wickedly, though ignorantly,
	sought to destroy—must have struggled in his breast during those
	memorable days! Is it too much to say that all that profound insight
	into the Old Testament, that comprehensive grasp of the principles of
	the divine economy, that penetrating spirituality, that vivid
	apprehension of man's lost state, and those glowing views of the
	perfection and glory of the divine remedy, that beautiful ideal of
	the loftiness and the lowliness of the Christian character, that
	large philanthropy and burning zeal to spend and be spent through all
	his future life for Christ, which distinguish the writings of this
	chiefest of the apostles and greatest of men, were all quickened into
	life during those three successive days?</p>
