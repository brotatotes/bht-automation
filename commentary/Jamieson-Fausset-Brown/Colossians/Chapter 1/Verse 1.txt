	been companion of Paul in his first tour through Phrygia, in which
	Colosse was. Hence the Colossians seem to have associated him with

	during their tour through Phrygia, individual Colossians, as
	Epaphras, Philemon, Archippus, and Apphia (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1- :">Colossians 2:1- :</span>), who when converted brought the Gospel to their native city.</p>
