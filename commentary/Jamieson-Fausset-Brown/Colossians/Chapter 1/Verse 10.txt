<p><b>10.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "So as to
	walk"; so that ye may walk. True knowledge of God's will is
	inseparable from walking conformably to it. 
	</p>
<p><b>worthy of the Lord</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>unto</b>—so as in every way
	to be well-pleasing to God. 
	</p>
<p><b>pleasing</b>—literally,
	"<i>desire of pleasing.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>being fruitful</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"bearing fruit." This is the first manifestation of their
	"walking worthy of the Lord." The second is, "increasing
	(growing) in the knowledge of God (or as the oldest manuscripts read,
	'growing BY the full
	knowledge of God')"; thus, as the <i>Gospel word</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1- :">Ephesians 4:1- :</span>) was said to "bring forth fruit," and to "grow"
	in all the world, even as it did in the Colossians, ever since the
	day they <i>knew</i> the grace of God, so here it is Paul's prayer
	that <i>they</i> might continue to "bring forth fruit," and
	"grow" more and more <i>by the full knowledge</i> of God,
	the more that "knowledge" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1- :">Ephesians 4:1- :</span>) was imparted to them. The full knowledge of God is the real
	<i>instrument</i> of enlargement in soul and life of the believer
	[ALFORD]. The third
	manifestation of their walk is (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1- :">Ephesians 4:1- :</span>), "Being strengthened with all might," &amp;c. The
	fourth is (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:12">Colossians 1:12</span>), "Giving
	thanks unto the Father," &amp;c.</p>
