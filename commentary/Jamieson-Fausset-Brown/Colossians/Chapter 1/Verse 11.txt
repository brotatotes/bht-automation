11. Greek, "Being
	made mighty with (literally, 'in') all might." 
	according to his glorious
	power—rather, "according to the power (the characteristic
	of 'His glory,' here appropriate to Paul's argument, Ephesians 1:19;
	Ephesians 6:10; as its exuberant
	'riches,' in Ephesians 3:16) of His
	glory." His power is inseparable from His glory (Ephesians 3:16- :). 
	unto all patience—so as
	to attain to all patient endurance; persevering, enduring
	continuance in the faith, in spite of trials of persecutors, and
	seductions of false teachers. 
	long-suffering—towards
	those whom one could repel. "Patience," or "endurance,"
	is exercised in respect to those whom one cannot repel [CHRYSOSTOM].
	with joyfulness—joyful
	endurance (Acts 16:25; Romans 5:3;
	Romans 5:11).
