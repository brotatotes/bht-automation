<p><b>11.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "Being
	made mighty with (literally, '<i>in</i>') all might." 
	</p>
<p><b>according to his glorious
	power</b>—rather, "according to the power (the characteristic
	of 'His glory,' here appropriate to Paul's argument, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span>; as its exuberant

<p><b>unto all patience</b>—so as
	to attain to all <i>patient endurance;</i> persevering, enduring
	continuance in the faith, in spite of trials of persecutors, and
	seductions of false teachers. 
	</p>
<p><b>long-suffering</b>—towards
	those whom one could repel. "Patience," or "endurance,"
	is exercised in respect to those whom one cannot repel [CHRYSOSTOM].
