<p><b>which hath made us
	meet</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "who <i>made</i> us meet." Not "<i>is
	making</i> us meet" by progressive growth in holiness; but <i>once
	for all made</i> us meet. It is not <i>primarily</i> the <i>Spirit's</i>
	work that is meant here, as the text is often used; but the <i>Father's</i>
	work in putting us by adoption, once for all, in a new standing,
	namely, <i>that of children.</i> The believers meant here were in
	different stages of progressive sanctification; but in respect to the
	meetness specified here, they all alike had it from the Father, in
	Christ His Son, being "complete in Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4-48.4.6- :">Galatians 4:4-48.4.6- :</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17">John 17:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:1">Judges 1:1</span>, "sanctified by God
	<i>the Father</i>"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>.
	Still, <i>secondarily,</i> this once-for-all meetness contains in it
	the germ of sanctification, afterwards developed progressively in the
	life by the Father's Spirit in the believer. The Christian life of
	heavenliness is the first stage of heaven itself. There must, and
	will be, a <i>personal</i> meetness for heaven, where there is a
	<i>judicial</i> meetness.

<p><b>to be partakers,</b>
	c.—<i>Greek,</i> "for the (or '<i>our</i>') portion of the
	inheritance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:32">Acts 20:32</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>) of the saints in
	light." "Light" begins in the believer here,
	descending from "the Father of lights" by Jesus, "the
	true light," and is perfected in the kingdom of light, which
	includes knowledge, purity, love, and joy. It is contrasted here with
	the "darkness" of the unconverted state (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11- :">Ephesians 1:11- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>).</p>
