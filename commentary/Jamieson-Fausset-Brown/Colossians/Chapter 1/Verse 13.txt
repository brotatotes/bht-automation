<p><b>13. from</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "<i>out
	of</i> the power," out of the sphere in which his power is
	exercised. 
	</p>
<p><b>darkness</b>—blindness,
	hatred, misery [BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>translated</b>—Those thus
	translated as to state, are also transformed as to character. Satan
	has an organized dominion with various orders of powers of evil
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>).
	But the term "kingdom" is rarely applied to his usurped
	rule (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:26">Matthew 12:26</span>); it is
	generally restricted to the kingdom of God. 
	</p>
<p><b>his dear Son</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "the Son of His love": the Son on whom His
	love rests (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:26">John 17:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>):
	contrasted with the "darkness" where all is hatred and
	hateful.</p>
