<p><b>15.</b> They who have experienced in
	themselves "redemption" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), know Christ in the glorious character here described, as
	above the highest angels to whom the false teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) taught worship was to be paid. Paul describes Him: (1) in
	relation to God and creation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); (2) in relation to the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). As the former regards Him as the Creator (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>) and the Sustainer (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16- :">Colossians 1:16- :</span>) of the natural world; so the latter, as the source and stay
	of the new moral creation.

<p><b>image</b>—exact likeness
	and perfect Representative. Adam was made "in the image of God"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:27">Genesis 1:27</span>). But Christ, the
	second Adam, perfectly reflected visibly "the invisible God"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17">1 Timothy 1:17</span>), whose glories the
	first Adam only in part represented. "Image" (<i>eicon</i>)
	involves "likeness" (<i>homoiosis</i>); but "likeness"
	does not involve "image." "Image" always supposes
	a prototype, which it not merely resembles, but from which it is
	drawn: the exact counterpart, as the reflection of the sun in the
	water: the child the living image of the parent. "Likeness"
	implies mere <i>resemblance,</i> not the exact <i>counterpart</i> and
	<i>derivation</i> as "image" expresses; hence it is nowhere
	applied to the Son, while "image" is here, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:17- :">1 Timothy 1:17- :</span> [TRENCH].
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:9">John 14:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>). Even before His
	incarnation He was the image of the invisible God, as the Word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3- :">Hebrews 1:3- :</span>) by whom God created the worlds, and by whom God appeared
	to the patriarchs. Thus His <i>essential</i> character as <i>always</i>
	"the image of God," (1) before the incarnation, (2) in the
	days of His flesh, and (3) now in His glorified state, is, I think,
	contemplated here by the verb "is."

<p><b>first-born of every creature</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span>), "the
	first-begotten": "begotten of His Father before all worlds"
	[<i>Nicene Creed</i>]. Priority and superlative dignity is implied
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:27">Psalms 89:27</span>). <i>English Version</i>
	might seem to favor Arianism, as if Christ were a creature.
	Translate, "Begotten (literally, 'born') <i>before</i> every
	creature," as the context shows, which gives the reason why He
	is so designated. "For," c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:17">Colossians 1:17</span>) [TRENCH].
	This expression is understood by ORIGEN
	(so far is the <i>Greek</i> from favoring Socinian or Arian views) as
	declaring <i>the Godhead</i> of Christ, and is used by Him as a
	phrase to mark that <i>Godhead,</i> in contrast with His <i>manhood</i>
	[Book 2, sec. <i>Against Celsus</i>]. The <i>Greek</i> does not
	strictly admit ALFORD'S
	translation, "the first-born of all creation."</p>
