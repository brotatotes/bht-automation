<p><b>16. For</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Because." This gives the proof that He is not included in
	the things created, but is the "first-begotten" before
	"every creature" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), begotten as "the Son of God's love" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), antecedently to all other emanations: "for" all
	these other emanations came from Him, and whatever was created, <i>was
	created by Him.</i>
</p>
<p><b>by him</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>in</i> Him": as the conditional element, pre-existent
	and all-including: the creation of all things BY
	<i>Him</i> is expressed afterwards, and is a different fact from the
	present one, though implied in it [ALFORD].
	God revealed Himself in the Son, the Word of the Father, <i>before
	all created existence</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). That Divine Word carries IN
	<i>Himself the archetypes of all existences,</i> so that "IN
	<i>Him</i> all things that are in heaven and earth have been
	created." The "in Him" indicates that the Word is the
	ideal ground of all existence; the "<i>by</i> Him," below,
	that He is the <i>instrument</i> of actually realizing the divine
	idea [NEANDER]. His
	essential nature as the Word of the Father is not a mere appendage of
	His incarnation, but is the ground of it. The original relation of
	the Eternal Word to men "made in His image" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), is the source of the new relation to them by redemption,
	formed in His incarnation, whereby He restores them to His lost
	image. "<i>In</i> Him" implies something prior to "by"
	and "for Him" presently after: the three prepositions mark
	in succession the beginning, the progress, and the end [BENGEL].

<p><b>all things</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the</i> universe of things." That the <i>new creation</i>
	is not meant in this verse (as Socinians interpret), is plain; for
	<i>angels,</i> who are included in the catalogue, were not <i>new
	created</i> by Christ; and he does not speak of the new creation till
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>. The creation "of
	the things that are in the <i>heavens</i>" (so <i>Greek</i>)
	includes the creation of the <i>heavens themselves:</i> the former
	are rather named, since the inhabitants are more noble than their
	dwellings. Heaven and earth and all that is m them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+29:11">1 Chronicles 29:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:6">Nehemiah 9:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:6">Revelation 10:6</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>invisible</b>—the world of
	spirits. 
	</p>
<p><b>thrones, or
	dominions</b>—<i>lordships:</i> the thrones are the greater of the
	two. 
	</p>
<p><b>principalities, or
	powers</b>—rather, "<i>rules,</i> or <i>authorities</i>":
	the former are stronger than the latter (compare <i>Note,</i> see on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:6- :">Revelation 10:6- :</span>). The latter pair refer to
	offices <i>in respect to God's creatures:</i> "thrones and
	dominions" express exalted <i>relation to God,</i> they being
	the <i>chariots</i> on which He rides displaying His glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:6- :">Revelation 10:6- :</span>). The existence of various orders of angels is established
	by this passage. 
	</p>
<p><b>all things</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the whole universe of things." 
	</p>
<p><b>were</b>—rather, to
	distinguish the <i>Greek</i> aorist, which precedes from the perfect
	tense here, "<i>have been</i> created." In the former case
	the creation was viewed as <i>a past act at a point of time,</i> or
	as done once for all; here it is viewed, not merely as one historic
	act of creation in the past, but as the <i>permanent result now and
	eternally continuing.</i>

<p><b>by him</b>—as the
	instrumental Agent (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>for him</b>—as the grand
	<i>End</i> of creation; containing in Himself the reason why creation
	is at all, and why it is as it is [ALFORD].
	He is the <i>final</i> cause as well as the <i>efficient</i> cause.
	LACHMANN'S punctuation of
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15-18">Colossians 1:15-18</span> is best,
	whereby "the first-born of every creature" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15-51.1.18- :">Colossians 1:15-51.1.18- :</span>) answers to "the first-born from the dead" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15-51.1.18- :">Colossians 1:15-51.1.18- :</span>), the whole forming one sentence with the words ("All
	things were created by Him and for Him, and He is before all things,
	and by Him all things consist, and He is the Head of the body, the
	Church") intervening as a parenthesis. Thus Paul puts first, <i>the
	origination by Him of the natural creation;</i> secondly, <i>of the
	new creation.</i> The parenthesis falls into four clauses, two and
	two: the former two support the first assertion, "the first-born
	of every creature"; the latter two prepare us for "the
	first-born from the dead"'; the former two correspond to the
	latter two in their form—"All things by Him . . . and He is,"
	and "By Him all things . . . and He is."</p>
