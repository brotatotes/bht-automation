<p><b>18.</b> Revelation of Christ to the
	Church and the new creation, as the Originator of both. 
	</p>
<p><b>he</b>—emphatical. Not
	angels in opposition to the false teachers' doctrine concerning
	angel-worship, and the power of Oeons or (imaginary) spirit
	emanations from God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:10">Colossians 2:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>head of the body, the
	church</b>—The Church is His body by virtue of His entering into
	communion corporeally with human nature [NEANDER],
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22">Ephesians 1:22</span>). The same One who is
	the Head of all things and beings by creation, is also, by virtue of
	being "the first-born from the dead," and so "the
	first-fruits" of the new creation among men, the Head of the
	Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>who is</b>—that is, in that
	He is the Beginning [ALFORD].
	Rather, this is <i>the beginning of a new paragraph.</i> As the
	former paragraph, which related to His originating the <i>physical</i>
	creation, began with "Who is" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22- :">Ephesians 1:22- :</span>); so this, which treats of His originating the new creation,
	begins with "who is"; a parenthesis preceding, which closes
	the former paragraph, that parenthesis (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:22- :">Ephesians 1:22- :</span>), including from "all things were created by Him,"
	to "Head of the body, the Church." The <i>head</i> of kings
	and high priests was anointed, as the seat of the faculties, the
	fountain of dignity, and <i>original</i> of all the members
	(according to <i>Hebrew</i> etymology). So Jesus by His unction was
	designated as the <i>Head</i> of the body, the Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>the beginning</b>—namely,
	of the new creation, as of the old (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:22">Proverbs 8:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1- :">John 1:1- :</span>): the beginning of the Church of the first-born (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1- :">John 1:1- :</span>), as being Himself the "first-born from the dead"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:23">Acts 26:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:23">1 Corinthians 15:23</span>). Christ's
	primogeniture is threefold: (1) From eternity the "first-begotten"
	of the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>); (2)
	As the first-born of His mother (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15- :">Colossians 1:15- :</span>); (3) As the Head of the Church, mystically begotten of the
	Father, as it were to a new life, on the day of His resurrection,
	which is His "regeneration," even as His people's coming
	resurrection will be their "regeneration" (that is, the
	resurrection which was begun in the soul, extended to the body and to
	the whole creation, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:22">Romans 8:22</span>) (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:28">Matthew 19:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>).
	Sonship and resurrection are similarly connected (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:36">Luke 20:36</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>). Christ by rising from
	the dead is the efficient cause (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2- :">1 John 3:2- :</span>), as having obtained the power, and the exemplary cause, as
	being the pattern (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+2:13">Micah 2:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21">Philippians 3:21</span>),
	of our resurrection: the resurrection of "the Head"
	involves consequentially that of the members. 
	</p>
<p><b>that in all things</b>—He
	resumes the "all things" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21- :">Philippians 3:21- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>he might have the
	pre-eminence</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "He HIMSELF
	<i>may</i> (thus) become the One holding the first place," or,
	"take the precedency." Both ideas are included, priority in
	<i>time</i> and priority in <i>dignity:</i> now in the regenerated
	world, as before in the world of creation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:21- :">Philippians 3:21- :</span>). "Begotten before every creature, or "first-born
	of every creature" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:27">Psalms 89:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>).</p>
