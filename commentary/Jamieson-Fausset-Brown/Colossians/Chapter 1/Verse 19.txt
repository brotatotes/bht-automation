19. Greek, "(God)
	was well pleased," c. 
	in him—that is, in the
	Son (Matthew 3:17). 
	all fulness—rather as
	Greek, "all the fulness," namely, of God,
	whatever divine excellence is in God the Father (Colossians 2:9
Ephesians 3:19; compare John 1:16;
	John 3:34). The Gnostics used the
	term "fulness," for the assemblage of emanations, or
	angelic powers, coming from God. The Spirit presciently by Paul warns
	the Church, that the true "fulness" dwells in Christ alone.
	This assigns the reason why Christ takes precedence of every creature
	(Colossians 1:15). For two reasons
	Christ is Lord of the Church: (1) Because the fulness of the divine
	attributes (Colossians 1:19) dwells in
	Him, and so He has the power to govern the universe; (2)
	Because (Colossians 1:20) what He has
	done for the Church gives Him the right to preside over it. 
	should . . . dwell—as
	in a temple (John 2:21). This
	indwelling of the Godhead in Christ is the foundation of the
	reconciliation by Him [BENGEL].
	Hence the "and" (John 2:21- :) connects as cause and effect the two things, the Godhead
	in Christ, and the reconciliation by Christ.
