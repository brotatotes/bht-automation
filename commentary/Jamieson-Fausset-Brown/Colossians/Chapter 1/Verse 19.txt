<p><b>all fulness</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "all <i>the</i> fulness," namely, <i>of God,</i>
	whatever divine excellence is in God the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:19">Ephesians 3:19</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:16">John 1:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:34">John 3:34</span>). The Gnostics used the
	term "fulness," for the assemblage of emanations, or
	angelic powers, coming from God. The Spirit presciently by Paul warns
	the Church, that the true "fulness" dwells in Christ alone.
	This assigns the reason why Christ takes precedence of every creature
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>). For two reasons
	Christ is Lord of the Church: (1) Because the fulness of the divine
	attributes (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:19">Colossians 1:19</span>) dwells in
	Him, and so He has the <i>power</i> to govern the universe; (2)
	Because (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>) what He has
	done for the Church gives Him the <i>right</i> to preside over it.

<p><b>should . . . dwell</b>—as
	in a temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:21">John 2:21</span>). <i>This
	indwelling of the Godhead in Christ</i> is the foundation of <i>the
	reconciliation</i> by Him [BENGEL].
	Hence the "and" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:21- :">John 2:21- :</span>) connects as cause and effect the two things, <i>the Godhead
	in Christ, and the reconciliation by Christ.</i></p>
