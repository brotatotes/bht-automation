<p><b>21.</b> The Colossians are included
	in this general reconciliation (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12">Ephesians 2:12</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>sometime</b>—"once."
	</p>
<p><b>alienated</b>—from God and
	salvation: objectively <i>banished from</i> God, through the barrier
	which God's justice interposed against your sin: subjectively
	<i>estranged</i> through the alienation of your own wills from God.
	The former is the prominent thought (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12- :">Ephesians 2:12- :</span>), as the second follows, "enemies in your mind."
	"Actual <i>alienation</i> makes habitual 'enemies'"
	[BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>in your mind</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in your understanding" or "thought" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:3">Ephesians 2:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:18">Ephesians 4:18</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>by wicked works</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "<i>in your</i> wicked works" (wicked
	works were the element <i>in</i> which your <i>enmity</i> subsisted).
	</p>
<p><b>yet now</b>—<i>Notwithstanding</i>
	the former alienation, <i>now</i> that Christ has come, <i>God</i>
	hath <i>completely reconciled,</i> or restored to His friendship
	<i>again</i> (so the <i>Greek,</i> compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:18- :">Ephesians 4:18- :</span>).</p>
