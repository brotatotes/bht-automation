<p><b>22. In the body of his flesh</b>—the
	element in which His reconciling sufferings had place. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "afflictions of Christ <i>in my flesh</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Angels who have not a "body of flesh" are not in
	any way our reconciling mediators, as your false teachers assert, but
	He, the Lord of angels, who has taken our <i>flesh,</i> that <i>in</i>
	it He might atone for our fallen manhood.

<p><b>through death</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "through <i>His</i> death" (which could only
	take place in a body like ours, of flesh, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). This implies He took on Him our true and entire manhood.
	<i>Flesh</i> is the sphere in which His human sufferings could have
	place (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>to present you</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15- :">Ephesians 2:15- :</span>). The end of His reconciling atonement by death. 
	</p>
<p><b>holy</b>—positively; and in
	relation to God. 
	</p>
<p><b>unblamable . . .
	unreprovable</b>—negatively. "Without blemish" (as the
	<i>former Greek</i> word is translated as to Jesus, our Head, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15- :">Ephesians 2:15- :</span>) <i>in one's self. Irreproachable</i> (the <i>Greek</i> for
	the <i>second</i> word, <i>one who gives no occasion for his being
	brought to a law court</i>) <i>is in relation to the world without.
	Sanctification,</i> as the fruit, is here treated of; <i>justification,</i>
	by Christ's reconciliation, as the tree, having preceded (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:26">Ephesians 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>). At the same time, our
	sanctification is regarded here as <i>perfect</i> in Christ, into
	whom we are grafted at regeneration or conversion, and who is "made
	of God unto us (perfect) sanctification" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:1">Judges 1:1</span>):
	not merely <i>progressive</i> sanctification, which is the <i>gradual
	development</i> of the sanctification which Christ is made to the
	believer from the first. 
	</p>
<p><b>in his sight</b>—in God's
	sight, at Christ's appearing.</p>
