<p><b>which ye have heard . . .
	which was preached to every creature . . . whereof I . . . am . . . a
	minister</b>—Three arguments against their being "moved away
	from the Gospel": (1) Their having heard it; (2) The
	universality of the preaching of it; (3) Paul's ministry in it. For
	"to (<i>Greek,</i> 'in') every creature," the oldest
	manuscripts read, "in <i>all creation.</i>" Compare "in
	all the world," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>;
	"all things . . . in earth," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6- :">Colossians 1:6- :</span> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15">Mark 16:15</span>): thus he
	implies that the Gospel from which he urges them <i>not to be moved,</i>
	has this mark of truth, namely, the universality of its announcement,
	which accords with the command and prophecy of Christ Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15- :">Mark 16:15- :</span>). By "<i>was</i> preached," he means not merely
	"<i>is being preached,</i>" but <i>has been actually, as an
	accomplished fact, preached.</i> PLINY,
	not many years subsequently, in his famous letter to the Emperor
	Trajan [<i>Epistles,</i> Book X., Epistle 97], writes, "Many of
	every age, rank, and sex, are being brought to trial. For the
	contagion of that superstition [Christianity] has spread over not
	only cities, but villages and the country." 
	</p>
<p><b>whereof I Paul am</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "<i>was made</i> a minister." Respect for
	me, the minister of this world-wide Gospel, should lead you not to be
	moved from it. Moreover (he implies), the Gospel which ye heard from
	Epaphras, your "minister" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:15- :">Mark 16:15- :</span>), is the same of which "I was made a minister"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:25">Colossians 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:7">Ephesians 3:7</span>):
	if you be moved from it, ye will desert the teaching of the
	recognized ministers of the Gospel for unauthorized false teachers.</p>
