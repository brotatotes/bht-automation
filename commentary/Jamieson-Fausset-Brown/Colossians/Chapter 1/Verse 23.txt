	which ye have heard . . .
	which was preached to every creature . . . whereof I . . . am . . . a
	minister—Three arguments against their being "moved away
	from the Gospel": (1) Their having heard it; (2) The
	universality of the preaching of it; (3) Paul's ministry in it. For
	"to (Greek, 'in') every creature," the oldest
	manuscripts read, "in all creation." Compare "in
	all the world," Colossians 1:6;
	"all things . . . in earth," Colossians 1:6- : (Mark 16:15): thus he
	implies that the Gospel from which he urges them not to be moved,
	has this mark of truth, namely, the universality of its announcement,
	which accords with the command and prophecy of Christ Himself (Mark 16:15- :). By "was preached," he means not merely
	"is being preached," but has been actually, as an
	accomplished fact, preached. PLINY,
	not many years subsequently, in his famous letter to the Emperor
	Trajan [Epistles, Book X., Epistle 97], writes, "Many of
	every age, rank, and sex, are being brought to trial. For the
	contagion of that superstition [Christianity] has spread over not
	only cities, but villages and the country." 
	whereof I Paul am—rather
	as Greek, "was made a minister." Respect for
	me, the minister of this world-wide Gospel, should lead you not to be
	moved from it. Moreover (he implies), the Gospel which ye heard from
	Epaphras, your "minister" (Mark 16:15- :), is the same of which "I was made a minister"
	(Colossians 1:25; Ephesians 3:7):
	if you be moved from it, ye will desert the teaching of the
	recognized ministers of the Gospel for unauthorized false teachers.
