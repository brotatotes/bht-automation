	The <i>mystery,</i> once hidden, now revealed, is redemption for the
	whole Gentile world, as well as for the Jews, "Christ in <i>you</i>
	(Gentiles) the hope of glory" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:5-49.3.9- :">Ephesians 3:5-49.3.9- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>from ages</b>—"from,"
	according to ALFORD,
	refers to time, not "hidden from": from the time of the
	ages; still what is meant is that the mystery was hidden from <i>the
	beings living in those</i> "<i>ages.</i>" The "ages"
	are the vast successive periods marked by successive orders of beings
	and stages of creation. <i>Greek,</i> "Æons," a word used
	by the Gnostics for angelic beings emanating from God. The Spirit by
	Paul presciently, in opposition to Gnostic error already beginning
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>), teaches, that the
	mystery of redemption was hidden in God's purposes in Christ, alike
	from the <i>angelic beings</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18- :">Colossians 2:18- :</span>) of the pre-Adamic "ages," and from the subsequent
	<i>human</i> "generations." Translate as <i>Greek,</i> "<i>the</i>
	ages . . . <i>the</i> generations."

<p><b>made manifest to his
