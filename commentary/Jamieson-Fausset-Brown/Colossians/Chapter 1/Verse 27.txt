	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:3">Colossians 2:3</span>, "all the
	<i>treasures</i>" of <i>wisdom;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:3- :">Colossians 2:3- :</span>, "the unsearchable <i>riches</i> of <i>Christ</i>";
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>, "<i>riches</i> of
	His <i>grace.</i>" "<i>The glory</i> of this mystery"
	must be the glory which this once hidden, and now revealed, truth
	makes you Gentiles partakers of, partly now, but mainly when Christ
	shall come (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:4">Colossians 3:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:17">Romans 8:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:18">Romans 8:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>). This sense is proved
	by the following: "Christ in you the hope of <i>the</i> (so
	<i>Greek</i>) <i>glory.</i>" The lower was the degradation of
	you Gentiles, the higher is the richness of the glory to which the
	mystery revealed now raises you. You were "without <i>Christ,</i>
	and having <i>no hope</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18- :">Ephesians 1:18- :</span>). Now you have "<i>Christ</i> in you the <i>hope</i> of
	<i>the</i> glory" just mentioned. ALFORD
	translates, "Christ among you," to answer to "this
	mystery <i>among</i> the Gentiles." But the whole clause,
	"Christ IN you (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18- :">Ephesians 1:18- :</span>) the hope of glory," answers to "this mystery,"
	and not to the whole sentence, "this mystery <i>among</i> the
	Gentiles." What is <i>made known</i> "among you Gentiles"
	is, "Christ <i>in</i> you (now by faith as your <i>hidden</i>
	life, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:3">Colossians 3:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>)
	the hope of glory" (your manifested life). The contrast
	(antithesis) between "CHRIST
	IN YOU" now as your <i>hidden</i> life, and "the
	hope of glory" hereafter to be <i>manifested,</i> requires this
	translation.</p>
