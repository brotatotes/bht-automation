27. would—rather as Greek,
	"willed," or "was pleased to make
	known." He resolves all into God's good pleasure and
	will, that man should not glory save in God's grace. 
	what—How full and
	inexhaustible! 
	the riches of the glory of
	this mystery—He accumulates phrase on phrase to enhance the
	greatness of the blessing in Christ bestowed by God on the Gentiles.
	Compare Colossians 2:3, "all the
	treasures" of wisdom; Colossians 2:3- :, "the unsearchable riches of Christ";
	Ephesians 1:7, "riches of
	His grace." "The glory of this mystery"
	must be the glory which this once hidden, and now revealed, truth
	makes you Gentiles partakers of, partly now, but mainly when Christ
	shall come (Colossians 3:4; Romans 5:2;
	Romans 8:17; Romans 8:18;
	Ephesians 1:18). This sense is proved
	by the following: "Christ in you the hope of the (so
	Greek) glory." The lower was the degradation of
	you Gentiles, the higher is the richness of the glory to which the
	mystery revealed now raises you. You were "without Christ,
	and having no hope" (Ephesians 1:18- :). Now you have "Christ in you the hope of
	the glory" just mentioned. ALFORD
	translates, "Christ among you," to answer to "this
	mystery among the Gentiles." But the whole clause,
	"Christ IN you (Ephesians 1:18- :) the hope of glory," answers to "this mystery,"
	and not to the whole sentence, "this mystery among the
	Gentiles." What is made known "among you Gentiles"
	is, "Christ in you (now by faith as your hidden
	life, Colossians 3:3; Galatians 2:20)
	the hope of glory" (your manifested life). The contrast
	(antithesis) between "CHRIST
	IN YOU" now as your hidden life, and "the
	hope of glory" hereafter to be manifested, requires this
	translation.
