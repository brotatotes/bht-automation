<p><b>29. Whereunto</b>—namely, "to

<p><b>I also labour</b>—rather,
	"I labor also." I not only "proclaim" (<i>English
	Version,</i> "preach") Christ, but I <i>labor</i> also.

<p><b>striving</b>—in "conflict"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span>) of spirit (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1- :">Colossians 2:1- :</span>). The same <i>Greek</i> word is used of Epaphras (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1- :">Colossians 2:1- :</span>), "<i>laboring fervently</i> for you in prayers":
	literally, "agonizing," "striving as in the agony of a
	contest." So Jesus in Gethsemane when praying (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1- :">Colossians 2:1- :</span>): so "strive" (the same <i>Greek</i> word,
	"agonize"), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:24">Luke 13:24</span>.
	So Jacob "<i>wrestled</i>" in prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:24- :">Luke 13:24- :</span>). Compare "contention," <i>Greek,</i> "agony,"
	or "striving earnestness," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:24- :">Luke 13:24- :</span>.

<p><b>according to his working</b>—Paul
	avows that he has power to "strive" in spirit for his
	converts, so far only as <i>Christ</i> works in him and by him
