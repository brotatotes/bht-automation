<p><b>6. Which is come unto you</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Which is present among you," that is, which has come to,
	and remains with, you. He speaks of the word as a living person
	<i>present</i> among them. 
	</p>
<p><b>as </b><i><b>it is</b></i><b>
	in all the world</b>—<i>virtually,</i> as it was by this time
	preached in the leading parts of the then known world; <i>potentially,</i>
	as Christ's command was that the Gospel should be preached to all
	nations, and not be limited, as the law was, to the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:38">Matthew 13:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:14">Matthew 24:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>).
	However, the true reading, and that of the oldest manuscripts, is
	that which omits the following "and," thus (the "<i>it
	is</i>" of <i>English Version</i> is not in the original <i>Greek</i>):
	"As in all the world it is bringing forth fruit <i>and growing</i>
	(so the oldest manuscripts read; <i>English Version</i> omits 'and
	growing,' without good authority), even as it doth in you also."
	Then what is asserted is not that the Gospel has been preached in all
	the world, but that it is <i>bearing fruits</i> of righteousness, and
	(like a tree <i>growing</i> at the same time that it is <i>bearing
	fruit</i>) <i>growing in numbers</i> of its converts in, or
	throughout, all the world.
