<p><b>8. your love</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); "to all the saints." 
	</p>
<p><b>in the Spirit</b>—the
	sphere or element IN which
	alone true love is found; as distinguished from the state of those
	"in the flesh" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>).
	Yet even they needed to be stirred up to greater love (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9- :">Romans 8:9- :</span>). Love is the first and chief fruit of the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9- :">Romans 8:9- :</span>).</p>
