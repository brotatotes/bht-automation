<p><b>9. we also</b>—on our part. 
	</p>
<p><b>heard it</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>pray</b>—Here he states
	what in <i>particular</i> he prays for; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> he stated <i>generally</i> the fact of his praying for them. 
	</p>
<p><b>to desire</b>—"to make
	request." 
	</p>
<p><b>might be filled</b>—rather,
	"<i>may</i> be filled"; a verb, often found in this Epistle
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:12">Colossians 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:17">Colossians 4:17</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>knowledge</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>full and accurate</i> knowledge." Akin to the Greek for
	"knew" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:6">Colossians 1:6</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>of his will</b>—as to how
	ye ought to walk (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:17">Ephesians 5:17</span>); as
	well as chiefly that "mystery of His will, according to His good
	pleasure which He purposed in Himself; that in the fulness of times
	He might gather together in one all things in Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>); God's "will,"
	whereby He eternally purposed to reconcile to Himself, and save men
	by Christ, not by angels, as the false teachers in some degree taught
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>) [ESTIUS].
	There seems to have been a want of <i>knowledge</i> among the
	Colossians; notwithstanding their general excellencies; hence he so
	often dwells on this subject (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:28">Colossians 1:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:3">Colossians 2:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:13">Colossians 3:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:6">Colossians 4:6</span>).
	On the contrary he less extols <i>wisdom</i> to the Corinthians, who
	were puffed up with the conceit of knowledge. 
	</p>
<p><b>wisdom</b>—often mentioned
	in this Epistle, as opposed to the (false) "philosophy" and
	"show of wisdom" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:8">Colossians 2:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23- :">Colossians 2:23- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>understanding</b>—sagacity
	to discern what on each occasion is suited to the place and the time;
	its seat is "the understanding" or intellect; wisdom is
	more general and has its seat in the whole compass of the faculties
	of the soul [BENGEL].
	"Wouldst thou know that the matters in the word of Christ are
	real things? Then never read them for mere knowledge sake"
	[Quoted by GAUSSEN.]
	Knowledge is desirable only when seasoned by "spiritual
	understanding."</p>
