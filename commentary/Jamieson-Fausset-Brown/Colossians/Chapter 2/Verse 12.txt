12. Translate, "Having
	been buried with Him in your baptism." The past
	participle is here coincident in time with the preceding verb, "ye
	were (Greek) circumcised." Baptism is regarded as the
	burial of the old carnal life, to which the act of immersion
	symbolically corresponds; and in warm climates where immersion
	is safe, it is the mode most accordant with the significance of the
	ordinance; but the spirit of the ordinance is kept by affusion, where
	immersion would be inconvenient or dangerous; to insist on literal
	immersion in all cases would be mere legal ceremonialism (Romans 6:3;
	Romans 6:4).

	through the faith, c.—by
	means of your faith in the operation of God so "faith
	of," for "faith in" (Ephesians 3:12;
	Philippians 3:9). Faith in God's mighty
	operation in raising again Jesus, is saving faith (Romans 4:24;
	Romans 10:9); and it is wrought in
	the soul by His same "mighty working" whereby He "raised
	Jesus from the dead" (Ephesians 1:19;
	Ephesians 1:20). BENGEL
	seems to me (not as ALFORD
	understands him) to express the latter sense, namely, "Through
	the faith which is a work of the operation of God who,"
	c. Ephesians 1:19 Ephesians 1:20
	accords with this; the same mighty power of God is exercised in
	raising one spiritually dead to the life of faith, as was "wrought
	in Christ when God raised Him literally from the dead." However,
	"faith of" usually is "faith in" (Ephesians 1:20- :); but there is no grammatical impropriety in understanding
	it "the faith which is the effect of the operation of God"
	(Ephesians 2:8; 1 Thessalonians 2:13).
	As His literal resurrection is the ground of the power put forth in
	our spiritual resurrection now, so it is a pledge of our literal
	resurrection hereafter (Romans 8:11).
