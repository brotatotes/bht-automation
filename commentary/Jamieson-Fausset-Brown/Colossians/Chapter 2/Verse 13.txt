	even as Christ was among the dead, before that God raised Him "from
	the dead" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>).

<p><b>sins</b>—rather as <i>Greek</i>
	is translated at end of this verse, "trespasses,"
	literally, "failings aside" from God's ways; actual
	transgressions, as that of Adam. 
	</p>
<p><b>uncircumcision of your
	flesh</b>—your not having put off the old fleshly nature, the
	carnal foreskin, or <i>original sin,</i> which now by spiritual
	circumcision, that is, conversion and baptism, you have put off. 
	</p>
<p><b>he quickened</b>—GOD
	"quickened together with Him (CHRIST)."
	Just as Christ's resurrection proved that He was delivered from the
	sin laid on Him, so our spiritual quickening proves that we have been
	forgiven our sins (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:1">1 Peter 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:2">1 Peter 4:2</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>forgiven you</b>—So <i>Vulgate</i>
	and HILARY. But the oldest
	manuscripts read, "us," passing from the particular
	persons, the Colossians, to the general Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:14">Colossians 1:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>).

<p><b>all trespasses</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"all <i>our</i> trespasses."</p>
