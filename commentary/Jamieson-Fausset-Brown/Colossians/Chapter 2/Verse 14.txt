<p><b>14. Blotting out</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Having wiped out"; coincident in time with "having
	forgiven you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:13">Colossians 2:13</span>);
	hereby having <i>cancelled</i> the law's indictment against you. The
	law (including especially the <i>moral</i> law, wherein lay the chief
	difficulty in obeying) is abrogated to the believer, as far as it was
	a compulsory, accusing code, and as far as "righteousness"
	(justification) and "life" were sought for by it. It can
	only produce outward works, not inward obedience of the will, which
	in the believer flows from the Holy Spirit in Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:21">Romans 3:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:2">Romans 7:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:19">Galatians 2:19</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the handwriting of
	ordinances</b>—rather, "IN
	ordinances" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:19- :">Galatians 2:19- :</span>);
	"the law of commandments contained in ordinances." "The
	handwriting" (alluding to the Decalogue, the representative of
	the law, <i>written by the hand</i> of God) is <i>the whole law,</i>
	the obligatory bond, under which all lay; the Jews primarily were
	under the bond, but they in this respect were the representative
	people of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:19">Romans 3:19</span>);
	and in their inability to keep the law was involved the inability of
	the Gentiles also, in whose hearts "the work of the law was
	written" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span>); and as
	they did not keep this, they were condemned by it. 
	</p>
<p><b>that was against us . . .
	contrary to us</b>—<i>Greek</i> "<i>adversary</i> to us";
	so it is translated, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:27">Hebrews 10:27</span>.
	"Not only was the law <i>against us</i> by its demands, but also
	<i>an adversary</i> to us by its accusations" [BENGEL].
	TITTMANN explains the
	<i>Greek,</i> "having a <i>latent</i> contrariety to us";
	not <i>open designed</i> hostility, but virtual unintentional
	opposition through our frailty; not through any opposition in <i>the
	law itself</i> to our good (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7-12">Romans 7:7-12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:14">Romans 7:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:56">1 Corinthians 15:56</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:21">Galatians 3:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:3">Hebrews 10:3</span>).
	The "WRITING" is
	part of "that which was contrary to us"; for "the
	<i>letter</i> killeth" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:3- :">Hebrews 10:3- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and took it</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	and hath taken it out of the way" (so as to be no longer a
	hindrance to us), by "nailing it to <i>the</i> cross."
	Christ, by bearing the curse of the broken law, has redeemed us from
	its curse (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>). In His
	person nailed to the cross, the law itself was nailed to it. One
	ancient mode of cancelling bonds was by striking a nail through the
	writing: this seems at that time to have existed in Asia [GROTIUS].
	The bond cancelled in the present case was the obligation lying
	against the Jews as representatives of the world, and attested by
	their <i>amen,</i> to keep the whole law under penalty of the curse
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+27:26">Deuteronomy 27:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ne+10:29">Nehemiah 10:29</span>).</p>
