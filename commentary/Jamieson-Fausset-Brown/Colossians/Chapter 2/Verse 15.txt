<p><b>15.</b> ALFORD,
	ELLICOTT, and others
	translate the <i>Greek</i> to accord with the translation of the same
	<i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:9">Colossians 3:9</span>,
	"Stripping off from Himself the principalities and the powers: "
	GOD put off from Himself
	<i>the angels,</i> that is, their ministry, not employing them to be
	promulgators of the Gospel in the way that He had given the law by
	their "disposition" or ministry (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:53">Acts 7:53</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:19">Galatians 3:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:5">Hebrews 2:5</span>): God manifested Himself
	without a veil in Jesus. "THE
	principalities and THE
	powers" refers back to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:5- :">Hebrews 2:5- :</span>, Jesus, "the Head of all principality and power,"
	and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>. In the sacrifice
	of Jesus on the cross, God subjected all the principalities, c., to
	Jesus, declaring them to be powerless as to His work and His people
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>). Thus Paul's
	argument against those grafting on Christianity Jewish observances,
	along with angel-worship, is, whatever part angels may be supposed to
	have had under the law, now at an end, God having put the legal
	dispensation itself away. But the objection is, that the context
	<i>seems</i> to refer to a triumph over <i>bad angels:</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21- :">Ephesians 1:21- :</span>, however, Christ's <i>triumph</i> over those subjected to
	Him, is not a triumph for destruction, but for their salvation, so
	that good angels <i>may</i> be referred to (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21- :">Ephesians 1:21- :</span>). But the <i>Greek</i> middle is susceptible of <i>English
	Version,</i> "having spoiled," or, literally [TITTMANN],
	"having <i>completely</i> stripped," or "despoiled"
	<i>for Himself</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38">Romans 8:38</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24">1 Corinthians 15:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:2">Ephesians 6:2</span>).
	<i>English Version</i> accords with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:29">Matthew 12:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:22">Luke 11:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>.
	Translate as the <i>Greek,</i> "The <i>rules and authorities.</i>"
	</p>
<p><b>made a show of them</b>—at
	His ascension (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14- :">Hebrews 2:14- :</span>;
	confirming <i>English Version</i> of this verse). 
	</p>
<p><b>openly</b>—<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:4">John 7:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:54">John 11:54</span>, support <i>English
	Version</i> against ALFORD'S
	translation, "in openness of speech." 
	</p>
<p><b>in it</b>—namely, His
	cross, or crucifixion: so the Greek fathers translate. Many of the
	Latins, "In <i>Himself</i>" or "in Him." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:54- :">John 11:54- :</span> favors <i>English Version,</i> "reconcile . . . by <i>the
	cross,</i> having slain the enmity thereby." If "in Him,"
	that is, Christ, be read, still the Cross will be the place and means
	of God's triumph in Christ over the principalities (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>). Demons, like other
	angels, were in heaven up to Christ's ascension, and influenced earth
	from their heavenly abodes. As heaven was not yet opened to man
	before Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>), so it
	was not yet shut against demons (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:6">Job 1:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+2:1">Job 2:1</span>). But at the ascension
	Satan and his demons were "judged" and "cast out"
	by Christ's obedience unto death (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:11">John 16:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:14">Hebrews 2:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:5-10">Revelation 12:5-10</span>), and the Son
	of man was raised to the throne of God; thus His resurrection and
	ascension are a public solemn triumph over the principalities and
	powers of death. It is striking that the heathen oracles were
	silenced soon after Christ's ascension.</p>
