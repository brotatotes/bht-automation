	(not "the sabbaths") of the day of atonement and feast of
	tabernacles have come to an end with the Jewish services to which
	they belonged (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+23:32">Leviticus 23:32</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+23:37-39">Leviticus 23:37-39</span>).
	The weekly sabbath rests on a more permanent foundation, having been
	instituted in Paradise to commemorate the completion of creation in
	six days. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+23:38">Leviticus 23:38</span> expressly
	distinguished "the sabbath of the Lord" from the other
	sabbaths. A <i>positive</i> precept is <i>right because it is
	commanded,</i> and ceases to be obligatory when abrogated; a moral
	precept is <i>commanded</i> eternally, <i>because it is</i> eternally
	<i>right.</i> If we could keep a perpetual sabbath, as we shall
	hereafter, the positive precept of the sabbath, one in each week,
	would not be needed. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:9">Hebrews 4:9</span>,
	"rests," <i>Greek,</i> "keeping of sabbath" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:9- :">Hebrews 4:9- :</span>). But we cannot, since even Adam, in innocence, needed one
	amidst his earthly employments; therefore the sabbath is still needed
	and is therefore still linked with the other nine commandments, as
	obligatory in the spirit, though the letter of the law has been
	superseded by that higher spirit of love which is the essence of law
	and Gospel alike (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:9- :">Hebrews 4:9- :</span>).</p>
