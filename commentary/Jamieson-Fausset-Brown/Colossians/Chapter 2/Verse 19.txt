<p><b>19.</b> Translate, "Not holding
	<i>fast</i> the Head." He who does not hold Christ solely and
	supremely above all others, does not hold Him at all [BENGEL].
	The want of firm holding of Christ has set him loose to (pry into,
	and so) "tread haughtily on (pride himself on) things which he
	hath seen." Each must hold fast the Head for himself, not merely
	be attached to the other members, however high in the body [ALFORD].
