<p><b>2.</b> Translate, "That their
	hearts <i>may</i> be comforted." The "their," compared
	with "you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:4">Colossians 2:4</span>),
	proves that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span> the
	words, "have not seen my face in the flesh," is a <i>general</i>
	designation of those for whom Paul declares he has "conflict,"
	including the particular species, "you (Colossians) and them at
	Laodicea." For it is plain, the prayer "that <i>their</i>
	hearts may be comforted," must include in it the Colossians for
	whom he expressly says, "I have conflict." Thus it is an
	abbreviated mode of expression for, "That <i>your and their</i>
	hearts may be comforted." ALFORD
	translates, "confirmed," or allows "comforted" in
	its original radical sense <i>strengthened.</i> But the <i>Greek</i>
	supports <i>English Version:</i> the sense, too, is clear: <i>comforted</i>
	with the consolation of those whom Paul had not seen, and for whom,
	in consequence, he strove in prayerful conflict the more fervently;
	inasmuch as we are more anxious in behalf of absent, than present,
	friends [DAVENANT]. Their
	hearts would be comforted by "knowing what conflict he had for"
	them, and how much he is interested for their welfare; and also by
	being released from doubts on learning from the apostle, that the
	doctrine which they had heard from Epaphras was true and certain. In
	writing to churches which he had instructed face to face, he enters
	into particular details concerning them, as a father directing his
	children. But to those among whom he had not been in person, he
	treats of the more general truths of salvation.

<p><b>being</b>—Translate as
	<i>Greek</i> in oldest manuscripts, "They being knit together."
	</p>
<p><b>in love</b>—the bond and
