<p><b>23. have</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "are
	having"; implying the <i>permanent</i> characteristic which
	these ordinances are supposed to have. 
	</p>
<p><b>show of wisdom</b>—rather,
	"a <i>reputation</i> of wisdom" [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>will-worship</b>—arbitrarily
	invented worship: <i>would-be worship,</i> devised by <i>man's own
	will,</i> not God's. So jealous is God of human will-worship, that He
	struck Nadab and Abihu dead for burning strange incense (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). So Uzziah was stricken with leprosy for usurping the
	office of priest (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Compare the will-worship of Saul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) for which he was doomed to lose his throne. This
	"voluntary worship" is the counterpart to their "voluntary
	humility" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>): both
	specious in appearance, the former seeming in religion to do even
	<i>more</i> than God requires (as in the dogmas of the Roman and
	Greek churches); but really setting aside God's will for man's own;
	the latter seemingly self-abasing, but really proud of man's
	self-willed "humility" (<i>Greek,</i> "lowliness of
	mind"), while virtually rejecting the dignity of direct
	communion with Christ, the Head; by worshipping of angels. 
	</p>
<p><b>neglecting of the body</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"not sparing of the body." This asceticism seems to have
	rested on the Oriental theory that matter is the source of evil. This
	also looked plausible (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18- :">Colossians 2:18- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>not in any honour</b>—of
	the body. As "neglecting of the body" describes asceticism
	<i>positively;</i> so this clause, <i>negatively.</i> Not paying any
	of that "honor" which is due to the body as redeemed by
	such a price as the blood of Christ. We should not degrade, but have
	a just estimation of ourselves, not in ourselves, but in Christ
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21">1 Corinthians 3:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:15">1 Corinthians 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:23">1 Corinthians 7:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:23">1 Corinthians 12:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:24">1 Corinthians 12:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4">1 Thessalonians 4:4</span>). True self-denial
	regards the spirit, and not the forms of ascetical self-mortification
	in "meats which profit not those occupied therein" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:4- :">1 Thessalonians 4:4- :</span>), and is consistent with Christian self-respect, the "honor"
	which belongs to the believer as dedicated to the Lord. Compare
	"vainly," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>to the satisfying of the
	flesh</b>—This expresses the <i>real</i> tendency of their human
	ordinances of bodily asceticism, voluntary humility, and will-worship
	of angels. While seeming to <i>deny</i> self and the body, they
	really are <i>pampering</i> the flesh. Thus "satisfying of the
	<i>flesh</i>" answers to "puffed up by his <i>fleshly</i>
	mind" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>), so that
	"flesh" is used in its ethical sense, "the carnal
	nature" as opposed to the "spiritual"; not in the
	sense, "body." The <i>Greek</i> for "satisfying"
	implies <i>satiating to repletion,</i> or <i>to excess.</i> "A
	surfeit of the carnal sense is human tradition" [HILARY
	THE DEACON, in
	BENGEL]. Tradition puffs
	up; it clogs the heavenly perceptions. They put away true "honor"
	that they may "<i>satiate to the full</i> THE
	FLESH." Self-imposed ordinances gratify the flesh
	(namely, self-righteousness), though seeming to mortify it.</p>
