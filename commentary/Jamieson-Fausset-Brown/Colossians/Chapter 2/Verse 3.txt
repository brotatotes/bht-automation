	order, "In whom (not as ALFORD,
	'in which') mystery; Christ is Himself the 'mystery' (Colossians 2:2;
	1 Timothy 3:16), and to Christ the
	relative refers) are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
	hidden." The "all" here, answers to "all" in
	Colossians 2:2; as "treasures"
	answer to the "riches"; it is from the treasures
	that the riches (Colossians 2:2)
	are derived. "Are" is the predicate of the sentence; all
	the treasures ARE in Him;
	hidden is predicated of the state or manner in which they are
	in Him. Like a mine of unknown and inexhaustible wealth, the
	treasures of wisdom are all in Him hidden, but not in
	order to remain so; they only need to be explored for you to attain
	"unto the riches" in them (Colossians 2:2- :); but until you, Colossians, press after attaining the
	full knowledge (see on Colossians 2:2)
	of them, they remain "hidden." Compare the parable, Colossians 2:2- :, "treasure hid." This sense suits the scope of
	the apostle, and sets aside ALFORD'S
	objection that "the treasures are not hidden, but revealed."
	"Hidden" plainly answers to "mystery" (Colossians 2:2- :), which is designed by God, if we be faithful to our
	privileges, not to remain hidden, but to be revealed (compare
	1 Corinthians 2:7; 1 Corinthians 2:8).
	Still as the mine is unfathomable, there will, through eternity, be
	always fresh treasures in Him to be drawn forth from their hidden
	state. 
	wisdom—general, and as
	to experimental and practical truth; whence comes
	"understanding" (Colossians 2:2).
	knowledge—special
	and intellectual, in regard to doctrinal truth; whence
	comes "the full knowledge" (Colossians 2:2- :).
