	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>), and to Christ the
	relative refers) are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
	hidden." The "all" here, answers to "all" in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>; as "treasures"
	answer to the "riches"; it is from the <i>treasures</i>
	that <i>the riches</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>)
	are derived. "Are" is the predicate of the sentence; all
	the treasures ARE in Him;
	<i>hidden</i> is predicated of the state or manner in which they are
	in Him. Like a mine of unknown and inexhaustible wealth, the
	<i>treasures</i> of wisdom are all in Him <i>hidden,</i> but not in
	order to remain so; they only need to be explored for you to attain
	"unto the riches" in them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2- :">Colossians 2:2- :</span>); but until you, Colossians, press after attaining <i>the
	full knowledge</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>)
	of them, they remain "hidden." Compare the parable, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2- :">Colossians 2:2- :</span>, "treasure hid." This sense suits the scope of
	the apostle, and sets aside ALFORD'S
	objection that "the treasures are not hidden, but revealed."
	"Hidden" plainly answers to "mystery" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2- :">Colossians 2:2- :</span>), which is designed by God, if we be faithful to our
	privileges, not to remain <i>hidden,</i> but to be revealed (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>).
	Still as the mine is unfathomable, there will, through eternity, be
	always fresh treasures in Him to be drawn forth from their hidden
	state.
