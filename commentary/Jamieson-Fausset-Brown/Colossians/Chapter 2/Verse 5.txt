<p><b>steadfastness</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the firm</i> (or '<i>solid</i>') <i>foundation.</i>" As
	"order" expresses the outward aspect of the Church; so
	"steadfastness" expresses the inner basis on which their
	Church rested. The <i>Greek</i> literally implies not an abstract
	quality, but the <i>thing</i> in the concrete; thus their "faith"
	here is <i>the solid thing</i> which constituted the <i>basis</i> of
	their Church.</p>
