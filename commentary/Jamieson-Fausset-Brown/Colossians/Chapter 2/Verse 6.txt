6. "As therefore ye
	received (once for all; the aorist tense; from Epaphras) Jesus the
	Christ as your Lord (compare 1 Corinthians 12:3;
	2 Corinthians 4:5; Philippians 3:8),
	so walk in Him." He says not merely, "Ye received" the
	doctrine of Christ, but "Jesus" Himself; this is the
	essence of faith (John 14:21;
	John 14:23; Galatians 1:16).
	Ye have received once for all the Spirit of life in Christ;
	carry into practice that life in your walk (Galatians 1:16- :). This is the main scope of the Epistle.
