<p><b>6.</b> "As therefore ye
	received (once for all; the aorist tense; from Epaphras) Jesus <i>the</i>
	Christ <i>as your</i> Lord (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:5">2 Corinthians 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:8">Philippians 3:8</span>),
	so walk in Him." He says not merely, "Ye received" the
	doctrine of Christ, but "Jesus" Himself; this is the
	essence of faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:21">John 14:21</span>;

	Ye have received once for all the Spirit of <i>life</i> in Christ;
	carry into practice that life in your <i>walk</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16- :">Galatians 1:16- :</span>). This is the main scope of the Epistle.</p>
