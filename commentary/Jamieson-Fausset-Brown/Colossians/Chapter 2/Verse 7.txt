<p><b>7. Rooted</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>built up</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>being</i> builded up." As "rooted" implies
	their <i>vitality;</i> so "builded up," massive <i>solidity.</i>
	As in the Song of Solomon, when one image is not sufficient to
	express the varied aspects of divine truth, another is employed to
	supply the idea required. Thus "walking," a third image
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:6">Colossians 2:6</span>), expresses the thought
	which "rooted" and "built," though each
	suggesting a thought peculiar to itself, could not express, namely,
	onward <i>motion.</i> "Rooted" is in the <i>past</i> tense,
	implying their first <i>conversion</i> and vital grafting "in
	Him." "Built up" is <i>present</i> (in the <i>Greek</i>),
	implying their progressive <i>increase</i> in religion by union with
	Him. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span> refers to the
	<i>Church;</i> but the passage here to their <i>individual</i>
	progress in edification (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20- :">Ephesians 2:20- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>stablished</b>—confirmed. 
	</p>
<p><b>as</b>—"even as."
	</p>
<p><b>abounding therein with
	thanksgiving</b>—advancing to fuller maturity (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20- :">Ephesians 2:20- :</span>) in the faith, "with thanksgiving" to God as the
	gracious Author of this whole blessing.</p>
