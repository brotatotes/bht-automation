1. If . . . then—The
	connection with Colossians 2:18; Colossians 2:23,
	is, he had condemned the "fleshly mind" and the "satiating
	to the full the flesh"; in contrast to this he now says, "If
	then ye have been once for all raised up (Greek, aorist tense)
	together with Christ" (namely, at your conversion and baptism,
	Romans 6:4). 
	seek those things . . .
	above— (Matthew 6:33; Philippians 3:20).
	sitteth—rather, as
	Greek, "Where Christ is, sitting on the right of God"
	(Ephesians 1:20). The Head being
	quickened, the members are also quickened with Him. Where the Head
	is, there the members must be. The contrast is between the believer's
	former state, alive to the world but dead to God, and his present
	state, dead to the world but alive to God; and between the earthly
	abode of the unbeliever and the heavenly abode of the believer
	(1 Corinthians 15:47; 1 Corinthians 15:48).
	We are already seated there in Him as our Head; and hereafter
	shall be seated by Him, as the Bestower of our bliss. As
	Elisha (2 Kings 2:2) said to Elijah
	when about to ascend, "As the Lord liveth . . . I will not leave
	thee"; so we must follow the ascended Saviour with the wings of
	our meditations and the chariots of our affections. We should trample
	upon and subdue our lusts that our conversation may correspond to our
	Saviour's condition; that where the eyes of apostles were forced to
	leave Him, thither our thoughts may follow Him (Matthew 6:21;
	John 12:32) [PEARSON].
	Of ourselves we can no more ascend than a bar of iron lift itself up'
	from the earth. But the love of Christ is a powerful magnet to draw
	us up (Ephesians 2:5; Ephesians 2:6).
	The design of the Gospel is not merely to give rules, but mainly to
	supply motives to holiness.
