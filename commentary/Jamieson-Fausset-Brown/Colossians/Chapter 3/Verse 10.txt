<p><b>10. the new man</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Here (<i>neon</i>) the <i>Greek,</i> means "the
	<i>recently</i>-put-on nature"; that lately received at
	regeneration (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>which is renewed</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"which is being renewed" (<i>anakainottmenou</i>); namely,
	its development into a perfectly renewed nature is continually
	progressing to completion. 
	</p>
<p><b>in knowledge</b>—rather as
	the <i>Greek,</i> "unto perfect knowledge" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:9">Colossians 1:9</span>). Perfect
	knowledge of God excludes all sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:9- :">Colossians 1:9- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>after the image of him that
	created him</b>—namely, of God that created the <i>new man</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:10">Ephesians 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24">Ephesians 4:24</span>).
	The new creation is analogous to the first creation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24- :">Ephesians 4:24- :</span>). As man was then made in the image of God naturally, so now
	spiritually. But the image of God formed in us by the Spirit of God,
	is as much more glorious than that borne by Adam, as the Second Man,
	the Lord from heaven, is more glorious than the first man. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24- :">Ephesians 4:24- :</span>, "Let us make man in our <i>image,</i> after our
	<i>likeness.</i>" The "image" is claimed for man, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24- :">Ephesians 4:24- :</span>; the "likeness," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24- :">Ephesians 4:24- :</span>. ORIGEN [<i>On
	First Principles,</i> 3:6] taught, the <i>image</i> was something in
	which all were created, and which continued to man after the fall (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24- :">Ephesians 4:24- :</span>). The <i>likeness</i> was something <i>towards</i> which man
	was created, that he might strive after it and attain it. TRENCH
	thinks God in the double statement (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:24- :">Ephesians 4:24- :</span>), contemplates both man's first creation and his being
	"<i>renewed</i> in knowledge after the image of Him that created
	Him."</p>
