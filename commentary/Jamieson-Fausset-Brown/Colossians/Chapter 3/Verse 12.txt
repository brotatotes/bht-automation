<p><b>12. the elect of God</b>—There is
	no "the" in the <i>Greek,</i> "God's elect"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3">Romans 8:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:4">1 Thessalonians 1:4</span>).
	The order of the words "elect, holy, beloved," answers to
	the order of the things. <i>Election</i> from eternity precedes
	<i>sanctification</i> in time; the <i>sanctified,</i> feeling God's
	<i>love,</i> imitate it [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>bowels of mercies</b>—Some
	of the oldest manuscripts read singular, "mercy." <i>Bowels</i>
	express the yearning compassion, which has its seat in the heart, and
	which we feel to act on our inward parts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+43:30">Genesis 43:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:20">Jeremiah 31:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:78">Luke 1:78</span>,
	<i>Margin</i>). 
	</p>
<p><b>humbleness of mind</b>—True
	"lowliness of mind"; not the mock "humility" of
	the false teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:23">Colossians 2:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:32">Ephesians 4:32</span>).</p>
