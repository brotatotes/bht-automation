12. the elect of God—There is
	no "the" in the Greek, "God's elect"
	(compare Romans 8:3; 1 Thessalonians 1:4).
	The order of the words "elect, holy, beloved," answers to
	the order of the things. Election from eternity precedes
	sanctification in time; the sanctified, feeling God's
	love, imitate it [BENGEL].
	bowels of mercies—Some
	of the oldest manuscripts read singular, "mercy." Bowels
	express the yearning compassion, which has its seat in the heart, and
	which we feel to act on our inward parts (Genesis 43:30;
	Jeremiah 31:20; Luke 1:78,
	Margin). 
	humbleness of mind—True
	"lowliness of mind"; not the mock "humility" of
	the false teachers (Colossians 2:23;
	Ephesians 4:2; Ephesians 4:32).
