<p><b>14. above</b>—rather "over,"
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16">Ephesians 6:16</span>. Charity, which
	is the crowning grace, covering the multitude of others' sins (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16- :">Ephesians 6:16- :</span>), must <i>overlie</i> all the other graces enumerated. 
	</p>
<p><b>which is</b>—that is, "<i>for
	it is</i>"; literally, "<i>which thing is.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>bond of perfectness</b>—an
	upper garment which <i>completes</i> and keeps together the rest,
	which, without it, would be loose and disconnected. Seeming graces,
	where love is wanting, are mere hypocrisy. Justification by faith is
	assumed as already having taken place in those whom Paul addresses,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>, "elect of God,
	holy . . . beloved," and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12- :">Colossians 3:12- :</span>; so that there is no plea here for Rome's view of
	justification by works. Love and its works "<i>perfect,</i>"
	that is, manifest the full maturity of faith developed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:44">Matthew 5:44</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:48">Matthew 5:48</span>). Love . . . be ye
	<i>perfect,</i> c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:21">James 2:21</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:22">James 2:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:5">1 John 2:5</span>).
	"If we love one another, God's love is <i>perfected</i> in us"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:8">Romans 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:1-13">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:12">1 John 4:12</span>).
	As to "bond," compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:12- :">1 John 4:12- :</span>, "<i>knit together</i> in love" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:12- :">1 John 4:12- :</span>), "keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."</p>
