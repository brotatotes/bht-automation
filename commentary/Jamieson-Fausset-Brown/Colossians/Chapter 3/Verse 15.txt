<p><b>15. peace of God</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts and versions read, "The peace of CHRIST"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>). "The
	peace of GOD."
	Therefore Christ is God. Peace was His legacy to His disciples before
	He left them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>), "MY
	peace I give unto you." Peace is peculiarly His to give. Peace
	follows <i>love</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:14">Colossians 3:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>rule</b>—literally, "sit
	as umpire"; the same <i>Greek</i> verb simple, as appears
	compounded (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>). The
	false teacher, as a self-constituted <i>umpire,</i> defrauds you of
	your prize; but if the peace of Christ be your umpire ruling in your
	hearts, your reward is sure. "Let the peace of Christ act as
	umpire when anger, envy, and such passions arise; and restrain them."
	Let not those passions give the award, so that you should be swayed
	by them, but let Christ's peace be the decider of everything. 
	</p>
<p><b>in your hearts</b>—Many
	wear a peaceful countenance and speak peace with the mouth, while war
	is <i>in their hearts</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+28:3">Psalms 28:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:21">Psalms 55:21</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>to the which</b>—that is,
	with a view to which state of Christian peace (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:21- :">Psalms 55:21- :</span>); <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:15">1 Corinthians 7:15</span>, "God
	hath called us to peace." 
	</p>
<p><b>ye are called</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"ye were also called." The "also" implies that
	besides Paul's exhortation, they have <i>also</i> as a motive to
	"peace," their having been once for all called. 
	</p>
<p><b>in one body</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:15- :">1 Corinthians 7:15- :</span>). The unity of the body is a strong argument for "peace"
	among the members. 
	</p>
<p><b>be ye thankful</b>—for your
	"calling." Not to have "peace ruling in your hearts"
	would be inconsistent with the "calling in one body," and
	would be practical unthankfulness to God who called us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:19">Ephesians 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:20">Ephesians 5:20</span>).</p>
