24. the reward of the
	inheritance—"Knowing that it is from the Lord (the
	ultimate source of reward), ye shall receive the compensation (or
	recompense, which will make ample amends for your having no earthly
	possession as slaves now) consisting of the inheritance" (a term
	excluding the notion of meriting it by works: it is all of
	grace, Romans 4:14; Galatians 3:18).
	for ye serve—The oldest
	manuscripts omit "for," then translate as Vulgate,
	"Serve ye the Lord Christ;" compare Galatians 3:18- :, "To the Lord and not unto men" (1 Corinthians 7:22;
	1 Corinthians 7:23).
