<p><b>3.</b> The <i>Greek</i> aorist tense
	implies, "For ye have died once for all" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4-7">Romans 6:4-7</span>). It is not said,
	Ye must die practically to the world in order to become dead with
	Christ; but the latter is assumed as <i>once for all</i> having taken
	place in the regeneration; what believers are told is, Develop this
	spiritual life in practice. "No one longs for eternal,
	incorruptible, and immortal life, unless he be wearied of this
	temporal, corruptible, and mortal life" [AUGUSTINE].

<p><b>and your life . . . hid</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+83:3">Psalms 83:3</span>); like a seed buried
	in the earth; compare "planted," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+83:3- :">Psalms 83:3- :</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:31">Matthew 13:31</span>;

	leaven . . . <i>hid.</i>" As the glory of Christ now is hid from
	the world, so also the glory of believers' inner life, proceeding
	from communion with Him, is still hidden with Christ in God; but (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:33- :">Matthew 13:33- :</span>) when Christ, the Source of this life, shall manifest Himself
	in glory, then shall their hidden glory be manifest, and correspond
	in appearance to its original [NEANDER].
	The Christian's secret communion with God will now at times make
	itself seen without his intending it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:14">Matthew 5:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:16">Matthew 5:16</span>); but his full
	manifestation is at Christ's manifestation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:43">Matthew 13:43</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19-23">Romans 8:19-23</span>). "It doth
	not yet appear (<i>Greek,</i> 'is not yet <i>manifested</i>') what we

	As yet Christians do not always recognize the "life" of one
	another, so <i>hidden</i> is it, and even at times doubt as to their
	own life, so weak is it, and so harassed with temptations (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:1-19">Psalms 51:1-19</span>;

<p><b>in God</b>—to whom Christ
	has ascended. Our "life" is "laid up for" us <i>in
	God</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>), and is
	secured by the decree of Him who is invisible to the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5- :">Colossians 1:5- :</span>).</p>
