<p><b>then</b>â€”and not till then.
	Those err who think to find a perfect Church before then. The true
	Church is now militant. Rome errs in trying to set up a Church now
	regnant and triumphant. The true Church shall be visible as a perfect
	and reigning Church, when Christ shall be visibly manifested as her
	reigning Head. Rome having ceased to look for Him in patient faith,
	has set up a visible mockhead, a false anticipation of the millennial
	kingdom. The Papacy took to itself by robbery that glory which is an
	object of hope, and can only be reached by bearing the cross now.
	When the Church became a harlot, she ceased to be a bride who goes to
	meet her Bridegroom. Hence the millennial kingdom ceased to be looked
	for [AUBERLEN].</p>
