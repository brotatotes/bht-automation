5. Mortify—Greek, "make
	a corpse of"; "make dead"; "put to death." 
	therefore—(See on  :-). Follow out to its necessary consequence the fact of your
	having once for all died with Christ spiritually at your
	regeneration, by daily "deadening your members," of which
	united "the body of the sins of the flesh" consists
	(compare Colossians 2:11). "The
	members" to be mortified are the fleshly instruments of lust, in
	so far as the members of the body are abused to such purposes.
	Habitually repress and do violence to corrupt desires of which the
	members are the instruments (compare Romans 6:19;
	Romans 8:13; Galatians 5:24;
	Galatians 5:25). 
	upon the earth—where
	they find their support [BENGEL]
	(Compare Colossians 3:2, "things
	on earth"). See Ephesians 5:3;
	Ephesians 5:4. 
	inordinate affection—"lustful
	passion." 
	evil concupiscence—more
	general than the last [ALFORD],
	the disorder of the external senses; "lustful passion,"
	lust within [BENGEL].
	covetousness—marked off
	by the Greek article as forming a whole genus by itself,
	distinct from the genus containing the various species just
	enumerated. It implies a self-idolizing, grasping spirit; far worse
	than another Greek term translated "the love of money"
	(1 Timothy 6:10). 
	which is—that is,
	inasmuch as it is "idolatry." Compare Note, see on
	1 Timothy 6:10- :, on its connection with
	sins of impurity. Self and mammon are deified in the
	heart instead of God (Matthew 6:24;
	see on Matthew 6:24- :).
