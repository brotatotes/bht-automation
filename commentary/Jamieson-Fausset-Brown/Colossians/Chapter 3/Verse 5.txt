<p><b>5. Mortify</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "make
	a corpse of"; "make dead"; "put to death." 
	</p>
<p><b>therefore</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Follow out to its necessary consequence the fact of your
	<i>having once for all</i> died with Christ spiritually at your
	regeneration, by daily "deadening your members," of which
	united "the body of the sins of the flesh" consists
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span>). "The
	members" to be mortified are the fleshly instruments of lust, in
	so far as the members of the body are abused to such purposes.
	Habitually repress and do violence to corrupt desires of which the
	members are the instruments (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:19">Romans 6:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:13">Romans 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:24">Galatians 5:24</span>;

<p><b>upon the earth</b>—where
	they find their support [BENGEL]
	(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:2">Colossians 3:2</span>, "things
	on earth"). See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>;

	</p>
<p><b>inordinate affection</b>—"lustful
	passion." 
	</p>
<p><b>evil concupiscence</b>—more
	general than the last [ALFORD],
	the disorder of the <i>external</i> senses; "lustful passion,"
	<i>lust within</i> [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>covetousness</b>—marked off
	by the <i>Greek</i> article as forming a whole genus by itself,
	distinct from the genus containing the various species just
	enumerated. It implies a self-idolizing, grasping spirit; far worse
	than another <i>Greek</i> term translated "the love of money"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10">1 Timothy 6:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>which is</b>—that is,
	inasmuch as it is "idolatry." Compare <i>Note,</i> see on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:10- :">1 Timothy 6:10- :</span>, on its connection with
	sins of impurity. <i>Self</i> and <i>mammon</i> are deified in the
	heart instead of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:24">Matthew 6:24</span>;
