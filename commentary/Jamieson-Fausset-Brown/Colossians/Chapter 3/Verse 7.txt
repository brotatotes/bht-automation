<p><b>walked . . . when ye lived in
	them</b>—These sins were the very element in which ye "<i>lived</i>"
	(before ye became once for all dead with Christ to them); no wonder,
	then, that ye "<i>walked</i>" in them. Compare on the
	opposite side, "<i>living</i> in the Spirit," having as its
	legitimate consequence, "<i>walking</i> in the Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The "living" comes first in both cases, the
	<i>walking</i> follows.</p>
