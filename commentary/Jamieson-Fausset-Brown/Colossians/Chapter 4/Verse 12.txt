<p><b>12. Christ</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts add "Jesus." 
	</p>
<p><b>labouring fervently</b>—As
	the <i>Greek,</i> is the same, translate, "striving earnestly"
	(see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29">Colossians 1:29</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:29- :">Colossians 1:29- :</span>), literally, "<i>striving as in the agony of a contest.</i>"
	</p>
<p><b>in prayers</b>—Translate as
	<i>Greek,</i> "in <i>his</i> prayers." 
	</p>
<p><b>complete</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "fully assured." It is translated, "fully
	persuaded," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:21">Romans 4:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:5">Romans 14:5</span>. In the expression
	"perfect," he refers to what he has already said, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:28">Colossians 1:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:2">Colossians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:14">Colossians 3:14</span>.
	"Perfect" implies the attainment of the <i>full maturity</i>
	of a Christian. BENGEL
	joins "in all the will of God" with "stand."</p>
