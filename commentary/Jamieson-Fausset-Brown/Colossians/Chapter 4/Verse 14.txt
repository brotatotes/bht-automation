<p><b>14.</b> It is conjectured that Luke
	"the beloved physician" (the same as the Evangelist), may
	have first become connected with Paul in professionally attending on
	him in the sickness under which he labored in Phrygia and Galatia (in
	which latter place he was detained by sickness), in the early part of
	that journey wherein Luke first is found in his company (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Thus the allusion to his medical profession is appropriate
	in writing to men of Phrygia. Luke ministered to Paul in his last
	imprisonment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:11">2 Timothy 4:11</span>).

	his "fellow laborers" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:11- :">2 Timothy 4:11- :</span>), but afterwards a deserter from him through love of this
	world (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:10">2 Timothy 4:10</span>). He alone has
	here no honorable or descriptive epithet attached to his name.
	Perhaps, already, his real character was betraying itself.</p>
