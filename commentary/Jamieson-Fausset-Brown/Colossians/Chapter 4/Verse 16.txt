16. the epistle from
	Laodiceaâ€”namely, the Epistle which I wrote to the Laodiceans,
	and which you will get from them on applying to them. Not the
	Epistle to the Ephesians. See  :-
	to Ephesians and  :- to
	Colossians. The Epistles from the apostles were publicly read in the
	church assemblies. IGNATIUS
	[Epistle to the Ephesians, 12], POLYCARP
	[Epistle to the Philippians, 3.11,12], CLEMENT
	[Epistle to the Corinthians, 1. 47], 1 Thessalonians 5:27;
	Revelation 1:3, "Blessed is he
	that readeth, and they that hear." Thus, they and
	the Gospels were put on a level with the Old Testament, which was
	similarly read (Deuteronomy 31:11). The
	Holy Spirit inspired Paul to write, besides those extant, other
	Epistles which He saw necessary for that day, and for
	particular churches; and which were not so for the Church of all ages
	and places. It is possible that as the Epistle to the Colossians was
	to be read for the edification of other churches besides that of
	Colosse; so the Epistle to the Ephesians was to be read in various
	churches besides Ephesus, and that Laodicea was the last of such
	churches before Colosse, whence he might designate the Epistle to the
	Ephesians here as "the Epistle from Laodicea." But
	it is equally possible that the Epistle meant was one to the
	Laodiceans themselves.
