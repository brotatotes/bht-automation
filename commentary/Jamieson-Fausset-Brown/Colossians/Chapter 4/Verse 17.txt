17. say to Archippus—The
	Colossians (not merely the clergy, but the laymen) are directed,
	"Speak ye to Archippus." This proves that Scripture
	belongs to the laity as well as the clergy; and that laymen may
	profitably admonish the clergy in particular cases when they do so in
	meekness. BENGEL suggests
	that Archippus was perhaps prevented from going to the Church
	assembly by weak health or age. The word, "fulfil," accords
	with his ministry being near its close ( :-; compare Philemon 1:2).
	However, "fulfil" may mean, as in Philemon 1:2- :, "make full proof of thy ministry." "Give
	all diligence to follow it out fully"; a monition perhaps needed
	by Archippus. 
	in the Lord—The element
	in which every work of the Christian, and especially the Christian
	minister, is to be done (Colossians 4:7;
	1 Corinthians 7:39; Philippians 4:2).
