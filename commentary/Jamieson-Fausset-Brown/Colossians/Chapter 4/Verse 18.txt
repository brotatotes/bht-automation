<p><b>18.</b> Paul's autograph salutation
	(so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>),
	attesting that the preceding letter, though written by an amanuensis,
	is from himself.

<p><b>Remember my bonds</b>—Already
	in this chapter he had mentioned his "bonds" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17- :">2 Thessalonians 3:17- :</span>), and again <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10">Colossians 4:10</span>,
	an incentive why they should love and pray (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10- :">Colossians 4:10- :</span>) for him; and still more, that they should, in reverential
	obedience to his monitions in this Epistle, shrink from the false
	teaching herein stigmatized, remembering what a conflict (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:10- :">Colossians 4:10- :</span>) he had in their behalf amidst his <i>bonds.</i> "When
	we read of his chains, we should not forget that they moved over the
	paper as he wrote; his [right] hand was chained to the [left hand of
	the] soldier who kept him" [ALFORD].

<p><b>Grace be with you</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"THE grace"
	which every Christian enjoys in some degree, and which flows from God
	in Christ by the Holy Ghost (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:15">Titus 3:15</span>;
