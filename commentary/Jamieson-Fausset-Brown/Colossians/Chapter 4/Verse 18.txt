18. Paul's autograph salutation
	(so 1 Corinthians 16:21; 2 Thessalonians 3:17),
	attesting that the preceding letter, though written by an amanuensis,
	is from himself. 
	Remember my bonds—Already
	in this chapter he had mentioned his "bonds" (2 Thessalonians 3:17- :), and again Colossians 4:10,
	an incentive why they should love and pray (Colossians 4:10- :) for him; and still more, that they should, in reverential
	obedience to his monitions in this Epistle, shrink from the false
	teaching herein stigmatized, remembering what a conflict (Colossians 4:10- :) he had in their behalf amidst his bonds. "When
	we read of his chains, we should not forget that they moved over the
	paper as he wrote; his [right] hand was chained to the [left hand of
	the] soldier who kept him" [ALFORD].
	Grace be with you—Greek,
	"THE grace"
	which every Christian enjoys in some degree, and which flows from God
	in Christ by the Holy Ghost (Titus 3:15;
	Hebrews 13:25)
