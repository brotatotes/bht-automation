3. for us—myself and Timothy
	(Colossians 1:1). 
	a door of
	utterance—Translate, "a door for the word." Not as in
	Ephesians 6:19, where power of
	"utterance" is his petition. Here it is an opportunity for
	preaching the word, which would be best afforded by his
	release from prison (1 Corinthians 16:9;
	2 Corinthians 2:12; Philemon 1:22;
	Revelation 3:8). 
	to speak—so that we may
	speak. 
	the mystery of Christ—
	(Colossians 1:27). 
	for which . . . also—on
	account of which I am (not only "an ambassador," Colossians 1:27- :, but) ALSO in
	bonds.
