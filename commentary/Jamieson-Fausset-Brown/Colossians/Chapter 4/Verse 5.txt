	love, will make allowances for an indiscreet act or word of a
	brother; the world will make none. Therefore be the more on your
	guard in your intercourse with the latter, lest you be a
	stumbling-block to their conversion.

<p><b>redeeming the time</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> expresses, buying up for yourselves, and <i>buying off</i>
	from worldly vanities the <i>opportunity,</i> whenever it is afforded
	you, of good to yourselves and others. "<i>Forestall the
	opportunity,</i> that is, to buy up an article out of the market, so
	as to make the largest profit from it" [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON].</p>
