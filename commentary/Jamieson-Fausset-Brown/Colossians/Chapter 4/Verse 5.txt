	in wisdom—practical
	Christian prudence. 
	them . . . without—Those
	not in the Christian brotherhood (1 Corinthians 5:12;
	1 Thessalonians 4:12). The brethren, through
	love, will make allowances for an indiscreet act or word of a
	brother; the world will make none. Therefore be the more on your
	guard in your intercourse with the latter, lest you be a
	stumbling-block to their conversion. 
	redeeming the time—The
	Greek expresses, buying up for yourselves, and buying off
	from worldly vanities the opportunity, whenever it is afforded
	you, of good to yourselves and others. "Forestall the
	opportunity, that is, to buy up an article out of the market, so
	as to make the largest profit from it" [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON].
