6. with grace—Greek,
	"IN grace" as
	its element (Colossians 3:16; Ephesians 4:29).
	Contrast the case of those "of the world" who "therefore
	speak of the world" (Ephesians 4:29- :). Even the smallest leaf of the believer should be full of
	the sap of the Holy Spirit (Jeremiah 17:7;
	Jeremiah 17:8). His conversation
	should be cheerful without levity, serious without gloom. Compare
	Luke 4:22; John 7:46,
	as to Jesus' speech. 
	seasoned with salt—that
	is, the savor of fresh and lively spiritual wisdom and
	earnestness, excluding all "corrupt communication," and
	also tasteless insipidity (Matthew 5:13;
	Mark 9:50; Ephesians 4:29).
	Compare all the sacrifices seasoned with salt (Ephesians 4:29- :). Not far from Colosse, in Phrygia, there was a salt lake,
	which gives to the image here the more appropriateness. 
	how ye ought to answer every
	man— (1 Peter 3:15).
