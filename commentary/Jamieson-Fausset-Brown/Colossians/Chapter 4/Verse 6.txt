	"IN grace" as

	Contrast the case of those "of the world" who "therefore
	<i>speak of the world</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:29- :">Ephesians 4:29- :</span>). Even the smallest leaf of the believer should be full of
	the sap of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:7">Jeremiah 17:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:8">Jeremiah 17:8</span>). His conversation
	should be cheerful without levity, serious without gloom. Compare

<p><b>seasoned with salt</b>—that
	is, the <i>savor</i> of fresh and lively spiritual wisdom and
	earnestness, excluding all "corrupt communication," and
	also tasteless <i>insipidity</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:13">Matthew 5:13</span>;

	Compare all the sacrifices <i>seasoned with salt</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:29- :">Ephesians 4:29- :</span>). Not far from Colosse, in Phrygia, there was a salt lake,
	which gives to the image here the more appropriateness.
