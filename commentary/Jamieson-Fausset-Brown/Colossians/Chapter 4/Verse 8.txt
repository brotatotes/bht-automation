<p><b>8. for the same purpose</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"for this very purpose." 
	</p>
<p><b>that he might know your
	estate</b>—Translate, "that he may know your state":
	answering to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7">Colossians 4:7</span>. So one
	very old manuscript and <i>Vulgate</i> read. But the oldest
	manuscripts and the <i>old Latin versions,</i> "that YE
	may know OUR state."
	However, the latter reading seems likely to have crept in from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:7- :">Colossians 4:7- :</span>. Paul was the more anxious to know the state of the
	Colossians, on account of the seductions to which they were exposed
	from false teachers; owing to which he had "great conflict for"
	them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:1">Colossians 2:1</span>).

	hearts</b>—distressed as ye are by my imprisonment, as well as by
	your own trials.</p>
