<p><b>9. Onesimus</b>—the slave
	mentioned in the Epistle to Philemon (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:10">Philemon 1:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:16">Philemon 1:16</span>), "a brother
	beloved." 
	</p>
<p><b>a faithful . . .
	brother</b>—rather, "the faithful brother," he being
	known to the Colossians as the slave of Philemon, their fellow
	townsman and fellow Christian.

<p><b>one of you</b>—belonging to
	your city. 
	</p>
<p><b>They shall make known unto
	you all things</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "all the things here."
	This substantial repetition of "all my state shall Tychicus
	declare unto you," strongly favors the reading of <i>English
	Version</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:8">Colossians 4:8</span>, "that
	<i>he</i> might (may) know your state," as it is unlikely the
	same thing should be stated <i>thrice.</i></p>
