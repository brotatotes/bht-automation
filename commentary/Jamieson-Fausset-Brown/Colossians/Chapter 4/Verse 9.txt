9. Onesimus—the slave
	mentioned in the Epistle to Philemon (Philemon 1:10;
	Philemon 1:16), "a brother
	beloved." 
	a faithful . . .
	brother—rather, "the faithful brother," he being
	known to the Colossians as the slave of Philemon, their fellow
	townsman and fellow Christian. 
	one of you—belonging to
	your city. 
	They shall make known unto
	you all things—Greek, "all the things here."
	This substantial repetition of "all my state shall Tychicus
	declare unto you," strongly favors the reading of English
	Version in Colossians 4:8, "that
	he might (may) know your state," as it is unlikely the
	same thing should be stated thrice.
