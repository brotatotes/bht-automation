1. by—rather, "through
	the will of God": called to the apostleship through that same
	"will" which originated the Church (Ephesians 1:5;
	Ephesians 1:9; Ephesians 1:11;

	to the saints . . . and to
	the faithful—The same persons are referred to by both
	designations, as the Greek proves: "to those who are
	saints, and faithful in Christ Jesus." The sanctification
	by God is here put before man's faith. The twofold aspect of
	salvation is thus presented, God's grace in the first instance
	sanctifying us, (that is, setting us apart in His eternal
	purposes as holy unto Himself); and our faith, by God's gift, laying
	hold of salvation (2 Thessalonians 2:13;
	1 Peter 1:2).
