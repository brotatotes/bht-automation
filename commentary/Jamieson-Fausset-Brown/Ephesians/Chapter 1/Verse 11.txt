<p><b>11. In whom</b>—by virtue of union
	to whom. 
	</p>
<p><b>obtained an
	inheritance</b>—literally, "We were made to have an
	inheritance" [WAHL].
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>, "<i>His</i>
	inheritance in the saints": as <i>His</i> inheritance is there
	said to be <i>in them,</i> so <i>theirs</i> is here said to be <i>in
	Him</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>). However,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12">Ephesians 1:12</span>, "That we should
	BE TO . . . His glory"
	(not "that we should <i>have</i>"), favors the translation
	of BENGEL, ELLICOTT,
	and others, "We were <i>made</i> an inheritance." So the
	literal Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+4:20">Deuteronomy 4:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+9:29">Deuteronomy 9:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:9">Deuteronomy 32:9</span>). "Also" does
	not mean "we also," nor as <i>English Version,</i> "in
	whom also"; but, besides His having "made known to us His
	will," we were also "made His inheritance," or "we
	have also obtained an inheritance." 
	</p>
<p><b>predestinated</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:9- :">Deuteronomy 32:9- :</span>). The foreordination of Israel, as the elect nation, answers
	to that of the spiritual Israelites, believers, to an eternal
	inheritance, which is the thing meant here. The "we" here
	and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12">Ephesians 1:12</span>, means <i>Jewish</i>
	believers (whence the reference to the election of Israel nationally
	arises), as contrasted with "you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12- :">Ephesians 1:12- :</span>) <i>Gentile</i> believers. 
	</p>
<p><b>purpose</b>—repeated from
	"purposed" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span>). The Church existed in
	the mind of God eternally, before it existed in creation. 
	</p>
<p><b>counsel of his . . . will</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>), "the good
	pleasure of His will." Not arbitrary caprice, but infinite
	wisdom ("counsel") joined with sovereign will. Compare his
	address to the same Ephesians in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5- :">Ephesians 1:5- :</span>, "All the counsel of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5- :">Ephesians 1:5- :</span>). Alike in the natural and spiritual creations, God is not
	an agent constrained by necessity. "Wheresoever counsel is,
	there is election, or else it is vain; where a will, there must be
	freedom, or else it is weak" [PEARSON].</p>
