11. In whom—by virtue of union
	to whom. 
	obtained an
	inheritance—literally, "We were made to have an
	inheritance" [WAHL].
	Compare Ephesians 1:18, "His
	inheritance in the saints": as His inheritance is there
	said to be in them, so theirs is here said to be in
	Him (Acts 26:18). However,
	Ephesians 1:12, "That we should
	BE TO . . . His glory"
	(not "that we should have"), favors the translation
	of BENGEL, ELLICOTT,
	and others, "We were made an inheritance." So the
	literal Israel (Deuteronomy 4:20; Deuteronomy 9:29;
	Deuteronomy 32:9). "Also" does
	not mean "we also," nor as English Version, "in
	whom also"; but, besides His having "made known to us His
	will," we were also "made His inheritance," or "we
	have also obtained an inheritance." 
	predestinated— (Deuteronomy 32:9- :). The foreordination of Israel, as the elect nation, answers
	to that of the spiritual Israelites, believers, to an eternal
	inheritance, which is the thing meant here. The "we" here
	and in Ephesians 1:12, means Jewish
	believers (whence the reference to the election of Israel nationally
	arises), as contrasted with "you" (Ephesians 1:12- :) Gentile believers. 
	purpose—repeated from
	"purposed" (Ephesians 1:9;
	Ephesians 3:11). The Church existed in
	the mind of God eternally, before it existed in creation. 
	counsel of his . . . will—
	(Ephesians 1:5), "the good
	pleasure of His will." Not arbitrary caprice, but infinite
	wisdom ("counsel") joined with sovereign will. Compare his
	address to the same Ephesians in Ephesians 1:5- :, "All the counsel of God" (Ephesians 1:5- :). Alike in the natural and spiritual creations, God is not
	an agent constrained by necessity. "Wheresoever counsel is,
	there is election, or else it is vain; where a will, there must be
	freedom, or else it is weak" [PEARSON].
