	Gentiles. Supply as <i>English Version,</i> "trusted," from
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:12">Ephesians 1:12</span>; or "are."
	The priority of us Jews does not exclude you Gentiles from sharing in
	Christ (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:46">Acts 13:46</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the word of truth</b>—the
	instrument of sanctification, and of the new birth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17">John 17:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:15">2 Timothy 2:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>).
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>, where also, as
	here, it is connected with "hope." Also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5- :">Colossians 1:5- :</span>.

<p><b>sealed</b>—as God's
	confirmed children, by the Holy Spirit as the seal (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:1-6">Acts 19:1-6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24">1 John 3:24</span>; see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:24- :">1 John 3:24- :</span>). A seal impressed on a document gives undoubted validity to
	the contract in it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:33">John 3:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:27">John 6:27</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:27- :">John 6:27- :</span>). So the sense of "the love of God shed abroad in the
	heart by the Holy Ghost" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:27- :">John 6:27- :</span>), and the sense of adoption given through the Spirit at
	regeneration (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:16">Romans 8:16</span>),
	assure believers of God's good will to them. The Spirit, like a seal,
	impresses on the soul at regeneration the image of our Father. The
	"sealing" by the Holy Spirit is spoken of as <i>past</i>
	once for all. The witnessing to our hearts that we are the children
	of God, and heirs (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>),
	is the Spirit's <i>present</i> testimony, the "earnest of the
	(coming) inheritance" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11- :">Ephesians 1:11- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that Holy Spirit of
	promise</b>—rather, as the <i>Greek,</i> "The Spirit of
	promise, even the Holy Spirit": The <i>Spirit promised</i> both
	in the Old and New Testaments (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:28">Joel 2:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:38">John 7:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>). "The word"
	<i>promised</i> the Holy Spirit. Those who "believed the word of
	truth" were sealed by the Spirit accordingly.</p>
