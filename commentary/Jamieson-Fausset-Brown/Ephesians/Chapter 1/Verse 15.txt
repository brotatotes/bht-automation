<p><b>15. Wherefore</b>—because ye are
	in Christ and sealed by His Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>I also</b>—on my part, in
	return for God's so great benefits to <i>you.</i>
</p>
<p><b>after I heard</b>—ever
	since I have heard. Not implying that he had only <i>heard</i> of
	their conversion: an erroneous argument used by some against the
	address of this Epistle to the Ephesians (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14- :">Ephesians 1:14- :</span>); but referring to the report he had heard <i>since</i> he
	was with them, as to their Christian graces. So in the case of
	Philemon, his "<i>beloved fellow laborer</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14- :">Ephesians 1:14- :</span>), he uses the same words (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:4">Philemon 1:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:5">Philemon 1:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>your faith</b>—rather, as
	<i>Greek,</i> "the faith among you," that is, which many
	(not all) of you have. 
	</p>
<p><b>love unto all the saints</b>—of
	whatever name, simply because they are saints. A distinguishing
	characteristic of true Christianity (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="phm+1:5- :">Philemon 1:5- :</span>). "<i>Faith</i> and <i>love</i> he often joins
	together. A wondrous pair" [CHRYSOSTOM].
	<i>Hope</i> is added, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>.</p>
