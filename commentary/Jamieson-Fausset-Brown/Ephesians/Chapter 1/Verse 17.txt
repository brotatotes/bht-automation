<p><b>17.</b> A fit prayer for all
	Christians. 
	</p>
<p><b>the God of our Lord
	Jesus</b>—appropriate title here; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> he treats of <i>God's</i> raising <i>Jesus</i> to be Head
	over all things to the Church. Jesus Himself called the Father "<i>My</i>
	God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:46">Matthew 27:46</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the Father of glory</b>—(Compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:2">Acts 7:2</span>). The Father of that
	infinite glory which shines in the face of Christ, who is "the
	glory" (the true Shekinah); through whom also "the glory of
	the inheritance" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>)
	shall be ours (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7-4">2 Corinthians 3:7-4</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the spirit of wisdom</b>—whose
	attribute is infinite wisdom and who works wisdom in believers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:7-47.3.4- :">2 Corinthians 3:7-47.3.4- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and revelation</b>—whose
	function it is to <i>reveal</i> to believers spiritual mysteries
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:14">John 16:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:15">John 16:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10">1 Corinthians 2:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in the knowledge</b>—rather,
	as <i>Greek</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:10- :">1 Corinthians 2:10- :</span>),
	"in the <i>full knowledge</i> of Him," namely, God.</p>
