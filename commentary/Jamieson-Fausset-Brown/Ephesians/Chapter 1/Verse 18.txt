<p><b>18. understanding</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, read "heart." Compare
	the contrary state of unbelieving, the <i>heart</i> being in fault
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:18">Ephesians 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:15">Matthew 13:15</span>).
	Translate, "Having the eyes of your heart enlightened"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:14">Ephesians 5:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:16">Matthew 4:16</span>).
	The first effect of the Spirit moving in the new creation, as in the
	original physical creation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:3">Genesis 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>). So THEOPHILUS
	to AUTOLYCUS (1.3), "the
	ears of the heart." Where spiritual <i>light</i> is, there is
	<i>life</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>). The heart
	is "the core of life" [HARLESS],
	and the fountain of the thoughts; whence "the heart" in
	Scripture includes the <i>mind,</i> as well as the inclination. Its
	"eye," or inward vision, both receives and contemplates the
	light (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:22">Matthew 6:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:23">Matthew 6:23</span>).
	The eye is the symbol of intelligence (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:23- :">Matthew 6:23- :</span>).

<p><b>his inheritance in the
	saints</b>—The inheritance which he has in store in the case of the
	saints. I prefer explaining, "The inheritance which He has in
	his saints." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>;
