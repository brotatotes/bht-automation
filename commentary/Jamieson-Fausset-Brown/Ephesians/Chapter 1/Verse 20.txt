<p><b>20. in Christ</b>—as our
	"first-fruits" of the resurrection, and Head, in virtue of
	God's mighty working in whom His power to us-ward is made possible
	and actual [ALFORD]. 
	</p>
<p><b>when he raised him</b>—"in
	that He raised Him." The raising of Christ is not only an
	earnest of our bodies being hereafter raised, but has a spiritual
	power in it involving (by virtue of our living union with Him, as
	members with the Head) the resurrection, spiritually of the
	believer's soul now, and, consequently, of his body hereafter
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:8-11">Romans 6:8-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>).
	The Son, too, as God (though not as man), had a share in raising His
	own human body (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:19">John 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:17">John 10:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:18">John 10:18</span>). Also the Holy Spirit
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:18">1 Peter 3:18</span>).

<p><b>set </b><i><b>him</b></i><b>
</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "made Him sit." The glorious spirits
	<i>stand</i> about the throne of God, but they do not <i>sit at God's
	right hand</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>at his own right hand</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1">Psalms 110:1</span>). Where He remains
	till all His enemies have been put under His feet (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1- :">Psalms 110:1- :</span>). Being appointed to "rule in the midst of His
	enemies" during their rebellion (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1- :">Psalms 110:1- :</span>), He shall resign His commission after their subjection
	[PEARSON] (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:19">Mark 16:19</span>;

	</p>
<p><b>in the heavenly places</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>). As Christ has a
	literal body, heaven is not merely a state, but a <i>place;</i> and
	where He is, there His people shall be (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3- :">Ephesians 1:3- :</span>).</p>
