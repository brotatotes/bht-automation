	Jesus is "King of kings, and Lord of lords" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:38- :">Romans 8:38- :</span>). The higher is His honor, the greater is that of His
	people, who are His members joined to Him, the Head. Some
	philosophizing teachers of the school of Simon Magus, in Western Asia
	Minor, had, according to IRENÆUS
	and EPIPHANIUS, taught
	their hearers these names of various ranks of angels. Paul shows that
	the truest wisdom is to know Christ as reigning above them all.
