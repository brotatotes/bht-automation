<p><b>22. put . . . under</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"put in subjection under" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:6">Psalms 8:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:27">1 Corinthians 15:27</span>).

<p><b>gave . . . to the church</b>—for
	her special advantage. The <i>Greek</i> order is emphatic: "HIM
	He gave as Head over all things to the Church." Had it been
	anyone save HIM, her Head,
	it would not have been the boon it is to the Church. But as <i>He</i>
	is Head over all things who is also her Head (and she the body), all
	things are hers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:27- :">1 Corinthians 15:27- :</span>). He is OVER
	("far above") all things; in contrast to the words, "TO
	<i>the Church,</i>" namely, <i>for her advantage.</i> The former
	are subject; the latter is joined with Him in His dominion over them.
	"Head" implies not only His dominion, but our union;
	therefore, while we look upon Him at the right hand of God, we see
	ourselves in heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:21">Revelation 3:21</span>).
	For the Head and body are not severed by anything intervening, else
	the body would cease to be the body, and the Head cease to be the
	Head [PEARSON from
	CHRYSOSTOM].</p>
