23. his body—His mystical and
	spiritual, not literal, body. Not, however, merely figurative, or
	metaphorical. He is really, though spiritually, the Church's Head.
	His life is her life. She shares His crucifixion and His consequent
	glory. He possesses everything, His fellowship with the Father, His
	fulness of the Spirit, and His glorified manhood, not merely for
	Himself, but for her, who has a membership of His body, of His
	flesh, and of His bones (Ephesians 5:30).
	fulness—"the
	filled-up receptacle" [EADIE].
	The Church is dwelt in and filled by Christ. She is the
	receptacle, not of His inherent, but of His communicated,
	plenitude of gifts and graces. As His is the "fulness"
	(John 1:16; Colossians 1:19;
	Colossians 2:9) inherently, so she is
	His "fulness" by His impartation of it to her, in virtue of
	her union to Him (Ephesians 5:18;
	Colossians 2:10). "The full
	manifestation of His being, because penetrated by His life"
	[CONYBEARE and HOWSON].
	She is the continued revelation of His divine life in human form; the
	fullest representative of His plenitude. Not the angelic
	hierarchy, as false teachers taught (Colossians 2:9;
	Colossians 2:10; Colossians 2:18),
	but Christ Himself is the "fulness of the Godhead," and she
	represents Him. KOPPE
	translates less probably, "the whole universal multitude." 
	filleth all in all—Christ
	as the Creator, Preserver, and Governor of the world, constituted by
	God (Colossians 1:16-19),
	fills all the universe of things with all things.
	"Fills all creation with whatever it possesses" [ALFORD].
	The Greek is, "filleth for Himself."
