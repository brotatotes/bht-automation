<p><b>3.</b> The doxologies in almost all
	the Epistles imply the real sense of grace experienced by the writers
	and their readers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3- :">1 Peter 1:3- :</span> sets forth summarily the Gospel of the grace of God: the
	FATHER'S work of love, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3- :">1 Peter 1:3- :</span> (choosing us to <i>holiness,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3- :">1 Peter 1:3- :</span>; to <i>sonship,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:5">Ephesians 1:5</span>;
	to <i>acceptance,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>):
	the SON'S, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6- :">Ephesians 1:6- :</span> (<i>redemption,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>;
	<i>knowledge of the mystery of His will,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7- :">Ephesians 1:7- :</span>; <i>an inheritance,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7- :">Ephesians 1:7- :</span>); the HOLY
	SPIRIT'S, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7- :">Ephesians 1:7- :</span> (<i>sealing,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13">Ephesians 1:13</span>;
	giving an <i>earnest</i> of the inheritance, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13- :">Ephesians 1:13- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the God and Father of . . .
	Christ</b>—and so the God and Father of us who are in Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13- :">Ephesians 1:13- :</span>). God is "the God" of the <i>man</i> Jesus, and
	"the Father" of the <i>Divine Word.</i> The <i>Greek</i>
	is, "<i>Blessed</i> us," not "hath blessed us";
	referring to the past original counsel of God. As in creation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:13- :">Ephesians 1:13- :</span>) so in redemption (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:3">Genesis 12:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3-11">Matthew 5:3-11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>)
	God "blesses" His children; and that not in mere <i>words,</i>
	but in <i>acts.</i>
</p>
<p><b>us</b>—all Christians. 
	</p>
<p><b>blessings</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"blessing." "All," that is, "<i>every
	possible</i> blessing for time and eternity, which <i>the Spirit</i>
	has to bestow" (so "spiritual" means; not "spiritual,"
	as the term is now used, as opposed to <i>bodily</i>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in heavenly </b><i><b>places</b></i><b>
</b>—a phrase five times found in this Epistle, and not elsewhere
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:6">Ephesians 2:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>);
	<i>Greek,</i> "in <i>the</i> heavenly places." Christ's
	ascension is the means of introducing us into the heavenly places,
	which by our sin were barred against us. Compare the change made by
	Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>).
	While Christ in the flesh was in the form of a <i>servant,</i> God's
	people could not realize fully their heavenly privileges as sons. Now
	"our <i>citizenship</i> (<i>Greek</i>) is in heaven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20- :">Ephesians 1:20- :</span>), where our High Priest is ever "blessing" us. Our
	"treasures" are there (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:20">Matthew 6:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:21">Matthew 6:21</span>); our aims and
	affections (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:2">Colossians 3:2</span>);
	our hope (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:13">Titus 2:13</span>);
	our inheritance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4">1 Peter 1:4</span>). The
	gift of the Spirit itself, the source of the "spiritual
	blessing," is by virtue of Jesus having ascended thither (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:4- :">1 Peter 1:4- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in Christ</b>—the center
	and source of all blessing to us.</p>
