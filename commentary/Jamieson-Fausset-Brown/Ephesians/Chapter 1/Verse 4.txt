<p><b>4. hath chosen us</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>chose</i> us out for Himself" (namely, <i>out of</i>
	the world, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4">Galatians 1:4</span>): referring to
	His original choice, spoken of as <i>past.</i>
</p>
<p><b>in him</b>—The repetition
	of the idea, "in Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4- :">Galatians 1:4- :</span>), implies the paramount importance of the truth that it is <i>in
	Him,</i> and by virtue of union to Him, the Second Adam, the Restorer
	ordained for us from everlasting, the Head of redeemed humanity,
	believers have all their blessings (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4- :">Galatians 1:4- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>before the foundation of the
	world</b>—This assumes the eternity of the Son of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>), as of the election of
	believers in Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:9">2 Timothy 1:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that we should be
	holy</b>—positively (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+14:2">Deuteronomy 14:2</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>without blame</b>—negatively
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:27">Ephesians 5:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13">1 Thessalonians 3:13</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>before him</b>—It is to Him
	the believer looks, walking as in His presence, before whom he looks
	to be accepted in the judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:13- :">1 Thessalonians 3:13- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:15">Revelation 7:15</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in love</b>—joined by
	BENGEL and others with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:15- :">Revelation 7:15- :</span>, "in love having predestinated us," c. But <i>English
	Version</i> is better. The words qualify the whole clause, "that
	we should be holy . . . before Him." Love, lost to man by the
	fall, but restored by redemption, is the root and fruit and sum of
	all holiness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:12">1 Thessalonians 3:12</span>;
