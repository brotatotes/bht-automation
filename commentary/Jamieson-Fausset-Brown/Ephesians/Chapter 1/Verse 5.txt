5. predestinated—more special
	in respect to the end and precise means, than "chosen"
	or elected. We are "chosen" out of the rest of
	the world; "predestinated" to all things that secure
	the inheritance for us (Ephesians 1:11;
	Romans 8:29). "Foreordained."
	by Jesus—Greek,
	"through Jesus." 
	to himself—the Father
	(Colossians 1:20). ALFORD
	explains, "adoption . . . into Himself," that is, so
	that we should be partakers of the divine nature (Colossians 1:20- :). LACHMANN reads,
	"unto Him." The context favors the explanation of
	CALVIN: God has regard to
	Himself and the glory of His grace (Ephesians 1:6;
	Ephesians 1:12; Ephesians 1:14)
	as His ultimate end. He had one only-begotten Son, and He was pleased
	for His own glory, to choose out of a lost world many to
	become His adopted sons. Translate, "unto Himself." 
	the good pleasure of his
	will—So the Greek (Matthew 11:26;
	Luke 10:21). We cannot go beyond
	"the good pleasure of His will" in searching into the
	causes of our salvation, or of any of His works (Luke 10:21- :). (Job 33:13.) Why
	needest thou philosophize about an imaginary world of optimism? Thy
	concern is to take heed that thou be not bad. There was nothing in us
	which deserved His love (Ephesians 1:1;
	Ephesians 1:9; Ephesians 1:11)
