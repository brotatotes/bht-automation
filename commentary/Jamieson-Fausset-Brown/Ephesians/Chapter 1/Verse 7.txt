<p><b>7. In whom</b>—"the Beloved"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24">Romans 3:24</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>we have</b>—as a <i>present</i>
	possession. 
	</p>
<p><b>redemption</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>our</i> (literally, '<i>the</i>') redemption"; THE
	redemption which is the grand subject of all revelation, and
	especially of the New Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:24- :">Romans 3:24- :</span>), namely, from the power, guilt, and penal consequences of
	sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>). If a man were
	unable to redeem himself from being a bond-servant, his kinsman might
	redeem him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+25:48">Leviticus 25:48</span>). Hence,
	antitypically the Son of God became the Son of man, that as our
	kinsman He might redeem us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+25:48- :">Leviticus 25:48- :</span>). Another "redemption" follows, namely, that "of
	the purchased possession" hereafter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+25:48- :">Leviticus 25:48- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>through his blood</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+25:48- :">Leviticus 25:48- :</span>); as the instrument; the propitiation, that is, the
	consideration (devised by His own love) for which He, who was justly
	angry (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+12:1">Isaiah 12:1</span>), becomes
	propitious to us; the expiation, the price paid to divine justice for
	our sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:28">Acts 20:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:20">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20">Colossians 1:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>the forgiveness of
	sins</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "the remission of <i>our
	transgressions</i>": not merely "<i>pretermission,</i>"
	as the <i>Greek</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:25">Romans 3:25</span>)
	ought to be translated. This "remission," being the
	explanation of "redemption," includes not only deliverance
	from sin's penalty, but from its pollution and enslaving power,
	negatively; and the reconciliation of an offended God, and a
	satisfaction unto a just God, positively. 
	</p>
<p><b>riches of his grace</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:7">Ephesians 2:7</span>); "the exceeding
	riches of His grace." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:18">Ephesians 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:16">Ephesians 3:16</span>, "according to the
	riches of His glory": so that "grace" is His "glory."</p>
