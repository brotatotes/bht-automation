7. In whom—"the Beloved"
	(Ephesians 1:6; Romans 3:24).
	we have—as a present
	possession. 
	redemption—Greek,
	"our (literally, 'the') redemption"; THE
	redemption which is the grand subject of all revelation, and
	especially of the New Testament (Romans 3:24- :), namely, from the power, guilt, and penal consequences of
	sin (Matthew 1:21). If a man were
	unable to redeem himself from being a bond-servant, his kinsman might
	redeem him (Leviticus 25:48). Hence,
	antitypically the Son of God became the Son of man, that as our
	kinsman He might redeem us (Leviticus 25:48- :). Another "redemption" follows, namely, that "of
	the purchased possession" hereafter (Leviticus 25:48- :). 
	through his blood— (Leviticus 25:48- :); as the instrument; the propitiation, that is, the
	consideration (devised by His own love) for which He, who was justly
	angry (Isaiah 12:1), becomes
	propitious to us; the expiation, the price paid to divine justice for
	our sin (Acts 20:28; Romans 3:25;
	1 Corinthians 6:20; Colossians 1:20;
	1 Peter 1:18; 1 Peter 1:19).
	the forgiveness of
	sins—Greek, "the remission of our
	transgressions": not merely "pretermission,"
	as the Greek (Romans 3:25)
	ought to be translated. This "remission," being the
	explanation of "redemption," includes not only deliverance
	from sin's penalty, but from its pollution and enslaving power,
	negatively; and the reconciliation of an offended God, and a
	satisfaction unto a just God, positively. 
	riches of his grace—
	(Ephesians 2:7); "the exceeding
	riches of His grace." Compare Ephesians 1:18;
	Ephesians 3:16, "according to the
	riches of His glory": so that "grace" is His "glory."
