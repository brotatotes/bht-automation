<p><b>8.</b> Rather, "which He made
	to abound towards us." 
	</p>
<p><b>all wisdom and
	prudence</b>â€”"wisdom" in devising the plan of redeeming
	mankind; "prudence" in executing it by the means, and in
	making all the necessary arrangements of Providence for that purpose.
	Paul attributes to the Gospel of God's grace "all" possible
	"wisdom and prudence," in opposition to the boasts of
	wisdom and prudence which the unbelieving Jews and heathen
	philosophers and false apostles arrogated for their teachings. Christ
	crucified, though esteemed "foolishness" by the world, is
	"the wisdom of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>,
	"the <i>manifold</i> wisdom of God."</p>
