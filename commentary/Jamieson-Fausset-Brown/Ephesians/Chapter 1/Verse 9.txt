<p><b>9.</b> "He hath abounded,"
	or "made (grace) to abound toward us" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), <i>in that He made known</i> to us, namely, experimentally,
	in our hearts.

<p><b>the mystery</b>—God's
	purpose of redemption hidden heretofore in His counsels, but now
	revealed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:19">Ephesians 6:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>;

	This "mystery" is not like the heathen mysteries, which
	were imparted only to the initiated few. All Christians are the
	initiated. Only unbelievers are the uninitiated.

<p><b>according to his good
	pleasure</b>—showing the cause why "He hath made known to us
	the mystery," namely, His own loving "good pleasure"
	toward us; also the <i>time</i> and <i>manner</i> of His doing so,
	are according to His good pleasure.

<p><b>purposed</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27- :">Colossians 1:27- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in himself</b>—God the
	Father. BENGEL takes it,
	"in <i>Him,</i>" that is, <i>Christ,</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:3">Ephesians 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>. But the proper name, "in
	<i>Christ,</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>,
	immediately after, is inconsistent with His being here meant by the
	pronoun.</p>
