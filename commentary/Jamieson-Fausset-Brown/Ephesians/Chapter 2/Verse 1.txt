<p><b>1. And you</b>—"You also,"
	among those who have experienced His mighty power in enabling them to
	believe (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19-23">Ephesians 1:19-23</span>). 
	</p>
<p><i><b>hath he quickened</b></i><b>
</b>—supplied from the <i>Greek</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19-49.1.23- :">Ephesians 1:19-49.1.23- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>dead</b>—spiritually. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19-49.1.23- :">Ephesians 1:19-49.1.23- :</span>). A living corpse: without the gracious presence of God's
	Spirit in the soul, and so unable to think, will, or do aught that is
	holy. 
	</p>
<p><b>in trespasses . . . sins</b>—<i>in</i>
	them, as the element in which the unbeliever is, and through which he
	is dead to the true life. Sin is the death of the soul. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:2">Isaiah 9:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>, "dead"
	(spiritually), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:6">1 Timothy 5:6</span>.
	"Alienated from the <i>life</i> of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:6- :">1 Timothy 5:6- :</span>). Translate, as <i>Greek,</i> "in your trespasses,"
	c. "Trespass" in <i>Greek,</i> expresses a FALL
	or LAPSE, such as the
	transgression of Adam whereby he fell. "Sin." (<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>hamartia</i>") implies innate <i>corruption</i> and
	ALIENATION from God
	(literally, <i>erring of the mind from the rule of truth</i>),
	exhibited in <i>acts</i> of sin (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>hamartemata</i>").
	BENGEL, refers
	"trespasses" to the Jews who had the law, and yet revolted
	from it "sins," to the Gentiles who know not God.</p>
