<p><b>10. workmanship</b>—literally, "a
	thing of His making"; "handiwork." Here the spiritual
	creation, not the physical, is referred to (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:9">Ephesians 2:9</span>).

<p><b>unto good works</b>—"<i>for</i>
	good works." "Good works" cannot be performed until we
	are new "created unto" them. Paul never calls the works of
	the law "good works." We are not <i>saved by,</i> but
	<i>created unto,</i> good works.

<p><b>before ordained</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"before made ready" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:17- :">2 Corinthians 5:17- :</span>). God marks out for each in His purposes beforehand, the
	particular good works, and the time and way which tie sees best. God
	both makes ready by His providence the opportunities for <i>the
	works,</i> and makes us ready for their performance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:16">John 15:16</span>;

<p><b>that we should walk in
	them</b>—not "be saved" by them. Works do not justify,
	but the justified man works (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:21- :">2 Timothy 2:21- :</span>).</p>
