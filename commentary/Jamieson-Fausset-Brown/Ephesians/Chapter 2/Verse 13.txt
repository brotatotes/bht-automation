<p><b>in Christ Jesus</b>—"Jesus"
	is here added, whereas the expression before (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12- :">Ephesians 2:12- :</span>) had been merely "Christ," to mark that they know

<p><b>far off</b>—the Jewish
	description of the Gentiles. Far off from God and from the people of
	God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:17">Ephesians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:19">Isaiah 57:19</span>;

<p><b>are</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "have
	been." 
	</p>
<p><b>by</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "in."
	Thus "the blood of Christ" is made the seal of a covenant
	IN which their nearness to God consists. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:39- :">Acts 2:39- :</span>, where the blood is more directly spoken of as the
	<i>instrument,</i> it is "<i>through</i> His blood"
	[ALFORD].</p>
