	alone, pre-eminently, and none else. Emphatical. 
	our peace—not merely
	"Peacemaker," but "Himself" the price of our
	(Jews' and Gentiles' alike) peace with God, and so the bond of union
	between "both" in God. He took both into Himself, and
	reconciled them, united, to God, by His assuming our nature and our
	penal and legal liabilities (Ephesians 2:15;
	Isaiah 9:5; Isaiah 9:6;
	Isaiah 53:5; Micah 5:5;
	Colossians 1:20). His title, "Shiloh,"
	means the same (Genesis 49:10). 
	the middle wall of
	partition—Greek, ". . . of the partition"
	or "fence"; the middle wall which parted Jew
	and Gentile. There was a balustrade of stone which separated the
	court of the Gentiles from the holy place, which it was death for a
	Gentile to pass. But this, though incidentally alluded to, was but a
	symbol of the partition itself, namely, "the enmity"
	between "both" and God (Genesis 49:10- :), the real cause of separation from God, and so the mediate
	cause of their separation from one another. Hence there was a twofold
	wall of partition, one the inner wall, severing the Jewish people
	from entrance to the holy part of the temple where the priests
	officiated, the other the outer wall, separating the Gentile
	proselytes from access to the court of the Jews (compare Ezekiel 44:7;
	Acts 21:28). Thus this twofold
	wall represented the Sinaitic law, which both severed all men,
	even the Jews, from access to God (through sin, which is the
	violation of the law), and also separated the Gentiles from the Jews.
	As the term "wall" implies the strength of the
	partition, so "fence" implies that it was easily removed by
	God when the due time came.
