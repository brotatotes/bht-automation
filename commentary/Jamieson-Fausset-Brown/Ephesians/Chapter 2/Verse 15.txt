<p><b>15.</b> Rather, make "enmity"
	an apposition to "the middle wall of partition"; "Hath

	of the commandments (consisting) in ordinances." This law was
	"the partition" or "fence," which embodied the
	expression of the "enmity" (the "wrath" of God
	against our sin, and our enmity to Him, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:3- :">Romans 8:3- :</span>) (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7">Romans 8:7</span>). Christ has in, or by,
	His crucified flesh, abolished it, so far as its condemning and
	enmity-creating power is concerned (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:7- :">Romans 8:7- :</span>), substituting for it the law of love, which is the
	everlasting spirit of the law, and which flows from the realization
	in the soul of His love in His death for us. Translate what follows,
	"that He might make the two (Jews and Gentiles) into one new
	man." Not that He might merely reconcile the two to each other,
	but incorporate the two, reconciled in Him to God, into one new man;
	the old man to which both belonged, the enemy of God, having been
	slain in His flesh on the cross. Observe, too, ONE new man; we are
	all in God's sight but one in Christ, as we are but one in Adam
	[ALFORD].
