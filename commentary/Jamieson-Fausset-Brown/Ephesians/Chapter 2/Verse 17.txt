<p><b>17.</b> Translate, "He came and
	announced glad tidings of peace." "He came" of His own
	free love, and "announced peace" with His own mouth to the
	apostles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:36">Luke 24:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:19">John 20:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:21">John 20:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:26">John 20:26</span>);
	and by them to others, through His Spirit present in His Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:26- :">John 20:26- :</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:23">Acts 26:23</span> is
	strictly parallel; after His resurrection "He showed light to
	the people ('them that were nigh') and to the Gentiles ('you that
	were afar off')," by His Spirit in His ministers (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:23- :">Acts 26:23- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and to them</b>â€”The oldest
	manuscripts insert "peace" again: "And peace to them."
	The repetition implies the joy with which both alike would dwell
	again and again upon the welcome word "peace." So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:23- :">Acts 26:23- :</span>.</p>
