<p><b>the prince of the power of
	the air</b>—the unseen God who lies underneath guiding "the
	course of this world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19- :">1 John 5:19- :</span>); ranging through the <i>air</i> around us: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:19- :">1 John 5:19- :</span>, "fowls of the air" (<i>Greek,</i> "heaven")
	that is, (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>), "Satan"
	and his demons. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:31">John 12:31</span>. Christ's ascension
	seems to have cast Satan out of heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:5">Revelation 12:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:10">Revelation 12:10</span>;

	where he had been heretofore the accuser of the brethren (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:13- :">Revelation 12:13- :</span>). No longer able to accuse <i>in heaven</i> those
	justified by Christ, the ascended Saviour (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:33">Romans 8:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:34">Romans 8:34</span>), he assails them on
	earth with all trials and temptations; and "we live in an
	atmosphere poisonous and impregnated with deadly elements. But a
	mighty purification of the air will be effected by Christ's coming"
	[AUBERLEN], for Satan
	shall be bound (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:12">Revelation 12:12</span>;

	is here used collectively for the "powers of the air"; in
	apposition with which "powers" stand the "spirits,"
	comprehended in the singular, "the spirit," taken also
	collectively: the aggregate of the "seducing spirits" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:3- :">Revelation 20:3- :</span>) which "work now (<i>still;</i> not merely, as in your
	case, 'in time <i>past</i>') in the sons of disobedience" (a
	Hebraism: men who are not merely by accident disobedient, but who are
	essentially <i>sons of disobedience</i> itself: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:3- :">Revelation 20:3- :</span>), and of which Satan is here declared to be "the
	prince." The <i>Greek</i> does not allow "the spirit"
	to refer to <i>Satan,</i> "the prince" himself, but to "<i>the
	powers of the air</i>" of which he is prince. The powers of the
	air are the embodiment of that evil "spirit" which is the
	ruling principle of unbelievers, especially the heathen (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:3- :">Revelation 20:3- :</span>), as opposed to the spirit of the children of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:3- :">Revelation 20:3- :</span>). The potency of that "spirit" is shown in the
	"disobedience" of the former. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:3- :">Revelation 20:3- :</span>, "children in whom is no faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+30:9">Isaiah 30:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:4">Isaiah 57:4</span>). They disobey the
