2. the course of this world—the
	career (literally, "the age," compare  :-), or present system of this world (1 Corinthians 2:6;
	1 Corinthians 2:12; 1 Corinthians 3:18;
	1 Corinthians 3:19, as opposed to "the
	world to come"): alien from God, and lying in the wicked one
	(1 John 5:19). "The age"
	(which is something more external and ethical) regulates "the
	world" (which is something more external). 
	the prince of the power of
	the air—the unseen God who lies underneath guiding "the
	course of this world" (1 John 5:19- :); ranging through the air around us: compare 1 John 5:19- :, "fowls of the air" (Greek, "heaven")
	that is, (Ephesians 2:15), "Satan"
	and his demons. Compare Ephesians 6:12;
	John 12:31. Christ's ascension
	seems to have cast Satan out of heaven (Revelation 12:5;
	Revelation 12:9; Revelation 12:10;
	Revelation 12:12; Revelation 12:13),
	where he had been heretofore the accuser of the brethren (Revelation 12:13- :). No longer able to accuse in heaven those
	justified by Christ, the ascended Saviour (Romans 8:33;
	Romans 8:34), he assails them on
	earth with all trials and temptations; and "we live in an
	atmosphere poisonous and impregnated with deadly elements. But a
	mighty purification of the air will be effected by Christ's coming"
	[AUBERLEN], for Satan
	shall be bound (Revelation 12:12;
	Revelation 12:13; Revelation 12:15;
	Revelation 12:17; Revelation 20:2;
	Revelation 20:3). "The power"
	is here used collectively for the "powers of the air"; in
	apposition with which "powers" stand the "spirits,"
	comprehended in the singular, "the spirit," taken also
	collectively: the aggregate of the "seducing spirits" (Revelation 20:3- :) which "work now (still; not merely, as in your
	case, 'in time past') in the sons of disobedience" (a
	Hebraism: men who are not merely by accident disobedient, but who are
	essentially sons of disobedience itself: compare Revelation 20:3- :), and of which Satan is here declared to be "the
	prince." The Greek does not allow "the spirit"
	to refer to Satan, "the prince" himself, but to "the
	powers of the air" of which he is prince. The powers of the
	air are the embodiment of that evil "spirit" which is the
	ruling principle of unbelievers, especially the heathen (Revelation 20:3- :), as opposed to the spirit of the children of God (Revelation 20:3- :). The potency of that "spirit" is shown in the
	"disobedience" of the former. Compare Revelation 20:3- :, "children in whom is no faith" (Isaiah 30:9;
	Isaiah 57:4). They disobey the
	Gospel both in faith and practice (2 Thessalonians 1:8;
	2 Corinthians 2:12).
