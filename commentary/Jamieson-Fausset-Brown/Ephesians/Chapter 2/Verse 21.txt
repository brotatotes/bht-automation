<p><b>groweth</b>—"is

	image; the Church has the <i>growth</i> of a living organism, not the
	mere <i>increase</i> of a building. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; "<i>lively</i> stones . . . built up a spiritual
	house." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:16">Ephesians 4:16</span>;

<p><b>holy</b>—as being the
	"habitation <i>of God</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:12- :">Zechariah 6:12- :</span>). So "in the Lord" (Christ) answers to "through
