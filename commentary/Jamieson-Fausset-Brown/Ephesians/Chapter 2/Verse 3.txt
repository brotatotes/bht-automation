<p><b>3. also we</b>—that is, <i>we
	also.</i> Paul here joins himself in the same category with them,
	passing from the second person (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:1">Ephesians 2:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>) to the first person
	here.

<p><b>all</b>—Jews and Gentiles.

<p><b>our conversation</b>—"our

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>). This expression
	implies an outwardly more <i>decorous</i> course, than the open
	"walk" in <i>gross sins</i> on the part of the majority of
	Ephesians in times past, the Gentile portion of whom may be specially
	referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>. Paul and
	his Jewish countrymen, though outwardly more seemly than the Gentiles
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:4">Acts 26:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:5">Acts 26:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>), had been essentially
	like them in living to the unrenewed flesh, without the Spirit of
	God.

<p><b>fulfilling</b>—<i>Greek,</i>

<p><b>mind</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "our

	as distinguished from the blind impulses of "the flesh." 
	</p>
<p><b>and were by nature</b>—He
	intentionally breaks off the construction, substituting "and we
	were" for "and being," to mark emphatically his and
	their <i>past</i> state by nature, as contrasted with their present
	state by grace. Not merely is it, we had our way of life fulfilling
	our fleshly desires, <i>and so being</i> children of wrath; but <i>we
	were by nature</i> originally "children of wrath," and so
	consequently had our way of life fulfilling our fleshly desires.
	"Nature," in <i>Greek,</i> implies that which has <i>grown</i>
	in us as the peculiarity of our being, growing with our growth, and
	strengthening with our strength, as distinguished from that which has
	been wrought on us by mere external influences: what is inherent, not
	acquired (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+14:4">Job 14:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:5">Psalms 51:5</span>).
	An incidental proof of the doctrine of original sin. 
	</p>
<p><b>children of wrath</b>—not
	merely "sons," as in the <i>Greek,</i> "sons of
	disobedience" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>),
	but "children" <i>by generation;</i> not merely <i>by
	adoption,</i> as "sons" might be. The <i>Greek</i> order
	more emphatically marks this innate corruption: "Those who in
	their (very) nature are children of wrath"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2- :">Ephesians 2:2- :</span>, "grace" is opposed to "nature" here; and
	<i>salvation</i> (implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:5">Ephesians 2:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>, "saved") to
	"wrath." Compare Article IX, <i>Church of England Common
	Prayer Book.</i> "Original sin (birth-sin), standeth not in the
	following of Adam, but is the fault and corruption of the nature of
	every man, naturally engendered of Adam [Christ was <i>supernaturally</i>
	conceived by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin], whereby man is very far
	gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined
	to evil; and therefore, in every person born into this world, it
	deserveth God's wrath and damnation." Paul shows that even the
	Jews, who boasted of their birth from Abraham, were by natural birth
	equally children of wrath as the Gentiles, whom the Jews despised on
	account of their birth from idolaters (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:9">Romans 3:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12-14">Romans 5:12-14</span>). "<i>Wrath</i>
	abideth" on all who disobey the Gospel in faith and practice
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>). The phrase,
	"children of wrath," is a Hebraism, that is, objects of
	God's wrath from childhood, in our natural state, as being born in
	the sin which God hates. So "son of death" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36- :">John 3:36- :</span>, <i>Margin</i>); "son of perdition" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>).
