<p><b>4. God, who is rich</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	"(as) <i>being</i> rich in mercy."

<p><b>for</b>—that is, "<i>because</i>
	of His great love." This was the <i>special</i> ground of God's
	saving us; as "rich in mercy" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:7">Ephesians 2:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12">Romans 10:12</span>) was the general
	ground. "<i>Mercy</i> takes away misery; <i>love</i> confers
	salvation" [BENGEL].</p>
