5. dead in sins—The best
	reading is in the Greek, "dead in our (literally,
	'the') trespasses." 
	quickened—"vivified"
	spiritually, and consequences hereafter, corporally. There must be a
	spiritual resurrection of the soul before there can be a comfortable
	resurrection of the body [PEARSON]
	(John 11:25; John 11:26;
	Romans 8:11). 
	together with Christ—The
	Head being seated at God's right hand, the body also sits there with
	Him [CHRYSOSTOM]. We are
	already seated there IN
	Him ("in Christ Jesus," Romans 8:11- :), and hereafter shall be seated by Him; IN
	Him already as in our Head, which is the ground of our hope; by
	Him hereafter, as by the conferring cause, when hope shall be
	swallowed up in fruition [PEARSON].
	What God wrought in Christ, He wrought (by the very fact) in all
	united to Christ, and one with Him. 
	by grace ye are saved—Greek,
	"Ye are in a saved state." Not merely "ye are being
	saved," but ye "are passed from death unto life" (Romans 8:11- :). Salvation is to the Christian not a thing to be waited for
	hereafter, but already realized (Romans 8:11- :). The parenthetic introduction of this clause here (compare
	Ephesians 2:8) is a burst of Paul's
	feeling, and in order to make the Ephesians feel that grace
	from first to last is the sole source of salvation; hence, too, he
	says "ye," not "we."
