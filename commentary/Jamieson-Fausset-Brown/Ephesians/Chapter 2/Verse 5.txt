<p><b>5. dead in sins</b>—The best
	reading is in the <i>Greek,</i> "dead in <i>our</i> (literally,
	'<i>the</i>') <i>trespasses.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>quickened</b>—"vivified"
	spiritually, and consequences hereafter, corporally. There must be a
	spiritual resurrection of the soul before there can be a comfortable
	resurrection of the body [PEARSON]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:26">John 11:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>together with Christ</b>—The
	Head being seated at God's right hand, the body also sits there with
	Him [CHRYSOSTOM]. We are
	already seated there IN
	Him ("in Christ Jesus," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11- :">Romans 8:11- :</span>), and hereafter shall be seated <i>by</i> Him; IN
	Him already as in our Head, which is the ground of our hope; <i>by</i>
	Him hereafter, as by the conferring cause, when hope shall be
	swallowed up in fruition [PEARSON].
	What God wrought in Christ, He wrought (by the very fact) in all
	united to Christ, and one with Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>by grace ye are saved</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Ye are in a saved state." Not merely "ye are being
	saved," but ye "are passed from death unto life" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11- :">Romans 8:11- :</span>). Salvation is to the Christian not a thing to be waited for
	hereafter, but already realized (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11- :">Romans 8:11- :</span>). The parenthetic introduction of this clause here (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:8">Ephesians 2:8</span>) is a burst of Paul's
	feeling, and in order to make the Ephesians feel that <i>grace</i>
	from first to last is the sole source of salvation; hence, too, he
	says "ye," not "we."</p>
