	of the Gospel which supersede "the <i>age</i> (<i>Greek,</i> for
	'course') of this world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14- :">Ephesians 1:14- :</span>), and the past "ages" from which the mystery was
	hidden (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:26">Colossians 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:27">Colossians 1:27</span>).
	These good ages, though beginning with the first preaching of the
	Gospel, <i>and thenceforth continually succeeding one another,</i>
	are not consummated till the Lord's coming again (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:21">Ephesians 1:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:5">Hebrews 6:5</span>). The words, "coming
	on," do not exclude <i>the time then present,</i> but imply
	simply the ages <i>following</i> upon Christ's "raising them up
	together" spiritually (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:5- :">Hebrews 6:5- :</span>).

	often repeated, to mark that all our blessings center "IN
	HIM."</p>
