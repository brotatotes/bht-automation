<p><b>and that</b>—namely, <i>the
	act of believing,</i> or "faith." "Of yourselves"
	stands in opposition to, "it is the gift of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12- :">Colossians 2:12- :</span>). "That which I have said, 'through faith,' I do not
	wish to be understood so as if I excepted <i>faith</i> itself from
	<i>grace</i>" [ESTIUS].
	"God justifies the believing man, not for the worthiness of his
	belief, but for the worthiness of Him in whom he believes"
	[HOOKER]. The initiation,
	as well as the increase, of faith, is from the Spirit of God, not
	only by an external proposal of the word, but by internal
	illumination in the soul [PEARSON].
	Yet "faith" cometh by the means which man must avail
	himself of, namely, "hearing the word of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12- :">Colossians 2:12- :</span>), and prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:13">Luke 11:13</span>),
	though the blessing is wholly of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:7">1 Corinthians 3:7</span>).</p>
