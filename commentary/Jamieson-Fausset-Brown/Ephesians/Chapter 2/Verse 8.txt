8. For—illustrating "the
	exceeding riches of His grace in kindness." Translate as in  :-, "Ye are in a saved state." 
	through faith—the
	effect of the power of Christ's resurrection (Ephesians 1:19;
	Ephesians 1:20; Philippians 3:10)
	whereby we are "raised together" with Him (Ephesians 2:6;
	Colossians 2:12). Some of the oldest
	manuscripts read, "through your (literally, 'the')
	faith." The instrument or mean of salvation on the part of the
	person saved; Christ alone is the meritorious agent. 
	and that—namely, the
	act of believing, or "faith." "Of yourselves"
	stands in opposition to, "it is the gift of God" (Colossians 2:12- :). "That which I have said, 'through faith,' I do not
	wish to be understood so as if I excepted faith itself from
	grace" [ESTIUS].
	"God justifies the believing man, not for the worthiness of his
	belief, but for the worthiness of Him in whom he believes"
	[HOOKER]. The initiation,
	as well as the increase, of faith, is from the Spirit of God, not
	only by an external proposal of the word, but by internal
	illumination in the soul [PEARSON].
	Yet "faith" cometh by the means which man must avail
	himself of, namely, "hearing the word of God" (Colossians 2:12- :), and prayer (Luke 11:13),
	though the blessing is wholly of God (1 Corinthians 3:6;
	1 Corinthians 3:7).
