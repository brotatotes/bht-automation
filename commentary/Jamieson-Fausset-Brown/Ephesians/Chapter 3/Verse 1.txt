<p><b>1. of Jesus Christ</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"Christ Jesus." The <i>office</i> is the prominent thought
	in the latter arrangement; the <i>person,</i> in the former. He here
	marks the <i>Messiahship</i> of "Christ," maintained by him
	as the origin of his being a "prisoner," owing to the
	jealousy of the Jews being roused at his preaching it to <i>the
	Gentiles.</i> His very bonds were profitable to ("for" or
	"in behalf of you") Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:13">Ephesians 3:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:10">2 Timothy 2:10</span>). He digresses at "For
	this cause," and does not complete the sentence which he had
	intended, until <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:14">Ephesians 3:14</span>, where
	he resumes the words, "For this cause," namely, because I
	know this your call of God as Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:14- :">Ephesians 3:14- :</span>), to be "fellow-heirs" with the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:14- :">Ephesians 3:14- :</span>), "I bow my knees to" the Father of our common
	Saviour (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:14">Ephesians 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:15">Ephesians 3:15</span>)
	to confirm you in the faith by His Spirit. "I Paul,"
	expresses the agent employed by the Spirit to enlighten them, after
	he had been first enlightened himself by the same Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:3-5">Ephesians 3:3-5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span>).</p>
