<p><b>10.</b> The design of God in giving
	Paul grace to proclaim to the Gentiles the mystery of salvation
	heretofore hidden. 
	</p>
<p><b>now</b>—first: opposed to
	"hidden from the beginning of the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>unto the principalities
	and</b>—<i>Greek</i> adds "the" 
	</p>
<p><b>powers</b>—unto the various
	orders of <i>good</i> angels primarily, as these dwell "in the
	heavenly places" in the highest sense; "known" to
	their adoring joy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:16">1 Timothy 3:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:12">1 Peter 1:12</span>). Secondarily, God's
	wisdom in redemption is made known to <i>evil</i> angels, who dwell
	"in heavenly places" in a lower sense, namely, the air
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:2">Ephesians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>);
	"known" to their dismay (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24">1 Corinthians 15:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>might be known</b>—Translate,
	"may be known." 
	</p>
<p><b>by the church</b>—"by
	means of," or "through the Church," which is the
	"theater" for the display of God's manifold wisdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:10">Luke 15:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span>): "a spectacle
	(<i>Greek,</i> 'theater') to angels." Hence, angels are but our
	"fellow servants" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:9- :">1 Corinthians 4:9- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>manifold wisdom</b>—though
	essentially one, as Christ is one, yet varying the economy in respect
	to places, times, and persons (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:8">Isaiah 55:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:9">Isaiah 55:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>).
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:10">1 Peter 4:10</span>, "stewards
	of the manifold grace of God." Man cannot understand aright its
	single acts till he can survey them as a connected whole (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:10- :">1 Peter 4:10- :</span>). The call of the Church is no haphazard remedy, or
	afterthought, but part of the eternal scheme, which, amidst manifold
	varieties of dispensation, is one in its end.</p>
