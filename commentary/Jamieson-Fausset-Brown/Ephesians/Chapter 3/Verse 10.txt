10. The design of God in giving
	Paul grace to proclaim to the Gentiles the mystery of salvation
	heretofore hidden. 
	now—first: opposed to
	"hidden from the beginning of the world" ( :-). 
	unto the principalities
	and—Greek adds "the" 
	powers—unto the various
	orders of good angels primarily, as these dwell "in the
	heavenly places" in the highest sense; "known" to
	their adoring joy (1 Timothy 3:16;
	1 Peter 1:12). Secondarily, God's
	wisdom in redemption is made known to evil angels, who dwell
	"in heavenly places" in a lower sense, namely, the air
	(compare Ephesians 2:2; Ephesians 6:12);
	"known" to their dismay (1 Corinthians 15:24;
	Colossians 2:15). 
	might be known—Translate,
	"may be known." 
	by the church—"by
	means of," or "through the Church," which is the
	"theater" for the display of God's manifold wisdom (Luke 15:10;
	1 Corinthians 4:9): "a spectacle
	(Greek, 'theater') to angels." Hence, angels are but our
	"fellow servants" (1 Corinthians 4:9- :). 
	manifold wisdom—though
	essentially one, as Christ is one, yet varying the economy in respect
	to places, times, and persons (Isaiah 55:8;
	Isaiah 55:9; Hebrews 1:1).
	Compare 1 Peter 4:10, "stewards
	of the manifold grace of God." Man cannot understand aright its
	single acts till he can survey them as a connected whole (1 Peter 4:10- :). The call of the Church is no haphazard remedy, or
	afterthought, but part of the eternal scheme, which, amidst manifold
	varieties of dispensation, is one in its end.
