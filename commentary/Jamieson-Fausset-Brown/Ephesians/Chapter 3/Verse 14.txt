<p><b>14. For this cause</b>—Resuming
	the thread of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1">Ephesians 3:1</span>, "For
	this cause." Because ye have such a standing in God's Church
	[ALFORD]. 
	</p>
<p><b>bow my knees</b>—the proper
	attitude in humble prayer. Posture affects the mind, and is not
	therefore unimportant. See Paul's practice (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1- :">Ephesians 3:1- :</span>); and that of the Lord Himself on earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1- :">Ephesians 3:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>unto the Father</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts omit "of our Lord Jesus Christ." But
	<i>Vulgate</i> and some very old authorities retain them: <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:1- :">Ephesians 3:1- :</span>, "From whom," in either case, refers to "the
	Father" (<i>Patera</i>), as "family" (<i>patria,</i>
	akin in sound and etymology) plainly refers to Him. Still the
	foundation of all sonship is in Jesus Christ.</p>
