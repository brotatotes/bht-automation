<p><b>15. the whole family</b>—ALFORD,
	MIDDLETON, and others
	translate, "every family": alluding to the several <i>families</i>
	in heaven and in earth supposed to exist [THEOPHYLACT,
	<i>Æcumenius,</i> in SUICER,
	2.633], the apostle thus being supposed to imply that God, in His
	relation of Father to us His adopted children, is the great prototype
	of the paternal relation wherever found. But the idea that "the
	holy angels are bound up in spiritual <i>families</i> or
	<i>compaternities,</i>" is nowhere else in Scripture referred
	to. And <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span>, where the
	article is similarly omitted, and yet the translation is, "<i>All
	the</i> house of Israel," shows that in New Testament <i>Greek</i>
	the translation is justifiable, "<i>all the</i> family," or
	"<i>the whole</i> family": which accords with Scripture
	views, that angels and men, the saints militant and those with God,
	are one holy family joined under the one Father in Christ, the
	mediator between heaven and earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10">Philippians 2:10</span>). Hence angels are
	termed our "brethren" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10- :">Philippians 2:10- :</span>), and "sons of God" by creation, as we are by
	adoption (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+38:7">Job 38:7</span>). The Church
	is part of the grand family, or kingdom, which comprehends, besides
	men, the higher spiritual world, where the archetype, to the
	realization of which redeemed man is now tending, is already
	realized. This universal idea of the "kingdom" of God as
	one divine community, is presented to us in the Lord's Prayer. By sin
	men were estranged, not only from God, but from that higher spiritual
	world in which the kingdom of God is already realized. As Christ when
	He reconciled men to God, united them to one another in a divine
	community (joined to Himself, the one Head), breaking down the
	partition wall between Jew and Gentile (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+38:7- :">Job 38:7- :</span>), so also He joins them in communion with all those who have
	already attained that perfection in the kingdom of God, to which the
	Church on earth is aspiring (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+38:7- :">Job 38:7- :</span>) [NEANDER].
