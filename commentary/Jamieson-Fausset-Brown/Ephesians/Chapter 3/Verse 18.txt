	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13">Ephesians 4:13</span>) as to "the fulness
	of <i>Christ.</i>" The "breadth" implies Christ's
	world-wide love, embracing all men: the "length," its being
	extended through all ages (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:13- :">Ephesians 4:13- :</span>); the "depth," its profound wisdom which no
	creature can fathom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span>);
	the "height," its being beyond the reach of any foe to
	deprive us of (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8">Ephesians 4:8</span>)
	[BENGEL]. I prefer to
	understand "the breadth," &amp;c., to refer to <i>the whole
	of the vast mystery of free salvation in Christ for all, Gentile and
	Jew alike,</i> of which Paul had been speaking (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8- :">Ephesians 4:8- :</span>), and of which he now prays they may have a fuller
	comprehension. As subsidiary to this, and the most essential part of
	it, he adds, "and to know <i>the love of Christ</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:8- :">Ephesians 4:8- :</span>). GROTIUS
	understands <i>depth</i> and <i>height</i> of God's goodness raising
