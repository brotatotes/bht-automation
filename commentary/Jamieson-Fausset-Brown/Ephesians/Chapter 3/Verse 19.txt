	exceeds. The paradox "to know . . . which passeth knowledge,"
	implies that when he says "know," he does not mean that we
	can <i>adequately</i> know; all we know is, that His love exceeds far
	our knowledge of it, and with even our fresh accessions of knowledge
	hereafter, will still exceed them. Even as God's power exceeds our
	thoughts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:20">Ephesians 3:20</span>).

<p><b>filled with</b>—rather, as
	<i>Greek,</i> "filled even <i>unto</i> all the fulness of God"
	(this is the grand goal), that is, filled, each according to your
	capacity, with the divine wisdom, knowledge, and love; "<i>even
	as God is full,</i>" and as Christ who dwells in your hearts,
	hath "all the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in Him bodily"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>).</p>
