<p><b>not made known</b>—He does
	not say, "has not been <i>revealed.</i>" Making known by
	<i>revelation</i> is the source of making known by preaching
	[BENGEL]. The former was
	vouchsafed only to the prophets, in order that they might make known
	the truth so revealed to men in general.

	in their state by birth, as contrasted with those illuminated "by
	the Spirit" (<i>Greek,</i> "IN
	the Spirit," compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>),

<p><b>as</b>—The mystery of the
	call of the Gentiles (of which Paul speaks here) was not unknown to
	the Old Testament prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:6">Isaiah 56:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+56:7">Isaiah 56:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:6">Isaiah 49:6</span>).
	But they did not know it with the same explicit distinctness "As"
	it has been now known (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:19">Acts 10:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:20">Acts 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:18-21">Acts 11:18-21</span>).
	They probably did not know that the Gentiles were to be admitted
	without circumcision or that they were to be on a level with the Jews
	in partaking of the grace of God. The gift of "the Spirit"
	in its fulness was reserved for the New Testament that Christ might
	thereby be glorified. The epithet, "holy," marks the
	special consecration of the New Testament "prophets" (who
	are here meant) by the Spirit, compared with which even the Old
	Testament prophets were but "sons of men" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:18-44.11.21- :">Acts 11:18-44.11.21- :</span>, and elsewhere).</p>
