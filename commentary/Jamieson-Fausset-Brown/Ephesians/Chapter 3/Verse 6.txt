6. Translate, "That the
	Gentiles are," c. "and fellow members of the
	same body, and fellow partakers of the (so the oldest
	manuscripts read, not 'HIS')
	promise, in Christ Jesus (added in the oldest manuscripts),
	through the Gospel." It is "in Christ Jesus"
	that they are made "fellow heirs" in the inheritance of
	GOD: "of the same
	body" under the Head, CHRIST
	JESUS and "fellow
	partakers of the promise" in the communion of THE
	HOLY SPIRIT
	(Ephesians 1:13; Hebrews 6:4).
	The Trinity is thus alluded to, as often elsewhere in this Epistle
	(Ephesians 2:19; Ephesians 2:20;
	Ephesians 2:22).
