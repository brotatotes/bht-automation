	same body, and <i>fellow</i> partakers of <i>the</i> (so the oldest
	manuscripts read, not 'HIS')
	promise, in Christ <i>Jesus</i> (added in the oldest manuscripts),

	that they are made "fellow heirs" in the inheritance of
	GOD: "of the same

	JESUS and "fellow
	partakers of the promise" in the communion of THE
	HOLY SPIRIT
