	"To make all see how it hath seemed good to God at this time to
	<i>dispense</i> (through me and others, His <i>stewards</i>) what
	heretofore was a mystery." ELLICOTT
	explains it, "the arrangement," or "regulation"
	of the mystery (the union of Jews and Gentiles in Christ) which was
	now to be humbly traced and acknowledged in the fact of its having
	secretly existed in the counsel of God, and now having been revealed
	to the heavenly powers by means of the Church.

<p><b>from the beginning of the

	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7">1 Corinthians 2:7</span>. The "ages" are

<p><b>created all things by Jesus
	Christ</b>—God's creation of the world and all things therein is
	the foundation of the rest of the "economy," which is
	freely dispensed according to the universal power of God [BENGEL].
	AS God created "the whole range of things" (so the <i>Greek</i>),
	physical and spiritual alike, He must have an absolute right to
	adjust all things as He will. Hence, we may see His right to keep the
	mystery of world-wide salvation in Christ "hidden in Himself,"
	till his own good time for revealing it. The oldest manuscripts omit
	"by Jesus Christ."</p>
