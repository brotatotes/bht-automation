<p><b>18.</b> More literally, "Being
	darkened in their understanding," that is, their <i>intelligence,</i>
	or <i>perceptions</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:8">Ephesians 5:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:18">Acts 26:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span>;

<p><b>alienated</b>—This and
	"darkened," imply that before the fall they (in the person
	of their first father) had been partakers of <i>life</i> and <i>light:</i>
	and that they had revolted from the primitive revelation (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:5- :">1 Thessalonians 5:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>life of God</b>—that life
	whereby God lives in His own people: as He was the <i>life</i> and
	<i>light</i> in Adam before the irruption of death and darkness into
	human nature; and as He is the life in the regenerate (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:5- :">1 Thessalonians 5:5- :</span>). "Spiritual life in believers is kindled from the life
	itself of God" [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>through</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>on account of</i> the ignorance," namely,
	of God. Wilful ignorance in the first instance, their fathers not
	"choosing to retain God in their knowledge." This is the
	beginning point of their misery (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:30">Acts 17:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:23">Romans 1:23</span>;

	</p>
<p><b>because of</b>—"on
	account of." 
	</p>
<p><b>blindness</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"hardness," literally, the hardening of the skin so as not
	to be sensible of touch. Hence a soul's <i>callousness to feeling</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span>). Where there is
	spiritual "life" ("the life of God") there is
	feeling; where there is not, there is "hardness."</p>
