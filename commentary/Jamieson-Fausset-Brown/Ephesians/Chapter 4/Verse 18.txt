18. More literally, "Being
	darkened in their understanding," that is, their intelligence,
	or perceptions (compare Ephesians 5:8;
	Acts 26:18; 1 Thessalonians 5:4;
	1 Thessalonians 5:5). 
	alienated—This and
	"darkened," imply that before the fall they (in the person
	of their first father) had been partakers of life and light:
	and that they had revolted from the primitive revelation (compare 1 Thessalonians 5:5- :). 
	life of God—that life
	whereby God lives in His own people: as He was the life and
	light in Adam before the irruption of death and darkness into
	human nature; and as He is the life in the regenerate (1 Thessalonians 5:5- :). "Spiritual life in believers is kindled from the life
	itself of God" [BENGEL].
	through—rather as
	Greek, "on account of the ignorance," namely,
	of God. Wilful ignorance in the first instance, their fathers not
	"choosing to retain God in their knowledge." This is the
	beginning point of their misery (Acts 17:30;
	Romans 1:21; Romans 1:23;
	Romans 1:28; 1 Peter 1:14).
	because of—"on
	account of." 
	blindness—Greek,
	"hardness," literally, the hardening of the skin so as not
	to be sensible of touch. Hence a soul's callousness to feeling
	(Mark 3:5). Where there is
	spiritual "life" ("the life of God") there is
	feeling; where there is not, there is "hardness."
