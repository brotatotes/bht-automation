<p><b>19. past feeling</b>—senseless,
	shameless, hopeless; the ultimate result of a long process of
	"hardening," or habit of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "Being past hope," or despairing, is the reading
	of the <i>Vulgate;</i> though not so well supported as <i>English
	Version</i> reading, "past feeling," which includes the
	absence of hope (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:25">Jeremiah 2:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+18:12">Jeremiah 18:12</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>given themselves over</b>—In
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span> it is, "<i>God</i>
	gave them up to uncleanness." Their giving <i>themselves</i> to
	it was punished in kind, <i>God</i> giving them up to it by
	withdrawing His preventing grace; their sin thus was made their
	punishment. They gave themselves up of their own accord to the
	slavery of their lust, to do all its pleasure, as captives who have
	ceased to strive with the foe. <i>God</i> gave them up to it, but not
	against their will; for <i>they</i> give themselves up to it
	[ZANCHIUS]. 
	</p>
<p><b>lasciviousness</b>—"wantonness"
	[ALFORD]. So it is
	translated in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:13">Romans 13:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:18">2 Peter 2:18</span>.
	It does not necessarily include <i>lasciviousness;</i> but it means
	<i>intemperate,</i> reckless readiness for it, and for every
	self-indulgence. "The first beginnings of unchastity"
	[GROTIUS]. "Lawless
	insolence, and wanton caprice" [TRENCH].
	</p>
<p><b>to work all uncleanness</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> implies, "<i>with a deliberate view</i> to the
	working (as if it were their <i>work</i> or <i>business,</i> not a
	mere accidental fall into sin) of uncleanness <i>of every kind.</i>"
	</p>
<p><b>with greediness</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in greediness." <i>Uncleanness</i> and <i>greediness</i>
	of gain often go hand in hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:5">Colossians 3:5</span>);
	though "greediness" here includes <i>all kinds</i> of
	<i>self-seeking.</i></p>
