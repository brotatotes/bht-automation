19. past feeling—senseless,
	shameless, hopeless; the ultimate result of a long process of
	"hardening," or habit of sin ( :-). "Being past hope," or despairing, is the reading
	of the Vulgate; though not so well supported as English
	Version reading, "past feeling," which includes the
	absence of hope (Jeremiah 2:25;
	Jeremiah 18:12). 
	given themselves over—In
	Romans 1:24 it is, "God
	gave them up to uncleanness." Their giving themselves to
	it was punished in kind, God giving them up to it by
	withdrawing His preventing grace; their sin thus was made their
	punishment. They gave themselves up of their own accord to the
	slavery of their lust, to do all its pleasure, as captives who have
	ceased to strive with the foe. God gave them up to it, but not
	against their will; for they give themselves up to it
	[ZANCHIUS]. 
	lasciviousness—"wantonness"
	[ALFORD]. So it is
	translated in Romans 13:13; 2 Peter 2:18.
	It does not necessarily include lasciviousness; but it means
	intemperate, reckless readiness for it, and for every
	self-indulgence. "The first beginnings of unchastity"
	[GROTIUS]. "Lawless
	insolence, and wanton caprice" [TRENCH].
	to work all uncleanness—The
	Greek implies, "with a deliberate view to the
	working (as if it were their work or business, not a
	mere accidental fall into sin) of uncleanness of every kind."
	with greediness—Greek,
	"in greediness." Uncleanness and greediness
	of gain often go hand in hand (Ephesians 5:3;
	Ephesians 5:5; Colossians 3:5);
	though "greediness" here includes all kinds of
	self-seeking.
