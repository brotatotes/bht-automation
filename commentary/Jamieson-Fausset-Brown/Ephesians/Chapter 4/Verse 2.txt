<p><b>2, 3. lowliness</b>—In classic
	<i>Greek,</i> the meaning is <i>meanness of spirit:</i> the Gospel
	has elevated the word to express a Christian grace, namely, the
	esteeming of ourselves small, inasmuch as we are so; the thinking
	truly, and because truly, therefore lowlily, of ourselves [TRENCH].
	</p>
<p><b>meekness</b>—that spirit in
	which we accept God's dealings with us without disputing and
	resisting; and also the accepting patiently of the injuries done us
	by men, out of the thought that they are permitted by God for the
	chastening and purifying of His people (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:1">Galatians 6:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:2">Titus 3:2</span>).
	It is only the <i>lowly,</i> humble heart that is also <i>meek</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>). As "lowliness
	and meekness" answer to "forbearing one another in love"
	(compare "love," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:15">Ephesians 4:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:16">Ephesians 4:16</span>), so "long-suffering"
	answers to (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4">Ephesians 4:4</span>)
	"endeavoring (<i>Greek,</i> '<i>earnestly</i>' or '<i>zealously
	giving diligence</i>') to keep (maintain) the unity of the Spirit
	(the unity between men of different tempers, which flows from the
	presence of the Spirit, who is Himself 'one,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4- :">Ephesians 4:4- :</span>) in (united in) the bond of peace" (the "bond"
	by which "peace" is maintained, namely, "love,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:14">Colossians 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:15">Colossians 3:15</span>
	[BENGEL]; or, "peace"
	itself is the "bond" meant, uniting the members of the
	Church [ALFORD]).</p>
