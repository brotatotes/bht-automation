<p><b>22. That ye</b>—following "Ye
	have been taught" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:21">Ephesians 4:21</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>concerning the former
	conversation</b>—"in respect to your former way of life."
	</p>
<p><b>the old man</b>—your old
	unconverted nature (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>is corrupt according to the
	deceitful lusts</b>—rather, "which is being corrupted
	('perisheth,' compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:8">Galatians 6:8</span>,
	'corruption,' that is, <i>destruction</i>) according to (that is, as
	might be expected from) the lusts of deceit." <i>Deceit</i> is
	personified; <i>lusts</i> are its servants and tools. In contrast to
	"the holiness of the truth," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:8- :">Galatians 6:8- :</span>, and "truth in Jesus," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:8- :">Galatians 6:8- :</span>; and answering to Gentile "vanity," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:8- :">Galatians 6:8- :</span>. Corruption and destruction are inseparably associated
	together. The man's old-nature-lusts are his own executioners,
	fitting him more and more for eternal corruption and death.</p>
