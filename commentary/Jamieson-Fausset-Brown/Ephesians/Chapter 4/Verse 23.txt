<p><b>23. be renewed</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	(<i>ananeousthai</i>) implies "<i>the continued</i> renewal in
	the <i>youth</i> of the new man." A different <i>Greek</i> word
	(<i>anakainousthai</i>) implies "renewal <i>from the old state.</i>"
	</p>
<p><b>in the spirit of your mind</b>—As
	there is no <i>Greek</i> for "in," which there is at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "<i>in</i> the vanity of their mind," it is
	better to translate, "By the Spirit of your mind," that is,
	by your new spiritual nature; the restored and divinely informed
	leading principle of the mind. The "spirit" of man in New
	Testament is only then used in its proper sense, as worthy of its
	place and governing functions, when it is one spirit with the Lord.
	The natural, or animal man, is described as "not having the
	Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:19">Judges 1:19</span>) [ALFORD].
	Spirit is not in this sense attributed to the unregenerate (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:19- :">Judges 1:19- :</span>).</p>
