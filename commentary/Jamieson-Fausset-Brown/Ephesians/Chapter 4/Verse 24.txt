<p><b>24. put on the new man</b>—Opposed
	to "the old man," which is to be "put off" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The <i>Greek</i> here (<i>kainon</i>) is different from
	that for "re-<i>new</i>-ed" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Put on not merely a <i>renovated</i> nature, but a new,
	that is, altogether <i>different</i> nature, a changed nature
	(compare <i>Note,</i>, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>after God,</b> c.—Translate,
	"Which hath been created (once for all: so the <i>Greek</i>
	aorist means: in Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:10">Ephesians 2:10</span>
	so that in each believer it has not to be created again, but to be
	put on) after (the image of) God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:27">Genesis 1:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:15">1 Peter 1:15</span>),
	c. God's image in which the first Adam was originally created, is
	restored, to us far more gloriously in the second Adam, the image of
	the invisible God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>).

<p><b>true holiness</b>—rather,
	as the <i>Greek,</i> "holiness <i>of the truth</i>";
	holiness flowing from sincere following of "the truth of God"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:25">Romans 1:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:7">Romans 3:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8">Romans 15:8</span>): opposed to "the
	lusts <i>of deceit</i>" (<i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:8- :">Romans 15:8- :</span>); compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:21">Ephesians 4:21</span>,
	"truth is in Jesus." "Righteousness" is in
	relation to our fellow men, the second table of the law; "Holiness,"
	in relation to God, the first table; the religious observance of
	offices of piety (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:75">Luke 1:75</span>).
	In the parallel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10">Colossians 3:10</span>) it
	is, "renewed in <i>knowledge</i> after the image," c. As at
	Colosse the danger was from false pretenders to <i>knowledge,</i> the
	true "knowledge" which flows from renewal of the heart is
	dwelt on so at Ephesus, the danger being from the corrupt morals
	prevalent around, the renewal in "holiness," contrasted
	with the Gentile "uncleanness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10- :">Colossians 3:10- :</span>), and "righteousness," in contrast to
	"greediness," is made prominent.</p>
