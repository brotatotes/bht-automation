24. put on the new man—Opposed
	to "the old man," which is to be "put off" ( :-). The Greek here (kainon) is different from
	that for "re-new-ed" ( :-). Put on not merely a renovated nature, but a new,
	that is, altogether different nature, a changed nature
	(compare Note,, see on  :-). 
	after God, c.—Translate,
	"Which hath been created (once for all: so the Greek
	aorist means: in Christ, Ephesians 2:10
	so that in each believer it has not to be created again, but to be
	put on) after (the image of) God" (Genesis 1:27;
	Colossians 3:10; 1 Peter 1:15),
	c. God's image in which the first Adam was originally created, is
	restored, to us far more gloriously in the second Adam, the image of
	the invisible God (2 Corinthians 4:4
Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 1:3).
	in righteousness—"IN"
	it as the element of the renewed man. 
	true holiness—rather,
	as the Greek, "holiness of the truth";
	holiness flowing from sincere following of "the truth of God"
	(Romans 1:25; Romans 3:7;
	Romans 15:8): opposed to "the
	lusts of deceit" (Greek, Romans 15:8- :); compare also Ephesians 4:21,
	"truth is in Jesus." "Righteousness" is in
	relation to our fellow men, the second table of the law; "Holiness,"
	in relation to God, the first table; the religious observance of
	offices of piety (compare Luke 1:75).
	In the parallel (Colossians 3:10) it
	is, "renewed in knowledge after the image," c. As at
	Colosse the danger was from false pretenders to knowledge, the
	true "knowledge" which flows from renewal of the heart is
	dwelt on so at Ephesus, the danger being from the corrupt morals
	prevalent around, the renewal in "holiness," contrasted
	with the Gentile "uncleanness" (Colossians 3:10- :), and "righteousness," in contrast to
	"greediness," is made prominent.
