<p><b>25. Wherefore</b>—From the general
	character of "the new man," there will necessarily result
	the particular features which he now details. 
	</p>
<p><b>putting away</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"having put away" <i>once for all.</i>
</p>
<p><b>lying</b>—"falsehood":
	the abstract. "Speak ye truth each one with his neighbor,"
	is quoted, slightly changed, from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. For "to," Paul quotes it "with," to
	mark our inner connection <i>with</i> one another, as "members
	<i>one of another</i>" [STIER].
	Not merely members <i>of one body.</i> Union to one another in
	Christ, not merely the external command, instinctively leads
	Christians to fulfil mutual duties. One member could not injure or
	deceive another, without injuring himself, as all have a mutual and
	common interest.</p>
