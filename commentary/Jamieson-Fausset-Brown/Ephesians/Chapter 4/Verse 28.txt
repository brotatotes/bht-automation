<p><b>28.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "Let him
	that <i>stealeth.</i>" The imperfect or <i>past</i> tense is,
	however, mainly meant, though not to the exclusion of the present.
	"Let the stealing person steal no more." <i>Bandits</i>
	frequented the mountains near Ephesus. Such are meant by those called
	"thieves" in the New Testament. 
	</p>
<p><b>but rather</b>—For it is
	not enough to cease from a sin, but the sinner must also enter on the
	path that is its very opposite [CHRYSOSTOM].
	The thief, when repentant, should labor more than he would be called
	on to do, if he had never stolen. 
	</p>
<p><b>let him labour</b>—Theft
	and idleness go together. 
	</p>
<p><b>the thing which is good</b>—in
	contrast with theft, the thing which was evil in his past character. 
	</p>
<p><b>with his hands</b>—in
	contrast with his former thievish use of his hands. 
	</p>
<p><b>that he may have to
	give</b>—"that he may have <i>wherewith</i> to <i>impart.</i>"
	He who has stolen should exercise liberality beyond the restitution
	of what he has taken. Christians in general should make not selfish
	gain their aim in honest industry, but the acquisition of the means
	of greater usefulness to their fellow men; and the being independent
	of the alms of others. So Paul himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</span>) acted as he taught (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:8- :">2 Thessalonians 3:8- :</span>).</p>
