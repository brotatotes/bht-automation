<p><b>use of edifying</b>—literally,
	"for edifying of the need," that is, <i>for edifying where
	it is needed.</i> Seasonably edifying according as the occasion and
	present needs of the hearers require, now censure, at another time
	consolation. Even words good in themselves must be introduced
	seasonably lest by our fault they prove injurious instead of useful.
	TRENCH explains, Not vague
	generalities, which would suit a thousand other cases equally well,
	and probably equally ill: our words should be as nails fastened in a
	sure place, words suiting the present time and the present person,
	being "for the edifying of the occasion" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
