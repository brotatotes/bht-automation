<p><b>30. grieve not</b>—A condescension
	to human modes of thought most touching. Compare "<i>vexed</i>
	His Holy Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:10">Isaiah 63:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+78:40">Psalms 78:40</span>); "fretted me"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:43">Ezekiel 16:43</span>: implying His
	tender love to us); and of hardened unbelievers, "resist the
	Holy Ghost" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:51">Acts 7:51</span>).
	This verse refers to <i>believers,</i> who grieve the Spirit by
	inconsistencies such as in the context are spoken of, corrupt or
	worthless conversation, c. 
	</p>
<p><b>whereby ye are sealed</b>—rather,
	"wherein (or 'in whom') ye <i>were</i> sealed." As in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:51- :">Acts 7:51- :</span>, believers are said to be sealed "<i>in</i>"
	<i>Christ,</i> so here "in <i>the Holy Spirit,</i>" who is
	one with Christ, and who reveals Christ in the soul: the <i>Greek</i>
	implies that the sealing was done already once for all. It is the
	<i>Father</i> "BY"
	whom believers, as well as the Son Himself, were sealed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:51- :">Acts 7:51- :</span>). The Spirit is represented as itself the <i>seal</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:51- :">Acts 7:51- :</span>, for the image employed, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:51- :">Acts 7:51- :</span>). Here the Spirit <i>is the element</i> IN
	<i>which</i> the believer is sealed, His gracious influences being
	the seal itself. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto</b>—kept safely
	against the day of redemption, namely, of the <i>completion</i> of
	redemption in the deliverance of the body as well as the soul from
	all sin and sorrow (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:14">Ephesians 1:14</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28">Luke 21:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>).</p>
