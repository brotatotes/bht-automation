	Colossians 3:12).

	Himself "kind, tender-hearted, and forgiving to you"; it is
	but just that you in turn shall be so to your fellow men, who have
	not erred against you in the degree that you have erred against God
	(Matthew 18:33). 
	God for Christ's sake—rather
	as Greek, "God in Christ" (Matthew 18:33- :). It is in Christ that God vouchsafes forgiveness to
	us. It cost God the death of His Son, as man, to forgive us. It costs
	us nothing to forgive our fellow man. 
	hath forgiven—rather as
	Greek, "forgave you." God has, once for
	all, forgiven sin in Christ, as a past historical fact.
