<p><b>even as</b>—God hath shown
	Himself "kind, tender-hearted, and forgiving to you"; it is
	but just that you in turn shall be so to your fellow men, who have
	not erred against you in the degree that you have erred against God

<p><b>God for Christ's sake</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "God in Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:33- :">Matthew 18:33- :</span>). It is <i>in Christ</i> that God vouchsafes forgiveness to
	us. It cost God the death of His Son, as man, to forgive us. It costs
	us nothing to forgive our fellow man. 
	</p>
<p><b>hath forgiven</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>forgave</i> you." God has, <i>once for
	all,</i> forgiven sin in Christ, as a <i>past historical fact.</i></p>
