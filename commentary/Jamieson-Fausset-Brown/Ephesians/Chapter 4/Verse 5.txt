5. Similarly "faith"
	and "baptism" (the sacramental seal of faith) are connected
	(Mark 16:16; Colossians 2:12).
	Compare 1 Corinthians 12:13, "Faith"
	is not here that which we believe, but the act of believing,
	the mean by which we apprehend the "one Lord." "Baptism"
	is specified, being the sacrament whereby we are incorporated
	into the "one body." Not the Lord's Supper, which is an act
	of matured communion on the part of those already incorporate, "a
	symbol of union, not of unity" [ELLICOTT].
	In 1 Corinthians 10:17, where a breach
	of union was in question, it forms the rallying point [ALFORD].
	There is not added, "One pope, one council, one form of
	government" [Cautions for Times]. The Church is one in
	unity of faith (Ephesians 4:5;
	Judges 1:3); unity of origination
	(Ephesians 2:19-21): unity
	of sacraments (Ephesians 4:5;
	1 Corinthians 10:17; 1 Corinthians 12:13):
	unity of "hope" (Ephesians 4:4;
	Titus 1:2); unity of charity
	(Ephesians 4:3): unity (not
	uniformity) of discipline and government: for where there
	is no order, no ministry with Christ as the Head, there is no Church
	[PEARSON, Exposition of
	the Creed, Article IX].
