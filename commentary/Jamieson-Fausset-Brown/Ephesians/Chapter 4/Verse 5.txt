<p><b>5.</b> Similarly "faith"
	and "baptism" (the sacramental seal of faith) are connected
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:16">Mark 16:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>).
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span>, "Faith"
	is not here <i>that which we believe,</i> but the act of <i>believing,</i>
	the mean by which we apprehend the "one Lord." "Baptism"
	is specified, being the sacrament whereby we are <i>incorporated</i>
	into the "one body." Not the Lord's Supper, which is an act
	of matured communion on the part of those already incorporate, "a
	symbol of <i>union,</i> not of <i>unity</i>" [ELLICOTT].
	In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:17">1 Corinthians 10:17</span>, where a breach
	of union was in question, it forms the rallying point [ALFORD].
	There is not added, "One pope, one council, one form of
	government" [<i>Cautions for Times</i>]. The Church is one in
	<i>unity of faith</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:5">Ephesians 4:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:3">Judges 1:3</span>); <i>unity of origination</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19-21">Ephesians 2:19-21</span>): <i>unity
	of sacraments</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:5">Ephesians 4:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:17">1 Corinthians 10:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span>):

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:2">Titus 1:2</span>); <i>unity of charity</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>): <i>unity</i> (<i>not
	uniformity</i>) <i>of discipline and government:</i> for where there
	is no order, no ministry with Christ as the Head, there is no Church
	[PEARSON, <i>Exposition of
	the Creed,</i> Article IX].</p>
