<p><b>6. above</b>—"<i>over</i>
	all." The "one God over all" (in His sovereignty and
	by His grace) is the grand source and crowning apex of unity (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, end). 
	</p>
<p><b>through all</b>—by means of
	Christ "who filleth all things" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:10">Ephesians 4:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:20">Ephesians 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21">Ephesians 2:21</span>),
	and is "a propitiation" for all men (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:21- :">Ephesians 2:21- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in you all</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts omit "you." Many of the oldest versions and
	Fathers and old manuscripts read, "in <i>us</i> all."
	Whether the pronoun be read or not, it must be understood (either
	from the "ye," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4">Ephesians 4:4</span>,
	or from the "us," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4- :">Ephesians 4:4- :</span>); for other parts of Scripture prove that the Spirit is not
	"in all" men, but only in believers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:9">Romans 8:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:14">Romans 8:14</span>). God is "Father"
	both by generation (as Creator) and regeneration (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:10">Ephesians 2:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:17">James 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>;
