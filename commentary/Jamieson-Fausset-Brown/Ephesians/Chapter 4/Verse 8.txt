<p><b>8. Wherefore</b>—"For which
	reason," namely, in order to intimate that Christ, the Head of
	the Church, is the author of all these different gifts, and that
	giving of them is an act of His "grace" [ESTIUS].
	</p>
<p><b>he saith</b>—God, whose
	word the Scripture is (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:18">Psalms 68:18</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>When he ascended</b>—GOD
	is meant in the Psalm, represented by the ark, which was being
	brought up to Zion in triumph by David, after that "the Lord had
	given him rest round about from all his enemies" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+6:1-7">2 Samuel 6:1-7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+15:1-29">1 Chronicles 15:1-29</span>). Paul quotes
	it of CHRIST ascending to
	heaven, who is therefore GOD.
	</p>
<p><b>captivity</b>—that is, a
	band of captives. In the Psalm, the captive foes of David. In the
	antitypical meaning, the foes of Christ the Son of David, the devil,
	death, the curse, and sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:15">Colossians 2:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span>), led as it were in
	triumphal procession as a sign of the destruction of the foe. 
	</p>
<p><b>gave gifts unto men</b>—in
	the Psalm, "<i>received</i> gifts <i>for</i> men," <i>Hebrew,</i>
	"among men," that is, "thou hast received gifts"
	<i>to distribute among</i> men. As a conqueror distributes in token
	of his triumph the spoils of foes as gifts among his people. The
	impartation of the gifts and graces of the Spirit depended on
	Christ's ascension (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:12">John 14:12</span>). Paul stops short in
	the middle of the verse, and does not quote "that the Lord God
	might dwell <i>among them.</i>" This, it is true, is partly
	fulfilled in Christians being an "habitation of God through the
	Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:22">Ephesians 2:22</span>). But
	the Psalm (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:16">Psalms 68:16</span>) refers to
	"the Lord dwelling in Zion <i>for ever</i>"; the ascension
	amidst attendant angels, having as its counterpart the second advent
	amidst "thousands of angels" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:16- :">Psalms 68:16- :</span>), accompanied by the restoration of Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:16- :">Psalms 68:16- :</span>), the destruction of God's enemies and the resurrection
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:20">Psalms 68:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:21">Psalms 68:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:23">Psalms 68:23</span>), the conversion of the
	kingdoms of the world to the Lord at Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:23- :">Psalms 68:23- :</span>).</p>
