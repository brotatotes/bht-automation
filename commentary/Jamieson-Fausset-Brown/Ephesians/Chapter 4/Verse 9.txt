9. Paul reasons that (assuming
	Him to be God) His ascent implies a previous descent;
	and that the language of the Psalm can only refer to Christ,
	who first descended, then ascended. For God the Father does not
	ascend or descend. Yet the Psalm plainly refers to God
	(Ephesians 4:8; Ephesians 4:17;
	Ephesians 4:18). It must therefore be
	GOD THE SON
	(John 6:33; John 6:62).
	As He declares (John 3:13), "No
	man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from
	heaven." Others, though they did not previously descend,
	have ascended; but none save Christ can be referred to in the
	Psalm as having done so; for it is of God it speaks. 
	lower parts of the earthâ€”The
	antithesis or contrast to "far above all heavens," is the
	argument of ALFORD and
	others, to show that this phrase means more than simply the earth,
	namely, the regions beneath it, even as He ascended not merely
	to the visible heavens, but "far above" them. Moreover, His
	design "that He might fill all things" (John 3:13- :, Greek, "the whole universe of things") may
	imply the same. But see on Ephesians 4:10
	on those words. Also the leading "captive" of the "captive
	hand" ("captivity") of satanic powers, may imply that
	the warfare reached to their habitation itself (Ephesians 4:10- :). Christ, as Lord of all, took possession first of the earth
	the unseen world beneath it (some conjecture that the region of the
	lost is in the central parts of our globe), then of heaven (Acts 2:27;
	Acts 2:28). However, all we surely
	know is, that His soul at death descended to Hades, that is,
	underwent the ordinary condition of departed spirits of men. The
	leading captive of satanic powers here, is not said to be at His
	descent, but at His ascension; so that no argument can be
	drawn from it for a descent to the abodes of Satan. Acts 2:27;
	Acts 2:28, favor the view of the
	reference being simply to His descent to Hades. So PEARSON
	in Exposition of the Creed (Acts 2:28- :).
