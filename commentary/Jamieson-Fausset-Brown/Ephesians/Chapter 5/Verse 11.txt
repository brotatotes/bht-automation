11. unfruitful works of
	darkness—Sins are terminated in themselves, and therefore are
	called "works," not "fruits" (Galatians 5:19;
	Galatians 5:22). Their only fruit is
	that which is not in a true sense fruit (Galatians 5:22- :), namely, "death" (Romans 6:21;
	Galatians 6:8). Plants cannot bear
	"fruit" in the absence of light. Sin is "darkness,"
	and its parent is the prince of darkness (Galatians 6:8- :). Graces, on the other hand, as flourishing in "the
	light," are reproductive, and abound in fruits; which, as
	harmoniously combining in one whole, are termed (in the
	singular) "the FRUIT
	of the Spirit" (Ephesians 5:9). 
	rather, c.—Translate as
	Greek, "rather even reprove them" (compare Ephesians 5:9- :). Not only "have no fellowship, but even
	reprove them," namely, in words, and in your deeds, which,
	shining with "the light," virtually reprove all that is
	contrary to light (Ephesians 5:13
John 3:19-21). "Have no
	fellowship," does not imply that we can avoid all intercourse
	(1 Corinthians 5:10), but "avoid
	such fellowship as will defile yourselves"; just as light,
	though it touch filth, is not soiled by it; nay, as light detects
	it, so, "even reprove sin."
