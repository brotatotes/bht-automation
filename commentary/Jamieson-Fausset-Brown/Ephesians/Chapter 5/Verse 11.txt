<p><b>11. unfruitful works of
	darkness</b>—Sins are terminated in themselves, and therefore are
	called "works," not "fruits" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:19">Galatians 5:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>). Their only fruit is
	that which is not in a true sense fruit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22- :">Galatians 5:22- :</span>), namely, "death" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:21">Romans 6:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:8">Galatians 6:8</span>). Plants cannot bear
	"fruit" in the absence of light. Sin is "darkness,"
	and its parent is <i>the prince of darkness</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:8- :">Galatians 6:8- :</span>). Graces, on the other hand, as flourishing in "the
	light," are reproductive, and abound in fruits; which, as
	harmoniously combining in <i>one</i> whole, are termed (in the
	singular) "the FRUIT
	of the Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:9">Ephesians 5:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>rather,</b> c.—Translate as
	<i>Greek,</i> "rather <i>even</i> reprove them" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:9- :">Ephesians 5:9- :</span>). Not only "have no fellowship, but <i>even</i>
	reprove them," namely, in words, and in your deeds, which,
	shining with "the light," virtually reprove all that is
	contrary to light (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:13">Ephesians 5:13</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19-21">John 3:19-21</span>). "Have no
	fellowship," does not imply that we can avoid all intercourse
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:10">1 Corinthians 5:10</span>), but "avoid
	such fellowship as will defile yourselves"; just as light,
	though it touch filth, is not soiled by it; nay, as light <i>detects</i>
	it, so, "even <i>reprove</i> sin."</p>
