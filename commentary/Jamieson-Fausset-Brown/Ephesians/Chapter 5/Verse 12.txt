<p><b>12.</b> The <i>Greek</i> order is,
	"For the things done in secret by them, it is a shame even to
	speak of." The "for" gives his reason for "not
	naming" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>)
	in detail the works of darkness, whereas he describes definitely (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3- :">Ephesians 5:3- :</span>) "the fruit of the light" [BENGEL].
	"Speak of," I think, is used here as "speaking of
	<i>without reproving,</i>" in contrast to "even reprove
	them." Thus the "for" expresses this, Reprove them,
	for to <i>speak</i> of them <i>without reproving</i> them, is a shame
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>). Thus "works of
	<i>darkness</i>" answers to "things done <i>in secret.</i>"</p>
