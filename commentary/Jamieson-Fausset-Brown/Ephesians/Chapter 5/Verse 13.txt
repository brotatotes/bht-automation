	'reproving,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:11">Ephesians 5:11</span>) is
	(thenceforth no longer 'darkness,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:11- :">Ephesians 5:11- :</span>, but) light." The devil and the wicked will not suffer
	themselves to be made manifest by the light, but love darkness,
	though <i>outwardly</i> the light shines round them. Therefore,
	"light" has no transforming effect on <i>them,</i> so that
	they do not become light (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:19">John 3:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20">John 3:20</span>). But, says the apostle,
	you being now light yourselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20- :">John 3:20- :</span>), by bringing to light through reproof those who are in
	darkness, will convert them to light. Your consistent lives and
	faithful reproofs will be your "armor of light" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:20- :">John 3:20- :</span>) in making an inroad on the kingdom of darkness.</p>
