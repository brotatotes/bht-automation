<p><b>14. Wherefore</b>—referring to the
	whole foregoing argument (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:8">Ephesians 5:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:11">Ephesians 5:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:13">Ephesians 5:13</span>).
	Seeing that light (spiritual) dispels the pre-existing darkness, He
	(God) saith . . . (compare the same phrase, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:13- :">Ephesians 5:13- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Awake</b>—The reading of
	all the oldest manuscripts is "Up!" or, "Rouse thee!"
	a phrase used in stirring men to activity. The words are a paraphrase
	of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:1">Isaiah 60:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:2">Isaiah 60:2</span>,
	not an exact quotation. The word "Christ," shows that in
	quoting the prophecy, he views it in the light thrown on it by its
	<i>Gospel fulfilment.</i> As Israel is called on to "awake"
	from its previous state of "darkness" and "death"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:10">Isaiah 59:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+60:2">Isaiah 60:2</span>),
	for that her Light is come; so the Church, and each individual is
	similarly called to awake. <i>Believers</i> are called on to "awake"
	out of <i>sleep; unbelievers,</i> to "arise" from the <i>dead</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:5">Matthew 25:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:11">Romans 13:11</span>;

<p><b>Christ</b>—"the true
	light," "the Sun of righteousness." 
	</p>
<p><b>give thee light</b>—rather,
	as <i>Greek,</i> "shall shine upon thee" (so enabling thee
	by being "made manifest" to become, and be, by the very
	fact, "light," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:13">Ephesians 5:13</span>;
	then being so "enlightened," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:13- :">Ephesians 5:13- :</span>, thou shalt be able, by "reproving," to enlighten
	others).</p>
