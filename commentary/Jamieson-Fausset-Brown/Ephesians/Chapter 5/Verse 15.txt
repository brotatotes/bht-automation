<p><b>15. that</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"See <i>how</i> ye walk," &amp;c. The double idea is
	compressed into one sentence: "See (take heed) <i>how</i> ye
	walk," and "See <i>that</i> ye walk circumspectly."
	The <i>manner,</i> as well as the <i>act</i> itself, is included. See
	<i>how</i> ye are walking, with a view to your <i>being</i>
	circumspect (literally, <i>accurate, exact</i>) in your walk. Compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>, "Walk in <i>wisdom</i>
	(answering to 'as wise' here) toward them that are without"
	(answering to "circumspectly," that is, <i>correctly, in
	relation to the unbelievers around,</i> not giving occasion of
	stumbling to any, but edifying all by a consistent walk). 
	</p>
<p><b>not as fools</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"not as unwise, but as wise."</p>
