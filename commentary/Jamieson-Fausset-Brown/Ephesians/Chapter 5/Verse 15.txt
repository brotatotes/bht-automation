15. that—rather as Greek,
	"See how ye walk," &c. The double idea is
	compressed into one sentence: "See (take heed) how ye
	walk," and "See that ye walk circumspectly."
	The manner, as well as the act itself, is included. See
	how ye are walking, with a view to your being
	circumspect (literally, accurate, exact) in your walk. Compare
	Colossians 4:5, "Walk in wisdom
	(answering to 'as wise' here) toward them that are without"
	(answering to "circumspectly," that is, correctly, in
	relation to the unbelievers around, not giving occasion of
	stumbling to any, but edifying all by a consistent walk). 
	not as fools—Greek,
	"not as unwise, but as wise."
