<p><b>16. Redeeming the time</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>Greek,</i> "Buying up for yourselves the seasonable
	time" (whenever it occurs) of good to yourselves and to others.
	Buying <i>off from</i> the vanities of "them that are without"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:5">Colossians 4:5</span>), and of the "unwise"
	(here in Ephesians), the opportune time afforded to you for the work
	of God. In a narrower sense, <i>special favorable seasons for good,</i>
	occasionally presenting themselves, are referred to, of which
	believers ought diligently to avail themselves. This constitutes true
	"wisdom" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:15">Ephesians 5:15</span>).
	In a larger sense, <i>the whole season from the time that one is
	spiritually awakened,</i> is to be "redeemed" from vanity
	for God (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:2">2 Corinthians 6:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:2-4">1 Peter 4:2-4</span>). "Redeem"
	implies the preciousness of the opportune season, a jewel to be
	bought at any price. WAHL
	explains, "Redeeming for yourselves (that is, availing
	yourselves of) the opportunity (offered you of acting aright), and
	commanding the time as a master does his servant." TITTMANN,
	"Watch the time, and make it your own so as to control it; as
	merchants look out for opportunities, and accurately choose out the
	best goods; serve not the time, but command it, and it shall do what
	you approve." So PINDAR
	[<i>Pythia,</i> 4.509], "The time followed him as his servant,
	and was not as a runaway slave."

<p><b>because the days are evil</b>—The
	days of life in general are so exposed to evil, as to make it
	necessary to make the most of the seasonable opportunity so long as
	it lasts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:9">Genesis 47:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+49:5">Psalms 49:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+11:2">Ecclesiastes 11:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+12:1">Ecclesiastes 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35">John 12:35</span>).
	Besides, there are many <i>special</i> evil days (in persecution,
	sickness, c.) when the Christian is laid by in silence therefore he
	needs the more to improve the seasonable times afforded to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:35- :">John 12:35- :</span>), which Paul perhaps alludes to.</p>
