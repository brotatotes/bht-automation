16. Redeeming the time— ( :-). Greek, "Buying up for yourselves the seasonable
	time" (whenever it occurs) of good to yourselves and to others.
	Buying off from the vanities of "them that are without"
	(Colossians 4:5), and of the "unwise"
	(here in Ephesians), the opportune time afforded to you for the work
	of God. In a narrower sense, special favorable seasons for good,
	occasionally presenting themselves, are referred to, of which
	believers ought diligently to avail themselves. This constitutes true
	"wisdom" (Ephesians 5:15).
	In a larger sense, the whole season from the time that one is
	spiritually awakened, is to be "redeemed" from vanity
	for God (compare 2 Corinthians 6:2;
	1 Peter 4:2-4). "Redeem"
	implies the preciousness of the opportune season, a jewel to be
	bought at any price. WAHL
	explains, "Redeeming for yourselves (that is, availing
	yourselves of) the opportunity (offered you of acting aright), and
	commanding the time as a master does his servant." TITTMANN,
	"Watch the time, and make it your own so as to control it; as
	merchants look out for opportunities, and accurately choose out the
	best goods; serve not the time, but command it, and it shall do what
	you approve." So PINDAR
	[Pythia, 4.509], "The time followed him as his servant,
	and was not as a runaway slave." 
	because the days are evil—The
	days of life in general are so exposed to evil, as to make it
	necessary to make the most of the seasonable opportunity so long as
	it lasts (Ephesians 6:13; Genesis 47:9;
	Psalms 49:5; Ecclesiastes 11:2;
	Ecclesiastes 12:1; John 12:35).
	Besides, there are many special evil days (in persecution,
	sickness, c.) when the Christian is laid by in silence therefore he
	needs the more to improve the seasonable times afforded to him (John 12:35- :), which Paul perhaps alludes to.
