17. Wherefore—seeing that ye
	need to walk so circumspectly, choosing and using the right
	opportunity of good. 
	unwise—a different
	Greek word from that in  :-. Translate, "foolish," or "senseless." 
	understanding—not
	merely knowing as a matter of fact ( :-), but knowing with understanding.
the will of the Lord—as
	to how each opportunity is to be used. The Lord's will, ultimately,
	is our "sanctification" ( :-); and that "in every thing," meantime, we should
	"give thanks" (1 Thessalonians 5:18;
	compare above, Ephesians 5:10).
