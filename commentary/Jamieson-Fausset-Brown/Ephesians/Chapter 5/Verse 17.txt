<p><b>17. Wherefore</b>—seeing that ye
	need to walk so circumspectly, choosing and using the right
	opportunity of good. 
	</p>
<p><b>unwise</b>—a different
	<i>Greek</i> word from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Translate, "foolish," or "senseless." 
	</p>
<p><b>understanding</b>—not
	merely <i>knowing</i> as a matter of fact (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), but <i>knowing with understanding.</i>
</p>
<p><b>the will of the Lord</b>—as
	to how each opportunity is to be used. The Lord's will, ultimately,
	is our "sanctification" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); and that "in every thing," meantime, we should
	"give thanks" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:18">1 Thessalonians 5:18</span>;
	compare above, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:10">Ephesians 5:10</span>).</p>
