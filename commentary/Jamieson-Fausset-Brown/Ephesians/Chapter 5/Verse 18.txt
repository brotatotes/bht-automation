<p><b>but be filled with the
	Spirit</b>—The effect in inspiration was that the person was
	"filled" with an ecstatic exhilaration, like that caused by
	wine; hence the two are here connected (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:23- :">1 Timothy 5:23- :</span>). Hence arose the abstinence from wine of many of the
	prophets, for example, John the Baptist, namely, in order to keep
	distinct before the world the ecstasy caused by the Spirit, from that
	caused by wine. So also in ordinary Christians the Spirit dwells not
	in the mind that seeks the disturbing influences of excitement, but
	in the well-balanced prayerful mind. Such a one expresses his joy,
	not in drunken or worldly songs, but in Christian hymns of
	thankfulness.</p>
