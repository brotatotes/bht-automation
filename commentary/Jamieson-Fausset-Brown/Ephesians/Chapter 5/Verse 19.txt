<p><b>to yourselves</b>—"to
	one another." Hence soon arose the antiphonal or responsive
	chanting of which PLINY
	writes to Trajan: "They are wont on a fixed day to meet before
	daylight [to avoid persecution] and to recite a hymn <i>among
	themselves by turns,</i> to Christ, as if being God." The Spirit
	gives true eloquence; wine, a spurious eloquence.

<p><b>psalms</b>—generally
	accompanied by an instrument.

<p><b>hymns</b>—in direct praise
	to God (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:25">Acts 16:25</span>;

	accompanying the singing of the lips (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+14:15">1 Corinthians 14:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+47:7">Psalms 47:7</span>). The contrast is
	between the heathen and the Christian practice, "Let your songs
	be not the drinking songs of heathen feasts, but psalms and hymns;
	and their accompaniment, <i>not the music of the lyre, but the melody
	of the heart</i>" [CONYBEARE
