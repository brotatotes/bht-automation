<p><b>walk in love</b>—resuming
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1">Ephesians 4:1</span>, "<i>walk</i>
	worthy of the vocation." 
	</p>
<p><b>as Christ . . . loved us</b>—From
	the love of the Father he passes to the love of the Son, in whom God
	most endearingly manifests His love to us. 
	</p>
<p><b>given himself for us</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"given Himself <i>up</i> (namely, to death, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:1- :">Ephesians 4:1- :</span>) for us," that is, <i>in our behalf:</i> not here
	vicarious substitution, though that is <i>indirectly</i> implied, "in
	<i>our</i> stead." The offerer, and the offering that He
	offered, were one and the same (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:13">John 15:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8">Romans 5:8</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>offering and a
	sacrifice</b>—"Offering" expresses <i>generally</i> His
	presenting Himself to the Father, as the Representative undertaking
	the cause of the whole of our lost race (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8- :">Romans 5:8- :</span>), including His <i>life</i> of obedience; though not
	excluding His offering of His body for us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8- :">Romans 5:8- :</span>). It is usually an <i>unbloody offering,</i> in the more
	limited sense. "Sacrifice" refers to His <i>death</i> for
	us exclusively. Christ is here, in reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8- :">Romans 5:8- :</span> (quoted again in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:8- :">Romans 5:8- :</span>), represented as the antitype of all the offerings of the
	law, whether the unbloody or bloody, eucharistical or propitiatory. 
	</p>
<p><b>for a sweet-smelling
	savour</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "for an odor of a sweet smell,"
	that is, God is well pleased with the offering on the ground of its
	sweetness,and so is reconciled to us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:17">Matthew 3:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:18">2 Corinthians 5:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:6-17">Hebrews 10:6-17</span>).
	The ointment compounded of principal spices, poured upon Aaron's
	head, answers to the variety of the graces by which He was enabled to
	"offer Himself a sacrifice for a sweet-smelling savor."
	Another type, or prophecy by figure, was "the sweet savor"
	("<i>savor of rest,</i>" <i>Margin</i>) which God smelled
	in Noah's sacrifice (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+8:21">Genesis 8:21</span>).
	Again, as what Christ is, believers also are (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+8:21- :">Genesis 8:21- :</span>), and ministers are: Paul says (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+8:21- :">Genesis 8:21- :</span>) "we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ."</p>
