2. And—in proof that you are
	so. 
	walk in love—resuming
	Ephesians 4:1, "walk
	worthy of the vocation." 
	as Christ . . . loved us—From
	the love of the Father he passes to the love of the Son, in whom God
	most endearingly manifests His love to us. 
	given himself for us—Greek,
	"given Himself up (namely, to death, Ephesians 4:1- :) for us," that is, in our behalf: not here
	vicarious substitution, though that is indirectly implied, "in
	our stead." The offerer, and the offering that He
	offered, were one and the same (John 15:13;
	Romans 5:8). 
	offering and a
	sacrifice—"Offering" expresses generally His
	presenting Himself to the Father, as the Representative undertaking
	the cause of the whole of our lost race (Romans 5:8- :), including His life of obedience; though not
	excluding His offering of His body for us (Romans 5:8- :). It is usually an unbloody offering, in the more
	limited sense. "Sacrifice" refers to His death for
	us exclusively. Christ is here, in reference to Romans 5:8- : (quoted again in Romans 5:8- :), represented as the antitype of all the offerings of the
	law, whether the unbloody or bloody, eucharistical or propitiatory. 
	for a sweet-smelling
	savour—Greek, "for an odor of a sweet smell,"
	that is, God is well pleased with the offering on the ground of its
	sweetness,and so is reconciled to us (Ephesians 1:6;
	Matthew 3:17; 2 Corinthians 5:18;
	2 Corinthians 5:19; Hebrews 10:6-17).
	The ointment compounded of principal spices, poured upon Aaron's
	head, answers to the variety of the graces by which He was enabled to
	"offer Himself a sacrifice for a sweet-smelling savor."
	Another type, or prophecy by figure, was "the sweet savor"
	("savor of rest," Margin) which God smelled
	in Noah's sacrifice (Genesis 8:21).
	Again, as what Christ is, believers also are (Genesis 8:21- :), and ministers are: Paul says (Genesis 8:21- :) "we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ."
