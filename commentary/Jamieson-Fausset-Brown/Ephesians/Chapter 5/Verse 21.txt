21. (Philippians 2:3;
	1 Peter 5:5.) Here he passes from our
	relations to God, to those which concern our fellow men. 
	in the fear of Godâ€”All
	the oldest manuscripts and authorities read, "in the fear of
	CHRIST." The believer
	passes from under the bondage of the law as a letter, to be "the
	servant of Christ" (1 Peter 5:5- :), which, through the instinct of love to Him, is really to
	be "the Lord's freeman"; for he is "under the law to
	Christ" (1 Corinthians 9:21;
	compare John 8:36). Christ, not
	the Father (John 5:22), is to be
	our judge. Thus reverential fear of displeasing Him is the motive for
	discharging our relative duties as Christians (1 Corinthians 10:22;
	2 Corinthians 5:11; 1 Peter 2:13).
