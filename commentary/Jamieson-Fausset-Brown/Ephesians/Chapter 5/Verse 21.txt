<p><b>in the fear of God</b>â€”All
	the oldest manuscripts and authorities read, "in the fear of
	CHRIST." The believer
	passes from under the bondage of the law as a letter, to be "the
	servant of <i>Christ</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:5- :">1 Peter 5:5- :</span>), which, through the instinct of love to Him, is really to
	be "the Lord's freeman"; for he is "under the law to
	<i>Christ</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:21">1 Corinthians 9:21</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:36">John 8:36</span>). Christ, not
	the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:22">John 5:22</span>), is to be
	our judge. Thus reverential fear of displeasing Him is the motive for
	discharging our relative duties as Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:22">1 Corinthians 10:22</span>;
