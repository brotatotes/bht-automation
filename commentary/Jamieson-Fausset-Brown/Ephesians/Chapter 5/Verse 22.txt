22. ( :-.) The Church's relation to Christ in His everlasting purpose,
	is the foundation and archetype of the three greatest of earthly
	relations, that of husband and wife ( :-), parent and child ( :-), master and servant ( :-). The oldest manuscripts omit "submit yourselves";
	supplying it from Ephesians 5:21, "Ye
	wives (submitting yourselves) unto your own husbands." "Your
	own" is an argument for submissiveness on the part of the wives;
	it is not a stranger, but your own husbands whom you are
	called on to submit unto (compare Genesis 3:16;
	1 Corinthians 7:2; 1 Corinthians 14:34;
	Colossians 3:18; Titus 2:5;
	1 Peter 3:1-7). Those subject
	ought to submit themselves, of whatever kind their superiors are.
	"Submit" is the term used of wives: "obey,"
	of children (Ephesians 6:1), as
	there is a greater equality between wives and husbands, than between
	children and parents. 
	as unto the
	Lordâ€”Submissiveness is rendered by the wife to the husband
	under the eye of Christ, and so is rendered to Christ Himself. The
	husband stands to the wife in the relation that the Lord does to the
	Church, and this is to be the ground of her submission: though that
	submission is inferior in kind and degree to that which she owes
	Christ (Ephesians 5:24).
