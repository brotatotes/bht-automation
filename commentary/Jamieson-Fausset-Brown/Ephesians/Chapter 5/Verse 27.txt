<p><b>27. he</b>—The oldest manuscripts
	and authorities read, "That He might <i>Himself</i> present unto
	Himself the Church glorious," namely, as a bride (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>Holiness</i> and <i>glory</i> are inseparable.
	"Cleansing" is the necessary preliminary to both. <i>Holiness</i>
	is <i>glory</i> internal; <i>glory</i> is <i>holiness</i> shining
	forth outwardly. <i>The laver of</i> baptism is the vehicle, but <i>the
	word</i> is the nobler and true instrument of the <i>cleansing</i>
	[BENGEL]. It is Christ
	that prepares the Church with the necessary ornaments of grace, for
	presentation to Himself, as the Bridegroom at His coming again
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1">Matthew 25:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>not having spot</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2- :">Revelation 21:2- :</span>). The visible Church now contains clean and unclean together,
	like Noah's ark; like the wedding room which contained some that had,
	and others that had not, the wedding garment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2- :">Revelation 21:2- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:20">2 Timothy 2:20</span>);
	or as the good and bad fish are taken in the same net because it
	cannot discern the bad from the good, the fishermen being unable to
	know what kind of fish the nets have taken under the waves. Still the
	Church is termed "holy" in the creed, in reference to her
	ideal and ultimate destination. When the Bridegroom comes, the bride
	shall be presented to Him wholly without spot, the evil being cut off
	from the body for ever (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:20- :">2 Timothy 2:20- :</span>). Not that there are two churches, one with bad and good
	intermingled, another in which there are good alone; but one and the
	same Church in relation to different times, now with good and evil
	together, hereafter with good alone [PEARSON].</p>
