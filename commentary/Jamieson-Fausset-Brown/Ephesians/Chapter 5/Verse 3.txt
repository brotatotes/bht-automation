3. once namedâ€”Greek,
	"Let it not be even named" (Ephesians 5:4;
	Ephesians 5:12). "Uncleanness"
	and "covetousness" are taken up again from Ephesians 5:12- :. The two are so closely allied that the Greek for
	"covetousness" (pleonexia) is used sometimes in
	Scripture, and often in the Greek Fathers, for sins of
	impurity. The common principle is the longing to fill one's desire
	with material objects of sense, outside of God. The expression, "not
	be even named," applies better to impurity, than to
	"covetousness."
