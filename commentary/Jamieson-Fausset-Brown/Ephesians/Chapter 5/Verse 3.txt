<p><b>3. once named</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"Let it not be even named" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:4">Ephesians 5:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:12">Ephesians 5:12</span>). "Uncleanness"
	and "covetousness" are taken up again from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:12- :">Ephesians 5:12- :</span>. The two are so closely allied that the <i>Greek</i> for
	"covetousness" (<i>pleonexia</i>) is used sometimes in
	Scripture, and often in the <i>Greek</i> Fathers, for sins of
	impurity. The common principle is the longing to fill one's desire
	with material objects of sense, outside of God. The expression, "not
	be even named," applies better to impurity, than to
	"covetousness."</p>
