	"Because" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:15">1 Corinthians 6:15</span>).
	Christ nourisheth and cherisheth the Church as being of one flesh
	with Him. Translate, "Because we are members of His body (His
	literal body), <i>being</i> OF
	His flesh and of His bones" [ALFORD]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:23">Genesis 2:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span>).
	The <i>Greek</i> expresses, "Being formed <i>out of</i>" or
	"of the substance of His flesh." Adam's deep sleep, wherein
	Eve was formed from out of his opened side, is an emblem of Christ's
	death, which was the birth of the Spouse, the Church. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:24">John 12:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:34">John 19:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:35">John 19:35</span>,
	to which <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25-27">Ephesians 5:25-27</span>
	allude, as implying atonement by His <i>blood,</i> and sanctification
	by the "water," answering to that which flowed from His
	side (compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:38">John 7:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:39">John 7:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>).
	As Adam gave Eve a new name, <i>Hebrew,</i> "<i>Isha,</i>"
	"woman," formed from his own rib, <i>Ish,</i> "man,"
	signifying her formation from him, so Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:21">Genesis 2:21</span>;

	puts the <i>bones</i> first because the reference there is to the
	<i>natural</i> structure. But Paul is referring to the <i>flesh of
	Christ.</i> It is not our bones and flesh, but "<i>we</i>"
	that are <i>spiritually</i> propagated (in our soul and spirit now,
	and in the body hereafter, regenerated) from the manhood of Christ
	which has flesh and bones. We are members of His glorified body (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24- :">Genesis 2:24- :</span>). The two oldest existing manuscripts, and <i>Coptic</i> or
	<i>Memphitic version,</i> omit "of His flesh and of His bones";
	the words may have crept into the text through the <i>Margin</i> from
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:23">Genesis 2:23</span>, <i>Septuagint.</i>
	However, IRENÆUS, 294,
	and the old <i>Latin</i> and <i>Vulgate versions,</i> with some good
	old manuscripts, have them.</p>
