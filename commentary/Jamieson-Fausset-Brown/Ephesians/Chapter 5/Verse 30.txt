30. For—Greek,
	"Because" (1 Corinthians 6:15).
	Christ nourisheth and cherisheth the Church as being of one flesh
	with Him. Translate, "Because we are members of His body (His
	literal body), being OF
	His flesh and of His bones" [ALFORD]
	(Genesis 2:23; Genesis 2:24).
	The Greek expresses, "Being formed out of" or
	"of the substance of His flesh." Adam's deep sleep, wherein
	Eve was formed from out of his opened side, is an emblem of Christ's
	death, which was the birth of the Spouse, the Church. John 12:24;
	John 19:34; John 19:35,
	to which Ephesians 5:25-27
	allude, as implying atonement by His blood, and sanctification
	by the "water," answering to that which flowed from His
	side (compare also John 7:38;
	John 7:39; 1 Corinthians 6:11).
	As Adam gave Eve a new name, Hebrew, "Isha,"
	"woman," formed from his own rib, Ish, "man,"
	signifying her formation from him, so Christ, Revelation 2:17;
	Revelation 3:12. Genesis 2:21;
	Genesis 2:23; Genesis 2:24
	puts the bones first because the reference there is to the
	natural structure. But Paul is referring to the flesh of
	Christ. It is not our bones and flesh, but "we"
	that are spiritually propagated (in our soul and spirit now,
	and in the body hereafter, regenerated) from the manhood of Christ
	which has flesh and bones. We are members of His glorified body (Genesis 2:24- :). The two oldest existing manuscripts, and Coptic or
	Memphitic version, omit "of His flesh and of His bones";
	the words may have crept into the text through the Margin from
	Genesis 2:23, Septuagint.
	However, IRENÆUS, 294,
	and the old Latin and Vulgate versions, with some good
	old manuscripts, have them.
