<p><b>31. For</b>—The propagation of the
	Church from Christ, as that of Eve from Adam, is the foundation of
	the spiritual marriage. The natural marriage, wherein "a man
	leaves father and mother (the oldest manuscripts omit 'his') and is
	joined unto his wife," is not the principal thing meant here,
	but <i>the spiritual marriage</i> represented by it, and on which it
	rests, whereby Christ left the Father's bosom to woo to Himself the
	Church out of a lost world: <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> proves this: His earthly mother <i>as such,</i> also, He
	holds in secondary account as compared with His spiritual Bride
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:48">Luke 2:48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:49">Luke 2:49</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:28">Luke 11:28</span>). He shall again leave
	His Father's abode to consummate the union (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:1-10">Matthew 25:1-10</span>;

<p><b>they two shall be one
	flesh</b>—So the Samaritan Pentateuch, the <i>Septuagint,</i> c.,
	read (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24">Genesis 2:24</span>), instead of "they
	shall be one flesh." So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:24- :">Genesis 2:24- :</span>. In natural marriage, husband and wife combine the elements
	of one perfect human being: the one being incomplete without the
	other. So Christ, as God-man, is pleased to make the Church, the
	body, a necessary adjunct to Himself, the Head. He is the archetype
	of the Church, from whom and according to whom, as the pattern, she
	is formed. He is her Head, as the husband is of the wife (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:5">Romans 6:5</span>

	Christ will never allow any power to sever Himself and His bride,
	indissolubly joined (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:6">Matthew 19:6</span>;
