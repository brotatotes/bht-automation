<p><b>32.</b> Rather, "This mystery
	is a great one." This <i>profound truth, beyond man's power of
	discovering,</i> but <i>now revealed,</i> namely, of the spiritual
	union of Christ and the Church, represented by the marriage union, is
	a great one, of deep import. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. So "mystery" is used of a divine truth not to be
	discovered save by revelation of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>). The <i>Vulgate</i>
	wrongly translates, "This is a great <i>sacrament,</i>"
	which is made the plea by the Romish Church (in spite of the blunder
	having been long ago exposed by their own commentators, CAJETAN
	and ESTIUS) for making
	marriage a <i>sacrament;</i> it is plain not marriage in general, but
	that of Christ and the Church, is what is pronounced to be a "great
	mystery," as the words following prove, "<i>I</i>
	[emphatic] say it in regard to Christ and to the Church" (so the
	<i>Greek</i> is best translated). "I, while I quote these words
	out of Scripture, use them in a higher sense" [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON].</p>
