<p><b>4. filthiness</b>—obscenity in <i>act</i>
	or <i>gesture.</i>
</p>
<p><b>foolish talking</b>—the
	<i>talk</i> of fools, which is folly and sin together. The <i>Greek</i>
	of it, and of "filthiness," occurs nowhere else in the New
	Testament. 
	</p>
<p><b>nor</b>—rather, "or"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:3">Ephesians 5:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>jesting</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>eutrapelia</i>"; found nowhere else in the New
	Testament: implying strictly that <i>versatility</i> which turns
	about and adapts itself, without regard to principle, to the shifting
	circumstances of the moment, and to the varying moods of those with
	whom it may deal. Not scurrile buffoonery, but refined "persiflage"
	and "badinage," for which Ephesus was famed [PLAUTUS,
	<i>A Boastful Soldier,</i> 3.1,42-52], and which, so far from being
	censured, was and is thought by the world a pleasant accomplishment.
	In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:8">Colossians 3:8</span>, "filthy
	communication" refers to the <i>foulness;</i> "foolish
	talking," to the <i>folly;</i> "jesting," to the <i>false
	refinement</i> (and <i>trifling witticism</i> [TITTMANN])
	Of discourse unseasoned with the salt of grace [TRENCH].
	</p>
<p><b>not convenient</b>—"unseemly";
	not such "as become saints" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:8- :">Colossians 3:8- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>rather giving of thanks</b>—a
	happy play on sounds in <i>Greek,</i> "<i>eucharistia</i>"
	contrasted with "<i>eutrapelia</i>"; refined "jesting"
	and subtle humor sometimes offend the tender feelings of grace;
	"giving of thanks" gives that real cheerfulness of spirit
	to believers which the worldly try to get from "jesting"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:19">Ephesians 5:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:20">Ephesians 5:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:13">James 5:13</span>).</p>
