9. fruit of the Spiritâ€”taken
	by transcribers from Galatians 5:22.
	The true reading is that of the oldest manuscripts, "The fruit
	of THE LIGHT"; in
	contrast with "the unfruitful works of darkness" (Galatians 5:22- :). This verse is parenthetic. Walk as children of light, that
	is, in all good works and words, "FOR the fruit of the light is
	[borne] in [ALFORD; but
	BENGEL, 'consists in'] all
	goodness [opposed to 'malice,' Galatians 5:22- :], righteousness [opposed to 'covetousness,' Galatians 5:22- :] and truth [opposed to 'lying,' Galatians 5:22- :]."
