<p><b>9. fruit of the Spirit</b>â€”taken
	by transcribers from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>.
	The true reading is that of the oldest manuscripts, "The fruit
	of THE LIGHT"; in
	contrast with "the unfruitful works of darkness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22- :">Galatians 5:22- :</span>). This verse is parenthetic. Walk as children of light, that
	is, in all good works and words, "FOR the fruit of the light is
	[borne] in [ALFORD; but
	BENGEL, 'consists in'] all
	goodness [opposed to 'malice,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22- :">Galatians 5:22- :</span>], righteousness [opposed to 'covetousness,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22- :">Galatians 5:22- :</span>] and truth [opposed to 'lying,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22- :">Galatians 5:22- :</span>]."</p>
