<p><b>1. obey</b>—stronger than the
	expression as to wives, "submitting," or "being
	subject" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21">Ephesians 5:21</span>).
	<i>Obedience</i> is more unreasoning and implicit; <i>submission</i>
	is the willing <i>subjection</i> of an inferior in point of order to
	one who has a right to command.

<p><b>in the Lord</b>—Both
	parents and children being Christians "in the Lord,"
	expresses the <i>element</i> in which the obedience is to take place,
	and the <i>motive</i> to obedience. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21- :">Ephesians 5:21- :</span>, it is, "Children, obey your parents <i>in all things.</i>"
	This clause, "in the Lord," would suggest the due
	limitation of the obedience required (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21- :">Ephesians 5:21- :</span>; compare on the other hand, the abuse, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:21- :">Ephesians 5:21- :</span>).

<p><b>right</b>—Even by <i>natural
	law</i> we should render obedience to them from whom we have derived
	life.</p>
