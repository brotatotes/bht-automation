1. obey—stronger than the
	expression as to wives, "submitting," or "being
	subject" (Ephesians 5:21).
	Obedience is more unreasoning and implicit; submission
	is the willing subjection of an inferior in point of order to
	one who has a right to command. 
	in the Lord—Both
	parents and children being Christians "in the Lord,"
	expresses the element in which the obedience is to take place,
	and the motive to obedience. In Ephesians 5:21- :, it is, "Children, obey your parents in all things."
	This clause, "in the Lord," would suggest the due
	limitation of the obedience required (Ephesians 5:21- :; compare on the other hand, the abuse, Ephesians 5:21- :). 
	right—Even by natural
	law we should render obedience to them from whom we have derived
	life.
