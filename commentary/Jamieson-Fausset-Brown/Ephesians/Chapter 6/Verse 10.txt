<p><b>10. my brethren</b>—Some of the
	oldest manuscripts omit these words. Some with <i>Vulgate</i> retain
	them. The phrase occurs nowhere else in the Epistle (see, however,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:23">Ephesians 6:23</span>); if genuine, it is
	appropriate here in the close of the Epistle, where he is urging his
	fellow soldiers to the good fight in the Christian armor. Most of the
	oldest manuscripts for "finally," read, "henceforward,"
	or "from henceforth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:23- :">Ephesians 6:23- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>be strong</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"be strengthened." 
	</p>
<p><b>in the power of his
	might</b>—<i>Christ's</i> might: as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:23- :">Ephesians 6:23- :</span>, it is <i>the Father's</i> might.</p>
