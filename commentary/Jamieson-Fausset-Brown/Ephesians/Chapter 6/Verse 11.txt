11. the whole armour—the armor
	of light (Romans 13:12); on the

	The panoply offensive and defensive. An image readily suggested by
	the Roman armory, Paul being now in Rome. Repeated emphatically, 2 Corinthians 6:7- :. In Romans 13:14 it is,

	ear, or the tongue, is to be given to Satan. Believers have once for

	gained over him, they are ever again to fight against and overcome
	him, even as they who once die with Christ have continually to
	mortify their members upon earth (Romans 6:2-14;
	Colossians 3:3; Colossians 3:5).

	God; not our own, else it would not stand (Colossians 3:5- :). Spiritual, therefore, and mighty through God, not carnal

	wiles—literally,
	"schemes sought out" for deceiving (compare 2 Corinthians 10:4- :). 
	the devil—the ruling
	chief of the foes (Ephesians 6:12)
	organized into a kingdom of darkness (Ephesians 6:12- :), opposed to the kingdom of light.
