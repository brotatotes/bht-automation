	The panoply offensive and defensive. An image readily suggested by
	the Roman armory, Paul being now in Rome. Repeated emphatically, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:7- :">2 Corinthians 6:7- :</span>. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:14">Romans 13:14</span> it is,
	"Put ye on <i>the Lord Jesus Christ</i>"; in putting on
	Him, and the new man in Him, we put on "the whole armor of God."
	No opening at the head, the feet, the heart, the belly, the eye, the
	ear, or the tongue, is to be given to Satan. Believers have once for
	all overcome him; but on the ground of this fundamental victory
	gained over him, they are ever again to fight against and overcome
	him, even as they who once die with Christ have continually to
	mortify their members upon earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:2-14">Romans 6:2-14</span>;
