12. Greek, "For our
	wrestling ('the wrestling' in which we are engaged) is not
	against flesh," c. Flesh and blood foes are Satan's mere tools,
	the real foe lurking behind them is Satan himself, with whom our
	conflict is. "Wrestling" implies that it is a hand-to-hand
	and foot-to-foot struggle for the mastery: to wrestle successfully
	with Satan, we must wrestle with GOD
	in irresistible prayer like Jacob (Genesis 32:24-29
Hosea 12:4). Translate, "The
	principalities . . . the powers" (Ephesians 1:21;
	Colossians 1:16; see on Colossians 1:16- :). The same grades of powers are specified in the case of the
	demons here, as in that of angels there (compare Romans 8:38;
	1 Corinthians 15:24; Colossians 2:15).
	The Ephesians had practiced sorcery (Colossians 2:15- :), so that he appropriately treats of evil spirits in
	addressing them. The more clearly any book of Scripture, as this,
	treats of the economy of the kingdom of light, the more clearly does
	it set forth the kingdom of darkness. Hence, nowhere does the satanic
	kingdom come more clearly into view than in the Gospels which treat
	of Christ, the true Light. 
	rulers of the darkness of
	this world—Greek, "age" or "course of the
	world." But the oldest manuscripts omit "of world."
	Translate, "Against the world rulers of this (present) darkness"
	(Ephesians 2:2; Ephesians 5:8;
	Luke 22:53; Colossians 1:13).
	On Satan and his demons being "world rulers," compare
	John 12:31; John 14:30;
	John 16:11; Luke 4:6;
	2 Corinthians 4:4; 1 John 5:19,
	Greek, "lieth in the wicked one." Though they be
	"world rulers," they are not the ruler of the universe; and
	their usurped rule of the world is soon to cease, when He shall "come
	whose right it is" (1 John 5:19- :). Two cases prove Satan not to be a mere subjective fancy:
	(1) Christ's temptation; (2) the entrance of demons into the swine
	(for these are incapable of such fancies). Satan tries to parody, or
	imitate in a perverted way, God's working (2 Corinthians 11:13;
	2 Corinthians 11:14). So when God became
	incarnate, Satan, by his demons, took forcible possession of human
	bodies. Thus the demoniacally possessed were not peculiarly wicked,
	but miserable, and so fit subjects for Jesus' pity. Paul makes no
	mention of demoniacal possession, so that in the time he wrote, it
	seems to have ceased; it probably was restricted to the period of the
	Lord's incarnation, and of the foundation of His Church. 
	spiritual wickedness—rather
	as Greek, "The spiritual hosts of
	wickedness." As three of the clauses describe the power,
	so this fourth, the wickedness of our spiritual foes (2 Corinthians 11:14- :). 
	in high places—Greek,
	"heavenly places": in 2 Corinthians 11:14- :, "the air," see on 2 Corinthians 11:14- :. The alteration of expression to "in heavenly places,"
	is in order to mark the higher range of their powers than ours, they
	having been, up to the ascension (Revelation 12:5;
	Revelation 12:9; Revelation 12:10),
	dwellers "in the heavenly places" (Revelation 12:10- :), and being now in the regions of the air which are called
	the heavens. Moreover, pride and presumption are the sins in
	heavenly places to which they tempt especially, being those by
	which they themselves fell from heavenly places (Revelation 12:10- :). But believers have naught to fear, being "blessed
	with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places" (Revelation 12:10- :).
