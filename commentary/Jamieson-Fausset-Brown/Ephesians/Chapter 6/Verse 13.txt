<p><b>13. take . . . of God</b>—not
	"make," God has done that: you have only to "take up"
	and put it on. The Ephesians were familiar with the idea of the gods
	giving armor to mythical heroes: thus Paul's allusion would be
	appropriate. 
	</p>
<p><b>the evil day</b>—the day of
	Satan's special assaults (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:12">Ephesians 6:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16">Ephesians 6:16</span>) in life and at the
	dying hour (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10">Revelation 3:10</span>).
	We must have our armor always on, to be ready against the evil day
	which may come at any moment, the war being perpetual (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10- :">Revelation 3:10- :</span>, <i>Margin</i>). 
	</p>
<p><b>done all</b>—rather,
	"accomplished all things," namely, necessary to the fight,
	and becoming a good soldier.</p>
