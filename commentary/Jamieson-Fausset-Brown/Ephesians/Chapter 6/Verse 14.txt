<p><b>14. Stand</b>—The repetition in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:11">Ephesians 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:14">Ephesians 6:14</span>,
	shows that <i>standing,</i> that is, <i>maintaining our ground,</i>
	not yielding or fleeing, is the grand aim of the Christian soldier.
	Translate as <i>Greek,</i> "Having girt about your loins with
	truth," that is, with truthfulness, sincerity, a good conscience
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:5">1 Timothy 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:18">1 Timothy 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:9">1 Timothy 3:9</span>).
	Truth is the band that girds up and keeps together the flowing robes,
	so as that the Christian soldier may be unencumbered for action. So
	the Passover was eaten with the loins girt, and the shoes on the feet
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:11">Exodus 12:11</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+5:27">Isaiah 5:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:35">Luke 12:35</span>). <i>Faithfulness</i>
	(<i>Septuagint,</i> "truth") is the girdle of Messiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:35- :">Luke 12:35- :</span>): so <i>truth</i> of His followers.

<p><b>having on</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"having put on."

<p><b>breastplate of righteousness</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:17">Isaiah 59:17</span>), similarly of
	Messiah. "Righteousness" is here joined with "truth,"
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:9">Ephesians 5:9</span>: <i>righteousness</i>
	in works, <i>truth</i> in words [ESTIUS]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:7">1 John 3:7</span>). Christ's
	righteousness inwrought in us by the Spirit. "Faith and love,"
	that is, faith working righteousness by love, are "the
	breastplate" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:8">1 Thessalonians 5:8</span>.</p>
