<p><b>16. Above all</b>—rather, "Over
	all"; so as to cover all that has been put on before. Three
	integuments are specified, the breastplate, girdle, and shoes; two
	defenses, the helmet and shield; and two offensive weapons, the sword
	and the spear (prayer). ALFORD
	translates, "Besides all," as the <i>Greek</i> is
	translated, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:20">Luke 3:20</span>. But if it
	meant this, it would have come <i>last</i> in the list (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:20- :">Luke 3:20- :</span>).

<p><b>shield</b>—the large oblong
	oval door-like shield of the Romans, four feet long by two and a half
	feet broad; not the small round buckler.

<p><b>ye shall be able</b>—not
	<i>merely,</i> "ye may." The shield of faith will <i>certainly</i>
	intercept, and so "quench, all the fiery darts" (an image
	from the ancient fire-darts, formed of cane, with tow and
	combustibles ignited on the head of the shaft, so as to set fire to
	woodwork, tents, &amp;c.).

<p><b>of the wicked</b>—rather
	"of the EVIL ONE."
	Faith conquers him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:9">1 Peter 5:9</span>),
	and his darts of temptation to wrath, lust, revenge, despair, &amp;c.
	It overcomes the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>),
	and so the prince of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4- :">1 John 5:4- :</span>).</p>
