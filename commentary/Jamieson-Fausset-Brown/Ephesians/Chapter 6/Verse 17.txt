17. take—a different Greek
	word from that in Ephesians 6:13;
	Ephesians 6:16; translate, therefore,
	"receive," "accept," namely, the helmet offered
	by the Lord, namely, "salvation" appropriated, as Ephesians 6:16- :, "Helmet, the hope of salvation"; not an uncertain
	hope, but one that brings with it no shame of disappointment (Ephesians 6:16- :). It is subjoined to the shield of faith, as being its
	inseparable accompaniment (compare Romans 5:1;
	Romans 5:5). The head of the soldier
	was among the principal parts to be defended, as on it the deadliest
	strokes might fall, and it is the head that commands the whole body.
	The head is the seat of the mind, which, when it has laid hold
	of the sure Gospel "hope" of eternal life, will not receive
	false doctrine, or give way to Satan's temptations to despair.
	God, by this hope, "lifts up the head" (Psalms 3:3;
	Luke 21:28). 
	sword of the Spirit—that
	is, furnished by the Spirit, who inspired the writers of the word of
	God (2 Peter 1:21). Again the
	Trinity is implied: the Spirit here; and Christ in "salvation"
	and God the Father, Ephesians 6:13
	(compare Hebrews 4:12; Revelation 1:16;
	Revelation 2:12). The two-edged sword,
	cutting both ways (Psalms 45:3;
	Psalms 45:5), striking some with
	conviction and conversion, and others with condemnation (Isaiah 11:4;
	Revelation 19:15), is in the mouth
	of Christ (Isaiah 49:2), in the
	hand of His saints (Isaiah 49:2- :). Christ's use of this sword in the temptation is our
	pattern as to how we are to wield it against Satan (Matthew 4:4;
	Matthew 4:7; Matthew 4:10).
	There is no armor specified for the back, but only for the front of
	the body; implying that we must never turn our back to the foe (Matthew 4:10- :); our only safety is in resisting ceaselessly (Matthew 4:11;
	James 4:7).
