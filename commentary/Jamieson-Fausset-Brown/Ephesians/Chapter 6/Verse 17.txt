	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16">Ephesians 6:16</span>; translate, therefore,

	by the Lord, namely, "salvation" appropriated, as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16- :">Ephesians 6:16- :</span>, "Helmet, the hope of salvation"; not an uncertain
	hope, but one that brings with it no shame of disappointment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16- :">Ephesians 6:16- :</span>). It is subjoined to the shield of faith, as being its
	inseparable accompaniment (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span>). The head of the soldier
	was among the principal parts to be defended, as on it the deadliest
	strokes might fall, and it is the head that commands the whole body.
	The head is the seat of the <i>mind,</i> which, when it has laid hold
	of the sure Gospel "hope" of eternal life, will not receive
	false doctrine, or give way to Satan's temptations to <i>despair.</i>
	God, by this hope, "lifts up the head" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+3:3">Psalms 3:3</span>;

	God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:21">2 Peter 1:21</span>). Again the
	Trinity is implied: the Spirit here; and Christ in "salvation"
	and God the Father, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:13">Ephesians 6:13</span>

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+45:5">Psalms 45:5</span>), striking some with

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:15">Revelation 19:15</span>), is in the <i>mouth</i>

	<i>hand</i> of His saints (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:2- :">Isaiah 49:2- :</span>). Christ's use of this sword in the temptation is our
	pattern as to how we are to wield it against Satan (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:4">Matthew 4:4</span>;

	the body; implying that we must never turn our back to the foe (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:10- :">Matthew 4:10- :</span>); our only safety is in resisting ceaselessly (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:11">Matthew 4:11</span>;
