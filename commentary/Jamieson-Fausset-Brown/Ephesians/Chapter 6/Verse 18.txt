18. always—Greek, "in
	every season"; implying opportunity and exigency
	(Colossians 4:2). Paul uses the very
	words of Jesus in Luke 21:36 (a
	Gospel which he quotes elsewhere, in undesigned consonance with the
	fact of Luke being his associate in travel, 1 Corinthians 11:23;
	1 Timothy 5:18). Compare Luke 18:1;
	Romans 12:12; 1 Thessalonians 5:17.
	with all—that is, every
	kind of. 
	prayer—a sacred term
	for prayer in general. 
	supplication—a common
	term for a special kind of prayer [HARLESS],
	an imploring request. "Prayer" for obtaining
	blessings, "supplication" for averting evils which we fear
	[GROTIUS]. 
	in the Spirit—to be
	joined with "praying." It is he in us, as the Spirit
	of adoption, who prays, and enables us to pray (Romans 8:15;
	Romans 8:26; Galatians 4:6;
	Judges 1:20). 
	watching—not sleeping
	(Ephesians 5:14; Psalms 88:13;
	Matthew 26:41). So in the temple a
	perpetual watch was maintained (compare Anna, Matthew 26:41- :). 
	thereunto—"watching
	unto" (with a view to) prayer and supplication. 
	with—Greek,
	"in." Persevering constancy ("perseverance")
	and (that is, exhibited in) supplication are to be the
	element in which our watchfulness is to be exercised. 
	for all saints—as none
	is so perfect as not to need the intercessions of his fellow
	Christians.
