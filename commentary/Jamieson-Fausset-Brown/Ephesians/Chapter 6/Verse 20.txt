<p><b>20. For</b>—<i>Greek,</i> as in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:19">Ephesians 6:19</span>, "<i>On behalf of</i>
	which." 
	</p>
<p><b>an ambassador in bonds</b>—a
	paradox. Ambassadors were held inviolable by the law of nations, and
	could not, without outrage to every sacred right, be put in chains.
	Yet Christ's "ambassador is in <i>a chain!</i>" The <i>Greek</i>
	is singular. The Romans used to bind a prisoner to a soldier by <i>a
	single chain,</i> in a kind of free custody. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:16">Acts 28:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+28:20">Acts 28:20</span>, "I am bound with
	this <i>chain.</i>" The term, "bonds" (plural), on the
	other hand, is used when the prisoner's hands or feet were bound
	together (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:29">Acts 26:29</span>); compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+12:6">Acts 12:6</span>, where the plural marks
	the distinction. The singular is only used of the particular kind of
	custody described above; an undesigned coincidence [PALEY].</p>
