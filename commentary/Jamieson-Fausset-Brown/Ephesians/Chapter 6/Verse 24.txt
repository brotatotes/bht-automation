24. Contrast the malediction on
	all who love Him not (1 Corinthians 16:22).
	in sincerityâ€”Greek,
	"in incorruption," that is, not as English
	Version, but "with an immortal (constant) love" [WAHL].
	Compare "that which is not corruptible" (1 Corinthians 16:22- :). Not a fleeting, earthly love, but a spiritual and eternal
	one [ALFORD]. Contrast 1 Corinthians 16:22- :, worldly things "which perish with the using."
	Compare 1 Corinthians 9:25, "corruptible
	. . . incorruptible crown." "Purely," "holily"
	[ESTIUS], without the
	corruption of sin (See on 1 Corinthians 9:25- :;
	2 Peter 1:4; Judges 1:10).
	Where the Lord Jesus has a true believer, there I have a brother
	[BISHOP M'IKWAINE].
	He who is good enough for Christ, is good enough for me [R. HALL].
	The differences of opinion among real Christians are comparatively
	small, and show that they are not following one another like silly
	sheep, each trusting the one before him. Their agreement in the main,
	while showing their independence as witnesses by differing in
	non-essentials, can only be accounted for by their being all in the
	right direction (Acts 15:8;
	Acts 15:9; 1 Corinthians 1:2;
	1 Corinthians 12:3).
