<p><b>in sincerity</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>in incorruption,</i>" that is, not as <i>English
	Version,</i> but "with an immortal (constant) love" [WAHL].
	Compare "that which is not corruptible" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:22- :">1 Corinthians 16:22- :</span>). Not a fleeting, earthly love, but a spiritual and eternal
	one [ALFORD]. Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:22- :">1 Corinthians 16:22- :</span>, worldly things "which perish with the using."
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>, "corruptible
	. . . <i>incorruptible</i> crown." "Purely," "holily"
	[ESTIUS], without the
	corruption of sin (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25- :">1 Corinthians 9:25- :</span>;

	The differences of opinion among real Christians are comparatively
	small, and show that they are not following one another like silly
	sheep, each trusting the one before him. Their agreement in the main,
	while showing their independence as witnesses by differing in
	non-essentials, can only be accounted for by their being all in the
	right direction (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:8">Acts 15:8</span>;
