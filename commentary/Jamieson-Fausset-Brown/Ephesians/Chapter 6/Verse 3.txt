<p><b>3. long on the earth</b>â€”In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "long upon <i>the land which the Lord thy God giveth
	thee,</i>" which Paul adapts to Gospel times, by taking away the
	local and limited reference peculiar to the Jews in Canaan. The godly
	are equally blessed in every land, as the Jews were in the land which
	God gave them. This promise is always fulfilled, either literally, or
	by the substitution of a higher blessing, namely, one spiritual and
	eternal (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+5:26">Job 5:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:27">Proverbs 10:27</span>).
	The substance and essence of the law are eternally in force: its
	accidents alone (applying to Israel of old) are abolished (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:27- :">Proverbs 10:27- :</span>).</p>
