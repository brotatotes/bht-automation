<p><b>5. Servants</b>—literally,
	"slaves." 
	</p>
<p><b>masters according to the
	flesh</b>—in contrast to your true and heavenly Master (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). A consolatory him that the mastership to which they were
	subject, was but for a time [CHRYSOSTOM];
	and that their real liberty was still their own (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>fear and trembling</b>—not
	slavish terror, but (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:15">2 Corinthians 7:15</span>) an anxious eagerness
	to do your duty, and a fear of displeasing, as great as is produced
	in the ordinary slave by "threatenings" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:15- :">2 Corinthians 7:15- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>singleness</b>—without
	double-mindedness, or "eye service" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:15- :">2 Corinthians 7:15- :</span>), which seeks to please outwardly, without the sincere desire
	to make the master's interest at all times the first consideration
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+29:17">1 Chronicles 29:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:22">Matthew 6:22</span>;
