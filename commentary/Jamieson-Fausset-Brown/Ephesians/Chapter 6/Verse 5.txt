5. Servants—literally,
	"slaves." 
	masters according to the
	flesh—in contrast to your true and heavenly Master ( :-). A consolatory him that the mastership to which they were
	subject, was but for a time [CHRYSOSTOM];
	and that their real liberty was still their own ( :-). 
	fear and trembling—not
	slavish terror, but (See on  :-;
	2 Corinthians 7:15) an anxious eagerness
	to do your duty, and a fear of displeasing, as great as is produced
	in the ordinary slave by "threatenings" (2 Corinthians 7:15- :). 
	singleness—without
	double-mindedness, or "eye service" (2 Corinthians 7:15- :), which seeks to please outwardly, without the sincere desire
	to make the master's interest at all times the first consideration
	(1 Chronicles 29:17; Matthew 6:22;
	Matthew 6:23; Luke 11:34).
	"Simplicity."
