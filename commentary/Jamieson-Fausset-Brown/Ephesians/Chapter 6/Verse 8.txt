<p><b>8. any man doeth</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"any man shall have done," that is, shall be found at the
	Lord's coming to have done. 
	</p>
<p><b>the same</b>—in full
	payment, in heaven's currency. 
	</p>
<p><b>shall . . . receive</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:10">2 Corinthians 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:25">Colossians 3:25</span>;
	but all of grace, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:10">Luke 17:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>bond or free</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:22">1 Corinthians 7:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11">Colossians 3:11</span>). Christ does not regard
	such distinctions in His present dealings of grace, or in His future
	judgment. The slave that has acted faithfully for the Lord's sake to
	his master, though the latter may not repay his faithfulness, shall
	have the Lord for his Paymaster. So the freeman who has done good for
	the Lord's sake, though man may not pay him, has the Lord for his
	Debtor (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+19:17">Proverbs 19:17</span>).</p>
