<p><b>9. the same things</b>—<i>Mutatis
	mutandis.</i> Show the same regard to God's will, and to your
	servants' well-being, in your relation to them, as they ought to have
	in their relation to you. Love regulates the duties both of servants
	and masters, as one and the same light attempers various colors.
	Equality of nature and faith is superior to distinctions of rank
	[BENGEL]. Christianity
	makes all men brothers: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+25:42">Leviticus 25:42</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+34:14">Jeremiah 34:14</span> as to how the Hebrews
	were bound to treat their brethren in service; much more ought
	Christians to act with love.

<p><b>threatening</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the</i> threatening" which masters commonly use.
	"Masters" in the <i>Greek,</i> is not so strong a term as
	"despots": it implies <i>authority,</i> but not absolute
	<i>domination.</i>
</p>
<p><b>your Master also</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "the Master both of them and you":
	"their Master and yours." This more forcibly brings out the
	equality of slaves and masters in the sight of God. SENECA
	[<i>Thyestes,</i> 607], says, "Whatever an inferior dreads from
	you, this a superior Master threatens yourselves with: every
	authority here is under a higher above." As you treat your
	servants, so will He treat you. 
	</p>
<p><b>neither . . . respect of
	persons</b>—He will not, in judging, acquit thee because thou art a
	master, or condemn him because he is a servant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:34">Acts 10:34</span>;
