	GREETINGS. THE
	CAUSE OF HIS
	WRITING IS
	THEIR SPEEDY
	FALLING AWAY
	FROM THE GOSPEL HE
	TAUGHT. DEFENSE
	OF HIS TEACHING:
	HIS APOSTOLIC
	CALL INDEPENDENT
	OF MAN. 
	</p>
<p>Judaizing teachers had persuaded
	the Galatians that Paul had taught them the new religion imperfectly,
	and at second hand; that the founder of their church himself
	possessed only a deputed commission, the seal of truth and authority
	being in the apostles at Jerusalem: moreover, that whatever he might
	profess among them, he had himself at other times, and in other
	places, given way to the doctrine of circumcision. To refute this, he
	appeals to the history of his conversion, and to the manner of his
	conferring with the apostles when he met them at Jerusalem; that so
	far was his doctrine from being derived from them, or they from
	exercising any superiority over him, that they had simply assented to
	what he had already preached among the Gentiles, which preaching was
	communicated, not by them to him, but by himself to them [PALEY].
	Such an apologetic Epistle could not be a later forgery, the
	objections which it meets only coming out incidentally, not being
	obtruded as they would be by a forger; and also being such as could
	only arise in the earliest age of the Church, when Jerusalem and
	Judaism still held a prominent place.</p>
