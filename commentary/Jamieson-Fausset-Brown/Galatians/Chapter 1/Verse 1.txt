<p><b>1. apostle</b>—in the earliest
	Epistles, the two to the Thessalonians, through humility, he uses no
	title of authority; but associates with him "Silvanus and
	Timotheus"; yet here, though "brethren" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) are with him, he does not <i>name</i> them but puts his own
	name and apostleship prominent: evidently because his apostolic
	commission needs now to be vindicated against deniers of it. 
	</p>
<p><b>of</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"from." Expressing the <i>origin</i> from which his mission
	came, "not from <i>men,</i>" but from Christ and the Father
	(understood) as the source. "By" expresses the immediate
	operating agent in the call. Not only was the call <i>from</i> God as
	its ultimate source, but <i>by</i> Christ and the Father as the
	immediate agent in calling him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:15">Acts 22:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:16-18">Acts 26:16-18</span>). The laying
	on of Ananias' hands (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:17">Acts 9:17</span>)
	is no objection to this; for that was but a sign of the fact, not an
	assisting cause. So the Holy Ghost calls him specially (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:3">Acts 13:3</span>); he was an apostle
	<i>before</i> this special mission. 
	</p>
<p><b>man</b>—singular; to mark
	the contrast to "Jesus Christ." The opposition between
	"Christ" and "man," and His name being put in
	closest connection with God the Father, imply His Godhead. 
	</p>
<p><b>raised him from the
	dead</b>—implying that, though he had not seen Him in His
	humiliation as the other apostles (which was made an objection
	against him), he had seen and been <i>constituted an apostle by Him
	in His resurrection power</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:18">Matthew 28:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5">Romans 1:5</span>).
	Compare as to the ascension, the consequence of the resurrection, and
	the cause of His giving "apostles," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5- :">Romans 1:5- :</span>. He rose again, too, for our <i>justification</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:5- :">Romans 1:5- :</span>); thus Paul prepares the way for the prominent subject of
	the Epistle, justification in Christ, not by the law.</p>
