10. For—accounting for the
	strong language he has just used. 
	do I now—resuming the
	"now" of Galatians 1:9. "Am
	I now persuading men?" [ALFORD],
	that is, conciliating. Is what I have just now said a sample
	of men-pleasing, of which I am accused? His adversaries accused him
	of being an interested flatterer of men, "becoming all things to
	all men," to make a party for himself, and so observing the law
	among the Jews (for instance, circumcising Timothy), yet persuading
	the Gentiles to renounce it (Galatians 1:9- :) (in order to flatter those, really keeping them in a
	subordinate state, not admitted to the full privileges which the
	circumcised alone enjoyed). NEANDER
	explains the "now" thus: Once, when a Pharisee, I was
	actuated only by a regard to human authority and to please men
	(Luke 16:15; John 5:44),
	but NOW I teach as
	responsible to God alone (1 Corinthians 4:3).
	or God?—Regard is to be
	had to God alone. 
	for if I yet pleased men—The
	oldest manuscripts omit "for." "If I were still
	pleasing men," c. (Luke 6:26
John 15:19; 1 Thessalonians 2:4;
	James 4:4; 1 John 4:5).
	On "yet," compare 1 John 4:5- :. 
	servant of Christ—and
	so pleasing Him in all things (Titus 2:9;
	Colossians 3:22).
