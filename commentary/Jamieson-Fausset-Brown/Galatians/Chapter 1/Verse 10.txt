<p><b>do I now</b>—resuming the
	"now" of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:9">Galatians 1:9</span>. "Am
	I <i>now</i> persuading men?" [ALFORD],
	that is, conciliating. Is what I have <i>just now</i> said a sample
	of men-pleasing, of which I am accused? His adversaries accused him
	of being an interested flatterer of men, "becoming all things to
	all men," to make a party for himself, and so observing the law
	among the Jews (for instance, circumcising Timothy), yet persuading
	the Gentiles to renounce it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:9- :">Galatians 1:9- :</span>) (in order to flatter those, really keeping them in a
	subordinate state, not admitted to the full privileges which the
	circumcised alone enjoyed). NEANDER
	explains the "now" thus: Once, when a Pharisee, I was
	actuated only by a regard to human authority and to please men
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:15">Luke 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:44">John 5:44</span>),
	but NOW I teach as
	responsible to God alone (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:3">1 Corinthians 4:3</span>).

<p><b>or God?</b>—Regard is to be
	had to God alone.
