<p><b>11. certify</b>—I made known to
	you as to the Gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after
	man, that is, not <i>of, by,</i> or <i>from</i> man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:1">Galatians 1:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:12">Galatians 1:12</span>). It is <i>not according</i>
	to man; not influenced by mere human considerations, as it would be,
	if it were of human origin.

<p><b>brethren</b>—He not till
	now calls them so.</p>
