<p><b>12.</b> Translate, "For <i>not
	even</i> did I <i>myself</i> (any more than the other apostles)
	receive it from man, <i>nor</i> was I taught it (by man)."
	"Received it," implies the absence of labor in acquiring
	it. "Taught it," implies the labor of learning.

<p><b>by the revelation of Jesus
	Christ</b>â€”Translate, "by revelation of [that is, from] Jesus
	Christ." By His revealing it to me. Probably this took place
	during the three years, in part of which he sojourned in Arabia
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:17">Galatians 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span>),
	in the vicinity of the scene of the giving of the law; a fit place
	for such a revelation of the Gospel of grace, which supersedes the
	ceremonial law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:25">Galatians 4:25</span>). He,
	like other Pharisees who embraced Christianity, did not at first
	recognize its independence of the Mosaic law, but combined both
	together. Ananias, his first instructor, was universally esteemed for
	his legal piety and so was not likely to have taught him to sever
	Christianity from the law. This severance was partially recognized
	after the martyrdom of Stephen. But Paul received it by special
	revelation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:23">1 Corinthians 11:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:3">1 Corinthians 15:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span>). A vision of the Lord
	Jesus is mentioned (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18">Acts 22:18</span>),
	at his first visit to Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18- :">Acts 22:18- :</span>); but this seems to have been subsequent to the revelation
	here meant (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18- :">Acts 22:18- :</span>), and to have been confined to giving a particular
	command. The vision "fourteen years before" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18- :">Acts 22:18- :</span>) was in A.D. 43,
	still later, six years after his conversion. Thus Paul is an
	independent witness to the Gospel. Though he had received no
	instruction from the apostles, but from the Holy Ghost, yet when he
	met them his Gospel exactly agreed with theirs.</p>
