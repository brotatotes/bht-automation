<p><b>16. reveal his Son in me</b>—within
	me, in my inmost soul, by the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>,
	"shined in our hearts." The revealing of His Son by me to
	the Gentiles (so translate for "heathen") was impossible,
	unless He had first revealed His Son <i>in me;</i> at first on my
	conversion, but especially at the subsequent revelation from Jesus
	Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:12">Galatians 1:12</span>), whereby I
	learned the Gospel's independence of the Mosaic law.

<p><b>that I might preach</b>—the
	present in the <i>Greek,</i> which includes the idea "that I <i>may</i>
	preach Him," implying an office still <i>continuing.</i> This
	was the main commission entrusted to him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:7">Galatians 2:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9">Galatians 2:9</span>).

<p><b>immediately</b>—connected
	chiefly with "I went into Arabia" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9- :">Galatians 2:9- :</span>). It denotes the sudden fitness of the apostle. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9- :">Galatians 2:9- :</span>, "<i>Straightway</i> he preached Christ in the
	synagogue." 
	</p>
<p><b>I conferred not</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"I had not further (namely, in addition to revelation) recourse
	to . . . for the purpose of consulting." The divine revelation
	was sufficient for me [BENGEL].

<p><b>flesh and blood</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:9- :">Galatians 2:9- :</span>).</p>
