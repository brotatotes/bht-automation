<p><b>17. went I up</b>—Some of the
	oldest manuscripts read, "went away." 
	</p>
<p><b>to Jerusalem</b>—the seat
	of the apostles. 
	</p>
<p><b>into Arabia</b>—This
	journey (not recorded in Acts) was during the whole period of his
	stay at Damascus, called by Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "many [<i>Greek,</i> a considerable number of] days."
	It is curiously confirmatory of the legitimacy of taking "many
	days" to stand for "three years," that the same phrase
	exactly occurs in the same sense in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+2:38">1 Kings 2:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+2:39">1 Kings 2:39</span>. This was a country of
	the <i>Gentiles;</i> here doubtless he preached as he did before and
	after (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:20">Acts 9:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:22">Acts 9:22</span>)
	at Damascus: thus he shows the independence of his apostolic
	commission. He also here had that comparative retirement needed,
	after the first fervor of his conversion, to prepare him for the
	great work before him. Compare Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:29">Acts 7:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:30">Acts 7:30</span>). His familiarity with
	the scene of the giving of the law, and the meditations and
	revelations which he had there, appear in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:24">Galatians 4:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:25">Galatians 4:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:18">Hebrews 12:18</span>.
	See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:12">Galatians 1:12</span>. The Lord from
	heaven communed with him, as He on earth in the days of His flesh
	communed with the other apostles.
