18. after three years—dating
	from my conversion, as appears by the contrast to "immediately"
	(Galatians 1:16). This is the same
	visit to Jerusalem as in Acts 9:26,
	and at this visit occurred the vision (Acts 22:17;
	Acts 22:18). The incident which
	led to his leaving Damascus (Acts 9:25;
	2 Corinthians 11:33) was not the main cause
	of his going to Jerusalem. So that there is no discrepancy in
	the statement here that he went "to see Peter"; or rather,
	as Greek, "to make the acquaintance of"; "to
	become personally acquainted with." The two oldest manuscripts
	read, "Cephas," the name given Peter elsewhere in the
	Epistle, the Hebrew name; as Peter is the Greek
	(John 1:42). Appropriate to the
	view of him here as the apostle especially of the Hebrews. It is
	remarkable that Peter himself, in his Epistles, uses the Greek
	name Peter, perhaps to mark his antagonism to the Judaizers
	who would cling to the Hebraic form. He was prominent among the
	apostles, though James, as bishop of Jerusalem, had the chief
	authority there (Matthew 16:18).

	fifteen days—only
	fifteen days; contrasting with the long period of three years,
	during which, previously, he had exercised an independent commission
	in preaching: a fact proving on the face of it, how little he owed to
	Peter in regard to his apostolical authority or instruction. The
	Greek for "to see," at the same time implies
	visiting a person important to know, such as Peter was. The
	plots of the Jews prevented him staying longer (Matthew 16:18- :). Also, the vision directing him to depart to the Gentiles,
	for that the people of Jerusalem would not receive his testimony
	(Acts 22:17; Acts 22:18).
