<p><b>18. after three years</b>—dating
	from my conversion, as appears by the contrast to "immediately"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:16">Galatians 1:16</span>). This is the same
	visit to Jerusalem as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:26">Acts 9:26</span>,
	and at this visit occurred the vision (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18">Acts 22:18</span>). The incident which
	led to his leaving Damascus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+9:25">Acts 9:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:33">2 Corinthians 11:33</span>) was not the main <i>cause</i>
	of his going <i>to Jerusalem.</i> So that there is no discrepancy in
	the statement here that he went "to see Peter"; or rather,
	as <i>Greek,</i> "to make the acquaintance of"; "to
	become personally acquainted with." The two oldest manuscripts
	read, "Cephas," the name given Peter elsewhere in the
	Epistle, the <i>Hebrew</i> name; as <i>Peter</i> is the <i>Greek</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span>). Appropriate to the
	view of him here as the apostle especially of the Hebrews. It is
	remarkable that Peter himself, in his Epistles, uses the <i>Greek</i>
	name <i>Peter,</i> perhaps to mark his antagonism to the Judaizers
	who would cling to the Hebraic form. He was prominent among the
	apostles, though James, as bishop of Jerusalem, had the chief
	authority there (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18">Matthew 16:18</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>abode</b>—or "tarried"
	[ELLICOTT]. 
	</p>
<p><b>fifteen days</b>—only
	fifteen days; contrasting with the long period of <i>three years,</i>
	during which, previously, he had exercised an independent commission
	in preaching: a fact proving on the face of it, how little he owed to
	Peter in regard to his apostolical authority or instruction. The
	<i>Greek</i> for "to see," at the same time implies
	<i>visiting a person important to know,</i> such as Peter was. The
	plots of the Jews prevented him staying longer (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:18- :">Matthew 16:18- :</span>). Also, the vision directing him to depart to the Gentiles,
	for that the people of Jerusalem would not receive his testimony
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:17">Acts 22:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:18">Acts 22:18</span>).</p>
