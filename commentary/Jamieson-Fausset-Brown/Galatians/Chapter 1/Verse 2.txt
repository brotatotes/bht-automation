<p><b>2. all the brethren</b>—I am not
	alone in my doctrine; all my colleagues in the Gospel work,
	travelling with me (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29">Acts 19:29</span>,
	Gaius and Aristarchus at Ephesus: <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+19:29- :">Acts 19:29- :</span>, Sopater, Secundus, Timotheus, Tychicus, Trophimus, some, or
	all of these), join with me. Not that these were <i>joint authors</i>
	with Paul of the Epistle: but joined him in the <i>sentiments</i> and
	<i>salutations.</i> The phrase, "all the brethren," accords
	with a date when he had many travelling companions, he and they
	having to bear jointly the collection to Jerusalem [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON].

<p><b>the churches</b>—Pessinus
	and Ancyra were the principal cities; but doubtless there were many
	other churches in Galatia (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:23">Acts 18:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:1">1 Corinthians 16:1</span>). He does not attach any
	honorable title to the churches here, as elsewhere, being displeased
	at their Judaizing. See First Corinthians; First Thessalonians, &amp;c.
	The first Epistle of Peter is addressed to Jewish Christians
	sojourning in Galatia (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1">1 Peter 1:1</span>),
	among other places mentioned. It is interesting thus to find the
	apostle of the circumcision, as well as the apostle of the
	uncircumcision, once at issue (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:1- :">1 Peter 1:1- :</span>), co-operating to build up the same churches.</p>
