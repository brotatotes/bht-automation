21. I came into . . . Syria and
	Cilicia—"preaching the faith" ( :-), and so, no doubt, founding the churches in Syria and
	Cilicia, which he subsequently confirmed in the faith (Acts 15:23;
	Acts 15:41). He probably went
	first to Cæsarea, the main seaport, and thence by sea to Tarsus of
	Cilicia, his native place (Acts 15:41- :), and thence to Syria; Cilicia having its geographical
	affinities with Syria, rather than with Asia Minor, as the Tarsus
	mountains separate it from the latter. His placing "Syria"
	in the order of words before "Cilicia," is due to Antioch
	being a more important city than Tarsus, as also to his longer stay
	in the former city. Also "Syria and Cilicia," from their
	close geographical connection, became a generic geographical phrase,
	the more important district being placed first [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON]. This sea
	journey accounts for his being "unknown by face to the churches
	of Judea" (Galatians 1:22). He
	passes by in silence his second visit, with alms, to Judea and
	Jerusalem (Acts 11:30);
	doubtless because it was for a limited and special object, and would
	occupy but a few days (Acts 12:25),
	as there raged at Jerusalem at the time a persecution in which James,
	the brother of John, was martyred, and Peter was m prison, and James
	seems to have been the only apostle present (Acts 12:25- :); so it was needless to mention this visit, seeing that he
	could not at such a time have received the instructions which the
	Galatians alleged he had derived from the primary fountains of
	authority, the apostles.
