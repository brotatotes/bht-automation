<p><b>4. gave himself</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); unto death, as an offering. Found only in this and the
	Pastoral Epistles. The <i>Greek</i> is different in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>deliver us from this</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"out of the," c. The Father and Son are each said to
	"deliver us," &amp;c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): but the Son, not the Father, <i>gave Himself for us</i> in
	order to do so, and make us citizens of a better world (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The Galatians in desiring to return to legal bondage are,
	he implies, renouncing the <i>deliverance</i> which Christ wrought
	for us. This he more fully repeats in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. "Deliver" is the very word used by the Lord as to
	His deliverance of Paul himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): an undesigned coincidence between Paul and Luke.

<p><b>world</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"age" <i>system</i> or <i>course</i> of the world, regarded
	from a religious point of view. The present <i>age</i> opposes the
	"glory" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:5">Galatians 1:5</span>) of
	God, and is under the authority of the Evil One. The "ages of
	ages" (<i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:5">Galatians 1:5</span>)
	are opposed to "the present evil age." 
	</p>
<p><b>according to the will of God
	and our Father</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "of Him who is at once God
	[the sovereign Creator] and our Father" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:38">John 6:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:18">John 10:18</span>,
	end). Without merit of ours. His sovereignty as "GOD,"
	and our filial relation to Him as "OUR
	FATHER," ought to
	keep us from blending our own legal notions (as the Galatians were
	doing) with His will and plan. This paves the way for his argument.</p>
