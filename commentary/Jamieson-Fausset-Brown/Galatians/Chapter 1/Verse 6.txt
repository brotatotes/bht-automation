<p><b>6.</b> Without the usual expressions
	of thanksgiving for their faith, c., he vehemently plunges into his
	subject, zealous for "the glory" of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), which was being disparaged by the Galatians falling away
	from the pure Gospel of the "grace" of God.

<p><b>I marvel</b>—implying that
	he had hoped better things from them, whence his sorrowful surprise
	at their turning out so different from his expectations. 
	</p>
<p><b>so soon</b>—after my last
	visit when I hoped and thought you were untainted by the Judaizing
	teachers. If this Epistle was written from Corinth, the interval
	would be a little more than three years, which would be "soon"
	to have fallen away, if they were apparently sound at the time of his
	visit. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18">Galatians 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:20">Galatians 4:20</span>
	may imply that he saw no symptom of unsoundness <i>then,</i> such as
	he hears of in them <i>now.</i> But <i>English Version</i> is
	probably not correct there. See see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:20- :">Galatians 4:20- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:20">Galatians 4:20</span>; also see
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:20- :">Galatians 4:20- :</span> If from Ephesus, the
	interval would be not more than one year. BIRKS
	holds the Epistle to have been written from Corinth after his FIRST
	visit to Galatia; for this agrees best with the "so soon"
	here: with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18">Galatians 4:18</span>, "It is
	good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only
	when I am present with you." If they had persevered in the faith
	during three years of his first absence, and only turned aside after
	his second visit, they could not be charged justly with adhering to
	the truth only when he was present: for his first absence was longer
	than both his visits, and they would have obeyed longer in his
	"<i>absence</i>" than in his "<i>presence.</i>"
	But if their decline had begun immediately after he left them, and
	before his return to them, the reproof will be just. But see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18- :">Galatians 4:18- :</span>.

<p><b>removed</b>—Translate, "are
	being removed," that is, ye are <i>suffering yourselves so soon</i>
	(whether from the time of my last visit, or from the time of the
	first temptation held out to you) [PARÆUS]
	<i>to be removed</i> by Jewish seducers. Thus he softens the censure
	by implying that the Galatians were tempted by seducers from without,
	with whom the chief guilt lay: and the present, "ye are <i>being</i>
	removed," implies that their seduction was only in process of
	being effected, not that it was actually effected. WAHL,
	ALFORD, and others take
	the <i>Greek</i> as middle voice. "ye are removing" or
	"passing over." "Shifting your ground" [CONYBEARE
	and HOWSON]. But thus the
	point of Paul's oblique reference to their misleaders is lost; and in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:12">Hebrews 7:12</span> the <i>Greek</i> is
	used passively, justifying its being taken so here. On the
	impulsiveness and fickleness of the Gauls (another form of Kel-t-s,
	the progenitors of the Erse, Gauls, Cymri, and Belgians), whence the
	Galatians sprang, see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:12- :">Hebrews 7:12- :</span>
