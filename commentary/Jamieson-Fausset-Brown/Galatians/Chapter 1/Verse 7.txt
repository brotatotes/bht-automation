<p><b>7. another</b>—A distinct <i>Greek</i>
	word from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>. Though
	I called it a gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>),
	it is not really so. There is really but <i>one</i> Gospel, and no
	<i>other</i> gospel. 
	</p>
<p><b>but</b>—Translate, "Only
	that there are some that trouble you," c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:10">Galatians 5:10</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:12">Galatians 5:12</span>). All I meant by the
	"different gospel" was nothing but a perversion by "some"
	of the one Gospel of Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>would pervert</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"wish to pervert"; they could not really pervert the
	Gospel, though they could pervert Gospel professors (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:9">Galatians 4:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:17">Galatians 4:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:21">Galatians 4:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:12">Galatians 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:13">Galatians 6:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>). Though acknowledging
	Christ, they insisted on circumcision and Jewish ordinances and
	professed to rest on the authority of other apostles, namely, Peter
	and James. But Paul recognizes no gospel, save the pure Gospel.</p>
