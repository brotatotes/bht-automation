<p><b>9. said before</b>—when we were
	visiting you (so "before" means, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:2">Galatians 5:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:3">Galatians 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:21">Galatians 5:21</span>.
	Translate, "If any man <i>preacheth</i> unto you any gospel
	BESIDE that which,"
	c. Observe the indicative, not the subjunctive or conditional mood,
	is used, "preacheth," literally, "furnisheth you with
	any gospel." The <i>fact</i> is assumed, not merely supposed as
	a contingency, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>,
	"preach," or "should preach." This implies that
	he had already observed (namely, during his last visit) the
	machinations of the Judaizing teachers: but his <i>surprise</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8- :">Galatians 1:8- :</span>) <i>now</i> at the Galatians being misled by them, implies
	that they had not apparently been so <i>then.</i> As in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8- :">Galatians 1:8- :</span> he had said, "which we preached," so here, with an
	augmentation of the force, "which ye received"
	acknowledging that they had truly <i>accepted it.</i>

<p><b>accursed</b>—The opposite
	appears in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16">Galatians 6:16</span>.</p>
