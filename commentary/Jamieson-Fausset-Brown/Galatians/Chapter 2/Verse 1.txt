	The same visit to Jerusalem as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> (A.D. 50), when
	the council of the apostles and Church decided that Gentile
	Christians need not be circumcised. His omitting allusion to that
	decree is; (1) Because his <i>design</i> here is to show the
	Galatians his own independent apostolic authority, whence he was not
	likely to support himself by their decision. Thus we see that general
	councils are not above apostles. (2) Because he argues the point upon
	principle, not authoritative decisions. (3) The decree did not go the
	length of the position maintained here: the council did not impose
	Mosaic ordinances; the apostle maintains that the Mosaic institution
	itself is at an end. (4) The Galatians were Judaizing, not because
	the Jewish law was imposed by authority of the Church as <i>necessary
	to Christianity,</i> but because they thought it necessary to be
	observed by those who aspired to <i>higher perfection</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:3">Galatians 3:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:21">Galatians 4:21</span>). The decree would not
	at all disprove their view, and therefore would have been useless to
	quote. Paul meets them by a far more direct confutation, "Christ
	is of <i>no effect</i> unto you whosoever are justified by the law"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:4">Galatians 5:4</span>), [PALEY].
