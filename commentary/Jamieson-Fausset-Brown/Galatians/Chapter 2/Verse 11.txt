<p><b>11. Peter</b>—"Cephas"
	in the oldest manuscripts Paul's withstanding Peter is the strongest
	proof that the former gives of the independence of his apostleship in
	relation to the other apostles, and upsets the Romish doctrine of
	Peter's supremacy. The apostles were not always inspired; but were so
	always in <i>writing</i> the Scriptures. If then the inspired men who
	<i>wrote</i> them were not invariably at other times infallible, much
	less were the uninspired men who kept them. The Christian fathers may
	be trusted generally as witnesses to facts, but not implicitly
	followed in matters of opinion. 
	</p>
<p><b>come to Antioch</b>—then
	the citadel of the Gentile Church: where first the Gospel was
	preached to <i>idolatrous Gentiles,</i> and where the name
	"Christians" was first given (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:20">Acts 11:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26">Acts 11:26</span>), and where Peter is
	said to have been subsequently bishop. The question at Antioch was
	not whether the Gentiles were admissible to the Christian covenant
	without becoming circumcised—that was the question settled at the
	Jerusalem council just before—but whether the Gentile Christians
	were to be admitted to <i>social intercourse with the Jewish
	Christians</i> without conforming to the Jewish institution. The
	Judaizers, soon after the council had passed the resolutions
	recognizing the equal rights of the Gentile Christians, repaired to
	Antioch, the scene of the gathering in of the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26- :">Acts 11:26- :</span>), to witness, what to Jews would look so extraordinary,
	the receiving of men to communion of the Church without circumcision.
	Regarding the proceeding with prejudice, they explained away the
	force of the Jerusalem decision; and probably also desired to watch
	whether the <i>Jewish</i> Christians among the Gentiles violated the
	law, which that decision did not verbally sanction <i>them</i> in
	doing, though giving the Gentiles latitude (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:26- :">Acts 11:26- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>to be blamed</b>—rather,
	"(self)-condemned"; his act at one time condemning his
	contrary acting at another time.</p>
