	James' view (in which he was not infallible, any more than Peter) was
	that the Jewish converts were still to observe Jewish ordinances,
	from which he had decided with the council the <i>Gentiles</i> should
	be free (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:19">Acts 15:19</span>). NEANDER,
	however, may be right in thinking these self-styled delegates from
	James were not really from him. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:19- :">Acts 15:19- :</span> favors this. "Certain from James," may mean
	merely that they came from the Church at Jerusalem under James'
	bishopric. Still James' leanings were to legalism, and this gave him
	his influence with the Jewish party (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:19- :">Acts 15:19- :</span>).

Yet after all, this same Peter, through fear of man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:48- :">Acts 10:48- :</span>), was faithless to his own so distinctly avowed principles
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7-11">Acts 15:7-11</span>). We
	recognize the same old nature in him as led him, after faithfully
	witnessing for Christ, yet for a brief space, to deny Him. "Ever
	the first to recognize, and the first to draw back from great truths"
	[ALFORD]. An undesigned
	coincidence between the Gospels and the Epistle in the consistency of
	character as portrayed in both. It is beautiful to see how earthly
	misunderstandings of Christians are lost in Christ. For in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7-44.15.11- :">Acts 15:7-44.15.11- :</span>, Peter praises the very Epistles of Paul which he knew
	contained his own condemnation. Though apart from one another and
	differing in characteristics, the two apostles were one in Christ.
