<p><b>dissembled likewise</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"joined in hypocrisy," namely, in living as though the law
	were necessary to justification, through fear of man, though they
	knew from God their Christian liberty of eating with Gentiles, and
	had availed themselves of it already (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The case was distinct from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1-10">1 Corinthians 8:1-10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1-23">Romans 14:1-23</span>. It was not a
	question of liberty, and of bearing with others' infirmities, but one
	affecting the essence of the Gospel, whether the Gentiles are to be
	virtually "compelled to live as do the Jews," in order to
	be justified (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:14">Galatians 2:14</span>).

<p><b>Barnabas also</b>—"Even
	Barnabas": one least likely to be led into such an error, being
	with Paul in first preaching to the idolatrous Gentiles: showing the
	power of bad example and numbers. In Antioch, the capital of Gentile
	Christianity and the central point of Christian missions, the
	controversy first arose, and in the same spot it now broke out
	afresh; and here Paul had first to encounter the party that
	afterwards persecuted him in every scene of his labors (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:14- :">Galatians 2:14- :</span>).</p>
