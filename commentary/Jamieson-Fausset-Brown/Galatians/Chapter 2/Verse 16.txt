<p><b>16. not justified by the works of
	the law</b>—as the GROUND
	of justification. "The works of the law" are those which
	have the law for their object—which are wrought to fulfil the law
	[ALFORD]. 
	</p>
<p><b>but by</b>—Translate, "But
	only (in no other way save) <i>through</i> faith <i>in</i> Jesus
	Christ," as the MEAN
	and instrument of justification.

<p><b>Jesus Christ</b>—In the
	second case, read with the oldest manuscripts, "Christ Jesus,"
	the <i>Messiahship</i> coming into prominence in the case of <i>Jewish</i>
	believers, as "Jesus" does in the first case, referring to
	the general proposition.

<p><b>justified by the faith of
	Christ</b>—that is, by Christ, the object of faith, as the ground
	of our justification.

<p><b>for by the works of the law
	shall no flesh be justified</b>—He rests his argument on this as an
	axiom in theology, referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Moses and Jesus Christ; The law and the promise;
	Doing and believing; Works and faith; Wages and the gift; The curse
	and the blessing—are represented as diametrically opposed"
	[BENGEL]. The moral law
	is, in respect to justification, <i>more legal</i> than the
	ceremonial, which was an elementary and preliminary Gospel: So
	"Sinai" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:24">Galatians 4:24</span>),
	which is more famed for the Decalogue than for the ceremonial law, is
	made pre-eminently the type of legal bondage. Thus, justification by
	the law, whether the moral or ceremonial, is excluded (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:24- :">Galatians 4:24- :</span>).</p>
