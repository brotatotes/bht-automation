17. Greek, "But if,
	seeking to be justified IN
	(that is, in believing union with) Christ (who has in the
	Gospel theory fulfilled the law for us), we (you and I) ourselves
	also were found (in your and my former communion
	with Gentiles) sinners (such as from the Jewish standpoint that now
	we resume, we should be regarded, since we have cast aside the law,
	thus having put ourselves in the same category as the Gentiles, who,
	being without the law, are, in the Jewish view, "sinners,"
	Galatians 2:15), is therefore Christ,
	the minister of sin?" (Are we to admit the conclusion, in this
	case inevitable, that Christ having failed to justify us by faith, so
	has become to us the minister of sin, by putting us in the position
	of "sinners," as the Judaic theory, if correct, would make
	us, along with all others who are "without the law,"
	Romans 2:14; 1 Corinthians 9:21;
	and with whom, by eating with them, we have identified ourselves?)
	The Christian mind revolts from so shocking a conclusion, and so,
	from the theory which would result in it. The whole sin lies, not
	with Christ, but with him who would necessitate such a blasphemous
	inference. But his false theory, though "seeking"
	from Christ, we have not "found" salvation (in
	contradiction to Christ's own words, 1 Corinthians 9:21- :), but "have been ourselves also (like the Gentiles)
	found" to be "sinners," by having entered into
	communion with Gentiles (Galatians 2:12).
