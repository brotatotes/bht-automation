<p><b>18.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "For if
	the things which I overthrew (by the faith of Christ), those very
	things I build up again (namely, legal righteousness, by subjecting
	myself to the law), I prove myself (literally, 'I commend myself') a
	transgressor." Instead of commending yourself as you sought to
	do (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:12">Galatians 2:12</span>, end), you merely
	commend yourself as a transgressor. The "I" is intended by
	Paul for <i>Peter</i> to take to himself, as it is <i>his</i> case,
	not Paul's own, that is described. A "transgressor" is
	another word for "sinner" (in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:12- :">Galatians 2:12- :</span>), for "sin is the <i>transgression</i> of the law."
	You, Peter, by now asserting the law to be obligatory, are proving
	yourself a "sinner," or "transgressor," in your
	having set it aside by living as the Gentiles, and with them. Thus
	you are debarred by transgression from justification by the law, and
	you debar yourself from justification by Christ, since in your theory
	He becomes a minister of sin.</p>
