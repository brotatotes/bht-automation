<p><b>19.</b> Here Paul seems to pass from
	his <i>exact words</i> to Peter, to the <i>general purport</i> of his
	argument on the question. However, his direct address to the
	Galatians seems not to be resumed till <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "O foolish Galatians," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>For</b>—But I am not a
	"transgressor" by forsaking the law. "For," &amp;c.
	Proving his indignant denial of the consequence that "Christ is
	the minister of sin" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and of the premises from which it would follow. Christ, so
	far from being the minister of sin and death, is the establisher of
	righteousness and life. I am entirely in Him [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>I</b>—here emphatical. <i>Paul
	himself,</i> not <i>Peter,</i> as in the "I" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>through the law</b>—which
	was my "schoolmaster to bring me to Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) both by its terrors (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:13">Galatians 3:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20">Romans 3:20</span>) driving me to Christ,
	as the refuge from God's wrath against sin, and, when spiritually
	understood, teaching that itself is not permanent, but must give
	place to Christ, whom it prefigures as its scope and end (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:20- :">Romans 3:20- :</span>); and drawing me to Him by its promises (in the prophecies
	which form part of the Old Testament law) of a better righteousness,
	and of God's law written in the heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15-19">Deuteronomy 18:15-19</span>;

<p><b>am dead to the law</b>—literally,
	"I died to the law," and so <i>am</i> dead to it, that is,
	am passed from under its power, in respect to non-justification or
	condemnation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:20">Colossians 2:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:14">Romans 6:14</span>;

	just as a woman, once married and bound to a husband, ceases to be so
	bound to him when death interposes, and may be lawfully married to
	another husband. So by believing union to Christ in His death, we,
	being considered dead with Him, are severed from the law's past power
	over us (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:14">Galatians 6:14</span>;
