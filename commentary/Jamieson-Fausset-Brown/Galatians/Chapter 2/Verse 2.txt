<p><b>2. by revelation</b>—not from
	being absolutely dependent on the apostles at Jerusalem, but by
	independent divine "revelation." Quite consistent with his
	at the same time, being a deputy from the Church of Antioch, as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> states. He by this <i>revelation</i> was led to suggest the
	sending of the deputation. Compare the case of Peter being led by
	vision, and at the same time by Cornelius' messengers, to go to
	Cæsarea, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1-22">Acts 10:1-22</span>.

<p><b>I . . . communicated unto
	them</b>—namely, "to the apostles and elders" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1-44.10.22- :">Acts 10:1-44.10.22- :</span>): to the apostles in particular (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1-44.10.22- :">Acts 10:1-44.10.22- :</span>).

<p><b>privately</b>—that he and
	the apostles at Jerusalem might decide previously on the principles
	to be adopted and set forward before the public council (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1-44.10.22- :">Acts 10:1-44.10.22- :</span>). It was necessary that the Jerusalem apostles should
	know beforehand that the Gospel Paul preached to the Gentiles was the
	same as theirs, and had received divine confirmation in the results
	it wrought on the Gentile converts. He and Barnabas related to the
	<i>multitude,</i> not the nature of the doctrine they preached (as
	Paul did privately to the apostles), but only the miracles vouchsafed
	in <i>proof of</i> God's sanctioning their preaching to the Gentiles
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:12">Acts 15:12</span>).

	"elders"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6">Galatians 2:6</span>,
	"those who seemed to be somewhat."

<p><b>lest,</b> c.—"lest I
	should be running, or have run, in vain" that is, that they
	might see that I am not running, and have not run, in vain. Paul does
	not <i>himself</i> fear lest he be running, or had run, in vain; but
	lest he should, if he gave them no explanation, <i>seem</i> so <i>to
	them.</i> His race was the swift-running proclamation of the Gospel
	to the Gentiles (compare "run," <i>Margin,</i> for "Word
	. . . <i>have free course,</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:6- :">Galatians 2:6- :</span>). His running would have been in vain, had circumcision been
	necessary, since he did not require it of his converts.</p>
