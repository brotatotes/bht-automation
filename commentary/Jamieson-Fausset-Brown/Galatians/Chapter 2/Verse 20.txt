20. I am crucified—literally,
	"I have been crucified with Christ." This more
	particularizes the foregoing. "I am dead" (Galatians 2:19;
	Philippians 3:10). 
	nevertheless I live; yet not
	I—Greek, "nevertheless I live, no longer (indeed)
	I." Though crucified I live; (and this) no longer that old man
	such as I once was (compare Philippians 3:10- :). No longer Saul the Jew (Galatians 5:24;
	Colossians 3:11, but "another man";
	compare 1 Samuel 10:6). ELLICOTT
	and others translate, "And it is no longer I that live,
	but Christ that liveth in me." But the plain antithesis between
	"crucified" and "live," requires the translation,
	"nevertheless." 
	the life which I now live—as
	contrasted with my life before conversion. 
	in the flesh—My life
	seems to be a mere animal life "in the flesh," but this is
	not my true life; "it is but the mask of life under which lives
	another, namely, Christ, who is my true life" [LUTHER].
	I live by the faith,
	&c.—Greek, "IN
	faith (namely), that of (that is, which rests on) the Son of God."
	"In faith," answers by contrast to "in the flesh."
	Faith, not the flesh, is the real element in which I
	live. The phrase, "the Son of God," reminds us that His
	Divine Sonship is the source of His life-giving power. 
	loved me—His eternal
	gratuitous love is the link that unites me to the Son of God, and His
	"giving Himself for me," is the strongest proof of that
	love.
