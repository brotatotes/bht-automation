<p><b>20. I am crucified</b>—literally,
	"I have been crucified with Christ." This more
	particularizes the foregoing. "I am dead" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:19">Galatians 2:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:10">Philippians 3:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>nevertheless I live; yet not
	I</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "nevertheless I live, no longer (indeed)
	I." Though crucified I live; (and this) no longer that old man
	such as I once was (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:10- :">Philippians 3:10- :</span>). No longer Saul the Jew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:24">Galatians 5:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11">Colossians 3:11</span>, but "another man";
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+10:6">1 Samuel 10:6</span>). ELLICOTT
	and others translate, "<i>And</i> it is no longer I that live,
	but Christ that liveth in me." But the plain antithesis between
	"crucified" and "live," requires the translation,
	"nevertheless." 
	</p>
<p><b>the life which I now live</b>—as
	contrasted with my life before conversion. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the flesh</b>—My life
	seems to be a mere animal life "in the flesh," but this is
	not my true life; "it is but the mask of life under which lives
	another, namely, Christ, who is my true life" [LUTHER].
	</p>
<p><b>I live by the faith,</b>
	&amp;c.—<i>Greek,</i> "IN
	faith (namely), that of (that is, which rests on) the Son of God."
	"In faith," answers by contrast to "in the flesh."
	<i>Faith,</i> not <i>the flesh,</i> is the real element in which I
	live. The phrase, "the Son of God," reminds us that His
	Divine Sonship is the source of His life-giving power. 
	</p>
<p><b>loved me</b>—His eternal
	gratuitous love is the link that unites me to the Son of God, and His
	"giving Himself for me," is the strongest proof of that
	love.</p>
