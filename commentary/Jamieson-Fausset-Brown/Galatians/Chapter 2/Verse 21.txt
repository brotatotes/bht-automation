21. I do not frustrate the grace of
	God—I do not make it void, as thou, Peter, art doing by
	Judaizing. 
	for—justifying the
	strong expression "frustrate," or "make void." 
	is dead in vain—Greek,
	"Christ died needlessly," or "without just cause."
	Christ's having died, shows that the law has no power to justify us;
	for if the law can justify or make us righteous, the death of Christ
	is superfluous [CHRYSOSTOM].
