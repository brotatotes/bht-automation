3. Butâ€”So far were they from
	regarding me as running in vain, that "not even Titus who
	was with me, who was a Greek (and therefore uncircumcised),
	was compelled to be circumcised." So the Greek should be
	translated. The "false brethren,"  :- ("certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed,"
	Acts 15:5), demanded his
	circumcision. The apostles, however, constrained by the firmness of
	Paul and Barnabas (Galatians 2:5), did
	not compel or insist on his being circumcised. Thus they virtually
	sanctioned Paul's course among the Gentiles and admitted his
	independence as an apostle: the point he desires to set forth to the
	Galatians. Timothy, on the other hand, as being a proselyte of the
	gate, and son of a Jewess (Galatians 2:5- :), he circumcised (Galatians 2:5- :). Christianity did not interfere with Jewish usages,
	regarded merely as social ordinances, though no longer having their
	religious significance, in the case of Jews and proselytes, while the
	Jewish polity and temple still stood; after the overthrow of the
	latter, those usages naturally ceased. To have insisted on Jewish
	usages for Gentile converts, would have been to make them
	essential parts of Christianity. To have rudely violated them at
	first in the case of Jews, would have been inconsistent with
	that charity which (in matters indifferent) is made all things to all
	men, that by all means it may win some (Galatians 2:5- :; compare Romans 14:1-7;
	Romans 14:13-23). Paul brought
	Titus about with him as a living example of the power of the Gospel
	upon the uncircumcised heathen.
