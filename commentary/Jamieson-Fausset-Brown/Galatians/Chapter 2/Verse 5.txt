<p><b>5.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "To whom
	not even for an hour did we yield by subjection." ALFORD
	renders the <i>Greek</i> article, "<i>with</i> THE
	subjection required of us." The sense rather is, We would
	willingly have yielded for <i>love</i> [BENGEL]
	(if no principle was at issue), but not in the way of <i>subjection,</i>
	where "the truth of the Gospel" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:14">Galatians 2:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>) was at stake (namely,
	the fundamental truth of justification by faith only, without the
	works of the law, contrasted with another Gospel, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5- :">Colossians 1:5- :</span>). Truth precise, unaccommodating, abandons nothing that
	belongs to itself, admits nothing that is inconsistent with it
	[BENGEL].

	liberties, which <i>you</i> are now renouncing.</p>
