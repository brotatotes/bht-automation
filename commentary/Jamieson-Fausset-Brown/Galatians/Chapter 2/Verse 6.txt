<p><b>seemed </b><i><b>to be

	were justly so reputed.

<p><b>in conference added</b>—or
	"imparted"; the same <i>Greek</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "I conferred not with flesh and blood." As I did
	not by conference impart to them aught at my conversion, so they now
	did not impart aught additional to me, above what I already knew.
