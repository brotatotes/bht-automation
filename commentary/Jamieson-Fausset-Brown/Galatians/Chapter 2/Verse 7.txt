	THEY gave in THEIR
	adhesion to the new path on which Barnabas and I, by independent
	revelation, had entered. So far from censuring, they gave a hearty
	approval to my independent course, namely, the innovation of
	preaching the Gospel without circumcision to the Gentiles.

	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1-48">Acts 10:1-48</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7">Acts 15:7</span>).
	But in the ultimate apportionment of the spheres of labor, the Jews
	were assigned to him (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:7- :">Acts 15:7- :</span>). So Paul on the other hand wrote to the Hebrews (compare
	also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:11">Colossians 4:11</span>), though his main
	work was among the Gentiles. The non-mention of Peter in the list of
	names, presciently through the Spirit, given in the sixteenth chapter
	of Romans, shows that Peter's residence at Rome, much more primacy,
	was <i>then</i> unknown. The same is palpable from the sphere here
	assigned to him.</p>
