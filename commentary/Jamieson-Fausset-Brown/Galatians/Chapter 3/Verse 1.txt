	bewitched—fascinated
	you so that you have lost your wits. THEMISTIUS
	says the Galatians were naturally very acute in intellect. Hence,
	Paul wonders they could be so misled in this case. 
	you—emphatical. "You,
	before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been graphically set forth
	(literally, in writing, namely, by vivid portraiture in
	preaching) among you, crucified" (so the sense and Greek
	order require rather than English Version). As Christ was
	"crucified," so ye ought to have been by faith "crucified
	with Christ," and so "dead to the law" (Galatians 2:19;
	Galatians 2:20). Reference to the
	"eyes" is appropriate, as fascination was supposed
	to be exercised through the eyes. The sight of Christ crucified ought
	to have been enough to counteract all fascination.
