<p><b>1. that ye should not obey the
	truth</b>—omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

<p><b>bewitched</b>—fascinated
	you so that you have lost your wits. THEMISTIUS
	says the Galatians were naturally very acute in intellect. Hence,
	Paul wonders they could be so misled in this case. 
	</p>
<p><b>you</b>—emphatical. "You,
	before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been graphically set forth
	(literally, <i>in writing,</i> namely, by vivid <i>portraiture</i> in
	preaching) among you, crucified" (so the sense and <i>Greek</i>
	order require rather than <i>English Version</i>). As Christ was
	"crucified," so ye ought to have been by faith "<i>crucified</i>
	with Christ," and so "dead to the law" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:19">Galatians 2:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>). Reference to the
	"eyes" is appropriate, as <i>fascination</i> was supposed
	to be exercised through the eyes. The sight of Christ crucified ought
	to have been enough to counteract all fascination.</p>
