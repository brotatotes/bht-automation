<p><b>11. by the law</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"IN the law."
	Both <i>in</i> and <i>by</i> are included. The syllogism in this
	verse and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:12">Galatians 3:12</span>, is,
	according to Scripture, "The just shall live by faith." But
	the law is not of faith, but of doing, or works (that is, does not
	make faith, but works, the conditional ground of justifying).
	Therefore "in," or "by the law, no man is justified
	before God" (whatever the case may be <i>before men,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:12- :">Galatians 3:12- :</span>) —not even if he could, which he cannot, keep the law,
	because the Scripture element and conditional mean of justification
	is <i>faith.</i>
</p>
<p><b>The just shall live by faith</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:17">Romans 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="hab+2:4">Habakkuk 2:4</span>).
	Not as BENGEL and ALFORD,
	"He who is just by faith shall live." The <i>Greek</i>
	supports <i>English Version.</i> Also the contrast is between "live
	<i>by faith</i>" (namely, as the ground and source of his
	justification), and "live <i>in them,</i>" namely, in his
	doings or works (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:12">Galatians 3:12</span>), as
	the <i>conditional element wherein</i> he is justified.</p>
