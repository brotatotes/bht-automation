11. by the law—Greek,
	"IN the law."
	Both in and by are included. The syllogism in this
	verse and Galatians 3:12, is,
	according to Scripture, "The just shall live by faith." But
	the law is not of faith, but of doing, or works (that is, does not
	make faith, but works, the conditional ground of justifying).
	Therefore "in," or "by the law, no man is justified
	before God" (whatever the case may be before men, Galatians 3:12- :) —not even if he could, which he cannot, keep the law,
	because the Scripture element and conditional mean of justification
	is faith.
The just shall live by faith—
	(Romans 1:17; Habakkuk 2:4).
	Not as BENGEL and ALFORD,
	"He who is just by faith shall live." The Greek
	supports English Version. Also the contrast is between "live
	by faith" (namely, as the ground and source of his
	justification), and "live in them," namely, in his
	doings or works (Galatians 3:12), as
	the conditional element wherein he is justified.
