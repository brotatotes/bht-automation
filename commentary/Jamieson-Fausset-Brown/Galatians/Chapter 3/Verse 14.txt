<p><b>14.</b> The intent of "Christ
	becoming a curse for us"; "To the end that upon the
	Gentiles the blessing of Abraham (that is, <i>promised to</i>
	Abraham, namely, justification by faith) might come in Christ Jesus"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:8">Galatians 3:8</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that we might receive the
	promise of the Spirit</b>—the promised Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:28">Joel 2:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:29">Joel 2:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:49">Luke 24:49</span>).
	This clause follows not the clause immediately preceding (for <i>our
	receiving the Spirit</i> is not the result of the <i>blessing of
	Abraham coming on the Gentiles</i>), but "Christ hath redeemed
	us," &amp;c. 
	</p>
<p><b>through faith</b>—not by
	works. Here he resumes the thought in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:49- :">Luke 24:49- :</span>. "The Spirit from without, kindles within us some spark
	of faith Whereby we lay hold of Christ, and even of the Spirit
	Himself, that He may dwell within us" [FLACIUS].</p>
