<p><b>15. I speak after the manner of

	everyday occurrence.

<p><b>but a man's covenant</b>—whose
	purpose it is far less important to maintain. 
	</p>
<p><b>if it be confirmed</b>—when
	once it hath been ratified. 
	</p>
<p><b>no man disannulleth</b>—"none
	setteth aside," not even the author himself, much less any
	second party. None does so who acts in common equity. Much less would
	the righteous God do so. <i>The law</i> is here, by personification,
	regarded as a second person, distinct from, and subsequent to, <i>the
	promise of God. The promise</i> is everlasting, and more peculiarly
	belongs to God. <i>The law</i> is regarded as something extraneous,
	afterwards introduced, exceptional and temporary (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17-19">Galatians 3:17-19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:21-24">Galatians 3:21-24</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>addeth</b>—None addeth new
	conditions "making" the covenant "of none effect"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:17">Galatians 3:17</span>). So legal Judaism
	could make no alteration in the fundamental relation between God and
	man, already established by the promises to Abraham; it could not add
	as a new condition the observance of the law, in which case the
	fulfilment of the promise would be attached to a condition impossible
	for man to perform. The "covenant" here is one of free
	grace, a <i>promise</i> afterwards carried into effect in the Gospel.</p>
