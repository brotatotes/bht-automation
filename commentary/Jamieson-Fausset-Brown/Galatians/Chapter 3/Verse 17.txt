	He does not, as in the case of "the covenant," add "enacted

	The dispensation of "the promise" began with the call of
	Abraham from Ur into Canaan, and ended on the last night of his
	grandson Jacob's sojourn in Canaan, the <i>land of promise.</i> The
	dispensation of the law, which engenders bondage, was beginning to
	draw on from the time of his entrance into Egypt, the land of
	bondage. It was to Christ in him, as in his grandfather Abraham, and
	his father Isaac, not to him or them as persons, the promise was
	spoken. On the day following the last repetition of the promise
	orally (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+46:1-6">Genesis 46:1-6</span>), at
	Beer-sheba, Israel passed into Egypt. It is from the end, not from
	the beginning of the dispensation of promise, that the interval of
	four hundred thirty years between it and the law is to be counted. At
	Beer-sheba, after the covenant with Abimelech, Abraham called on the
	everlasting God, and the well was confirmed to him and his seed as an
	everlasting possession. Here God appeared to Isaac. Here Jacob
	received the promise of the blessing, for which God had called
	Abraham out of Ur, repeated for the last time, on the last night of
	his sojourn in the land of promise.
