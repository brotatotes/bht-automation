<p><b>19.</b> "Wherefore then serveth
	the law?" as it is of no avail for justification, is it either
	useless, or contrary to the covenant of God? [CALVIN].
	</p>
<p><b>added</b>—to the original
	covenant of promise. This is not inconsistent with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "No man addeth thereto"; for there the kind of
	<i>addition</i> meant, and therefore denied, is one that would add
	<i>new conditions,</i> inconsistent with the grace of the covenant of
	promise. The law, though misunderstood by the Judaizers as doing so,
	was really added for a different purpose, namely, "because of
	(or as the <i>Greek,</i> 'for the sake of') the transgressions,"
	that is, to bring out into clearer view <i>the transgressions</i> of
	it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:7-9">Romans 7:7-9</span>); to make
	men more fully conscious of their "sins," by being
	perceived as <i>transgressions of the law,</i> and so to make them
	long for the promised Saviour. This accords with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:24">Galatians 3:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>.
	The meaning can hardly be "<i>to check</i> transgressions,"
	for the law rather stimulates the corrupt heart to disobey it
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13">Romans 7:13</span>).

<p><b>till the seed</b>—<i>during
	the period up to the time when the</i> seed came. The law was a
	preparatory dispensation for the Jewish nation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:13- :">Romans 7:13- :</span>; <i>Greek,</i> "the law came in <i>additionally</i> and
	<i>incidentally</i>"), intervening between the promise and its
	fulfilment in Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>come</b>—(Compare "faith
	<i>came,</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23">Galatians 3:23</span>).

<p><b>the promise</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:23- :">Galatians 3:23- :</span>).

<p><b>ordained</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"constituted" or "disposed." 
	</p>
<p><b>by angels</b>—as the
	<i>instrumental enactors</i> of the law [ALFORD]
	God delegated the law to angels as something rather alien to Him and
	severe (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:53">Acts 7:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3">Hebrews 2:3</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3- :">Hebrews 2:3- :</span>, "He came with ten thousands of saints," that is,
	angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:17">Psalms 68:17</span>). He reserved
	"the promise" to Himself and dispensed it according to His
	own goodness. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the hand of a
	mediator</b>—namely, Moses. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+5:5">Deuteronomy 5:5</span>,
	"I stood <i>between</i> the Lord and you": the very
	definition of a mediator. Hence the phrase often recurs, "By the
	hand of Moses." In the giving of the law, the "angels"
	were representatives of God; Moses, as mediator, represented the
	people.</p>
