<p><b>21.</b> "Is the <i>law</i>
	(which involves a mediator) against the promises of God (which are
	without a mediator, and <i>rest on God</i> alone and immediately)?
	God forbid." 
	</p>
<p><b>life</b>â€”The law, as an
	externally prescribed rule, can never internally impart spiritual
	life to men naturally dead in sin, and change the disposition. If the
	law had been a law capable of giving <i>life,</i> "verily (in
	very reality, and not in the mere fancy of legalists) righteousness
	would have been by the law (for where life is, there righteousness,
	its <i>condition,</i> must also be)." But the law does not
	<i>pretend</i> to give life, and therefore not righteousness; so
	there is no opposition between the law and the promise. Righteousness
	can only come through the promise to Abraham, and through its
	fulfilment in the Gospel of grace.</p>
