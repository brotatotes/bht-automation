<p><b>22. But</b>—as the law cannot give
	life or righteousness [ALFORD].
	Or the "But" means, So far is <i>righteousness</i> from
	being of the law, that the <i>knowledge of sin</i> is rather what
	comes of the law [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>the scripture</b>—which
	began to be written after the time of the promise, at the time when
	the law was given. The <i>written</i> letter was needed SO as
	PERMANENTLY to convict man
	of disobedience to God's command. Therefore he says, "the
	Scripture," not the "Law." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Scripture," for "the God of the Scripture."
	</p>
<p><b>concluded</b>—"shut
	up," under condemnation, as in a prison. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "As prisoners gathered in the pit and shut up in the
	prison." Beautifully contrasted with "the liberty wherewith
	Christ makes free," which follows, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span>;
