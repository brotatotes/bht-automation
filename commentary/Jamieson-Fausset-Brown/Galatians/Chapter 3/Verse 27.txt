<p><b>have put on Christ</b>—Ye
	<i>did, in that very act</i> of being baptized into Christ, <i>put
	on,</i> or clothe yourselves with, Christ: so the <i>Greek</i>
	expresses. Christ is to you the <i>toga virilis</i> (the Roman
	garment of the full-grown man, assumed when ceasing to be a child)
	[BENGEL]. GATAKER
	defines a Christian, "One who has put on Christ." The
	argument is, By baptism ye have put on Christ; and therefore, He
	being the Son of God, ye become sons by adoption, by virtue of His
	Sonship by generation. This proves that baptism, <i>where it answers
	to its ideal,</i> is not a mere empty sign, but a means of spiritual
	transference from the state of legal condemnation to that of living
	union with Christ, and of sonship through Him in relation to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Christ alone can, by baptizing with His Spirit, make the
	inward grace correspond to the outward sign. But as He promises the
	blessing in the faithful use of the means, the Church has rightly
	presumed, in charity, that such is the case, nothing appearing to the
	contrary.</p>
