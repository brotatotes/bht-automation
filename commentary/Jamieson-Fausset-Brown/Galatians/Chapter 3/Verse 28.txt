<p><b>28.</b> There is in this sonship by
	faith in Christ, no class privileged above another, as the Jews under
	the law had been above the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:12">Romans 10:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:13">1 Corinthians 12:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11">Colossians 3:11</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>bond nor free</b>—Christ
	alike belongs to both by faith; whence he puts "bond"
	<i>before</i> "free." Compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11- :">Colossians 3:11- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11- :">Colossians 3:11- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>neither male nor
	female</b>—rather, as <i>Greek,</i> "there is <i>not</i> male
	<i>and</i> female." There is no distinction into male and
	female. Difference of sex makes no difference in Christian
	privileges. But under the law the male sex had great privileges.
	Males alone had in their body circumcision, the sign of the covenant
	(contrast <i>baptism</i> applied to male and female alike); they
	alone were capable of being kings and priests, whereas all of either
	sex are now "kings and priests unto God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11- :">Colossians 3:11- :</span>); they had prior right to inheritances. In the resurrection
	the relation of the sexes shall cease (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11- :">Colossians 3:11- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>one</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "one
	man"; masculine, not neuter, namely "one new man" in
	Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:15">Ephesians 2:15</span>).</p>
