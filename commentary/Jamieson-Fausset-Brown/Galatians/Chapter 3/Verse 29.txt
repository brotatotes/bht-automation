29. and heirsâ€”The oldest
	manuscripts omit "and." Christ is "Abraham's seed"
	(Galatians 3:16): ye are "one in
	Christ" (Galatians 3:28), and one
	with Christ, as having "put on Christ" (Galatians 3:28- :); therefore YE
	are "Abraham's seed," which is tantamount to saying (whence
	the "and" is omitted), ye are "heirs according to the
	promise" (not "by the law," Galatians 3:28- :); for it was to Abraham's seed that the inheritance was
	promised (Galatians 3:16). Thus he
	arrives at the same truth which he set out with (Galatians 3:16- :). But one new "seed" of a righteous succession
	could be found. One single faultless grain of human nature was found
	by God Himself, the source of a new and imperishable seed: "the
	seed" (Psalms 22:30) who
	receive from Him a new nature and name (Genesis 3:15;
	Isaiah 53:10; Isaiah 53:11;
	John 12:24). In Him the lineal
	descent from David becomes extinct. He died without posterity. But He
	lives and shall reign on David's throne. No one has a legal claim to
	sit upon it but Himself, He being the only living direct
	representative (Ezekiel 21:27).
	His spiritual seed derive their birth from the travail of His soul,
	being born again of His word, which is the incorruptible seed
	(John 1:12; Romans 9:8;
	1 Peter 1:23).
