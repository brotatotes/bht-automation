<p><b>29. and heirs</b>â€”The oldest
	manuscripts omit "and." Christ is "Abraham's seed"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>): ye are "one in
	Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28">Galatians 3:28</span>), and one
	with Christ, as having "put on Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28- :">Galatians 3:28- :</span>); therefore YE
	are "Abraham's seed," which is tantamount to saying (whence
	the "and" is omitted), ye are "heirs according to the
	<i>promise</i>" (not "by the <i>law,</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:28- :">Galatians 3:28- :</span>); for it was to Abraham's seed that the inheritance was
	promised (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>). Thus he
	arrives at the same truth which he set out with (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16- :">Galatians 3:16- :</span>). But one new "seed" of a righteous succession
	could be found. One single faultless grain of human nature was found
	by God Himself, the source of a new and imperishable seed: "the
	seed" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:30">Psalms 22:30</span>) who
	receive from Him a new nature and name (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:10">Isaiah 53:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:11">Isaiah 53:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:24">John 12:24</span>). In Him the lineal
	descent from David becomes extinct. He died without posterity. But He
	lives and shall reign on David's throne. No one has a legal claim to
	sit upon it but Himself, He being the only living direct
	representative (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+21:27">Ezekiel 21:27</span>).
	His spiritual seed derive their birth from the travail of His soul,
	being born again of His word, which is the incorruptible seed
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:12">John 1:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:8">Romans 9:8</span>;
