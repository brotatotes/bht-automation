<p><b>in the Spirit</b>—Not
	merely was Christ crucified "graphically set forth" in my
	preaching, but also "the Spirit" confirmed the word
	preached, by imparting His spiritual gifts. "Having thus begun"
	with the receiving His <i>spiritual</i> gifts, "are ye now <i>being</i>
	made perfect" (so the <i>Greek</i>), that is, are ye <i>seeking</i>
	to be made perfect with "fleshly" ordinances of the law?
	[ESTIUS]. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28">Romans 2:28</span>;

	Having begun in the Spirit, that is, the Holy Spirit ruling your
	spiritual life as its "essence and active principle"
	[ELLICOTT], in contrast to
	"the flesh," the element in which the law works [ALFORD].
	Having begun your Christianity in the Spirit, that is, in the divine
	life that proceeds from faith, are ye seeking after something higher
	still (the perfecting of your Christianity) in the sensuous and the
	earthly, which cannot possibly elevate the inner life of the Spirit,
	namely, outward ceremonies? [NEANDER].
	No doubt the Galatians thought that they were going more deeply into
	the Spirit; for the flesh may be easily mistaken for the Spirit, even
	by those who have made progress, unless they continue to maintain a
	pure faith [BENGEL].</p>
