<p><b>4. Have ye suffered so many
	things</b>—namely, persecution from Jews and from unbelieving
	fellow countrymen, incited by the Jews, at the time of your
	conversion. 
	</p>
<p><b>in vain</b>—<i>fruitlessly,
	needlessly,</i> since ye might have avoided them by professing
	Judaism [GROTIUS]. Or,
	shall ye, by falling from grace, lose the reward promised for all
	your sufferings, so that they shall be "in vain" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:11">Galatians 4:11</span>;

<p><b>yet</b>—rather, "If it
	be <i>really</i> (or 'indeed') in vain" [ELLICOTT].
	"If, as it must be, what I have said, 'in vain,' is really the
	fact" [ALFORD]. I
	prefer understanding it as a mitigation of the preceding words. I
	hope better things of you, for I trust you will return from legalism
	to grace; if <i>so,</i> as I confidently expect, you will not have
	"suffered so many things in vain" [ESTIUS].
	For "God has given you the Spirit and has wrought mighty works
	among you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:32-36">Hebrews 10:32-36</span>)
