<p><b>6.</b> The answer to the question in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:5">Galatians 3:5</span> is here taken for
	granted, <i>It was by the hearing of faith:</i> following this up, he
	says, "Even as Abraham <i>believed,</i>" c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:4-6">Genesis 15:4-6</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>). God supplies unto you
	the Spirit as the result of faith, not works, just as Abraham
	obtained justification by faith, not by works (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:6">Galatians 3:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:8">Galatians 3:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:22">Galatians 4:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:28">Galatians 4:28</span>). Where justification
	is, there the Spirit is, so that if the former comes <i>by faith,</i>
	the latter must also.</p>
