6. The answer to the question in
	Galatians 3:5 is here taken for
	granted, It was by the hearing of faith: following this up, he
	says, "Even as Abraham believed," c. (Genesis 15:4-6
Romans 4:3). God supplies unto you
	the Spirit as the result of faith, not works, just as Abraham
	obtained justification by faith, not by works (Galatians 3:6;
	Galatians 3:8; Galatians 3:16;
	Galatians 4:22; Galatians 4:26;
	Galatians 4:28). Where justification
	is, there the Spirit is, so that if the former comes by faith,
	the latter must also.
