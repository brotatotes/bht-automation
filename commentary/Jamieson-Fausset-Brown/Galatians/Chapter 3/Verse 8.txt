<p><b>8. And</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Moreover." 
	</p>
<p><b>foreseeing</b>—One great
	excellency of Scripture is, that in it all points liable ever to be
	controverted, are, with prescient wisdom, decided in the most
	appropriate language. 
	</p>
<p><b>would justify</b>—rather,
	"justifieth." Present indicative. It is now, and at all
	times, God's <i>one</i> way of justification. 
	</p>
<p><b>the heathen</b>—rather,
	"the Gentiles"; or "the nations," as the same
	<i>Greek</i> is translated at the end of the verse. God justifieth
	the <i>Jews,</i> too, "by faith, not by works." But he
	specifies <i>the Gentiles</i> in particular here, as it was <i>their</i>
	case that was in question, the Galatians being Gentiles. 
	</p>
<p><b>preached before the
	gospel</b>—"announced beforehand the Gospel." For the
	"promise" was substantially the Gospel by anticipation.
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:56">John 8:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span>.
	A proof that "the old fathers did not look only for transitory
	promises" [Article VII, Church of England]. Thus the Gospel, in
	its essential germ, is older than the law though the full development
	of the former is subsequent to the latter. 
	</p>
<p><b>In thee</b>—not "in
	thy seed," which is a point not here raised; but strictly "in
	thee," as followers of thy faith, it having first shown the way
	to justification before God [ALFORD];
	or "in thee," as Father of the promised seed, namely,
	Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>), who is the
	Object of faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:18">Genesis 22:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+72:17">Psalms 72:17</span>), and imitating thy
	faith (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:9">Galatians 3:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>all nations</b>—or as
	above, "all <i>the Gentiles</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:3">Genesis 12:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+18:18">Genesis 18:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:18">Genesis 22:18</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>be blessed</b>—an act of
	grace, not something earned by works. The blessing of justification
	was to Abraham by faith in the promise, not by works. So to those who
	follow Abraham, the father of the faithful, the blessing, that is,
	justification, comes purely by faith in Him who is the subject of the
	promise.</p>
