<p><b>10.</b> To regard the observance of
	certain days as in itself meritorious as a work, is alien to the free
	spirit of Christianity. This is not incompatible with observing the
	Sabbath or the Christian Lord's day as obligatory, though <i>not as a
	work</i> (which was the Jewish and Gentile error in the observance of
	days), but as a holy mean appointed by the Lord for attaining the
	great end, holiness. The whole life alike belongs to the Lord in the
	Gospel view, just as the whole world, and not the Jews only, belong
	to Him. But as in Paradise, so now one portion of time is needed
	wherein to draw off the soul more entirely from secular business to
	God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:16">Colossians 2:16</span>). "Sabbaths,
	new moons, and set feasts" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+23:31">1 Chronicles 23:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+31:3">2 Chronicles 31:3</span>), answer to "days,
	months, times." "Months," however, may refer to the
	<i>first</i> and <i>seventh</i> months, which were sacred on account
	of the number of feasts in them. 
	</p>
<p><b>times</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"seasons," namely, those of the three great feasts, the
	Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. 
	</p>
<p><b>years</b>—The sabbatical
	year was about the time of writing this Epistle, A.D.
	48 [BENGEL].</p>
