<p><b>14. my temptation</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "your temptation." My infirmity, which
	was, or might have been, a "temptation," or <i>trial, to
	you,</i> ye despised not, that is, ye were not tempted by it to
	despise me and my message. Perhaps, however, it is better to
	punctuate and explain as LACHMANN,
	connecting it with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:13">Galatians 4:13</span>,
	"And (ye know) your temptation (that is, the temptation to which
	ye were exposed through the infirmity) which was in my flesh. Ye
	despised not (through <i>natural</i> pride), nor rejected (through
	<i>spiritual</i> pride), but received me," &amp;c. "Temptation
	does not mean here, as we now use the word, <i>tendency to an evil
	habit,</i> but BODILY TRIAL."
	</p>
<p><b>as an angel of God</b>—as a
	heaven-inspired and sent <i>messenger</i> from God: <i>angel</i>
	means "messenger" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:13- :">Galatians 4:13- :</span>). Compare the phrase, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:13- :">Galatians 4:13- :</span>, a Hebrew and Oriental one for a person to be received with
	the highest respect (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:8">Zechariah 12:8</span>).
	An angel is free from the <i>flesh, infirmity,</i> and <i>temptation.</i>
</p>
<p><b>as Christ</b>—being
	Christ's representative (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:8- :">Zechariah 12:8- :</span>). Christ is Lord of angels.</p>
