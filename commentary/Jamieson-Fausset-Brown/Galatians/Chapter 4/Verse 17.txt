<p><b>17. They</b>—your flatterers: in
	contrast to Paul himself, who <i>tells</i> them <i>the truth.</i>

<p><b>zealously</b>—zeal in
	proselytism was characteristic especially of the Jews, and so of
	Judaizers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:14">Galatians 1:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:15">Matthew 23:15</span>;

<p><b>they would exclude you</b>—"They
	wish to shut you out" from the kingdom of God (that is, they
	wish to persuade you that as uncircumcised Gentiles, you are shut out
	from it), "that ye <i>may zealously court them,</i>" that
	is, become circumcised, as zealous followers of themselves. ALFORD
	explains it, that their wish was to shut out the Galatians from the
	general community, and attract them as a separate clique to their own
	party. So the English word "exclusive," is used.</p>
