<p><b>18. good to be zealously
	affected</b>—rather, to correspond to "zealously court"
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18">Galatians 4:18</span>, "to be
	zealously courted." I do not find fault with them for zealously
	courting you, nor with you for being <i>zealously courted:</i>
	provided it be "in a good cause" (translate so), "it
	is a good thing" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18- :">Galatians 4:18- :</span>). My reason for saying the "not well" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18- :">Galatians 4:18- :</span>; the <i>Greek</i> is the same as that for "good,"
	and "in a good cause," in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:18- :">Galatians 4:18- :</span>), is that their <i>zealous courting of you</i> is not in a
	good cause. The older interpreters, however, support <i>English
	Version</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:14">Galatians 1:14</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>always</b>—Translate and
	arrange the words thus, "<i>At all times,</i> and not only when
	I am present with you." I do not desire that <i>I</i>
	exclusively should have the privilege of zealously courting you.
	Others may do so in my absence with my full approval, if only it be
	in a good cause, and if Christ be faithfully preached (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:14- :">Galatians 1:14- :</span>).</p>
