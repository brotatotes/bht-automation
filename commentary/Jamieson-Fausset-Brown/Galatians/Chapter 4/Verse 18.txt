18. good to be zealously
	affected—rather, to correspond to "zealously court"
	in Galatians 4:18, "to be
	zealously courted." I do not find fault with them for zealously
	courting you, nor with you for being zealously courted:
	provided it be "in a good cause" (translate so), "it
	is a good thing" (Galatians 4:18- :). My reason for saying the "not well" (Galatians 4:18- :; the Greek is the same as that for "good,"
	and "in a good cause," in Galatians 4:18- :), is that their zealous courting of you is not in a
	good cause. The older interpreters, however, support English
	Version (compare Galatians 1:14). 
	always—Translate and
	arrange the words thus, "At all times, and not only when
	I am present with you." I do not desire that I
	exclusively should have the privilege of zealously courting you.
	Others may do so in my absence with my full approval, if only it be
	in a good cause, and if Christ be faithfully preached (Galatians 1:14- :).
