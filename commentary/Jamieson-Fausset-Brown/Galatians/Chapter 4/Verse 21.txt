	After having sufficiently maintained his point by argument, the
	apostle confirms and illustrates it by an inspired allegorical
	exposition of historical facts, containing in them general laws and
	types. Perhaps his reason for using allegory was to confute the
	Judaizers with their own weapons: subtle, mystical, allegorical
	interpretations, unauthorized by the Spirit, were their favorite
	arguments, as of the Rabbins in the synagogues. Compare the <i>Jerusalem</i>
	Talmud [<i>Tractatu Succa, cap. Hechalil</i>]. Paul meets them with
	an allegorical exposition, not the work of fancy, but sanctioned by
	the Holy Spirit. History, if properly understood contains in its
	complicated phenomena, simple and <i>continually recurring divine
	laws.</i> The history of the elect people, like their legal
	ordinances, had, besides the literal, a typical meaning (compare

	Just as the extra-ordinarily-born Isaac, the gift of grace according
	to promise, supplanted, beyond all human calculations, the
	naturally-born Ishmael, so the new theocratic race, the spiritual
	seed of Abraham by promise, the Gentile, as well as Jewish believers,
	were about to take the place of the natural seed, who had imagined
	that to them exclusively belonged the kingdom of God.</p>
