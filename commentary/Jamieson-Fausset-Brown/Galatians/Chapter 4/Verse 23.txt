23. after the fleshâ€”born
	according to the usual course of nature: in contrast to Isaac, who
	was born "by virtue of the promise" (so the Greek),
	as the efficient cause of Sarah's becoming pregnant out of the course
	of nature (Romans 4:19). Abraham
	was to lay aside all confidence in the flesh (after which
	Ishmael was born), and to live by faith alone in the promise
	(according to which Isaac was miraculously born, contrary to all
	calculations of flesh and blood).
