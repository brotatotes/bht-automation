<p><b>23. after the flesh</b>â€”born
	according to the usual course of nature: in contrast to Isaac, who
	was born "by virtue of <i>the</i> promise" (so the <i>Greek</i>),
	as the efficient cause of Sarah's becoming pregnant out of the course
	of nature (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:19">Romans 4:19</span>). Abraham
	was to lay aside all confidence in <i>the flesh</i> (after which
	Ishmael was born), and to live by faith alone in <i>the promise</i>
	(according to which Isaac was miraculously born, contrary to all
	calculations of flesh and blood).</p>
