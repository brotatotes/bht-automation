	<i>word,</i> Hagar, is (imports) Mount Sinai in Arabia (that is,
	among the Arabians—<i>in the Arabian tongue</i>)." So
	CHRYSOSTOM explains.
	Haraut, the traveller, says that to this day the Arabians call Sinai,
	"Hadschar," that is, <i>Hagar,</i> meaning <i>a rock</i> or
	<i>stone.</i> Hagar twice fled into the desert of Arabia (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+16:1-16">Genesis 16:1-16</span>;

	mountain and city took its name, and the people were called
	Hagarenes. Sinai, with its rugged rocks, far removed from the

	manuscripts read, "<i>For</i> she is in bondage." As Hagar
	was in bondage to her mistress, so Jerusalem that now is, is in
	bondage to the law, and also to the Romans: her civil state thus
	being in accordance with her spiritual state [BENGEL].</p>
