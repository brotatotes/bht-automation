27. ( :-). 
	thou barren—Jerusalem
	above: the spiritual Church of the Gospel, the fruit of "the
	promise," answering to Sarah, who bore not "after
	the flesh": as contrasted with the law, answering to Hagar, who
	was fruitful in the ordinary course of nature. Isaiah speaks
	primarily of Israel's restoration after her long-continued
	calamities; but his language is framed by the Holy Spirit so as to
	reach beyond this to the spiritual Zion: including not only the Jews,
	the natural descendants of Abraham and children of the law, but also
	the Gentiles. The spiritual Jerusalem is regarded as "barren"
	while the law trammeled Israel, for she then had no spiritual
	children of the Gentiles. 
	break forth—into
	crying. 
	cry—shout for joy. 
	many more—Translate as
	Greek, "Many are the children of the desolate (the New
	Testament Church made up in the greater part from the Gentiles, who
	once had not the promise, and so was destitute of God as her
	husband), more than of her which hath an (Greek, 'THE')
	husband (the Jewish Church having GOD
	for her husband, Isaiah 54:5;
	Jeremiah 2:2)." Numerous as were
	the children of the legal covenant, those of the Gospel covenant are
	more so. The force of the Greek article is, "Her who has
	THE husband of which the
	other is destitute."
