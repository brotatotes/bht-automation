<p><b>thou barren</b>—Jerusalem
	above: the spiritual Church of the Gospel, the fruit of "the
	promise," answering to <i>Sarah,</i> who bore not "after
	the flesh": as contrasted with the law, answering to Hagar, who
	was fruitful in the ordinary course of nature. Isaiah speaks
	primarily of Israel's restoration after her long-continued
	calamities; but his language is framed by the Holy Spirit so as to
	reach beyond this to the spiritual Zion: including not only the Jews,
	the natural descendants of Abraham and children of the law, but also
	<i>the Gentiles.</i> The spiritual Jerusalem is regarded as "barren"
	while the law trammeled Israel, for she then had no spiritual
	children of the Gentiles.

	<i>Greek,</i> "Many are the children of the desolate (the New
	Testament Church made up in the greater part from the Gentiles, <i>who
	once had not the promise,</i> and so was destitute of God as her
	husband), more than of her which hath an (<i>Greek,</i> 'THE')
	husband (the Jewish Church having GOD
	for her <i>husband,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+54:5">Isaiah 54:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+2:2">Jeremiah 2:2</span>)." Numerous as were
	the children of the legal covenant, those of the Gospel covenant are
	more so. The force of the <i>Greek</i> article is, "Her who has
	THE husband of which the
	other is destitute."</p>
