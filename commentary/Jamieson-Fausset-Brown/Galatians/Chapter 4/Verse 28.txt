<p><b>28. we</b>—The oldest manuscripts
	and versions are divided between "we" and "ye."
	"We" better accords with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "mother of <i>us.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>children of promise</b>—not
	children <i>after the flesh,</i> but through the promise (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:23">Galatians 4:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:29">Galatians 4:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:31">Galatians 4:31</span>).
	"We <i>are</i>" so, and ought to wish to continue so.</p>
