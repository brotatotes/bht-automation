29. persecuted—Ishmael
	"mocked" Isaac, which contained in it the germ and spirit
	of persecution (Genesis 21:9). His
	mocking was probably directed against Isaac's piety and faith in
	God's promises. Being the older by natural birth, he haughtily prided
	himself above him that was born by promise: as Cain hated Abel's
	piety. 
	him . . . born after the
	Spirit—The language, though referring primarily to Isaac, born
	in a spiritual way (namely, by the promise or word of God, rendered
	by His Spirit efficient out of the course of nature, in making Sarah
	fruitful in old age), is so framed as especially to refer to
	believers justified by Gospel grace through faith, as opposed to
	carnal men, Judaizers, and legalists.

	(Galatians 5:11; Galatians 6:12;
	Galatians 6:17; Acts 9:29;
	Acts 13:45; Acts 13:49;
	Acts 13:50; Acts 14:1;
	Acts 14:2; Acts 14:19;
	Acts 17:5; Acts 17:13;
	Acts 18:5; Acts 18:6).
	The Jews persecuted Paul, not for preaching Christianity in
	opposition to heathenism, but for preaching it as distinct from
	Judaism. Except in the two cases of Philippi and Ephesus (where the
	persons beginning the assault were pecuniarily interested in his
	expulsion), he was nowhere set upon by the Gentiles, unless they were
	first stirred up by the Jews. The coincidence between Paul's Epistles
	and Luke's history (the Acts) in this respect, is plainly undesigned,
	and so a proof of genuineness (see PALEY,
	Horæ Paulinæ).
