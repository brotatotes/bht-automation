	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:12">Genesis 21:12</span>, where Sarah's words
	are, "shall not be heir with <i>my son, even with Isaac.</i>"
	But what was there said literally, is here by inspiration expressed
	in its allegorical spiritual import, applying to the New Testament
	believer, who is antitypically "the son of the free woman."
	In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:35">John 8:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:36">John 8:36</span>,
	Jesus refers to this.

<p><b>Cast out</b>—from the house
	and inheritance: literally, Ishmael; spiritually, the carnal and
	legalists.

<p><b>shall not be heir</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> is stronger, "<i>must not</i> be heir," or
	"inherit."</p>
