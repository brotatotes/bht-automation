<p><b>31. So then</b>â€”The oldest
	manuscripts read, "Wherefore." This is the conclusion
	inferred from what precedes. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:29">Galatians 3:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span>, it was established that
	we, New Testament believers, are "heirs." If, then, we are
	heirs, "we are not children of the bond woman (whose son,
	according to Scripture, was 'not to be heir,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7- :">Galatians 4:7- :</span>), but of the free woman (whose son was, according to
	Scripture, to be heir). For we are not "cast out" as
	Ishmael, but accepted as sons and heirs.</p>
