<p><b>then</b>—when ye were

<p><b>ye knew not God</b>—not
	opposed to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21">Romans 1:21</span>. The heathen
	<i>originally knew</i> God, as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21- :">Romans 1:21- :</span> states, but did not choose to retain God in their knowledge,
	and so corrupted the original truth. They <i>might</i> still <i>have</i>
	known Him, in a measure, from His works, but as a matter of fact they
	knew Him not, so far as His eternity, His power as the Creator, and
	His holiness, are concerned.

<p><b>are no gods</b>—that is,
	have no existence, such as their worshippers attribute to them, in
	the nature of things, but only in the corrupt imaginations of their
	worshippers (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21- :">Romans 1:21- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:21- :">Romans 1:21- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+13:9">2 Chronicles 13:9</span>). Your
	"service" was a different bondage from that of the Jews,
	which was a true service. Yet theirs, like yours, was a burdensome
	yoke; how then is it ye wish to resume the yoke after that God has
	transferred both Jews and Gentiles to a free service?</p>
