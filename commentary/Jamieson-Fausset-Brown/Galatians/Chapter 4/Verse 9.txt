9. known God or rather are known of
	God—They did not first know and love God, but God
	first, in His electing love, knew and loved them as His, and
	therefore attracted them to the saving knowledge of Him (Matthew 7:23;
	1 Corinthians 8:3; 2 Timothy 2:19;
	compare Exodus 33:12; Exodus 33:17;
	John 15:16; Philippians 3:12).
	God's great grace in this made their fall from it the more heinous.

	indignant wonder at such a thing being possible, and even actually

	weak—powerless to
	justify: in contrast to the justifying power of faith (Galatians 1:6- :; compare Hebrews 7:18). 
	beggarly—contrasted

	afresh, to be in bondage." Though the Galatians, as
	Gentiles, had never been under the Mosaic yoke, yet they had been
	under "the elements of the world" (Hebrews 7:18- :): the common designation for the Jewish and Gentile systems
	alike, in contrast to the Gospel (however superior the Jewish was to
	the Gentile). Both systems consisted in outward worship and cleaved
	to sensible forms. Both were in bondage to the elements of sense,
	as though these could give the justification and sanctification which
	the inner and spiritual power of God alone could bestow. 
	ye desire—or "will."
	Will-worship is not acceptable to God (Colossians 2:18;
	Colossians 2:23).
