<p><b>9. known God or rather are known of
	God</b>—<i>They</i> did not first know and love God, but <i>God</i>
	first, in His electing love, knew and loved them as His, and
	therefore attracted them to the saving knowledge of Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span>;

	God's great grace in this made their fall from it the more heinous.

<p><b>how</b>—expressing
	indignant wonder at such a thing being possible, and even actually
	occurring (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>). "How is
	it that ye turn back again?" 
	</p>
<p><b>weak</b>—powerless to
	<i>justify:</i> in contrast to the justifying power of faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6- :">Galatians 1:6- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18">Hebrews 7:18</span>).

<p><b>beggarly</b>—contrasted
	with the <i>riches</i> of the inheritance of believers in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18- :">Hebrews 7:18- :</span>). The state of the "child" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18- :">Hebrews 7:18- :</span>) is weak, as not having attained manhood; "beggarly,"
	as not having attained the inheritance.

<p><b>elements</b>—"rudiments."
	It is as if a schoolmaster should go back to learning the A, B, C'S
	[BENGEL].

<p><b>again</b>—There are two
	<i>Greek</i> words in the original. "Ye desire again, <i>beginning
	afresh,</i> to be in bondage." Though the Galatians, as
	Gentiles, had never been under the Mosaic yoke, yet they had been
	under "the elements of the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18- :">Hebrews 7:18- :</span>): the common designation for the Jewish and Gentile systems
	alike, in contrast to the Gospel (however superior the Jewish was to
	the Gentile). Both systems consisted in outward worship and cleaved
	to sensible forms. Both were in bondage to <i>the elements of sense,</i>
	as though these could give the justification and sanctification which
	the inner and spiritual power of God alone could bestow. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye desire</b>—or "will."
	<i>Will-worship</i> is not acceptable to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>;
