 CHAPTER 5 
	
 :-. PERORATION.
	EXHORTATION TO STAND
	FAST IN THE GOSPEL
	LIBERTY, JUST
	SET FORTH,
	AND NOT TO BE
	LED BY JUDAIZERS
	INTO CIRCUMCISION, OR
	LAW JUSTIFICATION:
	YET THOUGH FREE,
	TO SERVE ONE
	ANOTHER BY LOVE:
	TO WALK
	IN THE SPIRIT,
	BEARING THE FRUIT
	THEREOF, NOT
	IN THE WORKS OF THE
	FLESH.
