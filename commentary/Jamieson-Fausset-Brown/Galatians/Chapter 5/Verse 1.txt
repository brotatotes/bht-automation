1. The oldest manuscripts read,
	"in liberty (so ALFORD,
	MOBERLEY, HUMPHRY,
	and ELLICOTT. But as there
	is no Greek for 'in,' as there is in translating in 1 Corinthians 16:13;
	Philippians 1:27; Philippians 4:1,
	I prefer 'It is FOR
	freedom that') Christ hath made us free (not in, or for,
	a state of bondage). Stand fast, therefore, and be not entangled
	again in a yoke of bondage" (namely, the law, Galatians 4:24;
	Acts 15:10). On "again,"
	see on Galatians 4:9.
