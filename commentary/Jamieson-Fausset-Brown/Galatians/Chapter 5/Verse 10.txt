<p><b>10.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "I
	(emphatical: '<i>I on my part</i>') have confidence in the Lord <i>with
	regard to you</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:4">2 Thessalonians 3:4</span>),
	that ye will be none otherwise minded" (than what by this
	Epistle I desire you to be, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:4- :">2 Thessalonians 3:4- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>but he that troubleth you</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:24">Acts 15:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jos+7:25">Joshua 7:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:17">1 Kings 18:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:18">1 Kings 18:18</span>). Some one, probably,
	was prominent among the seducers, though the denunciation applies to
	them all (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:17">Galatians 4:17</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>shall bear</b>—as a heavy
	burden. 
	</p>
<p><b>his</b>—<i>his due and
	inevitable</i> judgment from God. Paul distinguishes the case of the
	seduced, who were misled through thoughtlessness, and who, now that
	they are set right by him, he confidently hopes, in God's goodness,
	will return to the right way, from that of the seducer who is doomed
	to judgment. 
	</p>
<p><b>whosoever he be</b>—whether
	great (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>) or small.</p>
