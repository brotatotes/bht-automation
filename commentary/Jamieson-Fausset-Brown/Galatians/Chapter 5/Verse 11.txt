	still preaching (as I did before conversion) circumcision, why am I

	said, "Paul himself preaches circumcision," as is shown by
	his having circumcised Timothy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Paul replies by anticipation of their objection, As
	regards myself, the fact that I am still persecuted by the Jews shows
	plainly that I do <i>not</i> preach circumcision; for it is just
	because I preach Christ crucified, and not the Mosaic law, as the
	sole ground of justification, that they persecute me. If for

	Circumcision, or uncircumcision, are things indifferent in
	themselves: their lawfulness or unlawfulness depends on the <i>animus</i>
	of him who uses them. The Gentile Galatians' animus in circumcision
	could only be their supposition that it influenced favorably their
	standing before God. Paul's living as a Gentile among Gentiles,
	plainly showed that, if he lived as a Jew among Jews, it was not that
	he thought it meritorious before God, but as a matter indifferent,
	wherein he might lawfully conform as a <i>Jew by birth</i> to those
	with whom he was, in order to put no needless stumbling-block to the
	Gospel in the way of his countrymen.

	the Jews' accusation against Stephen was not that he preached Christ
	crucified, but that "he spake blasphemous words against this

	have borne the former, if he had mixed with it justification in part
	by circumcision and the law, and if he had, through the medium of
	Christianity, brought converts to Judaism. But if justification in
	any degree depended on legal ordinances, Christ's crucifixion in that
	degree was unnecessary, and could profit nothing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:2">Galatians 5:2</span>;
