<p><b>12. they . . . which trouble
	you</b>—Translate, as the <i>Greek</i> is different from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "they who are <i>unsettling</i> you." 
	</p>
<p><b>were even cut off</b>—even
	as they desire your foreskin to be <i>cut off</i> and cast away by
	circumcision, so would that <i>they were even cut off</i> from your
	communion, being worthless as a castaway foreskin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:7">Galatians 1:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8">Galatians 1:8</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:8- :">Galatians 1:8- :</span>). The fathers, JEROME,
	AMBROSE, AUGUSTINE,
	and CHRYSOSTOM, explain
	it, "Would that they would even cut themselves off," that
	is, cut off not merely the foreskin, but the whole member: if
	<i>circumcision</i> be not enough for them, then let them have
	<i>excision</i> also; an outburst hardly suitable to the gravity of
	an apostle. But <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:9">Galatians 5:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:10">Galatians 5:10</span>
	plainly point to <i>excommunication</i> as the judgment threatened
	against the troublers: and danger of the bad "leaven"
	spreading, as the reason for it.</p>
