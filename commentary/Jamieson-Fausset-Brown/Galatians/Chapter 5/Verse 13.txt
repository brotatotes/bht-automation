<p><b>13.</b> The "ye" is
	emphatical, from its position in the <i>Greek,</i> "Ye

<p><b>unto liberty</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	expresses, "on a footing of liberty." The <i>state</i> or
	<i>condition</i> in which ye have been called to salvation, is one of
	liberty. Gospel liberty consists in three things, freedom from the
	Mosaic yoke, from sin, and from slavish fear.

	one another in love.</i> While free as to legalism, be <i>bound</i>
	by Love (the article in the <i>Greek</i> personifies love in the
	abstract) to serve one another (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:4- :">Judges 1:4- :</span>). Here he hints at their unloving strifes springing out of
