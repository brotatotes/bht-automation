14. all the law—Greek,
	"the whole law," namely, the Mosaic law. Love to God
	is presupposed as the root from which love to our neighbor
	springs; and it is in this tense the latter precept (so "word"
	means here) is said to be the fulfilling of "all the law"
	(Leviticus 19:18). Love is "the
	law of Christ" (Galatians 6:2;
	Matthew 7:12; Matthew 22:39;
	Matthew 22:40; Romans 13:9;
	Romans 13:10). 
	is fulfilled—Not as
	received text "is being fulfilled," but as the oldest
	manuscripts read, "has been fulfilled"; and so "receives
	its full perfection," as rudimentary teachings are fulfilled by
	the more perfect doctrine. The law only united Israelites together:
	the Gospel unites all men, and that in relation to God [GROTIUS].
