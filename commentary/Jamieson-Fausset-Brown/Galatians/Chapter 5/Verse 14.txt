<p><b>14. all the law</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the whole law," namely, the Mosaic law. <i>Love to God</i>
	is presupposed as the root from which <i>love to our neighbor</i>
	springs; and it is in this tense the latter <i>precept</i> (so "word"
	means here) is said to be the fulfilling of "<i>all</i> the law"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+19:18">Leviticus 19:18</span>). Love is "the
	law of Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:2">Galatians 6:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:12">Matthew 7:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:39">Matthew 22:39</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:40">Matthew 22:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:9">Romans 13:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+13:10">Romans 13:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>is fulfilled</b>—Not as
	received text "is being fulfilled," but as the oldest
	manuscripts read, "has been fulfilled"; and so "receives
	its full perfection," as rudimentary teachings are fulfilled by
	the more perfect doctrine. The law only united Israelites together:
	the Gospel unites all men, and that in relation to God [GROTIUS].</p>
