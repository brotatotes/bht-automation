<p><b>17. For</b>—the reason why walking
	by the Spirit will exclude fulfilling the lusts of the flesh, namely,
	their mutual contrariety.

	"lusteth," but "tendeth (or some such word is to be

<p><b>so that ye cannot do the
	things that ye would</b>—The Spirit strives against the flesh and
	its evil influence; the flesh against the Spirit and His good
	influence, <i>so that neither the one nor the other can be fully
	carried out into action.</i> "But" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) where "the Spirit" prevails, the issue of the
	struggle no longer continues doubtful (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) [BENGEL]. The
	<i>Greek</i> is, "that ye may not do the things that ye would."
	"The flesh and Spirit are contrary one to the other," <i>so
	that</i> you must distinguish what proceeds from the Spirit, and what
	from the flesh; and <i>you must not fulfil what you desire according
	to the carnal self,</i> but what the Spirit within you desires
	[NEANDER]. But the
	antithesis of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:18">Galatians 5:18</span> ("But,"
	c.), where the conflict is <i>decided,</i> shows, I think, that here
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span> contemplates the
	inability both for fully accomplishing the good we "would,"
	owing to the opposition of the <i>flesh,</i> and for doing the <i>evil</i>
	our flesh would desire, owing to the opposition of <i>the Spirit</i>
	in the awakened man (such as the Galatians are assumed to be), until
	we yield ourselves wholly by the Spirit to "walk by the Spirit"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:16">Galatians 5:16</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:18">Galatians 5:18</span>).</p>
