18. "If ye are led
	(give yourselves up to be led) by (Greek) the Spirit,
	ye are not under the law." For ye are not working the works of
	the flesh (Galatians 5:16; Galatians 5:19-21)
	which bring one "under the law" (Romans 8:2;
	Romans 8:14). The "Spirit makes
	free from the law of sin and death" (Romans 8:14- :). The law is made for a fleshly man, and for the works of
	the flesh (1 Timothy 1:9), "not
	for a righteous man" (Romans 6:14;
	Romans 6:15).
