<p><b>2. Behold</b>—that is, Mark what I
	say. 
	</p>
<p><b>I Paul</b>—Though you now
	think less of my authority, I nevertheless give my name and personal
	authority as enough by itself to refute all opposition of
	adversaries. 
	</p>
<p><b>if ye be circumcised</b>—not
	as ALFORD, "If you
	will <i>go on being</i> circumcised." Rather, "If ye suffer
	yourselves to be circumcised," namely, under the notion of its
	being necessary to <i>justification</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:4">Galatians 5:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:1">Acts 15:1</span>). Circumcision here is
	not regarded simply by itself (for, viewed as a mere <i>national</i>
	rite, it was practiced for conciliation's sake by Paul himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:1- :">Acts 15:1- :</span>), but as the symbol of <i>Judaism</i> and <i>legalism in
	general.</i> If this be necessary, then the Gospel of grace is at an
	end. If the latter be the way of justification, then Judaism is in no
	way so. 
	</p>
<p><b>Christ . . . profit . . .
	nothing</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:21">Galatians 2:21</span>). For
	righteousness of works and justification by faith cannot co-exist.
	"He who is circumcised [for justification] is so as fearing the
	law, and he who fears, disbelieves the power of grace, and he who
	disbelieves can profit nothing by that grace which he disbelieves
	[CHRYSOSTOM].</p>
