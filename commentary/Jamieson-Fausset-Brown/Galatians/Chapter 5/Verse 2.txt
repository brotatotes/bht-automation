2. Behold—that is, Mark what I
	say. 
	I Paul—Though you now
	think less of my authority, I nevertheless give my name and personal
	authority as enough by itself to refute all opposition of
	adversaries. 
	if ye be circumcised—not
	as ALFORD, "If you
	will go on being circumcised." Rather, "If ye suffer
	yourselves to be circumcised," namely, under the notion of its
	being necessary to justification (Galatians 5:4;
	Acts 15:1). Circumcision here is
	not regarded simply by itself (for, viewed as a mere national
	rite, it was practiced for conciliation's sake by Paul himself, Acts 15:1- :), but as the symbol of Judaism and legalism in
	general. If this be necessary, then the Gospel of grace is at an
	end. If the latter be the way of justification, then Judaism is in no
	way so. 
	Christ . . . profit . . .
	nothing— (Galatians 2:21). For
	righteousness of works and justification by faith cannot co-exist.
	"He who is circumcised [for justification] is so as fearing the
	law, and he who fears, disbelieves the power of grace, and he who
	disbelieves can profit nothing by that grace which he disbelieves
