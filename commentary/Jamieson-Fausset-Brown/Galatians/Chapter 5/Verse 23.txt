23. temperance—The Greek
	root implies self-restraint as to one's desires and lusts. 
	against such—not
	persons, but things, as in  :-. 
	no law—confirming  :-, "Not under the law" (1 Timothy 1:9;
	1 Timothy 1:10). The law itself
	commands love (Galatians 5:14); so far
	is it from being "against such."
