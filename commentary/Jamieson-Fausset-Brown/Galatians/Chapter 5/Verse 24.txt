<p><b>24.</b> The oldest manuscripts read,
	"They that are of Christ Jesus"; they that belong to Christ
	Jesus; being "led by (His) Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>have crucified the flesh</b>—They
	nailed it to the cross once for all when they became Christ's, on
	believing and being baptized (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:3">Romans 6:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>): they keep it <i>now</i>
	in a state of crucifixion (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6">Romans 6:6</span>):
	so that the Spirit can produce in them, comparatively uninterrupted
	by it, "the fruit of the Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6- :">Romans 6:6- :</span>). "Man, by faith, is dead to the former standing point
	of a sinful life, and rises to a new life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6- :">Romans 6:6- :</span>) of communion with Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6- :">Romans 6:6- :</span>). The act by which <i>they have crucified the flesh with its
	lust,</i> is already accomplished ideally in principle. But the
	practice, or outward conformation of the life, must harmonize with
	the tendency given to the inward life" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:6- :">Romans 6:6- :</span>) [NEANDER]. We
	are to be executioners, dealing cruelly with the body of sin, which
	has caused the acting of all cruelties on Christ's body.

<p><b>with the
	affections</b>—Translate, "with its passions." Thus they
	are dead to the law's condemning power, which is only for the
	fleshly, and their lusts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:23">Galatians 5:23</span>).</p>
