<p><b>25. in . . . in</b>â€”rather, as
	<i>Greek,</i> "If we live (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) BY the Spirit,
	let us also walk (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:16">Galatians 5:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16">Galatians 6:16</span>) BY
	the Spirit." Let our life in practice correspond to the ideal
	inner principle of our spiritual life, namely, our standing by faith
	as dead to, and severed from, sin, and the condemnation of the law.
	"Life by (or 'in') the Spirit" is not an occasional
	influence of the Spirit, but an abiding state, wherein we are
	continually alive, though sometimes sleeping and inactive.</p>
