<p><b>I testify . . . to every

<p><b>the whole law</b>—impossible
	for man to keep even in part, much less <i>wholly</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); yet none can be justified by the law, unless he keep it
	<i>wholly</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:10">Galatians 3:10</span>).</p>
