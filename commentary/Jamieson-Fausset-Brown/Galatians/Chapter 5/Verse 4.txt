<p><b>4.</b> Literally, "Ye have
	become void from Christ," that is, your connection with Christ
	has become void (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:2">Galatians 5:2</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:2- :">Galatians 5:2- :</span>, "<i>Loosed</i> from the law," where the same <i>Greek</i>
	occurs as here. 
	</p>
<p><b>whosoever of you are
	justified</b>—"are being justified," that is, are
	<i>endeavoring</i> to be justified. 
	</p>
<p><b>by the law</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"IN the law," as
	the element <i>in</i> which justification is to take place. 
	</p>
<p><b>fallen from grace</b>—Ye no
	longer "<i>stand</i>" in grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:2- :">Galatians 5:2- :</span>). Grace and legal righteousness cannot co-exist (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:4">Romans 4:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:6">Romans 11:6</span>).
	Christ, by circumcision (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:21">Luke 2:21</span>),
	undertook to obey all the law, and fulfil all righteousness for us:
	any, therefore, that now seeks to fulfil the law for himself in any
	degree for justifying righteousness, severs himself from the grace
	which flows from Christ's fulfilment of it, and becomes "a
	debtor to do the whole law" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:21- :">Luke 2:21- :</span>). The decree of the Jerusalem council had said nothing so
	strong as this; it had merely decided that Gentile Christians were
	not bound to legal observances. But the Galatians, while not
	pretending to be so <i>bound,</i> imagined there was an efficacy in
	them to merit a higher degree of <i>perfection</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:21- :">Luke 2:21- :</span>). This accounts for Paul not referring to the decree at all.
	He took much higher ground. See PALEY'S
	<i>Horæ Paulinæ</i>. The natural mind loves outward fetters, and is
	apt to forge them for itself, to stand in lieu of holiness of heart.</p>
