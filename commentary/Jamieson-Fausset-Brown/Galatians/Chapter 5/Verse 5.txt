<p><b>5. For</b>—proof of the assertion,
	"fallen from grace," by contrasting with the case of
	<i>legalists,</i> the "hope" of <i>Christians.</i>
</p>
<p><b>through the Spirit</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	rather, "by the Spirit": in opposition to <i>by the flesh</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:29">Galatians 4:29</span>), or fleshly ways of
	justification, as circumcision and legal ordinances. "We"
	is emphatical, and contrasted with "whosoever of you would be
	justified by the law" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:4">Galatians 5:4</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>the hope of righteousness</b>—"We
	wait for the (realization of the) hope (which is the fruit) of the
	righteousness (that is, justification which comes) by (literally,
	'<i>from—out of</i>') faith," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4">Romans 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:5">Romans 5:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:24">Romans 8:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:25">Romans 8:25</span>,
	"<i>Hope . . . we</i> with patience <i>wait for</i> it."
	This is a farther step than being "justified"; not only are
	we this, but "wait for the hope" which is connected with
	it, and is its full consummation. "Righteousness," in the
	sense of justification, is by the believer once for all already
	attained: but the consummation of it in future perfection above is
	the object of <i>hope</i> to be <i>waited for:</i> "the crown of
	righteousness laid up" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:25- :">Romans 8:25- :</span>): "the hope laid up for you in heaven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:5">Colossians 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:3">1 Peter 1:3</span>).</p>
