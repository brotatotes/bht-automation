<p><b>6. For</b>—confirming the truth
	that it is "by faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in Jesus Christ</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in Christ Jesus." In union with <i>Christ</i> (the
	ANOINTED Saviour), that
	is, <i>Jesus</i> of Nazareth. 
	</p>
<p><b>nor uncircumcision</b>—This
	is levelled against those who, being not legalists, or Judaizers,
	think themselves Christians on this ground alone. 
	</p>
<p><b>faith which worketh by
	love</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "working by love." This
	corresponds to "a new creature" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), as its definition. Thus in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:5">Galatians 5:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6">Galatians 5:6</span>, we have the three,
	"faith," "hope," and "love." The <i>Greek</i>
	expresses, "Which effectually worketh"; which exhibits its
	<i>energy</i> by love (so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6- :">Galatians 5:6- :</span>). <i>Love</i> is not joined with <i>faith</i> in justifying,
	but is the principle of the works which follow after justification by
	faith. Let not legalists, upholding circumcision, think that the
	essence of the law is set at naught by the doctrine of justification
	by faith only. Nay, "all the law is fulfilled in one word—love,"
	which is the principle on which "faith worketh" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6- :">Galatians 5:6- :</span>). Let them, therefore, seek this "faith," which
	will enable them truly to fulfil the law. Again, let not those who
	pride themselves on uncircumcision think that, because the law does
	not justify, they are free to walk after "the flesh" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:6- :">Galatians 5:6- :</span>). Let them, then, seek that "love" which is
	inseparable from true faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:8">James 2:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:12-22">James 2:12-22</span>). Love is
	utterly opposed to the enmities which prevailed among the Galatians
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:15">Galatians 5:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:20">Galatians 5:20</span>).
	The Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:5">Galatians 5:5</span>) is a Spirit
	of "faith" and "love" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:19">1 Corinthians 7:19</span>).</p>
