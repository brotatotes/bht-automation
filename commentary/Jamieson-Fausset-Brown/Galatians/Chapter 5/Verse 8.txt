<p><b>8. This persuasion</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>The</i> persuasion," namely, to which you are yielding.
	There is a play on words in the original, the <i>Greek</i> for
	<i>persuasion</i> being akin to "<i>obey</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). This persuasion which ye have <i>obeyed.</i>
</p>
<p><b>cometh not of</b>—that is
	"from." Does not emanate from Him, but from an enemy. 
	</p>
<p><b>that calleth you</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:13">Galatians 5:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6">Galatians 1:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:24">1 Thessalonians 5:24</span>).
	The calling is the rule of the whole race [BENGEL].</p>
