<p><b>9. A little leaven</b>â€”the <i>false
	teaching</i> of the Judaizers. A small portion of legalism, if it be
	mixed with the Gospel, corrupts its purity. To add legal ordinances
	and works in the least degree to justification by faith, is to
	undermine "the whole." So "leaven" is used of
	<i>false doctrine</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:12">Matthew 16:12</span>:
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:33">Matthew 13:33</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:33- :">Matthew 13:33- :</span> it means the corrupting influence of one bad <i>person;</i>
	so BENGEL understands it
	here to refer to the person (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:7">Galatians 5:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:8">Galatians 5:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:10">Galatians 5:10</span>)
	who misled them. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+9:18">Ecclesiastes 9:18</span>, "One
	sinner destroyeth much good" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+9:18- :">Ecclesiastes 9:18- :</span>). I prefer to refer it to false <i>doctrine,</i> answering
	to "persuasion" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:8">Galatians 5:8</span>).</p>
