9. A little leavenâ€”the false
	teaching of the Judaizers. A small portion of legalism, if it be
	mixed with the Gospel, corrupts its purity. To add legal ordinances
	and works in the least degree to justification by faith, is to
	undermine "the whole." So "leaven" is used of
	false doctrine (Matthew 16:12:
	compare Matthew 13:33). In Matthew 13:33- : it means the corrupting influence of one bad person;
	so BENGEL understands it
	here to refer to the person (Galatians 5:7;
	Galatians 5:8; Galatians 5:10)
	who misled them. Ecclesiastes 9:18, "One
	sinner destroyeth much good" (Ecclesiastes 9:18- :). I prefer to refer it to false doctrine, answering
	to "persuasion" (Galatians 5:8).
