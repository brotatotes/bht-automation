<p><b>1. Brethren</b>—An expression of
	kindness to conciliate attention. Translate as <i>Greek,</i> "If
	a man <i>even</i> be overtaken" (that is, caught in the very act
	[ALFORD and ELLICOTT]:
	BEFORE he expects:
	unexpectedly). BENGEL
	explains the "before" in the <i>Greek</i> compound verb,
	"If a man be overtaken in a fault <i>before ourselves</i>":
	If another has <i>really</i> been overtaken in a fault <i>the first;</i>
	for often he who is <i>first to find fault,</i> is the very one who
	has <i>first transgressed.</i>
</p>
<p><b>a fault</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"a transgression," "a fall"; such as a falling
	back into legal bondage. Here he gives monition to those who have not
	so fallen, "the spiritual," to be not "vainglorious"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:26">Galatians 5:26</span>), but forbearing to
	such (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:1">Romans 15:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>restore</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	is used of a dislocated limb, reduced to its place. Such is the
	tenderness with which we should treat a fallen member of the Church
	in restoring him to a better state. 
	</p>
<p><b>the spirit of meekness</b>—<i>the
	meekness</i> which is the gift <i>of the Holy Spirit</i> working in
	our spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:22">Galatians 5:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:25">Galatians 5:25</span>).
	"Meekness" is that temper of spirit towards God whereby we
	accept His dealings without disputing; then, towards men, whereby we
	endure meekly their provocations, and do not withdraw ourselves from
	the burdens which their sins impose upon us [TRENCH].
	</p>
<p><b>considering
	thyself</b>—Transition from the plural to the singular. When
	congregations are addressed collectively, each individual should take
	home the monition <i>to himself.</i>
</p>
<p><b>thou also be tempted</b>—as
	is likely to happen to those who reprove others without meekness
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:2-5">Matthew 7:2-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:13">James 2:13</span>).</p>
