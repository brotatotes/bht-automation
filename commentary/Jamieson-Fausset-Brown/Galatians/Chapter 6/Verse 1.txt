1. Brethren—An expression of
	kindness to conciliate attention. Translate as Greek, "If
	a man even be overtaken" (that is, caught in the very act
	[ALFORD and ELLICOTT]:
	BEFORE he expects:
	unexpectedly). BENGEL
	explains the "before" in the Greek compound verb,
	"If a man be overtaken in a fault before ourselves":
	If another has really been overtaken in a fault the first;
	for often he who is first to find fault, is the very one who
	has first transgressed.
a fault—Greek,
	"a transgression," "a fall"; such as a falling
	back into legal bondage. Here he gives monition to those who have not
	so fallen, "the spiritual," to be not "vainglorious"
	(Galatians 5:26), but forbearing to
	such (Romans 15:1). 
	restore—The Greek
	is used of a dislocated limb, reduced to its place. Such is the
	tenderness with which we should treat a fallen member of the Church
	in restoring him to a better state. 
	the spirit of meekness—the
	meekness which is the gift of the Holy Spirit working in
	our spirit (Galatians 5:22; Galatians 5:25).
	"Meekness" is that temper of spirit towards God whereby we
	accept His dealings without disputing; then, towards men, whereby we
	endure meekly their provocations, and do not withdraw ourselves from
	the burdens which their sins impose upon us [TRENCH].
	considering
	thyself—Transition from the plural to the singular. When
	congregations are addressed collectively, each individual should take
	home the monition to himself.
thou also be tempted—as
	is likely to happen to those who reprove others without meekness
	(compare Matthew 7:2-5; 2 Timothy 2:25;
	James 2:13).
