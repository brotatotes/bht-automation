<p><b>2.</b> If ye, legalists, must "bear
	burdens," then instead of legal burdens (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "bear one another's burdens," literally,
	"weights." Distinguished by BENGEL
	from "burden," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:4">Galatians 6:4</span>
	(a different <i>Greek</i> word, "load"): "weights"
	exceed the strength of those under them; "burden" is
	proportioned to the strength. 
	</p>
<p><b>so fulfil</b>—or as other
	old manuscripts read, "so ye will fulfil," <i>Greek,</i>
	"fill up," "thoroughly fulfil." 
	</p>
<p><b>the law of Christ</b>—namely,
	"love" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:14">Galatians 5:14</span>).
	Since ye desire "the law," then fulfil the law of Christ,
	which is not made up of various minute observances, but whose sole
	"burden" is "love" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:34">John 13:34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:12">John 15:12</span>); <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:12- :">John 15:12- :</span> gives Christ as the example in the particular duty here.</p>
