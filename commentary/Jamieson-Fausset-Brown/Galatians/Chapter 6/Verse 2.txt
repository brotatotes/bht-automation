2. If ye, legalists, must "bear
	burdens," then instead of legal burdens ( :-), "bear one another's burdens," literally,
	"weights." Distinguished by BENGEL
	from "burden," Galatians 6:4
	(a different Greek word, "load"): "weights"
	exceed the strength of those under them; "burden" is
	proportioned to the strength. 
	so fulfil—or as other
	old manuscripts read, "so ye will fulfil," Greek,
	"fill up," "thoroughly fulfil." 
	the law of Christ—namely,
	"love" (Galatians 5:14).
	Since ye desire "the law," then fulfil the law of Christ,
	which is not made up of various minute observances, but whose sole
	"burden" is "love" (John 13:34;
	John 15:12); John 15:12- : gives Christ as the example in the particular duty here.
