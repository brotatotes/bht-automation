<p><b>have rejoicing in himself

	regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another (namely, not in
	regard to his neighbor, by comparing himself with whom, he has
	fancied he has matter for boasting as that neighbor's superior)."
	Not that really a man by looking to "himself alone" is
	likely to find cause for glorying in himself. Nay, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, he speaks of a "burden" or <i>load,</i> not of
	matter for glorying, as what really belongs to each man. But he
	refers to <i>the idea those</i> whom he censures <i>had of
	themselves:</i> they <i>thought</i> they had cause for "glorying"
	in themselves, but it all arose from unjust self-conceited comparison
	of themselves with others, instead of looking at home. The only true
	glorying, if glorying it is to be called, is in the testimony of a
	good conscience, glorying in the cross of Christ.</p>
