<p><b>5.</b> For (by this way, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, of proving himself, not depreciating his neighbor by
	comparison) each man shall bear his own "burden," or
	rather, "<i>load</i>" (namely, of sin and infirmity), the
	<i>Greek</i> being different from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. This verse does not contradict <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. There he tells them to bear with others' "burdens"
	of infirmity in sympathy; here, that self-examination will make a man
	to feel he has enough to do with "his own load" of sin,
	without comparing himself boastfully with his neighbor. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Instead of "thinking himself to be something," he
	shall feel the "load" of his own sin: and this will lead
	him to bear sympathetically with his neighbor's burden of infirmity.
	Ã†SOP says a man carries
	two bags over his shoulder, the one with his own sins hanging behind,
	that with his neighbor's sins in front.</p>
