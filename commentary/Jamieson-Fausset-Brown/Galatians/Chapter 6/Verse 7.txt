<p><b>7. God is not mocked</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	verb is, literally, to sneer with the nostrils drawn up in contempt.
	God does not suffer Himself to be imposed on by empty words: He will
	judge according to works, which are seeds sown for eternity of either
	joy or woe. Excuses for illiberality in God's cause (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) seem valid before men, but are not so before God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>soweth</b>—especially of
	his resources (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:6">2 Corinthians 9:6</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"this"; this and nothing else. 
	</p>
<p><b>reap</b>—at the harvest,
	the end of the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:39">Matthew 13:39</span>).</p>
