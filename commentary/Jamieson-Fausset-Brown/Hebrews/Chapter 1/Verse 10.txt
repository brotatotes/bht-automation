<p><b>10. And</b>—In another passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) He says.

<p><b>in the beginning</b>—<i>English
	Version,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+102:25">Psalms 102:25</span>, "of

	The <i>Septuagint,</i> "in the beginning" (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+102:25- :">Psalms 102:25- :</span>) answers by contrast to <i>the end</i> implied in "They
	shall perish," &amp;c. The <i>Greek</i> order here (not in the
	<i>Septuagint</i>) is, "Thou in the beginning, O Lord,"
	which throws the "Lord" into emphasis. "Christ is
	preached even in passages where many might contend that the Father
	was principally intended" [BENGEL].
