	does not mean <i>annihilation;</i> just as it did not mean so in the
	case of "the world that being overflowed with water, <i>perished</i>"
	under Noah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:6">2 Peter 3:6</span>). The
	covenant of the possession of the earth was renewed with Noah and his
	seed on the renovated earth. So it shall be after the perishing by
	fire (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:12">2 Peter 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:13">2 Peter 3:13</span>).
