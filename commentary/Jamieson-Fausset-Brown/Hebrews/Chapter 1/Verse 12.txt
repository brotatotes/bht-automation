12. vesture—Greek, "an
	enwrapping cloak." 
	fold them up—So the
	Septuagint, Psalms 102:26;
	but the Hebrew, "change them." The Spirit, by
	Paul, treats the Hebrew of the Old Testament, with
	independence of handling, presenting the divine truth in various
	aspects; sometimes as here sanctioning the Septuagint (compare
	Isaiah 34:4; Revelation 6:14);
	sometimes the Hebrew; sometimes varying from both. 
	changed—as one lays
	aside a garment to put on another. 
	thou art the same—
	(Isaiah 46:4; Malachi 3:6).
	The same in nature, therefore in covenant faithfulness to Thy people.
	shall not fail—Hebrew,
	"shall not end." Israel, in the Babylonian captivity, in
	the hundred second Psalm, casts her hopes of deliverance on Messiah,
	the unchanging covenant God of Israel.
