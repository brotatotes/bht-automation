<p><b>14. ministering spirits</b>—referring
	to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:7">Hebrews 1:7</span>, "spirits . . .
	ministers." They are incorporeal <i>spirits,</i> as God is, but
	<i>ministering</i> to Him as inferiors.

<p><b>sent forth</b>—present
	participle: "being sent forth" <i>continually,</i> as their
	regular service in all ages.

<p><b>to minister</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"unto (that is, 'for') ministry." 
	</p>
<p><b>for them</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>on account of</i> the." Angels are sent forth on
	<i>ministrations to God and Christ,</i> not primarily to men, though
	<i>for the good</i> of "those who are about to inherit
	salvation" (so the <i>Greek</i>): the elect, who believe, or
	shall believe, for whom all things, angels included, work together
	for good (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:28">Romans 8:28</span>). Angels'
	ministrations are not properly rendered to men, since the latter have
	no power of commanding them, though their ministrations to God are
	often directed to the good of men. So the superiority of the Son of
	God to angels is shown. They "all," how ever various their
	ranks, "minister"; He is ministered to. They "<i>stand</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:19">Luke 1:19</span>) before God, or are
	"<i>sent</i> forth" to execute the divine commands on
	behalf of them whom He pleases to save; He "<i>sits</i> on the
	right hand of the Majesty on high" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span>). He rules; they serve.</p>
