<p><b>2. in these last days</b>—In the
	oldest manuscripts the <i>Greek</i> is. "At the last part of
	these days." The Rabbins divided the whole of time into "this
	age," or "world," and "the age to come"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:5">Hebrews 2:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:5">Hebrews 6:5</span>).
	The days of Messiah were the transition period or "last part of
	these days" (in contrast to "in times past"), the
	close of the existing dispensation, and beginning of the final
	dispensation of which Christ's second coming shall be the crowning
	consummation.

	Son</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "IN
	(His) Son" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:10">John 14:10</span>).
	The true "Prophet" of God. "His majesty is set forth:
	(1) <i>Absolutely</i> by the very name "Son," and by three
	glorious predicates, "whom He hath appointed," "by
	whom He made the worlds," "who sat down on the right hand
	of the Majesty on high;" thus His course is described from the
	beginning of all things till he reached the goal (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>). (2) <i>Relatively,</i>
	in comparison with the angels, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3- :">Hebrews 1:3- :</span>; the <i>confirmation</i> of this follows, and the very name
	"Son" is proved at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3- :">Hebrews 1:3- :</span>; the "heirship," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3- :">Hebrews 1:3- :</span>; the "making the worlds," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3- :">Hebrews 1:3- :</span>; the "sitting at the right hand" of God,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:14">Hebrews 1:14</span>."
	His being made <i>heir</i> follows His <i>sonship,</i> and preceded
	His <i>making the worlds</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:22">Proverbs 8:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+8:23">Proverbs 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11">Ephesians 3:11</span>).
	As <i>the first begotten,</i> He is heir of the universe (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11- :">Ephesians 3:11- :</span>), which He made instrumentally, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11- :">Ephesians 3:11- :</span>, where "by the Word of God" answers to "by
	whom"' (the Son of God) here (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:11- :">Ephesians 3:11- :</span>). Christ was "appointed" (in God's eternal counsel)
	to creation as an office; and the universe so created was assigned to
	Him as a kingdom. He is "heir of all things" by right of
	creation, and especially by right of redemption. The promise to
	Abraham that he should be heir of the world had its fulfilment, and
	will have it still more fully, in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:13">Romans 4:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:16">Galatians 3:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:7">Galatians 4:7</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>worlds</b>—the inferior and
	the superior worlds (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>).
	Literally, "ages" with all things and persons belonging to
	them; the universe, including all space and ages of time, and all
	material and spiritual existences. The <i>Greek</i> implies, He not
	only appointed His Son heir of all things before creation, but <i>He
	also</i> (better than "also He") made by Him the worlds.</p>
