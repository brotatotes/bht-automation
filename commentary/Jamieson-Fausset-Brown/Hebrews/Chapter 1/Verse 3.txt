<p><b>brightness of his
	glory</b>—<i>Greek,</i> the <i>effulgence</i> of His glory. "Light
	of (from) light" [<i>Nicene Creed</i>]. "Who is so
	senseless as to doubt concerning the eternal being of the Son? For
	when has one seen light without effulgence?" [ATHANASIUS,
	<i>Against Arius, Orations,</i> 2]. "The sun is never seen
	without effulgence, nor the Father without the Son"
	[THEOPHYLACT]. It is
	<i>because</i> He is the brightness, c., and <i>because</i> He
	upholds, &amp;c., that He <i>sat down on the right hand,</i> &amp;c.
	It was a return to His divine glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:62">John 6:62</span>

<p><b>by the word</b>—Therefore
	the Son of God is a Person; for He has the word [BENGEL].
	<i>His</i> word is <i>God's</i> word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20- :">Colossians 1:20- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of his power</b>—"The

	and gives expression to it. 
	</p>
<p><b>by himself</b>—omitted in
	the oldest manuscripts. 
	</p>
<p><b>purged</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>made purification of</i> . . . sins," namely, in His
	atonement, which graciously covers the guilt of sin. "Our"
	is omitted in the oldest manuscripts. Sin was the great <i>uncleanness</i>
	in God's sight, of which He has effected the purgation by His
	sacrifice [ALFORD]. Our
	nature, as guilt-laden, could not, without our great High Priest's
	blood of atonement sprinkling the heavenly mercy seat, come into
	immediate contact with God. EBRARD
	says, "The mediation between man and God, who was present in the
	Most Holy Place, was revealed in three forms: (1) In sacrifices
	(typical propitiations for guilt); (2) In the priesthood (the agents
	of those sacrifices); (3) In the Levitical laws of purity (Levitical
	purity being attained by sacrifice positively, by avoidance of
	Levitical pollution negatively, the people being thus enabled to come
	into the presence of God without dying, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20- :">Colossians 1:20- :</span>)" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:20- :">Colossians 1:20- :</span>).

	of the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>);
	it is never used of His pre-existing state co-equal with the Father,
	but always of His exalted state as Son of man after His sufferings,
	and as Mediator for man in the presence of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20- :">Ephesians 1:20- :</span>): a relation towards God and us about to come to an end when
	its object has been accomplished (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20- :">Ephesians 1:20- :</span>).</p>
