4. Being made . . . better—by
	His exaltation by the Father (Hebrews 1:3;
	Hebrews 1:13): in contrast to His
	being "made lower than the angels" (Hebrews 1:13- :). "Better," that is, superior to. As "being"
	(Hebrews 1:3) expresses His
	essential being so "being made" (Hebrews 1:3- :) marks what He became in His assumed manhood (Hebrews 1:3- :). Paul shows that His humbled form (at which the Jews might
	stumble) is no objection to His divine Messiahship. As the law was
	given by the ministration of angels and Moses, it was inferior to the
	Gospel given by the divine Son, who both is (Hebrews 1:3- :) as God, and has been made, as the exalted Son of man (Hebrews 1:3- :), much better than the angels. The manifestations of God
	by angels (and even by the angel of the covenant) at different times
	in the Old Testament, did not bring man and God into personal union,
	as the manifestation of God in human flesh does. 
	by inheritance obtained—He
	always had the thing itself, namely, Sonship; but He
	"obtained by inheritance," according to the promise of the
	Father, the name "Son," whereby He is made known to
	men and angels. He is "the Son of God" is a sense far
	exalted above that in which angels are called "sons of God"
	(Job 1:6; Job 38:7).
	"The fulness of the glory of the peculiar name "the Son of
	God," is unattainable by human speech or thought. All
	appellations are but fragments of its glory beams united in it as in
	a central sun, Revelation 19:12. A
	name that no than knew but He Himself."
