<p><b>4. Being made . . . better</b>—by
	His exaltation by the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span>): in contrast to His
	being "made lower than the angels" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13- :">Hebrews 1:13- :</span>). "Better," that is, <i>superior</i> to. As "being"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>) expresses His
	essential being so "being made" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3- :">Hebrews 1:3- :</span>) marks what He became in His assumed manhood (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3- :">Hebrews 1:3- :</span>). Paul shows that His humbled form (at which the Jews might
	stumble) is no objection to His divine Messiahship. As the law was
	given by the ministration of angels and Moses, it was inferior to the
	Gospel given by the divine Son, who both is (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3- :">Hebrews 1:3- :</span>) as God, and has been made, as the exalted Son of man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3- :">Hebrews 1:3- :</span>), much better than the angels. The manifestations of God
	by angels (and even by the angel of the covenant) at different times
	in the Old Testament, did not bring man and God into personal union,
	as the manifestation of God in human flesh does.

<p><b>by inheritance obtained</b>—He
	always had the <i>thing</i> itself, namely, <i>Sonship;</i> but <i>He</i>
	"obtained by inheritance," according to the promise of the
	Father, <i>the name</i> "Son," whereby He is made known to
	men and angels. He is "the Son of God" is a sense far
	exalted above that in which angels are called "sons of God"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:6">Job 1:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+38:7">Job 38:7</span>).
	"The fulness of the glory of the peculiar name "the Son of
	God," is unattainable by human speech or thought. All
	appellations are but fragments of its glory beams united in it as in
	a central sun, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:12">Revelation 19:12</span>. <i>A
	name that no than knew but He Himself.</i>"</p>
