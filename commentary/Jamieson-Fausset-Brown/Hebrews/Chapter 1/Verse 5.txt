5. For—substantiating His
	having "obtained a more excellent name than the angels." 
	unto which—A frequent
	argument in this Epistle is derived from the silence of Scripture
	(Hebrews 1:13; Hebrews 2:16;
	Hebrews 7:3; Hebrews 7:14)
	[BENGEL]. 
	this day have I begotten
	thee— (Psalms 2:7). Fulfilled
	at the resurrection of Jesus, whereby the Father "declared,"
	that is, made manifest His divine Sonship, heretofore veiled by His
	humiliation (Acts 13:33; Romans 1:4).
	Christ has a fourfold right to the title "Son of God"; (1)
	By generation, as begotten of God; (2) By commission,
	as sent by God; (3) By resurrection, as "the
	first-begotten of the dead" (compare Luke 20:36;
	Romans 1:4; Revelation 1:5);
	(4) By actual possession, as heir of all [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. The Psalm here
	quoted applied primarily in a less full sense to Solomon, of whom God
	promised by Nathan to David. "I will be his father and he shall
	be my son." But as the whole theocracy was of Messianic import,
	the triumph of David over Hadadezer and neighboring kings (2 Samuel 8:1-18;
	Psalms 2:2; Psalms 2:3;
	Psalms 2:9-12) is a type of
	God's ultimately subduing all enemies under His Son, whom He sets
	(Hebrew, "anointed," Psalms 2:9-19.2.12- :) on His "holy hill of Zion," as King of the Jews
	and of the whole earth. the antitype to Solomon, son of David. The
	"I" in Greek is emphatic; I the Everlasting
	Father have begotten Thee this day, that is, on this day, the day of
	Thy being manifested as My Son, "the first-begotten of
	the dead" (Colossians 1:18;
	Revelation 1:5). when Thou hast ransomed
	and opened heaven to Thy people. He had been always Son, but now
	first was manifested as such in His once humbled, now exalted manhood
	united to His Godhead. ALFORD
	refers "this day" to the eternal generation of the
	Son: the day in which the Son was begotten by the Father is an
	everlasting to-day: there never was a yesterday or past time
	to Him, nor a to-morrow or future time: "Nothing there is to
	come, and nothing past, but an eternal NOW doth ever last"
	(Proverbs 30:4; John 10:30;
	John 10:38; John 16:28;
	John 17:8). The communication of
	the divine essence in its fulness, involves eternal generation; for
	the divine essence has no beginning. But the context refers to a
	definite point of time, namely, that of His having entered on the
	inheritance (Hebrews 1:4).
	The "bringing the first-begotten into the world" (Hebrews 1:4- :), is not subsequent, as ALFORD
	thinks, to Hebrews 1:5, but anterior
	to it (compare Acts 2:30-35).
