<p><b>unto which</b>—A frequent

<p><b>this day have I begotten
	thee</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>). Fulfilled
	at the resurrection of Jesus, whereby the Father "declared,"
	that is, made manifest His divine Sonship, heretofore veiled by His
	humiliation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:33">Acts 13:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>).
	Christ has a fourfold right to the title "Son of God"; (1)
	By <i>generation,</i> as begotten of God; (2) By <i>commission,</i>
	as sent by God; (3) By <i>resurrection,</i> as "the
	first-begotten of the dead" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:36">Luke 20:36</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:4">Romans 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>);
	(4) By <i>actual possession,</i> as heir of all [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. The Psalm here
	quoted applied primarily in a less full sense to Solomon, of whom God
	promised by Nathan to David. "I will be his father and he shall
	be my son." But as the whole theocracy was of Messianic import,
	the triumph of David over Hadadezer and neighboring kings (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+8:1-18">2 Samuel 8:1-18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:2">Psalms 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:3">Psalms 2:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:9-12">Psalms 2:9-12</span>) is a type of
	God's ultimately subduing all enemies under His Son, whom He sets
	(<i>Hebrew,</i> "anointed," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:9-19.2.12- :">Psalms 2:9-19.2.12- :</span>) on His "holy hill of Zion," as King of the Jews
	and of the whole earth. the antitype to Solomon, son of David. The
	"I" in <i>Greek</i> is emphatic; <i>I</i> the Everlasting
	Father have begotten Thee this day, that is, on this day, the day of
	Thy being manifested as My Son, "the first-<i>begotten</i> of
	the dead" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>). when Thou hast ransomed
	and opened heaven to Thy people. He had been always Son, but now
	first was manifested as such in His once humbled, now exalted manhood
	united to His Godhead. ALFORD
	refers "this day" to the <i>eternal</i> generation of the
	Son: the day in which the Son was begotten by the Father is an
	everlasting <i>to-day:</i> there never was a yesterday or past time
	to Him, nor a to-morrow or future time: "Nothing there is to
	come, and nothing past, but an eternal NOW doth ever last"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:4">Proverbs 30:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:30">John 10:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:38">John 10:38</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:8">John 17:8</span>). The communication of
	the divine essence in its fulness, involves eternal generation; for
	the divine essence has no beginning. But the context refers to a
	definite point of time, namely, that of His having entered on the
	<i>inheritance</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>).
	The "bringing the first-begotten into the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4- :">Hebrews 1:4- :</span>), is not subsequent, as ALFORD
	thinks, to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span>, but anterior
	to it (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:30-35">Acts 2:30-35</span>).</p>
