<p><b>6. And</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "But."
	Not only this proves His superiority, BUT
	a more decisive proof is <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:7">Psalms 97:7</span>,
	which shows that not only at His resurrection, but also in prospect
	of His being <i>brought into the world</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>) as man, in His
	incarnation, nativity (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5- :">Hebrews 10:5- :</span>), temptation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:10">Matthew 4:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:11">Matthew 4:11</span>), resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:11- :">Matthew 4:11- :</span>), and future second advent in glory, angels were designed by
	God to be subject to Him. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:11- :">Matthew 4:11- :</span>, "seen of angels"; God manifesting Messiah as one
	to be gazed at with adoring love by heavenly intelligences (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:9">2 Thessalonians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:10">2 Thessalonians 1:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>). The fullest
	realization of His Lordship shall be at His second coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+97:7">Psalms 97:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:24">1 Corinthians 15:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:25">1 Corinthians 15:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:9">Philippians 2:9</span>). "Worship Him all
	ye gods" ("gods," that is, <i>exalted beings,</i> as
	<i>angels</i>), refers to <i>God;</i> but it was universally admitted
	among the Hebrews that God would dwell, in a peculiar sense, in
	Messiah (so as to be in the Talmud phrase, "capable of being
	pointed to with the finger"); and so what was said of God was
	true of, and to be fulfilled in, Messiah. KIMCHI
	says that the ninety-third through the hundred first Psalms contain
	in them the mystery of Messiah. God ruled the theocracy in and
	through Him.

<p><b>the world</b>—subject to
	Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:5">Hebrews 2:5</span>). As "the
	first-begotten" He has the rights of <i>primogeniture</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:5- :">Hebrews 2:5- :</span>); <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:15">Colossians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18">Colossians 1:18</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18- :">Colossians 1:18- :</span>, the <i>Septuagint</i> has, "Let all the angels of God
	worship Him," words not now found in the <i>Hebrew.</i> This
	passage of the <i>Septuagint</i> may have been in Paul's mind as to
	the <i>form,</i> but the <i>substance</i> is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18- :">Colossians 1:18- :</span>. The type David, in the <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:18- :">Colossians 1:18- :</span> (quoted in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5">Hebrews 1:5</span>),
	is called "God's <i>first-born,</i> higher than the <i>kings</i>
	of the earth"; so the antitypical first-begotten, the son of
	David, is to be worshipped by all inferior <i>lords,</i> such as
	<i>angels</i> ("gods," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5- :">Hebrews 1:5- :</span>); for He is "King of kings and Lord of lords" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5- :">Hebrews 1:5- :</span>). In the <i>Greek,</i> "again" is transposed; but
	this does not oblige us, as ALFORD
	thinks, to translate, "when He <i>again shall have introduced,</i>"
	c., namely, at Christ's second coming for there is no previous
	mention of a <i>first</i> bringing in; and "again" is often
	used in quotations, not to be joined with the verb, but
	parenthetically ("that I may again quote Scripture").
	<i>English Version</i> is correct (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5- :">Hebrews 1:5- :</span>; <i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:5- :">Hebrews 1:5- :</span>).</p>
