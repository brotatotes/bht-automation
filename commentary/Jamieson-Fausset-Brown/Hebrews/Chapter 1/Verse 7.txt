<p><b>7. of</b>—The <i>Greek</i> is
	rather, "In reference TO the angels." 
	</p>
<p><b>spirits</b>—or "winds":
	Who employeth His angels as the winds, His ministers as the
	lightnings; or, He maketh His angelic ministers the directing powers
	of winds and flames, when these latter are required to perform His
	will. "Commissions them to assume the agency or form of flames
	for His purposes" [ALFORD].
	<i>English Version,</i> "maketh His angels <i>spirits,</i>"
	means, He maketh them of a subtle, incorporeal nature, swift as the
	wind. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:10">Psalms 18:10</span>, "a
	<i>cherub</i> . . . the wings of the <i>wind.</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:10- :">Psalms 18:10- :</span>, "ministering <i>spirits,</i>" favors <i>English
	Version</i> here. As "spirits" implies the wind-like
	velocity and subtle nature of the <i>cherubim,</i> so "flame of
	fire" expresses the burning devotion and intense all-consuming
	zeal of the adoring <i>seraphim</i> (meaning "burning), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:10- :">Psalms 18:10- :</span>. The translation, "maketh winds His messengers, and a
	flame of fire His <i>ministers</i> (!)," is plainly wrong. In
	the <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:3">Psalms 104:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+104:4">Psalms 104:4</span>,
	the subject in each clause comes first, and the attribute predicated
	of it second; so the <i>Greek</i> article here marks "angels"
	and "ministers" as the <i>subjects,</i> and "winds"
	and "flame of fire," <i>predicates, Schemoth Rabba</i>
	says, "God is called God of Zebaoth (the heavenly hosts),
	because He does what He pleases with His angels. When He pleases, He
	makes them to sit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+6:11">Judges 6:11</span>); at
	other times to stand (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:2">Isaiah 6:2</span>);
	at times to resemble women (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:2- :">Isaiah 6:2- :</span>); at other times to resemble men (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:2- :">Isaiah 6:2- :</span>); at times He makes them 'spirits'; at times, fire."
	"Maketh" implies that, however exalted, they are but
	creatures, whereas the Son is the Creator (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:2- :">Isaiah 6:2- :</span>): not <i>begotten from everlasting,</i> nor to be
	<i>worshipped,</i> as the Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:7">Revelation 14:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:8">Revelation 22:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:9">Revelation 22:9</span>).</p>
