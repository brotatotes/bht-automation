<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. CONCLUSION OF THE
	FOREGOING ARGUMENT.
	THE YEARLY
	RECURRING LAW
	SACRIFICES CANNOT
	PERFECT THE WORSHIPPER,
	BUT CHRIST'S
	ONCE-FOR-ALL OFFERING
	CAN. 
	</p>
<p>Instead of the daily ministry of
	the Levitical priests, Christ's service is perfected by the one
	sacrifice, whence He now sits on the right hand of God as a
	Priest-King, until all His foes shall be subdued unto Him. Thus the
	new covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:8-12">Hebrews 8:8-12</span>)
	is inaugurated, whereby the law is written on the heart, so that an
	offering for sin is needed no more. Wherefore we ought to draw near
	the Holiest in firm faith and love; fearful of the awful results of
	apostasy; looking for the recompense to be given at Christ's coming.</p>
