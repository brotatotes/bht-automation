10. By—Greek, "In."
	So "in," and "through," occur in the same
	sentence, 1 Peter 1:22, "Ye
	have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
	the Spirit." Also, 1 Peter 1:5,
	in the Greek. The "in (fulfilment of) which will"
	(compare the use of in, 1 Peter 1:5- :, "wherein [in which grace] He hath made us accepted, in
	the Beloved"), expresses the originating cause; "THROUGH
	the offering . . . of Christ," the instrumental or
	mediatory cause. The whole work of redemption flows from "the
	will" of God the Father, as the First Cause, who decreed
	redemption from before the foundation of the world. The "will"

	all, and as our permanent state (so the Greek). It is
	the finished work of Christ in having sanctified us (that is, having
	translated us from a state of unholy alienation into a state of
	consecration to God, having "no more conscience of sin,"
	Hebrews 10:2) once for all and
	permanently, not the process of gradual sanctification, which is here
	referred to. 
	the body—"prepared"
	for Him by the Father (Hebrews 10:5).
	As the atonement, or reconciliation, is by the blood of Christ (Hebrews 10:5- :), so our sanctification (consecration to God,
	holiness and eternal bliss) is by the body of Christ (Hebrews 10:5- :). ALFORD quotes
	the Book of Common Prayer Communion Service, "that our
	sinful bodies may be made clean by His body, and our souls
	washed through His most precious blood." 
	once for all— (Hebrews 7:27;
	Hebrews 9:12; Hebrews 9:26;
	Hebrews 9:28; Hebrews 10:12;
	Hebrews 10:14).
