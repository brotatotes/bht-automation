<p><b>10. By</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "In."
	So "in," and "through," occur in the same
	sentence, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22">1 Peter 1:22</span>, "Ye
	have purified your souls <i>in</i> obeying the truth <i>through</i>
	the Spirit." Also, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:5">1 Peter 1:5</span>,
	in the <i>Greek.</i> The "<i>in</i> (fulfilment of) which will"
	(compare the use of <i>in,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:5- :">1 Peter 1:5- :</span>, "wherein [in which grace] He hath made us accepted, in
	the Beloved"), expresses the <i>originating</i> cause; "THROUGH
	the offering . . . of Christ," the <i>instrumental</i> or
	<i>mediatory</i> cause. The whole work of redemption flows from "the
	will" of God the Father, as the First Cause, who decreed
	redemption from before the foundation of the world. The "will"
	here (<i>boulema</i>) is His <i>absolute sovereign will.</i> His
	"good will" (<i>eudokia</i>) is a particular aspect of it.

<p><b>are sanctified</b>—once for
	all, and as our <i>permanent state</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>). It is
	the finished work of Christ in having sanctified us (that is, having
	translated us from a state of unholy alienation into a state of
	<i>consecration</i> to God, having "no more conscience of sin,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:2">Hebrews 10:2</span>) once for all and
	permanently, not the process of gradual sanctification, which is here
	referred to. 
	</p>
<p><b>the body</b>—"prepared"
	for Him by the Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>).
	As the atonement, or reconciliation, is by the blood of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5- :">Hebrews 10:5- :</span>), so our <i>sanctification</i> (consecration to God,
	holiness and eternal bliss) is by the <i>body</i> of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5- :">Hebrews 10:5- :</span>). ALFORD quotes
	the <i>Book of Common Prayer Communion Service,</i> "that our
	sinful bodies may be <i>made clean by His body,</i> and our souls
	washed through His most precious blood."

<p><b>once for all</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:27">Hebrews 7:27</span>;
