<p><b>11. And</b>—a new point of

<p><b>priest</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "high priest." Though he did not in
	person stand "daily" offering sacrifices, he did so by the
	subordinate priests of whom, as well as of all Israel, he was the
	representative head. So "daily" is applied to the high
	priests (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:27">Hebrews 7:27</span>).

<p><b>standeth</b>—the attitude
	of one ministering; in contrast to "<i>sat down</i> on the right
	hand of God," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:12">Hebrews 10:12</span>,
	said of Christ; the posture of one being ministered to as a king.

<p><b>which</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the which," that is, of such a kind as. 
	</p>
<p><b>take away</b>—utterly;
	literally, "strip off all round." Legal sacrifices might,
	<i>in part,</i> produce the sense of forgiveness, yet scarcely even
	that (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>); but
	<i>entirely</i> to strip off one's guilt they never could.</p>
