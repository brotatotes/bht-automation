<p><b>12. this man</b>—emphatic (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>for ever</b>—joined in
	<i>English Version</i> with "offered one sacrifice";
	offered one sacrifice, the efficacy of which endures for ever;
	literally. "continuously," (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "The offering of Christ, once for all made, will
	continue the one and only oblation for ever; no other will supersede
	it" [BENGEL]. The
	mass, which professes to be the frequent repetition of one and the
	same sacrifice of Christ's body, is hence disproved. For not only is
	Christ's body one, but also <i>His offering is one,</i> and that
	inseparable from His suffering (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The mass would be much the same as the Jewish sacrifices
	which Paul sets aside as abrogated, for they were anticipations of
	the one sacrifice, just as Rome makes masses continuations of it, in
	opposition to Paul's argument. A repetition would imply that the
	former once-for-all offering of the one sacrifice was imperfect, and
	so would be dishonoring to it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:2">Hebrews 10:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:18">Hebrews 10:18</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:18- :">Hebrews 10:18- :</span>, on the contrary, says, "He hath PERFECTED
	FOR EVER them that are sanctified." If Christ offered
	Himself at the last supper, then He offered Himself again on the
	cross, and there would be <i>two</i> offerings; but Paul says there
	was only <i>one, once for all.</i> Compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:18- :">Hebrews 10:18- :</span>. <i>English Version</i> is favored by the usage in this
	Epistle, of putting the <i>Greek</i> "for ever" after that
	which it qualifies. Also, "one sacrifice for ever," stands
	in contrast to "the same sacrifices oftentimes" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:18- :">Hebrews 10:18- :</span>). Also, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:25">1 Corinthians 15:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:28">1 Corinthians 15:28</span>, agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:12">Hebrews 10:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:13">Hebrews 10:13</span>, taken as <i>English
	Version,</i> not joining, as ALFORD
	does, "for ever" with "sat down," for Jesus is to
	<i>give up</i> the mediatorial throne "when all things shall be
	subdued unto Him," and not to sit on it <i>for ever.</i></p>
