12. this man—emphatic ( :-). 
	for ever—joined in
	English Version with "offered one sacrifice";
	offered one sacrifice, the efficacy of which endures for ever;
	literally. "continuously," (compare  :-). "The offering of Christ, once for all made, will
	continue the one and only oblation for ever; no other will supersede
	it" [BENGEL]. The
	mass, which professes to be the frequent repetition of one and the
	same sacrifice of Christ's body, is hence disproved. For not only is
	Christ's body one, but also His offering is one, and that
	inseparable from His suffering ( :-). The mass would be much the same as the Jewish sacrifices
	which Paul sets aside as abrogated, for they were anticipations of
	the one sacrifice, just as Rome makes masses continuations of it, in
	opposition to Paul's argument. A repetition would imply that the
	former once-for-all offering of the one sacrifice was imperfect, and
	so would be dishonoring to it (Hebrews 10:2;
	Hebrews 10:18). Hebrews 10:18- :, on the contrary, says, "He hath PERFECTED
	FOR EVER them that are sanctified." If Christ offered
	Himself at the last supper, then He offered Himself again on the
	cross, and there would be two offerings; but Paul says there
	was only one, once for all. Compare Note, see on Hebrews 10:18- :. English Version is favored by the usage in this
	Epistle, of putting the Greek "for ever" after that
	which it qualifies. Also, "one sacrifice for ever," stands
	in contrast to "the same sacrifices oftentimes" (Hebrews 10:18- :). Also, 1 Corinthians 15:25;
	1 Corinthians 15:28, agrees with Hebrews 10:12;
	Hebrews 10:13, taken as English
	Version, not joining, as ALFORD
	does, "for ever" with "sat down," for Jesus is to
	give up the mediatorial throne "when all things shall be
	subdued unto Him," and not to sit on it for ever.
