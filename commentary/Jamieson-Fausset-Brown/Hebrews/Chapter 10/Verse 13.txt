<p><b>13. expecting</b>—"waiting."
	<i>Awaiting</i> the execution of His Father's will, that all His foes
	should be subjected to Him. The Son <i>waits</i> till the Father
	shall "send Him forth to triumph over all His foes." He is
	now <i>sitting</i> at rest (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), invisibly reigning, and having His foes virtually, by
	right of His death, subject to Him. His present <i>sitting</i> on the
	unseen throne is a necessary preliminary to His coming forth to
	subject His foes openly. He shall then come forth to a visibly
	manifested kingdom and conquest over His foes. Thus He fulfils <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. This agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. He is, by His Spirit and His providence, now subjecting
	His foes to Him in part (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The subjection of His foes <i>fully</i> shall be at His
	second advent, and from that time to the general judgment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); then comes the subjection of Himself as Head of the
	Church to the Father (the mediatorial economy ceasing when its end
	shall have been accomplished), that God may be all in all. Eastern
	conquerors used to tread on the necks of the vanquished, as Joshua
	did to the five kings. So Christ's total and absolute conquest at His
	coming is symbolized.
