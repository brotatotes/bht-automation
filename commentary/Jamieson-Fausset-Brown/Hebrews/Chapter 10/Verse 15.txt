<p><b>15.</b> The <i>Greek,</i> has
	"moreover," or "now." 
	</p>
<p><b>is a witness</b>—of the
	truth which I am setting forth. The Father's witness is given <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The Son's, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span>.
	Now is added that of the Holy Spirit, called accordingly "the
	Spirit of grace," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>.
	The testimony of all Three leads to the same conclusion (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29- :">Hebrews 10:29- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>for after that he had said
	before</b>—The conclusion to the sentence is in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29- :">Hebrews 10:29- :</span>, "<i>After</i> He had said before, This is the
	covenant that I will make with them (<i>with the house of Israel,</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10">Hebrews 8:10</span>; here extended to the
	spiritual Israel) . . . saith the Lord; I will put (literally,
	'giving,' referring to the <i>giving</i> of the law; not now as then,
	<i>giving into the hands,</i> but <i>giving</i>) My laws into their
	hearts ('mind,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10">Hebrews 8:10</span>) and
	in their minds ('hearts,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10- :">Hebrews 8:10- :</span>); I will <i>inscribe</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>) them (here He
	omits the addition quoted in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10">Hebrews 8:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:11">Hebrews 8:11</span>, <i>I will be to them a
	God . . . and they shall not teach every man his neighbor . . .</i>),
	and (that is, <i>after He had said the foregoing,</i> HE
	THEN ADDS) their sins . . . will I remember no more." The
	great object of the quotation here is to prove that, there being <i>in
	the Gospel covenant,</i> "REMISSION
	of sins" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:17">Hebrews 10:17</span>),
	there is no more need of a sacrifice for sins. The object of the same
	quotation in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:8-13">Hebrews 8:8-13</span>
	is to show that, there being a "NEW
	covenant," the old is antiquated.</p>
