<p><b>18. where remission of these is</b>—as

"Here ends the finale (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) of the great tripartite arrangement (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:1-25">Hebrews 7:1-25</span>;

	of the middle portion of the Epistle. Its great theme was Christ a
	High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. What it is to be
	a high priest after the order of Melchisedec is set forth, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13-58.9.10- :">Hebrews 9:13-58.9.10- :</span>, as contrasted with the Aaronic order. That Christ,
	however, as High Priest, is Aaron's antitype in the true holy place,
	by virtue of His self-sacrifice here on earth, and Mediator of a
	better covenant, whose essential character the old only typified, we
	learn, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26-9">Hebrews 7:26-9</span>.
	And that Christ's self-sacrifice, offered through the Eternal Spirit,
	is of everlasting power, as contrasted with the unavailing cycle of
	legal offerings, is established in the third part, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26-58.7.9- :">Hebrews 7:26-58.7.9- :</span>; the first half of this last portion [<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26-58.7.9- :">Hebrews 7:26-58.7.9- :</span>], showing that both our present possession of salvation,
	and our future completion of it, are as certain to us as that He is
	with God, ruling as a Priest and reigning as a King, once more to
	appear, no more as a bearer of our sins, but in glory as a Judge. The
	second half, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1-18">Hebrews 10:1-18</span>,
	reiterating the main position of the whole, the High Priesthood of
	Christ, grounded on His offering of Himself—its kingly character
	its eternal accomplishment of its end, confirmed by Psalms 40 and 110
	and Jeremiah 31" [DELITZSCH
