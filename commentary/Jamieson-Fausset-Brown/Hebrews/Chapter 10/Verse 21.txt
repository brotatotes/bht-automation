<p><b>21. high priest</b>—As a different
	<i>Greek</i> term (<i>archiereus</i>) is used always elsewhere in
	this Epistle for "high priest," translate as <i>Greek</i>
	here, "A <i>Great</i> Priest"; one who is at once King and
	"Priest on His throne" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); a royal Priest, and a priestly King. 
	</p>
<p><b>house of God</b>—the
	spiritual house, the <i>Church,</i> made up of believers, whose home
	is <i>heaven,</i> where Jesus now is (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span>). Thus, by "the
	house of God," over which Jesus is, <i>heaven</i> is included in
	meaning, as well as the <i>Church,</i> whose home it is.</p>
