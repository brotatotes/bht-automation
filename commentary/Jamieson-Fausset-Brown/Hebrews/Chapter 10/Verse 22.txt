<p><b>22.</b> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:19">Hebrews 7:19</span>.) 
	</p>
<p><b>with a true heart</b>—without
	hypocrisy; "in truth, and with a perfect heart"; a heart
	thoroughly imbued with "the truth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:19- :">Hebrews 7:19- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>full assurance</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:19- :">Hebrews 7:19- :</span>); with no doubt as to our acceptance when coming to God by
	the blood of Christ. As "faith" occurs here, so "<i>hope,</i>"
	and "<i>love,</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:24">Hebrews 10:24</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>sprinkled from</b>—that is,
	sprinkled <i>so as to be cleansed</i> from. 
	</p>
<p><b>evil conscience</b>—a
	consciousness of guilt unatoned for, and uncleansed away (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:2">Hebrews 10:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span>). Both the <i>hearts</i>
	and the <i>bodies</i> are cleansed. The legal purifications were with
	blood of animal victims and with water, and could only cleanse the
	<i>flesh</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:21">Hebrews 9:21</span>).
	Christ's blood purifies the <i>heart</i> and conscience. The Aaronic
	priest, in entering the holy place, washed with <i>water</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:21- :">Hebrews 9:21- :</span>) in the brazen laver. Believers, as priests to God, are once
	for all washed in BODY (as distinguished from "hearts") at
	baptism. As we have an immaterial, and a material nature, the
	cleansing of both is expressed by "hearts" and "body,"
	the inner and the outer man; so the whole man, material and
	immaterial. The baptism of the body, however, is not the mere putting
	away of material filth, nor an act operating by intrinsic efficacy,
	but the sacramental seal, applied to the outer man, of a spiritual
	washing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21">1 Peter 3:21</span>). "Body"
	(not merely "flesh," the <i>carnal</i> part, as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:21- :">1 Peter 3:21- :</span>) includes the <i>whole</i> material man, which needs
	cleansing, as being redeemed, as well as the soul. The body, once
	polluted with sin, is washed, so as to be fitted like Christ's holy
	body, and by His body, to be spiritually a pure and living offering.
	On the "pure water," the symbol of consecration and
	sanctification, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:34">John 19:34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:6">1 John 5:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:25">Ezekiel 36:25</span>. The perfects "having
	. . . hearts <i>sprinkled</i> . . . body (the <i>Greek</i> is
	singular) <i>washed,</i>" imply a continuing state produced by a
	once-for-all accomplished act, namely, our justification by faith
	through Christ's blood, and consecration to God, sealed sacramentally
	by the baptism of our body.</p>
