<p><b>25. assembling of ourselves
	together</b>—The <i>Greek,</i> "<i>episunagoge,</i>" is
	only found here and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1">2 Thessalonians 2:1</span> (the
	gathering together of the elect to Christ at His coming, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:1- :">2 Thessalonians 2:1- :</span>). The assembling or gathering of ourselves for Christian
	communion in private and public, is an earnest of our being gathered
	together to Him at His appearing. Union is strength; continual
	assemblings together beget and foster <i>love,</i> and give good
	opportunities for "provoking to good works," by "exhorting
	one another" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:13">Hebrews 3:13</span>).
	IGNATIUS says, "When
	ye frequently, and in numbers meet together, the powers of Satan are
	overthrown, and his mischief is neutralized by your likemindedness in
	the faith." To neglect such assemblings together might end in
	apostasy at last. He avoids the <i>Greek</i> term "<i>sunagoge,</i>"
	as suggesting the Jewish <i>synagogue</i> meetings (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:13- :">Hebrews 3:13- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>as the manner of some
	is</b>—"manner," that is, habit, custom. This gentle
	expression proves he is not here as yet speaking of <i>apostasy.</i>

<p><b>the day approaching</b>—This,
	the shortest designation of the day of the Lord's coming, occurs
	elsewhere only in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:13">1 Corinthians 3:13</span>; a
	confirmation of the Pauline authorship of this Epistle. The Church
	being <i>in all ages</i> kept uncertain how soon Christ is coming,
	<i>the day</i> is, and has been, in each age, practically always
	near; whence, believers have been called on always to be watching for
	it as nigh at hand. The Hebrews were now living close upon One of
	those great types and foretastes of it, the destruction of Jerusalem
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:1">Matthew 24:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:2">Matthew 24:2</span>),
	"the bloody and fiery dawn of the great day; that day is the day
	of days, the ending day of all days, the settling day of all days,
	the day of the promotion of time into eternity, the day which, for
	the Church, breaks through and breaks off the night of the present
	world" [DELITZSCH in
	ALFORD].</p>
