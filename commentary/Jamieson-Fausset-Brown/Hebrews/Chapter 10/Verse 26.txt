	here it is, that if there be lukewarmness in Christian communion,
	apostasy may ensue.

<p><b>if we sin</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	present participle: if we be found <i>sinning,</i> that is, not
	isolated acts, but a <i>state</i> of sin [ALFORD].
	A violation not only of the <i>law,</i> but of the whole economy of
	the New Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:28">Hebrews 10:28</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>).

<p><b>wilfully</b>—presumptuously,
	<i>Greek</i> "willingly." After receiving "full
	knowledge (so the <i>Greek,</i> compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29- :">Hebrews 10:29- :</span>) of the truth," by having been "enlightened,"
	and by having "tasted" a certain measure even of grace of
	"the Holy Ghost" (the Spirit of truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29- :">Hebrews 10:29- :</span>; and "the Spirit of grace," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29- :">Hebrews 10:29- :</span>): to <i>fall away</i> (as "sin" here means,

	infidelity, is not a sin of <i>ignorance,</i> or error ("<i>out

	sinning</i> against the Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:2">Hebrews 5:2</span>): <i>such</i> sinning,
	where a consciousness of Gospel obligations not only was, but is
	present: a sinning presumptuously and preseveringly against Christ's
	redemption <i>for</i> us, and the Spirit of grace <i>in</i> us. "He
	only who stands high can fall low. A lively reference in the soul to
	what is good is necessary in order to be thoroughly wicked; hence,
	man can be more reprobate than the beasts, and the apostate angels
	than apostate man" [THOLUCK].
