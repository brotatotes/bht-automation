<p><b>27. a certain</b>—an extraordinary
	and indescribable. The indefiniteness, as of something <i>peculiar of
	its kind,</i> makes the description the more terrible (compare <i>Greek,</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>looking for</b>—"expectation":
	a later sense of the <i>Greek.</i> ALFORD
	strangely translates, as the <i>Greek</i> usually means elsewhere,
	"reception." The transition is easy from "giving a
	reception to" something or someone, to "looking for."
	Contrast the "expecting" (the very same <i>Greek</i> as
	here), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:13">Hebrews 10:13</span>, which
	refutes ALFORD. 
	</p>
<p><b>fiery indignation</b>—literally,
	"zeal of fire." Fire is personified: glow or ardor of fire,
	that is, of Him who is "a consuming fire." 
	</p>
<p><b>devour</b>—continually.</p>
