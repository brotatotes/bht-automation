<p><b>29. sorer</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"worse," namely, "punishment" (literally,
	"vengeance") than any mere temporal punishment of the body.
	</p>
<p><b>suppose ye</b>—an appeal to
	the Hebrews' reason and conscience. 
	</p>
<p><b>thought worthy</b>—by God
	at the judgment. 
	</p>
<p><b>trodden under foot the Son of
	God</b>—by "wilful" apostasy. So he treads under foot God
	Himself who "glorified His <i>Son</i> as an high priest"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:5">Hebrews 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6">Hebrews 6:6</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>an unholy thing</b>—literally,
	"common," as opposed to "sanctified." No better
	than the blood of a common man, thus involving the consequence that
	Christ, in claiming to be God, was guilty of blasphemy, and so
	deserved to die! 
	</p>
<p><b>wherewith he was
	sanctified</b>—for Christ died even for him. "Sanctified,"
	in the fullest sense, belongs only to the saved elect. But in some
	sense it belongs also to those who have gone a far way in Christian
	experience, and yet fall away at last. The higher such a one's past
	Christian experiences, the deeper his fall. 
	</p>
<p><b>done despite unto</b>—by
	repelling in <i>fact:</i> as "blasphemy" is despite in
	<i>words</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:29">Mark 3:29</span>). "Of
	the Jews who became Christians and relapsed to Judaism, we find from
	the history of Uriel Acosta, that they required a blasphemy against
	Christ. 'They applied to Him epithets used against Molech the
	adulterous branch,' c." [THOLUCK].
	</p>
<p><b>the Spirit of grace</b>—the
	Spirit that confers grace. "He who does not accept the benefit,
	insults Him who confers it. He hath made thee a son: wilt thou become
	a slave? He has come to take up His abode with thee but thou art
	introducing evil into thyself" [CHRYSOSTOM].
	"It is the curse of evil eternally to propagate evil: so, for
	him who profanes the Christ <i>without him,</i> and blasphemes the
	Christ <i>within him,</i> there is subjectively no renewal of a
	change of mind (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6">Hebrews 6:6</span>), and
	objectively no new <i>sacrifice for sins</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:6- :">Hebrews 6:6- :</span>) [THOLUCK].</p>
