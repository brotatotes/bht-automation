<p><b>a remembrance</b>—a
	recalling to mind by the high priest's confession, on the day of
	atonement, of the sins both of each past year and of all former
	years, proving that the expiatory sacrifices of former years were not
	felt by men's consciences to have fully atoned for former sins in
	fact, the expiation and remission were only legal and typical
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:4">Hebrews 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:11">Hebrews 10:11</span>).
	The Gospel remission, on the contrary, is so complete, that sins are
	"remembered no more" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:11- :">Hebrews 10:11- :</span>) by God. It is unbelief to "forget" this
	once-for-all purgation, and to fear on account of "former sins"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:9">2 Peter 1:9</span>). The believer, once
	for all <i>bathed,</i> needs only to "wash" his hands and
	"feet" of soils, according as he daily contracts them, in
	Christ's blood (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:10">John 13:10</span>).</p>
