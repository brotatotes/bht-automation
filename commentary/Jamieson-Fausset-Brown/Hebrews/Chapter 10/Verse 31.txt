31. fearful . . . to fall into the
	hands—It is good like David to fall into the hands of God,
	rather than man, when one does so with filial faith in his
	father's love, though God chastises him. "It is fearful"
	to fall into His hands as a reprobate and presumptuous sinner doomed
	to His just vengeance as Judge ( :-). 
	living God—therefore
	able to punish for ever ( :-).
