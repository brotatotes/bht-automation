<p><b>31. fearful . . . to fall into the
	hands</b>—It is good like David <i>to fall into the hands of God,</i>
	rather than man, when one does so with filial <i>faith</i> in his
	father's love, though God <i>chastises</i> him. "It is fearful"
	to fall into His hands as a reprobate and presumptuous sinner doomed
	to His just vengeance as Judge (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>living God</b>—therefore
	able to punish for ever (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
