<p><b>35-37.</b> Consequent exhortation to
	confidence and endurance, as Christ is soon coming. 
	</p>
<p><b>Cast not away</b>—implying
	that they now have "confidence," and that it will not
	withdraw of itself, unless they "cast it away" wilfully
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14">Hebrews 3:14</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>which</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the which": inasmuch as being such as. 
	</p>
<p><b>hath</b>—present tense: it
	is as certain as if you had it in your hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:14- :">Hebrews 3:14- :</span>). It hath in reversion. 
	</p>
<p><b>recompense of reward</b>—of
	grace not of debt: a reward of a kind which no mercenary self-seeker
	would seek: holiness will be its own reward; self-devoting
	unselfishness for Christ's sake will be its own rich recompense (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:2- :">Hebrews 2:2- :</span>).</p>
