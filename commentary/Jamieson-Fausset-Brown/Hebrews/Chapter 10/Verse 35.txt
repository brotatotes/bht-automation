	Cast not away—implying
	that they now have "confidence," and that it will not
	withdraw of itself, unless they "cast it away" wilfully

	recompense of reward—of
	grace not of debt: a reward of a kind which no mercenary self-seeker

	unselfishness for Christ's sake will be its own rich recompense (see
	on Hebrews 2:2; Hebrews 2:2- :).
