<p><b>36. patience</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"waiting endurance," or "enduring perseverance":
	the kindred <i>Greek</i> verb in the <i>Septuagint,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, is translated, "<i>wait for</i> it" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>after ye have done the will
	of God</b>—"that whereas ye have done the will of God"
	hitherto (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:32-35">Hebrews 10:32-35</span>),
	ye may now show also <i>patient, persevering endurance,</i> and so
	"receive the promise," that is, the promised reward:
	eternal life and bliss commensurate with our work of faith and love
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:10-12">Hebrews 6:10-12</span>). We must
	not only <i>do,</i> but also <i>suffer</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:10-58.6.12- :">Hebrews 6:10-58.6.12- :</span>). God first uses the <i>active</i> talents of His servants;
	then polishes the other side of the stone, making the <i>passive</i>
	graces shine, <i>patience, meekness,</i> c. It may be also
	translated, "That ye may do the will of God, and receive,"
	&amp;c. [ALFORD]:
	"patience" itself is a further and a persevering doing of
	"God's will" otherwise it would be profitless and no real
	grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:21">Matthew 7:21</span>). We should
	look, not merely for individual bliss now and at death, but for the
	great and general consummation of bliss of all saints, both in body
	and soul.</p>
