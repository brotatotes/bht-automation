<p><b>saving of the soul</b>â€”literally,
	"acquisition (or <i>obtaining</i>) of the soul." The
	kindred <i>Greek</i> verb is applied to Christ's <i>acquiring</i> the
	Church as the <i>purchase</i> of His blood (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:12- :">Romans 8:12- :</span>). If we <i>acquire</i> or <i>obtain</i> our soul's
	salvation, it is through Him who has obtained it for us by His
	bloodshedding. "The unbelieving man <i>loses his soul:</i> for
	not being God's, neither is he his own [compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:26">Matthew 16:26</span>;

	by linking it to God" [DELITZSCH
