<p><b>5.</b> Christ's voluntary self
	offering, in contrast to those inefficient sacrifices, is shown to
	fulfill perfectly "the will of God" as to our redemption,
	by completely atoning "for (our) sins." 
	</p>
<p><b>Wherefore</b>—seeing that a
	nobler than animal sacrifices was needed to "take away sins."
	</p>
<p><b>when he cometh</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"coming." The time referred to is the period <i>before</i>
	His entrance into the world, when the inefficiency of animal
	sacrifices for expiation had been proved [THOLUCK].
	Or, the time is that between Jesus' first dawning of reason as a
	child, and the beginning of His public ministry, during which, being
	ripened in human resolution, He was intently devoting Himself to the
	doing of His Father's will [ALFORD].
	But the time of "coming" is <i>present;</i> not "when
	He had come," but "when <i>coming</i> into the world";
	so, in order to accord with ALFORD'S
	view, "the world" must mean His PUBLIC
	ministry: when coming, or about to come, into <i>public.</i> The
	<i>Greek</i> verbs are in the past: "sacrifice . . . Thou <i>didst</i>
	not wish, but a body Thou <i>didst</i> prepare for Me"; and,
	"Lo, <i>I am come.</i>" Therefore, in order to harmonize
	these times, the present <i>coming,</i> or about to come, with the
	past, "A body Thou <i>didst</i> prepare for Me," we must
	either explain as ALFORD,
	or else, if we take the period to be <i>before</i> His actual arrival
	in the world (the earth) or <i>incarnation,</i> we must explain the
	<i>past</i> tenses to refer to God's <i>purpose,</i> which speaks of
	what He designed from eternity as though it were already fulfilled.
	"A body Thou didst prepare in Thy eternal counsel." This
	seems to me more likely than explaining "coming into the world,"
	"<i>coming into public,</i>" or entering on His public
	ministry. David, in the fortieth Psalm (here quoted), reviews his
	past troubles and God's having delivered him from them, and his
	consequent desire to render willing obedience to God as more
	acceptable than sacrifices; but the Spirit puts into his mouth
	language finding its partial application to David, and its full
	realization only in the divine Son of David. "The more any son
	of man approaches the incarnate Son of God in position, or office, or
	individual spiritual experience, the more directly may his holy
	breathings in the power of Christ's Spirit be taken as utterances of
	Christ Himself. Of all men, the prophet-king of Israel resembled and
	foreshadowed Him the most" [ALFORD].

<p><b>a body hast thou prepared
	me</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "Thou didst <i>fit</i> for Me a body."
	"In Thy counsels <i>Thou didst determine to make for Me a body,</i>
	to be given up to death as a sacrificial victim" [WAHL].
	In the <i>Hebrew,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:6">Psalms 40:6</span>,
	it is "mine ears hast thou opened," or "dug."
	Perhaps this alludes to the custom of <i>boring the ear of a slave
	who volunteers to remain under his master when he might be free.</i>
	Christ's assuming a human <i>body,</i> in obedience to the Father's
	will, in order to die the death of a slave (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:6- :">Psalms 40:6- :</span>), was virtually the same act of voluntary submission to
	service as that of a slave suffering his ear to be bored by his
	master. His <i>willing obedience to the Father's will</i> is what is
	dwelt on as giving especial virtue to His sacrifice (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:7">Hebrews 10:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:9">Hebrews 10:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:10">Hebrews 10:10</span>).
	The <i>preparing,</i> or <i>fitting of a body</i> for Him, is not
	with a view to His mere incarnation, but to His expiatory <i>sacrifice</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:10">Hebrews 10:10</span>), as the <i>contrast</i>
	to "sacrifice and offering" requires; compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+7:4">Romans 7:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:16">Ephesians 2:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:22">Colossians 1:22</span>.
	More probably "opened mine ears" means <i>opened mine
	inward ear,</i> so as to be attentively obedient to what God wills me
	to do, namely, to assume the body He has prepared for me for my
	sacrifice, so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+33:16">Job 33:16</span>,
	<i>Margin;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+36:10">Job 36:10</span>
	(doubtless the boring of a slave's "ear" was the symbol of
	<i>such willing obedience</i>); <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+36:10- :">Job 36:10- :</span>, "The Lord God hath opened mine ear," that is,
	made me <i>obediently</i> attentive as a slave to his master. Others
	somewhat similarly explain, "Mine ears hast thou digged,"
	or "<i>fashioned,</i>" not with allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+36:10- :">Job 36:10- :</span>, but to the true office of the ear—a willing, submissive
	attention to the voice of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:4">Isaiah 50:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+50:5">Isaiah 50:5</span>). The forming of the ear
	implies the preparation of the body, that is, the incarnation; this
	secondary idea, really in the <i>Hebrew,</i> though less prominent,
	is the one which Paul uses for his argument. In either explanation
	the idea of Christ taking on Him the form, and becoming <i>obedient
	as a servant,</i> is implied. As He assumed a body in which to make
	His self-sacrifice, so ought we <i>present</i> our <i>bodies a living
	sacrifice</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1">Romans 12:1</span>).</p>
