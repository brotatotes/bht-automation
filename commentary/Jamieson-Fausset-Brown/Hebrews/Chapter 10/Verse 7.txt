<p><b>7. I come</b>—rather, "I am
	come" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:1">Hebrews 10:1</span>).
	"Here we have the creed, as it were, of Jesus: '<i>I am come</i>
	to fulfil the law,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:17">Matthew 5:17</span>; to
	preach, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:38">Mark 1:38</span>; to call
	sinners to repentance, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:32">Luke 5:32</span>;
	to send a sword and to set men at variance, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:34">Matthew 10:34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:35">Matthew 10:35</span>; I came down from
	heaven to do the will of Him that sent me, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:38">John 6:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span> (so here, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:7">Psalms 40:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:8">Psalms 40:8</span>); I am sent to the lost
	sheep of the house of Israel, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:8- :">Psalms 40:8- :</span>; I am come into this world for judgment, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:8- :">Psalms 40:8- :</span>; I am come that they might have life, and might have it more
	abundantly, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:10">John 10:10</span>; to save
	what had been lost, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:11">Matthew 18:11</span>;
	to seek and to save that which was lost, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:11- :">Matthew 18:11- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>; to
	save men's lives, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:56">Luke 9:56</span>; to
	send fire on the earth, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:49">Luke 12:49</span>;
	to minister, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>; as "the
	Light," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46">John 12:46</span>; to
	bear witness unto the truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46- :">John 12:46- :</span>. See, reader, that thy Saviour obtain what He aimed at in
	thy case. Moreover, do thou for thy part say, why thou art come here?
	Dost thou, then, also, do the will of God? From what time? and in
	what way?" [BENGEL].
	When the two goats on the day of atonement were presented before the
	Lord, that goat on which the lot of the Lord should fall was to be
	offered as a sin offering; and that lot was lifted up on high in the
	hand of the high priest, and then laid upon the head of the goat
	which was to die; so the <i>hand</i> of God <i>determined</i> all
	that was done to Christ. Besides the covenant of God with man through
	Christ's blood, there was another covenant made by the Father with
	the Son from eternity. The condition was, "If He shall make His
	soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed," &amp;c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46- :">John 12:46- :</span>). The Son accepted the condition, "Lo, I come to do
	Thy will, O God" [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. Oblation,
	intercession, and benediction, are His three priestly offices.

<p><b>in the volume,</b>
	&amp;c.—literally, "the roll": the parchment manuscript
	being wrapped around a cylinder headed with knobs. Here, the
	Scripture "volume" meant is the fortieth Psalm. "By
	this very passage 'written of Me,' I undertake to do Thy will
	[namely, that I should die for the sins of the world, in order that
	all who believe may be saved, not by animal sacrifices, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46- :">John 12:46- :</span>, but by My death]." This is the written contract of
	Messiah (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ne+9:38">Nehemiah 9:38</span>),
	whereby He engaged to be our surety. So complete is the inspiration
	of all that is written, so great the authority of the Psalms, that
	what David says is really what Christ then and there said.</p>
