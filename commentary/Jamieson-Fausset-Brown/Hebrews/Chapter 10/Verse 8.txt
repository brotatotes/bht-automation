<p><b>Sacrifice,</b> c.—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "<i>Sacrifices</i> and <i>offerings</i>"
	(plural). This verse combines the two clauses previously quoted
	distinctly, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:5">Hebrews 10:5</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:6">Hebrews 10:6</span>,
