<p><b>15.</b> As Abraham, had he desired
	to leave his pilgrim life in Canaan, and resume his former fixed
	habitation in Ur, among the carnal and worldly, had in his long life
	ample opportunities to have done so; and so spiritually, as to all
	believers who came out from the world to become God's people, they
	might, if they had been so minded, have easily gone back.</p>
