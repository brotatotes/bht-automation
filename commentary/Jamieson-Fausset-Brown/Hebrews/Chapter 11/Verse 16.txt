<p><b>is not ashamed</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Is not ashamed of them." Not merely once did God call
	himself <i>their God,</i> but He is NOW
	not ashamed to have Himself called so, they being <i>alive</i> and
	abiding with Him where He is. For, by the law, God cannot come into
	contact with anything dead. None remained dead in Christ's presence
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:37">Luke 20:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:38">Luke 20:38</span>).
	He who is Lord and Maker of heaven and earth, and all things therein,
	when asked, What is Thy name? said, omitting all His other titles, "I
	am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob"
	[THEODORET]. Not only is
	He <i>not ashamed,</i> but glories in the name and relation to His
	people. The "wherefore" does not mean that God's <i>good
	pleasure</i> is the meritorious, but the <i>gracious,</i> consequence
	of their obedience (that obedience being the result of His Spirit's
	work in them in the first instance). He first so "called"
	Himself, then they so called Him.
