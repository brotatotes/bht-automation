<p><b>17. offered up</b>—literally,
	"hath offered up," as if the work and its praise were yet
	enduring [ALFORD]. As far
	as His intention was concerned, he did sacrifice Isaac; and in actual
	fact "he offered him," as far as the presentation of him on
	the altar as an offering to God is concerned. 
	</p>
<p><b>tried</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"tempted," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:1">Genesis 22:1</span>.
	<i>Put to the proof</i> of his faith. Not that God "tempts"
	<i>to sin,</i> but God "tempts" in the sense of <i>proving</i>
	or <i>trying</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:1- :">Genesis 22:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and</b>—and so. 
	</p>
<p><b>he that had received</b>—rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "accepted," that is, <i>welcomed</i> and
	embraced by faith, not merely "had the promises," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:1- :">Genesis 22:1- :</span>. This added to the difficulty in the way of his faith, that
	it was in Isaac's posterity the promises were to be fulfilled; how
	then could they be fulfilled if Isaac were sacrificed? 
	</p>
<p><b>offered up</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "was offering up"; he was in the act of
	offering. 
	</p>
<p><b>his only-begotten son</b>—Compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:2">Genesis 22:2</span>, "Take now thy son,
	thine only son." EUSEBIUS
	[<i>The Preparation of the Gospel,</i> 1.10, and 4.16], has preserved
	a fragment of a <i>Greek</i> translation of Sanchoniatho, which
	mentions a mystical sacrifice of the Phoelignicians, wherein a prince
	in royal robes was the offerer, and his only son was to be the
	victim: this evidently was a tradition derived from Abraham's
	offering, and handed down through Esau or Edom, Isaac's son. Isaac
	was Abraham's "only-begotten son" in respect of Sarah and
	the promises: he sent away his other sons, by other wives (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:2- :">Genesis 22:2- :</span>). Abraham is a type of the Father not sparing His
	only-begotten Son to fulfil the divine purpose of love. God nowhere
	in the Mosaic law allowed human sacrifices, though He claimed the
	first-born of Israel as His.</p>
