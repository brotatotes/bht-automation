<p><b>18. Of whom</b>—rather as <i>Greek</i>
	"He (<i>Abraham,</i> not Isaac) TO whom it was said"
	[ALFORD]. BENGEL
	supports <i>English Version.</i> So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> uses the same <i>Greek</i> preposition, "unto," for
	"in respect to," or "of." This verse gives a
	definition of the "only-begotten Son" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in Isaac shall thy seed be
	called</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:12">Genesis 21:12</span>). The
	posterity of Isaac alone shall be accounted as the seed of Abraham,
	which is the heir of the promises (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+21:12- :">Genesis 21:12- :</span>).</p>
