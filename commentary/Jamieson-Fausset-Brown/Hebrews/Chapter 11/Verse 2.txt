	"were testified of," namely, favorably (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:40- :">Hebrews 11:40- :</span>). It is a phrase of Luke, Paul's companion. Not only men, but
	God, gave testimony to their faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:4">Hebrews 11:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span>).
	Thus they being testified of themselves have become "witnesses"
	to all others (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>). The
	earlier elders had their patience exercised for a long period of
	life: those later, in sharper afflictions. Many things which they
	hoped for and did not see, subsequently came to pass and were
	conspicuously seen, the event confirming faith [BENGEL].</p>
