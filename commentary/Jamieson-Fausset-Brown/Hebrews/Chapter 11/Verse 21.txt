<p><b>21. both the sons</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>each</i> of the sons" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+47:29">Genesis 47:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:8-20">Genesis 48:8-20</span>). He knew not
	Joseph's sons, and could not distinguish them by sight, yet <i>he did
	distinguish them by faith,</i> transposing his hands intentionally,
	so as to lay his right hand on the younger, Ephraim, whose posterity
	was to be greater than that of Manasseh: he also adopted these
	grandchildren as his own sons, after having transferred the right of
	primogeniture to Joseph (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:22">Genesis 48:22</span>).

<p><b>and worshipped</b>—This did
	not take place in immediate connection with the foregoing, but before
	it, when Jacob made Joseph swear that he would bury him with his
	fathers in Canaan, not in Egypt. The assurance that Joseph would do
	so filled him with pious gratitude to God, which he expressed by
	raising himself on his bed to an attitude of <i>worship.</i> His
	faith, as Joseph's (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:22">Hebrews 11:22</span>),
	consisted in his so confidentially anticipating the fulfilment of
	God's promise of Canaan to his descendants, as to desire to be buried
	there as his proper possession.

<p><i><b>leaning</b></i><b> upon
	the top of his staff</b>— <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:22- :">Hebrews 11:22- :</span>, <i>Hebrew</i> and <i>English Version,</i> "upon the
	bed's head." The <i>Septuagint</i> translates as Paul here.
	JEROME justly reprobates
	the notion of modern Rome, that Jacob <i>worshipped the top of
	Joseph's staff,</i> having on it an image of Joseph's power, to which
	Jacob bowed in recognition of the future sovereignty of his son's
	tribe, the father bowing to the son! The <i>Hebrew,</i> as translated
	in <i>English Version,</i> sets it aside: <i>the bed</i> is alluded
	to afterwards (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:2">Genesis 48:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:33">Genesis 49:33</span>),
	and it is likely that Jacob turned himself in his <i>bed</i> so as to
	have his face toward the pillow, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:33- :">Genesis 49:33- :</span> (there were no <i>bedsteads</i> in the East). Paul by
	adopting the <i>Septuagint</i> version, brings out, under the Spirit,
	<i>an additional fact,</i> namely, that the aged patriarch used <i>his
	own</i> (not Joseph's) <i>staff</i> to lean on in worshipping on his
	bed. The <i>staff,</i> too, was the <i>emblem of his pilgrim state</i>
	here on his way to his heavenly city (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:14">Hebrews 11:14</span>), wherein God had so
	wonderfully supported him. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:14- :">Hebrews 11:14- :</span>, "With my <i>staff</i> I passed over Jordan, and now I
	am become," c. (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:11">Exodus 12:11</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:8">Mark 6:8</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:8- :">Mark 6:8- :</span>, the same thing is said of David's "bowing on his bed,"
	an act of adoring thanksgiving to God for God's favor to his son
	before death. He omits the more leading blessing of the twelve sons
	of Jacob; because "he plucks only the flowers which stand by his
	way, and leaves the whole meadow full to his readers" [DELITZSCH
	in ALFORD].</p>
