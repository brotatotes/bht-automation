<p><b>the reproach of Christ</b>—that
	is, the reproach which falls on the Church, and which Christ regards
	as His own reproach, He being the Head, and the Church (both of the
	Old and New Testament) His body. Israel typified Christ; Israel's
	sufferings were Christ's sufferings (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:5">2 Corinthians 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:24">Colossians 1:24</span>). As uncircumcision was
	Egypt's <i>reproach,</i> so circumcision was the badge of Israel's
	expectation of Christ, which Moses especially cherished, and which
	the Gentiles reproached Israel on account of. Christ's people's
	reproach will ere long be their great glory.
