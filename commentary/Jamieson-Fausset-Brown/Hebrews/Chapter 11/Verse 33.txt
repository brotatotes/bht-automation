<p><b>33. subdued kingdoms</b>—as David
	did (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+8:1">2 Samuel 8:1</span>, c.) so also Gideon
	subdued Midian (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+7:1-25">Judges 7:1-25</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>wrought righteousness</b>—as
	Samuel did (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+8:9">1 Samuel 8:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+12:3-23">1 Samuel 12:3-23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:33">1 Samuel 15:33</span>); and David (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:33- :">1 Samuel 15:33- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>obtained promises</b>—as
	"the prophets" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:33- :">1 Samuel 15:33- :</span>) did; for through them the promises were given (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:33- :">1 Samuel 15:33- :</span>) [BENGEL].
	Rather, "obtained <i>the fulfilment</i> of promises," which
	had been previously the object of their <i>faith</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jos+21:45">Joshua 21:45</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+8:56">1 Kings 8:56</span>). Indeed, Gideon, Barak,
	c., also <i>obtained</i> the things which God promised. Not "<i>the</i>
	promises," which are still future (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13">Hebrews 11:13</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>stopped the mouths of
	lions</b>—Note the words, "because he <i>believed</i> in his
	God." Also Samson (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+14:6">Judges 14:6</span>),
	David (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+17:34-37">1 Samuel 17:34-37</span>),
	Benaiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+23:20">2 Samuel 23:20</span>).</p>
