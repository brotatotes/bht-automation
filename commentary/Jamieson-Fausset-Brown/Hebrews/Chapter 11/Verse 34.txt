34. Quenched the violence of fire—
	(Daniel 3:27). Not merely "quenched
	the fire," but "quenched the power (so the Greek) of
	the fire." Daniel 3:19-30;
	Daniel 6:12-23 record the last
	miracles of the Old Testament. So the martyrs of the Reformation,
	though not escaping the fire, were delivered from its having
	power really or lastingly to hurt them. 
	escaped . . . sword—So
	Jephthah (Judges 12:3); and so
	David escaped Saul's sword (1 Samuel 18:11;
	1 Samuel 19:10; 1 Samuel 19:12);
	Elijah (1 Kings 19:1; 2 Kings 6:14).
	out of weakness . . . made
	strong—Samson (Judges 16:28;
	Judges 15:19). Hezekiah (Judges 15:19- :). MILTON
	says of the martyrs, "They shook the powers of darkness with the
	irresistible power of weakness." 
	valiant in fight—Barak
	(Judges 4:14; Judges 4:15).
	And the Maccabees, the sons of Matthias, Judas, Jonathan, and Simon,
	who delivered the Jews from their cruel oppressor, Antiochus of
	Syria. 
	armies—literally,
	"camps" referring to Judges 4:15- :. But the reference may be to the Maccabees having put to
	flight the Syrians and other foes.
