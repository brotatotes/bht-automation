<p><b>35. Women received their dead
	raised</b>—as the widow of Zarephath (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The Shunammite (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The two oldest manuscripts read. "They received
	women of aliens by raising their dead." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> shows that the raising of the widow's son by Elijah led her
	to the faith, so that he thus <i>took</i> her into fellowship, an
	<i>alien</i> though she was. Christ, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, makes especial mention of the fact that Elijah was sent to
	an alien from Israel, a woman of Sarepta. Thus Paul may quote this as
	an instance of Elijah's faith, that at God's command he went to a
	Gentile city of Sidonia (contrary to Jewish prejudices), and there,
	as the fruit of faith, not only raised her dead son, but <i>received</i>
	her as a convert into the family of God, as <i>Vulgate</i> reads.
	Still, <i>English Version</i> may be the right reading.

<p><b>a better resurrection</b>—than
	that of the women's children "raised to life again"; or,
	than the resurrection which their foes could give them by delivering
	them from death (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:2">Daniel 12:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:35">Luke 20:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:11">Philippians 3:11</span>).
	The fourth of the brethren (referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:11- :">Philippians 3:11- :</span>) said to King Antiochus, "To be put to death by men, is
	to be chosen to look onward for the hopes which are of God, to be
	raised up again by Him; but for thee there is no resurrection to
	life." The writer of Second Maccabees <i>expressly disclaims
	inspiration,</i> which prevents our mistaking Paul's allusion here to
	it as if it sanctioned the Apocrypha as inspired. In quoting Daniel,
	he quotes a book <i>claiming inspiration,</i> and so tacitly
	sanctions that claim.</p>
