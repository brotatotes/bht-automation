<p><b>37. stoned</b>—as Zechariah, son
	of Jehoiada (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+24:20-22">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35">Matthew 23:35</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>sawn asunder</b>—as Isaiah
	was said to have been by Manasseh; but see my <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35- :">Matthew 23:35- :</span>
	to Isaiah. 
	</p>
<p><b>tempted</b>—<i>by their
	foes,</i> in the midst of their tortures, to renounce their faith;
	the most bitter aggravation of them. Or else, <i>by those of their
	own household,</i> as Job was [ESTIUS];
	or by the fiery darts of Satan, as Jesus was in His last trials
	[GLASSIUS]. Probably it
	included all three; they were <i>tempted</i> in every possible way,
	by friends and foes, by human and satanic agents, by caresses and
	afflictions, by words and deeds, to forsake God, but in vain, through
	the power of faith.

<p><b>sword</b>—literally, "they
	died in the murder of the sword." In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35- :">Matthew 23:35- :</span> the contrary is given as an effect of <i>faith,</i> "they
	escaped the edge of the sword." Both alike are marvellous
	effects of faith. In both accomplishes great things and suffers great
	things, without counting it suffering [CHRYSOSTOM].
	Urijah was so slain by Jehoiakim (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35- :">Matthew 23:35- :</span>); and <i>the prophets</i> in Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:35- :">Matthew 23:35- :</span>).

<p><b>in sheepskins</b>—as Elijah
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:13">1 Kings 19:13</span>, <i>Septuagint</i>).
	They were <i>white;</i> as the "goat-skins" were <i>black</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:4">Zechariah 13:4</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>tormented</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in evil state."</p>
