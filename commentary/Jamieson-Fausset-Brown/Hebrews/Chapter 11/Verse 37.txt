	of Jehoiada (2 Chronicles 24:20-22;
	Matthew 23:35).

	was said to have been by Manasseh; but see my Matthew 23:35- :
	to Isaiah. 
	tempted—by their
	foes, in the midst of their tortures, to renounce their faith;
	the most bitter aggravation of them. Or else, by those of their
	own household, as Job was [ESTIUS];

	[GLASSIUS]. Probably it

	(1 Kings 19:13, Septuagint).
	They were white; as the "goat-skins" were black
	(compare Zechariah 13:4). 
	tormented—Greek,
	"in evil state."
