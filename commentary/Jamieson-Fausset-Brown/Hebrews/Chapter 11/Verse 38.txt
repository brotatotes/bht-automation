<p><b>38. Of whom the world was not
	worthy</b>—So far from their being unworthy of living in the world,
	as their exile in deserts, c., might seem to imply, "the world
	was not worthy of them." The world, in shutting them out, shut
	out from itself a source of blessing such as Joseph proved to
	Potiphar (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+39:5">Genesis 39:5</span>), and Jacob to
	Laban (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+30:27">Genesis 30:27</span>). In condemning
	them, the world condemned itself. 
	</p>
<p><b>caves</b>—literally,
	"chinks." Palestine, from its hilly character, abounds in
	<i>fissures</i> and caves, affording shelter to the persecuted, as
	the fifty hid by Obadiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:4">1 Kings 18:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+18:13">1 Kings 18:13</span>) and Elijah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:8">1 Kings 19:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+19:13">1 Kings 19:13</span>); and Mattathias and
	his sons (<u>1 Maccabees 2:28, 29</u>); and Judas Maccabeus (<u>2
	Maccabees 5:27</u>).</p>
