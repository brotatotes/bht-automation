<p><b>39. having obtained a good
	report</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i> "being borne witness of." <i>Though</i>
	they were so, yet "they received not the promise," that is,
	the <i>final completion</i> of "salvation" <i>promised</i>
	at Christ's coming again (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); "the eternal inheritance" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Abraham did <i>obtain</i> the very thing <i>promised</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:15">Hebrews 6:15</span>) <i>in part,</i>
	namely, blessedness <i>in soul</i> after death, by virtue of faith in
	Christ about to come. The <i>full</i> blessedness of body and soul
	shall not be till the full number of the elect shall be accomplished,
	and all together, no one preceding the other, shall enter on the full
	glory and bliss. Moreover, in another point of view, "It is
	probable that some accumulation of blessedness was added to holy
	souls, when Christ came and fulfilled all things even as at His
	burial many rose from the dead, who doubtless ascended to heaven with
	Him" [FLACIUS in
	BENGEL]. (Compare <i>Note,</i>
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:15- :">Hebrews 6:15- :</span>). The <i>perfecting</i>
	of believers in title, and in respect to conscience, took place once
	for all, at the death of Christ, by virtue of His being made by death
	<i>perfect</i> as Saviour. Their <i>perfecting in soul</i> at, and
	ever after Christ's death, took place, and takes place at their
	death. But the universal and final perfecting will not take place
	till Christ's coming.</p>
