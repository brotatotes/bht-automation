	forethought from eternity (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:8">Genesis 22:8</span>;

<p><b>some better thing for us</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:19">Hebrews 7:19</span>); than they had here.
	They had not in this world, "apart from us" (so the <i>Greek</i>
	is for "without us," that is, they had to wait for us for),
	the clear revelation of the promised salvation actually accomplished,
	as we now have it in Christ; in their state, beyond the grave their
	<i>souls</i> also seem to have attained an increase of <i>heavenly</i>
	bliss on the death and ascension of Christ; and they shall not attain
	the full and final <i>glory in body and soul</i> (the regeneration of
	the creature), until the full number of the elect (including us with
	them) is completed. The Fathers, CHRYSOSTOM,
	c., restricted the meaning of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:40">Hebrews 11:40</span> to this last truth, and
	I incline to this view. "The connection is, You, Hebrews, may
	far more easily exercise patience than Old Testament believers; for
	they had much longer to wait, and are still waiting until the elect
	are all gathered in; you, on the contrary, have not to wait for them"
	[ESTIUS]. I think his
	object in these verses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:40">Hebrews 11:40</span>) is to warn Hebrew
	Christians against their tendency to relapse into <i>Judaism.</i>
	"Though the Old Testament worthies attained such eminence by
	faith, they are not above us in privileges, but the reverse." It
	is not <i>we</i> who are perfected <i>with them,</i> but rather <i>they
	with us.</i> They <i>waited</i> for His coming; we enjoy Him as
	having come (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3">Hebrews 2:3</span>).
	Christ's death, the means of <i>perfecting</i> what the Jewish <i>law
	could not perfect,</i> was reserved for our time. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3- :">Hebrews 2:3- :</span>, "<i>perfecter</i> (<i>Greek</i>) of our faith."
	Now that Christ is come, they in soul share our blessedness, being
	"the spirits of the just made perfect" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3- :">Hebrews 2:3- :</span>); so ALFORD;
	however, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1- :">Hebrews 11:1- :</span> shows that the blood of Christ, brought into the heavenly
	holy place by Him, first opened an entrance into heaven (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:1- :">Hebrews 11:1- :</span>). Still, the fathers were in blessedness by faith in the
	Saviour to come, at death (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:15">Hebrews 6:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:22">Luke 16:22</span>).</p>
