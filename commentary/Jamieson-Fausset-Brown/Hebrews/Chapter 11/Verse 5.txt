<p><b>pleased God</b>—The
	Scripture testimony virtually expresses that he <i>pleased God,</i>
	namely, "Enoch walked with God." The <i>Septuagint</i>
	translates the <i>Hebrew</i> for "walked with God," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:52- :">1 Corinthians 15:52- :</span>, <i>pleased God.</i></p>
