<p><b>6. without</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>apart from</i> faith": if one be destitute of faith
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>to please</b>—Translate, as
	ALFORD does, the <i>Greek</i>
	aorist, "It is impossible to please God <i>at all</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23- :">Romans 14:23- :</span>). Natural amiabilities and "works done before the grace
	of Christ are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of
	faith in Jesus Christ; yea, rather, for that they are not done as God
	hath willed them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature of
	sin" [Article XIII, <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>]. Works not
	rooted in God are splendid sins [AUGUSTINE].
	</p>
<p><b>he that cometh to God</b>—as
	a worshipper (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:19">Hebrews 7:19</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>must believe</b>—<i>once
	for all: Greek</i> aorist tense. 
	</p>
<p><b>that God is</b>—is the true
	self-existing Jehovah (as contrasted with all so-called gods, not
	gods, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8">Galatians 4:8</span>), the source of all
	being, though he sees Him not (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8- :">Galatians 4:8- :</span>) as being "invisible" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:8- :">Galatians 4:8- :</span>). So Enoch; this passage implies that he had not been
	favored with <i>visible</i> appearances of God, yet he <i>believed</i>
	in God's <i>being,</i> and in God's <i>moral government,</i> as the
	Rewarder of His diligent worshippers, in opposition to antediluvian
	skepticism. Also Moses was not so favored before he left Egypt the
	first time (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:27">Hebrews 11:27</span>); still
	he believed. 
	</p>
<p><b>and . . . is</b>—a
	different <i>Greek</i> verb from the former "is."
	Translate, "is eventually"; <i>proves to be;</i> literally,
	"becomes." 
	</p>
<p><b>rewarder</b>—renderer of
	reward [ALFORD]. So God
	proved to be to Enoch. The reward is <i>God Himself</i> diligently
	"sought" and "walked with" in partial communion
	here, and to be fully enjoyed hereafter. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:27- :">Hebrews 11:27- :</span>, "I am thy exceeding great reward." 
	</p>
<p><b>of them</b>—and them only. 
	</p>
<p><b>diligently seek</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"seek out" God. Compare "seek <i>early,</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:27- :">Hebrews 11:27- :</span>. Not only "ask" and "seek," but "knock,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:12">Hebrews 11:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:24">Luke 13:24</span>, "Strive" as
	in an agony of contest.</p>
