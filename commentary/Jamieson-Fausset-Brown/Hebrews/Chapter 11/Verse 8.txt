<p><b>8.</b> From the antediluvian saints
	he passes to the patriarchs of Israel, to whom "the promises"

<p><b>called</b>—by God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The oldest manuscripts and <i>Vulgate</i> read, "He
	that was called Abraham," his name being changed from Abram to
	Abraham, on the occasion of God's making with him and his seed a
	covenant sealed by circumcision, many years after his call out of Ur.
	"By faith, he who was (afterwards) called Abraham (<i>father of
	nations,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:5">Genesis 17:5</span>, in order
	to become which was the design of God's bringing him out of Ur)
	obeyed (the command of God: to be understood in this reading), <i>so
	as to go out,</i>" c. 
	</p>
<p><b>which he should after
	receive</b>—He had not fully received even this promise when he
	went out, for it was not <i>explicitly</i> given him till he had
	reached Canaan (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:1">Genesis 12:1</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:6">Genesis 12:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:7">Genesis 12:7</span>). When the promise of the
	land was given him the Canaanite was still in the land, and himself a
	stranger; it is in the new heaven and new earth that he shall receive
	his personal inheritance promised him; so believers sojourn on earth
	as strangers, while the ungodly and Satan lord it over the earth; but
	at Christ's coming that same earth which was the scene of the
	believer's conflict shall be the inheritance of Christ and His
	saints.</p>
