<p><b>1. we also</b>—as well as those
	recounted in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:11">Hebrews 12:11</span>.

<p><b>are compassed about</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"have so great a cloud (a numberless multitude <i>above</i> us,
	like a cloud, 'holy and pellucid,' [CLEMENT
	OF ALEXANDRIA]) of
	witnesses surrounding us." The image is from a "race,"
	an image common even in Palestine from the time of the
	Greco-Macedonian empire, which introduced such <i>Greek</i> usages as
	national games. The "witnesses" answer to the spectators
	pressing round to see the competitors in their contest for the prize
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:14">Philippians 3:14</span>). Those "witnessed
	of" (<i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:5">Hebrews 11:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:39">Hebrews 11:39</span>) become in their turn
	"witnesses" in a twofold way: (1) attesting by their own
	case the faithfulness of God to His people [ALFORD]
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:12">Hebrews 6:12</span>), some of them
	<i>martyrs</i> in the modern sense; (2) witnessing our struggle of
	faith; however, this second sense of "witnesses," though
	agreeing with the <i>image</i> here if it is to be pressed, is not
	<i>positively,</i> unequivocally, and <i>directly</i> sustained by
	Scripture. It gives vividness to the image; as the crowd of
	spectators gave additional spirit to the combatants, so the <i>cloud
	of witnesses</i> who have themselves been in the same contest, ought
	to increase our earnestness, testifying, as they do, to God's
	faithfulness.

<p><b>weight</b>—As corporeal
	unwieldiness was, through a disciplinary diet, laid aside by
	candidates for the prize in racing; so carnal and worldly lusts, and
	all, whether from without or within, that would impede the heavenly
	runner, are the spiritual <i>weight</i> to be laid aside.
	"Encumbrance," <i>all superfluous weight;</i> the lust of
	the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, and even
	harmless and otherwise useful things which would positively retard us
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:50">Mark 10:50</span>, the blind man
	<i>casting away his garment</i> to come to Jesus; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:50- :">Mark 10:50- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:22">Ephesians 4:22</span>;

<p><b>the sin which doth so easily
	beset us</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "sin which easily stands around
	us"; so LUTHER,
	"which always so clings to us": "sinful propensity
	always surrounding us, ever present and ready" [WAHL].
	It is not primarily "<i>the sin,</i>" c., but <i>sin</i> in
	general, with, however, special reference to "apostasy,"
	against which he had already warned them, as one to which they might
	<i>gradually</i> be seduced the besetting sin of the Hebrews,
	UNBELIEF.

<p><b>with patience</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in persevering endurance" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:10- :">Colossians 3:10- :</span>). On "run" compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span>;
