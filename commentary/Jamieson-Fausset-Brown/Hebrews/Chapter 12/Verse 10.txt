<p><b>10.</b> Showing wherein the
	chastisement of our heavenly Father is preferable to that of earthly
	fathers. 
	</p>
<p><b>for a few days</b>—that is,
	<i>with a view to</i> our well-being in <i>the few days</i> of our
	earthly life: so the <i>Greek.</i>
</p>
<p><b>after their own
	pleasure</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "according to what seemed fit to
	themselves." Their rule of chastening is what may seem fit to
	their own often erring judgment, temper, or caprice. The two defects
	of human education are: (1) the prevalence in it of a view to the
	interests of our <i>short</i> earthly term of <i>days;</i> (2) the
	absence in parents of the unerring wisdom of our heavenly Father.
	"They err much at one time in severity, at another in indulgence
	[<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+3:13">1 Samuel 3:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:4">Ephesians 6:4</span>],
	and do not so much chasten as THINK
	they chasten" [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>that we might be partakers of
	his holiness</b>—becoming holy as He is holy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:4- :">Ephesians 6:4- :</span>). To become <i>holy</i> like God is tantamount to being
	educated for passing <i>eternity</i> with God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>). So this "partaking
	of God's holiness" stands in contrast to the "few days"
	of this life, with a view to which earthly fathers generally educate
	their sons.</p>
