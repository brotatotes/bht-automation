<p><b>11. joyous . . . grievous</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"matter of joy . . . matter of grief." The objection that
	chastening is grievous is here anticipated and answered. It only
	seems so to those being chastened, whose judgments are confused by
	the present pain. Its ultimate <i>fruit</i> amply compensates for any
	temporary pam. The real object of the fathers in chastening is not
	that they find pleasure in the children's pain. Gratified wishes, our
	Father knows, would often be our real curses.

<p><b>fruit of
	righteousness</b>—<i>righteousness</i> (in practice, springing from
	faith) is the <i>fruit</i> which chastening, the tree yields (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "Peaceable" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): in contrast to the ordeal of conflict by which it has
	been won. "Fruit of righteousness to be enjoyed in peace after
	the conflict" [THOLUCK].
	As the olive garland, the emblem of <i>peace</i> as well as <i>victory,</i>
	was put on the victor's brow in the games. 
	</p>
<p><b>exercised thereby</b>—as
	athletes exercised in training for a contest. <i>Chastisement</i> is
	the <i>exercise</i> to give experience, and make the spiritual
	combatant irresistibly victorious (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "Oh, happy the servant for whose improvement his Lord
	is earnest, with whom he deigns to be angry, whom He does not deceive
	by dissembling admonition" (withholding admonition, and so
	leading the man to think he needs it not)! [TERTULLIAN,
	<i>Patience,</i> 11]. Observe the "afterwards"; <i>that</i>
	is the time often when God works.</p>
