	lift up—In  :-, from which Paul here quotes, it is, "Strengthen

	Hebrews 12:13; the second, to others,
Hebrews 12:14, "peace with
	all men"; the third, to God, "holiness, without
	which," c. The first is referred to in Hebrews 12:14- :, "test any man fail of the grace of God" the
	second in the words, "lest any root of bitterness," c. the
	third in Hebrews 12:16, "Lest
	there be any fornicator or profane person," c. This threefold
	relation often occurs in Paul's Epistles. Compare Note,
	see on Hebrews 12:16- :, "soberly,
	righteously, and godly." The Greek active verb, not the
	middle or reflexive, requires the sense to be, Lift up not only your
	own hands and knees, but also those of your brethren
	(compare Hebrews 12:15 Isaiah 35:4).
