<p><b>lift up</b>—In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, from which Paul here quotes, it is, "<i>Strengthen</i>

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:13">Hebrews 12:13</span>; the second, to <i>others,</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:14">Hebrews 12:14</span>, "peace with

	there be any fornicator or profane person," c. This threefold
	relation often occurs in <i>Paul's</i> Epistles. Compare <i>Note,</i>

	middle or reflexive, requires the sense to be, Lift up not only <i>your
	own</i> hands and knees, but also those <i>of your brethren</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:15">Hebrews 12:15</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:4">Isaiah 35:4</span>).</p>
