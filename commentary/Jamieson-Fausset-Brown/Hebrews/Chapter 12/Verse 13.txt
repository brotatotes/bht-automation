<p><b>13.</b> Quoted from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, <i>Septuagint,</i> "Make straight paths for thy feet."
	</p>
<p><b>straight</b>—that is,
	leading by a straight road to joy and grace (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:1">Hebrews 12:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:15">Hebrews 12:15</span>).
	Cease to "halt" between Judaism and Christianity [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>paths</b>—literally, "wheel
	tracks." Let your walk be so firm and so unanimous in the right
	direction that a plain track and "highway" may be thereby
	established for those who accompany and follow you, to perceive and
	walk in (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:8">Isaiah 35:8</span>) [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>that which is lame</b>—those
	"weak in the faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:8- :">Isaiah 35:8- :</span>), having still Judaizing prejudices. 
	</p>
<p><b>be turned out of the way</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+4:27">Proverbs 4:27</span>); and, so missing the
	way, lose the prize of "the race" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+4:27- :">Proverbs 4:27- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>rather he healed</b>—Proper
	exercise of itself contributes to health; the habit of walking
	straight onward in the right way tends to <i>healing.</i></p>
