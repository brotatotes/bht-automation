<p><b>14. follow peace with all men</b>—with
	the brethren especially (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), that so the "lame" among them be not "turned
	out of the way" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:13">Hebrews 12:13</span>),
	and that no one of them "fail of the grace of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:13- :">Hebrews 12:13- :</span>).

<p><b>holiness</b>—a distinct
	<i>Greek</i> word from God's "holiness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:13- :">Hebrews 12:13- :</span>). Translate here "sanctification." His is
	absolute <i>holiness:</i> our part is to put on His holiness,
	becoming "holy as He is holy," by <i>sanctification.</i>
	While "following peace with all men," we are not so to seek
	to please them, as to make God's will and our sanctification a
	secondary object; this latter must be our first aim. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:13- :">Hebrews 12:13- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>without which</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"apart from which." 
	</p>
<p><b>no man shall see the Lord</b>—no
	man <i>as a son;</i> in heavenly glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:3">Revelation 22:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:4">Revelation 22:4</span>). In the East, none but
	the greatest favorites are admitted to the honor of seeing the king
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+14:24">2 Samuel 14:24</span>). The Lord
	being pure and holy, none but the pure and holy shall see Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+14:24- :">2 Samuel 14:24- :</span>). Without holiness in them, they could not enjoy Him who is
	holiness itself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:20">Zechariah 14:20</span>).
	The connection of <i>purity</i> with <i>seeing the Lord,</i> appears
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:3">1 John 3:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>. Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5- :">Ephesians 5:5- :</span> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:3">1 Thessalonians 4:3</span>). In
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span>,
	it is said that all shall see the Lord; but, that shall be as a
	<i>Judge,</i> not as their lasting portion and God, which is meant
	here. The <i>Greek</i> verb does not denote the mere action of
	seeing, but the seer's state of mind to which the object is
	presented: so in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:8">Matthew 5:8</span> they
	shall <i>truly comprehend</i> God [TITTMANN].
	None but the holy could <i>appreciate</i> the holy God, none else
	therefore shall abide in His presence. "The bad shall only see
	Him in His form <i>as Son of man</i> [compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:13">Revelation 1:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:7">Revelation 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>;

	still it will be in the glory in which He shall judge, not in the
	lowliness in which He was judged. <i>His form as God,</i> wherein He
	is equal to the Father, without doubt the ungodly shall not see; for
	it is only 'the pure in heart who shall see God'" [AUGUSTINE].
	"He shall come to judge, who stood before a judge. He shall come
	in the form in which He was judged, that they may see Him whom they
	pierced: He who was before hidden shall come manifested in power: He,
	as Judge, shall condemn the real culprits, who was Himself falsely
	made a culprit."</p>
