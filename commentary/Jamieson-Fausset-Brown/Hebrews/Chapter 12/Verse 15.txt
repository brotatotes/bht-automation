<p><b>15. lest any . . . fall</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"lest any (namely, through sloth in running) <i>failing,</i>"
	or "<i>falling short of</i> the grace of God . . . <i>trouble
	you.</i>" The image is taken from a company of travellers, one
	of whom lags behind, and so never reaches the end of the long and
	laborious journey [CHRYSOSTOM].

<p><b>root of bitterness</b>—not
	merely a "<i>bitter</i> root," which might possibly bring
	forth sweet fruits; this, a root whose <i>essence</i> is
	"<i>bitterness,</i>" never could. Paul here refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Lest there should be among you a root that beareth
	gall and wormwood" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>Root of bitterness</i> comprehends every <i>person</i>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:16">Hebrews 12:16</span>) and every
	<i>principle</i> of doctrine or practice so radically corrupt as to
	spread corruption all around. The only safety is in rooting out such
	a root of bitterness. 
	</p>
<p><b>many</b>—rather, "<i>the</i>
	many," that is, the whole congregation. So long as it is hidden
	under the earth it cannot be remedied, but when it "springs up,"
	it must be dealt with boldly. Still remember the caution (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:16- :">Hebrews 12:16- :</span>) as to rooting out <i>persons.</i> No such danger can
	arise in rooting out bad <i>principles.</i></p>
