15. lest any . . . fall—Greek,
	"lest any (namely, through sloth in running) failing,"
	or "falling short of the grace of God . . . trouble
	you." The image is taken from a company of travellers, one
	of whom lags behind, and so never reaches the end of the long and
	laborious journey [CHRYSOSTOM].
	root of bitterness—not
	merely a "bitter root," which might possibly bring
	forth sweet fruits; this, a root whose essence is
	"bitterness," never could. Paul here refers to  :-, "Lest there should be among you a root that beareth
	gall and wormwood" (compare  :-). Root of bitterness comprehends every person
	(compare Hebrews 12:16) and every
	principle of doctrine or practice so radically corrupt as to
	spread corruption all around. The only safety is in rooting out such
	a root of bitterness. 
	many—rather, "the
	many," that is, the whole congregation. So long as it is hidden
	under the earth it cannot be remedied, but when it "springs up,"
	it must be dealt with boldly. Still remember the caution (Hebrews 12:16- :) as to rooting out persons. No such danger can
	arise in rooting out bad principles.
