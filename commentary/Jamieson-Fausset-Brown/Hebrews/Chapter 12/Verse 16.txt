<p><b>16. fornicator</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:4">Hebrews 13:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:8">1 Corinthians 10:8</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>or profane</b>—<i>Fornication</i>
	is nearly akin to gluttony, Esau's sin. He <i>profanely</i> cast away
	his spiritual privilege for the gratification of his palate. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:8- :">1 Corinthians 10:8- :</span> graphically portrays him. An example well fitted to strike
	needful horror into the Hebrews, whosoever of them, like Esau, were
	only sons of Isaac according to the flesh [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>for one morsel</b>—The
	smallness of the inducement only aggravates the guilt of casting away
	eternity for such a trifle, so far is it from being a claim for mercy
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:6">Genesis 3:6</span>). <i>One</i>
	single act has often the greatest power either for good or for evil.
	So in the cases of Reuben and Saul, for evil (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+49:4">Genesis 49:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+5:1">1 Chronicles 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+13:12-14">1 Samuel 13:12-14</span>);
	and, on the other hand, for good, Abraham and Phinehas (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:1-3">Genesis 12:1-3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:5">Genesis 15:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+25:6-15">Numbers 25:6-15</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>his birthright</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"his own (so the oldest manuscripts read, intensifying the
	suicidal folly and sin of the act) rights of primogeniture,"
	involving the high spiritual privilege of being ancestor of the
	promised seed, and heir of the promises in Him. The Hebrews whom Paul
	addressed, had, as Christians, the spiritual rights of primogeniture
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:23">Hebrews 12:23</span>): he
	intimates that they must exercise holy self-control, if they wish
	not, like Esau, to forfeit them.</p>
