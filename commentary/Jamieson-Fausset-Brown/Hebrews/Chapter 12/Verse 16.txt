16. fornicator— (Hebrews 13:4;
	1 Corinthians 10:8). 
	or profane—Fornication
	is nearly akin to gluttony, Esau's sin. He profanely cast away
	his spiritual privilege for the gratification of his palate. 1 Corinthians 10:8- : graphically portrays him. An example well fitted to strike
	needful horror into the Hebrews, whosoever of them, like Esau, were
	only sons of Isaac according to the flesh [BENGEL].
	for one morsel—The
	smallness of the inducement only aggravates the guilt of casting away
	eternity for such a trifle, so far is it from being a claim for mercy
	(compare Genesis 3:6). One
	single act has often the greatest power either for good or for evil.
	So in the cases of Reuben and Saul, for evil (Genesis 49:4;
	1 Chronicles 5:1; 1 Samuel 13:12-14);
	and, on the other hand, for good, Abraham and Phinehas (Genesis 12:1-3;
	Genesis 15:5; Genesis 15:6;
	Numbers 25:6-15). 
	his birthright—Greek,
	"his own (so the oldest manuscripts read, intensifying the
	suicidal folly and sin of the act) rights of primogeniture,"
	involving the high spiritual privilege of being ancestor of the
	promised seed, and heir of the promises in Him. The Hebrews whom Paul
	addressed, had, as Christians, the spiritual rights of primogeniture
	(compare Hebrews 12:23): he
	intimates that they must exercise holy self-control, if they wish
	not, like Esau, to forfeit them.
