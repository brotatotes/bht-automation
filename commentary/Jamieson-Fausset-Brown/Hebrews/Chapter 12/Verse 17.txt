<p><b>17. afterwards</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>even</i> afterward." He despised his birthright,
	accordingly <i>also</i> he was despised and rejected when he wished
	to have the blessing. As in the believer's case, so in the
	unbeliever's, there is an "afterwards" coming, when the
	believer shall look on his past griefs, and the unbeliever on his
	past joys, in a very different light from that in which they were
	respectively viewed at the time. Compare "Nevertheless
	afterward," c. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:11">Hebrews 12:11</span>,
	with the "afterward" here. 
	</p>
<p><b>when he would</b>—when he
	<i>wished</i> to have. "He that will not when he may, when he
	will, shall have nay" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+1:24-30">Proverbs 1:24-30</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:34">Luke 13:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+13:35">Luke 13:35</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:42">Luke 19:42</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>he was rejected</b>—not as
	to every blessing, but only that which would have followed the
	primogeniture. 
	</p>
<p><b>he found no place of
	repentance</b>—The <i>cause</i> is here put for the <i>effect,</i>
	"repentance" for the object which Esau aimed at in his
	so-called <i>repentance,</i> namely, <i>the change of his father's
	determination</i> to give the chief blessing to Jacob. Had he <i>sought</i>
	real <i>repentance with tears</i> he would have <i>found</i> it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:42- :">Luke 19:42- :</span>). But he did not find it because this was not what he sought.
	What proves his <i>tears</i> were not those of one seeking true
	repentance is, immediately after he was foiled in his desire, he
	resolved to murder Jacob! He shed tears, not for his sin, but for his
	suffering the penalty of his sin. His were tears of vain regret and
	remorse, not of repentance. "Before, he might have had the
	blessing without tears; afterwards, no matter how many tears he shed,
	he was rejected. Let us use the time" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:42- :">Luke 19:42- :</span>)! [BENGEL].
	ALFORD explains
	"repentance" here, <i>a chance, by repenting, to repair</i>
	(that is, to regain the lost blessing). I agree with him that the
	translation, instead of "repentance," "no place for
	<i>changing</i> HIS FATHER'S
	<i>mind,</i>" is forced; though doubtless this is what was the
	true aim of the "repentance" which he sought. The language
	is framed to apply to <i>profane</i> despisers who wilfully cast away
	grace and <i>seek repentance</i> (that is, not real; but <i>escape
	from the penalty</i> of their sin), but in vain. Compare "afterward,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:11">Matthew 25:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:12">Matthew 25:12</span>.
	Tears are no proof of real repentance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+24:16">1 Samuel 24:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+24:17">1 Samuel 24:17</span>; contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+24:17- :">1 Samuel 24:17- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>it</b>—<i>the blessing,</i>
	which was the real object of Esau, though ostensibly seeking
	"repentance."</p>
