<p><b>18. For</b>—The fact that we are
	not under the law, but under a higher, and that the last
	dispensation, the Gospel, with its glorious privileges, is the reason
	why especially the Hebrew Christians should "look diligently,"
	c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:15">Hebrews 12:15</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:16">Hebrews 12:16</span>).

<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:13">Exodus 19:13</span>). The Hebrews drew near
	to the material Mount Sinai with material bodies; we, to the
	spiritual mount in the spirit. The "darkness" was that
	formed by the clouds hanging round the mount; the "tempest"
	accompanied the thunder.</p>
