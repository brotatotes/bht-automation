<p><b>2. Looking unto</b>—literally,
	"Looking from afar" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); fixing the eyes upon Jesus seated on the throne of God. 
	</p>
<p><b>author</b>—"Prince-leader."
	The same <i>Greek</i> is translated, "Captain (of salvation),"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>; "Prince (of
	life)," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15">Acts 3:15</span>. Going
	before us as the Originator of our faith, and the Leader whose
	matchless example we are to follow always. In this He is
	distinguished from all those examples of faith in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:15- :">Acts 3:15- :</span>. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:1">1 Corinthians 11:1</span>).
	On His "faith" compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:13">Hebrews 2:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>. Believers have ever
	looked to Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:26">Hebrews 11:26</span>;

	"Perfecter," referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:8- :">Hebrews 13:8- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>of our faith</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "of <i>the</i> faith," including both His
	faith (as exhibited in what follows) and our faith. He fulfilled the
	ideal of faith Himself, and so, both as a vicarious offering and an
	example, He is the object of our faith. 
	</p>
<p><b>for the joy . . . set before
	him</b>—namely, of presently after <i>sitting down at the right
	hand of the throne of God;</i> including besides His own personal
	joy, the joy of sitting there as a Prince and Saviour, to give
	repentance and remission of sins. The coming joy disarmed of its
	sting the present pain. 
	</p>
<p><b>cross . . . shame</b>—the
	great stumbling-block to the Hebrews. "Despised," that is,
	disregarded.</p>
