<p><b>20. that which was commanded</b>—"the
	interdict" [TITTMANN].
	A <i>stern interdictory mandate</i> is meant. 
	</p>
<p><b>And</b>—rather, "Even
	if a beast (much more a man) touch," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>or thrust through with a
	dart</b>—omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The <i>full</i>

	is abbreviated here; the beast alone, being put for "whether man
	or beast"; the <i>stoning,</i> which applies to the <i>human</i>
	offender, alone being specified, the beast's punishment, namely, the
	being <i>thrust through with a dart,</i> being left to be understood.</p>
