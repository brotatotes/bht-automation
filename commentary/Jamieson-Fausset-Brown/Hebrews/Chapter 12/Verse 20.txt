20. that which was commanded—"the
	interdict" [TITTMANN].
	A stern interdictory mandate is meant. 
	And—rather, "Even
	if a beast (much more a man) touch," c. 
	or thrust through with a
	dart—omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The full
	interdict in Exodus 19:12 Exodus 19:13
	is abbreviated here; the beast alone, being put for "whether man
	or beast"; the stoning, which applies to the human
	offender, alone being specified, the beast's punishment, namely, the
	being thrust through with a dart, being left to be understood.
