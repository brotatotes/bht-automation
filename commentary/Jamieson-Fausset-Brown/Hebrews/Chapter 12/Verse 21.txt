	quake—Greek, "I
	am in trembling"; "fear" affected his mind:
	"trembling," his body. Moses is not recorded in Exodus to
	have used these words. But Paul, by inspiration, supplies (compare
	Acts 20:35; 2 Timothy 3:8)
	this detail. We read in Deuteronomy 9:19,
	Septuagint, of similar words used by Moses after breaking the
	two tables, through fear of God's anger at the people's sin in making
	the golden calves. He doubtless similarly "feared" in
	hearing the ten commandments spoken by the voice of Jehovah.
