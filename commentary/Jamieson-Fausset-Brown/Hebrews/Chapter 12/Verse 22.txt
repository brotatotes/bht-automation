<p><b>22, 23. to an innumerable company of
	angels, to the general assembly and church</b>â€”The <i>city</i> of
	God having been mentioned, the mention of its citizens follows.
	Believers being like the angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+1:6">Job 1:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+38:7">Job 38:7</span>), "sons of God,"
	are so their "equals" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+38:7- :">Job 38:7- :</span>); and being reconciled through Christ, are adopted into
	God's great and blessed family. For the full completion of this we
	pray (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:10">Matthew 6:10</span>). <i>English
	Version</i> arrangement is opposed: (1) by "and" always
	beginning each new member of the whole sentence; (2) "general
	assembly and Church," form a kind of tautology; (3) "general
	assembly," or rather, "<i>festal</i> full assembly,"
	"the jubilant full company" (such as were the Olympic
	games, celebrated with joyous singing, dancing, c.), applies better
	to the <i>angels</i> above, ever hymning God's praises, than to the
	Church, of which a considerable part is now militant on earth.
	Translate therefore, "to myriads (ten thousands, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+33:2">Deuteronomy 33:2</span>

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:14">Judges 1:14</span>; namely), the full festal
	assembly of angels, and the Church of the first-born." Angels
	and saints together constitute the <i>ten thousands.</i> Compare "<i>all</i>
	angels, <i>all nations</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:31">Matthew 25:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:32">Matthew 25:32</span>. Messiah is
	pre-eminently "the First-born," or "First-begotten"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:6">Hebrews 1:6</span>), and all believers
	become so by adoption. Compare the type, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+3:12">Numbers 3:12</span>;

	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+13:2">Exodus 13:2</span>), and a "kingdom
