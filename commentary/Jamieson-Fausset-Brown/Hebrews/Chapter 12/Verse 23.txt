<p><b>23. written in heaven</b>—enrolled
	as citizens there. <i>All</i> those who at the coming of "God
	the Judge of all" (which clause therefore naturally follows),
	shall be found "written in heaven," that is, <i>in the
	Lamb's book of life</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Though still fighting the good fight on earth, still, in
	respect to your destiny, and present life of <i>faith</i> which
	substantiates things hoped for, ye <i>are</i> already members of the
	heavenly citizenship. "We are one citizenship with angels; to
	which it is said in the psalm, <i>Glorious things are spoken of thee,
	thou city of God</i>" [AUGUSTINE].
	I think ALFORD wrong in
	<i>restricting</i> "the Church of the first-born written in
	heaven," to those militant on earth; it is rather, <i>all</i>
	those who <i>at the Judge's coming</i> shall be found written in
	heaven (the true patent of heavenly nobility; contrast "written
	in the earth," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:13">Jeremiah 17:13</span>,
	and Esau's profane sale of his birthright, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:13- :">Jeremiah 17:13- :</span>); these all, from the beginning to the end of the world,
	forming <i>one</i> Church to which every believer is already come.
	The <i>first-born</i> of Israel were "written" in a roll
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+3:40">Numbers 3:40</span>).

<p><b>the spirits of just men made
	perfect</b>—at the resurrection, when the "JUDGE"
	shall appear, and believers' bliss shall be consummated by the union
	of the glorified <i>body</i> with the <i>spirit;</i> the great hope
	of the New Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:20-23">Romans 8:20-23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>). The place of this
	clause <i>after</i> "the JUDGE
	OF ALL," is my objection to BENGEL
	and ALFORD'S explanation,
	the souls of the just <i>in their separate state perfected.</i>
	Compare <i>Notes,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:16- :">1 Thessalonians 4:16- :</span>, to which he refers here, and which I think confirms my
	view; those heretofore <i>spirits,</i> but now to be perfected by
	being clothed upon with the body. Still the phrase, "<i>spirits</i>
	of just men made perfect," not merely "just men made
	perfect," may favor the reference to the happy spirits in their
	separate state. The <i>Greek</i> is not "the <i>perfected
	spirits,</i>" but "the spirits of <i>the perfected just.</i>"
	In no other passage are <i>the just</i> said to be <i>perfected</i>
	before the resurrection, and the completion of the full number of the
	elect (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11">Revelation 6:11</span>); I think,
	therefore, "spirits of the just," may here be used to
	express <i>the just whose predominant element in their perfected
	state shall be spirit.</i> So <i>spirit</i> and <i>spirits</i> are
	used of <i>a man</i> or <i>men in the body, under the influence of
	the spirit,</i> the opposite of <i>flesh</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11- :">Revelation 6:11- :</span>). The resurrection bodies of the saints shall be <i>bodies</i>
	in which the <i>spirit</i> shall altogether preponderate over the
	<i>animal soul</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11- :">Revelation 6:11- :</span>).</p>
