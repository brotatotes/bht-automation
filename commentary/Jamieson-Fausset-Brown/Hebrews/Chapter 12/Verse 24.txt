<p><b>24. new</b>—not the usual term
	(<i>kaine</i>) applied to the Christian covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), which would mean <i>new</i> as <i>different from,</i> and
	superseding the <i>old;</i> but <i>Greek,</i> "<i>nea,</i>"
	"recent," "lately established," having the
	"freshness of youth," as opposed to age. The mention of
	Jesus, <i>the Perfecter</i> of our faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and Himself perfected through sufferings and death, in His
	resurrection and ascension (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span>), is naturally suggested
	by the mention of "the just <i>made perfect</i>" at their
	resurrection (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:22">Hebrews 7:22</span>).
	Paul uses "Jesus," dwelling here on Him as the Person
	realized as our loving friend, not merely in His <i>official</i>
	character as the <i>Christ.</i>
</p>
<p><b>and to the blood of
	sprinkling</b>—here enumerated as distinct from "Jesus."
	BENGEL reasonably argues
	as follows: His blood was entirely "poured out" of His body
	by the various ways in which it was shed, His bloody sweat, the crown
	of thorns, the scourging, the nails, and after death the spear, just
	as the blood was entirely poured out and extravasated from the animal
	sacrifices of the law. It was <i>incorruptible</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:18">1 Peter 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span>). No Scripture states it
	was again put into the Lord's body. At His ascension, as our great
	High Priest, He entered the heavenly holiest place "BY
	His own blood" (not <i>after</i> shedding His blood, nor <i>with</i>
	the blood in His body, but), carrying it separately from his body
	(compare the type, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:7">Hebrews 9:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:25">Hebrews 9:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:11">Hebrews 13:11</span>). Paul does not say, by
	the efficacy of His blood, but, "by <i>His own proper</i> blood"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>); not MATERIAL
	blood, but "the blood of Him who, through the eternal Spirit,
	offered Himself without spot unto God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12- :">Hebrews 9:12- :</span>). So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>,
	<i>the Son of God</i> and <i>the blood of the covenant wherewith he</i>
	(the professor) <i>was sanctified,</i> are mentioned separately. Also
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:12">Hebrews 13:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:20">Hebrews 13:20</span>;
	also compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19">Hebrews 10:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:21">Hebrews 10:21</span>.
	So in the Lord's Supper (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:16">1 Corinthians 10:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:24-26">1 Corinthians 11:24-26</span>), <i>the body</i>
	and <i>blood</i> are separately represented. The blood itself,
	therefore, continues still in heaven before God, the perpetual ransom
	price of "the eternal covenant" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:24-46.11.26- :">1 Corinthians 11:24-46.11.26- :</span>). Once for all Christ sprinkled the blood peculiarly for us
	at His ascension (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:12">Hebrews 9:12</span>).
	But it is called "the blood of sprinkling," on account also
	of its continued use in heaven, and in the consciences of the saints
	on earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:22">Hebrews 10:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:15">Isaiah 52:15</span>). This sprinkling is
	analogous to the sprinkled blood of the Passover. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:15- :">Isaiah 52:15- :</span>, "In the midst of the throne, a Lamb <i>as it had been
	slain.</i>" His glorified body does not require meat, nor the
	circulation of the blood. His blood introduced into heaven took away
	the dragon's right to accuse. Thus Rome's theory of <i>concomitancy</i>
	of the blood with the body, the excuse for giving only the bread to
	the laity, falls to the ground. The mention of "the blood of
	sprinkling" naturally follows the mention of the "covenant,"
	which could not be consecrated without <i>blood</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:18">Hebrews 9:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:22">Hebrews 9:22</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>speaketh better things than
	that of Abel</b>—namely, than the sprinkling (the best manuscripts
	read the article <i>masculine,</i> which refers to "sprinkling,"
	not to "blood," which last is neuter) of blood by Abel in
	his sacrifice spake. This comparison between two <i>things of the
	same kind</i> (namely, Christ's sacrifice, and Abel's sacrifice) is
	more natural, than between two things different in kind and in
	results (namely, Christ's sacrifice, and Abel's <i>own</i> blood
	[ALFORD], which was not a
	sacrifice at all); compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:4">Hebrews 11:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:4">Genesis 4:4</span>. This accords with the
	whole tenor of the Epistle, and of this passage in particular (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:4- :">Genesis 4:4- :</span>), which is to show the superiority of Christ's sacrifice
	and the new covenant, to the Old Testament sacrifices (of which
	Abel's is the first recorded; it, moreover, was testified to by God
	as acceptable to Him above Cain's), compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:4- :">Genesis 4:4- :</span>. The word "better" implies superiority to
	something that is good: but Abel's own blood was not at all good for
	the purpose for which Christ's blood was efficacious; nay, it cried
	for vengeance. So ARCHBISHOP
	MAGEE, HAMMOND,
	and KNATCHBULL. BENGEL
	takes "the blood of Abel" as put for <i>all</i> the blood
	shed on earth crying for vengeance, and greatly increasing the other
	cries raised by sin in the world; counteracted by the blood of Christ
	calmly speaking in heaven for us, and from heaven to us. I prefer
	MAGEE'S view. Be this as
	it may, to deny that Christ's atonement is truly a propitiation,
	overthrows Christ's priesthood, makes the sacrifices of Moses' law an
	unmeaning mummery, and represents Cain's sacrifice as good as that of
	Abel.</p>
