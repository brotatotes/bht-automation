<p><b>25. refuse not</b>—through
	unbelief. 
	</p>
<p><b>him that speaketh</b>—God
	in Christ. As the <i>blood of sprinkling</i> is represented as
	<i>speaking</i> to God for us, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; so here God is represented as speaking to us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:1">Hebrews 1:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>). His word now is the
	prelude of the last "shaking" of all things (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2- :">Hebrews 1:2- :</span>). The same word which is heard in the Gospel <i>from
	heaven,</i> will shake heaven and earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2- :">Hebrews 1:2- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>who refused him</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"refusing as they did." Their seemingly submissive entreaty
	that the word should not be spoken to them by God any more (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2- :">Hebrews 1:2- :</span>), covered over refractory hearts, as their subsequent deeds
	showed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:16">Hebrews 3:16</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>that spake</b>—<i>revealing
	with oracular warnings His divine will:</i> so the <i>Greek.</i>
</p>
<p><b>if we turn away</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"we who turn away." The word implies greater refractoriness
	than "refused," or "declined." 
	</p>
<p><b>him that speaketh from
	heaven</b>—God, by His Son in the Gospel, speaking from His
	heavenly throne. Hence, in Christ's preaching frequent mention is
	made of "the kingdom <i>of the heavens</i>" (<i>Greek,</i>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2">Matthew 3:2</span>). In the giving of the
	law God spake on earth (namely, Mount Sinai) by angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:2- :">Matthew 3:2- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2">Hebrews 1:2</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:2- :">Hebrews 1:2- :</span>, when God says, "I talked with you <i>from heaven,</i>"
	this passage in Hebrews shows that not the highest heavens, but the
	visible heavens, the clouds and darkness, are meant, out of which God
	by angels proclaimed the law on Sinai.</p>
