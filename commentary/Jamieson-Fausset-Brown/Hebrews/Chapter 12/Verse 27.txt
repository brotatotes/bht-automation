<p><b>27. this </b><i><b>word,</b></i><b>
	Yet once more</b>—So Paul, by the Spirit, sanctions the <i>Septuagint</i>
	rendering of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="hag+2:6">Haggai 2:6</span>, giving an
	additional feature to the prophecy in the <i>Hebrew,</i> as rendered
	in <i>English Version,</i> not merely that it shall be <i>in a little
	while,</i> but that it is to be "<i>once</i> more" as the
	final act. The stress of his argument is on the "ONCE."
	<i>Once for all; once and for ever.</i> "In saying 'once more,'
	the Spirit implies that something has already passed, and something
	else shall be which is to remain, and is no more to be changed to
	something else; for the <i>once</i> is exclusive, that is, <i>not
	many times</i>" [ESTIUS].

<p><b>those things that are
	shaken</b>—the heaven and the earth. As the shaking is to be <i>total,</i>
	so shall the removal be, making way for the better things that are
	unremovable. Compare the Jewish economy (the type of the whole
	present order of things) giving way to the new and abiding covenant:
	the forerunner of the everlasting state of bliss. 
	</p>
<p><b>as of things . . .
	made</b>—namely, of this present <i>visible creation:</i> compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span>,
	"made with hands . . . of this creation," that is, things
	so <i>made</i> at creation that they would not remain of themselves,
	but be removed. The new abiding heaven and earth are also <i>made</i>
	by God, but they are of a higher nature than the material creation,
	being made to partake of the divine nature of Him who is not <i>made:</i>
	so in this relation, as one with the uncreated God, they are regarded
	as not of the same class as the <i>things made.</i> The things <i>made</i>
	in the former sense do <i>not remain;</i> the things of the new
	heaven and earth, like the uncreated God, "shall REMAIN
	before God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:22">Isaiah 66:22</span>).
	The Spirit, the seed of the new and heavenly being, not only of the
	believer's soul, but also of the future body, is an <i>uncreated</i>
	and immortal principle.</p>
