<p><b>let us have grace</b>—"let
	us have thankfulness" [ALFORD
	after CHRYSOSTOM]. But (1)
	this translation is according to classical <i>Greek,</i> not Paul's
	phraseology for "to be thankful." (2) "To God"
	would have been in that case added. (3) "Whereby we may serve
	God," suits the <i>English Version</i> "grace" (that
	is Gospel grace, the work of the Spirit, producing faith exhibited in
	<i>serving God</i>), but does not suit "thankfulness."

	"well-pleasingly."

<p><b>reverence and godly fear</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "reverent caution and fear."
	<i>Reverent caution</i> (same <i>Greek</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>) lest we
	should offend God, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. <i>Fear</i>
	lest we should bring destruction on ourselves.</p>
