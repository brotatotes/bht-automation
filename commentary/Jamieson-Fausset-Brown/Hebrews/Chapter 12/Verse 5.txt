<p><b>speaketh unto you</b>—as in

<p><b>despise not</b>—literally,
	"Do not <i>hold of little account.</i>" Betraying a
	<i>contumacious spirit of unbelief</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), as "faint" implies a broken-down, weak, and
	<i>desponding spirit.</i> "Chastening" is to be borne with
	"subjection" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:9">Hebrews 12:9</span>);
	"rebuke" (more severe than <i>chastening</i>) is to be
	borne with <i>endurance</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:9- :">Hebrews 12:9- :</span>). "Some in adversity kick against God's will, others
	despond; neither is to be done by the Christian, who is peculiarly
	the child of God. To him such adverse things occur only by the decree
	of God, and that designed in kindness, namely, to remove the
	defilements adhering to the believer, and to exercise his patience"
