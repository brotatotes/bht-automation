	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:8">Hebrews 12:8</span> the need of "chastening"
	or "discipline" is inculcated; in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:8- :">Hebrews 12:8- :</span>, the duty of those to whom it is administered.

<p><b>If</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "With a view to chastening (that is, since
	God's chastisement is with a view to your chastening, that is,
	disciplinary amelioration) endure patiently"; so <i>Vulgate.</i>
	ALFORD translates it as
	indicative, not so well, "It is for chastisement that <i>ye are
	enduring.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>dealeth with you</b>—"beareth
	Himself toward you" in the very act of chastening.

<p><b>what son is he</b>—"What
	son is there" even in ordinary life? Much more God as to His
	sons (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+48:10">Isaiah 48:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22">Acts 14:22</span>).
	The most eminent of God's saints were the most afflicted. God leads
	them by a way they know not (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22- :">Acts 14:22- :</span>). We too much look at each trial by itself, instead of
	taking it in connection with the whole plan of our salvation, as if a
	traveller were to complain of the steepness and roughness of one turn
	in the path, without considering that it led him into green pastures,
	on the direct road to the city of habitation. The New Testament alone
	uses the <i>Greek</i> term for education (<i>paideia</i>), to express
	"discipline" or <i>correction,</i> as of a <i>child</i> by
	a wise father.</p>
