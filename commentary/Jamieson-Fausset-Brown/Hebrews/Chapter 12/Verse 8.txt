8. if ye be without—excluded
	from participation in chastisement, and wishing to be so. 
	all—all sons:
	all the worthies enumerated in the eleventh chapter: all the
	witnesses (Hebrews 12:1).

	been made."

	whom their fathers take no care whether they are educated or not;

	well-being of his legitimate son. "Since then not to be
	chastised is a mark of bastardy, we ought [not to refuse, but]
	rejoice in chastisement, as a mark of our genuine sonship"
	[CHRYSOSTOM].
