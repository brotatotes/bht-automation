	As "Father of spirits," He is both the Originator, and the
	Providential and Gracious Sustainer, at once of animal and spiritual
	life. Compare "and LIVE,"
	namely, spiritually; also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "that we might be partakers of His holiness"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4">2 Peter 1:4</span>). God is a spirit
	Himself, and the Creator of spirits like Himself, in contrast to men
	who are flesh, and the progenitors of flesh (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:4- :">2 Peter 1:4- :</span>). Jesus our pattern "learned obedience"
