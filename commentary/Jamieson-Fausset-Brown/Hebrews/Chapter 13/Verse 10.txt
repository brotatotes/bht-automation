<p><b>10.</b> Christianity and Judaism are
	so totally distinct, that "they who serve the (Jewish)
	tabernacle," have no right to eat our spiritual Gospel meat,
	namely, the Jewish priests, and those who follow their guidance in
	serving the ceremonial ordinance. He says, "serve <i>the
	tabernacle,</i>" not "serve IN
	the tabernacle." Contrast with this servile worship ours.

<p><b>an altar</b>â€”the cross of
	Christ, whereon His body was offered. The Lord's table represents
	this altar, the cross; as the bread and wine represent the sacrifice
	offered on it. Our meat, which we by faith spiritually eat, is the
	flesh of Christ, in contrast to the typical ceremonial meats. The two
	cannot be combined (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:2">Galatians 5:2</span>).
	That not a literal eating of the sacrifice of Christ is meant in the
	Lord's Supper, but a spiritual is meant, appears from comparing
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:9">Hebrews 13:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:10">Hebrews 13:10</span>,
	"with GRACE, NOT with
	MEATS."</p>
