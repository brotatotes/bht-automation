<p><b>12. Wherefore Jesus</b>—In order
	that the Antitype might fulfil the type. 
	</p>
<p><b>sanctify</b>—Though not
	brought into the temple "sanctuary" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) His blood has been brought into the heavenly sanctuary,
	and "sanctifies the people" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:11">Hebrews 2:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>), by cleansing them from
	sin, and consecrating them to God. 
	</p>
<p><b>his own</b>—not blood of
	animals. 
	</p>
<p><b>without the gate</b>—of
	Jerusalem; as if unworthy of the society of the covenant-people. The
	fiery ordeal of His <i>suffering</i> on the cross, answers to the
	<i>burning</i> of the victims; thereby His mere fleshly life was
	completely destroyed, as their bodies were; the second part of His
	offering was His carrying His blood into the heavenly holiest before
	God at His ascension, that it should be a perpetual atonement for the
	world's sin.</p>
