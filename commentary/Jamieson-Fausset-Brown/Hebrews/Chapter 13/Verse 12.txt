12. Wherefore Jesus—In order
	that the Antitype might fulfil the type. 
	sanctify—Though not
	brought into the temple "sanctuary" ( :-) His blood has been brought into the heavenly sanctuary,
	and "sanctifies the people" (Hebrews 2:11;
	Hebrews 2:17), by cleansing them from
	sin, and consecrating them to God. 
	his own—not blood of
	animals. 
	without the gate—of
	Jerusalem; as if unworthy of the society of the covenant-people. The
	fiery ordeal of His suffering on the cross, answers to the
	burning of the victims; thereby His mere fleshly life was
	completely destroyed, as their bodies were; the second part of His
	offering was His carrying His blood into the heavenly holiest before
	God at His ascension, that it should be a perpetual atonement for the
	world's sin.
