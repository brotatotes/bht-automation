<p><b>without the camp</b>—"outside
	the legal polity" [THEODORET]
	of Judaism (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:11">Hebrews 13:11</span>)
	"Faith considers Jerusalem itself as a <i>camp,</i> not a <i>city</i>"
	[BENGEL]. He contrasts
	with the Jews, who serve an earthly sanctuary, the Christians to whom
	the altar in heaven stands open, while it is closed against the Jews.
	As Jesus suffered without the gate, so spiritually must those who
	desire to belong to Him, withdraw from the earthly Jerusalem and its
	sanctuary, as from this world in general. There is a reference to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:11- :">Hebrews 13:11- :</span>, when the tabernacle was moved <i>without the camp,</i>
	which had become polluted by the people's idolatry of the golden
	calves; so that "every one who sought the Lord went out unto <i>the
	tabernacle of the congregation</i> (as Moses called the tabernacle
	outside the camp), which was without the camp"; a lively type of
	what the Hebrews should do, namely, come out of the carnal worship of
	the earthly Jerusalem to worship God in Christ in spirit, and of what
	we all ought to do, namely, come out from all carnalism, worldly
	formalism, and mere sensuous worship, and know Jesus in His spiritual
	power apart from worldliness, seeing that "we have no continuing
	city" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:14">Hebrews 13:14</span>).
