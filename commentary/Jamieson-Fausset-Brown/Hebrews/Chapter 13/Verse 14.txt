<p><b>14. here</b>—on earth. Those
	Hebrews who clung to the earthly sanctuary are representatives of all
	who cling to this earth. The earthly Jerusalem proved to be no
	"abiding city," having been destroyed shortly after this
	Epistle was written, and with it fell the Jewish civil and religious
	polity; a type of the whole of our present earthly order of things
	soon to perish.
