<p><b>giving thanks</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"confessing." BENGEL
	remarks that the <i>Hebrew,</i> "<i>todah,</i>" is
	beautifully emphatic. It literally means "acknowledgment"
	or "confession." In praising a creature, we may easily
	exceed the truth; but in praising God we have only to go on
	<i>confessing</i> what He really is to us. Hence it is impossible to
	exceed the truth, and here is <i>genuine</i> praise.</p>
