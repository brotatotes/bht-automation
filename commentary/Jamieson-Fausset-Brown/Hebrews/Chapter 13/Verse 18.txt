18. Pray for us—Paul usually
	requests the Church's intercessions for him in closing his Epistles,
	just as he begins with assuring them of his having them at heart in
	his prayers (but in this Epistle not till Hebrews 13:20;
	Hebrews 13:21), Hebrews 13:21- :. "Us," includes both himself and his companions;
	he passes to himself alone, Hebrews 13:21- :. 
	we trust we have a good
	conscience—in spite of your former jealousies, and the charges
	of my Jewish enemies at Jerusalem, which have been the occasion of my
	imprisonment at Rome. In refutation of the Jews' aspersions, he
	asserts in the same language as here his own conscientiousness
	before God and man, Acts 23:1-3;
	Acts 24:16; Acts 24:20;
	Acts 24:21 (wherein he virtually
	implies that his reply to Ananias was not sinful impatience; for,
	indeed, it was a prophecy which he was inspired at the moment to
	utter, and which was fulfilled soon after). 
	we trust—Greek,
	"we are persuaded," in the oldest manuscripts. Good
	conscience produces confidence, where the Holy Spirit rules the
	conscience (Romans 9:1). 
	honestly—"in a
	good way." The same Greek word as "good
	conscience." Literally, "rightly," "becomingly."
