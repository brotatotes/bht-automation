<p><b>20.</b> Concluding prayer.

<p><b>God of peace</b>—So Paul,

	The Judaizing of the Hebrews was calculated to sow seeds of discord
	among them, of disobedience to their pastors (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:16- :">2 Thessalonians 3:16- :</span>), and of alienation towards Paul. <i>The God of peace</i>
	by giving unity of true doctrine, will unite them in mutual love.

<p><b>brought again from the
	dead</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "brought up," c.: God brought the
	Shepherd the Shepherd shall bring the flock. Here only in the Epistle
	he mentions the resurrection. He would not conclude without
	mentioning 'the connecting link between the two truths mainly
	discussed; the <i>one perfect sacrifice</i> and the <i>continual
	priestly intercession</i>—the depth of His humiliation and the
	height of His glory—the "altar" of the cross and the
	ascension to the heavenly Holy of Holies.

<p><b>Lord Jesus</b>—the title
	marking His <i>person</i> and His <i>Lordship</i> over us. But <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:16- :">2 Thessalonians 3:16- :</span>, "through Jesus <i>Christ.</i>" His <i>office,</i>
	as the <i>Anointed</i> of the Spirit, making Him the medium of
	communicating the Spirit to us, the holy unction flowing down from
	the Head on the members (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:16- :">2 Thessalonians 3:16- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>great</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:16- :">2 Thessalonians 3:16- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>shepherd of the sheep</b>—A
	title familiar to his Hebrew readers, from their Old Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:16- :">2 Thessalonians 3:16- :</span>; <i>Septuagint</i>): primarily <i>Moses,</i> antitypically
	<i>Christ:</i> already compared together, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:16- :">2 Thessalonians 3:16- :</span>. The transition is natural from their earthly pastors (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:16- :">2 Thessalonians 3:16- :</span>), to the Chief Pastor, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:16- :">2 Thessalonians 3:16- :</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:23">Ezekiel 34:23</span>
	and Jesus' own words, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:2">John 10:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:11">John 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:14">John 10:14</span>.

<p><b>through the blood</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in," <i>in virtue of</i> the blood (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:14- :">John 10:14- :</span>); it was because of His bloody death for us, that the Father
	raised and crowned Him with glory. The "blood" was the seal
	of the everlasting covenant entered into between the Father and Son;
	<i>in virtue of the Son's blood,</i> first Christ was raised, then
	Christ's people shall be so (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:14- :">John 10:14- :</span>, seemingly referred to here; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:14- :">John 10:14- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>everlasting</b>—The
	<i>everlastingness</i> of the <i>covenant</i> necessitated the
	resurrection. This clause, "the blood of the everlasting
	covenant," is a summary retrospect of the Epistle (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:14- :">John 10:14- :</span>).</p>
