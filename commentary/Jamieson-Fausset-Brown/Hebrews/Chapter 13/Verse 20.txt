20. Concluding prayer. 
	God of peace—So Paul,
	Romans 15:33; Romans 16:20;
	2 Corinthians 13:11; Philippians 4:9;
	1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Thessalonians 3:16.
	The Judaizing of the Hebrews was calculated to sow seeds of discord
	among them, of disobedience to their pastors (2 Thessalonians 3:16- :), and of alienation towards Paul. The God of peace
	by giving unity of true doctrine, will unite them in mutual love. 
	brought again from the
	dead—Greek, "brought up," c.: God brought the
	Shepherd the Shepherd shall bring the flock. Here only in the Epistle
	he mentions the resurrection. He would not conclude without
	mentioning 'the connecting link between the two truths mainly
	discussed; the one perfect sacrifice and the continual
	priestly intercession—the depth of His humiliation and the
	height of His glory—the "altar" of the cross and the
	ascension to the heavenly Holy of Holies. 
	Lord Jesus—the title
	marking His person and His Lordship over us. But 2 Thessalonians 3:16- :, "through Jesus Christ." His office,
	as the Anointed of the Spirit, making Him the medium of
	communicating the Spirit to us, the holy unction flowing down from
	the Head on the members (compare 2 Thessalonians 3:16- :). 
	great— (2 Thessalonians 3:16- :). 
	shepherd of the sheep—A
	title familiar to his Hebrew readers, from their Old Testament (2 Thessalonians 3:16- :; Septuagint): primarily Moses, antitypically
	Christ: already compared together, 2 Thessalonians 3:16- :. The transition is natural from their earthly pastors (2 Thessalonians 3:16- :), to the Chief Pastor, as in 2 Thessalonians 3:16- :. Compare Ezekiel 34:23
	and Jesus' own words, John 10:2;
	John 10:11; John 10:14.
	through the blood—Greek,
	"in," in virtue of the blood (John 10:14- :); it was because of His bloody death for us, that the Father
	raised and crowned Him with glory. The "blood" was the seal
	of the everlasting covenant entered into between the Father and Son;
	in virtue of the Son's blood, first Christ was raised, then
	Christ's people shall be so (John 10:14- :, seemingly referred to here; John 10:14- :). 
	everlasting—The
	everlastingness of the covenant necessitated the
	resurrection. This clause, "the blood of the everlasting
	covenant," is a summary retrospect of the Epistle (compare John 10:14- :).
