<p><b>21. Make you perfect</b>—properly
	said of healing a rent; <i>join you together in perfect harmony</i>
	[BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>to do his will, working in
	you</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:36">Hebrews 10:36</span>); rather
	as <i>Greek,</i> "<i>doing</i> in you." Whatever good we
	<i>do,</i> God <i>does</i> in us. 
	</p>
<p><b>well-pleasing in his sight</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:10">Isaiah 53:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:10">Ephesians 5:10</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>through Jesus Christ</b>—"God
	<i>doing</i> (working) in you that . . . <i>through Jesus Christ</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:11">Philippians 1:11</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>to whom</b>—to Christ. He
	closes as he began (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:11- :">Philippians 1:11- :</span>), with giving glory to Christ.</p>
