23. our brother Timothy—So
	Paul, 1 Corinthians 4:17; 2 Corinthians 1:1;
	Colossians 1:1; 1 Thessalonians 3:2.
	is set at liberty—from
	prison. So Aristarchus was imprisoned with Paul. BIRKS
	translates, "dismissed," "sent away," namely, on
	a mission to Greece, as Paul promised (1 Thessalonians 3:2- :). However, some kind of previous detention is implied
	before his being let go to Philippi. Paul, though now at
	large, was still in Italy, whence he sends the salutations of
	Italian Christians (Hebrews 13:24),
	waiting for Timothy to join him, so as to start for Jerusalem: we
	know from 1 Timothy 1:3, he and
	Timothy were together at Ephesus after his departing from Italy
	eastward. He probably left Timothy there and went to Philippi as he
	had promised. Paul implies that if Timothy shall not come shortly,
	he will start on his journey to the Hebrews at once.
