<p><b>is set at liberty</b>—from
	prison. So Aristarchus was imprisoned with Paul. BIRKS
	translates, "dismissed," "sent away," namely, on
	a mission to Greece, as Paul promised (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+3:2- :">1 Thessalonians 3:2- :</span>). However, <i>some</i> kind of previous detention is implied
	before his being <i>let go</i> to Philippi. Paul, though now at
	large, was still <i>in Italy,</i> whence he sends the salutations of
	Italian Christians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:24">Hebrews 13:24</span>),
	waiting for Timothy to join him, so as to start for Jerusalem: we
	know from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>, he and
	Timothy were together at Ephesus after his departing from Italy
	eastward. He probably left Timothy there and went to Philippi as he
	had promised. Paul implies that if Timothy shall not <i>come shortly,</i>
	he will start on his journey to the Hebrews at once.</p>
