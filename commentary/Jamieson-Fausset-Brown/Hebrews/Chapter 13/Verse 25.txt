<p><b>25.</b> <i>Paul's</i> characteristic
	salutation in every one of his other thirteen Epistles, as he says
	himself, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:21">1 Corinthians 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+16:23">1 Corinthians 16:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+4:18">Colossians 4:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</span>.
	It is found in no Epistle written by any other apostle in Paul's
	lifetime. It is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:21">Revelation 22:21</span>,
	written subsequently, and in CLEMENT
	OF ROME. Being
	known to be his badge, it is not used by others in his lifetime. The
	<i>Greek</i> here is, "<i>The</i> grace (namely, of our Lord
	Jesus Christ) be with you all."</p>
