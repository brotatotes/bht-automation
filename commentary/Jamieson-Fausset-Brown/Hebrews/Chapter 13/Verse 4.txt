<p><b>4. </b><i><b>is</b></i><b>,</b>
	c.—Translate, "Let marriage <i>be treated as</i> honorable":
	as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:5">Hebrews 13:5</span> also is an
	exhortation.

<p><b>in all</b>—"in the
	case of all men": "among all." "To avoid
	fornication let EVERY MAN
	have his own wife" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+7:2">1 Corinthians 7:2</span>).
	Judaism and Gnosticism combined were soon about to throw discredit on
	marriage. The venerable Paphnutius, in the Council of Nice, quoted
	this verse for the justification of the married state. If one does
	not himself marry, he should not prevent others from doing so.
	Others, especially Romanists, translate, "in all <i>things,</i>"
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:18">Hebrews 13:18</span>. But the
	warning being against lasciviousness, the contrast to "<i>whoremongers</i>
	and <i>adulterers</i>" in the parallel clause, requires the "in
	all" in this clause to refer to <i>persons.</i>

<p><b>the bed undefiled</b>—Translate,
	as <i>Greek</i> requires "undefiled" to be a <i>predicate,</i>
	not an epithet, "And let the bed <i>be</i> undefiled." 
	</p>
<p><b>God will judge</b>—Most
	whoremongers escape the notice of human tribunals but God takes
	particular cognizance of those whom man does not punish. Gay
	immoralities will then be regarded in a very different light from
	what they are now.</p>
