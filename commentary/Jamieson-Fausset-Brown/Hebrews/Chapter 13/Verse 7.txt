	not to invoke in prayer, as Rome teaches. 
	have the rule—rather,
	"who have had the rule over you": your spiritual
	leaders. 
	who—Greek, "the
	which": such persons as. 
	have spoken unto you—"spake"
	(so the Greek aorist means) during their lifetime. This
	Epistle was among those written later, when many of the heads of the

	whose faith—even unto
	death: probably death by martyrdom, as in the case of the instances
	of faith in Hebrews 11:35.
	Stephen, James the brother of our Lord and bishop of Jerusalem, as

	"looking up to," "diligently contemplating all over,"

	of their conversation—"manner
	of life": "religious walk" (Galatians 1:13;
	Ephesians 4:22; 1 Timothy 4:12;
	James 3:13). Considering how
	they manifested the soundness of their faith by their holy walk,
	which they maintained even to the end of that walk (their
	death by martyrdom).
