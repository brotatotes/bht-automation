<p><b>8.</b> This verse is not, as some
	read it, in apposition with "the end of their conversation"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>), but forms the
	transition. "Jesus Christ, yesterday and to-day (is) the same,
	and (shall be the same) unto the ages (that is, unto all ages)."
	The <i>Jesus Christ</i> (the full name being given, to mark with
	affectionate solemnity both His <i>person</i> and His <i>office</i>)
	who supported your spiritual <i>rulers</i> through life even unto
	their <i>end</i> "yesterday" (in times past), being at once
	"the Author and the Finisher of their faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7- :">Hebrews 13:7- :</span>), remains still the same Jesus Christ "to-day,"
	ready to help you also, if like them you walk by "faith" in
	Him. Compare "this same Jesus," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7- :">Hebrews 13:7- :</span>. He who <i>yesterday</i> (proverbial for the past time)
	suffered and died, is <i>to-day</i> in glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7- :">Hebrews 13:7- :</span>). "As night comes between yesterday and to-day, and yet
	night itself is swallowed up by <i>yesterday</i> and <i>to-day,</i>
	so the "suffering" did not so interrupt the glory of Jesus
	Christ which was of yesterday, and that which is to-day, as not to
	continue to be the same. He is the same <i>yesterday,</i> before He
	came into the world, and <i>to-day,</i> in heaven. <i>Yesterday</i>
	in the time of our predecessors, and <i>to-day</i> in our age"
	[BENGEL]. So the doctrine
	is the <i>same,</i> not variable: this verse thus forms the
	transition between <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:7">Hebrews 13:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:9">Hebrews 13:9</span>. He is always "the
	same" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:12">Hebrews 1:12</span>). The same
	in the Old and in the New Testament.</p>
