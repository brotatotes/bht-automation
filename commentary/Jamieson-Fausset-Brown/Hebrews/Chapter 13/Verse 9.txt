<p><b>9. about</b>—rather, as oldest
	manuscripts read, "carried <i>aside</i>"; namely, compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>divers</b>—differing from
	the one faith in the one and the same Jesus Christ, as taught by them
	who had the rule over you (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14- :">Ephesians 4:14- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>strange</b>—foreign to the
	truth. 
	</p>
<p><b>doctrines</b>—"teachings."
	</p>
<p><b>established with grace; not
	with meats</b>—not with observances of Jewish distinctions between
	clean and unclean meats, to which ascetic Judaizers added in
	Christian times the rejection of some meats, and the use of others:
	noticed also by <i>Paul</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:8">1 Corinthians 8:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:13">1 Corinthians 8:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17">Romans 14:17</span>, an exact parallel to
	this verse: these are some of the "divers and strange doctrines"
	of the previous sentence. Christ's body offered once for all for us,
	is our true spiritual "meat" to "eat" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17- :">Romans 14:17- :</span>), "the stay and the staff of bread" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:17- :">Romans 14:17- :</span>), the mean of all "grace." 
	</p>
<p><b>which have not
	profited</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "in which they who walked were not
	profited"; namely, in respect to justification, perfect
	cleansing of the conscience, and sanctification. Compare on "walked,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span>; namely, with
	superstitious scrupulosity, as though the worship of God in itself
	consisted in such legal observances.</p>
