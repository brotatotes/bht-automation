10. For—giving a reason why
	"the grace of God" required that Jesus "should taste
	death." 
	it became him—The whole
	plan was (not only not derogatory to, but) highly becoming
	God, though unbelief considers it a disgrace [BENGEL].
	An answer to the Jews, and Hebrew Christians, whosoever, through
	impatience at the delay in the promised advent of Christ's glory,
	were in danger of apostasy, stumbling at Christ crucified. The
	Jerusalem Christians especially were liable to this danger. This
	scheme of redemption was altogether such a one as harmonizes with the
	love, justice, and wisdom of God. 
	for whom—God the Father
	(Romans 11:36; 1 Corinthians 8:6;
	Revelation 4:11). In Revelation 4:11- : the same is said of Christ. 
	all things—Greek,
	"the universe of things," "the all
	things." He uses for "God," the periphrasis, "Him
	for whom . . . by whom are all things," to mark the becomingness
	of Christ's suffering as the way to His being "perfected"
	as "Captain of our salvation," seeing that His is the way
	that pleased Him whose will and whose glory are the end of all
	things, and by whose operation all things exist. 
	in bringing—The Greek
	is past, "having brought as He did," namely, in His
	electing purpose (compare "ye are sons," namely,
	in His purpose, Galatians 4:6; Ephesians 1:4),
	a purpose which is accomplished in Jesus being "perfected
	through sufferings." 
	many— (Ephesians 1:4- :). "The Church" (Ephesians 1:4- :), "the general assembly" (Ephesians 1:4- :). 
	sons—no longer children
	as under the Old Testament law, but sons by adoption. 
	unto glory—to share
	Christ's "glory" (Hebrews 2:9;
	compare Hebrews 2:7; John 17:10;
	John 17:22; John 17:24;
	Romans 8:21). Sonship, holiness (Romans 8:21- :), and glory, are inseparably joined. "Suffering,"
	"salvation," and "glory," in Paul's writings,
	often go together (2 Timothy 2:10).
	Salvation presupposes destruction, deliverance from
	which for us required Christ's "sufferings." 
	to make . . . perfect—"to
	consummate"; to bring to consummated glory through sufferings,
	as the appointed avenue to it. "He who suffers for another, not
	only benefits him, but becomes himself the brighter and more perfect"
	[CHRYSOSTOM]. Bringing to
	the end of troubles, and to the goal full of glory: a metaphor
	from the contests in the public games. Compare "It is finished,"
	Luke 24:26; John 19:30.
	I prefer, with CALVIN,
	understanding, "to make perfect as a completed sacrifice":
	legal and official, not moral, perfection is
	meant: "to consecrate" (so the same Greek is
	translated Hebrews 7:28; compare
	Margin) by the finished expiation of His death, as our perfect
	High Priest, and so our "Captain of salvation" (Hebrews 7:28- :). This agrees with Hebrews 7:28- :, "He that sanctifieth," that is, consecrates them
	by Himself being made a consecrated offering for them. So Hebrews 10:14;
	Hebrews 10:29; John 17:19:
	by the perfecting of His consecration for them in His death, He
	perfects their consecration, and so throws open access to glory
	(Hebrews 10:19-21; Hebrews 5:9;
	Hebrews 9:9 accord with this sense). 
	captain of,
	&c.—literally, Prince-leader: as Joshua, not Moses, led
	the people into the Holy Land, so will our Joshua, or Jesus, lead us
	into the heavenly inheritance (Hebrews 9:9- :). The same Greek is in Hebrews 9:9- :, "Author of our faith." Hebrews 9:9- :, "Prince of life" (Hebrews 9:9- :). Preceding others by His example, as well as the originator
	of our salvation.
