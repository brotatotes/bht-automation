<p><b>10. For</b>—giving a reason why
	"the grace of God" required that Jesus "should taste
	death." 
	</p>
<p><b>it became him</b>—The whole
	plan was (not only not derogatory to, but) highly <i>becoming</i>
	God, though unbelief considers it a <i>disgrace</i> [BENGEL].
	An answer to the Jews, and Hebrew Christians, whosoever, through
	impatience at the delay in the promised advent of Christ's glory,
	were in danger of apostasy, stumbling at Christ <i>crucified.</i> The
	Jerusalem Christians especially were liable to this danger. This
	scheme of redemption was altogether such a one as harmonizes with the
	love, justice, and wisdom of God. 
	</p>
<p><b>for whom</b>—God the Father
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:36">Romans 11:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:11">Revelation 4:11</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:11- :">Revelation 4:11- :</span> the same is said of Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>all things</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the</i> universe of things," "<i>the</i> all
	things." He uses for "God," the periphrasis, "Him
	for whom . . . by whom are all things," to mark the becomingness
	of Christ's suffering as the way to His being "perfected"
	as "Captain of our salvation," seeing that His is the way
	that pleased Him whose will and whose glory are <i>the end</i> of all
	things, and by whose <i>operation</i> all things exist. 
	</p>
<p><b>in bringing</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	is past, "having brought as He did," namely, <i>in His
	electing purpose</i> (compare "ye <i>are</i> sons," namely,
	in His purpose, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:6">Galatians 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4">Ephesians 1:4</span>),
	a purpose which is accomplished in Jesus being "perfected
	through sufferings." 
	</p>
<p><b>many</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4- :">Ephesians 1:4- :</span>). "The Church" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4- :">Ephesians 1:4- :</span>), "the general assembly" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:4- :">Ephesians 1:4- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>sons</b>—no longer <i>children</i>
	as under the Old Testament law, but <i>sons</i> by adoption. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto glory</b>—to share
	Christ's "glory" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:7">Hebrews 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:10">John 17:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:22">John 17:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>). Sonship, holiness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21- :">Romans 8:21- :</span>), and glory, are inseparably joined. "Suffering,"
	"salvation," and "glory," in Paul's writings,
	often go together (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:10">2 Timothy 2:10</span>).
	<i>Salvation</i> presupposes <i>destruction,</i> deliverance from
	which for us required Christ's "sufferings." 
	</p>
<p><b>to make . . . perfect</b>—"to
	consummate"; to bring to consummated glory through sufferings,
	as the appointed avenue to it. "He who suffers for another, not
	only benefits him, but becomes himself the brighter and more perfect"
	[CHRYSOSTOM]. Bringing to
	the end of troubles, and to the <i>goal</i> full of glory: a metaphor
	from the contests in the public games. Compare "It is finished,"
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:26">Luke 24:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:30">John 19:30</span>.
	I prefer, with CALVIN,
	understanding, "to make perfect as a completed <i>sacrifice</i>":
	<i>legal</i> and <i>official,</i> not moral, <i>perfection</i> is
	meant: "to <i>consecrate</i>" (so the same <i>Greek</i> is
	translated <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:28">Hebrews 7:28</span>; compare
	<i>Margin</i>) by the finished expiation of His death, as our perfect
	High Priest, and so our "Captain of salvation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:28- :">Hebrews 7:28- :</span>). This agrees with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:28- :">Hebrews 7:28- :</span>, "He that sanctifieth," that is, consecrates them
	by Himself being made a consecrated offering for them. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:14">Hebrews 10:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span>:
	by the perfecting of His consecration for them in His death, He
	perfects their consecration, and so throws open access to glory
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:19-21">Hebrews 10:19-21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9">Hebrews 9:9</span> accord with this sense). 
	</p>
<p><b>captain of,</b>
	&amp;c.—literally, <i>Prince-leader:</i> as Joshua, not Moses, led
	the people into the Holy Land, so will our Joshua, or Jesus, lead us
	into the heavenly inheritance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9- :">Hebrews 9:9- :</span>). The same <i>Greek</i> is in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9- :">Hebrews 9:9- :</span>, "<i>Author</i> of our faith." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9- :">Hebrews 9:9- :</span>, "<i>Prince</i> of life" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:9- :">Hebrews 9:9- :</span>). Preceding others by His example, as well as the originator
	of our salvation.</p>
