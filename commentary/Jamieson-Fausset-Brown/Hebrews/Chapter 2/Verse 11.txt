<p><b>11. he that sanctifieth</b>—Christ
	who once for all consecrates His people to God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, bringing them nigh to Him as the consequence) and everlasting
	glory, by having consecrated Himself for them in His being made
	"perfect (as their expiatory sacrifice) through sufferings"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:10">Hebrews 10:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:14">Hebrews 10:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:17">John 17:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19">John 17:19</span>).
	God in His electing love, by Christ's finished work, <i>perfectly</i>
	sanctifies them to God's service and to heaven <i>once for all:</i>
	then they are <i>progressively</i> sanctified by the transforming
	Spirit "Sanctification is glory working in embryo; glory is
	sanctification come to the birth, and manifested" [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>they who are
	sanctified</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "they that are being sanctified"
	(compare the use of "sanctified," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19- :">John 17:19- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of one</b>—Father, God: not
	in the sense wherein He is Father of <i>all</i> beings, as angels;
	for these are excluded by the argument (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:19- :">John 17:19- :</span>); but as He is Father of His <i>spiritual human</i> sons,
	Christ the Head and elder Brother, and His believing people, the
	members of the body and family. Thus, this and the following verses
	are meant to justify his having said, "many <i>sons</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>). "Of one"
	is not "of one father <i>Adam,</i>" or "Abraham,"
	as BENGEL and others
	suppose. For the Saviour's participation in the <i>lowness</i> of our
	humanity is not mentioned till <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10- :">Hebrews 2:10- :</span>, and then as a consequence of what precedes. Moreover, "Sons
	<i>of God</i>" is, in Scripture usage, the dignity obtained by
	our union with Christ; and our <i>brotherhood</i> with Him flows from
	<i>God</i> being <i>His</i> and <i>our</i> Father. Christ's Sonship
	(by generation) in relation to God is reflected in the sonship (by
	adoption) of His brethren. 
	</p>
<p><b>he is not ashamed</b>—though
	being the Son <i>of God,</i> since they have now by adoption obtained
	a like dignity, so that His majesty is not compromised by brotherhood
	with them (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:16">Hebrews 11:16</span>).
	It is a striking feature in Christianity that it unites such amazing
	contrasts as "our brother and our God" [THOLUCK].
	"God makes of sons of men sons of God, because God hath made of
	the Son of God the Son of man" [ST.
	AUGUSTINE on Psalm 2].</p>
