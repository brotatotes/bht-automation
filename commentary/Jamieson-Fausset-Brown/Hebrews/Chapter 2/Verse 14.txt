<p><b>14.</b> He who has thus been shown
	to be the "Captain (<i>Greek,</i> 'Leader') of salvation"
	to the "many sons," by <i>trusting</i> and <i>suffering</i>
	like them, must therefore become <i>man</i> like them, in order that
	His death may be efficacious for them [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>the children</b>—before
	mentioned (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:13">Hebrews 2:13</span>); those
	existing in His eternal purpose, though not in actual being. 
	</p>
<p><b>are partakers of</b>—literally,
	"have (in His purpose) been partakers" all in common. 
	</p>
<p><b>flesh and blood</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	oldest manuscripts have "blood and flesh." The inner and
	more important element, the <i>blood,</i> as the more immediate
	vehicle of the soul, stands before the more palpable element, the
	flesh; also, with reference to <i>Christ's blood-shedding</i> with a
	view to which He entered into community with our <i>corporeal</i>
	life. "The life of the <i>flesh</i> is in the <i>blood;</i> it
	is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+17:11">Leviticus 17:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+17:14">Leviticus 17:14</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>also</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "in
	a <i>somewhat</i> similar manner"; not <i>altogether</i> in a
	like manner. For He, unlike them, was conceived and born not in sin
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>). But mainly "in
	like manner"; not in mere <i>semblance</i> of a body, as the
	Docetæ heretics taught. 
	</p>
<p><b>took part of</b>—participated
	in. The forfeited inheritance (according to Jewish law) was ransomed
	by the nearest of kin; so Jesus became our nearest of kin by His
	assumed humanity, in order to be our Redeemer. 
	</p>
<p><b>that through death</b>—which
	He could not have undergone as God but only by becoming man. Not by
	Almighty power but <i>by His death</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>) He
	overcame death. "Jesus suffering death overcame; Satan wielding
	death succumbed" [BENGEL].
	As David cut off the head of Goliath with the giant's own sword
	wherewith the latter was wont to win his victories. Coming to redeem
	mankind, Christ made Himself a sort of hook to destroy the devil; for
	in Him there was His humanity to attract the devourer to Him, His
	divinity to pierce him, apparent weakness to provoke, hidden power to
	transfix the hungry ravisher. The <i>Latin</i> epigram says, <i>Mors
	mortis morti mortem nisi morte tu lisset, Æternæ</i> <i>vitæ janua
	clausa foret.</i> "Had not death by death borne to death the
	death of Death, the gate of eternal life would have been closed".
	</p>
<p><b>destroy</b>—literally,
	"render powerless"; deprive of all power to hurt His
	people. "That thou mightest still the enemy and avenger"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+8:2">Psalms 8:2</span>). The same <i>Greek</i>
	verb is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:10">2 Timothy 1:10</span>,
	"abolished death." There is no more death for believers.
	Christ plants in them an undying seed, the germ of heavenly
	immortality, though believers have to pass through natural death. 
	</p>
<p><b>power</b>—Satan is "strong"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:29">Matthew 12:29</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of death</b>—implying that
	<i>death</i> itself is a <i>power</i> which, though originally
	foreign to human nature, now reigns over it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:9">Romans 6:9</span>). The power which death
	has Satan wields. The author of sin is the author of its
	consequences. Compare "power of the enemy" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:9- :">Romans 6:9- :</span>). Satan has acquired over man (by God's law, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:17">Genesis 2:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:23">Romans 6:23</span>) the power of death by
	man's sin, death being the executioner of sin, and man being Satan's
	"<i>lawful</i> captive." Jesus, by dying, has made the
	dying His own (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:9">Romans 14:9</span>), and
	has taken the prey from the mighty. Death's power was manifest; he
	who wielded that power, lurking beneath it, is here expressed,
	namely, Satan. Wisdom 2:24, "By the envy of the devil, death
	entered into the world."</p>
