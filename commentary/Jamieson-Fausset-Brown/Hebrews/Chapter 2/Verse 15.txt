<p><b>subject to bondage</b>—literally,
	"subjects <i>of</i> bondage"; not merely <i>liable to</i>
	it, but <i>enthralled in</i> it (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:15">Romans 8:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1">Galatians 5:1</span>). Contrast with this
	<i>bondage,</i> the <i>glory</i> of the "sons" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:1- :">Galatians 5:1- :</span>). "Bondage" is defined by Aristotle, "The
	living not as one chooses"; "liberty," "the
	living as one chooses." Christ by delivering us from the curse
	of God against our sin, has taken from death all that made it
	formidable. Death, viewed apart from Christ, can only fill with
	horror, if the sinner dares to think.</p>
