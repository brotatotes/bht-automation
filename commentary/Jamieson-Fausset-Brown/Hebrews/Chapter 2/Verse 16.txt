<p><b>16. For verily</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"For <i>as we all know</i>"; "For as you will
	doubtless grant." Paul probably alludes to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:8">Isaiah 41:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:32">Jeremiah 31:32</span>, <i>Septuagint,</i>
	from which all <i>Jews</i> would know well that the fact here stated
	as to Messiah was what the prophets had led them to expect.

<p><b>took not on </b><i><b>him</b></i><b>,</b>
	c.—rather, "It is not angels that He is <i>helping</i> (the
	present tense implies <i>duration</i>) but it is the seed of Abraham
	that He is <i>helping.</i>" The verb is literally, <i>to help by
	taking one by the hand,</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:32- :">Jeremiah 31:32- :</span>, "When I took them by the hand," c. Thus it answers
	to "succor," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:18">Hebrews 2:18</span>,
	and "deliver," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:15">Hebrews 2:15</span>.
	"Not angels," who have no flesh and blood, but "the
	children," who have "flesh and blood," He takes hold
	of to help by "Himself taking part of the same" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:15- :">Hebrews 2:15- :</span>). Whatever effect Christ's work may have on angels, He is
	not taking hold to help them by suffering in their nature to deliver
	them from death, as in our case. 
	</p>
<p><b>the seed of Abraham</b>—He
	views Christ's redemption (in compliment to the Hebrews whom he is
	addressing, and as enough for his present purpose) with reference to
	Abraham's seed, <i>the Jewish nation,</i> primarily not that he
	excludes the Gentiles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span>,
	"for every man"), who, when believers, are the seed of
	Abraham spiritually (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:12">Hebrews 2:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:22">Psalms 22:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:25">Psalms 22:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:27">Psalms 22:27</span>), but direct reference
	to them (such as is in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:11">Romans 4:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:12">Romans 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:16">Romans 4:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:7">Galatians 3:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:14">Galatians 3:14</span>;

	would be out of place in his present argument. It is the same
	argument for Jesus being the Christ which Matthew, writing his Gospel
	for the Hebrews, uses, tracing the genealogy of Jesus from Abraham,
	the father of the Jews, and the one to whom the promises were given,
	on which the Jews especially prided themselves (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:4">Romans 9:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:5">Romans 9:5</span>).</p>
