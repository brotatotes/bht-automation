<p><b>17. Wherefore</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Whence." Found in <i>Paul's</i> speech, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>in all things</b>—which are
	incidental to manhood, the being born, nourished, growing up,
	suffering. <i>Sin</i> is not, in the original constitution of man, a
	necessary attendant of manhood, so He had no sin. 
	</p>
<p><b>it behooved him</b>—by
	moral necessity, considering what the justice and love of God
	required of Him as Mediator (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), the office which He had voluntarily undertaken in order to
	"help" man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16">Hebrews 2:16</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>his brethren</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16- :">Hebrews 2:16- :</span>); "the seed of Abraham" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16- :">Hebrews 2:16- :</span>), and so also the spiritual seed, His elect out of all
	mankind. 
	</p>
<p><b>be,</b> c.—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"that He might <i>become</i> High Priest" He was <i>called</i>
	so, when He was "made perfect by the things which He suffered"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:8-10">Hebrews 5:8-10</span>).
	He was actually <i>made</i> so, when He entered within the veil, from
	which last flows His ever continuing intercession as Priest for us.
	The death, as man, must first be, in order that the bringing in of
	the blood into the heavenly Holy Place might follow, in which
	consisted the expiation as High Priest. 
	</p>
<p><b>merciful</b>—to "the
	<i>people</i>" deserving wrath by "sins." <i>Mercy</i>
	is a prime requisite in a priest, since his office is to help the
	wretched and raise the fallen: such <i>mercy</i> is most likely to be
	found in one who has a fellow-feeling with the afflicted, having been
	so once Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>); not
	that the Son of God needed to be taught by suffering to be merciful,
	but that in order to save us He needed to take our manhood with all
	its sorrows, thereby qualifying Himself, by experimental suffering
	with us, to be our sympathizing High Priest, and assuring us of His
	entire fellow-feeling with us in every sorrow. So in the main CALVIN
	remarks here. 
	</p>
<p><b>faithful</b>—true to God
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:5">Hebrews 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>)
	and to man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span>) in the
	mediatorial office which He has undertaken. 
	</p>
<p><b>high priest</b>—which Moses
	was not, though "faithful" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:23- :">Hebrews 10:23- :</span>). Nowhere, except in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:13">Zechariah 6:13</span>, and in this Epistle, is
	Christ expressly called a <i>priest.</i> In this Epistle alone His
	priesthood is professedly discussed; whence it is evident how
	necessary is this book of the New Testament. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:1-7">Psalms 110:1-7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:13">Zechariah 6:13</span>, there is added mention
	of the <i>kingdom</i> of Christ, which elsewhere is spoken of without
	the <i>priesthood,</i> and that frequently. On the cross, whereon as
	Priest He offered the sacrifice, He had the title "King"
	inscribed over Him [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>to make reconciliation for
	the sins</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i> "to propitiate (in
	respect to) the sins"; "to expiate the sins." Strictly
	divine <i>justice</i> is "propitiated"; but God's <i>love</i>
	is as much from everlasting as His justice; therefore, lest Christ's
	sacrifice, or its typical forerunners, the legal sacrifices, should
	be thought to be antecedent to God's grace and love, neither are said
	in the Old or New Testament to have <i>propitiated God;</i> otherwise
	Christ's sacrifices might have been thought to have first induced God
	to love and pity man, instead of (as the fact really is) His love
	having <i>originated</i> Christ's sacrifice, whereby divine justice
	and divine love are harmonized. The sinner is brought by that
	sacrifice into God's favor, which by sin he had forfeited; hence his
	right prayer is, "God <i>be propitiated</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>)
	to me who am a sinner" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:13- :">Zechariah 6:13- :</span>). Sins bring death and "the fear of death" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:13- :">Zechariah 6:13- :</span>). He had no sin Himself, and "made reconciliation for
	the iniquity" of all others (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+6:13- :">Zechariah 6:13- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of the people</b>—"the
	seed of Abraham" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16">Hebrews 2:16</span>);
	the literal Israel first, and then (in the design of God), through
	Israel, the believing Gentiles, the spiritual Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:16- :">Hebrews 2:16- :</span>).</p>
