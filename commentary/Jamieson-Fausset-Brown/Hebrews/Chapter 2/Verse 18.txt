<p><b>18. For</b>—explanation of how His
	being <i>made like His brethren in all things</i> has made Him <i>a
	merciful and faithful High Priest</i> for us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in that</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "wherein He suffered Himself; having been tempted,
	He is able to succor them <i>that are being tempted</i>" in the
	same temptation; and as "He was tempted (tried and afflicted) in
	all points," He is able (by the power of <i>sympathy</i>) to
	succor us in all possible temptations and trials incidental to man
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:16">Hebrews 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:2">Hebrews 5:2</span>).
	He is the antitypical Solomon, having for every grain of Abraham's
	seed (which were to be as the sand for number), "largeness of
	heart even as the sand that is on the seashore" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:2- :">Hebrews 5:2- :</span>). "Not only as God He knows our trials, but also as man
	He knows them by experimental feeling."</p>
