6. But—It is not to angels the
	Gospel kingdom is subject, BUT
	. . . 
	one . . . testified—the
	usual way of quoting Scripture to readers familiar with it.  :- praises Jehovah for exalting MAN,
	so as to subject all the works of God on earth to him: this dignity
	having been lost by the first Adam, is realized only in Christ the
	Son of man, the Representative Man and Head of our redeemed race.
	Thus Paul proves that it is to MAN,
	not to angels, that God has subjected the "world to
	come." In Hebrews 2:6-8,
	MAN is spoken of in
	general ("him . . . him . . . his); then at Hebrews 2:6-58.2.8- :, first JESUS is
	introduced as fulfilling, as man, all the conditions of the prophecy,
	and passing through death Himself; and so consequently bringing us
	men, His "brethren," to "glory and honor." 
	What, &c.—How
	insignificant in himself, yet how exalted by God's grace! (Compare Hebrews 2:6-58.2.8- :). The Hebrew, "Enosh" and
	"Ben-Adam," express "man" and "Son of
	man" in his weakness: "Son of man" is here used of any
	and every child of man: unlike, seemingly, the lord of
	creation, such as he was originally (Hebrews 2:6-58.2.8- :), and such as he is designed to be (Hebrews 2:6-58.2.8- :), and such as he actually is by title and shall hereafter
	more fully be in the person of, and in union with, Jesus,
	pre-eminently the Son of man (Hebrews 2:6-58.2.8- :). 
	art mindful—as of one
	absent. 
	visitest—lookest
	after him, as one present.
