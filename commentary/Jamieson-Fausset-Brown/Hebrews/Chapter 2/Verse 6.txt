<p><b>6. But</b>—It is not to angels the

<p><b>one . . . testified</b>—the
	usual way of quoting Scripture to readers familiar with it. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> praises Jehovah for exalting MAN,
	so as to subject all the works of God on earth to him: this dignity
	having been lost by the first Adam, is realized only in Christ the
	Son of man, the Representative Man and Head of our redeemed race.
	Thus Paul proves that it is to MAN,
	not to <i>angels,</i> that God has subjected the "world to
	come." In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6-8">Hebrews 2:6-8</span>,
	MAN is spoken of <i>in
	general</i> ("him . . . him . . . his); then at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6-58.2.8- :">Hebrews 2:6-58.2.8- :</span>, first JESUS is
	introduced as fulfilling, as man, all the conditions of the prophecy,
	and passing through death Himself; and so consequently bringing us
	men, His "brethren," to "glory and honor." 
	</p>
<p><b>What,</b> &amp;c.—How
	insignificant in himself, yet how exalted by God's grace! (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6-58.2.8- :">Hebrews 2:6-58.2.8- :</span>). The <i>Hebrew,</i> "<i>Enosh</i>" and
	"<i>Ben-Adam,</i>" express "man" and "Son of
	man" in his weakness: "Son of man" is here used of <i>any</i>
	and <i>every child of man:</i> unlike, seemingly, the lord of
	creation, such as he was originally (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6-58.2.8- :">Hebrews 2:6-58.2.8- :</span>), and such as he is designed to be (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6-58.2.8- :">Hebrews 2:6-58.2.8- :</span>), and such as he actually is by title and shall hereafter
	more fully be in the person of, and in union with, Jesus,
	pre-eminently the Son of man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:6-58.2.8- :">Hebrews 2:6-58.2.8- :</span>).
