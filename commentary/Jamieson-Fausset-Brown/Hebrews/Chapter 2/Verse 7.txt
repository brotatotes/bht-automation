	"than God," "<i>Elohim,</i>" that is, the
	abstract qualities of God, such as <i>angels</i> possess in an
	inferior form; namely, heavenly, spiritual, incorporeal natures. Man,
	in his original creation, was set next beneath them. So the man
	Jesus, though Lord of angels, when He emptied Himself of the
	externals of His Divinity (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), was in His human nature "a little lower than the
	angels"; though this is not the primary reference here, but <i>man</i>
	in general.
