	Jesus, on account of His suffering of death, crowned," c. He is
	already crowned, though unseen by us, save by faith hereafter all
	things shall be subjected to Him visibly and fully. The ground of His
	exaltation is "on accoumt of His having suffered death"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8">Philippians 2:8</span>;

	The reading of ORIGEN,
	"That He <i>without God</i>" (<i>laying aside His Divinity;</i>
	or, for every being <i>save God:</i> or perhaps alluding to His
	having been temporarily "forsaken," as the Sin-bearer, by
	the Father on the cross), is not supported by the manuscripts. The
	"that," c., is connected with "crowned with glory,"
	&amp;c., thus: His exaltation after sufferings is the <i>perfecting</i>
	or consummation of His work (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:4- :">Titus 3:4- :</span>) for us: without it His death would have been ineffectual
	with it, and from it, flows the result <i>that His tasting of death
	is available for</i> (in behalf of, for the good of) <i>every man.</i>
	He is crowned as the Head in heaven of our common humanity,
	presenting His blood as the all-prevailing plea for us. This
	coronation above makes His death applicable for <i>every</i>
	individual <i>man</i> (observe the singular; not merely "for all
	men"), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:2">1 John 2:2</span>. "Taste death"
	implies His personal experimental undergoing of death: death of the
	body, and death (spiritually) of the soul, in His being forsaken of
	the Father. "As a physician first tastes his medicines to
	encourage his sick patient to take them, so Christ, when all men
	feared death, in order to persuade them to be bold in meeting it,
	tasted it Himself, though He had no need" [CHRYSOSTOM].
