<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. THE SON
	OF GOD GREATER
	THAN MOSES,
	WHEREFORE UNBELIEF
	TOWARDS HIM WILL
	INCUR A HEAVIER
	PUNISHMENT THAN BEFELL
	UNBELIEVING ISRAEL
	IN THE WILDERNESS.

<p>As Moses especially was the
	prophet by whom "God in times past spake to the fathers,"
	being the mediator of the law, Paul deems it necessary now to show
	that, great as was Moses, the Son of God is greater. EBRARD
	in ALFORD remarks, The
	angel of the covenant came in the name of God before Israel; Moses in
	the name of Israel before God; whereas the high priest came <i>both</i>
	in the name of God (bearing the name JEHOVAH
	on his forehead) before Israel, and in the name of Israel (bearing
	the names of the twelve tribes on his breast) before God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:9-29">Exodus 28:9-29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:36">Exodus 28:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:38">Exodus 28:38</span>).
	Now Christ is above the angels, according to the first and second
	chapters because (1) as Son of God He is higher; and (2) because
	manhood, though originally lower than angels, is in Him exalted above
	them to the lordship of "the world to come," inasmuch as He
	is at once Messenger of God to men, and also atoning
	Priest-Representative of men before God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:18">Hebrews 2:18</span>). Parallel with this
	line of argument as to His superiority to angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:18- :">Hebrews 2:18- :</span>) runs that which here follows as to His superiority to Moses
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:3">Hebrews 3:3</span>): (1) because as <i>Son</i>
	over the house; He is above the <i>servant</i> in the house (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:5">Hebrews 3:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>), just as the <i>angels</i>
	were shown to be but <i>ministering</i> (serving) spirits (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6- :">Hebrews 3:6- :</span>), whereas He is the <i>Son</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:7">Hebrews 3:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:8">Hebrews 3:8</span>); (2) because the
	bringing of Israel into the promised rest, which was not finished by
	Moses, is accomplished by Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:8- :">Hebrews 3:8- :</span>), through His being not merely a leader and lawgiver as
	Moses, but also a propitiatory High Priest (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:10">Hebrews 5:10</span>).</p>
