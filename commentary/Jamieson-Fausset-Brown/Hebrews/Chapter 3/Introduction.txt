 CHAPTER 3 
	
 :-. THE SON
	OF GOD GREATER
	THAN MOSES,
	WHEREFORE UNBELIEF
	TOWARDS HIM WILL
	INCUR A HEAVIER
	PUNISHMENT THAN BEFELL
	UNBELIEVING ISRAEL
	IN THE WILDERNESS. 
	As Moses especially was the
	prophet by whom "God in times past spake to the fathers,"
	being the mediator of the law, Paul deems it necessary now to show
	that, great as was Moses, the Son of God is greater. EBRARD
	in ALFORD remarks, The
	angel of the covenant came in the name of God before Israel; Moses in
	the name of Israel before God; whereas the high priest came both
	in the name of God (bearing the name JEHOVAH
	on his forehead) before Israel, and in the name of Israel (bearing
	the names of the twelve tribes on his breast) before God (Exodus 28:9-29;
	Exodus 28:36; Exodus 28:38).
	Now Christ is above the angels, according to the first and second
	chapters because (1) as Son of God He is higher; and (2) because
	manhood, though originally lower than angels, is in Him exalted above
	them to the lordship of "the world to come," inasmuch as He
	is at once Messenger of God to men, and also atoning
	Priest-Representative of men before God (Hebrews 2:17;
	Hebrews 2:18). Parallel with this
	line of argument as to His superiority to angels (Hebrews 2:18- :) runs that which here follows as to His superiority to Moses
	(Hebrews 3:3): (1) because as Son
	over the house; He is above the servant in the house (Hebrews 3:5;
	Hebrews 3:6), just as the angels
	were shown to be but ministering (serving) spirits (Hebrews 3:6- :), whereas He is the Son (Hebrews 3:7;
	Hebrews 3:8); (2) because the
	bringing of Israel into the promised rest, which was not finished by
	Moses, is accomplished by Him (Hebrews 3:8- :), through His being not merely a leader and lawgiver as
	Moses, but also a propitiatory High Priest (Hebrews 4:14;
	Hebrews 5:10).
