<p><b>12. Take heed</b>—to be joined
	with "wherefore," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:7">Hebrews 3:7</span>.
	</p>
<p><b>lest there be</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	(indicative), "lest there <i>shall</i> be"; lest there be,
	as I fear there is; implying that it is not merely a <i>possible</i>
	contingency, but that there is ground for thinking <i>it will be so.</i>
</p>
<p><b>in any</b>—"in any one
	of you." Not merely ought all in general be on their guard, but
	they ought to be so concerned for the safety of <i>each one</i>
	member, as not to suffer any one to perish through their negligence
	[CALVIN]. 
	</p>
<p><b>heart</b>—The heart is not
	to be trusted. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:10">Hebrews 3:10</span>,
	"They do always err in their heart." 
	</p>
<p><b>unbelief</b>—<i>faithlessness.</i>
	Christ is <i>faithful;</i> therefore, saith Paul to the Hebrews, we
	ought not to be <i>faithless</i> as our fathers were under Moses. 
	</p>
<p><b>departing</b>—apostatizing.
	The opposite of "come unto" Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:10- :">Hebrews 3:10- :</span>). God punishes such apostates in kind. He departs from
	them—the worst of woes. 
	</p>
<p><b>the living God</b>—real:
	the distinctive characteristic of the God of Israel, not like the
	lifeless gods of the heathen; therefore One whose threats are awful
	realities. To apostatize from Christ is to apostatize from the living
	God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:3">Hebrews 2:3</span>).</p>
