	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:15">Hebrews 3:15</span>), did provoke (God)?"
	The "For" implies, Ye need to take heed against unbelief:
	for, was it not because of unbelief that all our fathers were
	excluded (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+2:3">Ezekiel 2:3</span>)? "Some,"
	and "not all," would be a faint way of putting his
	argument, when his object is to show the <i>universality</i> of the
	evil. Not merely <i>some,</i> but <i>all</i> the Israelites, for the
	solitary exceptions, Joshua and Caleb, are hardly to be taken into
	account in so general a statement. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:17">Hebrews 3:17</span>;

	the beginning of the provocation, soon after the departure from
	Egypt, is marked in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:16">Hebrews 3:16</span>;
	(2) the forty years of it in the wilderness, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:16- :">Hebrews 3:16- :</span>; (3) the denial of entrance into the land of rest, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:16- :">Hebrews 3:16- :</span>. Compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:16- :">Hebrews 3:16- :</span>, "with the majority of them God was displeased."
