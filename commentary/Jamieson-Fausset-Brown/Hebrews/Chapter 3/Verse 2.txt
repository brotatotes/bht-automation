2. He first notes the feature of
	resemblance between Moses and Christ, in order to conciliate
	the Hebrew Christians whom He addressed, and who still entertained a
	very high opinion of Moses; he afterwards brings forward Christ's
	superiority to Moses. 
	Who was faithful—The
	Greek implies also that He still is faithful, namely, as our
	mediating High Priest, faithful to the trust God has assigned Him
	(Hebrews 2:17). So Moses in God's
	house (Numbers 12:7). 
	appointed him—"made
	Him" HIGH PRIEST;
	to be supplied from the preceding context. Greek, "made";
	so in Hebrews 5:5; 1 Samuel 12:6,
	Margin; Acts 2:36; so the
	Greek fathers. Not as ALFORD,
	with AMBROSE and the
	Latins, "created Him," that is, as man, in His
	incarnation. The likeness of Moses to Messiah was foretold by Moses
	himself (Deuteronomy 18:15). Other
	prophets only explained Moses, who was in this respect
	superior to them; but Christ was like Moses, yet superior.
