<p><b>2.</b> He first notes the feature of
	<i>resemblance</i> between Moses and Christ, in order to conciliate
	the Hebrew Christians whom He addressed, and who still entertained a
	very high opinion of Moses; he afterwards brings forward Christ's
	superiority to Moses.

<p><b>Who was faithful</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> implies also that He still is faithful, namely, as our
	mediating High Priest, faithful to the trust God has assigned Him
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:17">Hebrews 2:17</span>). So Moses in God's
	<i>house</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+12:7">Numbers 12:7</span>).

<p><b>appointed him</b>—"<i>made</i>
	Him" HIGH PRIEST;
	to be supplied from the preceding context. <i>Greek,</i> "made";
	so in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:5">Hebrews 5:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+12:6">1 Samuel 12:6</span>,
	<i>Margin;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:36">Acts 2:36</span>; so the
	<i>Greek</i> fathers. Not as ALFORD,
	with AMBROSE and the
	Latins, "<i>created</i> Him," that is, as man, in His
	incarnation. The likeness of Moses to Messiah was foretold by Moses
	himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+18:15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>). Other
	prophets only <i>explained Moses,</i> who was in this respect
	superior to them; but Christ was <i>like Moses,</i> yet superior.</p>
