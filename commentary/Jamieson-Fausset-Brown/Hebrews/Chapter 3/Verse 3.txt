<p><b>builded the house</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"inasmuch as He hath more honor than the house, who <i>prepared</i>
	it," or "<i>established</i> it" [ALFORD].
	The <i>Greek</i> verb is used purposely instead of "builded,"
	in order to mark that the building meant is not a literal, but a
	spiritual house: the Church both of the Old Testament and New
	Testament; and that the building of such a house includes all the
	<i>preparations</i> of providence and grace needed to furnish it with
	"living stones" and fitting "servants." Thus, as
	Christ the Founder and Establisher (in Old Testament as well as the
	New Testament) is greater than the house so established, including
	the servants, He is greater also than Moses, who was but a "servant."
	Moses, as a servant, is a portion of the house, and less than the
	house; Christ, as the Instrumental Creator of all things, must be
	God, and so greater than the house of which Moses was but a part.
	<i>Glory</i> is the result of <i>honor.</i></p>
