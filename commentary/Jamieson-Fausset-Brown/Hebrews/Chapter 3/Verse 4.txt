<p><b>4.</b> Someone must be the
	establisher of every house; Moses was not the establisher of the
	house, but a portion of it (but He who established all things, <i>and
	therefore</i> the spiritual house in question, is God). Christ, as
	being instrumentally the Establisher of all things, must be the
	Establisher of the house, and so greater than Moses.</p>
