4. Someone must be the
	establisher of every house; Moses was not the establisher of the
	house, but a portion of it (but He who established all things, and
	therefore the spiritual house in question, is God). Christ, as
	being instrumentally the Establisher of all things, must be the
	Establisher of the house, and so greater than Moses.
