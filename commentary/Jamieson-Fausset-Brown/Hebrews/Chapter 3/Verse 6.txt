<p><b>as a son over his own
	house</b>—rather, "over <i>His</i> (GOD'S,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:4">Hebrews 3:4</span>) house"; and
	therefore, as <i>the inference</i> from His being one with God, <i>over
	His own house.</i> So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:21">Hebrews 10:21</span>,
	"having an High Priest over the house <i>of God.</i>"
	Christ enters His Father's house as the Master [OVER
	it], but Moses as a servant [IN
	it, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:2">Hebrews 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:5">Hebrews 3:5</span>]
	[CHRYSOSTOM]. An
	ambassador in the absence of the king is very distinguished—in the
	presence of the king he falls back into the multitude [BENGEL].

<p><b>whose house are we</b>—Paul
	and his Hebrew readers. One old manuscript, with <i>Vulgate</i> and
	LUCIFER, reads, "<i>which</i>
	house"; but the weightiest manuscripts support <i>English
	Version</i> reading.

<p><b>the rejoicing</b>—rather,
	"the matter of rejoicing." 
	</p>
<p><b>of the hope</b>—"of
	<i>our</i> hope." Since all our good things lie in hopes, we
	ought so to hold fast our hopes as already to rejoice, as though our
	hopes were realized [CHRYSOSTOM].
	</p>
<p><b>firm unto the end</b>—omitted
	in LUCIFER and AMBROSE,
	and in one oldest manuscript, but supported by most oldest
	manuscripts.</p>
