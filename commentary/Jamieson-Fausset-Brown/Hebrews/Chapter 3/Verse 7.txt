<p><b>7-11.</b> Exhortation from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, not through unbelief to lose participation in the
	spiritual house. Seeing that we are the house of God if we hold fast
	our confidence . . . (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:6">Hebrews 3:6</span>).
	Jesus is "faithful," be not ye unfaithful (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:2">Hebrews 3:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12">Hebrews 3:12</span>). The sentence beginning
	with "wherefore," interrupted by the parenthesis confirming
	the argument from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12- :">Hebrews 3:12- :</span>, is completed at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12- :">Hebrews 3:12- :</span>, "Take heed," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>Holy Ghost saith</b>—by the
	inspired Psalmist so that the words of the latter are the words of
	God Himself. 
	</p>
<p><b>To-day</b>—at length; in
	David's day, as contrasted with the days of Moses in the wilderness,
	and the whole time since then, during which they had been rebellious
	against God's voice; as for instance, in the wilderness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:12- :">Hebrews 3:12- :</span>). The Psalm, each fresh time when used in public worship, by
	"to-day," will mean the particular day when it was, or is,
	used. 
	</p>
<p><b>hear</b>—obediently. 
	</p>
<p><b>his voice</b>—of grace.</p>
