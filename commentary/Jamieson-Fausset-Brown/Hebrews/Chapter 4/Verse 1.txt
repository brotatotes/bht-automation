<p><b>1. Let us . . . fear</b>—not with
	slavish terror, but godly "fear and trembling" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Since so many have fallen, we have cause to fear (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>being left us</b>—still
	<i>remaining</i> to us after the others have, by neglect, lost it. 
	</p>
<p><b>his rest</b>—God's heavenly
	rest, of which Canaan is the type. "To-day" still
	continues, during which there is the danger of failing to reach the
	<i>rest.</i> "To-day," rightly used, terminates in the <i>rest</i>
	which, when once obtained, is never lost (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). A foretaste of the rest Is given in the inward rest which
	the believer's soul has in Christ.

<p><b>should seem to come short of
	it</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "to <i>have</i> come short of it";
	<i>should be found,</i> when the great trial of all shall take place
	[ALFORD], to have fallen
	short of attaining the promise. The word "seem" is a
	mitigating mode of expression, though not lessening the reality.
	BENGEL and OWEN
	take it, Lest there should be any <i>semblance</i> or appearance of
	falling short.</p>
