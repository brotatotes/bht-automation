<p><b>11. Let us . . . therefore</b>—Seeing
	such a promise is before us, which we may, like them, fall short of
	through unbelief. 
	</p>
<p><b>labour</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"strive diligently." 
	</p>
<p><b>that rest</b>—which is
	still future and so glorious. Or, in ALFORD'S
	translation of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:10">Hebrews 4:10</span>, "That
	rest into which <i>Christ</i> has entered before" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20">Hebrews 6:20</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>fall</b>—with the soul, not
	merely the body, as the rebel Israelites fell (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20- :">Hebrews 6:20- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>after the same example</b>—ALFORD
	translates, "fall <i>into</i> the same example." The less
	prominent place of the "fall" in the <i>Greek</i> favors
	this. The sense is, "lest any fall into such <i>disobedience</i>
	(so the <i>Greek</i> for 'unbelief' means) as they gave a sample of"
	[GROTIUS]. The Jews say,
	"The parents are a sign (warning) to their sons."</p>
