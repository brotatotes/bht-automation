11. Let us . . . therefore—Seeing
	such a promise is before us, which we may, like them, fall short of
	through unbelief. 
	labour—Greek,
	"strive diligently." 
	that rest—which is
	still future and so glorious. Or, in ALFORD'S
	translation of Hebrews 4:10, "That
	rest into which Christ has entered before" (Hebrews 4:14;
	Hebrews 6:20). 
	fall—with the soul, not
	merely the body, as the rebel Israelites fell (Hebrews 6:20- :). 
	after the same example—ALFORD
	translates, "fall into the same example." The less
	prominent place of the "fall" in the Greek favors
	this. The sense is, "lest any fall into such disobedience
	(so the Greek for 'unbelief' means) as they gave a sample of"
	[GROTIUS]. The Jews say,
	"The parents are a sign (warning) to their sons."
