<p><b>opened</b>—literally,
	"thrown on the back so as to have the neck laid bare," as a
	victim with neck exposed for sacrifice. The <i>Greek</i> perfect
	tense implies that this is our <i>continuous</i> state in relation to
	God. "Show, O man, <i>shame</i> and <i>fear</i> towards thy God,
	for no veil, no twisting, bending, coloring, or disguise, can cover
	<i>unbelief</i>" (<i>Greek,</i> 'disobedience,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:12- :">Hebrews 4:12- :</span>). Let us, therefore, earnestly labor to enter the rest lest
