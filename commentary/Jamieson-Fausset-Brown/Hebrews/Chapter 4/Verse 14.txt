	namely, those which come between us and God, the aerial heaven, and
	that above the latter containing the heavenly bodies, the sun, moon,
	c. These heavens were the veil which our High Priest <i>passed
	through</i> into the heaven of heavens, the immediate presence of
	God, just as the Levitical high priest passed through the veil into
	the Holy of Holies. Neither Moses, nor even Joshua, could bring us
	into this rest, but Jesus, as our Forerunner, already spiritually,
	and hereafter in actual presence, body, soul, and spirit, brings His
	people into the heavenly rest.

	As the <i>genitive</i> follows, the literally, sense is, "Let us
	<i>take hold</i> of our profession," that is, of the faith and
	hope which are subjects of our profession and confession. The
	accusative follows when the sense is "hold fast"
