<p><b>16. come</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"approach," "draw near." 
	</p>
<p><b>boldly</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"with confidence," or "freedom of speech" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>the throne of grace</b>—God's
	throne is become to us a <i>throne of grace</i> through the mediation
	of our High Priest at God's right hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:1">Hebrews 8:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>). Pleading our High
	Priest Jesus' meritorious death, we shall always find God on a <i>throne
	of grace.</i> Contrast Job's complaint (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2- :">Hebrews 12:2- :</span>) and Elihu's " IF,"
	c. (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+33:23-28">Job 33:23-28</span>).

<p><b>obtain</b>—rather,
	"receive." 
	</p>
<p><b>mercy</b>—"Compassion,"
	by its derivation (literally, fellow feeling from <i>community</i> of
	<i>suffering</i>), corresponds to the character of our High Priest
	"touched with the feeling of our infirmities" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+33:23-18.33.28- :">Job 33:23-18.33.28- :</span>).

<p><b>find grace</b>—corresponding
	to "throne <i>of grace.</i>" <i>Mercy</i> especially refers
	to the remission and removal of sins <i>grace,</i> to the saving
	bestowal of spiritual gifts [ESTIUS].
	Compare "Come unto Me . . . and I will <i>give</i> you rest (the
	rest <i>received</i> on first believing). Take My yoke on you . . .
	and ye shall <i>find</i> rest (the continuing rest and peace <i>found</i>
	in daily submitting to Christ's easy yoke; the former answers to
	"<i>receive</i> mercy" here; the latter, to "<i>find</i>
	grace," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:28">Matthew 11:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>).

<p><b>in time of need</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"seasonably." Before we are overwhelmed by the temptation;
	when we most need it, in temptations and persecutions; such as is
	suitable to the time, persons, and end designed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29- :">Matthew 11:29- :</span>). A supply of grace is in store for believers against all
	exigencies; but they are only supplied with it according as the need
	arises. Compare "in due time," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29- :">Matthew 11:29- :</span>. Not, as ALFORD
	explains, "help in time," that is, <i>to-day,</i> while it
	is yet open to us; the accepted time (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29- :">Matthew 11:29- :</span>).

<p><b>help</b>—Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29- :">Matthew 11:29- :</span>, "He is able to <i>succor</i> them that are tempted."</p>
