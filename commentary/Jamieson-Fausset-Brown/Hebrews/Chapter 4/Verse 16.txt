16. come—rather as Greek,
	"approach," "draw near." 
	boldly—Greek,
	"with confidence," or "freedom of speech" ( :-). 
	the throne of grace—God's
	throne is become to us a throne of grace through the mediation
	of our High Priest at God's right hand (Hebrews 8:1;
	Hebrews 12:2). Pleading our High
	Priest Jesus' meritorious death, we shall always find God on a throne
	of grace. Contrast Job's complaint (Hebrews 12:2- :) and Elihu's " IF,"
	c. (Job 33:23-28). 
	obtain—rather,
	"receive." 
	mercy—"Compassion,"
	by its derivation (literally, fellow feeling from community of
	suffering), corresponds to the character of our High Priest
	"touched with the feeling of our infirmities" (Job 33:23-18.33.28- :). 
	find grace—corresponding
	to "throne of grace." Mercy especially refers
	to the remission and removal of sins grace, to the saving
	bestowal of spiritual gifts [ESTIUS].
	Compare "Come unto Me . . . and I will give you rest (the
	rest received on first believing). Take My yoke on you . . .
	and ye shall find rest (the continuing rest and peace found
	in daily submitting to Christ's easy yoke; the former answers to
	"receive mercy" here; the latter, to "find
	grace," Matthew 11:28; Matthew 11:29).
	in time of need—Greek,
	"seasonably." Before we are overwhelmed by the temptation;
	when we most need it, in temptations and persecutions; such as is
	suitable to the time, persons, and end designed (Matthew 11:29- :). A supply of grace is in store for believers against all
	exigencies; but they are only supplied with it according as the need
	arises. Compare "in due time," Matthew 11:29- :. Not, as ALFORD
	explains, "help in time," that is, to-day, while it
	is yet open to us; the accepted time (Matthew 11:29- :). 
	help—Compare Matthew 11:29- :, "He is able to succor them that are tempted."
