<p><b>2. gospel preached . . . unto
	them</b>—in type: the earthly Canaan, wherein they failed to
	realize perfect rest, suggesting to them that they should look beyond
	to the heavenly land of rest, to which <i>faith</i> is the avenue,
	and from which <i>unbelief</i> excludes, as it did from the earthly
	Canaan. 
	</p>
<p><b>the word preached</b>—literally,
	"the word of hearing": <i>the word heard by them.</i>
</p>
<p><b>not being mixed with faith in
	them that heard</b>—So the <i>Syriac</i> and the <i>Old Latin
	Versions,</i> older than any of our manuscripts, and LUCIFER,
	read, "As the world did not unite with the hearers in faith."
	The word heard being the food which, as the bread of life, must pass
	into flesh and blood through man's appropriating it to himself in
	faith. Hearing alone is of as little value as undigested food in a
	bad stomach [THOLUCK]. The
	whole of oldest <i>extant</i> manuscript authority supports a
	different reading, "unmingled as <i>they</i> were (<i>Greek</i>
	accusative case agreeing with 'them') in faith with its hearers,"
	that is, with its <i>believing, obedient</i> hearers, as Caleb and
	Joshua. So "hear" is used for "obey" in the
	context, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:7">Hebrews 4:7</span>, "To-day,
	if ye will hear His voice." The disobedient, instead of being
	blended in "the same body," separated themselves as Korah:
	a tacit reproof to like separatists from the Christian assembling
	together (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:25">Hebrews 10:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:19">Judges 1:19</span>).</p>
