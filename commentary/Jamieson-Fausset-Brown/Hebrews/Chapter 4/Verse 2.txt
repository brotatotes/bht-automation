	realize perfect rest, suggesting to them that they should look beyond

not being mixed with faith in
	them that heard—So the Syriac and the Old Latin
	Versions, older than any of our manuscripts, and LUCIFER,
	read, "As the world did not unite with the hearers in faith."
	The word heard being the food which, as the bread of life, must pass
	into flesh and blood through man's appropriating it to himself in
	faith. Hearing alone is of as little value as undigested food in a
	bad stomach [THOLUCK]. The
	whole of oldest extant manuscript authority supports a
	different reading, "unmingled as they were (Greek
	accusative case agreeing with 'them') in faith with its hearers,"
	that is, with its believing, obedient hearers, as Caleb and
	Joshua. So "hear" is used for "obey" in the
	context, Hebrews 4:7, "To-day,
	if ye will hear His voice." The disobedient, instead of being
	blended in "the same body," separated themselves as Korah:
	a tacit reproof to like separatists from the Christian assembling
	together (Hebrews 10:25; Judges 1:19).
