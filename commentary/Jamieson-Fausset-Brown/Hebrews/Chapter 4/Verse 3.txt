3. For—justifying his
	assertion of the need of "faith,"  :-. 
	we which have believed—we
	who at Christ's coming shall be found to have believed. 
	do enter—that is, are
	to enter: so two of the oldest manuscripts and LUCIFER
	and the old Latin. Two other oldest manuscripts read, "Let
	us enter." 
	into rest—Greek,
	"into the rest" which is promised in the
	ninety-fifth Psalm. 
	as he said—God's saying
	that unbelief excludes from entrance implies that belief
	gains an entrance into the rest. What, however, Paul mainly here
	dwells on in the quotation is that the promised "rest"
	has not yet been entered into. At  :- he again, as in  :- already, takes up faith as the indispensable
	qualification for entering it. 
	although, c.—Although
	God had finished His works of creation and entered on His rest
	from creation long before Moses' time, yet under that leader of
	Israel another rest was promised, which most fell short of through
	unbelief and although the rest in Canaan was subsequently attained
	under Joshua, yet long after, in David's days, God, in the
	ninety-fifth Psalm, still speaks of the rest of God as not yet
	attained. THEREFORE, there
	must be meant a rest still future, namely, that which
	"remaineth for the people of God" in heaven,  :-, when they shall rest from their works, as God did from
	His, Hebrews 4:10. The argument is
	to show that by "My rest," God means a future rest, not for
	Himself, but for us.
finished—Greek,
	"brought into existence," "made."
