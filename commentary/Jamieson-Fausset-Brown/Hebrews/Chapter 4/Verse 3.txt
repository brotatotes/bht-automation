<p><b>as he said</b>—God's saying
	that <i>unbelief</i> excludes from entrance implies that <i>belief</i>
	gains an entrance into the rest. What, however, Paul mainly here
	dwells on in the quotation is that the promised "<i>rest</i>"
	has not <i>yet</i> been entered into. At <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> he again, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> already, takes up <i>faith</i> as the indispensable

<p><b>although,</b> c.—Although
	God had finished His works of creation and entered on <i>His</i> rest
	from creation long before Moses' time, yet under that leader of
	Israel another rest was promised, which most fell short of through
	unbelief and although the rest in Canaan was subsequently attained
	under Joshua, yet long after, in David's days, God, in the
	ninety-fifth Psalm, still speaks of <i>the rest of God</i> as not yet
	attained. THEREFORE, there
	must be meant a rest <i>still future,</i> namely, that which
	"remaineth for the people of God" in heaven, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, when they shall rest from their works, as God did from
	His, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:10">Hebrews 4:10</span>. The argument is
	to show that by "My rest," God means a future rest, not <i>for
	Himself,</i> but <i>for us.</i>
