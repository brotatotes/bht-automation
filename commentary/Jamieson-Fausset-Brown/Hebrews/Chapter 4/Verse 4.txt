<p><b>God did rest the seventh
	day</b>—a rest not ending with the seventh day, but beginning then
	and still continuing, into which believers shall hereafter enter.
	God's rest is not a rest necessitated by fatigue, nor consisting in
	idleness, but is that upholding and governing of which creation was
	the beginning [ALFORD].
	Hence Moses records the end of each of the first six days, but not of
	the seventh.

	God's "work" was <i>one,</i> comprehending, however, many
	"<i>works.</i>"</p>
