4. he spake—God ( :-). 
	God did rest the seventh
	day—a rest not ending with the seventh day, but beginning then
	and still continuing, into which believers shall hereafter enter.
	God's rest is not a rest necessitated by fatigue, nor consisting in
	idleness, but is that upholding and governing of which creation was
	the beginning [ALFORD].
	Hence Moses records the end of each of the first six days, but not of
	the seventh. 
	from all his works—Hebrew,
Genesis 2:2, "from all His work."
	God's "work" was one, comprehending, however, many
	"works."
