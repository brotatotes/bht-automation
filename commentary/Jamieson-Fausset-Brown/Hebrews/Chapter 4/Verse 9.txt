9. therefore—because God
	"speaks of another day" (see on  :-). 
	remaineth—still to be
	realized hereafter by the "some (who) must enter therein"
	(Hebrews 4:6), that is, "the
	people of God," the true Israel who shall enter into God's
	rest ("My rest," Hebrews 4:6- :). God's rest was a Sabbatism; so also will ours be. 
	a rest—Greek,
	"Sabbatism." In time there are many Sabbaths, but then
	there shall be the enjoyment and keeping of a Sabbath-rest: one
	perfect and eternal. The "rest" in Hebrews 4:6- : is Greek, "catapausis;" Hebrew,
	"Noah"; rest from weariness, as the ark rested on
	Ararat after its tossings to and fro; and as Israel, under Joshua,
	enjoyed at last rest from war in Canaan. But the "rest" in
	this Hebrews 4:9 is the nobler and
	more exalted (Hebrew) "Sabbath" rest;
	literally, "cessation": rest from work when finished
	(Hebrews 4:4), as God rested (Hebrews 4:4- :). The two ideas of "rest" combined, give the
	perfect view of the heavenly Sabbath. Rest from weariness, sorrow,
	and sin; and rest in the completion of God's new creation (Hebrews 4:4- :). The whole renovated creation shall share in it; nothing
	will there be to break the Sabbath of eternity; and the Triune God
	shall rejoice in the work of His hands (Hebrews 4:4- :). Moses, the representative of the law, could not lead
	Israel into Canaan: the law leads us to Christ, and there its office
	ceases, as that of Moses on the borders of Canaan: it is Jesus, the
	antitype of Joshua, who leads us into the heavenly rest. This verse
	indirectly establishes the obligation of the Sabbath still; for the
	type continues until the antitype supersedes it: so legal sacrifices
	continued till the great antitypical Sacrifice superseded it, As then
	the antitypical heavenly Sabbath-rest will not be till Christ, our
	Gospel Joshua, comes, to usher us into it, the typical earthly
	Sabbath must continue till then. The Jews call the future rest "the
	day which is all Sabbath."
