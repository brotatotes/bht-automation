<p><b>11.</b> Here he digresses to
	complain of the low spiritual attainments of the Palestinian
	Christians and to warn them of the danger of falling from light once
	enjoyed; at the same time encouraging them by God's faithfulness to
	persevere. At <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20">Hebrews 6:20</span> he
	resumes the comparison of Christ to Melchisedec.

	Hard for me to state intelligibly to you owing to your dulness about

	writes in comparatively <i>few words</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20- :">Hebrews 6:20- :</span>). In the "we," Paul, as usual, includes Timothy

	"ye have <i>become</i> dull" (the <i>Greek,</i> by
	derivation, means <i>hard to move</i>): this implies that <i>once,</i>
	when first "enlightened," they were earnest and zealous,
	but had <i>become</i> dull. That the Hebrew believers AT
	JERUSALEM were dull in
	spiritual things, and legal in spirit, appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20- :">Hebrews 6:20- :</span>, where James and the elders expressly say of the
	"thousands of Jews which believe," that "they are all
	<i>zealous of the law</i>"; this was at Paul's last visit to
	Jerusalem, after which this Epistle seems to have been written (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:12">Hebrews 5:12</span>, on "for the
