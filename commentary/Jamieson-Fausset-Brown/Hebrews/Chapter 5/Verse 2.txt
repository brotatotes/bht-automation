<p><b>2. Who can</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"being able"; <i>not pleasing himself</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>have compassion</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"estimate mildly," "feel leniently," or
	"moderately towards"; "to make allowance for";
	not showing stern rigor save to the obstinate (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>ignorant</b>—sins not
	committed in resistance of light and knowledge, but as Paul's past
	sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:13">1 Timothy 1:13</span>). No sacrifice
	was appointed for wilful sin committed with a high hand; for such
	were to be punished with death; all other sins, namely, ignorances
	and errors, were confessed and expiated with sacrifices by the high
	priest. 
	</p>
<p><b>out of the way</b>—not
	deliberately and altogether wilfully erring, but deluded through the
	fraud of Satan and their own carnal frailty and thoughtlessness. 
	</p>
<p><b>infirmity</b>—moral
	weakness which is sinful, and makes men capable of sin, and so
	requires to be expiated by sacrifices. This kind of "infirmity"
	Christ had not; He had the "infirmity" of body whereby He
	was capable of suffering and death.</p>
