2. Who can—Greek,
	"being able"; not pleasing himself ( :-). 
	have compassion—Greek,
	"estimate mildly," "feel leniently," or
	"moderately towards"; "to make allowance for";
	not showing stern rigor save to the obstinate ( :-). 
	ignorant—sins not
	committed in resistance of light and knowledge, but as Paul's past
	sin (1 Timothy 1:13). No sacrifice
	was appointed for wilful sin committed with a high hand; for such
	were to be punished with death; all other sins, namely, ignorances
	and errors, were confessed and expiated with sacrifices by the high
	priest. 
	out of the way—not
	deliberately and altogether wilfully erring, but deluded through the
	fraud of Satan and their own carnal frailty and thoughtlessness. 
	infirmity—moral
	weakness which is sinful, and makes men capable of sin, and so
	requires to be expiated by sacrifices. This kind of "infirmity"
	Christ had not; He had the "infirmity" of body whereby He
	was capable of suffering and death.
