	but Aaron's, according to the Mosaic law, can take to himself the
	office of high priest. This verse is quoted by some to prove the need
	of an apostolic succession of ordination in the Christian ministry;
	but the reference here is to the priesthood, not the Christian
	ministry. The analogy in our Christian dispensation would warn
	ministers, seeing that God has separated them from the congregation
	of His people to bring them near Himself, and to do the service of
	His house, and to minister (as He separated the Levites, Korah with
	his company), that content with this, they should beware of assuming
	the sacrificial priesthood also, which belongs to Christ alone. The
	sin of Korah was, not content with the ministry as a Levite, he took
	the sacerdotal priesthood also. No Christian minister, as such, is
	ever called Hiereus, that is, sacrificing priest. All
	Christians, without distinction, whether ministers or people, have a
	metaphorical, not a literal, priesthood. The sacrifices which they
	offer are spiritual, not literal, their bodies and the fruit of their
	lips, praises continually ( :-). Christ alone had a proper and true sacrifice to offer.
	The law sacrifices were typical, not metaphorical, as the
	Christian's, nor proper and true, as Christ's. In Roman times the
	Mosaic restriction of the priesthood to Aaron's family was violated.
