<p><b>5. glorified not himself</b>—did
	not assume the glory of the priestly office of Himself without the

<p><b>but he that said</b>—that
	is, the Father glorified Him or appointed Him to the priesthood. This
	appointment was involved in, and was the result of, the <i>Sonship</i>
	of Christ, which qualified Him for it. None but the divine Son could
	have fulfilled such an office (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:54- :">John 8:54- :</span>). The connection of <i>Sonship</i> and <i>priesthood</i>
	is typified in the <i>Hebrew</i> title for <i>priests</i> being given
	to David's sons (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+8:18">2 Samuel 8:18</span>).
	Christ did not constitute <i>Himself</i> the Son of God, but was from
	everlasting the only-begotten <i>of the Father.</i> On His Sonship
	depended His glorification, and His being called of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+8:18- :">2 Samuel 8:18- :</span>), as Priest.</p>
