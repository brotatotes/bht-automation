<p><b>6.</b> He is here called simply
	"Priest"; in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:5">Hebrews 5:5</span>,
	"High Priest." He is a <i>Priest</i> absolutely, because He
	stands alone in that character without an equal. He is "High
	Priest" in respect of the Aaronic type, and also in respect to
	us, whom He has made <i>priests</i> by throwing open to us access to
	God [BENGEL]. "The
	<i>order</i> of Melchisedec" is explained in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:5- :">Hebrews 5:5- :</span>, "the <i>similitude</i> of Melchisedec." The
	priesthood is similarly combined with His kingly office in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:5- :">Hebrews 5:5- :</span>. Melchisedec was at once man, priest, and king. Paul's
	selecting as the type of Christ one not of the stock of Abraham, on
	which the Jews prided themselves, is an intimation of Messianic
	universalism.</p>
