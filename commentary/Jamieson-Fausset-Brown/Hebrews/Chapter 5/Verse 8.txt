8. Though He WAS
	(so it ought to be translated: a positive admitted fact: not a mere
	supposition as were would imply) God's divine Son (whence,
	even in His agony, He so lovingly and often cried, Father,  :-), yet He learned His (so the Greek)
	obedience, not from His Sonship, but from His sufferings. As the Son,
	He was always obedient to the Father's will; but the special
	obedience needed to qualify Him as our High Priest, He learned
	experimentally in practical suffering. Compare  :-, "equal with God, but . . . took upon Him the
	form of a servant, and became obedient unto death,"
	&c. He was obedient already before His passion, but He
	stooped to a still more humiliating and trying form of obedience
	then. The Greek adage is, "Pathemata mathemata,"
	"sufferings, disciplinings." Praying and obeying,
	as in Christ's case, ought to go hand in hand.
