<p><b>8.</b> Though He WAS
	(so it ought to be translated: a positive admitted fact: not a mere
	supposition as <i>were</i> would imply) God's divine Son (whence,
	even in His agony, He so lovingly and often cried, <i>Father,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), yet He learned <i>His</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>)
	obedience, not from His Sonship, but from His sufferings. As the Son,
	He was always obedient to the Father's will; but <i>the</i> special
	obedience needed to qualify Him as our High Priest, He learned
	experimentally in practical suffering. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "<i>equal with God,</i> but . . . took upon Him the
	form of a <i>servant,</i> and became <i>obedient</i> unto death,"
	&amp;c. He was <i>obedient</i> already before His passion, but He
	stooped to a still more humiliating and trying form of <i>obedience</i>
	then. The <i>Greek</i> adage is, "<i>Pathemata mathemata,</i>"
	"sufferings, disciplinings." <i>Praying</i> and <i>obeying,</i>
	as in Christ's case, ought to go hand in hand.</p>
