1. Therefore—Wherefore: seeing
	that ye ought not now to be still "babes" ( :-). 
	leaving—getting further
	forward than the elementary "principles." "As in
	building a house one must never leave the foundation: yet to be
	always laboring in 'laying the foundation' would be ridiculous"

	the principles of the

	that is, the discussion of the "first principles of Christianity

	let us go on—Greek,
	"let us be borne forward," or "bear ourselves
	forward"; implying active exertion: press on. Paul, in teaching,
	here classifies himself with the Hebrew readers, or (as they ought to
	be) learners, and says, Let us together press forward. 
	perfection—the matured
	knowledge of those who are "of full age" (Hebrews 5:12- :) in Christian attainments. 
	foundation of—that is,
	consisting in "repentance." 
	repentance from dead
	works—namely, not springing from the vital principle of
	faith and love toward God, and so counted, like their doer, dead
	before God. This repentance from dead works is therefore
	paired with "faith toward God." The three pairs of truths
	enumerated are designedly such as JEWISH
	believers might in some degree have known from the Old Testament, but
	had been taught more clearly when they became Christians. This
	accounts for the omission of distinct specification of some
	essential first principle of Christian truth. Hence, too, he mentions
	"faith toward God," and not explicitly faith
	toward Christ (though of course included). Repentance and
	faith were the first principles taught under the Gospel.
