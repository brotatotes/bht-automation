<p><b>leaving</b>—getting further

<p><b>let us go on</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"let us be borne forward," or "bear ourselves
	forward"; implying active exertion: press on. Paul, in teaching,
	here classifies himself with the Hebrew readers, or (as they ought to
	be) learners, and says, Let us together press forward.

	</p>
<p><b>repentance from dead
	works</b>—namely, not springing from the <i>vital</i> principle of
	faith and love toward God, and so counted, like their doer, <i>dead</i>
	before God. This <i>repentance from dead works</i> is therefore
	paired with "faith toward God." The three pairs of truths
	enumerated are designedly such as JEWISH
	believers might in some degree have known from the Old Testament, but
	had been taught more clearly when they became Christians. This
	accounts for the omission of <i>distinct</i> specification of some
	essential first principle of Christian truth. Hence, too, he mentions
	"faith toward <i>God,</i>" and not <i>explicitly</i> faith
	toward <i>Christ</i> (though of course included). Repentance and
	faith were the first principles taught under the Gospel.</p>
