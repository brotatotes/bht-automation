10. not unrighteous—not
	unfaithful to His own gracious promise. Not that we have any
	inherent right to claim reward; for (1) a servant has
	no merit, as he only does that which is his bounden duty; (2) our
	best performances bear no proportion to what we leave undone; (3) all
	strength comes from God; but God has promised of His own grace
	to reward the good works of His people (already accepted through
	faith in Christ); it is His promise, not our merits, which

	your work—your whole
	Christian life of active obedience. 
	labour of love—The
	oldest manuscripts omit "labor of," which probably crept in
	from 1 Thessalonians 1:3. As "love"
	occurs here, so "hope," 1 Thessalonians 1:3- :, "faith," 1 Thessalonians 1:3- :; as in 1 Corinthians 13:13: the

	Hebrews 10:32-34).

	acts of love to the saints were done for His name's sake. The
	distressed condition of the Palestinian Christians appears from the
	collection for them. Though receiving bounty from other churches, and
	therefore not able to minister much by pecuniary help, yet
	those somewhat better off could minister to the greatest sufferers in
	their Church in various other ways (compare Hebrews 10:32-58.10.34- :). Paul, as elsewhere, gives them the utmost credit for their
	graces, while delicately hinting the need of perseverance, a lack of
	which had probably somewhat begun to show itself.
