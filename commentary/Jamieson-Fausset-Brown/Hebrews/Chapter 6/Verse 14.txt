<p><b>14. multiplying . . .
	multiply</b>—Hebraism for <i>superabundantly multiply.</i>
</p>
<p><b>thee</b>—The increase of
	Abraham's seed is virtually an increase of <i>himself.</i> The
	argument here refers to Abraham <i>himself</i> as an example;
	therefore Paul quotes <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:17">Genesis 22:17</span>,
	"thee," instead of "thy seed."</p>
