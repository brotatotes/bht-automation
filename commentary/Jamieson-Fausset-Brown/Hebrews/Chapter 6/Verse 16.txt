16. for confirmationâ€”not to be
	joined, as English Version, to "an oath"; but to "an
	end" [ALFORD]. I
	prefer, "The oath is to them, in respect to confirmation (of
	one's solemn promise or covenant; as here, God's), an end of
	all contradiction (so the Greek is translated,  :-), or "gainsaying." This passage shows: (1) an oath
	is sanctioned even in the Christian dispensation as lawful; (2) that
	the limits to its use are, that it only be employed where it can put
	an end to contradiction in disputes, and for confirmation
	of a solemn promise.
