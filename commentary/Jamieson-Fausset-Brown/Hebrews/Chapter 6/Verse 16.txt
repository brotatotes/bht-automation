<p><b>16. for confirmation</b>â€”not to be
	joined, as <i>English Version,</i> to "an oath"; but to "an
	end" [ALFORD]. I
	prefer, "The oath is to them, in respect to confirmation (of
	one's solemn promise or covenant; as here, <i>God's</i>), an end of
	all <i>contradiction</i> (so the <i>Greek</i> is translated, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), or "gainsaying." This passage shows: (1) an oath
	is sanctioned even in the Christian dispensation as lawful; (2) that
	the limits to its use are, that it only be employed where it can <i>put
	an end to contradiction in disputes,</i> and <i>for confirmation</i>
	of a solemn promise.</p>
