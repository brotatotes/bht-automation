<p><b>17. Wherein</b>—that is, <i>Which
	being the case</i> among men, God, in accommodation to their manner
	of confirming covenants, superadded to His sure <i>word</i> His <i>oath:</i>
	the "TWO immutable
	things" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18">Hebrews 6:18</span>).

<p><b>willing . . . counsel</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"willing . . . <i>will</i>"; words akin. Expressing the
	utmost benignity [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>more abundantly</b>—than
	had He not sworn. His word would have been amply enough; but, to make
	assurance doubly sure, He "interposed with an oath" (so the
	<i>Greek</i>). Literally, <i>He acted as Mediator,</i> coming between
	Himself and us; as if He were less, while He swears, than Himself by
	whom He swears (for the less among men usually swear by the greater).
	Dost thou not yet believe, thou that hearest the promise? [BENGEL].

<p><b>heirs of promise</b>—not
	only Abraham's literal, but also his spiritual, seed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:18- :">Hebrews 6:18- :</span>).</p>
