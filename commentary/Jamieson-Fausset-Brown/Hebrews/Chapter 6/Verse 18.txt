<p><b>impossible . . . to lie</b>—"<i>ever</i>
	to lie"; this is the force of the <i>Greek</i> aorist [ALFORD].
	His not being able to deny Himself is a proof, not of weakness, but
	of strength incomparable.

<p><b>fled for refuge</b>—as if
	from a shipwreck; or, as one fleeing to one of the six cities of
	refuge. Kadesh, that is, <i>holy,</i> implies the holiness of Jesus,
	our Refuge. Shechem, that is, <i>shoulder,</i> the government is upon
	his shoulder (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>). Hebron,
	that is, <i>fellowship,</i> believers are called into the fellowship
	of Christ. Bezer, that is, <i>a fortress,</i> Christ is so to all who
	trust in Him. Ramoth, that is, <i>high,</i> for Him hath God exalted
	with His right hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:31">Acts 5:31</span>).
	Golan, that is, <i>joy,</i> for in Him all the saints are justified
	and shall glory.

<p><b>set before us</b>—as a
	prize for which we strive; a new image, namely, the race course
