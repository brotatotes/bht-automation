<p><b>19.</b> <i>Hope</i> is found
	represented on coins by an <i>anchor.</i>
</p>
<p><b>sure and steadfast</b>—<i>sure</i>
	in respect to <i>us: steadfast,</i> or "firm" [ALFORD],
	in <i>itself.</i> Not such an <i>anchor</i> as will not keep the
	vessel from tossing, or an anchor unsound or too light [THEOPHYLACT].

<p><b>which entereth into that</b>—that
	is the place 
	</p>
<p><b>within the veil</b>—two
	images beautifully combined: (1) The <i>soul</i> is <i>the ship:</i>
	the <i>world</i> the <i>sea:</i> the <i>bliss beyond</i> the world,
	<i>the distant coast;</i> the <i>hope</i> resting on faith, the
	<i>anchor</i> which prevents the vessel being tossed to and fro; the
	<i>encouraging consolation</i> through the <i>promise</i> and <i>oath</i>
	of God, the cable connecting the ship and anchor. (2) The world is
	the fore-court: heaven, the Holy of Holies; Christ, the High Priest
	going before us, so as to enable us, after Him, and through Him, to
	enter within the veil. ESTIUS
	explains, As the anchor does not stay in the waters, but enters the
	ground hidden beneath the waters, and fastens itself in it, so hope,
	our anchor of the soul, is not satisfied with merely coming to the
	vestibule, that is, is not content with merely earthly and visible
	goods, but penetrates even to those which are within the veil,
	namely, to the Holy of Holies, where it lays hold on God Himself, and
	heavenly goods, and fastens on them. "Hope, entering within
	heaven, hath made us already to be in the things promised to us, even
	while we are still below, and have not yet received them; such
	strength hope has, as to make those that are earthly to become
	heavenly." "The soul clings, as one in fear of shipwreck to
	an anchor, and sees not whither the cable of the anchor runs—where
	it is fastened: but she knows that it is fastened behind the veil
	which hides the future glory."

<p><b>veil</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>catapetasma</i>": the <i>second</i> veil which shut in
	the Holiest Place. The outer veil was called by a distinct <i>Greek</i>
	term, <i>calumma:</i> "the second (that is, the inner) veil."</p>
