	Christian baptism, and answers to the rite of confirmation in

	from Jewish baptismal purifications ( :-, "washings"), baptism of proselytes, and John's
	baptism, and legal imposition of hands, to their Christian analogues,
	baptism, and the subsequent laying on of hands,
	accompanied by the gift of the Holy Ghost (compare  :-). Greek, "baptismoi," plural,
	including Jewish and Christian baptisms, are to be

	Jews who had begun to recognize Jesus as the Christ immediately on
	the new light being shed on these fundamental particulars, were
	accounted as having the elementary principles of the doctrine
	of Christ [BENGEL]. The
	first and most obvious elementary instruction of Jews would be the
	teaching them the typical significance of their own ceremonial
