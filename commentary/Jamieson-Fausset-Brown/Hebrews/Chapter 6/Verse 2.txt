	with "laying on of hands," as the latter followed on
	Christian baptism, and answers to the rite of <i>confirmation</i> in
	Episcopal churches. Jewish believers passed, by an easy transition,
	from Jewish <i>baptismal purifications</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "washings"), baptism of proselytes, and John's
	baptism, and legal imposition of hands, to their Christian analogues,
	<i>baptism,</i> and the subsequent <i>laying on of hands,</i>
	accompanied by the gift of the Holy Ghost (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>Greek,</i> "<i>baptismoi,</i>" plural,
	including <i>Jewish</i> and <i>Christian baptisms,</i> are to be
	distinguished from <i>baptisma,</i> singular, <i>restricted</i> to
	Christian baptism. The six particulars here specified had been, as it
	were, <i>the Christian Catechism</i> of the Old Testament; and such
	Jews who had begun to recognize Jesus as the Christ immediately on
	the new light being shed on these fundamental particulars, were
	accounted as having the elementary <i>principles</i> of the doctrine
	of Christ [BENGEL]. The
	first and most obvious elementary instruction of Jews would be the
	<i>teaching</i> them the typical significance of their own ceremonial
	law in its Christian fulfilment [ALFORD].
