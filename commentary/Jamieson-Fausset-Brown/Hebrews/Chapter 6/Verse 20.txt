<p><b>20.</b> The absence of the <i>Greek</i>
	article requires ALFORD'S
	translation, "Where. As forerunner for us (that is, in our
	behalf), entered Jesus" [<i>and is now:</i> this last clause is
	implied in the 'where' of the <i>Greek,</i> which implies being IN
	a place: 'whither' is understood to 'entered,' taken out of 'where';
	whither <i>Jesus entered,</i> and <i>where</i> He is now]. The "for
	us" implies that it was not for Himself, as God, He needed to
	enter there, but as our High Priest, representing and introducing us,
	His followers, opening the way to us, by His intercession with the
	Father, as the Aaronic high priest entered the Holiest Place once a
	year to make propitiation for the people. The first-fruits of our
	nature are ascended, and so the rest is sanctified. Christ's
	ascension is our promotion: and whither the glory of the Head has
	preceded, thither the hope of the body, too, is called. We ought to
	keep festal day, since Christ has taken up and set in the heavens the
	first-fruit of our lump, that is, the human flesh [CHRYSOSTOM].
	As John Baptist was Christ's forerunner on earth, so Christ is ours
	in heaven.</p>
