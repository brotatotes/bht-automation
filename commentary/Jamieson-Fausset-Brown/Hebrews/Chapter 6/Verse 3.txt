<p><b>3. will we do</b>—So some of the
	oldest manuscripts read; but others, "Let us do." "This,"
	that is, "Go on unto perfection." 
	</p>
<p><b>if God permit</b>—For even
	in the case of good resolutions, we cannot carry them into effect,
	save through God "working in us both to will and to do of His
	good pleasure" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span>).
	The "for" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:4">Hebrews 6:4</span>
	refers to this: I say, if God permit, <i>for</i> there are cases
	where God does not permit, for example, "it is impossible,"
	&amp;c. Without God's blessing, the cultivation of the ground does
	not succeed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:7">Hebrews 6:7</span>).</p>
