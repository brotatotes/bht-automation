3. will we do—So some of the
	oldest manuscripts read; but others, "Let us do." "This,"
	that is, "Go on unto perfection." 
	if God permit—For even
	in the case of good resolutions, we cannot carry them into effect,
	save through God "working in us both to will and to do of His
	good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13).
	The "for" in Hebrews 6:4
	refers to this: I say, if God permit, for there are cases
	where God does not permit, for example, "it is impossible,"
	&c. Without God's blessing, the cultivation of the ground does
	not succeed (Hebrews 6:7).
