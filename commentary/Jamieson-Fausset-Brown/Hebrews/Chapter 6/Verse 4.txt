<p><b>4.</b> We must "go on toward
	perfection"; for if we <i>fall away,</i> after having received
	enlightenment, it will be <i>impossible to renew</i> us <i>again to
	repentance.</i>
</p>
<p><b>for those</b>—"in the
	case of those." 
	</p>
<p><b>once enlightened</b>—once
	for all illuminated by the word of God taught in connection with
	"baptism" (to which, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, as once for all done," once enlightened" here
	answers); compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:26">Ephesians 5:26</span>.
	This passage probably originated the application of the term
	"illumination" to baptism in subsequent times.
	<i>Illumination,</i> however, was not supposed to be the inseparable
	accompaniment of <i>baptism:</i> thus CHRYSOSTOM
	says, "Heretics have <i>baptism,</i> not <i>illumination:</i>
	they are baptized in body, but not enlightened in soul: as Simon
	Magus was baptized, but not illuminated." That "enlightened"
	here means <i>knowledge of the word of truth,</i> appears from
	comparing the same <i>Greek</i> word "illuminated," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:32">Hebrews 10:32</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:26">Hebrews 10:26</span>, where "knowledge
	of the truth" answers to it. 
	</p>
<p><b>tasted of the heavenly
	gift</b>—tasted <i>for themselves.</i> As "enlightened"
	refers to the sense of <i>sight:</i> so here <i>taste</i> follows.
	"The heavenly gift"; <i>Christ</i> given by the Father and
	revealed by the enlightening word preached and written: as conferring
	peace in the remission of sins; and as the Bestower of the gift of
	the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:19">Acts 8:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:20">Acts 8:20</span>), 
	</p>
<p><b>made partakers of the Holy
	Ghost</b>—specified as distinct from, though so inseparably
	connected with, "enlightened," and "tasted of the
	heavenly gift," Christ, as answering to "laying on of
	hands" after baptism, which was then generally accompanied with
	the impartation of <i>the Holy Ghost</i> in miraculous <i>gifts.</i></p>
