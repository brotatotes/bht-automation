<p><b>7. the earth</b>—rather as <i>Greek</i>
	(no article), "land." 
	</p>
<p><b>which drinketh in</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"which <i>has</i> drunk in"; not merely receiving it on the
	surface. Answering to those who have enjoyed the privilege of
	Christian experiences, being in some sense renewed by the Holy Ghost;
	true alike of those who persevere and those who "fall away."
	</p>
<p><b>the rain that cometh oft upon
	it</b>—not merely failing <i>over</i> it, or <i>towards</i> it, but
	falling and resting <i>upon</i> it so as to <i>cover</i> it (the
	<i>Greek</i> genitive, not the accusative). The "oft"
	implies, on God's part, the riches of His abounding grace ("coming"
	spontaneously, and often); and, on the apostate's part, the wilful
	perversity whereby he has done continual despite to the oft-repeated
	motions of the Spirit. Compare "How <i>often,</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The rain of heaven falls both on the elect and the
	apostates. 
	</p>
<p><b>bringeth forth</b>—as the
	<i>natural</i> result of "<i>having drunk in</i> the rain."
	See above. 
	</p>
<p><b>herbs</b>—provender. 
	</p>
<p><b>meet</b>—fit. Such as the
	master of the soil wishes. The opposite of "rejected," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>by whom</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "for (that is, on account of) whom," namely,
	the lords of the soil; not the laborers, as <i>English Version,</i>
	namely, God and His Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The heart of man is the earth; man is the dresser; herbs
	are brought forth meet, not for the dresser, by whom, but for God,
	the owner of the soil, for whom it is dressed. The plural is general,
	<i>the owners whoever they may be;</i> here <i>God.</i>
</p>
<p><b>receiveth</b>—"partaketh
	of." 
	</p>
<p><b>blessing</b>—fruitfulness.
	Contrast God's curse causing unfruitfulness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:17">Genesis 3:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:18">Genesis 3:18</span>); also spiritually (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:18- :">Genesis 3:18- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>from God</b>—Man's use of
	means is vain unless God bless (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:7">1 Corinthians 3:7</span>).</p>
