<p><b>9. beloved</b>—appositely here
	introduced; LOVE to you
	prompts me in the strong warnings I have just given, not that I
	entertain unfavorable thoughts of you; nay, I anticipate <i>better
	things</i> of you; <i>Greek</i> "<i>the</i> things which are
	better"; that ye are not <i>thorn-bearing,</i> or <i>nigh unto
	cursing,</i> and doomed <i>unto burning,</i> but heirs of <i>salvation</i>
	in accordance with God's faithfulness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>we are persuaded</b>—on
	good grounds; the result of proof. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "I myself am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye
	are full of <i>goodness.</i>" A confirmation of the Pauline
	authorship of this Epistle. 
	</p>
<p><b>things that accompany</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"things that hold by," that is, are close unto "salvation."
	Things that are linked unto salvation (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). In opposition to "nigh unto cursing." 
	</p>
<p><b>though</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"if even we thus speak." "For it is better to make you
	afraid with words, that ye may not suffer in fact."</p>
