<p><b>1. this Melchisedec</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+6:20">Hebrews 6:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:4">Psalms 110:4</span>). The verb does not
	come till <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:3">Hebrews 7:3</span>, "abideth."
	</p>
<p><b>king . . . priest</b>—Christ
	unites these offices in their highest sense, and so restores the
	patriarchal union of these offices. 
	</p>
<p><b>Salem</b>—Jerusalem, that
	is, <i>seeing peace;</i> others make Salem distinct, and to be that
	mentioned (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+33:18">Genesis 33:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:23">John 3:23</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>the most high God</b>—called
	also "Possessor of heaven and earth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:19">Genesis 14:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:22">Genesis 14:22</span>). This title of God,
	"the Most High," handed down by tradition from the
	primitive revelation, appears in the Phoelignician god "Elion,"
	that is, <i>Most High.</i> It is used to imply that the God whom
	Melchisedec served is THE TRUE GOD,
	and not one of the gods of the nations around. So it is used in the
	only other cases in which it is found in the New Testament, namely in
	the address of the demoniac, and the divining damsel constrained to
	confess that her own gods were false, and God the only true God. 
	</p>
<p><b>who met Abraham</b>—in
	company with the king of Sodom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:17">Genesis 14:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:18">Genesis 14:18</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>slaughter</b>—perhaps
	<i>defeat,</i> as ALFORD
	translates. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:17">Genesis 14:17</span>
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:15">Genesis 14:15</span>) may be
	translated. Arioch, king of Ellasar, lived and reigned after the
	disaster [BENGEL].
	However, if Chedorlaomer and Amraphel and Tidal were slain, though
	Arioch survived, "<i>slaughter</i> of the kings" would be
	correct. 
	</p>
<p><b>blessed him</b>—As priest
	he first blessed Abraham on God's part; next he blessed God on
	Abraham's part: a reciprocal blessing. Not a mere wish, but an
	authoritative and efficacious intercession as a priest. The Most High
	God's prerogative as "Possessor of heaven and earth," is
	made over to Abraham; and Abraham's glory, from his victory over the
	foe, is made over to God. A blessed exchange for Abraham (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:19">Genesis 14:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+14:20">Genesis 14:20</span>).</p>
