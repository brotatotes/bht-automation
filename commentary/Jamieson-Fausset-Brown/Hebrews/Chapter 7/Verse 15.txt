<p><b>15.</b> Another proof that the law,
	or economy, is changed, namely, forasmuch as Christ is appointed
	Priest, "not according to the law of a carnal (that is, a mere
	<i>outward</i>) commandment," but "according to the power
	of an <i>indissoluble</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>) life." The
	hundred tenth Psalm appoints Him "for ever" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The Levitical law required a <i>definite carnal</i>
	descent. In contrast stands "the power"; Christ's
	spiritual, inward, living power of overcoming death. Not agreeably to
	a <i>statute</i> is Christ appointed, but according to an inward
	<i>living power.</i>

	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:10">Hebrews 5:10</span>). The "order"
	cannot mean a <i>series of priests,</i> for Melchisedec neither
	received his priesthood from, nor transmitted it to, any other mere
	man; it must mean "answering to the <i>office</i> of
	Melchisedec." Christ's priesthood is similar to Melchisedec's in
	that it is "for ever" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:16">Hebrews 7:16</span>;
