<p><b>16. carnal . . . endless</b>â€”mutually
	contrasted. As "form" and "power" are opposed,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:5">2 Timothy 3:5</span>; so here "the law"
	and "power," compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+3:5- :">2 Timothy 3:5- :</span>, "The law was <i>weak</i> through the flesh"; and
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18">Hebrews 7:18</span>, "weakness."
	"The law" is here not the law in general, but the <i>statute</i>
	as to the priesthood. "Carnal," as being only <i>outward
	and temporary,</i> is contrasted with "endless," or, as
	<i>Greek,</i> "indissoluble." Commandments is contrasted
	with "life." The <i>law</i> can give a <i>commandment,</i>
	but it cannot give <i>life</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18- :">Hebrews 7:18- :</span>). But our High Priest's inherent "power," now in
	heaven, has in Him "life for ever"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18- :">Hebrews 7:18- :</span>, "through the <i>eternal Spirit</i>"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18- :">Hebrews 7:18- :</span>, "able . . . ever liveth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18- :">Hebrews 7:18- :</span>). It is in the power of His resurrection life, not of His
	earthly life, that Christ officiates as a Priest.</p>
