	sanctification before God, which is the "perfection" that
	we all need in order to be accepted of Him, and which we have in
	Christ.

<p><b>nothing</b>—not merely "no

	perfected end everything in it was introductory to its antitype in

	the other) a bringing in <i>afterwards</i> (the <i>Greek</i>

	the law; a <i>superinducing,</i> or <i>accession of something new,</i>
	namely, something better than the good things which the pre-existing
	law promised [WAHL]) of a
	better hope," not one weak and unprofitable, but, as elsewhere
	the Christian dispensation is called, "everlasting,"
	"true," "the second," "more excellent,"
	"different," "living," "new," "to
	come," "perfect." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:18- :">Hebrews 7:18- :</span>, bringing us <i>near to God,</i> now in spirit, hereafter

<p><b>we draw nigh unto God</b>—the
	sure token of "perfection." <i>Weakness</i> is the opposite
	of this filial confidence of access. The access through the legal
	sacrifices was only symbolical and through the medium of a priest;
	that through Christ is immediate, perfect, and spiritual.</p>
