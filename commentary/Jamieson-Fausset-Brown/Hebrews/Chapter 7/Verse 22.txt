	person the certainty of the covenant to us. This He did by becoming
	responsible for our guilt, by sealing the covenant with His blood,
	and by being openly acknowledged as our triumphant Saviour by the
	Father, who raised Him from the dead. Thus He is at once God's surety
	for man, and man's surety for God, and so Mediator between God and
	man (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:6">Hebrews 8:6</span>).

	of somewhat concerning that second party; a last will or testament,
