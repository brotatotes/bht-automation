<p><b>24. he</b>—emphatic; <i>Greek,</i>
	"Himself." So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "THOU art
	a <i>priest</i>"; singular, not <i>priests,</i> "many."

<p><b>continueth</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	simple verb, not the compound as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. "Remaineth," namely, <i>in life.</i>
</p>
<p><b>unchangeable</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"hath His priesthood unchangeable"; <i>not passing from one
	to another, intransmissible.</i> Therefore no earthly so-called
	apostolic succession of priests are His vicegerents. The Jewish
	priests had <i>successors</i> in office, because "they could not
	continue by reason of death." But this Man, because He liveth
	ever, hath no successor in office, not even Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
