24. he—emphatic; Greek,
	"Himself." So in  :-, "THOU art
	a priest"; singular, not priests, "many."
	continueth—Greek,
	simple verb, not the compound as in  :-. "Remaineth," namely, in life.
unchangeable—Greek,
	"hath His priesthood unchangeable"; not passing from one
	to another, intransmissible. Therefore no earthly so-called
	apostolic succession of priests are His vicegerents. The Jewish
	priests had successors in office, because "they could not
	continue by reason of death." But this Man, because He liveth
	ever, hath no successor in office, not even Peter ( :-).
