<p><b>26. such</b>—as is above
	described. The oldest manuscripts read, "also." "For
	to US (as <i>sinners;</i>
	emphatical) there was also becoming (besides the other excellencies
	of our High Priest) such an High Priest." 
	</p>
<p><b>holy</b>—"pious"
	(a distinct <i>Greek</i> word from that for <i>holy,</i> which latter
	implies <i>consecration</i>) towards <i>God;</i> perfectly answering
	God's will in reverent piety (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>harmless</b>—literally,
	"free from evil" and guile, in relation to <i>Himself.</i>
</p>
<p><b>undefiled</b>—not defiled
	by stain contracted from others, in relation to <i>men.</i>
	Temptation, to which He was exposed, left no trace of evil in Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>separate</b>—rather,
	"<i>separated</i> from sinners," namely, in His heavenly
	state as our High Priest above, after He had been <i>parted from the
	earth,</i> as the Levitical high priest was separated from the people
	in the sanctuary (whence he was not to go out), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Though justifying through faith the ungodly, He hath no
	contact with them <i>as such.</i> He is lifted above our sinful
	community, being "made higher than the heavens," at the
	same time that He makes believers <i>as such</i> (not as sinners),
	"to sit together (with Him) in heavenly places" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Just as Moses <i>on the mount</i> was separated from and
	above the people, and alone with God. This proves Jesus is GOD.
	"Though innumerable lies have been forged against the venerable
	Jesus, none dared to charge Him with any intemperance" [ORIGEN].
	</p>
<p><b>made</b>—Jesus was higher
	before (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>), and as the
	<i>God</i>-MAN was <i>made</i>
	so by the Father after His humiliation (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5- :">John 17:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>higher than the heavens</b>—for
	"He passed <i>through</i> [so the <i>Greek</i>] the heavens"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span>).</p>
