<p><b>27. daily</b>—"day by day."
	The priests <i>daily</i> offered sacrifices (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:6">Hebrews 9:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:11">Hebrews 10:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:38-42">Exodus 29:38-42</span>).
	The high priests took part in these daily-offered sacrifices only on
	festival days; but as they represented the whole priesthood, the
	daily offerings are here attributed to them; their exclusive function
	was to offer the atonement "once every year" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:38-2.29.42- :">Exodus 29:38-2.29.42- :</span>), and "year by year continually" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+29:38-2.29.42- :">Exodus 29:38-2.29.42- :</span>). The "daily" strictly belongs to <i>Christ,</i>
	not to the high priests, "who needeth not daily, as those high
	priests (<i>year by year,</i> and their subordinate priests daily),
	to offer," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>offer up</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	term is peculiarly used of <i>sacrifices for sin.</i> The high
	priest's double offering on the day of atonement, the bullock for
	himself, and the goat for the people's sins, had its counterpart in
	the TWO lambs offered
	daily by the ordinary priests. 
	</p>
<p><b>this he did</b>—not "died
	first for His own sins and then the people's," but <i>for the
	people's only.</i> The negation is twofold: He needeth not to offer
	(1) daily nor (2) to offer for His own sins also; for He offered
	Himself a spotless sacrifice (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:15">Hebrews 4:15</span>). The sinless alone
	could offer for the sinful. 
	</p>
<p><b>once</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"once for all." The sufficiency of the <i>one</i> sacrifice
	to atone for <i>all</i> sins <i>for ever,</i> resulted from its
	absolute spotlessness.</p>
