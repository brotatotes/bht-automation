<p><b>6. he whose descent is not counted
	from them</b>—not from "the sons of Levi," as those "who
	receive the priesthood." This verse explains "without
	descent" (<i>Greek,</i> "genealogy" in both verses,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:3">Hebrews 7:3</span>). He who needs not, as

<p><b>received</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>hath</i> received tithes."

<p><b>him that had</b>—"the
	possessor of the promises," Abraham's peculiar distinction and
	designation. Paul exalts Abraham in order still more to exalt
	Melchisedec. When Christ is the subject, the singular "promise"
	is used. "The promises" in the plural, refer to God's
	promise of greatness to himself and his seed, and of the possession
	of Canaan, twice repeated before the blessing of Melchisedec. As the
	priests, though above the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:3- :">Hebrews 7:3- :</span>) whom it was their duty to "bless," were yet
	subordinate to Abraham; and as Abraham was subordinate to
	Melchisedec, who blessed him, Melchisedec must be much above the
	Levitical priests.</p>
