<p><b>8.</b> Second point of superiority:
	Melchisedec's is an <i>enduring,</i> the Levitical a <i>transitory,</i>
	priesthood. As the law was a <i>parenthesis</i> between Abraham's
	dispensation of promise of grace, and its enduring fulfilment at
	Christ's coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:20">Romans 5:20</span>,
	<i>Greek,</i> "The law entered as something adscititious and by
	the way"): so the Levitical priesthood was parenthetical and
	temporary, between Melchisedec's typically enduring priesthood, and
	its antitypical realization in our ever continuing High Priest,
	Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>here</b>—in the <i>Levitical</i>
	priesthood. 
	</p>
<p><b>there</b>—in the priesthood
	<i>after the order of Melchisedec.</i> In order to bring out the
	typical parallel more strongly, Paul substitutes, "He of whom it
	is witnessed that he liveth," for the more untypical, "He
	<i>who is made like to Him</i> that liveth." Melchisedec
	"liveth" merely in his <i>official</i> capacity, his
	priesthood being continued in Christ. Christ, on the other hand, is,
	in <i>His own person,</i> "ever living after the power of an
	endless life" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:16">Hebrews 7:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>). Melchisedec's death
	not being recorded, is expressed by the positive term "liveth,"
	for the sake of bringing into prominence the antitype, Christ, of
	whom alone it is strictly and perfectly true, "that He liveth."</p>
