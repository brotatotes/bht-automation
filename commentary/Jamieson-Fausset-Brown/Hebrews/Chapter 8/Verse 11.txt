11. Second of the "better
	promises" (Hebrews 8:6). 
	they shall not—"they
	shall not have to teach" [ALFORD].
	his neighbour—So
	Vulgate reads; but the oldest manuscripts have "his

from the least to the
	greatest—Greek, "from the little one to the great
	one." Zechariah 12:8, "He
	that is feeble among them shall be as David." Under the old
	covenant, the priest's lips were to keep knowledge, and at his mouth
	the people were to seek the law: under the new covenant, the Holy
	Spirit teaches every believer. Not that the mutual teaching of
	brethren is excluded while the covenant is being promulgated; but
	when once the Holy Spirit shall have fully taught all the remission
	of their sins and inward sanctification, then there shall be no
	further' need of man teaching his fellow man. Compare 1 Thessalonians 4:9;
	1 Thessalonians 5:1, an earnest of that
	perfect state to come. On the way to that perfect state every man
	should teach his neighbor. "The teaching is not hard and forced,
	because grace renders all teachable; for it is not the ministry of
	the letter, but of the spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:1- :). The believer's firmness does not depend on the authority
	of human teachers. God Himself teaches" [BENGEL].
	The New Testament is shorter than the Old Testament, because, instead
	of the details of an outward letter law, it gives the
	all-embracing principles of the spiritual law written on the
	conscience, leading one to spontaneous instinctive obedience in
	outward details. None save the Lord can teach effectually, "know
	the Lord."
