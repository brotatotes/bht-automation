<p><b>13. he</b>—God.

<p><b>made . . . old</b>—"hath
	(at the time of speaking the prophecy) antiquated the first
	covenant." From the time of God's mention of a NEW
	covenant (since God's words are all realities) the first covenant
	might be regarded as ever dwindling away, until its complete
	abolition on the actual introduction of the Gospel. Both covenants
	cannot exist side by side. Mark how verbal inspiration is proved in
	Paul's argument turning wholly on the one word "NEW"
	(covenant), occurring but once in the Old Testament.

<p><b>that which decayeth</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"that which is being antiquated," namely, at the time when
	Jeremiah spake. For in Paul's time, according to his view, the new
	had absolutely set aside the old covenant. The <i>Greek</i> for
	(<i>Kaine</i>) <i>New</i> (Testament) implies that it is <i>of a
	different kind</i> and <i>supersedes the old:</i> not merely <i>recent</i>
	(<i>Greek,</i> "<i>nea</i>"). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+3:4">Hosea 3:4</span>;
