<p><b>the true</b>—the archetypal
	and antitypical, as contrasted with the typical and symbolical (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>Greek</i> "<i>alethinos</i>" (used here) is
	opposed to that which does not fulfil its idea, as for instance, <i>a
	type;</i> "<i>alethes,</i>" to that which is untrue and
	unreal, as a lie. The measure of <i>alethes</i> is reality; that of
	<i>alethinos,</i> ideality. In <i>alethes</i> the idea corresponds to
	the thing; in <i>alethinos,</i> the thing to the idea [KALMIS
	in ALFORD].

<p><b>tabernacle</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>His body.</i> Through His glorified body as the
	tabernacle, Christ passes into the heavenly "Holy of Holies,"
	the immediate immaterial presence of God, where He intercedes for us.
	This tabernacle in which God dwells, is where God in Christ meets us
	who are "members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones."
	This tabernacle answers to the heavenly Jerusalem, where God's
	<i>visible</i> presence is to be manifested to His perfected saints
	and angels, who are united in Christ the Head; in contradistinction
	to His personal <i>invisible</i> presence in the Holy of Holies
	unapproachable save to Christ. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Word . . . dwelt among us," <i>Greek,</i>
