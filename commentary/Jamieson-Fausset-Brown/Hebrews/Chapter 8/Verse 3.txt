<p><b>somewhat</b>—He does not
	offer again His <i>once for all</i> completed sacrifice. But as the
	high priest did <i>not</i> enter the Holy Place <i>without blood,</i>
	so Christ has entered the heavenly Holy Place <i>with His own blood.</i>
	That "blood of sprinkling" is in heaven. And is thence made
	effectual to sprinkle believers as the end of their election (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The term "consecrate" as a priest, is literally,
	to <i>fill the hand,</i> implying that an offering is given into the
	hands of the priest, which it is his duty to present to God. If a man
	be a priest, he must have some gift in his hands to offer. Therefore,
	Christ, as a priest, has His blood as His oblation to offer before
	God.</p>
