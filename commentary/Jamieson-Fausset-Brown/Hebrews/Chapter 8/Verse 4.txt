4. Implying that Christ's
	priestly office is exercised in heaven, not in earth; in the power of
	His resurrection life, not of His earthly life. 
	For—The oldest
	manuscripts read, "accordingly then." 
	if, c.—"if He were
	on earth, He would not even (so the Greek) be a priest"
	(compare Hebrews 7:13 Hebrews 7:14);
	therefore, certainly, He could not exercise the high priestly
	function in the earthly Holy of Holies. 
	seeing that, c.—"since
	there are" already, and exist now (the temple service not yet
	being set aside, as it was on the destruction of Jerusalem), "those
	(the oldest manuscripts omit 'priests') who offer the
	(appointed) gifts according to (the) law." Therefore, His
	sacerdotal "ministry" must be "in
	the heavens," not on earth (Hebrews 7:14- :). "If His priesthood terminated on the earth, He would
	not even be a priest at all" [BENGEL].
	I conceive that the denial here of Christ's priesthood on earth
	does not extend to the sacrifice on the cross which He offered as
	a priest on earth but applies only to the crowning work of His
	priesthood, the bringing of the blood into the Holy of Holies,
	which He could not have done in the earthly Holy of Holies, as
	not being an Aaronic priest. The place (the heavenly Holy of
	Holies) was as essential to the atonement being made as the oblation
	(the blood). The body was burnt without the gate; but the
	sanctification was effected by the presentation of the blood within
	the sanctuary by the high priest. If on earth, He would not be a
	priest in the sense of the law of Moses ("according to
	the law" is emphatic).
