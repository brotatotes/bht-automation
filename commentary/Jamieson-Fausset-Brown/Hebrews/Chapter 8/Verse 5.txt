<p><b>5. Who</b>—namely, the priests. 
	</p>
<p><b>serve unto the example</b>—not
	"<i>after</i> the example," as BENGEL
	explains. But as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:10">Hebrews 13:10</span>,
	"serve the tabernacle," that is, do it service: so "serve
	(the tabernacle which is but) <i>the outline</i> and shadow."
	The <i>Greek</i> for "example" is here taken for the
	<i>sketch, copy,</i> or <i>suggestive representation</i> of the
	heavenly sanctuary, which is the antitypical reality and primary
	archetype. "The mount" answers to <i>heaven,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:10- :">Hebrews 13:10- :</span>.

	especially applies to <i>divine responses</i> and <i>commands.</i>

<p><b>to make</b>—"perfectly":
	so the <i>Greek.</i>

<p><b>See</b>—Take heed,
	accurately observing the pattern, that so thou mayest make, c.

<p><b>saith he</b>—God.

<p><b>the pattern</b>—an accurate
	representation, presented in vision to Moses, of the heavenly real
	sanctuary. Thus the earthly tabernacle was copy of a copy but the
	latter accurately representing the grand archetypical original in
	heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:40">Exodus 25:40</span>).</p>
