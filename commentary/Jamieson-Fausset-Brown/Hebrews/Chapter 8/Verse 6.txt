	The Old Testament promises were mainly of earthly, the New Testament
	promises, of heavenly blessings: the exact fulfilment of the earthly
	promises was a pledge of the fulfilment of the heavenly. "Like a
	physician who prescribes a certain diet to a patient, and then when
	the patient is beginning to recover, changes the diet, permitting
	what he had before forbidden; or as a teacher gives his pupil an
	elementary lesson at first; preparatory to leading him to a higher
	stage": so Rabbi Albo in his <i>Ikkarim.</i> Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:21">Jeremiah 7:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+7:22">Jeremiah 7:22</span>, which shows that God's
	original design in the old covenant ritual system was, that it should
	be pedagogical, as a schoolmaster leading and preparing men for
	Christ.</p>
