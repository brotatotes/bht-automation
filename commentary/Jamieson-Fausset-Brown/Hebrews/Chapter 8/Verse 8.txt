	headquarters of Nebuzar-adan, whither the captives of Jerusalem had
	been led, Jeremiah uttered this prophecy of Israel's restoration
	under another David, whereby Rachel, wailing for her lost children,
	shall be comforted; literally in part fulfilled at the restoration
	under Zerubbabel, and more fully to be hereafter at Israel's return
	to their own land; spiritually fulfilled in the Gospel covenant,
	whereby God forgives absolutely His people's sins, and writes His law
	by His Spirit on the hearts of believers, the true Israel. "This
	prophecy forms the third part of the third trilogy of the three great
	trilogies into which Jeremiah's prophecies may be divided: Jeremiah
	21-25, against the shepherds of the people; Jeremiah 26-29, against
	the false prophets; Jeremiah 30 and 31, the book of restoration"
