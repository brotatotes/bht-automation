	headquarters of Nebuzar-adan, whither the captives of Jerusalem had
	been led, Jeremiah uttered this prophecy of Israel's restoration
	under another David, whereby Rachel, wailing for her lost children,

	prophecy forms the third part of the third trilogy of the three great
	trilogies into which Jeremiah's prophecies may be divided: Jeremiah
	21-25, against the shepherds of the people; Jeremiah 26-29, against
	the false prophets; Jeremiah 30 and 31, the book of restoration"

	shared the exile, so both shall share the literal and spiritual
	restoration.
