9. Not according to, c.—very
	different from, and far superior to, the old covenant, which only
	"worked wrath" (Romans 4:15)
	through man's "not regarding" it. The new covenant enables
	us to obey by the Spirit's inward impulse producing love because of
	the forgiveness of our sins. 
	made with—rather as
	Greek, "made to": the Israelites being only
	recipients, not coagents [ALFORD]
	with God. 
	I took them by the hand—as
	a father takes his child by the hand to support and guide his steps.
	"There are three periods: (1) that of the promise (2) that of
	the pedagogical instruction; (3) that of fulfilment" [BENGEL].
	The second, that of the pedagogical pupilage, began at the exodus
	from Egypt. 
	I regarded them not—English
	Version, Jeremiah 31:32,
	translates, "Although I was an husband unto them."
	Paul's translation here is supported by the Septuagint, Syriac,
	and GESENIUS, and accords
	with the kindred Arabic. The Hebrews regarded not God,
	so God, in righteous retribution, regarded them not. On
	"continued not in my covenant," Schelling observes: The law
	was in fact the mere ideal of a religious constitution: in
	practice, the Jews were throughout, before the captivity, more
	or less polytheists, except in the time of David, and the first years
	of Solomon (the type of Messiah's reign). Even after the return from
	Babylon, idolatry was succeeded by what was not much better,
	formalism and hypocrisy (Jeremiah 31:32- :). The law was (1) a typical picture, tracing out the
	features of the glorious Gospel to be revealed; (2) it had a
	delegated virtue from the Gospel, which ceased, therefore, when the
	Gospel came.
