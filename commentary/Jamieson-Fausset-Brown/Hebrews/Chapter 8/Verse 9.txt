	different from, and far superior to, the old covenant, which only
	"worked wrath" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:15">Romans 4:15</span>)
	through man's "not regarding" it. The new covenant enables
	us to obey by the Spirit's inward impulse producing love because of
	the forgiveness of our sins.

	"There are three periods: (1) that of the promise (2) that of
	the pedagogical instruction; (3) that of fulfilment" [BENGEL].
	The second, that of the pedagogical pupilage, began at the exodus

<p><b>I regarded them not</b>—<i>English
	Version,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:32">Jeremiah 31:32</span>,
	translates, "Although <i>I was an husband unto</i> them."
	Paul's translation here is supported by the <i>Septuagint, Syriac,</i>
	and GESENIUS, and accords
	with the kindred <i>Arabic.</i> The Hebrews <i>regarded not</i> God,
	so God, in righteous retribution, <i>regarded</i> them <i>not.</i> On
	"continued not in my covenant," Schelling observes: The law
	was in fact the mere <i>ideal</i> of a religious constitution: in
	<i>practice,</i> the Jews were throughout, before the captivity, more
	or less polytheists, except in the time of David, and the first years
	of Solomon (the type of Messiah's reign). Even after the return from
	Babylon, idolatry was succeeded by what was not much better,
	formalism and hypocrisy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:32- :">Jeremiah 31:32- :</span>). The law was (1) a typical picture, tracing out the
	features of the glorious Gospel to be revealed; (2) it had a
	delegated virtue from the Gospel, which ceased, therefore, when the
	Gospel came.</p>
