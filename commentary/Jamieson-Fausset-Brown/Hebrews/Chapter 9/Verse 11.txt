<p><b>Christ</b>—The Messiah, of
	whom all the prophets foretold; not "Jesus" here. From whom
	the "reformation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), or <i>rectification,</i> emanates, which frees from the
	yoke of carnal ordinances, and which is being realized gradually now,
	and shall be perfectly in the consummation of "the age (world)
	to come." "Christ . . . High Priest," exactly answers

<p><b>being come an,</b> c.—rather,
	"having come forward (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+4:5- :">Leviticus 4:5- :</span>, a different <i>Greek</i> word, picturesquely presenting Him
	before us) <i>as</i> High Priest." The Levitical priests must
	therefore retire. Just as on the day of atonement, no work was done,
	no sacrifice was offered, or priest was allowed to be in the
	tabernacle while the high priest went into the holiest place to make
	atonement (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:17">Leviticus 16:17</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:29">Leviticus 16:29</span>).
	So not our righteousness, nor any other priest's sacrifice, but
	Christ alone atones; and as the high priest before offering incense
	had on common garments of a priest, but after it wore his holy
	garments of "glory and beauty" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:2">Exodus 28:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:40">Exodus 28:40</span>) in entering the

	As the Jewish high priest passed <i>through</i> the anterior
	tabernacle into the holiest place, so Christ passed through <i>heaven</i>
	into the inner abode of the unseen and unapproachable God. Thus, "the
	tabernacle" here is the <i>heavens through</i> which He passed
	(see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:14">Hebrews 4:14</span>). But "the
	tabernacle" is also <i>the glorified body of Christ</i> (see on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span>), "not of this
	building" (not of the mere natural "<i>creation,</i> but of
	the spiritual and heavenly, <i>the new creation</i>"), the Head
	of the mystical body, the Church. <i>Through</i> this glorified body
	He passes into the heavenly holiest place (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:2- :">Hebrews 8:2- :</span>), the immaterial, unapproachable presence of God, where He
	intercedes for us. <i>His glorified body,</i> as the meeting place of
	God and all Christ's redeemed, and the angels, answers to <i>the
	heavens</i> through which He passed, and passes. His <i>body</i> is
	opposed to the <i>tabernacle,</i> as His blood to the blood of goats,
