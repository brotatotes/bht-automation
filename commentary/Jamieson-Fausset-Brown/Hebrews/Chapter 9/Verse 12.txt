<p><b>goats . . . calves</b>—not
	a bullock, such as the Levitical high priest offered for himself, and
	a goat for the people, on the day of atonement (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:6">Leviticus 16:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:15">Leviticus 16:15</span>), <i>year by year,</i>
	whence the plural is used, <i>goats . . . calves.</i> Besides the
	goat offered for the people the blood of which was sprinkled before
	the mercy seat, the high priest led forth a second goat, namely, the
	scapegoat; over it he confessed the people's sins, putting them on
	the head of the goat, which was sent as the sin-bearer into the
	wilderness out of sight, implying that the atonement effected by the
	goat sin offering (of which the ceremony of the scapegoat is a part,
	and not distinct from the sin offering) consisted in the transfer of
	the people's sins on the goat, and their consequent removal out of
	sight. The translation of sins on the victim usual in other expiatory
	sacrifices being omitted in the case of the slain goat, but employed
	in the case of the goat sent away, proved the two goats were regarded
	as one offering [ARCHBISHOP
	MAGEE]. Christ's death is
	symbolized by the slain goat; His resurrection to life by the living
	goat sent away. Modern Jews substitute in some places a <i>cock</i>
	for the goat as an expiation, the sins of the offerers being
	transferred to the entrails, and exposed on the housetop for the
	birds to carry out of sight, as the scapegoat did; the <i>Hebrew</i>
	for "man" and "cock" being similar, <i>gebher</i>
	[BUXTORF].

<p><b>by</b>—"through,"
	as the means of His entrance; the key unlocking the heavenly Holy of
	Holies to Him. The <i>Greek</i> is forcible, "through THE
	blood of His own" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:15- :">Leviticus 16:15- :</span>).

<p><b>having obtained</b>—having
	<i>thereby</i> obtained; literally, "found for Himself," as
	a thing of insuperable difficulty to all save Divine Omnipotence,
	self-devoting zeal, and love, to find. The access of Christ to the
	Father was arduous (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>).
	None before had trodden the path.

<p><b>eternal</b>—The entrance of
	our Redeemer, <i>once for all,</i> into the heavenly holiest place,
	secures <i>eternal</i> redemption to us; whereas the Jewish high
	priest's entrance was repeated year by year, and the effect temporary
	and partial, "On redemption," compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>;

	His death is the inaugurating act of the new covenant, and of the
	heavenly sanctuary (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14- :">Hebrews 9:14- :</span>). His entrance into the true Holy of Holies is the
