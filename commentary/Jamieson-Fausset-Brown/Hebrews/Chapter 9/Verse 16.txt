<p><b>16.</b> A general axiomatic truth;
	it is "<i>a</i> testament"; not <i>the testament.</i> The
	testator must die before his <i>testament</i> takes effect (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). This is a common meaning of the <i>Greek</i> noun
	<i>diathece.</i> So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:29">Luke 22:29</span>,
	"I appoint (by testamentary disposition; the cognate <i>Greek</i>
	verb <i>diatithemai</i>) unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath
	appointed unto me." The need of death before the testamentary
	appointment takes effect, holds good in Christ's relation as MAN to
	us; Of course not in <i>God's</i> relation to Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>be</b>â€”literally, be
	borne": "be involved in the case"; <i>be inferred;</i>
	or else, "be brought forward in court," so as to give
	effect to the will. This sense (<i>testament</i>) of the <i>Greek</i>
	"<i>diathece</i>" here does not exclude its other secondary
	senses in the other passages of the New Testament: (1) a <i>covenant</i>
	between <i>two</i> parties; (2) an arrangement, or disposition, made
	by <i>God alone</i> in relation to us. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:29- :">Luke 22:29- :</span> may be translated, "Blood of the <i>covenant</i>";
	for a <i>testament</i> does not require <i>blood</i> shedding.
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:8">Exodus 24:8</span> (<i>covenant</i>),
	which Christ quotes, though it is probable He <i>included</i> in a
	sense "testament" also under the <i>Greek</i> word <i>diathece</i>
	(comprehending <i>both</i> meanings, "covenant" and
	"testament"), as this designation strictly and properly
	applies to the new dispensation, and is rightly applicable to the old
	also, not in itself, but when viewed as typifying the new, which is
	properly a <i>testament.</i> Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:8- :">Exodus 24:8- :</span>) speaks of the same thing as [Christ and] Paul. Moses, by
	the term "covenant," does not mean aught save one
	concerning giving the heavenly <i>inheritance</i> typified by Canaan
	after the death of the <i>Testator,</i> which he represented by the
	sprinkling of blood. And Paul, by the term "testament,"
	does not mean aught save one having <i>conditions</i> attached to it,
	one which is at the same time a <i>covenant</i> [POLI,
	<i>Synopsis</i>]; the conditions are fulfilled by Christ, not by us,
	except that we must <i>believe,</i> but even this God works in His
	people. THOLUCK explains,
	as elsewhere, "<i>covenant</i> . . . covenant . . . mediating
	victim"; the <i>masculine</i> is used of the victim personified,
	and regarded as mediator of the covenant; especially as in the new
	covenant a MAN (Christ)
	took the place of the victim. The covenanting parties used to pass
	between the divided parts of the sacrificed animals; but, without
	reference to this rite, the need of a <i>sacrifice</i> for
	establishing a covenant sufficiently explains this verse. Others,
	also, explaining the <i>Greek</i> as "covenant," consider
	that the death of the sacrificial victim represented in all covenants
	the death of both parties as <i>unalterably bound to the covenant.</i>
	So in the redemption-covenant, the death of Jesus symbolized the
	death of God (?) in the person of the mediating victim, and the death
	of man in the same. But the expression is not "there must be the
	death of <i>both parties</i> making the covenant," but <i>singular,</i>
	"of <i>Him</i> who <i>made</i> (aorist, past time; not 'of Him
	<i>making</i>') the testament." Also, it is "death,"
	not "sacrifice" or "slaying." Plainly, the death
	is supposed to be <i>past</i> (aorist, "made"); and the
	fact of the death is <i>brought</i> (<i>Greek</i>) before court to
	give effect to the will. These requisites of a will, or testament,
	concur here: (1) a testator; (2) heirs; (3) goods; (4) the death of
	the testator; (5) the fact of the death <i>brought forward</i> in
	court. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28">Matthew 26:28</span> two other
	requisites appear: <i>witnesses,</i> the disciples; and <i>a seal,</i>
	the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the sign of His <i>blood</i>
	wherewith the testament is primarily sealed. It is true the <i>heir</i>
	is ordinarily the <i>successor</i> of him who dies and so ceases to
	have the possession. But in this case Christ comes to life again, and
	is Himself (including all that He hath), in the power of His now
	endless life, His people's inheritance; in <i>His</i> being Heir (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:28- :">Matthew 26:28- :</span>), <i>they</i> are heirs.</p>
