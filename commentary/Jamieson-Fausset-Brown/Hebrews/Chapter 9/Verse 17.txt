<p><b>17. after</b>—literally, "over,"
	as we say "<i>upon</i> the death of the testators"; not as
	THOLUCK, "on the
	condition that slain sacrifices be there," which the <i>Greek</i>
	hardly sanctions.

<p><b>otherwise</b>—"seeing
	that it is never availing" [ALFORD].
	BENGEL and LACHMANN
	read with an interrogation, "Since, is it ever in force (surely
	not) while the testator liveth?"</p>
