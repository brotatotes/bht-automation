18. Whereupon—rather,
	"Whence." 
	dedicated—"inaugurated."
	The Old Testament strictly and formally began on that day of
	inauguration. "Where the disposition, or arrangement,
	is ratified by the blood of another, namely, of animals, which cannot
	make a covenant, much less make a testament, it is not
	strictly a testament, where it is ratified by the death of him
	that makes the arrangement, it is strictly, Greek 'diathece,'
	Hebrew 'berith,' taken in a wider sense, a testament"
	[BENGEL]; thus, in  :-, referring to the old dispensation, we may translate, "the
	first (covenant)": or better, retain "the first
	(testament)," not that the old dispensation, regarded
	by itself, is a testament, but it is so when regarded as
	the typical representative of the new, which is strictly a
	Testament.
