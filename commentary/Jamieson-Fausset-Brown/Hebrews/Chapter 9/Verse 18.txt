<p><b>18. Whereupon</b>—rather,

<p><b>dedicated</b>—"inaugurated."
	The Old Testament strictly and formally began on that day of
	inauguration. "Where the <i>disposition,</i> or <i>arrangement,</i>
	is ratified by the blood of another, namely, of animals, which cannot
	make a <i>covenant,</i> much less make a <i>testament,</i> it is not
	strictly a <i>testament,</i> where it is ratified by the death of him
	that makes the arrangement, it is strictly, <i>Greek</i> '<i>diathece,</i>'
	<i>Hebrew</i> '<i>berith,</i>' taken in a wider sense, a <i>testament</i>"
	[BENGEL]; thus, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, referring to the old dispensation, we may translate, "the
	first (<i>covenant</i>)": or better, retain "the first
	(<i>testament</i>)," not that the old dispensation, <i>regarded
	by itself,</i> is a <i>testament,</i> but it is so when regarded as
	the <i>typical representative of the new,</i> which is strictly a
	<i>Testament.</i></p>
