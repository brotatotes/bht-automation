<p><b>19. For</b>—confirming the general
	truth, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:16">Hebrews 9:16</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>spoken . . . according to the
	law</b>—strictly adhering to every direction of "the law of
	commandments contained in ordinances" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:16- :">Hebrews 9:16- :</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:3">Exodus 24:3</span>,
	"Moses told the people <i>all the words of the Lord, and all the
	judgments;</i> and <i>all the people</i> answered with one voice,"
	c. 
	</p>
<p><b>the blood of calves</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the calves," namely, those sacrificed by the "young
	men" whom he sent to do so (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:3- :">Exodus 24:3- :</span>). The "peace offerings" there mentioned were "of
	<i>oxen</i>" (<i>Septuagint,</i> "little calves"), and
	the "burnt offerings" were probably (though this is not
	specified), as on the day of atonement, <i>goats.</i> The law in
	Exodus sanctioned formally many sacrificial practices in use by
	tradition, from the primitive revelation long before. 
	</p>
<p><b>with water</b>—prescribed,
	though not in the twenty-fourth chapter of Exodus, yet in other
	purifications for example, of the leper, and the water of separation
	which contained the ashes of the red heifer. 
	</p>
<p><b>scarlet wool, and
	hyssop</b>—ordinarily used for purification. <i>Scarlet</i> or
	<i>crimson,</i> resembling blood: it was thought to be a peculiarly
	deep, fast dye, whence it typified sin (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:3- :">Exodus 24:3- :</span>). So Jesus wore a scarlet robe, the emblem of the deep-dyed
	sins He bore <i>on</i> Him, though He had none <i>in</i> Him. Wool
	was used as imbibing and retaining water; the hyssop, as a bushy,
	tufty plant (wrapt round with the scarlet wool), was used for
	sprinkling it. The wool was also a symbol of purity (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:3- :">Exodus 24:3- :</span>). The <i>Hyssopus officinalis</i> grows on walls, with small
	lancet-formed woolly leaves, an inch long, with blue and white
	flowers, and a knotty stalk about a foot high. 
	</p>
<p><b>sprinkled . . . the
	book</b>—namely, out of which he had read "every precept":
	the book of the testament or covenant. This sprinkling of the book is
	not mentioned in the twenty-fourth chapter of Exodus. Hence BENGEL
	translates, "And (having taken) the book itself (so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:3- :">Exodus 24:3- :</span>), he both sprinkled all the people, and (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:3- :">Exodus 24:3- :</span>) moreover sprinkled the tabernacle." But the <i>Greek</i>
	supports <i>English Version.</i> Paul, by inspiration, supplies the
	particular specified here, not in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+24:3- :">Exodus 24:3- :</span>. The sprinkling of the <i>roll</i> (so the <i>Greek</i> for
	"book") of the covenant, or testament, as well as of the
	people, implies that neither can <i>the law</i> be fulfilled, nor the
	people be purged from their sins, save by the sprinkling of the blood
	of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2">1 Peter 1:2</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2- :">1 Peter 1:2- :</span>, which shows that there is something antitypical to the
	Bible in heaven itself (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:2- :">1 Peter 1:2- :</span>). The <i>Greek,</i> "itself," distinguishes <i>the
	book itself</i> from the "precepts" in it which he "spake."</p>
