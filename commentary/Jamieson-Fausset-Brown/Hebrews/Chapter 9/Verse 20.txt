<p><b>20.</b> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "<i>Behold</i> the blood of the covenant, which <i>the
	Lord</i> has made with you concerning all these words." The
	change is here made to accord with Christ's inauguration of the new
	testament, or covenant, as recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "This cup (is) the new Testament in My blood, which
	is shed for you": the only Gospel in which the "is"
	has to be supplied. Luke was <i>Paul's</i> companion, which accounts
	for the correspondence, as here too "is" has to be
	supplied.

<p><b>testament</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The <i>Greek</i> "<i>diathece</i>" means
	both "testament" and "covenant": the term
	"covenant" better suits the old dispensation, though the
	idea <i>testament</i> is included, for the old was one in its typical
	relation to the new dispensation, to which the term "testament"
	is better suited. Christ has sealed the testament with His <i>blood,</i>
	of which the Lord's Supper is the sacramental sign. The testator was
	represented by the animals slain in the old dispensation. In both
	dispensations the inheritance was bequeathed: in the new by One who
	has come in person and died; in the old by the same one, only
	typically and ceremonially present. See ALFORD'S
	excellent Note.

<p><b>enjoined unto
	you</b>—<i>commissioned</i> me to ratify <i>in relation to you.</i>
	In the old dispensation the condition to be fulfilled on the people's
	part is implied in the words, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "(Lord made with you) <i>concerning all these words.</i>"
	But here Paul omits this clause, as he includes the fulfilment of
	this condition of obedience to "all these words" in the new
	covenant, as part of God's promise, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:8">Hebrews 8:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:10">Hebrews 8:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+8:12">Hebrews 8:12</span>,
	whereby Christ fulfils all for our justification, and will enable us
	by putting His Spirit in us to fulfil all in our now progressive, and
	finally complete, sanctification.</p>
