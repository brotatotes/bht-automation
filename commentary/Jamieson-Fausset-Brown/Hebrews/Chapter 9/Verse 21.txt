<p><b>21.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "<i>And,</i>
	moreover, <i>in like manner.</i>" The <i>sprinkling of the
	tabernacle with blood</i> is added by inspiration here to the account
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:25-30">Exodus 30:25-30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:9">Exodus 40:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+40:10">Exodus 40:10</span>, which mentions only
	Moses' anointing the tabernacle and its vessels. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+8:10">Leviticus 8:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+8:15">Leviticus 8:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+8:30">Leviticus 8:30</span>,
	the sprinkling of blood upon Aaron and his garments, and upon his
	sons, and upon the altar, is mentioned as well as the anointing, so
	that we might naturally infer, as JOSEPHUS
	has distinctly stated, that the tabernacle and its vessels were
	sprinkled with blood as well as being anointed: <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:16">Leviticus 16:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:20">Leviticus 16:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:33">Leviticus 16:33</span>,
	virtually sanctions this inference. The tabernacle and its contents
	needed purification (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+29:21">2 Chronicles 29:21</span>).</p>
