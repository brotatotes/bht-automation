22. almost—to be joined with
	"all things," namely almost all things under the old
	dispensation. The exceptions to all things being purified by blood
	are, Exodus 19:10; Leviticus 15:5;
	Leviticus 16:26; Leviticus 16:28;
	Leviticus 22:6; Numbers 31:22-24.
	without—Greek,
	"apart from." 
	shedding of blood—shed
	in the slaughter of the victim, and poured out at the altar
	subsequently. The pouring out of the blood on the altar is the
	main part of the sacrifice (Numbers 31:22-4.31.24- :), and it could not have place apart from the previous
	shedding of the blood in the slaying. Paul has, perhaps, in
	mind here, Luke 22:20, "This
	cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you." 
	is—Greek, "takes
	place": comes to pass. 
	remission—of sins: a
	favorite expression of Luke, Paul's companion. Properly used of
	remitting a debt (Matthew 6:12;
	Matthew 18:27; Matthew 18:32);
	our sins are debts. On the truth here, compare Matthew 18:32- :, an exception because of poverty, confirming the general
	rule.
