<p><b>22. almost</b>—to be joined with
	"all things," namely <i>almost all things</i> under the old

<p><b>shedding of blood</b>—<i>shed</i>
	in the slaughter of the victim, and poured out at the altar
	subsequently. The <i>pouring out of the blood on the altar</i> is the
	main part of the sacrifice (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:22-4.31.24- :">Numbers 31:22-4.31.24- :</span>), and it could not have place apart from the previous
	<i>shedding of</i> the blood in the slaying. Paul has, perhaps, in
	mind here, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:20">Luke 22:20</span>, "This

<p><b>remission</b>—of sins: a
	favorite expression of Luke, Paul's companion. Properly used of
	remitting a debt (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>;

	our sins are debts. On the truth here, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:32- :">Matthew 18:32- :</span>, an exception because of poverty, confirming the general
	rule.</p>
