<p><b>heavenly things

	of disorder into the relations of God and His holy angels in respect
	to man. The <i>purification</i> removes this element of disorder and
	changes God's wrath against man in heaven (designed to be the place
	of God's revealing His grace to men and angels) into a smile of
	reconciliation. Compare "peace in heaven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "The uncreated heaven of God, though in itself
	untroubled light, yet needed a purification in so far as the light of
	love was obscured by the fire of wrath against sinful man"
	[DELITZSCH in ALFORD].

<p><b>sacrifices</b>—The plural
	is used in expressing the general proposition, though strictly
	referring to the <i>one</i> sacrifice of Christ once for all. Paul
	implies that His one sacrifice, by its matchless excellency, is
	equivalent to the Levitical many sacrifices. It, though but one, is
	manifold in its effects and applicability to many.</p>
