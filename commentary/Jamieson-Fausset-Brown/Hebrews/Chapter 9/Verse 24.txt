	and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:15-23">Hebrews 9:15-23</span>, he
	has enlarged on "an High Priest of good things to come." 
	</p>
<p><b>not . . . into . . . holy
	places made with hands</b>—as was the Holy of Holies in the earthly
	tabernacle (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>figures</b>—copies "of
	the true" holiest place, heaven, the original archetype (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11- :">Hebrews 9:11- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>into heaven itself</b>—the
	immediate presence of the invisible God beyond all the created
	heavens, <i>through</i> which latter Jesus passed (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11- :">Hebrews 9:11- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:11- :">Hebrews 9:11- :</span>).

<p><b>now</b>—ever since His

<p><b>to appear</b>—To PRESENT
	HIMSELF; <i>Greek,</i> "to
	be made to appear." Mere man may have a vision through a medium,
	or veil, as Moses had (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:18">Exodus 33:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+33:20-23">Exodus 33:20-23</span>). Christ alone
	beholds the Father without a veil, and is His perfect image. Through
	seeing HIM only can we see
	the Father. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the presence of God</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>to the face</i> of God." The saints shall hereafter see
	God's face in Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:4">Revelation 22:4</span>):
	the earnest of which is now given (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:4- :">Revelation 22:4- :</span>). Aaron, the Levitical high priest <i>for</i> the people,
	stood <i>before the ark</i> and only saw the <i>cloud,</i> the symbol
	of God's glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:30">Exodus 28:30</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>for us</b>—in our behalf as
	our Advocate and Intercessor (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span>;

	"It is enough that Jesus should <i>show Himself for us</i> to
	the Father: the sight of Jesus satisfied God in our behalf. He brings
	before the face of God no offering which has exhausted itself, and,
	as only sufficing for a time, needs renewal; but He himself is in
	person, by virtue of the eternal Spirit, that is, the imperishable
	life of His person, now and for ever freed from death, our eternally
	present offering before God" [DELITZSCH
	in ALFORD].</p>
