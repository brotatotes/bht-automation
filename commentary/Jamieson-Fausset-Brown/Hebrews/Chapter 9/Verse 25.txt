<p><b>25.</b> As in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, Paul said, it was not into the typical, but the true
	sanctuary, that Christ is entered; so now he says, that His sacrifice
	needs not, as the Levitical sacrifices did, to be repeated. Construe,
	"<i>Nor yet</i> did He enter for this purpose <i>that He may
	offer Himself often,</i>" that is, "<i>present Himself in
	the presence of God,</i> as the high priest does (Paul uses the
	<i>present tense,</i> as the legal service was then existing), year
	by year, on the day of atonement, entering the Holy of Holies. 
	</p>
<p><b>with</b>—literally, "in."
	</p>
<p><b>blood of others</b>—<i>not
	his own,</i> as Christ did.</p>
