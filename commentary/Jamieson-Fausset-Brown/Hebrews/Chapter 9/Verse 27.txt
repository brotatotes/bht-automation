<p><b>27. as</b>—inasmuch as.

<p><b>it is appointed</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"it is <i>laid up</i> (as our appointed lot)," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The word "appointed" (so <i>Hebrew</i> "<i>seth</i>"
	means) in the case of man, answers to "anointed" in the
	case of Jesus; therefore "the Christ," that is, <i>the
	anointed,</i> is the title here given designedly. He is the
	representative man; and there is a strict correspondence between the
	history of <i>man</i> and that of <i>the Son of man.</i> The two most
	solemn facts of our being are here connected with the two most
	gracious truths of our dispensation, our death and judgment answering
	in parallelism to Christ's first coming to die for us, and His second
	coming to consummate our salvation.

<p><b>once</b>—and no more. 
	</p>
<p><b>after this the
	judgment</b>—namely, at Christ's appearing, to which, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "judgment" in this verse is parallel. Not, "after
	this comes the heavenly glory." The intermediate state is a
	state of joyous, or else agonizing and fearful, <i>expectation</i> of
	"judgment"; after the judgment comes the full and final
	state of joy, or else woe.</p>
