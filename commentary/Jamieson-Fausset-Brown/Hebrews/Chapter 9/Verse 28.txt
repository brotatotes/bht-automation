<p><b>28. Christ</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "THE
	Christ"; the representative MAN;
	representing all men, as the first Adam did. 
	</p>
<p><b>once offered</b>—not
	"often," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:25">Hebrews 9:25</span>;
	just as "men," of whom He is the representative Head, are
	appointed by God <i>once</i> to die. He did not need to die again and
	again for each individual, or each successive generation of men, for
	He represents <i>all</i> men of every age, and therefore needed to
	die but once for all, so as to exhaust the penalty of death incurred
	by all. He was offered by the Father, His own "eternal Spirit"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>) concurring; as
	Abraham spared not Isaac, but offered him, the son himself
	unresistingly submitting to the father's will (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14- :">Hebrews 9:14- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>to bear the sins</b>—referring
	to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:12">Isaiah 53:12</span>, "He bare
	the sins of many," namely, <i>on Himself;</i> so "bear"
	means, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+24:15">Leviticus 24:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+5:31">Numbers 5:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:34">Numbers 14:34</span>. The <i>Greek</i> is
	literally "to bear up" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:34- :">Numbers 14:34- :</span>). "Our sins were laid on Him. When, therefore, He was
	lifted up on the cross, He bare up our sins along with Him"
	[BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>many</b>—not opposed to
	<i>all,</i> but to few. He, <i>the One,</i> was offered for <i>many;</i>
	and that <i>once for all</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:34- :">Numbers 14:34- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>look for him</b>—<i>with
	waiting expectation even unto the end</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>). It
	is translated "wait for" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19">Romans 8:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</span>,
	which see. 
	</p>
<p><b>appear</b>—rather, as
	<i>Greek,</i> "be seen." No longer in the alien "form
	of a servant," but in His own proper glory. 
	</p>
<p><b>without sin</b>—apart from,
	separate from, sin. Not bearing the sin of many <i>on</i> Him as at
	His first coming (even then there was no sin <i>in</i> Him). That sin
	has been at His first coming once for all taken away, so as to need
	no repetition of His sin offering of Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7- :">1 Corinthians 1:7- :</span>). At His second coming He shall have no more to do with sin.
	</p>
<p><b>unto salvation</b>—to bring
	in completed salvation; redeeming then the body which is as yet
	subject to the bondage of corruption. Hence, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:7- :">1 Corinthians 1:7- :</span> he says, "we look for THE
	SAVIOUR." Note,
	Christ's <i>prophetical</i> office, as the <i>divine Teacher,</i> was
	especially exercised during His earthly ministry; His <i>priestly</i>
	is now from His first to His second coming; His <i>kingly</i> office
	shall be fully manifested at, and after, His second coming.</p>
