8. The Holy Ghost—Moses
	himself did not comprehend the typical meaning (1 Peter 1:11;
	1 Peter 1:12). 
	signifying—by the
	typical exclusion of all from the holiest, save the high priest once
	a year. 
	the holiest of all—heaven,
	the antitype. 
	the first tabernacle—the
	anterior tabernacle, representative of the whole Levitical system.
	While it (the first tabernacle, and that which represents the
	Levitical system) as yet "has a standing" (so
	the Greek, that is, "has continuance": "lasts"),
	the way to heaven (the antitypical "holiest place")
	is not yet made manifest (compare Hebrews 10:19;
	Hebrews 10:20). The Old Testament
	economy is represented by the holy place, the New Testament economy
	by the Holy of Holies. Redemption, by Christ, has opened the Holy of
	Holies (access to heaven by faith now, Hebrews 4:16;
	Hebrews 7:19; Hebrews 7:25;
	Hebrews 10:19; Hebrews 10:22;
	by sight hereafter, Isaiah 33:24;
	Revelation 11:19; Revelation 21:2;
	Revelation 21:3) to all mankind. The
	Greek for "not yet" (me po) refers to the
	mind of the Spirit: the Spirit intimating that men should not
	think the way was yet opened [TITTMANN].
	The Greek negative, "ou po," would deny the
	fact objectively; "me po" denies the thing
	subjectively.
