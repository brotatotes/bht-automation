	<i>continued still in Paul's time and that of his Hebrew readers.</i>
	"The time of reformation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) stands in contrast to this, "the existing time";
	though, in reality, "the time of reformation," the New
	Testament time, was now <i>present</i> and existing. So "the age
	<i>to come,</i>" is the phrase applied to the Gospel, because it
	was <i>present only to believers,</i> and its fulness even to them is
	still <i>to come.</i> Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "good things to come."
