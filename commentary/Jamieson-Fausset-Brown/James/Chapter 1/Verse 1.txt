1. James—an apostle of the
	circumcision, with Peter and John, James in Jerusalem, Palestine, and
	Syria; Peter in Babylon and the East; John in Ephesus and Asia Minor.
	Peter addresses the dispersed Jews of Pontus, Galatia, and
	Cappadocia; James, the Israelites of the twelve tribes
	scattered abroad.
servant of God—not that
	he was not an apostle; for Paul, an apostle, also calls
	himself so; but as addressing the Israelites generally, including
	even indirectly the unbelieving, he in humility omits the title
	"apostle"; so Paul in writing to the Hebrews; similarly
	Jude, an apostle, in his General Epistle. 
	Jesus Christ—not
	mentioned again save in James 2:1;
	not at all in his speeches (Acts 15:14;
	Acts 15:15; Acts 21:20;
	Acts 21:21), lest his introducing
	the name of Jesus oftener should seem to arise from vanity, as being
	"the Lord's brother" [BENGEL].
	His teaching being practical, rather than doctrinal, required less
	frequent mention of Christ's name. 
	scattered abroad—literally
	"which are in the dispersion." The dispersion of the
	Israelites, and their connection with Jerusalem as a center of
	religion, was a divinely ordered means of propagating Christianity.
	The pilgrim troops of the law became caravans of the Gospel
	[WORDSWORTH]. 
	greeting—found in no
	other Christian letter, but in James and the Jerusalem Synod's
	Epistle to the Gentile churches; an undesigned coincidence and mark
	or genuineness. In the original Greek (chairein) for
	"greeting," there is a connection with the "joy"
	to which they are exhorted amidst their existing distresses from
	poverty and consequent oppression. Compare Acts 21:21- :, which alludes to their poverty.
