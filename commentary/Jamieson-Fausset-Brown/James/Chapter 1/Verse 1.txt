<p><b>1. James</b>—an apostle of the
	circumcision, with Peter and John, James in Jerusalem, Palestine, and
	Syria; Peter in Babylon and the East; John in Ephesus and Asia Minor.
	Peter addresses the dispersed <i>Jews of Pontus, Galatia, and
	Cappadocia;</i> James, the <i>Israelites of the twelve tribes
	scattered abroad.</i>
</p>
<p><b>servant of God</b>—not that
	he was not an <i>apostle;</i> for Paul, an apostle, also calls
	himself so; but as addressing the Israelites generally, including
	even indirectly the unbelieving, he in humility omits the title
	"apostle"; so Paul in writing to the Hebrews; similarly
	Jude, an apostle, in his General Epistle. 
	</p>
<p><b>Jesus Christ</b>—not
	mentioned again save in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span>;
	not at all in his speeches (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:14">Acts 15:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:15">Acts 15:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:20">Acts 21:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21">Acts 21:21</span>), lest his introducing
	the name of Jesus oftener should seem to arise from vanity, as being
	"the Lord's brother" [BENGEL].
	His teaching being practical, rather than doctrinal, required less
	frequent mention of Christ's name. 
	</p>
<p><b>scattered abroad</b>—literally
	"which are in the dispersion." The dispersion of the
	Israelites, and their connection with Jerusalem as a center of
	religion, was a divinely ordered means of propagating Christianity.
	The pilgrim troops of the law became caravans of the Gospel
	[WORDSWORTH]. 
	</p>
<p><b>greeting</b>—found in no
	other Christian letter, but in James and the Jerusalem Synod's
	Epistle to the Gentile churches; an undesigned coincidence and mark
	or genuineness. In the original <i>Greek</i> (<i>chairein</i>) for
	"greeting," there is a connection with the "joy"
	to which they are exhorted amidst their existing distresses from
	poverty and consequent oppression. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+21:21- :">Acts 21:21- :</span>, which alludes to their poverty.</p>
