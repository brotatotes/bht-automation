<p><b>12. Blessed</b>—Compare the
	beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:4">Matthew 5:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:10">Matthew 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11">Matthew 5:11</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>endureth temptation</b>—not
	the "falling into divers temptations" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11- :">Matthew 5:11- :</span>) is the matter for "joy," but the <i>enduring</i>
	of temptation "unto the end." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11- :">Matthew 5:11- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>when he is tried</b>—literally,
	"when he has become tested" or "approved," when
	he has passed through the "trying" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11- :">Matthew 5:11- :</span>), his "faith" having finally gained the victory. 
	</p>
<p><b>the crown</b>—not in
	allusion to the crown or garland given to winners in the games; for
	this, though a natural allusion for Paul in writing to the heathen,
	among whom such games existed, would be less appropriate for James in
	addressing the Jewish Christians, who regarded Gentile usages with
	aversion. 
	</p>
<p><b>of life</b>—"life"
	constitutes the crown, literally, <i>the</i> life, the only true
	life, the highest and eternal life. The crown implies a <i>kingdom</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+21:3">Psalms 21:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the Lord</b>—not found in
	the best manuscripts and versions. The believer's heart fills up the
	omission, without the name needing to be mentioned. The "faithful
	One who promised" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+21:3- :">Psalms 21:3- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>to them that love him</b>—In
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>, "the crown of
	righteousness to them that love His appearing." Love produces
	patient <i>endurance:</i> none attest their love more than they who
	suffer for Him.</p>
