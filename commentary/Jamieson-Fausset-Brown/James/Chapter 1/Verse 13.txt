13. when . . . tempted—tried
	by solicitation to evil. Heretofore the "temptation"
	meant was that of probation by afflictions. Let no one fancy
	that God lays upon him an inevitable necessity of sinning. God does
	not send trials on you in order to make you worse, but to make you
	better (James 1:16; James 1:17).
	Therefore do not sink under the pressure of evils (James 1:17- :). 
	of God—by agency
	proceeding from God. The Greek is not "tempted
	by," but, "from," implying indirect agency. 
	cannot be tempted with evil,
	c.—"Neither do any of our sins tempt God to entice us to worse
	things, nor does He tempt any of His own accord"
	(literally, "of Himself" compare the antithesis, James 1:17- :, "Of His own will He begat us" to holiness,
	so far is He from tempting us of His own will) [BENGEL].
	God is said in Genesis 22:1 to have
	"tempted Abraham"; but there the tempting meant is
	that of trying or proving, not that of seducement.
	ALFORD translates
	according to the ordinary sense of the Greek, "God is
	unversed in evil." But as this gives a less likely sense,
	English Version probably gives the true sense; for
	ecclesiastical Greek often uses words in new senses, as the
	exigencies of the new truths to be taught required.
