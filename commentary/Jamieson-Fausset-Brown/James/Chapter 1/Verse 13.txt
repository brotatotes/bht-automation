<p><b>13. when . . . tempted</b>—tried
	by <i>solicitation to evil.</i> Heretofore the "temptation"
	meant was that of <i>probation by afflictions.</i> Let no one fancy
	that God lays upon him an inevitable necessity of sinning. God does
	not send trials on you in order to make you worse, but to make you
	better (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:16">James 1:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:17">James 1:17</span>).
	Therefore do not sink under the pressure of evils (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:17- :">James 1:17- :</span>).

<p><b>of God</b>—by agency
	proceeding <i>from</i> God. The <i>Greek</i> is not "tempted
	<i>by,</i>" but, "from," implying indirect agency.

<p><b>cannot be tempted with evil,</b>
	c.—"Neither do any of our sins tempt God to entice us to worse
	things, nor does He tempt any <i>of His own accord</i>"
	(literally, "of Himself" compare the antithesis, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:17- :">James 1:17- :</span>, "<i>Of His own will</i> He begat us" to holiness,
	so far is He from tempting us <i>of His own will</i>) [BENGEL].
	God is said in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+22:1">Genesis 22:1</span> to have
	"tempted Abraham"; but there the <i>tempting</i> meant is
	that of <i>trying</i> or <i>proving,</i> not that of seducement.
	ALFORD translates
	according to the ordinary sense of the <i>Greek,</i> "God is
	<i>unversed</i> in evil." But as this gives a less likely sense,
	<i>English Version</i> probably gives the true sense; for
	ecclesiastical <i>Greek</i> often uses words in new senses, as the
	exigencies of the new truths to be taught required.</p>
