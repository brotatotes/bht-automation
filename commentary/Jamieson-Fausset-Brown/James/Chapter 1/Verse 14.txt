14. Every man, when tempted, is
	so through being drawn away of (again here, as in  :-, the Greek for "of" expresses the actual
	source, rather than the agent of temptation) his own lust. The
	cause of sin is in ourselves. Even Satan's suggestions do not
	endanger us before they are made our own. Each one has his
	own peculiar (so the Greek) lust, arising from his own
	temperament and habit. Lust flows from the original birth-sin in man,
	inherited from Adam. 
	drawn away—the
	beginning step in temptation: drawn away from truth and
	virtue. 
	enticed—literally,
	"taken with a bait," as fish are. The further progress:
	the man allowing himself (as the Greek middle voice
	implies) to be enticed to evil [BENGEL].
	"Lust" is here personified as the harlot that allures the
	man.
