<p><b>14.</b> Every man, when tempted, is
	so through being drawn away of (again here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, the <i>Greek</i> for "of" expresses the actual
	<i>source,</i> rather than the agent of temptation) his own lust. The
	cause of sin is in ourselves. Even Satan's suggestions do not
	endanger us before they are made <i>our own.</i> Each one has <i>his
	own peculiar</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>) lust, arising from his own
	temperament and habit. Lust flows from the original birth-sin in man,
	inherited from Adam. 
	</p>
<p><b>drawn away</b>—the
	<i>beginning</i> step in temptation: drawn away from truth and
	virtue. 
	</p>
<p><b>enticed</b>—literally,
	"taken with a bait," as fish are. The <i>further progress:</i>
	the man <i>allowing himself</i> (as the <i>Greek</i> middle voice
	implies) <i>to be enticed</i> to evil [BENGEL].
	"Lust" is here personified as the harlot that allures the
	man.</p>
