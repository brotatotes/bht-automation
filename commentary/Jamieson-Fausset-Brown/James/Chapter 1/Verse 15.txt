<p><b>15.</b> The guilty union is
	committed by the will embracing the temptress. "Lust," the
	harlot, then, "brings forth sin," namely, of that kind to
	which the temptation inclines. Then <i>the particular sin</i> (so the
	<i>Greek</i> implies), "when it is completed, brings forth
	death," with which it was all along pregnant [ALFORD].
	This "death" stands in striking contrast to the "crown
	of <i>life</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>)
	which "patience" or <i>endurance</i> ends in, when it has
	its "perfect work" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12- :">James 1:12- :</span>). He who will fight Satan with Satan's own weapons, must not
	wonder if he finds himself overmatched. Nip sin in the bud of lust.</p>
