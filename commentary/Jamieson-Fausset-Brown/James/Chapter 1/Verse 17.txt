<p><b>17. gift . . . gift</b>—not the
	same words in <i>Greek:</i> the first, <i>the act of giving,</i> or
	the gift in its <i>initiatory</i> stage; the second, <i>the thing
	given, the boon, when perfected.</i> As the "good gift"
	stands in contrast to "sin" in its initiatory stage (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), so the "perfect boon" is in contrast to "sin
	when it is finished," bringing forth <i>death</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>from above</b>—(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Father of lights</b>—Creator
	<i>of the lights in heaven</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> [ALFORD];
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:20">Genesis 4:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:21">Genesis 4:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:9">Hebrews 12:9</span>). This accords with the
	reference to the changes in the light of the heavenly bodies alluded
	to in the end of the verse. Also, Father of the spiritual lights in
	the kingdom of grace and glory [BENGEL].
	These were typified by the supernatural lights on the breastplate of
	the high priest, the Urim. As "God is light, and in Him is no
	darkness at all" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5">1 John 1:5</span>),
	He cannot in any way be the Author of sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5- :">1 John 1:5- :</span>), which is darkness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5- :">1 John 1:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>no variableness . . . shadow
	of turning</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:6">Malachi 3:6</span>).
	None of the alternations of light and shadow which the physical
	"lights" undergo, and which even the spiritual lights are
	liable to, as compared with God. "Shadow of turning,"
	literally, the dark "shadow-mark" cast <i>from</i> one of
	the heavenly bodies, arising from its "turning" or
	revolution, for example, when the moon is eclipsed by the shadow of
	the earth, and the sun by the body of the moon. BENGEL
	makes a climax, "no variation—not even the shadow of a
	turning"; the former denoting a change in the <i>understanding;</i>
	the latter, in the <i>will.</i></p>
