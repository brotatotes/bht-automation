	nothing but good proceeding from God.

<p><b>Of his own will</b>—Of his
	own good pleasure (which shows that it is God's essential nature to
	do good, not evil), not induced by any external cause.

	<i>death</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:15">James 1:15</span>).

	believers, in respect to regeneration, are, <i>as it were,</i>
	first-fruits (image from the consecration of the first-born of man,
	cattle, and fruits to God; familiar to the Jews addressed), that is,
	they are the first of God's regenerated creatures, and the pledge of
	the ultimate regeneration of the creation, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19">Romans 8:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>, where also the Spirit,
	the divine agent of the believer's regeneration, is termed "the
	first-fruits," that is, the earnest that the regeneration now
	begun in the soul, shall at last extend to the body too, and to the
	lower parts of creation. Of all God's visible creatures, believers
	are the noblest part, and like the legal "first-fruits,"
	sanctify the rest; for this reason they are much tried now.</p>
