<p><b>19. Wherefore</b>—as your evil is
	of yourselves, but your good from God. However, the oldest
	manuscripts and versions read thus: "YE
	KNOW IT (so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:17">Hebrews 12:17</span>), my beloved brethren;
	BUT (consequently) let
	every man be swift to hear," that is, docile in receiving "the
	word of truth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:18">James 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:21">James 1:21</span>). The true method of
	hearing is treated in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:21-27">James 1:21-27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1-26">James 2:1-26</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>slow to speak</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:19">Proverbs 10:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+17:27">Proverbs 17:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+17:28">Proverbs 17:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+5:2">Ecclesiastes 5:2</span>). A good way of escaping
	one kind of temptation arising from ourselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+5:2- :">Ecclesiastes 5:2- :</span>). Slow to speak authoritatively as a master or teacher of
	others (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:1">James 3:1</span>): a
	common Jewish fault: slow also to speak such hasty things of God, as
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:13">James 1:13</span>. Two ears are given
	to us, the rabbis observe, but only one tongue: the ears are open and
	exposed, whereas the tongue is walled in behind the teeth. 
	</p>
<p><b>slow to wrath</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:13">James 3:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:14">James 3:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:5">James 4:5</span>).
	Slow in becoming heated by debate: another Jewish fault (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:5- :">James 4:5- :</span>), to which much <i>speaking</i> tends. TITTMANN
	thinks not so much "wrath" is meant, as an <i>indignant</i>
	feeling of <i>fretfulness</i> under the calamities to which the whole
	of human life is exposed; this accords with the "divers
	temptations" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>.
	Hastiness of temper hinders hearing God's word; so Naaman, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:11">2 Kings 5:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:28">Luke 4:28</span>.</p>
