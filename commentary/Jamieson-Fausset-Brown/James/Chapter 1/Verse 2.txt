2. My brethren—a phrase often
	found in James, marking community of nation and of faith. 
	all joy—cause for the
	highest joy [GROTIUS].
	Nothing but joy [PISCATOR].
	Count all "divers temptations" to be each
	matter of joy [BENGEL].
	fall into—unexpectedly,
	so as to be encompassed by them (so the original Greek).
	temptations—not in the
	limited sense of allurements to sin, but trials or distresses
	of any kind which test and purify the Christian character. Compare
	"tempt," that is, try,  :-. Some of those to whom James writes were "sick,"
	or otherwise "afflicted" ( :-). Every possible trial to the child of God is a masterpiece
	of strategy of the Captain of his salvation for his good.
