<p><b>20.</b> Man's angry zeal in
	debating, as if jealous for the honor of God's righteousness, is far
	from working that which is really righteousness in God's sight. True
	"righteousness is sown in peace," not in wrath (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The oldest and best reading means "worketh,"
	that is, <i>practiceth</i> not: the received reading is "worketh,"
	<i>produceth</i> not.</p>
