	Joshua's filthy garments, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:3">Zechariah 3:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:5">Zechariah 3:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span>.
	"Filthiness" is cleansed away by hearing the word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14- :">Revelation 7:14- :</span>).

<p><b>superfluity of

	spirit implied in "wrath," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:19">James 1:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:20">James 1:20</span>), which arises from
	<i>malice</i> (our natural, <i>evil disposition</i> towards one
	another). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:1">1 Peter 2:1</span> has the very

	"<i>Faulty</i> excess" [BENGEL]
	is not strong enough. Superfluous excess in <i>speaking</i> is also
	reprobated as "coming of <i>evil</i>" (the <i>Greek</i> is
	akin to the word for "naughtiness" here) in the Sermon on
	the Mount (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:37">Matthew 5:37</span>), with which
	James' Epistle is so connected.

	the opposite to "wrath" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:37- :">Matthew 5:37- :</span>): answering to "as new-born babes" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:37- :">Matthew 5:37- :</span>). <i>Meekness,</i> I think, includes also a childlike,
	<i>docile, humble,</i> as well as an uncontentious, spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+25:9">Psalms 25:9</span>;

<p><b>engrafted word</b>—the
	Gospel <i>word,</i> whose proper attribute is to be <i>engrafted</i>
	by the Holy Spirit, so as to be livingly incorporated with the
	believer, as the fruitful shoot is with the wild natural stock on
	which it is engrafted. The law came to man only from without, and
	admonished him of his duty. The Gospel is <i>engrafted</i> inwardly,
	and so fulfils the ultimate design of the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+6:6">Deuteronomy 6:6</span>;

	ALFORD translates, "The
	<i>implanted</i> word," referring to the parable of the sower
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1-23">Matthew 13:1-23</span>). I prefer
	<i>English Version.</i>
