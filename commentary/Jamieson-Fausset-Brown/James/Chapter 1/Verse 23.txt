<p><b>not a doer</b>—more

	"the countenance of his birth": the face he was born with.
	As a man may behold his <i>natural face</i> in a mirror, so the
	hearer may perceive his <i>moral</i> visage in God's Word. This
	faithful portraiture of man's soul in Scripture, is the strongest

	glory, as well as our natural vileness.</p>
