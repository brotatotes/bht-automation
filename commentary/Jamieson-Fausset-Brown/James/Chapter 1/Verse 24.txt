<p><b>24. beholdeth</b>—more literally,
	"he <i>contemplated</i> himself and hath <i>gone</i> his way,"
	that is, no sooner has he contemplated his image than he is gone his
	way (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:11">James 1:11</span>). "Contemplate"
	answers to hearing the word: "goeth his way," to relaxing
	the attention after hearing—letting the mind go elsewhere, and the

	follows [ALFORD] (Compare

	here, and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:23">James 1:23</span>, implies
	that, though cursory, yet some knowledge of one's self, at least for
	the time, is imparted in hearing the word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:23- :">James 1:23- :</span>).
