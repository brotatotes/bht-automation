<p><b>25. looketh into</b>—literally,
	"stoopeth down to take a close look into." Peers into:
	stronger than "beholdeth," or "contemplated," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. A blessed curiosity if it be efficacious in bearing fruit

<p><b>perfect law of liberty</b>—the
	Gospel rule of life, perfect and perfecting (as shown in the Sermon
	on the Mount, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:48">Matthew 5:48</span>), and
	making us truly walk at liberty (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:48- :">Matthew 5:48- :</span>, <i>Church of England Prayer Book Version</i>). Christians
	are to aim at a higher standard of holiness than was generally
	understood under the law. The <i>principle</i> of love takes the
	place of the letter of the law, so that by the Spirit they are free
	from the yoke of sin, and free to obey by spontaneous instinct
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:8">James 2:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:10">James 2:10</span>;

	The law is thus <i>not made void,</i> but <i>fulfilled.</i>

<p><b>continueth therein</b>—contrasted
	with "goeth his way," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:16- :">1 Peter 2:16- :</span>, continues both <i>looking into</i> the mirror of God's
