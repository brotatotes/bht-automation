25. looketh into—literally,
	"stoopeth down to take a close look into." Peers into:
	stronger than "beholdeth," or "contemplated,"  :-. A blessed curiosity if it be efficacious in bearing fruit
	[BENGEL]. 
	perfect law of liberty—the
	Gospel rule of life, perfect and perfecting (as shown in the Sermon
	on the Mount, Matthew 5:48), and
	making us truly walk at liberty (Matthew 5:48- :, Church of England Prayer Book Version). Christians
	are to aim at a higher standard of holiness than was generally
	understood under the law. The principle of love takes the
	place of the letter of the law, so that by the Spirit they are free
	from the yoke of sin, and free to obey by spontaneous instinct
	(James 2:8; James 2:10;
	James 2:12; John 8:31-36;
	John 15:14; John 15:15;
	compare 1 Corinthians 7:22; Galatians 5:1;
	Galatians 5:13; 1 Peter 2:16).
	The law is thus not made void, but fulfilled.
continueth therein—contrasted
	with "goeth his way," 1 Peter 2:16- :, continues both looking into the mirror of God's
	word, and doing its precepts. 
	doer of the work—rather,
	"a doer of work" [ALFORD],
	an actual worker. 
	blessed in his deed—rather,
	"in his doing"; in the very doing there is
	blessedness (Psalms 19:11).
