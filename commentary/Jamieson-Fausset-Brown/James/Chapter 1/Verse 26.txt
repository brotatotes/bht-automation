religious . . . religion—The
	Greek expresses the external service or exercise of
	religion, "godliness" being the internal soul of it.
	"If any man think himself to be (so the Greek)
	religious, that is, observant of the offices of religion, let
	him know these consist not so much in outward observances, as in such
	acts of mercy and humble piety (Micah 6:7;
	Micah 6:8) as visiting the
	fatherless, c., and keeping one's self unspotted from the
	world" (Matthew 23:23).
	James does not mean that these offices are the great
	essentials, or sum total of religion but that, whereas the law
	service was merely ceremonial, the very services of the Gospel
	consist in acts of mercy and holiness, and it has light for its
	garment, its very robe being righteousness [TRENCH].
	The Greek word is only found in Matthew 23:23- :, "after the straitest sect of our religion I
	lived a Pharisee." Colossians 2:18,
	"worshipping of angels." 
	bridleth not . . .
	tongue—Discretion in speech is better than fluency of speech
	(compare James 3:2; James 3:3).
	Compare Psalms 39:1. God alone can
	enable us to do so. James, in treating of the law, naturally notices
	this sin. For they who are free from grosser sins, and even bear the
	outward show of sanctity, will often exalt themselves by detracting
	others under the pretense of zeal, while their real motive is love of
	evil-speaking [CALVIN]. 
	heart—It and the tongue
	act and react on one another.
