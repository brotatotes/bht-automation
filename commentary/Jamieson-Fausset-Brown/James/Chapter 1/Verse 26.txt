<p><b>religious . . . religion</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> expresses the <i>external service</i> or exercise <i>of
	religion,</i> "godliness" being the internal soul of it.
	"If any man <i>think himself to be</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>)
	religious, that is, <i>observant of the offices of religion,</i> let
	him know these consist not so much in outward observances, as in such
	acts of mercy and humble piety (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+6:7">Micah 6:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+6:8">Micah 6:8</span>) as <i>visiting the
	fatherless,</i> c., and <i>keeping one's self unspotted from the
	world</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23">Matthew 23:23</span>).
	James does not mean that these <i>offices</i> are the great
	essentials, or sum total of religion but that, whereas the law
	service was merely ceremonial, the very <i>services</i> of the Gospel
	consist in acts of mercy and holiness, and it has light for its
	<i>garment,</i> its very <i>robe</i> being righteousness [TRENCH].
	The <i>Greek</i> word is only found in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:23- :">Matthew 23:23- :</span>, "after the straitest sect of our <i>religion</i> I
	lived a Pharisee." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>,
	"<i>worshipping</i> of angels."

	tongue</b>—Discretion in speech is better than fluency of speech
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:2">James 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:3">James 3:3</span>).
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:1">Psalms 39:1</span>. God alone can
	enable us to do so. James, in treating of the law, naturally notices
	this sin. For they who are free from grosser sins, and even bear the
	outward show of sanctity, will often exalt themselves by detracting
	others under the pretense of zeal, while their real motive is love of
	evil-speaking [CALVIN].
