<p><b>27. Pure . . . and undefiled</b>—"Pure"
	is that love which has in it <i>no foreign admixture,</i> as
	self-deceit and hypocrisy. "Undefiled" is the means of its
	being "pure" [TITTMANN].
	"Pure" expresses the <i>positive,</i> "undefiled"
	the <i>negative</i> side of religious service; just as <i>visiting
	the fatherless and widow</i> is the active, <i>keeping himself
	unspotted from the world,</i> the passive side of religious duty.
	This is the nobler shape that our religious exercises take, instead
	of the ceremonial offices of the law.

<p><b>before God and the
	Father</b>—literally, "before Him who is (our) God and
	Father." God is so called to imply that if we would be like our
	Father, it is not by fasting, c., for He does none of these things,
	but in being "merciful as our Father is merciful"
	[CHRYSOSTOM]. 
	</p>
<p><b>visit</b>—in sympathy and
	kind offices to alleviate their distresses. 
	</p>
<p><b>the fatherless</b>—whose
	"Father" is God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:5">Psalms 68:5</span>)
	peculiarly helpless. 
	</p>
<p><b>and</b>—not in the <i>Greek;</i>
	so close is the connection between active works of mercy to others,
	and the maintenance of personal unworldliness of spirit, word, and
	deed; no copula therefore is needed. Religion in its rise interests
	us about <i>ourselves</i> in its progress, about our <i>fellow
	creatures:</i> in its highest stage, about the honor of God. 
	</p>
<p><b>keep himself</b>—with
	jealous watchfulness, at the same time praying and depending on God
	as alone able to keep us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:15">John 17:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:24">Judges 1:24</span>).</p>
