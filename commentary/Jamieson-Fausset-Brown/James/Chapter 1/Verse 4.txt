<p><b>4.</b> Let endurance have a perfect
	<i>work</i> (taken out of the previous "<i>worketh</i> patience"
	or endurance), that is, have its <i>full effect,</i> by showing the
	most perfect degree of endurance, namely, "joy in bearing the
	cross" [MENOCHIUS],
	and enduring to the end (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:22">Matthew 10:22</span>)
	[CALVIN]. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye may be perfect</b>—fully
	developed in all the attributes of a Christian character. For this
	there is required "joy" [BENGEL],
	as part of the "perfect work" of probation. The work of God
	in a man is the man. If God's teachings by patience have had a
	perfect work in you, <i>you</i> are perfect [ALFORD].

<p><b>entire</b>—that which has
	all <i>its parts complete, wanting no integral part;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:22- :">Matthew 10:22- :</span>, "your whole (literally, 'entire') spirit, soul, and
	body"; as "perfect" implies <i>without a blemish in
	its parts.</i></p>
