<p><b>5.</b> <i>English Version</i> omits
	"But," which the <i>Greek</i> has, and which is important.
	"But (as this <i>perfect entireness wanting nothing</i> is no
	easy attainment) if any," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>lack</b>—rather, as the
	<i>Greek</i> word is repeated after James's manner, from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "<i>wanting</i> nothing," translate, "If any
	of you <i>want</i> wisdom," namely, the wisdom whereby ye may
	"count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations,"
	and "let patience have her perfect work." This "wisdom"
	is shown in its effects in detail, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The highest wisdom, which governs patience alike in poverty
	and riches, is described in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:9">James 1:9</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:10">James 1:10</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>ask</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:10- :">James 1:10- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>liberally</b>—So the <i>Greek</i>
	is rendered by <i>English Version.</i> It is rendered <i>with
	simplicity,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:8">Romans 12:8</span>. God
	gives without adding aught which may take off from the graciousness
	of the gift [ALFORD]. God
	requires the same "simplicity" in His children ("eye .
	. . single," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:22">Matthew 6:22</span>,
	literally, "simple"). 
	</p>
<p><b>upbraideth not</b>—an
	illustration of God's giving <i>simply.</i> He gives to the humble
	suppliant without upbraiding him with his past sin and ingratitude,
	or his future abuse of God's goodness. The Jews pray, "Let me
	not have need of the gifts of men, whose gifts are few, but their
	upbraidings manifold; but give me out of Thy large and full hand."
	Compare Solomon's prayer for "wisdom," and God's gift above
	what he asked, though God foresaw his future abuse of His goodness
	would deserve very differently. James has before his eye the Sermon
	on the Mount (see my <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:22- :">Matthew 6:22- :</span>).
	God hears every true prayer and grants either the thing asked, or
	else something better than it; as a good physician consults for his
	patient's good better by denying something which the latter asks not
	for his good, than by conceding a temporary gratification to his
	hurt.</p>
