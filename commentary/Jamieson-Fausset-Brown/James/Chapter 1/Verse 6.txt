<p><b>6. ask in faith</b>—that is, the
	persuasion that God can and will give. James begins and ends with
	<i>faith.</i> In the middle of the Epistle he removes the hindrances
	to faith and shows its true character [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>wavering</b>—between belief
	and unbelief. Compare the case of the Israelites, who seemed to
	partly believe in God's power, but leaned more to unbelief by
	"limiting" it. On the other hand, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:20">Acts 10:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:20">Romans 4:20</span> ("<i>staggered not</i>
	. . . through unbelief," literally, as here, "<i>wavered
	not</i>"); <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:8">1 Timothy 2:8</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>like a wave of the sea</b>—
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+57:20">Isaiah 57:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:14">Ephesians 4:14</span>,
	where the same <i>Greek</i> word occurs for "tossed to and fro,"
	as is here translated, "driven with the wind." 
	</p>
<p><b>driven with the wind</b>—from
	without. 
	</p>
<p><b>tossed</b>—from within, by
	its own instability [BENGEL].
	At one time cast on the shore of faith and hope, at another rolled
	back into the abyss of unbelief; at one time raised to the height of
	worldly pride, at another tossed in the sands of despair and
	affliction [WIESINGER].</p>
