<p><b>that man</b>—such a

<p><b>think</b>—Real <i>faith</i>
	is something more than a mere <i>thinking</i> or <i>surmise.</i>

<p><b>anything</b>—namely, of the
	things that he prays for: he does receive many things from God, food,
	raiment, &amp;c., but these are the general gifts of His providence:
	of the things specially granted in answer to prayer, the waverer
	shall not receive "anything," much less wisdom.</p>
