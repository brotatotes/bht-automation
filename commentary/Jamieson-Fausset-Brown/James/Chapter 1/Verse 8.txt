<p><b>8. double-minded</b>â€”literally,
	"double-souled," the one soul directed towards God, the
	other to something else. The <i>Greek</i> favors ALFORD'S
	translation, "He (the waverer, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) is a man double-minded, unstable," c. or better,
	BEZA'S. The words in this
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:8">James 1:8</span> are in apposition with
	"that man," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:7">James 1:7</span>;
	thus the "us," which is not in the original, will not need
	to be supplied, "A man double-minded, unstable in all his ways!"
	The word for "double-minded" is found here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:7- :">James 1:7- :</span>, for the first time in Greek literature. It is not a
	<i>hypocrite</i> that is meant, but a <i>fickle,</i> "wavering"
	man, as the context shows. It is opposed to <i>the single eye</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:7- :">James 1:7- :</span>).</p>
