	<i>double-mindedness</i> is that Christian <i>simplicity</i> of
	spirit whereby the "brother," low in outward circumstances,
	may "rejoice" (answering to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) "in that he is exalted," namely, by being
	accounted a son and heir of God, his very sufferings being a pledge
	of his coming glory and crown (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and the rich may rejoice "in that he is made low,"
	by being stripped of his goods for Christ's sake [MENOCHIUS]
	or in that he is made, by sanctified trials, lowly in spirit, which
	is true matter for rejoicing [GOMARUS].
	The design of the Epistle is to reduce all things to an equable
	footing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:1">James 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:13">James 5:13</span>).

	"the brother" [BENGEL].</p>
