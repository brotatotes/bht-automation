<p><i><b>the Lord</b></i><b> of

	believers, alike rich and poor, derive all their glory from their
	union with Him, "the Lord of glory," not from external
	advantages of worldly fortune, the sin in question is peculiarly
	inconsistent with His "faith." BENGEL,
	making no ellipsis of "the Lord," explains "glory"
	as in apposition with Christ who is THE
	GLORY (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32">Luke 2:32</span>); the
	true Shekinah glory of the temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+2:32- :">Luke 2:32- :</span>). <i>English Version</i> is simpler. The glory of Christ
	resting on the poor believer should make him be regarded as highly by
	"brethren" as his richer brother; nay, more so, if the poor
	believer has more of Christ's spirit than the rich brother.
