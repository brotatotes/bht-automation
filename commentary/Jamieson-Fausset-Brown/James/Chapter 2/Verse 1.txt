1. brethren—The equality of
	all Christians as "brethren," forms the groundwork of the
	admonition. 
	the faith of . . .
	Christ—that is, the Christian faith. James grounds Christian
	practice on Christian faith. 
	the Lord of
	glory—So 1 Corinthians 2:8. As all
	believers, alike rich and poor, derive all their glory from their
	union with Him, "the Lord of glory," not from external
	advantages of worldly fortune, the sin in question is peculiarly
	inconsistent with His "faith." BENGEL,
	making no ellipsis of "the Lord," explains "glory"
	as in apposition with Christ who is THE
	GLORY (Luke 2:32); the
	true Shekinah glory of the temple (Luke 2:32- :). English Version is simpler. The glory of Christ
	resting on the poor believer should make him be regarded as highly by
	"brethren" as his richer brother; nay, more so, if the poor
	believer has more of Christ's spirit than the rich brother. 
	with respect of
	persons—literally, "in respectings of persons";
	"in" the practice of partial preferences of persons in
	various ways and on various occasions.
