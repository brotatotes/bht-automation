<p><b>10.</b> The best manuscripts read,
	"Whosoever <i>shall have kept</i> the whole law, and yet <i>shall
	have offended</i> (literally, 'stumbled'; not so strong as 'fall,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) in one (point; here, the <i>respecting of persons</i>), is
	(hereby) become guilty of all." The law is one seamless garment
	which is rent if you but rend a part; or a musical harmony which is
	spoiled if there be one discordant note [TIRINUS];
	or a golden chain whose completeness is broken if you break one link
	[GATAKER]. You thus break
	<i>the whole law,</i> though not the whole of the law, because you
	offend against <i>love,</i> which is the fulfilling of the law. If
	any part of a man be leprous, the whole man is judged to be a leper.
	God requires perfect, not partial, obedience. We are not to choose
	out parts of the law to keep, which suit our whim, while we neglect
	others.</p>
