10. The best manuscripts read,
	"Whosoever shall have kept the whole law, and yet shall
	have offended (literally, 'stumbled'; not so strong as 'fall,'  :-) in one (point; here, the respecting of persons), is
	(hereby) become guilty of all." The law is one seamless garment
	which is rent if you but rend a part; or a musical harmony which is
	spoiled if there be one discordant note [TIRINUS];
	or a golden chain whose completeness is broken if you break one link
	[GATAKER]. You thus break
	the whole law, though not the whole of the law, because you
	offend against love, which is the fulfilling of the law. If
	any part of a man be leprous, the whole man is judged to be a leper.
	God requires perfect, not partial, obedience. We are not to choose
	out parts of the law to keep, which suit our whim, while we neglect
	others.
