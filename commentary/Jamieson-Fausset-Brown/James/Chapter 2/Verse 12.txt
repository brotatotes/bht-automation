	James 1:19; James 1:26;

	(James 1:25); that is, the Gospel
	law of love, which is not a law of external constraint, but of

	through God's mercy, frees us from the curse of the law, that
	henceforth we should be free to love and obey willingly. If we will
	not in turn practice the law of love to our neighbor, that law of
	grace condemns us still more heavily than the old law, which spake
	nothing but wrath to him who offended in the least particular (James 1:25- :). Compare Matthew 18:32-35;
	John 12:48; Revelation 6:16,
	"Wrath of the (merciful) Lamb."
