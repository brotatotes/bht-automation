13. The converse of, "Blessed
	are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy" ( :-). Translate, "The judgment (which is coming on
	all of us) shall be without mercy to him who hath showed no mercy."
	It shall be such toward every one as every one shall have been

	here corresponds to "love,"  :-. 
	mercy rejoiceth against
	judgmentâ€”Mercy, so far from fearing judgment in the case of its
	followers, actually glorifieth against it, knowing that it
	cannot condemn them. Not that their mercy is the ground of
	their acquittal, but the mercy of God in Christ towards them,
	producing mercy on their part towards their fellow men, makes them to
	triumph over judgment, which all in themselves otherwise
	deserve.
