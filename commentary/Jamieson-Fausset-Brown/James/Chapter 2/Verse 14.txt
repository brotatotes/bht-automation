<p><b>14.</b> James here, passing from the
	particular case of "mercy" or "love" violated by
	"respect of persons," notwithstanding profession of the
	"faith of our Lord Jesus" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), combats the Jewish tendency (transplanted into their
	Christianity) to substitute a lifeless, inoperative acquaintance with
	the letter of the law, for change of heart to practical holiness, as
	if justification could be thereby attained (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:3">Romans 2:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:13">Romans 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:23">Romans 2:23</span>).
	It seems hardly likely but that James had seen Paul's Epistles,
	considering that he uses the same phrases and examples (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:21">James 2:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:23">James 2:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:25">James 2:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:3">Romans 4:3</span>;

	and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:14">James 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:24">James 2:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:28">Romans 3:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span>).
	Whether James individually designed it or not, the Holy Spirit by him
	combats not Paul, but those who abuse Paul's doctrine. The teaching
	of both alike is inspired, and is therefore to be received without
	wresting of words; but each has a different class to deal with; Paul,
	self-justiciaries; James, Antinomian advocates of a mere notional
	faith. Paul urged as strongly as James the need of works as evidences
	of faith, especially in the later Epistles, when many were abusing
	the doctrine of faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+2:14">Titus 2:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+3:8">Titus 3:8</span>). "Believing and
	doing are blood relatives" [RUTHERFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>What </b><i><b>doth it</b></i><b>
	profit</b>—literally, "What is the profit?" 
	</p>
<p><b>though a man say</b>—James'
	expression is not, "If a man have faith," but "if a
	man <i>say</i> he hath faith"; referring to a mere <i>profession</i>
	of faith, such as was usually made at baptism. Simon Magus so
	"<i>believed</i> and was baptized," and yet had "neither
	part nor lot in this matter," for his "heart," as his
	words and works evinced, was not right in the sight of God. ALFORD
	wrongly denies that "say" is emphatic. The illustration,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:16">James 2:16</span>, proves it is: "If
	one of you <i>say</i>" to a naked brother, "Be ye warmed,
	notwithstanding ye give not those things needful." The
	inoperative <i>profession</i> of sympathy answering to the
	inoperative <i>profession</i> of faith. 
	</p>
<p><b>can faith save him</b>—rather,
	"can such a faith (literally, 'the faith') save him?"—<i>the</i>
	faith you pretend to: the empty name of boasted faith, contrasted
	with true fruit-producing faith. So that which self-deceivers claim
	is called "wisdom," though not true wisdom, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:16- :">James 2:16- :</span>. The "him" also in the <i>Greek</i> is emphatic;
	the particular man who professes faith without having the works which
	evidence its vitality.</p>
