<p><b>16.</b> The habit of receiving
	passively sentimental impressions from sights of woe without carrying
	them out into active habits only hardens the heart. 
	</p>
<p><b>one of you</b>—James brings
	home the case to his hearers individually. 
	</p>
<p><b>Depart in peace</b>—as if
	all their wants were satisfied by the mere words addressed to them.
	The same words in the mouth of Christ, whose faith they said they

<p><b>be . . . warmed</b>—with
	clothing, instead of being as heretofore "naked" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:15">James 2:15</span>;

<p><b>what doth it
	profit</b>—concluding with the same question as at the beginning,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:14">James 2:14</span>. Just retribution:
	kind professions unaccompanied with corresponding acts, as they are
	of no "profit" to the needy object of them, so are of no
	profit to the professor himself. So faith consisting in mere
	profession is unacceptable to God, the object of faith, and
	profitless to the possessor.</p>
