<p><b>17. faith . . . being alone</b>â€”ALFORD
	joins "is dead <i>in itself.</i>" So BENGEL,
	"If the works which living faith produces have no existence, it
	is a proof that faith itself (literally, 'in respect to itself') has
	no existence; that is, that what one boasts of as faith, is <i>dead.</i>"
	"Faith" is said to be "dead <i>in itself,</i>"
	because when it has works it is <i>alive,</i> and it is discerned to
	be so, not in respect to its works, but in respect to <i>itself.
	English Version,</i> if retained, must not be understood to mean that
	faith can exist "alone" (that is, severed from works), but
	thus: Even so <i>presumed</i> faith, if it have not works, is dead,
	being by itself "alone," that is, severed from works of
	charity; just as the body would be "dead" if alone, that
	is, severed from the spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). So ESTIUS.</p>
