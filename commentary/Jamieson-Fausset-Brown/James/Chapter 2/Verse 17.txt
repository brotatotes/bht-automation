17. faith . . . being aloneâ€”ALFORD
	joins "is dead in itself." So BENGEL,
	"If the works which living faith produces have no existence, it
	is a proof that faith itself (literally, 'in respect to itself') has
	no existence; that is, that what one boasts of as faith, is dead."
	"Faith" is said to be "dead in itself,"
	because when it has works it is alive, and it is discerned to
	be so, not in respect to its works, but in respect to itself.
	English Version, if retained, must not be understood to mean that
	faith can exist "alone" (that is, severed from works), but
	thus: Even so presumed faith, if it have not works, is dead,
	being by itself "alone," that is, severed from works of
	charity; just as the body would be "dead" if alone, that
	is, severed from the spirit ( :-). So ESTIUS.
