<p><b>18.</b> "<i>But</i> some <i>one
	will</i> say": so the <i>Greek.</i> This verse continues the
	argument from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:14">James 2:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:16">James 2:16</span>.
	One may <i>say</i> he has faith though he have not works. Suppose one
	were to <i>say</i> to a naked brother, "Be warmed," without
	giving him needful clothing. "<i>But</i> someone (entertaining
	views of the need of faith having works joined to it) will say (in
	opposition to the 'say' of the professor)." 
	</p>
<p><b>show me thy faith without thy
	works</b>â€”if thou canst; but thou canst not SHOW,
	that is, <i>manifest</i> or <i>evidence</i> thy alleged (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:16- :">James 2:16- :</span>, "say") faith without works. "Show" does
	not mean here to <i>prove</i> to me, but <i>exhibit</i> to me. Faith
	is unseen save by God. To <i>show</i> faith to man, works in some
	form or other are needed: we are justified judicially by God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:16- :">James 2:16- :</span>); meritoriously, by Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:16- :">James 2:16- :</span>); mediately, by faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:16- :">James 2:16- :</span>); evidentially, by works. The question here is not as to the
	<i>ground</i> on which believers are justified, but about the
	<i>demonstration</i> of their faith: so in the case of Abraham. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:16- :">James 2:16- :</span> it is written, God did <i>tempt</i> Abraham, that is, put to
	the <i>test of demonstration</i> the reality of his faith, not for
	the satisfaction of God, who already knew it well, but to <i>demonstrate</i>
	it before men. The offering of Isaac at that time, quoted here, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:16- :">James 2:16- :</span>, formed no part of the <i>ground</i> of his justification,
	for he was justified previously on his simply believing in the
	promise of spiritual heirs, that is, believers, numerous as the
	stars. He was then justified: that justification was <i>showed</i> or
	manifested by his offering Isaac forty years after. That work of
	faith <i>demonstrated,</i> but did not contribute to his
	justification. The tree <i>shows</i> its life by its fruits, but it
	was alive before either fruits or even leaves appeared.</p>
