	self-deceiving claimant to faith without works.

<p><b>that there is one God</b>—rather,
	"that God is one": God's <i>existence,</i> however, is also
	asserted. The fundamental article of the creed of Jews and Christians
	alike, and the point of faith on which especially the former boasted
	themselves, as distinguishing them from the Gentiles, and hence
	adduced by James here.

<p><b>thou doest well</b>—so far
	good. But unless thy faith goes farther than an assent to this truth,
	"the evil spirits (literally, 'demons': 'devil' is the term
	restricted to <i>Satan,</i> their head) believe" so far in
	common with thee, "and (so far from being saved by such a faith)
	shudder (so the <i>Greek</i>)," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:29">Matthew 8:29</span>;
