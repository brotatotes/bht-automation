<p><b>assembly</b>—literally,
	"synagogue"; this, the latest honorable use, and the only
	<i>Christian</i> use of the term in the New Testament, occurs in
	James's Epistle, the apostle who maintained to the latest possible
	moment the bonds between the Jewish synagogue and the Christian
	Church. Soon the continued resistance of the truth by the Jews led
	Christians to leave the term to them exclusively (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The "synagogue" implies a mere <i>assembly</i> or
	congregation not necessarily united by any common tie. "Church,"
	a people bound together by mutual ties and laws, though often it may
	happen that the members are not assembled [TRENCH
	and VITRINGA]. Partly from
	James' Hebrew tendencies, partly from the Jewish Christian churches
	retaining most of the Jewish forms, this term "synagogue"
	is used here instead of the Christian term "Church"
	(<i>ecclesia,</i> derived from a root, "called out,"
	implying the union of its members in spiritual bonds, independent of
	space, and called out into separation from the world); an undesigned
	coincidence and mark of truth. The people in the Jewish synagogue sat
	according to their rank, those of the same trade together. The
	introduction of this custom into Jewish Christian places of worship
	is here reprobated by James. Christian churches were built like the
	synagogues, the holy table in the east end of the former, as the ark
	was in the latter; the <i>desk</i> and <i>pulpit</i> were the chief
	articles of furniture in both alike. This shows the error of
	comparing the Church to the temple, and the ministry to the
	priesthood; the temple is represented by the whole body of
	worshippers; the church building was formed on the model of the
	synagogue. See VITRINGA
	[<i>Synagogue and Temple</i>].
