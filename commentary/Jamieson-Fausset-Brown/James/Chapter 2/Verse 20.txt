<p><b>20. wilt thou know</b>—"Vain"
	men are not <i>willing</i> to know, since they have no wish to "do"
	the will of God. James beseeches such a one to lay aside his perverse
	<i>unwillingness</i> to know what is palpable to all who are willing
	to do. 
	</p>
<p><b>vain</b>—who deceivest
	thyself with a delusive hope, resting on an unreal faith. 
	</p>
<p><b>without works</b>—The
	<i>Greek,</i> implies <i>separate from the</i> works [ALFORD]
	which ought to flow from it if it were real. 
	</p>
<p><b>is dead</b>—Some of the
	best manuscripts read, "is idle," that is, unavailing to
	effect what you hope, namely, to save you.</p>
