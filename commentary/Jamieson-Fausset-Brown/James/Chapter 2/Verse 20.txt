20. wilt thou know—"Vain"
	men are not willing to know, since they have no wish to "do"
	the will of God. James beseeches such a one to lay aside his perverse
	unwillingness to know what is palpable to all who are willing
	to do. 
	vain—who deceivest
	thyself with a delusive hope, resting on an unreal faith. 
	without works—The
	Greek, implies separate from the works [ALFORD]
	which ought to flow from it if it were real. 
	is dead—Some of the
	best manuscripts read, "is idle," that is, unavailing to
	effect what you hope, namely, to save you.
