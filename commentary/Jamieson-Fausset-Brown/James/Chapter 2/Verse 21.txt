	works</b>—<i>evidentially,</i> and <i>before men</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:23">James 2:23</span>, James,

	that was counted to Abraham for righteousness in his justification
	before God.

<p><b>when he had offered</b>—rather,
	"when he offered" [ALFORD],
	that is, brought as an offering at the altar; not implying that he
