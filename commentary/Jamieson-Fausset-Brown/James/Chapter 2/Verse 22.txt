<p><b>22.</b> Or, "thou seest." 
	</p>
<p><b>how</b>—rather, "that."
	In the two clauses which follow, emphasize "faith" in the
	former, and "works" in the latter, to see the sense
	[BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>faith wrought with his
	works</b>—for it was <i>by faith</i> he offered his son. Literally,
	"was working (at the time) with his works." 
	</p>
<p><b>by works was faith made
	perfect</b>—not was <i>vivified,</i> but attained its <i>fully
	consummated development,</i> and is <i>shown to be real.</i> So "my
	strength is <i>made perfect</i> in weakness," that is, <i>exerts
	itself most perfectly,</i> shows how great it is [CAMERON]:
	so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:17">1 John 4:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+2:10">Hebrews 2:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9">Hebrews 5:9</span>. The germ really, from
	the first, contains in it the full-grown tree, but its perfection is
	not attained till it is matured fully. So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+5:9- :">Hebrews 5:9- :</span>, "Let patience have her <i>perfect work,</i>" that
	is, have its <i>full effect</i> by showing the most perfect degree of
	endurance, "that ye may be perfect," that is, <i>fully
	developed</i> in the <i>exhibition</i> of the Christian character.
	ALFORD explains, "Received
	its realization, was entirely exemplified and filled up." So
	Paul, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:12">Philippians 2:12</span>, "Work out
	your own salvation": the salvation was already in germ theirs in
	their free justification through faith. It needed to be <i>worked out</i>
	still to fully developed perfection in their life.</p>
