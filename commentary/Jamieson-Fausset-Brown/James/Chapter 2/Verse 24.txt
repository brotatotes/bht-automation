	only</b>â€”that is, by "faith without (<i>separated</i> from:
	<i>severed from</i>) works," its proper fruits (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Faith to justify must, from the first, include obedience
	in germ (to be developed subsequently), though the former alone is
	the ground of justification. The scion must be grafted on the stock
	that it may live; it must bring forth fruit to prove that it does
	live.</p>
