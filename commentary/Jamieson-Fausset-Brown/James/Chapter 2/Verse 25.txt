<p><b>25.</b> It is clear from the nature
	of Rahab's act, that it is not quoted to prove justification by works
	as such. She <i>believed</i> assuredly what her other countrymen
	disbelieved, and this in the face of every improbability that an
	unwarlike few would conquer well-armed numbers. In this belief she
	hid the spies at the risk of her life. Hence <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> names this as an example of <i>faith,</i> rather than of
	obedience. "By <i>faith</i> the <i>harlot</i> Rahab perished not
	with them that <i>believed</i> not." If an instance of obedience
	were wanting. Paul and James would hardly have quoted a woman of
	previously bad character, rather than the many moral and pious
	patriarchs. But as an example of free grace justifying men through an
	<i>operative,</i> as opposed to a mere verbal <i>faith,</i> none
	could be more suitable than a saved "harlot." As Abraham
	was an instance of an illustrious man and the father of the Jews, so
	Rahab is quoted as a woman, and one of abandoned character, and a
	Gentile, showing that justifying faith has been manifested in those
	of every class. The nature of the works alleged is such as to prove
	that James uses them only as <i>evidences of faith,</i> as contrasted
	with a mere verbal profession: not works of charity and piety, but
	works the value of which consisted solely in their being proofs of
	faith: they were faith expressed in act, synonymous with <i>faith</i>
	itself.
