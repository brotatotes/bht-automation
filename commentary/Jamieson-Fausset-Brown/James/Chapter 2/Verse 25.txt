25. It is clear from the nature
	of Rahab's act, that it is not quoted to prove justification by works
	as such. She believed assuredly what her other countrymen
	disbelieved, and this in the face of every improbability that an
	unwarlike few would conquer well-armed numbers. In this belief she
	hid the spies at the risk of her life. Hence  :- names this as an example of faith, rather than of
	obedience. "By faith the harlot Rahab perished not
	with them that believed not." If an instance of obedience
	were wanting. Paul and James would hardly have quoted a woman of
	previously bad character, rather than the many moral and pious
	patriarchs. But as an example of free grace justifying men through an
	operative, as opposed to a mere verbal faith, none
	could be more suitable than a saved "harlot." As Abraham
	was an instance of an illustrious man and the father of the Jews, so
	Rahab is quoted as a woman, and one of abandoned character, and a
	Gentile, showing that justifying faith has been manifested in those
	of every class. The nature of the works alleged is such as to prove
	that James uses them only as evidences of faith, as contrasted
	with a mere verbal profession: not works of charity and piety, but
	works the value of which consisted solely in their being proofs of
	faith: they were faith expressed in act, synonymous with faith
	itself.
