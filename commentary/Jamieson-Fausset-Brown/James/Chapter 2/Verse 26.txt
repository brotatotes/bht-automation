<p><b>26.</b> Faith is a spiritual thing:
	works are material. Hence we might expect <i>faith</i> to answer to
	the <i>spirit, works to the body.</i> But James reverses this. He
	therefore does not mean that faith in all cases answers to the body;
	but the FORM <i>of faith</i>
	without <i>the working reality</i> answers to the <i>body</i> without
	the <i>animating spirit.</i> It does not follow that <i>living faith</i>
	derives its life from works, as the body derives its life from the
	animating spirit.</p>
