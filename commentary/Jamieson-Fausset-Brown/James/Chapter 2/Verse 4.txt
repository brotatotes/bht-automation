<p><b>4. Are ye not . . .
	partial</b>—literally, "Have ye not made distinctions" or
	"differences" (so as to prefer one to another)? So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>in yourselves</b>—in your
	minds, that is, according to your carnal inclination [GROTIUS].
	</p>
<p><b>are become judges of evil
	thoughts</b>—The <i>Greek</i> words for "judges" and for
	"partial," are akin in sound and meaning. A similar
	translation ought therefore to be given to both. Thus, either for
	"judges," c. translate, "<i>distinguishers</i> of
	(that is, <i>according to</i> your) evil thoughts" or, do ye not
	<i>partially judge between</i> men, and are become <i>evilly-thinking
	judges</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:21">Mark 7:21</span>)? The "evil
	thoughts" are in the judges themselves; as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:21- :">Mark 7:21- :</span>, the <i>Greek,</i> "judge of injustice," is
	translated, "unjust judge." ALFORD
	and WAHL translate, "Did
	ye not <i>doubt</i>" (respecting your <i>faith,</i> which is
	inconsistent with the distinctions made by you between rich and
	poor)? For the <i>Greek</i> constantly means "<i>doubt</i>"
	in all the New Testament. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:21- :">Mark 7:21- :</span>, "wavering." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:21">Matthew 21:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:20">Acts 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:20">Romans 4:20</span>,
	"staggered not." The same play on the same kindred words
	occurs in the <i>Greek</i> of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:10">Romans 14:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23">Romans 14:23</span>, "judge . . .
	doubteth." The same blame of being a judge, when one ought to be
	an obeyer, of the law is found in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:23- :">Romans 14:23- :</span>.</p>
