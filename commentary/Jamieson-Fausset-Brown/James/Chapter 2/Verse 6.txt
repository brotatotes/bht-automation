	poor contrasted with God's. 
	ye—Christians, from
	whom better things might have been expected; there is no marvel that
	men of the world do so. 
	despised—literally,
	"dishonored." To dishonor the poor is to dishonor those
	whom God honors, and so to invert the order of God [CALVIN].
	rich—as a class. 
	oppress—literally,
	"abuse their power against" you. 
	draw you—Translate, "is
	it not they (those very persons whom ye partially prefer,  :-) that drag you (namely, with violence)"
	[ALFORD]. 
	before . . . judgment
	seats—instituting persecutions for religion, as well as
	oppressive lawsuits, against you.
