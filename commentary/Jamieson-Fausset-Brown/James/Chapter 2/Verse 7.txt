7. "Is it not they that
	blaspheme?" c. as in James 2:6
	[ALFORD]. Rich heathen
	must here chiefly be meant for none others would directly blaspheme
	the name of Christ. Only indirectly rich Christians can be
	meant, who, by their inconsistency, caused His name to be
	blasphemed; so Ezekiel 36:21;
	Ezekiel 36:22; Romans 2:24.
	Besides, there were few rich Jewish Christians at Jerusalem (Romans 2:24- :). They who dishonor God's name by wilful and habitual sin,
	"take (or bear) the Lord's name in vain" (compare
	Proverbs 30:9; Exodus 20:7).
	that worthy nameâ€”which
	is "good before the Lord's saints" (Psalms 52:9;
	Psalms 54:6); which ye pray may be
	"hallowed" (Matthew 6:9),
	and "by which ye are called," literally, "which was
	invoked" or, "called upon by you" (compare Genesis 48:16;
	Isaiah 4:1, Margin; Isaiah 4:1- :), so that at your baptism "into the name"
	(so the Greek, Matthew 28:19)
	of Christ, ye became Christ's people (Matthew 28:19- :).
