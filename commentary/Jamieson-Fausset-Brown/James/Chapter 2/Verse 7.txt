<p><b>7.</b> "Is it not they that
	blaspheme?" c. as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:6">James 2:6</span>
	[ALFORD]. Rich heathen
	must here chiefly be meant for none others would directly blaspheme
	the name of Christ. Only <i>indirectly</i> rich Christians can be
	meant, who, by their inconsistency, <i>caused</i> His name <i>to be
	blasphemed;</i> so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:21">Ezekiel 36:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+36:22">Ezekiel 36:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:24">Romans 2:24</span>.
	Besides, there were few rich Jewish Christians at Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:24- :">Romans 2:24- :</span>). They who dishonor God's name by wilful and habitual sin,
	"take (or <i>bear</i>) the Lord's name in vain" (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+30:9">Proverbs 30:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+20:7">Exodus 20:7</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>that worthy name</b>â€”which
	is "good before the Lord's saints" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+52:9">Psalms 52:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+54:6">Psalms 54:6</span>); which ye pray may be
	"hallowed" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:9">Matthew 6:9</span>),
	and "by which ye are called," literally, "which was
	invoked" or, "called upon by you" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:16">Genesis 48:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:1">Isaiah 4:1</span>, <i>Margin;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:1- :">Isaiah 4:1- :</span>), so that at your baptism "<i>into</i> the name"
	(so the <i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>)
	of Christ, ye became Christ's people (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19- :">Matthew 28:19- :</span>).</p>
