8. The Greek may be
	translated, "If, however, ye fulfil," c., that is,
	as ALFORD, after ESTIUS,
	explains, "Still I do not say, hate the rich (for their
	oppressions) and drive them from your assemblies if you choose to
	observe the royal law . . . well and good; but respect of persons is
	a breach of that law." I think the translation is, "If in
	very deed (or 'indeed on the one hand') ye fulfil the
	royal law . . . ye do well, but if (on the other hand) ye respect
	persons, ye practice sin." The Jewish Christians boasted of, and
	rested in, the "law" (Acts 15:1;
	Acts 21:18-24; Romans 2:17;
	Galatians 2:12). To this the "indeed"
	alludes. "(Ye rest in the law): If indeed (then) ye
	fulfil it, ye do well; but if," c. 
	royal—the law that is
	king of all laws, being the sum and essence of the ten commandments.
	The great King, God, is love His law is the royal law of love, and
	that law, like Himself, reigns supreme. He "is no respecter of
	persons"; therefore to respect persons is at variance with Him
	and His royal law, which is at once a law of love and of liberty (Galatians 2:12- :). The law is the "whole"; "the (particular)
	Scripture" (Leviticus 19:18)
	quoted is a part. To break a part is to break the whole (Leviticus 19:18- :). 
	ye do well—being
	"blessed in your deed" ("doing," Margin)
	as a doer, not a forgetful hearer of the law (Leviticus 19:18- :).
