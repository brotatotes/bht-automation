<p><b>1. be not</b>—literally, "become
	not": taking the office too hastily, and of your own accord. 
	</p>
<p><b>many</b>—The office is a
	noble one; but few are fit for it. Few govern the tongue well (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and only such as can govern it are fit for the office;
	therefore, "teachers" ought not to be many. 
	</p>
<p><b>masters</b>—rather,
	"teachers." The Jews were especially prone to this
	presumption. The idea that faith (so called) without works (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) was all that is required, prompted "many" to
	set up as "teachers," as has been the case in all ages of
	the Church. At first all were allowed to teach in turns. Even their
	inspired gifts did not prevent liability to abuse, as James here
	implies: much more is this so when self-constituted teachers have no
	such miraculous gifts.

<p><b>knowing</b>—as all might
	know. 
	</p>
<p><b>we . . . greater
	condemnation</b>—James in a humble, conciliatory spirit, includes
	himself: if <i>we</i> teachers abuse the office, we shall receive
	greater condemnation than those who are mere hearers (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). CALVIN,
	like <i>English Version,</i> translates, "masters" that is,
	self-constituted <i>censors</i> and reprovers of others <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> accords with this view.</p>
