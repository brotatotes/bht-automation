<p><b>earthly</b>—opposed to
	<i>heavenly.</i> Distinct from "earthy," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:14- :">James 3:14- :</span>. <i>Earthly</i> is what is IN

<p><b>sensual</b>—literally,
	"animal-like": the wisdom of the "natural" (the
	same <i>Greek</i>) man, not born again of God; "not having the
	Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:19">Judges 1:19</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>devilish</b>—in its origin
	(from "hell," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:6">James 3:6</span>;
	not from God, the Giver of true wisdom, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:6- :">James 3:6- :</span>), and also in its character, which accords with its origin.
	Earthly, sensual, and devilish, answer to the three spiritual foes of
	man, the world, the flesh, and the devil.</p>
