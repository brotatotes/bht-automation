<p><b>17. first pure</b>—literally,
	"chaste," "sanctified": pure from all that is
	"earthly, sensual (animal), devilish" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). This is put, "<i>first of all,</i>" before
	"peaceable" because there is an unholy peace with the world
	which makes no distinction between clean and unclean. Compare
	"undefiled" and "unspotted from the world,"

	"<i>purified</i> . . . souls" (the same <i>Greek</i>).
	Ministers must not preach before a purifying change of heart,
	"Peace," where there is no peace. Seven (the perfect
	number) characteristic peculiarities of true wisdom are enumerated.
	<i>Purity</i> or <i>sanctity</i> is put first because it has respect
	both to God and to ourselves; the six that follow regard our fellow
	men. Our first concern is to have in ourselves sanctity; our second,
	to be at peace with men. 
	</p>
<p><b>gentle</b>—"forbearing";
	making allowances for others; lenient towards neighbors, as to the
	DUTIES they owe us. 
	</p>
<p><b>easy to be
	entreated</b>—literally, "easily persuaded," tractable;
	not harsh as to a neighbor's FAULTS.
	</p>
<p><b>full of mercy</b>—as to a
	neighbor's MISERIES. 
	</p>
<p><b>good fruits</b>—contrasted
	with "every evil work," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:22- :">1 Peter 1:22- :</span>.

<p><b>without partiality</b>—recurring

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:9">James 2:9</span>. ALFORD
	translates as the <i>Greek</i> is translated, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:9- :">James 2:9- :</span>, "wavering," "<i>without doubting.</i>"
	But thus there would be an epithet referring to <i>one's self</i>
	inserted amidst those referring to one's conduct towards others.
	<i>English Version</i> is therefore better. 
	</p>
<p><b>without hypocrisy</b>—Not
	as ALFORD explains from
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:22">James 1:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:26">James 1:26</span>,
	"Without deceiving yourselves" with the name without the
	reality of religion. For it must refer, like the rest of the six
	epithets, to our relations to others; our peaceableness and mercy
	towards others must be "without dissimulation."</p>
