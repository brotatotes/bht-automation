<p><b>18.</b> "The peaceable fruit of
	righteousness." He says "righteousness"; because it is
	itself the true wisdom. As in the case of the earthly wisdom, after
	the characteristic description came its <i>results;</i> so in this
	verse, in the case of the heavenly wisdom. There the results were
	present; here, future.

	"trees of righteousness." Anticipatory, that is, the seed
	whose "fruit," namely, "righteousness," shall be
	ultimately reaped, is now "sown in peace." "Righteousness,"
	now in germ, when fully developed as "fruit" shall be
	itself the everlasting <i>reward</i> of the righteous. As "sowing
	in peace" (compare "<i>sown in</i> dishonor," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:3- :">Isaiah 61:3- :</span>) produces the "fruit of righteousness," so
	conversely "the work" and "effect of righteousness"
	is "peace."

	"Peacemakers," not merely they who reconcile others, but
	who <i>work peace.</i> "Cultivate peace" [ESTIUS].
	Those truly wise towards God, while peaceable and tolerant towards
	their neighbors, yet make it their chief concern to sow
	righteousness, not cloaking men's sins, but reproving them with such
	peaceable moderation as to be the physicians, rather than the
	executioners, of sinners [CALVIN].</p>
