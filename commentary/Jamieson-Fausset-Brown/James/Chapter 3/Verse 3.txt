<p><b>3. Behold</b>â€”The best authorities
	read, "but if," that is, <i>Now whensoever</i> (in the
	case) of horses (such is the emphatic position of "horses"
	in the <i>Greek</i>) we put <i>the</i> bits (so literally, "the
	customary bits") into their mouths that they may obey us, we
	turn about <i>also</i> their whole body. This is to illustrate how
	<i>man</i> turns about his whole body with the little tongue. "The
	same applies to the pen, which is the substitute for the tongue among
	the absent" [BENGEL].</p>
