	of beasts—that is,
	quadrupeds of every disposition; as distinguished from the three

	continually being tamed, and hath been so long ago. 
	of mankind—rather, "by
	the nature of man": man's characteristic power taming that of
	the inferior animals. The dative in the Greek may imply, "Hath
	suffered itself to be brought into tame subjection TO the nature of
	men." So it shall be in the millennial world; even now man, by
	gentle firmness, may tame the inferior animal, and even elevate its
	nature.
