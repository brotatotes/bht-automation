<p><b>7. every kind</b>—rather, "every
	nature" (that is, natural disposition and characteristic power).
	</p>
<p><b>of beasts</b>—that is,
	quadrupeds of every disposition; as distinguished from the three
	other classes of creation, "birds, creeping things (the <i>Greek</i>
	includes not merely 'serpents,' as <i>English Version</i>), and
	things in the sea."

<p><b>is tamed, and hath been</b>—is
	continually being tamed, and hath been so long ago. 
	</p>
<p><b>of mankind</b>—rather, "by
	the nature of man": man's characteristic power taming that of
	the inferior animals. The dative in the <i>Greek</i> may imply, "Hath
	suffered itself to be brought into tame subjection TO the nature of
	men." So it shall be in the millennial world; even now man, by
	gentle firmness, may tame the inferior animal, and even elevate its
	nature.</p>
