<p><b>9. God</b>—The oldest authorities
	read, "Lord." "Him who is Lord and Father." The
	uncommonness of the application of "Lord" to the Father,
	doubtless caused the change in modern texts to "God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). But as Messiah is called "Father," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, so God the Father is called by the Son's title, "Lord":
	showing the unity of the Godhead. "Father" implies His
	<i>paternal</i> love; "Lord," His dominion.

<p><b>men, which</b>—not "men
	<i>who</i>"; for what is meant is not particular men, but men
	<i>genetically</i> [ALFORD].

	similitude of God</b>—Though in a great measure man has lost the
	<i>likeness</i> of God in which he was originally made, yet enough of
	it still remains to show what once it was, and what in regenerated
	and restored man it shall be. We ought to reverence this remnant and
	earnest of what man shall be in ourselves and in others. "Absalom
	has fallen from his father's favor, but the people still recognize
	him to be the king's son" [BENGEL].
	Man resembles in humanity the Son of man, "the express image of
	His person" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>),
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:20">1 John 4:20</span>.
	In the passage, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:26">Genesis 1:26</span>, "image"
	and "likeness" are distinct: "image," according
	to the Alexandrians, was something <i>in</i> which men were created,
	being common to all, and continuing to man after the fall, while the
	"likeness" was something <i>toward</i> which man was
	created, to strive after and attain it: the former marks man's
	physical and intellectual, the latter his moral pre-eminence.</p>
