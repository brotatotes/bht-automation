<p><b>1. whence</b>—The cause of
	quarrels is often sought in external circumstances, whereas internal
	lusts are the true origin.

<p><b>wars,</b> c.—contrasted
	with the "peace" of heavenly wisdom. "Fightings"
	are the active carrying on of "wars." The best authorities
	have a second "whence" before "fightings."
	Tumults marked the era before the destruction of Jerusalem when James
	wrote. He indirectly alludes to these. The members are the first seat
	of war thence it passes to conflict between man and man, nation and
	nation.

<p><b>lusts</b>—literally,
	"pleasures," that is, the lusts which prompt you to
	"desire" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:2">James 4:2</span>)
	<i>pleasures</i> whence you seek self at the cost of your neighbor,
	and hence flow "fightings."

<p><b>that war</b>—"campaign,
	as an army of soldiers encamped within" [ALFORD]
	the soul; tumultuously war against the interests of your fellow men,
	while lusting to advance self. But while warring thus against others
	they (without his knowledge) war against the soul of the man himself,
	and against the Spirit; therefore they must be "mortified"
	by the Christian.</p>
