10. in the sight of the Lord—as
	continually in the presence of Him who alone is worthy to be exalted:
	recognizing His presence in all your ways, the truest incentive to
	humility. The tree, to grow upwards, must strike its roots
	deep downwards; so man, to be exalted, must have his mind deep-rooted
	in humility. In 1 Peter 5:6, it is,
	Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, namely, in His
	dealings of Providence: a distinct thought from that here. 
	lift you up—in part in
	this world, fully in the world to come.
