<p><b>10. in the sight of the Lord</b>—as
	continually in the presence of Him who alone is worthy to be exalted:
	recognizing His presence in all your ways, the truest incentive to
	<i>humility.</i> The tree, to grow upwards, must strike its roots
	deep downwards; so man, to be exalted, must have his mind deep-rooted
	in humility. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:6">1 Peter 5:6</span>, it is,
	Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, namely, in His
	dealings of Providence: a distinct thought from that here. 
	</p>
<p><b>lift you up</b>—in part in
	this world, fully in the world to come.</p>
