12. There is one lawgiver—The
	best authorities read in addition, "and judge." Translate,
	"There is One (alone) who is (at once) Lawgiver and Judge,
	(namely) He who is able to save and destroy." Implying, God
	alone is Lawgiver and therefore Judge, since it is He alone who can
	execute His judgments; our inability in this respect shows our
	presumption in trying to act as judges, as though we were God. 
	who art thou, &c.—The
	order in the Greek is emphatic, "But (inserted in oldest
	manuscripts) thou, who art thou that judgest another?" How
	rashly arrogant in judging thy fellows, and wresting from God the
	office which belongs to Him over thee and THEM
	alike! 
	another—The oldest
	authorities read, "thy neighbor."
