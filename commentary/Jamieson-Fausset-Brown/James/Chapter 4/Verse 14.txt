<p><b>14. what</b>—literally, "of
	what nature" is your life? that is, how evanescent it is. 
	</p>
<p><b>It is even</b>—Some oldest
	authorities read, "For ye are." BENGEL,
	with other old authorities, reads, "For it shall be," the
	future referring to the "morrow" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The former expresses, "Ye yourselves are
	transitory"; so everything of yours, even your life, must
	partake of the same transitoriness. Received text has no old
	authority.

<p><b>and then vanisheth
	away</b>—"afterwards vanishing as it came"; literally,
	"afterwards (as it appeared), <i>so vanishing</i>"
	[ALFORD].</p>
