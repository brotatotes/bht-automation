<p><b>2. Ye lust</b>—A different <i>Greek</i>
	word from that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:1">James 4:1</span>. "Ye
	desire"; literally, "ye set your <i>mind</i> (or heart) <i>on</i>"
	an object. 
	</p>
<p><b>have not</b>—The lust of
	desire does not ensure the actual possession. Hence "ye kill"
	(not as <i>Margin,</i> without any old authority, "envy")
	to ensure possession. Not probably in the case of professing
	Christians of that day in a literal sense, but "kill and envy"
	(as the <i>Greek</i> for "desire to have" should be
	translated), that is, harass and oppress through envy [DRUSIUS].
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+11:5">Zechariah 11:5</span>, "slay";
	<i>through envy, hate,</i> and desire to get out of your way, and so
	are "murderers" in God's eyes [ESTIUS].
	If literal murder [ALFORD]
	were meant, I do not think it would occur so early in the series; nor
	had Christians then as yet reached so open criminality. In the
	Spirit's application of the passage to all ages, literal <i>killing</i>
	is included, flowing from the desire to possess so David and Ahab.
	There is a climax: "Ye desire," the individual lust for an
	object; "ye kill and envy," the feeling and action of
	individuals against individuals; "ye fight and war," the
	action of many against many. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye have not, because ye ask
	not</b>—God promises to those who pray, not to those who fight. The
	petition of the lustful, murderous, and contentious is not recognized
	by God as <i>prayer.</i> If ye prayed, there would be no "wars
	and fightings." Thus this last clause is an answer to the
	question, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:1">James 4:1</span>, "Whence
	come wars and fightings?"</p>
