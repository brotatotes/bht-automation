2. Ye lust—A different Greek
	word from that in James 4:1. "Ye
	desire"; literally, "ye set your mind (or heart) on"
	an object. 
	have not—The lust of
	desire does not ensure the actual possession. Hence "ye kill"
	(not as Margin, without any old authority, "envy")
	to ensure possession. Not probably in the case of professing
	Christians of that day in a literal sense, but "kill and envy"
	(as the Greek for "desire to have" should be
	translated), that is, harass and oppress through envy [DRUSIUS].
	Compare Zechariah 11:5, "slay";
	through envy, hate, and desire to get out of your way, and so
	are "murderers" in God's eyes [ESTIUS].
	If literal murder [ALFORD]
	were meant, I do not think it would occur so early in the series; nor
	had Christians then as yet reached so open criminality. In the
	Spirit's application of the passage to all ages, literal killing
	is included, flowing from the desire to possess so David and Ahab.
	There is a climax: "Ye desire," the individual lust for an
	object; "ye kill and envy," the feeling and action of
	individuals against individuals; "ye fight and war," the
	action of many against many. 
	ye have not, because ye ask
	not—God promises to those who pray, not to those who fight. The
	petition of the lustful, murderous, and contentious is not recognized
	by God as prayer. If ye prayed, there would be no "wars
	and fightings." Thus this last clause is an answer to the
	question, James 4:1, "Whence
	come wars and fightings?"
