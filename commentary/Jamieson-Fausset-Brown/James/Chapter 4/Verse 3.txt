3. Some of them are supposed to
	say in objection, But we do "ask" (pray); compare  :-. James replies, It is not enough to ask for good things, but
	we must ask with a good spirit and intention. "Ye ask amiss,
	that ye may consume it (your object of prayer) upon
	(literally, 'in') your lusts (literally, 'pleasures')"; not that
	ye may have the things you need for the service of God. Contrast
	James 1:5; Matthew 6:31;
	Matthew 6:32. If ye prayed aright,
	all your proper wants would be supplied; the improper cravings which
	produce "wars and fightings" would then cease. Even
	believers' prayers are often best answered when their desires are
	most opposed.
