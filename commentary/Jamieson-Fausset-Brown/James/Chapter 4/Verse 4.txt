<p><b>4.</b> The oldest manuscripts omit
	"adulterers and," and read simply, "Ye adulteresses."
	God is the rightful husband; the men of the world are regarded
	collectively as one <i>adulteress,</i> and individually as
	<i>adulteresses.</i>
</p>
<p><b>the world</b>—in so far as
	the men of it and their motives and acts are aliens to God, for
	example, its selfish "lusts" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and covetous and ambitious "wars and fightings"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:1">James 4:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>enmity</b>—not merely
	"inimical"; a state of enmity, and that enmity itself.
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15">1 John 2:15</span>, "love .
	. . the world . . . the love of the Father." 
	</p>
<p><b>whosoever . . . will be</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> is emphatic, "shall <i>be resolved</i> to be."
	Whether he succeed or not, if his <i>wish</i> be to be the friend of
	the world, he <i>renders himself, becomes</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>
	for "is") by the very fact, "the enemy of God."
	Contrast "Abraham the friend of God."</p>
