<p><b>5. in vain</b>—No word of
	Scripture can be so. The quotation here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, seems to be not so much from a particular passage as one
	gathered by James under inspiration from the general tenor of such
	passages in both the Old and New Testaments, as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:29">Numbers 14:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+21:20">Proverbs 21:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+5:17">Galatians 5:17</span>.

<p><b>spirit that dwelleth in
	us</b>—Other manuscripts read, "that God hath made to dwell in
	us" (namely, at Pentecost). If so translated, "Does the
	(Holy) Spirit that God hath placed in us lust to (towards) envy"
	(namely, as ye do in your worldly "wars and fightings")?
	Certainly not; ye are therefore walking in the flesh, not in the
	Spirit, while ye thus <i>lust towards,</i> that is, <i>with envy</i>
	against one another. The friendship of the world tends to breed <i>envy;</i>
	the Spirit produces very different fruit. ALFORD
	attributes the epithet "with envy," in the unwarrantable
	sense of <i>jealously,</i> to the Holy Spirit: "The Spirit
	<i>jealously desires</i> us for His own." In <i>English Version</i>
	the sense is, "the (natural) spirit that hath its dwelling in us
	lusts with (literally, 'to,' or 'towards') envy." Ye lust, and
	because ye have not what ye lust after (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:1">James 4:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+4:2">James 4:2</span>), ye envy your neighbor
	who has, and so the <i>spirit of envy</i> leads you on to "fight."
	James also here refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:14">James 3:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+3:16">James 3:16</span>.</p>
