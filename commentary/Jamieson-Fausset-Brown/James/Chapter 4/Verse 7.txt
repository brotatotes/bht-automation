<p><b>Resist . . . devil</b>—Under
	his banner <i>pride</i> and <i>envy</i> are enlisted in the world;
	resist his temptations to these. Faith, humble prayers, and heavenly
	wisdom, are the weapons of resistance. The language is taken from
	warfare. "Submit" as a good soldier puts himself in
	complete subjection to his captain. "Resist," stand bravely
	against.

<p><b>he will flee</b>—Translate,
	"he <i>shall</i> flee." For it is a promise of God, not a
	mere assurance from man to man [ALFORD].
	He shall flee worsted as he did from Christ.</p>
