9. Be afflicted—literally,
	"Endure misery," that is, mourn over your wretchedness
	through sin. Repent with deep sorrow instead of your present
	laughter. A blessed mourning. Contrast Isaiah 22:12;
	Isaiah 22:13; Luke 6:25.
	James does not add here, as in Luke 6:25- :, "howl," where he foretells the doom of the
	impenitent at the coming destruction of Jerusalem. 
	heaviness—literally,
	"falling of the countenance," casting down of the eyes.
