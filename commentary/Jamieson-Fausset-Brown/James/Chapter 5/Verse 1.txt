<p><b>1. Go to now</b>—Come now. A
	phrase to call solemn attention. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye rich</b>—who have
	neglected the true enjoyment of riches, which consists in doing good.
	James intends this address to rich Jewish unbelievers, not so much
	for themselves, as for the saints, that they may bear with patience
	the violence of the rich (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7">James 5:7</span>),
	knowing that God will speedily avenge them on their oppressors
	[BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>miseries that shall
	come</b>—literally, "that are coming upon you"
	unexpectedly and swiftly, namely, at the coming of the Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7- :">James 5:7- :</span>); primarily, at the destruction of Jerusalem; finally, at His
	visible coming to judge the world.</p>
