<p><b>11. count them happy</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>which endure</b>—The oldest
	authorities read, "which have endured," which suits the
	sense better than <i>English Version:</i> "Those who in past
	days, like the prophets and Job, have endured trials." Such, not
	those who "have lived in pleasure and been wanton on the earth"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:5">James 5:5</span>), are "happy."
	</p>
<p><b>patience</b>—rather,
	"endurance," answering to "endure": the <i>Greek</i>
	words similarly corresponding. Distinct from the <i>Greek</i> word
	for "patience" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:10">James 5:10</span>.
	The same word ought to be translated, "endurance," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:10- :">James 5:10- :</span>. He here reverts to the subject which he began with. 
	</p>
<p><b>Job</b>—This passage shows
	the history of him is concerning a real, not an imaginary person;
	otherwise his case could not be quoted as an example at all. Though
	he showed much of impatience, yet he always returned to this, that he
	committed himself wholly to God, and at last showed a perfect spirit
	of enduring submission. 
	</p>
<p><b>and have seen</b>—(with the
	eyes of your mind). ALFORD
	translates from the old and genuine reading, "see also," c.
	The old reading is, however, capable of being translated as <i>English
	Version.</i>
</p>
<p><b>the end of the Lord</b>—the
	end which the Lord gave. If Job had much to "endure,"
	remember also Job's happy "end." Hence, learn, though much
	tried, to "endure to the end." 
	</p>
<p><b>that</b>—ALFORD
	and others translate, "inasmuch as," "for." 
	</p>
<p><b>pitiful . . . of tender
	mercy</b>—The former refers to the "feeling" the latter,
	to the <i>act.</i> His <i>pity</i> is shown in not laying on the
	<i>patient endurer</i> more trials than he is able to bear; His
	<i>mercy,</i> in His giving a happy "end" to the trials
	[BENGEL].</p>
