	some <i>one</i> of the elders, as Roman Catholics interpret it, to
	justify their usage in <i>extreme unction.</i> The prayers of the
	elders over the sick would be much the same as though the whole
	Church which they represent should pray [BENGEL].

<p><b>anointing him with oil</b>—The
	usage which Christ committed to His apostles was afterwards continued
	with laying on of hands, as a token of the highest faculty of

	miraculous gift of healing has been withdrawn for the most part, to
	use the sign where the reality is wanting would be unmeaning
	superstition. Compare other apostolic usages now discontinued

	Romish extreme unction is administered to those <i>whose life is
	despaired of,</i> to heal the <i>soul,</i> whereas James' unction was
	to heal the body. CARDINAL
	CAJETAN [<i>Commentary</i>]
	admits that James cannot refer to extreme unction. Oil in the East,
	and especially among the Jews (see the Talmud, <i>Jerusalem</i> and
	<i>Babylon</i>), was much used as a curative agent. It was also a
	sign of the divine grace. Hence it was an appropriate sign in
	performing miraculous cures.
