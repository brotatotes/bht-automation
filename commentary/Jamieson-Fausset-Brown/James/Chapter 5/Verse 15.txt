<p><b>15. prayer</b>—He does not say <i>the
	oil</i> shall save: it is but the symbol. 
	</p>
<p><b>save</b>—plainly not as
	Rome says, "save" <i>the soul.</i> but <i>heal</i> "the
	sick": as the words, "the Lord shall raise him up,"
	prove. So the same <i>Greek</i> is translated, "made (thee)
	whole," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:21">Matthew 9:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:22">Matthew 9:22</span>.
	</p>
<p><b>and if . . . sins</b>—for
	not all who are sick are so because of some special sins. Here a case
	is supposed of one visited with sickness for special sins. 
	</p>
<p><b>have committed</b>—literally,
	"<i>be</i> in a state of <i>having committed</i> sins,"
	that is, be under the consequences of sins committed. 
	</p>
<p><b>they</b>—rather, "it":
	<i>his having committed sins</i> shall be forgiven him. The
	connection of sin and sickness is implied in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+33:24">Isaiah 33:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:2-5">Matthew 9:2-5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:14">John 5:14</span>.
	The absolution of the sick, retained in the Church of England, refers
	to the sins which the sick man confesses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:14- :">John 5:14- :</span>) and repents of, whereby outward scandal has been given to
	the Church and the cause of religion; not to sins in their relation
	to God, the only Judge.</p>
