15. prayer—He does not say the
	oil shall save: it is but the symbol. 
	save—plainly not as
	Rome says, "save" the soul. but heal "the
	sick": as the words, "the Lord shall raise him up,"
	prove. So the same Greek is translated, "made (thee)
	whole," Matthew 9:21; Matthew 9:22.
	and if . . . sins—for
	not all who are sick are so because of some special sins. Here a case
	is supposed of one visited with sickness for special sins. 
	have committed—literally,
	"be in a state of having committed sins,"
	that is, be under the consequences of sins committed. 
	they—rather, "it":
	his having committed sins shall be forgiven him. The
	connection of sin and sickness is implied in Isaiah 33:24;
	Matthew 9:2-5; John 5:14.
	The absolution of the sick, retained in the Church of England, refers
	to the sins which the sick man confesses (John 5:14- :) and repents of, whereby outward scandal has been given to
	the Church and the cause of religion; not to sins in their relation
	to God, the only Judge.
