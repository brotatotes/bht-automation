<p><b>16.</b> The oldest authorities read,
	"Confess, THEREFORE,"
	c. Not only in the particular case of sickness, but universally
	confess. 
	</p>
<p><b>faults</b>—your <i>falls</i>
	and <i>offenses,</i> in relation to one another. The word is not the
	same as <i>sins.</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:23">Matthew 5:23</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:24">Matthew 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:4">Luke 17:4</span>,
	illustrate the precept here. 
	</p>
<p><b>one to another</b>—not to
	the priest, as Rome insists. The Church of England <i>recommends</i>
	in certain cases. Rome <i>compels</i> confession in all cases.
	Confession is desirable in the case of (1) <i>wrong</i> done to a
	neighbor; (2) when under a troubled conscience we ask <i>counsel</i>
	of a godly minister or friend as to how we may obtain God's
	forgiveness and strength to sin no more, or when we desire their
	intercessory prayers for us ("Pray for one another"):
	"Confession may be made to anyone who can pray" [BENGEL];
	(3) <i>open</i> confession of sin before the Church and the world, in
	token of penitence. Not <i>auricular</i> confession. 
	</p>
<p><b>that ye may be healed</b>—of
	your bodily sicknesses. Also that, if your sickness be the punishment
	of sin, the latter being forgiven on intercessory prayer, "ye
	may be healed" of the former. Also, that ye may be healed
	spiritually. 
	</p>
<p><b>effectual</b>—intense and
	fervent, not "wavering" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:4- :">Luke 17:4- :</span>), [BEZA]. "When
	<i>energized</i>" by the Spirit, as those were who performed
	miracles [HAMMOND]. This
	suits the collocation of the <i>Greek</i> words and the sense well. A
	righteous man's prayer is always heard generally, but his particular
	request for the <i>healing</i> of another was then likely to be
	granted when he was one <i>possessing a special charism of the
	Spirit.</i> ALFORD
	translates, "Availeth much <i>in its working.</i>" The
	"righteous" is one himself careful to avoid "faults,"
	and showing his faith by works (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+17:4- :">Luke 17:4- :</span>).</p>
