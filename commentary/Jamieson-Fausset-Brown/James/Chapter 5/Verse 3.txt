<p><b>3. is cankered</b>—"rusted
	through" [ALFORD]. 
	</p>
<p><b>rust . . . witness against
	you</b>—in the day of judgment; namely, that your riches were of no
	profit to any, lying unemployed and so contracting rust. 
	</p>
<p><b>shall eat your flesh</b>—The
	rust which once ate your riches, shall then gnaw your conscience,
	accompanied with punishment which shall prey upon your bodies for
	ever. 
	</p>
<p><b>as . . . fire</b>—not with
	the slow process of <i>rusting,</i> but with the swiftness of
	consuming <i>fire.</i>
</p>
<p><b>for the last days</b>—Ye
	have heaped together, not treasures as ye suppose (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), but wrath against the last days, namely, the coming
	judgment of the Lord. ALFORD
	translates more literally, "<i>In</i> these last days (before
	the coming judgment) ye laid up (worldly) treasure" to no
	profit, instead of repenting and seeking salvation (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
