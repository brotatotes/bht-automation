<p><b>4. Behold</b>—calling attention to
	their coming doom as no vain threat. 
	</p>
<p><b>labourers</b>—literally
	"workmen." 
	</p>
<p><b>of you kept back</b>—So
	<i>English Version</i> rightly. Not as ALFORD,
	"crieth out <i>from</i> you." The "keeping back of the
	hire" was, <i>on the part</i> OF
	the rich, virtually an act of "<i>fraud,</i>" because the
	poor laborers were not immediately paid. The phrase is therefore not,
	"kept back <i>by</i> you," but "<i>of</i> you";
	the latter implying <i>virtual,</i> rather than overt, fraud. James
	refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+24:14">Deuteronomy 24:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+24:15">Deuteronomy 24:15</span>,
	"At this day . . . give his <i>hire,</i> neither shall the sun
	go down upon it, lest he CRY
	against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee." Many sins
	"cry" to heaven for vengeance which men tacitly take no
	account of, as unchastity and injustice [BENGEL].
	Sins peculiarly offensive to God are said to "cry" to Him.
	The rich ought to have given freely to the poor; their not doing so
	was sin. A still greater sin was their not paying their debts. Their
	greatest sin was not paying them to the poor, whose wages is their
	all. 
	</p>
<p><b>cries of them</b>—a double
	cry; both that of the hire abstractly, and that of the laborers
	hired. 
	</p>
<p><b>the Lord of sabaoth</b>—here
	only in the New Testament. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+24:15- :">Deuteronomy 24:15- :</span> it is a quotation. It is suited to the Jewish tone of the
	Epistle. It reminds the rich who think the poor have no protector,
	that the Lord of the whole hosts in heaven and earth is the guardian
	and avenger of the latter. He is identical with the "coming
	Lord" Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:7">James 5:7</span>).</p>
