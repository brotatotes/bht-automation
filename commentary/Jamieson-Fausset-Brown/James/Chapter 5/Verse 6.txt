<p><b>6. Ye have condemned . . . the
	just</b>—The <i>Greek</i> aorist expresses, "Ye are <i>accustomed</i>
	to condemn . . . the just." Their condemnation of Christ, "the
	Just," is foremost in James' mind. But all the innocent blood
	shed, and to be shed, is included, the Holy Spirit comprehending
	James himself, called "the Just," who was slain in a
	tumult. See my <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> This
	gives a peculiar appropriateness to the expression in this verse, the
	same "as the righteous (<i>just</i>) man" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The justice or righteousness of Jesus and His people is
	what peculiarly provoked the ungodly great men of the world. 
	</p>
<p><b>he doth not resist you</b>—The
	very patience of the Just one is abused by the wicked as an incentive
	to boldness in violent persecution, as if they may do as they please
	with impunity. God doth "resist the proud" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); but Jesus as man, "as a sheep is dumb before the
	shearers, so He opened not His mouth": so His people are meek
	under persecution. The day will come when God will resist (literally,
	"set Himself in array against") His foes and theirs.</p>
