	Even if <i>English Version</i> be retained, the receiving of the
	early and latter rains is not to be understood as the object of his
	hope, but <i>the harvest</i> for which those rains are the necessary
	preliminary. The early rain fell at sowing time, about November or
	December; the latter rain, about March or April, to mature the grain
	for harvest. The latter rain that shall precede the coming spiritual
	harvest, will probably be another Pentecost-like effusion of the Holy
	Ghost.</p>
