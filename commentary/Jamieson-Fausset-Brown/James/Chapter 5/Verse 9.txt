<p><b>9. Grudge not</b>—rather "Murmur
	not"; "grumble not." The <i>Greek</i> is literally,
	"groan": a half-suppressed murmur of impatience and harsh
	judgment, not uttered aloud or freely. Having exhorted them to
	patience in bearing wrongs from the wicked, he now exhorts them to a
	forbearing spirit as to the offenses given by brethren. Christians,
	who bear the former patiently, sometimes are impatient at the latter,
	though much less grievous.

<p><b>lest . . . condemned</b>—The
	best manuscript authorities read, "judged." James refers to
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:1">Matthew 7:1</span>, "Judge not lest ye
	be <i>judged.</i>" To "murmur against one another" is
	virtually to <i>judge,</i> and so to become liable to be <i>judged.</i>
</p>
<p><b>judge . . . before the
	door</b>—referring to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:33">Matthew 24:33</span>.
	The <i>Greek</i> is the same in both passages, and so ought to be
	translated here as there, "doors," plural. The phrase means
	"near at hand" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+4:7">Genesis 4:7</span>),
	which in the oldest interpretations [Targums of <i>Jonathan</i> and
	<i>Jerusalem</i>] is explained, "thy sin is reserved <i>unto the
	judgment of the world to come.</i>" Compare "the
	everlasting doors" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+24:7">Psalms 24:7</span>,
	whence He shall come forth). The Lord's coming to destroy Jerusalem
	is primarily referred to; and ultimately, His coming again visibly to
	judgment.</p>
