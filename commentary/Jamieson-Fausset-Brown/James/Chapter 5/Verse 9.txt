9. Grudge not—rather "Murmur
	not"; "grumble not." The Greek is literally,
	"groan": a half-suppressed murmur of impatience and harsh
	judgment, not uttered aloud or freely. Having exhorted them to
	patience in bearing wrongs from the wicked, he now exhorts them to a
	forbearing spirit as to the offenses given by brethren. Christians,
	who bear the former patiently, sometimes are impatient at the latter,
	though much less grievous. 
	lest . . . condemned—The
	best manuscript authorities read, "judged." James refers to
	Matthew 7:1, "Judge not lest ye
	be judged." To "murmur against one another" is
	virtually to judge, and so to become liable to be judged.
judge . . . before the
	door—referring to Matthew 24:33.
	The Greek is the same in both passages, and so ought to be
	translated here as there, "doors," plural. The phrase means
	"near at hand" (Genesis 4:7),
	which in the oldest interpretations [Targums of Jonathan and
	Jerusalem] is explained, "thy sin is reserved unto the
	judgment of the world to come." Compare "the
	everlasting doors" (Psalms 24:7,
	whence He shall come forth). The Lord's coming to destroy Jerusalem
	is primarily referred to; and ultimately, His coming again visibly to
	judgment.
