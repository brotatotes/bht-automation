<p><b>1. In the beginning</b>—of all
	time and created existence, for this Word gave it being (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:3">John 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:10">John 1:10</span>); therefore, "before
	the world was" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24">John 17:24</span>); or, from all
	eternity. 
	</p>
<p><b>was the Word</b>—He <i>who
	is to God what man's word is to himself, the manifestation or
	expression of himself to those without him.</i> (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:24- :">John 17:24- :</span>). On the <i>origin</i> of this most lofty and now for ever
	consecrated title of Christ, this is not the place to speak. It
	occurs only in the writings of this seraphic apostle. 
	</p>
<p><b>was with God</b>—having a
	conscious personal existence <i>distinct from God</i> (as one is from
	the person he is "with"), but <i>inseparable from Him</i>
	and <i>associated with Him</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:5">John 17:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span>),
	where "THE FATHER"
	is used in the same sense as "GOD"
	here. 
	</p>
<p><b>was God</b>—in substance
	and essence GOD; or was
	possessed of essential or proper divinity. Thus, each of these brief
	but pregnant statements is the complement of the other, correcting
	any misapprehensions which the others might occasion. Was the Word
	<i>eternal?</i> It was <i>not</i> the eternity of "<i>the
	Father,</i>" but of a conscious personal existence <i>distinct
	from Him and associated with Him.</i> Was the Word thus "with
	God?" It was not the distinctness and the fellowship of <i>another
	being,</i> as if there were <i>more Gods than one,</i> but of One who
	was <i>Himself God</i>—in such sense that the <i>absolute unity</i>
	of the God head, the great principle of all religion, is only
	transferred from the region of shadowy abstraction to the region of
	essential life and love. But why all this definition? Not to give us
	any <i>abstract information</i> about certain mysterious distinctions
	in the Godhead, but solely to let the reader know <i>who it was that</i>
	in the fulness of time "<i>was made flesh.</i>" After each
	verse, then, the reader must say, "It was He who is thus, and
	thus, and thus described, who was made flesh."</p>
