<p><b>12. But as many</b>—<i>individuals,</i>

<p><b>gave he power</b>—The word
	signifies both <i>authority</i> and <i>ability,</i> and both are
	certainly meant here.

<p><b>believe on his name</b>—<i>a
	phrase never used in Scripture of any mere creature,</i> to express
	the credit given to human testimony, even of prophets or apostles,
	inasmuch it carries with it the idea of <i>trust</i> proper only
	towards GOD. In this sense
	of <i>supreme faith,</i> as due to Him who "gives those that
	<i>believe in Himself</i> power to become sons of God," it is
	manifestly used here.</p>
