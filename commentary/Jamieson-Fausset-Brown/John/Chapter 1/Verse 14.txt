<p><b>14. And the Word,</b> c.—<i>To
	raise the reader to the altitude of this climax were the thirteen
	foregoing verses written.</i>
</p>
<p><b>was made flesh</b>—BECAME
	MAN, in man's present frail, mortal condition, denoted by the
	word "flesh" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:6">Isaiah 40:6</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:24">1 Peter 1:24</span>). It is directed
	probably against the <i>Docetæ,</i> who held that Christ was not
	really but only <i>apparently</i> man; against whom this gentle
	spirit is vehement in his Epistles (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:3">1 John 4:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:7">2 John 1:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:10">2 John 1:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:11">2 John 1:11</span>), [LUCKE,
	c.]. Nor could He be too much so, for with the verity of the
	Incarnation all substantial Christianity vanishes. But now, married
	to our nature, henceforth He is as <i>personally conscious of all
	that is strictly human as of all that is properly divine</i> and our
	nature is in His Person redeemed and quickened, ennobled and
	transfigured. 
	</p>
<p><b>and dwelt</b>—tabernacled
	or pitched his tent; a word peculiar to John, who uses it four times,
	all in the sense of <i>a permanent stay</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:15">Revelation 7:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:12">Revelation 12:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:6">Revelation 13:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3">Revelation 21:3</span>). For ever wedded to our
	"<i>flesh,</i>" He has entered this tabernacle to "go
	no more out." The allusion is to that tabernacle where dwelt the
	<i>Shekinah</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3- :">Revelation 21:3- :</span>),
	or manifested "GLORY OF THE
	LORD," and with
	reference to God's <i>permanent dwelling among His people</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+26:11">Leviticus 26:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:18">Psalms 68:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+132:13">Psalms 132:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+132:14">Psalms 132:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:27">Ezekiel 37:27</span>). This is put almost
	beyond doubt by what immediately follows, "And we beheld his
	glory" [LUCKE, MEYER,
	DE WETTE
	which last critic, rising higher than usual, says that thus were
	perfected all former partial manifestations of God in <i>an
	essentially Personal and historically Human</i> manifestation]. 
	</p>
<p><b>full of grace and truth</b>—So
	it should read: "He dwelt among us full of grace and truth";
	or, in Old Testament phrase, "Mercy and truth," denoting
	the whole fruit of God's purposes of love towards sinners of mankind,
	which until now existed only in <i>promise,</i> and the <i>fulfilment</i>
	at length of that promise in Christ; in one great word, "<i>the</i>
	SURE MERCIES <i>of David</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:3">Isaiah 55:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:34">Acts 13:34</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+23:5">2 Samuel 23:5</span>). In His
	Person all that Grace and Truth which had been floating so long in
	shadowy forms, and darting into the souls of the poor and needy its
	broken beams, took everlasting possession of human flesh and filled
	it full. By this Incarnation of Grace and Truth, the teaching of
	thousands of years was at once transcended and beggared, and the
	family of God sprang into Manhood. 
	</p>
<p><b>and we beheld his glory</b>—not
	by the eye of <i>sense,</i> which saw in Him only "the
	carpenter." His glory was "spiritually discerned"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7-15">1 Corinthians 2:7-15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:16">2 Corinthians 5:16</span>) —the glory of
	surpassing grace, love, tenderness, wisdom, purity, spirituality;
	majesty and meekness, richness and poverty, power and weakness,
	meeting together in unique contrast; ever attracting and at times
	ravishing the "babes" that followed and forsook all for
	Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>the glory as of the only
	begotten of the Father</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:16- :">2 Corinthians 5:16- :</span>); not <i>like,</i> but "such as (belongs to),"
	such as <i>became</i> or was <i>befitting</i> the only begotten of
	the Father [CHRYSOSTOM in
	LUCKE, CALVIN,
	&amp;c.], according to a well-known use of the word "as."
