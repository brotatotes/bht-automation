	chargeable with the guilt of it (Exodus 28:38;
	Leviticus 5:1; Ezekiel 18:20),
	and to bear it away (as often). In the Levitical victims both
	ideas met, as they do in Christ, the people's guilt being viewed as
	transferred to them, avenged in their death, and so
	borne away by them (Leviticus 4:15;
	Leviticus 16:15; Leviticus 16:21;
