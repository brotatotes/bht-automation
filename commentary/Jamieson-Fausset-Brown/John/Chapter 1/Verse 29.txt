<p><b>29. seeth Jesus</b>—fresh,
	probably, from the scene of the temptation. 
	</p>
<p><b>coming unto him</b>—as to
	congenial company (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:23">Acts 4:23</span>),
	and to receive from him His first greeting. 
	</p>
<p><b>and saith</b>—catching a
	sublime inspiration at the sight of Him approaching. 
	</p>
<p><b>the Lamb of God</b>—the one
	God-ordained, God-gifted sacrificial offering. 
	</p>
<p><b>that taketh away</b>—<i>taketh
	up</i> and <i>taketh away.</i> The word signifies both, as does the
	corresponding <i>Hebrew</i> word. Applied to sin, it means to <i>be
	chargeable with the guilt of it</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:38">Exodus 28:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+5:1">Leviticus 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+18:20">Ezekiel 18:20</span>),
	and to <i>bear it away</i> (as often). In the Levitical victims both
	ideas met, as they do in Christ, the people's guilt being viewed as
	<i>transferred</i> to them, <i>avenged</i> in their death, and so
	<i>borne away</i> by them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+4:15">Leviticus 4:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:15">Leviticus 16:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:21">Leviticus 16:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:22">Leviticus 16:22</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:6-12">Isaiah 53:6-12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the sin</b>—The <i>singular</i>
	number being used to mark the <i>collective burden</i> and
	<i>all-embracing efficacy.</i>
</p>
<p><b>of the world</b>—not of
	Israel only, for whom the typical victims were exclusively offered.
	Wherever there shall live a sinner throughout the wide world, sinking
	under that burden too heavy for him to bear, he shall find in this
	"Lamb of God," a shoulder equal to the weight. The right
	note was struck at the first—balm, doubtless, to Christ's own
	spirit; nor was ever after, or ever will be, a more glorious
	utterance.</p>
