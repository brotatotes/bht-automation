<p><b>4. In Him was life</b>—<i>essentially</i>
	and <i>originally,</i> as the previous verses show to be the meaning.
	Thus He is <i>the Living Word,</i> or, as He is called in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:2">1 John 1:2</span>, "the Word of Life."
	</p>
<p><b>the life . . . the light of
	men</b>—All that in men which is <i>true light</i>—knowledge,
	integrity, intelligent, willing subjection to God, love to Him and to
	their fellow creatures, wisdom, purity, holy joy, rational
	happiness—all this "light of men" has its fountain in the
	essential original "life" of "the Word" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5-7">1 John 1:5-7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+36:9">Psalms 36:9</span>).</p>
