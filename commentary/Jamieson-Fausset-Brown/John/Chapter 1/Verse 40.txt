<p><b>40. One . . . was Andrew</b>—The
	other was doubtless our Evangelist himself. His great sensitiveness
	is touchingly shown in his representation of this first contact with
	the Lord; the circumstances are present to him in the minutest
	details; he still remembers the Very hour. But "he reports no
	particulars of those discourses of the Lord by which he was bound to
	Him for the whole of His life; he allows everything personal to
	retire" [OLSHAUSEN].
