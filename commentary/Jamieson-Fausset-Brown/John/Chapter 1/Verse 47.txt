<p><b>47. an Israelite indeed . . . no
	guile</b>â€”not only no hypocrite, but with a guileless simplicity
	not always found even in God's own people, ready to follow wherever
	truth might lead him, saying, Samuel-like, "Speak, Lord, for Thy
	servant heareth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+3:10">1 Samuel 3:10</span>).</p>
