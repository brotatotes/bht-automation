48. Whence knowest thou me—conscious
	that his very heart had been read, and at this critical moment more
	than ever before. 
	Before Philip called
	thee—showing He knew all that passed between Philip and him at
	a distance. 
	when . . . under the fig
	tree, &c.—where retirement for meditation and prayer was

	Thither, probably—hearing that his master's Master had at length
	appeared, and heaving with mingled eagerness to behold Him and dread

	light and guidance, ending with such a prayer as this, "Show me
	a token for good!" (See on  :-).
	Now he has it, "Thou guileless one, that fig tree scene, with
	all its heaving anxieties, deep pleadings and tremulous hopes—I saw
	it all." The first words of Jesus had astonished, but this quite
	overpowered and won him.
