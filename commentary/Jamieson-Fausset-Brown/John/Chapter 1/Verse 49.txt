<p><b>49. Son of God . . . King of
	Israel</b>—the one denoting His person, the other His office. How
	much loftier this than anything Philip had said to him! But just as
	the earth's vital powers, the longer they are frost-bound, take the
	greater spring when at length set free, so souls, like Nathanael and
	Thomas (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:2">John 1:2</span>), the
	outgoings of whose faith are hindered for a time, take the start of
	their more easy-going brethren when loosed and let go.</p>
