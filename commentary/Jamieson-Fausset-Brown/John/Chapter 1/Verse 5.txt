<p><b>5. shineth in darkness,</b> &amp;c.—in
	this dark, fallen world, or in mankind "sitting in darkness and
	the shadow of death," <i>with no ability to find the way either
	of truth or of holiness.</i> In this thick darkness, and consequent
	intellectual and moral obliquity, "the light of the Word"
	shineth—<i>by all the rays whether of natural or revealed teaching
	which men</i> (apart from the Incarnation of the Word) <i>are favored
	with.</i>
</p>
<p><b>the darkness comprehended it
	not</b>—<i>did not take it in,</i> a brief summary of the effect of
	all the strivings of this <i>un</i>incarnate Word throughout this
	wide world from the beginning, and a hint of the necessity of His
	putting on <i>flesh,</i> if any recovery of men was to be effected
