51. Hereafter, &c.â€”The key
	to this great saying is Jacob's vision ( :-), to which the allusion plainly is. To show the
	patriarch that though alone and friendless on earth his interests
	were busying all heaven, he was made to see "heaven opened and
	the angels of God ascending and descending upon a" mystic
	"ladder reaching from heaven to earth." "By and
	by," says Jesus here, "ye shall see this communication
	between heaven and earth thrown wide open, and the Son of man the
	real Ladder of this intercourse."
