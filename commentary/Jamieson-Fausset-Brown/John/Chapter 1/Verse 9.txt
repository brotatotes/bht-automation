<p><b>9. lighteth every man,</b>
	c.â€”rather, "which, coming into the world, enlighteneth every
	man" or, is "the Light of the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "Coming into the world" is a superfluous and
	quite unusual description of "every man"; but it is of all
	descriptions of Christ amongst the most familiar, especially in the
	writings of this Evangelist (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:46">John 12:46</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:28">John 16:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:37">John 18:37</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:9">1 John 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:15">1 Timothy 1:15</span>,
