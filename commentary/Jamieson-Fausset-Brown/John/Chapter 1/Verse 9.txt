9. lighteth every man,
	c.â€”rather, "which, coming into the world, enlighteneth every
	man" or, is "the Light of the world" ( :-). "Coming into the world" is a superfluous and
	quite unusual description of "every man"; but it is of all
	descriptions of Christ amongst the most familiar, especially in the
	writings of this Evangelist (John 12:46;
	John 16:28; John 18:37;
	1 John 4:9; 1 Timothy 1:15,
	&c.).
