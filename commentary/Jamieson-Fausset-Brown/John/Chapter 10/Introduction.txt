	SHEPHERD. 
	</p>
<p>This discourse seems plainly to be
	a continuation of the closing verses of the ninth chapter. The figure
	was familiar to the Jewish ear (from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+23:1-40">Jeremiah 23:1-40</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:1-31">Ezekiel 34:1-31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+11:1-17">Zechariah 11:1-17</span>,
	&amp;c.). "This simple creature [the sheep] has this special
	note among all animals, that it quickly hears the voice of the
	shepherd, follows no one else, depends entirely on him, and seeks
	help from him aloneâ€”cannot help itself, but is shut up to another's
	aid" [LUTHER in
	STIER].</p>
