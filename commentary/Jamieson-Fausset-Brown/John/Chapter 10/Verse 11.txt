<p><b>11. I am the good

<p><b>the good shepherd giveth his
	life for the sheep</b>—Though this may be said of literal
	shepherds, who, even for their brute flock, have, like David,
	encountered "the lion and the bear" at the risk of their
	own lives, and still more of faithful pastors who, like the early
	bishops of Rome, have been the foremost to brave the fury of their
	enemies against the flock committed to their care; yet here, beyond
	doubt, it points to the struggle which was to issue in the willing
	surrender of the Redeemer's own life, to save His sheep from
	destruction.</p>
