<p><b>12. an hireling . . . whose own the
	sheep are not</b>—who has no <i>property,</i> in them. By this He
	points to His own peculiar relation to the sheep, the same as His
	Father's, the great Proprietor and Lord of the flock, who styles Him
	"My Shepherd, <i>the Man that is My Fellow</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and though faithful under-shepherds are so in their
	Master's interest, that they feel a measure of His own concern for
	their charge, the language is strictly applicable only to "the
	Son over His own house" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>seeth the wolf coming</b>—not
	<i>the devil</i> distinctively, as some take it [STIER,
	ALFORD, &amp;c.], but
	generally whoever comes upon the flock with hostile intent, in
	whatever form: though the wicked one, no doubt, is <i>at the bottom</i>
	of such movements [LUTHARDT].</p>
