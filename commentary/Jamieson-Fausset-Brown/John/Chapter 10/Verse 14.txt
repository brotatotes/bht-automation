<p><b>14. I am the good shepherd, and know
	my sheep</b>—in the peculiar sense of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>am known of mine</b>—the
	soul's response to the voice that has inwardly and efficaciously
	called it; for of this mutual loving acquaintance ours is the <i>effect</i>
	of His. "The Redeemer's knowledge of us is the <i>active</i>
	element, penetrating us with His power and life; that of believers is
	the <i>passive</i> principle, the reception of His life and light. In
	this reception, however, an assimilation of the soul to the sublime
	object of its knowledge and love takes place; and thus an activity,
	though a derived one, is unfolded, which shows itself in obedience to
	His commands" [OLSHAUSEN].
	From this mutual knowledge Jesus rises to another and loftier
	reciprocity of knowledge.</p>
