<p><b>15-18. As the Father knoweth me,
	even so know I the Father</b>—What claim to absolute equality with
	the Father could exceed this? (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and I lay down my life for
	the sheep</b>—How sublime this, immediately following the lofty
	claim of the preceding clause! It is the riches and the poverty of
	"the Word made flesh"—one glorious Person reaching at
	once up to the Throne and down even to the dust of death, "that
	we might live through Him." A candid interpretation of the
	words, "<i>for the sheep,</i>" ought to go far to establish
	the special relation of the vicarious death of Christ to the Church.</p>
