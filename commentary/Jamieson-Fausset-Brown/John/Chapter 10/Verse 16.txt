<p><b>16. other sheep I have . . . not of
	this fold: them also I must bring</b>—He means the perishing
	Gentiles, <i>already His</i> "<i>sheep</i>" in the love of
	His heart and the purpose of His grace to "<i>bring</i> them"
	in due time. 
	</p>
<p><b>they shall hear my voice</b>—<i>This
	is not the language of mere foresight that they would believe, but
	the expression of a purpose to draw them to Himself by an inward and
	efficacious call, which would</i> <i>infallibly issue in their
	spontaneous accession to Him.</i>
</p>
<p><b>and there shall be one
	fold</b>—rather "one flock" (for the word for "fold,"
	as in the foregoing verses, is quite different).</p>
