<p><b>17. Therefore doth my Father love
	me, because I lay down my life,</b> &amp;c.—As the highest act of
	the Son's love to the Father was the laying down of His life for the
	sheep at His "commandment," so the Father's love to Him as
	His <i>incarnate</i> Son reaches its consummation, and finds its
	highest justification, in that sublimest and most affecting of all
	acts.

<p><b>that I might take it
	again</b>—His resurrection-life being indispensable to the
	accomplishment of the fruit of His death.</p>
