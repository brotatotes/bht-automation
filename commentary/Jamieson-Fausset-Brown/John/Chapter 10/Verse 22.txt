<p><b>22, 23. it was . . . the feast of
	the dedication</b>—celebrated rather more than <i>two months</i>
	after the feast of tabernacles, during which intermediate period our
	Lord seems to have remained in the neighborhood of Jerusalem. It was
	instituted by Jude Maccabeus, to commemorate the purification of the
	temple from the profanations to which it had been subjected by
	Antiochus Epiphanes 165 B.C.,
	and kept for eight days, from the twenty-fifth Chisleu (December),
	the day on which Judas began the first joyous celebration of it (1
	Maccabees 4:52,56,59; and JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 7.7.7).

	some <i>inclemency.</i> Therefore,</p>
