<p><b>30. I and my Father are one</b>—Our
	language admits not of the precision of the original in this great
	saying. "<i>Are</i>" is in the <i>masculine</i> gender—"we
	(two persons) are"; while "<i>one</i>" is <i>neuter</i>—"<i>one
	thing.</i>" Perhaps "<i>one interest</i>" expresses,
	as nearly as may be, the purport of the saying. There seemed to be
	some contradiction between His saying they had been given by His
	Father into <i>His own</i> hands, out of which they could not be
	plucked, and then saying that none could pluck them out of <i>His
	Father's</i> hands, as if they had not been given out of them.
	"<i>Neither have they,</i>" says He; "though He has
	given them to Me, they are as much in His own almighty hands as
	ever—they <i>cannot be,</i> and when given to Me they are not,
	given away from Himself; for HE
	AND I HAVE ALL IN COMMON."
	Thus it will be seen, that, though <i>oneness of essence</i> is not
	the precise thing here affirmed, that truth is <i>the basis of what
	is affirmed,</i> without which it would not be true. And AUGUSTINE
	was right in saying the "<i>We are</i>" condemns the
	<i>Sabellians</i> (who denied the <i>distinction of Persons</i> in
	the Godhead), while the "<i>one</i>" (as explained)
	condemns the <i>Arians</i> (who denied the unity of their essence).</p>
