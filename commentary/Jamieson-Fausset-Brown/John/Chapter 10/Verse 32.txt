<p><b>32. Many good works have I showed
	you</b>—that is, works of pure benevolence (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Who went about doing good," c. see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>from my Father</b>—not so
	much by His power, but as directly <i>commissioned by Him to do them.</i>
	This He says to meet the imputation of unwarrantable assumption of
	the divine prerogatives [LUTHARDT].

<p><b>for which of those works do
	ye stone me?</b>—"are ye stoning (that is, going to stone)
	me?"</p>
