	believe the works</b>—There was in Christ's words, independently of
	any miracles, a self-evidencing truth, majesty and grace, which those

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:30">John 8:30</span>). But, for those who
	wanted this, "the works" were a mighty help. When these

<p><b>that ye may know and believe
	that the Father is in me, and I in him</b>—thus reiterating His
	claim to essential <i>oneness with the Father,</i> which He had only
	<i>seemed</i> to soften down, that He might calm their rage and get
	their ear again for a moment.</p>
