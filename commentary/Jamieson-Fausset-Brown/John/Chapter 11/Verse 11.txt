<p><b>11-16. Our friend Lazarus sleepeth;
	but I go that I may wake him out of sleep</b>â€”Illustrious title!
	"<i>Our friend</i> Lazarus." To <i>Abraham only</i> is it
	accorded in the Old Testament, and not till <i>after his death,</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+20:7">2 Chronicles 20:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:8">Isaiah 41:8</span>),
	to which our attention is called in the New Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:8- :">Isaiah 41:8- :</span>). When Jesus came in the flesh, His forerunner applied this
	name, in a certain sense, to himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:8- :">Isaiah 41:8- :</span>); and into the same fellowship the Lord's chosen disciples
	are declared to have come (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:8- :">Isaiah 41:8- :</span>). "The phrase here employed, "our friend
	Lazarus," means more than "he whom <i>Thou</i> lovest"
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:3">John 11:3</span>, for it implies
	that Christ's affection was <i>reciprocated</i> by Lazarus"
	[LAMPE]. Our Lord had been
	told only that Lazarus was "sick." But the change which his
	two days' delay had produced is here tenderly alluded to. Doubtless,
	His spirit was all the while with His dying, and now dead "friend."
	The symbol of "sleep" for <i>death</i> is common to all
	languages, and familiar to us in the Old Testament. In the New
	Testament, however, a higher meaning is put into it, in relation to
	believers in Jesus (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:3- :">John 11:3- :</span>),
	a sense hinted at, and clearly, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:3- :">John 11:3- :</span> [LUTHARDT]; and
	the "awaking out of sleep" acquires a corresponding sense
	far transcending bare resuscitation.</p>
