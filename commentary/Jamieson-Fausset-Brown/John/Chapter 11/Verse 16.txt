16. Thomas, . . . called Didymus—or
	"the twin." 
	Let us also go, that we may
	die with him—lovely spirit, though tinged with some sadness,
	such as reappears at John 14:5,
	showing the tendency of this disciple to take the dark view of
	things. On a memorable occasion this tendency opened the door to
	downright, though but momentary, unbelief (John 14:5- :). Here, however, though alleged by many interpreters there
	is nothing of the sort. He perceives clearly how this journey to
	Judea will end, as respects his Master, and not only sees in it peril
	to themselves, as they all did, but feels as if he could not and
	cared not to survive his Master's sacrifice to the fury of His
	enemies. It was that kind of affection which, living only in the
	light of its Object, cannot contemplate, or has no heart for life,
	without it.
