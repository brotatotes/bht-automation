17-19. when Jesus came, he found
	that he had lain in the grave four days—If he died on the day
	the tidings came of his illness—and was, according to the Jewish
	custom, buried the same day (see JAHN'S
	Archæology, and John 11:39;
	Acts 5:5; Acts 5:6;
	Acts 5:10) —and if Jesus, after
	two days' further stay in Perea, set out on the day following for
	Bethany, some ten hours' journey, that would make out the four days;
	the first and last being incomplete [MEYER].
