<p><b>25. Jesus said, I am the
	resurrection and the life</b>—"<i>The whole power to restore,
	impart, and maintain</i> life, resides in Me." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:21">John 5:21</span>). What higher
	claim to supreme divinity than this grand saying can be conceived? 
	</p>
<p><b>he that believeth in me,
	though . . . dead . . . shall he live</b>—that is, The believer's
	death shall be swallowed up in life, and his life shall never sink
	into death. As death comes by sin, it is His to dissolve it; and as
	life flows through His righteousness, it is His to communicate and
	eternally maintain it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:21">Romans 5:21</span>).
	The temporary separation of soul and body is here regarded as not
	even interrupting, much less impairing, the new and everlasting life
	imparted by Jesus to His believing people.

<p><b>Believest thou this?</b>—Canst
	thou take this in?</p>
