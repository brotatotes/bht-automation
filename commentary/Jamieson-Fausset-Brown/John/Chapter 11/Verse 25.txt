25. Jesus said, I am the
	resurrection and the life—"The whole power to restore,
	impart, and maintain life, resides in Me." (See on  :-; John 5:21). What higher
	claim to supreme divinity than this grand saying can be conceived? 
	he that believeth in me,
	though . . . dead . . . shall he live—that is, The believer's
	death shall be swallowed up in life, and his life shall never sink
	into death. As death comes by sin, it is His to dissolve it; and as
	life flows through His righteousness, it is His to communicate and
	eternally maintain it (Romans 5:21).
	The temporary separation of soul and body is here regarded as not
	even interrupting, much less impairing, the new and everlasting life
	imparted by Jesus to His believing people. 
	Believest thou this?—Canst
	thou take this in?
