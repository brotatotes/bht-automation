33-38. When Jesus . . . saw her
	weeping, and the Jews . . . weeping . . . he groaned in the
	spirit—the tears of Mary and her friends acting sympathetically
	upon Jesus, and drawing forth His emotions. What a vivid and
	beautiful outcoming of His "real" humanity! The word here
	rendered "groaned" does not mean "sighed" or
	"grieved," but rather "powerfully checked his
	emotion"—made a visible effort to restrain those tears which
	were ready to gush from His eyes. 
	and was troubled—rather,
	"troubled himself" (Margin); referring probably to
	this visible difficulty of repressing His emotions.
