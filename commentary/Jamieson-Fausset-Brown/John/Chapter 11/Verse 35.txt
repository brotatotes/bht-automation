35. Jesus weptâ€”This
	beautifully conveys the sublime brevity of the two original words;
	else "shed tears" might have better conveyed the
	difference between the word here used and that twice employed in  :-, and there properly rendered "weeping," denoting
	the loud wail for the dead, while that of Jesus consisted of silent
	tears. Is it for nothing that the Evangelist, some sixty years
	after it occurred, holds up to all ages with such touching brevity
	the sublime spectacle of the Son of God in tears? What a seal
	of His perfect oneness with us in the most redeeming feature of our
	stricken humanity! But was there nothing in those tears beyond sorrow
	for human suffering and death? Could these effects move Him
	without suggesting the cause? Who can doubt that in His ear
	every feature of the scene proclaimed that stern law of the Kingdom,
	"The wages of sin is death" ( :-), and that this element in His visible emotion underlay all
	the rest?
