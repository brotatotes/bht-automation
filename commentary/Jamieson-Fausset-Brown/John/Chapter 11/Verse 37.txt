<p><b>some . . . said, Could not

	suspicion. It hardly goes the length of attesting the miracle on the
	blind man; but "if (as everybody says) He did that, why could He
	not also have kept Lazarus alive?" As to the restoration of the
	dead man to life, they never so much as thought of it. But <i>this
