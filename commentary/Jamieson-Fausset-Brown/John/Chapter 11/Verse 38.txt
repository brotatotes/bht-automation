<p><b>38. Jesus again groaning in
	himself</b>—that is, as at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, checked or repressed His rising feelings, in the former
	instance, of sorrow, here of righteous indignation at their
	unreasonable unbelief; (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) [WEBSTER and
	WILKINSON]. But here, too,
	struggling emotion was deeper, now that His eye was about to rest on
	the spot where lay, in the still horrors of death, His "friend."

<p><b>a cave</b>—the cavity,
	natural or artificial, of a rock. This, with the number of condoling
	visitors from Jerusalem, and the costly ointment with which Mary
	afterwards anointed Jesus at Bethany, all go to show that the family
	was in good circumstances.</p>
