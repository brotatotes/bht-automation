<p><b>4. When Jesus heard that, he said,
	This sickness is not unto death</b>—to <i>result</i> in death. 
	</p>
<p><b>but for the glory of God,
	that the Son of God may be glorified thereby</b>—that is, by this
	glory of God. (See <i>Greek</i>.) Remarkable language this, which
	from creature lips would have been intolerable. It means that the
	glory of GOD manifested in
	the resurrection of dead Lazarus would be shown to be the glory,
	<i>personally</i> and immediately, of THE
	SON.</p>
