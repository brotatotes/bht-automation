<p><b>40. Jesus saith unto her, Said I not
	unto thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the
	glory of God?</b>â€”He had not said those very words, but this was
	the scope of all that He had uttered to her about His life-giving
	power (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:23">John 11:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:25">John 11:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:26">John 11:26</span>); a gentle yet emphatic
	and most instructive rebuke: "Why doth the restoration of life,
	even to a decomposing corpse, seem hopeless in the presence of the
	Resurrection and the Life? Hast thou yet to learn that 'if thou canst
	believe, all things are possible to him that believeth?'" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+11:26- :">John 11:26- :</span>).</p>
