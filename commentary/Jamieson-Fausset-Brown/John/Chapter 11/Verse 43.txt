<p><b>43, 44. and when he had thus spoken,
	he cried with a loud voice</b>—On one other occasion only did He
	this—on the <i>cross.</i> His last utterance was a "loud cry"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:50">Matthew 27:50</span>). "He shall not
	cry," said the prophet, nor, in His ministry, did He. What a
	sublime contrast is this "loud cry" to the magical
	"whisperings" and "mutterings" of which we read
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:19">Isaiah 8:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+29:4">Isaiah 29:4</span>
	(as GROTIUS remarks)! It
	is second only to the grandeur of that voice which shall raise all
	the dead (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:28">John 5:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:29">John 5:29</span>;
