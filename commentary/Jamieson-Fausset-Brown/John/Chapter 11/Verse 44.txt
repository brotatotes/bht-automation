44. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him
	and let him goâ€”Jesus will no more do this Himself than roll
	away the stone. The one was the necessary preparation for
	resurrection, the other the necessary sequel to it. THE
	LIFE-GIVING ACT ALONE HE
	RESERVES TO HIMSELF.
	So in the quickening of the dead to spiritual life, human
	instrumentality is employed first to prepare the way, and then to
	turn it to account.
