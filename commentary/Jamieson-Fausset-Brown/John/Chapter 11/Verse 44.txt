<p><b>44. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him
	and let him go</b>â€”Jesus will no more do this Himself than roll
	away the stone. The one was the necessary <i>preparation</i> for
	resurrection, the other the necessary <i>sequel</i> to it. THE
	LIFE-GIVING ACT ALONE HE
	RESERVES TO HIMSELF.
	So <i>in the quickening of the dead to spiritual life, human
	instrumentality is employed first to prepare the way, and then to
	turn it to account.</i></p>
