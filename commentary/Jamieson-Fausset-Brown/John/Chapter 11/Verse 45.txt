45, 46. many . . . which . . . had
	seen . . . believed . . . But some . . . went . . . to the Pharisees
	and told them what Jesus had doneâ€”the two classes which
	continually reappear in the Gospel history; nor is there ever any
	great work of God which does not produce both. "It is remarkable
	that on each of the three occasions on which our Lord raised the
	dead, a large number of persons was assembled. In two instances, the
	resurrection of the widow's son and of Lazarus, these were all
	witnesses of the miracle; in the third (of Jairus' daughter) they
	were necessarily cognizant of it. Yet this important circumstance is
	in each case only incidentally noticed by the historians, not put
	forward or appealed to as a proof of their veracity. In regard to
	this miracle, we observe a greater degree of preparation, both in the
	provident arrangement of events, and in our Lord's actions and words
	than in any other. The preceding miracle (cure of the man born blind)
	is distinguished from all others by the open and formal investigation
	of its facts. And both these miracles, the most public and best
	attested of all, are related by John, who wrote long after the other
	Evangelists" [WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON].
