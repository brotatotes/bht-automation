5. Jesus loved Martha and her sister
	and Lazarus—what a picture!—one that in every age has
	attracted the admiration of the whole Christian Church. No wonder
	that those miserable skeptics who have carped at the ethical system
	of the Gospel, as not embracing private friendships in the list of
	its virtues, have been referred to the Saviour's peculiar regard for
	this family as a triumphant refutation, if such were needed.
