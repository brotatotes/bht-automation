<p><b>51. Caiaphas . . . prophesied that
	Jesus should die for that nation</b>â€”He meant nothing more than
	that the way to prevent the apprehended ruin of the nation was to
	make a sacrifice of the Disturber of their peace. But in giving
	utterance to this suggestion of political expediency, he was so
	guided as to give forth a divine prediction of deep significance; and
	God so ordered it that it should come from the lips of the high
	priest for that memorable year, the recognized head of God's visible
	people, whose ancient office, symbolized by the Urim and Thummim, was
	to decide in the last resort, all vital questions as the oracle of
	the divine will.</p>
