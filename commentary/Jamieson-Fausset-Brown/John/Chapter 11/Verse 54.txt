<p><b>47-54. What do we? for this man
	doeth many miracles</b>â€”"While we trifle, 'this man,' by His
	'many miracles,' will carry all before Him; the popular enthusiasm
	will bring on a revolution, which will precipitate the Romans upon
	us, and our all will go down in one common ruin." What a
	testimony to the reality of our Lord's miracles, and their resistless
	effect, from His bitterest enemies!</p>
