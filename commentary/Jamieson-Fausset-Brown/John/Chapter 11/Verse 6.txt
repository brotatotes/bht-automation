<p><b>6. When he heard he was sick, he
	abode two days still . . . where he was</b>—at least twenty-five
	miles off. Beyond all doubt this was just to let things come to their
	worst, in order to display His glory. But how trying, meantime, to
	the faith of his friends, and how unlike the way in which love to a
	dying friend usually shows itself, on which it is plain that Mary
	reckoned. But the ways of <i>divine</i> are not as the ways of <i>human</i>
	love. Often they are the reverse. When His people are sick, in body
	or spirit; when their case is waxing more and more desperate every
	day; when all hope of recovery is about to expire—just then and
	therefore it is that "<i>He abides two days still in the same
	place where He is.</i>" Can they still hope against hope? Often
	they do not; but "this is their infirmity." For it is His
	chosen style of acting. We have been well taught it, and should not
	<i>now</i> have the lesson to learn. From the days of Moses was it
	given sublimely forth as the character of His grandest
	interpositions, that "the Lord will judge His people and repent
	Himself for His servants"—<i>when He seeth that their power is
	gone</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:36">Deuteronomy 32:36</span>).</p>
