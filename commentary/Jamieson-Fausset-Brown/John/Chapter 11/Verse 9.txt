9. Jesus answered, Are there not
	twelve hours in the day?—(See on  :-). Our Lord's day had now reached its eleventh hour, and
	having till now "walked in the day," He would not mistime
	the remaining and more critical part of His work, which would be as
	fatal, He says, as omitting it altogether; for "if a man
	(so He speaks, putting Himself under the same great law of duty as
	all other men—if a man) walk in the night, he stumbleth, because
	there is no light in him."
