<p><b>9. Jesus answered, Are there not
	twelve hours in the day?</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Our Lord's day had now reached its eleventh hour, and
	having till now "walked in the day," He would not <i>mistime</i>
	the remaining and more critical part of His work, which would be as
	fatal, He says, as omitting it altogether; for "if <i>a man</i>
	(so He speaks, putting Himself under the same great law of duty as
	all other men—if a man) walk in the night, he stumbleth, because
	there is no light in him."</p>
