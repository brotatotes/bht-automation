<p><b>12. On the next day</b>â€”the Lord's
	day, or Sunday (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:1">John 12:1</span>);
	the tenth day of the Jewish month Nisan, on which the paschal lamb
	was set apart to be "kept up until the fourteenth day of the
	same month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel
	were to kill it in the evening" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:3">Exodus 12:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:6">Exodus 12:6</span>). Even so, from the day
	of this solemn entry into Jerusalem, "Christ our Passover"
	was virtually set apart to be "sacrificed for us" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+12:6- :">Exodus 12:6- :</span>).</p>
