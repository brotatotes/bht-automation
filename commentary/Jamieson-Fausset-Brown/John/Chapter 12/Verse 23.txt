<p><b>23-26. Jesus answered them, The hour
	is come that the Son of man should be glorified</b>—that is, They
	would see Jesus, would they? Yet a little moment, and they shall see
	Him so as now they dream not of. The middle wall of partition that
	keeps them out from the commonwealth of Israel is on the eve of
	breaking down, "and I, if I be lifted up from the earth, shall
	draw all men unto Me"; I see them "flying as a cloud, and
	as doves to their cotes"—a glorious event that will be for the
	Son of man, by which this is to be brought about. It is His <i>death</i>
	He thus sublimely and delicately alluded to. Lost in the scenes of
	triumph which this desire of the Greeks to see Him called up before
	His view, He gives no direct answer to their petition for an
	interview, but sees the cross which was to bring them gilded with
	glory.</p>
