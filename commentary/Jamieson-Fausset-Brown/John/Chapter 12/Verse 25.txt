<p><b>25. He that loveth his life shall
	lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto
	life eternal</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	Did our Lord mean to exclude Himself from the operation of the great
	principle here expressed—<i>self-renunciation, the law of
	self-preservation;</i> and its converse, <i>self-preservation, the
	law of self-destruction?</i> On the contrary, as He became Man to
	exemplify this fundamental law of the Kingdom of God in its most
	sublime form, so the very utterance of it on this occasion served to
	sustain His own Spirit in the double prospect to which He had just
	alluded.</p>
