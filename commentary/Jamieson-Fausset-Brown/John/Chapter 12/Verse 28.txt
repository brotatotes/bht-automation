<p><b>28. Father, glorify thy name</b>—by
	a present testimony. 
	</p>
<p><b>I have both glorified
	it</b>—referring specially to the voice from heaven at His <i>baptism,</i>
	and again at His <i>transfiguration.</i>
</p>
<p><b>and will glorify it
	again</b>—that is, in the yet future scenes of His still deeper
	necessity; although this promise was a present and sublime testimony,
	which would irradiate the clouded spirit of the Son of man.</p>
