<p><b>31. Now is the judgment of this
	world</b>—the world that "crucified the Lord of glory"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:8">1 Corinthians 2:8</span>), considered as a vast
	and complicated kingdom of Satan, breathing his spirit, doing his
	work, and involved in his doom, which Christ's death by its hands
	irrevocably sealed. 
	</p>
<p><b>now shall the prince of this
	world be cast out</b>—How differently is that fast-approaching
	"hour" regarded in the kingdoms of darkness and of light!
	"The hour of relief; from the dread Troubler of our peace—how
	near it is! Yet a little moment, and the day is ours!" So it was
	calculated and felt in the one region. "Now shall the prince of
	this world be cast out," is a somewhat different view of the
	same event. We know who was right. Though yet under a veil, He sees
	the triumphs of the Cross in unclouded and transporting light.</p>
