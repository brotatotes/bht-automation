<p><b>34. We have heard out of the law</b>—the
	scriptures of the Old Testament (referring to such places as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+89:28">Psalms 89:28</span>;

<p><b>and how sayest thou, The Son
	of Man must be lifted up,</b> c.—How can that consist with this
	"uplifting?" They saw very well both that He was holding
	Himself up as <i>the Christ</i> and <i>a Christ to die a violent
	death</i> and as that ran counter to all their ideas of the Messianic
	prophecies, they were glad to get this seeming advantage to justify
	their unyielding attitude.</p>
