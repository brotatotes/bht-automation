36. These things spake Jesus, and
	departed, and did hide himself from themâ€”He who spake as never
	man spake, and immediately after words fraught with unspeakable
	dignity and love, had to "hide Himself" from His auditors!
	What then must they have been? He retired, probably to
	Bethany. (The parallels are: Matthew 21:17;
	Luke 21:37).
