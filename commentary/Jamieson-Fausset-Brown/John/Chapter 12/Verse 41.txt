<p><b>41. These things said Esaias, when
	he saw his glory, and spake of him</b>â€”a key of immense importance
	to the opening of Isaiah's vision (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and all similar Old Testament representations. "THE
	SON is the King Jehovah
	who rules in the Old Testament and appears to the elect, as in the
	New Testament THE SPIRIT,
	the invisible Minister of the Son, is the Director of the Church and
	the Revealer in the sanctuary of the heart" [OLSHAUSEN].</p>
