<p><b>bare what was put

	simply, had charge of its contents, was treasurer to Jesus and the
	Twelve. How worthy of notice is this arrangement, by which an
	avaricious and dishonest person was not only taken into the number of
	the Twelve, but entrusted with the custody of their little property!
	The purposes which this served are obvious enough; but it is further
	noticeable, that the remotest hint was never given to the eleven of
	His true character, nor did the disciples most favored with the
	intimacy of Jesus ever suspect him, till a few minutes before he
	voluntarily separated himself from their company—for ever!</p>
