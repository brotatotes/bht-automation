<p><b>7. said Jesus, Let her alone,
	against the day of my burying hath she done this</b>â€”not that she
	thought of His burial, much less reserved any of her nard to anoint
	her dead Lord. But as the time was so near at hand when that office
	would have to be performed, <i>and she was not to have that privilege
	even alter the spices were brought for the purpose</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), He lovingly <i>regards it as done now.</i></p>
