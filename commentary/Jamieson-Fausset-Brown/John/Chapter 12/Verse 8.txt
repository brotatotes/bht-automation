<p><b>but me . . . not always</b>—a
	gentle hint of His approaching departure. He adds (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+15:11- :">Deuteronomy 15:11- :</span>), "<i>She hath done what she could,</i>" a noble
	testimony, embodying a principle of immense importance. "Verily,
	I say unto you, Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached in the
	whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be
	told for a memorial of her" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:13">Matthew 26:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:9">Mark 14:9</span>). "In the act of
	love done to Him she had erected to herself an eternal monument, as
	lasting as the Gospel, the eternal word of God. From generation to
	generation this remarkable prophecy of the Lord has been fulfilled;
	and even we, in explaining this saying of the Redeemer, of necessity
	contribute to its accomplishment" [OLSHAUSEN].
	"Who but Himself had the power to ensure to any work of man,
	even if resounding in his own time through the whole earth, an
	imperishable remembrance in the stream of history? Behold once more
	here, the majesty of His royal judicial supremacy in the government
	of the world, in this, Verily I say unto you" [STIER].
	Beautiful are the lessons here: (1) <i>Love to Christ transfigures
	the humblest services.</i> All, indeed, who have themselves a heart
	value its least outgoings beyond the most costly mechanical
	performances; but how does it endear the Saviour to us to find Him
	endorsing the principle as His own standard in judging of character
	and deeds!

<p>(2) Works of <i>utility</i> should
	never be set in opposition to the promptings of self-sacrificing
	<i>love,</i> and the sincerity of those who do so is to be suspected.
	Under the mask of concern for the poor at home, how many excuse
	themselves from all care of the perishing heathen abroad. (3) Amidst
	conflicting duties, that which our "hand (<i>presently</i>)
	findeth to do" is to be preferred, and even a less duty <i>only
	to be done now</i> to a greater <i>that can be done at any time.</i>
	(4) "If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according
	to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:9- :">Mark 14:9- :</span>). —"She hath done what she could" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:9- :">Mark 14:9- :</span>). (5) As Jesus beheld in spirit the universal diffusion of
	His Gospel, while His lowest depth of humiliation was only
	approaching, so He regards <i>the facts of His earthly history</i> as
	constituting <i>the substance of this Gospel,</i> and the relation of
	them as just the "preaching of this Gospel." Not that
	preachers are to confine themselves to a bare narration of these
	facts, but that they are to make their whole preaching turn upon them
	as its grand center, and derive from them its proper vitality; all
	that goes before this in the Bible being but the <i>preparation</i>
	for them, and all that follows but the <i>sequel.</i></p>
