<p><b>10. He that is washed</b>—in this
	<i>thorough</i> sense, to express which the word is carefully changed
	to one meaning to wash <i>as in a bath.</i>
</p>
<p><b>needeth not</b>—to be so
	washed any more. 
	</p>
<p><b>save to wash his feet</b>—needeth
	to do no more than wash his feet (and here the former word is
	resumed, meaning to wash <i>the hands or feet</i>). 
	</p>
<p><b>but is clean every whit</b>—as
	a whole. This sentence is singularly instructive. Of the <i>two
	cleansings,</i> the one points to that which takes place at the
	<i>commencement</i> of the Christian life, embracing <i>complete
	absolution from sin as a guilty state,</i> and <i>entire deliverance
	from it as a polluted life</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>) —or, in the language
	of theology, <i>Justification</i> and <i>Regeneration.</i> This
	cleansing is effected <i>once for all,</i> and is never repeated. The
	other cleansing, described as that of "the feet," is <i>such
	as one walking from a bath quite cleansed still needs, in consequence
	of his contact with the earth.</i> (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:18">Exodus 30:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:19">Exodus 30:19</span>). It is the <i>daily</i>
	cleansing which we are taught to seek, when in the spirit of adoption
	we say, "Our Father which art in heaven . . . <i>forgive us our
	debts</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:9">Matthew 6:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>); and, when burdened
	with the sense of manifold shortcomings—as what tender spirit of a
	Christian is not?—is it not a relief to be permitted thus to wash
	our feet after a day's contact with the earth? This is not to call in
	question the completeness of our past justification. Our Lord, while
	graciously insisting on washing Peter's feet, refuses to extend the
	cleansing farther, that the symbolical instruction intended to be
	conveyed might not be marred. 
	</p>
<p><b>and ye are clean</b>—in the
	first and <i>whole</i> sense. 
	</p>
<p><b>but not all</b>—important,
	as showing that Judas, instead of being as true-hearted a disciple as
	the rest at first, and merely <i>falling away</i> afterwards—as
	many represent it—<i>never experienced that cleansing at all which
	made the others what they were.</i></p>
