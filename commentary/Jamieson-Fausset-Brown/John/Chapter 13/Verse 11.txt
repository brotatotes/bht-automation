<p><b>6-11. Peter saith . . . Lord, dost
	thou wash my feet?</b>â€”Our language cannot bring out the intensely
	vivid contrast between the "<i>Thou</i>" and the "<i>my,</i>"
	which, by bringing them together, the original expresses, for it is
	not good English to say, "Lord, <i>Thou my</i> feet dost wash?"
	But <i>every word</i> of this question is emphatic. Thus far, and in
	the question itself, there was nothing but the most profound and
	beautiful astonishment at a condescension to him quite
	incomprehensible. Accordingly, though there can be no doubt that
	already Peter's heart rebelled against it as a thing not to be
	tolerated, Jesus ministers no rebuke as yet, but only bids him wait a
	little, and he should understand it all.</p>
