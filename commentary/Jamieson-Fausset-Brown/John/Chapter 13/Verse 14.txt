<p><b>14. If I then</b>—the Lord. 
	</p>
<p><b>have washed your feet</b>—the
	servants'. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye</b>—but fellow servants.
	</p>
<p><b>ought to wash one another's
	feet</b>—not in the narrow sense of a literal washing, profanely
	caricatured by popes and emperors, but by the very humblest <i>real</i>
	services one to another.</p>
