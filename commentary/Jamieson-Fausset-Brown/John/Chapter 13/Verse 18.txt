<p><b>18, 19. I speak not of you all</b>—the
	"happy <i>are</i> ye," of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, being on no supposition applicable to Judas. 
	</p>
<p><b>I know whom I have chosen</b>—in
	the <i>higher</i> sense. 
	</p>
<p><b>But that the scripture may be
	fulfilled</b>—that is, one has been added to your number, by no
	accident or mistake, who is none of Mine, but just that he might
	fulfil his predicted destiny.

<p><b>He that eateth bread with

	(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:29">Hebrews 10:29</span>). In the
	Psalm the immediate reference is to Ahithophel's treachery against
	David (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+17:1-23">2 Samuel 17:1-23</span>),
	one of those scenes in which the parallel of his story with that of
	His great Antitype is exceedingly striking. "The eating bread
	derives a fearful meaning from the participation in the sacramental
	supper, a meaning which must be applied for ever to all unworthy
	communicants, as well as to all betrayers of Christ who eat the bread
	of His Church" (STIER,
	with whom, and others, we agree in thinking that Judas partook of the
	Lord's Supper).</p>
