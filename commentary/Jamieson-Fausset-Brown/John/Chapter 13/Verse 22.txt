<p><b>22. the disciples looked one on
	another, doubting of whom he spake</b>—Further intensely
	interesting particulars are given in the other Gospels: (1) "They
	were exceeding sorrowful" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). (2) "They began to inquire among themselves which of
	them it was that should do this thing" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). (3) "They began to say unto Him one by one, Is it I,
	and another, Is it I?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Generous, simple hearts! They abhorred the thought, but,
	instead of putting it on others, each was only anxious to purge
	<i>himself</i> and know if <i>he</i> could be the wretch. Their
	putting it at once to Jesus Himself, as knowing doubtless who was to
	do it, was the best, as it certainly was the most spontaneous and
	artless evidence of their innocence. (4) Jesus, apparently while this
	questioning was going on, added, "The Son of man goeth as it is
	written of Him, but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is
	betrayed! It had been good for that man if he had not been born"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24">Matthew 26:24</span>). (5) "Judas,"
	<i>last of all,</i> "answered and said, <i>Lord, is it I?</i>"
	evidently feeling that when all were saying this, if he held his
	peace, that of itself would draw suspicion upon him. To prevent this
	the question is wrung out of him, but perhaps, amidst the stir and
	excitement at the table, in a half-suppressed tone as we are inclined
	to think the answer also was—"Thou hast said" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24- :">Matthew 26:24- :</span>), or possibly by little more than a sign; for from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:24- :">Matthew 26:24- :</span> it is evident that till the moment when he went out, he was
	not openly discovered.</p>
