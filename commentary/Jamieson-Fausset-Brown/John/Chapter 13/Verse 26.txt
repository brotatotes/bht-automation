26. Jesus answered—also
	inaudibly, the answer being communicated to Peter perhaps from
	behind. 
	He . . . to whom I shall give
	a sop when I have dipped it—a piece of the bread soaked in the
	wine or the sauce of the dish; one of the ancient ways of testifying
	peculiar regard; compare  :-, "he that eateth bread with Me." 
	And when he had dipped . . .
	he gave it to Judas, &c.—Thus the sign of Judas' treachery
	was an affecting expression, and the last, of the Saviour's wounded
	love!
