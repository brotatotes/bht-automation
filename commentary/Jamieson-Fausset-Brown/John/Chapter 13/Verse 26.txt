<p><b>26. Jesus answered</b>—<i>also
	inaudibly,</i> the answer being communicated to Peter perhaps from
	behind. 
	</p>
<p><b>He . . . to whom I shall give
	a sop when I have dipped it</b>—a piece of the bread soaked in the
	wine or the sauce of the dish; one of the ancient ways of testifying
	peculiar regard; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "<i>he that eateth bread with Me.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>And when he had dipped . . .
	he gave it to Judas,</b> &amp;c.—Thus the sign of Judas' treachery
	was an affecting expression, and the last, of the Saviour's wounded
	love!</p>
