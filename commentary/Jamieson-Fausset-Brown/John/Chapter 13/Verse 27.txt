<p><b>27-30. after the sop Satan entered
	into him</b>—Very solemn are these brief hints of the successive
	steps by which Judas reached the climax of his guilt. "The devil
	had already put it into his heart to betray his Lord." Yet who
	can tell what struggles he went through ere he brought himself to
	carry that suggestion into effect? Even after this, however, his
	compunctions were not at an end. With the thirty pieces of silver
	already in his possession, he seems still to have quailed—and can
	we wonder? When Jesus stooped to wash his feet, it may be the last
	struggle was reaching its crisis. But that word of the Psalm, about
	"one that ate of his bread who would lift up his heel against
	Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:9">Psalms 41:9</span>) probably
	all but turned the dread scale, and the still more explicit
	announcement, that one of those sitting with Him at the table should
	betray Him, would beget the thought, "I am detected; it is now
	too late to draw back." At that moment the sop is given; offer
	of friendship is once more made—and how affectingly! But already
	"Satan has <i>entered into him,</i>" and though the
	Saviour's act might seem enough to recall him even yet, hell is now
	in his bosom, and he says within himself, "The die is cast; now
	let me go through with it"; fear, begone!" (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:9- :">Psalms 41:9- :</span>).

<p><b>Then said Jesus unto him,
	That thou doest, do quickly</b>—that is, Why linger here? Thy
	presence is a restraint, and thy work stands still; thou hast the
	wages of iniquity, go work for it!</p>
