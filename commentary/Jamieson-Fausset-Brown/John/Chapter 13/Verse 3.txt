<p><b>3. Jesus knowing that the Father had
	given all things into his hands,</b> &amp;c.â€”This verse is very
	sublime, and as a preface to what follows, were we not familiar with
	it, would fill us with inexpressible surprise. An unclouded
	perception of His relation to the Father, the commission He held from
	Him, and His approaching return to Him, possessed His soul.</p>
