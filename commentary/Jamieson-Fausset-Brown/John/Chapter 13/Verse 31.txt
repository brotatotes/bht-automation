<p><b>31. when he was gone out, Jesus
	said, Now is the Son of man glorified</b>—These remarkable words
	plainly imply that up to this moment our Lord had spoken <i>under a
	painful restraint,</i> the presence of a traitor within the little
	circle of His holiest fellowship on earth preventing the free and
	full outpouring of His heart; as is evident, indeed, from those
	oft-recurring clauses, "Ye are not all clean," "I
	speak not of you all," &amp;c. "Now" the restraint is
	removed, and the embankment which kept in the mighty volume of living
	waters having broken down, they burst forth in a torrent which only
	ceases on His leaving the supper room and entering on the next stage
	of His great work—the scene in the Garden. But with what words is
	the silence first broken on the departure of Judas? By no reflections
	on the traitor, and, what is still more wonderful, by no reference to
	the dread character of His own approaching sufferings. He does not
	even name them, save by announcing, as with a burst of triumph, that
	the hour of His <i>glory</i> has arrived! And what is very
	remarkable, in five brief clauses He repeats this word "glorify"
	<i>five times,</i> as if to His view a coruscation of glories played
	at that moment about the Cross. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>God is glorified in him</b>—the
	glory of Each reaching its zenith in the Death of the Cross!</p>
