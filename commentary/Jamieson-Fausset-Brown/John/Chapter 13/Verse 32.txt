<p><b>32. If God be glorified in him, God
	shall also</b>—in return and reward of this highest of all services
	ever rendered to Him, or capable of being rendered. 
	</p>
<p><b>glorify him in himself, and .
	. . straightway glorify him</b>—referring now to the Resurrection
	and Exaltation of Christ <i>after</i> this service was over,
	including all the honor and glory then put upon Him, and that will
	for ever encircle Him as Head of the new creation.</p>
