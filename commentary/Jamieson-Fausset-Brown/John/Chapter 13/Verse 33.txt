<p><b>33-35. Little children</b>—From
	the height of His own glory He now descends, with sweet pity, to His
	"little children," <i>all now His own.</i> This term of
	endearment, nowhere else used in the Gospels, and once only employed
	by Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:19">Galatians 4:19</span>), is
	appropriated by the beloved disciple himself, who no fewer than seven
	times employs it in his first Epistle. 
	</p>
<p><b>Ye shall seek me</b>—feel
	the want of Me. 
	</p>
<p><b>as I said to the Jews</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:34">John 7:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:21">John 8:21</span>).
	But oh in what a different sense!</p>
