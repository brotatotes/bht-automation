<p><b>34. a new commandment I give unto
	you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love
	one another</b>â€”This was the <i>new</i> feature of it. Christ's
	love to His people in giving His life a ransom for them was
	altogether new, and consequently as a Model and Standard for theirs
	to one another. It is not, however, something transcending the great
	moral law, which is "the <i>old</i> commandment" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>),
	but that law <i>in a new and peculiar form.</i> Hence it is said to
	be both <i>new</i> and <i>old</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:7">1 John 2:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:8">1 John 2:8</span>).</p>
