36-38. Peter said—seeing
	plainly in these directions how to behave themselves, that He was
	indeed going from them. 
	Lord, whither guest
	thou?—having hardly a glimmer of the real truth. 
	Jesus answered, . . . thou
	canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me afterwards—How
	different from what He said to the Jews: "Whither I go ye
	cannot come" (John 8:21).
