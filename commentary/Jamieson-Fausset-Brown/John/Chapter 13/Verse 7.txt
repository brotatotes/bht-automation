<p><b>7. Jesus answered and said . . .
	What I do thou knowest not now</b>—that is, Such condescension <i>does</i>
	need explanation; it <i>is</i> fitted to astonish. 
	</p>
<p><b>but thou shall know
	hereafter</b>—afterwards, meaning <i>presently;</i> though viewed
	as a general maxim, applicable to all dark sayings in God's Word, and
	dark doings in God's providence, these words are full of consolation.</p>
