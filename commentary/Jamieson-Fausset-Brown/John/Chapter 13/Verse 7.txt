7. Jesus answered and said . . .
	What I do thou knowest not now—that is, Such condescension does
	need explanation; it is fitted to astonish. 
	but thou shall know
	hereafter—afterwards, meaning presently; though viewed
	as a general maxim, applicable to all dark sayings in God's Word, and
	dark doings in God's providence, these words are full of consolation.
