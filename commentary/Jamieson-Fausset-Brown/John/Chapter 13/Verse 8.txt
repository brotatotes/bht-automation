8. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt
	never wash, &c.—more emphatically, "Never shalt Thou
	wash my feet": that is, "That is an incongruity to which I
	can never submit." How like the man! 
	If I wash thee not, thou hast
	no part with me—What Peter could not submit to was, that the
	Master should serve His servant. But the whole saving work of
	Christ was one continued series of such services, ending with and
	consummated by the most self-sacrificing and transcendent of all
	services: THE SON
	OF MAN CAME not
	to be ministered unto, but TO
	MINISTER, AND TO GIVE HIS
	LIFE A RANSOM FOR MANY. (See on  :-). If Peter then could not submit to let his Master go down
	so low as to wash his feet, how should he suffer himself to be
	served by Him at all? This is couched under the one pregnant word
	"wash," which though applicable to the lower
	operation which Peter resisted, is the familiar scriptural symbol of
	that higher cleansing, which Peter little thought he was at
	the same time virtually putting from him. It is not humility to
	refuse what the Lord deigns to do for us, or to deny what He has
	done, but it is self-willed presumption—not rare, however,
	in those inner circles of lofty religious profession and traditional
	spirituality, which are found wherever Christian truth has enjoyed
	long and undisturbed possession. The truest humility is to
	receive reverentially, and thankfully to own, the gifts of grace.
