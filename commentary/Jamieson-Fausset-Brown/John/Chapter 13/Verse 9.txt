<p><b>9. Lord, not my feet only, but also
	my hands and my head</b>â€”that is, "To be severed from Thee,
	Lord, is death to me: If that be the meaning of my speech, I tread
	upon it; and if to be washed of Thee have such significance, then not
	my feet only, but hands, head, and all, be washed!" This artless
	expression of clinging, life-and-death attachment to Jesus, and felt
	dependence upon Him for his whole spiritual well-being, compared with
	the similar saying in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:68">John 6:68</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:69">John 6:69</span> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:69- :">John 6:69- :</span>), furnishes such evidence of <i>historic verity</i> such
	as no thoroughly honest mind can resist.</p>
