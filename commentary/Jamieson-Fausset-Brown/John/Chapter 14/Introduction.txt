<p>We now come to that portion of the
	evangelical history which we may with propriety call its <i>Holy of
	Holies.</i> Our Evangelist, like a consecrated priest, alone opens up
	to us the view into this sanctuary. It is the record of the last
	moments spent by the Lord in the midst of His disciples before His
	passion, when words full of heavenly thought flowed from His sacred
	lips. All that His heart, glowing with love, had still to say to His
	friends, was compressed into this short season. At first (from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) the intercourse took the form of conversation; sitting at
	table, they talked familiarly together. But when (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) the repast was finished, the language of Christ assumed a
	loftier strain; the disciples, assembled around their Master,
	listened to the words of life, and seldom spoke a word (only <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:17">John 16:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:29">John 16:29</span>). "At length, in
	the Redeemer's sublime intercessory prayer, His full soul was poured
	forth in express petitions to His heavenly Father on behalf of those
	who were His own. It is a peculiarity of these last chapters, that
	they treat almost exclusively of the most profound relationsâ€”as
	that of the Son to the Father, and of both to the Spirit, that of
	Christ to the Church, of the Church to the world, and so forth.
	Moreover, a considerable portion of these sublime communications
	surpassed the point of view to which the disciples had at that time
	attained; hence the Redeemer frequently repeats the same sentiments
	in order to impress them more deeply upon their minds, and, because
	of what they still did not understand, points them to the Holy
	Spirit, who would remind them of all His sayings, and lead them into
	all truth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span>)"
