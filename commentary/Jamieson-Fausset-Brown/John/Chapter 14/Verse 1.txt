<p><b>1. Let not your heart be troubled,</b>
	c.—What myriads of souls have not these opening words cheered, in
	deepest gloom, since first they were uttered! 
	</p>
<p><b>ye believe in God</b>—absolutely.
	</p>
<p><b>believe also in me</b>—that
	is, Have the <i>same trust</i> in Me. What less, and what else, can
	these words mean? And if so, what a demand to make by one sitting
	familiarly with them at the supper table! Compare the saying in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, for which the Jews took up stones to stone Him, as "making
	himself equal with God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). But it is no <i>transfer of our trust from its proper
	Object</i> it is but <i>the concentration of our trust in the Unseen
	and Impalpable One upon His Own Incarnate Son,</i> by which that
	trust, instead of the distant, unsteady, and too often cold and
	scarce real thing it otherwise is, acquires a conscious reality,
	warmth, and power, which makes all things new. <i>This is
	Christianity in brief.</i></p>
