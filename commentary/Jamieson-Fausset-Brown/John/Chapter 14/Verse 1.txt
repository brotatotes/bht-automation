1. Let not your heart be troubled,
	c.—What myriads of souls have not these opening words cheered, in
	deepest gloom, since first they were uttered! 
	ye believe in God—absolutely.
	believe also in me—that
	is, Have the same trust in Me. What less, and what else, can
	these words mean? And if so, what a demand to make by one sitting
	familiarly with them at the supper table! Compare the saying in  :-, for which the Jews took up stones to stone Him, as "making
	himself equal with God" ( :-). But it is no transfer of our trust from its proper
	Object it is but the concentration of our trust in the Unseen
	and Impalpable One upon His Own Incarnate Son, by which that
	trust, instead of the distant, unsteady, and too often cold and
	scarce real thing it otherwise is, acquires a conscious reality,
	warmth, and power, which makes all things new. This is
	Christianity in brief.
