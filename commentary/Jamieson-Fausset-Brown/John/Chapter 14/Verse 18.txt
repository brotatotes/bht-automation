<p><b>18-20. I will not leave you
	comfortless</b>—in a bereaved and desolate condition; or (as in
	<i>Margin</i>) "orphans." 
	</p>
<p><b>I will come to you</b>—"I
	come" or "am coming" to you; that is, plainly <i>by
	the Spirit,</i> since it was to make His departure to be <i>no
	bereavement.</i></p>
