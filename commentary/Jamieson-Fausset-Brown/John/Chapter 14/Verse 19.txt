<p><b>19. world seeth</b>—beholdeth.

<p><b>me</b>—His bodily presence,
	being all the sight of Him which "the world" ever had, or
	was capable of, it "beheld Him no more" after His departure
	to the Father; but by the coming of the Spirit, the presence of
	Christ was not only <i>continued</i> to His spiritually enlightened
	disciples, but rendered <i>far more efficacious and blissful</i> than
	His bodily presence had been before the Spirit's coming. 
	</p>
<p><b>because I live</b>—not
	"<i>shall</i> live," only when raised from the dead; for it
	is His unextinguishable, divine life of which He speaks, in view of
	which His <i>death and resurrection</i> were but as shadows passing
	over the sun's glorious disk. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:5">Luke 24:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:18">Revelation 1:18</span>, "the Living One").
	And this grand saying Jesus uttered <i>with death immediately in
	view.</i> What a brightness does this throw over the next clause, "ye
	shall live also!" "Knowest thou not," said LUTHER
	to the King of Terrors, "that thou didst devour the Lord Christ,
	but wert obliged to give Him back, and wert devoured of Him? So thou
	must leave me undevoured because I abide in Him, and live and suffer
	for His name's sake. Men may hunt me out of the world—that I care
	not for—but I shall not on that account abide in death. I shall
	live with my Lord Christ, since I know and believe that <i>He
	liveth!</i>" (quoted in STIER).</p>
