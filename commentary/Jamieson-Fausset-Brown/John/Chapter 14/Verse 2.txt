<p><b>2. In my Father's house are many
	mansions</b>—and so room for all, and a place for each. 
	</p>
<p><b>if not, I would have told
	you</b>—that is, I would tell you so at once; I would not deceive
	you. 
	</p>
<p><b>I go to prepare a place for
	you</b>—to obtain for you a right to be there, and to possess your
	"place."</p>
