<p><b>22. Judas saith . . . not
	Iscariot</b>—Beautiful parenthesis this! The traitor being no
	longer present, we needed not to be told that this question came not
	from <i>him.</i> But it is as if the Evangelist had said, "A
	very different Judas from the traitor, and a very different question
	from any that he would have put. Indeed [as one in STIER
	says], we never read of Iscariot that he entered in any way into his
	Master's words, or ever put a question even of rash curiosity (though
	it may be he did, but that nothing from <i>him</i> was deemed fit for
	immortality in the Gospels but his name and treason)." 
	</p>
<p><b>how . . . manifest thyself to
	us, and not to the world</b>—a most natural and proper question,
	founded on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:19">John 14:19</span>, though
	interpreters speak against it as <i>Jewish.</i></p>
