22. Judas saith . . . not
	Iscariot—Beautiful parenthesis this! The traitor being no
	longer present, we needed not to be told that this question came not
	from him. But it is as if the Evangelist had said, "A
	very different Judas from the traitor, and a very different question
	from any that he would have put. Indeed [as one in STIER
	says], we never read of Iscariot that he entered in any way into his
	Master's words, or ever put a question even of rash curiosity (though
	it may be he did, but that nothing from him was deemed fit for
	immortality in the Gospels but his name and treason)." 
	how . . . manifest thyself to
	us, and not to the world—a most natural and proper question,
	founded on John 14:19, though
	interpreters speak against it as Jewish.
