<p><b>23. we will come and make our abode
	with him</b>â€”Astonishing statement! In the Father's "coming"
	He "refers to the revelation of Him <i>as a Father</i> to the
	soul, which does not take place till the Spirit comes into the heart,
	teaching it to cry, <i>Abba,</i> Father" [OLSHAUSEN].
	The "abode" means a permanent, eternal stay! (Compare
