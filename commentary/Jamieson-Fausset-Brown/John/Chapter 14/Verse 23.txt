23. we will come and make our abode
	with himâ€”Astonishing statement! In the Father's "coming"
	He "refers to the revelation of Him as a Father to the

	The "abode" means a permanent, eternal stay! (Compare
	Leviticus 26:11; Leviticus 26:12;
	Ezekiel 37:26; Ezekiel 37:27;
	2 Corinthians 6:16; and contrast 2 Corinthians 6:16- :).
