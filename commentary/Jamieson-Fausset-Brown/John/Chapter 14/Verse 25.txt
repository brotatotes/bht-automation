25, 26. he shall teach you all
	things, and bring all to . . . remembrance, whatsoever I have said
	unto youâ€”(See on John 14:1;
	John 14:1). As the Son came in
	the Father's name, so the Father shall send the Spirit in
	My name, says Jesus, that is, with like divine power and
	authority to reproduce in their souls what Christ taught them,
	"bringing to living consciousness what lay like slumbering germs
	in their minds" [OLSHAUSEN].
	On this rests the credibility and ultimate divine authority of
	THE GOSPEL
	HISTORY. The whole of what is here said of THE
	SPIRIT is decisive of His
	divine personality. "He who can regard all the personal
	expressions, applied to the Spirit in these three chapters
	('teaching,' 'reminding,' 'testifying,' 'coming,' 'convincing,'
	'guiding,' 'speaking,' 'hearing,' 'prophesying,' 'taking') as being
	no other than a long drawn-out figure, deserves not to be recognized
	even as an interpreter of intelligible words, much less an expositor
	of Holy Scripture" [STIER].
