	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:1">John 14:1</span>). As the Son came in
	<i>the Father's</i> name, so the Father shall send the Spirit <i>in
	My name,</i> says Jesus, that is, with like divine <i>power</i> and
	<i>authority</i> to reproduce in their souls what Christ taught them,
	"bringing to living consciousness what lay like slumbering germs
	in their minds" [OLSHAUSEN].
	<i>On this rests the credibility and ultimate divine authority of</i>
	THE GOSPEL
	HISTORY. The whole of what is here said of THE
	SPIRIT is decisive of His
	divine <i>personality.</i> "He who can regard all the <i>personal</i>
	expressions, applied to the Spirit in these three chapters
	('teaching,' 'reminding,' 'testifying,' 'coming,' 'convincing,'
	'guiding,' 'speaking,' 'hearing,' 'prophesying,' 'taking') as being
	no other than a long drawn-out figure, deserves not to be recognized
	even as an interpreter of intelligible words, much less an expositor
	of Holy Scripture" [STIER].</p>
