<p><b>27. Peace I leave with you, my peace
	I give unto you</b>—If <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:25">John 14:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:26">John 14:26</span> sounded like a note of
	preparation for drawing the discourse to a close, this would sound
	like a farewell. But oh, how different from ordinary adieus! It <i>is</i>
	a parting word, but of richest import, the customary "peace"
	of a parting friend sublimed and transfigured. As "the Prince of
	Peace" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>) He brought
	it into flesh, carried it about in His Own Person ("My peace")
	died to make it ours, left it as the heritage of His disciples upon
	earth, implants and maintains it by His Spirit in their hearts. Many
	a legacy is "left" that is never "given" to the
	legatee, many a gift destined that never reaches its proper object.
	But Christ is the Executor of His own Testament; the peace He
	"<i>leaves</i>" He "<i>gives</i>"; Thus all is
	secure. 
	</p>
<p><b>not as the world giveth</b>—in
	contrast with the world, He gives <i>sincerely, substantially,
	eternally.</i></p>
