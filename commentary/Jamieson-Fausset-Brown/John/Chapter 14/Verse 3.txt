<p><b>3. I will come again and receive you
	unto myself</b>—<i>strictly,</i> at His Personal appearing; but in
	a secondary and comforting sense, to each individually. Mark again
	the claim made:—to come again to receive His people <i>to Himself,</i>
	that where <i>He</i> is there they may be also. <i>He thinks it ought
	to be enough to be assured that they shall be where He is and in His
	keeping.</i></p>
