<p><b>31. But that the world may know that
	I love the Father,</b> c.—The sense must be completed thus: "But
	to the Prince of the world, though he has nothing in Me, I shall
	yield Myself up even unto death, that the world may know that I love
	and obey the Father, whose commandment it is that I give My life a
	ransom for many."

<p><b>Arise, let us go hence</b>—Did
	they then, at this stage of the discourse, leave the supper room, as
	some able interpreters conclude? If so, we think our Evangelist would
	have mentioned it: see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:1">John 18:1</span>,
	which seems clearly to intimate that they then only left the upper
	room. But what do the words mean if not this? We think it was the
	dictate of that saying of earlier date, "I have a baptism to be
	baptized with, and <i>how am I straitened till it be accomplished!</i>"—a
	spontaneous and irrepressible expression of the deep eagerness of His
	spirit to get into the conflict, and that if, as is likely, it was
	responded to somewhat too literally by the guests who hung on His
	lips, in the way of a movement to depart, a wave of His hand, would
	be enough to show that He had yet more to say ere they broke up and
	that disciple, whose pen was dipped in a love to his Master which
	made <i>their</i> movements of small consequence save when essential
	to the illustration of <i>His</i> words, would record this little
	outburst of the Lamb hastening to the slaughter, in the very midst of
	His lofty discourse; while the effect of it, if any, upon His
	hearers, as of no consequence, would naturally enough be passed over.</p>
