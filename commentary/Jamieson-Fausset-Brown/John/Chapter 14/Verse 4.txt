<p><b>4-7. whither I go ye know . . .
	Thomas saith, Lord, we know not whither thou guest . . . Jesus saith,
	I am the way,</b> c.—By saying this, He meant rather to draw out
	their inquiries and reply to them. Christ is "THE
	WAY" to the
	Father—"no man cometh unto the Father but by Me" He is
	"THE TRUTH"
	of all we find in the Father when we get to Him, "For in Him
	dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and He is all "THE
	LIFE" that shall ever
	flow to us and bless us from the Godhead thus approached and thus
	manifested in Him—"this is the true God and eternal life"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:20">1 John 5:20</span>).</p>
