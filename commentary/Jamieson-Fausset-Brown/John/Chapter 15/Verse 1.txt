<p><b>1-8.</b> <i>The spiritual oneness of
	Christ and His people, and His relation to them as the Source of all
	their spiritual life and fruitfulness,</i> are here beautifully set
	forth by a figure familiar to Jewish ears (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, &amp;c.). 
	</p>
<p><b>I am the true vine</b>—of
	whom the vine of <i>nature</i> is but a shadow. 
	</p>
<p><b>my Father is the
	husbandman</b>—the great Proprietor of the vineyard, the Lord of
	the spiritual kingdom. (It is surely unnecessary to point out the
	claim to <i>supreme divinity</i> involved in this).</p>
