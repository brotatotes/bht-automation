1-8. The spiritual oneness of
	Christ and His people, and His relation to them as the Source of all
	their spiritual life and fruitfulness, are here beautifully set

	I am the true vine—of
	whom the vine of nature is but a shadow. 
	my Father is the
	husbandman—the great Proprietor of the vineyard, the Lord of
	the spiritual kingdom. (It is surely unnecessary to point out the
	claim to supreme divinity involved in this).
