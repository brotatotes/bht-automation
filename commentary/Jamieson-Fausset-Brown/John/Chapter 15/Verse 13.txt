<p><b>13. Greater love hath no man than
	this, that a man lay down his life for his friends</b>â€”The emphasis
	lies not on "friends," but on "<i>laying down his
	life</i>" for them; that is, "One can show no greater
	regard for those dear to him than to give his life for them, and this
	is the love ye shall find in Me."</p>
