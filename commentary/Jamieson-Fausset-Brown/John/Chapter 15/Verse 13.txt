13. Greater love hath no man than
	this, that a man lay down his life for his friendsâ€”The emphasis
	lies not on "friends," but on "laying down his
	life" for them; that is, "One can show no greater
	regard for those dear to him than to give his life for them, and this
	is the love ye shall find in Me."
