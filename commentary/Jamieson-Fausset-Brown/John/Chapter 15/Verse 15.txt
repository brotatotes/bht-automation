15. Henceforth I call you not
	servants—that is, in the sense explained in the next
	words; for servants He still calls them ( :-), and they delight to call themselves so, in the sense of
	being "under law to Christ" ( :-). 
	the servant knoweth not what
	his lord doeth—knows nothing of his master's plans and
	reasons, but simply receives and executes his orders. 
	but . . . friends, for all
	things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto
	you—admitted you to free, unrestrained fellowship, keeping back
	nothing from you which I have received to communicate. (Compare
	Genesis 18:17; Psalms 25:14;
	Isaiah 50:4).
