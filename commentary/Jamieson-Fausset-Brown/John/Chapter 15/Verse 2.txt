<p><b>2. Every branch in me that beareth
	not fruit . . . every branch that beareth fruit</b>—As in a fruit
	tree, some branches may be <i>fruitful,</i> others quite <i>barren,</i>
	according as there is a <i>vital connection</i> between the branch
	and the stock, or <i>no vital connection;</i> so the disciples of
	Christ may be spiritually fruitful or the reverse, according as they
	are <i>vitally</i> and <i>spiritually connected</i> with Christ, or
	but <i>externally</i> and <i>mechanically attached</i> to Him. The
	fruitless He "taketh away" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); the fruitful He "purgeth" (cleanseth,
	pruneth)—<i>stripping it,</i> as the husbandman does, <i>of what is
	rank</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:19">Mark 4:19</span>), "that
	it may bring forth more fruit"; a process often painful, but no
	less needful and beneficial than in the natural husbandry.</p>
