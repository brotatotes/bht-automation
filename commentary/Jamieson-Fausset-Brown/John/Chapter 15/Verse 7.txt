<p><b>7. If ye abide in me, and my words .
	. . in you</b>—Mark the change from the inhabitation of <i>Himself</i>
	to that of His <i>words,</i> paving the way for the subsequent
	exhortations (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:9">John 15:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:10">John 15:10</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>ask what ye will, and it
	shall be done unto you</b>—because this indwelling of His words in
	them would secure the harmony of their askings with the divine will.</p>
