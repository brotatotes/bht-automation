11. Of judgment, because the prince
	of this world is judged—By supposing that the final judgment
	is here meant, the point of this clause is, even by good
	interpreters, quite missed. The statement, "The prince of this
	world is judged," means, beyond all reasonable doubt, the
	same as that in John 12:31,
	"Now shall the prince of this world be cast out";
	and both mean that his dominion over men, or his power to enslave and
	so to ruin them, is destroyed. The death of Christ "judged"
	or judicially overthrew him, and he was thereupon "cast out"
	or expelled from his usurped dominion (Hebrews 2:14;
	1 John 3:8; Colossians 2:15).
	Thus, then, the Spirit shall bring home to men's conscience: (1) the
	sense of sin, consummated in the rejection of Him who came to
	"take away the sin of the world"; (2) the sense of perfect
	relief in the righteousness of the Father's Servant, now
	fetched from the earth that spurned Him to that bosom where from
	everlasting He had dwelt; and (3) the sense of emancipation from the
	fetters of Satan, whose judgment brings to men liberty to be
	holy, and transformation out of servants of the devil into sons and
	daughters of the Lord Almighty. To one class of men, however, all
	this will carry conviction only; they "will not come to
	Christ"—revealed though He be to them as the life-giving
	One—that they may have life. Such, abiding voluntarily under the
	dominion of the prince of this world, are judged in his judgment,
	the visible consummation of which will be at the great day. To
	another class, however, this blessed teaching will have another
	issue—translating them out of the kingdom of darkness into the
	kingdom of God's dear Son.
