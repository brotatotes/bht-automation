12-15. when he, the Spirit of truth,
	is come . . . he shall not speak of himself—that is, from
	Himself, but, like Christ Himself, "what He hears," what is
	given Him to communicate. 
	he will show you things to
	come—referring specially to those revelations which, in the
	Epistles partially, but most fully in the Apocalypse, open up a vista
	into the Future of the Kingdom of God, whose horizon is the
	everlasting hills.
