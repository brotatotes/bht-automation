14. He shall glorify me; for he
	shall receive of mine and show it unto you—Thus the whole
	design of the Spirit's office is to glorify Christ—not in His own
	Person, for this was done by the Father when He exalted Him to His
	own right hand—but in the view and estimation of men. For this
	purpose He was to "receive of Christ"—all the
	truth relating to Christ—"and show it unto them,"
	or make them to discern it in its own light. The subjective
	nature of the Spirit's teaching—the discovery to the souls of men
	of what is Christ outwardly—is here very clearly expressed;
	and, at the same time, the vanity of looking for revelations of the
	Spirit which shall do anything beyond throwing light in the soul upon
	what Christ Himself is, and taught, and did upon earth.
