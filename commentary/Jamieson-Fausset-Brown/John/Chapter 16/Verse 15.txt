<p><b>15. All things that the Father hath
	are mine</b>â€”a plainer expression than this of <i>absolute
	community</i> with the Father in all things cannot be conceived,
	though the "all things" here have reference to the things
	of the Kingdom of Grace, which the Spirit was to receive that He
	might show it to us. We have here a wonderful glimpse into the <i>inner
	relations of the Godhead.</i></p>
