16-22. A little while, and ye shall
	not see me; and again a little while, and ye shall see me, because I
	go to the Fatherâ€”The joy of the world at their not seeing Him
	seems to show that His removal from them by death was what He
	meant; and in that case, their joy at again seeing Him points to
	their transport at His reappearance amongst them on His Resurrection,
	when they could no longer doubt His identity. At the same time the
	sorrow of the widowed Church in the absence of her Lord in the
	heavens, and her transport at His personal return, are certainly here
	expressed.
