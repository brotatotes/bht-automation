2. They shall put you out of the
	synagogue— (John 9:22;
	John 12:42). 
	the time cometh, that
	whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service—The
	words mean religious service—"that he is offering a
	service to God." (So Saul of Tarsus, Galatians 1:13;
	Galatians 1:14; Philippians 3:6).
