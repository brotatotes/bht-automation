<p><b>28. I came forth from the Father,</b>
	&amp;c.â€”that is, "And ye are right, for I have indeed so come
	forth,and shall soon return whence I came." This echo of the
	truth, alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:27">John 16:27</span>,
	seems like <i>thinking aloud,</i> as if it were grateful to His own
	spirit on such a subject and at such an hour.</p>
