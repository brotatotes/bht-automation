<p><b>29, 30. His disciples said, . . .
	now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb</b>â€”hardly more
	so than before; the time for perfect plainness was yet to come; but
	having caught a glimpse of His meaning (it was nothing more), they
	eagerly express their satisfaction, as if glad to make anything of
	His words. How touchingly does this show both the simplicity of their
	hearts and the infantile character of their faith!</p>
