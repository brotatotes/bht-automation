<p><b>31-33. Jesus answered . . . Do ye
	now believe?</b>—that is, "It is well ye do, for it is soon to
	be tested, and in a way ye little expect." 
	</p>
<p><b>the hour cometh, yea, is now
	come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall
	leave me alone; and yet I am not alone</b>—A deep and awful sense
	of <i>wrong</i> experienced is certainly expressed here, but how
	lovingly! That He was not to be utterly deserted, that there was One
	who would not forsake Him, was to Him matter of ineffable support and
	consolation; but that He should be without all <i>human</i>
	countenance and cheer, who as Man was exquisitely sensitive to the
	law of sympathy, would fill themselves with as much <i>shame,</i>
	when they afterwards recurred to it, as the Redeemer's heart in His
	hour of need with pungent <i>sorrow.</i> "I looked for some to
	take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+69:20">Psalms 69:20</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>because the Father is with
	me</b>—how near, and with what sustaining power, who can express?</p>
