<p><b>8. And when he is come, he will,</b>
	c.—This is one of the passages most pregnant with thought in the
	profound discourses of Christ with a few great strokes depicting all
	and every part of the ministry of the Holy Ghost in the world—His
	operation with reference to individuals as well as the mass, on
	believers and unbelievers alike [OLSHAUSEN].
	</p>
<p><b>he will reprove</b>—This is
	too weak a word to express what is meant. <i>Reproof</i> is indeed
	implied in the term employed, and doubtless the word begins with it.
	But <i>convict</i> or <i>convince</i> is the thing intended; and as
	the one expresses the work of the Spirit on the <i>unbelieving</i>
	portion of mankind, and the other on the <i>believing,</i> it is
	better not to restrict it to either.</p>
