<p><b>9. Of sin, because they believe not
	on me</b>â€”As all sin has its root in unbelief, so the most
	aggravated form of unbelief is the rejection of Christ. The Spirit,
	however, in fastening this truth upon the conscience, does not
	<i>extinguish,</i> but, on the contrary, does <i>consummate and
	intensify, the sense of all other sins.</i></p>
