9. Of sin, because they believe not
	on meâ€”As all sin has its root in unbelief, so the most
	aggravated form of unbelief is the rejection of Christ. The Spirit,
	however, in fastening this truth upon the conscience, does not
	extinguish, but, on the contrary, does consummate and
	intensify, the sense of all other sins.
