<p><b>11. I am no more in the world</b>—(See

<p><b>but these are in the
	world</b>—that is, Though My struggles are at an end, theirs are
	not; though I have gotten beyond the scene of strife, I cannot sever
	Myself in spirit from them, left behind and only just entering on
	their great conflict. 
	</p>
<p><b>Holy Father</b>—an
	expression He nowhere else uses. "<i>Father</i>" is His
	wonted appellation, but "<i>Holy</i>" is here prefixed,
	because His appeal was to that perfection of the Father's nature, to
	"keep" or preserve them from being tainted by the unholy
	atmosphere of "the world" they were still in. 
	</p>
<p><b>keep through thine own
	name</b>—rather, "in thy name"; in the exercise of that
	gracious and holy character for which He was known.
