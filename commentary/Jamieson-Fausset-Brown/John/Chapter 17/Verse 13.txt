<p><b>13. I speak in the world, that they
	might have my joy fulfilled in themselves</b>â€”that is, Such a

	I experience in knowing that such intercessions are to be made for
	them by their absent Lord, may be tasted by those who now hear them,
	and by all who shall hereafter read the record of them,</p>
