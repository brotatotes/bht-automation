<p><b>9-14. I pray for them</b>—not as
	individuals merely, but as representatives of all such in every
	succeeding age (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>not for the world</b>—for
	they had been given Him "<i>out of</i> the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1- :">John 17:1- :</span>), and had been already transformed into the very <i>opposite</i>
	of it. The things sought for them, indeed, are applicable only to
	such.</p>
