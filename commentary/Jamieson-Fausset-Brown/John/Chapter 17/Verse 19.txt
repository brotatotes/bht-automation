	The only difference between the application of the same term to
	Christ and the disciples is, as applied to Christ, that it means <i>only</i>
	to "consecrate"; whereas, in application to the disciples,
	it means to consecrate with the <i>additional idea</i> of previous
	sanctification, since nothing but what is holy can be presented as an
	offering. The whole self-sacrificing work of the disciples appears
	here as a mere <i>result</i> of the offering of Christ [OLSHAUSEN].
