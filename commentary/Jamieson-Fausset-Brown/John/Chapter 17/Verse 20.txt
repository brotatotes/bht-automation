<p><b>20-23. Neither pray I for these
	alone</b>—This very important explanation, uttered in condescension
	to the hearers and readers of this prayer in all time, is meant not
	merely of what follows, but of the whole prayer. 
	</p>
<p><b>them also which shall
	believe</b>—The majority of the best manuscripts read "which
	believe," all future time being viewed as <i>present,</i> while
	the present is viewed as past and gone.</p>
