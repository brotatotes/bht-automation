<p><b>22. And the glory which thou
	gavest</b>—hast given. 
	</p>
<p><b>me I have given them, that
	they may be one, even as we are one</b>—The last clause shows the
	meaning of the first. It is not the <i>future</i> glory of the
	heavenly state, but the secret of that <i>present</i> unity just
	before spoken of; <i>the glory,</i> therefore, <i>of the indwelling
	Spirit of Christ;</i> the glory of an accepted state, of a holy
	character, of every grace.</p>
