<p><b>24-26. Father, I will</b>—The
	majesty of this style of speaking is quite transparent. No petty
	criticism will be allowed to fritter it away in any but superficial
	or perverted readers.

<p><b>be with me where I am</b>—(See
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1">John 17:1</span>).

<p><b>that they may behold my glory
	which thou hast given me</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1- :">John 17:1- :</span>). Christ regards it as glory enough for us to be admitted to
	see and gaze for ever upon <i>His</i> glory! This is "the
	beatific vision"; but it shall be no mere vision, for "we
	shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:1- :">John 17:1- :</span>).</p>
