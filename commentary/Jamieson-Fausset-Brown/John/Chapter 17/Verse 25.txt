	"<i>Holy</i> Father," when desiring the display of that
	perfection on His disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), so here He styles Him "<i>Righteous</i> Father,"
	because He is appealing to His righteousness or justice, to make a
	distinction between those two diametrically opposite classes—"<i>the
	world,</i>" on the one hand, which would not "know the
	Father, though brought so nigh to it in the Son of His love, and, on
	the other, <i>Himself,</i> who recognized and owned Him, <i>and even
	His disciples,</i> who owned His mission from the Father.</p>
