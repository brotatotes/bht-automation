<p><b>thy name</b>—in His past

<p><b>and will declare it</b>—in

<p><b>that the love wherewith thou

<p><b>me may be in them, and I in

	is by His Spirit imparted to and takes up its permanent abode in all
	that believe in Him; and "He abiding in them and they in Him"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:5">John 15:5</span>), they are "<i>one
	Spirit.</i>" "With this lofty thought the Redeemer closes
	His prayer for His disciples, and in them for His Church through all
	ages. He has compressed into the last moments given Him for
	conversation with His own the most sublime and glorious sentiments
	ever uttered by mortal lips. But hardly has the sound of the last
	word died away, when He passes with the disciples over the brook
	Kedron to Gethsemane—and the bitter conflict draws on. The seed of
	the new world must be sown in Death, that thence Life may spring up"
