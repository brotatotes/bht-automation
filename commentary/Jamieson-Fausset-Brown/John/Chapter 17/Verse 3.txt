<p><b>and Jesus Christ whom thou

	this compound name, afterwards so current in apostolic preaching and
	writing. Here the terms are used in their strict
	signification—"JESUS,"
	because He "<i>saves</i> His people from their sins";
	"CHRIST," as
	<i>anointed</i> with the measureless fulness of the Holy Ghost for
	the exercise of His saving offices (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); "WHOM THOU
	HAST SENT," in the plenitude of Divine Authority and
	Power, to save. "The very juxtaposition here of <i>Jesus Christ</i>
	with <i>the Father</i> is a proof, by implication, of our Lord's
	Godhead. The knowledge of <i>God and a creature</i> could not be
	eternal life, and such an association of the one with the other would
	be inconceivable" [ALFORD].</p>
