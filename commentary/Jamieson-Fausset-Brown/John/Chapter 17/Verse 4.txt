<p><b>4, 5. I have glorified thee on the
	earth</b>—rather, "I glorified" (for the thing is
	conceived as now <i>past</i>). 
	</p>
<p><b>I have finished</b>—I
	finished. 
	</p>
<p><b>the work which thou gavest me
	to do</b>—It is very important to preserve in the translation the
	<i>past</i> tense, used in the original, otherwise it might be
	thought that the work already "<i>finished</i>" was only
	what He had done <i>before uttering that prayer;</i> whereas it will
	be observed that our Lord speaks throughout as already beyond this
	present scene (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span>,
	&amp;c.), and so must be supposed to include in His "finished
	work" the "decease which He was to accomplish at
	Jerusalem."</p>
