<p><b>5. And now</b>—in return. 
	</p>
<p><b>glorify thou me</b>—The "<i>I
	Thee</i>" and "<i>Thou Me</i>" are so placed in the
	original, each beside its fellow, as to show that A
	PERFECT RECIPROCITY OF SERVICES of the Son to the Father
	first, and then of the Father to the Son in return, is what our Lord
	means here to express. 
	</p>
<p><b>with the glory which I had
	with thee before the world was</b>—when "in the beginning the
	Word was <i>with God</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "the only-begotten Son <i>in the bosom of the Father</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>). With this
	pre-existent glory, which He veiled on earth, He asks to be
	reinvested, the design of the veiling being accomplished—not,
	however, simply as before, but <i>now in our nature.</i></p>
