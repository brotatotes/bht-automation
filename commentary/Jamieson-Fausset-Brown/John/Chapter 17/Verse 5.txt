	glorify thou me—The "I
	Thee" and "Thou Me" are so placed in the
	original, each beside its fellow, as to show that A
	PERFECT RECIPROCITY OF SERVICES of the Son to the Father
	first, and then of the Father to the Son in return, is what our Lord
	means here to express. 
	with the glory which I had
	with thee before the world was—when "in the beginning the
	Word was with God" ( :-), "the only-begotten Son in the bosom of the Father"
	(John 1:18). With this
	pre-existent glory, which He veiled on earth, He asks to be
	reinvested, the design of the veiling being accomplished—not,
	however, simply as before, but now in our nature.
