<p><b>10, 11. Then Simon Peter, having a
	sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his
	right ear. The servant's name was Malchus</b>â€”None of the other
	Evangelists mention the name either of the ardent disciple or of his
	victim. John being "known to the high priest" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), the mention of the servant's name by <i>him</i> is quite
	natural, and an interesting mark of truth in a small matter. As to
	the <i>right</i> ear, specified both here and in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), the man was "likely foremost of those who advanced
	to seize Jesus, and presented himself in the attitude of a combatant;
	hence his right side would be exposed to attack. The blow of Peter
	was evidently aimed vertically at his head" [WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON].</p>
