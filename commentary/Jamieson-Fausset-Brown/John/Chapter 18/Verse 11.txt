<p><b>11. Then said Jesus</b>—"Suffer
	ye thus far" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:51">Luke 22:51</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Put up thy sword into the
	sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink
	it?</b>—This expresses <i>both the feelings</i> which struggled in
	the Lord's breast during the Agony in the garden—<i>aversion to the
	cup</i> viewed <i>in itself,</i> but, <i>in the light of the Father's
	will,</i> perfect <i>preparedness to drink it.</i> (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:51- :">Luke 22:51- :</span>). Matthew adds to the address to Peter the
	following:—"For all they that take the sword shall perish by
	the sword" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:52">Matthew 26:52</span>)
	—that is, 'Those who take the sword must run all the risks of human
	warfare; but Mine is a warfare whose weapons, as they are not carnal,
	are attended with no such hazards, but carry certain victory.'
	"Thinkest thou that I cannot now"—even after things have
	proceeded so far—"pray to My Father, and He shall presently
	give Me"—rather, "place at My disposal"—"more
	than twelve legions of angels"; with allusion, possibly, to the
	one angel who had, in His agony, "appeared to Him from heaven
	strengthening Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:52- :">Matthew 26:52- :</span>); and in the precise number, alluding to the <i>twelve</i>
	who needed the help, Himself and His eleven disciples. (The full
	complement of a legion of Roman soldiers was six thousand). "But
	how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that thus it must be?"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:53">Matthew 26:53</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:54">Matthew 26:54</span>).
	He could not suffer, according to the Scripture, if He allowed
	Himself to be delivered from the predicted death. "And He
	touched his ear and healed him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:54- :">Matthew 26:54- :</span>); for "the Son of man came not to destroy men's lives,
	but to save them" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:56">Luke 9:56</span>),
	and, even while they were destroying His, to save theirs.</p>
