<p><b>17. Then saith the damsel that kept
	the door</b>—"one of the maids of the high priest," says
	Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66">Mark 14:66</span>). "When
	she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him and said" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66- :">Mark 14:66- :</span>). Luke is more graphic (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66- :">Mark 14:66- :</span>) —She "beheld him as he sat by the fire (literally,
	'the light'), and earnestly looked on him (fixed her gaze upon him),
	and said." "His demeanor and timidity, which must have
	vividly showed themselves, as it so generally happens, leading to the
	recognition of him" [OLSHAUSEN].
	</p>
<p><b>Art thou not also one of this
	man's disciples?</b>—that is, thou as well as "that other
	disciple," whom she knew to be one, but did not challenge,
	perceiving that he was a privileged person. 
	</p>
<p><b>He saith, I am not</b>—"He
	denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66- :">Mark 14:66- :</span>) —a common form of point blank denial; "I know
	[supply 'Him'] not, neither understand I what thou sayest" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66- :">Mark 14:66- :</span>); "Woman, I know Him not" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66- :">Mark 14:66- :</span>). This was THE FIRST
	DENIAL. "And he went out into the porch [thinking,
	perhaps, to steal away], <i>and the cock crew,</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:66- :">Mark 14:66- :</span>).</p>
