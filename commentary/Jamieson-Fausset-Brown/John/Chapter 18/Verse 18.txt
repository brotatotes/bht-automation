18. And the servants and
	officers—the menials and some of the "band" that
	"took Jesus." (Also see on  :-.) 
	stood there, who had
	made—"having made." 
	a fire of coals, for it was
	cold, and they warmed themselves—"John alone notices the
	material (charcoal) of which the fire was made, and the reason for a
	fire—the coldness of the night" [WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON]. "Peter
	went in and sat with the servants to see the end ( :-), and warmed himself at the fire" ( :-). These two statements are extremely interesting. His
	wishing to "see the end," of issue of these proceedings,
	was what led him into the palace, for he evidently feared the worst.
	But once in, the serpent coil is drawn closer; it is a cold night,
	and why should not he take advantage of the fire as well as others?
	Besides, in the talk of the crowd about the all-engrossing topic, he
	may pick up something which he would like to hear. "And as Peter
	was beneath in the palace" ( :-). Matthew (Matthew 26:69)
	says, "sat without in the palace." According to
	Oriental architecture, and especially in large buildings, as here,
	the street door—or heavy folding gate through which single persons
	entered by a wicket kept by a porter—opened by a passage or "porch"
	(Mark 14:68) into a quadrangular
	court, here called the "palace" or hall,
	which was open above, and is frequently paved with
	flagstones. In the center of this court the "fire" would be
	kindled (in a brazier). At the upper end of it, probably, was the
	chamber in which the trial was held, open to the court and not far
	from the fire (Luke 22:61),
	but on a higher level; for Mark (Luke 22:61- :) says the court was "beneath" it. The
	ascent was, perhaps, by a short flight of steps. This explanation
	will make the intensely interesting details more intelligible.
