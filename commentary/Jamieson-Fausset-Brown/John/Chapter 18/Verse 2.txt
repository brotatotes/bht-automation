<p><b>2. Judas . . . knew the place, for

<p><b>resorted thither with his
	disciples</b>—The baseness of this abuse of knowledge in Judas,
	derived from admission to the closest privacies of his Master, is
	most touchingly conveyed here, though nothing beyond bare narrative
	is expressed. Jesus, however, knowing that in this spot Judas would
	expect to find Him, instead of avoiding it, hies Him thither, as a
	Lamb to the slaughter. "No man taketh My life from Me, but I lay
	it down of Myself" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:37- :">Luke 21:37- :</span>). Besides, the scene which was to fill up the little
	breathing-time, the awful interval, between the Supper and the
	Apprehension—like the "silence in heaven for about the space
	of half an hour" between the breaking of the Apocalyptic Seals
	and the peal of the Trumpets of war (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:37- :">Luke 21:37- :</span>) —the AGONY—would
	have been too terrible for the upper room; nor would He cloud the
	delightful associations of the <i>last Passover</i> and the <i>first
	Supper</i> by pouring out the anguish of His soul there. The garden,
	however, with its amplitude, its shady olives, its endeared
	associations, would be congenial to His heart. Here He had room
	enough to retire—first, from eight of them, and then from the more
	favored three; and here, when that mysterious scene was over, the
	stillness would only be broken by the tread of the traitor.</p>
