<p><b>23. If I have spoken,</b> &amp;c.—"if
	I spoke" evil, in reply to the high priest. (Also see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.)

<p><b>if well</b>—He does not say
	"If <i>not</i>" evil, as if His reply were merely
	unobjectionable: "<i>well</i>" seems to challenge more than
	this as due to His remonstrance This shows that <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> is not to be taken to the letter.</p>
