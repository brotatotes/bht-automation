<p><b>24-27. Now Annas had sent him bound
	unto Caiaphas</b>—Our translators so render the words,
	understanding that the foregoing interview took place before
	<i>Caiaphas;</i> Annas, declining to meddle with the case, having
	sent Him to Caiaphas <i>at once.</i> But the words here literally
	are, "Annas sent Him [not '<i>had</i> sent Him'] to
	Caiaphas"—and the "now" being of doubtful authority.
	Thus read, the verse affords no evidence that He was sent to Caiaphas
	<i>before</i> the interview just recorded, but implies rather the
	contrary. We take this interview, then, with some of the ablest
	interpreters, to be a preliminary and non-official one with <i>Annas,</i>
	at an hour of the night when Caiaphas' Council could not convene; and
	one that ought not to be confounded with that solemn one recorded by
	the other Evangelists, when all were assembled and witnesses called.
	But <i>the building in which both met with Jesus appears to have been
	the same, the room only being different, and the court, of course, in
	that case, one.</i> (Also see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.)</p>
