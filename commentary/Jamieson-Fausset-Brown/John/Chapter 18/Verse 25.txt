25. And Simon Peter was standing and
	warming himself. They said therefore . . . Art thou not also one of
	his disciples?—In Matthew 26:71
	the second charge was made by "another maid, when he was
	gone out into the porch," who "saw him, and said unto them
	that were there, This [fellow] was also with Jesus of Nazareth."
	So also Mark 14:69. But in Mark 14:69- : it is said, "After a little while" (from the time
	of the first denial), "another [man] saw him, and said,
	Thou art also of them." Possibly it was thrown at him by more
	than one; but these circumstantial variations only confirm the truth
	of the narrative. 
	He denied it, and said, I am
	not—in Matthew 26:72, "He
	denied with an oath, I do not know the man." This was THE
	SECOND DENIAL.
