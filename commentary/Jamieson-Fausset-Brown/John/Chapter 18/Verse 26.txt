<p><b>26. One of the servants of the high
	priest, being his kinsman, whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I
	see thee in the garden with him</b>â€”No doubt his relationship to
	Malchus drew attention to the man who smote him, and this enabled him
	to identify Peter. "Sad reprisals!" [BENGEL].
	The other Evangelists make his detection to turn upon his <i>dialect.</i>
	"After a while ['about the space of one hour after' (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>)] came unto him they that stood by and said to Peter,
	Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech betrayeth thee"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</span>). "Thou art a
	Galilean, and thy speech agreeth thereto" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73- :">Matthew 26:73- :</span>; and so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:59">Luke 22:59</span>).
	The Galilean dialect had a more <i>Syrian</i> cast than that of
	Judea. <i>If Peter had held his peace,</i> this peculiarity had not
	been observed; but hoping, probably, to put them off the scent by
	joining in the <i>fireside talk,</i> he only thus revealed himself.</p>
