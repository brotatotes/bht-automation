26. One of the servants of the high
	priest, being his kinsman, whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I
	see thee in the garden with himâ€”No doubt his relationship to
	Malchus drew attention to the man who smote him, and this enabled him
	to identify Peter. "Sad reprisals!" [BENGEL].
	The other Evangelists make his detection to turn upon his dialect.
	"After a while ['about the space of one hour after' ( :-)] came unto him they that stood by and said to Peter,
	Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech betrayeth thee"
	(Matthew 26:73). "Thou art a
	Galilean, and thy speech agreeth thereto" (Matthew 26:73- :; and so Luke 22:59).
	The Galilean dialect had a more Syrian cast than that of
	Judea. If Peter had held his peace, this peculiarity had not
	been observed; but hoping, probably, to put them off the scent by
	joining in the fireside talk, he only thus revealed himself.
