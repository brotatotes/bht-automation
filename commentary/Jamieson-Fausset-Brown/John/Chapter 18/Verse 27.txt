<p><b>27. Peter then denied again</b>—But,
	if the challenge of Malchus' kinsman was made simultaneously with
	this on account of his Galilean dialect, it was no simple denial; for
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:74">Matthew 26:74</span> says, "Then
	began he to <i>curse and to swear,</i> saying, I know not the man."
	So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:71">Mark 14:71</span>. This was THE
	THIRD DENIAL. 
	</p>
<p><b>and immediately</b>—"while
	he yet spake" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:60">Luke 22:60</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>the cock crew</b>—As Mark
	is the only Evangelist who tells us that our Lord predicted that the
	cock should crow <i>twice</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:60- :">Luke 22:60- :</span>), so he only mentions that it <i>did</i> crow twice (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:60- :">Luke 22:60- :</span>). The other Evangelists, who tell us merely that our Lord
	predicted that "before the cock should crow he would deny Him
	thrice" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:34">Matthew 26:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:34">Luke 22:34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:38">John 13:38</span>), mention only <i>one
	actual</i> crowing, which was Mark's last. This is something
	affecting in this Evangelist—who, according to the earliest
	tradition (confirmed by internal evidence), derived his materials so
	largely from Peter as to have been styled his "<i>interpreter,</i>"
	being the <i>only one</i> who gives both the sad prediction and its
	still sadder fulfilment <i>in full.</i> It seems to show that Peter
	himself not only retained through all his after-life the most vivid
	recollection of the circumstances of his fall, but that he was
	willing that others should know them too. The immediately <i>subsequent</i>
	acts are given in full only in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:61">Luke 22:61</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:62">Luke 22:62</span>): "And the Lord
	turned and looked upon Peter," from the hall of judgment to the
	court, in the way already explained. But who can tell what lightning
	flashes of wounded love and piercing reproach shot from that "look"
	through the eye of Peter into his heart! "And Peter remembered
	the word of the Lord, how He had said unto him, Before the cock crow,
	thou shalt deny Me thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly."
	How different from the sequel of Judas' act! Doubtless the hearts of
	the two men towards the Saviour were perfectly different from the
	first; and the treason of Judas was but the consummation of the
	wretched man's resistance of the blaze of light in the midst of which
	he had lived for three years, while Peter's denial was but a
	momentary obscuration of the heavenly light and love to his Master
	which ruled his life. But the immediate cause of the revulsion, which
	made Peter "weep bitterly," was, beyond all doubt, this
	heart-piercing "look" which his Lord gave him. And
	remembering the Saviour's own words at the table, "Simon, Simon,
	Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat, <i>but
	I have prayed</i> [rather, 'I prayed'] <i>for thee that thy faith
	fail not</i>" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:62- :">Luke 22:62- :</span>), may we not say that <i>this prayer fetched down all that
	there was in that 'look'</i> to pierce and break the heart of. Peter,
	to keep it from despair, to work in it "repentance unto
	salvation not to be repented of," and at length, under other
	healing touches, to "restore his soul?" (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:62- :">Luke 22:62- :</span>).
