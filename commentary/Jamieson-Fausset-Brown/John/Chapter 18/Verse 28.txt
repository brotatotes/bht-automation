28. Then led they Jesus from
	Caiaphas to the hall of judgment—but not till "in the
	morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and
	scribes and the whole council against Him to put Him to death, and
	bound Him" (Matthew 27:1; and
	see on Matthew 27:1- :). The word here
	rendered "hall of judgment" is from the Latin, and
	denotes "the palace of the governor of a Roman province." 
	they themselves went not into
	the judgment hall lest they should be defiled—by contact with
	ceremonially unclean Gentiles. 
	but that they might eat the
	passover—If this refer to the principal part of the festival,
	the eating of the lamb, the question is, how our Lord and His
	disciples came to eat it the night before; and, as it was an evening
	meal, how ceremonial defilement contracted in the morning
	would unfit them for partaking of it, as after six o'clock it was
	reckoned a new day. These are questions which have occasioned immense
	research and learned treatises. But as the usages of the Jews appear
	to have somewhat varied at different times, and our present knowledge
	of them is not sufficient to clear up all difficulties, they are
	among the not very important questions which probably will never be
	entirely solved.
