<p><b>3. Judas then</b>—"He that
	was called Judas, one of the Twelve," says Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), in language which brands him with peculiar infamy, as <i>in</i>
	the sacred circle while in no sense <i>of</i> it. 
	</p>
<p><b>a band of men</b>—"the
	<i>detachment</i> of the Roman cohort on duty at the festival for the
	purpose of maintaining order" [WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON]. 
	</p>
<p><b>officers from the chief
	priests and Pharisees</b>—captains of the temple and armed Levites.
	</p>
<p><b>lanterns and torches</b>—It
	was full moon, but in case He should have secreted Himself somewhere
	in the dark ravine, they bring the means of exploring its
	hiding-places—little knowing whom they had to do with. "Now he
	that betrayed Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall
	kiss, that same is He, hold Him fast" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The cold-bloodedness of this speech was only exceeded by
	the deed itself. "And Judas went before them [<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>], and forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Master,
	and kissed Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:49">Matthew 26:49</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+4:27">Exodus 4:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+18:7">Exodus 18:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:45">Luke 7:45</span>). The impudence of this
	atrocious deed shows how thoroughly he had by this time mastered all
	his scruples. If the dialogue between our Lord and His captors was
	<i>before</i> this, as some interpreters think it was, the kiss of
	Judas was purely gratuitous, and probably to make good his right to
	the money; our Lord having presented Himself unexpectedly before
	them, and rendered it unnecessary for any one to point Him out. But a
	comparison of the narratives seems to show that our Lord's "coming
	forth" to the band was <i>subsequent</i> to the interview of
	Judas. "And Jesus said unto him, Friend"—not the
	endearing term "friend" (in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:45- :">Luke 7:45- :</span>), but "companion," a word used on occasions of
	remonstrance or rebuke (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:13">Matthew 20:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:12">Matthew 22:12</span>) —"Wherefore art
	thou come?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:50">Matthew 26:50</span>).
	"Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss"—imprinting
	upon the foulest act the mark of tenderest affection? What <i>wounded
	feeling</i> does this express! Of this Jesus showed Himself on
	various occasions keenly susceptible—as all generous and beautiful
	natures do.</p>
