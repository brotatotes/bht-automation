	and said . . . Art thou the King of the Jews?</b>—In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> they charge our Lord before Pilate with "perverting the
	nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that He
	Himself is Christ a king." Perhaps this was what occasioned
