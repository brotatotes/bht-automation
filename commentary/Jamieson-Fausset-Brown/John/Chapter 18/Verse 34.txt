<p><b>34. Jesus answered . . . Sayest thou
	this of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</b>â€”an important
	question for our Lord's case, to bring out whether the word "<i>King</i>"
	were meant in a <i>political</i> sense, with which Pilate had a right
	to deal, or whether he were merely <i>put up</i> to it by His
	accusers, who had no claims to charge Him but such as were of a
	purely <i>religious</i> nature, with which Pilate had nothing to do.</p>
