<p><b>37. Art thou a king then?</b>—There
	was no sarcasm or disdain in this question (as THOLUCK,
	ALFORD, and others,
	allege), else our Lord's answer would have been different. Putting
	emphasis upon "<i>thou,</i>" his question betrays a mixture
	of <i>surprise</i> and <i>uneasiness,</i> partly at the possibility
	of there being, after all, something dangerous under the claim, and
	partly from a certain awe which our Lord's demeanor probably struck
	into him. 
	</p>
<p><b>Thou sayest that I am a
	king</b>—It is even so. 
	</p>
<p><b>To this end was I</b>—"have
	I been." 
	</p>
<p><b>born and for this cause came
	I</b>—am I come. 
	</p>
<p><b>into the world, that I may
	bear witness to the truth</b>—His <i>birth</i> expresses His
	manhood; His <i>coming into the world,</i> His existence before
	assuming humanity: The truth, then, here affirmed, though Pilate
	would catch little of it, was that <i>His Incarnation was expressly
	in order to the assumption of Royalty in our nature.</i> Yet, instead
	of saying, He came to be a King, which is His meaning, He says He
	came to <i>testify to the truth.</i> Why this? Because, in such
	circumstances it required a noble courage not to flinch from His
	royal claims; and our Lord, <i>conscious that He was putting forth
	that courage,</i> gives a turn to His confession expressive of it. It
	is to this that Paul alludes, in those remarkable words to Timothy:
	"I charge thee before God, who quickeneth all things, and before
	Christ Jesus, who, <i>in the presence</i> of Pontius Pilate,
	witnessed <i>the good confession</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). This one act of our Lord's life, His courageous
	witness-bearing before the governor, was selected as an encouraging
	example of the <i>fidelity</i> which Timothy ought to display. As the
	Lord (says OLSHAUSEN
	beautifully) owned Himself <i>the Son of God</i> before the most
	exalted theocratic council, so He confessed His <i>regal dignity</i>
	in presence of the representative of the highest political authority
	on earth. 
	</p>
<p><b>Every one that is of the
	truth heareth my voice</b>—Our Lord here not only affirms that His
	word had in it a self-evidencing, self-recommending power, but gently
	insinuated the <i>true secret of the growth and grandeur of His
	kingdom</i>—as A KINGDOM
	OF TRUTH, in its highest sense, into which all souls who have
	learned to live and count all things but loss for the truth are, by a
	most heavenly attraction, drawn as into their proper element; THE
	KING of whom Jesus is,
	fetching them in and ruling them by His captivating power over their
	hearts.</p>
