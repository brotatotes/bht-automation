4-9. Jesus . . . knowing all things
	that should come—were coming. 
	upon him, went forth—from
	the shade of the trees, probably, into open view, indicating His
	sublime preparedness to meet His captors. 
	Whom seek ye?—partly to
	prevent a rush of the soldiery upon the disciples [BENGEL];
	and see Mark 14:51; Mark 14:52,
	as showing a tendency to this: but still more as part of that courage
	and majesty which so overawed them. He would not wait to be taken.
