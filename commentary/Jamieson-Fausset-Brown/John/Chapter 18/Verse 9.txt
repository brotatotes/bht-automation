<p><b>9. That the saying might be
	fulfilled which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost
	none</b>â€”The reference is to such sayings as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:12">John 17:12</span>; showing how conscious
	the Evangelist was, that in reporting his Lord's former sayings, he
	was giving them not in <i>substance</i> merely, but in <i>form</i>
	also. Observe, also, how the preservation of the disciples on this
	occasion is viewed as part that <i>deeper preservation</i>
	undoubtedly intended in the saying quoted.</p>
