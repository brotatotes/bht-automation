19-22. Pilate wrote a title, and put
	it on the cross . . . Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews . . .
	and it was written in Hebrew—or Syro-Chaldaic, the
	language of the country. 
	and Greek—the current
	language. 
	and Latin—the official
	language. These were the chief languages of the earth, and this
	secured that all spectators should be able to read it. Stung by this,
	the Jewish ecclesiastics entreat that it may be so altered as to
	express, not His real dignity, but His false claim to it. But Pilate
	thought he had yielded quite enough to them; and having intended
	expressly to spite and insult them by this title, for having got him
	to act against his own sense of justice, he peremptorily refused
	them. And thus, amidst the conflicting passions of men, was
	proclaimed, in the chief tongues of mankind, from the Cross itself
	and in circumstances which threw upon it a lurid yet grand light, the
	truth which drew the Magi to His manger, and will yet be owned by all
	the world!
