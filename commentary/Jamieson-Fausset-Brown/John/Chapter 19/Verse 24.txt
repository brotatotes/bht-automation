<p><b>24. Let us not rend it, but cast
	lots . . . whose it shall be, that the scripture might be fulfilled
	which saith, They parted my raiment among them; and for my vesture
	they did cast lots</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). That a prediction so exceedingly specific—distinguishing
	one piece of dress from others, and announcing that while <i>those</i>
	should be parted amongst several, <i>that</i> should be given by lot
	to one person—that such a prediction should not only be fulfilled
	to the letter, but by a party of heathen military, without
	interference from either the friends of the enemies of the Crucified
	One, is surely worthy to be ranked among the wonders of this
	all-wonderful scene. Now come the <i>mockeries,</i> and from four
	different quarters:—(1) "And <i>they that passed by</i>
	reviled Him, wagging their heads" in ridicule (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+22:7">Psalms 22:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+109:25">Psalms 109:25</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+18:16">Jeremiah 18:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="la+2:15">Lamentations 2:15</span>). "Ah!"—"Ha,"
	an exclamation here of derision. "Thou that destroyest the
	temple, and buildest it in three days, save Thyself and come down
	from the cross" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:39">Matthew 27:39</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:40">Matthew 27:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:29">Mark 15:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:30">Mark 15:30</span>). "It is evident
	that our Lord's saying, or rather this <i>perversion</i> of it (for
	He claimed not to <i>destroy,</i> but to <i>rebuild</i> the temple
	destroyed by them) had greatly exasperated the feeling which the
	priests and Pharisees had contrived to excite against Him. It is
	referred to as the principal fact brought out in evidence against Him
	on the trial (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:13">Acts 6:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:14">Acts 6:14</span>), as an offense for
	which He deserved to suffer. And it is very remarkable that now <i>while
	it was receiving its real fulfilment,</i> it should be made more
	public and more impressive by the insulting proclamation of His
	enemies. Hence the importance attached to it after the resurrection,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:22">John 2:22</span>" [WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON]. (2)
	"Likewise also the <i>chief priests,</i> mocking Him, <i>with
	the scribes and elders,</i> said, He saved others, Himself He cannot
	save" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:41">Matthew 27:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:42">Matthew 27:42</span>).
	There was a deep truth in this, as in other taunts; for <i>both</i>
	He could not do, having "come to give <i>His</i> life a ransom
	for <i>many</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:28">Matthew 20:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:45">Mark 10:45</span>). No doubt this added
	an unknown sting to the reproach. "If He be the king of Israel,
	let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:42">Matthew 27:42</span>). <i>No, they would
	not;</i> for those who resisted the evidence from the resurrection of
	Lazarus, and from His own resurrection, were beyond the reach of any
	amount of merely <i>external</i> evidence. "He trusted in God
	that He would deliver him; let Him deliver Him now if He will have
	Him [or 'delight in Him,' compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:19">Psalms 18:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+21:14">Deuteronomy 21:14</span>]; for He said, I am the
	Son of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+21:14- :">Deuteronomy 21:14- :</span>). We thank you, O ye chief priests, scribes, and elders,
	for this triple testimony, unconsciously borne by you, to our Christ:
	first to <i>His habitual trust in God,</i> as a feature in His
	character so marked and palpable that even ye found upon it your
	impotent taunt; next, <i>to His identity with the Sufferer of the
	twenty-second Psalm,</i> whose very words (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+21:14- :">Deuteronomy 21:14- :</span>) ye unwittingly appropriate, thus <i>serving yourselves
	heirs</i> to the dark office and impotent malignity of Messiah's
	enemies; and again, to the true sense of that august title which He
	took to Himself, "THE
	SON OF GOD,"
	which He rightly interpreted at the very first (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+21:14- :">Deuteronomy 21:14- :</span>) as a claim to that <i>oneness of nature</i> with Him, and
	<i>dearness to Him,</i> which a son has to his father. (3) "And
	<i>the soldiers</i> also mocked Him, coming to Him and offering Him
	vinegar, and saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save Thyself"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:36">Luke 23:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:37">Luke 23:37</span>).
	They insultingly offer to share with Him their own vinegar, or sour
	wine, the usual drink of Roman soldiers, it being about the time of
	their midday meal. In the taunt of the soldiers we have one of those
	<i>undesigned coincidences</i> which so strikingly verify these
	historical records. While the ecclesiastics deride Him for calling
	Himself, "the <i>Christ,</i> the <i>King of Israel,</i> the
	<i>Chosen,</i> the <i>Son of God,</i>" the soldiers, to whom all
	such phraseology was mere Jewish jargon, make sport of Him as a
	pretender to <i>royalty</i> ("KING
	of the Jews"), an office and dignity which it belonged to them
	to comprehend. "<i>The thieves</i> also, which were crucified
	with Him, cast the same in His teeth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:44">Matthew 27:44</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:32">Mark 15:32</span>). Not <i>both</i> of
	them, however, as some commentators unnaturally think we must
	understand these words; as if some sudden change came over the
	<i>penitent</i> one, which turned him from an unfeeling railer into a
	trembling petitioner. The plural "thieves" need not denote
	more than the <i>quarter</i> or <i>class</i> whence came this last
	and cruelest taunt—that is, "Not only did scoffs proceed from
	the <i>passers-by,</i> the <i>ecclesiastics,</i> the <i>soldiery,</i>
	but even from His <i>fellow-sufferers,</i>" a mode of speaking
	which no one would think necessarily meant both of them. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:32- :">Mark 15:32- :</span>, "<i>They</i> are dead which sought the child's life,"
	meaning <i>Herod;</i> and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</span>,
	"There be <i>some</i> standing here," where it is next to
	certain that only John, the youngest and last survivor of the
	apostles, is meant. And is it conceivable that this penitent thief
	should have first himself reviled the Saviour, and then, on his views
	of Christ suddenly changing, he should have turned upon his fellow
	sufferer and fellow reviler, and rebuked him not only with dignified
	sharpness, but in the language of <i>astonishment</i> that he should
	be capable of such conduct? Besides, there is a deep calmness in all
	that he utters, extremely unlike what we should expect from one who
	was the subject of a mental revolution so sudden and total. On the
	scene itself, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1- :">Mark 9:1- :</span>.</p>
