	head and gave up the ghostâ€”What is finished? The Law is
	fulfilled as never before, nor since, in His "obedience unto
	death, even the death of the cross"; Messianic prophecy is
	accomplished; Redemption is completed; "He hath finished the

	anointed a holy of holies"; He has inaugurated the kingdom of
	God and given birth to a new world.
