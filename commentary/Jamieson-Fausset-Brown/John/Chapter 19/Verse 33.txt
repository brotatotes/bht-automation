<p><b>33. But when they came to Jesus, and
	saw that he was dead already</b>—there being in <i>His</i> case
	elements of suffering, unknown to the malefactors, which might
	naturally hasten His death, lingering though it always was in such
	cases, not to speak of His <i>previous</i> sufferings. 
	</p>
<p><b>they brake not his legs</b>—a
	fact of vast importance, as showing that the <i>reality</i> of His
	death was visible to those whose business it was to see to it. The
	<i>other</i> divine purpose served by it will appear presently.</p>
