35. And he that saw it bare
	record—hath borne witness.

	solemn way of referring to his own testimony in this matter has no
	reference to what he says in his Epistle about Christ's "coming

	Scripture in these particulars, and to the undeniable evidence he was
	thus furnishing of the reality of Christ's death, and
	consequently of His resurrection; perhaps also to meet the growing
	tendency, in the Asiatic churches, to deny the reality of our Lord's
	body, or that "Jesus Christ is come in the flesh" ( :-).
