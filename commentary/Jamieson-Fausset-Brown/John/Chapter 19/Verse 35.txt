<p><b>35. And he that saw it bare

<p><b>and his witness is true, and
	he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe</b>—This
	solemn way of referring to his own testimony in this matter has no
	reference to what he says in his Epistle about Christ's "coming
	by water and blood" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), but is intended to call attention both to the fulfilment of
	Scripture in these particulars, and to the undeniable evidence he was
	thus furnishing of the <i>reality</i> of Christ's death, and
	consequently of His resurrection; perhaps also to meet the growing
	tendency, in the Asiatic churches, to deny the reality of our Lord's
	body, or that "Jesus Christ is come in the flesh" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
