<p><b>37. And again another scripture
	saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced</b>â€”The quotation
	is from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:10">Zechariah 12:10</span>; not taken
	as usual from the <i>Septuagint</i> (the current <i>Greek</i>
	version), which here is all wrong, but direct from the <i>Hebrew.</i>
	And there is a remarkable nicety in the choice of the words employed
	both by the prophet and the Evangelist for "piercing." The
	word in Zechariah means to <i>thrust through</i> with spear, javelin,
	sword, or any such weapon. In that sense it is used in all the ten
	places, besides this, where it is found. How suitable this was to
	express the action of the Roman soldier, is manifest; and our
	Evangelist uses the exactly corresponding word, which the <i>Septuagint</i>
	certainly does not. Very <i>different is the other word</i> for
	"<i>pierce</i>" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:10- :">Zechariah 12:10- :</span>, "<i>They pierced my hands and my feet.</i>" The
	word there used is one signifying to <i>bore</i> as with an awl or
	hammer. How striking are these small niceties!</p>
