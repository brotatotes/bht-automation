<p><b>4, 5. Pilate . . . went forth again,
	and saith . . . Behold, I bring him forth to you</b>—am bringing,
	that is, going to bring him forth to you. 
	</p>
<p><b>that ye may know I find no
	fault in him</b>—and, by scourging Him and allowing the soldiers to
	make sport of Him, have gone as far to meet your exasperation as can
	be expected from a judge.</p>
