<p><b>40. Then took they the body of
	Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner
	of the Jews is to bury</b>â€”the mixed and pulverized myrrh and aloes
	shaken into the folds, and the entire body, thus swathed, wrapt in an
	outer covering of "clean linen cloth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Had the Lord's own friends had the least reason to think
	that the spark of life was still in Him, would <i>they</i> have done
	this? But even if one could conceive them mistaken, could anyone have
	lain thus enveloped for the period during which He was in the grave,
	and life still remained? Impossible. When, therefore, He walked forth
	from the tomb, we can say with the most absolute certainty, "Now
	is Christ <i>risen from the dead,</i> and become the first-fruits of
	them that slept" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:20">1 Corinthians 15:20</span>).
	No wonder that the learned and the barbarians alike were prepared to
	die for the name of the Lord Jesus; for such evidence was to the
	unsophisticated resistless. (No mention is made of <i>anointing</i>
	in this operation. No doubt it was a hurried proceeding, for fear of
	interruption, and because it was close on the sabbath, the women seem
	to have set this as their proper task "as soon as the sabbath
	should be past" [<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1">Mark 16:1</span>].
	But as the Lord graciously held it as undesignedly anticipated by
	Mary at Bethany [<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:8">Mark 14:8</span>], so
	this was probably all the anointing, in the strict sense of it, which
	He received.)</p>
