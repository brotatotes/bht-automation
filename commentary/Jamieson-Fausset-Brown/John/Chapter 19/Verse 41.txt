41, 42. Now in the place where he
	was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new
	sepulchre—The choice of this tomb was, on their part,
	dictated by the double circumstance that it was so near at hand, and
	by its belonging to a friend of the Lord; and as there was need of
	haste, even they would be struck with the providence which thus
	supplied it. "There laid they Jesus therefore, because of the
	Jew's preparation day, for the sepulchre was nigh at hand." But
	there was one recommendation of it which probably would not strike
	them; but God had it in view. Not its being "hewn out of a rock"
	(Mark 15:46), accessible only at
	the entrance, which doubtless would impress them with its security
	and suitableness. But it was "a new sepulchre" (Mark 15:46- :), "wherein never man before was laid" (Mark 15:46- :): and Matthew (Matthew 27:60)
	says that Joseph laid Him "in his own new tomb, which he
	had hewn out in the rock"—doubtless for his own use, though
	the Lord had higher use for it. Thus as He rode into Jerusalem on an
	ass "whereon never man before had sat" (Matthew 27:60- :), so now He shall lie in a tomb wherein never man before
	had lain, that from these specimens it may be seen that in all
	things He was "SEPARATE FROM
	SINNERS" (Hebrews 7:26).
