<p><b>5. Then Jesus came forth, wearing
	the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them,
	Behold the man!</b>â€”There is no reason to think that <i>contempt</i>

	this wretched man. Not only was he reluctant to surrender to mere
	clamor an innocent man, but a feeling of anxiety about His mysterious
	claims, as is plain from what follows, was beginning to rack his
	breast, and the object of his exclamation seems to have been to <i>move
	their pity.</i> But, be <i>his</i> meaning what it may, those three
	words have been eagerly appropriated by all Christendom, and
	enshrined for ever in its heart as a sublime expression of its calm,
	rapt admiration of its suffering Lord.</p>
