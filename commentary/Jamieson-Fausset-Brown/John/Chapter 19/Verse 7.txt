	law, and by oar law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son
	of Godâ€”Their criminal charges having come to nothing, they give

	upon them, they retreat into their own Jewish law, by which, as
	claiming equality with God (see John 5:18;
	John 8:59), He ought to die;
	insinuating that it was Pilate's duty, even as civil governor, to
	protect their law from such insult.
