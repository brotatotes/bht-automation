11. manifested forth his
	glory—Nothing in the least like this is said of the miracles of
	prophet or apostle, nor could without manifest blasphemy be said of
	any mere creature. Observe, (1) At a marriage Christ made His first
	public appearance in any company, and at a marriage He wrought His
	first miracle—the noblest sanction that could be given to that
	God-given institution. (2) As the miracle did not make bad good,
	but good better, so Christianity only redeems, sanctifies, and
	ennobles the beneficent but abused institution of marriage; and
	Christ's whole work only turns the water of earth into the wine of
	heaven. Thus "this beginning of miracles" exhibited the
	character and "manifested forth the glory" of His entire
	Mission. (3) As Christ countenanced our seasons of festivity,
	so also that greater fulness which befits such; so far was He
	from encouraging that asceticism which has since been so often
	put for all religion. (4) The character and authority ascribed by
	Romanists to the Virgin is directly in the teeth of this and other
	scriptures.
