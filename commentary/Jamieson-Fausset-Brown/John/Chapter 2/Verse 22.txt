<p><b>22. believed the scripture</b>—on
	this subject; that is, what was meant, which was hid from them till
	then. Mark (1) <i>The act by which Christ signalized His first public
	appearance in the Temple.</i> Taking "His fan in His hand, He
	purges His floor," not thoroughly indeed, but enough to
	<i>foreshadow His last act</i> towards that faithless people—<i>to
	sweep them out of God's house.</i> (2) The sign of His authority to
	do this is the announcement, at this first outset of His ministry, of
	that coming death by their hands, and resurrection by His own, which
	were to pave the way for their judicial ejection.</p>
