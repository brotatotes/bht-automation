3-10. Peter therefore went forth,
	and that other disciple, and came first to the sepulchreâ€”These
	particulars have a singular air of artless truth about them. Mary, in
	her grief, runs to the two apostles who were soon to be so closely
	associated in proclaiming the Saviour's resurrection, and they,
	followed by Mary, hasten to see with their own eyes. The younger
	disciple outruns the older; love haply supplying swifter wings. He
	stoops, he gazes in, but enters not the open sepulchre, held back
	probably by a reverential fear. The bolder Peter, coming up, goes in
	at once, and is rewarded with bright evidence of what had happened.
