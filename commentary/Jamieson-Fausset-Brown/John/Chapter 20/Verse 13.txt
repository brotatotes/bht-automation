<p><b>13. Woman, why weepest thou?</b>—You
	would think the vision too much for a lone woman. But absorbed in the
	one Object of her affection and pursuit, she speaks out her grief
	without fear. 
	</p>
<p><b>Because,</b> &amp;c.—that
	is, Can I choose but weep, when "they have taken away,"
	&amp;c., repeating her very words to Peter and John. On this she
	turned herself and saw Jesus Himself standing beside her, but took
	Him for the gardener. Clad therefore in some such style He must have
	been. But if any ask, as too curious interpreters do, whence He got
	those habiliments, we answer [with OLSHAUSEN
	and LUTHARDT] where the
	two angels got theirs. Nor did the voice of His first words disclose
	Him to Mary—"Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?"
	He will <i>try</i> her ere he <i>tell</i> her. She answers not the
	stranger's question, but comes straight to her point with him.</p>
