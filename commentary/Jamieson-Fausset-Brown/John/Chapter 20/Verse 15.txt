<p><b>15. Sir, if thou have borne him
	hence</b>—borne <i>whom?</i> She says not. She can think only of
	<i>One,</i> and thinks others must understand her. It reminds one of
	the question of the Spouse, "Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+3:3">Song of Solomon 3:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>tell me where thou hast laid
	him, and I will take him away</b>—Wilt thou, dear fragile woman?
	But it is the language of sublime affection, that thinks itself fit
	for anything if once in possession of its Object. It is enough. Like
	Joseph, He can no longer restrain Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+3:3- :">Song of Solomon 3:3- :</span>).</p>
