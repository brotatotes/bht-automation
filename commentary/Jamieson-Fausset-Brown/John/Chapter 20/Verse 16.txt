<p><b>16, 17. Jesus saith unto her,
	Mary</b>—It is not now the distant, though respectful, "Woman."
	It is the oft-repeated name, uttered, no doubt, with all the wonted
	manner, and bringing a rush of unutterable and overpowering
	associations with it. 
	</p>
<p><b>She turned herself, and saith
	to him, Rabboni!</b>—But that single word of transported
	recognition was not enough for woman's full heart. Not knowing the
	change which had passed upon Him, she hastens to express by her
	action what words failed to clothe; but she is checked.</p>
