<p><b>19-23. the same day at evening, the
	first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were
	assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus</b>—plainly not by the
	ordinary way of entrance.

<p><b>and saith unto them Peace be
	unto you</b>—not the mere <i>wish</i> that even His own exalted
	peace might be theirs (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27">John 14:27</span>),
	but conveying it into their hearts, even as He "opened their
	understandings to understand the scriptures" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+14:27- :">John 14:27- :</span>).</p>
