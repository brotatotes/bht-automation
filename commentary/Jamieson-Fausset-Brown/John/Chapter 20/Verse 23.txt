23. Whose soever sins ye remit, they
	are remitted unto them, &c.—In any literal and
	authoritative sense this power was never exercised by one
	of the apostles, and plainly was never understood by
	themselves as possessed by them or conveyed to them. (See on  :-). The power to intrude upon the relation between men and
	God cannot have been given by Christ to His ministers in any but a
	ministerial or declarative sense—as the authorized
	interpreters of His word, while in the actings of His
	ministers, the real nature of the power committed to them is seen in
	the exercise of church discipline.
 :-. JESUS AGAIN
	APPEARS TO THE ASSEMBLED
	DISCIPLES.
