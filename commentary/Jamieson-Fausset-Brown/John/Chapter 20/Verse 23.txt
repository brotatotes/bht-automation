<p><b>23. Whose soever sins ye remit, they
	are remitted unto them,</b> &amp;c.—In any <i>literal</i> and
	<i>authoritative</i> sense <i>this power was never exercised by one
	of the apostles,</i> and plainly <i>was never understood by
	themselves as possessed by them or conveyed to them.</i> (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The power to intrude upon the relation between men and
	God cannot have been given by Christ to His ministers in any but a
	<i>ministerial</i> or <i>declarative</i> sense—as the authorized
	interpreters of His word, while in the <i>actings</i> of His
	ministers, the real nature of the power committed to them is seen in
	the exercise of <i>church discipline.</i>
