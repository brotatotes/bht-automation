<p><b>25. We have seen the Lord</b>—This
	way of speaking of Jesus (as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:20">John 20:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:7">John 21:7</span>), so suited to His
	resurrection-state, was soon to become the prevailing style. 
	</p>
<p><b>Except I see in his hands the
	print of the nails, and put my linger into the print of the nails,
	and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe</b>—The very
	form of this speech betokens the strength of the unbelief. "It
	is not, <i>If I shall see I shall believe,</i> but, <i>Unless I shall
	see I will not believe;</i> nor does he expect to see, although the
	others tell him they had" [BENGEL].
	How Christ Himself viewed this state of mind, we know from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:7- :">John 21:7- :</span>, "He upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness
	of heart because they believed not them which had seen Him after He
	was risen." But whence sprang this pertinacity of resistance in
	<i>such</i> minds? Not certainly from reluctance to believe, but as
	in Nathanael (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:46">John 1:46</span>)
	from mere dread of mistake in so vital a matter.</p>
