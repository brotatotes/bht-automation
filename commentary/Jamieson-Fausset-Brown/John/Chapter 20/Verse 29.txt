<p><b>29. because thou hast seen me, thou
	hast believed</b>—words of measured commendation, but of indirect
	and doubtless painfully—felt rebuke: that is, 'Thou hast indeed
	believed; it is well: it is only on the evidence of thy senses, and
	after peremptorily refusing all evidence short of that.' 
	</p>
<p><b>blessed they that have not
	seen, and yet have believed</b>—"Wonderful indeed and rich in
	blessing for us who have not seen Him, is this closing word of the
	Gospel" [ALFORD].

<p>The connection of these verses
	with the last words of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:29">John 20:29</span>
	is beautiful: that is, And indeed, as the Lord pronounced them
	blessed who not having seen Him have yet believed, so for that one
	end have the whole contents of this Gospel been recorded, that all
	who read it may believe on Him, and believing, have life in that
	blessed name.</p>
