	PARTICULARS. 
	</p>
<p>(That this chapter was added by
	another hand has been asserted, against clear evidence to the
	contrary, by some late critics, chiefly because the Evangelist had
	<i>concluded</i> his part of the work with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:30">John 20:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:31">John 20:31</span>. But neither in the
	Epistles of the New Testament, nor in other good authors, is it
	unusual to insert supplementary matter, and so have more than one
	conclusion).</p>
