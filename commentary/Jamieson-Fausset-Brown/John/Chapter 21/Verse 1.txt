<p><b>1, 2. Jesus showed himself
	again</b>—manifested himself again. 
	</p>
<p><b>and on this wise he
	manifested himself</b>—This way of speaking shows that after His
	resurrection He appeared to them but <i>occasionally, unexpectedly,</i>
	and in a way quite <i>unearthly,</i> though yet <i>really</i> and
	<i>corporeally.</i></p>
