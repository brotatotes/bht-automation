15-17. when they had dined, Jesus
	saith—Silence appears to have reigned during the meal; unbroken
	on His part, that by their mute observation of Him they might
	have their assurance of His identity the more confirmed; and on
	theirs, from reverential shrinking to speak till He did. 
	Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
	thou me more than these?—referring lovingly to those sad words
	of Peter, shortly before denying his Lord, "Though all men
	shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I never be
	offended" (Matthew 26:33), and
	intending by this allusion to bring the whole scene vividly before
	his mind and put him to shame. 
	Yea, Lord; thou knowest that
	I love thee—He adds not, "more than these," but
	prefixes a touching appeal to the Saviour's own omniscience for the
	truth of his protestation, which makes it a totally different kind of
	speech from his former. 
	He saith unto him, Feed my
	lambs—It is surely wrong to view this term as a mere diminutive
	of affection, and as meaning the same thing as "the sheep"
	[WEBSTER and WILKINSON].
	It is much more according to usage to understand by the "lambs,"
	young and tender disciples, whether in age or Christian
	standing (Isaiah 40:11; 1 John 2:12;
	1 John 2:13), and by the "sheep"
	the more mature. Shall we say (with many) that Peter was here
	reinstated in office? Not exactly, since he was not actually excluded
	from it. But after such conduct as his, the deep wound which the
	honor of Christ had received, the stain brought on his office, the
	damage done to his high standing among his brethren, and even his own
	comfort, in prospect of the great work before him, required some such
	renewal of his call and re-establishment of his position as this.
