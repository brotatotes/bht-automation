<p><b>16. He saith to him . . . the second
	time . . . lovest thou me,</b> c.—In this repetition of the
	question, though the wound was meant to be reopened, the words "<i>more
	than these</i>" are not repeated for Christ is a <i>tender</i>
	as well as <i>skilful</i> Physician, and Peter's silence on that
	point was confession enough of his sin and folly. On Peter's
	repeating his protestation in the same words, our Lord rises higher
	in the manifestation of His restoring grace.

<p><b>Feed</b>—keep. 
	</p>
<p><b>my sheep</b>—It has been
	observed that the word here is studiously changed, from one
	signifying simply to <i>feed,</i> to one signifying to <i>tend</i> as
	a shepherd, denoting the <i>abiding</i> exercise of that vocation,
	and in its highest functions.</p>
