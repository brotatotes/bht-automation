<p><b>18, 19. When thou wast
	young</b>—embracing the whole period of life to the verge of old
	age. 
	</p>
<p><b>thou girdedst thyself, and
	walkedst whither thou wouldest</b>—wast thine own master. 
	</p>
<p><b>when . . . old thou shalt
	stretch forth thine hands</b>—to be bound for execution, though not
	necessarily meaning <i>on a cross.</i> There is no reason, however,
	to doubt the very early tradition that Peter's death was by
	crucifixion.</p>
