19. This spake he, signifying by
	what death he should glorify God—not, therefore, a mere
	prediction of the manner of his death, but of the honor
	to be conferred upon him by dying for his Master. And, indeed, beyond
	doubt, this prediction was intended to follow up his triple
	restoration:—"Yes, Simon, thou shall not only feed My lambs,
	and feed My sheep, but after a long career of such service, shalt be
	counted worthy to die for the name of the Lord Jesus." 
	And when he had spoken this,
	he saith unto him, Follow me—By thus connecting the utterance
	of this prediction with the invitation to follow Him, the Evangelist
	would indicate the deeper sense in which the call was understood, not
	merely to go along with Him at that moment, but to come after Him,
	"taking up his cross."
