<p><b>22, 23. Jesus saith to him, If I
	will that he tarry fill I come, what is that to thee? follow thou
	me</b>â€”From the fact that John alone of the Twelve survived the
	destruction of Jerusalem, and so witnessed the commencement of that
	series of events which belongs to "the last days," many
	good interpreters think that this is a virtual prediction of fact,
	and not a mere supposition. But this is very doubtful, and it seems
	more natural to consider our Lord as intending to give <i>no positive
	indication</i> of John's fate at all, but to signify that this was a
	matter which belonged to the Master of both, who would disclose or
	conceal it as He thought proper, and that Peter's part was to mind
	his own affairs. Accordingly, in "follow thou Me," the word
	"<i>thou</i>" is emphatic. Observe the absolute disposal of
	human life which Christ claims: "<i>If I will</i> that he tarry
	till I come," &amp;c.</p>
