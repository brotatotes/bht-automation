25. And there are many other things
	which Jesus did—(Compare John 20:30;
	John 20:31). 
	if . . . written every one, I
	suppose—an expression used to show that what follows is not to
	be pressed too far. 
	even the world itself would
	not hold the books, &c.—not a mere hyperbolical
	expression, unlike the sublime simplicity of this writer, but
	intended to let his reader know that, even now that he had done, he
	felt his materials so far from being exhausted, that he was still
	running over, and could multiply "Gospels" to almost any
	extent within the strict limits of what "Jesus did." But in
	the limitation of these matchless histories, in point of
	number, there is as much of that divine wisdom which has presided
	over and pervades the living oracles, as in their variety and
	fulness.
