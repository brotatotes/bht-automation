	The question clearly implies that the doctrine of regeneration is
	so far disclosed in the Old Testament that Nicodemus was culpable in
	being ignorant of it. Nor is it merely as something that should
	be experienced under the Gospel that the Old Testament holds
	it forth—as many distinguished critics allege, denying that there
	was any such thing as regeneration before Christ. For our Lord's
	proposition is universal, that no fallen man is or can be spiritual
	without a regenerating operation of the Holy Ghost, and the necessity
	of a spiritual obedience under whatever name, in opposition to
	mere mechanical services, is proclaimed throughout all the Old
	Testament.
