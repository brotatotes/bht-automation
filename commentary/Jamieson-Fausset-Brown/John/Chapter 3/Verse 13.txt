<p><b>13. no man hath ascended,</b>
	&amp;c.—There is something paradoxical in this language—"No
	one has gone up but He that came down, even He who is at once both up
	and down." Doubtless it was intended to startle and constrain
	His auditor to think that there must be mysterious elements in His
	Person. The old Socinians, to subvert the doctrine of the
	pre-existence of Christ, seized upon this passage as teaching that
	the man Jesus was secretly caught up to heaven to receive His
	instructions, and then "came down from heaven" to deliver
	them. But the sense manifestly is this: "The perfect knowledge
	of God is not obtained by any man's going up from earth to heaven to
	receive it—no man hath so ascended—but He whose <i>proper
	habitation,</i> in His essential and eternal nature, is heaven, hath,
	by taking human flesh, descended as the Son of man to disclose the
	Father, whom He knows by immediate gaze alike in the flesh as before
	He assumed it, being essentially and unchangeably 'in the bosom of
	the Father'" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:18">John 1:18</span>).</p>
