<p><b>16. For God so loved,</b> c.—What
	proclamation of the Gospel has been so oft on the lips of
	missionaries and preachers in every age since it was first uttered?
	What has sent such thrilling sensations through millions of mankind?
	What has been honored to bring such multitudes to the feet of Christ?
	What to kindle in the cold and selfish breasts of mortals the fires
	of self-sacrificing love to mankind, as these words of transparent
	simplicity, yet overpowering majesty? The picture embraces several
	distinct compartments: "THE
	WORLD"—in its
	widest sense—<i>ready</i> "<i>to perish</i>" the immense
	"LOVE OF GOD"
	<i>to that perishing world,</i> measurable only, and conceivable
	only, by the gift which it drew forth from Him; THE
	GIFT itself—"He <i>so</i>
	loved the world that He <i>gave</i> His only begotten Son," or,
	in the language of Paul, "<i>spared not</i> His own Son"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:32">Romans 8:32</span>), or in that addressed
	to Abraham when ready to offer Isaac on the altar, "<i>withheld
	not</i> His Son, His only Son, whom He loved" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:32- :">Romans 8:32- :</span>); the FRUIT of
	this stupendous gift—not only <i>deliverance from</i> impending
	"<i>perdition,</i>" but <i>the bestowal of everlasting
	life;</i> the MODE in
	which all takes effect—by "<i>believing</i>" on the Son.
	How would Nicodemus' narrow Judaism become invisible in the blaze of
	this Sun of righteousness seen rising on "the world" with
	healing in His wings! (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2">Malachi 4:2</span>).</p>
