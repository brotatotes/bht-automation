<p><b>2. came to Jesus by night</b>—One

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:24">John 2:24</span>, yet inwardly craving
	further satisfaction, Nicodemus comes to Jesus in quest of it, but
	comes "by night" (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:38">John 19:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:39">John 19:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:42">John 12:42</span>);

<p><b>come from God</b>—<i>an
	expression never applied to a merely human messenger,</i> and
	probably meaning more here—but only as "a <i>teacher,</i>"
	and in His miracles he sees a proof merely that "God is with
	Him." Thus, while unable to repress his convictions, he is
	afraid of committing himself too far.</p>
