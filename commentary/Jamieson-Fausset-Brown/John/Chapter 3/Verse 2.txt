2. came to Jesus by night—One
	of those superficial "believers" mentioned in John 2:23;
	John 2:24, yet inwardly craving
	further satisfaction, Nicodemus comes to Jesus in quest of it, but
	comes "by night" (see John 19:38;
	John 19:39; John 12:42);
	he avows his conviction that He was 
	come from God—an
	expression never applied to a merely human messenger, and
	probably meaning more here—but only as "a teacher,"
	and in His miracles he sees a proof merely that "God is with
	Him." Thus, while unable to repress his convictions, he is
	afraid of committing himself too far.
