<p><b>27-30. A man,</b> c.—"I do my
	heaven-prescribed work, and that is enough for me. Would you have me
	mount into my Master's place? Said I not unto you, I am not the
	Christ? The Bride is not mine, why should the people stay with me??
	Mine it is to point the burdened to the Lamb of God that taketh away
	the sin of the world, to tell them there is Balm in Gilead, and a
	Physician there. And shall I grudge to see them, in obedience to the
	call, flying as a cloud, and as doves to their windows? Whose is the
	Bride but the Bridegroom's? Enough for me to be the Bridegroom's
	<i>friend,</i> sent by Him to negotiate the match, privileged to
	bring together the Saviour and those He is come to seek and to save,
	and rejoicing with joy unspeakable if I may but 'stand and hear the
	Bridegroom's voice,' witnessing the blessed espousals. Say ye, then,
	they go from me to Him? Ye bring me glad tidings of great joy. He
	must increase, but I must decrease this, my joy, therefore is
	fulfilled."

<p><b>A man can receive,</b>
	c.—assume nothing, that is, lawfully and with any success that is,
	Every man has his work and sphere appointed him from above, Even
	Christ Himself came under this law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
