<p><b>3. Except,</b> c.—This blunt and
	curt reply was plainly meant to shake the whole edifice of the man's
	religion, in order to lay a deeper and more enduring foundation.
	Nicodemus probably thought he had gone a long way, and expected,
	perhaps, to be complimented on his candor. Instead of this, he is
	virtually told that he has raised a question which he is not in a
	capacity to solve, and that before approaching it, <i>his spiritual
	vision required to be rectified by an entire revolution on his inner

<p><b>cannot see</b>—can have no

	death," c.).

<p><b>the kingdom of God</b>—whether
	in its beginnings here (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16">Luke 16:16</span>),
	or its consummation hereafter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:34">Matthew 25:34</span>
