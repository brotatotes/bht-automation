31-34. He that, c.—Here is the
	reason why He must increase while all human teachers must decrease.
	The Master "cometh from above"—descending from His
	proper element, the region of those "heavenly things"
	which He came to reveal, and so, although mingling with men and
	things on the earth, is not "of the earth," either in
	Person or Word. The servants, on the contrary, springing of earth,
	are of the earth, and their testimony, even though divine in
	authority, partakes necessarily of their own earthiness. (So strongly
	did the Baptist feel this contrast that the last clause just repeats
	the first). It is impossible for a sharper line of distinction to be
	drawn between Christ and all human teachers, even when divinely
	commissioned and speaking by the power of the Holy Ghost. And who
	does not perceive it? The words of prophets and apostles are
	undeniable and most precious truth but in the words of Christ we hear
	a voice as from the excellent Glory, the Eternal Word making Himself
	heard in our own flesh.
