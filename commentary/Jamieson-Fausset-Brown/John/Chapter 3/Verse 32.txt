	on John 3:11 and John 3:11- :). 
	and no man receiveth,
	&c.—John's disciples had said, "All come to Him"
	(John 3:26). The Baptist here
	virtually says, Would it were so, but alas! they are next to "none"
	[BENGEL]. They were far
	readier to receive himself, and obliged him to say, I am not the
	Christ, and he seems pained at this.
