<p><b>32. what he hath seen and heard</b>—(See

<p><b>and no man receiveth,</b>
	&amp;c.—John's disciples had said, "<i>All</i> come to Him"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:26">John 3:26</span>). The Baptist here
	virtually says, Would it were so, but alas! they are next to "<i>none</i>"
	[BENGEL]. They were far
	readier to receive himself, and obliged him to say, I am not the
	Christ, and he seems pained at this.</p>
