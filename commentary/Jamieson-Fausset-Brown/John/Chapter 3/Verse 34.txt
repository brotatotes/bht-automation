34. for God giveth not the Spirit by
	measureâ€”Here, again, the sharpest conceivable line of
	distinction is drawn between Christ and all human-inspired teachers:

	fulness of divine life and divine power. The present tense "giveth,"
	very aptly points out the permanent communication of the Spirit by
	the Father to the Son, so that a constant flow and reflow of living
	power is to be understood (Compare  :-) [OLSHAUSEN].
