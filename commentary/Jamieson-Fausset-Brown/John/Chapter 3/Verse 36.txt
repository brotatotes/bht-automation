<p><b>36. hath everlasting life</b>—already
	has it. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:18">John 3:18</span> and
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>shall not see life</b>—The
	contrast here is striking: The one has already a life that will
	endure for ever—the other not only has it not now, but shall never
	have it—never see it. 
	</p>
<p><b>abideth on him</b>—It was
	on Him before, and not being <i>removed</i> in the only possible way,
	by "believing on the Son," it necessarily <i>remaineth</i>
	on him! <i>Note.</i>—How flatly does this contradict the teaching
	of many in our day, that there neither was, nor is, anything <i>in
	God</i> against sinners which needed to be removed by Christ, but
	only <i>in men</i> against God!</p>
