<p><b>flesh</b>—Not the mere
	material body, but all that comes into the world by birth, <i>the
	entire man;</i> yet not humanity simply, but in its corrupted,

	though a man "could enter a second time into his mother's womb
	and be born," he would be no nearer this "new birth"
	than before (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+14:4">Job 14:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:5">Psalms 51:5</span>).
