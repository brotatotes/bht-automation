<p><b>8. The wind,</b> c.—<i>Breath</i>
	and <i>spirit</i> (one word both in <i>Hebrew</i> and <i>Greek</i>)
	are constantly brought together in Scripture as analogous (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+27:3">Job 27:3</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+33:4">Job 33:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:9-14">Ezekiel 37:9-14</span>).

<p><b>canst not tell,</b> c.—The
	laws which govern the motion of the <i>winds</i> are even yet but
	partially discovered but the risings, failings, and change in
	direction many times in a day, of those <i>gentle breezes</i> here
	referred to, will probably ever be a mystery to us: So of the
	operation of the Holy Ghost in the new birth.</p>
