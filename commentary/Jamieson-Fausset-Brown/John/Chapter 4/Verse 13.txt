<p><b>13, 14. thirst again . . . never
	thirst,</b> c.—The contrast here is fundamental and all
	comprehensive. "This water" plainly means "this
	natural water and <i>all satisfactions of a like earthly and
	perishable nature.</i>" Coming to us <i>from without,</i> and
	reaching only the <i>superficial</i> parts of our nature, they are
	soon spent, and need to be anew supplied as much as if we had never
	experienced them before, while the deeper wants of our being are not
	reached by them at all whereas the "water" that Christ
	gives—<i>spiritual life</i>—is struck out of the very depths of
	our being, making the soul not a <i>cistern,</i> for holding water
	<i>poured into</i> it <i>from without,</i> but a <i>fountain</i> (the
	word had been better so rendered, to distinguish it from the word
	rendered "well" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), springing, gushing, bubbling up and flowing forth <i>within</i>
	us, ever fresh, ever living. <i>The indwelling of the Holy Ghost as
	the Spirit of Christ</i> is the secret of this life with all its
	enduring energies and satisfactions, as is expressly said (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "Never thirsting," then, means simply that
	such souls have the supplies <i>at home.</i>
