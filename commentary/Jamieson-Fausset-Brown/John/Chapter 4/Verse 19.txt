19, 20. Sir, I perceive,
	c.—Seeing herself all revealed, does she now break down and ask
	what hopes there might be for one so guilty? Nay, her convictions
	have not reached that point yet. She ingeniously shifts the subject
	from a personal to a public question. It is not, "Alas, what a
	wicked life am I leading!" but "Lo, what a wonderful
	prophet I got into conversation with! He will be able to settle that
	interminable dispute between us and the Jews. Sir, you must know all
	about such matters—our fathers hold to this mountain here,"
	pointing to Gerizim in Samaria, "as the divinely
	consecrated place of worship, but ye Jews say that Jerusalem
	is the proper place—which of us is right?" How slowly does the
	human heart submit to thorough humiliation! (Compare the
	prodigal see on  :-).
	Doubtless our Lord saw through the fetch; but does He say, "That
	question is not the point just now, but have you been living in the
	way described, yea or nay? Till this is disposed of I cannot be drawn
	into theological controversies." The Prince of preachers takes
	another method: He humors the poor woman, letting her take her own
	way, allowing her to lead while He follows—but thus only the more
	effectually gaining His object. He answers her question, pours light
	into her mind on the spirituality of all true worship, as of
	its glorious Object, and so brings her insensibly to the point at
	which He could disclose to her wondering mind whom she was all the
	while speaking to.
