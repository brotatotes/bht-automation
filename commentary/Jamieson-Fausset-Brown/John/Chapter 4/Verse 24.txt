<p><b>21-24. Woman,</b> c.—Here are
	three weighty pieces of information: (1) The point raised will very
	soon cease to be of any moment, for a total change of dispensation is
	about to come over the Church. (2) The Samaritans are wrong, not only
	as to the <i>place,</i> but the whole <i>grounds</i> and <i>nature</i>
	of their worship, while in all these respects the truth lies with the
	Jews. (3) As God is a <i>Spirit,</i> so He both <i>invites</i> and
	<i>demands</i> a <i>spiritual worship,</i> and already all is in
	preparation for a <i>spiritual economy,</i> more in harmony with the
	true nature of acceptable service than the ceremonial worship by
	consecrated <i>persons, place,</i> and <i>times,</i> which God for a
	time has seen meet to keep up till fulness of the time should come.
