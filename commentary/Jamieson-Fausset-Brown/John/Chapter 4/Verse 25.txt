<p><b>25, 26. I know Messias cometh . . .
	when He is come,</b> &amp;c.—If we take our Lord's immediate
	disclosure of Himself, in answer to this, as the proper key to its
	meaning to <i>His ear,</i> we can hardly doubt that the woman was
	already <i>all but prepared for even this startling announcement,</i>
	which indeed she seems (from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) to have already begun to suspect by His revealing her to
	herself. Thus quickly, under so matchless a Teacher, was she brought
	up from her sunken condition to a frame of mind and heart capable of
	the noblest revelations.

<p><b>tell us all things</b>—an
	expectation founded probably on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
