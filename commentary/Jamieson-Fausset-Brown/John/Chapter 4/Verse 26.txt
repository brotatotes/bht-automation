<p><b>26. I that speak . . . am he</b>—He
	scarce ever said anything like this to His own people, the Jews. He
	had magnified them to the woman, and yet to themselves He is to the
	last far more reserved than to her—<i>proving</i> rather than
	plainly <i>telling</i> them He was the Christ. But what would not
	have been <i>safe</i> among them was safe enough with her, whose
	<i>simplicity</i> at this stage of the conversation appears from the
	sequel to have become perfect. What now will the woman say? We
	listen, the scene has changed, a new party arrives, the disciples
	have been to Sychar, at some distance, to buy bread, and on their
	return are astonished at the company their Lord has been holding in
	their absence.</p>
