28-30. left her water-pot—How
	exquisitely natural! The presence of strangers made her feel that it
	was time for her to withdraw, and He who knew what was in her heart,
	and what she was going to the city to do, let her go without
	exchanging a word with her in the hearing of others. Their interview
	was too sacred, and the effect on the woman too overpowering (not to
	speak of His own deep emotion) to allow of its being continued. But
	this one artless touch—that she "left her water-pot"—speaks
	volumes. The living water was already beginning to spring up within
	her; she found that man doth not live by bread nor by water only, and
	that there was a water of wondrous virtue that raised people above
	meat and drink, and the vessels that held them, and all human things.
	In short, she was transported, forgot everything but One, and her
	heart running over with the tale she had to tell, she hastens home
	and pours it out.
