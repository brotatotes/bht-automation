<p><b>34. My meat is,</b> c.—"A
	Servant here to fulfil a prescribed work, to <i>do</i> and to <i>finish,</i>
	that is 'meat' to Me and of this, while you were away, I have had My
	fill." And of what does He speak thus? Of the condescension,
	pity, patience, wisdom He had been laying out upon <i>one soul</i>—a
	very humble woman, and in some respects repulsive too! But He had
	gained her, and through her was going to gain more, and lay perhaps
	the foundations of a great work in the country of Samaria; and this
	filled His whole soul and raised Him above the sense of natural
	hunger (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:4">Matthew 4:4</span>).</p>
