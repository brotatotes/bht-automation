<p><b>36. he that reapeth,</b> c.—As our
	Lord could not mean that the reaper only, and not the sower, received
	"wages," in the sense of <i>personal reward</i> for his
	work, the "wages" here can be no other than the joy of
	having such a harvest to gather in—the joy of "gathering fruit
	unto life eternal." 
	</p>
<p><b>rejoice together</b>—The
	blessed issue of the whole ingathering is the interest alike of the
	sower as of the reaper it is no more the fruit of the last operation
	than of the first; and just as there can be no reaping without
	previous sowing, so have those servants of Christ, to whom is
	assigned the pleasant task of merely reaping the spiritual harvest,
	no work to do, and no joy to taste, that has not been prepared to
	their hand by the toilsome and often thankless work of their
	predecessors in the field. <i>The joy,</i> therefore, <i>of the great
	harvest festivity will be the common joy of all who have taken any
	part in the work from the first operation to the last.</i> (See

	What encouragement is here for those "fishers of men" who
	"have toiled all the night" of their official life, and, to
	human appearance, "have taken nothing!"</p>
