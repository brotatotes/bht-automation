38. I sent you, &c.—The I
	is emphatic—I, the Lord of the whole harvest: "sent you,"
	points to their past appointment to the apostleship, though it
	has reference only to their future discharge of it, for they
	had nothing to do with the present ingathering of the Sycharites. 
	ye bestowed no labour—meaning
	that much of their future success would arise from the preparation
	already made for them. (See on  :-). 
	others laboured—Referring
	to the Old Testament laborers, the Baptist, and by implication
	Himself, though He studiously keeps this in the background, that
	the line of distinction between Himself and all His servants might
	not be lost sight of. "Christ represents Himself as the
	Husbandman [rather the Lord of the laborers], who has the direction
	both of the sowing and of the harvest, who commissions all the
	agents—those of the Old Testament as well as of the New—and
	therefore does not stand on a level with either the sowers or the
	reapers" [OLSHAUSEN].
