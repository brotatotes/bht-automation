<p><b>38. I sent you,</b> &amp;c.—The <i>I</i>
	is emphatic—I, the Lord of the whole harvest: "sent you,"
	points to their <i>past</i> appointment to the apostleship, though it
	has reference only to their <i>future</i> discharge of it, for they
	had nothing to do with the present ingathering of the Sycharites. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye bestowed no labour</b>—meaning
	that much of their future success would arise from the <i>preparation
	already made</i> for them. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>others laboured</b>—Referring
	to the Old Testament laborers, the Baptist, and <i>by implication</i>
	Himself, though He studiously keeps this in the background, <i>that
	the line of distinction between Himself and all His servants might
	not be lost sight of.</i> "Christ represents Himself as the
	Husbandman [rather the Lord of the laborers], who has the direction
	both of the sowing and of the harvest, who commissions <i>all</i> the
	agents—those of the Old Testament as well as of the New—and
	therefore does not stand on a level with either the sowers or the
	reapers" [OLSHAUSEN].</p>
