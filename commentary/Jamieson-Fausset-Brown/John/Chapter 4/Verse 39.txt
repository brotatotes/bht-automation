	begins to appear. These Samaritans were the foundation of the Church
	afterwards built up there. No miracle appears to have been wrought
	there (but unparalleled supernatural knowledge displayed): "<i>we
	have heard Him ourselves</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:35- :">John 4:35- :</span>) sufficed to raise their faith to a point never attained by
	the Jews, and hardly as yet by the disciples—that He was "the
	Saviour of <i>the world</i>" [ALFORD].
	"This incident is further remarkable as a rare instance of the
	Lord's ministry producing <i>an awakening on a large scale</i>"
	[OLSHAUSEN].</p>
