<p><b>40. abode two days</b>—Two
	precious days, surely, to the Redeemer Himself! Unsought, He had come
	to His own, yet His own received Him not: now those who were not His
	own had come to Him, been won by Him, and invited Him to their town
	that others might share with them in the benefit of His wonderful
	ministry. Here, then, would He solace His already wounded spirit and
	have in this outfield village triumph of His grace, a sublime
	foretaste of the inbringing of the whole Gentile world into the
	Church.
