<p><b>44. For Jesus testified,</b> c.â€”This
	verse had occasioned much discussion. For it seems strange, if "His
	own country" here means <i>Nazareth,</i> which was in Galilee,
	that it should be said He came to Galilee <i>because</i> in one of
	its towns He expected no good reception. But all will be simple and
	natural if we fill up the statement thus: "He went into the
	region of Galilee, but not, as might have been expected, to that part
	of it called 'His own country,' Nazareth (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:4">Mark 6:4</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:24">Luke 4:24</span>), <i>for</i> He acted on
	the maxim which He oft repeated, that 'a prophet,'" &amp;c.</p>
