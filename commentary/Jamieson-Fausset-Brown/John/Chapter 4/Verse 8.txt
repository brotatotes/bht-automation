<p><b>6-8. wearied . . . sat thus</b>—that
	is, "as you might fancy a weary man would"; an instance of
	the graphic style of St. John [WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON]. In fact,
	this is perhaps the most <i>human</i> of all the scenes of our Lord's
	earthly history. We seem to be beside Him, overhearing all that is
	here recorded, nor could any painting of the scene on canvas, however
	perfect, do other than lower the conception which this exquisite
	narrative conveys to the devout and intelligent reader. But with all
	that is <i>human,</i> how much also of the <i>divine</i> have we
	here, both blended in one glorious manifestation of the majesty,
	grace, pity, patience with which "the Lord" imparts light
	and life to this unlikeliest of strangers, standing midway between
	Jews and heathens.

<p><b>the sixth hour</b>—<i>noonday,</i>
	reckoning from six A.M.
	From <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+1:7">Song of Solomon 1:7</span> we know, as from
	other sources, that the very flocks "rested at noon." But
	Jesus, whose maxim was, "I must work the works of Him that sent
	Me while it is day" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4">John 9:4</span>),
	seems to have denied Himself that repose, at least on this occasion,
	probably that He might reach this well when He knew the woman would
	be there. Once there, however, He accepts . . . the grateful ease of
	a seat on the patriarchal stone. But what music is that which I hear
	from His lips, "Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy
	laden, and I will give you rest" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4- :">John 9:4- :</span>).</p>
