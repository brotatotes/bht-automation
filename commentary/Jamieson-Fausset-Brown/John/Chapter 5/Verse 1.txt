1. a feast of the Jewsâ€”What
	feast? No question has more divided the Harmonists of the
	Gospels, and the duration of our Lord's ministry may be said to hinge
	on it. For if, as the majority have thought (until of late years) it
	was a Passover, His ministry lasted three and a half years; if
	not, probably a year less. Those who are dissatisfied with the
	Passover-view all differ among themselves what other feast it was,
	and some of the most acute think there are no grounds for deciding.
	In our judgment the evidence is in favor of its being a Passover,
	but the reasons cannot be stated here.
