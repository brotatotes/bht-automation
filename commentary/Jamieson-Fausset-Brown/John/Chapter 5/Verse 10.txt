<p><b>10-16. The Jews</b>—that is, <i>those
	in authority.</i> (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.)

<p><b>it is not lawful to carry thy
	bed</b>—a glorious testimony to the cure, as <i>instantaneous</i>
	and <i>complete,</i> from the lips of the most prejudiced! (And what
	a contrast does it, as all our Lord's miracles, present to the
	bungling miracles of the Church of Rome!) In <i>ordinary</i>
	circumstances, the rulers had the law on their side (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ne+13:15">Nehemiah 13:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:21">Jeremiah 17:21</span>). But when the man
	referred them to "Him that had made him whole" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:21- :">Jeremiah 17:21- :</span>) as his authority, the argument was resistless. Yet they
	ingeniously parried the thrust, asking him, not who had "made
	him whole"—that would have condemned themselves and defeated
	their purpose—but who had bidden him "take up his bed and
	walk," in other words, who had dared to order a breach of the
	sabbath? It is time we were looking after Him—thus hoping to shake
	the man's faith in his Healer.</p>
