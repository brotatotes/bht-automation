<p><b>18. God was his Father</b>—literally,
	"His own [or peculiar] Father," (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The addition is their own, but a very proper one.

<p><b>making himself equal with
	God</b>—rightly gathering this to be His meaning, not from the mere
	words "My Father," but from His claim of right to act as
	His Father did in the like high sphere, and by the same law of
	ceaseless activity in that sphere. And as, instead of instantly
	disclaiming any such meaning—as He must have done if it was
	false—He positively sets His seal to it in the following verses,
	merely explaining how consistent such claim was with the prerogatives
	of His Father, it is beyond all doubt that we have here an assumption
	of <i>peculiar personal Sonship,</i> or participation in the Father's
	essential nature.</p>
