<p><b>20. Father loveth . . . and showeth
	him all,</b> c.—As love has no concealments, so it results from the
	perfect fellowship and mutual endearment of the Father and the Son
	(see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1">John 1:1</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:1- :">John 1:1- :</span>), whose interests are one, even as their nature, that the
	Father communicates to the Son all His counsels, and what has been
	thus shown to the Son is by Him executed in His mediatorial
	character. "With the Father, <i>doing</i> is <i>willing;</i> it
	is only the Son who <i>acts in Time</i>" [ALFORD].
	Three things here are clear: (1) The <i>personal distinctions</i> in
	the Godhead. (2) Unity of <i>action</i> among the Persons results
	from unity of <i>nature.</i> (3) Their oneness of interest is no
	unconscious or involuntary thing, but a thing of glorious
	<i>consciousness, will,</i> and <i>love,</i> of which the Persons
	themselves are the proper Objects.

	and JUDGMENT, which STIER
	beautifully calls God's <i>Regalia.</i> Yet these, Christ says, the
	Father and He do in common.</p>
