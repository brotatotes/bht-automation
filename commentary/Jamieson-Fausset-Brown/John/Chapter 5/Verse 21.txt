	This is His absolute prerogative as God.

<p><b>whom he will</b>—not only
	<i>doing the same divine act,</i> but doing it <i>as the result of
	His own will,</i> even as the Father does it. This statement is of
	immense importance in relation to the miracles of Christ,
	distinguishing them from similar miracles of prophets and apostles,
	who as <i>human instruments</i> were employed to perform
	super-natural actions, while Christ did all as the Father's
	<i>commissioned Servant</i> indeed, but <i>in the exercise of His own
	absolute right of action.</i></p>
