23. honour the Son as . . . the
	Father—As he who believes that Christ in the foregoing verses
	has given a true account of His relation to the Father must of
	necessity hold Him entitled to the same honor as the Father,
	so He here adds that it was the Father's express intention in making
	over all judgment to the Son, that men should thus honor Him. 
	honoureth not the Father—does
	not do it in fact, whatever he may imagine, and will be held as not
	doing it by the Father Himself, who will accept no homage which is
	not accorded to His own Son.
