<p><b>25-29. The hour cometh</b>—in its
	whole fulness, at Pentecost.

<p><b>and now is</b>—in its
	beginnings. 
	</p>
<p><b>the dead</b>—the
	<i>spiritually</i> dead, as is clear from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Here He rises from the calmer phrase "hearing <i>his
	word</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>), to
	the grander expression, "hearing <i>the voice of the Son of
	God,</i>" to signify that as it finds men in a <i>dead</i>
	condition, so it carries with it a <i>resurrection-power.</i>

<p><b>shall live</b>—in the sense
	of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>.</p>
