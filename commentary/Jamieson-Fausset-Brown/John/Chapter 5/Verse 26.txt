<p><b>26. given to the Son,</b> &amp;c.â€”Does
	this refer to the essential life of the Son before all time (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) (as most of the Fathers, and OLSHAUSEN,
	STIER, ALFORD,
	&amp;c., among the moderns), or to the purpose of God that this
	essential life should reside in the Person of the Incarnate Son, and
	be manifested thus to the world? [CALVIN,
	LUCKE, LUTHARDT,
	&amp;c.] The question is as difficult as the subject is high. But as
	all that Christ says of His <i>essential</i> relation to the Father
	is intended to explain and exalt His <i>mediatorial</i> functions, so
	the one seems in our Lord's own mind and language mainly the
	starting-point of the other.</p>
