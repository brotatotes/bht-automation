26. given to the Son, &c.â€”Does
	this refer to the essential life of the Son before all time ( :-) (as most of the Fathers, and OLSHAUSEN,
	STIER, ALFORD,
	&c., among the moderns), or to the purpose of God that this
	essential life should reside in the Person of the Incarnate Son, and
	be manifested thus to the world? [CALVIN,
	LUCKE, LUTHARDT,
	&c.] The question is as difficult as the subject is high. But as
	all that Christ says of His essential relation to the Father
	is intended to explain and exalt His mediatorial functions, so
	the one seems in our Lord's own mind and language mainly the
	starting-point of the other.
