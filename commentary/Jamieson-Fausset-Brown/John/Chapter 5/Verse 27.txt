<p><b>27. because he is the Son of
	man</b>—This seems to confirm the last remark, that what Christ had
	properly in view was the indwelling of the Son's essential life in
	<i>humanity</i> as the great <i>theater</i> and <i>medium</i> of
	divine display, in both the great departments of His work—<i>life-giving
	and judgment.</i> The appointment of a Judge in our <i>own nature</i>
	is one of the most beautiful arrangements of divine wisdom in
	redemption.</p>
