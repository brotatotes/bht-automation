<p><b>29. resurrection of life</b>—that
	is, to life everlasting (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of damnation</b>—It would
	have been harsh to say "the resurrection of death," though
	that is meant, for sinners rise <i>from death to death</i> [BENGEL].
	The resurrection of both classes is an exercise of <i>sovereign
	authority;</i> but in the one case it is an act of <i>grace,</i> in
	the other of <i>justice.</i> (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, from which the language is taken). How awfully grand are
	these unfoldings of His dignity and authority from the mouth of
	Christ Himself! And they are all in the <i>third person;</i> in what
	follows He resumes the <i>first person.</i></p>
