<p><b>30-32. of mine own self do
	nothing</b>—that is, apart from the Father, or in any interest than
	My own. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:19">John 5:19</span>).

<p><b>as I hear</b>—that is, "My
	judgments are all <i>anticipated</i> in the bosom of My Father, to
	which I have immediate access, and by Me only <i>responded to</i> and
	<i>reflected.</i> They cannot therefore err, as I live for one end
	only, to carry into effect the will of Him that sent Me."</p>
