<p><b>37. the Father himself . . . hath
	borne witness of me</b>—not referring, probably, to the voice of
	His baptism, but (as seems from what follows) to the testimony of the
	Old Testament Scripture [CALVIN,
	LUCKE, MEYER,
	LUTHARDT, &amp;c.]. 
	</p>
<p><b>neither heard his voice,</b>
	&amp;c.—never recognized Him in this character. The words are
	"designedly mysterious, like many others which our Lord uttered"
	[STIER].</p>
