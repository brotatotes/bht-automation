<p><b>39-42. Search the scriptures,</b>
	c.—"In the Scriptures ye find your charter of eternal life go
	search them then, and you will find that I am the Great Burden of
	their testimony; yet ye will not come to Me for that life eternal
	which you profess to find there, and of which they tell you I am the
	appointed Dispenser." (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:11">Acts 17:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:12">Acts 17:12</span>). How touching and
	gracious are these last words! Observe here (1) The honor which
	Christ gives to the Scriptures, as a record which all <i>have a right</i>
	and <i>are bound</i> to search—the reverse of which the Church of
	Rome teaches; (2) The opposite extreme is, resting in the mere <i>Book</i>
	without <i>the living Christ,</i> to direct the soul to whom is its
	main use and chiefest glory.</p>
