<p><b>4. an angel,</b> c.—This miracle
	differed in two points from all other miracles recorded in Scripture:
	(1) It was not one, but a succession of miracles periodically
	wrought: (2) As it was only wrought "when the waters were
	troubled," so only upon one patient at a time, and that the
	patient "who first stepped in after the troubling of the
	waters." But this only the more undeniably fixed its miraculous
	character. We have heard of many waters having a medicinal virtue but
	what water was ever known to cure <i>instantaneously</i> a single
	disease? And who ever heard of any water curing all, even the most
	diverse diseases—"blind, halt, withered"—alike? Above
	all, who ever heard of such a thing being done "only at a
	certain season," and most singularly of all, doing it only to
	the first person who stepped in after the moving of the waters? Any
	of these peculiarities—much more all taken together—must have
	proclaimed the supernatural character of the cures wrought. (If the
	text here be genuine, there can be no doubt of the miracle, as there
	were multitudes living when this Gospel was published who, from their
	own knowledge of Jerusalem, could have exposed the falsehood of the
	Evangelist, if no such cure had been known there. The want of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and part of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:3">John 5:3</span> in
	some good manuscripts, and the use of some unusual words in the
	passage, are more easily accounted for than the evidence in their
	favor if they were not originally in the text. Indeed <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:3- :">John 5:3- :</span> is unintelligible without <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:3- :">John 5:3- :</span>. The <i>internal</i> evidence brought against it is merely
	the <i>unlikelihood</i> of such a miracle—a principle which will
	carry us a great deal farther if we allow it to weigh against
	positive evidence).</p>
