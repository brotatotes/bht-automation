	He doubtless visited the spot just to perform this cure, so He knows
	where to find His patient, and the whole previous history of his case

<p><b>Wilt thou be made

	detail his case to deepen in him the feeling of entire helplessness;
	(3) By so singular a question to beget in his desponding heart the
	hope of a cure. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:25- :">John 2:25- :</span>).</p>
