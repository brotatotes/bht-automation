<p><b>7. Sir, I have no man,</b>
	c.—Instead of <i>saying</i> he wished to be cured, he just tells
	with piteous simplicity how fruitless had been all his efforts to
	obtain it, and how <i>helpless</i> and all but <i>hopeless</i> he
	was. Yet not quite. For here he is at the pool, waiting on. It seemed
	of no use nay, only tantalizing, 
	</p>
<p><b>while I am coming, another
	steppeth down before me</b>—the fruit was snatched from his lips.
	Yet he will not go away. He may get nothing by staying, he may drop
	into his grave ere he get into the pool; but by going from the
	appointed, divine way of healing, he can get nothing. Wait therefore
	he will, wait he does, and when Christ comes to heal him, lo! he is
	waiting his turn. <i>What an attitude for a sinner</i> at Mercy's
	gate! The man's hopes seemed low enough ere Christ came to him. He
	might have said, just before "Jesus passed by that way,"
	"This is no use; I shall never get in; let me die at home."
	Then all had been lost. But he <i>held on,</i> and his perseverance
	was rewarded with a glorious cure. Probably some rays of hope darted
	into his heart as he told his tale before those Eyes whose glance
	measured his whole case. But the word of command consummates his
	preparation to receive the cure, and instantaneously works it.</p>
