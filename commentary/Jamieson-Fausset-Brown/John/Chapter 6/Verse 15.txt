<p><b>15. departed . . . to a mountain
	himself alone</b>â€”(1) to <i>rest,</i> which He came to this "desert
	place" on purpose to do before the miracle of the loaves, but
	could not for the multitude that followed Him (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); and (2) "<i>to pray</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:23">Matthew 14:23</span>;

	mountain-top He kept watching the ship (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:46- :">Mark 6:46- :</span>), and doubtless prayed both for them, and with a view to the
	new manifestation which He was to give them of His glory.</p>
