<p><b>entered into a
	ship</b>—"<i>constrained</i>" to do so by their Master
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:22">Matthew 14:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45">Mark 6:45</span>),
	in order to put an end to the misdirected excitement in His favor
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:15">John 6:15</span>), into which the
	disciples themselves may have been somewhat drawn. The word
	"constrained" implies reluctance on their part, perhaps
	from unwillingness to part with their Master and embark at night,
	leaving Him alone on the mountain.

<p><b>went</b>—rather, "were

<p><b>toward Capernaum</b>—Mark

	Bethsaida," meaning "Bethsaida of Galilee" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45- :">Mark 6:45- :</span>), on the west side of the lake. The place they left was of
	the same name (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:45- :">Mark 6:45- :</span>).

<p><b>Jesus was not come to
	them</b>—They probably lingered in hopes of His still joining them,
	and so let the darkness come on.</p>
