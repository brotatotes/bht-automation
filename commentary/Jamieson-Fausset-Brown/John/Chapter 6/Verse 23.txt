<p><b>23. Howbeit,</b> c.—"Howbeit,"
	adds the Evangelist, in a lively parenthesis, "there came other
	boats from Tiberias" (which lay near the southwest coast of the
	lake), whose passengers were part of the multitude that had followed
	Jesus to the east side, and been miraculously fed these boats were
	fastened somewhere (says the Evangelist) 
	</p>
<p><b>nigh unto the place where
	they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks</b>—thus
	he refers to the glorious "miracle of the loaves"—and now
	they were put in requisition to convey the people back again to the
	west side. For when "the people saw that Jesus was not there,
	neither His disciples, they also took shipping [in these boats] and
	came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus."</p>
