26. Ye seek me, &c.—Jesus
	does not put them through their difficulty, says nothing of His
	treading on the waves of the sea, nor even notices their question,
	but takes advantage of the favorable moment for pointing out to them
	how forward, flippant, and superficial were their views, and how low
	their desires. "Ye seek Me not because ye saw the
	miracles"—literally, "the signs," that is,
	supernatural tokens of a higher presence, and a divine commission,
	"but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled."
	From this He proceeds at once to that other Bread, just as,
	with the woman of Samaria, to that other Water ( :-). We should have supposed all that follows to have been
	delivered by the wayside, or wherever they happened first to meet.
	But from John 6:59 we gather
	that they had probably met about the door of the synagogue—"for
	that was the day in which they assembled in their synagogues"
	[LIGHTFOOT]—and that on
	being asked, at the close of the service, if He had any word of
	exhortation to the people, He had taken the two breads, the perishing
	and the living bread, for the subject of His profound and
	extraordinary discourse.
