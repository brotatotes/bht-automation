<p><b>30. What sign showest thou,</b>
	c.â€”But how could they ask "a sign," when many of them
	scarce a day before had witnessed such a "sign" as had
	never till then been vouchsafed to men when after witnessing it, they
	could hardly be restrained from making Him a king; when they followed
	Him from the one side of the lake to the other; and when, in the
	opening words of this very discourse, He had chided them for seeking
	Him, "not because they <i>saw the signs,</i>" but for the
	loaves? The truth seems to be that they were confounded by the <i>novel
	claims</i> which our Lord had just advanced. In proposing to make Him
	a king, it was for far other purposes than dispensing to the world
	the bread of an everlasting life; and when He seemed to raise His
	claims even higher still, by representing it as the grand "work
	of God," that they should believe <i>on Himself</i> as His Sent
	One, they saw very clearly that He was making a demand upon them
	beyond anything they were prepared to accord to Him, and beyond all
	that man had ever before made. Hence their question, "What dost
	Thou <i>work?</i>"</p>
