<p><b>39. And this</b>—in the <i>first</i>
	place. 
	</p>
<p><b>is the will of Him that sent
	me, that of all</b>—everything. 
	</p>
<p><b>which He hath given
	Me</b>—(taking up the identical words of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>I should lose nothing, but
	should raise it up at the last day</b>—The meaning is not, of
	course, that He is charged to keep the objects entrusted to Him <i>as
	He received them,</i> so as they should merely suffer nothing in His
	hands. For as they were just "perishing" <i>sinners</i> of
	Adam's family, to let "nothing" of such "be lost,"
	but "raise them up at the last day," must involve, <i>first,</i>
	giving His flesh for them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), that they "might not perish, but have everlasting
	life"; and <i>then,</i> after "keeping them from falling,"
	raising their sleeping dust in incorruption and glory, and presenting
	them, body and soul, perfect and entire, wanting nothing, to Him who
	gave them to Him, saying, "Behold I and the children which God
	hath given Me." So much for the <i>first</i> will of Him that
	sent Him, the <i>divine</i> side of man's salvation, whose every
	stage and movement is inscrutable to us, but infallibly certain.</p>
