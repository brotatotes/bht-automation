<p><b>40. And this</b>—in the <i>second</i>
	place. 
	</p>
<p><b>is the will of Him that sent
	Me, that every one which seeth the Son and believeth on Him</b>—seeing
	the Son believeth on Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>may have everlasting life,

	side of the same thing as in the foregoing verse, and answering to
	"<i>Him that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out</i>";
	that is, I have it expressly in charge that everyone that so
	"beholdeth" (so vieweth) the Son as to believe on Him shall
	have everlasting life; and, that <i>none</i> of Him be lost, "I
	will raise him up at the last day." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
