<p><b>41-46. Jews murmured</b>—muttered,
	not in our Lord's hearing, but He knew it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:43">John 6:43</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+2:25">John 2:25</span>).

<p><b>he said, I am the bread,</b>
	&amp;c.—Missing the sense and glory of this, and having no relish
	for such sublimities, they harp upon the "Bread from heaven."
	"What can this mean? Do we not know all about Him—where, when,
	and of whom He was born? And yet He says He came down from heaven!"</p>
