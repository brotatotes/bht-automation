<p><b>46. Not that any man hath seen,</b>
	c.â€”Lest they should confound that "hearing and learning of the
	Father," to which believers are admitted by divine <i>teaching,</i>
	with His own immediate access to Him, He here throws in a
	parenthetical explanation stating, as explicitly as words could do
	it, how totally different the two cases were, and that only He who is
	"from God" hath this naked, immediate access to the Father.
