<p><b>51. I am,</b> c.—Understand, it is
	of MYSELF I now speak as
	the Bread from heaven of MEif
	a man eat he shall live for ever; and "THE
	BREAD WHICH I WILL GIVE IS MY
	FLESH, WHICH I WILL GIVE FOR THE
	LIFE OF THE WORLD." Here, for the first time in this high
	discourse, our Lord explicitly introduces His sacrificial <i>death</i>—for
	only rationalists can doubt this not only as that which constitutes
	Him the Bread of life to men, but as THAT very element IN
	HIM WHICH POSSESSES THE
	LIFE-GIVING VIRTUE.—"From this time we hear no more (in
	this discourse) of "Bread"; this figure is dropped, and the
	reality takes its place" [STIER].
	The words "I will <i>give</i>" may be compared with the
	words of institution at the Supper, "This is My body which is
	<i>given</i> for you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), or in Paul's report of it, "<i>broken</i> for you"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+11:24">1 Corinthians 11:24</span>).</p>
