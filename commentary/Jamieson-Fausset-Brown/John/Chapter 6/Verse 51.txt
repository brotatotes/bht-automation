51. I am, c.—Understand, it is
	of MYSELF I now speak as
	the Bread from heaven of MEif
	a man eat he shall live for ever; and "THE
	BREAD WHICH I WILL GIVE IS MY
	FLESH, WHICH I WILL GIVE FOR THE
	LIFE OF THE WORLD." Here, for the first time in this high
	discourse, our Lord explicitly introduces His sacrificial death—for
	only rationalists can doubt this not only as that which constitutes
	Him the Bread of life to men, but as THAT very element IN
	HIM WHICH POSSESSES THE
	LIFE-GIVING VIRTUE.—"From this time we hear no more (in
	this discourse) of "Bread"; this figure is dropped, and the
	reality takes its place" [STIER].
	The words "I will give" may be compared with the
	words of institution at the Supper, "This is My body which is
	given for you" ( :-), or in Paul's report of it, "broken for you"
	(1 Corinthians 11:24).
