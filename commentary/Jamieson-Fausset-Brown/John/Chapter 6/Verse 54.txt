<p><b>54. Whoso eateth . . . hath,</b>
	c.—The former verse said that <i>unless</i> they partook of Him
	they had no life this adds, that <i>whoever</i> does so "hath
	eternal life." 
	</p>
<p><b>and I will raise him up at
	the last day</b>—For the <i>fourth</i> time this is repeated (see
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:39">John 6:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:40">John 6:40</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:44">John 6:44</span>) —showing most clearly
	that the "eternal life" which such a man "<i>hath</i>"
	cannot be the same with the <i>future</i> resurrection life from
	which it is carefully distinguished each time, but a life
	communicated <i>here below</i> immediately on believing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:36">John 3:36</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:25">John 5:25</span>);
	and giving to <i>the resurrection of the body</i> as that which
	consummates the redemption <i>of the entire man,</i> a prominence
	which in the current theology, it is to be feared, it has seldom had.
	(See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:1-58">1 Corinthians 15:1-58</span>,
