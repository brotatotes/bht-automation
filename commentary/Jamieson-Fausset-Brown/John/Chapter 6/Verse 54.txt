54. Whoso eateth . . . hath,
	c.—The former verse said that unless they partook of Him
	they had no life this adds, that whoever does so "hath
	eternal life." 
	and I will raise him up at
	the last day—For the fourth time this is repeated (see
	John 6:39; John 6:40;
	John 6:44) —showing most clearly
	that the "eternal life" which such a man "hath"
	cannot be the same with the future resurrection life from
	which it is carefully distinguished each time, but a life
	communicated here below immediately on believing (John 3:36;
	John 5:24; John 5:25);
	and giving to the resurrection of the body as that which
	consummates the redemption of the entire man, a prominence
	which in the current theology, it is to be feared, it has seldom had.
	(See Romans 8:23; 1 Corinthians 15:1-58,
	throughout).
