58. This is that bread, &c.—a
	sort of summing up of the whole discourse, on which let this one
	further remark suffice—that as our Lord, instead of softening down
	His figurative sublimities, or even putting them in naked
	phraseology, leaves the great truths of His Person and Office, and
	our participation of Him and it, enshrined for all time in those
	glorious forms of speech, so when we attempt to strip the truth of
	these figures, figures though they be, it goes away from us, like
	water when the vessel is broken, and our wisdom lies in raising our
	own spirit, and attuning our own ear, to our Lord's chosen modes of
	expression. (It should be added that although this discourse has
	nothing to do with the Sacrament of the Supper, the Sacrament has
	everything to do with it, as the visible embodiment of these
	figures, and, to the believing partaker, a real, yea, and the
	most lively and affecting participation of His flesh and blood, and
	nourishment thereby of the spiritual and eternal life, here below).
