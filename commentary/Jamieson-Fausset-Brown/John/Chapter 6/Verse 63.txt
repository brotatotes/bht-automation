<p><b>63. the flesh profiteth nothing</b>—Much
	of His discourse was <i>about</i> "flesh"; but flesh as
	such, mere flesh, could profit nothing, much less impart that <i>life</i>
	which the Holy Spirit alone communicates to the soul.

<p><b>the words that I speak . . .
	are spirit and . . . life</b>—The whole burden of the discourse is
	"<i>spirit,</i>" not mere flesh, and "<i>life</i>"
	in its highest, not its lowest sense, and the words I have employed
	are to be interpreted solely in that sense.</p>
