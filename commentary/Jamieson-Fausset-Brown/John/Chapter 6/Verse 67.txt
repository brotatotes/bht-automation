	away?</b>—Affecting appeal! Evidently Christ <i>felt</i> the
	desertion of Him even by those miserable men who could not abide His
	statements; and seeing a disturbance even of the <i>wheat</i> by the
	violence of the wind which blew away the <i>chaff</i> (not yet
	visibly showing itself, but open to His eyes of fire), He would <i>nip
	it in the bud</i> by this home question.</p>
