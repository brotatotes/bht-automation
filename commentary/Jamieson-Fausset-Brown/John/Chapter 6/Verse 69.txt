<p><b>69. And we believe,</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Peter seems to have added this not merely—probably not
	so much—as an assurance <i>to his Lord</i> of his heart's belief in
	Him, as for the purpose of fortifying <i>himself</i> and his faithful
	brethren against that <i>recoil</i> from his Lord's harsh statements
	which he was probably struggling against with difficulty at that
	moment. <i>Note.</i>—There are seasons when one's faith is tried to
	the utmost, particularly by speculative difficulties; the spiritual
	eye then swims, and all truth seems ready to depart from us. At such
	seasons, a clear perception that to abandon the faith of Christ is <i>to
	face black desolation, ruin and death;</i> and on recoiling from
	this, to be able to fall back, not merely on <i>first principles and
	immovable foundations,</i> but on <i>personal experience of a Living
	Lord in whom all truth is wrapt up and made flesh for our very
	benefit</i>—this is a relief unspeakable. Under that blessed Wing
	taking shelter, until we are again fit to grapple with the questions
	that have staggered us, we at length either find our way through
	them, or attain to a calm satisfaction in the discovery that they lie
	beyond the limits of present apprehension.</p>
