28, 29. cried Jesus—in a
	louder tone, and more solemn, witnessing style than usual. 
	Ye both, &c.—that
	is, "Yes, ye know both Myself and My local parentage, and (yet)
	I am not come of Myself." 
	but he that sent me is true,
	&c.—Probably the meaning is, "He that sent Me is the only
	real Sender of any one."
