<p><b>28, 29. cried Jesus</b>—in a
	louder tone, and more solemn, witnessing style than usual. 
	</p>
<p><b>Ye both,</b> &amp;c.—that
	is, "Yes, ye know both Myself and My local parentage, and (yet)
	I am not come of Myself." 
	</p>
<p><b>but he that sent me is true,</b>
	&amp;c.—Probably the meaning is, "He that sent Me is the only
	<i>real</i> Sender of any one."</p>
