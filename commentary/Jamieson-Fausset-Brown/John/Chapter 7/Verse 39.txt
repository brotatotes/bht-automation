<p><b>39. this spake he of the Spirit</b>—who,
	by His direct personal agency, opens up this spring of living waters
	in the human spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:6">John 3:6</span>),
	and by His indwelling in the renewed soul ensures their <i>unfailing
	flow.</i>
</p>
<p><b>they that believe,</b> &amp;c.—As
	the Holy Ghost is, in the redemption of man, entirely <i>at the
	service of Christ,</i> as His Agent, so it is <i>only in believing
	connection with Christ</i> that any one "receives" the
	Spirit.

<p><b>for the Holy Ghost was not
	yet </b><i><b>given</b></i><b> </b>—Beyond all doubt the word
	"given," or some similar word, is the right supplement. In
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:7">John 16:7</span> the Holy Ghost is
	represented not only as the <i>gift of Christ,</i> but a gift the
	communication of which was <i>dependent upon His own departure to the
	Father.</i> Now as Christ was <i>not yet gone,</i> so the Holy Ghost
	<i>was not yet given.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Jesus not yet glorified</b>—The
	word "<i>glorified</i>" is here used advisedly, to teach
	the reader not only that the <i>departure</i> of Christ to the Father
	was <i>indispensable</i> to the giving of the Spirit, but that this
	illustrious Gift, direct from the hands of the ascended Saviour, was
	God's intimation to the world that He whom it had cast out,
	crucified, and slain, was "His Elect, in whom His soul
	delighted," and that it was through the smiting of that Rock
	that the waters of the Spirit—for which the Church was waiting, and
	with pomp at the feast of tabernacles proclaiming its expectation—had
	gushed forth upon a thirsty world.</p>
