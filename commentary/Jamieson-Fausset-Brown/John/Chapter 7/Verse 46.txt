<p><b>46. Never man spake like this
	man</b>â€”Noble testimony of unsophisticated men! Doubtless they were
	strangers to the profound intent of Christ's teaching, but there was
	that in it which by its mysterious grandeur and transparent purity
	and grace, held them spellbound. No doubt it was of God that they
	should so feel, that their arm might be paralyzed, as Christ's hour
	was not yet come; but even in human teaching there has sometimes been
	felt such a divine power, that men who came to kill them (for
	example, ROWLAND HISS)
	have confessed to all that they were unmanned.</p>
