<p><b>49. But this people</b>—literally,
	"multitude," meaning the <i>ignorant rabble.</i> (Pity
	these important distinctions, so marked in the original of this
	Gospel, should not be also in our version.) 
	</p>
<p><b>knoweth not the law</b>—that
	is, by school learning, which only subverted it by human traditions. 
	</p>
<p><b>are cursed</b>—a cursed set
	(a kind of swearing at them, out of mingled rage and scorn).</p>
