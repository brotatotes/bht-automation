<p><b>6-10. My time is not yet come</b>—that
	is, for showing Himself to the world. 
	</p>
<p><b>your time is always
	ready</b>—that is "It matters little when we go up, for ye
	have no great plans in life, and nothing hangs upon your movements.
	With Me it is otherwise; on every movement of Mine there hangs what
	ye know not. The world has no quarrel with you, for ye bear no
	testimony against it, and so draw down upon yourselves none of its
	wrath; but I am here to lift up My voice against its hypocrisy, and
	denounce its abominations; therefore it cannot endure Me, and one
	false step might precipitate its fury on its Victim's head before the
	time. Away, therefore, to the feast as soon as it suits you; I follow
	at the fitting moment, but 'My time is not yet full come.'"</p>
