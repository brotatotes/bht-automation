<p><b>1, 2. Jesus went unto the Mount of
	Olives</b>â€”This should have formed the last verse of the foregoing
	chapter. "The return of the people to the inert quiet and
	security of their <i>dwellings</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), at the close of the feast, is designedly contrasted with
	our Lord's <i>homeless</i> way, so to speak, of spending the short
	night, who is early in the morning on the scene again. One cannot
	well see why what is recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:37">Luke 21:37</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:38">Luke 21:38</span> may not even thus early
	have taken place; it might have been the Lord's ordinary custom from
	the beginning to leave the brilliant misery of the city every night,
	that so He might compose His sorrowful and interceding heart, and
	collect His energies for new labors of love; preferring for His
	resting-place Bethany, and the <i>Mount of Olives,</i> the scene thus
	consecrated by many preparatory prayers for His final humiliation and
	exaltation" [STIER].</p>
