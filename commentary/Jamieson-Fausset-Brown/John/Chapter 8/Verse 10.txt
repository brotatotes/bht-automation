10. Woman, c.—What inimitable
	tenderness and grace! Conscious of her own guilt, and till now in the
	hands of men who had talked of stoning her, wondering at the skill
	with which her accusers had been dispersed, and the grace of
	the few words addressed to herself, she would be disposed to listen,
	with a reverence and teachableness before unknown, to our Lord's
	admonition. "And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee,
	go and sin no more." He pronounces no pardon upon the woman
	(such as, "Thy sins are forgiven thee" [compare Luke 5:28
Luke 7:48] —"Go in peace"
	[compare Mark 5:34; Luke 7:50;
	Luke 8:48]), much less does He say
	that she had done nothing condemnable; He simply leaves the matter
	where it was. He meddles not with the magistrate's office, nor acts
	the Judge in any sense (Luke 8:48- :). But in saying, "Go and sin no more," which had
	been before said to one who undoubtedly believed (Luke 8:48- :), more is probably implied than expressed. If brought
	suddenly to conviction of sin, admiration of her Deliverer, and a
	willingness to be admonished and guided by Him, this call to begin a
	new life may have carried with it what would ensure and naturally
	bring about a permanent change. (This whole narrative is wanting in
	some of the earliest and most valuable manuscripts, and those which
	have it vary to some extent. The internal evidence in its favor is
	almost overpowering. It is easy to account for its omission,
	though genuine; but if not so, it is next to impossible to account
	for its insertion).
