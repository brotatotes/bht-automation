24. if ye believe not that I am he,
	ye shall die in your sinsâ€”They knew well enough what He meant
	(Mark 13:6, Greek; compare
	Matthew 24:5). But He would not, by
	speaking it out, give them the materials for a charge for which they
	were watching. At the same time, one is irresistibly reminded by such
	language, so far transcending what is becoming in men, of
	those ancient declarations of the God of Israel, "I AM
	HE" (Deuteronomy 32:39;
	Isaiah 43:10; Isaiah 43:13;
	Isaiah 46:4; Isaiah 48:12).
	See on John 6:20.
