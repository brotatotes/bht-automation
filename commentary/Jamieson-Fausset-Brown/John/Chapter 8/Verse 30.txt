<p><b>30. As he spake these words, many
	believed on him</b>—Instead of wondering at this, the wonder would
	be if words of such unearthly, surpassing grandeur <i>could</i> be
	uttered without captivating <i>some</i> that heard them. And just as
	"all that sat in the council" to try Stephen "<i>saw
	his face</i>"—though expecting nothing but death—"<i>as
	it had been the face of an angel</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), so may we suppose that, full of the sweet supporting sense
	of His Father's presence, amidst the rage and scorn of the rulers, a
	divine benignity beamed from His countenance, irradiated the words
	that fell from Him, and won over the candid "many" of His
	audience.</p>
