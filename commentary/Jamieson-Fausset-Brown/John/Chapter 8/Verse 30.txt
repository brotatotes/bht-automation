	believed on him—Instead of wondering at this, the wonder would
	be if words of such unearthly, surpassing grandeur could be
	uttered without captivating some that heard them. And just as
	"all that sat in the council" to try Stephen "saw
	his face"—though expecting nothing but death—"as
	it had been the face of an angel" ( :-), so may we suppose that, full of the sweet supporting sense
	of His Father's presence, amidst the rage and scorn of the rulers, a
	divine benignity beamed from His countenance, irradiated the words
	that fell from Him, and won over the candid "many" of His
	audience.
