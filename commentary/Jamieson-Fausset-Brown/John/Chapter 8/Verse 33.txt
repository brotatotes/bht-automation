<p><b>33. They answered him, We be
	Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man,</b> c.—Who
	said this? Not surely the very class just spoken of as won over by
	His divine words, and exhorted to continue in them. Most interpreters
	seem to think so but it is hard to ascribe such a petulant speech to
	the newly gained disciples, even in the lowest sense, much less
	persons <i>so</i> gained as they were. It came, probably, from
	persons mixed up with them in the same part of the crowd, but of a
	very different spirit. The <i>pride</i> of the Jewish nation, even
	now after centuries of humiliation, is the most striking feature of
	their character. "Talk of freedom to <i>us?</i> Pray when or to
	whom were we ever in bondage?" This bluster sounds almost
	ludicrous from such a nation. Had they forgotten their long and
	bitter bondage in Egypt? their dreary captivity in Babylon? their
	present bondage to the Roman yoke, and their restless eagerness to
	throw it off? But probably they saw that our Lord pointed to
	something else—freedom, perhaps, from the leaders of sects or
	parties—and were not willing to allow their subjection even to
	these. Our Lord, therefore, though He knew what slaves they were in
	this sense, drives the ploughshare somewhat deeper than this, to a
	bondage they little dreamt of.</p>
