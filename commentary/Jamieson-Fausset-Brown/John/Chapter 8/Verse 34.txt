<p><b>34, 35. Whosoever committeth
	sin</b>—that is, <i>liveth in the commission</i> of it—(Compare

<p><b>is the servant of sin</b>—that
	is, the <i>bond-servant,</i> or <i>slave</i> of it; for the question
	is not about free service, but who are in <i>bondage.</i> (Compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:19">2 Peter 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:16">Revelation 6:16</span>).
	The great truth here expressed was not unknown to heathen moralists;
	but it was applied only to vice, for they were total strangers to
	what in revealed religion is called <i>sin.</i> The thought of <i>slaves</i>
	and <i>freemen</i> in the house suggests to our Lord a wider idea.</p>
