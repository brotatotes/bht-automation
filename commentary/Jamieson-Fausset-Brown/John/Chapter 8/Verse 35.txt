<p><b>35. And the servant abideth not in
	the house for ever, but the Son abideth ever</b>â€”that is, "And
	if your connection with the family of God be that of BOND-SERVANTS,
	ye have no <i>natural tie</i> to the house; your tie is essentially
	<i>uncertain and precarious.</i> But the SON'S
	relationship to the FATHER
	is a <i>natural and essential</i> one; it is an indefeasible tie; His
	abode in it is <i>perpetual</i> and <i>of right:</i> That is My
	relationship, My tie: If, then, ye would have your connection with
	God's family made <i>real, rightful, permanent,</i> ye must by the
	Son be <i>manumitted</i> and <i>adopted</i> as sons and daughters of
	the Lord Almighty." In this sublime statement there is no doubt
	a <i>subordinate</i> allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "<i>Cast out</i> this <i>bondwoman and her son,</i>
	for <i>the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son,</i>
	with Isaac." (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
