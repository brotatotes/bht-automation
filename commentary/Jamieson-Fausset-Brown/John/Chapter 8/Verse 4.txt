<p><b>4, 5. woman . . . in adultery . . .
	Moses . . . commanded . . . should be stoned</b>—simply put to
	death (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+22:22">Deuteronomy 22:22</span>), but in
	aggravated cases, at least in later times, this was probably by
	stoning (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:40">Ezekiel 16:40</span>).

<p><b>but what sayest thou</b>—hoping,
	whatever He might answer, to put Him in the wrong:—if He said,
	Stone her, that would seem a stepping out of His province; if He
	forbade it, that would hold Him up as a relaxer of the public morals.
	But these cunning hypocrites were overmatched.</p>
