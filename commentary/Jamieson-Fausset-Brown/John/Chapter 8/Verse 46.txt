<p><b>46. Which of you convinceth me of
	sin</b>â€”"Convicteth," bringeth home a charge of sin.
	Glorious dilemma! "Convict Me of sin, and reject Me: If not, why
	stand ye out against My claims?" Of course, they could only be
	supposed to impeach His <i>life;</i> but in One who had already
	passed through unparalleled complications, and had continually to
	deal with friends and foes of every sort and degree, such a challenge
	thrown wide among His bitterest enemies, can amount to nothing short
	of a claim to <i>absolute sinlessness.</i></p>
