48-51. Say we not well that thou art
	a Samaritan, and hast a devil?—What intense and virulent scorn!
	(See Hebrews 12:3). The "say
	we not well" refers to Hebrews 12:3- :. "A Samaritan" means more than "no Israelite
	at all"; it means one who pretended, but had no manner of
	claim to the title—retorting perhaps, this denial of their true
	descent from Abraham.
