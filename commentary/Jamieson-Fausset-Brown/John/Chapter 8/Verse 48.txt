<p><b>48-51. Say we not well that thou art
	a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</b>—What intense and virulent scorn!
	(See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:3">Hebrews 12:3</span>). The "say
	we not well" refers to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:3- :">Hebrews 12:3- :</span>. "A Samaritan" means more than "no Israelite
	at all"; it means one who <i>pretended, but had no manner of
	claim</i> to the title—retorting perhaps, this denial of their <i>true</i>
	descent from Abraham.</p>
