<p><b>49. Jesus answered, I have not a
	devil</b>—What calm dignity is here! Verily, "when reviled, He
	reviled not again" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:23">1 Peter 2:23</span>).
	Compare Paul (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:25">Acts 26:25</span>), "I
	am not mad," c. He adds not, "Nor am I a Samaritan,"
	that He might not even seem to partake of their contempt for a race
	that had already welcomed Him as the Christ, and began to be blessed
	by Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>I honour my Father, and ye do
	dishonour me</b>—the language of <i>wounded feeling.</i> But the
	<i>interior</i> of His soul at such moments is only to be seen in
	such prophetic utterances as these, "For thy sake I have borne
	reproach shame hath covered my face; I am become a <i>stranger</i>
	unto my brethren, an alien unto my mother's children. For the zeal of
	thine house hath eaten me up, and <i>the reproaches of them that</i>
	reproached thee are fallen upon me" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+26:25- :">Acts 26:25- :</span>).</p>
