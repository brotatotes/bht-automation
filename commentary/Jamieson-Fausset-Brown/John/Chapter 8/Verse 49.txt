	devil—What calm dignity is here! Verily, "when reviled, He
	reviled not again" (1 Peter 2:23).

	am not mad," c. He adds not, "Nor am I a Samaritan,"

	interior of His soul at such moments is only to be seen in
	such prophetic utterances as these, "For thy sake I have borne
	reproach shame hath covered my face; I am become a stranger
	unto my brethren, an alien unto my mother's children. For the zeal of
	thine house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that
	reproached thee are fallen upon me" (Acts 26:25- :).
