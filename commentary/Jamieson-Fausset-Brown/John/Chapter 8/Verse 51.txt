<p><b>51. If a man keep my saying, he
	shall never see death</b>â€”Partly thus vindicating His lofty claims
	as Lord of the kingdom of life everlasting, and, at the same time,
	holding out even to His revilers the scepter of grace. The word
	"<i>keep</i>" is in harmony with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "If ye <i>continue</i> in My word," expressing
	the permanency, as a living and paramount principle, of that faith to
	which He referred: "<i>never see death,</i>" though
	virtually uttered before (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:24">John 5:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:40">John 6:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:47">John 6:47</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51">John 6:51</span>), is the strongest and
	most naked statement of a very glorious truth yet given. (In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:51- :">John 6:51- :</span> it is repeated in nearly identical terms).</p>
