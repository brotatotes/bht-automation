56. Abraham rejoiced to see my day,
	&c.—exulted, or exceedingly rejoiced that he should see, he
	exulted to see it, that is, by anticipation. Nay, 
	he saw it,
	and was glad—he actually beheld it,
	to his joy. If this mean no more than that he had a prophetic
	foresight of the gospel-day—the second clause just repeating the
	first—how could the Jews understand our Lord to mean that He "had
	seen Abraham?" And if it mean that Abraham was then
	beholding, in his disembodied spirit, the incarnate Messiah
	[STIER, ALFORD,
	&c.], the words seem very unsuitable to express it. It expresses
	something past—"he saw My day, and was
	glad," that is, surely while he lived. He seems to refer
	to the familiar intercourse which Abraham had with God, who is
	once and again in the history called "the Angel of the Lord,"
	and whom Christ here identifies with Himself. On those occasions,
	Abraham "saw ME" (OLSHAUSEN,
	though he thinks the reference is to some unrecorded scene). If this
	be the meaning, all that follows is quite natural.
