<p><b>18-23. the Jews did not believe . .

	that had received his sight</b>—Foiled by the testimony of the
	young man himself, they hope to throw doubt on the fact by close
	questioning his parents, who, perceiving the snare laid for them,
	ingeniously escape it by testifying simply to the identity of their
	son, and his birth-blindness, leaving it to himself, as a competent
	witness, to speak as to the cure. They prevaricated, however, in
	saying they "knew not who had opened his eyes," for "they
	feared the Jews," who had come to an understanding (probably
	after what is recorded, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:50">John 7:50</span>,
	c. but by this time well known), that whoever owned Him as the Christ
	would be put out of the synagogue—that is, not simply <i>excluded,</i>
	but <i>excommunicated.</i></p>
