31. they cast him out—judicially,
	no doubt, as well in fact. The allusion to his being "born in
	sins" seems a tacit admission of his being blind from birth—the
	very thing they had been so unwilling to own. But rage and enmity to
	truth are seldom consistent in their outbreaks. The friends of this
	excommunicated youth, crowding around him with their sympathy, would
	probably express surprise that One who could work such a cure should
	be unable to protect his patient from the persecution it had raised
	against him, or should possess the power without using it. Nor would
	it be strange if such thoughts should arise in the youth's own mind.
	But if they did, it is certain, from what follows, that they made no
	lodgment there, conscious as he was that "whereas he was blind,
	now he saw," and satisfied that if his Benefactor "were not
	of God, He could do nothing" ( :-). There was a word for him too, which, if whispered in his
	ear from the oracles of God, would seem expressly designed to
	describe his case, and prepare him for the coming interview with his
	gracious Friend. "Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at
	His word. Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for My
	name's sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified; BUT
	HE SHALL APPEAR TO YOUR JOY,
	and they shall be ashamed" ( :-). But how was He engaged to whom such noble testimony had
	been given, and for whom such persecution had been borne? Uttering,
	perhaps, in secret, "with strong crying and tears," the
	words of the prophetic psalm, "Let not them that wait on Thee, O
	Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake; let none that seek Thee be
	confounded for my sake, O God of Israel; because for Thy sake I have
	borne reproach . . . and the reproaches of them that reproached Thee
	are fallen upon me" (Psalms 69:6;
	Psalms 69:7; Psalms 69:9).
