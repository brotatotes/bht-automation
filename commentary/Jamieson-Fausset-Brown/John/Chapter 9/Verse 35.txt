35-38. Jesus heard—that is, by
	intelligence brought Him. 
	that they had cast him out;
	and when he had found him—by accident? Not very likely.
	Sympathy in that breast could not long keep aloof from its object. 
	he said unto him, Dost thou
	believe on the Son of God?—A question stretching purposely
	beyond his present attainments, in order the more quickly to lead
	him—in his present teachable frame—into the highest truth.
