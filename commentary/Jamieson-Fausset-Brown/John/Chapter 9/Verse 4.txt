4. I must work the works of him that
	sent me, c.—a most interesting statement from the mouth of
	Christ intimating, (1) that He had a precise work to do upon earth,
	with every particular of it arranged and laid out to Him; (2) that
	all He did upon earth was just "the works of God"—particularly
	"going about doing good," though not exclusively by
	miracles; (3) that each work had its precise time and place
	in His programme of instructions, so to speak; hence, (4) that as His
	period for work had definite termination, so by letting any one
	service pass by its allotted time, the whole would be disarranged,
	marred, and driven beyond its destined period for completion; (5)
	that He acted ever under the impulse of these considerations, as
	man—"the night cometh when no man (or no one) can work."
	What lessons are here for others, and what encouragement from such
	Example!
