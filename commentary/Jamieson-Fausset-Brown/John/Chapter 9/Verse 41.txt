<p><b>41. If ye were blind</b>—wanted
	light to discern My claims, and only waited to receive it. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye should have no sin</b>—none
	of the guilt of shutting out the light. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye say, We see; therefore
	your sin remaineth</b>—Your claim to possess light, while rejecting
	Me, is that which seals you up in the guilt of unbelief.</p>
