	action was purely symbolical in its design, so in connection with it
	the Evangelist notices the symbolical name of the pool as in this
	case bearing testimony to him who was <i>sent</i> to do what it only
	<i>symbolized.</i> (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+8:6">Isaiah 8:6</span>,
	where this same pool is used figuratively to denote "the streams
	that make glad the city of God," and which, humble though they
	be, betoken <i>a present God of Israel</i>.)</p>
