<p style=" "><b>servant
	of Jesus Christ</b>
	— as His minister and apostle.</p>
<p style=" "><b>brother
	of James</b>
	— who was more widely known as bishop of Jerusalem and “brother
	of the Lord” (that is, either <i>cousin,</i>
	or stepbrother, being son of Joseph by a former marriage; for ancient
	traditions universally agree that Mary, Jesus’ mother, continued
	perpetually a virgin). Jude therefore calls himself modestly “brother
	of James.” See my Introduction.</p>
<p style=" "><b>to
	them ... sanctified by God the Father</b>
	— The oldest manuscripts and versions, Origen, Lucifer, and others
	read, “beloved” for <i>sanctified.</i>
	If <i>English
	Version</i>
	be read, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.
	The <i>Greek</i>
	is not “by,” but “in.” God the Father’s <i>love</i>
	is the element IN which they are “beloved.” Thus the conclusion,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	corresponds, “Keep yourselves <i>in</i>
	the love of God.” Compare “beloved of the Lord” <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>preserved
	in Jesus Christ</b>
	— “kept.” Translate not “in,” but as <i>Greek,</i>
	“FOR Jesus Christ.” “Kept <i>continually</i>
	(so the <i>Greek
	perfect</i>
	participle means) by God the Father for Jesus Christ,” against the
	day of His coming. Jude, beforehand, mentions the source and
	guarantee for the final accomplishment of believers’ salvation;
	lest they should be disheartened by the dreadful evils which he
	proceeds to announce [Bengel].</p>
<p style=" "><i><b>and</b></i><b>
	called</b>
	— predicated of “them that are beloved in God the Father, and
	preserved in Jesus Christ: who are called.” God’s effectual
	<i>calling</i>
	in the exercise of His divine prerogative, guarantees their eternal
	safety.</p>
