servant
	of Jesus Christ
	— as His minister and apostle.brother
	of James
	— who was more widely known as bishop of Jerusalem and “brother
	of the Lord” (that is, either cousin,
	or stepbrother, being son of Joseph by a former marriage; for ancient
	traditions universally agree that Mary, Jesus’ mother, continued
	perpetually a virgin). Jude therefore calls himself modestly “brother
	of James.” See my Introduction.to
	them ... sanctified by God the Father
	— The oldest manuscripts and versions, Origen, Lucifer, and others
	read, “beloved” for sanctified.

	 :-.
	The Greek
	is not “by,” but “in.” God the Father’s love
	is the element IN which they are “beloved.” Thus the conclusion,
	 :-,
	corresponds, “Keep yourselves in
	the love of God.” Compare “beloved of the Lord”  :-.preserved
	in Jesus Christ
	— “kept.” Translate not “in,” but as Greek,
	“FOR Jesus Christ.” “Kept continually
	(so the Greek
	perfect
	participle means) by God the Father for Jesus Christ,” against the
	day of His coming. Jude, beforehand, mentions the source and
	guarantee for the final accomplishment of believers’ salvation;
	lest they should be disheartened by the dreadful evils which he
	proceeds to announce [Bengel].and
	called
	— predicated of “them that are beloved in God the Father, and
	preserved in Jesus Christ: who are called.” God’s effectual
	calling
	in the exercise of His divine prerogative, guarantees their eternal
	safety.
