<p style=" "><b>those

	— <i>Greek,</i>
	“all things <i>whatsoever</i>
	they <i>understand
	not,</i>”
	namely, the things of the spiritual world.</p>
<p style=" "><b>but
	what ... naturally</b>
	— Connect thus, “<i>Whatever</i>
	(so the <i>Greek</i>)
	things naturally (by natural, blind instinct), as the unreasoning (so
	the <i>Greek</i>)
	animals, they know,” etc. The <i>Greek</i>
	for the former “know” implies deeper knowledge; the latter
	“know,” the mere
	perception of the “animal senses and faculties.”</p>
