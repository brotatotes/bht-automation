<p style=" "><b>Woe</b>
	— See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	“<i>cursed</i>
	children.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>Cain</b>
	— the murderer: the root of whose sin was hatred and envy of the
	godly, as it is the sin of these seducers.</p>
<p style=" "><b>ran
	greedily</b>
	— literally, “have been poured forth” like a torrent that has
	burst its banks. Reckless of what it costs, the loss of God’s favor
	and heaven, on they rush after gain like Balaam.</p>
<p style=" "><b>perished
	in the gainsaying of Core</b>
	— (compare <i>Note,</i>
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	When we read of Korah perishing by gainsaying, we read virtually also
	of these perishing in like manner through the same: for the same seed
	bears the same harvest.</p>
