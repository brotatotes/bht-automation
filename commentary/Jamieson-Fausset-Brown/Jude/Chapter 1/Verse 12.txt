<p style=" "><b>spots</b>
	— So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	<i>Greek,</i>
	“spiloi”;
	but here the <i>Greek</i>
	is spilades,
	which elsewhere, in secular writers, means <i>rocks,</i>
	namely, on which the Christian <i>love-feasts</i>
	were in danger of being shipwrecked. The oldest manuscript prefixes
	the article emphatically, “THE rocks.” The reference to “clouds
	... winds ... waves of the sea,” accords with this image of <i>rocks.
	Vulgate</i>
	seems to have been misled by the similar sounding word to translate,
	as <i>English
	Version,</i>
	“spots”; compare however, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	which favors <i>English
	Version,</i>
	if the <i>Greek</i>
	will bear it. Two oldest manuscripts, by the transcriber’s effort
	to make Jude say the same as Peter, read here “deceivings” for
	“love-feasts,” but the weightiest manuscript and authorities
	support <i>English
	Version</i>
	reading. The love-feast accompanied the Lord’s Supper (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	end). Korah the Levite, not satisfied with his <i>ministry,</i>
	aspired to the <i>sacrificing
	priesthood</i>
	also: so ministers in the Lord’s Supper have sought to make it a
	<i>sacrifice,</i>
	and themselves the <i>sacrificing</i>
	priests, usurping the function of our only Christian sacerdotal
	<i>Priest,</i>
	Christ Jesus. Let them beware of Korah’s doom!</p>
<p style=" "><b>feeding
	themselves</b>
	— <i>Greek,</i>
	“pasturing (tending) themselves.” What they look to is the
	pampering of <i>themselves,</i>
	not the feeding of the flock.</p>
<p style=" "><b>without
	fear</b>
	— Join these words not as <i>English
	Version,</i>
	but with “feast.” Sacred feasts especially ought to be celebrated
	<i>with
	fear.</i>
	Feasting is not faulty in itself [Bengel], but it needs to be
	accompanied with <i>fear</i>
	of forgetting God, as Job in the case of his sons’ feasts.</p>
<p style=" "><b>clouds</b>
	— from which one would expect refreshing rains. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	“wells without water.” Professors without practice.</p>
<p style=" "><b>carried
	about</b>
	— The oldest manuscripts have “carried aside,” that is, out of
	the right course (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
<p style=" "><b>trees
	whose fruit withereth</b>
	— rather, “trees of the late (or <i>waning</i>)
	autumn,” namely, when there are no longer leaves or fruits on the
	trees [Bengel].</p>
<p style=" "><b>without
	fruit</b>
	— having no good fruit of knowledge and practice; sometimes used of
	what is positively <i>bad.</i></p>
<p style=" "><b>twice
	dead</b>
	— First when they cast their leaves in autumn, and seem during
	winter <i>dead,</i>
	but revive again in spring; secondly, when they are “plucked up by
	the roots.” So these apostates, once dead in unbelief, and then by
	profession and baptism raised from the death of sin to the life of
	righteousness, but now having become <i>dead
	again</i>
	by apostasy, and so <i>hopelessly
	dead.</i>
	There is a climax. Not only <i>without
	leaves,</i>
	like <i>trees
	in late autumn,</i>
	but <i>without
	fruit:</i>
	not only so, but dead twice; and to crown all, “plucked up by the
	roots.”</p>
