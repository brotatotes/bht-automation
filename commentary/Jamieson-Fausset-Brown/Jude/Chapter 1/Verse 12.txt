spots
	— So  :-,
	Greek,
	“spiloi”;
	but here the Greek
	is spilades,
	which elsewhere, in secular writers, means rocks,
	namely, on which the Christian love-feasts
	were in danger of being shipwrecked. The oldest manuscript prefixes
	the article emphatically, “THE rocks.” The reference to “clouds
	... winds ... waves of the sea,” accords with this image of rocks.
	Vulgate
	seems to have been misled by the similar sounding word to translate,
	as English
	Version,
	“spots”; compare however,  :-,
	which favors English
	Version,
	if the Greek
	will bear it. Two oldest manuscripts, by the transcriber’s effort
	to make Jude say the same as Peter, read here “deceivings” for
	“love-feasts,” but the weightiest manuscript and authorities
	support English
	Version
	reading. The love-feast accompanied the Lord’s Supper ( :-,
	end). Korah the Levite, not satisfied with his ministry,
	aspired to the sacrificing
	priesthood
	also: so ministers in the Lord’s Supper have sought to make it a
	sacrifice,
	and themselves the sacrificing
	priests, usurping the function of our only Christian sacerdotal
	Priest,
	Christ Jesus. Let them beware of Korah’s doom!feeding
	themselves
	— Greek,
	“pasturing (tending) themselves.” What they look to is the
	pampering of themselves,
	not the feeding of the flock.without
	fear
	— Join these words not as English
	Version,
	but with “feast.” Sacred feasts especially ought to be celebrated
	with
	fear.
	Feasting is not faulty in itself [Bengel], but it needs to be
	accompanied with fear
	of forgetting God, as Job in the case of his sons’ feasts.clouds
	— from which one would expect refreshing rains.  :-,
	“wells without water.” Professors without practice.carried
	about
	— The oldest manuscripts have “carried aside,” that is, out of
	the right course (compare  :-).trees
	whose fruit withereth
	— rather, “trees of the late (or waning)
	autumn,” namely, when there are no longer leaves or fruits on the
	trees [Bengel].without
	fruit
	— having no good fruit of knowledge and practice; sometimes used of
	what is positively bad.twice
	dead
	— First when they cast their leaves in autumn, and seem during
	winter dead,
	but revive again in spring; secondly, when they are “plucked up by
	the roots.” So these apostates, once dead in unbelief, and then by
	profession and baptism raised from the death of sin to the life of
	righteousness, but now having become dead
	again
	by apostasy, and so hopelessly
	dead.
	There is a climax. Not only without
	leaves,
	like trees
	in late autumn,
	but without
	fruit:
	not only so, but dead twice; and to crown all, “plucked up by the
	roots.”
