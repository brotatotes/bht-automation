See
	on Introduction on the source whence Jude derived this prophecy of
	Enoch. The Holy Spirit, by Jude, has sealed the truth of this much of
	the matter contained in the book of Enoch, though probably that book,
	as well as Jude, derived it from tradition (compare Note,
	see on  :-).
	There are reasons given by some for thinking the book of Enoch copied
	from Jude rather than vice versa. It is striking how, from the first,
	prophecy hastened towards its consummation. The earliest prophecies
	of the Redeemer dwell on His second coming in glory, rather than His
	first coming in lowliness (compare  :-
	with  :-).
	Enoch, in his translation without death, illustrated that truth which
	he all his life preached to the unbelieving world, the certainty of
	the Lord’s coming, and the resurrection of the dead, as the only
	effectual antidote to their skepticism and self-wise confidence in
	nature’s permanence.And

	is the sacred number. In Enoch, freedom from death and the sacred
	number are combined: for every seventh object is most highly valued.
	Jude thus shows the antiquity of the prophecies. Compare Note,
	see on  :-,
	“of old.” There were only five
	fathers between Enoch and Adam. The seventh
	from Adam prophesied the things which shall close the seventh

	the antediluvians alone, but to all
	the ungodly ( :-).
	His prophecy applied primarily indeed to the flood, but ultimately to
	the final judgment.cometh
