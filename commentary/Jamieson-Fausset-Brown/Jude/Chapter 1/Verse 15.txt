<p style=" ">This
	verse and the beginning of Enoch’s prophecy is composed in <i>Hebrew</i>
	poetic parallelism, the oldest specimen extant. Some think Lamech’s
	speech, which is also in poetic parallelism, was composed in mockery
	of Enoch’s prophecy: as Enoch foretold Jehovah’s coming to
	judgment, so Lamech presumes on impunity in polygamy and murder (just
	as Cain the murderer seemed to escape with impunity).</p>
