	The Holy Spirit teaches what
	we are
	to pray for, and how.
	None can pray aright save by being in
	the Spirit,
	that is, in the element of His influence. Chrysostom states that,
	among the charisms bestowed at the beginning of the New Testament
	dispensation, was the
	gift of prayer,
	bestowed on someone who prayed in the name of the rest, and taught
	others to pray. Moreover, their prayers so conceived and often used,
	were received and preserved among Christians, and out of them forms
	of prayer were framed. Such is the origin of liturgies [Hammond].
