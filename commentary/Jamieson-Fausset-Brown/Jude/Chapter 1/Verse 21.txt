	Jude combines the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost: and <i>faith,
	hope,</i>
	and <i>love.</i></p>
<p style=" "><b>Keep
	yourselves</b>
	— not in your own strength, but “in the love of God,” that is,
	<i>God’s
	love to you</i>
	and all His believing children, the only guarantee for their being
	<i>kept</i>
	safe. Man’s need of watching is implied; at the same time he cannot
	<i>keep</i>
	himself, unless God in His love keep him.</p>
<p style=" "><b>looking
	for</b> —
	in hope.</p>
<p style=" "><b>the
	mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>
	— to be fully manifested at His coming. <i>Mercy</i>
	is usually attributed to the Father: here to the Son; so entirely one
	are they.</p>
