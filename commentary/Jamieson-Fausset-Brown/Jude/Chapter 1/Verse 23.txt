<p style=" "><b>save
	with fear</b>
	— The oldest manuscripts do not read “with fear” in this
	position: but after “snatching them out of the fire” (with which,
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	said of a most narrow escape), they add the following words, forming
	a THIRD class, “and others compassionate with (IN) fear.” Three
	kinds of patients require three kinds of medical treatment. Ministers
	and Christians are said to “save” those whom they are made the
	instruments of saving; the <i>Greek</i>
	for “save” is present, therefore meaning “try to save.” Jude
	already (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>)
	had reference to the same passage (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	The three classes are: (1) those who <i>contend
	with you</i>
	(accusative case in oldest manuscripts), whom you should <i>convict;</i>
	(2) those who are as brands already in <i>the
	fire,</i>
	of which hell-fire is the consummation: these you should <i>try
	to save by snatching them out;</i>
	(3) those who are objects of <i>compassion,</i>
	whom accordingly you should <i>compassionate</i>
	(and help if occasion should offer), but at the same time not let
	pity degenerate into connivance at their error. Your compassion is to
	be accompanied “with fear” of being at all defiled by them.</p>
<p style=" "><b>hating</b>
	— Even <i>hatred</i>
	has its legitimate field of exercise. Sin is the only thing which God
	hates: so ought we.</p>
<p style=" "><b>even
	the garment</b>
	— a proverbial phrase: avoiding the most remote contact with sin,
	and hating that which borders on it. As <i>garments</i>
	of the apostles wrought miracles of good in healing, so the very
	<i>garment</i>
	of sinners metaphorically, that is, anything brought into contact
	with their pollution, is to be avoided. Compare as to lepers and
	other persons defiled, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>
	: the garments were held polluted; and anyone touching them was
	excluded, until purified, from religious and civil communion with the
	sanctified people of Israel. Christians who received at baptism the
	white garment in token of purity, are not to defile it by any
	approach to what is defiled.</p>
