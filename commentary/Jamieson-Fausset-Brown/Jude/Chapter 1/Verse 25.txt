<p style=" "><b>To
	the only ... God our Saviour</b>
	— The oldest manuscripts add, “through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
	The transcribers, fancying that “Savior” applied to Christ alone,
	omitted the words. The sense is, To the only God (the Father) who is
	our Savior through (that is, by the mediation of) Jesus Christ our
	Lord.</p>
<p style=" "><b>dominion</b>
	— <i>Greek,</i>
	“might.”</p>
<p style=" "><b>power</b>
	— <i>authority:
	legitimate power.</i>
	The oldest manuscripts and <i>Vulgate,</i>
	after “power,” have “before all the age,” that is, before all
	time as to the <i>past:</i>
	“<i>and</i>
	now,” as to the present; “and to all the ages,” that is, <i>for
	ever,</i>
	as to the time to come.</p>
