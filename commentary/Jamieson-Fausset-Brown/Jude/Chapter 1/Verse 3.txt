	As the minister is to give <i>all

	to admonish, so the people should, in accordance with his admonition,
	give <i>all

	to have all Christian graces, and to make their calling sure.</p>

	so the <i>Greek</i>
	aorist means; the <i>present</i>
	infinitive ‘to write,’ which precedes, expresses merely the
	general fact of writing) exhorting you.” The reason why he felt it
	necessary “to write <i>with
	exhortation,</i>”
	he states, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	“For there are certain men crept in,” etc. Having intended to
	write generally of “<i>the
	common salvation,</i>”
	he found it necessary from the existing evils in the Church, to write
	specially that they should <i>contend
	for the faith against</i>
	those evils.</p>

	Believers, like Nehemiah’s workmen (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>),
	with one hand “build themselves up in their most holy faith”;
