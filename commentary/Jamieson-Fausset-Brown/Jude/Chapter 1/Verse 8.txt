<p style=" "><b>also</b>

<p style=" "><b>these

	— The <i>Greek</i>
	has not “<i>filthy</i>”
	of <i>English
	Version.</i>
	The clause, “these men dreaming” (that is, in their dreams),
	belongs to all the verbs, “defile,” “despise,” and “speak
	evil.” All sinners are spiritually asleep, and their carnal
	activity is as it were a dream (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	Their <i>speaking
	evil of dignities</i>
	is because they are <i>dreaming,</i>
	and <i>know
	not what they are speaking evil of</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	“As a man dreaming seems to himself to be seeing and nearing many
	things, so the natural man’s lusts are agitated by joy, distress,
	fear, and the other passions. But he is a stranger to self-command.
	Hence, though he bring into play all the powers of reason, he cannot
	conceive the true liberty which the sons of light, who are awake and
	in the daylight; enjoy” [Bengel].</p>

<p style=" "><b>dignities</b>
