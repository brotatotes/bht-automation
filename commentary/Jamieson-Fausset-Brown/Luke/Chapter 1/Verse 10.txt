<p><b>10. praying without</b>—outside
	the court in front of the temple, where stood the altar of burnt
	offering; the men and women in separate courts, but the altar visible
	to all.

<p><b>the time of incense</b>—which
	was offered along with the morning and evening sacrifice of every
	day; a beautiful symbol of the acceptableness of the <i>sacrifice</i>
	offered on the altar of burnt offering, with coals from whose altar
	the incense was burnt (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:12">Leviticus 16:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:13">Leviticus 16:13</span>). This again was a
	symbol of the "living sacrifice" of themselves and their
	services offered daily to God by the worshippers. Hence the language
	of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+141:2">Psalms 141:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:3">Revelation 8:3</span>.
	But that the acceptance of this daily offering depended on the
	<i>expiatory virtue</i> presupposed in the burnt offering, and
	pointing to the one "sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savor"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:2">Ephesians 5:2</span>), is evident from
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:6">Isaiah 6:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:7">Isaiah 6:7</span>.</p>
