	the court in front of the temple, where stood the altar of burnt
	offering; the men and women in separate courts, but the altar visible
	to all. 
	the time of incense—which
	was offered along with the morning and evening sacrifice of every
	day; a beautiful symbol of the acceptableness of the sacrifice
	offered on the altar of burnt offering, with coals from whose altar
	the incense was burnt (Leviticus 16:12;
	Leviticus 16:13). This again was a
	symbol of the "living sacrifice" of themselves and their
	services offered daily to God by the worshippers. Hence the language
	of Psalms 141:2; Revelation 8:3.
	But that the acceptance of this daily offering depended on the
	expiatory virtue presupposed in the burnt offering, and
	pointing to the one "sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savor"
	(Ephesians 5:2), is evident from
	Isaiah 6:6; Isaiah 6:7.
