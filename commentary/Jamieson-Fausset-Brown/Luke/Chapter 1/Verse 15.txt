<p><b>15. great in the sight of the
	Lord</b>—nearer to Him in official standing than all the prophets.

<p><b>drink neither wine nor strong
	drink</b>—that is, shall be a <i>Nazarite,</i> or "a separated
	one" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:2">Numbers 6:2</span>, c.). As the
	leper was the living symbol of <i>sin,</i> so was the Nazarite of
	<i>holiness</i> nothing inflaming was to cross his lips; no razor to
	come on his head; no ceremonial defilement to be contracted. Thus was
	he to be "holy to the Lord [ceremonially] all the days of his
	separation." This separation was in ordinary cases temporary and
	voluntary: only <i>Samson</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+6:2- :">Numbers 6:2- :</span>), <i>Samuel</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+1:11">1 Samuel 1:11</span>),
	and <i>John Baptist</i> were Nazarites from the womb. It was fitting
	that the utmost severity of legal consecration should be seen in
	Christ's forerunner. HE
	was the REALITY and
	PERFECTION of the Nazarite
	without the symbol, which perished in that living realization of it:
	"Such an High Priest became us, who was SEPARATE
	FROM SINNERS"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>filled with the Holy Ghost,
	from . . . womb</b>—a holy vessel for future service.</p>
