17. before him—before "the
	Lord their God" (Luke 1:16).
	By comparing this with Malachi 3:1;
	Isaiah 40:3, it is plainly "Jehovah"
	in the flesh of Messiah [CALVIN
	and OLSHAUSEN] before whom
	John was to go as a herald to announce His approach, and a
	pioneer o prepare His way. 
	in the spirit—after the
	model. 
	and power of Elias—not
	his miraculous power, for John did no miracle" (Isaiah 40:3- :), but his power "turning the heart," or with like
	success in his ministry. Both fell on degenerate times; both
	witnessed fearlessly for God; neither appeared much save in the
	direct exercise of their ministry; both were at the head of schools
	of disciples; the success of both was similar. 
	fathers to the children—taken
	literally, this denotes the restoration of parental
	fidelity [MEYER and
	others], the decay of which is the beginning of religious and social
	corruption—one prominent feature of the coming revival being put
	for the whole. But what follows, explanatory of this, rather suggests
	a figurative sense. If "the disobedient" be "the
	children," and to "the fathers" belongs "the
	wisdom of the just" [BENGEL],
	the meaning will be, "he shall bring back the ancient spirit of
	the nation into their degenerate children" [CALVIN,
	c.]. So Elijah invoked "the God Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,"
	when seeking to "turn their heart back again" (1 Kings 18:36
1 Kings 18:37). 
	to make ready, &c.—more
	clearly, "to make ready for the Lord a prepared people," to
	have in readiness a people prepared to welcome Him. Such preparation
	requires, in every age and every soul, an operation
	corresponding to the Baptist's ministry.
