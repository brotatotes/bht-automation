<p><b>28. highly favoured</b>â€”a word
	only once used elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6">Ephesians 1:6</span>,
	"made accepted"): compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:6- :">Ephesians 1:6- :</span>, "Thou hast found favour with God." The mistake of
	the <i>Vulgate's</i> rendering, "full of grace," has been
	taken abundant advantage of by the Romish Church. As the mother of
	our Lord, she was the most "blessed among women" in
	external distinction; but let them listen to the Lord's own words.
	"Nay, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep
	it." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:1">Luke 1:1</span>).</p>
