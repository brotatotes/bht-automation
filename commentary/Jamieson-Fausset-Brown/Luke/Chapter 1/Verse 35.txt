<p><b>35. Holy Ghost</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>power of the highest</b>—the
	immediate energy of the Godhead conveyed by the Holy Ghost. 
	</p>
<p><b>overshadow</b>—a word
	suggesting how gentle, while yet efficacious, would be this Power
	[BENGEL]; and its
	mysterious secrecy, withdrawn, as if by a cloud, from human scrutiny
	[CALVIN]. 
	</p>
<p><b>that holy thing born of
	thee</b>—that holy Offspring of thine. 
	</p>
<p><b>therefore . . . Son of
	God</b>—That Christ is the Son of God in His divine and eternal
	nature is clear from all the New Testament; yet here we see that
	Sonship efflorescing into human and palpable manifestation by His
	being born, through "the power of the Highest," an Infant
	of days. We must neither think of a <i>double</i> Sonship, as some
	do, harshly and without all ground, nor deny what is here plainly
	expressed, the connection between His human birth and His proper
	personal Sonship.</p>
