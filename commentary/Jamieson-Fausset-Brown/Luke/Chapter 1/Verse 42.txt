<p><b>42-44.</b> What beautiful
	superiority to <i>envy</i> have we here! High as was the distinction
	conferred upon herself, Elisabeth loses sight of it altogether, in
	presence of one more honored still; upon whom, with her unborn Babe,
	in an ecstasy of inspiration, she pronounces a benediction, feeling
	it to be a wonder unaccountable that "the mother of her Lord
	should come to <i>her.</i>" "Turn this as we will, we shall
	never be able to see the propriety of calling an unborn child "Lord,"
	but by supposing Elisabeth, like the prophets of old, enlightened to
	perceive the Messiah's <i>Divine nature</i>" [OLSHAUSEN].</p>
