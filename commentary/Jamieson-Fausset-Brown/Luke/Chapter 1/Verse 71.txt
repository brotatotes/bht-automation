68-79. There is not a word in
	this noble burst of divine song about his own child; like Elisabeth

	Lord God of Israel—the
	ancient covenant God of the peculiar people. 
	visited and redeemed—that
	is, in order to redeem: returned after long absence, and broken His
	long silence (see Matthew 15:31).
	In the Old Testament, God is said to "visit" chiefly for
	judgment, in the New Testament for mercy. Zacharias
	would, as yet, have but imperfect views of such "visiting and
	redeeming," "saving from and delivering out of the hand of
	enemies" (Luke 1:71; Luke 1:74).
	But this Old Testament phraseology, used at first with a lower
	reference, is, when viewed in the light of a loftier and more
	comprehensive kingdom of God, equally adapted to express the most
	spiritual conceptions of the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
