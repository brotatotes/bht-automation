	In the Old Testament, God is said to "visit" chiefly for
	<i>judgment,</i> in the New Testament for <i>mercy.</i> Zacharias
	would, as yet, have but imperfect views of such "visiting and
	redeeming," "saving from and delivering out of the hand of
	enemies" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:71">Luke 1:71</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:74">Luke 1:74</span>).
	But this Old Testament phraseology, used at first with a <i>lower</i>
	reference, is, when viewed in the light of a loftier and more
	comprehensive kingdom of God, equally adapted to express the most
	spiritual conceptions of the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
