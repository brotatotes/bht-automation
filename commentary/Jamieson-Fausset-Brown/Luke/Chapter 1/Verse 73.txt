	Abraham</b>â€”The whole work and kingdom of Messiah is represented as
	a mercy pledged on oath to Abraham and his seed, to be realized at an
	appointed period; and at length, in "the fulness of the time,"

	the <i>thing</i> promised; but "<i>truth,</i>" or <i>fidelity</i>
	to the promise, are said to "come by Jesus Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
