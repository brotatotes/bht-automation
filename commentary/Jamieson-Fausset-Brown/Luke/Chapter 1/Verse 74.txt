<p><b>74, 75. That he would grant us,</b>
	&amp;c.—How comprehensive is the view here given! (1) The <i>purpose</i>
	of all redemption—"that we should <i>serve</i> Him"—that
	is, "the Lord God of Israel" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The word signifies <i>religious</i> service
	distinctively—"the <i>priesthood</i> of the New Testament"
	[BENGEL]. (2) The <i>nature</i>
	of this service—"in holiness and righteousness before Him"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:75">Luke 1:75</span>) —or, as in His
	presence (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+56:13">Psalms 56:13</span>).
	(3) Its <i>freedom</i>—"being delivered out of the hand of our
	enemies." (4) Its <i>fearlessness</i>—"might serve Him
	without fear." (5) Its <i>duration</i>—"all the days of
	our life."</p>
