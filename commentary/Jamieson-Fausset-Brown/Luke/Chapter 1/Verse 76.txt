<p><b>76-79.</b> Here are the dying echoes
	of this song; and very beautiful are these closing notes—like the
	setting sun, shorn indeed of its noontide radiance, but skirting the
	horizon with a wavy and quivering light—as of molten gold—on
	which the eye delights to gaze, till it disappears from the view. The
	song passes not here from Christ to John, but only from Christ direct
	to Christ as heralded by His forerunner. 
	</p>
<p><b>thou child</b>—not "my
	son"—this child's relation to himself being lost in his
	relation to a Greater than either. 
	</p>
<p><b>prophet of the Highest; for
	thou shalt go before him</b>—that is, "the Highest." As
	"the Most High" is an epithet in Scripture only of <i>the
	supreme God,</i> it is inconceivable that inspiration should apply
	this term, as here undeniably, to Christ, unless He were "God
	over all blessed for ever" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
