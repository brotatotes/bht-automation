<p><b>1. the Lord</b>—a becoming title
	here, as this appointment was an act truly <i>lordly</i> [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>other seventy also</b>—rather,
	"others (also in number), seventy"; probably with allusion
	to the seventy elders of Israel on whom the Spirit descended in the
	wilderness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:24">Numbers 11:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:25">Numbers 11:25</span>).
	The mission, unlike that of the Twelve, was evidently quite
	<i>temporary.</i> All the instructions are in keeping with a brief
	and hasty <i>pioneering</i> mission, intended to supply what of
	general preparation for coming events the Lord's own visit afterwards
	to the same "cities and places" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:25- :">Numbers 11:25- :</span>) would not, from want of time, now suffice to accomplish;
	whereas the instructions to the Twelve, besides embracing all those
	to the Seventy, contemplate <i>world-wide</i> and <i>permanent</i>
	effects. Accordingly, after their return from this single missionary
	tour, we never again read of the Seventy.</p>
