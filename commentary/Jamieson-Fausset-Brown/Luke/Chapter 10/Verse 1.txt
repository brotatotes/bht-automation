	other seventy also—rather,
	"others (also in number), seventy"; probably with allusion
	to the seventy elders of Israel on whom the Spirit descended in the
	wilderness (Numbers 11:24; Numbers 11:25).
	The mission, unlike that of the Twelve, was evidently quite
	temporary. All the instructions are in keeping with a brief
	and hasty pioneering mission, intended to supply what of
	general preparation for coming events the Lord's own visit afterwards
	to the same "cities and places" (Numbers 11:25- :) would not, from want of time, now suffice to accomplish;
	whereas the instructions to the Twelve, besides embracing all those
	to the Seventy, contemplate world-wide and permanent
	effects. Accordingly, after their return from this single missionary
	tour, we never again read of the Seventy.
