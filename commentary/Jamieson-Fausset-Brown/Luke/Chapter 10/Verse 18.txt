<p><b>18. I beheld</b>—As much of the
	force of this glorious statement depends on the nice shade of sense
	indicated by the <i>imperfect tense</i> in the original, it should be
	brought out in the translation: "I was beholding Satan as
	lightning falling from heaven"; that is, "I followed you on
	your mission, and watched its triumphs; while you were wondering at
	the subjection to you of devils in My name, a grander spectacle <i>was
	opening</i> to My view; sudden as the darting of lightning from
	heaven to earth, lo! Satan was beheld falling from heaven!" How
	remarkable is this, that by that law of association which connects a
	part with the whole, those feeble triumphs of the Seventy seem to
	have not only brought vividly before the Redeemer the whole ultimate
	result of His mission, but compressed it into a moment and quickened
	it into the rapidity of lightning! <i>Note.</i>—The word rendered
	"<i>devils,</i>" is always used for those spiritual agents
	employed in <i>demoniacal possessions</i>—never for the ordinary
	agency of Satan in rational men. When therefore the Seventy say, "the
	<i>devils</i> [demons] are subject to us," and Jesus replies,
	"Mine eye was beholding <i>Satan falling,</i>" it is plain
	that He meant to raise their minds not only from the <i>particular</i>
	to the <i>general,</i> but from a very <i>temporary</i> form of
	satanic operation to <i>the entire kingdom of evil.</i> (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:12">Isaiah 14:12</span>).</p>
