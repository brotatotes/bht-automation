	to "overcome the world" and "quench all the fiery
	darts of the wicked one," by the communication and maintenance
	of which to His people He makes them <i>innocuous,</i> is what is
	meant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+5:4">1 John 5:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:16">Ephesians 6:16</span>).</p>
