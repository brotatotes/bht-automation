<p><b>21, 22. Jesus . . . said,</b> c.—The
	very same sublime words were uttered by our Lord on a former similar
	occasion (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) but
	(1) There we are merely told that He "answered and said"
	thus; here, He "<i>rejoiced in spirit</i> and said," c. (2)
	There it was merely "at that time" (or season) that He
	spoke thus, meaning with a general reference to the rejection of His
	gospel by the self-sufficient here, "<i>In that hour</i> Jesus
	said," with express reference probably to the humble class from
	which He had to draw the Seventy, and the similar class that had
	chiefly welcomed their message. "Rejoice" is too weak a
	word. It is "exulted in spirit"—evidently giving visible
	expression to His unusual emotions; while, at the same time, the
	words "in spirit" are meant to convey to the reader the
	<i>depth</i> of them. This is one of those rare cases in which the
	veil is lifted from off the Redeemer's inner man, that, angel-like,
	we may "look into it" for a moment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Let us gaze on it with reverential wonder, and as we
	perceive what it was that produced that mysterious ecstasy, we shall
	find rising in our hearts a still rapture—"Oh, the depths!"</p>
