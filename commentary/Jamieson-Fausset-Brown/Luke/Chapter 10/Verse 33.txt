<p><b>33. Samaritan</b>—one
	excommunicated by the Jews, a byword among them, synonymous with
	heretic and devil (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48">John 8:48</span>;
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:1">Luke 10:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>had compassion</b>—His best
	is mentioned first; for "He who gives outward things gives
	something <i>external to himself,</i> but he who imparts compassion
	and tears gives him something <i>from his very self</i>"
	[GREGORY THE
	GREAT, in TRENCH].
	No doubt the priest and Levite had their excuses—It is not safe to
	be lingering here; besides, he's past recovery; and then, may not
	suspicion rest upon ourselves? So might the Samaritan have reasoned,
	<i>but did not</i> [TRENCH].
	Nor did he say, He's a Jew, who would have had no dealings with me
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:9">John 4:9</span>), and why should I with
	him?</p>
