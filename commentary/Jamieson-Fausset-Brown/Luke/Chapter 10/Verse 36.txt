36. Which . . . was neighbour?—a
	most dexterous way of putting the question: (1) Turning the question
	from, "Whom am I to love as my neighbour?" to "Who is
	the man that shows that love?" (2) Compelling the lawyer to give
	a reply very different from what he would like—not only condemning
	his own nation, but those of them who should be the most exemplary.
	(3) Making him commend one of a deeply hated race. And he does it,
	but it is almost extorted. For he does not answer, "The
	Samaritan"—that would have sounded heterodox, heretical—but
	"He that showed mercy on him." It comes to the same thing,
	no doubt, but the circumlocution is significant.
