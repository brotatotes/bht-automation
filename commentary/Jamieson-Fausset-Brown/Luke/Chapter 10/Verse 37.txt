<p><b>37. Go,</b> c.—O exquisite,
	matchless teaching! What new fountains of charity has not this opened
	up in the human spirit—rivers in the wilderness, streams in the
	desert! What noble Christian institutions have not such words
	founded, all undreamed of till that wondrous One came to bless this
	heartless world of ours with His incomparable love—first in words,
	and then in deeds which have translated His words into flesh and
	blood, and poured the life of them through that humanity which He
	made His own! Was this parable, now, designed to magnify the law of
	love, and to show who fulfils it and who not? And who did this as
	never man did it, as our Brother Man, "our Neighbor?" The
	priests and Levites had not strengthened the diseased, nor bound up
	the broken (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:4">Ezekiel 34:4</span>), while He
	bound up the brokenhearted (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:4- :">Ezekiel 34:4- :</span>), and poured into all wounded spirits the balm of sweetest
	consolation. All the Fathers saw through the thin veil of this
	noblest of stories, <i>the</i> Story of love, and never wearied of
	tracing the analogy (though sometimes fancifully enough) [TRENCH].
	Exclaims GREGORY NAZIANZEN
	(in the fourth century), "He hungered, but He fed thousands He
	was weary, but He is the Rest of the weary; He is saluted 'Samaritan'
	and 'Demoniac,' but He <i>saves him that went down from Jerusalem and
	fell among thieves,</i>" &amp;c.
