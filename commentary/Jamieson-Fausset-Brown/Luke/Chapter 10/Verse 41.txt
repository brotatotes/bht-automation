<p><b>41. Martha, Martha</b>—emphatically
	redoubling upon the name. 
	</p>
<p><b>careful and cumbered</b>—the
	one word expressing the inward <i>worrying anxiety</i> that her
	preparations should be worthy of her Lord; the other, the outward
	<i>bustle</i> of those preparations. 
	</p>
<p><b>many things</b>—"much
	service" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:40">Luke 10:40</span>); too
	elaborate preparation, which so engrossed her attention that she
	missed her Lord's teaching.</p>
