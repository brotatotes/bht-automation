41. Martha, Martha—emphatically
	redoubling upon the name. 
	careful and cumbered—the
	one word expressing the inward worrying anxiety that her
	preparations should be worthy of her Lord; the other, the outward
	bustle of those preparations. 
	many things—"much
	service" (Luke 10:40); too
	elaborate preparation, which so engrossed her attention that she
	missed her Lord's teaching.
