<p><b>42. one thing,</b> c.—The idea of
	"Short work and little of it suffices for Me" is not so
	much the <i>lower sense</i> of these weighty words, as <i>supposed</i>
	in them, as the basis of something far loftier than any precept on
	economy. Underneath that idea is couched another, as to the
	littleness both of elaborate preparation for the present life and <i>of
	that life itself,</i> compared with another.

<p><b>chosen the good part</b>—not
	in the general sense of Moses' choice (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and Joshua's (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and David's (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) that is, of good in opposition to <i>bad;</i> but, of two
	good ways of serving and pleasing the Lord, choosing <i>the better.</i>
	Wherein, then, was Mary's better than Martha's? Hear what follows.

<p><b>not be taken away</b>—Martha's
	choice would be taken from her, for <i>her services would die with
	her;</i> Mary's <i>never,</i> being spiritual and eternal. Both were
	true-hearted disciples, but the one was absorbed in the higher, the
	other in the lower of two ways of honoring their common Lord. Yet
	neither despised, or would willingly neglect, the other's occupation.
	The one represents the <i>contemplative,</i> the other the <i>active</i>
	style of the Christian character. A Church full of Marys would
	perhaps be as great an evil as a Church full of Marthas. Both are
	needed, each to be the complement of the other.</p>
