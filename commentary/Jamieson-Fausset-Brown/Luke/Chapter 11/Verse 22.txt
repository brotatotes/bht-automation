<p><b>22. a stronger than he</b>—<i>Christ:</i>
	Glorious title, in relation to Satan! 
	</p>
<p><b>come upon him and overcome
	him</b>—sublimely expressing the Redeemer's approach, as the Seed
	of the woman, to bruise the Serpent's head. 
	</p>
<p><b>taketh from him all his
	armour</b>—"his panoply," "his complete armor."
	Vain would be the victory, were not the <i>means of regaining</i> his
	lost power wrested from him. It is this that completes the triumph
	and ensures the final overthrow of his kingdom. The parable that
	immediately follows (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) is just the <i>reverse of this.</i> (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.) In the one case, Satan is <i>dislodged by Christ,</i>
	and so finds, in all future assaults, the house <i>preoccupied;</i>
	in the other, he merely goes out and comes in again, finding the
	house "EMPTY"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:44">Matthew 12:44</span>) of any rival, and
	all ready to welcome him back. This explains the important saying
	that comes in <i>between the two parables</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:44- :">Matthew 12:44- :</span>). <i>Neutrality in religion there is none.</i> The absence
	of positive attachment to Christ involves hostility to Him.</p>
