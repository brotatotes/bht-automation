<p><b>27, 28. as he spake these things, a
	. . . woman of the company</b>—of the multitude, the crowd. A
	charming little incident and profoundly instructive. With true
	womanly feeling, she envies the mother of such a wonderful Teacher.
	Well, and higher and better than she had said as much before her
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:28">Luke 1:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:42">Luke 1:42</span>);
	and our Lord is far from condemning it. He only holds up—as
	"<i>blessed rather</i>"—the hearers and keepers of God's
	word; in other words, <i>the humblest real saint of God.</i> (See on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:42- :">Luke 1:42- :</span>.) How utterly alien is
	this sentiment from the teaching of the Church of Rome, which would
	excommunicate any one of its members who dared to talk in the spirit
	of this glorious saying! (Also see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:42- :">Luke 1:42- :</span>.)</p>
