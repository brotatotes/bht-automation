<p><b>3. day by day,</b> &amp;c.â€”an
	extension of the petition in Matthew for "<i>this day's</i>"
	supply, to every successive day's necessities. The closing doxology,
	wanting here, is wanting also in all the best and most ancient copies
	of Matthew's Gospel. Perhaps our Lord purposely left that part <i>open:</i>
	and as the grand Jewish doxologies were ever resounding, and passed
	immediately and naturally, in all their hallowed familiarity into the
	Christian Church, probably this prayer was never used in the
	Christian assemblies but in its present form, as we find it in
	Matthew, while in Luke it has been allowed to stand as originally
	uttered.</p>
