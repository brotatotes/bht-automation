	generation</b>—As it was only in the last generation of them that
	"the iniquity of the Amorites was full" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and then the abominations of ages were at once completely
	and awfully avenged, so the iniquity of Israel was allowed to
	accumulate from age to age till in that generation it came to the
	full, and the whole collected vengeance of Heaven broke at once over
	its devoted head. In the first French Revolution the same awful
	principle was exemplified, and <i>Christendom has not done with it
	yet.</i>
