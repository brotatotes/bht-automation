<p><b>13. Master,</b> c.â€”that is, "Great
	Preacher of righteousness, help there is need of Thee in this
	rapacious world; here am I the victim of injustice, and that from my
	own brother, who withholds from me my rightful share of the
	inheritance that has fallen to us." In this most inopportune
	intrusion upon the solemnities of our Lord's teaching, there is a
	mixture of the absurd and the irreverent, the one, however,
	occasioning the other. The man had not the least idea that his case
	was not of as urgent a nature, and as worthy the attention of our
	Lord, as anything else He could deal with.</p>
