<p><b>20, 21. this night,</b> &amp;c.—This
	sudden cutting short of his career is designed to express not only
	the folly of building securely upon the future, but of throwing one's
	whole soul into what may at any moment be gone. "Thy <i>soul</i>
	shall be required of thee" is put in opposition to his own
	treatment of it, "I will say to my <i>soul, Soul,</i>" &amp;c.
	</p>
<p><b>whose shall those things be,</b>
	&amp;c.—Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:6">Psalms 39:6</span>, "He
	heapeth up riches and <i>knoweth not who shall gather them.</i>"</p>
