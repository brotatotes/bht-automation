<p><b>32. little flock,</b> c.—How
	sublime and touching a contrast between this tender and pitying
	appellation, "Little flock" (in the original a double
	diminutive, which in German can be expressed, but not in English)—and
	the "good pleasure" of the Father to give them the Kingdom
	the one recalling the insignificance and helplessness of that then
	literal handful of disciples, the other holding up to their view the
	eternal love that encircled them, the everlasting arms that were
	underneath them, and the high inheritance awaiting them!—"the
	kingdom"; grand word; then why not "bread" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> [BENGEL]). Well
	might He say, "Fear not!"</p>
