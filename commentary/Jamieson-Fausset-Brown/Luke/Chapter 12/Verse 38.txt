<p><b>38. second . . . third watch</b>—To
	find them ready to receive Him at any hour of day or night, when one
	might least of all expect Him, is peculiarly blessed. A servant may
	be truly faithful, even though taken so far unawares that he has not
	everything in <i>such</i> order and readiness for his master's return
	as he thinks is due to him, and both could and would have had if he
	had had notice of the time of his coming, and so may not be willing
	to open to him "<i>immediately,</i>" but fly to
	preparation, and let his master knock again ere he admit him, and
	even then <i>not with full joy.</i> A too common case this with
	Christians. But if the servant have himself and all under his charge
	in such a state that at any hour when his master knocks, he can open
	to him "immediately," and hail his "return"—that
	is the most enviable, "blessed" servant of all.</p>
