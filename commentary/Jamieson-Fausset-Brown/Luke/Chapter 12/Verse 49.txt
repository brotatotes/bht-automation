<p><b>fire</b>—"the higher
	spiritual element of life which Jesus came to introduce into this
	earth (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:11">Matthew 3:11</span>), with
	reference to its mighty effects in quickening all that is akin to it
	and <i>destroying all that is opposed.</i> To cause this element of
	life to take up its abode on earth, and wholly to pervade human
	hearts with its warmth, was the lofty destiny of the Redeemer"
	[OLSHAUSEN: so CALVIN,
	STIER, ALFORD,
	c.].

<p><b>what will I,</b> &amp;c.—an
	obscure expression, uttered under deep and half-smothered emotion. In
	its general import all are agreed but the nearest to the precise
	meaning seems to be, "And what should I have to desire if it
	were once already kindled?" [BENGEL
	and BLOOMFIELD].</p>
