<p><b>5. Fear Him . . . Fear Him</b>—how
	striking the repetition here! <i>Only the one fear would effectually
	expel the other.</i>
</p>
<p><b>after he hath killed,</b>
	c.—Learn here—(1) To play false with one's convictions to save
	one's life, may fail of its end after all, for God can inflict a
	violent death in some other and equally formidable way. (2) There is
	a <i>hell,</i> it seems, for the body as well as the soul
	consequently, sufferings adapted to the one as well as the other. (3)
	<i>Fear of hell</i> is a divinely authorized and needed motive of
	action even to Christ's "friends." (4) As Christ's meekness
	and gentleness were not compromised by such harsh notes as these, so
	those servants of Christ lack their Master's spirit who soften down
	all such language to please ears "polite." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
