<p><b>50. But . . . a baptism,</b>
	c.—clearly, His own bloody baptism, first to take place. 
	</p>
<p><b>how . . . straitened</b>—not,
	"how do I long for its accomplishment," as many understand
	it, thus making it but a repetition of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> but "what a pressure of spirit is upon Me." 
	</p>
<p><b>till it be accomplished</b>—till
	it be over. Before a promiscuous audience, such obscure language was
	fit on a theme like this; but oh, what surges of mysterious emotion
	in the view of what was now so near at hand does it reveal!</p>
