<p><b>51. peace . . . ? Nay,</b> c.â€”the
	reverse of peace, <i>in the first instance.</i> (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.) The connection of all this with the foregoing warnings
	about hypocrisy, covetousness, and watchfulness, is deeply solemn:
	"My conflict hasten apace Mine over, yours begins; and then, let
	the servants tread in their Master's steps, uttering their testimony
	entire and fearless, neither loving nor dreading the world,
	anticipating awful wrenches of the dearest ties in life, but looking
	forward, as I do, to the completion of their testimony, when,
	reaching the haven after the tempest, they shall enter into the joy
	of their Lord."
