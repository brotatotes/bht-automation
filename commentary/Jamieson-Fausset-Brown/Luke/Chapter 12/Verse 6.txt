<p><b>6, 7. five . . . for two
	farthings</b>—In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:29">Matthew 10:29</span> it
	is "two for one farthing"; so if one took two farthings'
	worth, he got one in addition—of such small value were they.

<p><b>than many sparrows</b>—not
	"than millions of sparrows"; the charm and power of our
	Lord's teaching is very much in this simplicity.</p>
