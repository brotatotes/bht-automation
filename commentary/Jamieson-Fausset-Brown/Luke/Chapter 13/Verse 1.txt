1-3. Galileans—possibly the
	followers of Judas of Galilee, who, some twenty years before this,
	taught that Jews should not pay tribute to the Romans, and of whom we
	learn, from Acts 5:37, that he
	drew after him a multitude of followers, who on his being slain were
	all dispersed. About this time that party would be at its height, and
	if Pilate caused this detachment of them to be waylaid and put to
	death as they were offering their sacrifices at one of the festivals,
	that would be "mingling their blood with their sacrifices"
	[GROTIUS, WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON, but doubted
	by DE WETTE,
	MEYER, ALFORD,
	c.]. News of this being brought to our Lord, to draw out His views of
	such, and whether it was not a judgment of Heaven, He simply points
	them to the practical view of the matter: "These men are not
	signal examples of divine vengeance, as ye suppose but every
	impenitent sinner—ye yourselves, except ye repent—shall be
	like monuments of the judgment of Heaven, and in a more awful sense."
	The reference here to the impending destruction of Jerusalem is far
	from exhausting our Lord's weighty words; they manifestly point to a
	"perdition" of a more awful kind—future, personal,
	remediless.
