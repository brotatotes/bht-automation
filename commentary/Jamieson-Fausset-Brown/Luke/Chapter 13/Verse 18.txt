	The parable of "the Leaven" sets forth, perhaps, rather the
	<i>inward</i> growth of the kingdom, while "the Mustard Seed"
	seems to point chiefly to the <i>outward.</i> It being a woman's work
	to knead, it seems a refinement to say that "the woman"
	here represents <i>the Church,</i> as the instrument of depositing
	the leaven. Nor does it yield much satisfaction to understand the
	"three measures of meal" of that threefold division of our
	nature into "spirit, soul, and body," (alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) or of the threefold partition of the world among the three
	sons of Noah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+10:32">Genesis 10:32</span>), as
	some do. It yields more real satisfaction to see in this brief
	parable just the <i>all-penetrating</i> and <i>assimilating</i>
	quality of the Gospel, by virtue of which it will yet mould all
	institutions and tribes of men, and exhibit over the whole earth one
	"Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+10:32- :">Genesis 10:32- :</span>).</p>
