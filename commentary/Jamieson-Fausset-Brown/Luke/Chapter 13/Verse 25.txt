<p><b>25. master of the house is risen up
	and hath shut to the door</b>—awfully sublime and vivid picture! At
	present he is represented as in a <i>sitting</i> posture, as if
	calmly looking on to see who will "strive," while entrance
	is practicable, and who will merely "seek" to enter in. But
	this is to have an end, by the great Master of the house Himself
	rising and shutting the door, after which there will be <i>no
	admittance.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Lord, Lord</b>—emphatic
	reduplication, expressive of the earnestness <i>now</i> felt, but too
	late. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
