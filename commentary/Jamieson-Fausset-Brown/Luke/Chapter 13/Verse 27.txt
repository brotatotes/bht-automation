27. But he shall say, &c.â€”(See
	on  :-). No nearness of
	external communion with Christ will avail at the great day, in place
	of that holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. Observe
	the style which Christ intimates that He will then assume,
	that of absolute Disposer of men's eternal destinies, and contrast it
	with His "despised and rejected" condition at that time.
