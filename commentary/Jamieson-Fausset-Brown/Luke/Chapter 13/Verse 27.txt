<p><b>27. But he shall say,</b> &amp;c.â€”(See
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>No nearness of
	external communion with Christ will avail at the great day, in place
	of that holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.</i> Observe
	the <i>style</i> which Christ intimates that He will then assume,
	that of absolute Disposer of men's eternal destinies, and contrast it
	with His "despised and rejected" condition at that time.</p>
