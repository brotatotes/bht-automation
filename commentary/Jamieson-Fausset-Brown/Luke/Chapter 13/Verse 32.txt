<p><b>Behold, I cast out devils and
	I do cures</b>—that is, "Plot on and ply thy wiles; I also

	remain; I have work for to-day and to-morrow too, and the third day;
	by that time I shall be where his jurisdiction reaches not; the guilt
	of My blood shall not lie at his door; that dark deed is reserved for
	others." He does not say, I preach the Gospel—that would have
	made little impression upon Herod—in the light of the <i>merciful</i>
	character of Christ's <i>actions</i> the <i>malice</i> of Herod's

	He meant to go through with them, one after another, to the last,

	were now hastening to completion. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
