12-14. call not thy friends—Jesus
	certainly did not mean us to dispense with the duties of ordinary
	fellowship, but, remitting these to their proper place, inculcates
	what is better [BENGEL]. 
	lest . . . a recompense be
	given thee—a fear the world is not afflicted with [BENGEL].
	The meaning, however, is that no exercise of principle is
	involved in it, as selfishness itself will suffice to prompt to it
	(Matthew 5:46; Matthew 5:47).
