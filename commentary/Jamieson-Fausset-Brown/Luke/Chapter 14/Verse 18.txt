<p><b>18. all began to make
	excuse</b>â€”(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5">Matthew 22:5</span>).
	Three excuses, given as specimens of the rest, answer to "the
	<i>care of this world</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5- :">Matthew 22:5- :</span>), "the <i>deceitfulness of riches</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5- :">Matthew 22:5- :</span>), and "the <i>pleasures of this life</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:5- :">Matthew 22:5- :</span>), which "choke the word" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:22">Matthew 13:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:14">Luke 8:14</span>). Each differs from the
	other, and each has its own plausibility, but <i>all come to the same
	result:</i> "We have other things to attend to, more pressing
	just now." Nobody is represented as saying, I <i>will not</i>
	come; nay, all the answers imply that <i>but for</i> certain things
	they <i>would</i> come, and when these are out of the way they <i>will</i>
	come. So it certainly is in the case intended, for the last words
	clearly imply that the <i>refusers</i> will one day become
	<i>petitioners.</i></p>
