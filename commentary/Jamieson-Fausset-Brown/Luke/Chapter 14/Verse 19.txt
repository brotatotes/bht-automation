<p><b>15-24. when one . . . heard . . . he
	said, Blessed,</b> c.—As our Lord's words seemed to hold forth the
	future "recompense" under the idea of a great Feast, the
	thought passes through this man's mind, how blessed they would be who
	should be honored to sit down to it. Our Lord's reply is in substance
	this: "The great Feast is prepared already the invitations are
	issued, <i>but declined;</i> the feast, notwithstanding, shall not
	want abundance of guests; but not one of its present contemners—who
	shall yet come to sue for admission—shall be allowed to taste of
	it." This shows what was lacking in the seemingly pious
	exclamation of this man. It was Balaam's, "Let me <i>die the
	death</i> of the righteous, and let my last end be like his" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), without any anxiety about <i>living his life;</i> fondly
	wishing that all were right with him <i>at last,</i> while all
	heedless of the precious <i>present.</i></p>
