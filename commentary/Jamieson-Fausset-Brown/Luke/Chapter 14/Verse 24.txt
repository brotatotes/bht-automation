<p><b>24. I say unto you, That none</b>â€”Our
	Lord here appears to throw off the veil of the parable, and proclaim
	the Supper <i>His own,</i> intimating that when transferred and
	transformed into its final glorious form, and the refusers themselves
	would give all for another opportunity, He will not allow one of them
	to taste it. (<i>Note.</i> This parable must not be confounded with
	that of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+1:24-33">Proverbs 1:24-33</span>; <i>The
	Marriage Supper,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+1:24-20.1.33- :">Proverbs 1:24-20.1.33- :</span>).

	TRAVELLING WITH HIM.</p>
