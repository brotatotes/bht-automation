28-33. which of you, c.â€”Common
	sense teaches men not to begin any costly work without first
	seeing that they have wherewithal to finish. And he who does
	otherwise exposes himself to general ridicule. Nor will any wise
	potentate enter on a war with any hostile power without first seeing
	to it that, despite formidable odds (two to one), he be able to stand
	his ground and if he has no hope of this, he will feel that nothing
	remains for him but to make the best terms he can. Even so,
	says our Lord, "in the warfare you will each have to wage as My
	disciples, despise not your enemy's strength, for the odds are all
	against you; and you had better see to it that, despite every
	disadvantage, you still have wherewithal to hold out and win the day,
	or else not begin at all, and make the best you can in such awful
	circumstances." In this simple sense of the parable (STIER,
	ALFORD, c., go wide of the
	mark here in making the enemy to be God, because of the
	"conditions of peace,"  :-), two things are taught: (1) Better not begin ( :-), than begin and not finish. (2) Though the contest for
	salvation be on our part an awfully unequal one, the human will,
	in the exercise of that "faith which overcometh the world"
	(1 John 5:4), and nerved by power
	from above, which "out of weakness makes it strong"
	(Hebrews 11:34 1 Peter 1:5),
	becomes heroical and will come off "more than conqueror."
	But without absolute surrender of self the contest is hopeless
	(Luke 14:33).
