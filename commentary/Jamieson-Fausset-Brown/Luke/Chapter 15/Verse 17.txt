<p><b>17. came to himself</b>—Before, he
	had been "beside himself" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), in what sense will presently appear.

<p><b>How many hired,</b> &amp;c.—What
	a testimony to the <i>nature</i> of the home he had left! But did he
	not know all this ere he departed and every day of his voluntary
	exile? He did, and he did not. His heart being wholly estranged from
	home and steeped in selfish gratification, his father's house never
	came within the range of his vision, or but as another name for
	bondage and gloom. Now empty, desolate, withered, perishing, <i>home,</i>
	with all its peace, plenty, freedom, dignity, starts into view, fills
	all his visions as a warm and living reality, and breaks his heart.</p>
