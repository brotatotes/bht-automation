<p><b>18. I will arise and go to my </b><b>FATHER</b><b>
</b>—The change has come at last, and what a change!—couched in
	terms of such exquisite simplicity and power as if expressly framed
	for all heart-broken penitents. 
	</p>
<p><b>Father,</b> c.—Mark the
	term. Though "no more <i>worthy</i> to be called his son,"
	the prodigal sinner is taught to claim the <i>defiled,</i> but <i>still
	existing</i> relationship, asking not to be made a servant, but
	<i>remaining a son</i> to be made "<i>as</i> a servant,"
	willing to take the lowest place and do the meanest work. Ah! and is
	it come to this? Once it was, "Any place rather than home."
	Now, "Oh, that home! Could I but dare to hope that the door of
	it would not be closed against me, how gladly would I take any place
	and do any worK, happy only to be there at all." Well, <i>that
	is conversion</i>—nothing absolutely new, yet all new old familiar
	things seen in a new light and for the first time as realities of
	overwhelming magnitude and power. <i>How this is brought about the
	parable says not.</i> (We have that abundantly elsewhere, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, &amp;c.). Its one object is to paint the <i>welcome home</i>
	of the greatest sinners, when (no matter for the present <i>how</i>)
	they "arise and go <i>to their</i> Father."</p>
