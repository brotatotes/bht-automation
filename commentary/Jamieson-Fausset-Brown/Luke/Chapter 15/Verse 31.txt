31. Son, c.—The father resents
	not the insult—how could he, after the largeness of heart which had
	kissed the returning prodigal? He calmly expostulates with him, "Son,
	listen to reason. What need for special, exuberant joy over thee?
	Didst thou say, 'Lo, these many years do I serve thee?' In that
	saidst thou truly but just for that reason do I not set the
	whole household a-rejoicing over thee. For thee is reserved what
	is higher still—a tranquil lifelong satisfaction in thee, as a
	true-hearted faithful son in thy father's house, nor of the
	inheritance reserved for thee is aught alienated by this festive and
	fitting joy over the once foolish but now wise and newly recovered
	one."
