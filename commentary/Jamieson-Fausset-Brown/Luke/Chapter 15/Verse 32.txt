<p><b>32. It was meet</b>—Was it
	possible he should simply take his long vacant place in the family
	without one special sign of wonder and delight at the change? Would
	that have been <i>nature?</i> But <i>this</i> being the meaning of
	the festivity, it would for that very reason be <i>temporary.</i> In
	time, the dutifulness of even the younger son would become the <i>law</i>
	and not the <i>exception;</i> he too at length might venture to say,
	"Lo, these many years do I serve thee"; and of him the
	father would say, "Son, thou art ever with me." In that
	case, therefore, it would <i>not</i> be "meet that they should
	make merry and be glad." The lessons are obvious, but how
	beautiful! (1) The deeper sunk and the longer estranged any sinner
	is, the more exuberant is the joy which his recovery occasions. (2)
	Such joy is <i>not</i> the portion of those whose whole lives have
	been spent in the service of their Father in heaven. (3) Instead of
	grudging the want of this, they should deem it the highest testimony
	to their lifelong fidelity, that something better is reserved for
	them—the deep, abiding complacency of their Father in heaven.</p>
