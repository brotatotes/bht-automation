	very different from this; but those represented by the <i>prodigal's
	well-behaved brother,</i> who have "served their Father"
	many years and not at any time transgressed His commandment (in the
	outrageous sense of the prodigal). (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+15:1">Luke 15:1</span>). In other
	words, <i>such as have grown up from childhood</i> in the fear of God
	and as the sheep of His pasture. Our Lord does not <i>say</i> "the
	Pharisees and scribes" were such; but as there was undoubtedly
	such a class, while "the publicans and sinners" were
	confessedly the strayed sheep and the prodigal children, He leaves
	them to fill up the place of the other class, <i>if they could.</i>
