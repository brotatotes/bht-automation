<p><b>10. He,</b> c.â€”a maxim of great
	pregnancy and value rising from the <i>prudence</i> which the steward
	had to the <i>fidelity</i> which he had not, the "<i>harmlessness</i>
	of the dove, to which the serpent" with all his "<i>wisdom</i>"
	is a total stranger. Fidelity depends not on the <i>amount entrusted,</i>
	but on the <i>sense of responsibility.</i> He that feels this in
	little will feel it in much, and conversely.</p>
