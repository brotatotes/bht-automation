<p><b>12. another man's . . . your own</b>â€”an
	important turn to the subject. Here all we have is <i>on trust</i> as
	stewards, who have an account to render. Hereafter, what the faithful
	have will be <i>their own property,</i> being no longer on probation,
	but in secure, undisturbed, rightful, everlasting possession and
	enjoyment of all that is graciously bestowed on us. Thus money is
	neither to be <i>idolized</i> nor <i>despised:</i> we must sit loose
	to it and use it for God's glory.</p>
