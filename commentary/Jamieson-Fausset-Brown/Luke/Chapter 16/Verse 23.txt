<p><b>23. in hell</b>—not the final
	place of the lost (for which another word is used), but as we say
	"the unseen world." But as the object here is certainly to
	depict the <i>whole torment</i> of the one and the <i>perfect bliss</i>
	of the other, it comes in this case to much the same.

<p><b>seeth Abraham</b>—not God,
	to whom therefore he cannot cry [BENGEL].</p>
