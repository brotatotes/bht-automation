	&amp;c.—As it is a great law of God's kingdom, that <i>the nature
	of our present desires shall rule that of our future bliss,</i> so by
	that law, he whose "good things," craved and enjoyed, were
	all bounded by time, could look for none after his connection with
	time had come to an end (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:24">Luke 6:24</span>).
	But by this law, he whose "evil things," all crowded into
	the present life, drove him to seek, and find, consolation in a life
	beyond the grave, is by death released from all evil and ushered into
	unmixed and uninterrupted good (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:24- :">Luke 6:24- :</span>). (2) It is <i>impossible.</i></p>
