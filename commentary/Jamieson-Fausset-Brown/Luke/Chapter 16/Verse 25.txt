	acknowledgment of the claimed relationship. 
	thou . . . Lazarus,
	&c.—As it is a great law of God's kingdom, that the nature
	of our present desires shall rule that of our future bliss, so by
	that law, he whose "good things," craved and enjoyed, were
	all bounded by time, could look for none after his connection with
	time had come to an end (Luke 6:24).
	But by this law, he whose "evil things," all crowded into
	the present life, drove him to seek, and find, consolation in a life
	beyond the grave, is by death released from all evil and ushered into
	unmixed and uninterrupted good (Luke 6:24- :). (2) It is impossible.
