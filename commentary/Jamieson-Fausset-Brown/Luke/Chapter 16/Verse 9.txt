<p><b>9. Make . . . friends of</b>—Turn
	to your advantage; that is, as the steward did, "by showing
	mercy to the poor" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+4:27">Daniel 4:27</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:33">Luke 12:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:13">Luke 14:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:14">Luke 14:14</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>mammon of
	unrighteousness</b>—treacherous, precarious. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:14- :">Luke 14:14- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>ye fail</b>—in respect of
	life. 
	</p>
<p><b>they may receive you</b>—not
	generally, "ye may be received" (as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:14- :">Luke 14:14- :</span>, "shall <i>men</i> give"), but "those ye have
	relieved may rise up as witnesses for you" at the great day.
	Then, like the steward, when turned out of one home shall ye secure
	another; but better than he, a heavenly for an earthly, an
	everlasting for a temporary habitation. Money is not here made the
	key to heaven, more than "the deeds done in the body" in
	general, according to which, as a test of character—but not by the
	merit of which—men are to be judged (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:14- :">Luke 14:14- :</span>, and see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+14:14- :">Luke 14:14- :</span>).</p>
