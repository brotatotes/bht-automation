<p><b>22. The days</b>—rather "Days."
	</p>
<p><b>will come</b>—as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, when, amidst calamities, c., you will anxiously look for a
	deliverer, and deceivers will put themselves forward in this
	character.

<p><b>one of the days of the Son of
	man</b>—Himself again among them but for one day as we say when all
	seems to be going wrong and the one person who could keep them right
	is removed [NEANDER in
	STIER, &amp;c.]. "This
	is said to guard against the mistake of supposing that His visible
	presence would accompany the manifestation and establishment of His
	kingdom" [WEBSTER and
	WILKINSON].</p>
