<p><b>34. two in one bed</b>â€”the
	prepared and unprepared mingled in closest intercourse together in
	the ordinary walks and fellowships of life, when the moment of
	severance arrives. Awful truth! realized before the destruction of
	Jerusalem, when the Christians found themselves forced by their
	Lord's directions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:21">Luke 21:21</span>)
	at once and for ever away from their old associates; but most of all
	when the second coming of Christ shall burst upon a heedless world.</p>
