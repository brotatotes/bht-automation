<p><b>7-10. say unto him by and by</b>â€”The
	"by and by" (or rather "directly") should be
	joined not to the <i>saying</i> but the <i>going:</i> "Go
	directly." The connection here is: "But when your faith <i>has</i>
	been so increased as both to avoid and forgive offenses, and do
	things impossible to all but faith, be not puffed up as though you
	had laid the Lord under any obligations to you."</p>
