<p><b>15. infants</b>—showing that some,
	at least, of those called in Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) and Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:13">Mark 10:13</span>)
	simply "little" or "young children," were
	literally "<i>babes.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>touch them</b>—or, as more
	fully in Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13">Matthew 19:13</span>),
	"put His hands on them and <i>pray,</i>" or invoke a
	"blessing" on them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:13- :">Matthew 19:13- :</span>), according to venerable custom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:14">Genesis 48:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+48:15">Genesis 48:15</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>rebuked them</b>—Repeatedly
	the disciples thus interposed to save annoyance and interruption to
	their Master; but, as the result showed, <i>always against the mind
	of Christ</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:23">Matthew 15:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:39">Luke 18:39</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:40">Luke 18:40</span>). Here, it is plain
	from our Lord's reply, that they thought the intrusion a useless one,
	as <i>infants</i> were not capable of receiving anything from Him.
	His ministrations were for <i>grown people.</i></p>
