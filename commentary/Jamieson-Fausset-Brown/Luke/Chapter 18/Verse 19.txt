<p><b>19. Why,</b> c.—Did our Lord mean
	then to teach that God only ought to be called "good?"
	Impossible, for that had been to contradict all Scripture teaching,
	and His own, too (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:5">Psalms 112:5</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:21">Matthew 25:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="tit+1:8">Titus 1:8</span>).
	Unless therefore we are to ascribe captiousness to our Lord, He could
	have had but one object—<i>to raise the youth's ideas of Himself,</i>
	as not to be classed merely with other "good masters," and
	declining to receive this title <i>apart from</i> the "One"
	who is essentially and only "good." This indeed is but
	distantly hinted; but unless this is seen in <i>the background</i> of
	our Lord's words, nothing worthy of Him can be made out of them.
	(Hence, <i>Socinianism,</i> instead of having any support here, is
	only baffled by it).</p>
