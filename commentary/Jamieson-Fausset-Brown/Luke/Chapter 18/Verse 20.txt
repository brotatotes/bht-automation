<p><b>20. Thou knowest,</b> c.—Matthew
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:17">Matthew 19:17</span>) is more complete
	here: "but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
	He saith unto him, Which—as if he had said, Point me out one of
	them which I have not kept?—"Jesus said, Thou shalt," &amp;c.
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:17">Matthew 19:17</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:18">Matthew 19:18</span>).
	Our Lord purposely confines Himself to the <i>second</i> table, which
	He would consider easy to keep, enumerating them all—for in Mark
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:19">Mark 10:19</span>), "Defraud not"
	stands for the <i>tenth</i> (else the eighth is twice repeated). In
	Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:19">Matthew 19:19</span>) the <i>sum</i>
	of this second table of the law is added, "Thou shalt love thy
	neighbor as thyself," as if to see if he would venture to say he
	had kept <i>that.</i></p>
