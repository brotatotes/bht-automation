21. All these, c.—"what
	lack I yet?" adds Matthew ( :-). Ah! this gives us a glimpse of his heart. Doubtless he
	was perfectly sincere but something within whispered to him that his
	keeping of the commandments was too easy a way of getting to
	heaven. He felt something beyond this to be necessary; after keeping
	all the commandments he was at a loss to know what that could be; and
	he came to Jesus just upon that point. "Then," says Mark
	(Mark 10:21), "Jesus
	beholding him loved him," or "looked lovingly upon him."
	His sincerity, frankness, and nearness to the kingdom of God, in
	themselves most winning qualities, won our Lord's regard even though
	he turned his back upon Him—a lesson to those who can see nothing
	lovable save in the regenerate.
