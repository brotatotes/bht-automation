<p><b>23-25. was very sorrowful</b>—Matthew
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+19:22">Matthew 19:22</span>) more fully, "<i>went
	away</i> sorrowful"; Mark still more, "was sad" or
	"sullen" at that saying, and "went away grieved."
	Sorry he was, very sorry, to part with Christ; but to part with his
	riches would have cost him a pang more. When Riches or Heaven, on
	Christ's terms, were the alternative, the result showed to which side
	the balance inclined. Thus was he shown to lack the one
	all-comprehensive requirement of the law—the <i>absolute subjection
	of the heart to God,</i> and this want vitiated all his other
	obediences.</p>
