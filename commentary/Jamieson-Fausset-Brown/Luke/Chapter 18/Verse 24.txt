<p><b>24. when Jesus saw</b>—Mark says
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:34">Mark 3:34</span>), He "looked
	round about"—as if first following the departing youth with
	His eye—"and saith unto His disciples." 
	</p>
<p><b>How hardly,</b> c.—with
	what difficulty. In Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:34- :">Mark 3:34- :</span>) an explanation is added, "How hard is it for them
	that <i>trust</i> in riches," &amp;c.—that is, with what
	difficulty is this idolatrous trust conquered, without which they
	cannot enter and this is introduced by the word "children"—sweet
	diminutive of affection and pity (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:34- :">Mark 3:34- :</span>).</p>
