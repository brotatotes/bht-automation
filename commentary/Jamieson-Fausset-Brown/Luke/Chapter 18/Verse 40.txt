<p><b>40. commanded,</b> c.—Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) has this interesting addition: "And they call the
	blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise, He calleth
	thee"—just as one earnestly desiring an interview with some
	exalted person, but told by one official after another that it is
	vain to wait, as he will not succeed (they know it), yet persists in
	waiting for some answer to his suit, and at length the door opens,
	and a servant appears, saying, "You will be admitted—he has
	called you." <i>And are there no other suitors to Jesus who
	sometimes fare thus?</i> "And he, casting away his garment"—how
	lively is this touch, evidently of an eye-witness, expressive of his
	earnestness and joy—"came to Jesus" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:49">Mark 10:49</span>
