8. speedily—as if pained at
	the long delay, impatient for the destined moment to interpose.
	(Compare Proverbs 29:1.) 
	Nevertheless, c.—that
	is, Yet ere the Son of man comes to redress the wrongs of His Church,
	so low will the hope of relief sink, through the length of the delay,
	that one will be fain to ask, Will He find any faith of a coming
	avenger left on the earth? From this we learn: (1) That the primary
	and historical reference of this parable is to the Church in
	its widowed, desolate, oppressed, defenseless condition during
	the present absence of her Lord in the heavens (2) That in these
	circumstances importunate, persevering prayer for deliverance is the
	Church's fitting exercise; (3) That notwithstanding every
	encouragement to this, so long will the answer be delayed, while the
	need of relief continues the same, and all hope of deliverance will
	have nearly died out, and "faith" of Christ's coming
	scarcely to be found. But the application of the parable to prayer
	in general is so obvious as to have nearly hidden its more direct
	reference, and so precious that one cannot allow it to disappear in
	any public and historical interpretation.
