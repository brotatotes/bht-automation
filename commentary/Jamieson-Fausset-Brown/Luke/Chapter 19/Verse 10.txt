<p><b>10. lost</b>â€”and such "lost"
	ones as this Zaccheus. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.) What encouragement is there in this narrative to hope for
	unexpected conversions?

<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. PARABLE OF THE
	POUNDS. 
	</p>
<p>A different parable from that of
	the Talents (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). For, (1) This parable was spoken "when He was
	<i>nigh</i> to Jerusalem" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); that one, some days after entering it, and from the Mount
	of Olives. (2) This parable was spoken to the promiscuous crowd;
	that, to the Twelve alone. Accordingly, (3) Besides the "servants"
	in this parable, who profess subjection to Him, there is a class of
	"citizens" who refuse to own Him, and who are treated
	differently, whereas in the parable of the talents, spoken to the
	<i>former</i> class alone, this latter class is omitted. (4) In the
	Talents, each servant receives a different number of them (five, two,
	one); in the Pounds all receive the same one pound, which is but
	about the sixtieth part of a talent; also, in the talents, each shows
	the same fidelity by doubling what he received (the five are made
	ten; the two, four); in the Pounds, each receiving the same, render a
	<i>different</i> return (one making his pound ten, another five).
	Plainly, therefore, the intended lesson is different; the one
	illustrating <i>equal fidelity with different degrees of advantage;</i>
	the other, <i>different degrees of improvement of the same
	opportunities;</i> yet with all this difference, the parables are
	remarkably similar.</p>
