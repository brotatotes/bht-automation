38. Blessed be
	the King, c.—Mark (Mark 11:9
Mark 11:10) more fully, "Hosanna,"
	that is, "Save now," the words of Mark 11:10- :, which were understood to refer to Messiah; and so they
	add, "to the Son of David, blessed is He that cometh in the name
	of the Lord (Psalms 118:26),
	Hosanna in the highest." This was the very loftiest style in
	which He could be saluted as the promised Deliverer. 
	peace, &c.—(See on
	Luke 2:13).
