<p><b>said unto the Lord, Behold,

	lordly <i>authority, dignity,</i> or <i>power</i> is intended.

<p><b>if I have</b>—that is, "so
	far as I have," for evidently the "if" is so used (as

	required this; the Jewish law, but the principal and a fifth more (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:13- :">Luke 3:13- :</span>). There was no <i>demand</i> made for either; but, as if to
	revenge himself on his hitherto reigning sin (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:13- :">Luke 3:13- :</span>), and to testify the change he had experienced, besides
	surrendering the half of his <i>fair</i> gains to the poor, he
	voluntarily determines to give up all that was ill-gotten,
	quadrupled. He gratefully addressed this to the "Lord," to
	whom he owed the wonderful change.</p>
