<p><b>11. unto you is born</b>—you
	shepherds, Israel, mankind [BENGEL].
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:6">Isaiah 9:6</span>, "Unto us a
	Child is born." It is a <i>birth</i>—"The Word is <i>made
	flesh</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:14">John 1:14</span>).
	When? "<i>This day.</i>" Where? "<i>In the city of
	David</i>"—in the right <i>line</i> and at the right "spot";
	where prophecy bade us look for Him, and faith accordingly expected
	Him. How dear to us should be these <i>historic moorings</i> of our
	faith! With the loss of them, all substantial Christianity is lost.
	By means of them how many have been kept from making shipwreck, and
	attained to a certain external admiration of Him, ere yet they have
	fully "beheld His glory."

<p><b>a Saviour</b>—not One who
	<i>shall</i> be a Saviour, but "<i>born a Saviour.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>Christ the Lord</b>—"magnificent
	appellation!" [BENGEL].
	"This is the only place where these words come together; and I
	see no way of understanding this "Lord" but as
	corresponding to the <i>Hebrew</i> JEHOVAH"
	[ALFORD].</p>
