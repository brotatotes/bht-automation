13. suddenly—as if only
	waiting till their fellow had done. 
	with the angel—who
	retires not, but is joined by others, come to seal and to celebrate
	the tidings he has brought. 
	heavenly host—or
	"army," an army celebrating peace! [BENGEL]
	"transferring the occupation of their exalted station to this
	poor earth, which so seldom resounds with the pure praise of God"
	[OLSHAUSEN]; to let it be
	known how this event is regarded in heaven and should be
	regarded on earth.
