<p><b>13. suddenly</b>—as if only
	waiting till their fellow had done.

<p><b>with the angel</b>—who
	retires not, but is joined by others, come to seal and to celebrate
	the tidings he has brought. 
	</p>
<p><b>heavenly host</b>—or
	"army," an <i>army</i> celebrating <i>peace!</i> [BENGEL]
	"transferring the occupation of their exalted station to this
	poor earth, which so seldom resounds with the pure praise of God"
	[OLSHAUSEN]; to let it be
	known how this event is regarded in <i>heaven</i> and should be
	regarded on <i>earth.</i></p>
