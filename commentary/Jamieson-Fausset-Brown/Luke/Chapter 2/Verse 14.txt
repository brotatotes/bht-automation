<p><b>14. Glory,</b> c.—brief but
	transporting hymn—not only in articulate human speech, for our
	benefit, but in tunable measure, in the form of a <i>Hebrew</i>
	parallelism of two complete clauses, and a third one only amplifying
	the second, and so without a connecting "and." The "<i>glory
	to God,</i>" which the new-born "Saviour" was to
	bring, is the first note of this sublime hymn: to this answers, in
	the second clause, the "<i>peace on earth,</i>" of which He
	was to be "the Prince" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) —probably sung responsively by the celestial choir while
	quickly follows the glad echo of this note, probably by a third
	detachment of the angelic choristers—"<i>good will to men.</i>"
	"They say not, glory to God in <i>heaven,</i> where angels are,
	but, using a rare expression, "<i>in the highest</i> [heavens],"
	whither angels aspire not," (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:3">Hebrews 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4">Hebrews 1:4</span>) [BENGEL].
	"Peace" with God is the grand necessity of a fallen world.
	To bring in this, and all other peace in its train, was the prime
	errand of the Saviour to this earth, and, along with it, Heaven's
	whole "good will to men"—the divine complacency on a new
	footing—descends to rest upon men, as upon the Son Himself, in whom
	God is "well-pleased." (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:4- :">Hebrews 1:4- :</span>, the same word as here.)</p>
