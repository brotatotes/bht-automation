<p><b>20. glorifying and praising God,</b>
	c.—The latter word, used of the song of the angels (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:37">Luke 19:37</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:53">Luke 24:53</span>, leads us to suppose
	that theirs was a song too, probably some canticle from the
	Psalter—meet vehicle for the swelling emotions of their simple
	hearts at what "they had <i>heard</i> and <i>seen.</i>"

	CHRIST. 
	</p>
<p>Here only recorded, and even here
	merely alluded to, for the sake of the name then given to the holy
	Babe, "JESUS,"
	or SAVIOUR (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:21">Matthew 1:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:23">Acts 13:23</span>). Yet in this naming of
	Him "Saviour," in the act of circumcising Him, which was a
	symbolical and bloody removal of the body of sin, we have a tacit
	intimation that they "had need"—as John said of His
	Baptism—rather to be circumcised by Him "with the circumcision
	made without hands, in the putting off of the body [of the sins] of
	the flesh by the circumcision of Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:23- :">Acts 13:23- :</span>), and that He only "suffered it to be so, because thus
	it became Him to fulfil all righteousness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:23- :">Acts 13:23- :</span>). Still the circumcision of Christ had a profound bearing on
	His own work—by few rightly apprehended. For since "he that is
	circumcised is a <i>debtor to do the whole law</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:23- :">Acts 13:23- :</span>), Jesus thus bore about with Him in His very flesh the seal
	of a voluntary obligation to do the whole law—by Him only possible
	in the flesh since the fall. And as He was "made under the law"
	for no ends of His own, but only "<i>to redeem them that were
	under the law,</i> that we might receive the adoption of sons"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:4">Galatians 4:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:5">Galatians 4:5</span>),
	the obedience to which His circumcision pledged Him was a <i>redeeming
	obedience</i>—that of a "Saviour." And, finally, as
	"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law" by
	"being made <i>a curse</i> for <i>us</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:5- :">Galatians 4:5- :</span>), we must regard Him, in His circumcision, as brought under
	a palpable pledge to be "<i>obedient unto death, even the death
	of the cross</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8">Philippians 2:8</span>).
