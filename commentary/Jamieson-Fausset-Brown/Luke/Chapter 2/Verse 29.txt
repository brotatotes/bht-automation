<p><b>29. Lord</b>—"Master," a
	word rarely used in the New Testament, and selected here with
	peculiar propriety, when the aged saint, feeling that his last object
	in wishing to live had now been attained, only awaited his Master's
	word of command to "depart." 
	</p>
<p><b>now lettest,</b> c.—more
	clearly, "now Thou art releasing Thy servant" a patient yet
	reverential mode of expressing a desire to depart.</p>
