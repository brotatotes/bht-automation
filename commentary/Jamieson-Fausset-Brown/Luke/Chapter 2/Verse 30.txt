	saw this child, nay, the full-grown "man, Christ Jesus,"
	who never saw in Him "God's Salvation." This estimate of an
	object of sight, an unconscious, helpless babe, was pure faith. He
	"beheld His glory" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). In another view it was <i>prior faith</i> rewarded by
	<i>present sight.</i></p>
