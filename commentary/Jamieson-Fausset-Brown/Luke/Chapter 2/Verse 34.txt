<p><b>fall and rising again of many
	in Israel, and for a sign spoken against</b>—Perhaps the former of
	these phrases expresses the two stages of temporary "fall of
	many in Israel" through unbelief, during our Lord's earthly
	career, and the subsequent "rising again" of <i>the same
	persons</i> after the effusion of the Spirit at pentecost threw a new
	light to them on the whole subject; while the latter clause describes
	the determined enemies of the Lord Jesus. Such opposite views of
	Christ are taken from age to age.</p>
