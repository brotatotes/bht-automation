	architecture, or surveying its forms of busy life, but in the
	templeâ€”not the "sanctuary" (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), to which only the priests had access, but in some one of
	the enclosures around it, where the rabbins, or "doctors,"
	taught their scholars.</p>
