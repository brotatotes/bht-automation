<p><b>46. hearing . . . asking</b>—The
	method of question and answer was the customary form of rabbinical
	teaching; teacher and learner becoming by turns questioner and
	answerer, as may be seen from their extant works. This would give
	full scope for all that "astonished them in His understanding
	and answers." Not that He assumed the office of <i>teaching</i>—"His
	hour" for that "was not yet come," and His equipment
	for that was not complete; for He had yet to "increase in
	wisdom" as well as "stature" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). In fact, the beauty of Christ's example lies very much in
	His never at one stage of His life anticipating the duties of
	another. All would be in the style and manner of a learner, "opening
	His mouth and panting." "His soul breaking for the longing
	that it had unto God's judgments at all times" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and now more than ever before, when finding Himself for
	the first time in His Father's house. Still there would be in <i>His
	questions</i> far more than in <i>their answers;</i> and if we may
	take the frivolous interrogatories with which they afterwards plied
	Him, about the woman that had seven husbands and such like, as a
	specimen of their present drivelling questions, perhaps we shall not
	greatly err, if we suppose that "the questions" which He
	now "asked them" in return were just the germs of those
	pregnant questions with which He astonished and silenced them in
	after years: "<i>What think ye of Christ? Whose Son is He? If
	David call Him Lord, how is He then his Son?</i>" "<i>Which
	is the first and great commandment?</i>" "<i>Who is my
	neighbour?</i>"</p>
