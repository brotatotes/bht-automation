<p><b>49. about my Father's
	business</b>—literally, "in" or "at My Fathers,"
	that is, either "about My Father's <i>affairs,</i>" or "in
	My Father's <i>courts</i>"—where He dwells and is to be
	found—<i>about His hand,</i> so to speak. This latter shade of
	meaning, which includes the former, is perhaps the true one, Here He
	felt Himself <i>at home,</i> breathing His own proper air. His words
	convey a gentle rebuke of their obtuseness in requiring Him to
	<i>explain this.</i> "Once here, thought ye I should so readily
	hasten away? Let ordinary worshippers be content to keep the feast
	and be gone; but is this all ye have learnt of Me?" Methinks we
	are here let into the holy privacies of Nazareth; for what He says
	they <i>should</i> have known, He must have given them <i>ground</i>
	to know. She tells Him of the sorrow with which <i>His father</i> and
	she had sought Him. He speaks of <i>no Father but one,</i> saying, in
	effect, My Father has <i>not</i> been seeking Me; I have been with
	Him all this time; "the King hath brought me into His chambers .
	. . His left hand is under my head, and His right hand doth embrace
	me" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+1:4">Song of Solomon 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+2:6">Song of Solomon 2:6</span>).
