	He had never expressly said as much, and so confounded them,
	though it was but the true interpretation of many things which they
	had seen and heard from Him at home. (See on  :-.) But lest it should be thought that now He threw off the
	filial yoke, and became His own Master henceforth, and theirs too, it
	is purposely added, "And He went down with them, and was
	subject unto them." The marvel of this condescension lies
	in its coming after such a scene, and such an assertion of His higher
	Sonship; and the words are evidently meant to convey this. "From
	this time we have no more mention of Joseph. The next we hear
	is of his "mother and brethren" ( :-); whence it is inferred, that between this time and the
	commencement of our Lord's public life, Joseph died"
	[ALFORD], having now
	served the double end of being the protector of our Lord's
	Virgin—mother, and affording Himself the opportunity of presenting
	a matchless pattern of subjection to both parents.
