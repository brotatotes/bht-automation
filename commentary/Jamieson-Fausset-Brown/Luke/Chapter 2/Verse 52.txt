	lively oracles, and holy fellowship with His Father; what inlettings,
	on the one hand, of light, and love, and power from on high, and
	outgoings of filial supplication, freedom, love, and joy on the
	other, would these eighteen years contain! And would they not seem
	"but a few days" if they were so passed, however ardently
	He might long to be more directly "about His Father's business?"</p>
