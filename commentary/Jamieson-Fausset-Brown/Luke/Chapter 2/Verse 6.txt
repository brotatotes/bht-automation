<p><b>6. while they were there, the days
	were accomplished that she should be delivered</b>—Mary had up to
	this time been living at the wrong place for Messiah's birth. A
	little longer stay at Nazareth, and the prophecy would have failed.
	But lo! with no intention certainly on her part, much less of Cæsar
	Augustus, to fulfil the prophecy, she is brought from Nazareth to
	Bethlehem, and at that nick of time her period arrives, and her Babe
	is born (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:23">Psalms 118:23</span>). "Every
	creature walks blindfold; only He that dwells in light knows whether
	they go" [BISHOP
	HALL].</p>
