	mother herself did so. Had she then none to help her? It would seem
	so (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>).

<p><b>a manger</b>—the manger,
	the bench to which the horses' heads were tied, on which their food
	could rest [WEBSTER and
	WILKINSON]. 
	</p>
<p><b>no room in the inn</b>—a
	square erection, open inside, where travellers put up, and whose rear
	parts were used as stables. The ancient tradition, that our Lord was
	born in a grotto or cave, is quite consistent with this, the country
	being rocky. In Mary's condition the journey would be a slow one, and
	ere they arrived, the inn would be fully occupied—affecting
	anticipation of the reception He was throughout to meet with (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:9- :">2 Corinthians 8:9- :</span>).
