<p><b>16. He shall come,</b> &amp;c.—This
	answer was given by the Pharisees themselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), thus pronouncing their own righteous doom. Matthew alone
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:43">Matthew 21:43</span>) gives the naked
	application, that "the kingdom of God should be taken from them,
	and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof"—the
	great evangelical community of the faithful, chiefly Gentiles.

<p><b>God forbid</b>—His whole
	meaning now bursting upon them.</p>
