17-19. written—(in Psalms 118:22;
	Psalms 118:23. See on Psalms 118:23- :). The Kingdom of God is here a Temple, in the erection of
	which a certain stone, rejected as unsuitable by the spiritual
	builders, is, by the great Lord of the House, made the keystone of
	the whole. On that Stone the builders were now "falling"
	and being "broken" (Psalms 118:23- :), "sustaining great spiritual hurt; but soon that Stone
	should fall upon them and grind them to powder" (Daniel 2:34;
	Daniel 2:35; Zechariah 12:3)
	—in their corporate capacity in the tremendous destruction
	of Jerusalem, but personally, as unbelievers, in a more awful
	sense still.
