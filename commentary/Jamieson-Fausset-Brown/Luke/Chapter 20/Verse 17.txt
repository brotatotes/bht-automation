	which <i>a certain stone,</i> rejected as unsuitable by the spiritual
	builders, is, by the great Lord of the House, made the keystone of
	the whole. On that Stone the builders were now "falling"
	and being "broken" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:23- :">Psalms 118:23- :</span>), "sustaining great spiritual hurt; but soon that Stone
	should fall upon <i>them</i> and grind them to powder" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:34">Daniel 2:34</span>;

	of Jerusalem, but <i>personally,</i> as unbelievers, in a more awful
	sense still.</p>
