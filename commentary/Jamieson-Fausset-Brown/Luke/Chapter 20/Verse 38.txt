<p><b>38. not . . . of the dead, . . . for
	all,</b> c.â€”To God, no human being is dead, or ever will be but all
	sustain an abiding conscious relation to Him. But the "all"
	here meant "those who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that
	world." These <i>sustain a gracious covenant relation to God,
	which cannot be dissolved.</i> In this sense our Lord affirms that
	for Moses to call the Lord the "God" of His patriarchal
	servants if at that moment they had no existence, would be unworthy
	of Him. He "would be <i>ashamed</i> to be called their God, if
	He had not prepared for them a city" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). How precious are these glimpses of the <i>resurrection
	state!</i></p>
