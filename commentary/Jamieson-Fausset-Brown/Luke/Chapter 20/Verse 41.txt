	be]? They say unto Him, The son of David. He saith unto them, How
	then doth David in spirit [by the Holy Ghost, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>] call Him Lord?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:42">Matthew 22:42</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:43">Matthew 22:43</span>). The difficulty can
	only be solved by the <i>higher</i> and <i>lower</i>—the <i>divine</i>
	and <i>human</i> natures of our Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:43- :">Matthew 22:43- :</span>). Mark the testimony here given to the <i>inspiration</i> of
