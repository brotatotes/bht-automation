<p><b>18. not a hair . . . perish</b>—He
	had just said (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:16">Luke 21:16</span>) they
	should be <i>put to death;</i> showing that this precious promise is
	far above immunity from mere bodily harm, and furnishing a key to the
	right interpretation of the ninety-first Psalm, and such like.
	Matthew adds the following (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:16- :">Luke 21:16- :</span>): "And because iniquity shall abound, the love of
	many," the many or, the most—the generality of professed
	disciples—"shall wax cold." But he that endureth to the
	end shall be saved. Sad illustrations of the effect of abounding
	iniquity in cooling the love of faithful disciples we have in the
	<i>Epistle of James,</i> written about this period referred to, and
	too frequently ever since (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:38">Hebrews 10:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+10:39">Hebrews 10:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10">Revelation 2:10</span>).
	"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
	world for a witness, and then shall the end come" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:10- :">Revelation 2:10- :</span>). God never sends judgment without previous warning; and
	there can be no doubt that the Jews, already dispersed over most
	known countries, had nearly all heard the Gospel "as a witness,"
	before the end of the Jewish state. The same principle was repeated
	and will repeat itself to <i>the</i> end.</p>
