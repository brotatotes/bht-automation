	tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world, nor
	ever shall be"—language not unusual in the Old Testament for
	tremendous calamities, though of this it may perhaps be literally
	said, "And except those days should be shortened, there should
	no flesh be saved, but for the elect's sake those days shall be
	shortened" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:21">Matthew 24:21</span>;

	"shortening," brought about by a remarkable concurrence of
	causes, the whole nation would have perished, in which there yet
