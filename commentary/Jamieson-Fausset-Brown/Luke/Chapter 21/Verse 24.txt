	have had their <i>full time</i> of that place in the Church which the
	Jews in <i>their time</i> had before them—after which, the Jews
	being again "grafted into their own olive tree," one Church
	of Jew and Gentile together shall fill the earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). What a vista this opens up!</p>
