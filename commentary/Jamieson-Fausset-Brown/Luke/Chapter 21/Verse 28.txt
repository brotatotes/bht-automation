<p><b>28. redemption</b>â€”from the
	oppression of ecclesiastical despotism and legal bondage by the total
	subversion of the Jewish state and the firm establishment of the
	evangelical kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:31">Luke 21:31</span>).
	But the words are of far wider and more precious import. Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:31- :">Luke 21:31- :</span>) says, "And then shall appear <i>the sign</i> of the
	Son of man in heaven," evidently something distinct from
	Himself, mentioned immediately after. What this was intended to mean,
	interpreters are not agreed. But as before Christ came to destroy
	Jerusalem, some appalling portents were seen in the air, so before
	His personal appearing it is likely that something <i>analogous</i>
	will be witnessed, though of what nature it is vain to conjecture.</p>
