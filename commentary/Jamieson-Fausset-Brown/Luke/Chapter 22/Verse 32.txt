32. But I have prayed—have
	been doing it already. 
	for thee—as most in
	danger. (See on Luke 22:2.) 
	fail not—that is,
	entirely; for partially it did fail. 
	converted—brought back
	afresh as a penitent disciple. 
	strengthen, &c.—that
	is, make use of thy bitter experience for the fortifying of thy
	tempted brethren.
