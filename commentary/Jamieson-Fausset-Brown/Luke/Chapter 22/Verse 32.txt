<p><b>32. But I have prayed</b>—have
	been doing it already. 
	</p>
<p><b>for thee</b>—as most in
	danger. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:2">Luke 22:2</span>.) 
	</p>
<p><b>fail not</b>—that is,
	entirely; for partially it did fail. 
	</p>
<p><b>converted</b>—brought back
	afresh as a penitent disciple. 
	</p>
<p><b>strengthen,</b> &amp;c.—that
	is, make use of thy bitter experience for the fortifying of thy
	tempted brethren.</p>
