33. I am ready,
	c.â€”honest-hearted, warmly-attached disciple, thinking thy present
	feelings immovable as a rock, thou shalt find them in the hour of
	temptation unstable as water: "I have been praying for thee,"
	therefore thy faith shall not perish but thinking this superfluous,
	thou shalt find that "he that trusteth in his own heart is a
	fool" (Proverbs 28:26).
