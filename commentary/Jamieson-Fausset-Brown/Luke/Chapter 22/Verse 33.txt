<p><b>33. I am ready,</b>
	c.â€”honest-hearted, warmly-attached disciple, thinking thy present
	feelings immovable as a rock, thou shalt find them in the hour of
	temptation unstable as water: "I have been praying for thee,"
	therefore thy faith shall not perish but thinking this superfluous,
	thou shalt find that "he that trusteth in his own heart is a
	fool" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+28:26">Proverbs 28:26</span>).</p>
