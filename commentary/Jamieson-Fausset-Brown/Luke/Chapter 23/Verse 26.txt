<p><b>26. Cyrenian</b>—of Cyrene, in
	Libya, on the north coast of Africa, where were many Jews who had a
	synagogue at Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:9">Acts 6:9</span>,
	and see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:10">Acts 2:10</span>). He was "the
	father of Alexander and Rufus" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+2:10- :">Acts 2:10- :</span>), probably better known afterwards than himself, as
	disciples. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:13">Romans 16:13</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>out of the country</b>—and
	casually drawn into that part of the crowd. 
	</p>
<p><b>laid the cross</b>—"Him
	they compel to bear His cross," (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:13- :">Romans 16:13- :</span>) —sweet compulsion, if it issued in him or his sons
	<i>voluntarily</i> "taking up <i>their</i> cross!" It would
	appear that our Lord had first to bear His own cross (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:13- :">Romans 16:13- :</span>), but being from exhaustion unable to proceed, it was laid
	on another to bear it "after Him."</p>
