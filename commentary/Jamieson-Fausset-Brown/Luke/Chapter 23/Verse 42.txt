<p><b>42. said unto Jesus,</b> c.—Observe
	here (1) The "kingdom" referred to was one <i>beyond the
	grave</i> for it is inconceivable that he should have expected Him to
	come down from the cross to erect any <i>temporal</i> kingdom. (2)
	This he calls Christ's own (Thy) kingdom. (3) As such, he sees in
	Christ the absolute right to dispose of that kingdom to whom He
	pleased. (4) He does not presume to <i>ask</i> a place in that
	kingdom, though that is what he means, but with a humility quite
	affecting, just says, "Lord, <i>remember me</i> when," &amp;c.
	Yet was there mighty faith in that word. If Christ will but "think
	upon him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ne+5:19">Nehemiah 5:19</span>), at
	that august moment when He "cometh into His kingdom," it
	will do. "Only assure me that then Thou wilt not forget such a
	wretch as I, that once hung by Thy side, and I am content." Now
	contrast with this bright act of faith the darkness even of the
	apostles' minds, who could hardly be got to believe that their Master
	would die at all, who now were almost despairing of Him, and who when
	dead had almost buried their hopes in His grave. Consider, too, the
	man's previous <i>disadvantages</i> and <i>bad life.</i> And then
	mark how his faith comes out—not in protestations, "Lord, I
	cannot doubt, I am firmly persuaded that Thou art Lord of a kingdom,
	that death cannot disannul Thy title nor impede the assumption of it
	in due time," &amp;c.—but as having no shadow of doubt, and
	rising above it as a question altogether, he just says, "Lord,
	remember me <i>when</i> Thou comest," &amp;c. Was ever faith
	like this exhibited upon earth? It looks as if the brightest crown
	had been reserved for the Saviour's head at His darkest moment!</p>
