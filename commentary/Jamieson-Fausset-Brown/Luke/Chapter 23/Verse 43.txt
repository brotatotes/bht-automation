<p><b>43. Jesus said,</b> c.—The dying
	Redeemer speaks as if He Himself viewed it in this light. It was a
	"song in the night." It ministered cheer to His spirit in
	the midnight gloom that now enwrapt it.

<p><b>Verily I say unto thee</b>—"Since
	thou speakest as to the king, with kingly authority speak I to thee."
	</p>
<p><b>To-day</b>—"Thou art
	prepared for a long delay before I come into My kingdom, but not a
	day's delay shall there be for thee thou shalt not be parted from Me
	even for a moment, but together we shall go, and with Me, ere this
	day expire, shalt thou be in Paradise" (future bliss, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+12:4">2 Corinthians 12:4</span>;
