<p><b>21. we trusted,</b> c.—They
	expected the promised Deliverance at His hand, but in the current
	sense of it, not by His death.

<p><b>besides all this</b>—not
	only did His death seem to give the fatal blow to their hopes, but He
	had been two days dead already, and this was the third. It is true,
	they add, some of our women gave us a surprise, telling us of a
	vision of angels they had at the empty grave this morning that said
	He was alive, and some of ourselves who went thither confirmed their
	statement but then Himself they saw not. A doleful tale truly, told
	out of the deepest despondency.</p>
