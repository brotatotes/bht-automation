29. constrained, c.â€”But for
	this, the whole design of the interview had been lost but it was
	not to be lost, for He who only wished to be constrained had
	kindled a longing in the hearts of His travelling companions which
	was not to be so easily put off. And does not this still repeat
	itself in the interviews of the Saviour with His loving, longing
	disciples? Else why do they say, 
	 Abide with me from
	morn to eve, 
	 For without Thee I cannot
	live; 
	 Abide with me when night
	is nigh, 
	 For without Thee I cannot
	die.
