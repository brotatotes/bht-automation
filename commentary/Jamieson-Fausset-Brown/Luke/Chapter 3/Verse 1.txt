<p><b>1, 2.</b> Here the curtain of the
	New Testament is, as it were, drawn up, and the greatest of all
	epochs of the Church commences. Even our Lord's own age (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) is determined by it [BENGEL].
	No such elaborate chronological precision is to be found elsewhere in
	the New Testament, and it comes fitly from him who claims it as the
	peculiar recommendation of his Gospel, that he had "accurately
	traced down all things from the first" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Here, evidently, commences his proper narrative. Also see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>the fifteenth year of
	Tiberius</b>—reckoning from the period when he was admitted, three
	years before Augustus' death, to a share of the empire [WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON], about the
	end of the year of Rome 779, or about four years before the usual
	reckoning. 
	</p>
<p><b>Pilate . . . governor of
	Judea</b>—His proper title was <i>Procurator,</i> but with more
	than the usual powers of that office. After holding it about ten
	years he was ordered to Rome, to answer to charges brought against
	him, but ere he arrived Tiberius died (A.D.
	35), and soon after Pilate committed suicide. 
	</p>
<p><b>Herod</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Philip</b>—a different and
	very superior Philip to the one whose wife Herodias went to live with
	Herod Antipas. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:17">Mark 6:17</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Iturea</b>—to the northeast
	of Palestine; so called from Ishmael's son <i>Itur</i> or <i>Jetur</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+1:31">1 Chronicles 1:31</span>), and anciently
	belonging to the half tribe of Manasseh. 
	</p>
<p><b>Trachonitis</b>—farther to
	the northeast, between Iturea and Damascus; a rocky district,
	infested by robbers, and committed by Augustus to Herod the Great to
	keep in order. 
	</p>
<p><b>Abilene</b>—still more to
	the northeast, so called from <i>Abila,</i> eighteen miles from
	Damascus [ROBINSON].</p>
