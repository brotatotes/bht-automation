<p><b>14. soldiers . . . Do violence to
	none</b>—The word signifies to "shake thoroughly," and so
	to "intimidate," probably in order to extort money or other
	property. (Also see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.) 
	</p>
<p><b>accuse . . . falsely</b>—acting
	as informers vexatiously, on frivolous or false grounds. 
	</p>
<p><b>content with your
	wages</b>—"rations." We may take this as a warning
	against mutiny, which the officers attempted to suppress by largesses
	and donations [WEBSTER and
	WILKINSON]. And thus the
	"fruits" which would evidence their repentance were just
	resistance to the reigning sins, particularly of the <i>class</i> to
	which the penitent belonged, and the manifestation of an opposite
	spirit.</p>
