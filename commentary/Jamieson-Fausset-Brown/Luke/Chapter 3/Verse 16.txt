16. John answered—either to
	the deputation from Jerusalem (see  :-, &c.), or on some other occasion, simply to remove
	impressions derogatory to his blessed Master which he knew to be
	taking hold of the popular mind. (Also see on  :-.) 
	saying unto them
	all—in solemn protestation. So far from entertaining such a
	thought as laying claim to the honors of Messiahship, the meanest
	services I can render to that "Mightier than I that is coming
	after me," are too high an honor for me. Beautiful spirit,
	distinguishing this servant of Christ throughout! 
	one mightier than I—"the
	Mighter than I."
