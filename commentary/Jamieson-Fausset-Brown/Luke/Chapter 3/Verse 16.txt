<p><b>16. John answered</b>—either to
	the deputation from Jerusalem (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, &amp;c.), or on some other occasion, simply to remove
	impressions derogatory to his blessed Master which he knew to be
	taking hold of the popular mind. (Also see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.)

<p><b>saying unto </b><i><b>them</b></i><b>
	all</b>—in solemn protestation. So far from entertaining such a
	thought as laying claim to the honors of Messiahship, the meanest
	services I can render to that "Mightier than I that is coming
	after me," are too high an honor for me. Beautiful spirit,
	distinguishing this servant of Christ throughout!

<p><b>one mightier than I</b>—"the
