2. Annas and Caiaphas . . . high
	priests—the former, though deposed, retained much of his
	influence, and, probably, as sagan or deputy, exercised much
	of the power of the high priesthood along with Caiaphas (John 18:13;
	Acts 4:6). Both Zadok and Abiathar
	acted as high priests in David's time (Acts 4:6- :), and it seems to have become the fixed practice to have
	two (2 Kings 25:18). (Also see on
	2 Kings 25:18- :.) 
	word of God came unto
	John—Such formulas, of course, are never used when
	speaking of Jesus, because the divine nature manifested itself in
	Him not at certain isolated moments of His life. He was the one
	everlasting manifestation of the Godhead—THE
	WORD [OLSHAUSEN].
