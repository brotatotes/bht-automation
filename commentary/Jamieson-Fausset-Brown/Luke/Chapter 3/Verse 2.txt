<p><b>2. Annas and Caiaphas . . . high
	priests</b>—the former, though deposed, retained much of his
	influence, and, probably, as <i>sagan</i> or deputy, exercised much
	of the power of the high priesthood along with Caiaphas (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:6">Acts 4:6</span>). Both Zadok and Abiathar
	acted as high priests in David's time (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+4:6- :">Acts 4:6- :</span>), and it seems to have become the fixed practice to have
	two (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+25:18">2 Kings 25:18</span>). (Also see on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+25:18- :">2 Kings 25:18- :</span>.)

<p><b>word of God came unto
	John</b>—<i>Such formulas,</i> of course, <i>are never used when
	speaking of Jesus,</i> because the divine nature manifested itself in
	Him not at certain isolated moments of His life. <i>He was the one
	everlasting manifestation of the Godhead</i>—THE
	WORD [OLSHAUSEN].</p>
