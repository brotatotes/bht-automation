	ENTERING ON HIS

<p><i>Note.</i>—A large gap here
	occurs, embracing the important transactions in Galilee and Jerusalem
	which are recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and which occurred <i>before</i> John's imprisonment
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:24">John 3:24</span>); whereas the
	transactions here recorded occurred (as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:12">Matthew 4:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:13">Matthew 4:13</span>) <i>after</i> that
	event. The visit to Nazareth recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:13- :">Matthew 4:13- :</span> (and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:1-6">Mark 6:1-6</span>)
	we take to be not a later visit, but the same with this first one;
	because we cannot think that the Nazarenes, after being so enraged at
	His <i>first</i> display of wisdom as to attempt His destruction,
	should, on a <i>second</i> display of the same, wonder at it and ask
	how He came by it, as if they had never witnessed it before.</p>
