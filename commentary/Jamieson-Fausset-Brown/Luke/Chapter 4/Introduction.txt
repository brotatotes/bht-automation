 CHAPTER 4 
	
 :-. TEMPTATION OF
	CHRIST. 
	(See on  :-.) 
	 :-. JESUS
	ENTERING ON HIS
	PUBLIC MINISTRY,
	MAKES A CIRCUIT
	OF GALILEE—REJECTION
	AT NAZARETH. 
	Note.—A large gap here
	occurs, embracing the important transactions in Galilee and Jerusalem
	which are recorded in  :-, and which occurred before John's imprisonment
	(John 3:24); whereas the
	transactions here recorded occurred (as appears from Matthew 4:12;
	Matthew 4:13) after that
	event. The visit to Nazareth recorded in Matthew 4:13- : (and Mark 6:1-6)
	we take to be not a later visit, but the same with this first one;
	because we cannot think that the Nazarenes, after being so enraged at
	His first display of wisdom as to attempt His destruction,
	should, on a second display of the same, wonder at it and ask
	how He came by it, as if they had never witnessed it before.
