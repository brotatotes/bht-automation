19. acceptable yearâ€”an
	allusion to the jubilee year ( :-), a year of universal release for person and
	property. (See also Isaiah 49:8;
	2 Corinthians 6:2.) As the maladies under
	which humanity groans are here set forth under the names of poverty,
	broken-heartedness, bondage, blindness, bruisedness (or
	crushedness), so, as the glorious HEALER
	of all these maladies, Christ announces Himself in the act of reading
	it, stopping the quotation just before it comes to "the day of
	vengeance," which was only to come on the rejecters of His
	message (John 3:17). The first
	words, "THE SPIRIT
	of the LORD is upon ME,"
	have been noted since the days of the Church Fathers, as an
	illustrious example of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost being
	exhibited as in distinct yet harmonious action in the scheme of
	salvation.
