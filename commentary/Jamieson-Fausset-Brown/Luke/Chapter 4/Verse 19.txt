<p><b>19. acceptable year</b>â€”an
	allusion to the jubilee year (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), a year of universal <i>release</i> for person and
	property. (See also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:8">Isaiah 49:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:2">2 Corinthians 6:2</span>.) As the maladies under
	which humanity groans are here set forth under the names of <i>poverty,
	broken-heartedness, bondage, blindness, bruisedness</i> (or
	<i>crushedness</i>), so, as the glorious HEALER
	of all these maladies, Christ announces Himself in the act of reading
	it, stopping the quotation just before it comes to "the day of
	vengeance," which was only to come on the rejecters of His
	message (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:17">John 3:17</span>). The first
	words, "THE SPIRIT
	of the LORD is upon ME,"
	have been noted since the days of the Church Fathers, as an
	illustrious example of <i>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost</i> being
	exhibited as in distinct yet harmonious action in the scheme of
	salvation.</p>
