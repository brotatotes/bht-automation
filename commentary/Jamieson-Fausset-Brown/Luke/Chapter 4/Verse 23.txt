<p><b>23. this proverb</b>—like our
	"Charity begins at home."

<p><b>whatsoever,</b> c.—"Strange
	rumors have reached our ears of Thy doings at Capernaum but if such
	power resides in Thee to cure the ills of humanity, why has none of
	it yet come nearer home, and why is all this alleged power reserved
	for strangers?" His choice of Capernaum as a place of residence
	since entering on public life was, it seems, already well known at
	Nazareth; and when He did come thither, to give no displays of His
	power when distant places were ringing with His fame, wounded their
	pride. He had indeed "laid his hands on a few sick folk and
	healed them" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:5">Mark 6:5</span>); but
	this seems to have been done quite privately the general unbelief
	precluding anything more open.</p>
