<p><b>24. And he said,</b> &amp;c.—He
	replies to the one proverb by another, equally familiar, which we
	express in a rougher form—"Too much familiarity breeds
	contempt." Our Lord's long residence in Nazareth merely as a
	townsman had made Him <i>too common,</i> incapacitating them for
	appreciating Him as others did who were <i>less familiar with His
	everyday demeanor in private life.</i> A most important principle, to
	which the wise will pay due regard. (See also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, on which our Lord Himself ever acted.)</p>
