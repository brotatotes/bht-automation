<p><b>41. suffered them not to speak</b>â€”The
	marginal reading ("to say that they knew him to be Christ")
	here is wrong. Our Lord ever refused testimony from devils, <i>for
	the very reason why they were eager to give it,</i> because He and
	they would thus seem to be one interest, as His enemies actually
	alleged. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, c. see
	also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:16-18">Acts 16:16-18</span>.)
