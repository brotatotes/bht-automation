<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. MIRACULOUS
	DRAUGHT OF FISHESâ€”CALL
	OF PETER, JAMES,
	AND JOHN. 
	</p>
<p>Not their <i>first</i> call,
	however, recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; nor their <i>second,</i> recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; but their <i>third</i> and last before their appointment
	to the apostleship. That these calls were all distinct and
	<i>progressive,</i> seems quite plain. (Similar stages are observable
	in other eminent servants of Christ.)</p>
