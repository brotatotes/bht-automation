 CHAPTER 5 
	
 :-. MIRACULOUS
	DRAUGHT OF FISHESâ€”CALL
	OF PETER, JAMES,
	AND JOHN. 
	Not their first call,
	however, recorded in  :-; nor their second, recorded in  :-; but their third and last before their appointment
	to the apostleship. That these calls were all distinct and
	progressive, seems quite plain. (Similar stages are observable
	in other eminent servants of Christ.)
