<p>The <i>incongruities</i> mentioned
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:36-38">Luke 5:36-38</span> were
	intended to illustrate the difference between the <i>genius</i> of
	the old and new economies, and the danger of <i>mixing up</i> the one
	with the other. As in the one case supposed, "the rent is made
	worse," and in the other, "the new wine is spilled,"
	<i>so by a mongrel mixture of the ascetic ritualism of the old with
	the spiritual freedom of the new economy, both are disfigured and
	destroyed.</i> The additional parable in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:36-42.5.38- :">Luke 5:36-42.5.38- :</span>, which is peculiar to Luke, has been variously interpreted.
	But the "new wine" seems plainly to be the evangelical
	freedom which Christ was introducing; and the old, the opposite
	spirit of Judaism: men long accustomed to the latter could not be
	expected "straightway"—all at once—to take a liking for
	the former; that is, "These inquiries about the difference
	between My disciples and the Pharisees," and even John's, are
	not surprising; they are the effect of <i>a natural revulsion against
	sudden change,</i> which time will cure; <i>the new wine will itself
	in time become old, and so acquire all the added charms of antiquity.</i>
	What lessons does this teach, on the one hand, to those who
	unreasonably cling to what is getting antiquated; and, on the other,
	to hasty reformers who have no patience with the timidity of their
	weaker brethren!</p>
