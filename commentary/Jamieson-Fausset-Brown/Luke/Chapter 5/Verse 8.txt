<p><b>8. Depart,</b> &amp;c.â€”Did Peter
	then wish Christ to leave him? Verily no. His all was wrapt up in Him
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:68">John 6:68</span>). "It was
	rather, Woe is me, Lord! How shall I abide this blaze of glory? A
	sinner such as I am is not fit company for Thee." (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:68- :">John 6:68- :</span>.)</p>
