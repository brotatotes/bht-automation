	rendered "on a level place," that is, a piece of high
	tableland, by which they understand the same thing, as "on the
	mountain," where our Lord delivered the sermon recorded by
	Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>), of which they
	take this following discourse of Luke to be but an abridged form. But
	as the sense given in our version is the more accurate, so there are
	weighty reasons for considering the discourses different. This one
	contains little more than a fourth of the other; it has woes of its
	own, as well as the beatitudes common to both; but above all, that of
	Matthew was plainly delivered a good while <i>before,</i> while this
	was spoken <i>after</i> the choice of the twelve; and as we know that
	our Lord delivered some of His weightiest sayings more than once,
	there is no difficulty in supposing this to be one of His more
	extended repetitions; nor could anything be more worthy of it.</p>
