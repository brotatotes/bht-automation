<p><b>20, 21.</b> In the Sermon on the
	Mount the benediction is pronounced upon the "poor <i>in spirit</i>"
	and those who "hunger and thirst <i>after righteousness</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:3">Matthew 5:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6">Matthew 5:6</span>).
	Here it is simply on the "poor" and the "hungry now."
	In this form of the discourse, then, our Lord seems to have had in
	view "<i>the poor of this world,</i> rich in faith, and heirs of
	the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love Him," as
	these very beatitudes are paraphrased by James (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:6- :">Matthew 5:6- :</span>).</p>
