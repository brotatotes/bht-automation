<p><b>22. separate you</b>—whether from
	their <i>Church,</i> by excommunication, or from their society; both
	hard to flesh and blood.

<p><b>for the Son of man's
	sake</b>—Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:11">Matthew 5:11</span>,
	"for MY SAKE";
	and immediately before, "for <i>righteousness'</i> sake"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:10">Luke 6:10</span>). Christ thus <i>binds
	up the cause of righteousness in the world with the reception of
	Himself.</i></p>
