<p><b>9. good, or . . . evil, save . . .
	or destroy</b>â€”By this novel way of putting His case, our Lord
	teaches the great ethical principle, that <i>to neglect any
	opportunity of doing good is to incur the guilt of doing evil;</i>
	and by this law He bound His own spirit. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.)</p>
