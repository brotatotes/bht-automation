	cross, capricious children, invited by their playmates to join them
	in their amusements, will play with them neither at weddings nor
	funerals (juvenile imitations of the joyous and mournful scenes of
	life), so that generation rejected both John and his Master: the one
	because he was too unsocial—more like a demoniac than a rational
	man the other, because He was too much the reverse, given to animal
	indulgences, and consorting with the lowest classes of society. But
	the children of Wisdom recognize and honor her, whether in the
	austere garb of the Baptist or in the more attractive style of his
	Master, whether in the Law or in the Gospel, whether in rags or in
	royalty, for "<i>the full soul loatheth an honeycomb,</i> but <i>to
	the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
