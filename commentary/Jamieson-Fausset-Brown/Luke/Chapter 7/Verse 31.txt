	indulgences, and consorting with the lowest classes of society. But

	austere garb of the Baptist or in the more attractive style of his
	Master, whether in the Law or in the Gospel, whether in rags or in
	royalty, for "the full soul loatheth an honeycomb, but to
	the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet" ( :-).
