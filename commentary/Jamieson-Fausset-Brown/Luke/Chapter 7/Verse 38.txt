<p><b>began to wash,</b> c.—to
	"water with a shower." The tears, which were quite
	<i>involuntary,</i> poured down in a flood upon His naked feet, as
	she bent down to kiss them and deeming them rather fouled than washed
	by this, she hastened to wipe them off with the only towel she had,
	the long tresses of her own hair, "with which slaves were wont
	to wash their masters' feet" [STIER].

<p><b>kissed</b>—The word
	signifies "to kiss fondly, to caress," or to "kiss
	again and again," which <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> shows is meant here. What prompted this? <i>Much love,
	springing from a sense of much forgiveness.</i> So says He who knew
	her heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:47">Luke 7:47</span>). Where she
	had met with Christ before, or what words of His had brought life to
	her dead heart and a sense of divine pardon to her guilty soul, we
	know not. But probably she was of the crowd of "publicans and
	<i>sinners</i>" whom Incarnate Compassion drew so often around
	Him, and heard from His lips some of those words such as never man
	spake, "Come unto Me, all ye that labour," c. No personal
	interview had up to this time taken place between them but she could
	keep her feelings no longer to herself, and having found her way to
	Him (and entered along with him, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:47- :">Luke 7:47- :</span>), they burst forth in this surpassing yet most artless
	style, as if her whole soul would go out to Him.</p>
