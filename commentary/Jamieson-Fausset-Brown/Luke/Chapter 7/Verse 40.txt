<p><b>40-43.</b> Like Nathan with David,
	our Lord conceals His home thrust under the veil of a parable, and
	makes His host himself pronounce upon the case. The two debtors are
	the woman and Simon; the criminality of the one was <i>ten times</i>
	that of the other (in the proportion of "five hundred" to
	"fifty"); but both being equally insolvent, both are with
	equal frankness forgiven; and Simon is made to own that the greatest
	debtor to forgiving mercy will cling to her Divine Benefactor with
	the deepest gratitude. Does our Lord then admit that Simon was a
	forgiving man? Let us see.</p>
