	common <i>olive oil</i> in contrast with the woman's "ointment"
	or <i>aromatic balsam.</i> What evidence was thus afforded of any
	feeling which forgiveness prompts? Our Lord speaks this with delicate
	politeness, as if <i>hurt</i> at these inattentions of His host,
	which though not <i>invariably</i> shown to guests, were the
	customary marks of studied respect and regard. The inference is
	plain—<i>only one of the debtors was really forgiven,</i> though in
	the first instance, to give room for the play of withheld feelings,
	the forgiveness of both is supposed in the parable.</p>
