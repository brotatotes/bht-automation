<p><b>47. Her sins which are many</b>—"Those
	many sins of hers," our Lord, who admitted how much more she
	owed than the Pharisee, now proclaims in naked terms the forgiveness
	of her guilt. 
	</p>
<p><b>for</b>—not <i>because,</i>
	as if love were the cause of forgiveness, but "inasmuch as,"
	or "in proof of which." The latter clause of the verse, and
	the whole structure of the parable, plainly show this to be the
	meaning. 
	</p>
<p><b>little forgiven . . . loveth
	little</b>—delicately ironical intimation of <i>no love</i> and <i>no
	forgiveness</i> in the present case.</p>
