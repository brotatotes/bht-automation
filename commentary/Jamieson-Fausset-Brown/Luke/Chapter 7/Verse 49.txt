49, 50. they that sat . . . Who is
	this, c.â€”No wonder they were startled to hear One who was
	reclining at the same couch, and partaking of the same hospitalities
	with themselves, assume the awful prerogative of "even forgiving
	sins." But so far from receding from this claim, or softening it
	down, our Lord only repeats it, with two precious additions: one,
	announcing what was the one secret of the "forgiveness" she
	had experienced, and which carried "salvation" in its bosom
	the other, a glorious dismissal of her in that "peace"
	which she had already felt, but is now assured she has His full
	warrant to enjoy! This wonderful scene teaches two very weighty
	truths: (1) Though there be degrees of guilt, insolvency, or
	inability to wipe out the dishonor done to God, is common to all
	sinners. (2) As Christ is the Great Creditor to whom all debt,
	whether great or small, contracted by sinners is owing, so to Him
	belongs the prerogative of forgiving it. This latter truth is
	brought out in the structure and application of the present parable
	as it is nowhere else. Either then Jesus was a blaspheming deceiver,
	or He is God manifest in the flesh.
