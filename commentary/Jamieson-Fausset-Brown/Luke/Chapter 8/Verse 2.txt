<p><b>2. certain women . . . healed,</b>

	their bodies and new life to their souls. Drawn to Him by an
	attraction more than magnetic, they accompany Him on this tour as His
	<i>almoners</i>—ministering unto Him of their substance. Blessed
	Saviour! It melts us to see Thee living upon the love of Thy ransomed
	people. That they bring Thee their poor offerings we wonder not. Thou
	hast sown unto them spiritual things, and they think it, as well they
	might, a small thing that Thou shouldst reap their material things
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:11">1 Corinthians 9:11</span>). But dost Thou take
	it at their hand, and subsist upon it? "Oh, the depth of the
	riches" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33">Romans 11:33</span>) —of
	this poverty of His!

	with the once profligate woman of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:33- :">Romans 11:33- :</span>, and to call all such penitents <i>Magdalenes.</i> The
	mistake has arisen from confounding unhappy demoniacal possession
	with the conscious entertainment of diabolic impurity, or supposing
	the one to have been afflicted as a punishment for the other—for
	which there is not the least scriptural ground.</p>
