<p><b>3. Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's
	steward</b>—If the steward of such a godless, cruel, and licentious
	wretch as Herod Antipas (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, c.) differed greatly from himself, his post would be no
	easy or enviable one. That he was a disciple of Christ is very
	improbable, though he might be favorably disposed towards Him. But
	what we know not of him, and may fear he lacked, we are sure his wife
	possessed. Healed either of "evil spirits" or of some one
	of the "infirmities" here referred to—the ordinary
	diseases of humanity—she joins in the Saviour's train of grateful,
	clinging followers. Of "Susanna," next mentioned, we know
	nothing but the name, and that here only. But her services on this
	memorable occasion have immortalized her name. "Wheresoever this
	gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that
	she hath done," in ministering to the Lord of her substance on
	His Galilean tour, "shall be spoken of as a memorial of her"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+14:9">Mark 14:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>many others</b>—that is,
	many other <i>healed women.</i> What a train! and all ministering
	unto Him of their substance, and He allowing them to do it and
	subsisting upon it! "He who was the support of the spiritual
	life of His people disdained not to be supported by them in the body.
	He was not ashamed to penetrate so far into the depths of poverty as
	to live upon the alms of love. He only fed others miraculously for
	Himself, He lived upon the love of His people. He gave all things to
	men, His brethren, and received all things from them, enjoying
	thereby the pure blessing of love: which is then only perfect when it
	is at the same time both giving and receiving. Who could invent such
	things as these? <i>It was necessary to live in this manner that it
	might be so recorded</i>" [OLSHAUSEN].
