46. Somebody hath touched—yes,
	the multitude "thronged" and pressed
	Him—"they jostled against Him," but all
	involuntarily; they were merely carried along; but one, one
	only—"Somebody TOUCHED"
	HIM, with the conscious,
	voluntary, dependent touch of faith, reaching forth its hands
	expressly to have contact with Him. This and this only Jesus
	acknowledges and seeks out. Even so, as the Church Father AUGUSTINE
	long ago said, multitudes still come similarly close to Christ in
	the means of grace, but all to no purpose, being only sucked into the
	crowd. The voluntary, living contact of faith is that electric
	conductor which alone draws virtue out of Him.
