24. will save—"Is minded
	to save," bent on saving. The pith of this maxim depends—as
	often in such weighty sayings (for example, "Let the dead
	bury the dead,"  :-) —on the double sense attached to the word "life,"
	a lower and a higher, the natural and the spiritual, temporal and
	eternal. An entire sacrifice of the lower, or a willingness to make
	it, is indispensable to the preservation of the higher life; and he
	who cannot bring himself to surrender the one for the sake of the
	other shall eventually lose both.
