<p><b>26. ashamed of me, and of my
	words</b>—The sense of <i>shame</i> is one of the strongest in our
	nature, one of the social affections founded on our love of
	<i>reputation,</i> which causes instinctive aversion to what is
	fitted to lower it, and was given us as a preservative from all that
	is properly <i>shameful.</i> When one is, in this sense of it, <i>lost
	to shame,</i> he is nearly past hope (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+3:5">Zechariah 3:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+6:15">Jeremiah 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:3">Jeremiah 3:3</span>).
	But when Christ and "His words"—Christianity, especially
	in its more spiritual and uncompromising features—are unpopular,
	the same instinctive desire to <i>stand well with others</i> begets
	the temptation to be ashamed of Him, which only the 'expulsive power'
	of a higher affection can effectually counteract.

<p><b>Son of man be ashamed, when
	he cometh,</b> c.—He will render to that man his own treatment He
	will disown him before the most august of all assemblies, and put him
	to "<i>shame</i> and everlasting <i>contempt</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+3:3- :">Jeremiah 3:3- :</span>). "Oh shame, to be put to shame before God, Christ, and
	angels!" [BENGEL].</p>
