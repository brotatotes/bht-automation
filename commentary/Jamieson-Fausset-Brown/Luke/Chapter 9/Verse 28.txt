<p><b>28. an eight days after these
	sayings</b>—including the day on which this was spoken and that of
	the Transfiguration. Matthew and Mark say (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+17:1">Matthew 17:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:2">Mark 9:2</span>) "after six days,"
	<i>excluding</i> these two days. As the "sayings" so
	definitely connected with the transfiguration scene are those
	announcing His <i>death</i>—at which Peter and all the Twelve were
	so startled and scandalized—so this scene was designed to show to
	the eyes as well as the heart how <i>glorious</i> that death was in
	the view of Heaven.

	cryings and tears?" Methinks, as I steal by His side, I hear
	from Him these plaintive sounds, "Lord, who hath believed Our
	report? I am come unto Mine own and Mine own receive Me not; I am
	become a stranger unto My brethren, an alien to My mother's children:
	Consider Mine enemies, for they are many, and they hate Me with cruel
	hatred. Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail. Thou that dwellest
	between the cherubim, shine forth: Show Me a token for good: Father,
	glorify Thy name."</p>
