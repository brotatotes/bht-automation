<p><b>29. as he prayed, the fashion,</b>
	c.—Before He cried He was answered, and while He was yet speaking
	He was heard. Blessed interruption to prayer this! Thanks to God,
	transfiguring manifestations are not quite strangers here. Ofttimes
	in the deepest depths, out of groanings which cannot be uttered,
	God's dear children are suddenly transported to a kind of heaven upon
	earth, and their soul is made as the chariots of Amminadab. Their
	prayers fetch down such light, strength, holy gladness, as make their
	face to shine, putting a kind of celestial radiance upon it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:29-35">Exodus 34:29-35</span>).

<p><b>raiment white,</b> c.—Matthew
	says, "His face did shine as the sun" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:29-2.34.35- :">Exodus 34:29-2.34.35- :</span>), and Mark says (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:3">Mark 9:3</span>),
	"His raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow, so as no
	fuller on earth can white them" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:3- :">Mark 9:3- :</span>). The light, then, it would seem, shone not <i>upon</i> Him
	<i>from without,</i> but <i>out of</i> Him <i>from within</i> He was
	all irradiated, was in one blaze of celestial glory. What a contrast
	to that "visage more marred than men, and His form than the sons
	of men!" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+52:14">Isaiah 52:14</span>).</p>
