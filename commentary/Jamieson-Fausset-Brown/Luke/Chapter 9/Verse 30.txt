<p><b>30, 31. there talked with him two
	men . . . Moses and Elias . . . appeared in glory</b>â€”"Who
	would have believed these were not <i>angels</i> had not their <i>human</i>
	names been subjoined?" [BENGEL].
	(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:10">Acts 1:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:5">Mark 16:5</span>).
	Moses represented "the law," Elijah "the prophets,"
	and both together the whole testimony of the Old Testament
	Scriptures, and the Old Testament saints, to Christ; now not borne in
	a <i>book,</i> but by <i>living men,</i> not to a <i>coming,</i> but
	a <i>come</i> Messiah, <i>visibly,</i> for they "appeared,"
	and <i>audibly,</i> for they "spake."</p>
