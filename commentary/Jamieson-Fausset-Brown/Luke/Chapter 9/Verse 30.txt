	men . . . Moses and Elias . . . appeared in gloryâ€”"Who
	would have believed these were not angels had not their human
	names been subjoined?" [BENGEL].
	(Compare Acts 1:10; Mark 16:5).
	Moses represented "the law," Elijah "the prophets,"
	and both together the whole testimony of the Old Testament
	Scriptures, and the Old Testament saints, to Christ; now not borne in
	a book, but by living men, not to a coming, but
	a come Messiah, visibly, for they "appeared,"
	and audibly, for they "spake."
