<p><b>32. and when they were awake</b>—so,
	certainly, the most commentators: but if we translate literally, it
	should be "<i>but having kept awake</i>" [MEYER,
	ALFORD]. Perhaps "<i>having
	roused themselves up</i>" [OLSHAUSEN]
	may come near enough to the literal sense; but from the word used we
	can gather no more than that they <i>shook off their drowsiness.</i>
	It was night, and the Lord seems to have spent the whole night on the
	mountain (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:37">Luke 9:37</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>saw his glory,</b> &amp;c.—The
	emphasis lies on "<i>saw,</i>" qualifying them to become
	"<i>eye-witnesses</i> of His majesty" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:37- :">Luke 9:37- :</span>).</p>
