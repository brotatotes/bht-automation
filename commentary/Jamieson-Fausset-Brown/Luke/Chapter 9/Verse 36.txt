36. Jesus was found alone—Moses
	and Elias are gone. Their work is done, and they have disappeared
	from the scene, feeling no doubt with their fellow servant the
	Baptist, "He must increase, but I must decrease." The cloud
	too is gone, and the naked majestic Christ, braced in spirit, and
	enshrined in the reverent affection of His disciples, is left—to
	suffer! 
	kept it close—feeling,
	for once at least, that such things were unmeet as yet for the
	general gaze.
