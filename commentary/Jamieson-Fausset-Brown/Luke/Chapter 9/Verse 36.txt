<p><b>36. Jesus was found alone</b>—Moses
	and Elias are gone. Their work is done, and they have disappeared
	from the scene, feeling no doubt with their fellow servant the
	Baptist, "He must increase, but I must decrease." The cloud
	too is gone, and the naked majestic Christ, braced in spirit, and
	enshrined in the reverent affection of His disciples, is left—to
	suffer! 
	</p>
<p><b>kept it close</b>—feeling,
	for once at least, that such things were unmeet as yet for the
	general gaze.
