<p><b>49, 50. John answered,</b> &amp;c.—The
	link of connection here with the foregoing context lies in the words
	"in My name" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:48">Luke 9:48</span>).
	"Oh, as to that," said John, young, warm, but not
	sufficiently apprehending Christ's teaching in these things, "we
	saw one casting out devils in Thy name, and we forbade him: Were we
	wrong?" "Ye were wrong." "But we did because he
	followeth not us,'" "No matter. For (1) There is no man
	which shall do a miracle in My name that can lightly [soon] speak
	evil of Me' [<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:39">Mark 9:39</span>]. And (2)
	If such a person cannot be supposed to be '<i>against</i> us,' you
	are to consider him '<i>for</i> us.'" Two principles of immense
	importance. Christ does not say this man should <i>not</i> have
	followed "with them," but simply teaches how he was to be
	regarded <i>though he did not</i>—as a reverer of His name and a
	promoter of His cause. Surely this condemns not only those horrible
	attempts <i>by force</i> to shut up all within one visible pale of
	discipleship, which have deluged Christendom with blood in Christ's
	name, but the same spirit in its milder form of proud ecclesiastic
	scowl upon all who "after the form which they call <i>a sect</i>
	(as the word signifies, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14">Acts 24:14</span>),
	do so worship the God of their fathers." Visible unity in
	Christ's Church is devoutly to be sought, but this is not the way to
	it. <i>See the noble spirit of Moses</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:14- :">Acts 24:14- :</span>).

	OF HIS ASSUMPTION
	APPROACHING CHRIST
	TAKES HIS
	LAST LEAVE
	OF GALILEE—THE
	SAMARITANS REFUSE
	TO RECEIVE HIM.</p>
