<p><b>54. James and John</b>—not <i>Peter,</i>
	as we should have expected, but those "<i>sons of thunder</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:17">Mark 3:17</span>), who afterwards
	wanted to have all the highest honors of the Kingdom to themselves,
	and the younger of whom had been rebuked already for his
	exclusiveness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:49">Luke 9:49</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:50">Luke 9:50</span>).
	Yet this was "the disciple whom Jesus loved," while the
	other willingly drank of His Lord's bitter cup. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:50- :">Luke 9:50- :</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:50- :">Luke 9:50- :</span>). That
	same fiery zeal, in a mellowed and hallowed form, in the beloved
	disciple, we find in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+5:10">2 John 5:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:10">3 John 1:10</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>fire . . . as Elias</b>—a
	plausible case, occurring also in <i>Samaria</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="3jo+1:10- :">3 John 1:10- :</span>).</p>
