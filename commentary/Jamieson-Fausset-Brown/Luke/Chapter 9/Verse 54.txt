54. James and John—not Peter,
	as we should have expected, but those "sons of thunder"
	(Mark 3:17), who afterwards
	wanted to have all the highest honors of the Kingdom to themselves,
	and the younger of whom had been rebuked already for his
	exclusiveness (Luke 9:49; Luke 9:50).
	Yet this was "the disciple whom Jesus loved," while the
	other willingly drank of His Lord's bitter cup. (See on Luke 9:50- :; and Luke 9:50- :). That
	same fiery zeal, in a mellowed and hallowed form, in the beloved
	disciple, we find in 2 John 5:10;
	3 John 1:10. 
	fire . . . as Elias—a
	plausible case, occurring also in Samaria (3 John 1:10- :).
