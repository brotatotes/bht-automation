<p><b>61. I will follow . . . but</b>—The
	second disciple had a "but" too—a difficulty in the way
	just then. Yet the different <i>treatment</i> of the two cases shows
	how different was the <i>spirit</i> of the two, and to that our Lord
	addressed Himself. The case of Elisha (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), though <i>apparently</i> similar to this, will be
	found quite different from the "looking back" of this case,
	the best illustration of which is that of <i>those Hindu converts of
	our day who, when once persuaded to leave their spiritual fathers in
	order to "bid them farewell which are at home at their house,"
	very rarely return to them.</i> (Also see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.)</p>
