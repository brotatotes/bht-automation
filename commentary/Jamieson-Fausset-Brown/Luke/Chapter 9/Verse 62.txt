62. No man, c.â€”As ploughing
	requires an eye intent on the furrow to be made, and is marred the
	instant one turns about, so will they come short of salvation who
	prosecute the work of God with a distracted attention, a divided
	heart. Though the reference seems chiefly to ministers, the
	application is general. The expression "looking back" has a
	manifest reference to "Lot's wife" ( :- and see on Luke 9:1).
	It is not actual return to the world, but a reluctance to
	break with it. (Also see on Luke 9:1- :.)
