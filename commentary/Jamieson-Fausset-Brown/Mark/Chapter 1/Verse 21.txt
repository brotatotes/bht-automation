<p><b>21. And they went into
	Capernaum</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>and straightway on the
	sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught</b>—This
	should have been rendered, "straightway on the sabbaths He
	entered into the synagogue and taught," or "continued to
	teach." The meaning is, that as He began this practice on the
	very first sabbath after coming to settle at Capernaum, so He
	continued it regularly thereafter.</p>
