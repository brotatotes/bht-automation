26. And when the unclean spirit had
	torn him—Luke (Luke 4:35)
	says, "When he had thrown him in the midst." Malignant
	cruelty—just showing what he would have done, if permitted
	to go farther: it was a last fling! 
	and cried with a loud
	voice—the voice of enforced submission and despair. 
	he came out of him—Luke
	(Luke 4:35) adds, "and hurt
	him not." Thus impotent were the malignity and rage of the
	impure spirit when under the restraint of "the Stronger than the
	strong one armed" (Luke 11:21;
	Luke 11:22).
