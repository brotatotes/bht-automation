	of Simon and Andrew, with James and John</b>—The mention of these

	the number and names of the witnesses; interesting also as the first
	occasion on which the sacred triumvirate of Peter and James and John
	are selected from among the rest, to be a threefold cord of testimony
	to certain events in their Lord's life (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) —Andrew being present on this occasion, as the occurrence
	took place in his own house.</p>
