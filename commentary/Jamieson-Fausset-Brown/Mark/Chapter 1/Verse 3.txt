<p><b>3. The voice of one crying in the
	wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths
	straight</b>—The second of these quotations is given by Matthew and
	Luke in the same connection, but they reserve the former quotation
	till they have occasion to return to the Baptist, after his
	imprisonment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:10">Matthew 11:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:27">Luke 7:27</span>).
	(Instead of the words, "as it is written in the Prophets,"
	there is weighty evidence in favor of the following reading: "As
	it is written in Isaiah the prophet." This reading is adopted by
	all the latest critical editors. If it be the true one, it is to be
	explained thus—that of the two quotations, the one from Malachi is
	but a later development of the great primary one in Isaiah, from
	which the whole prophetical matter here quoted takes its name. But
	the received text is quoted by IRENÆUS,
	before the end of the second century, and the evidence in its favor
	is greater in <i>amount,</i> if not in weight. The chief objection to
	it is, that if this was the true reading, it is difficult to see how
	the other one could have got in at all; whereas, if it be not the
	true reading, it is very easy to see how it found its way into the
	text, as it removes the startling difficulty of a prophecy beginning
	with the words of Malachi being ascribed to Isaiah.) For the
