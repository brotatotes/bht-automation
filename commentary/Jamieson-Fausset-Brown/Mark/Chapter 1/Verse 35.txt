<p><b>35. And in the morning</b>—that
	is, of the day after this remarkable sabbath; or, <i>on the first day
	of the week.</i> His choosing this day to inaugurate a new and
	glorious stage of His public work, should be noted by the reader.

<p><b>rising up a great while
	before day</b>—"while it was yet night," or long before
	daybreak. 
	</p>
<p><b>he went out</b>—all
	unperceived from Peter's house, where He slept. 
	</p>
<p><b>and departed into a solitary
	place, and there prayed</b>—or, "continued in prayer." He
	was about to begin His first preaching and healing circuit; and as on
	similar solemn occasions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:16">Luke 5:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12">Luke 6:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:18">Luke 9:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:28">Luke 9:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:29">Luke 9:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:46">Mark 6:46</span>), He spent some time in
	special prayer, doubtless with a view to it. What would one not give
	to have been, during the stillness of those grey morning hours,
	within hearing—not of His "strong crying and tears," for
	He had scarce arrived at the stage for that—but of His calm,
	exalted anticipations of the work which lay immediately before Him,
	and the outpourings of His soul about it into the bosom of Him that
	sent Him! He had doubtless enjoyed some uninterrupted hours of such
	communings with His heavenly Father ere His friends from Capernaum
	arrived in search of Him. As for them, they doubtless expected, after
	such a day of miracles, that the next day would witness similar
	manifestations. When morning came, Peter, loath to break in upon the
	repose of his glorious Guest, would await His appearance beyond the
	usual hour; but at length, wondering at the stillness, and gently
	coming to see where the Lord lay, he finds it—like the sepulchre
	afterwards—empty! Speedily a party is made up to go in search of
	Him, Peter naturally leading the way.</p>
