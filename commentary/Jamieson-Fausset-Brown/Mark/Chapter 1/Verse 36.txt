<p><b>36. And Simon and they that were
	with him followed after him</b>â€”rather, "pressed after Him."
	Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:42">Luke 4:42</span>) says, "The
	multitudes sought after Him"; but this would be a party from the
	town. Mark, having his information from Peter himself, speaks only of
	what related directly to him. "They that were with him"
	would probably be Andrew his brother, James and John, with a few
	other choice brethren.</p>
