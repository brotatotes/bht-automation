	him—evidently after some search. 
	they said unto him, All men

	and there learning that Peter and a few more were gone in search of
	Him, had set out on the same errand—would have arrived, and "came
	unto Him and stayed Him, that He should not depart from them"
	(Luke 4:42); all now urging His
	return to their impatient townsmen.
