<p><b>32. And they were in the way</b>—on
	the road. 
	</p>
<p><b>going up to Jerusalem</b>—in
	Perea, and probably somewhere between Ephraim and Jericho, on the
	farther side of the Jordan, and to the northeast of Jerusalem. 
	</p>
<p><b>and Jesus went before them</b>—as
	GROTIUS says, in the style
	of an intrepid Leader. 
	</p>
<p><b>and they were amazed</b>—or
	"struck with astonishment" at His courage in advancing to
	certain death. 
	</p>
<p><b>and as they followed, they
	were afraid</b>—for their own safety. These artless, lifelike
	touches—not only from an eye-witness, but one whom the noble
	carriage of the Master struck with wonder and awe—are peculiar to
	Mark, and give the second Gospel a charm all its own; making us feel
	as if we ourselves were in the midst of the scenes it describes. Well
	might the poet exclaim: 
	</p>
<p align="CENTER"> "The Saviour,
	what a noble flame 
	</p>
<p align="CENTER"> Was kindled in His
	breast, 
	</p>
<p align="CENTER"> When, hasting to
	Jerusalem, 
	</p>
<p align="CENTER"> He march'd before the
	rest!" 
	</p>
<p align="CENTER"> 
	 COWPER 
	</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>And he took again the
	twelve</b>—referring to His previous announcements on this sad
	subject. 
	</p>
<p><b>and began to tell them what
	things should happen unto him</b>—"were going to befall Him."
	The word expresses something already begun but not brought to a head,
	rather than something wholly future.</p>
