<p><b>33. Saying, Behold, we go up to
	Jerusalem</b>—for the last time, and—"all things that are
	written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be
	accomplished" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:31">Luke 18:31</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>the Son of man shall be
	delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes; and they shall
	condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles</b>—This
	is the first express statement that the Gentiles would combine with
	the Jews in His death; the two grand divisions of the human race for
	whom He died thus taking part in crucifying the Lord of Glory, as
	WEBSTER and WILKINSON
	observe.</p>
