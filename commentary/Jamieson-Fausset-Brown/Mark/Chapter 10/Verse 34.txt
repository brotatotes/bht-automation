<p><b>34. And they shall mock him, and
	shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and
	the third day he shall rise again</b>—Singularly explicit as this
	announcement was, Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+18:34">Luke 18:34</span>)
	says "they understood none of these things; and this saying was
	hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken."
	The meaning of the words they could be at no loss to understand, but
	their import in relation to His Messianic kingdom they could not
	penetrate; the whole prediction being right in the teeth of their
	preconceived notions. That they should have clung so tenaciously to
	the popular notion of an "<i>un</i>suffering" Messiah, may
	surprise us; but it gives inexpressible weight to their
	after-testimony to a suffering and dying Saviour.
