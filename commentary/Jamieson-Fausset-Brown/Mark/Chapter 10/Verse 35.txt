<p><b>35. And James and John, the sons of
	Zebedee, come unto him, saying</b>—Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) says their "mother came to Him with her sons,
	worshipping Him and desiring," c. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:56">Matthew 27:56</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:40">Mark 15:40</span>). Salome was her name
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1">Mark 16:1</span>). We cannot be sure
	with which of the parties the movement originated; but as our Lord,
	even in Matthew's account, addresses Himself to James and John,
	taking no account of the mother, it is likely the mother was merely
	set on by them. The thought was doubtless suggested to her sons by
	the recent promise to the Twelve of "thrones to sit on, when the
	Son of man should sit on the throne of His glory" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1- :">Mark 16:1- :</span>); but after the reproof so lately given them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1- :">Mark 16:1- :</span>, &amp;c.) they get their mother to speak for them.

	approaching the subject.</p>
