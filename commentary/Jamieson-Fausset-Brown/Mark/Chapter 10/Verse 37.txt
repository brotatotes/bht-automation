<p><b>37. Grant unto us that we may sit,
	one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy
	glory</b>â€”that is, Assign to us the two places of highest honor in
	the coming kingdom. The semblance of a plea for so presumptuous a
	request might possibly have been drawn from the fact that one of the
	two usually leaned on the breast of Jesus, or sat next Him at meals,
	while the other was one of the favored three.</p>
