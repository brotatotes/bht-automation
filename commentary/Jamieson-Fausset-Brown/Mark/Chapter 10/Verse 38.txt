38. But Jesus said unto them, Ye
	know not what ye ask—How gentle the reply to such a request,
	preferred at such a time, after the sad announcement just made! 
	can ye drink of the cup that
	I drink of?—To "drink of a cup" is in Scripture a
	figure for getting one's fill either of good (Psalms 16:5;
	Psalms 23:5; Psalms 116:13;
	Jeremiah 16:7) or of ill (Psalms 75:8;
	John 18:11; Revelation 14:10).
	Here it is the cup of suffering. 
	and be baptized with the
	baptism that I am baptized with?—(Compare for the language, Revelation 14:10- :). The object of this question seems to have been to try how
	far those two men were capable of the dignity to which they
	aspired and this on the principle that he who is able to suffer most
	for His sake will be the nearest to Him in His kingdom.
