<p><b>38. But Jesus said unto them, Ye
	know not what ye ask</b>—How gentle the reply to such a request,
	preferred at such a time, after the sad announcement just made! 
	</p>
<p><b>can ye drink of the cup that
	I drink of?</b>—To "drink of a cup" is in Scripture a
	figure for getting one's fill either of good (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:5">Psalms 16:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+23:5">Psalms 23:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+116:13">Psalms 116:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+16:7">Jeremiah 16:7</span>) or of ill (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+75:8">Psalms 75:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:11">John 18:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:10">Revelation 14:10</span>).
	Here it is the cup of suffering.

<p><b>and be baptized with the
	baptism that I am baptized with?</b>—(Compare for the language, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:10- :">Revelation 14:10- :</span>). The object of this question seems to have been to try how
	far those two men were <i>capable</i> of the dignity to which they
	aspired and this on the principle that he who is able to suffer most
	for His sake will be the nearest to Him in His kingdom.</p>
