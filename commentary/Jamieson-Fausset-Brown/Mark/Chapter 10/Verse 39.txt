39. And they said unto him, We
	can—Here we see them owning their mother's petition for them as
	their own; and doubtless they were perfectly sincere in professing
	their willingness to follow their Master to any suffering He might
	have to endure. As for James, he was the first of the apostles
	who was honored, and showed himself able to be baptized with his
	Master's baptism of blood (Acts 12:1;
	Acts 12:2); while John,
	after going through all the persecutions to which the infant Church
	was exposed from the Jews, and sharing in the struggles and
	sufferings occasioned by the first triumphs of the Gospel among the
	Gentiles, lived to be the victim, after all the rest had got to
	glory, of a bitter persecution in the evening of his days, for the
	word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. Yes, they were
	dear believers and blessed men, in spite of this unworthy ambition,
	and their Lord knew it; and perhaps the foresight of what they would
	have to pass through, and the courageous testimony He would yet
	receive from them, was the cause of that gentleness which we cannot
	but wonder at in His reproof. 
	And Jesus said unto them, Ye
	shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism
	that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized—No doubt this
	prediction, when their sufferings at length came upon them, cheered
	them with the assurance, not that they would sit on His right and
	left hand—for of that thought they would be heartily ashamed—but
	that "if they suffered with Him, they should be also glorified
	together."
