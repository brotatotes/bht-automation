	began to be much displeased with James and Johnâ€”or "were
	moved with indignation," as the same word is rendered in  :-. The expression "began to be," which is of

	expressed, and that we have but the result. And can we blame the ten
	for the indignation which they felt? Yet there was probably a spice
	of the old spirit of rivalry in it, which in spite of our Lord's
	recent lengthened, diversified, and most solemn warnings against it,
	had not ceased to stir in their breasts.
