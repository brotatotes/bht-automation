45. For even the Son of man came not
	to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom
	for many—"instead of many," that is, "In the
	kingdom about to be set up, this principle shall have no place. All
	My servants shall there be equal; and the only greatness known to it
	shall be the greatness of humility and devotedness to the service of
	others. He that goes down the deepest in these services of
	self-denying humility shall rise the highest and hold the chiefest
	place in that kingdom; even as the Son of man, whose abasement and
	self-sacrifice for others, transcending all, gives Him of right a
	place above all!" As "the Word in the beginning with God,"
	He was ministered unto; and as the risen Redeemer in our
	nature He now is ministered unto, "angels and authorities
	and powers being made subject unto Him" ( :-); but not for this came He hither. The Served of all came to
	be the Servant of all; and His last act was the grandest Service ever
	beheld by the universe of God—"HE
	GAVE HIS
	LIFE A RANSOM
	FOR MANY!", c.
	"Many" is here to be taken, not in contrast with few
	or with all, but in opposition to one—the one Son of
	man for the many sinners.
