11. And Jesus entered into
	Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about
	upon—surveyed. 
	all things, and now the
	eventide was come, he went out into Bethany with the twelve—Thus
	briefly does our Evangelist dispose of this His first day in
	Jerusalem, after the triumphal entry. Nor do the Third and Fourth
	Gospels give us more light. But from Matthew (Matthew 21:10;
	Matthew 21:11; Matthew 21:14-16)
	we learn some additional and precious particulars, for which see on
	Matthew 21:14-40.21.16- :. It was not now safe
	for the Lord to sleep in the city, nor, from the day of His Triumphal
	Entry, did He pass one night in it, save the last fatal one.
