<p><b>12. And on the morrow</b>—The
	Triumphal Entry being on the first day of the week, this following
	day was Monday. 
	</p>
<p><b>when they were come from
	Bethany</b>—"in the morning" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>he was hungry</b>—How was
	that? Had he stolen forth from that dear roof at Bethany to the
	"mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God?"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:12">Luke 6:12</span>); or, "in the
	morning," as on a former occasion, "risen up a great while
	before day, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:35">Mark 1:35</span>); not breaking His
	fast thereafter, but bending His steps straight for the city, that He
	might "work the works of Him that sent Him while it was day?"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+9:4">John 9:4</span>). We know not, though
	one lingers upon and loves to trace out the every movement of that
	life of wonders. One thing, however we are sure of—it was <i>real
	bodily hunger</i> which He now sought to allay by the fruit of this
	fig tree, "if haply He might find any thing thereon"; not a
	mere <i>scene</i> for the purpose of teaching a lesson, as some early
	heretics maintained, and some still seem virtually to hold.</p>
