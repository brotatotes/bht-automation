<p><b>13. And seeing a fig tree</b>—(In
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:19">Matthew 21:19</span>, it is "one fig

	find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but
	leaves for the time of figs was not yet</b>—What the precise import
	of this explanation is, interpreters are not agreed. Perhaps all that
	is meant is, that as the proper fig season had not arrived, no fruit
	would have been expected even of this tree but for the leaves which
	it had, which were in this case prematurely and unnaturally
	developed.</p>
