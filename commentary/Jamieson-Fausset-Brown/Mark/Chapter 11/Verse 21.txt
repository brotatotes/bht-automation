<p><b>21. And Peter calling to remembrance
	saith unto him</b>—satisfied that a miracle so very peculiar—a
	miracle, not of <i>blessing,</i> as all His other miracles, but of
	<i>cursing</i>—could not have been wrought but with some higher
	reference, and fully expecting to hear something weighty on the
	subject. 
	</p>
<p><b>Master, behold, the fig tree
	which thou cursedst is withered away</b>—so connecting the two
	things as to show that he traced the death of the tree entirely to
	the curse of his Lord. Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) gives this simply as a general exclamation of surprise by
	the disciples "how soon" the blight had taken effect.</p>
