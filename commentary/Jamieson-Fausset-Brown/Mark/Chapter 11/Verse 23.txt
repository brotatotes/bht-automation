<p><b>23. For verily I say unto you, That
	whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed . . . he
	shall have whatsoever he saith</b>—Here is the lesson now. From the
	nature of the case supposed—that they might wish a mountain removed
	and cast into the sea, a thing far removed from anything which they
	could be thought actually to desire—it is plain that not physical
	but moral obstacles to the progress of His kingdom were in the
	Redeemer's view, and that what He designed to teach was the great
	lesson, that <i>no obstacle should be able to stand before a
	confiding faith in God.</i></p>
