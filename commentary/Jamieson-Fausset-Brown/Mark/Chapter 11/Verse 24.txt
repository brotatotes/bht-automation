<p><b>24. Therefore I say unto you, What
	things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them,
	and ye shall have them</b>â€”This verse only <i>generalizes</i> the
	assurance of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:23">Mark 11:23</span>; which
	seems to show that it was designed for the special encouragement of
	<i>evangelistic</i> and <i>missionary</i> efforts, while this is a
	directory for prevailing <i>prayer in general.</i></p>
