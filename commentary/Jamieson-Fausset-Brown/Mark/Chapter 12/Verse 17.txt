<p><b>17. And Jesus answering said unto
	them, Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's</b>—Putting it
	in this general form, it was impossible for sedition itself to
	dispute it, and yet it dissolved the snare. 
	</p>
<p><b>and to God the things that
	are God's</b>—How much is there in this profound but to them
	startling addition to the maxim, and how incomparable is the whole
	for fulness, brevity, clearness, weight! 
	</p>
<p><b>and they marvelled at him</b>—"at
	His answer, and held their peace" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "and left Him, and went their way" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
