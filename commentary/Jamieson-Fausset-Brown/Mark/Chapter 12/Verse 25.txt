<p><b>25. For when they shall rise from
	the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage</b>—"neither
	can they die any more" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Marriage is ordained to perpetuate the human family; but
	as there will be no breaches by death in the future state, this
	ordinance will cease. 
	</p>
<p><b>but are as the angels which
	are in heaven</b>—In Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) it is "equal unto the angels." But as the
	subject is death and resurrection, we are not warranted to extend the
	equality here taught beyond the one point—the <i>immortality</i> of
	their nature. A beautiful clause is added in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) —"and are the children of God"—not in
	respect of <i>character,</i> which is not here spoken of, but of
	<i>nature</i>—"being the children of the resurrection,"
	as rising to an undecaying existence (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:21">Romans 8:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23">Romans 8:23</span>), and so being the
	children of their Father's immortality (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:23- :">Romans 8:23- :</span>).</p>
