<p><b>26. And as touching the dead, that
	they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses</b>—"even
	Moses" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:37">Luke 20:37</span>), whom
	they had just quoted for the purpose of entangling Him.

<p><b>how in the bush God spake
	unto him</b>—either "at the bush," as the same expression
	is rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:37">Luke 20:37</span>, that
	is, when he was there; or "in the [section of his history
	regarding the] bush." The structure of our verse suggests the
	latter sense, which is not unusual.
