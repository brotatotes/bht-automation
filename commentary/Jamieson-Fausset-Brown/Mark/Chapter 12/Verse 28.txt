<p><b>28. And one of the scribes</b>—"a
	lawyer," says Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); that is, teacher of the law. 
	</p>
<p><b>came, and having heard them
	reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well,
	asked him</b>—manifestly in no bad spirit. When Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) therefore says he came "tempting," or "trying
	him," as one of the Pharisaic party who seemed to enjoy the
	defeat He had given to the Sadducees, we may suppose that though
	somewhat priding himself upon his insight into the law, and not
	indisposed to measure his knowledge with One in whom he had not yet
	learned to believe, he was nevertheless an honest-hearted, fair
	disputant. 
	</p>
<p><b>Which is the first
	commandment of all?</b>—first in importance; the primary, leading
	commandment, the most fundamental one. This was a question which,
	with some others, divided the Jewish teachers into rival schools. Our
	Lord's answer is in a strain of respect very different from what He
	showed to cavillers—ever observing His own direction, "Give
	not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
	before swine; lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again
	and rend you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:6">Matthew 7:6</span>).</p>
