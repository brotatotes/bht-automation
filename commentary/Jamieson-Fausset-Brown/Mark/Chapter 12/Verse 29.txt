<p><b>29. And Jesus answered him, The
	first of all the commandments is</b>—The readings here vary
	considerably. TISCHENDORF
	and TREGELLES read simply,
	"the first is"; and they are followed by MEYER
	and ALFORD. But though the
	authority for the precise form of the received text is slender, a
	form almost identical with it seems to have most weight of authority.
	Our Lord here gives His explicit sanction to the distinction between
	commandments of a more <i>fundamental</i> and <i>primary</i>
	character, and commandments of a more <i>dependent</i> and
	<i>subordinate</i> nature; a distinction of which it is confidently
	asserted by a certain class of critics that the Jews knew nothing,
	that our Lord and His apostles nowhere lay down, and which has been
	invented by Christian divines. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>Hear, O Israel; the Lord our
	God is one Lord</b>—This every devout Jew recited twice every day,
	and the Jews do it to this day; thus keeping up the great ancient
	national protest against the polytheisms and pantheisms of the
	heathen world: it is the great utterance of the national faith in One
	Living and Personal God—"ONE
	JEHOVAH!"</p>
