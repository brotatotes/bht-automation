<p><b>30. And thou shalt</b>—We have
	here the language of <i>law,</i> expressive of God's <i>claims.</i>
	What then are we here bound down to do? One word is made to express
	it. And what a word! Had the essence of the divine law consisted in
	<i>deeds,</i> it could not possibly have been expressed in a single
	word; for no one deed is comprehensive of all others embraced in the
	law. But as it consists in <i>an affection of the soul,</i> one word
	suffices to express it—but only one. <i>Fear,</i> though due to God
	and enjoined by Him, is <i>limited</i> in its sphere and <i>distant</i>
	in character. <i>Trust, hope,</i> and the like, though essential
	features of a right state of heart towards God, are called into
	action only by <i>personal necessity,</i> and so are—in a good
	sense, it is true, but still are properly—<i>selfish</i>
	affections; that is to say, they have respect to <i>our own
	well-being.</i> But LOVE
	is an <i>all-inclusive</i> affection, embracing not only every other
	affection proper to its object, but all that is proper to be <i>done</i>
	to its object; for as love spontaneously seeks to please its object,
	so, in the case of men to God, it is the native well spring of a
	voluntary obedience. It is, besides, the most <i>personal</i> of all
	affections. One may fear an <i>event,</i> one may hope for an <i>event,</i>
	one may rejoice in an <i>event;</i> but one can love only a <i>Person.</i>
	It is the <i>tenderest,</i> the most <i>unselfish,</i> the most
	<i>divine</i> of all affections. Such, then, is the affection in
	which the essence of the divine law is declared to consist. 
	</p>
<p><b>Thou shalt love</b>—We now
	come to the glorious Object of that demanded affection. 
	</p>
<p><b>Thou shalt love the Lord, thy
	God</b>—that is, Jehovah, the Self-Existent One, who has revealed
	Himself as the "I AM,"
	and there is <i>none else;</i> who, though by His name JEHOVAH
	apparently at an unapproachable distance from His finite creatures,
	yet bears to <i>Thee</i> a real and definite relationship, out of
	which arises <i>His claim</i> and <i>Thy duty</i>—of LOVE.
	But with what are we to love Him? Four things are here specified.
	First, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God" 
	</p>
<p><b>with thy heart</b>—This
	sometimes means "the whole inner man" (as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); but that cannot be meant here; for then the other three
	particulars would be superfluous. Very often it means "our
	emotional nature"—the seat of <i>feeling</i> as distinguished
	from our intellectual nature or the seat of <i>thought,</i> commonly
	called the "mind" (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). But neither can this be the sense of it here; for here the
	heart is distinguished both from the "mind" and the "soul."
	The "heart," then, must here mean the <i>sincerity</i> of
	both the thoughts and the feelings; in other words, <i>uprightness</i>
	or <i>true-heartedness,</i> as opposed to a <i>hypocritical</i> or
	<i>divided</i> affection. But next, "Thou shalt love the Lord
	thy God" with thy soul. This is designed to command our
	emotional nature: Thou shalt put <i>feeling</i> or <i>warmth</i> into
	thine affection. Further, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God"
	</p>
<p><b>with thy mind</b>—This
	commands our intellectual nature: Thou shalt put <i>intelligence</i>
	into thine affection—in opposition to a blind devotion, or mere
	devoteeism. Lastly, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God" 
	</p>
<p><b>with thy strength</b>—This
	commands our energies: Thou shalt put <i>intensity</i> into thine
	affection—"Do it with thy might" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Taking these four things together, the command of the Law
	is, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God <i>with all thy
	powers</i>—with a <i>sincere,</i> a <i>fervid,</i> an <i>intelligent,</i>
	an <i>energetic</i> love." But this is not all that the Law
	demands. God will have all these qualities in their most perfect
	exercise. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God," says the Law,
	"with <i>all</i> thy heart," or, with perfect sincerity;
	"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with <i>all</i> thy soul,"
	or, with the utmost fervor; "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
	with <i>all</i> thy mind," or, in the fullest exercise of an
	enlightened reason; and "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
	<i>all</i> thy strength," or, with the whole energy of our
	being! So much for the First Commandment.</p>
