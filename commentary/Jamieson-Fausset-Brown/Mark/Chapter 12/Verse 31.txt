31. And the second is like—"unto
	it" (Matthew 22:39); as
	demanding the same affection, and only the extension of it, in its
	proper measure, to the creatures of Him whom we thus love—our
	brethren in the participation of the same nature, and
	neighbors, as connected with us by ties that render each
	dependent upon and necessary to the other. 
	Thou shall love thy neighbour
	as thyself—Now, as we are not to love ourselves supremely, this
	is virtually a command, in the first place, not to love our
	neighbor with all our heart and soul and mind and strength. And thus
	it is a condemnation of the idolatry of the creature. Our supreme and
	uttermost affection is to be reserved for God. But as sincerely
	as ourselves we are to love all mankind, and with the same
	readiness to do and suffer for them as we should reasonably
	desire them to show to us. The golden rule (Matthew 22:39- :) is here our best interpreter of the nature and extent of
	these claims. 
	There is none other
	commandment greater than these—or, as in Matthew 22:39- :, "On these two commandments hang all the Law and the
	Prophets" (see on Matthew 22:39- :). It
	is as if He had said, "This is all Scripture in a nutshell; the
	whole law of human duty in a portable, pocket form." Indeed, it
	is so simple that a child may understand it, so brief
	that all may remember it, so comprehensive as to embrace all
	possible cases. And from its very nature it is unchangeable.
	It is inconceivable that God should require from his rational
	creatures anything less, or in substance anything else,
	under any dispensation, in any world, at any period
	throughout eternal duration. He cannot but claim this—all
	this—alike in heaven, in earth, and in hell!
	And this incomparable summary of the divine law belonged to the
	Jewish religion! As it shines in its own self-evidencing
	splendor, so it reveals its own true source. The religion from which
	the world has received it could be none other than a God-given
	religion!
