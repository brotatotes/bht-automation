<p><b>31. And the second is like</b>—"unto
	it" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:39">Matthew 22:39</span>); as
	demanding the same affection, and only the extension of it, in its
	proper measure, to the creatures of Him whom we thus love—our
	<i>brethren</i> in the participation of the same nature, and
	<i>neighbors,</i> as connected with us by ties that render each
	dependent upon and necessary to the other. 
	</p>
<p><b>Thou shall love thy neighbour
	as thyself</b>—Now, as we are not to love ourselves supremely, this
	is virtually a command, in the first place, <i>not</i> to love our
	neighbor with all our heart and soul and mind and strength. And thus
	it is a condemnation of the idolatry of the creature. Our supreme and
	uttermost affection is to be reserved for God. But as <i>sincerely</i>
	as ourselves we are to love all mankind, and with <i>the same
	readiness to do and suffer for them</i> as we should reasonably
	desire them to show to us. The golden rule (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:39- :">Matthew 22:39- :</span>) is here our best interpreter of the nature and extent of
	these claims. 
	</p>
<p><b>There is none other
	commandment greater than these</b>—or, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:39- :">Matthew 22:39- :</span>, "On these two commandments hang all the Law and the
	Prophets" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:39- :">Matthew 22:39- :</span>). It
	is as if He had said, "This is all Scripture in a nutshell; the
	whole law of human duty in a portable, pocket form." Indeed, it
	is so <i>simple</i> that a child may understand it, so <i>brief</i>
	that all may remember it, so <i>comprehensive</i> as to embrace all
	possible cases. And from its very nature it is <i>unchangeable.</i>
	It is inconceivable that God should require from his rational
	creatures anything <i>less,</i> or in substance anything <i>else,</i>
	under any <i>dispensation,</i> in any <i>world,</i> at any <i>period</i>
	throughout eternal duration. He cannot but claim this—all
	this—alike in <i>heaven,</i> in <i>earth,</i> and in <i>hell!</i>
	And this incomparable summary of the divine law belonged to the
	<i>Jewish religion!</i> As it shines in its own self-evidencing
	splendor, so it reveals its own true source. The religion from which
	the world has received it could be none other than a <i>God-given
	religion!</i></p>
