<p><b>35. And Jesus answered and said,
	while he taught in the temple</b>—and "while the Pharisees
	were gathered together" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>How say the scribes that
	Christ is the son of David?</b>—How come they to give it out that
	Messiah is to be the son of David? In Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), Jesus asks them, "What think ye of Christ?" or
	of the promised and expected Messiah? "Whose son is He [to be]?
	They say unto Him, The son of David." The sense is the same. "He
	saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord?"
