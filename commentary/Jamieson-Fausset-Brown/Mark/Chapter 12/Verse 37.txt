<p><b>37. David therefore himself calleth
	him Lord; and whence is he then his son?</b>—There is but one
	solution of this difficulty. Messiah is at once inferior to David as
	his son according to the flesh, and superior to him as the Lord of a
	kingdom of which David is himself a subject, not the sovereign. The
	human and divine natures of Christ, and the spirituality of His
	kingdom—of which the highest earthly sovereigns are honored if they
	be counted worthy to be its subjects—furnish the only key to this
	puzzle. 
	</p>
<p><b>And the common people</b>—the
	immense crowd. 
	</p>
<p><b>heard him gladly</b>—"And
	no man was able to answer Him a word; neither durst any man from that
	day forth ask Him any more questions" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
