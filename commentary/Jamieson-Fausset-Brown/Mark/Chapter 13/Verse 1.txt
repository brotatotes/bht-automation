<p><b>1. And as he went out of the temple,
	one of his disciples saith unto him</b>—The other Evangelists are
	less definite. "As some spake," says Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); "His disciples came to Him," says Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Doubtless it was the speech of one, the mouthpiece,
	likely, of others.

<p><b>Master</b>—Teacher. 
	</p>
<p><b>see what manner of stones and
	what buildings are here</b>—wondering probably, how so massive a
	pile could be overthrown, as seemed implied in our Lord's last words
	regarding it. JOSEPHUS,
	who gives a minute account of the wonderful structure, speaks of
	stones forty cubits long [<i>Wars of the Jews,</i> 5.5.1.] and says
	the pillars supporting the porches were twenty-five cubits high, all
	of one stone, and that of the whitest marble [<i>Wars of the Jews,</i>
	5.5.2]. Six days' battering at the walls, during the siege, made no
	impression upon them [<i>Wars of the Jews,</i> 6.4.1]. Some of the
	under-building, yet remaining, and other works, are probably as old
	as the first temple.</p>
