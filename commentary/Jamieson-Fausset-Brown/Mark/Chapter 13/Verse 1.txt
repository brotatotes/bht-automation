	stones forty cubits long [Wars of the Jews, 5.5.1.] and says
	the pillars supporting the porches were twenty-five cubits high, all
	of one stone, and that of the whitest marble [Wars of the Jews,
	5.5.2]. Six days' battering at the walls, during the siege, made no
	impression upon them [Wars of the Jews, 6.4.1]. Some of the
	under-building, yet remaining, and other works, are probably as old
	as the first temple.
