<p><b>10. And the gospel must first be
	published among all nations</b>â€”"for a witness, and then shall
	the end come" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:14">Matthew 24:14</span>).
	God never sends judgment without previous warning; and there can be
	no doubt that the Jews, already dispersed over most known countries,
	had nearly all heard the Gospel "as a witness," before the
	end of the Jewish state. The same principle was repeated and will
	repeat itself to "<i>the</i> end."</p>
