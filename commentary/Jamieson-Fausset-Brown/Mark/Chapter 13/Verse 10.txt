10. And the gospel must first be
	published among all nationsâ€”"for a witness, and then shall
	the end come" (Matthew 24:14).
	God never sends judgment without previous warning; and there can be
	no doubt that the Jews, already dispersed over most known countries,
	had nearly all heard the Gospel "as a witness," before the
	end of the Jewish state. The same principle was repeated and will
	repeat itself to "the end."
