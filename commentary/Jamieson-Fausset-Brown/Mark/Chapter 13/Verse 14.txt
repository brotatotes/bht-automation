<p><b>14. But when ye shall see</b>—"Jerusalem
	compassed by armies"—by encamped armies; in other words, when
	ye shall see it <i>besieged,</i> and 
	</p>
<p><b>the abomination of
	desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought
	not</b>—that is, as explained in Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "standing in the holy place." 
	</p>
<p><b>(let him that readeth
	understand)</b>—readeth that prophecy. That "the abomination
	of desolation" here alluded to was intended to point to the
	Roman ensigns, as the symbols of an idolatrous, and so unclean pagan
	power, may be gathered by comparing what Luke says in the
	corresponding verse (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:20">Luke 21:20</span>);
	and commentators are agreed on it. It is worthy of notice, as
	confirming this interpretation, that in <u>1 Maccabees 1:54</u>—which,
	though aprocryphal <i>Scripture,</i> is authentic <i>history</i>—the
	expression of Daniel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:31">Daniel 11:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:11">Daniel 12:11</span>) is applied to the
	idolatrous profanation of the Jewish altar by Antiochus Epiphanes. 
	</p>
<p><b>then let them that be in
	Judea flee to the mountains</b>—The ecclesiastical historian,
	EUSEBIUS, early in the
	fourth century, tells us that the Christians fled to <i>Pella,</i> at
	the northern extremity of Perea, being "prophetically
	directed"—perhaps by some prophetic intimation more explicit
	than this, which would be their chart—and that thus they escaped
	the predicted calamities by which the nation was overwhelmed.</p>
