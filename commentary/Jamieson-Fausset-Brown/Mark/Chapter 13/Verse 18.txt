<p><b>18. And pray ye that your flight be
	not in the winter</b>â€”making escape perilous, or tempting you to
	delay your flight. Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) adds, "neither on the sabbath day," when, from
	fear of a breach of its sacred rest, they might be induced to remain.</p>
