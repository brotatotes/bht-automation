	affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which
	God created unto this time, neither shall be</b>â€”Such language is
	not unusual in the Old Testament with reference to tremendous
	calamities. But it is matter of literal fact that there was crowded
	into the period of the Jewish war an amount and complication of
	suffering perhaps unparalleled; as the narrative of JOSEPHUS,
	examined closely and arranged under different heads, would show.</p>
