<p><b>2. And Jesus answering said unto
	him, Seest thou these great buildings?</b>—"Ye call My
	attention to these things? I have seen them. Ye point to their
	massive and durable appearance: now listen to their fate." 
	</p>
<p><b>there shall not be left</b>—"left
	here" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:2">Matthew 24:2</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>one stone upon another, that
	shall not be thrown down</b>—Titus ordered the whole city and
	temple to be demolished [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Wars of the Jews,</i> 7.1.1]; Eleazar wished they had all died
	before seeing that holy city destroyed by enemies' hands, and before
	the temple was so profanely <i>dug up</i> [<i>Wars of the Jews,</i>
	7.8.7].</p>
