<p><b>23. But take ye heed; behold, I have
	foretold you all things</b>â€”He had just told them that the
	seduction of the elect would prove impossible; but since this would
	be all but accomplished, He bids them be on their guard, as the
	proper means of averting that catastrophe. In Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) we have some additional particulars: "Wherefore,
	if they shall say unto you, Behold, He is in the desert; go not
	forth: behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe it not. For as
	the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west;
	so shall also the coming of the Son of man be." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. "For wheresoever the carcass is, there will the
	eagles be gathered together." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
