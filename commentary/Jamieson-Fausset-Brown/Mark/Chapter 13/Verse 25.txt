<p><b>25. And the stars of heaven shall
	fall</b>—"and upon the earth distress of nations, with
	perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them
	for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the
	earth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:25">Luke 21:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:26">Luke 21:26</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>and the powers that are in
	heaven shall be shaken</b>—Though the grandeur of this language
	carries the mind over the head of all periods but that of Christ's
	Second Coming, nearly every expression will be found used of the
	Lord's coming in terrible national judgments: as of Babylon (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:26- :">Luke 21:26- :</span>); of Idumea (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:1">Isaiah 34:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:2">Isaiah 34:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:4">Isaiah 34:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+34:8-10">Isaiah 34:8-10</span>); of Egypt
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:7">Ezekiel 32:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+32:8">Ezekiel 32:8</span>);
	compare also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:7-15">Psalms 18:7-15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:1">Isaiah 24:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+24:17-19">Isaiah 24:17-19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:10">Joel 2:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:11">Joel 2:11</span>,
	&amp;c. We cannot therefore consider the mere strength of this
	language a proof that it refers exclusively or primarily to the
	precursors of the final day, though of course in "<i>that day</i>"
	it will have its most awful fulfilment.</p>
