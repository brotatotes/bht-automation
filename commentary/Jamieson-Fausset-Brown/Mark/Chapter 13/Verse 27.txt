27. And then shall he send his
	angels—"with a great sound of a trumpet" ( :-). 
	and shall gather together his
	elect, c.—As the tribes of Israel were anciently gathered
	together by sound of trumpet (Exodus 19:13
Exodus 19:16; Exodus 19:19;
	Leviticus 23:24; Psalms 81:3-5),
	so any mighty gathering of God's people, by divine command, is
	represented as collected by sound of trumpet (Psalms 81:3-19.81.5- :; compare Revelation 11:15);
	and the ministry of angels, employed in all the great operations of
	Providence, is here held forth as the agency by which the present
	assembling of the elect is to be accomplished. LIGHTFOOT
	thus explains it: "When Jerusalem shall be reduced to ashes, and
	that wicked nation cut off and rejected, then shall the Son of man
	send His ministers with the trumpet of the Gospel, and they shall
	gather His elect of the several nations, from the four corners of
	heaven: so that God shall not want a Church, although that ancient
	people of His be rejected and cast off: but that ancient Jewish
	Church being destroyed, a new Church shall be called out of the
	Gentiles." But though something like this appears to be the
	primary sense of the verse, in relation to the destruction of
	Jerusalem, no one can fail to see that the language swells beyond any
	gathering of a human family into a Church upon earth, and forces the
	thoughts onward to that gathering of the Church "at the last
	trump," to meet the Lord in the air, which is to wind up the
	present scene. Still, this is not, in our judgment, the direct
	subject of the prediction; for Revelation 11:15- : limits the whole prediction to the generation then
	existing.
