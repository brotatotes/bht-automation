<p><b>29. So ye, in like manner, when ye
	shall see these things come to pass</b>—rather, "coming to
	pass." 
	</p>
<p><b>know that it</b>—"the
	kingdom of God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:31">Luke 21:31</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>is nigh, even at the
	doors</b>—that is, the full manifestation of it; for till then it
	admitted of no full development. In Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:31- :">Luke 21:31- :</span>) the following words precede these: "And when these
	things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads;
	for your redemption draweth nigh"—their redemption, in the
	first instance certainly, from Jewish oppression (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:14-16">1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:52">Luke 11:52</span>): but in the highest
	sense of these words, redemption from all the oppressions and
	miseries of the present state at the second appearing of the Lord
	Jesus.</p>
