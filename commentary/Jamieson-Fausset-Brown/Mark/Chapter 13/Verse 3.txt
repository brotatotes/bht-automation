<p><b>3. And as he sat upon the Mount of
	Olives, over against the temple</b>—On their way from Jerusalem to
	Bethany they would cross Mount Olivet; on its summit He seats
	Himself, over against the temple, having the city all spread out
	under His eye. How graphically is this set before us by our
	Evangelist!

<p><b>Peter and James and John and
	Andrew asked him privately</b>—The other Evangelists tell us merely
	that "the disciples" did so. But Mark not only says that it
	was four of them, but names them; and they were the first <i>quarternion</i>
	of the Twelve.</p>
