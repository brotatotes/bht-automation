30. Verily I say unto you, that this
	generation shall not pass fill all these things be doneâ€”or
	"fulfilled" (Matthew 24:34;
	Luke 21:32). Whether we take this
	to mean that the whole would be fulfilled within the limits of the
	generation then current, or, according to a usual way of speaking,
	that the generation then existing would not pass away without seeing
	a begun fulfilment of this prediction, the facts entirely
	correspond. For either the whole was fulfilled in the destruction
	accomplished by Titus, as many think; or, if we stretch it out,
	according to others, till the thorough dispersion of the Jews a
	little later, under Adrian, every requirement of our Lord's words
	seems to be met.
