<p><b>30. Verily I say unto you, that this
	generation shall not pass fill all these things be done</b>â€”or
	"fulfilled" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:34">Matthew 24:34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:32">Luke 21:32</span>). Whether we take this
	to mean that the whole would be fulfilled within the limits of the
	generation then current, or, according to a usual way of speaking,
	that the generation then existing would not pass away without seeing
	a <i>begun</i> fulfilment of this prediction, the facts entirely
	correspond. For either the whole was fulfilled in the destruction
	accomplished by Titus, as many think; or, if we stretch it out,
	according to others, till the thorough dispersion of the Jews a
	little later, under Adrian, every requirement of our Lord's words
	seems to be met.</p>
