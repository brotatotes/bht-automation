<p><b>31. Heaven and earth shall pass
	away; but my words shall not pass away</b>—the strongest possible
	expression of the divine authority by which He spake; not as Moses or
	Paul might have said of their own inspiration, for such language
	would be unsuitable in any merely human mouth.

<p><i>Warnings to Prepare for the
	Coming of Christ Suggested by the Foregoing Prophecy</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p>It will be observed that, in the
	foregoing prophecy, as our Lord approaches the crisis of the day of
	vengeance on Jerusalem and redemption for the Church—at which stage
	the analogy between that and the day of final vengeance and
	redemption waxes more striking—His language rises and swells beyond
	all temporal and partial vengeance, beyond all earthly deliverances
	and enlargements, and ushers us resistlessly into the scenes of the
	final day. Accordingly, in these six concluding verses it is manifest
	that preparation for "THAT
	DAY" is what our Lord designs to inculcate.</p>
