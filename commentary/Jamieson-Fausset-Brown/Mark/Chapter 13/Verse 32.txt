<p><b>32. But of that day and that
	hour</b>—that is, the precise time.

<p><b>knoweth no man</b>—literally,
	no one.

<p><b>no, not the angels which are
	in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father</b>—This very remarkable
	statement regarding "the Son" is peculiar to Mark. Whether
	it means that the Son was <i>not at that time in possession of the
	knowledge</i> referred to, or simply that it was not <i>among the
	things which He had received to communicate</i>—has been matter of
	much controversy even among the firmest believers in the proper
	Divinity of Christ. In the latter sense it was taken by some of the
	most eminent of the ancient Fathers, and by LUTHER,
	MELANCTHON, and most of
	the older Lutherans; and it is so taken by BENGEL,
	LANGE, WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON, CHRYSOSTOM
	and others understood it to mean that <i>as man</i> our Lord was
	ignorant of this. It is taken literally by CALVIN,
	GROTIUS, DE
	WETTE, MEYER,
	FRITZSCHE, STIER,
	ALFORD, and ALEXANDER.</p>
