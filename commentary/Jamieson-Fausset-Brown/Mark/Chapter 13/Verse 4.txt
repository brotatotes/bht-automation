<p><b>4. Tell us, when shall these things
	be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be
	fulfilled?</b>â€”"and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and
	of the end of the world?" They no doubt looked upon the date of
	all these things as one and the same, and their notions of the things
	themselves were as confused as of the times of them. Our Lord takes
	His own way of meeting their questions.
