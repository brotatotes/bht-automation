<p><b>9. But take heed to yourselves:
	for</b>—"before all these things" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); that is, before these public calamities come. 
	</p>
<p><b>they shall deliver you up to
	councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten</b>—These refer
	to <i>ecclesiastical</i> proceedings against them. 
	</p>
<p><b>and ye shall be brought
	before rulers and kings</b>—before <i>civil</i> tribunals next. 
	</p>
<p><b>for my sake, for a testimony
	against them</b>—rather "unto them"—to give you an
	opportunity of bearing testimony to Me before them. In the Acts of
	the Apostles we have the best commentary on this announcement.
