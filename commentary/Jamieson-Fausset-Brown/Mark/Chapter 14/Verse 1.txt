1. After two days was the feast of
	the passover, and of unleavened bread—The meaning is, that two
	days after what is about to be mentioned the passover would arrive;
	in other words, what follows occurred two days before the
	feast. 
	and the chief priests and the
	scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to
	death—From Matthew's fuller account ( :-) we learn that our Lord announced this to the Twelve as
	follows, being the first announcement to them of the precise time:
	"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings"
	(Matthew 26:1) —referring to the
	contents of Matthew 24:1-25,
	which He delivered to His disciples; His public ministry being now
	closed: from His prophetical He is now passing into His
	priestly office, although all along He Himself took our
	infirmities and bare our sicknesses—"He said unto His
	disciples, Ye know that after two days is [the feast of] the
	passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified." The
	first and the last steps of His final sufferings are
	brought together in this brief announcement of all that was to take
	place. The passover was the first and the chief of the three
	great annual festivals, commemorative of the redemption of God's
	people from Egypt, through the sprinkling of the blood of a lamb
	divinely appointed to be slain for that end; the destroying angel,
	"when he saw the blood, passing over" the
	Israelitish houses, on which that blood was seen, when he came to
	destroy all the first-born in the land of Egypt (Exodus 12:12;
	Exodus 12:13) —bright typical
	foreshadowing of the great Sacrifice, and the Redemption effected
	thereby. Accordingly, "by the determinate counsel and
	foreknowledge of God, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in
	working," it was so ordered that precisely at the passover
	season, "Christ our Passover should be sacrificed for us."
	On the day following the passover commenced "the feast of
	unleavened bread," so called because for seven days only
	unleavened bread was to be eaten (Exodus 12:13- :). See on Exodus 12:13- :. We
	are further told by Matthew (Exodus 12:13- :) that the consultation was held in the palace of Caiaphas
	the high priest, between the chief priests, [the scribes], and the
	elders of the people, how "they might take Jesus by subtlety and
	kill Him."
