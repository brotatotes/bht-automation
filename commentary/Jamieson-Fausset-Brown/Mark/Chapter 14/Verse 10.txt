<p><b>10. And Judas Iscariot, one of the
	twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them</b>—that
	is, to make his proposals, and to bargain with them, as appears from
	Matthew's fuller statement (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:14">Matthew 26:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:15">Matthew 26:15</span>) which says, he "went
	unto the chief priests, and said, What will ye give me, and I will
	deliver Him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces
	of silver." The thirty pieces of silver were thirty shekels, the
	fine paid for man- or maid-servant accidentally killed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:15- :">Matthew 26:15- :</span>), and equal to between four and five pounds sterling—"a
	<i>goodly</i> price that I was prized at of them!" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:15- :">Matthew 26:15- :</span>).</p>
