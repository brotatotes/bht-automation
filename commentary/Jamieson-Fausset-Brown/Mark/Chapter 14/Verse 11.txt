<p style="margin-left: 1.25em; "> Had we only
	the first three Gospels, we should have concluded that our Lord was
	led immediately to Caiaphas, and had before the Council. But as the
	Sanhedrim could hardly have been brought together at the dead hour of
	night—by which time our Lord was in the hands of the officers sent
	to take Him—and as it was only "as soon as it was day"
	that the Council met (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:66">Luke 22:66</span>),
	we should have had some difficulty in knowing what was done with Him
	during those intervening hours. In the Fourth Gospel, however, all
	this is cleared up, and a very important addition to our information
	is made (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:14">John 18:14</span>;

	the detail supplied by a comparison of all the four streams of text.

</b><i><b>Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year</b></i><b>
</b>—This successful Annas, as ELLICOTT
	remarks, was appointed high priest by Quirinus, A.D.
	12, and after holding the office for several years, was deposed by
	Valerius Gratius, Pilate's predecessor in the procuratorship of Judea
	[JOSEPHUS, <i>Antiquities,</i>
	18.2.1, c.]. He appears, however, to have possessed vast influence,
	having obtained the high priesthood, not only for his son Eleazar,
	and his son-in-law Caiaphas, but subsequently for four other sons,
	under the last of whom James, the brother of our Lord, was put to
	death [<i>Antiquities,</i> 20.9.1]. It is thus highly probable that,
	besides having the title of "high priest" merely as one who
	had filled the office, he to a great degree retained the powers he
	had formerly exercised, and came to be regarded practically as a kind
	of rightful high priest.
