11. And when they heard it, they
	were glad, and promised to give him money—Matthew alone records
	the precise sum, because a remarkable and complicated prophecy, which
	he was afterwards to refer to, was fulfilled by it. 
	And he sought how he might
	conveniently betray him—or, as more fully given in Luke ( :-), "And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray
	Him unto them in the absence of the multitude." That he should
	avoid an "uproar" or "riot" among the people,
	which probably was made an essential condition by the Jewish
	authorities, was thus assented to by the traitor; into whom, says
	Luke (Luke 22:3), "Satan
	entered," to put him upon this hellish deed.

	 Had we only
	the first three Gospels, we should have concluded that our Lord was
	led immediately to Caiaphas, and had before the Council. But as the
	Sanhedrim could hardly have been brought together at the dead hour of
	night—by which time our Lord was in the hands of the officers sent
	to take Him—and as it was only "as soon as it was day"
	that the Council met (Luke 22:66),
	we should have had some difficulty in knowing what was done with Him
	during those intervening hours. In the Fourth Gospel, however, all
	this is cleared up, and a very important addition to our information
	is made (John 18:13; John 18:14;
	John 18:19-24). Let us
	endeavor to trace the events in the true order of succession, and in
	the detail supplied by a comparison of all the four streams of text. 
	
	 Jesus
	Is Brought Privately before Annas, the Father-in-Law of Caiaphas
	(John 18:13; John 18:14).
	
	 John 18:14- :: 
	 And
	they led Him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law to
Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year
—This successful Annas, as ELLICOTT
	remarks, was appointed high priest by Quirinus, A.D.
	12, and after holding the office for several years, was deposed by
	Valerius Gratius, Pilate's predecessor in the procuratorship of Judea
	[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities,
	18.2.1, c.]. He appears, however, to have possessed vast influence,
	having obtained the high priesthood, not only for his son Eleazar,
	and his son-in-law Caiaphas, but subsequently for four other sons,
	under the last of whom James, the brother of our Lord, was put to
	death [Antiquities, 20.9.1]. It is thus highly probable that,
	besides having the title of "high priest" merely as one who
	had filled the office, he to a great degree retained the powers he
	had formerly exercised, and came to be regarded practically as a kind
	of rightful high priest. 
	 John 18:14- :: 
	Now
	Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient
	that one man should die for the people.
 See on John 18:14- :. What passed between Annas and our Lord during this
	interval the beloved disciple reserves till he has related the
	beginning of Peter's fall. To this, then, as recorded by our own
	Evangelist, let us meanwhile listen. 
	Peter Obtains Access within the
	Quadrangle of the High Priest's Residence, and Warms Himself at the
	Fire (Mark 14:53 Mark 14:54).
