3. And being in Bethany, in the
	house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman—It
	was "Mary," as we learn from  :-. 
	having an alabaster box of
	ointment of spikenard—pure nard, a celebrated
	aromatic—(See Song of Solomon 1:12). 
	very precious—"very
	costly" (John 12:3). 
	and she brake the box, and
	poured it on his head—"and anointed," adds John (John 12:3- :), "the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair:
	and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment." The
	only use of this was to refresh and exhilarate—a grateful
	compliment in the East, amid the closeness of a heated atmosphere,
	with many guests at a feast. Such was the form in which Mary's love
	to Christ, at so much cost to herself, poured itself out.
