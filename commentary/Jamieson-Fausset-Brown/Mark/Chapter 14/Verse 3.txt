<p><b>3. And being in Bethany, in the
	house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman</b>—It
	was "Mary," as we learn from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>having an alabaster box of
	ointment of spikenard</b>—pure <i>nard,</i> a celebrated
	aromatic—(See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+1:12">Song of Solomon 1:12</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>very precious</b>—"very
	costly" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3">John 12:3</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and she brake the box, and
	poured it on his head</b>—"and anointed," adds John (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:3- :">John 12:3- :</span>), "the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair:
	and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment." The
	only use of this was to refresh and exhilarate—a grateful
	compliment in the East, amid the closeness of a heated atmosphere,
	with many guests at a feast. Such was the form in which Mary's love
	to Christ, at so much cost to herself, poured itself out.</p>
