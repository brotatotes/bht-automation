<p><b>54. And Peter followed him afar off,

	</p>
<p><b>the palace of the high
	priest</b>—"An oriental house," says ROBINSON,
	"is usually built around a quadrangular interior court; into
	which there is a passage (sometimes arched) through the front part of
	the house, closed next the street by a heavy folding gate, with a
	smaller wicket for single persons, kept by a porter. The interior
	court, often paved or flagged, and open to the sky, is the <i>hall,</i>
	which our translators have rendered 'palace,' where the attendants
	made a fire; and the passage beneath the front of the house, from the
	street to this court, is the <i>porch.</i> The place where Jesus
	stood before the high priest may have been an open room, or place of
	audience on the ground floor, in the rear or on one side of the
	court; such rooms, open in front, being customary. It was close upon
	the court, for Jesus heard all that was going on around the fire, and
	turned and looked upon Peter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>)." 
	</p>
<p><b>and he sat with the servants,
	and warmed himself at the fire</b>—The graphic details, here
	omitted, are supplied in the other Gospels. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>: 
	</p>
<p><i><b>And the servants and
	officers stood there</b></i><b> </b>—that is, in the hall, within
	the quadrangle, open to the sky. 
	</p>
<p><i><b>who had made a fire of
	coals</b></i><b> </b>—or charcoal (in a brazier probably). 
	</p>
<p><i><b>for it was cold</b></i><b>
</b>—John alone of all the Evangelists mentions the <i>material,</i>
	and the <i>coldness</i> of the night, as WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON remark. The
	elevated situation of Jerusalem, observes THOLUCK,
	renders it so cold about Easter as to make a watch fire at night
	indispensable. 
	</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25em; "> <i><b>And
	Peter stood with them and warmed himself</b></i><b> </b>—"He
	went in," says Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "and sat with the servants <i>to see the end.</i>"
	These two minute statements throw an interesting light on each other.
	His wishing to "see the end," or issue of these
	proceedings, was what led him into the palace, for he evidently
	feared the worst. But once in, the serpent coil is drawn closer; it
	is a cold night, and why should not he take advantage of the fire as
	well as others? Besides, in the talk of the crowd about the
	all-engrossing topic he may pick up something which he would like to
	hear. Poor Peter! But now, let us leave him warming himself at the
	fire, and listening to the hum of talk about this strange case by
	which the subordinate officials, passing to and fro and crowding
	around the fire in this open court, would while away the time; and,
	following what appears the order of the Evangelical Narrative, let us
	turn to Peter's Lord.

<p><i><b>Now

	is much diversity of opinion; and according as we understand it will
	be the conclusion we come to, whether there was but <i>one
	hearing</i> of our Lord before Annas and
	Caiaphas together, or whether, according to the view we have given
	above, there were <i>two hearings</i>—a
	preliminary and informal one before Annas, and a formal and official
	one before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrim. If our translators have given
	the right sense of the verse, there was but one hearing before
	Caiaphas; and then <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:24">John 18:24</span>
	is to be read as a <i>parenthesis,</i>
	merely supplementing what was said in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:24- :">John 18:24- :</span>. This is the view of CALVIN,
	BEZA,
	GROTIUS,
	BENGEL,
	DE
	WETTE,
	MEYER,
	LUCKE,
	THOLUCK.
	But there are decided objections to this view. First: We cannot but
	think that the <i>natural</i>
	sense of the whole passage, embracing <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:14">John 18:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:19-24">John 18:19-24</span>,
	is that of a preliminary non-official hearing before "Annas
	first," the particulars of which are accordingly recorded; and
	then of a transference of our Lord from Annas to Caiaphas. Second: On
	the other view, it is not easy to see why the Evangelist should not
	have inserted <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:24">John 18:24</span>
	immediately after <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:13">John 18:13</span>;
	or rather, how he could well have done otherwise. As it stands, it is
	not only quite out of its proper place, but comes in most
	perplexingly. Whereas, if we take it as a simple statement of fact,
	that after Annas had finished his interview with Jesus, as recorded
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:19-23">John 18:19-23</span>, he
	transferred Him to Caiaphas to be formally tried, all is clear and
	natural. Third: The pluperfect sense "<i>had</i>
	sent" is in the translation only; the sense of the original word
	being simply "sent." And though there are cases where the
	aorist here used has the sense of an English pluperfect, this sense
	is not to be put upon it unless it be obvious and indisputable. Here
	that is so far from being the case, that the pluperfect "had
	sent" is rather an unwarrantable <i>interpretation</i>
	than a simple <i>translation</i>
	of the word; informing the reader that, <i>according
	to the view of our translators,</i> our
	Lord "had been" sent to Caiaphas <i>before</i>
	the interview just recorded by the Evangelist; whereas, if we
	translate the verse literally—"Annas <i>sent</i>
	Him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest"—we get just the
	information we expect, that Annas, having merely "<i>precognosced</i>"
	the prisoner, hoping to draw something out of Him, "sent Him to
	Caiaphas" to be formally tried before the proper tribunal. This
	is the view of CHRYSOSTOM
	and AUGUSTINE
	among the Fathers; and of the moderns, of OLSHAUSEN,
	SCHLEIERMACHER,
	NEANDER,
	EBRARD,
	WIESELER,
	LANGE,
	LUTHARDT.
	This brings us back to the text of our second Gospel, and in it to 
	</p>
<p><i>The Judicial Trial and
	Condemnation of the Lord Jesus by the Sanhedrim</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:19-43.18.23- :">John 18:19-43.18.23- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p>But let the reader observe, that
	though this is introduced by the Evangelist before any of the denials
	of Peter are recorded, we have given reasons for concluding that
	probably the <i>first two denials</i> took place while our Lord was
	with Annas, and the last only during the trial before the Sanhedrim.</p>
