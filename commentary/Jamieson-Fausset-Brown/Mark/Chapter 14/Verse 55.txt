	the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to
	death</b>—Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:59">Matthew 26:59</span>)
	says they "sought <i>false</i> witness." They knew they
	could find nothing valid; but having their Prisoner to bring before
	Pilate, they behooved to <i>make a case.</i>
</p>
<p><b>and found none</b>—none
	that would suit their purpose, or make a decent ground of charge
	before Pilate.</p>
