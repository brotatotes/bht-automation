56. For many bare false witness
	against him—From their debasing themselves to "seek"
	them, we are led to infer that they were bribed to bear false
	witness; though there are never wanting sycophants enough, ready to
	sell themselves for naught, if they may but get a smile from those
	above them: see a similar scene in  :-. How is one reminded here of that complaint, "False
	witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not"
	(Psalms 31:11)! 
	but their witness agreed not
	together—If even two of them had been agreed, it would
	have been greedily enough laid hold of, as all that the law insisted
	upon even in capital cases (Psalms 31:11- :). But even in this they failed. One cannot but admire the
	providence which secured this result; since, on the one hand, it
	seems astonishing that those unscrupulous prosecutors and their ready
	tools should so bungle a business in which they felt their whole
	interests bound up; and, on the other hand, if they had
	succeeded in making even a plausible case, the effect on the progress
	of the Gospel might for a time have been injurious. But at the very
	time when His enemies were saying, "God hath forsaken Him;
	persecute and take Him; for there is none to deliver Him" (Psalms 31:11- :), He whose Witness He was and whose work He was doing was
	keeping Him as the apple of His eye, and while He was making the
	wrath of man to praise Him, was restraining the remainder of that
	wrath (Psalms 76:10).
