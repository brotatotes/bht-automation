<p><b>59. But neither so did their witness
	agree together</b>—that is, not even as to so brief a speech,
	consisting of but a few words, was there such a concurrence in their
	mode of reporting it as to make out a decent case. In such a charge
	<i>everything depended on the very terms alleged to have been used.</i>
	For every one must see that a very slight turn, either way, given to
	such words, would make them either something like <i>indictable
	matter,</i> or else a <i>ridiculous ground for a criminal
	charge</i>—would either give them a colorable pretext for the
	charge of impiety which they were bent on making out, or else make
	the whole saying appear, on the worst view that could be taken of it,
	as merely some mystical or empty boast.</p>
