64. Ye have heard the blasphemy—(See
	John 10:33). In Luke (John 10:33- :), "For we ourselves have heard of His own mouth"—an
	affectation of religious horror. (Also see on John 10:33- :.) 
	what think ye?—"Say
	what the verdict is to be." 
	they all condemned him to be
	guilty of death—or of a capital crime, which blasphemy
	against God was according to the Jewish law (John 10:33- :). Yet not absolutely all; for Joseph of
	Arimathea, "a good man and a just," was one of that
	Council, and "he was not a consenting party to the
	counsel and deed of them," for that is the strict sense of the
	words of Luke 23:50; Luke 23:51.
	Probably he absented himself, and Nicodemus also, from this
	meeting of the Council, the temper of which they would know too well
	to expect their voice to be listened to; and in that case, the words
	of our Evangelist are to be taken strictly, that, without one
	dissentient voice, "all [present] condemned him to be guilty of
	death." 
	The Blessed One Is Now
	Shamefully Entreated (Luke 23:51- :). 
	Every word here must be carefully
	observed, and the several accounts put together, that we may lose
	none of the awful indignities about to be described.
