<p><b>64. Ye have heard the blasphemy</b>—(See
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:33">John 10:33</span>). In Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:33- :">John 10:33- :</span>), "For we ourselves have heard of His own mouth"—an
	affectation of religious horror. (Also see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:33- :">John 10:33- :</span>.)

<p><b>what think ye?</b>—"Say
	what the verdict is to be." 
	</p>
<p><b>they all condemned him to be
	guilty of death</b>—or of a capital crime, which <i>blasphemy</i>
	against God was according to the Jewish law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:33- :">John 10:33- :</span>). Yet <i>not absolutely all;</i> for <i>Joseph</i> of
	Arimathea, "a good man and a just," was one of that
	Council, and "<i>he was not a consenting party</i> to the
	counsel and deed of them," for that is the strict sense of the
	words of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:50">Luke 23:50</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:51">Luke 23:51</span>.
	Probably he absented himself, and <i>Nicodemus</i> also, from this
	meeting of the Council, the temper of which they would know too well
	to expect their voice to be listened to; and in that case, the words
	of our Evangelist are to be taken strictly, that, without one
	dissentient voice, "all [present] condemned him to be guilty of
	death."

<p><i>The Blessed One Is Now
	Shamefully Entreated</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+23:51- :">Luke 23:51- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p>Every word here must be carefully
	observed, and the several accounts put together, that we may lose
	none of the awful indignities about to be described.</p>
