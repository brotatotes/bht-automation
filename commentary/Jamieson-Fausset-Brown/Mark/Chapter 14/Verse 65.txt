65. And some began to spit on
	him—or, as in Matthew 26:67,
	"to spit in [into] His face." Luke (Matthew 26:67- :) says in addition, "And the men that held Jesus mocked
	him"—or cast their jeers at Him. (Also see on Matthew 26:67- :.) 
	to cover his face—or
	"to blindfold him" (as in Matthew 26:67- :). 
	to buffet him—Luke's
	word, which is rendered "smote Him" (Matthew 26:67- :), is a stronger one, conveying an idea for which we have an
	exact equivalent in English, but one too colloquial to be inserted
	here. 
	began to say unto him,
	Prophesy—In Matthew (Matthew 26:67- :) this is given more fully: "Prophesy unto us, thou
	Christ, Who is he that smote Thee?" The sarcastic fling at Him
	as "the Christ," and the demand of Him in this
	character to name the unseen perpetrator of the blows inflicted on
	Him, was in them as infamous as to Him it must have been, and was
	intended to be, stinging. 
	and the servants did strike
	him with the palms of their hands—or "struck Him on the
	face" (Luke 22:64). Ah!
	Well did He say prophetically, in that Messianic prediction which we
	have often referred to, "I gave My back to the smiters, and My
	cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not My face from
	shame and spitting!" (Luke 22:64- :). "And many other things blasphemously spake they
	against Him" (Luke 22:65).
	This general statement is important, as showing that virulent and
	varied as were the recorded affronts put upon Him, they are
	but a small specimen of what He endured on that dark occasion.

	DENIAL of His Lord
