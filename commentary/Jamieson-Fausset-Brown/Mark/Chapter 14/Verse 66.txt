<p><b>66. And as Peter was beneath in the
	palace</b>—This little word "<i>beneath</i>"—one of our
	Evangelist's graphic touches—is most important for the right
	understanding of what we may call the topography of the scene. We
	must take it in connection with Matthew's word (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): "Now Peter sat <i>without</i> in the palace"—or
	quadrangular court, in the center of which the fire would be burning;
	and crowding around and buzzing about it would be the menials and
	others who had been admitted within the court. At the upper end of
	this court, probably, would be the memorable chamber in which the
	trial was held—<i>open to the court,</i> likely, and <i>not far
	from the fire</i> (as we gather from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), but <i>on a higher level;</i> for (as our verse says) the
	court, with Peter in it, was "beneath" it. The ascent to
	the Council chamber was perhaps by a short flight of steps. If the
	reader will bear this explanation in mind, he will find the intensely
	interesting details which follow more intelligible.

	have employed women as porters of their doors (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:17- :">John 18:17- :</span>).</p>
