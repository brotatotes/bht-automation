67. And when she saw Peter warming
	himself, she looked upon him—Luke ( :-) is here more graphic; "But a certain maid beheld him
	as he sat by the fire"—literally, "by the light,"
	which, shining full upon him, revealed him to the girl—"and
	earnestly looked upon him"—or, "fixed her gaze upon him."
	His demeanor and timidity, which must have attracted notice, as so
	generally happens, "leading," says OLSHAUSEN,
	"to the recognition of him." 
	and said, And thou also wast
	with Jesus of Nazareth—"with Jesus the Nazarene," or,
	"with Jesus of Galilee" ( :-). The sense of this is given in John's report of it
	(John 18:17), "Art not
	thou also one of this man's disciples?" that is, thou as well as
	"that other disciple," whom she knew to be one, but did not
	challenge, perceiving that he was a privileged person. In Luke (John 18:17- :) it is given as a remark made by the maid to one of the
	by-standers—"this man was also with Him." If so expressed
	in Peter's hearing—drawing upon him the eyes of every one that
	heard it (as we know it did, John 18:17- :), and compelling him to answer to it—that would explain
	the different forms of the report naturally enough. But in such a
	case this is of no real importance.
