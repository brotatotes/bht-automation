<p><b>they that stood by said again
	to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilean, and
	thy speech agreeth thereto</b>—"bewrayeth [or 'discovereth']
	thee" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:73">Matthew 26:73</span>). In Luke
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:59">Luke 22:59</span>) it is, "Another
	confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this [fellow] also was with
	him: for he is a Galilean." The Galilean dialect had a more
	<i>Syrian</i> cast than that of Judea. <i>If Peter had held his
	peace,</i> this peculiarity had not been observed; but hoping,
	probably, to put them off the scent by joining in the <i>fireside
	talk,</i> he was thus discovered. The Fourth Gospel is particularly
	interesting here: "One of the servants of the high priest, being
	his kinsman [or kinsman to him] whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did
	not I see thee in the garden with Him?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+22:59- :">Luke 22:59- :</span>). No doubt his relationship to Malchus drew his attention
	to the man who had smitten him, and this enabled him to identify
	Peter. "Sad reprisals!" exclaims BENGEL.
	Poor Peter! Thou art caught in thine own toils; but like a wild bull
	in a net, thou wilt toss and rage, filling up the measure of thy
	terrible declension by one more denial of thy Lord, and that the
	foulest of all.</p>
