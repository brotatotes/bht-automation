<p><b>8. She hath done what she could</b>—a
	noble testimony, embodying a principle of immense importance. 
	</p>
<p><b>she is come aforehand to
	anoint my body to the burying</b>—or, as in John (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "Against the day of my burying hath she kept this."
	Not that she, dear heart, thought of His burial, much less reserved
	any of her nard to anoint her dead Lord. But as the time was so near
	at hand when that office would have to be performed, <i>and she was
	not to have that privilege even after the spices were brought for the
	purpose</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:1">Mark 16:1</span>), He
	lovingly <i>regards it as done now.</i> "In the act of love done
	to Him," says OLSHAUSEN
	beautifully, "she has erected to herself an eternal monument, as
	lasting as the Gospel, the eternal Word of God. From generation to
	generation this remarkable prophecy of the Lord has been fulfilled;
	and even we, in explaining this saying of the Redeemer, of necessity
	contribute to its accomplishment." "Who but Himself,"
	asks STIER, "had the
	power to ensure to any work of man, even if resounding in His own
	time through the whole earth, an imperishable remembrance in the
	stream of history? Behold once more here the majesty of His royal
	judicial supremacy in the government of the world, in this, 'Verily I
	say unto you.'"</p>
