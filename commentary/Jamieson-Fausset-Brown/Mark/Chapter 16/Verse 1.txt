1. And when the sabbath was
	past—that is, at sunset of our Saturday. 
	Mary Magdalene—(See on
	 :-). 
	and Mary the mother of
	James—James the Less (see  :-). 
	and Salome—the mother
	of Zebedee's sons (compare Mark 15:40;
	Matthew 27:56). 
	had bought sweet spices, that
	they might come and anoint him—The word is simply "bought."
	But our translators are perhaps right in rendering it here "had
	bought," since it would appear, from Matthew 27:56- :, that they had purchased them immediately after the
	Crucifixion, on the Friday evening, during the short interval
	that remained to them before sunset, when the sabbath rest began; and
	that they had only deferred using them to anoint the body till the
	sabbath rest should be over. On this "anointing," see on
	Matthew 27:56- :.
