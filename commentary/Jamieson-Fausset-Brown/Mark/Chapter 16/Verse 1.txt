<p><b>1. And when the sabbath was
	past</b>—that is, at sunset of our Saturday.

<p><b>Mary Magdalene</b>—(See on

<p><b>and Mary the mother of
	James</b>—James the Less (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>and Salome</b>—the mother
	of Zebedee's sons (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+15:40">Mark 15:40</span>;

<p><b>had bought sweet spices, that
	they might come and anoint him</b>—The word is simply "bought."
	But our translators are perhaps right in rendering it here "had
	bought," since it would appear, from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:56- :">Matthew 27:56- :</span>, that they had purchased them immediately after the
	Crucifixion, on the <i>Friday</i> evening, during the short interval
	that remained to them before sunset, when the sabbath rest began; and
	that they had only deferred using them to anoint the body till the
	sabbath rest should be over. On this "anointing," see on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:56- :">Matthew 27:56- :</span>.</p>
