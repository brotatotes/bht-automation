<p><b>16. He that believeth and is
	baptized</b>—Baptism is here put for the external signature of the
	inner faith of the heart, just as "confessing with the mouth"
	is in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:10">Romans 10:10</span>; and there also
	as here this <i>outward</i> manifestation, once mentioned as the
	proper fruit of faith, is not repeated in what follows (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:10- :">Romans 10:10- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>shall be saved; but he that
	believeth not shall be damned</b>—These awful issues of the
	reception or rejection of the Gospel, though often recorded in other
	connections, are given in this connection only by Mark.</p>
