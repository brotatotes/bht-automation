<p><b>19. So then after the Lord</b>—an
	epithet applied to Jesus by this Evangelist only in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:19">Mark 16:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:20">Mark 16:20</span>, when He comes to His
	glorious Ascension and its subsequent fruits. It is most frequent in
	Luke.

<p><b>had spoken unto them, he was
	received up into heaven</b>—See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+16:20- :">Mark 16:20- :</span>.

<p><b>and sat on the right hand of
	God</b>—This great truth is here only related as a fact in the
	Gospel history. In that exalted attitude He appeared to Stephen
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:55">Acts 7:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>);
	and it is thereafter perpetually referred to as His proper condition
	in glory.</p>
