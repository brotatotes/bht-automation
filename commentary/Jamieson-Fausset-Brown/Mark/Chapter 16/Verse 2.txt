<p><b>2. And very early in the

<p><b>the first day of the week,
	they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun</b>—not quite
	literally, but "at earliest dawn"; according to a way of
	speaking not uncommon, and occurring sometimes in the Old Testament.
	Thus our Lord rose on the third day; having lain in the grave part of
	Friday, the whole of Saturday, and part of the following First day.</p>
