2. And very early in the
	morning—(See on  :-). 
	the first day of the week,
	they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun—not quite
	literally, but "at earliest dawn"; according to a way of
	speaking not uncommon, and occurring sometimes in the Old Testament.
	Thus our Lord rose on the third day; having lain in the grave part of
	Friday, the whole of Saturday, and part of the following First day.
