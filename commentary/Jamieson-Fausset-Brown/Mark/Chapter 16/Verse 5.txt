<p><b>5. And entering into the sepulchre,
	they saw a young man</b>—In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> he is called "the angel of the Lord"; but here he
	is described as he appeared to the eye, in the bloom of a life that
	knows no decay. In Matthew he is represented as sitting on the stone
	<i>outside</i> the sepulchre; but since even there he says, "<i>Come,</i>
	see the place where the Lord lay" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), he seems, as ALFORD
	says, to have gone in with them from without; only awaiting their
	arrival to accompany them into the hallowed spot, and instruct them
	about it.

<p><b>sitting on the right
	side</b>—having respect to the position in which His Lord had lain
	there. This trait is peculiar to Mark; but compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.
