9. Now when Jesus was risen early
	the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out
	of whom he had cast seven devilsâ€”There is some difficulty here,
	and different ways of removing it have been adopted. She had gone
	with the other women to the sepulchre ( :-), parting from them, perhaps, before their interview with
	the angel, and on finding Peter and John she had come with them back
	to the spot; and it was at this second visit, it would seem, that
	Jesus appeared to this Mary, as detailed in  :-. To a woman was this honor given to be the first that
	saw the risen Redeemer, and that woman was NOT
	his virgin-mother.
