	"The bed had borne the man: now the man bore the bed."

<p><b>and went forth before them

	work such a glorious miracle of healing, must indeed "have power

	forgiveness of sins pronounced by Human Lips. In Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) it is, "They marvelled, and glorified God, which had

	not, but that a man, to all appearance like one of themselves, should
