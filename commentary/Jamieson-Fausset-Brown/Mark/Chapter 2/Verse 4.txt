<p><b>4. And when they could not come nigh
	unto him for the press</b>—or, as in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "when they could not find by what way they might
	bring him in because of the multitude," they "went upon the
	housetop"—the flat or terrace-roof, universal in Eastern
	houses. 
	</p>
<p><b>they uncovered the roof where
	he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed</b>—or
	portable couch 
	</p>
<p><b>wherein the sick of the palsy
	lay</b>—Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:19">Luke 5:19</span>) says,
	they "let him down through the tilling with his couch into the
	midst before Jesus." Their whole object was to <i>bring the
	patient into the presence of Jesus;</i> and this not being possible
	in the ordinary way, because of the multitude that surrounded Him,
	they took the very unusual method here described of accomplishing
	their object, and succeeded. Several explanations have been given of
	the way in which this was done; but unless we knew the precise plan
	of the house, and the part of it from which Jesus taught—which may
	have been a quadrangle or open court, within the buildings of which
	Peter's house was one, or a gallery covered by a veranda—it is
	impossible to determine precisely how the thing was done. One thing,
	however, is clear, that we have both the accounts from an
	eye-witness.</p>
