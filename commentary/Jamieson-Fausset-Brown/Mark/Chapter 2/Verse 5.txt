5. When Jesus saw their faith—It
	is remarkable that all the three narratives call it "their
	faith" which Jesus saw. That the patient himself had faith, we
	know from the proclamation of his forgiveness, which Jesus made
	before all; and we should have been apt to conclude that his four
	friends bore him to Jesus merely out of benevolent compliance with
	the urgent entreaties of the poor sufferer. But here we learn, not
	only that his bearers had the same faith with himself, but that Jesus
	marked it as a faith which was not to be defeated—a faith
	victorious over all difficulties. This was the faith for which He was
	ever on the watch, and which He never saw without marking, and, in
	those who needed anything from Him, richly rewarding. 
	he said unto the sick of the
	palsy, Son—"be of good cheer" ( :-). 
	thy sins be forgiven thee—By
	the word "be," our translators perhaps meant "are,"
	as in Luke (Luke 5:20). For it is
	not a command to his sins to depart, but an authoritative
	proclamation of the man's pardoned state as a believer. And yet, as
	the Pharisees understood our Lord to be dispensing pardon by
	this saying, and Jesus not only acknowledges that they were right,
	but founds His whole argument upon the correctness of it, we must
	regard the saying as a royal proclamation of the man's forgiveness by
	Him to whom it belonged to dispense it; nor could such a style of
	address be justified on any lower supposition. (See on Luke 5:20- :, &c.).
