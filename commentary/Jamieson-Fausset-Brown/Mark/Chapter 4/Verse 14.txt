14. The sower soweth the wordâ€”or,
	as in Luke (Luke 8:11), "Now
	the parable is this: The seed is the word of God." But
	who is "the sower?" This is not expressed here because if
	"the word of God" be the seed, every scatterer of that
	precious seed must be regarded as a sower. It is true that in the
	parable of the tares it is said, "He that soweth the good seed
	is the Son of man," as "He that soweth the tares is the
	devil" (Matthew 13:37; Matthew 13:38).
	But these are only the great unseen parties, struggling in this world
	for the possession of man. Each of these has his agents among men
	themselves; and Christ's agents in the sowing of the good seed are
	the preachers of the word. Thus, as in all the cases about to
	be described, the sower is the same, and the seed is the same; while
	the result is entirely different, the whole difference must lie in
	the soils, which mean the different states of the human
	heart. And so, the great general lesson held forth in this
	parable of the sower is, that however faithful the preacher, and how
	pure soever his message, the effect of the preaching of the word
	depends upon the state of the hearer's heart. Now follow the
	cases. See on Mark 4:4.
