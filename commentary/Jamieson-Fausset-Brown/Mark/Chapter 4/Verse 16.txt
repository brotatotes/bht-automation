	But the sun, beating on it, as quickly scorches and withers it up,
	"because it has no root" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and "lacks moisture" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The great truth here taught is that <i>hearts superficially

	heat of tribulation or persecution because of the word, or <i>the
	trials which their new profession brings upon them quickly dries up
	their relish for the truth, and withers all the hasty promise of
	fruit which they showed.</i> Such disappointing issues of a faithful
