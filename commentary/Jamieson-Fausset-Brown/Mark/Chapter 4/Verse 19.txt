19. And the cares of this world, and
	the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering
	in—or "the pleasures of this life" ( :-). 
	choke the word, and it
	becometh unfruitful—First, "The cares of this
	world"—anxious, unrelaxing attention to the business of this
	present life; second, "The deceitfulness of riches"—of
	those riches which are the fruit of this worldly "care";
	third, "The pleasures of this life," or "the lusts of
	other things entering in"—the enjoyments in themselves may be
	innocent, which worldly prosperity enables one to indulge. These
	"choke" or "smother" the word;
	drawing off so much of one's attention, absorbing so much of one's
	interest, and using up so much of one's time, that only the dregs of
	these remain for spiritual things, and a fagged, hurried, and
	heartless formalism is at length all the religion of such persons.
	What a vivid picture is this of the mournful condition of many,
	especially in great commercial countries, who once promised much
	fruit! "They bring no fruit to perfection" ( :-); indicating how much growth there may be, in the
	early stages of such a case, and promise of fruit—which
	after all never ripens.
