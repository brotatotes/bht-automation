<p><b>20. And these are they which are
	sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring
	forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred</b>â€”A
	heart soft and tender, stirred to its depths on the great things of
	eternity, and jealously guarded from worldly engrossments, such only
	is the "honest and good heart" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), which "keeps," that is, "retains" the
	seed of the word, and bears fruit just in proportion as it is such a
	heart. Such "bring forth fruit with <i>patience</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), or continuance, "enduring to the end"; in
	contrast with those in whom the word is "choked" and brings
	no fruit <i>to perfection.</i> The "thirtyfold" is designed
	to express the <i>lowest</i> degree of fruitfulness; the
	"hundredfold" the <i>highest;</i> and the "sixtyfold"
	the <i>intermediate</i> degrees of fruitfulness. As a "hundredfold,"
	though not unexampled (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+26:12">Genesis 26:12</span>),
	is a rare return in the natural husbandry, so the highest degrees of
	spiritual fruitfulness are too seldom witnessed. The closing words of
	this introductory parable seem designed to call attention to the
	<i>fundamental</i> and <i>universal</i> character of it.</p>
