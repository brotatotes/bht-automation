<p><b>25. For he that hath, to him shall
	be given; and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that
	which he hath</b>â€”or "seemeth to have," or "thinketh
	he hath." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	This "having" and "thinking he hath" are not
	different; for when it hangs loosely upon him, and is not
	appropriated to its proper ends and uses, it both <i>is</i> and <i>is
	not his.</i>

<p><i>Parable of the Seed Growing We
	Know Not How</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p>This beautiful parable is peculiar
	to Mark. Its design is to teach the <i>Imperceptible Growth</i> of
	the word sown in the heart, from its earliest stage of development to
	the ripest fruits of practical righteousness.</p>
