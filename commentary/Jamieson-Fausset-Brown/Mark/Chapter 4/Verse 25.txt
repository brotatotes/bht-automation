25. For he that hath, to him shall
	be given; and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that
	which he hathâ€”or "seemeth to have," or "thinketh
	he hath." (See on  :-).
	This "having" and "thinking he hath" are not
	different; for when it hangs loosely upon him, and is not
	appropriated to its proper ends and uses, it both is and is
	not his.
Parable of the Seed Growing We
	Know Not How ( :-). 
	This beautiful parable is peculiar
	to Mark. Its design is to teach the Imperceptible Growth of
	the word sown in the heart, from its earliest stage of development to
	the ripest fruits of practical righteousness.
