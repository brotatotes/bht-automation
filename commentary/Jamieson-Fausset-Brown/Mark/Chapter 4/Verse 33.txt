<p><b>33. And with many such parables
	spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it</b>â€”Had
	this been said in the corresponding passage of Matthew, we should
	have concluded that what that Evangelist recorded was but a specimen
	of other parables spoken on the same occasion. But Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) says, "All <i>these</i> things spake Jesus unto the
	multitude in parables"; and as Mark records only some of the
	parables which Matthew gives, we are warranted to infer that the
	"many such parables" alluded to here mean no more than the
	full complement of them which we find in Matthew.</p>
