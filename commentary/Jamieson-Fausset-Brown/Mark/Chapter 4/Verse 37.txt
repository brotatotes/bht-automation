37. And there arose a great storm of
	wind—"a tempest of wind." To such sudden squalls the
	Sea of Galilee is very liable from its position, in a deep basin,
	skirted on the east by lofty mountain ranges, while on the west the
	hills are intersected by narrow gorges through which the wind sweeps
	across the lake, and raises its waters with great rapidity into a
	storm. 
	and the waves beat into the
	ship—kept beating or pitching on the ship. 
	so that it was now
	full—rather, "so that it was already filling." In
	Matthew (Matthew 8:24), "insomuch
	that the ship was covered with the waves"; but this is too
	strong. It should be, "so that the ship was getting covered by
	the waves." So we must translate the word used in Luke (Matthew 8:24- :) —not as in our version—"And there came down a
	storm on the lake, and they were filled [with water]"—but
	"they were getting filled," that is, those who sailed;
	meaning, of course, that their ship was so.
