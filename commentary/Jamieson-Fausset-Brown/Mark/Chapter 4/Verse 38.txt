<p><b>38. And he was in the hinder part of
	the ship</b>—or stern. 
	</p>
<p><b>asleep on a pillow</b>—either
	a place in the vessel made to receive the head, or a cushion for the
	head to rest on. It was evening; and after the fatigues of a busy day
	of teaching under the hot sun, having nothing to do while crossing
	the lake, He sinks into a deep sleep, which even this tempest raging
	around and tossing the little vessel did not disturb. 
	</p>
<p><b>and they awake him, and say
	unto him, Master</b>—or "Teacher." In Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) this is doubled—in token of their life-and-death
	earnestness—"Master, Master." 
	</p>
<p><b>carest thou not that we
	perish?</b>—Unbelief and fear made them sadly forget their place,
	to speak so. Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:25">Matthew 8:25</span>)
	has it, "Lord, save us, we perish." When those accustomed
	to fish upon that deep thus spake, the danger must have been
	imminent. They say nothing of what would become of <i>Him,</i> if
	they perished; nor think, whether, if He could not perish, it was
	likely He would let this happen to them; but they hardly knew what
	they said.</p>
