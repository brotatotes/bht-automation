<p><b>40. And he said unto them, Why are
	ye so fearful?</b>—There is a natural apprehension under danger;
	but there was unbelief in their fear. It is worthy of notice how
	considerately the Lord defers this rebuke till He had first removed
	the danger, in the midst of which they would not have been in a state
	to listen to anything. 
	</p>
<p><b>how is it that ye have no
	faith?</b>—next to none, or none in present exercise. In Matthew
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:26">Matthew 8:26</span>) it is, "Why are
	ye fearful, O ye of little faith?" <i>Faith</i> they had, for
	they applied to Christ for relief: but <i>little,</i> for they were
	afraid, though Christ was in the ship. Faith dispels fear, but only
	in proportion to its strength.</p>
