	where it had not much earthâ€”"the rocky ground"; in
	Matthew (Matthew 13:5), "the
	rocky places"; in Luke (Matthew 13:5- :), "the rock." The thing intended is, not ground
	with stones in it which would not prevent the roots striking
	downward, but ground where a quite thin surface of earth covers a
	rock. What means this? See on Matthew 13:5- :.

	 THORNY GROUND.

	Mark 4:19).
