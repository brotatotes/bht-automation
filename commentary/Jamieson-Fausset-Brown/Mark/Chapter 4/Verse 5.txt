<p><b>5. And some fell on stony ground,
	where it had not much earth</b>â€”"the rocky ground"; in
	Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:5">Matthew 13:5</span>), "the
	rocky places"; in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:5- :">Matthew 13:5- :</span>), "the rock." The thing intended is, not ground
	with stones in it which would not prevent the roots striking
	downward, but ground where a quite thin surface of earth covers a
	rock. What means this? See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:5- :">Matthew 13:5- :</span>.
