	would not send them away out of the country—The entreaty, it
	will be observed, was made by one spirit, but in behalf of
	many—"he besought Him not to send them,
	&c."—just as in Mark 5:9,
	"he answered we are many." But what do they
	mean by entreating so earnestly not to be ordered out of the country?
	Their next petition (Mark 5:12)
	will make that clear enough.
