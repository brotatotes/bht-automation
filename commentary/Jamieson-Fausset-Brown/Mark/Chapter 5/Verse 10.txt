<p><b>10. And he besought him much that he
	would not send them away out of the country</b>—The entreaty, it
	will be observed, was made by <i>one spirit,</i> but in behalf of
	<i>many</i>—"<i>he</i> besought Him not to send <i>them,</i>
	&amp;c."—just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:9">Mark 5:9</span>,
	"<i>he</i> answered <i>we</i> are many." But what do they
	mean by entreating so earnestly not to be ordered out of the country?
	Their next petition (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+5:12">Mark 5:12</span>)
	will make that clear enough.</p>
