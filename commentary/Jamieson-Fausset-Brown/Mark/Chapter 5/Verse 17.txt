<p><b>17. And they began to pray him to
	depart out of their coasts</b>—Was it the owners only of the
	valuable property now lost to them that did this? Alas, no! For Luke
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:37">Luke 8:37</span>) says, "Then the
	whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought
	Him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear."
	The evil spirits had thus, alas! their object. Irritated, the people
	could not suffer His presence; yet awe-struck, they dared not order
	Him off: so they entreat Him to withdraw, and—He takes them at
	their word.</p>
