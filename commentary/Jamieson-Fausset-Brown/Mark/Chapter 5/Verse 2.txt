<p><b>there met him a man with an

	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:27">Luke 8:27</span>). In Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:27- :">Luke 8:27- :</span>), "there met him two men possessed with devils."
	Though there be no discrepancy between these two statements—more
	than between two witnesses, one of whom testifies to something done
	by one person, while the other affirms that there were two—it is
	difficult to see how the principal details here given could apply to
	more than one case.</p>
