<p><b>21. And when Jesus was passed over
	again by ship unto the other side</b>—from the Gadarene side of the
	lake, where He had parted with the healed demoniac, to the west side,
	at Capernaum. 
	</p>
<p><b>much people gathered unto
	him</b>—who "gladly received Him; for they were all waiting
	for Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:40">Luke 8:40</span>). The
	abundant teaching earlier that day (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:1-34">Mark 4:1-34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1-58">Matthew 13:1-58</span>) had only
	whetted the people's appetite: and disappointed, as would seem, that
	He had left them in the evening to cross the lake, they remain
	hanging about the beach, having got a hint, probably through some of
	His disciples, that He would be back the same evening. Perhaps they
	witnessed at a distance the sudden calming of the tempest. The tide
	of our Lord's popularity was now fast rising.

<p><b>and he was nigh unto the sea.</b></p>
