<p><b>22. And, behold, there cometh one of
	the rulers of the synagogue</b>—of which class there were but few
	who believed in Jesus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:48">John 7:48</span>).
	One would suppose from this that the ruler had been with the
	multitude on the shore, anxiously awaiting the return of Jesus, and
	immediately on His arrival had accosted Him as here related. But
	Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:18">Matthew 9:18</span>) tells us that
	the ruler came to Him while He was in the act of speaking at His own
	table on the subject of fasting; and as we must suppose that this
	converted publican ought to know what took place on that memorable
	occasion when he made a feast to his Lord, we conclude that here the
	right order is indicated by the First Evangelist alone.

<p><b>Jairus by name</b>—or
	"Jaeirus." It is the same name as <i>Jair,</i> in the Old
	Testament (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+32:41">Numbers 32:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+10:3">Judges 10:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="es+2:5">Esther 2:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and when he saw him, he fell
	at his feet</b>—in Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="es+2:5- :">Esther 2:5- :</span>), "worshipped Him." The meaning is the same in
	both.</p>
