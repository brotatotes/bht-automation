<p><b>23. And besought him greatly,
	saying, My little daughter</b>—Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) says, "He had one only daughter, about twelve years of
	age." According to a well-known rabbin, quoted by LIGHTFOOT,
	a daughter, till she had completed her twelfth year, was called
	"little," or "a little maid"; after that, "a
	young woman." 
	</p>
<p><b>lieth at the point of
	death</b>—Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+9:18">Matthew 9:18</span>)
	gives it thus: "My daughter is even now dead"—"has
	just expired." The news of her death reached the father after
	the cure of the woman with the issue of blood: but Matthew's brief
	account gives only the <i>result,</i> as in the case of the
	centurion's servant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:5">Matthew 8:5</span>,
	c.). 
	</p>
<p><b>come and lay thy hands on
	her, that she may be healed and she shall live</b>—or, "that
	she may be healed and live," according to a fully preferable
	reading. In one of the class to which this man belonged, so steeped
	in prejudice, such faith would imply more than in others.

	Blood Healed</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:5- :">Matthew 8:5- :</span>).</p>
