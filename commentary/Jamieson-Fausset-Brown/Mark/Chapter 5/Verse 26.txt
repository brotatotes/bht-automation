<p><b>26. And had suffered many things of
	many physicians</b>—The expression perhaps does not necessarily
	refer to the suffering she endured under medical treatment, but to
	the much varied treatment which she underwent. 
	</p>
<p><b>and had spent all that she
	had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse</b>—pitiable
	case, and affectingly aggravated; emblem of our natural state as
	fallen creatures (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:5">Ezekiel 16:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:6">Ezekiel 16:6</span>), and illustrating the
	worse than vanity of all human remedies for spiritual maladies (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:6- :">Ezekiel 16:6- :</span>). The higher design of all our Lord's miracles of healing
	irresistibly suggests this way of viewing the present case, the
	propriety of which will still more appear as we proceed.</p>
