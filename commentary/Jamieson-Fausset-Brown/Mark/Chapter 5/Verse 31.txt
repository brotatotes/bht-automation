<p><b>31. And his disciples said unto
	him</b>—Luke says (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:45">Luke 8:45</span>),
	"When all denied, Peter and they that were with Him said,
	Master." 
	</p>
<p><b>Thou seest the multitude
	thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</b>—"Askest
	thou, Lord, who touched Thee? Rather ask who touched Thee not in such
	a throng." "And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched Me"—"a
	certain person has touched Me"—"for I perceive that
	virtue is gone out of Me" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:45- :">Luke 8:45- :</span>). Yes, the multitude "<i>thronged</i> and <i>pressed</i>
	Him"—they <i>jostled against</i> Him, but all <i>involuntarily;</i>
	they were merely <i>carried along;</i> but one, one only—"a
	certain person—TOUCHED
	HIM," with the
	conscious, voluntary, dependent touch of faith, reaching forth its
	hand expressly to have contact with Him. This and this only Jesus
	acknowledges and seeks out. Even so, as AUGUSTINE
	long ago said, <i>multitudes still come similarly close to Christ in
	the means of grace, but all to no purpose, being only sucked into the
	crowd.</i> The voluntary, living contact of faith is that electric
	conductor which alone draws virtue out of Him.</p>
