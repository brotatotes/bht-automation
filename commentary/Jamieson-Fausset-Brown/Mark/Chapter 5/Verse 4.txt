<p><b>4. Because that he had been often
	bound with fetters and chains,</b> c.â€”Luke says (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) that "oftentimes it [the unclean spirit] had caught
	him" and after mentioning how they had vainly tried to bind him
	with chains and fetters, because, "he brake the bands," he
	adds, "and was driven of the devil [demon] into the wilderness."
	The dark tyrant-power by which he was held clothed him with
	superhuman strength and made him scorn restraint. Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) says he was "exceeding fierce, so that no man might
	pass by that way." He was the terror of the whole locality.</p>
