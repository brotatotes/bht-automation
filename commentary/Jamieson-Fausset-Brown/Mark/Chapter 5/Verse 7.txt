7. What have I to do with thee,
	Jesus, Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou
	torment me notâ€”or, as in  :-, "Art Thou come to torment us before the time?"
	(See on Mark 1:24). Behold the
	tormentor anticipating, dreading, and entreating exemption
	from torment! In Christ they discern their destined Tormentor;
	the time, they know, is fixed, and they feel as if it were come
	already! (James 2:19).
