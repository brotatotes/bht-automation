<p><b>7. What have I to do with thee,
	Jesus, Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou
	torment me not</b>â€”or, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Art Thou come to torment us before the time?"
	(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:24">Mark 1:24</span>). Behold the
	<i>tormentor</i> anticipating, dreading, and entreating exemption
	from <i>torment!</i> In Christ they discern their destined Tormentor;
	the time, they know, is fixed, and they feel as if it were come
	already! (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:19">James 2:19</span>).</p>
