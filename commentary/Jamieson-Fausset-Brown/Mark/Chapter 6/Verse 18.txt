<p><b>18. For John had said unto Herod, It
	is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife</b>â€”Noble
	fidelity! It was not lawful because Herod's wife and Herodias'
	husband were both living; and further, because the parties were
	within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); Herodias being the daughter of Aristobulus, the brother
	of both Herod and Philip [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 18.5,4].</p>
