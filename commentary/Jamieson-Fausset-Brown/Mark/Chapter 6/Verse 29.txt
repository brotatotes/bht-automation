29. And when his disciples heard of
	it—that is, the Baptist's own disciples. 
	they came and took up his
	corpse, and laid it in a tomb—"and went and told Jesus"
	(Matthew 14:12). If these disciples
	had, up to this time, stood apart from Him, as adherents of John (Matthew 14:12- :), perhaps they now came to Jesus, not without some secret
	reflection on Him for His seeming neglect of their master; but
	perhaps, too, as orphans, to cast in their lot henceforth with the
	Lord's disciples. How Jesus felt, or what He said, on receiving this
	intelligence, is not recorded; but He of whom it was said, as He
	stood by the grave of His friend Lazarus, "Jesus wept," was
	not likely to receive such intelligence without deep emotion. And one
	reason why He might not be unwilling that a small body of John's
	disciples should cling to him to the last, might be to provide some
	attached friends who should do for his precious body, on a small
	scale, what was afterwards to be done for His own. 
	Matthew 14:12- :. THE TWELVE
	ON THEIR RETURN,
	HAVING REPORTED
	THE SUCCESS OF
	THEIR MISSION,
	JESUS CROSSES
	THE SEA OF GALILEE
	WITH THEM, TEACHES
	THE PEOPLE, AND
	MIRACULOUSLY FEEDS
	THEM TO THE NUMBER
	OF FIVE THOUSAND—HE
	SENDS HIS
	DISCIPLES BY SHIP
	AGAIN TO THE WESTERN
	SIDE, WHILE
	HE HIMSELF
	RETURNS AFTERWARDS
	WALKING ON THE
	SEA—INCIDENTS
	ON LANDING. ( =
	Matthew 14:13-36; Luke 9:10-17;
	John 6:1-24). 
	Here, for the first time, all the
	four streams of sacred text run parallel. The occasion and all the
	circumstances of this grand section are thus brought before us with a
	vividness quite remarkable.
