<p><b>they came and took up his
	corpse, and laid it in a tomb</b>—"and went and told Jesus"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:12">Matthew 14:12</span>). If these disciples
	had, up to this time, stood apart from Him, as adherents of John (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:12- :">Matthew 14:12- :</span>), perhaps they now came to Jesus, not without some secret
	reflection on Him for His seeming neglect of their master; but
	perhaps, too, as orphans, to cast in their lot henceforth with the
	Lord's disciples. How Jesus felt, or what He said, on receiving this
	intelligence, is not recorded; but He of whom it was said, as He
	stood by the grave of His friend Lazarus, "Jesus wept," was
	not likely to receive such intelligence without deep emotion. And one
	reason why He might not be unwilling that a small body of John's
	disciples should cling to him to the last, might be to provide some
	attached friends who should do for his precious body, on a small
	scale, what was afterwards to be done for His own.
