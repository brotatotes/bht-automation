<p><b>30. And the apostles gathered
	themselves together</b>—probably at Capernaum, on returning from
	their mission (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:7-13">Mark 6:7-13</span>).

<p><b>and told him all things, both
	what they had done, and what they had taught</b>—Observe the
	various reasons He had for crossing to the other side. First, Matthew
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:13">Matthew 14:13</span>) says, that "when
	Jesus heard" of the murder of His faithful forerunner—from
	those attached disciples of his who had taken up his body and laid it
	in a sepulchre (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:29">Mark 6:29</span>)
	—"He departed by ship into a desert place apart"; either
	to avoid some apprehended consequences to Himself, arising from the
	Baptist's death (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23">Matthew 10:23</span>), or
	more probably to be able to indulge in those feelings which that
	affecting event had doubtless awakened, and to which the bustle of
	the multitude around Him was very unfavorable. Next, since He must
	have heard the report of the Twelve with the deepest interest, and
	probably with something of the emotion which He experienced on the
	return of the Seventy (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:23- :">Matthew 10:23- :</span>), He sought privacy for undisturbed reflection on this
	begun preaching and progress of His kingdom. Once more, He was
	wearied with the multitude of "comers and goers"—depriving
	Him even of leisure enough to take His food—and wanted <i>rest:</i>
	"Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a
	while," &amp;c. Under the combined influence of all these
	considerations, our Lord sought this change.</p>
