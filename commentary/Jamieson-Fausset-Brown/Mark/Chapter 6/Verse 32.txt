32. And they departed into a desert
	place by ship privatelyâ€”"over the Sea of Galilee, which is
	the Sea of Tiberias," says John ( :-), the only one of the Evangelists who so fully describes it;
	the others having written when their readers were supposed to know
	something of it, while the last wrote for those at a greater distance
	of time and place. This "desert place" is more definitely
	described by Luke (Luke 9:10) as
	"belonging to the city called Bethsaida." This must not be
	confounded with the town so called on the western side of the lake
	(see on Luke 9:10- :). This town lay on
	its northeastern side, near where the Jordan empties itself into it:
	in Gaulonitis, out of the dominions of Herod Antipas, and within the
	dominions of Philip the Tetrarch (Luke 9:10- :), who raised it from a village to a city, and called it
	Julias, in honor of Julia, the daughter of Augustus [JOSEPHUS,
	Antiquities, 18.2,1].
