<p><b>35. And when the day was now far
	spent</b>â€”"began to wear away" or "decline,"
	says Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:12">Luke 9:12</span>). Matthew
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:15">Matthew 14:15</span>) says, "when it
	was evening"; and yet he mentions a later evening of the same
	day (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:23">Mark 6:23</span>). This earlier
	evening began at three P.M.;
	the latter began at sunset.</p>
