36. Send them away, that they may go
	into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy
	themselves bread: for they have nothing to eatâ€”John tells us
	(John 6:5; John 6:6)
	that "Jesus said to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that
	these may eat? (And this He said to prove him: for He Himself knew
	what He would do)." The subject may have been introduced by some
	remark of the disciples; but the precise order and form of what was
	said by each can hardly be gathered with precision, nor is it of any
	importance.
