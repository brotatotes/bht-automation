<p><b>42. And they did all eat, and were
	filled</b>—All the four Evangelists mention this: and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) adds, "and likewise of the fishes, as much as they
	would"—to show that vast as was the multitude, and scanty the
	provisions, the meal to each and all of them was a plentiful one.
	"When they were filled, He said unto His disciples, Gather up
	the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). This was designed to bring out the whole extent of the
	miracle.</p>
