	the sea, and he alone on the land—John says (John 6:16- :), "It was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them."
	Perhaps they made no great effort to push across at first, having a
	lingering hope that their Master would yet join them, and so allowed
	the darkness to come on. "And the sea arose" (adds the
	beloved disciple, John 6:18),
	"by reason of a great wind that blew."
