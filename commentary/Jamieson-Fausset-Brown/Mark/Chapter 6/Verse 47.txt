<p><b>47. And when even was come</b>—the
	later evening (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:35">Mark 6:35</span>).
	It had come even when the disciples embarked (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:23">Matthew 14:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:16">John 6:16</span>).

<p><b>the ship was in the midst of
	the sea, and he alone on the land</b>—John says (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:16- :">John 6:16- :</span>), "It was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them."
	Perhaps they made no great effort to push across at first, having a
	lingering hope that their Master would yet join them, and so allowed
	the darkness to come on. "And the sea arose" (adds the
	beloved disciple, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:18">John 6:18</span>),
	"by reason of a great wind that blew."</p>
