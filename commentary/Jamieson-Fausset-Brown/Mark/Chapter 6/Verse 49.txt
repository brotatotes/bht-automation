49. But when they saw him walking
	upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried outâ€”"for
	fear" (Matthew 14:26). He
	would appear to them at first like a dark moving speck upon the
	waters; then as a human figure; but in the dark tempestuous sky, and
	not dreaming that it could be their Lord, they take it for a spirit.
	Compare Luke 24:37.
