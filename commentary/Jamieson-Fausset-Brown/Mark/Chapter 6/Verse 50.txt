<p style="margin-left: 1.25em; "><b>50. For they
	all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them,
	and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: It is I; be not afraid</b>—There
	is something in these two little words—given by Matthew, Mark and
	John (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:27">Matthew 14:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:50">Mark 6:50</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:20">John 6:20</span>) —"It is I,"
	which from the mouth that spake it and the circumstances in which it
	was uttered, passes the power of language to express. Here were they
	in the midst of a raging sea, their little bark the sport of the
	elements, and with just enough of light to descry an object on the
	waters which only aggravated their fears. But Jesus deems it enough
	to dispel all apprehension to let them know that <i>He was there.</i>
	From other lips that "I am" would have merely meant that
	the person speaking was such a one and not another person. That,
	surely, would have done little to calm the fears of men expecting
	every minute, it may be, to go to the bottom. But spoken by One who
	at that moment was "treading upon the waves of the sea,"
	and was about to hush the raging elements with His word, what was it
	but the Voice which cried of old in the ears of Israel, even from the
	days of Moses, "I AM";
	"I, EVEN I, AM
	HE!" Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:5">John 18:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:6">John 18:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:58">John 8:58</span>.
	Now, that Word is "made flesh, and dwells among us,"
	uttering itself from beside us in dear familiar tones—"It is
	the Voice of my Beloved!" How far was this apprehended by these
	frightened disciples? There was one, we know, in the boat who
	outstripped all the rest in susceptibility to such sublime appeals.
	It was not the deep-toned writer of the Fourth Gospel, who, though he
	lived to soar beyond all the apostles, was as yet too young for
	prominence, and all unripe. It was Simon Barjonas. Here follows a
	very remarkable and instructive episode, recorded by Matthew alone:

	not, seeing only the power of Christ, in the lively exercise of
	faith. Now he "<i>sees</i>" the fury of the elements, and
	immediately the power of Christ to bear him up fades before his view,
	and this makes him "afraid"—as how could he be otherwise,
	without any <i>felt</i> power to keep him up? He then "begins to
	sink"; and finally, conscious that his experiment had failed, he
	casts himself, in a sort of desperate confidence, upon his "Lord"
	for deliverance!

	loving reproof, which owns the <i>faith</i> that had ventured on the
