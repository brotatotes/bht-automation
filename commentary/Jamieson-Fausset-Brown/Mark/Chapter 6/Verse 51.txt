51. And he went up unto them into
	the ship—John (John 6:21)
	says, "Then they willingly received him into the ship"—or
	rather, "Then were they willing to receive Him" (with
	reference to their previous terror); but implying also a glad
	welcome, their first fears now converted into wonder and delight.
	"And immediately," adds the beloved disciple, "they
	were at the land whither they went," or "were bound."
	This additional miracle, for as such it is manifestly related, is
	recorded by the fourth Evangelist alone. As the storm was suddenly
	calmed, so the little bark—propelled by the secret power of the
	Lord of nature now sailing in it—glided through the now unruffled
	waters, and, while they were wrapt in wonder at what had happened,
	not heeding their rapid motion, was found at port, to their
	still further surprise. 
	 "Then are they
	glad, because at rest 
	 And quiet now they
	be; 
	 So to the haven He them
	brings 
	 Which they desired to
	see." 
	
Matthew (John 6:21- :) says, "Then they that were in the ship came [that is,
	ere they got to land] and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth Thou art
	the Son of God." But our Evangelist is wonderfully striking. 
	and the wind ceased and they
	were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered—The
	Evangelist seems hardly to find language strong enough to express
	their astonishment.
