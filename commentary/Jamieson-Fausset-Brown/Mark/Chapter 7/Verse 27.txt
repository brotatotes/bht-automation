27. But Jesus said unto her, Let the
	children first be filled—"Is there hope for me here?"
	"Filled FIRST?"
	"Then my turn, it seems, is coming!—but then, 'The
	CHILDREN first?' Ah! when,
	on that rule, shall my turn ever come!" But ere she has time for
	these ponderings of His word, another word comes to supplement it. 
	for it is not meet to take
	the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs—Is this the
	death of her hopes? Nay, rather it is life from the dead. Out of the
	eater shall come forth meat ( :-). "At evening-time, it shall be light" ( :-). "Ah! I have it now. Had He kept silence, what could I
	have done but go unblest? but He hath spoken, and the victory is
	mine."
