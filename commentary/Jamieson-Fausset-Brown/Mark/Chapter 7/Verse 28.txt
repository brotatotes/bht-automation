<p><b>28. And she answered and said unto
	him, Yes, Lord</b>—or, as the same word is rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. "Truth, Lord." 
	</p>
<p><b>yet the dogs eat of the
	children's crumbs</b>—"which fall from their master's table"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+15:27">Matthew 15:27</span>). "I thank
	Thee, O blessed One, for that word! That's my whole case. Not of the
	children? True. A dog? True also: <i>Yet</i> the dogs under the table
	are allowed to eat of the children's crumbs—the droppings from
	their master's full table: Give me that, and I am content: One crumb
	of power and grace from Thy table shall cast the devil out of my
	daughter." Oh, what lightning quickness, what reach of
	instinctive ingenuity, do we behold in this heathen woman!</p>
