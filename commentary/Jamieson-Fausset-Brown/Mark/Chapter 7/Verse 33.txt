33. And he took him aside from the
	multitude—As in another case He "took the blind man by the
	hand and led him out of the town" ( :-), probably to fix his undistracted attention on Himself,
	and, by means of certain actions He was about to do, to awaken and
	direct his attention to the proper source of relief. 
	and put his fingers into his
	ears—As his indistinct articulation arose from his deafness,
	our Lord addresses Himself to this first. To the impotent man He
	said, "Wilt thou be made whole?" to the blind men, "What
	will ye that I shall do unto you?" and "Believe ye that I
	am able to do this?" (John 5:6;
	Matthew 20:32; Matthew 9:28).
	But as this patient could hear nothing, our Lord substitutes
	symbolical actions upon each of the organs affected. 
	and he spit and touched his
	tongue—moistening the man's parched tongue with saliva from His
	own mouth, as if to lubricate the organ or facilitate its free
	motion; thus indicating the source of the healing virtue to be His
	own person. (For similar actions, see Mark 8:23;
	John 9:6).
