11. seeking of him a sign from
	heaven, tempting him—not in the least desiring evidence for
	their conviction, but hoping to entrap Him. The first part of the
	answer is given in Matthew alone (Matthew 16:2;
	Matthew 16:3): "He answered and
	said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather;
	for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather
	to-day: for the sky is red and lowering [sullen, gloomy]. Hypocrites!
	ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs
	of the times?" The same simplicity of purpose and careful
	observation of the symptoms of approaching events which they showed
	in common things would enable them to "discern the signs of the
	times"—or rather "seasons," to which the prophets
	pointed for the manifestation of the Messiah. The scepter had
	departed from Judah; Daniel's seventy weeks were expiring, c. and
	many other significant indications of the close of the old economy,
	and preparations for a freer and more comprehensive one, might have
	been discerned. But all was lost upon them.
