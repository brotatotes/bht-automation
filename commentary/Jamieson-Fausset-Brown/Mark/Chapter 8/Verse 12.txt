12. And he sighed deeply in his
	spirit—The language is very strong. These glimpses into the
	interior of the Redeemer's heart, in which our Evangelist abounds,
	are more precious than rubies. The state of the Pharisaic heart,
	which prompted this desire for a fresh sign, went to His very soul. 
	and saith, Why doth this
	generation—"this wicked and adulterous generation"
	(Matthew 16:4). 
	seek after a sign?—when
	they have had such abundant evidence already. 
	There shall no sign be given
	unto this generation—literally, "If there shall be given
	to this generation a sign"; a Jewish way of expressing a solemn
	and peremptory determination to the contrary (compare Hebrews 4:5;
	Psalms 95:11, Margin). "A
	generation incapable of appreciating such demonstrations shall not be
	gratified with them." In Psalms 95:11- : He added, "but the sign of the prophet Jonas."
