<p><b>14. Now the disciples had forgotten
	to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one
	loaf</b>â€”This is another example of that graphic circumstantiality
	which gives such a charm to this briefest of the four Gospels. The
	circumstance of the "one loaf" only remaining, as WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON remark, was
	more suggestive of their Master's recent miracles than the entire
	absence of provisions.</p>
