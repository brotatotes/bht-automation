16. And they reasoned among
	themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread—But a little
	while ago He was tried with the obduracy of the Pharisees; now He is
	tried with the obtuseness of His own disciples. The nine
	questions following each other in rapid succession ( :-) show how deeply He was hurt at this want of spiritual
	apprehension, and worse still, their low thoughts of Him, as if He
	would utter so solemn a warning on so petty a subject. It will be
	seen, however, from the very form of their conjecture, "It is
	because we have no bread," and our Lord's astonishment
	that they should not by that time have known better with what He took
	up His attention—that He ever left the whole care for His own
	temporal wants to the Twelve: that He did this so entirely, that
	finding they were reduced to their last loaf they felt as if unworthy
	of such a trust, and could not think but that the same thought was in
	their Lord's mind which was pressing upon their own; but that in this
	they were so far wrong that it hurt His feelings—sharp just in
	proportion to His love—that such a thought of Him should have
	entered their minds! Who that, like angels, "desire to look into
	these things" will not prize such glimpses above gold?
