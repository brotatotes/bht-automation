<p><b>16. And they reasoned among
	themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread</b>—But a little
	while ago He was tried with the obduracy of the Pharisees; now He is
	tried with the obtuseness of His own disciples. The <i>nine</i>
	questions following each other in rapid succession (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) show how deeply He was hurt at this want of spiritual
	apprehension, and worse still, their low thoughts of Him, as if He
	would utter so solemn a warning on so petty a subject. It will be
	seen, however, from the very form of their conjecture, "It is
	because <i>we</i> have no bread," and our Lord's astonishment
	that they should not by that time have known better with what He took
	up His attention—that He ever left <i>the whole care for His own
	temporal wants to the Twelve:</i> that He did this so entirely, that
	finding they were reduced to their last loaf they felt as if unworthy
	of such a trust, and could not think but that the same thought was in
	their Lord's mind which was pressing upon their own; but that in this
	they were so far wrong that it hurt His feelings—sharp just in
	proportion to His love—that such a thought of Him should have
	entered their minds! Who that, like angels, "desire to look into
	these things" will not prize such glimpses above gold?</p>
