<p><b>21. How is it that ye do not
	understand?</b>â€”"do not understand that the warning I gave you
	could not have been prompted by any such petty consideration as the
	want of loaves in your scrip." Profuse as were our Lord's
	miracles, we see from this that they were not wrought at random, but
	that He carefully noted their minutest details, and desired that this
	should be done by those who witnessed, as doubtless by all who read
	the record of them. Even the different kind of baskets used at the
	two miraculous feedings, so carefully noted in the two narratives,
	are here also referred to; the one smaller, of which there were
	twelve, the other much larger, of which there were seven.
