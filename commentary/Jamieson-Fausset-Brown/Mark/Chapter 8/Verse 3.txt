<p><b>3. And if I send them away fasting
	to their own houses, they will faint by the way</b>—In their
	eagerness they seem not to have thought of the need of provisions for
	such a length of time; but the Lord thought of it. In Matthew (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) it is, "I will not send them away fasting"—or
	rather, "To send them away fasting I am unwilling."</p>
