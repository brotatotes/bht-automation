4. From whence can a man satisfy
	these men with bread here in the wilderness?â€”Though the
	question here is the same as when He fed the five thousand, they
	evidently now meant no more by it than that they had
	not the means of feeding the multitude; modestly leaving the Lord to
	decide what was to be done. And this will the more appear from His
	not now trying them, as before, by saying, "They need not
	depart, give ye them to eat"; but simply asking what they had,
	and then giving His directions.
