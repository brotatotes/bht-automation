<p><b>9. And they that had eaten were
	about four thousand: and he sent them away</b>—Had not our Lord
	distinctly referred, in this very chapter and in two successive
	sentences, to the feeding of the five thousand and of the four
	thousand as two distinct miracles, many critics would have insisted
	that they were but two different representations of one and the same
	miracle, as they do of the two expulsions of the buyers and sellers
	from the temple, at the beginning and end of our Lord's ministry. But
	even in spite of what our Lord says, it is painful to find such men
	as NEANDER endeavoring to
	identify the two miracles. The localities, though both on the eastern
	side of the lake, were different; the time was different; the
	preceding and following circumstances were different; the period
	during which the people continued fasting was different—in the one
	case not even one entire day, in the other three days; the number fed
	was different—five thousand in the one case, in the other four
	thousand; the number of the loaves was different—five in the one
	case, in the other seven; the number of the fishes in the one case is
	definitely stated by all the four Evangelists—two; in the other
	case both give them indefinitely—"a few small fishes"; in
	the one case the multitude were commanded to sit down "upon the
	green grass"; in the other "on the ground"; in the one
	case the number of the baskets taken up filled with the fragments was
	twelve, in the other seven; but more than all, perhaps, because
	apparently quite incidental, in the one case the name given to the
	kind of baskets used is the same in all the four narratives—the
	<i>cophinus</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:43">Mark 6:43</span>);
	in the other case the name given to the kind of baskets used, while
	it is the same in both the narratives, is quite different—the
	<i>spuris,</i> a basket large enough to hold a man's body, for Paul
	was let down in one of these from the wall of Damascus (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:43- :">Mark 6:43- :</span>). It might be added, that in the one case the people, in a
	frenzy of enthusiasm, would have taken Him by force to make Him a
	king; in the other case no such excitement is recorded. In view of
	these things, who could have believed that these were one and the
	same miracle, even if the Lord Himself had not expressly
	distinguished them?
