	were come down from the hill" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The Transfiguration appears to have taken place at night.
	In the morning, as He came down from the hill on which it took
	place—with Peter, and James, and John—on approaching the other
	nine, He found them surrounded by a great multitude, and the scribes
	disputing or discussing with them. No doubt these cavillers were
	twitting the apostles of Jesus with their inability to cure the
	demoniac boy of whom we are presently to hear, and insinuating doubts
	even of their Master's ability to do it; while they, zealous for
	their Master's honor, would no doubt refer to His past miracles in
	proof of the contrary.</p>
