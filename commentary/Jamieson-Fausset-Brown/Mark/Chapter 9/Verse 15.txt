<p><b>15. And straightway all the
	people</b>—the multitude. 
	</p>
<p><b>when they beheld him, were
	greatly amazed</b>—were astounded. 
	</p>
<p><b>and running to him saluted
	him</b>—The singularly strong expression of surprise, the sudden
	arrest of the discussion, and the rush of the multitude towards Him,
	can be accounted for by nothing less than something amazing in His
	appearance. There can hardly be any doubt that <i>His countenance
	still retained traces of His transfiguration-glory.</i> (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:29">Exodus 34:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+34:30">Exodus 34:30</span>). So BENGEL,
	DE WETTE,
	MEYER, TRENCH,
	ALFORD. No wonder, if this
	was the case, that they not only ran to Him, but saluted Him. Our
	Lord, however, takes no notice of what had attracted them, and
	probably it gradually faded away as He drew near; but addressing
	Himself to the scribes, He demands the subject of their discussion,
	ready to meet them where they had pressed hard upon His
	half-instructed and as yet timid apostles.</p>
