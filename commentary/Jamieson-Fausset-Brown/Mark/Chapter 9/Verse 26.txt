26. And the spirit cried, and rent
	him sore, and came out of him; and he was as one dead; insomuch that
	many said, He is dead—The malignant, cruel spirit, now
	conscious that his time was come, gathers up his whole strength, with
	intent by a last stroke to kill his victim, and had nearly succeeded.
	But the Lord of life was there; the Healer of all maladies, the
	Friend of sinners, the Seed of the woman, "the Stronger than the
	strong man armed," was there. The very faith which Christ
	declared to be enough for everything being now found, it was not
	possible that the serpent should prevail. Fearfully is he permitted
	to bruise the heel, as in this case; but his own head
	shall go for it—his works shall be destroyed ( :-).
