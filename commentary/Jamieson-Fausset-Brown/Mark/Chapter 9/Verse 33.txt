	among yourselves by the way?</b>â€”From this we gather that after the
	painful communication He had made to them, the Redeemer had allowed
	them to travel so much of the way by themselves; partly, no doubt,
	that He might have privacy for Himself to dwell on what lay before
	Him, and partly that they might be induced to weigh together and
	prepare themselves for the terrible events which He had announced to
	them. But if so, how different was their occupation!</p>
