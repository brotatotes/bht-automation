<p><b>34. But they held their peace: for
	by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the
	greatest</b>â€”From <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:1">Matthew 18:1</span> we
	should infer that the subject was introduced, not by our Lord, but by
	the disciples themselves, who came and asked Jesus who should be
	greatest. Perhaps one or two of them first referred the matter to
	Jesus, who put them off till they should all be assembled together at
	Capernaum. He had all the while "perceived the thought of their
	heart" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:47">Luke 9:47</span>); but now
	that they were all together "in the house," He questions
	them about it, and they are put to the blush, conscious of the <i>temper</i>
	towards each other which it had kindled. This raised the whole
	question afresh, and at this point our Evangelist takes it up. The
	subject was suggested by the recent announcement of the Kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:47- :">Luke 9:47- :</span>), the transfiguration of their Master, and especially
	the preference given to three of them at that scene.</p>
