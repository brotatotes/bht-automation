	Matthew 18:4) for the first of this

	become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
	Heaven:" that is, "Conversion must be thorough; not only
	must the heart be turned to God in general, and from earthly to
	heavenly things, but in particular, except ye be converted from that
	carnal ambition which still rankles within you, into that freedom
	from all such feelings which ye see in this child, ye have neither
	part nor lot in the kingdom at all; and he who in this feature has
	most of the child, is highest there." Whosoever, therefore,
	shall "humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest
	in the kingdom of heaven": "for he that is [willing to be]
	least among you all, the same shall be great" (Matthew 18:4- :).
