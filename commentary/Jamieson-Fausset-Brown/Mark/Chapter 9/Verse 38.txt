<p><b>38. And John answered him, saying,
	Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth

	link of connection here with the foregoing context lies, we
	apprehend, in the emphatic words which our Lord had just uttered, "in
	My name." "Oh," interposes John—young, warm, but not
	sufficiently apprehending Christ's teaching in these matters—"that
	reminds me of something that we have just done, and we should like to
	know if we did right. We saw one casting out devils "in <i>Thy
	name,</i>" and we forbade him, because he followeth not us. Were
	we right, or were we wrong?" Answer—"Ye were wrong."
	"But we did it because he followeth not us." "No
	matter."</p>
