<p><b>40. For he that is not against us is
	on our part</b>—Two principles of immense importance are here laid
	down: "First, No one will readily speak evil of Me who has the
	faith to do a miracle in My name; and second, If such a person cannot
	be supposed to be <i>against</i> us, ye are to consider him <i>for</i>
	us." Let it be carefully observed that our Lord does not say
	this man should <i>not</i> have "followed them," nor yet
	that it was indifferent whether he did or not; but simply teaches how
	such a person was to be regarded, <i>although he did not</i>—namely,
	as a reverer of His name and a promoter of His cause.</p>
