	on our part—Two principles of immense importance are here laid
	down: "First, No one will readily speak evil of Me who has the
	faith to do a miracle in My name; and second, If such a person cannot
	be supposed to be against us, ye are to consider him for
	us." Let it be carefully observed that our Lord does not say
	this man should not have "followed them," nor yet
	that it was indifferent whether he did or not; but simply teaches how
	such a person was to be regarded, although he did not—namely,
	as a reverer of His name and a promoter of His cause.
