<p><b>41. For whosoever shall give you a
	cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily
	I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward</b>â€”(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><i>Continuation of Teaching
	Suggested by the Disciples' Strife</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p>What follows appears to have no
	connection with the incidental reproof of John immediately preceding.
	As that had interrupted some important teaching, our Lord hastens
	back from it, as if no such interruption had occurred.</p>
