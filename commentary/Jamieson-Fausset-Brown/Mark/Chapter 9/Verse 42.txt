<p><b>42. For whosoever shall offend one
	of these little ones that believe in me</b>—or, shall cause them to
	stumble; referring probably to the effect which such unsavory
	disputes as they had held would have upon the inquiring and hopeful
	who came in contact with them, leading to the belief that after all
	they were no better than others. 
	</p>
<p><b>it is better for him that a
	millstone were hanged about his neck</b>—The word here is simply
	"millstone," without expressing of which kind. But in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> it is the "ass-turned" kind, far heavier than the
	small hand-mill turned by female slaves, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. It is of course the same which is meant here. 
	</p>
<p><b>and he were cast into the
	sea</b>—meaning, that if by such a death that stumbling were
	prevented, and so its eternal consequences averted, it would be a
	happy thing for them. Here follows a striking verse in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Woe unto the world because of offences!" (There
	will be stumblings and falls and loss of souls enough from the
	world's treatment of disciples, without any addition from you:
	dreadful will be its doom in consequence; see that ye share not in
	it). "For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that
	man by whom the offence cometh!" (The struggle between light and
	darkness will inevitably cause stumblings, but not less guilty is he
	who wilfully makes any to stumble).</p>
