43. And if thy hand offend thee, cut
	it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having
	two hands to go into hellâ€”See Matthew 5:29;
	Matthew 5:30. The only difference
	between the words there and here is that there they refer to impure
	inclinations; here, to an ambitious disposition, an irascible or
	quarrelsome temper, and the like: and the injunction is to strike at
	the root of such dispositions and cut off the occasions of them.
