<p><b>11. And Josias begat Jechonias and
	his brethren</b>—Jeconiah was Josiah's grandson, being the son of
	Jehoiakim, Josiah's second son (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); but Jehoiakim might well be sunk in such a catalogue,
	being a mere puppet in the hands of the king of Egypt (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The "brethren" of Jechonias here evidently mean
	his uncles—the chief of whom, Mattaniah or Zedekiah, who came to
	the throne (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+24:17">2 Kings 24:17</span>), is, in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+36:10">2 Chronicles 36:10</span>, as well as here,
	called "his brother." 
	</p>
<p><b>about the time they were
	carried away to Babylon</b>—literally, "of their migration,"
	for the Jews avoided the word "captivity" as too bitter a
	recollection, and our Evangelist studiously respects the national
	feeling.</p>
