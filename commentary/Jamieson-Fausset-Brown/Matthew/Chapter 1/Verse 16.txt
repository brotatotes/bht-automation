<p><b>16. And Jacob begat Joseph, the
	husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus</b>—From this it is clear
	that the genealogy here given is not that of Mary, but of Joseph; nor
	has this ever been questioned. And yet it is here studiously
	proclaimed that Joseph was not the natural, but only the legal father
	of our Lord. His birth of a virgin was known only to a few; but the
	acknowledged descent of his legal father from David secured that the
	descent of Jesus Himself from David should never be questioned. See
