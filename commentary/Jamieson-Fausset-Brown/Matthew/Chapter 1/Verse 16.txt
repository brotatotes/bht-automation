	husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus—From this it is clear
	that the genealogy here given is not that of Mary, but of Joseph; nor

	proclaimed that Joseph was not the natural, but only the legal father

	needful spiritual gifts to consecrate them to their respective
	offices; and it was applied, in its most sublime and comprehensive
	sense, to the promised Deliverer, inasmuch as He was to be
	consecrated to an office embracing all three by the immeasurable
	anointing of the Holy Ghost (Leviticus 4:16- :; compare John 3:34).
