17. So all the generations from
	Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the
	carrying away—or migration. 
	into Babylon are fourteen
	generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon—the
	migration of Babylon. 
	unto Christ are fourteen
	generations—that is, the whole may be conveniently divided into
	three fourteens, each embracing one marked era, and each ending with
	a notable event, in the Israelitish annals. Such artificial aids to
	memory were familiar to the Jews, and much larger gaps than those
	here are found in some of the Old Testament genealogies. In  :- no fewer than six generations of the priesthood are
	omitted, as will appear by comparing it with  :-. It will be observed that the last of the three divisions
	of fourteen appears to contain only thirteen distinct names,
	including Jesus as the last. LANGE
	thinks that this was meant as a tacit hint that Mary was to be
	supplied, as the thirteenth link of the last chain, as it is
	impossible to conceive that the Evangelist could have made any
	mistake in the matter. But there is a simpler way of accounting for
	it. As the Evangelist himself ( :-) reckons David twice—as the last of the first fourteen and
	the first of the second—so, if we reckon the second fourteen to end
	with Josiah, who was coeval with the "carrying away into
	captivity" (Matthew 1:11), and
	third to begin with Jeconiah, it will be found that the last
	division, as well as the other two, embraces fourteen names,
	including that of our Lord.
