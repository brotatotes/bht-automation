<p><b>18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ
	was on this wise</b>—or, "thus."

<p><b>When as his mother Mary was
	espoused</b>—rather, "betrothed." 
	</p>
<p><b>to Joseph, before they came
	together, she was found</b>—discovered to be. 
	</p>
<p><b>with child of the Holy
	Ghost</b>—It was, of course, the fact only that was discovered; the
	explanation of the fact here given is the Evangelist's own. That the
	Holy Ghost is a living conscious Person is plainly implied here, and
	is elsewhere clearly taught (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:3">Acts 5:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+5:4">Acts 5:4</span>, c.): and that, in the
	unity of the Godhead, He is distinct both from the Father and the
	Son, is taught with equal distinctness (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:19">Matthew 28:19</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+13:14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span>). On the miraculous
