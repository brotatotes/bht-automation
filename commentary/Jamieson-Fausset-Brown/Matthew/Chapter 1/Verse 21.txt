	son—Observe, it is not said, "she shall bear thee a
	son," as was said to Zacharias of his wife Elizabeth ( :-). 
	and thou—as his legal
	father. 
	shalt call his name
	JESUS—from the Hebrew meaning "Jehovah the
	Saviour"; in Greek JESUS—to
	the awakened and anxious sinner sweetest and most fragrant of all
	names, expressing so melodiously and briefly His whole saving office
	and work!

	"He" is here emphatic—He it is that shall save; He

	sheep of the house of Israel, in the first instance; for they were
	the only people He then had. But, on the breaking down of the middle
	wall of partition, the saved people embraced the "redeemed unto
	God by His blood out of every kindred and people and tongue and
	nation." 
	from their sins—in the
	most comprehensive sense of salvation from sin (Revelation 1:5;
	Ephesians 5:25-27).
