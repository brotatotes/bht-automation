<p><b>21. And she shall bring forth a
	son</b>—Observe, it is not said, "she shall bear <i>thee</i> a
	son," as was said to Zacharias of his wife Elizabeth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and thou</b>—as his legal
	father. 
	</p>
<p><b>shalt call his name
	JESUS</b>—from the <i>Hebrew</i> meaning "Jehovah the
	Saviour"; in <i>Greek</i> JESUS—to
	the awakened and anxious sinner sweetest and most fragrant of all
	names, expressing so melodiously and briefly His whole saving office
	and work! 
	</p>
<p><b>for he shall save</b>—The
	"He" is here emphatic—He it is that shall save; He
	personally, and by personal acts (as WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON express it).
	</p>
<p><b>his people</b>—the lost
	sheep of the house of Israel, in the first instance; for they were
	the only people He then had. But, on the breaking down of the middle
	wall of partition, the saved people embraced the "redeemed unto
	God by His blood out of every kindred and people and tongue and
	nation." 
	</p>
<p><b>from their sins</b>—in the
	most comprehensive sense of salvation from sin (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:5">Revelation 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+5:25-27">Ephesians 5:25-27</span>).</p>
