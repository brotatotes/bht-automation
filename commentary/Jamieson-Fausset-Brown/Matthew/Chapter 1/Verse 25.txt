<p><b>25. And knew her not till she had
	brought forth her first-born son: and he called his name JESUS</b>â€”The
	word "till" does not necessarily imply that they lived on a
	different footing afterwards (as will be evident from the use of the
	same word in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+15:35">1 Samuel 15:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+6:23">2 Samuel 6:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:20">Matthew 12:20</span>); nor does the word
	"first-born" decide the much-disputed question, whether
	Mary had any children to Joseph after the birth of Christ; for, as
	LIGHTFOOT says, "The
	law, in speaking of the first-born, regarded not whether any were
	born <i>after</i> or no, but only that none were born before."
	(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>).</p>
