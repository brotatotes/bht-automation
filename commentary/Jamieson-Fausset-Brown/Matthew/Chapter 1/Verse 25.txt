25. And knew her not till she had
	brought forth her first-born son: and he called his name JESUSâ€”The
	word "till" does not necessarily imply that they lived on a
	different footing afterwards (as will be evident from the use of the
	same word in 1 Samuel 15:35; 2 Samuel 6:23;
	Matthew 12:20); nor does the word
	"first-born" decide the much-disputed question, whether
	Mary had any children to Joseph after the birth of Christ; for, as
	LIGHTFOOT says, "The
	law, in speaking of the first-born, regarded not whether any were
	born after or no, but only that none were born before."
