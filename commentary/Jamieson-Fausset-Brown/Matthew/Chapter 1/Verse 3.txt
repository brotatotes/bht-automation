	introduced; two of them Gentiles by birth—<i>Rachab</i> and <i>Ruth;</i>
	and three of them with a blot at their names in the Old
	Testament—<i>Thamar, Rachab,</i> and <i>Bath-sheba.</i> This
	feature in the present genealogy—herein differing from that given
	by Luke—comes well from him who styles himself in his list of the
	Twelve, what none of the other lists do, "Matthew <i>the
	publican</i>"; as if thereby to hold forth, at the very outset,
	the unsearchable riches of that grace which could not only fetch in
	"them that are afar off," but teach down even to "publicans
	and harlots," and raise them to "sit with the princes of
	his people." David is here twice emphatically styled "David
	the king," as not only the first of that royal line from which
	Messiah was to descend, but the one king of all that line from which
	the throne that Messiah was to occupy took its name—"the
	throne of David." The angel Gabriel, in announcing Him to His
	virgin-mother, calls it "the throne of David His father,"
	sinking all the intermediate kings of that line, as having no
	importance save as links to connect the first and the last king of
	Israel as father and son. It will be observed that Rachab is here
	represented as the great-grandmother of David (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ru+4:20-22">Ruth 4:20-22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+2:11-15">1 Chronicles 2:11-15</span>) —a thing not
	beyond possibility indeed, but extremely improbable, there being
	about four centuries between them. There can hardly be a doubt that
	one or two intermediate links are omitted.</p>
