<p><b>7-8. And Solomon begat Roboam; and
	Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 8. And Asa begat Josaphat; and
	Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias</b>—or Uzziah. Three
	kings are here omitted—<i>Ahaziah, Joash,</i> and <i>Amaziah</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:11">1 Chronicles 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+3:12">1 Chronicles 3:12</span>).
	Some omissions behooved to be made, to compress the whole into three
	fourteens (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:17">Matthew 1:17</span>). The reason
	why these, rather than other names, are omitted, must be sought in
	<i>religious</i> considerations—either in the connection of those
	kings with the house of Ahab (as LIGHTFOOT,
	EBRARD, and ALFORD
	view it); in their slender right to be regarded as true links in the
	theocratic chain (as LANGE
	takes it); or in some similar disqualification.</p>
