	bag used by travellers for holding provisions. 
	neither two coats—or
	tunics, worn next the skin. The meaning is, Take no change of dress,
	no additional articles.

	reading, however, evidently is "a staff"—meaning, that
	they were not to procure even that much expressly for this missionary

	misunderstanding of this that gave rise to the reading "staves"

	his meat—his "food" or "maintenance"; a
	principle which, being universally recognized in secular affairs, is

	and by Paul repeatedly and touchingly employed in his appeals to the
	churches (Romans 15:27; 1 Corinthians 9:11;
	Galatians 6:6), and once as "scripture"
	(1 Timothy 5:18).
