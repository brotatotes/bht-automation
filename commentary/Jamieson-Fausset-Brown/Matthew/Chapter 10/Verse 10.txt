<p><b>10. Nor scrip for your journey</b>—the
	bag used by travellers for holding provisions. 
	</p>
<p><b>neither two coats</b>—or
	tunics, worn next the skin. The meaning is, Take no change of dress,
	no additional articles. 
	</p>
<p><b>neither shoes</b>—that is,
	change of them. 
	</p>
<p><b>nor yet staves</b>—The
	received text here has "a staff," but our version follows
	another reading, "staves," which is found in the received
	text of Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:3">Luke 9:3</span>). The true
	reading, however, evidently is "a staff"—meaning, that
	they were not to procure even that much expressly for this missionary
	journey, but to go with what they had. No doubt it was the
	misunderstanding of this that gave rise to the reading "staves"
	in so many manuscripts Even if this reading were genuine, it could
	not mean "more than one"; for who, as ALFORD
	well asks, would think of taking a spare staff? 
	</p>
<p><b>for the workman is worthy of
	his meat</b>—his "food" or "maintenance"; a
	principle which, being universally recognized in secular affairs, is
	here authoritatively applied to the services of the Lord's workmen,
	and by Paul repeatedly and touchingly employed in his appeals to the
	churches (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:27">Romans 15:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:11">1 Corinthians 9:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:6">Galatians 6:6</span>), and once as "scripture"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:18">1 Timothy 5:18</span>).</p>
