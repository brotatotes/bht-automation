<p><b>13. And if the house be
	worthy</b>—showing this by giving you a welcome. 
	</p>
<p><b>let your peace come upon
	it</b>—This is best explained by the injunction to the Seventy,
	"And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this
	house" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:5">Luke 10:5</span>). This was
	the ancient salutation of the East, and it prevails to this day. But
	from the lips of Christ and His messengers, it means something far
	higher, both in the gift and the giving of it, than in the current
	salutation. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:5- :">Luke 10:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>but if it be not worthy, let
	your peace return to you</b>—If your peace finds a shut, instead of
	an open, door in the heart of any household, take it back to
	yourselves, who know how to value it; and it will taste the sweeter
	to you for having been offered, even though rejected.</p>
