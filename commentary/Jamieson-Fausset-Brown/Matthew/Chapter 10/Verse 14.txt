<p><b>14. And whosoever shall not receive
	you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or
	city</b>—for possibly a whole town might not furnish one "worthy."

<p><b>shake off the dust of your
	feet</b>—"for a testimony against them," as Mark and Luke
	add (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:11">Mark 6:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:11">Luke 10:11</span>).
	By this symbolical action they vividly shook themselves from all
	<i>connection</i> with such, and all <i>responsibility</i> for the
	guilt of rejecting them and their message. Such symbolical actions
	were common in ancient times, even among others than the Jews, as
	strikingly appears in Pilate (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:11- :">Luke 10:11- :</span>). And even to this day it prevails in the East.</p>
