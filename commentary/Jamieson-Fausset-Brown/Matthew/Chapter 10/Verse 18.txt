18. And ye shall be brought before
	governors—provincial rulers. 
	and kings—the highest
	tribunals.

	against them—rather, "to them," in order to bear
	testimony to the truth and its glorious effects. 
	and the Gentiles—"to
	the Gentiles"; a hint that their message would not long be
	confined to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The Acts of the
	Apostles are the best commentary on these warnings.
