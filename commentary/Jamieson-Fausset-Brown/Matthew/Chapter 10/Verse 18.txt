<p><b>18. And ye shall be brought before
	governors</b>—provincial rulers. 
	</p>
<p><b>and kings</b>—the highest
	tribunals. 
	</p>
<p><b>for my sake, for a testimony
	against them</b>—rather, "to them," in order to bear
	testimony to the truth and its glorious effects. 
	</p>
<p><b>and the Gentiles</b>—"to
	the Gentiles"; a hint that their message would not long be
	confined to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The Acts of the
	Apostles are the best commentary on these warnings.</p>
