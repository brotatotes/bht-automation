<p><b>2. Now the names of the twelve
	apostles are these</b>—The other Evangelists enumerate the twelve
	in immediate connection with their appointment (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:13-19">Mark 3:13-19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13-16">Luke 6:13-16</span>). But our
	Evangelist, not intending to record the appointment, but only the
	Mission of the Twelve, gives their names here. And as in the Acts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13-42.6.16- :">Luke 6:13-42.6.16- :</span>) we have a list of the Eleven who met daily in the upper
	room with the other disciples after their Master's ascension until
	the day of Pentecost, we have four catalogues in all for comparison.

<p><b>The first, Simon, who is
	called Peter</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:13-42.6.16- :">Luke 6:13-42.6.16- :</span>).

<p><b>and Andrew his brother; James
	</b><i><b>the son</b></i><b> of Zebedee, and John his brother</b>—named
	after James, as the younger of the two.</p>
