	the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children
	shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to
	death</b>—for example, by lodging information against them with the
	authorities. The deep and virulent hostility of the old nature and
	life to the new—as of Belial to Christ—was to issue in awful
	wrenches of the dearest ties; and the disciples, in the prospect of
	their cause and themselves being launched upon society, are here
	prepared for the worst.</p>
