<p><b>25. It is enough for the disciple
	that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have
	called the master of the house Beelzebub</b>—All the <i>Greek</i>
	manuscripts, write "Beelzebul," which undoubtedly is the
	right form of this word. The other reading came in no doubt from the
	Old Testament "Baalzebub," the god of Ekron (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), which it was designed to express. As all idolatry was
	regarded as devil worship (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+17:7">Leviticus 17:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:17">Deuteronomy 32:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+106:37">Psalms 106:37</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+10:20">1 Corinthians 10:20</span>), so there seems to
	have been something peculiarly satanic about the worship of this
	hateful god, which caused his name to be a synonym of Satan. Though
	we nowhere read that our Lord was actually called "Beelzebul,"
	He was charged with being in league with Satan under that hateful
	name (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:24">Matthew 12:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:26">Matthew 12:26</span>),
	and more than once Himself was charged with "having a devil"
	or "demon" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:30">Mark 3:30</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:20">John 7:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+8:48">John 8:48</span>).
	Here it is used to denote the most opprobrious language which could
	be applied by one to another.

<p><b>how much more shall they call
	them of his household</b>—"the inmates." Three relations
	in which Christ stands to His people are here mentioned: He is their
	Teacher—they His disciples; He is their Lord—they His servants;
	He is the Master of the household—they its inmates. In all these
	relations, He says here, He and they are so bound up together that
	they cannot look to fare better than He, and should think it enough
	if they fare no worse.</p>
