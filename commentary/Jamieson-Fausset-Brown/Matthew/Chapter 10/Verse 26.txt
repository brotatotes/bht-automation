<p><b>26. Fear them not therefore: for
	there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that
	shall not be known</b>—that is, There is no use, and no need, of
	concealing anything; right and wrong, truth and error, are about to
	come into open and deadly collision; and the day is coming when all
	hidden things shall be disclosed, everything seen as it is, and every
	one have his due (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span>).</p>
