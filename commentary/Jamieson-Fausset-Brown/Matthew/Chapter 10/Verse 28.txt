28. And fear not them which kill the
	body, but are not able to kill the soul—In  :-, "and after that have no more that they can do." 
	but rather fear him—In
	Luke (Luke 12:5) this is
	peculiarly solemn, "I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear,"
	even Him 
	which is able to destroy both
	soul and body in hell—A decisive proof this that there is a
	hell for the body as well as the soul in the eternal world; in other
	words, that the torment that awaits the lost will have elements of
	suffering adapted to the material as well as the spiritual
	part of our nature, both of which, we are assured, will exist for
	ever. In the corresponding warning contained in Luke (Luke 12:5- :), Jesus calls His disciples "My friends," as if He
	had felt that such sufferings constituted a bond of peculiar
	tenderness between Him and them.
