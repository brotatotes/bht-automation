<p><b>28. And fear not them which kill the
	body, but are not able to kill the soul</b>—In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "and after that have no more that they can do." 
	</p>
<p><b>but rather fear him</b>—In
	Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:5">Luke 12:5</span>) this is
	peculiarly solemn, "I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear,"
	even Him 
	</p>
<p><b>which is able to destroy both
	soul and body in hell</b>—A decisive proof this that there is a
	hell for the body as well as the soul in the eternal world; in other
	words, that the torment that awaits the lost will have elements of
	suffering adapted to the <i>material</i> as well as the spiritual
	part of our nature, both of which, we are assured, will exist for
	ever. In the corresponding warning contained in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:5- :">Luke 12:5- :</span>), Jesus calls His disciples "My friends," as if He
	had felt that such sufferings constituted a bond of peculiar
	tenderness between Him and them.</p>
