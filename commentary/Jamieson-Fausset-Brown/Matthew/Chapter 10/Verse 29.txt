<p><b>29. Are not two sparrows sold for a
	farthing?</b>—In Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:6">Luke 12:6</span>)
	it is "five sparrows for two farthings"; so that, if the
	purchaser took two farthings' worth, he got one in addition—of such
	small value were they. 
	</p>
<p><b>and one of them shall not
	fall on the ground</b>—exhausted or killed 
	</p>
<p><b>without your Father</b>—"Not
	one of them is forgotten before God," as it is in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:6- :">Luke 12:6- :</span>).</p>
