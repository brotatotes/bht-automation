3. Philip and Bartholomew—That
	this person is the same with "Nathanael of Cana in Galilee"
	is justly concluded for the three following reasons: First, because
	Bartholomew is not so properly an individual's name as a family
	surname; next, because not only in this list, but in Mark's and
	Luke's (Mark 3:18; Luke 6:14),
	he follows the name of "Philip," who was the instrument of
	bringing Nathanael first to Jesus (Luke 6:14- :); and again, when our Lord, after His resurrection, appeared
	at the Sea of Tiberias, "Nathanael of Cana in Galilee" is
	mentioned along with six others, all of them apostles, as being
	present (John 21:2). 
	Matthew the publican—In
	none of the four lists of the Twelve is this apostle so branded but
	in his own, as if he would have all to know how deep a debtor he had
	been to his Lord. (See on John 21:2- :; Matthew 9:9). 
	James the son of Alphaeus—the
	same person apparently who is called Cleopas or Clopas
	(Luke 24:18; John 19:25);
	and, as he was the husband of Mary, sister to the Virgin, James the
	Less must have been our Lord's cousin. 
	and Lebbaeus, whose surname
	was Thaddaeus—the same, without doubt, as "Judas the
	brother of James," mentioned in both the lists of Luke (Luke 6:16;
	Acts 1:13), while no one of the
	name of Lebbaeus or Thaddaeus is so. It is he who in John (Acts 1:13- :) is sweetly called "Judas, not Iscariot." That he
	was the author of the Catholic Epistle of "Jude," and not
	"the Lord's brother" (Acts 1:13- :), unless these be the same, is most likely.
