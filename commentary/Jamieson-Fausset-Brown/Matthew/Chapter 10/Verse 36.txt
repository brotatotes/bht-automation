<p><b>36. And a man's foes shall be they
	of his own household</b>â€”This saying, which is quoted, as is the
	whole verse, from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+7:6">Micah 7:6</span>, is
	but an extension of the Psalmist's complaint (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+41:9">Psalms 41:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+55:12-14">Psalms 55:12-14</span>), which had
	its most affecting illustration in the treason of Judas against our
	Lord Himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+13:18">John 13:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:48-50">Matthew 26:48-50</span>).
	Hence would arise the necessity of a choice between Christ and the
	nearest relations, which would put them to the severest test.</p>
