36. And a man's foes shall be they
	of his own householdâ€”This saying, which is quoted, as is the
	whole verse, from Micah 7:6, is
	but an extension of the Psalmist's complaint (Psalms 41:9;
	Psalms 55:12-14), which had
	its most affecting illustration in the treason of Judas against our
	Lord Himself (John 13:18; Matthew 26:48-50).
	Hence would arise the necessity of a choice between Christ and the
	nearest relations, which would put them to the severest test.
