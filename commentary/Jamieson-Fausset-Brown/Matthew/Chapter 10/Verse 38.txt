38. And he that taketh not his
	cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me—a saying
	which our Lord once and again emphatically reiterates (Matthew 16:24;
	Luke 9:23; Luke 14:27).
	We have become so accustomed to this expression—"taking up
	one's cross"—in the sense of "being prepared for trials
	in general for Christ's sake," that we are apt to lose sight of
	its primary and proper sense here—"a preparedness to go forth
	even to crucifixion," as when our Lord had to bear His own cross
	on His way to Calvary—a saying the more remarkable as our Lord had
	not as yet given a hint that He would die this death, nor was
	crucifixion a Jewish mode of capital punishment.
