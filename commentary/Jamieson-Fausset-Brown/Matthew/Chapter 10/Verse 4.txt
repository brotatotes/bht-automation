<p><b>4. Simon the Canaanite</b>—rather
	"Kananite," but better still, "the Zealot," as he
	is called in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:15">Luke 6:15</span>, where the
	original term should not have been retained as in our version
	("Simon, called Zelotes"), but rendered "Simon, called
	the Zealot." The word "Kananite" is just the <i>Aramaic,</i>
	or <i>Syro-Chaldaic,</i> term for "Zealot." Probably before
	his acquaintance with Jesus, he belonged to the sect of the Zealots,
	who bound themselves, as a sort of voluntary ecclesiastical police,
	to see that the law was not broken with impunity. 
	</p>
<p><b>and Judas Iscariot</b>—that
	is, Judas of Kerioth, a town of Judah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:15- :">Luke 6:15- :</span>); so called to distinguish him from "Judas the brother
	of James" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16">Luke 6:16</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>who also betrayed him</b>—a
	note of infamy attached to his name in all the catalogues of the
	Twelve.

	RECEIVE THEIR
	INSTRUCTIONS. 
	</p>
<p>This directory divides itself into
	three distinct parts. The <i>first</i> part (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16- :">Luke 6:16- :</span>) contains directions for the brief and temporary mission
	on which they were now going forth, with respect to the places they
	were to go to, the works they were to do, the message they were to
	bear, and the manner in which they were to conduct themselves. The
	<i>second</i> part (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16- :">Luke 6:16- :</span>) contains directions of no such limited and temporary
	nature, but opens out into the permanent exercise of the Gospel
	ministry. The <i>third</i> part (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:16- :">Luke 6:16- :</span>) is of wider application still, reaching not only to the
	ministry of the Gospel in every age, but to the service of Christ in
	the widest sense. <i>It is a strong confirmation of this threefold
	division, that each part closes with the words,</i> "VERILY
	I SAY UNTO YOU"
