<p><b>40. He that receiveth
	you</b>—entertaineth you, 
	</p>
<p><b>receiveth me; and he that
	receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me</b>—As the treatment which
	an ambassador receives is understood and regarded as expressing the
	light in which he that sends him is viewed, so, says our Lord here,
	"Your authority is Mine, as Mine is My Father's."</p>
