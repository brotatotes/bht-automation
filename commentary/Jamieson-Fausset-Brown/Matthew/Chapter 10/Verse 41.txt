<p><b>41. He that receiveth a prophet</b>—one
	divinely commissioned to deliver a message from heaven. Predicting
	future events was no necessary part of a prophet's office, especially
	as the word is used in the New Testament. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the name of a prophet</b>—for
	his office's sake and love to his master. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>shall receive a prophet's
	reward</b>—What an encouragement to those who are <i>not</i>
	prophets! (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:5-8">John 3:5-8</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>and he that receiveth a
	righteous man in the name of a righteous man</b>—from sympathy with
	his character and esteem for himself as such 
	</p>
<p><b>shall receive a righteous
	man's reward</b>—for he must himself have the seed of righteousness
	who has any real sympathy with it and complacency in him who
	possesses it.</p>
