<p><b>42. And whosoever shall give to
	drink unto one of these little ones</b>—Beautiful epithet!
	Originally taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:7">Zechariah 13:7</span>.
	The reference is to their lowliness in spirit, their littleness in
	the eyes of an undiscerning world, while high in Heaven's esteem. 
	</p>
<p><b>a cup of cold water
	only</b>—meaning, the smallest service. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the name of a disciple</b>—or,
	as it is in Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:41">Mark 9:41</span>),
	because ye are Christ's: from love to Me, and to him from his
	connection with Me. 
	</p>
<p><b>verily I say unto you, he
	shall in no wise lose his reward</b>—There is here a descending
	climax—"a prophet," "a righteous man," "a
	little one"; signifying that however low we come down in our
	services to those that are Christ's, all that is done for His sake,
	and that bears the stamp of love to His blessed name, shall be
	divinely appreciated and owned and rewarded.</p>
