	of the house of Israel</b>â€”Until Christ's death, which broke down

	the visible people of God, were "lost sheep," not merely in
	the sense which all sinners are (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:6">Isaiah 53:6</span>;

	faithless shepherds (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+50:6">Jeremiah 50:6</span>;
