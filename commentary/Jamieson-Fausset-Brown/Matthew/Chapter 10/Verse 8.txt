<p><b>8. Heal the sick, cleanse the
	lepers, </b><i><b>raise the dead,</b></i><b> cast out devils</b>—(The
	italicized clause—"<i>raise the dead</i>"—is wanting in
	many manuscripts). Here we have the first communication of
	supernatural power by Christ Himself to His followers—thus
	anticipating the gifts of Pentecost. And right royally does He
	dispense it.

<p><b>freely ye have received,
	freely give</b>—Divine saying, divinely said! (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+15:10">Deuteronomy 15:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+15:11">Deuteronomy 15:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6">Acts 3:6</span>)
	—an apple of gold in a setting of silver (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+3:6- :">Acts 3:6- :</span>). It reminds us of that other golden saying of our Lord,
	rescued from oblivion by Paul, "It is more blessed to give than
	to receive" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+20:35">Acts 20:35</span>).
	Who can estimate what the world owes to such sayings, and with what
	beautiful foliage and rich fruit such seeds have covered, and will
	yet cover, this earth!</p>
