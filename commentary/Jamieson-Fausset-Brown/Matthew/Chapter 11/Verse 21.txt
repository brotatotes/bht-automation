<p><b>21. Woe unto thee, Chorazin!</b>—not
	elsewhere mentioned, but it must have lain near Capernaum. 
	</p>
<p><b>woe unto thee,
	Bethsaida</b>—"fishing-house," a fishing station—on the
	western side of the Sea of Galilee, and to the north of Capernaum;
	the birthplace of three of the apostles—the brothers Andrew and
	Peter, and Philip. These two cities appear to be singled out to
	denote the whole region in which they lay—a region favored with the
	Redeemer's presence, teaching, and works above every other. 
	</p>
<p><b>for if the mighty works</b>—the
	miracles 
	</p>
<p><b>which were done in you had
	been done in Tyre and Sidon</b>—ancient and celebrated commercial
	cities, on the northeastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea, lying
	north of Palestine, and the latter the northernmost. As their wealth
	and prosperity engendered luxury and its concomitant evils—irreligion
	and moral degeneracy—their overthrow was repeatedly foretold in
	ancient prophecy, and once and again fulfilled by victorious enemies.
	Yet they were rebuilt, and at this time were in a flourishing
	condition. 
	</p>
<p><b>they would have repented long
	ago in sackcloth and ashes</b>—remarkable language, showing that
	they had done less violence to conscience, and so, in God's sight,
	were less criminal than the region here spoken of.</p>
