<p><b>23. And thou, Capernaum</b>—(See
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:13">Matthew 4:13</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>which art exalted unto
	heaven</b>—Not even of Chorazin and Bethsaida is this said. For
	since at Capernaum Jesus had His stated abode during the whole period
	of His public life which He spent in Galilee, it was <i>the most
	favored spot upon earth,</i> the most exalted in privilege. 
	</p>
<p><b>shall be brought down to
	hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been
	done in Sodom</b>—destroyed for its pollutions. 
	</p>
<p><b>it would have remained until
	this day</b>—having done no such violence to conscience, and so
	incurred unspeakably less guilt.</p>
