<p><b>24. But I say unto you, That it
	shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment,
	than for thee</b>—"It has been indeed," says Dr. STANLEY,
	"more tolerable, in one sense, in the day of its earthly
	judgment, for the land of Sodom than for Capernaum; for the name, and
	perhaps even the remains of Sodom are still to be found on the shores
	of the Dead Sea; while that of Capernaum has, on the Lake of
	Gennesareth, been utterly lost." But the judgment of which our
	Lord here speaks is still future; a judgment not on material cities,
	but their responsible inhabitants—a judgment final and
	irretrievable.</p>
