<p><b>26. Even so, Father; for so it
	seemed good</b>—the emphatic and chosen term for expressing any
	object of divine complacency; whether Christ Himself (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), or God's gracious eternal arrangements (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in thy sight</b>—This is
	just a sublime echo of the foregoing words; as if Jesus, when He
	uttered them, had paused to reflect on it, and as if the glory of
	it—not so much in the light of its own reasonableness as of God's
	absolute will that so it should be—had filled His soul.</p>
