<p><b>28. Come unto me, all ye that labour
	and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest</b>—Incomparable,
	ravishing sounds these—if ever such were heard in this weary,
	groaning world! What gentleness, what sweetness is there in the very
	style of the invitation—"Hither to Me"; and in the words,
	"All ye that toil and are burdened," the universal
	wretchedness of man is depicted, on both its sides—the <i>active</i>
	and the <i>passive</i> forms of it.</p>
