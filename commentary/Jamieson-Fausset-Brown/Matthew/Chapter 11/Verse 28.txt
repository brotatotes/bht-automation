28. Come unto me, all ye that labour
	and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest—Incomparable,
	ravishing sounds these—if ever such were heard in this weary,
	groaning world! What gentleness, what sweetness is there in the very
	style of the invitation—"Hither to Me"; and in the words,
	"All ye that toil and are burdened," the universal
	wretchedness of man is depicted, on both its sides—the active
	and the passive forms of it.
