<p><b>29. Take my yoke upon you</b>—the
	yoke of subjection to Jesus. 
	</p>
<p><b>and learn of me; for I am
	meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls</b>—As
	Christ's willingness to empty Himself to the uttermost of His
	Father's requirements was the spring of ineffable repose to His own
	Spirit, so in the same track does He invite all to follow Him, with
	the assurance of the same experience.</p>
