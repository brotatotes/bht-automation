<p><b>12. How much then is a man better
	than a sheep?</b>—Resistless appeal! "A righteous man
	regardeth the life of his beast" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and would instinctively rescue it from death or suffering
	on the sabbath day; how much more his nobler fellow man! But the
	reasoning, as given in the other two Gospels, is singularly striking:
	"But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the
	withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose
	and stood forth. Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing:
	Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save
	life or to destroy it?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:8">Luke 6:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:9">Luke 6:9</span>), or as in Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:9- :">Luke 6:9- :</span>), "to kill?" He thus shuts them up to this
	startling alternative: "Not to do good, when it is in the power
	of our hand to do it, is to do evil; not to save life, when we can,
	is to kill"—and must the letter of the sabbath rest be kept at
	this expense? This unexpected thrust shut their mouths. By this great
	ethical principle our Lord, we see, held Himself bound, as man. But
	here we must turn to Mark, whose graphic details make the second
	Gospel so exceedingly precious. "When He had looked round about
	on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts,
	He saith unto the man" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:9- :">Luke 6:9- :</span>). This is one of the very few passages in the Gospel history
	which reveal our Lord's <i>feelings.</i> How holy this anger was
	appears from the "grief" which mingled with it at "the
	hardness of their hearts."</p>
