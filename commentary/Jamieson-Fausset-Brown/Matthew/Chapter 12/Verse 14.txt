<p><b>14. Then the Pharisees went out, and
	held a council against him, how they might destroy him</b>—This is
	the first explicit mention of their murderous designs against our
	Lord. Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:11">Luke 6:11</span>) says,
	"they were filled with madness, and communed one with another
	what they might do to Jesus." But their doubt was not, <i>whether</i>
	to get rid of Him, but <i>how</i> to compass it. Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:11- :">Luke 6:11- :</span>), as usual, is more definite: "The Pharisees went forth,
	and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they
	might destroy Him." These Herodians were supporters of Herod's
	dynasty, created by Cæsar—a political rather than religious party.
	The Pharisees regarded them as untrue to their religion and country.
	But here we see them combining together against Christ as a common
	enemy. So on a subsequent occasion (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:15">Matthew 22:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:16">Matthew 22:16</span>).
