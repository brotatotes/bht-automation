<p><b>2. But when the Pharisees saw it,
	they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful
	to do upon the sabbath day</b>â€”The act itself was expressly
	permitted (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+23:25">Deuteronomy 23:25</span>). But as
	being "servile work," which was prohibited on the sabbath
	day, it was regarded as sinful.</p>
