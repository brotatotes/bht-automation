<p><b>24. But when the Pharisees heard
	it</b>—Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:22">Mark 3:22</span>) says,
	"the scribes which came down from Jerusalem"; so that this
	had been a hostile party of the ecclesiastics, who had come all the
	way from Jerusalem to collect materials for a charge against Him.
	(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1">Matthew 12:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>they said, This fellow</b>—an
	expression of contempt. 
	</p>
<p><b>doth not cast out devils, but
	by Beelzebub</b>—rather, "Beelzebul" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:1- :">Matthew 12:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the prince of the devils</b>—Two
	things are here implied—first, that the bitterest enemies of our
	Lord were unable to deny the reality of His miracles; and next, that
	they believed in an <i>organized infernal kingdom of evil,</i> under
	one chief. This belief would be of small consequence, had not our
	Lord set His seal to it; but this He immediately does. Stung by the
	unsophisticated testimony of "all the people," they had no
	way of holding out against His claims but by the desperate shift of
	ascribing His miracles to Satan.</p>
