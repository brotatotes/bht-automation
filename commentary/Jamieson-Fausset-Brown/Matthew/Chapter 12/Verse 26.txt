<p><b>26. And if Satan cast out Satan, he
	is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?</b>—The
	argument here is irresistible. "No organized society can
	stand—whether kingdom, city, or household—when turned against
	itself; such intestine war is suicidal: But the works I do are
	destructive of Satan's kingdom: That I should be in league with
	Satan, therefore, is incredible and absurd."</p>
