<p><b>27. And if I by Beelzebub cast out
	devils, by whom do your children</b>â€”"your sons," meaning
	here the "disciples" or pupils of the Pharisees, who were
	so termed after the familiar language of the Old Testament in
	speaking of the sons of the prophets (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ki+20:35">1 Kings 20:35</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:3">2 Kings 2:3</span>, c.). Our Lord here seems
	to admit that such works were wrought by them in which case the
	Pharisees stood self-condemned, as expressed in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+2:3- :">2 Kings 2:3- :</span>), "Therefore shall they be your judges."</p>
