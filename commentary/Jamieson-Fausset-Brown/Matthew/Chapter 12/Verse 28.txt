<p><b>28. But if I cast out devils by the
	Spirit of God</b>—In Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) it is, "with (or 'by') the finger of God." This
	latter expression is just a figurative way of representing the <i>power</i>
	of God, while the former tells us the <i>living Personal Agent</i>
	was made use of by the Lord Jesus in every exercise of that power. 
	</p>
<p><b>then</b>—"no doubt"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:20">Luke 11:20</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the kingdom of God is come
	unto you</b>—rather "upon you," as the same expression is
	rendered in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:20">Luke 11:20</span>):
	—that is, "If this expulsion of Satan is, and can be, by no
	other than the Spirit of God, then is his Destroyer already in the
	midst of you, and that kingdom which is destined to supplant his is
	already rising on its ruins."</p>
