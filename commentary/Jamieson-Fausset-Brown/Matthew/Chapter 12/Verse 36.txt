	idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in
	the day of judgment—They might say, "It was nothing: we

	not be treated as nothing: Words, as the index of the heart, however
	idle they may seem, will be taken account of, whether good or bad, in
	estimating character in the day of judgment."
