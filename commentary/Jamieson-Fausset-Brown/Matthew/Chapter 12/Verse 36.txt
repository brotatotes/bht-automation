<p><b>36. But I say unto you, That every
	idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in
	the day of judgment</b>—They might say, "It was nothing: we
	meant no evil; we merely threw out a supposition, as one way of
	accounting for the miracle we witnessed; if it will not stand, let it
	go; why make so much of it, and bear down with such severity for it?"
	Jesus replies, "It was not nothing, and at the great day will
	not be treated as nothing: Words, as the index of the heart, however
	idle they may seem, will be taken account of, whether good or bad, in
	estimating character in the day of judgment."
