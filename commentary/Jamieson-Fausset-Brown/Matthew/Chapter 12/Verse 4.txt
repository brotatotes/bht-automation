<p><b>4. How he entered into the house of
	God, and did eat the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat,
	neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?</b>—No
	example could be more apposite than this. The man after God's own
	heart, of whom the Jews ever boasted, when suffering in God's cause
	and straitened for provisions, asked and obtained from the high
	priest what, according to the law, it was illegal for anyone save the
	priests to touch. Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:26">Mark 2:26</span>)
	says this occurred "in the days of Abiathar the high priest."
	But this means not during his high priesthood—for it was under that
	of his father Ahimelech—but simply, in his time. Ahimelech was soon
	succeeded by Abiathar, whose connection with David, and prominence
	during his reign, may account for his name, rather than his father's,
	being here introduced. Yet there is not a little confusion in what is
	said of these priests in different parts of the Old Testament. Thus
	he is called both the son of the father of Ahimelech (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+22:20">1 Samuel 22:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+8:17">2 Samuel 8:17</span>); and Ahimelech is
	called Ahiah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+14:3">1 Samuel 14:3</span>), and
	Abimelech (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+18:16">1 Chronicles 18:16</span>).</p>
