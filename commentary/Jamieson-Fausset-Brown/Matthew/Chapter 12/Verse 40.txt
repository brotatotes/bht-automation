40. For as Jonas was—"a
	sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this
	generation" (Luke 11:30).
	For as Jonas was 
	three days and three nights
	in the whale's belly— (Luke 11:30- :). 
	so shall the Son of man be
	three days and three nights in the heart of the earth—This was
	the second public announcement of His resurrection three days after
	His death. (For the first, see Luke 11:30- :). Jonah's case was analogous to this, as being a signal
	judgment of God; reversed in three days; and followed by a glorious
	mission to the Gentiles. The expression "in the heart of the
	earth," suggested by the expression of Jonah with respect to the
	sea (2:3, in the Septuagint), means simply the grave,
	but this considered as the most emphatic expression of real and total
	entombment. The period during which He was to lie in the grave is
	here expressed in round numbers, according to the Jewish way of
	speaking, which was to regard any part of a day, however small,
	included within a period of days, as a full day. (See 1 Samuel 30:12;
	1 Samuel 30:13; Esther 4:16;
	Esther 5:1; Matthew 27:63;
	Matthew 27:64, &c.).
