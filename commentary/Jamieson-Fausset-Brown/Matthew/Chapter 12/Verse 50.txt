50. For whosoever shall do the will
	of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister,
	and motherâ€”that is, "There stand here the members of a
	family transcending and surviving this of earth: Filial subjection to
	the will of My Father in heaven is the indissoluble bond of union
	between Me and all its members; and whosoever enters this hallowed
	circle becomes to Me brother, and sister, and mother!"
