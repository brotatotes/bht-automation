<p><b>7. But if ye had known what this
	meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:6">Hosea 6:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+6:6-8">Micah 6:6-8</span>, &amp;c.). See on

<p><b>ye would not have condemned
	the guiltless</b>—that is, Had ye understood the great principle of
	all religion, which the Scripture everywhere recognizes—that
	ceremonial observances must give way before moral duties, and
	particularly the necessities of nature—ye would have refrained from
	these captious complaints against men who in this matter are
	blameless. But our Lord added a specific application of this great
	principle to the law of the sabbath, preserved only in Mark: "And
	he said unto them, the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
	sabbath" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+2:27">Mark 2:27</span>). A
	glorious and far-reaching maxim, alike for the permanent
	establishment of the sabbath and the true freedom of its observance.</p>
