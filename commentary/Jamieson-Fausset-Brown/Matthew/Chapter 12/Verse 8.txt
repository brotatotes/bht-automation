<p><b>8. For the Son of man is Lord even
	of the sabbath day</b>—In what sense now is the Son of man Lord of
	the sabbath day? Not surely to abolish it—that surely were a
	strange lordship, especially just after saying that it was made or
	instituted for MAN—but
	to <i>own</i> it, to <i>interpret</i> it, to <i>preside over</i> it,
	and to <i>ennoble</i> it, by merging it in the "Lord's Day"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:10">Revelation 1:10</span>), breathing into it an
	air of liberty and love necessarily unknown before, and thus making
	it the nearest resemblance to the eternal sabbatism.
