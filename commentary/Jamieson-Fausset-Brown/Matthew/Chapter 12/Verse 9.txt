<p><b>9. And when he was departed
	thence</b>—but "on another sabbath" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>he went into their
	synagogue</b>—"and taught." He had now, no doubt, arrived
	in Galilee; but this, it would appear, did not occur at Capernaum,
	for after it was over, He "withdrew Himelf," it is said "<i>to
	the sea</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:7">Mark 3:7</span>),
	whereas Capernaum was at the sea. 
	</p>
<p><b>And, behold, there was a man
	which had his hand withered</b>—disabled by paralysis (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:7- :">Mark 3:7- :</span>). It was his right hand, as Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:7- :">Mark 3:7- :</span>) graphically notes. 
	</p>
<p><b>And they asked him, saying,
	Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse
	him</b>—Mark and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:2">Mark 3:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:7">Luke 6:7</span>) say they "watched
	Him whether He would heal on the sabbath day." They were now
	come to the length of dogging His steps, to collect materials for a
	charge of impiety against Him. It is probable that it was to their
	<i>thoughts</i> rather than their words that Jesus addressed Himself
	in what follows.</p>
