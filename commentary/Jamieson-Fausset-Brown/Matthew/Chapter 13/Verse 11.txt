<p><b>11. He answered and said unto them,
	Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
	heaven</b>—The word "mysteries" in Scripture is not used
	in its classical sense—of religious secrets, nor yet of things
	incomprehensible, or in their own nature difficult to be
	understood—but in the sense of things of purely divine revelation,
	and, usually, things darkly announced under the ancient economy, and
	during all that period darkly understood, but fully published under
	the Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:6-10">1 Corinthians 2:6-10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:3-6">Ephesians 3:3-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:8">Ephesians 3:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span>). "The mysteries of
	the kingdom of heaven," then, mean those glorious Gospel truths
	which at that time only the more advanced disciples could appreciate,
	and they but partially. 
	</p>
<p><b>but to them it is not
	given</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1">Matthew 13:1</span>).
	Parables serve the double purpose of <i>revealing</i> and <i>concealing;</i>
	presenting "the mysteries of the kingdom" to those who know
	and relish them, though in never so small a degree, in a new and
	attractive light; but to those who are insensible to spiritual things
	yielding only, as so many tales, some temporary entertainment.</p>
