<p><b>12. For whosoever hath</b>—that
	is, keeps; as a thing which he values. 
	</p>
<p><b>to him shall be given, and he
	shall have more abundance</b>—He will be rewarded by an increase of
	what he so much prizes. 
	</p>
<p><b>but whosoever hath not</b>—who
	lets this go or lie unused, as a thing on which he sets no value. 
	</p>
<p><b>from him shall be taken away
	even that he hath</b>—or as it is in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "what he seemeth to have," or, thinketh he hath.
	This is a principle of immense importance, and, like other weighty
	sayings, appears to have been uttered by our Lord on more than one
	occasion, and in different connections. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). As a great ethical principle, we see it in operation
	everywhere, under the general law of <i>habit;</i> in virtue of which
	moral principles become stronger by exercise, while by disuse, or the
	exercise of their contraries, they wax weaker, and at length expire.
	The same principle reigns in the intellectual world, and even in the
	animal—if not in the vegetable also—as the facts of physiology
	sufficiently prove. Here, however, it is viewed as a divine
	ordination, as a judicial retribution in continual operation under
	the divine administration.</p>
