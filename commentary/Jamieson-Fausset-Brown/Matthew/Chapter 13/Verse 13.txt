13. Therefore speak I to them in
	parables—which our Lord, be it observed, did not begin to do
	till His miracles were malignantly ascribed to Satan. 
	because they seeing, see
	not—They "saw," for the light shone on them as never
	light shone before; but they "saw not," for they closed
	their eyes. 
	and hearing, they hear not;
	neither do they understand—They "heard," for He
	taught them who "spake as never man spake"; but they "heard
	not," for they took nothing in, apprehending not the
	soul-penetrating, life-giving words addressed to them. In Mark and
	Luke (Mark 4:12; Luke 8:10),
	what is here expressed as a human fact is represented as the
	fulfilment of a divine purpose—"that seeing they may see, and
	not perceive," &c. The explanation of this lies in the
	statement of the foregoing verse—that, by a fixed law of the divine
	administration, the duty men voluntarily refuse to do, and in point
	of fact do not do, they at length become morally incapable of doing.
