<p><b>13. Therefore speak I to them in
	parables</b>—which our Lord, be it observed, did not begin to do
	till His miracles were malignantly ascribed to Satan.

<p><b>because they seeing, see
	not</b>—They "saw," for the light shone on them as never
	light shone before; but they "saw not," for they closed
	their eyes. 
	</p>
<p><b>and hearing, they hear not;
	neither do they understand</b>—They "heard," for He
	taught them who "spake as never man spake"; but they "heard
	not," for they took nothing in, apprehending not the
	soul-penetrating, life-giving words addressed to them. In Mark and
	Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:12">Mark 4:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+8:10">Luke 8:10</span>),
	what is here expressed as a human fact is represented as the
	fulfilment of a divine purpose—"that seeing they may see, and
	not perceive," &amp;c. The explanation of this lies in the
	statement of the foregoing verse—that, by a fixed law of the divine
	administration, the duty men voluntarily refuse to do, and in point
	of fact do not do, they at length become morally incapable of doing.</p>
