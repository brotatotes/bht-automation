2. And great multitudes were
	gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship—the
	article in the received text lacks authority 
	and sat; and the whole
	multitude stood on the shore—How graphic this picture!—no
	doubt from the pen of an eye-witness, himself impressed with the
	scene. It was "the same day" on which the foregoing solemn
	discourse was delivered, when His kindred thought Him "beside
	Himself" for His indifference to food and repose—that same day
	retiring to the seashore of Galilee; and there seating Himself,
	perhaps for coolness and rest, the crowds again flock around Him, and
	He is fain to push off from them, in the boat usually kept in
	readiness for Him; yet only to begin, without waiting to rest, a new
	course of teaching by parables to the eager multitudes that lined the
	shore. To the parables of our Lord there is nothing in all language
	to be compared, for simplicity, grace, fulness, and variety of
	spiritual teaching. They are adapted to all classes and stages of
	advancement, being understood by each according to the measure of his
	spiritual capacity.
