<p><b>28. He said unto them, An enemy hath
	done this</b>—Kind words these from a good Husbandman, honorably
	clearing His faithful servants of the wrong done to his field. 
	</p>
<p><b>The servants said unto him,
	Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</b>—Compare with this
	the question of James and John (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "Lord, wilt Thou that we command fire to come down
	from heaven and consume" those Samaritans? In this kind of zeal
	there is usually a large mixture of carnal heat. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
