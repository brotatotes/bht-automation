<p><b>3. And he spake many things unto
	them in parables, saying,</b> c.—These parables are SEVEN
	in number and it is not a little remarkable that while this is the
	<i>sacred number,</i> the first FOUR
	of them were spoken to the mixed multitude, while the remaining THREE
	were spoken to the Twelve in private—these divisions, <i>four</i>
	and <i>three,</i> being themselves notable in the symbolical
	arithmetic of Scripture. Another thing remarkable in the structure of
	these parables is, that while the first of the Seven—that of the
	Sower—is of the nature of an Introduction to the whole, the
	remaining Six consist of <i>three pairs</i>—the Second and Seventh,
	the Third and Fourth, and the Fifth and Sixth, corresponding to each
	other; each pair setting forth the same general truths, but with a
	certain diversity of aspect. All this can hardly be accidental.
