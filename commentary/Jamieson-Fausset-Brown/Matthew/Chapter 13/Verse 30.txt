<p><b>30, 39. Let both grow together</b>—that
	is, in the visible Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>until the harvest</b>—till
	the one have ripened for full salvation, the other for destruction.
	(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1">Matthew 13:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and in the time of harvest I
	will say to the reapers</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:1- :">Matthew 13:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Gather ye together first the
	tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them</b>—"in the fire"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:40">Matthew 13:40</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>but gather the wheat into my
	barn</b>—Christ, as the Judge, will separate the two classes (as in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:32">Matthew 25:32</span>). It will be observed
	that the tares are burned <i>before</i> the wheat is housed; in the
	exposition of the parable (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:41">Matthew 13:41</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:43">Matthew 13:43</span>) the same order is
	observed: and the same in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46">Matthew 25:46</span>
	—as if, in some literal sense, "with thine eyes shalt thou
	behold and see the reward of the wicked" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:46- :">Matthew 25:46- :</span>).

<p><i>Third and Fourth Parables</i>
	or <i>Second Pair:</i>
</p>
<p>THE
	MUSTARD SEED
	and THE LEAVEN
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:31-33">Matthew 13:31-33</span>). 
	</p>
<p>The subject of both these
	parables, as of the first pair, is the same, but under a slight
	diversity of aspect, namely— 
	</p>
<p>THE
	GROWTH OF THE KINGDOM FROM THE
	SMALLEST BEGINNINGS
	TO ULTIMATE
	UNIVERSALITY. 
	</p>
<p><i>The Mustard Seed</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:31">Matthew 13:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:32">Matthew 13:32</span>).</p>
