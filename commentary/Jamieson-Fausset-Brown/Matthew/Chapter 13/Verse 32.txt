	bruised, and is grateful to the taste of birds, which are accordingly
	attracted to its branches both for shelter and food, is it straining
	the parable, asks TRENCH,
	to suppose that, besides the wonderful <i>growth</i> of His kingdom,
	our Lord selected this seed to illustrate further the <i>shelter,
	repose</i> and <i>blessedness</i> it is destined to afford to the
	nations of the world?
