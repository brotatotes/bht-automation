<p><b>33. Another parable spake he unto
	them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took
	and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened</b>â€”This
	parable, while it teaches the same general truth as the foregoing
	one, holds forth, perhaps, rather the <i>inward</i> growth of the
	kingdom, while "the Mustard Seed" seems to point chiefly to
	the <i>outward.</i> It being a woman's work to knead, it seems a
	refinement to say that "the woman" here represents <i>the
	Church,</i> as the instrument of depositing the leaven. Nor does it
	yield much satisfaction to understand the "three measures of
	meal" of that threefold division of our nature into "spirit,
	soul, and body," alluded to in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, or of the threefold partition of the world among the three
	sons of Noah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+10:32">Genesis 10:32</span>), as
	some do. It yields more real satisfaction to see in this brief
	parable just the <i>all-penetrating</i> and <i>assimilating</i>
	quality of the Gospel, by virtue of which it will yet mould all
	institutions and tribes of men, and exhibit over the whole earth one
	"kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ."</p>
