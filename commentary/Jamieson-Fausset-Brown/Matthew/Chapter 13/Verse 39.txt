<p><b>39. The enemy that sowed them is the
	devil</b>—emphatically "<i>His</i> enemy" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:8">1 John 3:8</span>). By "tares" is
	meant, not what in our husbandry is so called, but some noxious
	plant, probably <i>darnel.</i> "The tares are the children of
	the wicked one"; and by their being sown "among the wheat"
	is meant their being deposited within the territory of the visible
	Church. As they resemble the children of the kingdom, so they are
	produced, it seems, by a similar process of "sowing"—the
	seeds of evil being scattered and lodging in the soil of those hearts
	upon which falls the seed of the world. The enemy, after sowing his
	"tares," "went his way"—his dark work soon
	done, but taking time to develop its true character.

<p><b>The harvest is the end of the
	world</b>—the period of Christ's second coming, and of the judicial
	separation of the righteous and the wicked. Till then, no attempt is
	to be made to effect such separation. But to stretch this so far as
	to justify allowing openly scandalous persons to remain in the
	communion of the Church, is to wrest the teaching of this parable to
	other than its proper design, and go in the teeth of apostolic
	injunctions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1-13">1 Corinthians 5:1-13</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>And the reapers are the
	angels</b>—But whose angels are they? "The Son of man shall
	send forth His angels" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:1-46.5.13- :">1 Corinthians 5:1-46.5.13- :</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:22">1 Peter 3:22</span>,
	"Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God;
	angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him."</p>
