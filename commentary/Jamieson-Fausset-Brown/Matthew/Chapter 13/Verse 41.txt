<p><b>41. The Son of man shall send forth
	his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom</b>—to which
	they never really belonged. They usurped their place and name and
	outward privileges; but "the ungodly shall not stand in the
	judgment, nor sinners [abide] in the congregation of the righteous"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+1:5">Psalms 1:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>all things that offend</b>—all
	those who have proved a stumbling-block to others 
	</p>
<p><b>and them which do
	iniquity</b>—The former class, as the worst, are mentioned first.</p>
