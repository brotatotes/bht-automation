41. The Son of man shall send forth
	his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom—to which
	they never really belonged. They usurped their place and name and
	outward privileges; but "the ungodly shall not stand in the
	judgment, nor sinners [abide] in the congregation of the righteous"
	(Psalms 1:5). 
	all things that offend—all
	those who have proved a stumbling-block to others 
	and them which do
	iniquity—The former class, as the worst, are mentioned first.
