<p><b>42. And shall cast them into a
	furnace of fire</b>—rather, "the furnace of fire": 
	</p>
<p><b>there shall be wailing and
	gnashing of teeth</b>—What terrific strength of language—the
	"casting" or "flinging" expressive of
	indignation, abhorrence, contempt (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+9:17">Psalms 9:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:2">Daniel 12:2</span>): "the furnace of
	fire" denoting the fierceness of the torment: the "wailing"
	signifying the anguish this causes; while the "gnashing of
	teeth" is a graphic way of expressing the despair in which its
	remedilessness issues (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:2- :">Daniel 12:2- :</span>)!</p>
