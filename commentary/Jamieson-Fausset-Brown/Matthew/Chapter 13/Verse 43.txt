<p><b>43. Then shall the righteous shine
	forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father</b>—as if they had
	been under a cloud during the present association with ungodly
	pretenders to their character, and claimants of their privileges, and
	obstructors of their course.

<p><i>Fifth and Sixth Parables</i> or
	<i>Third Pair:</i> THE
	HIDDEN TREASURE
	and THE PEARL
	OF GREAT PRICE
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:44-46">Matthew 13:44-46</span>). 
	</p>
<p>The subject of this last pair, as
	of the two former, is the same, but also under a slight diversity of
	aspect: namely— 
	</p>
<p>THE
	PRICELESS VALUE
	OF THE BLESSINGS OF THE
	KINGDOM. And while the one
	parable represents the Kingdom as "found without seeking,"
	the other holds forth the Kingdom as "sought and found."

<p><i>The Hidden Treasure</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:44-40.13.46- :">Matthew 13:44-40.13.46- :</span>).</p>
