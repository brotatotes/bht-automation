44. Again, the kingdom of heaven is
	like unto treasure hid in a field—no uncommon thing in
	unsettled and half-civilized countries, even now as well as in
	ancient times, when there was no other way of securing it from the
	rapacity of neighbors or marauders. (Jeremiah 41:8;
	Job 3:21; Proverbs 2:4).
	the which when a man hath
	found—that is, unexpectedly found. 
	he hideth, and for joy
	thereof—on perceiving what a treasure he had lighted on,
	surpassing the worth of all he possessed. 
	goeth and selleth all that he
	hath, and buyeth that field—in which case, by Jewish law, the
	treasure would become his own.
