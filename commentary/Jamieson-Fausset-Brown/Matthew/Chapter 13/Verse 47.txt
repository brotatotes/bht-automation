<p><b>47. Again, the kingdom of heaven is
	like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every
	kind</b>â€”The word here rendered "net" signifies a large
	<i>drag-net,</i> which draws everything after it, suffering nothing
	to escape, as distinguished from a <i>casting-net</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:16">Mark 1:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:18">Mark 1:18</span>). The far-reaching
	efficacy of the Gospel is thus denoted. This Gospel net "gathered
	of every kind," meaning every variety of character.</p>
