<p><b>55. Is not this the carpenter's
	son?</b>—In Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:3">Mark 6:3</span>) the
	question is, "Is not this the carpenter?" In all
	likelihood, our Lord, during His stay under the roof of His earthly
	parents, wrought along with His legal father. 
	</p>
<p><b>is not his mother called
	Mary?</b>—"Do we not know all about His parentage? Has He not
	grown up in the midst of us? Are not all His relatives our own
	townsfolk? Whence, then, such wisdom and such miracles?" These
	particulars of our Lord's <i>human</i> history constitute the most
	valuable testimony, first, to His true and real humanity—for they
	prove that during all His first thirty years His townsmen had
	discovered nothing about Him different from other men; secondly, to
	the divine character of His mission—for these Nazarenes proclaim
	both the unparalleled character of His teaching and the reality and
	glory of His miracles, as transcending human ability; and thirdly, to
	His wonderful humility and self-denial—in that when He was such as
	they now saw Him to be, He yet never gave any indications of it for
	thirty years, because "His hour was not yet come."
