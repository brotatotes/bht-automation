<p><b>1. Then came to Jesus scribes and
	Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem</b>—or "from Jerusalem."
	Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:1">Mark 7:1</span>) says they "came
	from" it: a deputation probably sent from the capital expressly
	to watch Him. As He had not come to them at the last Passover, which
