<p><b>11. Not that which goeth into the
	mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this
	defileth a man</b>â€”This is expressed even more emphatically in Mark
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:15">Mark 7:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:16">Mark 7:16</span>),
	and it is there added, "If any man have ears to hear, let him
	hear." As in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:9">Matthew 13:9</span>, this
	so oft-repeated saying seems designed to call attention to the
	<i>fundamental</i> and <i>universal</i> character of the truth it
	refers to.</p>
