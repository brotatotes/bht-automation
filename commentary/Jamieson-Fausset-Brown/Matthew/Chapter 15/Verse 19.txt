<p><b>19. For out of the heart proceed
	evil thoughts</b>—"evil reasonings"; referring here more
	immediately to those corrupt reasonings which had stealthily
	introduced and gradually reared up that hideous fabric of tradition
	which at length practically nullified the unchangeable principles of
	the moral law. But the statement is far broader than this; namely
	that the first shape which the evil that is in the heart takes, when
	it begins actively to stir, is that of "considerations" or
	"reasonings" on certain suggested actions.

<p><b>murders, adulteries,
	fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies</b>—detractions,
	whether directed against God or man; here the reference seems to be
	to the latter. Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:22">Mark 7:22</span>)
	adds, "covetousnesses"—or desires after more;
	"wickednesses"—here meaning, perhaps, malignities of
	various forms; "deceit, lasciviousness"—meaning, excess
	or enormity of any kind, though by later writers restricted to
	lewdness; "an evil eye"—meaning, all looks or glances of
	envy, jealousy, or ill will towards a neighbor; "pride,
	foolishness"—in the Old Testament sense of "folly";
	that is, criminal senselessness, the folly of the <i>heart.</i> How
	appalling is this black catalogue!</p>
