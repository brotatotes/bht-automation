	to his father or his mother, It is a gift</b>â€”or simply, "A
	gift!" In Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:11">Mark 7:11</span>),
	it is, "<i>Corban!</i>" that is, "An oblation!"
	meaning, any unbloody offering or gift dedicated to sacred uses.

	be profited by me;</b></p>
