6. And honour not his father or his
	mother, he shall be free —that is, It is
	true, father—mother—that by giving to thee this, which I now
	present, thou mightest be profited by me; but I have gifted it to
	pious uses, and therefore, at whatever cost to thee, I am not now at
	liberty to alienate any portion of it. "And," it is added
	in Mark (Mark 7:12), "ye
	suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother." To
	dedicate property to God is indeed lawful and laudable, but not at
	the expense of filial duty. 
	Thus have ye made the
	commandment of God of none effect—cancelled or nullified it "by
	your tradition."
