8. This people draweth nigh unto me
	with their mouth, c.—By putting the commandments of men on a
	level with the divine requirements, their whole worship was
	rendered vain—a principle of deep moment in the service of God.
	"For," it is added in  :-, "laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the
	tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups and many other such
	like things ye do." The drivelling nature of their multitudinous
	observances is here pointedly exposed, in contrast with the manly
	observance of "the commandment of God"; and when our Lord
	says, "Many other such like things ye do," it is implied
	that He had but given a specimen of the hideous treatment which the
	divine law received, and the grasping disposition which, under the
	mask of piety, was manifested by the ecclesiastics of that day.
