<p><b>13. When Jesus came into the
	coasts</b>—"the parts," that is, the territory or region.
	In Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:27">Mark 8:27</span>) it is "the
	towns" or "villages." 
	</p>
<p><b>of Cæsarea Philippi</b>—It
	lay at the foot of Mount Lebanon, near the sources of the Jordan, in
	the territory of Dan, and at the northeast extremity of Palestine. It
	was originally called <i>Panium</i> (from a cavern in its
	neighborhood dedicated to the god <i>Pan</i>) and <i>Paneas.</i>
	Philip, the tetrarch, the only good son of Herod the Great, in whose
	dominions Paneas lay, having beautified and enlarged it, changed its
	name to <i>Cæsarea,</i> in honor of the Roman emperor, and added
	<i>Philippi</i> after his own name, to distinguish it from the other
	<i>Cæsarea</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:1">Acts 10:1</span>) on
	the northeast coast of the Mediterranean Sea. [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 15.10,3; 18.2,1]. This quiet and distant retreat
	Jesus appears to have sought with the view of talking over with the
	Twelve the fruit of His past labors, and breaking to them for the
	first time the sad intelligence of His approaching death. 
	</p>
<p><b>he asked his disciples</b>—"by
	the way," says Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:27">Mark 8:27</span>),
	and "as He was alone praying," says Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:27- :">Mark 8:27- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>saying, Whom</b>—or more
	grammatically, "Who" 
	</p>
<p><b>do men say that I the Son of
	man am?</b>—(or, "that the Son of man is"—the recent
	editors omitting here the <i>me</i> of Mark and Luke [<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+8:27">Mark 8:27</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:18">Luke 9:18</span>]; though the evidence
	seems pretty nearly balanced)—that is, "What are the views
	generally entertained of Me, the Son of man, after going up and down
	among them so long?" He had now closed the first great stage of
	His ministry, and was just entering on the last dark one. His spirit,
	burdened, sought relief in retirement, not only from the multitude,
	but even for a season from the Twelve. He retreated into "the
	secret place of the Most High," pouring out His soul "in
	supplications and prayers, with strong crying and tears" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:18- :">Luke 9:18- :</span>). On rejoining His disciples, and as they were pursuing their
	quiet journey, He asked them this question.</p>
