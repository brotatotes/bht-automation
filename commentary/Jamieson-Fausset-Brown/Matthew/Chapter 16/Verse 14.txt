	Antipas was not singular in his surmise (Matthew 14:1;

	of Sorrows" and "the weeping prophet?" 
	or one of the prophets—or,
	as Luke (Luke 9:8) expresses it,
	"that one of the old prophets is risen again." In another
	report of the popular opinions which Mark (Luke 9:8- :) gives us, it is thus expressed, "That it is a prophet
	[or], as one of the prophets": in other words, That He was a
	prophetical person, resembling those of old.
