15. He saith unto them, But
	whom—rather, "who." 
	say ye that I am?—He
	had never put this question before, but the crisis He was reaching
	made it fitting that He should now have it from them. We may suppose
	this to be one of those moments of which the prophet says, in His
	name, "Then I said, I have labored in vain; I have spent my
	strength for naught, and in vain" ( :-): Lo, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig
	tree; and what is it? As the result of all, I am taken for John the
	Baptist, for Elias, for Jeremias, for one of the prophets. Yet some
	there are that have beheld My glory, the glory as of the
	Only-begotten of the Father, and I shall hear their voice, for it is
	sweet.
