<p><b>16. And Simon Peter answered and
	said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God</b>—He does
	not say, "Scribes and Pharisees, rulers and people, are all
	perplexed; and shall we, unlettered fishermen, presume to decide?"
	But feeling the light of his Master's glory shining in his soul, he
	breaks forth—not in a tame, prosaic acknowledgment, "<i>I
	believe that Thou art,</i>" c.—but in the language of
	adoration—such as one uses in worship, "THOU
	ART THE CHRIST,
	THE SON OF THE
	LIVING GOD!"
	He first owns Him the promised <i>Messiah</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) then he rises higher, echoing the voice from heaven—"This
	is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased"; and in the
	important addition—"Son of the LIVING
	GOD"—he recognizes
	the essential and eternal life of God as in this His Son—though
	doubtless without that distinct perception afterwards vouchsafed.</p>
