<p><b>17. And Jesus answered and said unto
	him, Blessed art thou</b>—Though it is not to be doubted that
	Peter, in this noble testimony to Christ, only expressed the
	conviction of all the Twelve, yet since he alone seems to have had
	clear enough apprehensions to put that conviction in proper and
	suitable words, and courage enough to speak them out, and readiness
	enough to do this at the right time—so he only, of all the Twelve,
	seems to have met the present want, and communicated to the saddened
	soul of the Redeemer at the critical moment that balm which was
	needed to cheer and refresh it. Nor is Jesus above giving indication
	of the deep satisfaction which this speech yielded Him, and hastening
	to respond to it by a signal acknowledgment of Peter in return.

<p><b>Simon Bar-jona</b>—or, "son
	of Jona" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:42">John 1:42</span>), or
	"Jonas" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15">John 21:15</span>).
	This name, denoting his humble fleshly extraction, seems to have been
	purposely here mentioned, to contrast the more vividly with the
	spiritual elevation to which divine illumination had raised him.

<p><b>for flesh and blood hath not
	revealed it unto thee</b>—"This is not the fruit of human
	teaching." 
	</p>
<p><b>but my Father which is in
	heaven</b>—In speaking of God, Jesus, it is to be observed, never
	calls Him, "our Father" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15- :">John 21:15- :</span>), but either "your Father"—when He would
	encourage His timid believing ones with the assurance that He was
	theirs, and teach themselves to call Him so—or, as here, "My
	Father," to signify some peculiar action or aspect of Him as
	"the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
