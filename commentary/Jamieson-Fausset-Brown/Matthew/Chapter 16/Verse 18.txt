18. And I say also unto thee—that
	is, "As thou hast borne such testimony to Me, even so in return
	do I to thee." 
	That thou art Peter—At
	his first calling, this new name was announced to him as an honor
	afterwards to be conferred on him ( :-). Now he gets it, with an explanation of what it was meant
	to convey. 
	and upon this rock—As
	"Peter" and "Rock" are one word in the dialect
	familiarly spoken by our Lord—the Aramaic or Syro-Chaldaic,
	which was the mother tongue of the country—this exalted play
	upon the word can be fully seen only in languages which have one
	word for both. Even in the Greek it is imperfectly
	represented. In French, as WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON remark, it
	is perfect, Pierre—pierre.
I will build my Church—not
	on the man Simon Bar-jona; but on him as the heavenly-taught
	confessor of a faith. "My Church," says our Lord, calling
	the Church HIS OWN;
	a magnificent expression regarding Himself, remarks BENGEL—nowhere
	else occurring in the Gospels. 
	and the gates of hell—"of
	Hades," or, the unseen world; meaning, the gates of Death: in
	other words, "It shall never perish." Some explain it of
	"the assaults of the powers of darkness"; but though that
	expresses a glorious truth, probably the former is the sense here.
