<p><b>18. And I say also unto thee</b>—that
	is, "As thou hast borne such testimony to Me, even so in return
	do I to thee." 
	</p>
<p><b>That thou art Peter</b>—At
	his first calling, this new name was announced to him as an honor
	afterwards to be conferred on him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Now he gets it, with an explanation of what it was meant
	to convey. 
	</p>
<p><b>and upon this rock</b>—As
	"Peter" and "Rock" are one word in the dialect
	familiarly spoken by our Lord—the <i>Aramaic</i> or <i>Syro-Chaldaic,</i>
	which was the mother tongue of the country—this exalted <i>play
	upon the word</i> can be fully seen only in languages which have one
	word for both. Even in the <i>Greek</i> it is imperfectly
	represented. In French, as WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON remark, it
	is perfect, <i>Pierre—pierre.</i>
</p>
<p><b>I will build my Church</b>—not
	on the man Simon Bar-jona; but on him as the heavenly-taught
	confessor of a faith. "My Church," says our Lord, calling
	the Church HIS OWN;
	a magnificent expression regarding Himself, remarks BENGEL—nowhere
	else occurring in the Gospels. 
	</p>
<p><b>and the gates of hell</b>—"of
	Hades," or, the unseen world; meaning, the gates of Death: in
	other words, "It shall never perish." Some explain it of
	"the assaults of the powers of darkness"; but though that
	expresses a glorious truth, probably the former is the sense here.</p>
