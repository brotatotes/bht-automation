19. And I will give unto thee the
	keys of the kingdom of heaven—the kingdom of God about to be
	set up on earth 
	and whatsoever thou shalt
	bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt
	loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven—Whatever this mean, it
	was soon expressly extended to all the apostles ( :-); so that the claim of supreme authority in the Church,
	made for Peter by the Church of Rome, and then arrogated to
	themselves by the popes as the legitimate successors of St. Peter, is
	baseless and impudent. As first in confessing Christ, Peter got this
	commission before the rest; and with these "keys," on the
	day of Pentecost, he first "opened the door of faith" to
	the Jews, and then, in the person of Cornelius, he was honored
	to do the same to the Gentiles. Hence, in the lists of the
	apostles, Peter is always first named. See on  :-. One thing is clear, that not in all the New Testament is
	there the vestige of any authority either claimed or exercised by
	Peter, or conceded to him, above the rest of the apostles—a thing
	conclusive against the Romish claims in behalf of that apostle.
