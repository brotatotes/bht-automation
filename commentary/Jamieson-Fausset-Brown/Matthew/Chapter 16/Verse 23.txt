<p><b>23. But he turned, and said</b>—in
	the hearing of the rest; for Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) expressly says, "When He had turned about and looked
	on His disciples, He rebuked Peter"; perceiving that he had but
	boldly uttered what others felt, and that the check was needed by
	them also. 
	</p>
<p><b>Get thee behind me, Satan</b>—the
	same words as He had addressed to the Tempter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); for He felt in it a satanic lure, a whisper from hell, to
	move Him from His purpose to suffer. So He shook off the Serpent,
	then coiling around Him, and "felt no harm" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). How quickly has the "rock" turned to a devil!
	The fruit of divine teaching the Lord delighted to honor in Peter;
	but the mouthpiece of hell, which he had in a moment of forgetfulness
	become, the Lord shook off with horror. 
	</p>
<p><b>thou art an offence</b>—a
	stumbling-block. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto me</b>—"Thou
	playest the Tempter, casting a stumbling-block in My way to the
	Cross. Could it succeed, where wert thou? and how should the
	Serpent's head be bruised?" 
	</p>
<p><b>for thou savourest not</b>—thou
	thinkest not. 
	</p>
<p><b>the things that be of God,
	but those that be of men</b>—"Thou art carried away by human
	views of the way of setting up Messiah's kingdom, quite contrary to
	those of God." This was kindly said, not to take off the sharp
	edge of the rebuke, but to explain and justify it, as it was evident
	Peter knew not what was in the bosom of his rash speech.</p>
