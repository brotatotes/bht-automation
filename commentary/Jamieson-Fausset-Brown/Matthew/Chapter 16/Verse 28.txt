<p><b>28. Verily I say unto you, There be
	some standing here</b>—"some of those standing here." 
	</p>
<p><b>which shall not taste of
	death, fill they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom</b>—or,
	as in Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1">Mark 9:1</span>), "till
	they see the kingdom of God come with power"; or, as in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:1- :">Mark 9:1- :</span>), more simply still, "till they see the kingdom of
	God." The reference, beyond doubt, is to the firm establishment
	and victorious progress, in the lifetime of some then present, of
	that new kingdom of Christ, which was destined to work the greatest
	of all changes on this earth, and be the grand pledge of His final
	coming in glory.</p>
