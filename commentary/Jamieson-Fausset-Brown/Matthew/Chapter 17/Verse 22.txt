<p><b>22. And while they abode in Galilee,
	Jesus said unto them</b>—Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), as usual, is very precise here: "And they departed
	thence"—that is, from the scene of the last miracle—"and
	passed through Galilee; and He would not that any man should know
	it." So this was not a preaching, but a private, journey through
	Galilee. Indeed, His public ministry in Galilee was now all but
	concluded. Though He sent out the Seventy after this to preach and
	heal, He Himself was little more in public there, and He was soon to
	bid it a final adieu. Till this hour arrived, He was chiefly occupied
	with the Twelve, preparing them for the coming events.

<p><b>The Son of man shall be
	betrayed into the hands of men . . . And they were exceeding
	sorry</b>—Though the shock would not be so great as at the first
	announcement (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:21">Matthew 16:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:22">Matthew 16:22</span>),
	their "sorrow" would not be the less, but probably the
	greater, the deeper the intelligence went down into their hearts, and
	a new wave dashing upon them by this repetition of the heavy tidings.
	Accordingly, Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:43">Luke 9:43</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:44">Luke 9:44</span>), connecting it with the
	scene of the miracle just recorded, and the teaching which arose out
	of it—or possibly with all His recent teaching—says our Lord
	forewarned the Twelve that they would soon stand in need of all that
	teaching: "But while they wondered every one at all things which
	Jesus did, He said unto His disciples, Let these sayings sink down
	into your ears; for the Son of man shall be delivered," c.: "Be
	not carried off your feet by the grandeur you have lately seen in Me,
	but remember what I have told you, and now tell you again, that that
	Sun in whose beams ye now rejoice is soon to set in midnight gloom."
	Remarkable is the antithesis in those words of our Lord preserved in
	all the three narratives—"The son of <i>man</i> shall be
	betrayed into the hands of <i>men.</i>" Luke adds (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:44- :">Luke 9:44- :</span>) that "they understood not this saying, and it was hid
	from them, that they perceived it not"—for the plainest
	statements, when they encounter long-continued and obstinate
	prejudices, are seen through a distorting and dulling medium—"and
	were afraid to ask Him" deterred partly by the air of lofty
	sadness with which doubtless these sayings were uttered, and on which
	they would be reluctant to break in, and partly by the fear of laying
	themselves open to rebuke for their shallowness and timidity. How
	artless is all this!

<p>The time of this section is
	evidently in immediate succession to that of the preceding one. The
	brief but most pregnant incident which it records is given by Matthew
	alone—for whom, no doubt, it would have a peculiar interest, from
	its relation to his own town and his own familiar lake.</p>
