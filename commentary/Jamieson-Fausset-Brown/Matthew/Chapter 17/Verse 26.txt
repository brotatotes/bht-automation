<p><b>26. Peter saith unto him, Of
	strangers</b>—"of those not their children." 
	</p>
<p><b>Jesus saith unto him, Then
	are the children free</b>—By "the children" our Lord
	cannot here mean Himself and the Twelve together, in some loose sense
	of their near relationship to God as their common Father. For besides
	that our Lord never once mixes Himself up with His disciples in
	speaking of their relation to God, but ever studiously keeps His
	relation and theirs apart (see, for example, on the last words of
	this chapter)—this would be to teach the right of believers to
	exemption from the dues required for sacred services, in the teeth of
	all that Paul teaches and that He Himself indicates throughout. He
	can refer here, then, only to Himself; using the word "children"
	evidently in order to express the general principle observed by
	sovereigns, who do not draw taxes from their own children, and thus
	convey the truth respecting His own exemption the more
	strikingly:—namely, "If the sovereign's own family be exempt,
	you know the inference in My case"; or to express it more
	nakedly than Jesus thought needful and fitting: "This is a tax
	for upholding My Father's House. As His Son, then, that tax is not
	due by Me—I AM FREE."</p>
