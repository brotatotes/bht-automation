<p><b>27. Notwithstanding, lest we should
	offend</b>—stumble. 
	</p>
<p><b>them</b>—all ignorant as
	they are of My relation to the Lord of the Temple, and should
	misconstrue a claim to exemption into indifference to His honor who
	dwells in it. 
	</p>
<p><b>go thou to the sea</b>—Capernaum,
	it will be remembered, lay on the Sea of Galilee. 
	</p>
<p><b>and cast an hook, and take up
	the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth,
	thou shall find a piece of money</b>—a stater. So it should have
	been rendered, and not indefinitely, as in our version, for the coin
	was an Attic silver coin equal to two of the afore-mentioned
	"didrachms" of half a shekel's value, and so, was the exact
	sum required for both. Accordingly, the Lord adds, 
	</p>
<p><b>that take, and give unto them
	for me and thee</b>—literally, "instead of Me and thee";
	perhaps because the payment was a <i>redemption of the person</i>
	paid for (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+30:12">Exodus 30:12</span>) —in which
	view Jesus certainly was "free." If the house was Peter's,
	this will account for payment being provided on this occasion, not
	for all the Twelve, but only for him and His Lord. Observe, our Lord
	does not say "for us," but "for Me and thee";
	thus distinguishing the Exempted One and His non-exempted disciple.</p>
