<p><b>10. Take heed that ye
	despise</b>—stumble. 
	</p>
<p><b>not one of these little ones;
	for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the
	face of my Father which is in heaven</b>—A difficult verse; but
	perhaps the following may be more than an illustration:—Among men,
	those who nurse and rear the royal children, however humble in
	themselves, are allowed free entrance with their charge, and a degree
	of familiarity which even the highest state ministers dare not
	assume. Probably our Lord means that, in virtue of their charge over
	His disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+1:13">Hebrews 1:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:51">John 1:51</span>),
	the angels have <i>errands</i> to the throne, a <i>welcome</i> there,
	and a <i>dear familiarity</i> in dealing with "His Father which
	is in heaven," which on their own matters they could not assume.</p>
