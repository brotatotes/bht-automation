<p><b>11. For the Son of man is come to
	save that which was lost</b>—or "is lost." A golden
	saying, once and again repeated in different forms. Here the
	connection seems to be, "Since the whole object and errand of
	the Son of man into the world is to save the lost, take heed lest, by
	causing offenses, ye lose the saved." That this is the idea
	intended we may gather from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
