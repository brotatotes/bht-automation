<p><b>20. For where two or three are
	gathered together in my name</b>—or "unto my name." 
	</p>
<p><b>there am I in the midst of
	them</b>—On this passage—so full of sublime encouragement to
	Christian union in action and prayer—observe, first, the connection
	in which it stands. Our Lord had been speaking of church meetings
	before which the obstinate perversity of a brother was in the last
	resort to be brought, and whose decision was to be final—such honor
	does the Lord of the Church put upon its lawful assemblies. But not
	these assemblies only does He deign to countenance and honor. For
	even two uniting to bring any matter before Him shall find that they
	are not alone, for My Father is with them, says Jesus. Next, observe
	the <i>premium here put upon union in prayer.</i> As this cannot
	exist with fewer than two, so by letting it down so low as that
	number, He gives the utmost conceivable encouragement to union in
	this exercise. But what kind of union? Not an agreement merely to
	pray in concert, but to pray <i>for some definite thing.</i> "As
	touching anything which they shall ask," says our Lord—anything
	they shall agree to ask in concert. At the same time, it is plain He
	had certain things at that moment in His eye, as most fitting and
	needful subjects for such concerted prayer. The Twelve had been
	"falling out by the way" about the miserable question of
	precedence in their Master's kingdom, and this, as it stirred their
	corruptions, had given rise—or at least was in danger of giving
	rise—to "offenses" perilous to their souls. The Lord
	Himself had been directing them how to deal with one another about
	such matters. "But now shows He unto them a more excellent way."
	Let them bring all such matters—yea, and everything whatsoever by
	which either their own loving relationship to each other, or the good
	of His kingdom at large, might be affected—to their Father in
	heaven; and if they be but agreed in petitioning Him about that
	thing, it shall be done for them of His Father which is in heaven.
	But further, it is not merely union in prayer for the same thing—for
	that might be with very jarring ideas of the thing to be desired—but
	it is to symphonious prayer, the prayer by kindred spirits, members
	of one family, servants of one Lord, constrained by the same love,
	fighting under one banner, cheered by assurances of the same victory;
	a living and loving union, whose voice in the divine ear is as the
	sound of many waters. Accordingly, what they ask "<i>on earth</i>"
	is done for them, says Jesus, "of My Father which is <i>in
	heaven.</i>" Not for nothing does He say, "of MY
	FATHER"—not "YOUR
	FATHER"; as is
	evident from what follows: "For where two or three are gathered
	together <i>unto My name</i>"—the "My" is emphatic,
	"<i>there am I</i> in the midst of them." As His name would
	prove a spell to draw together many clusters of His dear disciples,
	so if there should be but two or three, that will attract Himself
	down into the midst of them; and related as He is to both the
	parties, the petitioners and the Petitioned—to the one on earth by
	the tie of His assumed flesh, and to the other in heaven by the tie
	of His eternal Spirit—their symphonious prayers on earth would
	thrill upward through Him to heaven, be carried by Him into the
	holiest of all, and so reach the Throne. Thus will He be the living
	Conductor of the prayer upward, and the answer downward.
