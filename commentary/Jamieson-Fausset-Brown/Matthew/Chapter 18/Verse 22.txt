<p><b>22. Jesus saith unto him, I say not
	unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven</b>â€”that
	is, so long as it shall be needed and sought: you are never to come
	to the point of refusing forgiveness sincerely asked. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
