<p><b>1. And it came to pass, that when
	Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee</b>—This
	marks a very solemn period in our Lord's public ministry. So slightly
	is it touched here, and in the corresponding passage of Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), that few readers probably note it as the Redeemer's
	<i>Farewell to Galilee,</i> which however it was. See on the sublime
	statement of Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51">Luke 9:51</span>),

	Lord's work.

	is, to the further, or east side of the Jordan, into Perea, the
	dominions of Herod Antipas. But though one might conclude from our
	Evangelist that our Lord went straight from the one region to the
	other, we know from the other Gospels that a considerable time
	elapsed between the departure from the one and the arrival at the
	other, during which many of the most important events in our Lord's
	public life occurred—probably a large part of what is recorded in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51- :">Luke 9:51- :</span>, and part of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+9:51- :">Luke 9:51- :</span>.</p>
