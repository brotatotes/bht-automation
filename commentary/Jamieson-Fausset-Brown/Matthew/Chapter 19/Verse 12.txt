	were so born from their mother's womb—persons constitutionally
	either incapable of or indisposed to marriage. 
	and there are some eunuchs
	which were made eunuchs of men—persons rendered incapable by
	others. 
	and there be eunuchs which
	have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake—persons
	who, to do God's work better, deliberately choose this state. Such
	was Paul (1 Corinthians 7:7). 
	He that is able to receive
	it, let him receive it—"He who feels this to be his proper
	vocation, let him embrace it"; which, of course, is as much as
	to say—"he only." Thus, all are left free in this matter.
