5. And said, For this cause—to
	follow out this divine appointment. 
	shall a man leave father and
	mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one
	flesh?—Jesus here sends them back to the original constitution
	of man as one pair, a male and a female; to their marriage, as such,
	by divine appointment; and to the purpose of God, expressed by the
	sacred historian, that in all time one man and one woman should by
	marriage become one flesh—so to continue as long as both are in the
	flesh. This being God's constitution, let not man break
	it up by causeless divorces.
