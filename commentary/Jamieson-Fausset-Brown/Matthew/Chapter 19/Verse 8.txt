<p><b>8. He saith unto them, Moses</b>—as
	a civil lawgiver. 
	</p>
<p><b>because of</b>—or "having
	respect to." 
	</p>
<p><b>the hardness of your
	hearts</b>—looking to your low moral state, and your inability to
	endure the strictness of the original law. 
	</p>
<p><b>suffered you to put away your
	wives</b>—tolerated a relaxation of the strictness of the marriage
	bond—not as approving of it, but to prevent still greater evils. 
	</p>
<p><b>But from the beginning it was
	not so</b>—This is repeated, in order to impress upon His audience
	the temporary and purely civil character of this Mosaic relaxation.</p>
