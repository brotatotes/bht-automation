8. He saith unto them, Moses—as
	a civil lawgiver. 
	because of—or "having
	respect to." 
	the hardness of your
	hearts—looking to your low moral state, and your inability to
	endure the strictness of the original law. 
	suffered you to put away your
	wives—tolerated a relaxation of the strictness of the marriage
	bond—not as approving of it, but to prevent still greater evils. 
	But from the beginning it was
	not so—This is repeated, in order to impress upon His audience
	the temporary and purely civil character of this Mosaic relaxation.
