1. Now when Jesus was born in
	Bethlehem of Judea—so called to distinguish it from another
	Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebulun, near the Sea of Galilee ( :-); called also Beth-lehem-judah, as being in that
	tribe (Judges 17:7); and Ephrath
	(Genesis 35:16); and combining both,
	Beth-lehem Ephratah (Genesis 35:16- :). It lay about six miles southwest of Jerusalem. But how came
	Joseph and Mary to remove thither from Nazareth, the place of their
	residence? Not of their own accord, and certainly not with the view
	of fulfilling the prophecy regarding Messiah's birthplace; nay, they
	stayed at Nazareth till it was almost too late for Mary to travel
	with safety; nor would they have stirred from it at all, had not an
	order which left them no choice forced them to the appointed place. A
	high hand was in all these movements. (See on Genesis 35:16- :). 
	in the days of Herod the
	king—styled the Great; son of Antipater, an Edomite,
	made king by the Romans. Thus was "the sceptre departing from
	Judah" (Genesis 49:10), a sign
	that Messiah was now at hand. As Herod is known to have died in the
	year of Rome 750, in the fourth year before the commencement of our
	Christian era, the birth of Christ must be dated four years before
	the date usually assigned to it, even if He was born within the year
	of Herod's death, as it is next to certain that He was. 
	there came wise
	men—literally, "Magi" or "Magians,"
	probably of the learned class who cultivated astrology and kindred
	sciences. Balaam's prophecy (Genesis 49:10- :), and perhaps Daniel's (Genesis 49:10- :, c.), might have come down to them by tradition but nothing
	definite is known of them. 
	from the east—but
	whether from Arabia, Persia, or Mesopotamia is uncertain. 
	to Jerusalem—as the
	Jewish metropolis.
