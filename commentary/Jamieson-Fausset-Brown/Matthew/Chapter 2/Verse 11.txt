<p><b>and fell down and worshipped

	eagerly, and rejoiced with such exceeding joy, to pay, but a lofty
	spiritual homage. The next clause confirms this.

	"Frankincense" was an aromatic used in sacrificial
	offerings; "myrrh" was used in perfuming ointments. These,
	with the "gold" which they presented, seem to show that the
	offerers were persons in affluent circumstances. That the gold was
	presented to the infant King in token of His royalty; the
	frankincense in token of His divinity, and the myrrh, of His
	sufferings; or that they were designed to express His divine and
	human natures; or that the prophetical, priestly, and kingly offices
	of Christ are to be seen in these gifts; or that they were the
	offerings of three individuals respectively, each of them kings, the
	very names of whom tradition has handed down—all these are, at the
	best, precarious suppositions. But that the feelings of these devout
	givers are to be seen in the richness of their gifts, and that the
	gold, at least, would be highly serviceable to the parents of the
	blessed Babe in their unexpected journey to Egypt and stay there—that
	much at least admits of no dispute.</p>
