13. And when they were departed,
	behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying,
	Arise, and take the young child and his mother—Observe this
	form of expression, repeated in  :- —another indirect hint that Joseph was no more than the
	Child's guardian. Indeed, personally considered, Joseph has no
	spiritual significance, and very little place at all, in the Gospel
	history. 
	and flee into Egypt—which,
	being near, as ALFORD
	says, and a Roman province independent of Herod, and much inhabited
	by Jews, was an easy and convenient refuge. Ah! blessed Saviour, on
	what a checkered career hast Thou entered here below! At Thy birth
	there was no room for Thee in the inn; and now all Judea is too hot
	for Thee. How soon has the sword begun to pierce through the Virgin's
	soul (Luke 2:35)! How early does
	she taste the reception which this mysterious Child of hers is to
	meet with in the world! And whither is He sent? To "the house of
	bondage?" Well, it once was that. But Egypt was a house of
	refuge before it was a house of bondage, and now it has but returned
	to its first use. 
	and be thou there until I
	bring thee word; for Herod will seek the young child to destroy
	him—Herod's murderous purpose was formed before the Magi had
	reached Bethlehem.
