15. And was there until the death of
	Herod—which took place not very long after this of a horrible
	disease; the details of which will be found in JOSEPHUS
	[Antiquities, 17.6.1,5,7,8]. 
	that it might be fulfilled
	which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying— ( :-). 
	Out of Egypt have I called my
	son—Our Evangelist here quotes directly from the Hebrew,
	warily departing from the Septuagint, which renders the words,
	"From Egypt have I recalled his children," meaning Israel's
	children. The prophet is reminding his people how dear Israel was to
	God in the days of his youth; how Moses was bidden to say to Pharaoh,
	"Thus saith the Lord, Israel is My son, My first-born;
	and I say unto thee, Let My son go, that he may serve Me; and
	if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
	even thy first-born" (Exodus 4:22;
	Exodus 4:23); how, when Pharaoh
	refused, God having slain all his first-born, "called His
	own son out of Egypt," by a stroke of high-handed power and
	love. Viewing the words in this light, even if our Evangelist had not
	applied them to the recall from Egypt of God's own beloved,
	Only-begotten Son, the application would have been irresistibly made
	by all who have learnt to pierce beneath the surface to the deeper
	relations which Christ bears to His people, and both to God; and who
	are accustomed to trace the analogy of God's treatment of each
	respectively.
