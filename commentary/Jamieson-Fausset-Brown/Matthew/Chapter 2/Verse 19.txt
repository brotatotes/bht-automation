<p><b>19. But when Herod was
	dead</b>—Miserable Herod! Thou thoughtest thyself safe from a
	dreaded Rival; but it was He only that was safe from thee; and thou
	hast not long enjoyed even this fancied security. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.

<p><b>behold, an angel of the Lord
	appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</b>—Our translators,
	somewhat capriciously, render the same expression "<i>the</i>
	angel of the Lord," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:20">Matthew 1:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:13">Matthew 2:13</span>; and "<i>an</i>
	angel of the Lord," as here. As the same angel appears to have
	been employed on all these high occasions—and most likely he to
	whom in Luke is given the name of "Gabriel," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:19">Luke 1:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:26">Luke 1:26</span> —perhaps it should in
	every instance except the first, be rendered "<i>the</i> angel."</p>
