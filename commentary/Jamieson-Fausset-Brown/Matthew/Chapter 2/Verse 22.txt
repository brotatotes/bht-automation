<p><b>22. But when he heard that Archelaus
	did reign in Judea in the room of his father Herod</b>—Archelaus
	succeeded to Judea, Samaria, and Idumea; but Augustus refused him the
	title of <i>king</i> till it should be seen how he conducted himself;
	giving him only the title of <i>ethnarch</i> [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 17.11,4]. Above this, however, he never rose. The
	people, indeed, recognized him as his father's successor; and so it
	is here said that he "<i>reigned</i> in the room of his father
	Herod." But, after ten years' defiance of the Jewish law and
	cruel tyranny, the people lodged heavy complaints against him, and
	the emperor banished him to Vienne in Gaul, reducing Judea again to a
	Roman province. Then the "scepter" clean "departed
	from Judah." 
	</p>
<p><b>he was afraid to go
	thither</b>—and no wonder, for the reason just mentioned. 
	</p>
<p><b>notwithstanding</b>—or more
	simply, "but." 
	</p>
<p><b>being warned of God in a
	dream, he turned aside</b>—withdrew. 
	</p>
<p><b>into the parts of Galilee</b>—or
	the Galilean parts. The whole country west of the Jordan was at this
	time, as is well known, divided into three provinces—GALILEE
	being the northern, JUDEA
	the southern, and SAMARIA
	the central province. The province of Galilee was under the
	jurisdiction of Herod Antipas, the brother of Archelaus, his father
	having left him that and Perea, on the east side of the Jordan, as
	his share of the kingdom, with the title of <i>tetrarch,</i> which
	Augustus confirmed. Though crafty and licentious, according to
	JOSEPHUS—precisely what
	the Gospel history shows him to be (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> —he was
	of a less cruel disposition than Archelaus; and Nazareth being a good
	way off from the seat of government, and considerably secluded, it
	was safer to settle there.</p>
