<p><b>4. And when he had gathered all the
	chief priests and scribes of the people together</b>—The class of
	the "chief priests" included the high priest for the time
	being, together with all who had previously filled this office; for
	though the then head of the Aaronic family was the only rightful high
	priest, the Romans removed them at pleasure, to make way for
	creatures of their own. In this class probably were included also the
	heads of the four and twenty courses of the priests. The "scribes"
	were at first merely transcribers of the law and synagogue readers;
	afterwards interpreters of the law, both civil and religious, and so
	both lawyers and divines. The first of these classes, a proportion of
	the second, and "the elders"—that is, as LIGHTFOOT
	thinks, "those elders of the laity that were not of the
	Levitical tribe"—constituted the supreme council of the
	nation, called the <i>Sanhedrim,</i> the members of which, at their
	full complement, numbered seventy-two. That this was the council
	which Herod now convened is most probable, from the solemnity of the
	occasion; for though the elders are not mentioned, we find a similar
	omission where all three were certainly meant (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+26:59">Matthew 26:59</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:1">Matthew 27:1</span>). As MEYER
	says, it was all the theologians of the nation whom Herod convened,
	because it was a theological response that he wanted. 
	</p>
<p><b>he demanded of them</b>—as
	the authorized interpreters of Scripture. 
	</p>
<p><b>where Christ</b>—the
	Messiah. 
	</p>
<p><b>should be born</b>—according
	to prophecy.</p>
