<p><b>6. And thou, Bethlehem, </b><i><b>in</b></i><b>
	the land of Juda</b>—the "in" being familiarly left out,
	as we say, "London, Middlesex." 
	</p>
<p><b>art not the least among the
	princes of Judah: for out of thee shall come a Governor,</b> c.—This
	quotation, though differing verbally, agrees substantially with the
	<i>Hebrew</i> and the <i>Septuagint.</i> For says the prophet,
	"Though thou be little, yet out of thee shall come the
	Ruler"—this honor more than compensating for its natural
	insignificance while our Evangelist, by a lively turn, makes him say,
	"Thou art <i>not the least:</i> for out of thee shall come a
	Governor"—this distinction lifting it from the lowest to the
	highest rank. The "thousands of Juda," in the prophet, mean
	the subordinate divisions of the tribe: our Evangelist, instead of
	these, merely names the "princes" or heads of these
	families, including the districts which they occupied. 
	</p>
<p><b>that shall rule</b>—or
	"feed," as in the <i>Margin.</i>
</p>
<p><b>my people Israel</b>—In the
	Old Testament, kings are, by a beautiful figure, styled "shepherds"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+34:1-10">Ezekiel 34:1-10</span>, c.). The
	classical writers use the same figure. The pastoral rule of Jehovah
	and Messiah over His people is a representation pervading all
	Scripture, and rich in import. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+23:1-6">Psalms 23:1-6</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:11">Isaiah 40:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:24">Ezekiel 37:24</span>;

	That this prophecy of Micah referred to the Messiah, was admitted by
	the ancient Rabbins.

	Bethlehem by Herod to See the Babe, and Bring Him Word, Make a
