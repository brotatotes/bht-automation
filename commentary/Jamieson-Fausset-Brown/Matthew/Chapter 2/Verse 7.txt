7. Then Herod, when he had privily
	called the wise men—Herod has so far succeeded in his murderous
	design: he has tracked the spot where lies his victim, an unconscious
	babe. But he has another point to fix—the date of His birth—without
	which he might still miss his mark. The one he had got from the
	Sanhedrim; the other he will have from the sages; but secretly, lest
	his object should be suspected and defeated. So he 
	inquired of them
	diligently—rather, "precisely." 
	what time the star
	appeared—presuming that this would be the best clue to the age
	of the child. The unsuspecting strangers tell him all. And now he
	thinks he is succeeding to a wish, and shall speedily clutch his
	victim; for at so early an age as they indicate, He would not likely
	have been removed from the place of His birth. Yet he is wary. He
	sends them as messengers from himself, and bids them come to him,
	that he may follow their pious example.
