	</p>
<p>This parable, recorded only by
	Matthew, is closely connected with the <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, being spoken with reference to Peter's
	question as to how it should fare with those who, like himself, had
	left all for Christ. It is designed to show that while <i>they</i>
	would be richly rewarded, a certain equity would still be observed
	towards <i>later</i> converts and workmen in His service.</p>
