1. For the kingdom of heaven is like
	unto a man that is an householder, c.â€”The figure of a vineyard,
	to represent the rearing of souls for heaven, the culture required
	and provided for that purpose, and the care and pains which God takes
	in that whole matter, is familiar to every reader of the Bible.
	(Psalms 80:8-16 Isaiah 5:1-7;
	Jeremiah 2:21; Luke 20:9-16;
	John 15:1-8). At vintage
	time, as WEBSTER and
	WILKINSON remark, labor
	was scarce, and masters were obliged to be early in the market to
	secure it. Perhaps the pressing nature of the work of the Gospel, and
	the comparative paucity of laborers, may be incidentally suggested,
	Matthew 9:37; Matthew 9:38.
	The "laborers," as in Matthew 9:38- :, are first, the official servants of the Church, but
	after them and along with them all the servants of Christ,
	whom He has laid under the weightiest obligation to work in His
	service.
