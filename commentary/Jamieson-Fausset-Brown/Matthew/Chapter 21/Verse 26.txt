<p><b>26. But if we shall say, Of men; we
	fear the people</b>—rather, "the multitude." In Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) it is, "all the people will stone us"—"stone
	us to death." 
	</p>
<p><b>for all hold John as a
	prophet</b>—Crooked, cringing hypocrites! No wonder Jesus gave you
	no answer.</p>
