<p><b>27. And they answered Jesus, and
	said, We cannot tell</b>—Evidently their difficulty was, how to
	answer, so as neither to shake their determination to reject the
	claims of Christ nor damage their reputation with the people. For the
	truth itself they cared nothing whatever.

<p><b>Neither tell I you by what
	authority I do these things</b>—What composure and dignity of
	wisdom does our Lord here display, as He turns their question upon
	themselves, and, while revealing His knowledge of their hypocrisy,
	closes their mouths! Taking advantage of the surprise, silence, and
	awe produced by this reply, our Lord followed it up immediately by
	the two following parables.
