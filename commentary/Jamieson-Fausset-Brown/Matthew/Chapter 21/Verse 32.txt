32. For John came unto you in the
	way of righteousness—that is, calling you to repentance; as
	Noah is styled "a preacher of righteousness" ( :-), when like the Baptist he warned the old world to "flee
	from the wrath to come." 
	and ye believed him not—They
	did not reject him; nay, they "were willing for a season to
	rejoice in his light" ( :-); but they would not receive his testimony to Jesus. 
	but the publicans and the
	harlots believed him—Of the publicans this is twice expressly
	recorded, Luke 3:12; Luke 7:29.
	Of the harlots, then, the same may be taken for granted, though the
	fact is not expressly recorded. These outcasts gladly believed the
	testimony of John to the coming Saviour, and so hastened to Jesus
	when He came. See Luke 7:37;
	Luke 15:1, &c. 
	and ye, when ye had seen it,
	repented not afterward, that ye might believe him—Instead of
	being "provoked to jealousy" by their example, ye have seen
	them flocking to the Saviour and getting to heaven, unmoved.
