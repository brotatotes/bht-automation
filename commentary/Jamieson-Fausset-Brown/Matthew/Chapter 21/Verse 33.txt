33. Hear another parable: There was
	a certain householder, which planted a vineyard—(See on  :-). 
	and hedged it round about,
	and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower—These details
	are taken, as is the basis of the parable itself, from that beautiful
	parable of Isaiah 5:1-7, in
	order to fix down the application and sustain it by Old Testament
	authority. 
	and let it out to
	husbandmen—These are just the ordinary spiritual guides of the
	people, under whose care and culture the fruits of righteousness are
	expected to spring up. 
	and went into a far
	country—"for a long time" (Isaiah 5:1-23.5.7- :), leaving the vineyard to the laws of the spiritual
	husbandry during the whole time of the Jewish economy. On this
	phraseology, see on Isaiah 5:1-23.5.7- :.
