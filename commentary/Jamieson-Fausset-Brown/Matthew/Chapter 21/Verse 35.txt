35. And the husbandmen took his
	servants, and beat one—see Jeremiah 37:15;
	Jeremiah 38:6. 
	and killed another—see
	Jeremiah 26:20-23. 
	and stoned another—see
	2 Chronicles 24:21. Compare with this
	whole verse Matthew 21:35; Matthew 23:37,
	where our Lord reiterates these charges in the most melting strain.
