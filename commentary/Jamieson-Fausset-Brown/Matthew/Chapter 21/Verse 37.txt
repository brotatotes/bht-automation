<p><b>37. But last of all he sent unto
	them his son, saying, They will reverence my son</b>â€”In Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) this is most touchingly expressed: "Having yet
	therefore one son, His well-beloved, He sent Him also last unto them,
	saying, They will reverence My Son." Luke's version of it too
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:13">Luke 20:13</span>) is striking: "Then
	said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send My
	beloved Son: it may be they will reverence Him when they see Him."
	Who does not see that our Lord here severs Himself, by the sharpest
	line of demarcation, from all merely <i>human</i> messengers, and
	claims for Himself <i>Sonship</i> in its loftiest sense? (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:13- :">Luke 20:13- :</span>). The expression, "<i>It may be</i> they will
	reverence My Son," is designed to teach the almost unimaginable
	guilt of <i>not</i> reverentially welcoming God's Son.</p>
