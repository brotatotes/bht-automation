37. But last of all he sent unto
	them his son, saying, They will reverence my sonâ€”In Mark ( :-) this is most touchingly expressed: "Having yet
	therefore one son, His well-beloved, He sent Him also last unto them,
	saying, They will reverence My Son." Luke's version of it too
	(Luke 20:13) is striking: "Then
	said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send My
	beloved Son: it may be they will reverence Him when they see Him."
	Who does not see that our Lord here severs Himself, by the sharpest
	line of demarcation, from all merely human messengers, and
	claims for Himself Sonship in its loftiest sense? (Compare Luke 20:13- :). The expression, "It may be they will
	reverence My Son," is designed to teach the almost unimaginable
	guilt of not reverentially welcoming God's Son.
