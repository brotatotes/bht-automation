<p><b>41. They say unto him, He will
	miserably destroy those wicked men</b>—an emphatic alliteration not
	easily conveyed in English: "He will badly destroy those bad
	men," or "miserably destroy those miserable men," is
	something like it.

<p><b>and will let out his vineyard
	unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their
	seasons</b>—If this answer was given by the Pharisees, to whom our
	Lord addressed the parable, they thus unwittingly pronounced their
	own condemnation: as did David to Nathan the prophet (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and Simon the Pharisee to our Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, &amp;c.). But if it was given, as the two other Evangelists
	agree in representing it, by our Lord Himself, and the explicitness
	of the answer would seem to favor that supposition, then we can
	better explain the exclamation of the Pharisees which followed it, in
	Luke's report (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:16">Luke 20:16</span>) —"And
	when they heard it, they said, God forbid"—His whole meaning
	now bursting upon them.</p>
