43. Therefore say I unto you, The
	kingdom of God—God's visible Kingdom, or Church, upon earth,
	which up to this time stood in the seed of Abraham. 
	shall be taken from you, and
	given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof—that is,
	the great evangelical community of the faithful, which, after the
	extrusion of the Jewish nation, would consist chiefly of Gentiles,
	until "all Israel should be saved" (Romans 11:25;
	Romans 11:26). This vastly important
	statement is given by Matthew only.
