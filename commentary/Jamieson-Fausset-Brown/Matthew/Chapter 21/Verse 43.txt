<p><b>43. Therefore say I unto you, The
	kingdom of God</b>—God's visible Kingdom, or Church, upon earth,
	which up to this time stood in the seed of Abraham.

<p><b>shall be taken from you, and
	given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof</b>—that is,
	the great evangelical community of the faithful, which, after the
	extrusion of the Jewish nation, would consist chiefly of Gentiles,
	until "all Israel should be saved" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:25">Romans 11:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:26">Romans 11:26</span>). This vastly important
	statement is given by Matthew only.</p>
