<p><b>44. And whosoever shall fall on this
	stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind
	him to powder</b>—The Kingdom of God is here a Temple, in the
	erection of which a <i>certain stone,</i> rejected as unsuitable by
	the spiritual builders, is, by the great Lord of the House, made the
	keystone of the whole. On that Stone the builders were now "falling"
	and being "broken" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). They were sustaining great spiritual hurt; but soon that
	Stone should "fall upon <i>them</i>" and "grind them
	to powder" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:34">Daniel 2:34</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:35">Daniel 2:35</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+12:2">Zechariah 12:2</span>)
	—in their <i>corporate</i> capacity, in the tremendous destruction
	of Jerusalem, but <i>personally,</i> as unbelievers, in a more awful
	sense still.</p>
