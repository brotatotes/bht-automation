<p><b>2. The kingdom of heaven is like
	unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son</b>â€”"In
	this parable," as TRENCH
	admirably remarks, "we see how the Lord is revealing Himself in
	ever clearer light as the central Person of the kingdom, giving here
	a far plainer hint than in the last parable of the nobility of His
	descent. There He was indeed the Son, the only and beloved one (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), of the Householder; but here His race is royal, and He
	appears as Himself at once the King and the King's Son (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The last was a parable of the Old Testament history; and
	Christ is rather the last and greatest of the line of its prophets
	and teachers than the founder of a new kingdom. In that, God appears
	<i>demanding</i> something <i>from</i> men; in this, a parable of
	grace, God appears more as <i>giving</i> something <i>to</i> them.
	Thus, as often, the two complete each other: this taking up the
	matter where the other left it." The "marriage" of
	Jehovah to His people Israel was familiar to Jewish ears; and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> this marriage is seen consummated in the Person of
	Messiah "THE KING,"
	Himself addressed as "GOD"
	and yet as anointed by "HIS
	GOD" with the oil of
	gladness above His fellows. These apparent contradictions (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) are resolved in this parable; and Jesus, in claiming to
	be this King's Son, <i>serves Himself Heir to all that the prophets
	and sweet singers of Israel held forth as to Jehovah's ineffably near
	and endearing union to His people.</i> But observe carefully, that
	THE BRIDE
	does not come into view in this parable; its design being to teach
	certain truths under the figure of <i>guests</i> at a wedding <i>feast,</i>
	and the want of a wedding <i>garment,</i> which would not have
	harmonized with the introduction of the Bride.</p>
