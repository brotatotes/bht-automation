<p><b>4. my oxen and my fatlings are
	killed, and all things are ready; come unto the marriage</b>â€”This
	points to those Gospel calls <i>after</i> Christ's death,
	resurrection, ascension, and effusion of the Spirit, to which the
	parable could not directly allude, but when only it could be said,
	with strict propriety, "that all things were ready."
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:8">1 Corinthians 5:8</span>,
	"Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us; therefore, let us
	keep the feast"; also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+5:8- :">1 Corinthians 5:8- :</span>, "I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if
	any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread
	which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the
	world."</p>
