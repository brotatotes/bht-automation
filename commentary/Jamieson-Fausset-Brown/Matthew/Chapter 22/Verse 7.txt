<p><b>7. But when the king</b>—the Great
	God, who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>heard thereof, he was
	wroth</b>—at the affront put both on His Son, and on Himself who
	had deigned to invite them. 
	</p>
<p><b>and he sent forth his
	armies</b>—The <i>Romans</i> are here styled God's armies, just as
	the Assyrian is styled "the rod of His anger" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), as being the executors of His judicial vengeance. 
	</p>
<p><b>and destroyed those
	murderers</b>—and in what vast numbers did they do it! 
	</p>
<p><b>and burned up their city</b>—Ah!
	Jerusalem, once "the city of the Great King" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and even up almost to this time (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); but now it is "<i>their</i> city"—just as our
	Lord, a day or two after this, said of the temple, where God had so
	long dwelt, "Behold <i>your</i> house is left unto you desolate"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:38">Matthew 23:38</span>)! Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:43">Luke 19:43</span>;
