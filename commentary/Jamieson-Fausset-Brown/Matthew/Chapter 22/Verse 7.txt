7. But when the king—the Great
	God, who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
	heard thereof, he was
	wroth—at the affront put both on His Son, and on Himself who
	had deigned to invite them. 
	and he sent forth his
	armies—The Romans are here styled God's armies, just as
	the Assyrian is styled "the rod of His anger" ( :-), as being the executors of His judicial vengeance. 
	and destroyed those
	murderers—and in what vast numbers did they do it! 
	and burned up their city—Ah!
	Jerusalem, once "the city of the Great King" ( :-), and even up almost to this time ( :-); but now it is "their city"—just as our
	Lord, a day or two after this, said of the temple, where God had so
	long dwelt, "Behold your house is left unto you desolate"
	(Matthew 23:38)! Compare Luke 19:43;
	Luke 19:44.
