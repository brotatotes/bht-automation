	</p>
<p>For this long and terrible
	discourse we are indebted, with the exception of a few verses in Mark
	and Luke, to Matthew alone. But as it is only an extended repetition
	of denunciations uttered not long before at the table of a Pharisee,
	and recorded by Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:45-42.20.47- :">Luke 20:45-42.20.47- :</span>), we may take both together in the exposition.

<p><i>Denunciation of the Scribes and
	Pharisees</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:45-42.20.47- :">Luke 20:45-42.20.47- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p>The first twelve verses were
	addressed more immediately to the disciples, the rest to the scribes
	and Pharisees.</p>
