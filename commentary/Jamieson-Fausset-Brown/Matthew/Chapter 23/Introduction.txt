 CHAPTER 23 
	
 :-. DENUNCIATION OF THE
	SCRIBES AND
	PHARISEESâ€”LAMENTATION
	OVER JERUSALEM, AND
	FAREWELL TO THE TEMPLE.
	( = Mark 12:38-40; Luke 20:45-47).
	For this long and terrible
	discourse we are indebted, with the exception of a few verses in Mark
	and Luke, to Matthew alone. But as it is only an extended repetition
	of denunciations uttered not long before at the table of a Pharisee,
	and recorded by Luke (Luke 20:45-42.20.47- :), we may take both together in the exposition. 
	Denunciation of the Scribes and
	Pharisees (Luke 20:45-42.20.47- :). 
	The first twelve verses were
	addressed more immediately to the disciples, the rest to the scribes
	and Pharisees.
