<p><b>13. But woe unto you, scribes and
	Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against
	men</b>—Here they are charged with <i>shutting heaven</i> against
	men: in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:52">Luke 11:52</span> they are
	charged with what was worse, <i>taking away the key</i>—"the
	key of knowledge"—which means, not the key to open knowledge,
	but knowledge as the only key to open heaven. A right knowledge of
	God's revealed word is eternal life, as our Lord says (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+17:3">John 17:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:39">John 5:39</span>); but this they took
	away from the people, substituting for it their wretched traditions.</p>
