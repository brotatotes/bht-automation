<p><b>14. Woe unto you, scribes and
	Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses,</b> &amp;c.â€”Taking
	advantage of the helpless condition and confiding character of
	"widows," they contrived to obtain possession of their
	property, while by their "long prayers" they made them
	believe they were raised far above "filthy lucre." So much
	"the greater damnation" awaits them. What a lifelike
	description of the Romish clergy, the true successors of those
	scribes!</p>
