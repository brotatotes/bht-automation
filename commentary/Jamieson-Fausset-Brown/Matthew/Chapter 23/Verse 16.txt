<p><b>16. Woe unto you, ye blind
	guides</b>—Striking expression this of the ruinous effects of
	erroneous teaching. Our Lord, here and in some following verses,
	condemns the subtle distinctions they made as to the sanctity of
	oaths—distinctions invented only to promote their own avaricious
	purposes. 
	</p>
<p><b>which say, Whosoever shall
	swear by the temple, it is nothing</b>—He has incurred no debt. 
	</p>
<p><b>but whosoever shall swear by
	the gold of the temple</b>—meaning not the gold that adorned the
	temple itself, but the <i>Corban,</i> set apart for sacred uses (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:1">Matthew 23:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>he is a debtor!</b>—that
	is, it is no longer his own, even though the necessities of the
	parent might require it. We know who the successors of these men are.
	</p>
<p><b>but whosoever sweareth by the
	gift that is upon it, he is guilty</b>—It should have been
	rendered, "he is a debtor," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:1- :">Matthew 23:1- :</span>.</p>
