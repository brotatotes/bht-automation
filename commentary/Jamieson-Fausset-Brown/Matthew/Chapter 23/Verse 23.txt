<p><b>23. Woe unto you, scribes and
	Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise</b>—rather,
	"dill," as in <i>Margin.</i>
</p>
<p><b>and cummin</b>—In Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) it is "and rue, and all manner of herbs." They
	grounded this practice on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+27:30">Leviticus 27:30</span>,
	which they interpreted rigidly. Our Lord purposely names the most
	trifling products of the earth as examples of what they punctiliously
	exacted the tenth of. 
	</p>
<p><b>and have omitted the
	weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith</b>—In
	Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:42">Luke 11:42</span>) it is
	"judgment, mercy, and the love of God"—the expression
	being probably varied by our Lord Himself on the two different
	occasions. In both His reference is to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:42- :">Luke 11:42- :</span>, where the prophet makes all acceptable religion to consist
	of three elements—"doing justly, loving mercy, and walking
	humbly with our God"; which third element presupposes and
	comprehends both the "faith" of Matthew and the "love"
	of Luke. See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:42- :">Luke 11:42- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:42- :">Luke 11:42- :</span>. The same tendency to merge greater duties in less
	besets even the children of God; but <i>it is the characteristic of
	hypocrites.</i>
</p>
<p><b>these ought ye to have done,
	and not to leave the other undone</b>—There is no need for one set
	of duties to jostle out another; but it is to be carefully noted that
	of the <i>greater</i> duties our Lord says, "Ye ought to have
	done" them, while of the <i>lesser</i> He merely says, "Ye
	ought not to leave them undone."</p>
