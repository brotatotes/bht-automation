<p><b>24. Ye blind guides, which strain at
	a gnat</b>—The proper rendering—as in the older English
	translations, and perhaps our own as it came from the translators'
	hands—evidently is, "strain out." It was the custom, says
	TRENCH, of the stricter
	Jews to strain their wine, vinegar, and other potables through linen
	or gauze, lest unawares they should drink down some little unclean
	insect therein and thus transgress (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+11:20">Leviticus 11:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+11:23">Leviticus 11:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+11:41">Leviticus 11:41</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+11:42">Leviticus 11:42</span>) —just as the
	Buddhists do now in Ceylon and Hindustan—and to this custom of
	theirs our Lord here refers.

<p><b>and swallow a camel</b>—the
	largest animal the Jews knew, as the "gnat" was the
	smallest; both were by the law <i>unclean.</i></p>
