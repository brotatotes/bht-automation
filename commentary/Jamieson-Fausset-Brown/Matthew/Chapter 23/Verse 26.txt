<p><b>26. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse
	first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of
	them may be clean also</b>—In Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) it is, "Ye fools, did not He that made that which is
	without make that which is within also?"—"He to whom
	belongs the outer life, and of right demands its subjection to
	Himself, is the inner man less His?" A remarkable example this
	of our Lord's power of drawing the most striking illustrations of
	great truths from the most familiar objects and incidents in life. To
	these words, recorded by Luke, He adds the following, involving a
	principle of immense value: "But rather give alms of such things
	as ye have, and behold, all things are clean unto you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). As the greed of these hypocrites was one of the most
	prominent features of their character (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), our Lord bids them exemplify the opposite character, and
	then their <i>outside,</i> ruled by this, would be beautiful in the
	eye of God, and their meals would be eaten with clean hands, though
	much fouled with the business of this everyday world. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
