<p><b>3. All therefore</b>—that is, all
	which, as <i>sitting in that seat</i> and teaching <i>out of that
	law.</i>
</p>
<p><b>they bid you observe, that
	observe and do</b>—The word "therefore" is thus, it will
	be seen, of great importance, as limiting those injunctions which He
	would have them obey to what they fetched from the law itself. In
	requiring implicit obedience to such injunctions, He would have them
	to recognize the authority with which they taught over and above the
	obligations of the law itself—an important principle truly; but He
	who denounced the traditions of such teachers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) cannot have meant here to throw His shield over these. It
	is remarked by WEBSTER and
	WILKINSON that the warning
	to <i>beware</i> of the scribes is given by Mark and Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+12:38">Mark 12:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+20:46">Luke 20:46</span>) without any
	qualification: the charge to <i>respect</i> and <i>obey</i> them
	being reported by Matthew alone, indicating for whom this Gospel was
	especially written, and the writer's desire to conciliate the Jews.</p>
