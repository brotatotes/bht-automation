<p><b>34. Wherefore, behold, I send unto
	you prophets, and wise men, and scribes</b>—The <i>I</i> here is
	emphatic: "I am sending," that is, "am about to send."
	In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:49">Luke 11:49</span> the variation is
	remarkable: "Therefore also, said the wisdom of God, I will send
	them," c. What precisely is meant by "the wisdom of God"
	here, is somewhat difficult to determine. To us it appears to be
	simply an announcement of a purpose of the Divine Wisdom, in the high
	style of ancient prophecy, to send a last set of messengers whom the
	people would reject, and rejecting, would fill up the cup of their
	iniquity. But, whereas in Luke it is "I, the Wisdom of God, will
	send them," in Matthew it is "I, Jesus, am sending them"
	language only befitting the one sender of all the prophets, the Lord
	God of Israel now in the flesh. They are evidently evangelical
	messengers, but called by the familiar Jewish names of "prophets,
	wise men, and scribes," whose counterparts were the inspired and
	gifted servants of the Lord Jesus; for in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:49- :">Luke 11:49- :</span>) it is "prophets and apostles."

<p><b>unto the blood of Zacharias
	son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar</b>—As
	there is no record of any fresh murder answering to this description,
	probably the allusion is not to any recent murder, but to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+11:49- :">Luke 11:49- :</span>, as the <i>last recorded</i> and most suitable case for
	illustration. And as Zacharias' last words were, "The Lord
	<i>require it,</i>" so they are here warned that of that
	generation it should be <i>required.</i></p>
