36. Verily I say unto you, All these
	things shall come upon this generationâ€”As it was only in the
	last generation of them that "the iniquity of the Amorites was
	full" (Genesis 15:16), and then
	the abominations of ages were at once completely and awfully avenged,
	so the iniquity of Israel was allowed to accumulate from age to age
	till in that generation it came to the full, and the whole collected
	vengeance of heaven broke at once over its devoted head. In the first
	French Revolution the same awful principle was exemplified, and
	Christendom has not done with it yet.
Lamentation over Jerusalem, and
	Farewell to the Temple (Genesis 15:16- :).
