<p><b>37. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou
	that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee,</b>
	c.—How ineffably grand and melting is this apostrophe! It is the
	very heart of God pouring itself forth through human flesh and
	speech. It is this incarnation of the innermost life and love of
	Deity, pleading with men, bleeding for them, and ascending only to
	open His arms to them and win them back by the power of this story of
	matchless love, that has conquered the world, that will yet "draw
	all men unto Him," and beautify and ennoble Humanity itself!
	"Jerusalem" here does not mean the mere city or its
	inhabitants nor is it to be viewed merely as the metropolis of the
	<i>nation,</i> but as the <i>center of their religious life</i>—"the
	city of their solemnities, whither the tribes went up, to give thanks
	unto the name of the Lord"; and at this moment it was full of
	them. It is the whole family of God, then, which is here
	apostrophized by a name dear to every Jew, recalling to him all that
	was distinctive and precious in his religion. The intense feeling
	that sought vent in this utterance comes out first in the redoubling
	of the opening word—"Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" but, next, in
	the picture of it which He draws—"that killest the prophets,
	and stonest them which are sent unto thee!"—not content with
	spurning God's messages of mercy, that canst not suffer even the
	messengers to live! When He adds, "How often would I have
	gathered thee!" He refers surely to something beyond the six or
	seven times that He visited and taught in Jerusalem while on earth.
	No doubt it points to "the prophets," whom they "killed,"
	to "them that were sent unto her," whom they "stoned."
	But whom would He have gathered so often? "Thee,"
	truth-hating, mercy-spurning, prophet-killing Jerusalem—how often
	would I have gathered <i>thee!</i> Compare with this that affecting
	clause in the great ministerial commission, "that repentance and
	remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations,
	<i>beginning at Jerusalem!</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). What encouragement to the heartbroken at their own
	long-continued and obstinate rebellion! But we have not yet got at
	the whole heart of this outburst. I would have gathered thee, He
	says, "even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings."
	Was ever imagery so homely invested with such grace and such
	sublimity as this, at our Lord's touch? And yet how exquisite the
	figure itself—of protection, rest, warmth, and all manner of
	conscious well-being in those poor, defenseless, dependent little
	creatures, as they creep under and feel themselves overshadowed by
	the capacious and kindly wing of the mother bird! If, wandering
	beyond hearing of her peculiar call, they are overtaken by a storm or
	attacked by an enemy, what can they do but in the one case droop and
	die, and in the other submit to be torn in pieces? But if they can
	reach in time their place of safety, under the mother's wing, in vain
	will any enemy try to drag them thence. For rising into strength,
	kindling into fury, and forgetting herself entirely in her young, she
	will let the last drop of her blood be shed out and perish in defense
	of her precious charge, rather than yield them to an enemy's talons.
	How significant all this of what Jesus is and does for men! Under His
	great Mediatorial wing would He have "gathered" Israel. For
	the figure, see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+32:10-12">Deuteronomy 32:10-12</span>;

	The ancient rabbins had a beautiful expression for proselytes from
	the heathen—that they had "come under the wings of the
	Shekinah." For this last word, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+4:2- :">Malachi 4:2- :</span>. But what was the result of all this tender and mighty
	love? The answer is, "And ye would not." O mysterious word!
	mysterious the resistance of such patient Love—mysterious the
	liberty of self-undoing! The awful dignity of the <i>will,</i> as
	here expressed, might make the ears to tingle.</p>
