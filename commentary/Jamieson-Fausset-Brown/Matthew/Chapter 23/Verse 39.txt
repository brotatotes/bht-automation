39. For I say unto you—and
	these were His last words to the impenitent nation, see on  :-, opening remarks. 
	Ye shall not see me
	henceforth—What? Does Jesus mean that He was Himself the Lord
	of the temple, and that it became "deserted" when HE
	finally left it? It is even so. Now is thy fate sealed, O Jerusalem,
	for the glory is departed from thee! That glory, once visible in the
	holy of holies, over the mercy seat, when on the day of atonement the
	blood of typical expiation was sprinkled on it and in front of
	it—called by the Jews the Shekinah, or the Dwelling,
	as being the visible pavilion of Jehovah—that glory, which Isaiah
	(Isaiah 6:1-13) saw in
	vision, the beloved disciple says was the glory of Christ (Isaiah 6:1-23.6.13- :). Though it was never visible in the second temple, Haggai
	foretold that "the glory of that latter house should be
	greater than of the former" (Isaiah 6:1-23.6.13- :) because "the Lord whom they sought was suddenly to come
	to His temple" (Malachi 3:1),
	not in a mere bright cloud, but enshrined in living humanity! Yet
	brief as well as "sudden" was the manifestation to be: for
	the words He was now uttering were to be HIS
	VERY LAST within its precincts. 
	till ye shall say, Blessed is
	he that cometh in the name of the Lord—that is, till those
	"Hosannas to the Son of David" with which the multitude had
	welcomed Him into the city—instead of "sore displeasing the
	chief priests and scribes" (Malachi 3:1- :) —should break forth from the whole nation, as their glad
	acclaim to their once pierced, but now acknowledged, Messiah. That
	such a time will come is clear from Zechariah 12:10;
	Romans 11:26; 2 Corinthians 3:15;
	2 Corinthians 3:16, c. In what sense they
	shall then "see Him" may be gathered from Zechariah 2:10-13
Ezekiel 37:23-28; Ezekiel 39:28;
	Ezekiel 39:29, &c.
