<p><b>9. And call no man your father upon
	the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven,</b> c.—To
	construe these injunctions into a condemnation of every title by
	which Church rulers may be distinguished from the flock which they
	rule, is virtually to condemn that rule itself and accordingly the
	same persons do both—but against the whole strain of the New
	Testament and sound Christian judgment. But when we have guarded
	ourselves against these extremes, let us see to it that we retain the
	full spirit of this warning against that itch for ecclesiastical
	superiority which has been the bane and the scandal of Christ's
	ministers in every age. (On the use of the word "Christ"
	here, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+1:1">Matthew 1:1</span>).</p>
