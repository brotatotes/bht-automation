<p><b>1. Then</b>—at the time referred
	to at the close of the preceding chapter, the time of the Lord's
	Second Coming to reward His faithful servants and take vengeance on
	the faithless. <i>Then</i>
</p>
<p><b>shall the kingdom of heaven
	be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth
	to meet the bridegroom</b>—This supplies a key to the parable,
	whose object is, in the main, the same as that of the last parable—to
	illustrate <i>the vigilant and expectant attitude of faith,</i> in
	respect of which believers are described as "they that look for
	Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span>), and "love
	His appearing" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>).
	In the last parable it was that of servants waiting for their absent
	Lord; in this it is that of virgin attendants on a Bride, whose duty
	it was to go forth at night with lamps, and be ready on the
	appearance of the Bridegroom to conduct the Bride to his house, and
	go in with him to the marriage. This entire and beautiful change of
	figure brings out the lesson of the former parable in quite a new
	light. But let it be observed that, just as in the parable of the
	Marriage Supper (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8- :">2 Timothy 4:8- :</span>), so in this—the <i>Bride</i> does not come into view
	at all in this parable; the <i>Virgins</i> and the <i>Bridegroom</i>
	holding forth all the intended instruction: nor could believers be
	represented both as Bride and Bridal Attendants without incongruity.</p>
