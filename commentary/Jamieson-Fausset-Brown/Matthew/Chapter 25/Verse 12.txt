<p><b>12. But he answered and said, Verily
	I say unto you, I know you not</b>—The attempt to establish a
	difference between "I know you not" here, and "I never
	knew you" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23">Matthew 7:23</span> —as
	if this were gentler, and so implied a milder fate, reserved for "the
	foolish" of this parable—is to be resisted, though advocated
	by such critics as OLSHAUSEN,
	STIER, and ALFORD.
	Besides being inconsistent with the general tenor of such language,
	and particularly the solemn moral of the whole (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23- :">Matthew 7:23- :</span>), it is a <i>kind</i> of criticism which tampers with some
	of the most awful warnings regarding the future. If it be asked why
	unworthy guests were admitted to the marriage of the King's Son, in a
	former parable, and the foolish virgins are excluded in this one, we
	may answer, in the admirable words of GERHARD,
	quoted by TRENCH, that
	those festivities are celebrated in this life, in the Church
	militant; these at the last day, in the Church triumphant; to those,
	even they are admitted who are not adorned with the wedding garment;
	but to these, only they to whom it is granted to be arrayed in fine
	linen clean and white, which is the righteousness of saints (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:23- :">Matthew 7:23- :</span>); to those, men are called by the trumpet of the Gospel; to
	these by the trumpet of the Archangel; to those, who enters may go
	out from them, or be cast out; who is once introduced to these never
	goes out, nor is cast out, from them any more: wherefore it is said,
	"The door is shut."</p>
