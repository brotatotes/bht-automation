	</p>
<p>This parable, while closely
	resembling it, is yet a different one from that of THE
	POUNDS, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; though CALVIN,
	OLSHAUSEN, MEYER,
	and others identify them—but not DE
	WETTE and NEANDER.
	For the difference between the two parables, see the <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> on that of The Pounds. While, as TRENCH
	observes with his usual felicity, "the virgins were represented
	as <i>waiting</i> for their Lord, we have the servants <i>working</i>
	for Him; there the <i>inward spiritual life</i> of the faithful was
	described; here his <i>external activity.</i> It is not, therefore,
	without good reason that they appear in their actual order—that of
	the Virgins first, and of the Talents following—since it is the
	sole condition of a profitable outward activity for the kingdom of
	God, that the life of God be diligently maintained within the heart."</p>
