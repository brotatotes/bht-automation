<p><b>2. And five of them were wise, and
	five were foolish</b>—They are not distinguished into good and bad,
	as TRENCH observes, but
	into "wise" and "foolish"—just as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> those who reared their house for eternity are
	distinguished into "wise" and "foolish builders";
	because in both cases a certain degree of goodwill towards the truth
	is assumed. To make anything of the equal number of both classes
	would, we think, be precarious, save to warn us how large a portion
	of those who, up to the last, so nearly resemble those that love
	Christ's appearing will be disowned by Him when He comes.</p>
