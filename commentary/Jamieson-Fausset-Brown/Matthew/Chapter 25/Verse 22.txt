<p><b>22. He also that had received two
	talents came . . . good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful
	over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things</b>—<i>Both
	are commended in the same terms, and the reward of both is precisely
	the same.</i> (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:2">Matthew 25:2</span>).
	Observe also the contrasts: "Thou hast been faithful as a
	<i>servant;</i> now be a <i>ruler</i>—thou hast been <i>entrusted</i>
	with a <i>few</i> things; now have <i>dominion</i> over <i>many</i>
	things." 
	</p>
<p><b>enter thou into the joy of
	thy lord</b>—thy Lord's own joy. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+15:11">John 15:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:2">Hebrews 12:2</span>).</p>
