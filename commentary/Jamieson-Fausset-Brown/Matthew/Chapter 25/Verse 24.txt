	one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard
	man—harsh. The word in Luke ( :-) is "austere." 
	reaping where thou hast not
	sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed—The sense is
	obvious: "I knew thou wast one whom it was impossible to serve,
	one whom nothing would please: exacting what was impracticable, and
	dissatisfied with what was attainable." Thus do men secretly
	think of God as a hard Master, and virtually throw on Him the blame
	of their fruitlessness.
