25. And I was afraid—of making
	matters worse by meddling with it at all. 
	and went and hid thy talent
	in the earth—This depicts the conduct of all those who shut up
	their gifts from the active service of Christ, without actually
	prostituting them to unworthy uses. Fitly, therefore, may it, at
	least, comprehend those, to whom TRENCH
	refers, who, in the early Church, pleaded that they had enough to do
	with their own souls, and were afraid of losing them in trying to
	save others; and so, instead of being the salt of the earth, thought
	rather of keeping their own saltness by withdrawing sometimes into
	caves and wildernesses, from all those active ministries of love by
	which they might have served their brethren. 
	Thou wicked and slothful
	servant—"Wicked" or "bad" means
	"falsehearted," as opposed to the others, who are
	emphatically styled "good servants." The addition of
	"slothful" is to mark the precise nature of his wickedness:
	it consisted, it seems, not in his doing anything against, but
	simply nothing for his master. 
	Thou knewest that I reap
	where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed—He takes
	the servant's own account of his demands, as expressing graphically
	enough, not the hardness which he had basely imputed to him,
	but simply his demand of a profitable return for the gift
	entrusted.
