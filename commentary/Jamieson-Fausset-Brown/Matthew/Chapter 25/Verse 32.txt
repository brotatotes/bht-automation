<p><b>32. And before him shall be gathered
	all nations</b>—or, "all the nations." That this should
	be understood to mean the <i>heathen nations,</i> or all <i>except</i>
	believers in Christ, will seem amazing to any simple reader. Yet this
	is the exposition of OLSHAUSEN,
	STIER, KEIL,
	ALFORD (though latterly
	with some diffidence), and of a number, though not all, of those who
	hold that Christ will come the second time before the millennium, and
	that the saints will be caught up to meet Him in the air before His
	appearing. Their chief argument is, the impossibility of any that
	ever knew the Lord Jesus wondering, at the Judgment Day, that they
	should be thought to have done—or left undone—anything "unto
	Christ." To that we shall advert when we come to it. But here we
	may just say, that if this scene does not describe a personal,
	public, final judgment on men, according to the treatment they have
	given to Christ—and consequently men within the Christian pale—we
	shall have to consider again whether our Lord's teaching on the
	greatest themes of human interest does indeed possess that
	incomparable simplicity and transparency of meaning which, by
	universal consent, has been ascribed to it. If it be said, But how
	can this be the general judgment, if only those within the Christian
	pale be embraced by it?—we answer, What is here described, as it
	certainly does not meet the case of all the family of Adam, is of
	course <i>so far</i> not general. But we have no right to conclude
	that the whole "judgment of the great day" will be limited
	to the point of view here presented. Other explanations will come up
	in the course of our exposition.
