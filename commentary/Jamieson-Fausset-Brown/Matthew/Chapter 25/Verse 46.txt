<p><b>46. And these shall go away</b>—these
	"cursed" ones. Sentence, it should seem, was first
	<i>pronounced</i>—in the hearing of the wicked—upon the
	<i>righteous,</i> who thereupon sit as assessors in the judgment upon
	the wicked (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:2">1 Corinthians 6:2</span>); but
	sentence is first <i>executed,</i> it should seem, upon the <i>wicked,</i>
	in the sight of the righteous—whose glory will thus not be beheld
	by the wicked, while <i>their</i> descent into "their own place"
	will be witnessed by the righteous, as BENGEL
	notes. 
	</p>
<p><b>into everlasting
	punishment</b>—or, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:2- :">1 Corinthians 6:2- :</span>, "everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
	angels." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:42">Matthew 13:42</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+1:9">2 Thessalonians 1:9</span>, &amp;c. This is said to
	be "prepared for the devil and his angels," because they
	were "first in transgression." But both have one doom,
	because one unholy character. 
	</p>
<p><b>but the righteous into life
	eternal</b>—that is, "life everlasting." The word in both
	clauses, being in the original the same, should have been the same in
	the translation also. Thus the decisions of this awful day will be
	final, irreversible, unending.</p>
