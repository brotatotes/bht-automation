<p><b>5. While the bridegroom tarried</b>—So
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:48">Matthew 24:48</span>, "My Lord
	delayeth His coming"; and so Peter says sublimely of the
	ascended Saviour, "Whom the heaven must receive until the times
	of restitution of all things" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:48- :">Matthew 24:48- :</span>, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:11">Luke 19:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:12">Luke 19:12</span>). Christ "tarries,"
	among other reasons, to try the faith and patience of His people.

<p><b>they all slumbered and
	slept</b>—the wise as well as the foolish. The world "slumbered"
	signifies, simply, "nodded," or, "became drowsy";
	while the world "slept" is the usual word for lying down to
	sleep, denoting two stages of spiritual declension—first, that
	half-involuntary lethargy or drowsiness which is apt to steal over
	one who falls into inactivity; and then a conscious, deliberate
	yielding to it, after a little vain resistance. Such was the state
	alike of the wise and the foolish virgins, even till the cry of the
	Bridegroom's approach awoke them. So likewise in the parable of the
	Importunate Widow: "When the Son of man cometh, shall He find
	faith on the earth?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+19:12- :">Luke 19:12- :</span>).</p>
