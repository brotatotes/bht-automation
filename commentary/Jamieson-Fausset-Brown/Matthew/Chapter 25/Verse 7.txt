<p><b>7. Then all those virgins arose, and
	trimmed their lamps</b>—the foolish virgins as well as the wise.
	How very long do both parties seem the same—almost to the moment of
	decision! Looking at the mere form of the parable, it is evident that
	the folly of "the foolish" consisted not in having no oil
	at all; for they must have had oil enough in their lamps to keep them
	burning up to this moment: their folly consisted in not making
	provision against its <i>exhaustion,</i> by taking with their lamp an
	<i>oil-vessel</i> wherewith to replenish their lamp from time to
	time, and so have it burning until the Bridegroom should come. Are
	we, then—with some even superior expositors—to conclude that the
	foolish virgins must represent true Christians as well as do the
	wise, since only true Christians have the Spirit, and that the
	difference between the two classes consists only in the one having
	the necessary watchfulness which the other wants? Certainly not.
	Since the parable was designed to hold forth the prepared and the
	unprepared to meet Christ at His coming, and how the unprepared
	might, up to the very last, be confounded with the prepared—the
	structure of the parable behooved to accommodate itself to this, by
	making the lamps of the foolish to burn, as well as those of the
	wise, up to a certain point of time, and only then to discover their
	inability to burn on for want of a fresh supply of oil. But this is
	evidently just a <i>structural device;</i> and the real difference
	between the two classes who profess to love the Lord's appearing is a
	<i>radical one</i>—the possession by the one class of <i>an
	enduring principle of spiritual life,</i> and the want of it by the
	other.</p>
