<p><b>4. Saying, I have sinned in that I
	have betrayed the innocent blood</b>—What a testimony this to
	Jesus! Judas had been with Him in all circumstances for three years;
	his post, as treasurer to Him and the Twelve (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), gave him peculiar opportunity of watching the spirit,
	disposition, and habits of his Master; while his covetous nature and
	thievish practices would incline him to dark and suspicious, rather
	than frank and generous, interpretations of all that He said and did.
	If, then, he could have fastened on one questionable feature in all
	that he had so long witnessed, we may be sure that no such speech as
	this would ever have escaped his lips, nor would he have been so
	stung with remorse as not to be able to keep the money and survive
	his crime. 
	</p>
<p><b>And they said, What is that
	to us? see thou to that</b>—"Guilty or innocent is nothing to
	us: We have Him now—begone!" Was ever speech more hellish
	uttered?</p>
