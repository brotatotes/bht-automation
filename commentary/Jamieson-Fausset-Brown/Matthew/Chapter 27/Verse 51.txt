<p><b>and the rocks rent</b>—"were
	rent"—the physical creation thus sublimely proclaiming, at the
	bidding of its Maker, the <i>concussion</i> which at that moment was
	taking place in the moral world at the most critical moment of its
	history. Extraordinary rents and fissures have been observed in the
	rocks near this spot.</p>
