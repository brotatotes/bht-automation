<p><b>62. Now the next day, that followed
	the day of the preparation</b>â€”that is, after six o'clock of our
	<i>Saturday</i> evening. The crucifixion took place on the <i>Friday</i>
	and all was not over till shortly before sunset, when the Jewish
	sabbath commenced; and "that sabbath day was an high day"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+19:31">John 19:31</span>), being the first
	day of the feast of unleavened bread. That day being over at six on
	Saturday evening, they hastened to take their measures.</p>
