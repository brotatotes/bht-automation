<p><b>65. Pilate said unto them, Ye have a
	watch</b>—The guards had already acted under orders of the
	Sanhedrim, with Pilate's consent; but probably they were not clear
	about employing them as a night watch without Pilate's express
	authority.

<p><b>go your way, make it as sure
	as ye can</b>—as ye know how, or in the way ye deem securest.
	Though there may be no irony in this speech, it evidently insinuated
	that <i>if</i> the event should be contrary to their wish, it would
	not be for want of sufficient human appliances to prevent it.</p>
