<p><b>66. So they went, and made the
	sepulchre sure, sealing the stone</b>—which Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) says was "very great." 
	</p>
<p><b>and setting a watch</b>—to
	guard it. What more could man do? But while they are trying to
	prevent the resurrection of the Prince of Life, God makes use of
	their precautions for His own ends. Their stone-covered, seal-secured
	sepulchre shall preserve the sleeping dust of the Son of God free
	from all indignities, in undisturbed, sublime repose; while their
	watch shall be His guard of honor until the angels shall come to take
	their place.</p>
