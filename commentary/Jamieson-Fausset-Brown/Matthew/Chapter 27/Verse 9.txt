<p><b>9. Then was fulfilled that which was

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+11:13">Zechariah 11:13</span>). Never was a
	complicated prophecy, otherwise hopelessly dark, more marvellously
	fulfilled. Various conjectures have been formed to account for
	Matthew's ascribing to Jeremiah a prophecy found in the book of
	Zechariah. But since with this book he was plainly familiar, having
	quoted one of its most remarkable prophecies of Christ but a few
	chapters before (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:4">Matthew 21:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:5">Matthew 21:5</span>), the question is one
	more of critical interest than real importance. Perhaps the true
	explanation is the following, from LIGHTFOOT:
	"Jeremiah of old had the first place among the prophets, and
	hereby he comes to be mentioned above all the rest in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:5- :">Matthew 21:5- :</span>; because he stood first in the volume of the prophets (as
	he proves from the learned DAVID
	KIMCHI) therefore he is
	first named. When, therefore, Matthew produceth a text of Zechariah
	under the name of Jeremy, he only cites the words of the volume of
	the prophets under his name who stood first in the volume of the
	prophets. Of which sort is that also of our Saviour (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:5- :">Matthew 21:5- :</span>), 'All things must be fulfilled which are written of Me in
	the Law, and the Prophets, and the Psalms,' or the Book of
	Hagiographa, in which the Psalms were placed first."
