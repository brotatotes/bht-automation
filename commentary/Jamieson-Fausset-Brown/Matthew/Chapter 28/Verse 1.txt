<p><b>1. In the end of the sabbath, as it
	began to dawn</b>—after the Sabbath, as it grew toward daylight. 
	</p>
<p><b>toward the first day of the
	week</b>—Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:1">Luke 24:1</span>) has
	it, "very early in the morning"—properly, "at the
	first appearance of daybreak"; and corresponding with this, John
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1">John 20:1</span>) says, "when it
	was yet dark." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1- :">John 20:1- :</span>.
	Not an hour, it would seem, was lost by those dear lovers of the Lord
	Jesus. 
	</p>
<p><b>came Mary Magdalene, and the
	other Mary</b>—"the mother of James and Joses" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:1- :">John 20:1- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:2">Matthew 28:2</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>to see the sepulchre</b>—with
	a view to the anointing of the body, for which they had made all
	their preparations. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+28:2- :">Matthew 28:2- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>And, behold, there was</b>—that
	is, there had been, before the arrival of the women. 
	</p>
<p><b>a great earthquake; for the
	angel of the Lord descended from heaven,</b> c.—And this was the
	state of things when the women drew near. Some judicious critics
	think all this was transacted while the women were approaching but
	the view we have given, which is the prevalent one, seems the more
	natural. All this august preparation—recorded by Matthew
	alone—bespoke the grandeur of the exit which was to follow. The
	angel sat upon the huge stone, to overawe, with the lightning-luster
	that darted from him, the Roman guard, and do honor to his rising
	Lord.</p>
