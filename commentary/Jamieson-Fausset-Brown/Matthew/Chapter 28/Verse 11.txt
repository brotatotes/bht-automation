	that such a tale as ye had to tell would not at once commend itself
	to your scared employers? Had they doubted this for a moment, would
	they have ventured to go near them, knowing it was death to a Roman
	soldier to be proved asleep when on guard? and of course that was the
	only other explanation of the case.</p>
