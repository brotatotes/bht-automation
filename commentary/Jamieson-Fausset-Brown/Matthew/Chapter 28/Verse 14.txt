<p><b>14. And if this come to the
	governor's ears</b>—rather, "If this come before the
	governor"; that is, not in the way of mere report, but for
	judicial investigation. 
	</p>
<p><b>we will persuade him, and
	secure you</b>—The "we" and the "you" are
	emphatic here—"we shall [take care to] persuade him and keep
	you from trouble," or "save you harmless." The
	grammatical form of this clause implies that the thing supposed was
	expected to happen. The meaning then is, "If this come before
	the governor—as it likely will—we shall see to it that," &amp;c.
	The "persuasion" of Pilate meant, doubtless, quieting him
	by a bribe, which we know otherwise he was by no means above taking
	(like Felix afterwards, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+24:26">Acts 24:26</span>).</p>
