<p><b>5. And the angel answered and said
	unto the women, Fear not ye</b>—The "ye" here is
	emphatic, to contrast their case with that of the guards. "Let
	those puny creatures, sent to keep the Living One among the dead, for
	fear of Me shake and become as dead men (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); but ye that have come hither on another errand, fear not
	ye." 
	</p>
<p><b>for I know that ye seek
	Jesus, which was crucified</b>—Jesus the Crucified.</p>
