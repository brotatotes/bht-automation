<p><b>therefore every tree which
	bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the
	fire</b>—Language so personal and individual as this can scarcely
	be understood of any national judgment like the approaching
	destruction of Jerusalem, with the breaking up of the Jewish polity
	and the extrusion of the chosen people from their peculiar privileges
	which followed it; though this would serve as the dark shadow, cast
	before, of a more terrible retribution to come. The "fire,"
	which in another verse is called "unquenchable," can be no
	other than that future "torment" of the impenitent whose
	"smoke ascendeth up for ever and ever," and which by the
	Judge Himself is styled "everlasting punishment" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). What a strength, too, of just indignation is in that word
	"cast" or "flung into the fire!"

	We may take this, say WEBSTER
	and WILKINSON, as a
	warning against mutiny, which the officers attempted to suppress by
	largesses and donations. And thus the "fruits" which would
	evidence their repentance were just resistance to the reigning
	sins—particularly of the <i>class</i> to which the penitent
	belonged—and the manifestation of an opposite spirit.
