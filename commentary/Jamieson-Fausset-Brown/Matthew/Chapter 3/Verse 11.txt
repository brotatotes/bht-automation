11. I indeed baptize you with water
	unto repentance—(See on  :-); 
	but he that cometh after me
	is mightier than I—In Mark and Luke this is more emphatic—"But
	there cometh the Mightier than I" (Mark 1:7;
	Luke 3:16). 
	whose shoes—sandals. 
	I am not worthy to bear—The
	sandals were tied and untied, and borne about by the meanest
	servants. 
	he shall baptize you—the
	emphatic "He": "He it is," to the exclusion of
	all others, "that shall baptize you." 
	with the Holy Ghost—"So
	far from entertaining such a thought as laying claim to the honors of
	Messiahship, the meanest services I can render to that 'Mightier than
	I that is coming after me' are too high an honor for me; I am but the
	servant, but the Master is coming; I administer but the outward
	symbol of purification; His it is, as His sole prerogative, to
	dispense the inward reality." Beautiful spirit, distinguishing
	this servant of Christ throughout! 
	and with fire—To take
	this as a distinct baptism from that of the Spirit—a baptism of the
	impenitent with hell-fire—is exceedingly unnatural. Yet this was
	the view of ORIGEN among
	the Fathers; and among moderns, of NEANDER,
	MEYER, DE
	WETTE, and LANGE.
	Nor is it much better to refer it to the fire of the great day, by
	which the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
	Clearly, as we think, it is but the fiery character of the
	Spirit's operations upon the soul—searching, consuming, refining,
	sublimating—as nearly all good interpreters understand the words.
	And thus, in two successive clauses, the two most familiar
	emblems—water and fire—are employed to set forth
	the same purifying operations of the Holy Ghost upon the soul.
