13. Then cometh Jesus from Galilee
	to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him—Moses rashly
	anticipated the divine call to deliver his people, and for this was
	fain to flee the house of bondage, and wait in obscurity for forty
	years more (Exodus 2:11, c.). Not so
	this greater than Moses. All but thirty years had He now spent in
	privacy at Nazareth, gradually ripening for His public work, and
	calmly awaiting the time appointed of the Father. Now it had arrived
	and this movement from Galilee to Jordan is the step, doubtless, of
	deepest interest to all heaven since that first one which brought Him
	into the world. Luke (Luke 3:21)
	has this important addition—"Now when all the people were
	baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus being baptized,"
	&c.—implying that Jesus waited till all other applicants for
	baptism that day had been disposed of, ere He stepped forward, that
	He might not seem to be merely one of the crowd. Thus, as He rode
	into Jerusalem upon an ass "whereon yet never man sat" (Luke 3:21- :), and lay in a sepulchre "wherein was never man yet
	laid" (John 19:41), so in
	His baptism, too. He would be "separate from sinners."
