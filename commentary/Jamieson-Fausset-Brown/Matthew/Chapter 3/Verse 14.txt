14. But John forbade him—rather,
	"was (in the act of) hindering him," or "attempting to
	hinder him." 
	saying, I have need to be
	baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?—(How John came to
	recognize Him, when he says he knew Him not, see on  :-.) The emphasis of this most remarkable speech lies all
	in the pronouns: "What! Shall the Master come for baptism to the
	servant—the sinless Saviour to a sinner?" That thus much is in
	the Baptist's words will be clearly seen if it be observed that he
	evidently regarded Jesus as Himself needing no purification
	but rather qualified to impart it to those who did. And do not
	all his other testimonies to Christ fully bear out this sense of the
	words? But it were a pity if, in the glory of this testimony to
	Christ, we should miss the beautiful spirit in which it was
	borne—"Lord, must I baptize Thee? Can I bring
	myself to do such a thing?"—reminding us of Peter's
	exclamation at the supper table, "Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?"
	while it has nothing of the false humility and presumption which
	dictated Peter's next speech. "Thou shalt never wash my feet"
	(John 13:6; John 13:8).
