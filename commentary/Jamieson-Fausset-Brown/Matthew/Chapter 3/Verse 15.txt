<p><b>15. And Jesus answering said unto
	him, Suffer it to be so now</b>—"Let it pass for the present";
	that is, "Thou recoilest, and no wonder, for the seeming
	incongruity is startling; but in the present case do as thou art
	bidden." 
	</p>
<p><b>for thus it becometh us</b>—"us,"
	not in the sense of "me and thee," or "men in
	general," but as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:11">John 3:11</span>.
	</p>
<p><b>to fulfil all
	righteousness</b>—If this be rendered, with SCRIVENER,
	"every ordinance," or, with CAMPBELL,
	"every institution," the meaning is obvious enough; and the
	same sense is brought out by "all righteousness," or
	compliance with everything enjoined, baptism included. Indeed, if
	this be the meaning, our version perhaps best brings out the force of
	the opening word "Thus." But we incline to think that our
	Lord meant more than this. The import of circumcision and of baptism
	seems to be radically the same. And if our remarks on the
	circumcision of our Lord (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:11- :">John 3:11- :</span>) are well founded, He would seem to have said, "Thus
	do I impledge Myself to the whole righteousness of the Law—thus
	symbolically do enter on and engage to fulfil it all." Let the
	thoughtful reader weigh this. 
	</p>
<p><b>Then he suffered him</b>—with
	true humility, yielding to higher authority than his own impressions
	of propriety.
