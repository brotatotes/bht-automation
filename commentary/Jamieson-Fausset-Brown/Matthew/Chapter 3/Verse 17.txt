<p><b>17. And lo a voice from heaven,
	saying, This is</b>—Mark and Luke give it in the direct form, "Thou
	art." (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:11">Mark 1:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:22">Luke 3:22</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>my beloved Son, in whom I am
	well pleased</b>—The verb is put in the aorist to express absolute
	complacency, once and for ever felt towards Him. The English here, at
	least to modern ears, is scarcely strong enough. "I delight"
	comes the nearest, perhaps, to that ineffable <i>complacency</i>
	which is manifestly intended; and this is the rather to be preferred,
	as it would immediately carry the thoughts back to that august
	Messianic prophecy to which the voice from heaven plainly alluded
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+42:1">Isaiah 42:1</span>), "Behold My
	Servant, whom I uphold; Mine Elect, IN
	WHOM MY SOUL DELIGHTETH."
	Nor are the words which follow to be overlooked, "I have put My
	Spirit upon Him; He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles."
	(The <i>Septuagint</i> perverts this, as it does most of the
	Messianic predictions, interpolating the word "Jacob," and
	applying it to the Jews). Was this voice heard by the by-standers?
	From Matthew's form of it, one might suppose it so designed; but it
	would appear that it was not, and probably John only heard and saw
	anything peculiar about that great baptism. Accordingly, the words,
	"Hear ye Him," are not added, as at the Transfiguration.</p>
