<p><b>2. And saying, Repent ye</b>—Though
	the word strictly denotes a <i>change of mind,</i> it has respect
	here (and wherever it is used in connection with salvation) primarily
	to that <i>sense of sin</i> which leads the sinner to flee from the
	wrath to come, to look for relief only from above, and eagerly to
	fall in with the provided remedy. 
	</p>
<p><b>for the kingdom of heaven is
	at hand</b>—This sublime phrase, used in none of the other Gospels,
	occurs in this peculiarly Jewish Gospel nearly thirty times; and
	being suggested by Daniel's grand vision of the Son of man coming in
	the clouds of heaven to the Ancient of days, to receive His
	investiture in a world-wide kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:14">Daniel 7:14</span>), it was fitted at once
	both to meet the national expectations and to turn them into the
	right channel. A kingdom for which <i>repentance</i> was the proper
	preparation behooved to be essentially spiritual. Deliverance from
	sin, the great blessing of Christ's kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:14- :">Daniel 7:14- :</span>), can be valued by those only to whom sin is a burden (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:14- :">Daniel 7:14- :</span>). John's great work, accordingly, was to awaken this feeling
	and hold out the hope of a speedy and precious remedy.</p>
