3. For this is he that was spoken of
	by the prophet Esaias, saying— ( :-). 
	The voice of one crying in
	the wilderness—(See on  :-);
	the scene of his ministry corresponding to its rough nature. 
	Prepare ye the way of the
	Lord, make his paths straight—This prediction is quoted in all
	the four Gospels, showing that it was regarded as a great outstanding
	one, and the predicted forerunner as the connecting link between the
	old and the new economies. Like the great ones of the earth, the
	Prince of peace was to have His immediate approach proclaimed and His
	way prepared; and the call here—taking it generally—is a call to
	put out of the way whatever would obstruct His progress and hinder
	His complete triumph, whether those hindrances were public or
	personal, outward or inward. In Luke (Luke 3:5;
	Luke 3:6) the quotation is thus
	continued: "Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and
	hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight,
	and the rough ways shall be made smooth; and all flesh shall see the
	salvation of God." Levelling and smoothing are here the obvious
	figures whose sense is conveyed in the first words of the
	proclamation—"Prepare ye the way of the Lord." The
	idea is that every obstruction shall be so removed as to reveal to
	the whole world the salvation of God in Him whose name is the
	"Saviour." (Compare Psalms 98:3;
	Isaiah 11:10; Isaiah 49:6;
	Isaiah 52:10; Luke 2:31;
	Luke 2:32; Acts 13:47).
