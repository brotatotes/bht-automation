<p><b>4. And the same John had his raiment
	of camel's hair</b>—woven of it. 
	</p>
<p><b>and a leathern girdle about
	his loins</b>—the prophetic dress of Elijah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; and see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:4">Zechariah 13:4</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and his meat was locusts</b>—the
	great, well-known Eastern locust, a food of the poor (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:4- :">Zechariah 13:4- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and wild honey</b>—made by
	wild bees (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+14:25">1 Samuel 14:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1sa+14:26">1 Samuel 14:26</span>).
	This dress and diet, with the shrill cry in the wilderness, would
	recall the stern days of Elijah.</p>
