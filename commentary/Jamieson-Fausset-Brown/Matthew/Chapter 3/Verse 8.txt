<p><b>8. Bring forth therefore fruits</b>—the
	true reading clearly is "fruit"; 
	</p>
<p><b>meet for repentance</b>—that
	is, such fruit as <i>befits</i> a true penitent. John now being
	gifted with a knowledge of the human heart, like a true minister of
	righteousness and lover of souls here directs them how to evidence
	and carry out their repentance, supposing it genuine; and in the
	following verses warns them of their danger in case it were not.</p>
