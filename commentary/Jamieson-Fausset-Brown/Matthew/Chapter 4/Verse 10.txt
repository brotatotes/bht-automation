10. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get
	thee hence, Satan—Since the tempter has now thrown off the
	mask, and stands forth in his true character, our Lord no longer
	deals with him as a pretended friend and pious counsellor, but calls
	him by his right name—His knowledge of which from the outset He had
	carefully concealed till now—and orders him off. This is the final
	and conclusive evidence, as we think, that Matthew's must be the
	right order of the temptations. For who can well conceive of the
	tempter's returning to the assault after this, in the pious character
	again, and hoping still to dislodge the consciousness of His Sonship,
	while our Lord must in that case be supposed to quote Scripture to
	one He had called the devil to his face—thus throwing His pearls
	before worse than swine? 
	for it is written— ( :-). Thus does our Lord part with Satan on the rock of
	Scripture. 
	Thou shalt worship—In
	the Hebrew and the Septuagint it is, "Thou shalt
	fear"; but as the sense is the same, so "worship"
	is here used to show emphatically that what the tempter claimed was
	precisely what God had forbidden. 
	the Lord thy God, and him
	only shalt thou serve—The word "serve" in the second
	clause, is one never used by the Septuagint of any but
	religious service; and in this sense exclusively is it used in
	the New Testament, as we find it here. Once more the word "only,"
	in the second clause—not expressed in the Hebrew and the
	Septuagint—is here added to bring out emphatically the
	negative and prohibitory feature of the command. (See
	Galatians 3:10 for a similar
	supplement of the word "all" in a quotation from Galatians 3:10- :).
