<p><b>22. And they immediately left the
	ship and their father</b>—Mark adds an important clause: "They
	left their father Zebedee in the ship with the <i>hired servants</i>"

<p><b>and followed him</b>—Two
	harmonistic questions here arise: <i>First,</i> Was this the same
	calling as that recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:20- :">Mark 1:20- :</span>? Clearly not. For, (1) That call was given while Jesus
	was yet in Judea: this, after His return to Galilee. (2) Here, Christ
	calls Andrew: there, Andrew solicits an interview with Christ. (3)
	Here, Andrew and Peter are called together: there, Andrew having been
	called, with an unnamed disciple, who was clearly the beloved
	disciple (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:20- :">Mark 1:20- :</span>), goes
	and fetches Peter his brother to Christ, who then calls him. (4)
	Here, John is called along with James his brother: there, John is
	called along with Andrew, after having at their own request had an
	interview with Jesus; no mention being made of James, whose call, if
	it then took place, would not likely have been passed over by his own
	brother. Thus far nearly all are agreed. But on the <i>next</i>
	question opinion is divided: Was this the same calling as that
	recorded in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:1-11">Luke 5:1-11</span>?
	Many able critics think so. But the following considerations are to
	us decisive against it. First here, the four are called separately,
	in pairs: in Luke, all together. Next, in Luke, after a glorious
	miracle: here, the one pair are casting their net, the other are
	mending theirs. Further, here, our Lord had made no public appearance
	in Galilee, and so had gathered none around Him; He is walking
	solitary by the shores of the lake when He accosts the two pairs of
	fishermen: in Luke, the multitude are pressing upon Him, and hearing
	the word of God, as He stands by the Lake of Gennesaret—a state of
	things implying a somewhat advanced stage of His early ministry, and
	some popular enthusiasm. Regarding these successive callings, see on
