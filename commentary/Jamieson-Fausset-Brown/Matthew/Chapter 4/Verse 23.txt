<p><b>23. And Jesus went about all
	Galilee, teaching in their synagogues</b>—These were houses of
	local worship. It cannot be proved that they existed before the
	Babylonish captivity; but as they began to be erected soon after it,
	probably the idea was suggested by the religious inconveniences to
	which the captives had been subjected. In our Lord's time, the rule
	was to have one wherever ten learned men or professed students of the
	law resided; and they extended to Syria, Asia Minor, Greece, and most
	places of the dispersion. The larger towns had several, and in
	Jerusalem the number approached five hundred. In point of officers
	and mode of worship, the Christian congregations are modelled after
	the synagogue.
