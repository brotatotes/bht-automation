3. And when the tempter came to
	him—Evidently we have here a new scene. 
	he said, if thou be the Son
	of God, command that these stones be made bread—rather,
	"loaves," answering to "stones" in the plural;
	whereas Luke, having said, "Command this stone," in the
	singular, adds, "that it be made bread," in the singular
	(Luke 4:3). The sensation of
	hunger, unfelt during all the forty days, seems now to have come on
	in all its keenness—no doubt to open a door to the tempter, of
	which he is not slow to avail himself; "Thou still clingest to
	that vainglorious confidence that Thou art the Son of God, carried
	away by those illusory scenes at the Jordan. Thou wast born in a
	stable; but Thou art the Son of God! hurried off to Egypt for fear of
	Herod's wrath; but Thou art the Son of God! a carpenter's roof
	supplied Thee with a home, and in the obscurity of a despicable town
	of Galilee Thou hast spent thirty years, yet still Thou art the Son
	of God! and a voice from heaven, it seems, proclaimed it in Thine
	ears at the Jordan! Be it so; but after that, surely Thy days
	of obscurity and trial should have an end. Why linger for weeks in
	this desert, wandering among the wild beasts and craggy rocks,
	unhonored, unattended, unpitied, ready to starve for want of the
	necessaries of life? Is this befitting "the Son of God?" At
	the bidding of "the Son of God" surely those stones shall
	all be turned into loaves, and in a moment present an abundant
	repast."
