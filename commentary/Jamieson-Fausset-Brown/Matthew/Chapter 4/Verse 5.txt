	the temple, which bristled with golden spikes [JOSEPHUS,
	<i>Antiquities,</i> 5.5,6]; or whether it refers to another peak, on
	Herod's royal portico, overhanging the ravine of Kedron, at the
	valley of Hinnom—an immense tower built on the very edge of this
	precipice, from the top of which dizzy height JOSEPHUS
	says one could not look to the bottom [<i>Antiquities,</i>
	15.11,5]—is not certain; but the latter is probably meant.</p>
