<p><b>6. And saith unto him, If thou be
	the Son of God</b>—As this temptation starts with the same point as
	the first—our Lord's determination not to be disputed out of His
	Sonship—it seems to us clear that the one came directly after the
	other; and as the remaining temptation shows that the hope of
	carrying that point was abandoned, and all was staked upon a
	desperate venture, we think that remaining temptation is thus shown
	to be the last; as will appear still more when we come to it.

<p><b>cast thyself down</b>—"from
	hence" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+4:9">Luke 4:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>for it is written</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+91:11">Psalms 91:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+91:12">Psalms 91:12</span>).
	"But what is this I see?" exclaims stately BISHOP
	HALL. "Satan himself
	with a Bible under his arm and a text in his mouth!" Doubtless
	the tempter, having felt the power of God's Word in the former
	temptation, was eager to try the effect of it from his own mouth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+91:12- :">Psalms 91:12- :</span>).

<p><b>He shall give his angels
	charge concerning thee: and in their hands</b>—rather, "on
	their hands." 
	</p>
<p><b>they shall bear thee up, lest
	at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone</b>—The quotation
	is, precisely as it stands in the <i>Hebrew</i> and the <i>Septuagint,</i>
	save that after the first clause the words, "to keep thee in all
	thy ways," are here omitted. Not a few good expositors have
	thought that this omission was intentional, to conceal the fact that
	this would <i>not</i> have been one of "His ways," that is,
	of duty. But as our Lord's reply makes no allusion to this, but
	seizes on the great principle involved in the promise quoted, so when
	we look at the promise itself, it is plain that the sense of it is
	precisely the same whether the clause in question be inserted or not.</p>
