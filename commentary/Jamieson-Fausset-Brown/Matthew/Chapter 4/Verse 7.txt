<p><b>7. Jesus said unto him, It is
	written again</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+6:16">Deuteronomy 6:16</span>),
	as if he should say, "True, it is so written, and on that
	promise I implicitly rely; but in using it there is another Scripture
	which must not be forgotten." 
	</p>
<p><b>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
	thy God</b>—"Preservation in danger is divinely pledged: shall
	I then <i>create</i> danger, either to put the promised security
	skeptically to the proof, or wantonly to demand a display of it? That
	were 'to tempt the Lord my God,' which, being expressly forbidden,
	would forfeit the right to expect preservation."</p>
