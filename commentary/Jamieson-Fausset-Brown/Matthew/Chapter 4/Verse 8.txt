8. Again, the devil taketh him
	up—"conducteth him," as before. 
	into—or "unto"
	an exceeding high mountain,
	and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
	them—Luke (Luke 4:5) adds
	the important clause, "in a moment of time"; a clause which
	seems to furnish a key to the true meaning. That a scene was
	presented to our Lord's natural eye seems plainly expressed. But to
	limit this to the most extensive scene which the natural eye could
	take in, is to give a sense to the expression, "all the kingdoms
	of the world," quite violent. It remains, then, to gather from
	the expression, "in a moment of time"— which manifestly
	is intended to intimate some supernatural operation—that it was
	permitted to the tempter to extend preternaturally for a moment our
	Lord's range of vision, and throw a "glory" or glitter over
	the scene of vision: a thing not inconsistent with the analogy of
	other scriptural statements regarding the permitted operations of the
	wicked one. In this case, the "exceeding height" of the
	"mountain" from which this sight was beheld would favor the
	effect to be produced.
