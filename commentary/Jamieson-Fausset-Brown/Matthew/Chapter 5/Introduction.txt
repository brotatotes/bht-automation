<p>That this is the <i>same Discourse</i>
	as that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:17-49">Luke 6:17-49</span>
	—only reported more fully by Matthew, and less fully, as well as
	with considerable variation, by Luke—is the opinion of many very
	able critics (of the Greek commentators; of CALVIN,
	GROTIUS, MALDONATUS—Who
	stands almost alone among Romish commentators; and of most moderns,
	as THOLUCK, MEYER,
	DE WETTE,
	TISCHENDORF, STIER,
	WIESELER, ROBINSON).
	The prevailing opinion of these critics is that Luke's is the
	original form of the discourse, to which Matthew has added a number
	of sayings, uttered on other occasions, in order to give at one view
	the great outlines of our Lord's ethical teaching. But that they are
	<i>two distinct discourses</i>—the one delivered about the close of
	His first missionary tour, and the other after a second such tour and
	the solemn choice of the Twelve—is the judgment of others who have
	given much attention to such matters (of most Romish commentators,
	including ERASMUS; and
	among the moderns, of LANGE,
	GRESWELL, BIRKS,
	WEBSTER and WILKINSON.
	The question is left undecided by ALFORD).
	AUGUSTINE'S opinion—that
	they were both delivered on one occasion, Matthew's on the mountain,
	and to the disciples; Luke's in the plain, and to the promiscuous
	multitude—is so clumsy and artificial as hardly to deserve notice.
	To us the weight of argument appears to lie with those who think them
	two separate discourses. It seems hard to conceive that Matthew
	should have put this discourse before his own calling, if it was not
	uttered till long after, and was spoken in his own hearing as one of
	the newly chosen Twelve. Add to this, that Matthew introduces his
	discourse amidst very definite markings of time, which fix it to our
	Lord's first preaching tour; while that of Luke, which is expressly
	said to have been delivered immediately after the choice of the
	Twelve, could not have been spoken till long after the time noted by
	Matthew. It is hard, too, to see how either discourse can well be
	regarded as the expansion or contraction of the other. And as it is
	beyond dispute that our Lord repeated some of His weightier sayings
	in different forms, and with varied applications, it ought not to
	surprise us that, after the lapse of perhaps a year—when, having
	spent a whole night on the hill in prayer to God, and set the Twelve
	apart, He found Himself surrounded by crowds of people, few of whom
	probably had heard the Sermon on the Mount, and fewer still
	remembered much of it—He should go over its principal points again,
	with just as much sameness as to show their enduring gravity, but at
	the same time with that difference which shows His exhaustless
	fertility as the great Prophet of the Church.
