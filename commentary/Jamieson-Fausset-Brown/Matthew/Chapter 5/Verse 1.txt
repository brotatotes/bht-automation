	says there are in the vicinity of the Sea of Galilee, any one of them
	answering about equally well to the occasion. So charming is the

	by His preaching and miracles, in addition to the smaller band of
	devoted adherents. Though the latter only answered to the subjects of
	His kingdom, described in this discourse, there were drawn from time
	to time into this inner circle souls from the outer one, who, by the
	power of His matchless word, were constrained to forsake their all
	for the Lord Jesus.</p>
