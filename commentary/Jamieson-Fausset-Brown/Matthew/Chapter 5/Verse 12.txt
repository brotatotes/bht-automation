<p><b>12. Rejoice, and be exceeding
	glad</b>—"exult." In the corresponding passage of Luke
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:22">Luke 6:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:23">Luke 6:23</span>),
	where every indignity trying to flesh and blood is held forth as the
	probable lot of such as were faithful to Him, the word is even
	stronger than here: "leap," as if He would have their
	inward transport to overpower and absorb the sense of all these
	affronts and sufferings; nor will anything else do it. 
	</p>
<p><b>for great is your reward in
	heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
	you:</b>—that is, "You do but serve yourselves heirs to their
	character and sufferings, and the reward will be common."</p>
