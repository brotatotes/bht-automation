14. Ye are the light of the
	world—This being the distinctive title which our Lord
	appropriates to Himself (John 8:12;
	John 9:5; and see John 1:4;
	John 1:9; John 3:19;
	John 12:35; John 12:36)
	—a title expressly said to be unsuitable even to the highest of all
	the prophets (John 1:8) —it
	must be applied here by our Lord to His disciples only as they shine
	with His light upon the world, in virtue of His Spirit dwelling in
	them, and the same mind being in them which was also in Christ Jesus.
	Nor are Christians anywhere else so called. Nay, as if to avoid the
	august title which the Master has appropriated to Himself, Christians
	are said to "shine"—not as "lights," as our
	translators render it, but—"as luminaries in the world"
	(Philippians 2:15); and the Baptist is
	said to have been "the burning and shining"—not "light,"
	as in our translation, but "lamp" of his day (Philippians 2:15- :). Let it be observed, too, that while the two figures of
	salt and sunlight both express the same function of Christians—their
	blessed influence on their fellow men—they each set this forth
	under a different aspect. Salt operates internally, in the
	mass with which it comes in contact; the sunlight operates
	externally, irradiating all that it reaches. Hence Christians
	are warily styled "the salt of the earth"—with
	reference to the masses of mankind with whom they are expected to
	mix; but "the light of the world"—with reference
	to the vast and variegated surface which feels its fructifying and
	gladdening radiance. The same distinction is observable in the second
	pair of those seven parables which our Lord spoke from the Galilean
	Lake—that of the "mustard seed," which grew to be a great
	overshadowing tree, answering to the sunlight which invests the
	world, and that of the "leaven," which a woman took and,
	like the salt, hid in three measures of meal, till the whole
	was leavened (Philippians 2:15- :). 
	A city that is set on an hill
	cannot be hid—nor can it be supposed to have been so built
	except to be seen by many eyes.
