<p><b>17. Think not that I am come</b>—that
	I came. 
	</p>
<p><b>to destroy the law, or the
	prophets</b>—that is, "the authority and principles of the Old
	Testament." (On the phrase, see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:12">Matthew 7:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:40">Matthew 22:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+16:16">Luke 16:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:15">Acts 13:15</span>). This general way of
	taking the phrase is much better than understanding "the law"
	and "the prophets" separately, and inquiring, as many good
	critics do, in what sense our Lord could be supposed to meditate the
	subversion of each. To the various classes of His hearers, who might
	view such supposed abrogation of the law and the prophets with very
	different feelings, our Lord's announcement would, in effect, be such
	as this—"Ye who tremble at the word of the Lord, <i>fear</i>
	not that I am going to sweep the foundation from under your feet: Ye
	restless and revolutionary spirits, <i>hope</i> not that I am going
	to head any revolutionary movement: And ye who hypocritically affect
	great reverence for the law and the prophets, <i>pretend</i> not to
	find anything in My teaching derogatory to God's living oracles."
	</p>
<p><b>I am not come to destroy, but
	to fulfil</b>—Not to subvert, abrogate, or annul, but to establish
	the law and the prophets—to unfold them, to embody them in living
	form, and to enshrine them in the reverence, affection, and character
	of men, am I come.</p>
