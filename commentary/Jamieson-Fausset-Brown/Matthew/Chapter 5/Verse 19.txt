<p><b>19. Whosoever therefore shall
	break</b>—rather, "dissolve," "annul," or "make
	invalid." 
	</p>
<p><b>one of these least
	commandments</b>—an expression equivalent to "one of the least
	of these commandments." 
	</p>
<p><b>and shall teach men
	so</b>—referring to the Pharisees and their teaching, as is plain
	from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:20">Matthew 5:20</span>, but of course
	embracing all similar schools and teaching in the Christian Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>he shall be called the least
	in the kingdom of heaven</b>—As the thing spoken of is not the
	practical breaking, or disobeying, of the law, but annulling or
	enervating its obligation by a vicious system of interpretation, and
	teaching others to do the same; so the thing threatened is not
	exclusion from heaven, and still less the lowest place in it, but a
	degraded and contemptuous position in the present stage of the
	kingdom of God. In other words, they shall be reduced by the
	retributive providence that overtakes them, to the same condition of
	dishonor to which, by their system and their teaching, they have
	brought down those eternal principles of God's law. 
	</p>
<p><b>but whosoever shall do and
	teach them</b>—whose principles and teaching go to exalt the
	authority and honor of God's law, in its lowest as well as highest
	requirements. 
	</p>
<p><b>the same shall be called
	great in the kingdom of heaven</b>—shall, by that providence which
	watches over the honor of God's moral administration, be raised to
	the same position of authority and honor to which they exalt the law.</p>
