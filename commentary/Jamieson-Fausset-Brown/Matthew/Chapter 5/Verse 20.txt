<p><b>20. For I say unto you, That except
	your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
	Pharisees</b>—The superiority to the Pharisaic righteousness here
	required is plainly in <i>kind,</i> not <i>degree;</i> for all
	Scripture teaches that entrance into God's kingdom, whether in its
	present or future stage, depends, not on the degree of our excellence
	in anything, but solely on our having the character itself which God
	demands. Our righteousness, then—if it is to contrast with the
	<i>outward</i> and <i>formal</i> righteousness of the scribes and
	Pharisees—must be <i>inward, vital, spiritual.</i> Some, indeed, of
	the scribes and Pharisees themselves might have the very
	righteousness here demanded; but our Lord is speaking, not of
	persons, but of the <i>system</i> they represented and taught. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye shall in no case enter
	into the kingdom of heaven</b>—If this refer, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, rather to the earthly stage of this kingdom, the meaning is
	that without a righteousness exceeding that of the Pharisees, we
	cannot be members of it at all, save in name. This was no new
	doctrine (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28">Romans 2:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+9:6">Romans 9:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span>).
	But our Lord's teaching here stretches beyond the present scene, to
	that everlasting stage of the kingdom, where without "purity of
	heart" none "shall see God."
