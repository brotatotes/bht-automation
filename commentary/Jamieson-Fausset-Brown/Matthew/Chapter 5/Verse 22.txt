<p><b>22. But I say unto you</b>—Mark
	the authoritative tone in which—as Himself the Lawgiver and
	Judge—Christ now gives the true sense, and explains the deep reach,
	of the commandment. 
	</p>
<p><b>That whosoever is angry with
	his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment; and
	whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca! shall be in danger of the
	council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool! shall be in danger of
	hell-fire</b>—It is unreasonable to deny, as ALEXANDER
	does, that three degrees of punishment are here meant to be
	expressed, and to say that it is but a threefold expression of one
	and the same thing. But Romish expositors greatly err in taking the
	first two—"the judgment" and "the council"—to
	refer to degrees of <i>temporal</i> punishment with which lesser sins
	were to be visited under the Gospel, and only the last—"hell-fire"—to
	refer to the future life. All three clearly refer to <i>divine
	retribution,</i> and that alone, for breaches of this commandment;
	though this is expressed by an <i>allusion</i> to Jewish tribunals.
	The "judgment," as already explained, was the lowest of
	these; the "council," or "Sanhedrim,"—which sat
	at Jerusalem—was the highest; while the word used for "hell-fire"
	contains an allusion to the "valley of the son of Hinnom"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jos+18:16">Joshua 18:16</span>). In this valley the
	Jews, when steeped in idolatry, went the length of burning their
	children to Molech "on the high places of Tophet"—in
	consequence of which good Josiah defiled it, to prevent the
	repetition of such abominations (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jos+18:16- :">Joshua 18:16- :</span>); and from that time forward, if we may believe the Jewish
	writers, a fire was kept burning in it to consume the carrion and all
	kinds of impurities that collected about the capital. Certain it is,
	that while the final punishment of the wicked is described in the Old
	Testament by allusions to this valley of Tophet or Hinnom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+30:33">Isaiah 30:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:24">Isaiah 66:24</span>), our Lord Himself
	describes the same by merely quoting these terrific descriptions of
	the evangelical prophet (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:24- :">Isaiah 66:24- :</span>). What precise degrees of unholy feeling towards our
	brothers are indicated by the words "Raca" and "fool"
	it would be as useless as it is vain to inquire. Every age and every
	country has its modes of expressing such things; and no doubt our
	Lord seized on the then current phraseology of unholy disrespect and
	contempt, merely to express and condemn the different degrees of such
	feeling when brought out in words, as He had immediately before
	condemned the feeling itself. In fact, so little are we to make of
	mere <i>words,</i> apart from the feeling which they express, that as
	<i>anger</i> is expressly said to have been borne by our Lord towards
	His enemies though mixed with "grief for the hardness of their
	hearts" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+3:5">Mark 3:5</span>), and as
	the apostle teaches us that there is an anger which is not sinful
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:26">Ephesians 4:26</span>); so in the Epistle
	of James (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+2:20">James 2:20</span>) we find the
	words, "O vain (or, empty) man"; and our Lord Himself
	applies the very word "fools" twice in one breath to the
	blind guides of the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:17">Matthew 23:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+23:19">Matthew 23:19</span>) —although, in both
	cases, it is to <i>false reasoners</i> rather than persons that such
	words are applied. The spirit, then, of the whole statement may be
	thus given: "For ages ye have been taught that the sixth
	commandment, for example, is broken only by the murderer, to pass
	sentence upon whom is the proper business of the recognized
	tribunals. But I say unto you that it is broken even by causeless
	anger, which is but hatred in the bud, as hatred is incipient murder
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:15">1 John 3:15</span>); and if by the
	feelings, much more by those <i>words</i> in which all ill feeling,
	from the slightest to the most envenomed, are wont to be cast upon a
	brother: and just as there are gradations in human courts of
	judicature, and in the sentences which they pronounce according to
	the degrees of criminality, so will the judicial treatment of all the
	breakers of this commandment at the divine tribunal be according to
	their real criminality before the heart-searching Judge." Oh,
	what holy teaching is this!</p>
