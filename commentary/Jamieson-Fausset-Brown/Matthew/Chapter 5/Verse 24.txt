<p><b>24. Leave there thy gift before the
	altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother</b>—The
	meaning evidently is—not, "dismiss from thine own breast all
	ill feeling," but "get thy brother to dismiss from his mind
	all grudge against thee." 
	</p>
<p><b>and then come and offer thy
	gift</b>—"The picture," says THOLUCK,
	"is drawn from life. It transports us to the moment when the
	Israelite, having brought his sacrifice to the court of the
	Israelites, awaited the instant when the priest would approach to
	receive it at his hands. He waits with his gift at the rails which
	separate the place where he stands from the court of the priests,
	into which his offering will presently be taken, there to be slain by
	the priest, and by him presented upon the altar of sacrifice."
	It is at this solemn moment, when about to cast himself upon divine
	mercy, and seek in his offering a seal of divine forgiveness, that
	the offerer is supposed, all at once, to remember that some brother
	has a just cause of complaint against him through breach of this
	commandment in one or other of the ways just indicated. What then? Is
	he to say, As soon as I have offered this gift I will go straight to
	my brother, and make it up with him? Nay; but before another step is
	taken—even before the offering is presented—this reconciliation
	is to be sought, though the gift have to be left unoffered before the
	altar. The converse of the truth here taught is very strikingly
	expressed in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:25">Mark 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+11:26">Mark 11:26</span>:
	"And <i>when ye stand praying</i> (in the very act), forgive, if
	ye have aught (of just complaint) against any; that your Father also
	which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not
	forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive you,"
	c. Hence the beautiful practice of the early Church, to see that all
	differences amongst brethren and sisters in Christ were made up, in
	the spirit of love, before going to the Holy Communion and the Church
	of England has a rubrical direction to this effect in her Communion
	service. Certainly, if this be the highest act of worship on earth,
	such reconciliation though obligatory on all other occasions of
	worship—must be peculiarly so then.</p>
