<p><b>26. Verily I say unto thee, Thou
	shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost
	farthing</b>—a fractional Roman coin, to which our "farthing"
	answers sufficiently well. That our Lord meant here merely to give a
	piece of prudential advice to his hearers, to keep out of the hands
	of the law and its officials by settling all disputes with one
	another privately, is not for a moment to be supposed, though there
	are critics of a school low enough to suggest this. The concluding
	words—"Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come
	out," c.—manifestly show that though the <i>language</i> is
	drawn from human disputes and legal procedure, He is dealing with a
	higher than any human quarrel, a higher than any human tribunal, a
	higher than any human and temporal sentence. In this view of the
	words—in which nearly all critics worthy of the name agree—the
	spirit of them may be thus expressed: "In expounding the sixth
	commandment, I have spoken of offenses between man and man reminding
	you that the offender has another party to deal with besides him whom
	he has wronged on earth, and assuring you that all worship offered to
	the Searcher of hearts by one who knows that a brother has just cause
	of complaint against him, and yet takes no steps to remove it, is
	vain: But I cannot pass from this subject without reminding you of
	One whose cause of complaint against you is far more deadly than any
	that man can have against man: and since with that Adversary you are
	already on the way to judgment, it will be your wisdom to make up the
	quarrel without delay, lest sentence of condemnation be pronounced
	upon you, and then will execution straightway follow, from the
	effects of which you shall never escape as long as any remnant of the
	offense remains unexpiated." It will be observed that as the
	<i>principle</i> on which we are to "agree" with this
	"Adversary" is not here specified, and the precise <i>nature</i>
	of the retribution that is to light upon the despisers of this
	warning is not to be gathered from the mere use of the word "prison";
	so, the <i>remedilessness</i> of the punishment is not in so many
	words expressed, and still less is its actual <i>cessation</i>
	taught. The language on all these points is designedly general; but
	it may safely be said that the <i>unending duration</i> of future
	punishment—elsewhere so clearly and awfully expressed by our Lord
	Himself, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:29">Matthew 5:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:30">Matthew 5:30</span>;

	—is the only doctrine with which His language here quite naturally
	and fully accords. (Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+18:30">Matthew 18:30</span>;
