27. Ye have heard that it was
	said—The words "by," or "to them of old time,"
	in this verse are insufficiently supported, and probably were not in
	the original text. 
	Thou shall not commit
	adultery—Interpreting this seventh, as they did the sixth
	commandment, the traditional perverters of the law restricted the
	breach of it to acts of criminal intercourse between, or with,
	married persons exclusively. Our Lord now dissipates such delusions.
