<p><b>27. Ye have heard that it was
	said</b>—The words "by," or "to them of old time,"
	in this verse are insufficiently supported, and probably were not in
	the original text. 
	</p>
<p><b>Thou shall not commit
	adultery</b>—Interpreting this seventh, as they did the sixth
	commandment, the traditional perverters of the law restricted the
	breach of it to <i>acts</i> of criminal intercourse between, or with,
	married persons exclusively. Our Lord now dissipates such delusions.</p>
