<p><b>28. But I say unto you, That
	whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her</b>—with the intent
	to do so, as the same expression is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; or, with the full consent of his will, to feed thereby his
	unholy desires. 
	</p>
<p><b>hath committed adultery with
	her already in his heart</b>—We are not to suppose, from the word
	here used—"adultery"—that our Lord means to restrict
	the breach of this commandment to married persons, or to criminal
	intercourse with such. The expressions, "<i>whosoever</i>
	looketh," and "looketh upon a <i>woman,</i>" seem
	clearly to extend the range of this commandment to all forms of
	impurity, and the counsels which follow—as they most certainly were
	intended for all, whether married or unmarried—seem to confirm
	this. As in dealing with the sixth commandment our Lord first
	expounds it, and then in the four following verses applies His
	exposition (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21-25">Matthew 5:21-25</span>),
	so here He first expounds the seventh commandment, and then in the
	four following verses applies His exposition (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:21-40.5.25- :">Matthew 5:21-40.5.25- :</span>).</p>
