3. Blessed are the poor in
	spirit—All familiar with Old Testament phraseology know how
	frequently God's true people are styled "the poor" (the
	"oppressed," "afflicted," "miserable")
	or "the needy"—or both together (as in Psalms 40:17;
	Isaiah 41:17). The explanation of
	this lies in the fact that it is generally "the poor of this
	world" who are "rich in faith" (Isaiah 41:17- :; compare 2 Corinthians 6:10;
	Revelation 2:9); while it is often "the
	ungodly" who "prosper in the world" (Revelation 2:9- :). Accordingly, in Luke 6:20;
	Luke 6:21, it seems to be this
	class—the literally "poor" and "hungry"—that
	are specially addressed. But since God's people are in so many places
	styled "the poor" and "the needy," with no
	evident reference to their temporal circumstances (as in Psalms 68:10;
	Psalms 69:29-33; Psalms 132:15;
	Isaiah 61:1; Isaiah 66:2),
	it is plainly a frame of mind which those terms are meant to
	express. Accordingly, our translators sometimes render such words
	"the humble" (Psalms 10:12;
	Psalms 10:17), "the meek"
	(Psalms 22:26), "the lowly"
	(Proverbs 3:34), as having no
	reference to outward circumstances. But here the explanatory words,
	"in spirit," fix the sense to "those who in their
	deepest consciousness realize their entire need" (compare the
	Greek of Luke 10:21;
	John 11:33; John 13:21;
	Acts 20:22; Romans 12:11;
	1 Corinthians 5:3; Philippians 3:3).
	This self-emptying conviction, that "before God we are void of
	everything," lies at the foundation of all spiritual excellence,
	according to the teaching of Scripture. Without it we are
	inaccessible to the riches of Christ; with it we are in the fitting
	state for receiving all spiritual supplies (Revelation 3:17;
	Revelation 3:18; Matthew 9:12;
	Matthew 9:13). 
	for theirs is the kingdom of
	heaven—(See on Matthew 3:2).
	The poor in spirit not only shall have—they already have—the
	kingdom. The very sense of their poverty is begun riches. While
	others "walk in a vain show"—"in a shadow," "an
	image"—in an unreal world, taking a false view of themselves
	and all around them—the poor in spirit are rich in the knowledge of
	their real case. Having courage to look this in the face, and own it
	guilelessly, they feel strong in the assurance that "unto the
	upright there ariseth light in the darkness" (Matthew 3:2- :); and soon it breaks forth as the morning. God wants
	nothing from us as the price of His saving gifts; we have but to feel
	our universal destitution, and cast ourselves upon His compassion
	(Job 33:27; Job 33:28;
	1 John 1:9). So the poor in spirit
	are enriched with the fulness of Christ, which is the kingdom in
	substance; and when He shall say to them from His great white throne,
	"Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
	for you," He will invite them merely to the full enjoyment
	of an already possessed inheritance.
