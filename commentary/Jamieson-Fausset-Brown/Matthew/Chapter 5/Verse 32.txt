<p><b>32. But I say unto you, That
	whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of
	fornication, causeth her to commit adultery</b>—that is, drives her
	into it in case she marries again. 
	</p>
<p><b>and whosoever shall marry her
	that is divorced</b>—for anything short of conjugal infidelity. 
	</p>
<p><b>committeth adultery</b>—for
	if the commandment is broken by the one party, it must be by the
	other also. But see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>.
	Whether the innocent party, after a just divorce, may lawfully marry
	again, is not treated of here. The Church of Rome says, No; but the
	Greek and Protestant Churches allow it.
