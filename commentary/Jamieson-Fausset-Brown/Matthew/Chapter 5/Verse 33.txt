<p><b>33. Again, ye have heard that it
	hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear
	thyself</b>—These are not the precise words of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; but they express all that it was currently understood to
	condemn, namely, false swearing (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, c.). This is plain from what follows. 
	</p>
<p><b>But I say unto you, Swear not
	at all</b>—That this was meant to condemn swearing of every kind
	and on every occasion—as the Society of Friends and some other
	ultra-moralists allege—is not for a moment to be thought. For even
	Jehovah is said once and again to have sworn by Himself and our Lord
	certainly answered upon oath to a question put to Him by the high
	priest; and the apostle several times, and in the most solemn
	language, takes God to witness that he spoke and wrote the truth; and
	it is inconceivable that our Lord should here have quoted the precept
	about not forswearing ourselves, but performing to the Lord our
	oaths, only to give a precept of His own directly in the teeth of it.
	Evidently, it is swearing in common intercourse and on frivolous
	occasions that is here meant. Frivolous oaths were indeed severely
	condemned in the teaching of the times. But so narrow was the circle
	of them that a man might swear, says LIGHTFOOT,
	a hundred thousand times and yet not be guilty of vain swearing.
	Hardly anything was regarded as an oath if only the name of God were
	not in it; just as among ourselves, as TRENCH
	well remarks, a certain lingering reverence for the name of God leads
	to cutting off portions of His name, or uttering sounds nearly
	resembling it, or substituting the name of some heathen deity, in
	profane exclamations or asseverations. Against all this our Lord now
	speaks decisively; teaching His audience that every oath carries an
	appeal to God, whether named or not.

	God's throne</b>—(quoting <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>);</p>
