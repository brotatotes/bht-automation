<p><b>36. Neither shalt thou swear by thy
	head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black</b>â€”In
	the other oaths specified, God's name was profaned quite as really as
	if His name had been uttered, because it was instantly <i>suggested</i>
	by the mention of His "throne," His "footstool,"
	His "city." But in swearing by our own <i>head</i> and the
	like, the objection lies in their being "beyond our control,"
	and therefore profanely assumed to have a stability which they have
	not.</p>
