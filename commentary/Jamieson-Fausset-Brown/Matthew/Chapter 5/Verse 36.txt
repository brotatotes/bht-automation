36. Neither shalt thou swear by thy
	head, because thou canst not make one hair white or blackâ€”In
	the other oaths specified, God's name was profaned quite as really as
	if His name had been uttered, because it was instantly suggested
	by the mention of His "throne," His "footstool,"
	His "city." But in swearing by our own head and the
	like, the objection lies in their being "beyond our control,"
	and therefore profanely assumed to have a stability which they have
	not.
