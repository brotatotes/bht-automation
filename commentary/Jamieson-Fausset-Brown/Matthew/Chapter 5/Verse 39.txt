<p><b>39. But I say unto you, That ye
	resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right check,
	turn to him the other also</b>â€”Our Lord's own meek, yet dignified
	bearing, when smitten rudely on the cheek (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:22">John 18:22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+18:23">John 18:23</span>), and <i>not</i>
	literally presenting the other, is the best comment on these words.
	It is the preparedness, after one indignity, not to invite but to
	submit meekly to another, without retaliation, which this strong
	language is meant to convey.</p>
