<p><b>4. Blessed are they that mourn: for
	they shall be comforted</b>—This "mourning" must not be
	taken loosely for that feeling which is wrung from men under pressure
	of the ills of life, nor yet strictly for sorrow on account of
	committed sins. Evidently it is that entire feeling which the sense
	of our spiritual poverty begets; and so the second beatitude is but
	the complement of the first. The one is the intellectual, the other
	the emotional aspect of the same thing. It is poverty of spirit that
	says, "I am undone"; and it is the mourning which this
	causes that makes it break forth in the form of a lamentation—"Woe
	is me! for I am undone." Hence this class are termed "mourners
	<i>in Zion,</i>" or, as we might express it, religious mourners,
	in sharp contrast with all other sorts (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:1-3">Isaiah 61:1-3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:2">Isaiah 66:2</span>). Religion, according to
	the Bible, is neither a set of intellectual convictions nor a bundle
	of emotional feelings, but a compound of both, the former giving
	birth to the latter. Thus closely do the first two beatitudes cohere.
	The mourners shall be "comforted." Even now they get beauty
	for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the
	spirit of heaviness. Sowing in tears, they reap even here in joy.
	Still, all present comfort, even the best, is partial, interrupted,
	short-lived. But the days of our mourning shall soon be ended, and
	then God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes. Then, in the
	fullest sense, shall the mourners be "comforted."</p>
