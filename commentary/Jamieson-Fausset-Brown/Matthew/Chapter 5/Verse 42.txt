<p><b>42. Give to him that asketh thee</b>—The
	sense of <i>unreasonable</i> asking is here implied (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and from him that would
	borrow of thee turn not thou away</b>—Though the word signifies
	classically "to have money lent to one on security," or
	"with interest," yet as this was not the original sense of
	the word, and as usury was forbidden among the Jews (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, c.), it is doubtless simple borrowing which our Lord here
	means, as indeed the whole strain of the exhortation implies. This
	shows that such counsels as "Owe no man anything" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), are not to be taken absolutely else the Scripture
	commendations of the righteous for "lending" to his
	necessitous brother (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+37:36">Psalms 37:36</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+112:5">Psalms 112:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+6:37">Luke 6:37</span>)
	would have no application. 
	</p>
<p><b>turn not thou away</b>—a
	graphic expression of unfeeling refusal to relieve a brother in
	extremity.
