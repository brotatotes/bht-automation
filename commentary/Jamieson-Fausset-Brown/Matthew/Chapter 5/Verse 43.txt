43. Ye have heard that it hath been
	said— (Leviticus 19:18). 
	Thou shalt love thy
	neighbour—To this the corrupt teachers added, 
	and hate thine enemy—as
	if the one were a legitimate inference from the other, instead of
	being a detestable gloss, as BENGEL
	indignantly calls it. LIGHTFOOT
	quotes some of the cursed maxims inculcated by those traditionists
	regarding the proper treatment of all Gentiles. No wonder that the
	Romans charged the Jews with hatred of the human race.
