<p><b>44. But I say unto you, Love your
	enemies</b>—The word here used denotes <i>moral</i> love, as
	distinguished from the other word, which expresses <i>personal</i>
	affection. Usually, the former denotes "complacency in the
	character" of the person loved; but here it denotes the
	benignant, compassionate outgoings of desire for another's good. 
	</p>
<p><b>bless them that curse you, do
	good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
	you, and persecute you</b>—The best commentary on these matchless
	counsels is the bright example of Him who gave them. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:20">Romans 12:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:21">Romans 12:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:12">1 Corinthians 4:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+3:9">1 Peter 3:9</span>). But though such
	precepts were never before expressed—perhaps not even
	conceived—with such breadth, precision, and sharpness as here, our
	Lord is here only the incomparable Interpreter of the law in force
	from the beginning; and this is the only satisfactory view of the
	entire strain of this discourse.</p>
