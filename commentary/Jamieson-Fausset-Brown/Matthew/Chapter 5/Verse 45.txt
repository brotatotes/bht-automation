45. That ye may be the
	children—sons. 
	of your Father which is in
	heaven—The meaning is, "that ye may show yourselves to be
	such by resembling Him" (compare Matthew 5:9;
	Ephesians 5:1). 
	for he maketh his sun—"your
	Father's sun." Well might BENGEL
	exclaim, "Magnificent appellation!" 
	to rise on the evil and on
	the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust—rather,
	(without the article) "on evil and good, and on just and
	unjust." When we find God's own procedure held up for imitation
	in the law, and much more in the prophets (Leviticus 19:2;
	Leviticus 20:26; and compare 1 Peter 1:15;
	1 Peter 1:16), we may see that the
	principle of this surprising verse was nothing new: but the form of
	it certainly is that of One who spake as never man spake.
