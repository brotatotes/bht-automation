<p><b>48. Be ye therefore</b>—rather,
	"Ye shall therefore be," or "Ye are therefore to be,"
	as My disciples and in My kingdom. 
	</p>
<p><b>perfect</b>—or complete.
	Manifestly, our Lord here speaks, not of <i>degrees</i> of
	excellence, but of the <i>kind</i> of excellence which was to
	distinguish His disciples and characterize His kingdom. When
	therefore He adds, 
	</p>
<p><b>even as your Father which is
	in heaven is perfect</b>—He refers to that full-orbed glorious
	completeness which is in the great Divine Model, "their Father
	which is in heaven."</p>
