8. Blessed are the pure in heart:
	for they shall see God—Here, too, we are on Old Testament
	ground. There the difference between outward and inward purity, and
	the acceptableness of the latter only in the sight of God, are
	everywhere taught. Nor is the "vision of God" strange to
	the Old Testament; and though it was an understood thing that this
	was not possible in the present life ( :-; and compare Job 19:26;
	Job 19:27; Isaiah 6:5),
	yet spiritually it was known and felt to be the privilege of the
	saints even here (Genesis 5:24;
	Genesis 6:9; Genesis 17:1;
	Genesis 48:15; Psalms 27:4;
	Psalms 36:9; Psalms 63:2;
	Isaiah 38:3; Isaiah 38:11,
	c.). But oh, with what grand simplicity, brevity, and power is this
	great fundamental truth here expressed! And in what striking contrast
	would such teaching appear to that which was then current, in which
	exclusive attention was paid to ceremonial purification and external
	morality! This heart purity begins in a "heart sprinkled from an
	evil conscience," or a "conscience purged from dead works"
	(Hebrews 10:22 Hebrews 9:14;
	and see Acts 15:9); and this also
	is taught in the Old Testament (Psalms 32:1;
	Psalms 32:2; compare Romans 4:5-8;
	Isaiah 6:5-8). The conscience
	thus purged—the heart thus sprinkled—there is light within
	wherewith to see God. "If we say that we have fellowship with
	Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we
	walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with
	the other"—He with us and we with Him—"and the blood of
	Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us"—us who have this
	fellowship, and who, without such continual cleansing, would soon
	lose it again—"from all sin" (1 John 1:6;
	1 John 1:7). "Whosoever sinneth
	hath not seen Him, neither known Him" (1 John 1:7- :); "He that doeth evil hath not seen God" (1 John 1:7- :). The inward vision thus clarified, and the whole inner man in
	sympathy with God, each looks upon the other with complacency and
	joy, and we are "changed into the same image from glory to
	glory." But the full and beatific vision of God is reserved for
	that time to which the Psalmist stretches his views—"As for
	me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied,
	when I awake, with Thy likeness" (1 John 1:7- :). Then shall His servants serve Him: and they shall see His
	face; and His name shall be in their foreheads (Revelation 22:3;
	Revelation 22:4). They shall see Him as
	He is (1 John 3:2). But, says the
	apostle, expressing the converse of this beatitude—"Follow
	holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord" (1 John 3:2- :).
