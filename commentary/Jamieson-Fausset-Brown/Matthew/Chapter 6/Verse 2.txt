	to be what he is not (as here), or <i>dissembles</i> what he really
	is (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:1">Luke 12:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:2">Luke 12:2</span>).

<p><b>in the synagogues and in the
	streets</b>—the places of religious and secular resort.

<p><b>that they may have glory of
	men. Verily I say unto you</b>—In such august expressions, it is
	the Lawgiver and Judge Himself that we hear speaking to us.

<p><b>They have their reward</b>—All
	they wanted was human applause, and they have it—and with it, all
	they will ever get.</p>
