<p><b>20. But lay up for yourselves
	treasures in heaven</b>—The language in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) is very bold—"Sell that ye have, and give alms;
	provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens
	that faileth not," &amp;c. 
	</p>
<p><b>where neither moth nor rust
	doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor
	steal</b>—Treasures these, <i>imperishable</i> and <i>unassailable!</i>
	(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:2">Colossians 3:2</span>).</p>
