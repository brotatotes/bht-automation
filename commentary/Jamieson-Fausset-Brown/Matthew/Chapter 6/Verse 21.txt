<p><b>21. For where your treasure is</b>—that
	which ye value most. 
	</p>
<p><b>there will your heart be
	also</b>—"Thy treasure—thy heart" is probably the true
	reading here: "your," in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, from which it seems to have come in here. Obvious though
	this maxim be, by what multitudes who profess to bow to the teaching
	of Christ is it practically disregarded! "What a man loves,"
	says LUTHER, quoted by
	THOLUCK, "that is his
	God. For he carries it in his heart, he goes about with it night and
	day, he sleeps and wakes with it; be it what it may—wealth or pelf,
	pleasure or renown." But because "laying up" is not in
	itself sinful, nay, in some cases enjoined (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and honest industry and sagacious enterprise are usually
	rewarded with prosperity, many flatter themselves that all is right
	between them and God, while their closest attention, anxiety, zeal,
	and time are exhausted upon these earthly pursuits. To put this
	right, our Lord adds what follows, in which there is profound
	practical wisdom.</p>
