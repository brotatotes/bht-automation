22. The light—rather, "the
	lamp." 
	of the body is the eye: if
	therefore thine eye be single—simple, clear. As applied to the
	outward eye, this means general soundness; particularly, not looking
	two ways. Here, as also in classical Greek, it is used figuratively
	to denote the simplicity of the mind's eye, singleness of purpose,
	looking right at its object, as opposed to having two ends in view.
	(See Proverbs 4:25-27). 
	thy whole body shall be full
	of light—illuminated. As with the bodily vision, the man who
	looks with a good, sound eye, walks in light, seeing every object
	clear; so a simple and persistent purpose to serve and please God in
	everything will make the whole character consistent and bright.
