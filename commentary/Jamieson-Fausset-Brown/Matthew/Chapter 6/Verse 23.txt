23. But if thine eye be
	evil—distempered, or, as we should say, If we have got a bad
	eye. 
	thy whole body shall be full
	of darkness—darkened. As a vitiated eye, or an eye that looks
	not straight and full at its object, sees nothing as it is, so a mind
	and heart divided between heaven and earth is all dark. 
	If therefore the light that
	is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!—As the
	conscience is the regulative faculty, and a man's inward purpose,
	scope, aim in life, determines his character—if these be not simple
	and heavenward, but distorted and double, what must all the other
	faculties and principles of our nature be which take their direction
	and character from these, and what must the whole man and the whole
	life be but a mass of darkness? In Luke ( :-) the converse of this statement very strikingly expresses
	what pure, beautiful, broad perceptions the clarity of the inward
	eye imparts: "If thy whole body therefore be full of light,
	having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the
	bright shining of a candle doth give thee light." But now for
	the application of this.
