<p><b>24. No man can serve</b>—The word
	means to "belong wholly and be entirely under command to." 
	</p>
<p><b>two masters: for either he
	will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the
	one, and despise the other</b>—Even if the two masters be of one
	character and have but one object, the servant must <i>take law</i>
	from one or the other: though he may do what is agreeable to both, he
	cannot, in the nature of the thing, be <i>servant</i> to more than
	one. Much less if, as in the present case, their interests are quite
	different, and even conflicting. In this case, if our affections be
	in the service of the one—if we "love the one"—we must
	of necessity "hate the other"; if we determine resolutely
	to "hold to the one," we must at the same time disregard,
	and (if he insist on his claims upon us) even "despise the
	other." 
	</p>
<p><b>Ye cannot serve God and
	mammon</b>—The word "<i>mamon</i>"—better written with
	one <i>m</i>—is a foreign one, whose precise derivation cannot
	certainly be determined, though the most probable one gives it the
	sense of "what one trusts in." Here, there can be no doubt
	it is used for <i>riches,</i> considered as an idol master, or god of
	the heart. The service of this god and the true God together is here,
	with a kind of indignant curtness, pronounced impossible. But since
	the teaching of the preceding verses might seem to endanger our
	falling short of what is requisite for the present life, and so being
	left destitute, our Lord now comes to speak to that point.</p>
