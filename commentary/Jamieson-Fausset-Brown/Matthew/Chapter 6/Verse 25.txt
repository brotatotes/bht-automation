25. Therefore I say unto you, Take
	no thought—"Be not solicitous." The English word
	"thought," when our version was made, expressed this idea
	of "solicitude," "anxious concern"—as may be
	seen in any old English classic; and in the same sense it is used in
	1 Samuel 9:5, c. But this sense of the
	word has now nearly gone out, and so the mere English reader is apt
	to be perplexed. Thought or forethought, for temporal
	things—in the sense of reflection, consideration—is required
	alike by Scripture and common sense. It is that anxious solicitude,
	that oppressive care, which springs from unbelieving doubts and
	misgivings, which alone is here condemned. (See 1 Samuel 9:5- :). 
	for your life, what ye shall
	eat, or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body, what ye shall put
	on—In Luke (Luke 12:29)
	our Lord adds, "neither be ye unsettled"—not "of
	doubtful mind," as in our version. When "careful (or 'full
	of care') about nothing," but committing all in prayer and
	supplication with thanksgiving unto God, the apostle assures us that
	"the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep
	our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:6;
	Philippians 4:7); that is, shall guard
	both our feelings and our thoughts from undue agitation, and keep
	them in a holy calm. But when we commit our whole temporal condition
	to the wit of our own minds, we get into that "unsettled"
	state against which our Lord exhorts His disciples. 
	Is not the life more than
	meat—food. 
	and the body than raiment?—If
	God, then, gives and keeps up the greater—the life, the body—will
	He withhold the less, food to sustain life and raiment to clothe the
	body?
