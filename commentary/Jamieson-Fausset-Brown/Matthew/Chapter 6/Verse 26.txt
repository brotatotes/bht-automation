<p><b>for they sow not, neither do
	they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
	them. Are ye not much better than they?</b>—nobler in yourselves
	and dearer to God. The argument here is from the greater to the less;
	but how rich in detail! The brute creation—void of reason—are
	incapable of sowing, reaping, and storing: yet your heavenly Father
	suffers them not helplessly to perish, but sustains them without any
	of those processes. Will He see, then, His own children using all the
	means which reason dictates for procuring the things needful for the
	body—looking up to Himself at every step—and yet leave them to
	starve?</p>
