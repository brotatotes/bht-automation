<p><b>27. Which of you, by taking
	thought</b>—anxious solicitude. 
	</p>
<p><b>can add one cubit unto his
	stature?</b>—"Stature" can hardly be the thing intended
	here: first, because the subject is the <i>prolongation of life,</i>
	by the supply of its necessaries of food and clothing: and next,
	because no one would dream of adding a cubit—or a foot and a
	half—to his stature, while in the corresponding passage in Luke
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:25">Luke 12:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:26">Luke 12:26</span>)
	the thing intended is represented as "that thing which is
	<i>least.</i>" But if we take the word in its primary sense of
	"<i>age</i>" (for "stature" is but a secondary
	sense) the idea will be this, "Which of you, however anxiously
	you vex yourselves about it, can add so much as a step to the length
	of your life's journey?" To compare the length of life to
	measures of this nature is not foreign to the language of Scripture
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+39:5">Psalms 39:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:7">2 Timothy 4:7</span>,
	&amp;c.). So understood, the meaning is clear and the connection
	natural. In this the best critics now agree.</p>
