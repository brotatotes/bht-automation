27. Which of you, by taking
	thought—anxious solicitude. 
	can add one cubit unto his
	stature?—"Stature" can hardly be the thing intended
	here: first, because the subject is the prolongation of life,
	by the supply of its necessaries of food and clothing: and next,
	because no one would dream of adding a cubit—or a foot and a
	half—to his stature, while in the corresponding passage in Luke
	(Luke 12:25; Luke 12:26)
	the thing intended is represented as "that thing which is
	least." But if we take the word in its primary sense of
	"age" (for "stature" is but a secondary
	sense) the idea will be this, "Which of you, however anxiously
	you vex yourselves about it, can add so much as a step to the length
	of your life's journey?" To compare the length of life to
	measures of this nature is not foreign to the language of Scripture
	(compare Psalms 39:5; 2 Timothy 4:7,
	&c.). So understood, the meaning is clear and the connection
	natural. In this the best critics now agree.
