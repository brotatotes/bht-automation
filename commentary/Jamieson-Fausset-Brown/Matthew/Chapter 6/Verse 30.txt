30. Wherefore, if God so clothe the
	grass—the "herbage." 
	of the field, which to-day
	is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven—wild flowers cut with
	the grass, withering by the heat, and used for fuel. (See  :-). 
	shall He not much more clothe
	you, O ye of little faith?—The argument here is something
	fresh. Gorgeous as is the array of the flowers that deck the fields,
	surpassing all artificial human grandeur, it is for but a brief
	moment; you are ravished with it to-day, and to-morrow it is gone;
	your own hands have seized and cast it into the oven: Shall, then,
	God's children, so dear to Him, and instinct with a life that cannot
	die, be left naked? He does not say, Shall they not be more
	beauteously arrayed? but, Shall He not much more clothe them?
	that being all He will have them regard as secured to them (compare
	Hebrews 13:5). The expression,
	"Little-faithed ones," which our Lord applies once and
	again to His disciples (Matthew 8:26;
	Matthew 14:31; Matthew 16:8),
	can hardly be regarded as rebuking any actual manifestations of
	unbelief at that early period, and before such an audience. It is His
	way of gently chiding the spirit of unbelief, so natural even
	to the best, who are surrounded by a world of sense, and of kindling
	a generous desire to shake it off.
