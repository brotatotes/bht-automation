<p><b>30. Wherefore, if God so clothe the
	grass</b>—the "herbage." 
	</p>
<p><b>of the field, which to-day
	is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven</b>—wild flowers cut with
	the grass, withering by the heat, and used for fuel. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>shall He not much more clothe
	you, O ye of little faith?</b>—The argument here is something
	fresh. Gorgeous as is the array of the flowers that deck the fields,
	surpassing all artificial human grandeur, it is for but a brief
	moment; you are ravished with it to-day, and to-morrow it is gone;
	your own hands have seized and cast it into the oven: Shall, then,
	God's children, so dear to Him, and instinct with a life that cannot
	die, be left naked? He does not say, Shall they not be more
	beauteously arrayed? but, Shall He not much more <i>clothe</i> them?
	that being all He will have them regard as secured to them (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:5">Hebrews 13:5</span>). The expression,
	"Little-faithed ones," which our Lord applies once and
	again to His disciples (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+8:26">Matthew 8:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+14:31">Matthew 14:31</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:8">Matthew 16:8</span>),
	can hardly be regarded as rebuking any actual manifestations of
	unbelief at that early period, and before such an audience. It is His
	way of gently chiding the <i>spirit</i> of unbelief, so natural even
	to the best, who are surrounded by a world of sense, and of kindling
	a generous desire to shake it off.</p>
