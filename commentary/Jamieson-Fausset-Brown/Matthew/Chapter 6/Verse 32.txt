<p><b>32. (For after all these things do
	the Gentiles seek)</b>—rather, "pursue." Knowing nothing
	definitely beyond the present life to kindle their aspirations and
	engage their supreme attention, the heathen naturally pursue present
	objects as their chief, their only good. To what an elevation above
	these does Jesus here lift His disciples! 
	</p>
<p><b>for your heavenly Father
	knoweth that ye have need of all these things</b>—How precious this
	word! Food and raiment are pronounced <i>needful</i> to God's
	children; and He who could say, "No man knoweth the Father but
	the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), says with an authority which none but Himself could
	claim, "Your heavenly Father <i>knoweth</i> that ye have need of
	all these things." Will not that suffice you, O ye needy ones of
	the household of faith?</p>
