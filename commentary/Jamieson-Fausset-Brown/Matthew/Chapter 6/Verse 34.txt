<p><b>34. Take therefore no
	thought</b>—anxious care. 
	</p>
<p><b>for the morrow: for the
	morrow shall take thought for the things of itself</b>—(or,
	according to other authorities, "for itself")—shall have
	its own causes of anxiety. 
	</p>
<p><b>Sufficient unto the day is
	the evil thereof</b>—An admirable practical maxim, and better
	rendered in our version than in almost any other, not excepting the
	preceding English ones. Every day brings its own cares; and to
	anticipate is only to double them.</p>
