4. That thine alms may be in secret,
	and thy Father which seeth in secret himself
	shall reward thee openlyâ€”The word "Himself" appears
	to be an unauthorized addition to the text, which the sense no doubt
	suggested. (See 1 Timothy 5:25; Romans 2:16;
	1 Corinthians 4:5). 
	Prayer (Matthew 6:5;
	Matthew 6:6).
