<p><b>6. But thou, when thou prayest,
	enter into thy closet</b>—a place of retirement. 
	</p>
<p><b>and when thou hast shut thy
	door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which
	seeth in secret shall reward thee openly</b>—Of course, it is not
	the simple publicity of prayer which is here condemned. It may be
	offered in any circumstances, however open, if not prompted by the
	spirit of ostentation, but dictated by the great ends of prayer
	itself. It is the <i>retiring</i> character of true prayer which is
	here taught.
