<p><b>7. But when ye pray, use not vain
	repetitions</b>—"Babble not" would be a better rendering,
	both for the form of the word—which in both languages is intended
	to imitate the sound—and for the sense, which expresses not so much
	the repetition of the same words as a senseless multiplication of
	them; as appears from what follows. 
	</p>
<p><b>as the heathen do: for they
	think that they shall be heard for their much speaking</b>—This
	method of heathen devotion is still observed by Hindu and Mohammedan
	devotees. With the Jews, says LIGHTFOOT,
	it was a maxim, that "Every one who multiplies prayer is heard."
	In the Church of Rome, not only is it carried to a shameless extent,
	but, as THOLUCK justly
	observes, the very prayer which our Lord gave as an antidote to vain
	repetitions is the most abused to this superstitious end; the number
	of times it is repeated counting for so much more merit. Is not this
	just that characteristic feature of heathen devotion which our Lord
	here condemns? But praying much, and using at times the same words,
	is <i>not</i> here condemned, and has the example of our Lord Himself
	in its favor.</p>
