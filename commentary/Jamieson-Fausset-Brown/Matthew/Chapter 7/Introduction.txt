	SUPPLEMENTARY COUNSELS.
	 
	</p>
<p>That these verses are entirely
	supplementary is the simplest and most natural view of them. All
	attempts to make out any evident connection with the immediately
	preceding context are, in our judgment, forced. But, though
	supplementary, these counsels are far from being of subordinate
	importance. On the contrary, they involve some of the most delicate
	and vital duties of the Christian life. In the vivid form in which
	they are here presented, perhaps they could not have been introduced
	with the same effect under any of the foregoing heads; but they
	spring out of the same great principles, and are but other forms and
	manifestations of the same evangelical "righteousness."
