<p><b>13. Enter ye in at the strait
	gate</b>—as if hardly wide enough to admit one at all. This
	expresses the difficulty of the first right step in religion,
	involving, as it does, a triumph over all our natural inclinations.
	Hence the still stronger expression in Luke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "Strive to enter in at the strait gate." 
	</p>
<p><b>for wide is the gate</b>—easily
	entered. 
	</p>
<p><b>and broad is the way</b>—easily
	trodden. 
	</p>
<p><b>that leadeth to destruction,
	and</b>—thus lured "many there be which go in thereat."</p>
