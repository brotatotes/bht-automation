13. Enter ye in at the strait
	gate—as if hardly wide enough to admit one at all. This
	expresses the difficulty of the first right step in religion,
	involving, as it does, a triumph over all our natural inclinations.
	Hence the still stronger expression in Luke ( :-), "Strive to enter in at the strait gate." 
	for wide is the gate—easily
	entered. 
	and broad is the way—easily
	trodden. 
	that leadeth to destruction,
	and—thus lured "many there be which go in thereat."
