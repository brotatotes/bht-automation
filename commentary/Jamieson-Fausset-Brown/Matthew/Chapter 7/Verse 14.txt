<p><b>14. Because strait is the gate, and
	narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life</b>—In other words, the
	whole course is as difficult as the first step; and (so it comes to
	pass that). 
	</p>
<p><b>few there be that find it</b>—The
	recommendation of the broad way is the ease with which it is trodden
	and the abundance of company to be found in it. It is sailing with a
	fair wind and a favorable tide. The natural inclinations are not
	crossed, and fears of the issue, if not easily hushed, are in the
	long run effectually subdued. The one disadvantage of this course is
	its end—it "leadeth to destruction." The great Teacher
	says it, and says it as "One having authority." To the
	supposed injustice or harshness of this He never once adverts. He
	leaves it to be inferred that such a course righteously, naturally,
	necessarily so ends. But whether men see this or no, here He lays
	down the law of the kingdom, and leaves it with us. As to the other
	way, the disadvantage of it lies in its narrowness and solicitude.
	Its very first step involves a revolution in all our purposes and
	plans for life, and a surrender of all that is dear to natural
	inclination, while all that follows is but a repetition of the first
	great act of self-sacrifice. No wonder, then, that few find and few
	are found in it. But it has one advantage—it "leadeth unto
	life." Some critics take "the gate" here, not for the
	first, but the last step in religion; since gates seldom open into
	roads, but roads usually terminate in a gate, leading straight to a
	mansion. But as this would make our Lord's words to have a very
	inverted and unnatural form as they stand, it is better, with the
	majority of critics, to view them as we have done. But since such
	teaching would be as unpopular as the way itself, our Lord next
	forewarns His hearers that preachers of smooth things—the true
	heirs and representatives of the false prophets of old—would be
	rife enough in the new kingdom.</p>
