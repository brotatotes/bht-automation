<p><b>16. Ye shall know them by their

	itself; but the practical effect of their teaching, which is the
	proper fruit of the tree.

<p><b>Do men gather grapes of
	thorns</b>—any kind of prickly plant.

<p><b>or figs of thistles?</b>—a
	three-pronged variety. The general sense is obvious—Every tree
	bears its own fruit.</p>
