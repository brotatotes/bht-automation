2. For with what judgments ye judge,
	ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete—whatever
	standard of judgment ye apply to others. 
	it shall be measured to you
	again—This proverbial maxim is used by our Lord in other
	connections—as in Mark 4:24,
	and with a slightly different application in Mark 4:24- : —as a great principle in the divine administration. Unkind
	judgment of others will be judicially returned upon ourselves, in the
	day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ. But, as
	in many other cases under the divine administration, such harsh
	judgment gets self-punished even here. For people shrink from contact
	with those who systematically deal out harsh judgment upon
	others—naturally concluding that they themselves may be the next
	victims—and feel impelled in self-defense, when exposed to it, to
	roll back upon the assailant his own censures.
