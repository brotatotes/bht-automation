<p><b>22. Many will say to me in that
	day</b>—What day? It is emphatically unnamed. But it is the day to
	which He had just referred, when men shall "enter" or not
	enter "into the kingdom of heaven." (See a similar way of
	speaking of "that day" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+1:12">2 Timothy 1:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Lord, Lord</b>—The
	reiteration denotes surprise. "What, Lord? How is this? Are <i>we</i>
	to be disowned?" 
	</p>
<p><b>have we not prophesied</b>—or,
	"publicly taught." As one of the special gifts of the
	Spirit in the early Church, it has the sense of "inspired and
	authoritative teaching," and is ranked next to the apostleship.
	(See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:11">Ephesians 4:11</span>).
	In this sense it is used here, as appears from what follows. 
	</p>
<p><b>in thy name</b>—or, "to
	thy name," and so in the two following clauses—"having
	reference to Thy name as the sole power in which we did it." 
	</p>
<p><b>and in thy name have cast out
	devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works</b>—or, miracles.
	These are selected as three examples of the highest services rendered
	to the Christian cause, and through the power of Christ's own name,
	invoked for that purpose; He Himself, too, responding to the call.
	And the threefold repetition of the question, each time in the same
	form, expresses in the liveliest manner the astonishment of the
	speakers at the view now taken of them.</p>
