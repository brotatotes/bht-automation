<p><b>5. Thou hypocrite</b>—"Hypocrite."
	</p>
<p><b>first cast out the beam out
	of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the
	mote out of thy brother's eye</b>—Our Lord uses a most
	hyperbolical, but not unfamiliar figure, to express the monstrous
	inconsistency of this conduct. The "hypocrisy" which, not
	without indignation, He charges it with, consists in the pretense of
	a zealous and compassionate charity, which cannot possibly be real in
	one who suffers worse faults to lie uncorrected in himself. He only
	is fit to be a reprover of others who jealously and severely judges
	himself. Such persons will not only be slow to undertake the office
	of censor on their neighbors, but, when constrained in faithfulness
	to deal with them, will make it evident that they do it with
	<i>reluctance</i> and not satisfaction, with <i>moderation</i> and
	not exaggeration, with <i>love</i> and not harshness.

<p><i>Prostitution of Holy Things</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+7:6">Matthew 7:6</span>). The opposite extreme
	to that of censoriousness is here condemned—want of discrimination
	of character.</p>
