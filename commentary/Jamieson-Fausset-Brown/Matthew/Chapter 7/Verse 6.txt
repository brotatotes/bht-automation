<p><b>6. Give not that which is holy unto
	the dogs</b>—savage or snarling haters of truth and righteousness. 
	</p>
<p><b>neither cast ye your pearls
	before swine</b>—the impure or coarse, who are incapable of
	appreciating the priceless jewels of Christianity. In the East, dogs
	are wilder and more gregarious, and, feeding on carrion and garbage,
	are coarser and fiercer than the same animals in the West. Dogs and
	swine, besides being ceremonially unclean, were peculiarly repulsive
	to the Jews, and indeed to the ancients generally. 
	</p>
<p><b>lest they trample them under
	their feet</b>—as swine do. 
	</p>
<p><b>and turn again and rend
	you</b>—as dogs do. Religion is brought into contempt, and its
	professors insulted, when it is forced upon those who cannot value it
	and will not have it. But while the indiscriminately zealous have
	need of this caution, let us be on our guard against too readily
	setting our neighbors down as dogs and swine, and excusing ourselves
	from endeavoring to do them good on this poor plea.

<p><i>Prayer</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Enough, one might think, had been said on this subject
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+6:5-15">Matthew 6:5-15</span>. But the
	difficulty of the foregoing duties seems to have recalled the
	subject, and this gives it quite a new turn. "How shall we ever
	be able to carry out such precepts as these, of tender, holy, yet
	discriminating love?" might the humble disciple inquire. "Go
	to God with it," is our Lord's reply; but He expresses this with
	a fulness which leaves nothing to be desired, urging now not only
	confidence, but importunity in prayer.</p>
