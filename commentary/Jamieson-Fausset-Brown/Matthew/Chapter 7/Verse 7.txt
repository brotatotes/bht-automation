<p><b>7. Ask, and it shall be given you;
	seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto
	you</b>â€”Though there seems evidently a climax here, expressive of
	more and more importunity, yet each of these terms used presents what
	we desire of God in a different light. We <i>ask</i> for what we
	<i>wish;</i> we <i>seek</i> for what we <i>miss;</i> we <i>knock</i>
	for that from which we feel ourselves <i>shut out.</i> Answering to
	this threefold representation is the triple assurance of success to
	our believing efforts. "But ah!" might some humble disciple
	say, "I cannot persuade myself that <i>I</i> have any interest
	with God." To meet this, our Lord repeats the triple assurance
	He had just given, but in such a form as to silence every such
	complaint.</p>
