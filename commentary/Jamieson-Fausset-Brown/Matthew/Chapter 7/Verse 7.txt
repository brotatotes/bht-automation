7. Ask, and it shall be given you;
	seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto
	youâ€”Though there seems evidently a climax here, expressive of
	more and more importunity, yet each of these terms used presents what
	we desire of God in a different light. We ask for what we
	wish; we seek for what we miss; we knock
	for that from which we feel ourselves shut out. Answering to
	this threefold representation is the triple assurance of success to
	our believing efforts. "But ah!" might some humble disciple
	say, "I cannot persuade myself that I have any interest
	with God." To meet this, our Lord repeats the triple assurance
	He had just given, but in such a form as to silence every such
	complaint.
