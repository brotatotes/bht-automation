8. For every one that asketh
	receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it
	shall be opened—Of course, it is presumed that he asks
	aright—that is, in faith—and with an honest purpose to make use
	of what he receives. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of
	God. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering (undecided whether to
	be altogether on the Lord's side). For he that wavereth is like a
	wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that
	man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord" ( :-). Hence, "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask
	amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts" ( :-).
