<p><b>2. And, behold, there came a
	leper</b>—"a man full of leprosy," says <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Much has been written on this disease of leprosy, but
	certain points remain still doubtful. All that needs be said here is
	that it was a cutaneous disease, of a loathsome, diffusive, and,
	there is reason to believe, when thoroughly pronounced, incurable
	character; that though in its distinctive features it is still found
	in several countries—as Arabia, Egypt, and South Africa—it
	prevailed, in the form of what is called white leprosy, to an unusual
	extent, and from a very early period, among the Hebrews; and that it
	thus furnished to the whole nation a familiar and affecting symbol of
	SIN, considered as (1)
	<i>loathsome,</i> (2) <i>spreading,</i> (3) <i>incurable.</i> And
	while the ceremonial ordinances for detection and cleansing
	prescribed in this case by the law of Moses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) held forth a coming remedy "for sin and for
	uncleanness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:7">Psalms 51:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:1">2 Kings 5:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:7">2 Kings 5:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:10">2 Kings 5:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:13">2 Kings 5:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:14">2 Kings 5:14</span>), the numerous cases of
	leprosy with which our Lord came in contact, and the glorious cures
	of them which He wrought, were a fitting manifestation of the work
	which He came to accomplish. In this view, it deserves to be noticed
	that the first of our Lord's miracles of healing recorded by Matthew
	is this cure of a leper. 
	</p>
<p><b>and worshipped him</b>—in
	what sense we shall presently see. Mark says (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:14- :">2 Kings 5:14- :</span>), he came, "beseeching and kneeling to Him," and
	Luke says (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+5:12">Luke 5:12</span>), "he
	fell on his face." 
	</p>
<p><b>saying, Lord, if thou wilt,
	thou canst make me clean</b>—As this is the only cure of leprosy
	recorded by all the three first Evangelists, it was probably the
	first case of the kind; and if so, this leper's faith in the power of
	Christ must have been formed in him by what he had heard of His other
	cures. And how striking a faith is it! He does not say he <i>believed</i>
	Him able, but with a brevity expressive of a confidence that knew no
	doubt, he says simply, "Thou canst." But of Christ's
	willingness to heal him he was not so sure. It needed more knowledge
	of Jesus than he could be supposed to have to assure him of that. But
	one thing he was sure of, that He had but to "will" it.
	This shows with what "worship" of Christ this leper fell on
	his face before Him. Clear theological knowledge of the Person of
	Christ was not then possessed even by those who were most with Him
	and nearest to Him. Much less could full insight into all that we
	know of the Only-begotten of the Father be expected of this leper.
	But he who at that moment felt and owned that to heal an incurable
	disease needed but the <i>fiat</i> of the Person who stood before
	him, had assuredly that very faith in the germ which now casts its
	crown before Him that loved us, and would at any time die for His
	blessed name.</p>
