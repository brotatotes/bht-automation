<p><b>3. And Jesus</b>—or "He,"
	according to another reading,—"moved with compassion,"
	says Mark (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:41">Mark 1:41</span>); a precious
	addition. 
	</p>
<p><b>put forth his hand, and
	touched him</b>—Such a touch occasioned ceremonial defilement (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:41- :">Mark 1:41- :</span>); even as the leper's coming near enough for contact was
	against the Levitical regulations (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:41- :">Mark 1:41- :</span>). But as the man's faith told him there would be no case
	for such regulations if the cure he hoped to experience should be
	accomplished, so He who had healing in His wings transcended all such
	statutes. 
	</p>
<p><b>saying, I will; be thou
	clean</b>—How majestic those two words! By not assuring the man of
	His <i>power</i> to heal him, He delightfully sets His seal to the
	man's previous confession of that power; and by assuring him of the
	one thing of which he had any doubt, and for which he waited—His
	<i>will</i> to do it—He makes a claim as divine as the cure which
	immediately followed it. 
	</p>
<p><b>And immediately his leprosy
	was cleansed</b>—Mark, more emphatic, says (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+1:41- :">Mark 1:41- :</span>), "And as soon as He had spoken, immediately the
	leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed"—as perfectly
	as instantaneously. What a contrast this to modern pretended cures!</p>
