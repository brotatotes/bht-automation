10. And it came to pass, as Jesus
	sat at meat in the house—The modesty of our Evangelist signally
	appears here. Luke says (Luke 5:29)
	that "Levi made Him a great feast," or "reception,"
	while Matthew merely says, "He sat at meat"; and Mark and
	Luke say that it was in Levi's "own house," while Matthew
	merely says, "He sat at meat in the house." Whether
	this feast was made now, or not till afterwards, is a point of some
	importance in the order of events, and not agreed among harmonists.
	The probability is that it did not take place till a considerable
	time afterwards. For Matthew, who ought surely to know what took
	place while his Lord was speaking at his own table, tells us that the
	visit of Jairus, the ruler of the synagogue, occurred at that moment
	(Matthew 9:18). But we know from
	Mark and Luke that this visit of Jairus did not take place till after
	our Lord's return, at a later period from the country of the
	Gadarenes. (See Mark 5:21-43;
	Luke 8:40-56, c.). We
	conclude, therefore, that the feast was not made in the novelty of
	his discipleship, but after Matthew had had time to be somewhat
	established in the faith when returning to Capernaum, his compassion
	for old friends, of his own calling and character, led him to gather
	them together that they might have an opportunity of hearing the
	gracious words which proceeded out of His Master's mouth, if haply
	they might experience a like change. 
	behold, many publicans and
	sinners—Luke says, "a great company" (Luke 8:40-42.8.56- :) 
	came and sat down with him
	and his disciples—In all such cases the word rendered "sat"
	is "reclined," in allusion to the ancient mode of lying on
	couches at meals.
