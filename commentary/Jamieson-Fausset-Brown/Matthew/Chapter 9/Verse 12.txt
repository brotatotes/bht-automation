12. But when Jesus heard that,
	he said unto them—to the Pharisees and scribes; addressing
	Himself to them, though they had shrunk from addressing Him. 
	They that be whole need not a
	physician, but they that are sick—that is, "Ye deem
	yourselves whole; My mission, therefore, is not to you: The
	physician's business is with the sick; therefore eat I with publicans
	and sinners." Oh, what myriads of broken hearts, of sin-sick
	souls, have been bound up by this matchless saying!
