<p><b>12. But when Jesus heard </b><i><b>that,</b></i><b>
	he said unto them</b>—to the Pharisees and scribes; addressing
	Himself to them, though they had shrunk from addressing Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>They that be whole need not a
	physician, but they that are sick</b>—that is, "Ye deem
	yourselves whole; My mission, therefore, is not to you: The
	physician's business is with the sick; therefore eat I with publicans
	and sinners." Oh, what myriads of broken hearts, of sin-sick
	souls, have been bound up by this matchless saying!</p>
