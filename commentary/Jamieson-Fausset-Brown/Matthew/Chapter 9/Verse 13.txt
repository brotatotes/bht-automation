13. But go ye and learn what that
	meaneth— (Hosea 6:6), 
	I will have mercy, and not
	sacrifice—that is, the one rather than the other. "Sacrifice,"
	the chief part of the ceremonial law, is here put for a religion of
	literal adherence to mere rules; while "mercy" expresses
	such compassion for the fallen as seeks to lift them up. The duty of
	keeping aloof from the polluted, in the sense of "having no
	fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness," is obvious
	enough; but to understand this as prohibiting such intercourse with
	them as is necessary to their recovery, is to abuse it. This was what
	these pharisaical religionists did, and this is what our Lord here
	exposes. 
	for I am not come to call the
	righteous, but sinners to repentance —The
	italicized words are of doubtful authority here, and more than
	doubtful authority in Mark 2:17;
	but in Luke 5:32 they are
	undisputed. We have here just the former statement stripped of its
	figure. "The righteous" are the whole; "sinners,"
	the sick. When Christ "called" the latter, as He did
	Matthew, and probably some of those publicans and sinners whom he had
	invited to meet Him, it was to heal them of their spiritual maladies,
	or save their souls: "The righteous," like those miserable
	self-satisfied Pharisees, "He sent empty away."
