<p><b>27. And when Jesus departed thence,
	two blind men followed him</b>—hearing, doubtless, as in a later
	case is expressed, "that Jesus passed by" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>crying, and saying, Thou son
	of David, have mercy on us</b>—It is remarkable that in the only
	other recorded case in which the blind applied to Jesus for their
	sight, and obtained it, they addressed Him, over and over again, by
	this one Messianic title, so well known—"Son of David"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+20:30">Matthew 20:30</span>). Can there be a
	doubt that their faith fastened on such great Messianic promises as
	this, "Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened," &amp;c.
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+35:5">Isaiah 35:5</span>)? and if so, this
	appeal to Him, as the Consolation of Israel, to do His predicted
	office, would fall with great weight upon the ears of Jesus.</p>
