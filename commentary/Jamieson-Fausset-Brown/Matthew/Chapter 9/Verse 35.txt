<p><b>35. And Jesus went about all the
	cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the
	gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease
	</b><i><b>among the people</b></i><b> </b>—The italicized words are
	of more than doubtful authority here, and were probably introduced
	here from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>. The language
	here is so identical with that used in describing the first circuit
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>), that we may presume
	the work done on both occasions was much the same. It was just a
	further preparation of the soil, and a fresh sowing of the precious
	seed. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:23">Matthew 4:23</span>). To
	these fruitful journeyings of the Redeemer, "with healing in His
	wings," Peter no doubt alludes, when, in his address to the
	household of Cornelius, he spoke of "How God anointed Jesus of
	Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing
	good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for God was
	with Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:38">Acts 10:38</span>).

<p><i>Jesus Compassionating the
	Multitudes, Asks Prayer for Help</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:38- :">Acts 10:38- :</span>). He had now returned from His preaching and healing
	circuit, and the result, as at the close of the first one, was the
	gathering of a vast and motley multitude around Him. After a whole
	night spent in prayer, He had called His more immediate disciples,
	and from them had solemnly chosen the twelve; then, coming down from
	the mountain, on which this was transacted, to the multitudes that
	waited for Him below, He had addressed to them—as we take it—that
	discourse which bears so strong a resemblance to the Sermon on the
	Mount that many critics take it to be the same. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:38- :">Acts 10:38- :</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:1">Matthew 5:1</span>,
	Introductory Remarks). Soon after this, it should seem, the
	multitudes still hanging on Him, Jesus is touched with their wretched
	and helpless condition, and acts as is now to be described.</p>
