<p style=" "><b>I
	beseech thee</b>
	— emphatically repeated from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.
	In the <i>Greek,</i>
	the name “Onesimus” is skillfully put last, he puts first a
	favorable description of him before he mentions the name that had
	fallen into so bad repute with Philemon. “I beseech thee for my
	son, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus.” Scripture does
	not sanction slavery, but at the same time does not begin a political
	crusade against it. It sets forth <i>principles
	of love</i>
	to our fellow men which were sure (as they have done) in due time to
	undermine and overthrow it, without violently convulsing the then
	existing political fabric, by stirring up slaves against their
	masters.</p>
