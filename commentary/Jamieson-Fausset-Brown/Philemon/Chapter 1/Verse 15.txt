<p style=" "><b>perhaps</b>
	— speaking in human fashion, yet as one believing that God’s
	Providence probably (for we cannot dogmatically define the hidden
	purposes of God in providence) overruled the past evil to ultimately
	greater good to him. This thought would soften Philemon’s
	indignation at Onesimus’ past offense. So Joseph in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>departed</b>
	— literally, “was parted from thee”; a softening term for “ran
	away,” to mitigate Philemon’s wrath.</p>
<p style=" "><b>receive
	him</b> —
	<i>Greek,</i>
	“have him for thyself in full possession” (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	The same <i>Greek</i>
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
<p style=" "><b>for
	ever</b> —
	in this life and in that to come (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).
	Onesimus’ time of absence, however long, was but a short “hour”
	(so <i>Greek</i>)
	compared with the everlasting devotion henceforth binding him to his
	master.</p>
