<p style=" "><b>with

	— not employing an amanuensis, as in other Epistles: a special
	compliment to Philemon which he ought to show his appreciation of by
	granting Paul’s request. Contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	which shows that the Epistle to the Colossian Church, accompanying
	this Epistle, had only its closing “salutation” written by Paul’s
	own hand.</p>
<p style=" "><b>albeit,
	etc.</b> —
	literally, “that I may not say ... not to say,” etc.</p>
<p style=" "><b>thou
	owest ... even thine own self</b>
	— not merely thy possessions. For to my instrumentality thou owest
	thy salvation. So the debt which “he oweth thee” being
	transferred upon me (I making myself responsible for it) is
	cancelled.</p>
