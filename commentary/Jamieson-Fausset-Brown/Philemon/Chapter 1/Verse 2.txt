<p style=" "><b>Apphia</b>
	— the <i>Latin,</i>
	“Appia”; either the wife or some close relative of Philemon. She
	and Archippus, if they had not belonged to his family, would not have
	been included with Philemon in the address of a letter on a domestic
	matter.</p>
<p style=" "><b>Archippus</b>
	— a minister of the Colossian Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
<p style=" "><b>fellow
	soldier</b>
	— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
<p style=" "><b>church
	in thy house</b>
	— In the absence of a regular church building, the houses of
	particular saints were used for that purpose. Observe Paul’s tact
	in associating with Philemon those associated by kindred or Christian
	brotherhood with his <i>house,</i>
	and not going beyond it.</p>
