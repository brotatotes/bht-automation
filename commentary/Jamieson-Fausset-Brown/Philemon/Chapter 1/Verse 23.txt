<p style=" "><b>Epaphras,
	my fellow prisoner</b>
	— He had been sent by the Colossian Church to inquire after, and
	minister to, Paul, and possibly was cast into <i>prison</i>
	by the Roman authorities on suspicion. However, he is not mentioned
	as a <i>prisoner</i>
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	so that “fellow prisoner” here may mean merely one who was a
	faithful companion to Paul in his imprisonment, and by his society
	put himself in the position of a prisoner. So also “Aristarchus, my
	fellow prisoner,” <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	may mean. Benson conjectures the meaning to be that on some <i>former</i>
	occasion these two were Paul’s “fellow prisoners,” <i>not
	at the time.</i></p>
