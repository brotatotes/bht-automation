<p style=" "><b>Wherefore</b>
	— Because of my love to thee, I prefer to “<i>beseech,</i>”
	rather than “enjoin,” or <i>authoritatively
	command.</i></p>
<p style=" "><b>I
	might ... enjoin</b>
	— in virtue of the obligation to <i>obedience</i>
	which Philemon lay under to Paul, as having been converted through
	his instrumentality.</p>
<p style=" "><b>in
	Christ</b>
	— the element in which his boldness has place.</p>
