<p><b>10.</b> Literally, "<i>With a
	view to</i> your <i>proving</i> (and so approving and embracing) <i>the
	things that excel</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); not merely things not bad, but the things best among those
	that are good; the things of more advanced excellence. Ask as to
	things, not merely, Is there no harm, but is there any good, and
	which is the best? 
	</p>
<p><b>sincere</b>—from a <i>Greek</i>
	root. <i>Examined in the sunlight and found pure.</i>
</p>
<p><b>without offence</b>—not
	stumbling; running the Christian race without falling through any
	stumbling-block, that is, temptation, in your way. 
	</p>
<p><b>till</b>—rather, "unto,"
	"against"; so that when the day of Christ comes, ye may be
	found pure and without offense.</p>
