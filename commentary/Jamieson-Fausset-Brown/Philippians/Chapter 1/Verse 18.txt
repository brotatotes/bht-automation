18. What follows from this? Does
	this trouble me as they thought it would? "Notwithstanding"
	their unkind thought to me, and self-seeking intention, the
	cause I have at heart is furthered "every way" of
	preaching, "whether in pretense (with a by motive,  :-) or in truth (out of true 'love' to Christ,  :-), Christ is proclaimed; and therein I do rejoice,
	yea, and I will rejoice." From this it would seem that these
	self-seeking teachers in the main "proclaimed Christ," not
	"another Gospel," such as the Judaizers in Galatia taught
	(Galatians 1:6-8); though
	probably having some of the Jewish leaven (see on Galatians 1:6-48.1.8- :), their chief error was their self-seeking envious
	motive, not so much error of doctrine; had there been vital
	error, Paul would not have rejoiced. The proclamation of
	CHRIST," however
	done, roused attention, and so was sure to be of service. Paul could
	thus rejoice at the good result of their bad intentions (Psalms 76:10;
	Isaiah 10:5; Isaiah 10:7).
