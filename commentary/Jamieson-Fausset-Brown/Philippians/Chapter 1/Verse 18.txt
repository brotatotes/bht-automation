<p><b>18.</b> What follows from this? Does
	this trouble me as they thought it would? "Notwithstanding"
	their unkind <i>thought</i> to me, and self-seeking intention, the
	cause I have at heart is furthered "every way" of
	preaching, "whether in pretense (with a by motive, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) or in truth (out of true 'love' to Christ, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), Christ is <i>proclaimed;</i> and therein I do rejoice,
	yea, and I will rejoice." From this it would seem that these
	self-seeking teachers in the main "proclaimed Christ," not
	"another Gospel," such as the Judaizers in Galatia taught
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6-8">Galatians 1:6-8</span>); though
	probably having some of the Jewish leaven (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:6-48.1.8- :">Galatians 1:6-48.1.8- :</span>), their <i>chief</i> error was their self-seeking envious
	<i>motive,</i> not so much error of doctrine; had there been <i>vital</i>
	error, Paul would not have <i>rejoiced.</i> The <i>proclamation of</i>
	CHRIST," however
	done, roused attention, and so was sure to be of service. Paul could
	thus rejoice at the good result of their bad intentions (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+76:10">Psalms 76:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:5">Isaiah 10:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+10:7">Isaiah 10:7</span>).</p>
