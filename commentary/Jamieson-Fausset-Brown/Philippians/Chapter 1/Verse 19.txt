<p><b>19. turn to my salvation</b>—"turn
	out <i>to</i> me <i>for</i>, (or <i>unto</i>) salvation." This
	proclamation of Christ every way will turn out to <i>my spiritual
	good.</i> Christ, whose interests are my interests, being glorified
	thereby; and so the coming of His kingdom being furthered, which,
	when it does come, will bring completed "SALVATION"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28">Hebrews 9:28</span>) to me and all whose
	"earnest expectation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:28- :">Hebrews 9:28- :</span>) is that Christ may be magnified in them. So far is their
	preaching from causing me, as they thought, <i>tribulation in my
	bonds</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:16">Philippians 1:16</span>). Paul
	plainly quotes and applies to himself the very words of the
	<i>Septuagint</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+13:16">Job 13:16</span>),
	"This shall turn out to my salvation," which belong to all
	God's people of every age, in their tribulation (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+13:16- :">Job 13:16- :</span>).

<p><b>through your prayer and the
	supply</b>—The <i>Greek</i> intimately joins the two nouns
	together, by having but one preposition and one article: "Through
	your prayer and (<i>the consequent</i>) supply of the Spirit of Jesus
	Christ (obtained for me through your prayer)."</p>
