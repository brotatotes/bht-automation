2. Grace . . . peace—The very
	form of this salutation implies the union of Jew, Greek, and Roman.
	The Greek salutation was "joy" (chairein), akin to
	the Greek for "grace" (charis). The Roman was
	"health," the intermediate term between grace and
	peace. The Hebrew was "peace," including both
	temporal and spiritual prosperity. Grace must come first if we
	are to have true peace.
from . . . from—Omit
	the second "from": as in the Greek, "God our
	Father" and "the Lord Jesus Christ," are most closely
	connected.
