<p><b>2. Grace . . . peace</b>—The very
	form of this salutation implies the union of Jew, Greek, and Roman.
	The Greek salutation was "joy" (<i>chairein</i>), akin to
	the <i>Greek</i> for "grace" (<i>charis</i>). The Roman was
	"health," the intermediate term between <i>grace</i> and
	<i>peace.</i> The <i>Hebrew</i> was "peace," including both
	temporal and spiritual prosperity. <i>Grace</i> must come first if we
	are to have true <i>peace.</i>
</p>
<p><b>from . . . from</b>—Omit
	the second "from": as in the <i>Greek,</i> "God our
	Father" and "the Lord Jesus Christ," are most closely
	connected.</p>
