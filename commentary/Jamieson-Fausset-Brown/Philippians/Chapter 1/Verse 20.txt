<p><b>20. According to my earnest
	expectation</b>—The <i>Greek</i> expresses, "expectation <i>with
	uplifted head</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28">Luke 21:28</span>)
	<i>and outstretched neck.</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28- :">Luke 21:28- :</span> is the only other place in the New Testament that the word
	occurs. TITTMANN says, in
	both places it implies not mere <i>expectation,</i> but <i>the
	anxious desire of an anticipated prosperous issue in afflictive
	circumstances.</i> The subject of his earnest expectation which
	follows, answers to "my salvation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28- :">Luke 21:28- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in nothing I shall be
	ashamed</b>—in nothing have reason to be ashamed of "my work
	for God, or His work in me" [ALFORD].
	Or, "in nothing be <i>disappointed</i> in my <i>hope,</i> but
	that I may fully obtain it" [ESTIUS].
	So "ashamed" is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28- :">Luke 21:28- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>all boldness</b>—"all"
	is opposed to "in nothing," as "boldness" is the
	opposite to "ashamed." 
	</p>
<p><b>so now also</b>—when "my
	body" is "in bonds" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:28- :">Luke 21:28- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Christ</b>—not Paul, "shall
	be magnified." 
	</p>
<p><b>life, or by death</b>—Whatever
	be the issue, I cannot lose; I must be the gainer by the event. Paul
	was not omniscient; in the issue of things pertaining to themselves,
	the apostles underwent the same probation of faith and patience as
	we.</p>
