21. For—in either event ( :-) I must be the gainer, "For to me," c. 
	to live is Christ—whatever
	life, time, and strength, I have, is Christ's Christ is the sole
	object for which I live (Galatians 2:20).
	to die is gain—not the
	act of dying, but as the Greek ("to have died")
	expresses, the state after death. Besides the glorification of
	Christ by my death, which is my primary object (Galatians 2:20- :), the change of state caused by death, so far from being a
	matter of shame (Philippians 1:20)
	or loss, as my enemies suppose, will be a positive "gain"
	to me.
