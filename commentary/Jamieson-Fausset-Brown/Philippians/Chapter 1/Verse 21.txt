<p><b>to live is Christ</b>—whatever

<p><b>to die is gain</b>—not the
	act of dying, but as the <i>Greek</i> ("to have died")
	expresses, <i>the state after death.</i> Besides the glorification of
	Christ by my death, which is my primary object (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20- :">Galatians 2:20- :</span>), the change of state caused by death, so far from being a
	matter of <i>shame</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:20">Philippians 1:20</span>)
	or loss, as my enemies suppose, will be a positive "gain"
	to me.</p>
