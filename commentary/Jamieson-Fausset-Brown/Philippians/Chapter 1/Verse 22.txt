<p><b>22.</b> Rather as <i>Greek,</i> "But
	if to live in the flesh (if), this (I say, the continuance in life
	which I am undervaluing) be the fruit of my labor (that is, be the
	condition in which the fruit of my ministerial labor is involved),
	<i>then</i> what I shall choose I know not (I cannot determine with
	myself, if the choice were given me, both alternatives being great
	goods alike)." So ALFORD
	and ELLICOTT. BENGEL
	takes it as <i>English Version,</i> which the <i>Greek</i> will bear
	by supposing an ellipsis, "If to live in the flesh (be my
	portion), this (continuing to live) is the fruit of my labor,"
	that is, this continuance in life will be the occasion of my bringing
	in "the fruit of labor," that is, will be the occasion of
	"labors" which are their own "fruit" or reward;
	or, this my continuing "to live" will have this "fruit,"
	namely, "labors" for Christ. GROTIUS
	explains "the fruit of labor" as an idiom for "worthwhile";
	If I live in the flesh, this is worth my while, for thus Christ's
	interest will be advanced, "For to me to live is Christ"
