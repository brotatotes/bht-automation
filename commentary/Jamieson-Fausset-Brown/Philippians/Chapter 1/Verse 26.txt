26. Translate, "That your
	matter of glorying (or rejoicing) may abound in Christ Jesus
	in me (that is, in my case; in respect to me, or for me
	who have been granted to your prayers,  :-) through my presence again among you." ALFORD
	makes the "matter of glorying," the possession of the
	Gospel, received from Paul, which would abound, be assured and
	increased, by his presence among them; thus, "in me,"
	implies that Paul is the worker of the material of abounding in
	Christ Jesus. But "my rejoicing over you" ( :-), answers plainly to "your rejoicing in respect
	to me" here.
