<p><b>26.</b> Translate, "That your
	matter of glorying (or <i>rejoicing</i>) may abound in Christ Jesus
	in me (that is, in my case; <i>in respect to me,</i> or <i>for me</i>
	who have been granted to your prayers, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) through my presence again among you." ALFORD
	makes the "matter of glorying," <i>the possession of the
	Gospel,</i> received from Paul, which would abound, be assured and
	increased, by his presence among them; thus, "in me,"
	implies that Paul is the worker of the material of abounding in
	Christ Jesus. But "my <i>rejoicing</i> over you" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), answers plainly to "your <i>rejoicing</i> in respect
	to me" here.</p>
