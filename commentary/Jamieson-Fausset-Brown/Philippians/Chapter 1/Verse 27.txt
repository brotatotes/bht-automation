<p><b>27. Only</b>—Whatever happens as
	to my coming to you, or not, make this your one only care. By
	supposing this or that future contingency, many persuade themselves
	they will be such as they ought to be, but it is better always
	without evasion to perform present duties under present circumstances
	[BENGEL]. 
	</p>
<p><b>let your conversation
	be</b>—(Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20">Philippians 3:20</span>).
	The <i>Greek</i> implies, "Let your <i>walk as citizens</i>
	(namely, of the heavenly state; 'the city of the living God,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20- :">Philippians 3:20- :</span>, 'the heavenly Jerusalem,' 'fellow citizens of the saints,'
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19">Ephesians 2:19</span>) be," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>I . . . see . . . hear</b>—so
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:30">Philippians 1:30</span>. "Hear," in
	order to include both alternatives, must include the meaning <i>know.</i>
</p>
<p><b>your affairs</b>—your
	state. 
	</p>
<p><b>in one spirit</b>—the fruit
	of partaking of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:3">Ephesians 4:3</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:4">Ephesians 4:4</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>with one mind</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>soul,</i>" the sphere of the affections;
	subordinate to the "Spirit," man's higher and heavenly
	nature. "There is sometimes natural antipathies among believers;
	but these are overcome, when there is not only unity of spirit, but
	also of <i>soul</i>" [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>striving together</b>—with
	united effort.</p>
