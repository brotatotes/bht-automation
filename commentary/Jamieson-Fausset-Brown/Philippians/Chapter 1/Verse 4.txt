<p><b>4. making request</b>—Translate,
	"making <i>my</i> request." 
	</p>
<p><b>for you all</b>—The
	frequent repetition in this Epistle of "all" with "you,"
	marks that Paul desires to declare his love for <i>all</i> alike, and
	will not recognize any divisions among them. 
	</p>
<p><b>with joy</b>—the
	characteristic feature in this Epistle, as <i>love</i> is in that to
	the Ephesians (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:18">Philippians 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:2">Philippians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:19">Philippians 2:19</span>;

	<i>Love</i> and <i>joy</i> are the two first-fruits of the Spirit.
	<i>Joy</i> gives especial animation to prayers. It marked his high
	opinion of them, that there was almost everything in them to give him
	<i>joy,</i> and almost nothing to give him pain.</p>
