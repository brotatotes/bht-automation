<p><b>of you</b>—literally, "<i>in

	was that God would perfect His own good work of grace in them.

<p><b>because,</b> c.—Punctuate
	and translate, "Because I have you in my heart (so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> otherwise the <i>Greek</i> and the words immediately
	following in the verse, favor the <i>Margin,</i> '<i>Ye</i> have <i>me</i>
	in <i>your</i> heart . . . being partakers of my grace') (both, in my
	bonds, and in <i>my</i> defense and confirmation of the Gospel), you
	(I say) all being fellow partakers of my grace." This last
	clause thus assigns the reason why he has them <i>in his heart</i>
	(that is, cherished in his love, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:2">2 Corinthians 3:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:3">2 Corinthians 7:3</span>), even in his bonds, and
	in his defense and confirmation of the Gospel (such as he was
	constantly making in private, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:3- :">2 Corinthians 7:3- :</span>; his self-defense and confirmation of the Gospel being
	necessarily conjoined, as the <i>Greek</i> implies; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+7:3- :">2 Corinthians 7:3- :</span>), namely, "inasmuch as ye are fellow partakers of my
	grace": inasmuch as ye share with me in "the fellowship of
	the Gospel" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:5">Philippians 1:5</span>), and
	have manifested this, both by suffering as I do for the Gospel's sake
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:28-30">Philippians 1:28-30</span>), and by
	imparting to me of your substance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:28-50.1.30- :">Philippians 1:28-50.1.30- :</span>). It is natural and right for me thus confidently to pray in
	your behalf. (ELLICOTT,
	and others translate, "To be thus minded for you all"),
	because of my having you in my warmest remembrances even in my bonds,
	since you are sharers with me in the Gospel grace. Bonds do not bind
	love.</p>
