<p><b>in the bowels of Jesus
	Christ</b>—"Christ Jesus" is the order in the oldest
	manuscripts. My <i>yearning love</i> (so the <i>Greek</i> implies) to
	you is not merely from natural affection, but from devotedness to
	Christ Jesus. "Not Paul, but Jesus Christ lives in Paul;
	wherefore Paul is not moved in the bowels (that is, the tender love,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+31:20">Jeremiah 31:20</span>) of Paul, but of
	Jesus Christ" [BENGEL].
	All real spiritual love is but a portion of Christ's love which
	yearns in all who are united to Him [ALFORD].</p>
