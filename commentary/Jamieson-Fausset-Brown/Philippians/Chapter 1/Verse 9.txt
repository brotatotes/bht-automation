9. The subject of his prayer for
	them (Philippians 1:4). 
	your love—to Christ,
	producing love not only to Paul, Christ's minister, as it did, but
	also to one another, which it did not altogether as much as it ought
	(Philippians 2:2; Philippians 4:2).
	knowledge—of doctrinal
	and practical truth. 
	judgment—rather,
	"perception"; "perceptive sense." Spiritual
	perceptiveness: spiritual sight, spiritual hearing, spiritual
	feeling, spiritual taste. Christianity is a vigorous plant, not the
	hotbed growth of enthusiasm. "Knowledge" and "perception"
	guard love from being ill-judged.
