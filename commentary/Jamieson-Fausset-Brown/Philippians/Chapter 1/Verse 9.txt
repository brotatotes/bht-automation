<p><b>your love</b>—to Christ,
	producing love not only to Paul, Christ's minister, as it did, but
	also to one another, which it did not altogether as much as it ought
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:2">Philippians 2:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:2">Philippians 4:2</span>).

<p><b>knowledge</b>—of doctrinal

	</p>
<p><b>judgment</b>—rather,
	"perception"; "perceptive sense." Spiritual
	perceptiveness: spiritual sight, spiritual hearing, spiritual
	feeling, spiritual taste. Christianity is a vigorous plant, not the
	hotbed growth of enthusiasm. "Knowledge" and "perception"
	guard love from being ill-judged.</p>
