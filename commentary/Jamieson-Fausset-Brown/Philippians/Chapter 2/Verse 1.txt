	urges <i>four influencing motives</i> in this verse, to inculcate the
	four Christian duties corresponding respectively to them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "That ye be <i>like-minded,</i> having the same <i>love,</i>
	of <i>one accord,</i> of one mind"; (1) "If there be (with
	you) <i>any consolation in Christ,</i>" that is, any <i>consolation
	of which Christ is the source,</i> leading you to wish <i>to console
	me</i> in my afflictions borne for Christ's sake, ye owe it to me to
	grant my request "that ye be like-minded" [CHRYSOSTOM
	and ESTIUS]: (2) "If
	there be any comfort of (that is, flowing from) love," the
	adjunct of "consolation in Christ"; (3) "If any
	fellowship of (communion together as Christians, flowing from joint
	participation in) the Spirit" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). As <i>Pagans</i> meant literally those who were of one

	union which conjoins those who drink of the same Spirit! (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span>;

	(4) "If any bowels (tender emotions) and mercies (compassions),"
	the adjuncts of "fellowship of the Spirit." The opposites
	of the two pairs, into which the four fall, are reprobated, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:3">Philippians 2:3</span>;
