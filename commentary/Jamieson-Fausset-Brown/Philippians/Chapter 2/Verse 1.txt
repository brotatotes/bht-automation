1. The "therefore"
	implies that he is here expanding on the exhortation ( :-), "In one Spirit, with one mind (soul)." He
	urges four influencing motives in this verse, to inculcate the
	four Christian duties corresponding respectively to them ( :-). "That ye be like-minded, having the same love,
	of one accord, of one mind"; (1) "If there be (with
	you) any consolation in Christ," that is, any consolation
	of which Christ is the source, leading you to wish to console
	me in my afflictions borne for Christ's sake, ye owe it to me to
	grant my request "that ye be like-minded" [CHRYSOSTOM
	and ESTIUS]: (2) "If
	there be any comfort of (that is, flowing from) love," the
	adjunct of "consolation in Christ"; (3) "If any
	fellowship of (communion together as Christians, flowing from joint
	participation in) the Spirit" ( :-). As Pagans meant literally those who were of one
	village, and drank of one fountain, how much greater is the
	union which conjoins those who drink of the same Spirit! (1 Corinthians 12:4;
	1 Corinthians 12:13) [GROTIUS]:
	(4) "If any bowels (tender emotions) and mercies (compassions),"
	the adjuncts of "fellowship of the Spirit." The opposites
	of the two pairs, into which the four fall, are reprobated, Philippians 2:3;
	Philippians 2:4.
