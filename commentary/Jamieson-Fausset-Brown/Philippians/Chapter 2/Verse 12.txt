<p><b>12. Wherefore</b>—Seeing that we
	have in Christ such a specimen of glory resulting from "<i>obedience</i>"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8">Philippians 2:8</span>) and humiliation, see
	that ye also be "obedient," and so "<i>your</i>
	salvation" shall follow your obedience. 
	</p>
<p><b>as ye have . . . obeyed</b>—"<i>even
	as</i> ye have <i>been obedient,</i>" namely, to God, as Jesus
	was "obedient" unto God (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8- :">Philippians 2:8- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>not as,</b> c.—"not <i>as
	if</i>" it were a matter to be done "in my presence only,
	but now (as things are) much more (with more earnestness) in my
	absence (because my help is withdrawn from you)" [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>work out</b>—carry out to
	its full perfection. "Salvation" is "worked in"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:13">Philippians 2:13</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11">Ephesians 1:11</span>)
	believers by the Spirit, who enables them through faith to be
	justified <i>once for all;</i> but it needs, as a progressive work,
	to be "worked <i>out</i>" by obedience, through the help of
	the same Spirit, unto perfection (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11- :">Ephesians 1:11- :</span>). The sound Christian neither, like the formalist, rests in
	the means, without looking to the end, and to the Holy Spirit who
	alone can make the means effectual; nor, like the fanatic, hopes to
	attain the end without the means. 
	</p>
<p><b>your own</b>—The emphasis
	is on this. Now that <i>I</i> am not present to further the work of
	your salvation, "work out <i>your own</i> salvation"
	yourselves the more carefully. Do not think this work cannot go on
	because I am absent; "for (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11- :">Ephesians 1:11- :</span>) it is God that worketh in you," c. In this case adopt
	a rule different from the former (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:11- :">Ephesians 1:11- :</span>), but resting on the same principle of "lowliness of
	mind" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:3">Philippians 2:3</span>), namely,
	"look each on <i>his own</i> things," instead of
	"disputings" with others (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:3- :">Philippians 2:3- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>salvation</b>—which is in
	"Jesus" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10">Philippians 2:10</span>),
	as His name (meaning God-Saviour) implies. 
	</p>
<p><b>with fear and trembling</b>—the
	very feeling enjoined on "servants," as to what ought to
	accompany their "obedience" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:10- :">Philippians 2:10- :</span>). So here: See that, as "servants" to God, after
	the example of Christ, ye be so "with the fear and trembling"
	which becomes servants not slavish fear, but <i>trembling anxiety not
	to fall short of the goal</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:26">1 Corinthians 9:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:27">1 Corinthians 9:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:1">Hebrews 4:1</span>,
	"Let us fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into His
	rest, any should come short of it"), <i>resulting from a sense
	of our human insufficiency, and from the consciousness that all
	depends on the power of God,</i> "who worketh both to will and
	to do" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:20">Romans 11:20</span>). "Paul,
	though joyous, writes seriously" [J. J. WOLF].</p>
