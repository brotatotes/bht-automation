13. For—encouragement to work:
	"For it is God who worketh in you," always present with
	you, though I be absent. It is not said, "Work out your own
	salvation, though it is God," c., but, "because
	it is God who," &c. The will, and the power to
	work, being first instalments of His grace, encourage us to make
	full proof of, and carry out to the end, the "salvation"
	which He has first "worked," and is still "working in"
	us, enabling us to "work it out." "Our will
	does nothing thereunto without grace but grace is inactive without
	our will" [ST.
	BERNARD]. Man is, in
	different senses, entirely active, and entirely passive: God
	producing all, and we acting all. What He produced is our own
	acts. It is not that God does some, and we the rest. God does all,
	and we do all. God is the only proper author, we the only proper
	actors. Thus the same things in Scripture are represented as from
	God, and from us. God makes a new heart, and we are commanded to make
	us a new heart; not merely because we must use the means in order to
	the effect, but the effect itself is our act and our duty (Ezekiel 11:19;
	Ezekiel 18:31; Ezekiel 36:26)
	[EDWARDS]. 
	worketh—rather as
	Greek, "worketh effectually." We cannot of
	ourselves embrace the Gospel of grace: "the will" (Psalms 110:3;
	2 Corinthians 3:5) comes solely of God's
	gift to whom He will (John 6:44;
	John 6:65); so also the power "to
	do" (rather, "to work effectually," as the
	Greek is the same as that for "worketh in"), that
	is, effectual perseverance to the end, is wholly of God's gift
	(Philippians 1:6; Hebrews 13:21).
	of his good pleasure—rather
	as Greek, "FOR
	His good pleasure"; in order to carry out His sovereign
	gracious purpose towards you (Ephesians 1:5;
	Ephesians 1:9).
