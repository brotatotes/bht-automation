<p><b>16. Holding forth</b>—to them, and
	so <i>applying</i> it (the common meaning of the <i>Greek;</i>
	perhaps here including also the other meaning, "holding <i>fast</i>").
	The image of <i>light-bearers</i> or <i>luminaries</i> is carried on
	from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:15">Philippians 2:15</span>. As the heavenly
	luminaries' <i>light</i> is closely connected with the <i>life</i> of
	animals, so ye hold forth the light of Christ's "word"
	(received from me) which is the "life" of the Gentiles
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:4">John 1:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:1">1 John 1:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5-7">1 John 1:5-7</span>). Christ is "the
	Light of the world" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:5-62.1.7- :">1 John 1:5-62.1.7- :</span>); believers are only "light-bearers" reflecting
	His light. 
	</p>
<p><b>that I may rejoice
	in</b>—literally, "<i>with a view to</i> (your being) <i>a
	subject of rejoicing</i> to me <i>against</i> the day of Christ"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:1">Philippians 4:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+1:14">2 Corinthians 1:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+2:19">1 Thessalonians 2:19</span>).

<p><b>that I have not run in
	vain</b>—that it was not in vain that I labored for your spiritual
	good.</p>
