<p><b>17. Yea, and if</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "Yea, if even"; implying that he regarded the
	contingency as not unlikely: He had assumed the <i>possibility</i> of
	his being found alive at Christ's coming (for in every age Christ
	designed Christians to stand in preparedness for His coming as at
	hand): he here puts a supposition which he regards as more likely,
	namely, his own death before Christ's coming. 
	</p>
<p><b>I be offered</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "I am poured out." "I am made a
	libation." Present, not future, as the danger is threatening him
	<i>now.</i> As in sacrifices libations of wine were "<i>poured</i>
	upon" the offerings, so he represents his Philippian converts,
	offered through faith (or else their <i>faith</i> itself), as the
	sacrifice, and <i>his blood as the libation</i> "poured upon"
	it (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:16">Romans 15:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:6">2 Timothy 4:6</span>).
	</p>
<p><b>service</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"priest's ministration"; carrying out the image of a
	sacrifice. 
	</p>
<p><b>I joy</b>—for myself
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:21">Philippians 1:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23">Philippians 1:23</span>).
	His expectation of release from prison is much fainter, than in the
	Epistles to Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon, written somewhat
	earlier from Rome. The appointment of Tigellinus to be Prætorian
	Prefect was probably the cause of this change. See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:23- :">Philippians 1:23- :</span>
</p>
<p><b>rejoice with you all</b>—ALFORD
	translates, "<i>I congratulate</i> you all," namely on the
	honor occurring to you by my blood being poured out on the sacrifice
	of your faith. If <i>they rejoiced</i> already (as <i>English Version</i>
	represents), what need of his urging them, "Do <i>ye also</i>
	joy."</p>
