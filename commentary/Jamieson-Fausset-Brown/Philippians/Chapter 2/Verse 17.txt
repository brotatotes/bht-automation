17. Yea, and if—rather as
	Greek, "Yea, if even"; implying that he regarded the
	contingency as not unlikely: He had assumed the possibility of
	his being found alive at Christ's coming (for in every age Christ
	designed Christians to stand in preparedness for His coming as at
	hand): he here puts a supposition which he regards as more likely,
	namely, his own death before Christ's coming. 
	I be offered—rather as
	Greek, "I am poured out." "I am made a
	libation." Present, not future, as the danger is threatening him
	now. As in sacrifices libations of wine were "poured
	upon" the offerings, so he represents his Philippian converts,
	offered through faith (or else their faith itself), as the
	sacrifice, and his blood as the libation "poured upon"
	it (compare Romans 15:16; 2 Timothy 4:6).
	service—Greek,
	"priest's ministration"; carrying out the image of a
	sacrifice. 
	I joy—for myself
	(Philippians 1:21; Philippians 1:23).
	His expectation of release from prison is much fainter, than in the
	Epistles to Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon, written somewhat
	earlier from Rome. The appointment of Tigellinus to be Prætorian
	Prefect was probably the cause of this change. See Philippians 1:23- :
rejoice with you all—ALFORD
	translates, "I congratulate you all," namely on the
	honor occurring to you by my blood being poured out on the sacrifice
	of your faith. If they rejoiced already (as English Version
	represents), what need of his urging them, "Do ye also
	joy."
