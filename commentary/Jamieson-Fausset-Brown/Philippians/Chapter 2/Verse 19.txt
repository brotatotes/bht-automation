19.  :-, "ye know the proof of him . . . that . . . he hath
	served with me," implies that Timothy had been long with Paul at
	Philippi; Accordingly, in the history (Acts 16:1-4;
	Acts 17:10; Acts 17:14),
	we find them setting out together from Derbe in Lycaonia, and
	together again at Berea in Macedonia, near the conclusion of
	Paul's missionary journey: an undesigned coincidence between
	the Epistle and history, a mark of genuineness [PALEY].
	From Philippians 2:19-30, it
	appears Epaphroditus was to set out at once to allay the anxiety of
	the Philippians on his account, and at the same time bearing the
	Epistle; Timothy was to follow after the apostle's liberation was
	decided, when they could arrange their plans more definitely as to
	where Timothy should, on his return with tidings from
	Philippi, meet Paul, who was designing by a wider circuit, and slower
	progress, to reach that city. Paul's reason for sending Timothy so
	soon after having heard of the Philippians from Epaphroditus was that
	they were now suffering persecutions (Philippians 2:19-50.2.30- :); and besides, Epaphroditus' delay through sickness on
	his journey to Rome from Philippi, made the tidings he brought to be
	of less recent date than Paul desired. Paul himself also hoped to
	visit them shortly. 
	But I trust—Yet my
	death is by no means certain; yea, "I hope (Greek)
	in the Lord (that is, by the Lord's help)" 
	unto you—literally,
	"for you," that is, to your satisfaction, not merely
	motion, to you.
I also—that not only
	you "may be of good courage" (so Greek) on
	hearing of me (Philippians 2:23), but
	"I also, when I know your state."
