<p><b>2. Fulfil</b>—that is, Make full.
	I have joy in you, <i>complete</i> it by that which is still wanting,
	namely, <i>unity</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:9">Philippians 1:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>likeminded</b>—literally,
	"that ye be of the same mind"; more general than the
	following "of one mind." 
	</p>
<p><b>having the same love</b>—equally
	disposed to love and be loved. 
	</p>
<p><b>being of one
	accord</b>—literally, "with united <i>souls.</i>" This
	pairs with the following clause, thus, "With united souls, being
	of one mind"; as the former two also pair together, "That
	ye be likeminded, having the same love."</p>
