<p><b>to send</b>—It was properly
	a <i>sending</i> Epaphroditus <i>back</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). But as he had come intending to stay some time with Paul,
	the latter uses the word "send" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>your messenger</b>—literally,
	"apostle." The "apostles" or "messengers <i>of

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span>), were distinct from the
	"apostles" specially commissioned <i>by Christ,</i> as the
	Twelve and Paul.

<p><b>ministered to my wants</b>—by
	conveying the contributions from Philippi. The <i>Greek</i>
	"<i>leitourgon,</i>" literally, implies <i>ministering in
	the ministerial office.</i> Probably Epaphroditus was a presbyter or
	else a deacon.</p>
