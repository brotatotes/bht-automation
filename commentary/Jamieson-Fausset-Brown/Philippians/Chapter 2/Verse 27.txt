<p><b>27.</b> Epaphroditus' sickness
	proves that the apostles had not ordinarily the <i>permanent</i> gift
	of miracles, any more than of inspiration: both were vouchsafed to
	them only for each particular occasion, as the Spirit thought fit. 
	</p>
<p><b>lest I should have sorrow
	upon sorrow</b>â€”namely, the sorrow of losing him by death, in
	addition to the sorrow of my imprisonment. Here only occurs anything
	of a sorrowful tone in this Epistle, which generally is most joyous.</p>
