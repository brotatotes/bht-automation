<p><b>3. </b><i><b>Let</b></i><b> nothing
	</b><i><b>be done</b></i><b> </b>—The italicized words are not in
	the <i>Greek.</i> Perhaps the ellipsis had better be supplied from
	the <i>Greek</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:2">Philippians 2:2</span>),
	"<i>Thinking</i> nothing in the way of strife" (or rather,
	"factious intrigue," "self-seeking," see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:2- :">Philippians 2:2- :</span>). It is the <i>thought</i> which characterizes the action as
	good or bad before God. 
	</p>
<p><b>lowliness of mind</b>—The
	<i>direct</i> relation of this grace is to God alone; it is the sense
	of dependence of the creature on the Creator as such, and it places
	all created beings in this respect on a level. The man "lowly of
	mind" as to his spiritual life is independent of men, and free
	from all slavish feeling, while sensible of his continual dependence
	on God. Still it INDIRECTLY
	affects his behavior toward his fellow men; for, conscious of his
	entire dependence on God for all his abilities, even as they are
	dependent on God for theirs, he will not pride himself on his
	abilities, or exalt self in his conduct toward others (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+4:2">Ephesians 4:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:12">Colossians 3:12</span>) [NEANDER].

<p><b>let each esteem</b>—Translate
	as <i>Greek,</i> "esteeming each other superior to <i>yourselves.</i>"
	Instead of fixing your eyes on those points in which you excel, fix
	them on those in which your neighbor excels you: this is true
	"humility."</p>
