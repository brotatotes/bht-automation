<p><b>5.</b> The oldest manuscripts read,
	"Have this mind in you," &amp;c. He does not put forward
	himself (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:4">Philippians 2:4</span>, and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:4- :">Philippians 2:4- :</span>) as an example, but Christ, THE
	ONE pre-eminently who sought not His own, but "humbled
	Himself" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:8">Philippians 2:8</span>), first
	in taking on Him our nature, secondly, in humbling Himself further in
	that nature (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:3">Romans 15:3</span>).</p>
