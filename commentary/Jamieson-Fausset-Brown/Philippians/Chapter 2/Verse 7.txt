7. made himself of no reputation,
	and . . . andâ€”rather as the Greek, "emptied
	Himself, taking upon him the form of a servant, being
	made in the likeness of men." The two latter clauses (there
	being no conjunctions, "and . . . and," in the Greek)
	expresses in what Christ's "emptying of Himself"
	consists, namely, in "taking the form of a servant" (see on
	 :-; compare Exodus 21:5;
	Exodus 21:6; Psalms 40:6,
	proving that it was at the time when He assumed a body, He
	took "the form of a servant"), and in order to
	explain how He took "the form of a servant," there
	is added, by "being made in the likeness of men." His
	subjection to the law (Luke 2:21;
	Galatians 4:4) and to His parents (Galatians 4:4- :), His low state as a carpenter, and carpenter's reputed son
	(Matthew 13:55; Mark 6:3),
	His betrayal for the price of a bond-servant (Mark 6:3- :), and slave-like death to relieve us from the slavery of
	sin and death, finally and chiefly, His servant-like dependence as
	man on God, while His divinity was not outwardly manifested
	(Isaiah 49:3; Isaiah 49:7),
	are all marks of His "form as a servant." This proves: (1)
	He was in the form of a servant as soon as He was made man. (2) He
	was "in the form of God" before He was "in the
	form of a servant." (3) He did as really subsist in the divine
	nature, as in the form of a servant, or in the nature of man. For He
	was as much "in the form of God" as "in the form of a
	servant"; and was so in the form of God as "to be on an
	equality with God"; He therefore could have been none other than
	God; for God saith, "To whom will ye liken Me and make Me
	equal?" (Isaiah 46:5),
	[BISHOP PEARSON].
	His emptying Himself presupposes His previous plenitude of
	Godhead (John 1:14; Colossians 1:19;
	Colossians 2:9). He remained full of
	this; yet He bore Himself as if He were empty.
