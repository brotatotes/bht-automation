<p><b>7. made himself of no reputation,
	and . . . and</b>â€”rather as the <i>Greek,</i> "<i>emptied</i>
	Himself, <i>taking</i> upon him the form of a servant, <i>being</i>
	made in the likeness of men." The two latter clauses (there
	being no conjunctions, "and . . . and," in the <i>Greek</i>)
	expresses <i>in what</i> Christ's "emptying of Himself"
	consists, namely, in "taking the form of a servant" (see on

	proving that it was at the time when He assumed a <i>body,</i> He
	took "the form of a <i>servant</i>"), and in order to
	explain <i>how</i> He took "the form of a servant," there
	is added, by "being made in the likeness of men." His

	His betrayal for the price of a bond-servant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+6:3- :">Mark 6:3- :</span>), and slave-like death to relieve us from the slavery of
	sin and death, finally and chiefly, <i>His servant-like dependence as
	man on God,</i> while His divinity was not outwardly manifested

	are all marks of His "form as a servant." This proves: (1)
	He was in the form of a servant as soon as He was made man. (2) He
	was "in the form of God" <i>before</i> He was "in the
	form of a servant." (3) He did as really subsist in the divine
	nature, as in the form of a servant, or in the nature of man. For He
	was as much "in the form of God" as "in the form of a
	servant"; and was so in the form of God as "to be on an
	equality with God"; He therefore could have been none other than
	God; for God saith, "To whom will ye liken Me and make Me
	equal?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+46:5">Isaiah 46:5</span>),

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:9">Colossians 2:9</span>). He remained full of
	this; yet He bore Himself as if He were <i>empty.</i></p>
