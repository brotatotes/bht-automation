<p><b>1. Finally</b>—rather, not with
	the notion of time, but making a transition to another general
	subject, "Furthermore" [BENGEL
	and WAHL] as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Literally, "As to what remains," c. It is often
	used at the conclusion of Epistles for "finally" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+6:10">Ephesians 6:10</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+3:1">2 Thessalonians 3:1</span>). But it is not
	restricted to this meaning, as ALFORD
	thinks, supposing that Paul used it here intending to close his
	Epistle, but was led by the mention of the Judaizers into a more
	lengthened dissertation. 
	</p>
<p><b>the same things</b>—concerning
	"rejoicing," the prevailing feature in this Epistle
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:18">Philippians 1:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:25">Philippians 1:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:17">Philippians 2:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:4">Philippians 4:4</span>,
	where, compare the "again I say," with "the same
	things" here). 
	</p>
<p><b>In the Lord</b>—marks the
	true ground of joy, in contrast with "having confidence in the
	flesh," or in any outward sensible matter of boasting (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:4- :">Philippians 4:4- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>not grievous</b>—"not
	irksome." 
	</p>
<p><b>for you it is safe</b>—Spiritual
	<i>joy</i> is the best safety against error (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:2">Philippians 3:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ne+8:10">Nehemiah 8:10</span>, end).</p>
