<p><b>10. That I may know
	him</b>—experimentally. The aim of the "righteousness"
	just mentioned. This verse resumes, and more fully explains, "the
	excellency of the knowledge of Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). To know HIM is
	more than merely to know a <i>doctrine</i> about Him. Believers are
	brought not only to redemption, but to the Redeemer Himself. 
	</p>
<p><b>the power of his
	resurrection</b>—assuring believers of their justification (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:17">1 Corinthians 15:17</span>), and raising them up
	spiritually with Him, by virtue of their identification with Him in
	this, as in all the acts of His redeeming work for us (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+6:4">Romans 6:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:12">Colossians 2:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span>).
	The power of the Divine Spirit, which raised Him from literal death,
	is the same which raises believers from spiritual death now (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20">Ephesians 1:20</span>), and shall raise their
	bodies from literal death hereafter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20- :">Ephesians 1:20- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>the fellowship of his
	sufferings</b>—by identification with Him in His sufferings and
	death, <i>by imputation;</i> also, in <i>actually</i> bearing the
	cross whatever is laid on us, after His example, and so "filling
	up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:20- :">Ephesians 1:20- :</span>); and in the <i>will</i> to bear aught for His sake (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:38">Matthew 10:38</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:24">Matthew 16:24</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11">2 Timothy 2:11</span>).
	As He bore all our sufferings (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:11- :">2 Timothy 2:11- :</span>), so we participate in His. 
	</p>
<p><b>made conformable unto his
	death</b>—"conformed to the likeness of His death,"
	namely, by continued sufferings for His sake, and mortifying of the
	carnal self (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:29">Romans 8:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:31">1 Corinthians 15:31</span>;
