<p><b>13. I</b>—whatever others count as
	to themselves. He who counts himself perfect, must deceive himself by
	calling sin infirmity (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+1:8">1 John 1:8</span>);
	at the same time, each must <i>aim</i> at perfection, to be a
	Christian at all (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+5:48">Matthew 5:48</span>).

	it, we are carried back. God's word to us is as it was to Israel,
	"Speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+14:15">Exodus 14:15</span>). The Bible is our

	The Christian is always humbled by the contrast between what he is
