<p><b>14. high calling</b>â€”literally,
	"the calling that is <i>above</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:1">Colossians 3:1</span>): "the <i>heavenly</i>
	calling" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+3:1">Hebrews 3:1</span>). "The
	prize" is "the crown of righteousness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8- :">2 Timothy 4:8- :</span>, "crown of life." <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8- :">2 Timothy 4:8- :</span>, "a crown of glory that fadeth not away." "The
	high," or "heavenly calling," is not restricted, as
	ALFORD thinks, to Paul's
	own calling as an apostle by the summons of God from heaven; but <i>the
	common calling of all Christians to salvation in Christ,</i> which
	coming from heaven invites us to heaven, whither accordingly our
	minds ought to be uplifted.</p>
