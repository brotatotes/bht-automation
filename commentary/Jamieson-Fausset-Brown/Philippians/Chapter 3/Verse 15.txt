<p><b>15. therefore</b>—resuming <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. "As many of us then, as are perfect," that is,
	<i>full grown</i> (no longer "babes") in the Christian life
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3">Philippians 3:3</span>, "worshipping God
	in the Spirit, and having no confidence in the flesh"), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3- :">Philippians 3:3- :</span>, fully established in things of God. Here, by "perfect,"
	he means one <i>fully fit for running</i> [BENGEL];
	knowing and complying with the <i>laws</i> of the course (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3- :">Philippians 3:3- :</span>). Though "perfect" in this sense, he was not yet
	"made perfect" (<i>Greek</i>) in the sense intended in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3- :">Philippians 3:3- :</span>, namely, "crowned with <i>complete</i> victory,"
	and having attained <i>absolute perfection.</i>
</p>
<p><b>thus minded</b>—having the
	mind which he had described, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3- :">Philippians 3:3- :</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>otherwise minded</b>—having
	too high an opinion of yourselves as to your attainment of Christian
	<i>perfection.</i> "He who thinks that he has attained
	everything, hath nothing" [CHRYSOSTOM].
	Probably, too, he refers to those who were tempted to think to attain
	to <i>perfection</i> by the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3- :">Philippians 3:3- :</span>): who needed the warning (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3- :">Philippians 3:3- :</span>), "Beware of the concision," though on account of
	their former piety, Paul hopes confidently (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:3- :">Philippians 3:3- :</span>) that God will reveal the path of right-mindedness to them.
	Paul taught externally God "reveals" the truth internally
	by His Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:25">Matthew 11:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+16:17">Matthew 16:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:6">1 Corinthians 3:6</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>unto you</b>—who sincerely
	strive to do God's will (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:17">John 7:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>).</p>
