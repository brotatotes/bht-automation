<p><b>16.</b> The expectation of a new
	revelation is not to make you less careful in walking according to
	whatever degree of knowledge of divine things and perfection you have
	already attained. God makes further revelations to those who walk up
	to the revelations they already have (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>rule, let us mind the same
	thing</b>â€”omitted in the oldest manuscripts. Perhaps partly
	inserted from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:16">Galatians 6:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+2:2">Philippians 2:2</span>.
	Translate then, "Whereunto we have attained, let us walk on (a
	military term, <i>march in order</i>) in the same (the measure of
	knowledge already attained)."</p>
