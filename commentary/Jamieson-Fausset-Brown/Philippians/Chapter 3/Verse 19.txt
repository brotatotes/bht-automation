	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:18">Romans 16:18</span>); hereafter to be
	destroyed by God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13">1 Corinthians 6:13</span>). In
	contrast to our "body" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:13- :">1 Corinthians 6:13- :</span>), which <i>our God,</i> the Lord Jesus, shall "fashion
	like unto His glorious body." Their belly is now pampered, our
	body now wasted; then the respective states of both shall be
	reversed.

<p><b>glory is in their shame</b>—As
	"glory" is often used in the Old Testament for <i>God</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+106:20">Psalms 106:20</span>), so here it
	answers to "whose God," in the parallel clause; and "shame"
	is the Old Testament term contemptuously given to an idol (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+106:20- :">Psalms 106:20- :</span>, <i>Margin</i>). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+4:7">Hosea 4:7</span>
	seems to be referred to by Paul (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+4:7- :">Hosea 4:7- :</span>). There seems no allusion to circumcision, as no longer
	<i>glorious,</i> but a <i>shame</i> to them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+4:7- :">Hosea 4:7- :</span>). The reference of the immediate context is to sensuality,
	and carnality in general.
