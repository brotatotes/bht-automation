19. destruction—everlasting at
	Christ's coming. Philippians 1:28,
	"perdition"; the opposite word is "Saviour" (Philippians 1:28- :). 
	end—fixed doom. 
	whose god is their belly—
	(Romans 16:18); hereafter to be
	destroyed by God (1 Corinthians 6:13). In
	contrast to our "body" (1 Corinthians 6:13- :), which our God, the Lord Jesus, shall "fashion
	like unto His glorious body." Their belly is now pampered, our
	body now wasted; then the respective states of both shall be
	reversed. 
	glory is in their shame—As
	"glory" is often used in the Old Testament for God
	(Psalms 106:20), so here it
	answers to "whose God," in the parallel clause; and "shame"
	is the Old Testament term contemptuously given to an idol (Psalms 106:20- :, Margin). Hosea 4:7
	seems to be referred to by Paul (compare Hosea 4:7- :). There seems no allusion to circumcision, as no longer
	glorious, but a shame to them (Hosea 4:7- :). The reference of the immediate context is to sensuality,
	and carnality in general. 
	mind earthly things—
	(Romans 8:5). In contrast to Philippians 3:20;
	Colossians 3:2.
