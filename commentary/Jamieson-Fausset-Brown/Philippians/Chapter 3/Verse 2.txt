<p><b>concision</b>—<i>Circumcision</i>
	had now lost its spiritual significance, and was now become to those
	who rested on it as any ground of justification, a senseless
	mutilation. Christians have the only true <i>circumcision,</i>
	namely, that of the heart; legalists have only "concision,"
	that is, <i>the cutting off of the flesh.</i> To make "cuttings
	in the flesh" was expressly prohibited by the law (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:15- :">2 Timothy 2:15- :</span>): it was a Gentile-heathenish practice (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:15- :">2 Timothy 2:15- :</span>); yet this, writes Paul indignantly, is what these
	<i>legalists</i> are virtually doing in violation of the law. There
	is a remarkable gradation, says BIRKS
	[<i>Horæ Apostolicæ</i>] in Paul's language as to circumcision. In
	his first recorded discourse (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:15- :">2 Timothy 2:15- :</span>), circumcision is not named, but implied as included in the
	law of Moses which cannot justify. Six or seven years later, in the
	Epistle to Galatians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+3:3">Galatians 3:3</span>),
	the first Epistle in which it is named, its spiritual inefficiency is
	maintained against those Gentiles who, beginning in the Spirit,
	thought to be perfected in the flesh. Later, in Epistle to Romans
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:28">Romans 2:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:29">Romans 2:29</span>),
	he goes farther, and claims the substance of it for every believer,
	assigning the shadow only of it to the unbelieving Jew. In Epistle to
	Colossians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:11">Colossians 2:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:11">Colossians 3:11</span>),
	still later, he expounds more fully the true circumcision as the
	exclusive privilege of the believer. Last of all here, the very name
	is denied to the legalist, and a term of reproach is substituted,
	"concision," or <i>flesh-cutting.</i> Once obligatory on
	all the covenant-people, then reduced to a mere national distinction,
	it was more and more associated in the apostle's experience with the
	open hostility of the Jews, and the perverse teaching of false
	brethren.</p>
