<p><b>20. our conversation</b>—rather,
	"our state" or "country"; <i>our citizenship: our
	life as citizens.</i> We are but <i>pilgrims</i> on earth; how <i>then</i>
	should we "mind earthly things?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:19">Philippians 3:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:9">Hebrews 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:10">Hebrews 11:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:13-16">Hebrews 11:13-16</span>). Roman
	citizenship was then highly prized; how much more should the heavenly
	citizenship (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+22:28">Acts 22:28</span>; compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:20">Luke 10:20</span>)?

<p><b>look for the Saviour, the

	Lord Jesus as a (that is, in the capacity of a) Saviour" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19- :">Romans 8:19- :</span>). That He is "the Lord," now exalted above every
	name, assures our expectation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19- :">Romans 8:19- :</span>). Our High Priest is gone up into the Holy of Holies not
	made with hands, there to atone for us; and as the Israelites stood
	outside the tabernacle, expecting Aaron's return (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:19- :">Romans 8:19- :</span>), so must we look unto the heavens expecting Christ thence.</p>
