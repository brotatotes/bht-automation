20. our conversation—rather,
	"our state" or "country"; our citizenship: our
	life as citizens. We are but pilgrims on earth; how then
	should we "mind earthly things?" (Philippians 3:19;
	Hebrews 11:9; Hebrews 11:10;
	Hebrews 11:13-16). Roman
	citizenship was then highly prized; how much more should the heavenly
	citizenship (Acts 22:28; compare

	is—Greek, "has
	its existence." 
	in heaven—Greek,

	is translated, Romans 8:19) the
	Lord Jesus as a (that is, in the capacity of a) Saviour" (Romans 8:19- :). That He is "the Lord," now exalted above every
	name, assures our expectation (Romans 8:19- :). Our High Priest is gone up into the Holy of Holies not
	made with hands, there to atone for us; and as the Israelites stood
	outside the tabernacle, expecting Aaron's return (compare Romans 8:19- :), so must we look unto the heavens expecting Christ thence.
