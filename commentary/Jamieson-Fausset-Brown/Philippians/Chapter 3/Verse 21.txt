<p><b>21.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "Who
	shall <i>transfigure</i> the body <i>of our humiliation</i> (namely,
	in which our humiliation has place, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:19">Ephesians 2:19</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:12">2 Timothy 2:12</span>),
	that it may be <i>conformed</i> unto the body <i>of His glory</i>
	(namely, in which His glory is manifested), according to the
	<i>effectual working</i> whereby," c. Not only shall He come as
	our "Saviour," but also as our <i>Glorifier.</i>
</p>
<p><b>even</b>â€”not only to make
	<i>the body</i> like His own, but "to subdue <i>all things,</i>"
	even death itself, as well as Satan and sin. He gave a sample of the
	coming <i>transfiguration</i> on the mount (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:12- :">2 Timothy 2:12- :</span>, &amp;c.). Not a change of <i>identity,</i> but of <i>fashion</i>
	or <i>form</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+17:15">Psalms 17:15</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+15:51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>). Our spiritual
	resurrection now is the pledge of our bodily resurrection to glory
	hereafter (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20">Philippians 3:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11">Romans 8:11</span>).
	As Christ's glorified body was essentially identical with His body of
	humiliation; so our resurrection bodies as believers, since they
	shall be like His, shall be identical essentially with our present
	bodies, and yet "spiritual bodies" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+8:11- :">Romans 8:11- :</span>). Our "hope" is, that Christ, by His rising
	from the dead, hath obtained the power, and is become the pattern, of
	our resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+2:13">Micah 2:13</span>).</p>
