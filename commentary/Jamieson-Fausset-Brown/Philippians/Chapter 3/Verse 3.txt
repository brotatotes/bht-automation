<p><b>worship God in the Spirit</b>—The

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:24">John 4:24</span>). Legal worship was
	outward, and consisted in outward acts, restricted to certain times
	and places. Christian worship is <i>spiritual,</i> flowing from the
	inworkings of the Holy Spirit, not relating to certain isolated acts,
	but embracing the whole life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:24- :">John 4:24- :</span>). In the former, men trusted in something human, whether
	descent from the theocratic nation, or the righteousness of the law,
	or mortification of "the flesh" ("Having confidence,"
	or "glorying in the flesh") [NEANDER]
