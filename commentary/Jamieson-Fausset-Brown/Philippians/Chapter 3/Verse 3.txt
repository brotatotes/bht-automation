3. "We are the (real)
	circumcision" (Romans 2:25-29;
	Colossians 2:11). 
	worship God in the Spirit—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "worship by the Spirit of God";
	our religious service is rendered by the Spirit (John 4:23;
	John 4:24). Legal worship was
	outward, and consisted in outward acts, restricted to certain times
	and places. Christian worship is spiritual, flowing from the
	inworkings of the Holy Spirit, not relating to certain isolated acts,
	but embracing the whole life (John 4:24- :). In the former, men trusted in something human, whether
	descent from the theocratic nation, or the righteousness of the law,
	or mortification of "the flesh" ("Having confidence,"
	or "glorying in the flesh") [NEANDER]
	(Romans 1:9). 
	rejoice in Christ Jesus—"make
	our boast in Christ Jesus," not in the law: the ground of
	their boasting. 
	have no confidence in the
	flesh—but in the Spirit.
