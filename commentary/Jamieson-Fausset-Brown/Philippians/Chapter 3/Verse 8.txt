<p><b>8. Yea doubtless</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts omit "doubtless" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>ge</i>"):
	translate, "nay more." Not only "<i>have</i> I
	counted" <i>those</i> things just mentioned "loss for
	Christ's sake, but, moreover, I <i>even</i> DO
	count ALL things but
	loss," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>for the excellency</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"On account of the surpassing excellency (the supereminence
	above them all) of the knowledge of Christ Jesus." 
	</p>
<p><b>my Lord</b>—believing and
	loving appropriation of Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+63:1">Psalms 63:1</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28">John 20:28</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>for whom</b>—"on
	account of whom." 
	</p>
<p><b>I have suffered the loss</b>—not
	merely I "<i>counted</i>" them "loss," but have
	actually lost them. 
	</p>
<p><b>all things</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	has the article, referring to the preceding "all things";
	"I have suffered the loss of <i>them all.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>dung</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"refuse (such as excrements, dregs, dross) <i>cast to the dogs,</i>"
	as the derivation expresses. A "loss" is of something
	having value; but "refuse" is thrown away as not worthy of
	being any more touched or looked at.

<p><b>win</b>—Translate, to
	accord with the translation, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+20:28- :">John 20:28- :</span>, "<i>gain</i> Christ." A man cannot make other
	things his "gain" or chief confidence, and at the same time
	"gain Christ." He who loses all things, and even himself,
	on account of Christ, gains Christ: Christ is His, and He is Christ's
