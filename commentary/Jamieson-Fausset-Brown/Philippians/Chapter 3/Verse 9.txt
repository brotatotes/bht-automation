<p><b>righteousness . . . of God by
	faith</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "which is <i>from</i> God (resting)
	<i>upon</i> faith." Paul was transported from legal bondage into
	Christian freedom at once, and without any gradual transition. Hence,
	the bands of Pharisaism were loosed instantaneously; and opposition
	to Pharisaic Judaism took the place of opposition to the Gospel. Thus
	God's providence fitly prepared him for the work of overthrowing all
	idea of legal justification. "The righteousness of faith,"
	in Paul's sense, is the righteousness or perfect holiness of Christ
	appropriated by faith, as the <i>objective</i> ground of confidence
	for the believer, and also as a new <i>subjective</i> principle of
	life. Hence it includes the essence of a new disposition, and may
	easily pass into the idea of sanctification, though the two ideas are
	originally distinct. It is not any arbitrary act of God, as if he
	treated as sinless a man persisting in sin, simply because he
	believes in Christ; but the <i>objective</i> on the part of God
	corresponds to the <i>subjective</i> on the part of man, namely,
	faith. The realization of the archetype of holiness through Christ
	contains the pledge that this shall be realized in all who are one
	with Him by faith, and are become the organs of His Spirit. Its germ
	is imparted to them in believing although the fruit of a life
	perfectly conformed to the Redeemer, can only be gradually developed
	in this life [NEANDER].</p>
