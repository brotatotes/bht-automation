<p><b>11. I have learned</b>—The <i>I</i>
	in <i>Greek</i> is emphatical. I leave it to others if they will, to
	be discontented. <i>I,</i> for my part, have learned, by the teaching
	of the Holy Spirit, and the dealings of Providence (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), to be content in every state. 
	</p>
<p><b>content</b>—The <i>Greek,</i>
	literally expresses "independent of others, and having
	<i>sufficiency in one's self.</i>" But Christianity has raised
	the term above the haughty <i>self-sufficiency</i> of the heathen
	Stoic to the <i>contentment</i> of the Christian, whose <i>sufficiency</i>
	is not in <i>self,</i> but in <i>God</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:5">2 Corinthians 3:5</span>;
