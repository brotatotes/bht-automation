11. I have learned—The I
	in Greek is emphatical. I leave it to others if they will, to
	be discontented. I, for my part, have learned, by the teaching
	of the Holy Spirit, and the dealings of Providence ( :-), to be content in every state. 
	content—The Greek,
	literally expresses "independent of others, and having
	sufficiency in one's self." But Christianity has raised
	the term above the haughty self-sufficiency of the heathen
	Stoic to the contentment of the Christian, whose sufficiency
	is not in self, but in God (2 Corinthians 3:5;
	1 Timothy 6:6; 1 Timothy 6:8;
	Hebrews 13:5; compare Jeremiah 2:36;
	Jeremiah 45:5).
