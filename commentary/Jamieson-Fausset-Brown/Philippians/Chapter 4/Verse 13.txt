<p><b>13. I can do all things</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>I have strength for all things</i>"; not merely "how
	to be abased and how to abound." After special instances he
	declares his <i>universal</i> power—how triumphantly, yet how
	humbly! [MEYER]. 
	</p>
<p><b>through Christ which
	strengtheneth me</b>—The oldest manuscripts omit "Christ";
	then translate, "In <i>Him</i> who giveth me <i>power,</i>"
	that is, by virtue of my living union and identification with Him,
	who is my strength (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:20">Galatians 2:20</span>).
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+1:12">1 Timothy 1:12</span>, whence
	probably, "Christ" was inserted here by transcribers.</p>
