13. I can do all things—Greek,
	"I have strength for all things"; not merely "how
	to be abased and how to abound." After special instances he
	declares his universal power—how triumphantly, yet how

	through Christ which
	strengtheneth me—The oldest manuscripts omit "Christ";
	then translate, "In Him who giveth me power,"
	that is, by virtue of my living union and identification with Him,
	who is my strength (Galatians 2:20).
	Compare 1 Timothy 1:12, whence
	probably, "Christ" was inserted here by transcribers.
