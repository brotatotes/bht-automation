<p><b>15. Now</b>—"Moreover."
	Arrange as <i>Greek,</i> "Ye also know (as well as I do
	myself)." 
	</p>
<p><b>in the beginning of the
	gospel</b>—dating from the <i>Philippian</i> Christian era; at the
	first preaching of the Gospel at Philippi. 
	</p>
<p><b>when I departed from
	Macedonia</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+17:14">Acts 17:14</span>).
	The Philippians had followed Paul with their bounty when he left
	Macedonia and came to Corinth. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:8">2 Corinthians 11:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:9">2 Corinthians 11:9</span> thus accords with the
	passage here, the dates assigned to the donation in both Epistles
	agreeing; namely, "in the <i>beginning</i> of the Gospel"
	here, and there, at the time of his <i>first</i> visit to Corinth
	[PALEY, <i>Horæ Paulinæ</i>].
	However, the supply meant here is not that which he received at
	Corinth, but the supply sent to him when "in Thessalonica, once
	and again" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:16">Philippians 4:16</span>),
	[ALFORD].

<p><b>as concerning giving and
	receiving</b>—In the account between us, "the giving" was
	all on your part; "the receiving" all on mine. 
	</p>
<p><b>ye only</b>—We are not to
	wait for others in a good work, saying, "I will do so, when
	others do it." We must go forward, though <i>alone.</i></p>
