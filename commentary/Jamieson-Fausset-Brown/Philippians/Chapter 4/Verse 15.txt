15. Now—"Moreover."
	Arrange as Greek, "Ye also know (as well as I do
	myself)." 
	in the beginning of the
	gospel—dating from the Philippian Christian era; at the
	first preaching of the Gospel at Philippi. 
	when I departed from
	Macedonia— (Acts 17:14).
	The Philippians had followed Paul with their bounty when he left
	Macedonia and came to Corinth. 2 Corinthians 11:8;
	2 Corinthians 11:9 thus accords with the
	passage here, the dates assigned to the donation in both Epistles
	agreeing; namely, "in the beginning of the Gospel"
	here, and there, at the time of his first visit to Corinth
	[PALEY, Horæ Paulinæ].
	However, the supply meant here is not that which he received at
	Corinth, but the supply sent to him when "in Thessalonica, once
	and again" (Philippians 4:16),
	[ALFORD]. 
	as concerning giving and
	receiving—In the account between us, "the giving" was
	all on your part; "the receiving" all on mine. 
	ye only—We are not to
	wait for others in a good work, saying, "I will do so, when
	others do it." We must go forward, though alone.
