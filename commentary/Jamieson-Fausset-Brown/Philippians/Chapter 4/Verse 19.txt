19. my—Paul calls God here "my
	God," to imply that God would reward their bounty to HIS
	servant, by "fully supplying" (translate so, literally,
	fill to the full) their every "need" ( :-), even as they had "fully" supplied his "need"
	(Philippians 4:16; Philippians 4:18).
	My Master will fully repay you; I cannot. The Philippians invested
	their bounty well since it got them such a glorious return. 
	according to his riches—The
	measure of His supply to you will be the immeasurable "riches of
	His grace" (Ephesians 1:7). 
	in glory—These words
	belong to the whole sentence. "Glory" is the element in
	which His rich grace operates; and it will be the element IN which He
	will "supply fully all your need." 
	by Christ Jesus—by
	virtue of your being "IN" (so Greek, not "by")
	Christ Jesus, the Giver and Mediator of all spiritual blessings.
