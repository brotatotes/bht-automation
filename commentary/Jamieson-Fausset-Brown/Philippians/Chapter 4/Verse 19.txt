<p><b>19. my</b>—Paul calls God here "my
	God," to imply that God would reward their bounty to HIS
	servant, by "fully supplying" (translate so, literally,
	<i>fill to the full</i>) their every "need" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), even as they had "fully" supplied his "need"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:16">Philippians 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:18">Philippians 4:18</span>).
	My Master will fully repay you; I cannot. The Philippians invested
	their bounty well since it got them such a glorious return. 
	</p>
<p><b>according to his riches</b>—The
	measure of His supply to you will be the immeasurable "riches of
	His grace" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:7">Ephesians 1:7</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in glory</b>—These words
	belong to the whole sentence. "Glory" is the element in
	which His rich grace operates; and it will be the element IN which He
	will "supply fully all your need." 
	</p>
<p><b>by Christ Jesus</b>—by
	virtue of your being "IN" (so <i>Greek,</i> not "by")
	Christ Jesus, the Giver and Mediator of all spiritual blessings.</p>
