<p><b>3. And</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "Yea."
	</p>
<p><b>true yoke-fellow</b>—yoked
	with me in the same Gospel yoke (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:29">Matthew 11:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+11:30">Matthew 11:30</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:17">1 Timothy 5:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:18">1 Timothy 5:18</span>). Either Timothy, Silas
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:40">Acts 15:40</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19">Acts 16:19</span>,
	<i>at Philippi</i>), or the chief bishop of Philippi. Or else the
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>Sunzugus,</i>" or "<i>Synzygus,</i>"
	is a proper name: "Who art truly, as thy name means, a
	<i>yoke-fellow.</i>" Certainly not <i>Paul's wife,</i> as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19- :">Acts 16:19- :</span> implies he had none. 
	</p>
<p><b>help those women</b>—rather,
	as <i>Greek,</i> "help <i>them,</i>" namely, Euodia and
	Syntyche. "Co-operate with them" [BIRKS];
	or as ALFORD, "Help
	in the work of their reconciliation." 
	</p>
<p><b>which laboured with
	me</b>—"<i>inasmuch</i> as they labored with me." At
	Philippi, women were the first hearers of the Gospel, and Lydia the
	first convert. It is a coincidence which marks genuineness, that in
	this Epistle alone, special instructions are given to women who
	labored with Paul in the Gospel. In selecting the first teachers,
	those first converted would naturally be fixed on. Euodia and
	Syntyche were doubtless two of "the women who resorted to the
	riverside, where prayer was wont to be made" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:19- :">Acts 16:19- :</span>), and being early converted, would naturally take an active
	part in teaching other women called at a later period; of course not
	in public preaching, but in a less prominent sphere (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:11">1 Timothy 2:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Clement</b>—bishop of Rome
	shortly after the death of Peter and Paul. His Epistle from the
	Church of Rome to the Church of Corinth is extant. It makes no
	mention of the supremacy of the See of Peter. He was the most eminent
	of the apostolical fathers. ALFORD
	thinks that the Clement here was <i>a Philippian,</i> and not
	necessarily Clement, bishop of Rome. But ORIGEN
	[<i>Commentary,</i> John 1:29] identifies the Clement here with the
	bishop of Rome.

<p><b>in the book of life</b>—the
	register-book of those whose "citizenship is in heaven"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+10:20">Luke 10:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:20">Philippians 3:20</span>).
	Anciently, free cities had a roll book containing the names of all
	those having the right of citizenship (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+32:32">Exodus 32:32</span>;
