<p><b>6.</b> Translate, "Be anxious

	and water [BENGEL].

<p><b>by prayer and
	supplication</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "by <i>the</i> prayer and <i>the</i>
	supplication" appropriate to each case [ALFORD].
	<i>Prayer</i> for blessings; and the general term. <i>Supplication,</i>
	to avert ills; a special term, <i>suppliant entreaty</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>thanksgiving</b>—for every
	event, prosperity and affliction alike (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:18">1 Thessalonians 5:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:13">James 5:13</span>). The Philippians might
	remember Paul's example at Philippi when in the innermost prison (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:13- :">James 5:13- :</span>). Thanksgiving gives effect to prayer (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+5:13- :">James 5:13- :</span>), and frees from <i>anxious carefulness</i> by making all
	God's dealings matter for <i>praise,</i> not merely for <i>resignation,</i>
	much less <i>murmuring.</i> "Peace" is the companion of
	"thanksgiving" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>;

<p><b>let your requests be made
	known unto God</b>—with generous, filial, unreserved confidence;
	not keeping aught back, as too great, or else too small, to bring
	before God, though you might feel so as to your fellow men. So Jacob,
	when fearing Esau (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+3:15- :">Colossians 3:15- :</span>); Hezekiah fearing Sennacherib (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+19:14">2 Kings 19:14</span>;
