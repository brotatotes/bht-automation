7. And—The inseparable
	consequence of thus laying everything before God in "prayer with
	thanksgiving." 
	peace—the dispeller of
	"anxious care" (Philippians 4:6).
	of God—coming from God,
	and resting in God (John 14:27;
	John 16:33; Colossians 3:15).
	passeth—surpasseth,
	or exceedeth, all man's notional powers of understanding its
	full blessedness (1 Corinthians 2:9;
	1 Corinthians 2:10; Ephesians 3:20;
	compare Proverbs 3:17). 
	shall keep—rather,
	"shall guard"; shall keep as a well-garrisoned
	stronghold (Isaiah 26:1; Isaiah 26:3).
	The same Greek verb is used in Isaiah 26:3- :. There shall be peace secure within, whatever outward
	troubles may besiege. 
	hearts and minds—rather,
	"hearts (the seat of the thoughts) and thoughts"
	or purposes. 
	through—rather as
	Greek, "in Christ Jesus." It is in Christ
	that we are "kept" or "guarded" secure.
