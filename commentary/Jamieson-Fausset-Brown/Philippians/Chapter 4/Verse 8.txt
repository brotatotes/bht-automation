<p><b>8.</b> Summary of all his
	exhortations as to relative duties, whether as children or parents,
	husbands or wives, friends, neighbors, men in the intercourse of the
	world, c. 
	</p>
<p><b>true</b>—sincere, <i>in
	words.</i>
</p>
<p><b>honest</b>—<i>Old</i>
	English for "seemly," namely, <i>in action</i> literally,
	<i>grave, dignified.</i>
</p>
<p><b>just</b>—towards <i>others.</i>
</p>
<p><b>pure</b>—"chaste,"
	in relation to <i>ourselves.</i>
</p>
<p><b>lovely</b>—lovable (compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+10:21">Mark 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:4">Luke 7:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+7:5">Luke 7:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>of good report</b>—referring
	to the <i>absent</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27">Philippians 1:27</span>);
	as "lovely" refers to what is lovable <i>face to face.</i>
</p>
<p><b>if there be any
	virtue</b>—"whatever virtue there is" [ALFORD].
	"Virtue," the standing word in heathen ethics, is found
	once only in Paul's Epistles, and once in Peter's (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:27- :">Philippians 1:27- :</span>); and this in uses different from those in heathen authors.
	It is a term rather earthly and human, as compared with the names of
	the spiritual graces which Christianity imparts; hence the rarity of
	its occurrence in the New Testament. Piety and true morality are
	inseparable. Piety is love with its face towards God; morality is
	love with its face towards man. Despise not anything that is good in
	itself; only let it keep its due place. 
	</p>
<p><b>praise</b>—whatever is
	<i>praiseworthy;</i> not that Christians should make man's praise
	their aim (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:43">John 12:43</span>);
	but they should live so as to <i>deserve</i> men's praise. 
	</p>
<p><b>think on</b>—have a
	continual regard to, so as to "do" these things (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+12:43- :">John 12:43- :</span>) whenever the occasion arises.</p>
