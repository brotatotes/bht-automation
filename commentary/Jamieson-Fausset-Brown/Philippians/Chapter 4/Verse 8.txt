8. Summary of all his
	exhortations as to relative duties, whether as children or parents,
	husbands or wives, friends, neighbors, men in the intercourse of the
	world, c. 
	true—sincere, in
	words.
honest—Old
	English for "seemly," namely, in action literally,
	grave, dignified.
just—towards others.
pure—"chaste,"
	in relation to ourselves.
lovely—lovable (compare
	Mark 10:21; Luke 7:4;
	Luke 7:5). 
	of good report—referring
	to the absent (Philippians 1:27);
	as "lovely" refers to what is lovable face to face.
if there be any
	virtue—"whatever virtue there is" [ALFORD].
	"Virtue," the standing word in heathen ethics, is found
	once only in Paul's Epistles, and once in Peter's (Philippians 1:27- :); and this in uses different from those in heathen authors.
	It is a term rather earthly and human, as compared with the names of
	the spiritual graces which Christianity imparts; hence the rarity of
	its occurrence in the New Testament. Piety and true morality are
	inseparable. Piety is love with its face towards God; morality is
	love with its face towards man. Despise not anything that is good in
	itself; only let it keep its due place. 
	praise—whatever is
	praiseworthy; not that Christians should make man's praise
	their aim (compare John 12:43);
	but they should live so as to deserve men's praise. 
	think on—have a
	continual regard to, so as to "do" these things (John 12:43- :) whenever the occasion arises.
