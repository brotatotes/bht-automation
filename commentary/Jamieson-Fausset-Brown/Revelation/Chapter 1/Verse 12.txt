	The stand holding the lamp. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:31">Exodus 25:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+25:32">Exodus 25:32</span>, the seven are united in
	ONE candlestick or
	lamp-stand, that is, six arms and a central shaft; so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:2">Zechariah 4:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:11">Zechariah 4:11</span>. Here the seven are
	<i>separate</i> candlesticks, typifying, as that <i>one,</i> the
	entire Church, but now no longer as the Jewish Church (represented by
	the <i>one</i> sevenfold candlestick) restricted to one outward unity
	and one place; the several churches are mutually independent as to
	external ceremonies and government (provided all things are done to
	edification, and schisms or needless separations are avoided), yet
	one in the unity of the Spirit and the Headship of Christ. The
	candlestick is not light, but the bearer of light, holding it forth
	to give light around. The light is the Lord's, not the Church's; from
	Him she receives it. She is to be a light-bearer to His glory. The
	candlestick stood in the holy place, the type of the Church on earth,
	as the holiest place was type of the Church in heaven. The holy
	place's only light was derived from the candlestick, daylight being
	excluded; so the Lord God is the Church's only light; hers is the
	light of grace, not nature. "Golden" symbolizes at once the
	greatest <i>preciousness</i> and <i>sacredness;</i> so that in the
	<i>Zend Avesta,</i> "golden" is synonymous with heavenly or
	divine [TRENCH].</p>
