<p><b>Son of man</b>—The form
	which John had seen enduring the agony of Gethsemane, and the shame
	and anguish of Calvary, he now sees glorified. His glory (as <i>Son

	humiliation as <i>Son of man.</i>

<p><b>down to the foot</b>—a mark
	of high rank. The garment and girdle seem to be emblems of His
	<i>priesthood.</i> Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+28:2">Exodus 28:2</span>;

	<i>Septuagint.</i> Aaron's robe and girdle were "for glory and
	beauty," and combined the insignia of royalty and priesthood,
	the characteristics of Christ's antitypical priesthood "after
	the order of Melchisedec." His being <i>in the midst of the
	candlesticks</i> (only seen in the <i>temple</i>), shows that it is
	as a <i>king-priest</i> He is so attired. This priesthood He has
	exercised ever since His ascension; and, therefore He here wears its
	emblems. As Aaron wore these insignia when He came forth from the
	sanctuary to bless the people (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:4">Leviticus 16:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:23">Leviticus 16:23</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+16:24">Leviticus 16:24</span>,
	the <i>chetoneth,</i> or holy linen coat), so when Christ shall come
	again, He shall appear in the similar attire of "beauty and
	glory" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:2">Isaiah 4:2</span>, <i>Margin</i>).
	The angels are attired somewhat like their Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:2- :">Isaiah 4:2- :</span>). The ordinary girding for one actively engaged, was at <i>the
	loins;</i> but JOSEPHUS
	[<i>Antiquities,</i>3.7.2], expressly tells us that the Levitical
	priests were girt higher up, about the breasts or <i>paps,</i>
	appropriate to calm, majestic movement. The girdle bracing the frame
	together, symbolizes collected powers. <i>Righteousness</i> and
	<i>faithfulness</i> are Christ's girdle. The high priest's girdle was
	only interwoven with gold, but Christ's is all of gold; the antitype
	exceeds the type.</p>
