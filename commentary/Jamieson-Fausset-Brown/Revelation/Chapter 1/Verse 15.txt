<p><b>15. fine brass</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>chalcolibanus,</i>" derived by some from two <i>Greek</i>
	words, "brass" and "frankincense"; derived by
	BOCHART from <i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>chalcos,</i>" "brass," and <i>Hebrew,</i>
	"<i>libbeen,</i>" "to whiten"; hence, "brass,"
	which in the furnace has reached a <i>white</i> heat. Thus it answers
	to "burnished (flashing, or glowing) brass," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:7">Ezekiel 1:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:1">Revelation 10:1</span>, "His feet as
	pillars <i>of fire.</i>" Translate, "<i>Glowing</i> brass,
	as if they had been made fiery (red-hot) in a furnace." The feet
	of the priests were bare in ministering in the sanctuary. So our
	great High Priest here.
