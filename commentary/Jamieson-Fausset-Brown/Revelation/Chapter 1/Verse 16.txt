	converting winning power, is the prominent point. Still, as He
	encourages the churches, as well as threatens, the former quality of
	the Word is not excluded. Its <i>two</i> edges (back and front) may
	allude to its double efficacy, condemning some, converting others.

	notices that this description, sublime as a purely mental conception,
	would be intolerable if we were to give it an outward form. With the
	Greeks, æsthecial taste was the first consideration, to which all
	others must give way. With the Hebrews, truth and the full
	representation ideally of the religious reality were the paramount
	consideration, that representation being designed not to be outwardly
	embodied, but to remain a purely mental conception. This exalting of
	the essence above the form marks their deeper religious earnestness.</p>
