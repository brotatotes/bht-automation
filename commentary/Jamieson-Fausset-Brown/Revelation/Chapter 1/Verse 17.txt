<p><b>laid his right hand upon
	me</b>—So the same Lord Jesus did at the Transfiguration to the
	three prostrate disciples, of whom John was one, saying, Be not
	afraid. The "touch" of His hand, as of old, imparted
	strength.

	enduring to eternity: "the First by creation, the Last by
	retribution: the First, because before Me there was no God formed;
	the Last, because after Me there shall be no other: the First,
	because from Me are all things; the Last, because to Me all things
