<p><b>alive for evermore</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"living unto the ages of ages": not merely "<i>I
	live,</i>" but I have life, and am the source of it to My
	people. "To Him belongs <i>absolute</i> being, as contrasted
	with the <i>relative</i> being of the creature; others may <i>share,</i>
	He only <i>hath</i> immortality: <i>being in essence, not by mere
	participation, immortal</i>" [THEODORET
	in TRENCH]. One oldest
	manuscript, with <i>English Version,</i> reads Amen." Two
	others, and most of the oldest versions and Fathers, omit it. His
	having passed through death as one of us, and now living in the
	infinite plenitude of life, reassures His people, since through Him
	death is the gate of resurrection to eternal life.
