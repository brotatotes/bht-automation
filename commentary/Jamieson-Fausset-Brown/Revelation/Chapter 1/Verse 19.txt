<p><b>19.</b> The oldest manuscripts read,
	"Write <i>therefore</i>" (inasmuch as I, "the First
	and Last," have the keys of death, and vouchsafe to thee this
	vision for the comfort and warning of the Church). 
	</p>
<p><b>things which are</b>â€”"the
	things which thou hast seen" are those narrated in this chapter
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:11">Revelation 1:11</span>). "The
	things which are" imply the present state of things in the
	churches when John was writing, as represented in the second and
	third chapters. "The things which shall be hereafter," the
	things symbolically represented concerning the future history of the
	fourth through twenty-second chapters. ALFORD
	translates, "<i>What</i> things they <i>signify</i>"; but
	the antithesis of the next clause forbids this, "the things
	which shall be hereafter," <i>Greek,</i> "which are about
	to come to pass." The <i>plural</i> (<i>Greek</i>) "are,"
	instead of the usual Greek construction <i>singular,</i> is owing to
	<i>churches</i> and <i>persons</i> being meant by things" in the
	clause, "the things which are."</p>
