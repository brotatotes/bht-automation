	candlesticks—in apposition to, and explaining, "the things
	which thou hast seen," governed by "Write." Mystery
	signifies the hidden truth, veiled under this symbol, and now
	revealed; its correlative is revelation. Stars symbolize
	lordship (Numbers 24:17; compare Numbers 24:17- :, of faithful teachers; Revelation 8:10;
	Revelation 12:4; Judges 1:13).
	angels—not as ALFORD,
	from ORIGEN [Homily 13
	on Luke, and Homily 20 on Numbers], the guardian angels of the
	churches, just as individuals have their guardian angels. For how
	could heavenly angels be charged with the delinquencies laid here to
	the charge of these angels? Then, if a human angel be meant (as the
	Old Testament analogy favors, Judges 1:13- :, "the Lord's Messenger in the Lord's message";
	Malachi 2:7; Malachi 3:1),
	the bishop, or superintendent pastor, must be the angel. For
	whereas there were many presbyters in each of the larger churches (as
	for example, Ephesus, Smyrna, c.), there was but one angel,
	whom, moreover, the Chief Shepherd and Bishop of souls holds
	responsible for the spiritual state of the Church under him. The term
	angel, designating an office, is, in accordance with the
	enigmatic symbolism of this book, transferred from the heavenly to
	the earthly superior ministers of Jehovah reminding them that, like
	the heavenly angels above, they below should fulfil God's mission
	zealously, promptly and efficiently. "Thy will be done on earth,
	as it is in heaven!"
