	signifies the hidden truth, veiled under this symbol, and now

<p><b>angels</b>—not as ALFORD,
	from ORIGEN [<i>Homily 13</i>
	on Luke, and <i>Homily 20</i> on Numbers], the guardian angels of the
	churches, just as individuals have their guardian angels. For how
	could heavenly angels be charged with the delinquencies laid here to
	the charge of these angels? Then, if a human angel be meant (as the
	Old Testament analogy favors, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:13- :">Judges 1:13- :</span>, "the Lord's Messenger in the Lord's message";
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+2:7">Malachi 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+3:1">Malachi 3:1</span>),
	<i>the bishop,</i> or superintendent pastor, must be the angel. For
	whereas there were many presbyters in each of the larger churches (as
	for example, Ephesus, Smyrna, c.), there was but <i>one</i> angel,
	whom, moreover, the Chief Shepherd and Bishop of souls holds
	responsible for the spiritual state of the Church under him. The term
	<i>angel,</i> designating an office, is, in accordance with the
	enigmatic symbolism of this book, transferred from the heavenly to
	the earthly superior ministers of Jehovah reminding them that, like
	the heavenly angels above, they below should fulfil God's mission
	zealously, promptly and efficiently. "Thy will be done on earth,
	as it is in heaven!"</p>
