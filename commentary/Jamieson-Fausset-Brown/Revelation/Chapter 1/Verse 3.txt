3. he that readeth, and they that
	hearâ€”namely, the public reader in Church assemblies, and
	his hearers. In the first instance, he by whom John sent the
	book from Patmos to the seven churches, read it publicly: a usage
	most scriptural and profitable. A special blessing attends him
	who reads or hears the apocalyptic "prophecy"
	with a view to keeping the things therein (as there is but one
	article to "they that hear and keep those things," not two
	classes, but only one is meant: "they who not only hear, but
	also keep those things,"  :-); even though he find not the key to its interpretation, he
	finds a stimulus to faith, hope, and patient waiting for Christ.
	Note: the term "prophecy" has relation to the human medium
	or prophet inspired, here John: "Revelation" to the
	Divine Being who reveals His will, here Jesus Christ. God gave the
	revelation to Jesus: He by His angel revealed it to John, who was to
	make it known to the Church.
