<p><b>3. he that readeth, and they that
	hear</b>â€”namely, the <i>public reader</i> in Church assemblies, and
	<i>his hearers.</i> In the first instance, he by whom John sent the
	book from Patmos to the seven churches, read it publicly: a usage
	most scriptural and profitable. A special <i>blessing</i> attends him
	who <i>reads</i> or <i>hears</i> the apocalyptic "prophecy"
	with a view to <i>keeping</i> the things therein (as there is but one
	article to "they that hear and keep those things," not two
	classes, but only one is meant: "they who not only hear, but
	also keep those things," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); even though he find not the key to its interpretation, he
	finds a stimulus to faith, hope, and patient waiting for Christ.
	Note: the term "prophecy" has relation to the human medium
	or <i>prophet</i> inspired, here John: "Revelation" to the
	Divine Being who reveals His will, here Jesus Christ. God gave the
	revelation to Jesus: He by His angel revealed it to John, who was to
	make it known to the Church.</p>
