<p><b>4. John</b>—the apostle. For none
	but he (supposing the writer an honest man) would thus sign himself
	nakedly without addition. As sole survivor and representative of the
	apostles and eye-witnesses of the Lord, he needed no designation save
	his name, to be recognized by his readers. 
	</p>
<p><b>seven churches</b>—not that
	there were not more churches in that region, but the number <i>seven</i>
	is fixed on as representing <i>totality.</i> These <i>seven</i>
	represent the universal Church of all times and places. See TRENCH'S
	[<i>Commentary on the Epistles to the Seven Churches in Asia</i>]
	interesting note, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>, on
	the number <i>seven.</i> It is the <i>covenant number,</i> the sign
	of God's covenant relation to mankind, and especially to the Church.
	Thus, the <i>seventh day,</i> sabbath (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:3">Genesis 2:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+20:12">Ezekiel 20:12</span>). Circumcision, the
	sign of the covenant, after <i>seven</i> days (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+20:12- :">Ezekiel 20:12- :</span>). Sacrifices (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+23:1">Numbers 23:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+14:29">Numbers 14:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ch+29:21">2 Chronicles 29:21</span>).
	Compare also God's acts typical of His covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jos+6:4">Joshua 6:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jos+6:15">Joshua 6:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jos+6:16">Joshua 6:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+5:10">2 Kings 5:10</span>). The feasts ordered by
	<i>sevens</i> of time (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+15:1">Deuteronomy 15:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+16:9">Deuteronomy 16:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+16:13">Deuteronomy 16:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="de+16:15">Deuteronomy 16:15</span>). It is a combination of
	<i>three,</i> the divine number (thus the Trinity: the thrice Holy,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:3">Isaiah 6:3</span>; the blessing, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+6:3- :">Isaiah 6:3- :</span>), and <i>four</i> the number of the organized world in
	its extension (thus the <i>four</i> elements, the <i>four</i>
	seasons, the <i>four</i> winds, the <i>four</i> corners or quarters
	of the earth, the <i>four</i> living creatures, emblems of redeemed
	creaturely life, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:5">Ezekiel 1:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:6">Ezekiel 1:6</span>, with <i>four</i> faces
	and <i>four</i> wings each; the <i>four</i> beasts and <i>four</i>
	metals, representing the four world empires, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:32">Daniel 2:32</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:33">Daniel 2:33</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:3">Daniel 7:3</span>;
	the <i>four</i>-sided Gospel designed for all quarters of the world;
	the sheet tied at <i>four</i> corners, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:3- :">Daniel 7:3- :</span>; the <i>four</i> horns, the sum of the world's forces
	against the Church, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+1:18">Zechariah 1:18</span>).
	In the Apocalypse, where God's covenant with His Church comes to its
	consummation, appropriately the number <i>seven</i> recurs still more
	frequently than elsewhere in Scripture. 
	</p>
<p><b>Asia</b>—Proconsular,
	governed by a Roman proconsul: consisting of Phrygia, Mysia, Caria,
	and Lydia: the kingdom which Attalus III had bequeathed to Rome. 
	</p>
<p><b>Grace . . . peace</b>—Paul's
	apostolical greeting. In his Pastoral Epistles he inserts "mercy"
	in addition: so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:3">2 John 1:3</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>him which is . . . was . . .
	is to come</b>—a periphrasis for the incommunicable name JEHOVAH,
	the self-existing One, unchangeable. In <i>Greek</i> the
	indeclinability of the designation here implies His unchangeableness.
	Perhaps the reason why "He which is to come" is used,
	instead of "He that shall be," is because the grand theme
	of Revelation is the Lord's <i>coming</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:3- :">2 John 1:3- :</span>). Still it is THE
	FATHER as distinguished
	from "Jesus Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2jo+1:3- :">2 John 1:3- :</span>) who is here meant. But so one are the Father and Son that
	the designation, "which is to come," more immediately
	applicable to Christ, is used here of the Father. 
	</p>
<p><b>the seven Spirits which are
	before his throne</b>—The oldest manuscripts omit "are." 
	</p>
<p><b>before</b>—literally, "in
	the presence of." The Holy Spirit in His sevenfold (that is,
	perfect, complete, and universal) energy. Corresponding to "the
	<i>seven</i> churches." One in His own essence, manifold in His
	gracious influences. The <i>seven</i> eyes resting on the stone laid
	by Jehovah (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>). Four is the
	number of the creature world (compare the fourfold cherubim); <i>seven</i>
	the number of God's revelation in the world.</p>
