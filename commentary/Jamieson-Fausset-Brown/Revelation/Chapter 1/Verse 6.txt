<p><b>6. And hath</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"And (He) hath." 
	</p>
<p><b>made us kings</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts read, "a kingdom." One oldest manuscript
	reads the dative, "for us." Another reads "us,"
	accusative: so <i>Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic,</i> and ANDREAS.
	This seems preferable, "He made us (to be) a kingdom." So
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+19:6">Exodus 19:6</span>, "a kingdom of
	priests"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9">1 Peter 2:9</span>, "a
	royal priesthood." The saints shall constitute peculiarly a
	<i>kingdom</i> of God, and shall themselves be <i>kings</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+2:9- :">1 Peter 2:9- :</span>). They shall share His King-Priest throne in the millennial
	kingdom. The emphasis thus falls more on the <i>kingdom</i> than on
	<i>priests:</i> whereas in <i>English Version</i> reading it is
	equally distributed between both. This book lays prominent stress on
	the saints' <i>kingdom.</i> They are kings because they are priests:
	the priesthood is the continuous ground and legitimization of their
	kingship; they are kings in relation to man, priests in relation to
	God, serving Him day and night in His temple (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:15">Revelation 7:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10">Revelation 5:10</span>). The priest-kings shall
	rule, not in an external mechanical manner, but simply in virtue of
	what they are, by the power of attraction and conviction overcoming
	the heart [AUBERLEN]. 
	</p>
<p><b>priests</b>—who have
	pre-eminently the privilege of near access to the king. David's sons
	were priests (<i>Hebrew</i>), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10- :">Revelation 5:10- :</span>. The distinction of <i>priests</i> and people, nearer and
	more remote from God, shall cease; all shall have nearest access to
	Him. All persons and things shall be holy to the Lord. 
	</p>
<p><b>God and his Father</b>—There
	is but one article to both in the <i>Greek,</i> therefore it means,
	"Unto Him who is at once God and His Father." 
	</p>
<p><b>glory and dominion</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the</i> glory and <i>the might.</i>" The fuller
	threefold doxology occurs, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:9">Revelation 4:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:11">Revelation 4:11</span>; fourfold, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:13">Revelation 5:13</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:25">Judges 1:25</span>; sevenfold, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:12">Revelation 7:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+29:11">1 Chronicles 29:11</span>. Doxology occupies the
	prominent place above, which prayer does below. If we thought of
	<i>God's glory</i> first (as in the Lord's Prayer), and gave the
	secondary place to our needs, we should please God and gain our
	petitions better than we do. 
	</p>
<p><b>for ever and ever</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"unto the ages."</p>
