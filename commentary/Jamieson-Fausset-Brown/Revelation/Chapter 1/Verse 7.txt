7. with clouds—Greek,
	"the clouds," namely, of heaven. "A cloud
	received Him out of their sight" at His ascension ( :-). His ascension corresponds to the manner of His coming again
	(Acts 1:11). Clouds are the
	symbols of wrath to sinners. 
	every eye—His coming
	shall therefore be a personal, visible appearing. 
	shall see—It is because
	they do not now see Him, they will not believe. Contrast Acts 1:11- :. 
	they also
—they in particular; "whosoever." Primarily,
	at His pre-millennial advent the Jews, who shall "look
	upon Him whom they have pierced," and mourn in repentance,
	and say, "Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord."
	Secondarily, and here chiefly, at the general judgment all the
	ungodly, not only those who actually pierced Him, but those who did
	so by their sins, shall look with trembling upon Him. John is the
	only one of the Evangelists who records the piercing of
	Christ's side. This allusion identifies him as the author of the
	Apocalypse. The reality of Christ's humanity and His death is proved
	by His having been pierced; and the water and blood
	from His side were the antitype to the Levitical waters of cleansing
	and blood offerings. 
	all kindreds . . . shall
	wail—all the unconverted at the general judgment; and
	especially at His pre-millennial advent, the Antichristian
	confederacy (Zechariah 12:3-6;
	Zechariah 12:9; Zechariah 14:1-4;
	Matthew 24:30). Greek, "all
	the tribes of the land," or "the earth."
	See the limitation to "all," Matthew 24:30- :. Even the godly while rejoicing in His love shall feel
	penitential sorrow at their sins, which shall all be manifested at
	the general judgment. 
	because of—Greek,
	"at," or "in regard to Him." 
	Even so, Amen—Gods seal
	of His own word; to which corresponds the believer's prayer, Matthew 24:30- :. The "even so" is Greek; "Amen"
	is Hebrew. To both Gentiles and Jews His promises and threats
	are unchangeable.
