<p><b>8.</b> <i>Greek,</i> "I am <i>the</i>
	Alpha and <i>the</i> Omega." The first and last letters of the
	alphabet. God in Christ comprises all that goes between, as well as
	the first and last. 
	</p>
<p><b>the beginning and the
	ending</b>—omitted in the oldest manuscripts, though found in
	<i>Vulgate</i> and <i>Coptic.</i> Transcribers probably inserted the
	clause from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:6">Revelation 21:6</span>. In Christ,
	Genesis, the Alpha of the Old Testament, and Revelation, the Omega of
	the New Testament, meet together: the last book presenting to us man
	and God reconciled in Paradise, as the first book presented man at
	the beginning innocent and in God's favor in Paradise. Accomplishing
	<i>finally</i> what I <i>begin.</i> Always the same; before the
	dragon, the beast, false prophet, and all foes. An anticipatory
	consolation to the saints under the coming trials of the Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>the Lord</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts read "the Lord God." 
	</p>
<p><b>Almighty</b>—<i>Hebrew,</i>
	"<i>Shaddai,</i>" and "<i>Jehovah Sabaoth,</i>"
	that is, "of hosts"; commanding all the hosts or powers in
	heaven and earth, so able to overcome all His Church's foes. It
	occurs often in Revelation, but nowhere else in the New Testament
	save <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+6:18">2 Corinthians 6:18</span>, a quotation from
	Isaiah.</p>
