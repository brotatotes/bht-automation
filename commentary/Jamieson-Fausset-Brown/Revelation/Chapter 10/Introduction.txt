	</p>
<p>As an episode was introduced
	between the sixth and seventh seals, so there is one here (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) after the sixth and introductory to the seventh
	trumpet (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>, which forms
	the grand consummation). The Church and her fortunes are the subject
	of this episode: as the judgments on the unbelieving <i>inhabiters of
	the earth</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span>) were
	the exclusive subject of the fifth and sixth woe-trumpets. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13- :">Revelation 8:13- :</span> is plainly referred to in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13- :">Revelation 8:13- :</span> below; in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11">Revelation 6:11</span> the
	martyrs crying to be avenged were told they must "rest yet for a
	little season" or <i>time:</i> in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11- :">Revelation 6:11- :</span> here they are assured, "There shall be no longer (any
	interval of) time"; their prayer shall have no longer to wait,
	but (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:7">Revelation 10:7</span>) <i>at the trumpet
	sounding of the seventh angel</i> shall be consummated, and <i>the
	mystery of God</i> (His mighty plan heretofore hidden, but then to be
	revealed) <i>shall be finished.</i> The <i>little open book</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:2">Revelation 10:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:9">Revelation 10:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:10">Revelation 10:10</span>) is given to John by
	the angel, with a charge (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:10- :">Revelation 10:10- :</span>) that he <i>must prophesy again concerning</i> (so the
	<i>Greek</i>) <i>peoples, nations, tongues, and kings:</i> which
	prophecy (as appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:10- :">Revelation 10:10- :</span>) affects those <i>peoples, nations, tongues, and kings</i>
	only in relation to ISRAEL AND
	THE CHURCH, who
	form the main object of the prophecy.</p>
