<p><b>a little book</b>—a roll
	<i>little</i> in comparison with the "book" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:5- :">Revelation 10:5- :</span>) which contained the <i>whole</i> vast scheme of God's
	purposes, not to be fully read till the final consummation. This
	other, a <i>less book,</i> contained only a portion which John was
	now to make his own (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:9">Revelation 10:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:11">Revelation 10:11</span>), and then to use in
	prophesying to others. The New Testament begins with the word "book"
	(<i>Greek,</i> "<i>biblus</i>"), of which "the little
	book" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>biblaridion</i>") is the
	diminutive, "the little bible," the Bible in miniature.
