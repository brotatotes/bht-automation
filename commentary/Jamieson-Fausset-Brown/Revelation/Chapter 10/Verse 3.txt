<p><b>3. as . . . lion</b>—Christ, whom
	the angel represents, is often so symbolized (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "the Lion of the tribe of Juda"). 
	</p>
<p><b>seven thunders</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the</i> seven thunders." They form part of the
	Apocalyptic symbolism; and so are marked by the article as <i>well
	known.</i> Thus <i>thunderings</i> marked the opening of the seventh
	seal (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:1">Revelation 8:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:5">Revelation 8:5</span>);
	so also at the seventh vial (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17">Revelation 16:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:18">Revelation 16:18</span>). WORDSWORTH
	calls this <i>the prophetic use of the article;</i> "<i>the</i>
	thunders, of which more hereafter." Their full meaning shall be
	only known at the grand consummation marked by the seventh seal, the
	seventh trumpet (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:19">Revelation 11:19</span>),
	and the seventh vial. 
	</p>
<p><b>uttered their</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>spake their own voices</i>"; that is, voices peculiarly
	<i>their own,</i> and not now revealed to men.</p>
