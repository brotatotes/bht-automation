Seal up—the opposite

	though at the time of the end the things sealed in
	Daniel's time were to be revealed, yet not so the voices of these
	thunders. Though heard by John, they were not to be imparted by him
	to others in this book of Revelation; so terrible are they that God
	in mercy withholds them, since "sufficient unto the day is the
	evil thereof." The godly are thus kept from morbid ponderings
	over the evil to come; and the ungodly are not driven by despair into
	utter recklessness of life. ALFORD
	adds another aim in concealing them, namely, "godly fear, seeing
	that the arrows of God's quiver are not exhausted." Besides the
	terrors foretold, there are others unutterable and more horrifying
	lying in the background.
