<p><b>5. lifted up his hand</b>â€”So A and
	<i>Vulgate</i> read. But B, C, <i>Aleph,</i> <i>Syriac,</i> and
	<i>Coptic,</i> ". . . his <i>right</i> hand." It was
	customary to lift up the hand towards heaven, appealing to the God of
	truth, in taking a solemn oath. There is in this part of the vision
	an allusion to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1-13">Daniel 12:1-13</span>.
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:4">Revelation 10:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:4">Daniel 12:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:9">Daniel 12:9</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:5">Revelation 10:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:6">Revelation 10:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:7">Daniel 12:7</span>.
	But there the angel clothed in linen, and standing upon the waters,
	sware "a time, times, and a half" were to interpose before
	the consummation; here, on the contrary, the angel standing with his
	left foot on the earth, and his right upon the sea, swears <i>there
	shall be time no longer.</i> There he lifted up both hands to heaven;
	here he has <i>the little book</i> now <i>open</i> (whereas in Daniel
	<i>the book</i> is <i>sealed</i>) <i>in his</i> left <i>hand</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:7- :">Daniel 12:7- :</span>), and he <i>lifts up</i> only <i>his right hand to heaven.</i></p>
