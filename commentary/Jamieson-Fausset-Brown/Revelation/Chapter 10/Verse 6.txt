<p><b>6. liveth for ever and ever</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"liveth unto the ages of the ages" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>created heaven . . . earth .
	. . sea,</b> &amp;c.—This detailed designation of God as the
	Creator, is appropriate to the subject of the angel's oath, namely,
	the consummating of the mystery of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), which can surely be brought to pass by the same Almighty
	power that created all things, and by none else. 
	</p>
<p><b>that there should be time no
	longer</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "that time (that is, an interval of
	time) no longer shall be." The martyrs shall have no longer a
	time to wait for the accomplishment of their prayers for the
	purgation of the earth by the judgments which shall remove their and
	God's foes from it (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11">Revelation 6:11</span>).
	The appointed <i>season</i> or <i>time</i> of delay is at an end (the
	same <i>Greek</i> is here as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11- :">Revelation 6:11- :</span>, <i>chronus</i>). Not as <i>English Version</i> implies,
	Time shall end and eternity begin.</p>
