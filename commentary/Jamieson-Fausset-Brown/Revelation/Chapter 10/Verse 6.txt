6. liveth for ever and ever—Greek,
	"liveth unto the ages of the ages" (compare  :-). 
	created heaven . . . earth .
	. . sea, &c.—This detailed designation of God as the
	Creator, is appropriate to the subject of the angel's oath, namely,
	the consummating of the mystery of God ( :-), which can surely be brought to pass by the same Almighty
	power that created all things, and by none else. 
	that there should be time no
	longer—Greek, "that time (that is, an interval of
	time) no longer shall be." The martyrs shall have no longer a
	time to wait for the accomplishment of their prayers for the
	purgation of the earth by the judgments which shall remove their and
	God's foes from it (Revelation 6:11).
	The appointed season or time of delay is at an end (the
	same Greek is here as in Revelation 6:11- :, chronus). Not as English Version implies,
	Time shall end and eternity begin.
