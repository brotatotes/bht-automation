<p><b>7. But</b>—connected with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. "There shall be no longer time (that is, delay), <i>but</i>
	in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to
	(so the <i>Greek</i>) sound his trumpet (so the <i>Greek</i>), then
	(literally, 'also'; which conjunction often introduces the consequent
	member of a sentence) the mystery of God is finished,"
	literally, "has been finished"; the prophet regarding the
	future as certain as if it were past. A, C, <i>Aleph,</i> and <i>Coptic</i>
	read the past tense (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>etelesthee</i>"). B
	reads, as <i>English Version,</i> the future tense (<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>telesthee</i>"). "should be finished"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15-18">Revelation 11:15-18</span>).
	Sweet consolation to the waiting saints! The seventh trumpet shall be
	sounded without further delay.

<p><b>the mystery of God</b>—the
	theme of the "little book," and so of the remainder of the
	Apocalypse. What a grand contrast to the "mystery of iniquity
	Babylon!" The mystery of God's scheme of redemption, once hidden
	in God's secret counsel and dimly shadowed forth in types and
	prophecies, but now more and more clearly revealed according as the
	Gospel kingdom develops itself, up to its fullest consummation at the
	end. Then finally His servants shall praise Him most fully, for the
	glorious consummation of the mystery in having taken to Himself and
	His saints the kingdom so long usurped by Satan and the ungodly. Thus
	this verse is an anticipation of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15-66.11.18- :">Revelation 11:15-66.11.18- :</span>.

<p><b>declared to</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"declared the glad tidings to." "The mystery of God"
	is the <i>Gospel glad tidings.</i> The office of <i>the prophets</i>
	is to receive <i>the glad tidings</i> from God, in order to <i>declare</i>
	them to others. The final consummation is the great theme of the
	Gospel announced to, and by, the prophets (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15-66.11.18- :">Revelation 11:15-66.11.18- :</span>).</p>
