<p><b>9. I went</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "I
	went <i>away.</i>" John here leaves heaven, his standing-point
	of observation heretofore, to be near the angel standing on the earth
	and sea. 
	</p>
<p><b>Give</b>—A, B, C, and
	<i>Vulgate</i> read the infinitive, "Telling him <i>to give.</i>"
	</p>
<p><b>eat it up</b>—appropriate
	its contents so entirely as to be assimilated with (as food), and
	become part of thyself, so as to impart them the more vividly to
	others. His finding the roll sweet to the taste at first, is because
	it was the Lord's will he was doing, and because, divesting himself
	of carnal feeling, he regarded God's will as always agreeable,
	however bitter might be the message of judgment to be announced.
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+40:8">Psalms 40:8</span>, <i>Margin,</i>
	as to Christ's inner complete appropriation of God's word. 
	</p>
<p><b>thy belly bitter</b>—parallel
	to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+2:10">Ezekiel 2:10</span>, "There was
	written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe." 
	</p>
<p><b>as honey</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:10">Psalms 19:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+119:103">Psalms 119:103</span>). Honey, sweet to the
	mouth, sometimes turns into bile in the stomach. The thought that God
	would be glorified (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:3-6">Revelation 11:3-6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:11-18">Revelation 11:11-18</span>) gave him the
	sweetest pleasure. Yet, afterwards the <i>belly,</i> or carnal
	natural feeling, was embittered with grief at the prophecy of the
	coming bitter persecutions of the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:11-66.11.18- :">Revelation 11:11-66.11.18- :</span>); compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:1">John 16:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:2">John 16:2</span>. The revelation of the
	secrets of futurity is <i>sweet</i> to one at first, but <i>bitter</i>
	and distasteful to our natural man, when we learn the cross which is
	to be borne before the crown shall be won. John was grieved at the
	coming apostasy and the sufferings of the Church at the hands of
	Antichrist.</p>
