<p><b>rejoice over them</b>—The
	Antichristianity of the last days shall probably be under the name of
	philosophical enlightenment and civilization, but really man's
	deification of himself. Fanaticism shall lead Antichrist's followers
	to exult in having at last seemingly silenced in death their
	Christian rebukers. Like her Lord, the Church will have her dark
	passion week followed by the bright resurrection morn. It is a
	curious historical coincidence that, at the fifth Lateran Council,
	May 5, 1514, no witness (not even the Moravians who were summoned)
	testified for the truth, as HUSS
	and JEROME did at
	Constance; an orator ascended the tribunal before the representatives
	of papal Christendom, and said, "There is no reclaimant, no
	opponent." LUTHER, on
	October 31, 1517, exactly three and a half years afterwards, posted
	up his famous theses on the church at Wittenberg. The objection is,
	the years are years of three hundred sixty-five, not three hundred
	sixty, days, and so two and a half days are deficient; but still the
	coincidence is curious; and if this prophecy be allowed other
	fulfilments, besides the final and literal one under the last
	Antichrist, this may reasonably be regarded as one.
