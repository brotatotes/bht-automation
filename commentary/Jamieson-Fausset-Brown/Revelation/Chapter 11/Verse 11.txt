<p><b>the Spirit of life</b>—the

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:11">Ezekiel 37:11</span> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:11- :">Ezekiel 37:11- :</span>), "Breath <i>came into</i> them." The passage
	here, as there, is closely connected with <i>Israel's</i> restoration
	as a nation to political and religious life. Compare also concerning
	the same, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+6:2">Hosea 6:2</span>, where Ephraim
	says, "After two days will He revive us; in the <i>third day</i>
	He will <i>raise</i> us <i>up,</i> and we shall <i>live</i> in His

	contrast to "the times of the Gentiles" wherein these

<p><b>great fear</b>—such as fell
	on the soldiers guarding Christ's tomb at His resurrection (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:10- :">Ezekiel 37:10- :</span>), when also there was a great earthquake (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:10- :">Ezekiel 37:10- :</span>).
