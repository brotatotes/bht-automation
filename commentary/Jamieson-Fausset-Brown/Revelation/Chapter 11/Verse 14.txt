14. The second woe—that under
	the sixth trumpet ( :-), including also the prophecy,  :-: Woe to the world, joy to the faithful, as their
	redemption draweth nigh.
the third woe cometh
	quickly—It is not mentioned in detail for the present, until
	first there is given a sketch of the history of the origination,
	suffering, and faithfulness of the Church in a time of apostasy and
	persecution. Instead of the third woe being detailed, the grand
	consummation is summarily noticed, the thanksgiving of the
	twenty-four elders in heaven for the establishment of Christ's
	kingdom on earth, attended with the destruction of the
	destroyers of the earth.
