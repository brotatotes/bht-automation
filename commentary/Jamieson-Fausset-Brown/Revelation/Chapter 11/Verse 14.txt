<p><b>14. The second woe</b>—that under
	the sixth trumpet (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), including also the prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>: Woe to the world, joy to the faithful, as <i>their
	redemption draweth nigh.</i>
</p>
<p><b>the third woe cometh
	quickly</b>—It is not mentioned in detail for the present, until
	first there is given a sketch of the history of the origination,
	suffering, and faithfulness of the Church in a time of apostasy and
	persecution. Instead of the third woe being detailed, the grand
	consummation is summarily noticed, the thanksgiving of the
	twenty-four elders in heaven for the establishment of <i>Christ's
	kingdom on earth,</i> attended with the <i>destruction of the
	destroyers of the earth.</i></p>
