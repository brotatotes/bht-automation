<p><b>17. thanks</b>—for the answer to
	our prayers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10">Revelation 6:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11">Revelation 6:11</span>)
	in <i>destroying them which destroy the earth</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:11- :">Revelation 6:11- :</span>), thereby preparing the way for setting up the kingdom of
	Thyself and Thy saints. 
	</p>
<p><b>and art to come</b>—omitted
	in A, B, C, <i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> CYPRIAN,
	and ANDREAS. The
	consummation having actually come, they do not address Him as they
	did when it was still future, "Thou that art to come."
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:18">Revelation 11:18</span>, "is
	come." From the sounding of the seventh trumpet He is to His
	people JAH, the ever
	present Lord, WHO IS, more
	peculiarly than JEHOVAH
	"who is, was, and <i>is to come.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>taken to thee thy great
	power</b>—"to Thee" is not in the <i>Greek.</i> Christ
	<i>takes</i> to Him the kingdom as His own of <i>right.</i></p>
