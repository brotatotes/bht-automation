<p><b>19.</b> A similar solemn conclusion
	to that of the seventh seal, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:5">Revelation 8:5</span>,
	and to that of the seventh vial, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:5- :">Revelation 8:5- :</span>. Thus, it appears, the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and
	the seven vials, are not consecutive, but parallel, and ending in the
	same consummation. They present the unfolding of God's plans for
	bringing about the grand end under three different aspects, mutually
	complementing each other.

<p><b>the temple</b>—the
	sanctuary or <i>Holy place</i> (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>naos</i>"),
	not the whole <i>temple</i> (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>hieron</i>").
	</p>
<p><b>opened in heaven</b>—A and
	C read the article, "the temple of God "which is" in
	heaven, was opened." 
	</p>
<p><b>the ark of his testament</b>—or
	". . . His <i>covenant.</i>" As in the first verse the
	earthly sanctuary was <i>measured,</i> so here its heavenly antitype
	is laid open, and the antitype above to the <i>ark of the covenant</i>
	in the Holiest Place below is seen, the pledge of God's faithfulness
	to His covenant in saving His people and punishing their and His
	enemies. Thus this forms a fit close to the series of trumpet
	judgments and an introduction to the episode (the twelfth and
	thirteen chapters) as to His faithfulness to His Church. Here first
	His secret place, the heavenly sanctuary, is opened for the assurance
	of His people; and thence proceed His judgments in their behalf
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:15">Revelation 14:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:17">Revelation 14:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:5">Revelation 15:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17">Revelation 16:17</span>),
	which the great company in heaven laud as "true and righteous."
	This then is parallel to the scene at the heavenly altar, at the
	close of the seals and opening of the trumpets (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17- :">Revelation 16:17- :</span>), and at the close of the episode (the twelfth through
	fifteenth chapters) and opening of the vials (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:7">Revelation 15:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:8">Revelation 15:8</span>). See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:8- :">Revelation 15:8- :</span>, note at the opening of the chapter.</p>
