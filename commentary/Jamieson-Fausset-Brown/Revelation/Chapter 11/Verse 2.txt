	the woman a fugitive in the wilderness "a thousand two hundred
	and threescore days." In the wider sense, we may either adopt
	the year-day theory of 1260 years (on which, and the papal rule of
	1260 years, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:6- :">Revelation 12:6- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:6- :">Revelation 12:6- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:6- :">Revelation 12:6- :</span>), or rather,
	regard the 2300 days (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:14">Daniel 8:14</span>),
	1335 days (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:11">Daniel 12:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:12">Daniel 12:12</span>).
	1290 days, and 1260 days, as symbolical of the long period of the
	Gentile times, whether dating from the subversion of the Jewish
	theocracy at the Babylonian captivity (the <i>kingdom</i> having been
	never since restored to Israel), or from the last destruction of
	Jerusalem under Titus, and extending to the restoration of the
	theocracy at the coming of Him "whose right it is"; the
	different epochs marked by the 2300, 1335, 1290, and 1260 days, will
	not be fully cleared up till the grand consummation; but, meanwhile,
	our duty and privilege urge us to investigate them. Some one of the
	epochs assigned by many may be right but as yet it is uncertain. The
	times of the Gentile monarchies during Israel's <i>seven times</i>
	punishment, will probably, in the narrower sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:12- :">Daniel 12:12- :</span>), be succeeded by the much more restricted times of the
	personal Antichrist's tyranny in the Holy Land. The long years of
	papal misrule may be followed by the short time of the man of sin who
	shall concentrate in himself all the apostasy, persecution, and evil
	of the various forerunning Antichrists, Antiochus, Mohammed, Popery,
	just before Christ's advent. His time shall be THE
	RECAPITULATION and open consummation of the "mystery of
	iniquity" so long leavening the world. Witnessing churches may
	be followed by witnessing individuals, the former occupying the
	longer, the latter, the shorter period. The <i>three and a half</i>
	(1260 days being three and a half years of three hundred sixty days
	each, during which the two witnesses prophesy in sackcloth) is the
	sacred number <i>seven</i> halved, implying the Antichristian
	world-power's time is broken at best; it answers to the <i>three and
	a half</i> years' period in which Christ witnessed for the truth, and
	the Jews, His own people, disowned Him, and the God-opposed world
	power crucified Him (compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:12- :">Daniel 12:12- :</span>). The three and a half, in a word, marks the time in which
	the earthly rules over the heavenly kingdom. It was the duration of
	Antiochus' treading down of the temple and persecution of faithful
	Israelites. The resurrection of the witnesses after three and a half
	days, answers to Christ's resurrection after three days. The world
	power's times never reach the sacred fulness of seven times three
	hundred sixty, that is, 2520, though they approach to it in 2300 (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:12- :">Daniel 12:12- :</span>). The forty-two months answer to Israel's forty-two
	sojournings (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+33:1-50">Numbers 33:1-50</span>)
	in the wilderness, as contrasted with the sabbatic rest in Canaan:
	reminding the Church that here, in the world wilderness, she cannot
	look for her sabbatic rest. Also, three and a half years was the
	period of the heaven being shut up, and of consequent famine, in
	Elias' time. Thus, three and a half represented to the Church the
	idea of toil, pilgrimage, and persecution.</p>
