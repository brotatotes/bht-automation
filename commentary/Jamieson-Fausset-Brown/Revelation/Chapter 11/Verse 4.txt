<p><b>4. standing before the God of the
	earth</b>â€”A, B, C, <i>Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic,</i> and ANDREAS
	read "Lord" for "God": so <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Ministering to (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:19">Luke 1:19</span>),
	and as in the sight of Him, who, though now so widely disowned on
	"earth," is its rightful King, and shall at last be openly
	recognized as such (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>).
	The phrase alludes to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:10">Zechariah 4:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:14">Zechariah 4:14</span>, "the two anointed
	ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth." The article
	"the" marks this allusion. They are "the two
	candlesticks," not that they are the Church, the <i>one</i>
	candlestick, but as its representative <i>light-bearers</i> (<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>phosteres,</i>" <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:14- :">Zechariah 4:14- :</span>), and ministering for its encouragement in a time of
	apostasy. WORDSWORTH'S
	view is worth consideration, whether it may not constitute a
	secondary sense: <i>the two witnesses, the olive trees,</i> are THE
	TWO TESTAMENTS
	ministering their <i>testimony</i> to the Church of the old
	dispensation, as well as to that of the new, which explains the two
	witnesses being called also <i>the two candlesticks</i> (the Old and
	New Testament churches; the candlestick in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+4:14- :">Zechariah 4:14- :</span> is but <i>one</i> as there was then but one Testament, and
	one Church, the Jewish). The Church in both dispensations has no
	light in herself, but derives it from the Spirit through the witness
	of the twofold word, the two olive trees: compare <i>Note,</i> see on
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:1">Revelation 11:1</span>, which is connected
	with this, <i>the reed,</i> the <i>Scripture canon,</i> being the
	measure of the Church: so PRIMASIUS
	[X, p. 314]: the two witnesses preach in sackcloth, marking the
	ignominious treatment which the word, like Christ Himself, receives
	from the world. So the twenty-four elders represent the ministers of
	the two dispensations by the double twelve. But <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:1- :">Revelation 11:1- :</span> proves that primarily the two Testaments cannot be meant;
	for these shall never be "killed," and never "shall
	have finished their testimony" till the world is finished.</p>
