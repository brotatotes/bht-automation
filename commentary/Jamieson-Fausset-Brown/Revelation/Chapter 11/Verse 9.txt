9. they—rather, "(some)
	of the peoples." 
	people—Greek,
	"peoples." 
	kindreds—Greek,
	"tribes"; all save the elect (whence it is not said, The
	peoples . . . but [some] of the peoples . . . , or, some
	of the peoples . . . may refer to those of the nations . .
	., who at the time shall hold possession of Palestine and
	Jerusalem). 
	shall see—So Vulgate,
	Syriac, and Coptic. But A, B, C, and ANDREAS,
	the present, "see," or rather (Greek, "blepousin"),
	"look upon." The prophetic present. 
	dead bodies—So Vulgate,
	Syriac, and ANDREAS.
	But A, B, C, and Coptic, singular, as in  :-, "dead body." Three and a half days answer to the
	three and a half years (see on  :-), the half of seven, the full and perfect number. 
	shall not suffer—so B,
	Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS.
	But A, C, and Vulgate read, "do not suffer." 
	in graves—so Vulgate
	and PRIMASIUS. But B, C,
	Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS,
	singular; translate, "into a sepulchre," literally,
	"a monument." Accordingly, in righteous retribution in
	kind, the flesh of the Antichristian hosts is not buried, but
	given to all the fowls in mid-heaven to eat (Revelation 19:17;
	Revelation 19:18; Revelation 19:21).
