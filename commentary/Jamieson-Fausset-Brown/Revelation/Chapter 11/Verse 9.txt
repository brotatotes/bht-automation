<p><b>people</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"peoples." 
	</p>
<p><b>kindreds</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"tribes"; all save the elect (whence it is not said, <i>The

<p><b>shall see</b>—So <i>Vulgate,
	Syriac,</i> and <i>Coptic.</i> But A, B, C, and ANDREAS,
	the present, "see," or rather (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>blepousin</i>"),
	"look upon." The prophetic present.

<p><b>dead bodies</b>—So <i>Vulgate,
	Syriac,</i> and ANDREAS.
	But A, B, C, and <i>Coptic,</i> singular, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "dead body." Three and a half days answer to the
	three and a half years (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), the half of seven, the full and perfect number.

<p><b>shall not suffer</b>—so B,

	But A, C, and <i>Vulgate</i> read, "do not suffer."

<p><b>in graves</b>—so <i>Vulgate</i>
	and PRIMASIUS. But B, C,
	<i>Syriac, Coptic,</i> and ANDREAS,
	<i>singular;</i> translate, "into a sepulchre," literally,
	"a monument." Accordingly, in righteous retribution in
	kind, <i>the flesh</i> of the Antichristian hosts is not buried, but
	given to <i>all the fowls in mid-heaven</i> to eat (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:17">Revelation 19:17</span>;
