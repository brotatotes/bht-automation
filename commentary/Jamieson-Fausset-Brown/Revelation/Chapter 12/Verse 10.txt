<p><b>10. Now</b>—<i>Now</i> that Satan
	has been cast out of heaven. Primarily fulfilled in part at Jesus'
	resurrection and ascension, when He said (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "All power [<i>Greek,</i> '<i>exousia,</i>'
	'authority,' as here; see below] is given unto Me in heaven and in
	earth"; connected with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Her child was <i>caught up unto God and to His
	throne.</i>" In the ulterior sense, it refers to the eve of
	Christ's second coming, when Israel is about to be restored as
	mother-church of Christendom, Satan, who had resisted her restoration
	on the ground of her unworthiness, having been cast out by the
	instrumentality of Michael, Israel's angelic <i>prince</i> (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Thus this is parallel, and the necessary preliminary to
	the glorious event similarly expressed, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "The kingdom of this world is become (the very word
	here, <i>Greek,</i> '<i>egeneto,</i>' 'is come,' 'hath come to pass')
	our Lord's and His Christ's," the result of Israel's resuming
	her place.

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+3:6">Luke 3:6</span>, yet future; hence, not

	own elect</i> (like the widow, <i>continually coming,</i> so as even
	to <i>weary</i> the unjust judge), should <i>cry day and night unto
	Him.</i></p>
