11. they—emphatic in the
	Greek. "They" in particular. They and they alone.
	They were the persons who overcame. 
	overcame— (Romans 8:33;
	Romans 8:34; Romans 8:37;
	Romans 16:20). 
	him— (1 John 2:14;
	1 John 2:15). It is the same victory
	(a peculiarly Johannean phrase) over Satan and the world which the
	Gospel of John describes in the life of Jesus, his Epistle in the
	life of each believer, and his Apocalypse in the life of the Church. 
	by, c.—Greek
	(dia to haima accusative, not genitive case, as English
	Version would require, compare 1 John 2:15- :), "on account of (on the ground of) the blood of
	the Lamb"; "because of"; on account of and by virtue
	of its having been shed. Had that blood not been shed, Satan's
	accusations would have been unanswerable; as it is, that blood meets
	every charge. SCHOTTGEN
	mentions the Rabbinical tradition that Satan accuses men all days of
	the year, except the day of atonement. TITTMANN
	takes the Greek "dia," as it often means, out
	of regard to the blood of the Lamb; this was the impelling cause
	which induced them to undertake the contest for the sake of
	it; but the view given above is good Greek, and more in
	accordance with the general sense of Scripture. 
	by the word of their
	testimony—Greek, "on account of the word of their
	testimony." On the ground of their faithful testimony, even unto
	death, they are constituted victors. Their testimony evinced their
	victory over him by virtue of the blood of the Lamb. Hereby they
	confess themselves worshippers of the slain Lamb and overcome the
	beast, Satan's representative; an anticipation of 1 John 2:15- :, "them that had gotten the victory over the beast"
	(compare Revelation 13:15; Revelation 13:16).
	unto—Greek,
	"achri," "even as far as." They carried
	their not-love of life as far as even unto death.
