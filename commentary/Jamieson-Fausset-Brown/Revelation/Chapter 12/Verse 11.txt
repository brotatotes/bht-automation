	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15">1 John 2:15</span>). It is the same <i>victory</i>

	Gospel of John describes in the life of Jesus, his Epistle in the
	life of each believer, and his Apocalypse in the life of the Church.

	(<i>dia to haima</i> accusative, not genitive case, as <i>English
	Version</i> would require, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15- :">1 John 2:15- :</span>), "<i>on account of</i> (on the ground of) the blood of
	the Lamb"; "because of"; on account of and by virtue
	of its having been shed. Had that blood not been shed, Satan's
	accusations would have been unanswerable; as it is, that blood meets
	every charge. SCHOTTGEN
	mentions the Rabbinical tradition that Satan accuses men all days of
	the year, except the day of atonement. TITTMANN
	takes the <i>Greek</i> "<i>dia,</i>" as it often means, <i>out
	of regard</i> to the blood of the Lamb; this was the impelling cause
	which <i>induced</i> them to undertake the contest <i>for the sake of</i>
	it; but the view given above is good <i>Greek,</i> and more in
	accordance with the general sense of Scripture.

<p><b>by the word of their

	testimony." On the ground of their faithful testimony, even unto
	death, they are constituted victors. Their testimony evinced their
	victory over him by virtue of the blood of the Lamb. Hereby they
	confess themselves worshippers of the slain Lamb and overcome the
	beast, Satan's representative; an anticipation of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:15- :">1 John 2:15- :</span>, "them that had gotten the victory over the beast"
