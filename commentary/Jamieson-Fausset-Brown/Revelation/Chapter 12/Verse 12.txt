<p><b>dwell</b>—literally,
	"tabernacle." Not only angels and the souls of the just
	with God, but also the faithful militant on earth, who already in
	spirit tabernacle in heaven, having their home and citizenship there,
	<i>rejoice</i> that Satan is cast out of their home. "Tabernacle"
	for <i>dwell</i> is used to mark that, though still on the earth,
	they in spirit are hidden "in the secret of God's <i>tabernacle.</i>"
	They belong not to the world, and, therefore, exult in judgment
	having been passed on the prince of this world.

	ANDREAS reads. But A, B,

<p><b>is come down</b>—rather as

	John regarding the heaven as his standing-point of view whence he

<p><b>unto you</b>—<i>earth and

	belong to, the <i>earth</i> (contrast <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9- :">Revelation 12:9- :</span>, <i>Margin,</i> with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:31">John 3:31</span>;

	and its <i>sea</i>-like troubled politics. Furious at his expulsion
	from heaven, and knowing that his time on earth is short until he
	shall be cast down lower, when Christ shall come to set up <i>His</i>
	kingdom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:1">Revelation 20:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:2">Revelation 20:2</span>),
	Satan concentrates all his power to destroy as many souls as he can.
	Though no longer able to accuse the elect in heaven, he can tempt and
	persecute on earth. The more light becomes victorious, the greater
	will be the struggles of the powers of darkness; whence, at the last
	crisis, Antichrist will manifest himself with an intensity of
	iniquity greater than ever before.
