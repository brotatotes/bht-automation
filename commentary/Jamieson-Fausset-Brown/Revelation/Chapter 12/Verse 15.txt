15, 16. floodâ€”Greek,
	"river" (compare Exodus 2:3;
	Matthew 2:20; and especially Matthew 2:20- :). The flood, or river, is the stream of Germanic
	tribes which, pouring on Rome, threatened to destroy Christianity.
	But the earth helped the woman, by swallowing up the flood.
	The earth, as contradistinguished from water, is the world
	consolidated and civilized. The German masses were brought under the
	influence of Roman civilization and Christianity [AUBERLEN].
	Perhaps it includes also, generally, the help given by earthly powers
	(those least likely, yet led by God's overruling providence to give
	help) to the Church against persecutions and also heresies, by which
	she has been at various times assailed.
