<p><b>the remnant of her

	first effort was to root out the Christian Church, so that there
	should be no visible profession of Christianity. Foiled in this, he
	<i>wars</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:7">Revelation 11:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:7">Revelation 13:7</span>)
	against the invisible Church, namely, "those who keep the
	commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus" (A, B, and
	C omit "Christ"). These are "the remnant," or
	<i>rest of her seed,</i> as distinguished from her seed, "the
	man-child" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:5">Revelation 12:5</span>), on
	one hand, and from mere professors on the other. The Church, in her
	beauty and unity (Israel at the head of Christendom, the whole
	forming one perfect Church), is now not manifested, but awaiting the
	<i>manifestations of the sons of God</i> at Christ's coming. Unable
	to destroy Christianity and the Church as a whole, Satan directs his
	enmity against true Christians, the elect <i>remnant:</i> the others
	he leaves unmolested.</p>
