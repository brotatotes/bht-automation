2. painedâ€”Greek,
	"tormented" (basanizomene). DE
	BURGH explains this of the
	bringing in of the first-begotten into the world AGAIN,
	when Israel shall at last welcome Him, and when "the man-child
	shall rule all nations with the rod of iron." But there is a
	plain contrast between the painful travailing of the woman
	here, and Christ's second coming to the Jewish Church, the believing
	remnant of Israel, "Before she travailed she brought
	forth . . . a MAN-CHILD,"
	that is, almost without travail-pangs, she receives (at His
	second advent), as if born to her, Messiah and a numerous seed.
