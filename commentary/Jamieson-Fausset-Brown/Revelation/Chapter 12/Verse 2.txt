<p><b>2. pained</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"tormented" (<i>basanizomene</i>). DE
	BURGH explains this of the
	bringing in of the first-begotten into the world AGAIN,
	when Israel shall at last welcome Him, and when "the man-child
	shall rule all nations with the rod of iron." But there is a
	plain contrast between the <i>painful travailing</i> of the woman
	here, and Christ's second coming to the Jewish Church, the believing
	remnant of Israel, "<i>Before she travailed</i> she brought
	forth . . . a MAN-CHILD,"
	that is, almost <i>without travail-pangs,</i> she receives (at His
	second advent), as if born to her, Messiah and a numerous seed.</p>
