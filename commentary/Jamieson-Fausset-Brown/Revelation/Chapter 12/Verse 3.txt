	either case, the <i>color</i> of the dragon implies his fiery rage as
	a <i>murderer from the beginning.</i> His representative, <i>the

	<i>seven</i> Spirits of God. His worldly instruments of power are
	marked by the <i>ten horns,</i> ten being the number of the world. It
	marks his self-contradictions that he and the beast bear both the
