<p><b>4. drew</b>—<i>Greek,</i> present
	tense, "draweth," "drags down." His <i>dragging
	down the stars</i> with <i>his tail</i> (lashed back and forward in
	his fury) implies his persuading to apostatize, like himself, and to
	become earthy, those angels and also once eminent human teachers who
	had formerly been heavenly (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:20">Revelation 1:20</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+14:12">Isaiah 14:12</span>).

<p><b>stood</b>—"stands"
	[ALFORD]: perfect tense,
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>hesteken.</i>"

<p><b>ready to be delivered</b>—"about
	to bring forth." 
	</p>
<p><b>for to devour,</b> &amp;c.—"that
	when she brought forth, he might devour her child." So the
	dragon, represented by his agent Pharaoh (a name common to all the
	Egyptian kings, and meaning, according to some, <i>crocodile,</i> a
	reptile like the dragon, and made an Egyptian idol), was ready to
	devour Israel's <i>males</i> at the birth of the nation.
	Antitypically the true Israel, Jesus, when born, was sought for
	destruction by Herod, who slew all the <i>males</i> in and around
	Bethlehem.</p>
