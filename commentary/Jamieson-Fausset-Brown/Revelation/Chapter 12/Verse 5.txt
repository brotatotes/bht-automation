<p><b>5. man-child</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "a
	son, a male." On the deep significance of this term, see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.

<p><b>rule</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>poimainein,</i>" "tend as a shepherd"; (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span>).

<p><b>rod of iron</b>—A rod is
	for long-continued obstinacy until they submit themselves to
	obedience [BENGEL]:
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:9">Psalms 2:9</span>,
	which passages prove the Lord Jesus to be meant. Any interpretation
	which ignores this must be wrong. The <i>male son's</i> birth cannot
	be the origin of the Christian state (Christianity triumphing over
	heathenism under Constantine), which was not a divine child of the
	woman, but had many impure worldly elements. In a secondary sense,
	<i>the ascending of the witnesses up to heaven</i> answers to
	Christ's own ascension, "caught up unto God, and unto His
	throne": as also His ruling the nations with a rod of iron is to
	be shared in by believers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:9- :">Psalms 2:9- :</span>). What took place primarily in the case of the divine Son of
	the woman, shall take place also in the case of those who are one
	with Him, the sealed of Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:9- :">Psalms 2:9- :</span>), and the elect of all nations, about to be translated and
	to reign with Him over the earth at His appearing.</p>
