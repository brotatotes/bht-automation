<p><b>8. prevailed not</b>—A and <i>Coptic</i>
	read, "<i>He</i> prevailed not." But B and C read as
	<i>English Version.</i>

<p><b>neither</b>—A, B, and C
	read, "not even" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>oude</i>"): a
	climax. Not only did they not prevail, but <i>not even their place
	was found any more in heaven.</i> There are four gradations in the
	ever deeper downfall of Satan: (1) He is deprived of his heavenly
	excellency, though having still access to heaven as man's accuser, up
	to Christ's first coming. As heaven was not fully yet opened to man
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13">John 3:13</span>), so it was not yet
	shut against Satan and his demons. The Old Testament dispensation
	could not overcome him. (2) From Christ, down to the millennium, he
	is judicially cast out of heaven as the accuser of the elect, and
	shortly before the millennium loses his power against Israel, and has
	sentence of expulsion fully executed on him and his by Michael. His
	rage on earth is consequently the greater, his power being
	concentrated on it, especially towards the end, when "he knoweth
	that he hath but a short time" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13- :">John 3:13- :</span>). (3) He is bound during the millennium (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+3:13- :">John 3:13- :</span>). (4) After having been loosed for a while, he is cast for
	ever into the lake of fire.</p>
