<p><b>10. He that leadeth into
	captivity</b>—A, B, C, and <i>Vulgate</i> read, "if any one
	(be) for captivity." 
	</p>
<p><b>shall go into captivity</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	present, "goeth into captivity." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, which is alluded to here. <i>Aleph,</i> B, and C read
	simply, "he goeth away," and omit "into captivity."
	But A and <i>Vulgate</i> support the words. 
	</p>
<p><b>he that killeth with the
	sword, must be killed with the sword</b>—So B and C read. But A
	reads, "if any (is for) being (literally, 'to be') killed with
	the sword." As of old, so now, those to be persecuted by the
	beast in various ways, have their trials severally appointed them by
	God's fixed counsel. <i>English Version</i> is quite a different
	sense, namely, a warning to the persecutors that they shall be
	punished with retribution in kind. 
	</p>
<p><b>Here</b>—"Herein":
	in bearing their appointed sufferings lies the <i>patient endurance .
	. . of the saints.</i> This is to be the motto and watchword of the
	elect during the period of the world kingdom. As the first beast is
	to be met by <i>patience</i> and <i>faith</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), the second beast must be opposed by true <i>wisdom</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:18">Revelation 13:18</span>).</p>
