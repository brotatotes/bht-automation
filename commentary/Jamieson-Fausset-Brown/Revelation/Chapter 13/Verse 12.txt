	period. The healing of the wound and return of the beast is
	represented [in regard to its <i>final</i> Antichristian
	manifestation though including also, meanwhile, its healing and

<p><b>which dwell therein</b>—the
	earthly-minded. The Church becomes the <i>harlot:</i> the world's
	political power, the Antichristian <i>beast;</i> the world's wisdom
	and civilization, <i>the false prophet.</i> Christ's three offices
	are thus perverted: the first beast is the false <i>kingship;</i> the
	harlot, the false <i>priesthood;</i> the second beast, the false
	<i>prophet.</i> The beast is the <i>bodily,</i> the false prophet the
	<i>intellectual,</i> the harlot the <i>spiritual</i> power of
	Antichristianity [AUBERLEN].
	The <i>Old-Testament Church</i> stood under the power of the beast,
	the heathen world power: <i>the Middle-Ages Church</i> under that of
	the harlot: <i>in modern times</i> the false prophet predominates.
	But in the last days all these God-opposed powers which have
	succeeded each other shall <i>co-operate,</i> and raise each other to
	the most terrible and intense power of their nature: <i>the false
	prophet causes men to worship the beast, and the beast carries the
	harlot.</i> These three forms of apostasy are reducible to two: <i>the
	apostate Church</i> and <i>the apostate world, pseudo-Christianity</i>
	and <i>Antichristianity,</i> the harlot and the beast; for the false
	prophet is also a beast; and the two beasts, as different
	manifestations of the same beast-like principle, stand in
	contradistinction to the harlot, and are finally judged together,
	whereas separate judgment falls on the harlot [AUBERLEN].
