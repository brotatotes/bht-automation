	"maketh even fire." This is the very miracle which the two
	witnesses perform, and which Elijah long ago had performed; this the
	beast from the bottomless pit, or the false prophet, mimics. Not
	merely tricks, but miracles of a demoniacal kind, and by demon aid,
	like those of the Egyptian magicians, shall be wrought, most
	calculated to deceive; wrought "after the working (<i>Greek,</i>
	'energy') of Satan."</p>
