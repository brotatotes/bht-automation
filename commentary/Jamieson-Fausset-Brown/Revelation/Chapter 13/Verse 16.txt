<p><b>16. to receive a mark</b>â€”literally,
	"that they should give them a mark"; such a brand as
	masters stamp on their slaves, and monarchs on their subjects.
	Soldiers voluntarily punctured their arms with marks of the general
	under whom they served. Votaries of idols branded themselves with the
	idol's cipher or symbol. Thus Antiochus Epiphanes branded the Jews
	with the ivy leaf, the symbol of Bacchus (<u>2 Maccabees 6:7; 3
	Maccabees 2:29</u>). Contrast God's <i>seal</i> and <i>name in the
	foreheads of His servants,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:3">Revelation 7:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1">Revelation 14:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:4">Revelation 22:4</span>;
	and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:17">Galatians 6:17</span>, "I bear in my
	body the marks of the Lord Jesus," that is, I am His soldier and
	servant. The mark in the right hand and forehead implies the
	prostration of <i>bodily</i> and <i>intellectual</i> powers to the
	beast's domination. "In <i>the forehead</i> by way of
	profession; in the <i>hand</i> with respect to work and service"
	[AUGUSTINE].</p>
