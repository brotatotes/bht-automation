<p><b>2. leopard . . . bear . . .
	lion</b>â€”This beast unites in itself the God-opposed
	characteristics of the three preceding kingdoms, resembling
	respectively the <i>leopard, bear,</i> and <i>lion.</i> It rises up
	out <i>of the sea,</i> as Daniel's four beasts, and has <i>ten horns,</i>
	as Daniel's fourth beast, <i>and seven heads,</i> as Daniel's four
	beasts had in all, namely, one on the first, one on the second, four
	on the third, and one on the fourth. Thus it represents
	comprehensively in one figure <i>the world power</i> (which in Daniel
	is represented by four) <i>of all times and places,</i> not merely of
	one period and one locality, viewed as opposed to God; just as the
	<i>woman</i> is the Church of all ages. This view is favored also by
	the fact, that the beast is the vicarious representative of Satan,
	who similarly has <i>seven heads</i> and <i>ten horns:</i> a general
	description of his universal power in all ages and places of the
	world. Satan appears as a serpent, as being the archetype of the
	beast nature (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:9">Revelation 12:9</span>). "If
	the seven heads meant merely seven Roman emperors, one cannot
	understand why they alone should be mentioned in the original image
	of Satan, whereas it is perfectly intelligible if we suppose them to
	represent Satan's power on earth viewed collectively"
