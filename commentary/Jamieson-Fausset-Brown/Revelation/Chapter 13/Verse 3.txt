	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>); compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:11">Revelation 17:11</span>, "the beast that
	<i>was, and is not, and shall ascend</i> out of the bottomless pit"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span>); the
	Germanic empire, the seventh head (revived in <i>the eighth</i>), as
	yet future in John's time (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11- :">Revelation 13:11- :</span>). Contrast the change whereby Nebuchadnezzar, being humbled
	from his self-deifying pride, was converted from his <i>beast</i>-like
	form and character to MAN'S
	form and true position towards God; symbolized by his <i>eagle wings
	being plucked,</i> and himself made to stand upon his feet as a <i>man</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:4">Daniel 7:4</span>). Here, on the contrary,
	the <i>beast's</i> head is not changed into a <i>human</i> head, but
	receives a deadly wound, that is, the world kingdom which this head
	represents does not truly turn to God, but for a time its God-opposed
	character remains paralyzed ("as it were slain"; the very
	words marking the beast's outward resemblance to the Lamb, "as
	it were slain," see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6">Revelation 5:6</span>.
	Compare also the second beast's resemblance to the <i>Lamb,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:6- :">Revelation 5:6- :</span>). Though seemingly <i>slain</i> (<i>Greek</i> for
	"wounded"), it remains the beast still, to rise again in
	another form (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span>). The
	first six heads were heathenish, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia,
	Greece, Rome; the new seventh world power (the pagan German hordes
	pouring down on Christianized Rome), whereby Satan had hoped to
	stifle Christianity (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:16">Revelation 11:16</span>), became itself
	Christianized (answering to the beast's, <i>as it were, deadly wound:
	it was slain,</i> and <i>it is not,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:16- :">Revelation 11:16- :</span>). Its <i>ascent out of the bottomless pit answers</i> to
	the <i>healing of its deadly wound</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:16- :">Revelation 11:16- :</span>). No essential change is noticed in Daniel as effected by
	Christianity upon the fourth kingdom; it remains essentially
	God-opposed to the last. The beast, <i>healed</i> of its temporary
	and external <i>wound,</i> now returns, not only from the sea, but
	from the <i>bottomless pit,</i> whence it draws new Antichristian
	strength of hell (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:3">Revelation 13:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:12">Revelation 13:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:7">Revelation 11:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>). Compare the <i>seven
	evil spirits</i> taken into the temporarily dispossessed, and <i>the
	last state worse than the first,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8- :">Revelation 17:8- :</span>. A new and worse heathenism breaks in upon the
	Christianized world, more devilish than the old one of the first
	heads of the beast. The latter was an apostasy only from the general
	revelation of God in nature and conscience; but this new one is from
	God's revelation of love in His Son. It culminates in Antichrist, the
	man of sin, the son of perdition (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8- :">Revelation 17:8- :</span>); <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3- :">2 Thessalonians 2:3- :</span>, the very characteristics of old heathenism (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3- :">2 Thessalonians 2:3- :</span>) [AUBERLEN].
	More than one wound seems to me to be meant, for example, that under
	Constantine (when the pagan worship of the emperor's image gave way
	to Christianity), followed by the healing, when image worship and the
	other papal errors were introduced into the Church; again, that at
	the Reformation, followed by the lethargic <i>form of godliness
	without the power,</i> and about to end in the last great apostasy,
	which I identify with the second beast (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:3- :">2 Thessalonians 2:3- :</span>), Antichrist, the same seventh world power in another form.
