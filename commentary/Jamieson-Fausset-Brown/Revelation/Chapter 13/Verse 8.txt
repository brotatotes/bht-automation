<p><b>8. all that dwell upon the
	earth</b>—being of earth earthy; in contrast to "them that
	dwell in heaven."

<p><b>whose names are not
	written</b>—A, B, C, <i>Syriac, Coptic,</i> and ANDREAS
	read singular, "(every one) whose (<i>Greek,</i> '<i>hou</i>';
	but B, Greek, '<i>hon,</i>' plural) <i>name</i> is not written."

<p><b>Lamb slain from the
	foundation of the world</b>—The <i>Greek</i> order of words favors
	this translation. He was <i>slain</i> in the Father's eternal
	counsels: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:19">1 Peter 1:19</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+1:20">1 Peter 1:20</span>, virtually parallel. The
	other way of connecting the words is, "Written from the
	foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb slain."
	So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>. The elect. The
	former is in the <i>Greek</i> more obvious and simple. "Whatsoever
	virtue was in the sacrifices, did operate through Messiah's death
	alone. As He was "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the
	world," so all atonements ever made were only effectual by His
	blood" [BISHOP
	PEARSON, <i>Exposition of
	the Creed</i>].</p>
