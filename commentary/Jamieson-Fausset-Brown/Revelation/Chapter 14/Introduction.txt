<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. THE LAMB
	SEEN ON ZION
	WITH THE 144,000. THEIR
	SONG. THE
	GOSPEL PROCLAIMED
	BEFORE THE END BY
	ONE ANGEL:
	THE FALL
	OF BABYLON, BY
	ANOTHER: THE
	DOOM OF THE BEAST
	WORSHIPPERS, BY A THIRD.
	THE BLESSEDNESS
	OF THE DEAD IN THE
	LORD. THE
	HARVEST. THE
	VINTAGE.

<p>In contrast to the beast, false
	prophet, and apostate Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) and introductory to the announcement of judgments about
	to descend on them and the world (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, anticipatory of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), stand here the redeemed, "the divine kernel of
	humanity, the positive fruits of the history of the world and the
	Church" [AUBERLEN].
	The fourteenth through sixteenth chapters describe the preparations
	for the Messianic judgment. As the fourteenth chapter begins with <i>the</i>
	144,000 <i>of Israel</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, no longer exposed to trial as then, but now triumphant),
	so the fifteenth chapter begins with those who have <i>overcome</i>
	from among the Gentiles (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:1-5">Revelation 15:1-5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9-17">Revelation 7:9-17</span>); the two classes
	of elect forming together the whole company of transfigured saints
	who shall reign with Christ.</p>
