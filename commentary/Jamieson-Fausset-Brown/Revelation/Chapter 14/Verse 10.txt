<p><b>without mixture</b>—whereas
	wine was so commonly <i>mixed</i> with water that to <i>mix</i> wine
	is used in <i>Greek</i> for to <i>pour out</i> wine; <i>this</i> wine
	of God's wrath is <i>undiluted;</i> there is no drop of water to cool
	its heat. Naught of grace or hope is blended with it. This terrible
	threat may well raise us above the fear of man's threats. This
	<i>unmixed</i> cup is already <i>mingled</i> and prepared for Satan
	and the beast's followers.

<p><b>indignation</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>orges,</i>" "abiding wrath," But the <i>Greek</i>
	for "wrath" above (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>thumou</i>")
	is <i>boiling indignation,</i> from (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>thuo</i>")
	a root meaning "to boil"; this is temporary ebullition of
	anger; that is lasting [AMMONIUS],
	and accompanied with a purpose of vengeance [ORIGEN
	on Psalm 2:5].
