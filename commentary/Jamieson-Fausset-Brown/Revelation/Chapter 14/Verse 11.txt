<p><b>11. for ever and ever</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"unto ages of ages." 
	</p>
<p><b>no rest day nor
	night</b>—Contrast the very different sense in which the same is
	said of the four living creatures in heaven, "They rest not day
	and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy"; yet they do "rest"
	in another sense; they rest from sin and sorrow, weariness and
	weakness, trial and temptation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); the lost have no rest from sin and Satan, terror,
	torment, and remorse.</p>
