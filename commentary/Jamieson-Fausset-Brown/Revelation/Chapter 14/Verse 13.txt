<p><b>13.</b> Encouragement to cheer those
	persecuted under the beast.

<p><b>Write</b>—to put it on
	record for ever. 
	</p>
<p><b>Blessed</b>—in <i>resting
	from their toils,</i> and, in the case of the saints just before
	alluded to as persecuted by the beast, in <i>resting from
	persecutions.</i> Their full <i>blessedness</i> is now "from
	henceforth," that is, FROM
	THIS TIME, when the judgment on the beast and the harvest
	gatherings of the elect are imminent. The time so earnestly longed
	for by former martyrs is now all but come; the full number of their
	fellow servants is on the verge of completion; they have no longer to
	"<i>rest</i> (the same <i>Greek</i> as here, <i>anapausis</i>)
	yet for a little season," their eternal <i>rest,</i> or
	<i>cessation</i> from toils (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; <i>Greek,</i> "<i>anesis,</i>" relaxation after
	hardships. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:9">Hebrews 4:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+4:10">Hebrews 4:10</span>,
	<i>sabbatism of rest;</i> and <i>Greek,</i> "<i>catapausis,</i>"
	akin to the <i>Greek</i> here) is close at hand now. They are <i>blessed</i>
	in being about to sit down to <i>the marriage supper of the Lamb</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span>), and in having part
	in the <i>first resurrection</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9- :">Revelation 19:9- :</span>), and in <i>having right to the tree of life</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9- :">Revelation 19:9- :</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9- :">Revelation 19:9- :</span> follows the explanation of why they are pronounced
	"blessed" now in particular, namely, <i>the Son of man on
	the cloud</i> is just coming to gather them in as <i>the harvest</i>
	ripe for garner. 
	</p>
<p><b>Yea, saith the Spirit</b>—The
	words of God the Father (the "voice from heaven") are
	echoed back and confirmed by the Spirit (speaking in the Word,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:7">Revelation 2:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>;
	and in the saints, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:5">2 Corinthians 5:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:14">1 Peter 4:14</span>). All "God's
	promises in Christ are yea" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+4:14- :">1 Peter 4:14- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>unto me</b>—omitted in A,
	B, C, <i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> and <i>Coptic.</i>
</p>
<p><b>that they may</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	includes also the idea, They are blessed, <i>in that they</i> SHALL
	<i>rest from their toils</i> (so the <i>Greek</i>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and</b>—So B and ANDREAS
	read. But A, C, <i>Vulgate,</i> and <i>Syriac</i> read "for."
	They rest from their toils <i>because</i> their time for toil is
	past; they enter on the <i>blessed rest because</i> of their faith
	evinced by their works which, therefore, "follow WITH
	(so the <i>Greek</i>) them." Their <i>works</i> are specified
	because respect is had to the coming judgment, wherein every man
	shall be "judged according to his works." His works do not
	go before the believer, nor even go by his side, but <i>follow</i>
	him at the same time that they go <i>with</i> him as a proof that he
	is Christ's.</p>
