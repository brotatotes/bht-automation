<p><b>15. Thrust in</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Send." The angel does not command the "Son of man"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:14">Revelation 14:14</span>), but is the mere
	messenger announcing to the Son the will of <i>God the Father,</i> in
	whose hands are kept <i>the times and the seasons.</i>
</p>
<p><b>thy sickle</b>—alluding to
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+4:29">Mark 4:29</span>, where also it is
	"<i>sendeth</i> the sickle." The Son sends His
	sickle-bearing angel to reap the righteous when fully ripe. 
	</p>
<p><b>harvest</b>—the harvest
	crop. By the <i>harvest</i>-reaping the elect righteous are gathered
	out; by the <i>vintage</i> the Antichristian offenders are removed
	out of the earth, the scene of Christ's coming kingdom. The Son of
	man Himself, with a golden crown, is introduced in the
	<i>harvest</i>-gathering of the elect, a mere angel in the <i>vintage</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:18-20">Revelation 14:18-20</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>is ripe</b>—literally, "is
	dried." Ripe for glory.</p>
