	is the subject of judgment because its grapes are not what God looked
	for considering its careful culture, but "wild grapes" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The apostate world of Christendom, not the world of
	heathendom who have not heard of Christ, is the object of judgment.
