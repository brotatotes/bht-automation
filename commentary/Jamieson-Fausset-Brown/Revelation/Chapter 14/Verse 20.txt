<p><b>20. without the city</b>—Jerusalem.
	The scene of the blood-shedding of Christ and His people shall be
	also the scene of God's vengeance on the Antichristian foe. Compare
	the "horsemen," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:16">Revelation 9:16</span>;

<p><b>blood</b>—answering to the
	red wine. The slaughter of the apostates is what is here spoken of,
	not their eternal punishment.

<p><b>even unto the horse
	bridles</b>—of the avenging "armies of heaven."

<p><b>by the space of a thousand .
	. . six hundred furlongs</b>—literally, "a thousand six
	hundred furlongs <i>off</i>" [W. KELLY].
	Sixteen hundred is a square number; four by four by one hundred. The
	<i>four</i> quarters, north, south, east, and west, of the Holy Land,
	or else of the world (the completeness and universality of the
	world-wide destruction being hereby indicated). It does not exactly
	answer to the length of Palestine as given by JEROME,
	one hundred sixty Roman miles. BENGEL
	thinks the valley of Kedron, between Jerusalem and the Mount of
	Olives, is meant, the torrent in that valley being about to be
	discolored with blood to the extent of sixteen hundred furlongs. This
	view accords with Joel's prophecy that the valley of Jehoshaphat is
	to be the scene of the overthrow of the Antichristian foes.</p>
