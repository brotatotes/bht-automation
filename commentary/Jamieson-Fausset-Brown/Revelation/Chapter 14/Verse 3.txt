<p><b>3. sung</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "sing."
	</p>
<p><b>as it were</b>—So A, C, and
	<i>Vulgate</i> read. It is "as it were" a <i>new song;</i>
	for it is, in truth, as old as God's eternal purpose. But B, <i>Syriac,
	Coptic,</i> ORIGEN, and
	ANDREAS omit these words. 
	</p>
<p><b>new song</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:10">Revelation 5:10</span>). The song is that of
	victory after conflict with the dragon, beast, and false prophet:
	never sung before, for such a conflict had never been fought before;
	therefore <i>new:</i> till now the kingdom of <i>Christ</i> on earth
	had been usurped; they sing the new song in anticipation of His
	blood-bought kingdom with His saints. 
	</p>
<p><b>four beasts</b>—rather, as
	<i>Greek,</i> "four living creatures." The harpers and
	singers evidently include the 144,000: so the parallel proves
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:2">Revelation 15:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:3">Revelation 15:3</span>),
	where the same act is attributed to <i>the general company of the
	saints,</i> the <i>harvest</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:3- :">Revelation 15:3- :</span>) from all nations. Not as ALFORD,
	"the harpers and song are in heaven, but the 144,000 are on
	earth." 
	</p>
<p><b>redeemed</b>—literally,
	"purchased." Not even the angels can learn that song, for
	they know not <i>experimentally</i> what it is to have "come out
	of the great tribulation, and washed their robes white in the blood
	of the Lamb" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span>).</p>
