<p><b>5. guile</b>—So ANDREAS
	in one copy. But A, B, C, ORIGEN,
	and ANDREAS in other
	copies read, "falsehood." Compare with <i>English Version</i>
	reading <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:2">Psalms 32:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+53:9">Isaiah 53:9</span>;

<p><b>for</b>—So B, <i>Syriac,
	Coptic,</i> ORIGEN, and
	ANDREAS read. But A and C
	omit. 
	</p>
<p><b>without fault</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"blameless": in respect to the sincerity of their fidelity
	to Him. Not absolutely, and in themselves <i>blameless;</i> but
	regarded as such on the ground of His righteousness in whom alone
	they trusted, and whom they faithfully served by His Spirit in them.
	The allusion seems to be to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+15:1">Psalms 15:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+15:2">Psalms 15:2</span>. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+15:2- :">Psalms 15:2- :</span>, "<i>stood on</i> Mount Sion."

<p><b>before the throne of God</b>—A,
	B, C, <i>Syriac, Coptic,</i> ORIGEN,
	and ANDREAS omit these
	words. The oldest <i>Vulgate</i> manuscript supports them.</p>
