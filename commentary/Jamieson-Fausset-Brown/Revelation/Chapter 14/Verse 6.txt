<p><b>6.</b> Here begins the portion
	relating to the Gentile world, as the former portion related to
	Israel. Before the <i>end</i> the Gospel is to be preached for a
	WITNESS <i>unto all
	nations:</i> not that all nations shall be converted, but all nations
	shall have had the opportunity given them of deciding whether they
	will be for, or against, Christ. Those thus <i>preached</i> to are
	"they that dwell (so A, <i>Coptic,</i> and <i>Syriac</i> read.
	But B, C, ORIGEN, <i>Vulgate,</i>
	CYPRIAN, 312, read, 'SIT,'
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:16">Matthew 4:16</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:79">Luke 1:79</span>,
	having their <i>settled</i> home) on the earth," being of earth
	earthy: this last season of grace is given them, if yet they may
	repent, before "judgment" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+1:79- :">Luke 1:79- :</span>) descends: if not, they will be left without excuse, as the
	world which resisted the preaching of Noah in the the hundred twenty
	years "while the long-suffering of God waited." "So
	also the prophets gave the people a last opportunity of repentance
	before the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, and our Lord and His
	apostles before the Roman destruction of the holy city"
	[AUBERLEN]. The <i>Greek</i>
	for "unto" (<i>epi,</i> in A and C) means literally,
	"upon," or "over," or "in respect to"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+9:12">Mark 9:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:13">Hebrews 7:13</span>).
	So also "TO every
	nation" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>epi,</i>" in A, B, C,
	<i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> ORIGEN,
	ANDREAS, CYPRIAN,
	and PRIMASIUS). This,
	perhaps, implies that the Gospel, though diffused <i>over</i> the
	globe, shall not come savingly <i>unto</i> any save the elect. The
	world is not to be evangelized till Christ shall come: meanwhile,
	God's purpose is "to take out of the Gentiles a people for His
	name," to be witnesses of the effectual working of His Spirit
	during the counter-working of "the mystery of iniquity." 
	</p>
<p><b>everlasting gospel</b>â€”the
	Gospel which announces the <i>glad tidings</i> of the <i>everlasting</i>
	kingdom of Christ, about to ensue immediately after the "judgment"
	on Antichrist, announced as imminent in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+7:13- :">Hebrews 7:13- :</span>. As the former angel "flying through the midst of
	heaven" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13">Revelation 8:13</span>)
	announced "woe," so this angel "flying in the midst of
	heaven" announced <i>joy.</i> The three angels making this last
	proclamation of the Gospel, the fall of Babylon (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13- :">Revelation 8:13- :</span>), the harlot, and the judgment on the beast worshippers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13- :">Revelation 8:13- :</span>), the voice from heaven respecting the blessed dead (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13- :">Revelation 8:13- :</span>), the vision of the Son of man on the cloud (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13- :">Revelation 8:13- :</span>), the harvest (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13- :">Revelation 8:13- :</span>), and the vintage (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:13- :">Revelation 8:13- :</span>), form the compendious summary, amplified in detail in the
	rest of the book.</p>
