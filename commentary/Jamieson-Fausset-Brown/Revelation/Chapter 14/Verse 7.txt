<p><b>7. Fear God</b>—the forerunner to

<p><b>give glory to him</b>—and
	not to the beast (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:4">Revelation 13:4</span>;

<p><b>the hour of his judgment</b>—"The

	worshippers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8-12">Revelation 14:8-12</span>).
	</p>
