<p><b>1. the seven last plagues</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"seven plagues which are the last." 
	</p>
<p><b>is filled up</b>—literally,
	"was finished," or "consummated": the prophetical
	past for the future, the future being to God as though it were past,
	so sure of accomplishment is His word. This verse is the summary of
	the vision that follows: the angels do not actually receive the vials
	till <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:7">Revelation 15:7</span>; but here, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:7- :">Revelation 15:7- :</span>, by anticipation they are spoken of as <i>having</i> them.
	There are no more plagues after these until the Lord's coming in
	judgment. The destruction of Babylon (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:7- :">Revelation 15:7- :</span>) is the last: then in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:7- :">Revelation 15:7- :</span> He appears.</p>
