<p><b>4. Who shall not</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"Who is there but must fear Thee?" Compare Moses' song, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, on the fear which God's judgments strike into the foe. 
	</p>
<p><b>thee</b>—so <i>Syriac.</i>
	But A, B, C, <i>Vulgate,</i> and CYPRIAN
	reject "thee." 
	</p>
<p><b>all nations shall
	come</b>—alluding to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+66:23">Isaiah 66:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+16:19">Jeremiah 16:19</span>. The conversion of <i>all
	nations,</i> therefore, shall be when Christ shall come, and not till
	then; and the first moving cause will be Christ's <i>manifested
	judgments</i> preparing all hearts for receiving Christ's mercy. He
	shall effect by His presence what we have in vain tried to effect in
	His absence. The present preaching of the Gospel is gathering out the
	elect remnant; meanwhile "the mystery of iniquity" is at
	work, and will at last come to its crisis; then shall judgment
	descend on the apostates at the <i>harvest-end of this age</i>
	(<i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:39">Matthew 13:39</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+13:40">Matthew 13:40</span>)
	when the tares shall be cleared out of the earth, which thenceforward
	becomes Messiah's kingdom. The confederacy of 'the apostates against
	Christ becomes, when overthrown with fearful judgments, the very
	means in God's overruling providence of preparing the nations not
	joined in the Antichristian league to submit themselves to Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>judgments</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"righteousnesses." 
	</p>
<p><b>are</b>—literally, "were":
	the prophetical past for the immediate future.</p>
