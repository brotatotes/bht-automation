<p><b>vials</b>—"bowls";
	a broad shallow cup or bowl. The breadth of the vials in their upper
	part would tend to cause their contents to pour out <i>all at once,</i>
	implying the overwhelming suddenness of the woes.

	sweetly do the <i>vials full of odors,</i> that is, the
	incense-perfumed prayers of the saints, contrast with these!</p>
