<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. THE SEVEN
	VIALS AND THE CONSEQUENT
	PLAGUES. 
	</p>
<p>The trumpets shook the world
	kingdoms in a longer process; the vials destroy with a swift and
	sudden overthrow the kingdom of "the beast" in particular
	who had invested himself with the world kingdom. The Hebrews thought
	the Egyptian plagues to have been inflicted with but an interval of a
	month between them severally [BENGEL,
	referring to SEDER OLAM].
	As Moses took ashes from an earthly common furnace, so angels, as
	priestly ministers in the heavenly temple, take holy fire in sacred
	vials or bowls, from the heavenly altar to pour down (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The same heavenly altar which would have kindled the sweet
	incense of prayer bringing down blessing upon earth, by man's sin
	kindles the fiery descending curse. Just as the river Nile, which
	ordinarily is the source of Egypt's fertility, became blood and a
	curse through Egypt's sin.</p>
