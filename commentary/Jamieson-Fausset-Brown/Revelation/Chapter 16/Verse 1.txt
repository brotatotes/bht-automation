<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:18-20">Revelation 14:18-20</span>) being
	called "the last," must belong to the period just when the
	term of the beast's power has expired (whence reference is made in
	them all to the worshippers of the beast as the objects of the
	judgments), close to the end or coming of the Son of man. The first
	four are distinguished from the last three, just as in the case of
	the seven seals and the seven trumpets. The first four are more
	general, affecting the earth, the sea, springs, and the sun, not
	merely a portion of these natural bodies, as in the case of the
	trumpets, but the whole of them; the last three are more particular,
	affecting the throne of the beast, the Euphrates, and the grand
	consummation. Some of these particular judgments are set forth in
	detail in the seventeenth through twentieth chapters.
