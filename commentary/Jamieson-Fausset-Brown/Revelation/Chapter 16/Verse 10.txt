<p><b>seat</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>throne</i> of the beast": set up in arrogant mimicry of
	God's throne; the dragon gave his throne to the beast (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>gnawed their tongues for

	occasioned by the previous plagues, rendered more appalling by the
	darkness. Or, as "gnashing of teeth" is one of the
	accompaniments of hell, so this "gnawing of their tongues"
	is through rage at the baffling of their hopes and the overthrow of
	their kingdom. They meditate revenge and are unable to effect it;
	hence their frenzy [GROTIUS].
	Those in anguish, mental and bodily, bite their lips and tongues.</p>
