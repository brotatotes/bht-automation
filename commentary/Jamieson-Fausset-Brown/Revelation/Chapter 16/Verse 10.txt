10. angel—omitted by A, B, C,
	Vulgate, and Syriac. But Coptic and ANDREAS
	support it. 
	seat—Greek,
	"throne of the beast": set up in arrogant mimicry of
	God's throne; the dragon gave his throne to the beast ( :-). 
	darkness—parallel to
	the Egyptian plague of darkness, Pharaoh being the type of Antichrist
	(compare Notes, see on  :-; compare the fifth trumpet,  :-). 
	gnawed their tongues for
	pain—Greek, "owing to the pain"
	occasioned by the previous plagues, rendered more appalling by the
	darkness. Or, as "gnashing of teeth" is one of the
	accompaniments of hell, so this "gnawing of their tongues"
	is through rage at the baffling of their hopes and the overthrow of
	their kingdom. They meditate revenge and are unable to effect it;
	hence their frenzy [GROTIUS].
	Those in anguish, mental and bodily, bite their lips and tongues.
