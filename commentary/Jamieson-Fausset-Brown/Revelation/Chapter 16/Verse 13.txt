<p><b>13. unclean spirits like frogs</b>—the
	antitype to the plague of frogs sent on Egypt. The presence of the
	"unclean spirit" in the land (Palestine) is foretold, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, in connection with idolatrous <i>prophets.</i> Beginning
	with infidelity as to Jesus Christ's coming in the flesh, men shall
	end in the grossest idolatry of the beast, the incarnation of all
	that is self-deifying and God-opposed in the world powers of all
	ages; having rejected Him that came in the Father's name, they shall
	worship one that comes in his own, though really the devil's
	representative; as frogs croak by night in marshes and quagmires, so
	these unclean spirits in the darkness of error teach lies amidst the
	mire of filthy lusts. They talk of <i>liberty,</i> but it is not
	Gospel liberty, but license for lust. There being <i>three,</i> as
	also <i>seven,</i> in the description of the last and worst state of
	the Jewish nation, implies a parody of the two divine numbers, <i>three</i>
	of the Trinity, and <i>seven</i> of the Holy Spirit (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Some observe that <i>three frogs</i> were the original arms
	of France, a country which has been the center of infidelity,
	socialism, and false spiritualism. A and B read, "<i>as it were</i>
	frogs," instead of "<i>like</i> frogs," which is not
	supported by manuscripts. The unclean spirit out of the mouth of <i>the
	dragon</i> symbolizes the proud infidelity which opposes God and
	Christ. That out of the <i>beast's</i> mouth is the spirit of the
	world, which in the politics of men, whether lawless democracy or
	despotism, sets man above God. That out of the mouth of the <i>false
	prophet</i> is lying spiritualism and religious delusion, which shall
	take the place of the harlot when she shall have been destroyed.

<p><b>the dragon</b>—Satan, who
	<i>gives his power and throne</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) <i>to the beast.</i>
</p>
<p><b>false prophet</b>—distinct
	from the harlot, the apostate Church (of which Rome is the chief,
	though not sole, representative), <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1-3">Revelation 17:1-3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:16">Revelation 17:16</span>; and identical with <i>the
	second beast,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:16- :">Revelation 17:16- :</span>, as appears by comparing <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20">Revelation 19:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:13">Revelation 13:13</span>; ultimately consigned
	to the lake of fire with the first beast; as is also the dragon a
	little later (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>). The
	dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, "the mystery of
	iniquity," form a blasphemous Antitrinity, the counterfeit of
	"the mystery of godliness" God manifests in Christ,
	witnessed to by the Spirit. The dragon acts the part of God the
	Father, assigning his authority to his representative the beast, as
	the Father assigns His to the Son. They are accordingly jointly
	worshipped; compare as to the Father and Son, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10- :">Revelation 20:10- :</span>; as the ten-horned beast has its ten horns crowned with
	<i>diadems</i> (<i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10- :">Revelation 20:10- :</span>), so Christ has on His head <i>many diadems.</i> While the
	false prophet, like the Holy Ghost, speaks not of himself, but tells
	all men to worship the beast, and confirms his testimony to the beast
	by <i>miracles,</i> as the Holy Ghost attested similarly to Christ's
	divine mission.</p>
