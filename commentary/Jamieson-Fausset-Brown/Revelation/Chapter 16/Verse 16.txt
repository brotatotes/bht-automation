<p><b>16. he</b>—rather, "they (the
	three unclean spirits) gathered them together." If <i>English
	Version</i> be retained, "He" will refer to <i>God</i> who
	gives them over to the delusion of the three unclean spirits; or else
	<i>the sixth angel</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:12">Revelation 16:12</span>).

<p><b>Armageddon</b>—<i>Hebrew,</i>
	"<i>Har,</i>" a mountain, and "<i>Megiddo</i>" in
	Manasseh in Galilee, the scene of the overthrow of the Canaanite
	kings by God's miraculous interposition under Deborah and Barak; the
	same as the great plain of Esdraelon. Josiah, too, as the ally of
	Babylon, was defeated and slain at Megiddo; and the mourning of the
	Jews at the time just before God shall interpose for them against all
	the nations confederate against Jerusalem, is compared to the
	mourning for Josiah at Megiddo. <i>Megiddo</i> comes from a root,
	<i>gadad,</i> "cut off," and means <i>slaughter.</i>
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+3:2">Joel 3:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+3:12">Joel 3:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+3:14">Joel 3:14</span>, where "the valley
	of Jehoshaphat" (meaning in <i>Hebrew,</i> "judgment of
	God") is mentioned as the scene of God's final vengeance on the
	God-opposing foe. Probably some great plain, antitypical to the
	valleys of Megiddo and Jehoshaphat, will be the scene.</p>
