	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span>, below, explains the

	successfully to seduce her by the allurements of the world; unlike
	her Lord, she was overcome by this temptation; hence she is seen
	<i>sitting on the scarlet-colored beast,</i> no longer the wife, but
	the harlot; no longer Jerusalem, but spiritually Sodom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1-66.12.6- :">Revelation 12:1-66.12.6- :</span>).</p>
