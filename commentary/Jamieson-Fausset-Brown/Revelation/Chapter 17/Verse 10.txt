<p><b>10. there are</b>—Translate, "they
	(the seven heads) are seven kings." 
	</p>
<p><b>five . . . one</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the five . . . the one"; the first five of the seven are
	<i>fallen</i> (a word applicable not to <i>forms of government
	passing away,</i> but to the <i>fall</i> of once powerful empires:
	Egypt, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+29:1-30">Ezekiel 29:1-30</span>;
	Assyria and Nineveh, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+29:1-26.29.30- :">Ezekiel 29:1-26.29.30- :</span>; Babylon, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:2">Revelation 18:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+50:1-51">Jeremiah 50:1-51</span>; Medo-Persia,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:3-7">Daniel 8:3-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:20-22">Daniel 8:20-22</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+10:13">Daniel 10:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:2">Daniel 11:2</span>;
	Greece, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:4">Daniel 11:4</span>). <i>Rome</i>
	was "the one" existing in John's days. "Kings" is
	the Scripture phrase for <i>kingdoms,</i> because these kingdoms are
	generally represented in character by some one prominent head, as
	Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, Medo-Persia by Cyrus, Greece by Alexander,
	c.

<p><b>the other is not yet come</b>—not
	as ALFORD, inaccurately
	representing AUBERLEN, <i>the
	Christian</i> empire <i>beginning with Constantine</i> but, the
	<i>Germanic-Slavonic</i> empire <i>beginning</i> and continuing in
	its beast-like, that is, HEATHEN
	Antichristian character for only "a short space." The time
	when it is said of it, "it is not" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:4- :">Daniel 11:4- :</span>), is the <i>time</i> during which it is "wounded to
	death," and has the "deadly wound" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+11:4- :">Daniel 11:4- :</span>). The external Christianization of the migrating hordes from
	the North which descended on Rome, is the <i>wound</i> to the beast
	answering to the <i>earth swallowing up the flood</i> (heathen
	tribes) sent by the dragon, Satan, to drown the woman, the Church.
	The emphasis palpably is on "a <i>short</i> space," which
	therefore comes first in the <i>Greek,</i> not on "he must
	continue," as if his <i>continuance for some</i> [considerable]
	<i>time</i> were implied, as ALFORD
	wrongly thinks. The time of external Christianization (while the
	beast's wound continues) has lasted for centuries, ever since
	Constantine. Rome and the Greek Church have partially healed the
	wound by image worship.</p>
