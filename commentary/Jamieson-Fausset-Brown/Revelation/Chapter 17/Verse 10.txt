10. there are—Translate, "they
	(the seven heads) are seven kings." 
	five . . . one—Greek,
	"the five . . . the one"; the first five of the seven are
	fallen (a word applicable not to forms of government
	passing away, but to the fall of once powerful empires:
	Egypt, Ezekiel 29:1-30;
	Assyria and Nineveh, Ezekiel 29:1-26.29.30- :; Babylon, Revelation 18:2;
	Jeremiah 50:1-51; Medo-Persia,
	Daniel 8:3-7; Daniel 8:20-22;
	Daniel 10:13; Daniel 11:2;
	Greece, Daniel 11:4). Rome
	was "the one" existing in John's days. "Kings" is
	the Scripture phrase for kingdoms, because these kingdoms are
	generally represented in character by some one prominent head, as
	Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, Medo-Persia by Cyrus, Greece by Alexander,
	c. 
	the other is not yet come—not
	as ALFORD, inaccurately
	representing AUBERLEN, the
	Christian empire beginning with Constantine but, the
	Germanic-Slavonic empire beginning and continuing in
	its beast-like, that is, HEATHEN
	Antichristian character for only "a short space." The time
	when it is said of it, "it is not" (Daniel 11:4- :), is the time during which it is "wounded to
	death," and has the "deadly wound" (Daniel 11:4- :). The external Christianization of the migrating hordes from
	the North which descended on Rome, is the wound to the beast
	answering to the earth swallowing up the flood (heathen
	tribes) sent by the dragon, Satan, to drown the woman, the Church.
	The emphasis palpably is on "a short space," which
	therefore comes first in the Greek, not on "he must
	continue," as if his continuance for some [considerable]
	time were implied, as ALFORD
	wrongly thinks. The time of external Christianization (while the
	beast's wound continues) has lasted for centuries, ever since
	Constantine. Rome and the Greek Church have partially healed the
	wound by image worship.
