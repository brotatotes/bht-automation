<p><b>11. beast that . . . is not</b>—his
	beastly character being kept down by outward Christianization of the
	state until he starts up to life again as "the eighth"
	king, his "wound being healed" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), Antichrist manifested in fullest and most intense
	opposition to God. The "he" is emphatic in the <i>Greek.
	He,</i> peculiarly and pre-eminently: answering to "the little
	horn" with eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking
	great things, before whom <i>three of the ten horns were plucked up
	by the roots,</i> and to whom the whole ten "give their power
	and strength" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:12">Revelation 17:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:13">Revelation 17:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:17">Revelation 17:17</span>).
	That a <i>personal</i> Antichrist will stand at the head of the
	Antichristian kingdom, is likely from the analogy of Antiochus
	Epiphanes, the Old Testament Antichrist, "the little horn"
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:9-12">Daniel 8:9-12</span>; also, "the
	man of sin, son of perdition" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:9-27.8.12- :">Daniel 8:9-27.8.12- :</span>), answers here to "goeth into perdition," and is
	applied to an individual, namely, Judas, in the only other passage
	where the phrase occurs (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+8:9-27.8.12- :">Daniel 8:9-27.8.12- :</span>). He is essentially a child of destruction, and hence he
	has but a little time ascended out of the bottomless pit, when he
	"goes into perdition" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:11">Revelation 17:11</span>). "While the
	Church passes through death of the flesh to glory of the Spirit, the
	beast passes through the glory of the flesh to death"

<p><b>is of the seven</b>—rather
	"springs <i>out of</i> the seven." The eighth is not merely
	one of the seven restored, but a new power or person proceeding <i>out
	of</i> the seven, and at the same time embodying all the God-opposed
	features of the previous seven concentrated and consummated; for
	which reason there are said to be not <i>eight,</i> but only <i>seven</i>
	heads, for the eighth is the embodiment of all the seven. In the
	birth-pangs which prepare the "regeneration" there are
	<i>wars, earthquakes,</i> and <i>disturbances</i> [AUBERLEN],
	wherein Antichrist takes his rise ("sea," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>;

	He does not <i>fall</i> like the other seven (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+21:9-42.21.11- :">Luke 21:9-42.21.11- :</span>), but is <i>destroyed, going to</i> his own <i>perdition,</i>
	by the Lord in person.</p>
