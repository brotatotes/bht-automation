<p><b>17. hath put</b>—the prophetical
	past tense for the future.

<p><b>fulfil</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"do," or "accomplish." The <i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>poiesai,</i>" is distinct from that which is
	translated, "fulfilled," <i>Greek,</i> "<i>telesthesontai,</i>"
	below. 
	</p>
<p><b>his will</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"his mind," or <i>purpose;</i> while they think only of
	doing their own purpose. 
	</p>
<p><b>to agree</b>—literally, "to
	do" (or <i>accomplish</i>) one mind" or "purpose."
	A and <i>Vulgate</i> omit this clause, but B supports it. 
	</p>
<p><b>the words of God</b>—foretelling
	the rise and downfall of the beast; <i>Greek,</i> "<i>hoi
	logoi,</i>" in A, B, and ANDREAS.
	<i>English Version</i> reading is <i>Greek,</i> "<i>ta rhemata,</i>"
	which is not well supported. No mere articulate utterances, but the
	efficient <i>words</i> of Him who is <i>the Word: Greek,</i> "<i>logos.</i>"
