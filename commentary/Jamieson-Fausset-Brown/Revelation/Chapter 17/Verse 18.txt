<p><b>18. reigneth</b>â€”literally, "<i>hath
	kingship</i> over the kings." The harlot cannot be a mere <i>city</i>
	literally, but is called so in a spiritual sense (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Also the beast cannot represent a spiritual power, but a
	world power. In this verse the harlot is presented before us ripe for
	judgment. The eighteenth chapter details that judgment.</p>
