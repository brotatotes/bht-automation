	"owing to." It cannot be pagan Rome, but papal Rome, if a
	particular seat of error be meant, but I incline to think that the

	though finding their culmination in Rome, are not restricted to it,
	but comprise the whole apostate Church, Roman, Greek, and even
	Protestant, so far as it has been seduced from its "first love"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:4">Revelation 2:4</span>) to Christ, the heavenly
	Bridegroom, and given its affections to worldly pomps and idols. The
	<i>woman</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:1">Revelation 12:1</span>) is the
	congregation of God in its purity under the Old and New Testament,
	and appears again as the Bride of the Lamb, the transfigured Church
	prepared for the marriage feast. The woman, the invisible Church, is
	latent in the apostate Church, and is the Church militant; the Bride
	is the Church triumphant.</p>
