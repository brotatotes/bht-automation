<p><b>I wondered with great
	admiration</b>—As the <i>Greek</i> is the same in the verb and the
	noun, translate the latter "wonder." John certainly did not
	<i>admire</i> her in the modern English sense. Elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:8">Revelation 17:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:3">Revelation 13:3</span>), all the earthly-minded
	("they that dwell on the earth") <i>wonder</i> in
	admiration of the beast. Here only is John's <i>wonder</i> called
	forth; not the <i>beast,</i> but the woman sunken into the harlot,
	the Church become a world-loving apostate, moves his sorrowful
	astonishment at so awful a change. That the world should be beastly
	is natural, but that the faithful bride should become the whore is
	monstrous, and excites the same amazement in him as the same awful
	change in Israel excited in Isaiah and Jeremiah. "Horrible
	thing" in them answers to "abominations" here.
	"<i>Corruptio optimi pessima</i>"; when the Church falls,
	she sinks lower than the godless world, in proportion as her right
	place is higher than the world. It is striking that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:3- :">Revelation 13:3- :</span>, "woman" has not the article, "<i>the</i>
	woman," as if she had been before mentioned: for though
	identical in one sense with the <i>woman,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:3- :">Revelation 13:3- :</span>, in another sense she is not. The elect are never
	perverted into apostates, and still remain as <i>the</i> true <i>woman</i>
	invisibly contained in the <i>harlot;</i> yet Christendom regarded as
	<i>the woman</i> has apostatized from its first <i>faith.</i></p>
