6. martyrs—witnesses. 
	I wondered with great
	admiration—As the Greek is the same in the verb and the
	noun, translate the latter "wonder." John certainly did not
	admire her in the modern English sense. Elsewhere (Revelation 17:8;
	Revelation 13:3), all the earthly-minded
	("they that dwell on the earth") wonder in
	admiration of the beast. Here only is John's wonder called
	forth; not the beast, but the woman sunken into the harlot,
	the Church become a world-loving apostate, moves his sorrowful
	astonishment at so awful a change. That the world should be beastly
	is natural, but that the faithful bride should become the whore is
	monstrous, and excites the same amazement in him as the same awful
	change in Israel excited in Isaiah and Jeremiah. "Horrible
	thing" in them answers to "abominations" here.
	"Corruptio optimi pessima"; when the Church falls,
	she sinks lower than the godless world, in proportion as her right
	place is higher than the world. It is striking that in Revelation 13:3- :, "woman" has not the article, "the
	woman," as if she had been before mentioned: for though
	identical in one sense with the woman, Revelation 13:3- :, in another sense she is not. The elect are never
	perverted into apostates, and still remain as the true woman
	invisibly contained in the harlot; yet Christendom regarded as
	the woman has apostatized from its first faith.
