<p><b>seven heads and seven
	mountains</b>—The connection between <i>mountains and kings</i>
	must be deeper than the mere outward fact to which incidental
	allusion is made, that Rome (the then world city) is on seven hills
	(whence heathen Rome had a national festival called <i>Septimontium,</i>
	the feast of the seven-hilled city [PLUTARCH];
	and on the imperial coins, just as here, she is represented as a
	<i>woman seated on seven hills.</i> Coin of Vespasian, described by
	CAPTAIN SMYTH
	[<i>Roman Coins,</i> p. 310; ACKERMAN,
	1, p. 87]). The seven heads can hardly be at once seven <i>kings</i>
	or <i>kingdoms</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:10">Revelation 17:10</span>),
	and seven geographical <i>mountains.</i> The true connection is, as
	the <i>head</i> is the prominent part of the body, so the <i>mountain</i>
	is prominent in the land. Like "sea" and "earth"and
	"waters . . . peoples" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:10- :">Revelation 17:10- :</span>), so "mountains" have a symbolical meaning,
	namely, prominent seats of power. Especially such as are prominent
	hindrances to the cause of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:16">Psalms 68:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+68:17">Psalms 68:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+40:4">Isaiah 40:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+41:15">Isaiah 41:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+49:11">Isaiah 49:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+35:2">Ezekiel 35:2</span>); especially Babylon
	(which geographically was in a <i>plain,</i> but spiritually is
	called a destroying <i>mountain,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+35:2- :">Ezekiel 35:2- :</span>), in majestic contrast to which stands Mount Zion, "the
	mountain of the Lord's house" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+35:2- :">Ezekiel 35:2- :</span>), and the heavenly mount; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+35:2- :">Ezekiel 35:2- :</span>, "a great and high mountain . . . and that great city,
	the holy Jerusalem." So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+35:2- :">Ezekiel 35:2- :</span>, the <i>stone</i> becomes a <i>mountain</i>—Messiah's
	universal kingdom supplanting the previous world kingdoms. As nature
	shadows forth the great realities of the spiritual world, so
	seven-hilled Rome is a representative of the seven-headed world power
	of which the dragon has been, and is the prince. The "seven
	kings" are hereby distinguished from the "ten kings"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:12">Revelation 17:12</span>): the former are
	what the latter are not, "mountains," great seats of the
	world power. The seven universal God-opposed monarchies are Egypt
	(the first world power which came into collision with God's people,)
	Assyria, Babylon, Greece, Medo-Persia, Rome, the Germanic-Slavonic
	empire (the <i>clay</i> of the fourth kingdom mixed with its iron in
	Nebuchadnezzar's image, a <i>fifth</i> material, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:33">Daniel 2:33</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:34">Daniel 2:34</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:42">Daniel 2:42</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+2:43">Daniel 2:43</span>, symbolizing this last
	head). These seven might seem not to accord with the seven heads in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:4-7">Daniel 7:4-7</span>, <i>one</i> head
	on the first beast (Babylon), <i>one</i> on the second (Medo-Persia),
	<i>four</i> on the third (Greece; namely, Egypt, Syria, Thrace with
	Bithynia, and Greece with Macedon): but Egypt and Greece are in both
	lists. Syria answers to Assyria (from which the name Syria is
	abbreviated), and Thrace with Bithynia answers to the
	Gothic-Germanic-Slavonic hordes which, pouring down on Rome from the
	North, founded the Germanic-Slavonic empire. <i>The woman sitting on
	the seven hills</i> implies the Old and New Testament Church
	conforming to, and resting on, the world power, that is, on all the
	seven world kingdoms. Abraham and Isaac dissembling as to their wives
	through fear of the kings of Egypt foreshadowed this. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+16:1-63">Ezekiel 16:1-63</span>;
