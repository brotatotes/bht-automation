<p><b>merchandise</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"cargo": wares carried in <i>ships:</i> ship-lading
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:17">Revelation 18:17</span>). Rome was
	not a commercial city, and is not likely from her position to be so.
	The <i>merchandise</i> must therefore be spiritual, even as the
	harlot is not literal, but spiritual. She did not witness against
	carnal luxury and pleasure-seeking, the source of the <i>merchants'</i>
	gains, but conformed to them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:17- :">Revelation 18:17- :</span>). She cared not for the sheep, but for the wool. Professing
	Christian merchants in her lived as if this world not heaven, were
	the reality, and were unscrupulous as to the means of getting gain.
	Compare <i>Notes,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:17- :">Revelation 18:17- :</span>,
	on the same subject, the judgment on mystical <i>Babylon's</i>
	merchants for unjust gain. All the merchandise here mentioned occurs
	repeatedly in the <i>Roman Ceremonial.</i></p>
