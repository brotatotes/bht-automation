	for better purposes: being an ingredient in the holy anointing oil,
	and a plant in the garden of the Beloved (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); but desecrated to vile uses by the adulteress (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>souls of men</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mal+1:11- :">Malachi 1:11- :</span>). Said of <i>slaves.</i> Appropriate to the spiritual
	harlot, apostate Christendom, especially Rome, which has so often
	<i>enslaved</i> both <i>bodies</i> and <i>souls</i> of men. Though
	the New Testament does not directly forbid slavery, which would, in
	the then state of the world, have incited a slave revolt, it
	virtually condemns it, as here. Popery has derived its greatest gains
	from the sale of masses for <i>the souls of men</i> after death, and
	of indulgences purchased from the Papal chancery by rich merchants in
	various countries, to be retailed at a profit [MOSHEIM,
	III, 95, 96].</p>
