17. is come to naught—Greek,
	"is desolated." 
	shipmaster—Greek,
	"steersman," or "pilot." 
	all the company in ships—A,
	C, Vulgate, and Syriac read, "Every one who
	saileth to a place" (B has ". . . to the place"),
	every voyager. Vessels were freighted with pilgrims to various
	shrines, so that in one month (A.D.
	1300) two hundred thousand pilgrims were counted in Rome [D'AAUBIGNE,
	Histoire de la Reformation]: a source of gain, not only to the
	Papal see, but to shipmasters, merchants, pilots, &c.
	These latter, however, are not restricted to those literally
	"shipmasters," &c., but mainly refer, in the mystical
	sense, to all who share in the spiritual traffic of apostate
	Christendom.
