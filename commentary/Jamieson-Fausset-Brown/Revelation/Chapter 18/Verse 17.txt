	saileth to a place" (B has ". . . to <i>the</i> place"),
	<i>every voyager. Vessels</i> were freighted with pilgrims to various
	shrines, so that in one month (A.D.
	1300) two hundred thousand pilgrims were counted in Rome [D'AAUBIGNE,
	<i>Histoire de la Reformation</i>]: a source of gain, not only to the
	Papal see, but to <i>shipmasters, merchants, pilots,</i> &amp;c.
	These latter, however, are not restricted to those literally
	"shipmasters," &amp;c., but mainly refer, in the mystical
	sense, to all who share in the spiritual traffic of apostate
	Christendom.</p>
