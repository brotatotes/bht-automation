<p><b>18. when they saw</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>horontes.</i>" But A, B, C, and ANDREAS
	read, <i>Greek,</i> "<i>blepontes,</i>" "looking at."
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>blepo,</i>" is to <i>use the eyes,</i> to
	<i>look:</i> the act of seeing without thought of the object seen.
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>horao,</i>" refers to the thing <i>seen</i>
	or presented to the eyes [TITTMANN].

	the similar beast as to <i>the beast,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>: so closely do the harlot and beast approximate one another.
	Contrast the attribution of this praise to God, to whom alone it is
	due, by <i>His</i> servants (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). MARTIAL says
	of Rome, "Nothing is equal to her;" and ATHENÆUS,
	"She is the epitome of the world."</p>
