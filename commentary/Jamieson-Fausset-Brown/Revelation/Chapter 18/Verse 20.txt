<p><b>20. holy apostles</b>—So C reads.
	But A, B, <i>Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic,</i> and ANDREAS
	read, "Ye <i>saints and ye</i> apostles." 
	</p>
<p><b>avenged you on her</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"judged your judgment on (literally, exacting it <i>from</i>)
	her." "There is more joy in heaven at the harlot's downfall
	than at that of the two beasts. For the most heinous of all sin is
	the sin of those who know God's word of grace, and keep it not. The
	worldliness of the Church is the most worldly of all worldliness.
	Hence, Babylon, in Revelation, has not only Israel's sins, but also
	the sins of the heathen; and John dwells longer on the abominations
	and judgments of the harlot than on those of the beast. The term
	'harlot' describes the false Church's essential character. She
	retains her human shape as the <i>woman,</i> does not become a <i>beast:</i>
	she has the form of godliness, but denies its power. Her rightful
	lord and husband, Jehovah-Christ, and the joys and goods of His
	house, are no longer her all in all, but she runs after the visible
	and vain things of the world, in its manifold forms. The fullest form
	of her whoredom is, where the Church wishes to be itself a worldly
	power, uses politics and diplomacy, makes flesh her arm, uses unholy
	means for holy ends, spreads her dominion by sword or money,
	fascinates men by sensual ritualism, becomes 'mistress of ceremonies'
	to the dignitaries of the world, flatters prince or people, and like
	Israel, seeks the help of one world power against the danger
	threatening from another" [AUBERLEN].
	<i>Judgment,</i> therefore, <i>begins with</i> the harlot, as in
	privileges <i>the house of God.</i></p>
