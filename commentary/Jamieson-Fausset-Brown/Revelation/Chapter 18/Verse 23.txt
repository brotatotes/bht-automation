<p><b>23.</b> What a blessed contrast is
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5">Revelation 22:5</span>, respecting the city of
	God: "They need <i>no candle</i> (just as Babylon shall <i>no
	more</i> have <i>the light of a candle,</i> but for a widely
	different reason), for the Lord God giveth them light." 
	</p>
<p><b>candle</b>—Translate as
	<i>Greek,</i> "lamp." 
	</p>
<p><b>bridegroom . . . bride . . .
	no more . . . in thee</b>—Contrast the heavenly city, with its
	<i>Bridegroom, Bride,</i> and blessed <i>marriage supper</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:7">Revelation 19:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:2">Revelation 21:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:9">Revelation 21:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+62:4">Isaiah 62:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+62:5">Isaiah 62:5</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>thy merchants were</b>—So
	most of the best authorities read. But A omits the <i>Greek</i>
	article before "merchants," and then translates, "The
	great men of . . . were thy merchants." 
	</p>
<p><b>sorceries</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"sorcery."</p>
