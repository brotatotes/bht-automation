24. Applied by Christ ( :-) to apostate Jerusalem, which proves that not merely the
	literal city Rome, and the Church of Rome (though the chief
	representative of the apostasy), but the WHOLE
	of the faithless Church of both the Old and New Testament is meant by
	Babylon the harlot; just as the whole Church (Old and New Testament)
	is meant by "the woman" ( :-). As to literal city, ARINGHUS
	in BENGEL says, Pagan Rome
	was the "general shambles" for slaying the sheep of Jesus.
	FRED. SEYLER
	in BENGEL calculates that
	papal Rome, between A.D.
	1540 and 1580, slew more than nine hundred thousand Protestants.
	Three reasons for the harlot's downfall are given: (1) The worldly
	greatness of her merchants, which was due to unholy
	traffic in spiritual things. (2) Her sorceries, or juggling
	tricks, in which the false prophet that ministers to the beast in its
	last form shall exceed her; compare "sorcerers" (Revelation 21:8;
	Revelation 22:15), specially mentioned
	among those doomed to the lake of fire. (3) Her persecution of (Old
	Testament) "prophets" and (New Testament) "saints."
