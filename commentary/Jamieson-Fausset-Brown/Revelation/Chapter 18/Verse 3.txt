<p><b>3. drunk</b>— <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, from which perhaps "the wine" may have been
	interpolated. They have <i>drunk of her fornication,</i> the
	consequence of which will be <i>wrath</i> to themselves. But A, B,
	and C read, "(owing to the wrath of her fornication all nations)
	have <i>fallen.</i>" <i>Vulgate</i> and most versions read as
	<i>English Version,</i> which may be the right reading though not
	supported by the oldest manuscripts. Babylon, the whore, is destroyed
	before the beast slays the two witnesses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and then the beast himself is destroyed.

<p><b>the wine</b>—so B, <i>Syriac,</i>

<p><b>abundance</b>—literally,
	"power."

<p><b>delicacies</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"luxury." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>,
	where the <i>Greek</i> verb "wax wanton" is akin to the
	noun here. Translate, "wanton luxury." The reference is not
	to earthly merchandise, but to spiritual wares, indulgences,
	idolatries, superstitions, worldly compromises, wherewith the harlot,
	that is, the apostate Church, has made <i>merchandise</i> of men.
	This applies especially to Rome; but the <i>Greek,</i> and even in a
	less degree Protestant churches, are not guiltless. However, the
	<i>principle</i> of evangelical Protestantism is pure, but the
	<i>principle</i> of Rome and the Greek church is not so.</p>
