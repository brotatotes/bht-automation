<p><b>4. Come out of her, my people</b>—quoted
	from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+50:8">Jeremiah 50:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:6">Jeremiah 51:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:45">Jeremiah 51:45</span>. Even in the Romish
	Church God has a people: but they are in great danger; their only
	safety is in coming out of her at once. So also in every apostate or
	world-conforming church there are some of God's invisible and true
	Church, who, if they would be safe, must come out. Especially at the
	eve of God's judgment on apostate Christendom: as Lot was warned to
	come out of Sodom just before its destruction, and Israel to come
	from about the tents of Dathan and Abiram. So the first Christians
	came out of Jerusalem when the apostate Jewish Church was judged.
	"State and Church are precious gifts of God. But the State being
	desecrated to a different end from what God designed it, namely. to
	govern for, and as under, God, becomes beast-like; the Church
	apostatizing becomes the harlot. The true woman is the kernel: beast
	and harlot are the shell: whenever the kernel is mature, the shell is
	thrown away" [AUBERLEN].
	"The harlot is not Rome alone (though she is pre-eminently so),
	but every Church that has not Christ's mind and spirit. False
	Christendom, divided into very many sects, is truly Babylon, that is,
	confusion. However, in all Christendom the true Jesus-congregation,
	the woman clothed with the sun, lives and is hidden. Corrupt,
	lifeless Christendom is the harlot, whose great aim is the pleasure
	of the flesh, and which is governed by the spirit of nature and the
	world" [HAHN in
	AUBERLEN]. The first
	justification of the woman is in her being called out of Babylon the
	harlot, as the culminating stage of the latter's sin, when judgment
	is about to fall: for apostate Christendom, Babylon, is not to be
	converted, but to be destroyed. Secondly, she has to pass through an
	ordeal of persecution from the beast, which purifies and prepares her
	for the transfiguration glory at Christ's coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4">Revelation 20:4</span>;
