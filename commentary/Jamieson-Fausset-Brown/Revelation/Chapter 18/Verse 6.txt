<p><b>6.</b> Addressed to the executioners
	of God's wrath. 
	</p>
<p><b>Reward</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"repay." 
	</p>
<p><b>she rewarded</b>—<i>English
	Version</i> reading adds "you" with none of the oldest
	manuscripts. But A, B, C, <i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> and <i>Coptic</i>
	omit it. She had not <i>rewarded</i> or <i>repaid</i> the world power
	for some injury which the world power had inflicted on her; but she
	had <i>given</i> the world power that which was its <i>due,</i>
	namely, spiritual delusions, because it did not like to retain God in
	its knowledge; the unfaithful Church's principle was, "<i>Populus
	vult decipi, et decipiatur.</i>" "The people like to be
	deceived, and let them be deceived." 
	</p>
<p><b>double</b>—of sorrow.
	Contrast with this the <i>double</i> of joy which Jerusalem shall
	receive for her past suffering (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+61:7">Isaiah 61:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:12">Zechariah 9:12</span>); even as she has
	received <i>double</i> punishment for her sins (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+9:12- :">Zechariah 9:12- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>unto her</b>—So <i>Syriac,
	Coptic,</i> and ANDREAS.
	A, B, and C omit it. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the cup</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:3">Revelation 18:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:8">Revelation 14:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:4">Revelation 17:4</span>).

<p><b>filled</b>—literally
	"mixed."

<p><b>fill to her double</b>—of
	the Lord's cup of wrath.</p>
