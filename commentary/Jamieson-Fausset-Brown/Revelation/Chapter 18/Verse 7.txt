<p><b>shall see no sorrow</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"mourning." "I am seated (<i>this long time</i>) . . .
	I <i>am</i> no widow . . . I <i>shall</i> see no sorrow," marks
	her complete unconcerned security as to the past, present, and future
	[BENGEL]. I shall never
	have to mourn as one bereft of her husband. As Babylon was queen of
	the East, so Rome has been queen of the West, and is called on
	Imperial coins "the <i>eternal</i> city." So Papal Rome is
	called by AMMIAN MARCELLIN
	[15.7]. "Babylon is a former Rome, and Rome a latter Babylon.
	Rome is a daughter of Babylon, and by her, as by her mother, God has
	been pleased to subdue the world under one sway" [AUGUSTINE].
	As the Jew's restoration did not take place till Babylon's fall, so
	R. KIMCHI on Obadiah,
	writes, "When Rome (Edom) shall be devastated, there shall be
	redemption to Israel." Romish idolatries have been the great
	stumbling-blocks to the Jews' acceptance of Christianity.</p>
