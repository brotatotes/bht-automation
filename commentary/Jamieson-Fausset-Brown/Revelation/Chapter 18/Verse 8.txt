<p><b>8. death</b>—on herself, though
	she thought herself secure even from the death of her husband. 
	</p>
<p><b>mourning</b>—instead of her
	feasting. 
	</p>
<p><b>famine</b>—instead of her
	<i>luxurious delicacies</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:3">Revelation 18:3</span>;

<p><b>fire</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:7- :">Revelation 18:7- :</span>). Literal fire may burn the literal city of Rome, which is
	situated in the midst of volcanic agencies. As the ground was cursed
	for Adam's sin, and the earth under Noah was sunk beneath the flood,
	and Sodom was burnt with fire, so may Rome be. But as the harlot is
	mystical (the whole faithless Church), the <i>burning</i> may be
	mainly mystical, symbolizing utter destruction and removal. BENGEL
	is probably right in thinking Rome will once more rise to power. The
	carnal, faithless, and worldly elements in all churches, Roman,
	Greek, and Protestant, tend towards one common center, and prepare
	the way for the last form of the beast, namely, Antichrist. The
	Pharisees were in the main sound in creed, yet judgment fell on them
	as on the unsound Sadducees and half-heathenish Samaritans. So
	faithless and adulterous, carnal, worldly Protestant churches, will
	not escape for their soundness of creed.

<p><b>the Lord</b>—so B, C,
	<i>Syriac,</i> and ANDREAS.
	But A and <i>Vulgate</i> omit. "Strong" is the meaning of
	God's <i>Hebrew</i> name, "EL."
	</p>
<p><b>judgeth</b>—But A, B, and C
	read the <i>past</i> tense (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>krinas</i>"),
	"who <i>hath judged</i> her": the prophetical past for the
	future: the charge in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:4">Revelation 18:4</span>
	to God's people to <i>come out of her</i> implies that the judgment
	was not yet actually executed.</p>
