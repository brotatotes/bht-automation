<p><b>9. lived deliciously</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"luxuriated." The faithless Church, instead of reproving,
	connived at the self-indulgent luxury of the great men of this world,
	and sanctioned it by her own practice. Contrast the world's <i>rejoicing</i>
	over the dead bodies of the two witnesses (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) who had tormented it by their faithfulness, with its
	<i>lamentations</i> over the harlot who had made the way to heaven
	smooth, and had been found a useful tool in keeping subjects in
	abject tyranny. Men's carnal mind relishes a religion like that of
	the apostate Church, which gives an opiate to conscience, while
	leaving the sinner license to indulge his lusts.
