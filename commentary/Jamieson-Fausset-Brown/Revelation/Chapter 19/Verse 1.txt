1. As in the case of the opening
	of the prophecy, Revelation 4:8; Revelation 5:9,
	c. so now, at one of the great closing events seen in vision, the
	judgment on the harlot (described in Revelation 5:9- :), there is a song of praise in heaven to God: compare Revelation 5:9- :, c., toward the close of the seals, and Revelation 5:9- :, at the close of the trumpets: Revelation 5:9- :, at the saints' victory over the beast. 
	And—so ANDREAS.
	But A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic omit. 
	a great voice—A, B, C,
	Vulgate, Coptic, and ANDREAS
	read, "as it were a great voice." What a contrast to
	the lamentations Revelation 5:9- :! Compare Jeremiah 51:48.
	The great manifestation of God's power in destroying Babylon
	calls forth a great voice of praise in heaven.
people—Greek,
	"multitude." 
	Alleluia—Hebrew,
	"Praise ye JAH,"
	or JEHOVAH: here first
	used in Revelation, whence ELLICOTT
	infers the Jews bear a prominent part in this thanksgiving.
	JAH is not a contraction
	of "JEHOVAH," as
	it sometimes occurs jointly with the latter. It means "He who
	Is": whereas Jehovah is "He who will be, is, and was."
	It implies God experienced as a PRESENT
	help so that "Hallelujah," says KIMCHI
	in BENGEL, is found first
	in the Psalms on the destruction of the ungodly. "Hallelu-Jah"
	occurs four times in this passage. Compare Jeremiah 51:48- :, which is plainly parallel, and indeed identical in many
	of the phrases, as well as the general idea. Israel, especially, will
	join in the Hallelujah, when "her warfare is accomplished"
	and her foe destroyed. 
	Salvation, &c.—Greek,
	"The salvation . . . the glory . . . the power." 
	and honour—so Coptic.
	But A, B, C, and Syriac omit. 
	unto the Lord our God—so
	ANDREAS. But A, B, C, and
	Coptic read, "(Is) of our God," that is, belongs to
	Him.
