<p><b>1.</b> As in the case of the opening
	of the prophecy, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9">Revelation 5:9</span>,
	c. so now, at one of the great closing events seen in vision, the
	judgment on the harlot (described in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9- :">Revelation 5:9- :</span>), there is a song of praise in heaven to God: compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9- :">Revelation 5:9- :</span>, c., toward the close of the seals, and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9- :">Revelation 5:9- :</span>, at the close of the trumpets: <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9- :">Revelation 5:9- :</span>, at the saints' victory over the beast. 
	</p>
<p><b>And</b>—so ANDREAS.
	But A, B, C, <i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> and <i>Coptic</i> omit. 
	</p>
<p><b>a great voice</b>—A, B, C,
	<i>Vulgate, Coptic,</i> and ANDREAS
	read, "<i>as it were</i> a great voice." What a contrast to
	the lamentations <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:9- :">Revelation 5:9- :</span>! Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:48">Jeremiah 51:48</span>.
	The <i>great</i> manifestation of God's power in destroying Babylon
	calls forth a <i>great voice</i> of praise <i>in heaven.</i>
</p>
<p><b>people</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"multitude." 
	</p>
<p><b>Alleluia</b>—<i>Hebrew,</i>
	"Praise ye JAH,"
	or JEHOVAH: here first
	used in Revelation, whence ELLICOTT
	infers the <i>Jews</i> bear a prominent part in this thanksgiving.
	JAH is not a contraction
	of "JEHOVAH," as
	it sometimes occurs jointly with the latter. It means "He who
	Is": whereas Jehovah is "He who will be, is, and was."
	It implies God experienced as a PRESENT
	help so that "Hallelujah," says KIMCHI
	in BENGEL, is found first
	in the Psalms <i>on the destruction of the ungodly.</i> "Hallelu-Jah"
	occurs four times in this passage. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+51:48- :">Jeremiah 51:48- :</span>, which is plainly parallel, and indeed identical in many
	of the phrases, as well as the general idea. Israel, especially, will
	join in the Hallelujah, when "her warfare is accomplished"
	and her foe destroyed. 
	</p>
<p><b>Salvation,</b> &amp;c.—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>The</i> salvation . . . the glory . . . the power." 
	</p>
<p><b>and honour</b>—so <i>Coptic.</i>
	But A, B, C, and <i>Syriac</i> omit. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto the Lord our God</b>—so
	ANDREAS. But A, B, C, and
	<i>Coptic</i> read, "(Is) of our God," that is, belongs to
	Him.</p>
