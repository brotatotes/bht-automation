<p><b>11. behold a white horse; and he
	that sat upon him</b>â€”identical with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Here as there he comes forth "conquering and to
	conquer." Compare the <i>ass</i>-colt on which He rode into
	Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:1-7">Matthew 21:1-7</span>).
	The <i>horse</i> was used for war: and here He is going forth to war
	with the beast. The <i>ass</i> is for peace. His riding on it into
	Jerusalem is an earnest of His reign in Jerusalem over the earth, as
	the <i>Prince of peace,</i> after all hostile powers have been
	overthrown. When the security of the world power, and the distress of
	the people of God, have reached the highest point, the Lord Jesus
	shall appear visibly from heaven to put an end to the whole course of
	the world, and establish His kingdom of glory. He comes to judge with
	vengeance the world power, and to bring to the Church redemption,
	transfiguration, and power over the world. Distinguish between this
