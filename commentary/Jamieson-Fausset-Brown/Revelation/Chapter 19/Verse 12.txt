<p><b>many crowns</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"diadems": not merely (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>stephanoi</i>")
	garlands of victory, but royal crowns, as KING
	OF KINGS. Christ's diadem comprises all the diadems of the
	earth and of heavenly powers too. Contrast the papal tiara composed
	of three <i>diadems.</i> Compare also the little horn (Antichrist)
	that overcomes the <i>three</i> horns or kingdoms, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:8">Daniel 7:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:24">Daniel 7:24</span> (<i>Quære, the Papacy?</i>
	or some <i>three</i> kingdoms that succeed the papacy, which itself,
	as a temporal kingdom, was made up at first of <i>three</i> kingdoms,
	the exarchate of Ravenna, the kingdom of the Lombards, and the state
	of Rome, obtained by Pope Zachary and Stephen II from Pepin, the
	usurper of the French dominion). Also, the <i>seven crowns</i>
	(diadems) <i>on the seven heads of the dragon</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:24- :">Daniel 7:24- :</span>), and <i>ten diadems on the ten heads of the beast.</i>
	These usurpers claim the diadems which belong to Christ alone.

<p><b>name . . . that no man knew

<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:9">1 Corinthians 2:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:11">1 Corinthians 2:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:2">1 John 3:2</span>). The same is said of the
	"new name" of believers. In this, as in all other respects,
	the disciple is made like his Lord. The Lord's own "new name"
	is to be theirs, and to be "in their foreheads"; whence we
	may infer that His as yet <i>unknown</i> name also is written on His
	forehead; as the high priest had "Holiness to the Lord"
	inscribed on the miter on his brow. John saw it as "written,"
	but <i>knew not</i> its meaning. It is, therefore, a name which in
	all its glorious significancy can be only understood when the union
	of His saints with Him, and His and their joint triumph and reign,
	shall be perfectly manifested at the final consummation.</p>
