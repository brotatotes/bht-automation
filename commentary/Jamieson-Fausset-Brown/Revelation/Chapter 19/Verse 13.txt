<p><b>13. vesture dipped in blood</b>—
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+63:2">Isaiah 63:2</span> is alluded to here,
	and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:15">Revelation 19:15</span>, end. There
	the <i>blood</i> is not His own, but that of His foes. So here the
	blood on His "vesture," reminding us of <i>His own blood</i>
	shed for even the ungodly who trample on it, is a premonition of the
	shedding of <i>their blood</i> in righteous retribution. He sheds the
	blood, not of the godly, as the harlot and beast did, but of the
	blood-stained ungodly, including them both. 
	</p>
<p><b>The Word of God</b>—who
	made the world, is He also who under the same character and
	attributes shall make it anew. His title, <i>Son of God,</i> is
	applicable in a lower sense, also to His people; but "the Word
	of God" indicates His incommunicable Godhead, joined to His
	manhood, which He shall then manifest in glory. "The Bride does
	not fear the Bridegroom; her love casteth out fear. She welcomes Him;
	she cannot be happy but at His side. The Lamb [<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:15- :">Revelation 19:15- :</span>, the aspect of Christ to His people at His coming] is the
	symbol of Christ in His gentleness. Who would be afraid of a lamb?
	Even a little child, instead of being scared, desires to caress it.
	There is nothing to make us afraid of God but sin, and Jesus is the
	<i>Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.</i> What a
	fearful contrast is the aspect which He will wear towards His
	enemies! Not as the Bridegroom and the Lamb, but as the [avenging]
	judge and warrior stained in the blood of His enemies."</p>
