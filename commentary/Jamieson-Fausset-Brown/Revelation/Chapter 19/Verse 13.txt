13. vesture dipped in blood—
	Isaiah 63:2 is alluded to here,
	and in Revelation 19:15, end. There
	the blood is not His own, but that of His foes. So here the
	blood on His "vesture," reminding us of His own blood
	shed for even the ungodly who trample on it, is a premonition of the
	shedding of their blood in righteous retribution. He sheds the
	blood, not of the godly, as the harlot and beast did, but of the
	blood-stained ungodly, including them both. 
	The Word of God—who
	made the world, is He also who under the same character and
	attributes shall make it anew. His title, Son of God, is
	applicable in a lower sense, also to His people; but "the Word
	of God" indicates His incommunicable Godhead, joined to His
	manhood, which He shall then manifest in glory. "The Bride does
	not fear the Bridegroom; her love casteth out fear. She welcomes Him;
	she cannot be happy but at His side. The Lamb [Revelation 19:15- :, the aspect of Christ to His people at His coming] is the
	symbol of Christ in His gentleness. Who would be afraid of a lamb?
	Even a little child, instead of being scared, desires to caress it.
	There is nothing to make us afraid of God but sin, and Jesus is the
	Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. What a
	fearful contrast is the aspect which He will wear towards His
	enemies! Not as the Bridegroom and the Lamb, but as the [avenging]
	judge and warrior stained in the blood of His enemies."
