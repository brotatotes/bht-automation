15. out of his mouth . . . sword—
	(Revelation 1:16; Revelation 2:12;
	Revelation 2:16). Here in its avenging
	power, 2 Thessalonians 2:8, "consume
	with the Spirit of His mouth" (2 Thessalonians 2:8- :, to which there is allusion here); not in its convicting and
	converting efficacy (Ephesians 6:17;
	Hebrews 4:12; Hebrews 4:13,
	where also the judicial keenness of the sword-like word is included).
	The Father commits the judgment to the Son. 
	he shall rule—The HE is
	emphatic, He and none other, in contrast to the usurpers who have
	misruled on earth. "Rule," literally, "tend as a
	shepherd"; but here in a punitive sense. He, who would have
	shepherded them with pastoral rod and with the golden scepter
	of His love, shall dash them in pieces, as refractory rebels, with "a
	rod of iron." 
	treadeth . . . wine-press—
	(Isaiah 63:3). 
	of the fierceness and
	wrath—So ANDREAS
	reads. But A, B, Vulgate, Coptic, and ORIGEN
	read, "of the fierceness (or boiling indignation) of the
	wrath," omitting "and." 
	Almighty—The fierceness
	of Christ's wrath against His foes will be executed with the
	resources of omnipotence.
