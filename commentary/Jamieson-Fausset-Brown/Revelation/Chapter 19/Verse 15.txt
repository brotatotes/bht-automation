	with the Spirit <i>of His mouth</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2th+2:8- :">2 Thessalonians 2:8- :</span>, to which there is allusion here); not in its convicting and

<p><b>he shall rule</b>—The HE is
	emphatic, He and none other, in contrast to the usurpers who have
	misruled on earth. "Rule," literally, "tend as a
	shepherd"; but here in a punitive sense. He, who would have
	<i>shepherded</i> them with pastoral rod and with the golden scepter
	of His love, shall dash them in pieces, as refractory rebels, with "a
	rod of iron."

<p><b>of the fierceness and
	wrath</b>—So ANDREAS
	reads. But A, B, <i>Vulgate, Coptic,</i> and ORIGEN
	read, "of the fierceness (or <i>boiling indignation</i>) of the
	wrath," omitting "and." 
	</p>
<p><b>Almighty</b>—The fierceness
	of Christ's wrath against His foes will be executed with the
	resources of omnipotence.</p>
