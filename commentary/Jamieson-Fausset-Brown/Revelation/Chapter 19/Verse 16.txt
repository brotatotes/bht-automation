<p><b>16.</b> "His name written on
	His vesture and on His thigh," was written partly on the
	vesture, partly on the thigh itself, at the part where in an
	equestrian figure the robe drops from the thigh. The <i>thigh</i>
	symbolizes Christ's humanity as having come, after the flesh, from
	the <i>loins</i> of David, and now appearing as the glorified "Son
	of man." On the other hand, His incommunicable divine name,
	"which no man knew," is on His head (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), [MENOCHIUS].
