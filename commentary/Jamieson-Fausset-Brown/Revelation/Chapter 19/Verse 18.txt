	<i>Greek</i> it is plural: <i>masses of flesh</i>) five times in this
	verse, marks the gross <i>carnality</i> of the followers of the
	beast. Again, the giving of their flesh to the fowls to eat, is a
	righteous retribution for their not suffering <i>the dead bodies</i>
	of Christ's <i>witnesses to be put in graves.</i></p>
