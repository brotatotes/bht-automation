<p><b>7. glad . . . rejoice</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"rejoice . . . exult."

<p><b>the marriage of the Lamb is
	come</b>—The <i>full</i> and <i>final</i> consummation is at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, c. Previously there must be the overthrow of the beast,
	&amp;c., at the Lord's coming, the binding of Satan, the millennial
	reign, the loosing of Satan and his last overthrow, and the general
	judgment. The elect-Church, the heavenly Bride, soon after the
	destruction of the harlot, is transfigured at the Lord's coming, and
	joins with Him in His triumph over the beast. On the emblem of the
	heavenly Bridegroom and Bride, compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+22:2">Matthew 22:2</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:10">Matthew 25:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>. Perfect union with Him
	personally, and participation in His holiness; joy, glory, and
	kingdom, are included in this symbol of "marriage"; compare
	Song of Solomon everywhere. Besides the <i>heavenly</i> Bride, the
	transfigured, translated, and risen Church, reigning <i>over</i> the
	earth with Christ, there is also the <i>earthly</i> bride, Israel, in
	the flesh, never yet <i>divorced,</i> though for a time separated,
	from her divine husband, who shall then be reunited to the Lord, and
	be the mother Church of the millennial earth, Christianized through
	her. Note, we ought, as Scripture does, restrict the language drawn
	from marriage-love to <i>the Bride,</i> the Church <i>as a whole;</i>
	not use it as individuals in our relation to Christ, which Rome does
	in the case of her nuns. Individually, believers are
	effectually-<i>called guests;</i> collectively, they constitute <i>the
	bride.</i> The harlot divides her affections among many lovers: the
	bride gives hers exclusively to Christ.</p>
