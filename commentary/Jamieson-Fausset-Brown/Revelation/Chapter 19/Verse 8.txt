<p><b>8. granted</b>—Though in one sense
	<i>she</i> "made herself ready," having by the Spirit's
	work in her put on "the wedding garment," yet in the
	fullest sense it is not she, but her Lord, who makes her ready by
	"<i>granting</i> to her that she be arrayed in fine linen."
	It is He who, by <i>giving Himself for</i> her, <i>presents her to
	Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, but holy and without
	blemish.</i> It is He also who sanctifies her, naturally vile and
	without beauty, <i>with the washing of water by the word, and puts
	His own comeliness on her,</i> which thus becomes hers.

<p><b>clean and white</b>—so
	ANDREAS. But A and B
	transpose. Translate, "bright and pure"; at once
	brilliantly <i>splendid</i> and <i>spotless</i> as in the bride
	herself.

<p><b>righteousness</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"righteousnesses"; distributively used. <i>Each</i> saint
	must have this righteousness: not merely be justified, as if the
	righteousness belonged to the Church <i>in the aggregate;</i> the
	saints together have <i>righteousnesses;</i> namely, He is <i>accounted
	as</i> "the Lord our righteousness" to each saint on his
	believing, their robes being made <i>white in the blood of the Lamb.</i>
	The righteousness of the saint is not, as ALFORD
	erroneously states, <i>inherent,</i> but is <i>imputed:</i> if it
	were otherwise, Christ would be merely enabling the sinner to justify
	himself. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span> is decisive on
	this. Compare Article XI, Church of England. The justification
	already given to the saints in title and unseen possession, is now
	GIVEN them <i>in
	manifestation: they</i> openly <i>walk with Christ in white.</i> To
	this, rather than to their primary justification on earth, the
	reference is here. Their justification before the apostate world,
	which had persecuted them, contrasts with the judgment and
	condemnation of the harlot. "Now that the harlot has fallen, the
	woman triumphs" [AUBERLEN].
	Contrast with the <i>pure fine linen</i> (indicating the simplicity
	and purity) of the bride, the tawdry ornamentation of the harlot.
	Babylon, the apostate Church, is the antithesis to new Jerusalem, the
	transfigured Church of God. The woman (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18- :">Romans 5:18- :</span>), the harlot (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18- :">Romans 5:18- :</span>), the bride (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18- :">Romans 5:18- :</span>), are the three leading aspects of the Church.</p>
