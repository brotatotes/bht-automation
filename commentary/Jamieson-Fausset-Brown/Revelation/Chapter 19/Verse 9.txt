<p><b>9. He</b>—God by His angel <i>saith
	unto me.</i>
</p>
<p><b>called</b>—effectually, not
	merely externally. The "unto," or into," seems to
	express this: not merely invited <i>to</i> (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>epi</i>"),
	but called INTO, so as to
	be <i>partakers of</i> (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>eis</i>");
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+1:9">1 Corinthians 1:9</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>marriage supper</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the supper of the marriage." Typified by the Lord's
	Supper. 
	</p>
<p><b>true</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"genuine"; veritable sayings which shall surely be
	fulfilled, namely, all the previous revelations.</p>
