<p><b>1. Ephesus</b>—famed for the
	temple of Diana, one of the seven wonders of the world. For three
	years Paul labored there. He subsequently ordained Timothy
	superintending overseer or bishop there: probably his charge was but
	of a temporary nature. John, towards the close of his life, took it
	as the center from which he superintended the province.

<p><b>holdeth</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"holdeth fast," as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:25">Revelation 2:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:11">Revelation 3:11</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:28">John 10:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:29">John 10:29</span>. The title of Christ
	here as "holding fast the seven stars (from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+10:29- :">John 10:29- :</span>: only that, for <i>having</i> is substituted <i>holding fast</i>
	in His grasp), and walking in the midst of the seven candlesticks,"
	accords with the beginning of His address to the <i>seven</i>
	churches representing the universal Church. <i>Walking</i> expresses
	His unwearied activity in the Church, guarding her from internal and
	external evils, as the high priest moved to and fro in the sanctuary.</p>
