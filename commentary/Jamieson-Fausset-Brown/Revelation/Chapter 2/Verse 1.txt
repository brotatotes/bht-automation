1. Ephesus—famed for the
	temple of Diana, one of the seven wonders of the world. For three
	years Paul labored there. He subsequently ordained Timothy
	superintending overseer or bishop there: probably his charge was but
	of a temporary nature. John, towards the close of his life, took it
	as the center from which he superintended the province. 
	holdeth—Greek,
	"holdeth fast," as in Revelation 2:25;
	Revelation 3:11; compare John 10:28;
	John 10:29. The title of Christ
	here as "holding fast the seven stars (from John 10:29- :: only that, for having is substituted holding fast
	in His grasp), and walking in the midst of the seven candlesticks,"
	accords with the beginning of His address to the seven
	churches representing the universal Church. Walking expresses
	His unwearied activity in the Church, guarding her from internal and
	external evils, as the high priest moved to and fro in the sanctuary.
