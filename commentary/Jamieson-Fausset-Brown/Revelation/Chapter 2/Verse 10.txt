<p><b>10. Fear none,</b> c.—the oldest
	manuscripts read, "Fear <i>not</i> those things," &amp;c.
	"The Captain of our salvation never keeps back what those who
	faithfully witness for Him may have to bear for His name's sake never
	entices recruits by the promise they shall find all things easy and
	pleasant there" [TRENCH].

<p><b>devil</b>—"the
	accuser." He acted, through Jewish <i>accusers</i> against
	Christ and His people. The conflict of the latter was not with mere
	flesh and blood, but with the rulers of the darkness of this world. 
	</p>
<p><b>tried</b>—with <i>temptation</i>
	by "the devil." The same event is often both a <i>temptation</i>
	from the devil, and a <i>trial</i> from God—God sifting and
	winnowing the man to separate his chaff from his wheat, the devil
	sifting him in the hope that nothing but chaff will be found in him
	[TRENCH].

<p><b>ten days</b>—not the ten
	persecutions from Nero to Diocletian. LYRA
	explains <i>ten years</i> on the year-day principle. The <i>shortness</i>
	of the duration of the persecution is evidently made the ground of
	consolation. The time of trial shall be short, the duration of your
	joy shall be for ever. Compare the use of "ten days" for a
	short time, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+24:55">Genesis 24:55</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:19">Numbers 11:19</span>.
	<i>Ten</i> is the number of the world powers hostile to the Church;
	compare the <i>ten</i> horns of the beast, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+11:19- :">Numbers 11:19- :</span>.

<p><b>unto death</b>—so as even
	to endure death for My sake. 
	</p>
<p><b>crown of life</b>— <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:12">James 1:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>, "crown of
	righteousness"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1pe+5:4">1 Peter 5:4</span>,
	"crown of glory." The <i>crown</i> is the <i>garland,</i>
	the mark of a <i>conqueror,</i> or of one <i>rejoicing,</i> or at a
	<i>feast;</i> but <i>diadem</i> is the mark of a KING.</p>
