<p><b>11. shall not be hurt</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"shall not by any means (or possibly) be hurt." 
	</p>
<p><b>the second death</b>—"the
	lake of fire." "The death in life of the lost, as
	contrasted with the life in death of the saved" [TRENCH].
	The phrase "the second death" is peculiar to the
	Apocalypse. What matter about the first death, which sooner or later
	must pass over us, if we escape <i>the second death?</i> "It
	seems that they who die that death shall be <i>hurt</i> by it;
	whereas, if it were annihilation, and so a conclusion of their
	torments, it would be no way hurtful, but highly beneficial to them.
	But the living torments are the second death" [BISHOP
	PEARSON]. "The life
	of the damned is death" [AUGUSTINE].
	Smyrna (meaning <i>myrrh</i>) yielded its sweet perfume in being
	bruised even to death. Myrrh was used in embalming dead bodies (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); was an ingredient in the holy anointing oil (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); a perfume of the heavenly Bridegroom (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and of the bride (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "Affliction, like it, is <i>bitter</i> for the time
	being, but <i>salutary;</i> preserving the elect from <i>corruption,</i>
	and <i>seasoning</i> them for immortality, and gives scope for the
	exercise of the <i>fragrantly breathing</i> Christian virtues"
	[VITRINGA]. POLYCARP'S
	noble words to his heathen judges who wished him to recant, are well
	known: "Fourscore and six years have I served the Lord, and He
	never wronged me, how then can I blaspheme my King and Saviour?"
	Smyrna's faithfulness is rewarded by its candlestick not having been
	removed out of its place (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5">Revelation 2:5</span>);
	Christianity has never wholly left it; whence the Turks call it,
	"Infidel Smyrna."</p>
