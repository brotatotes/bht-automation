	Balaam—"the teaching of Balaam," namely, that
	which he "taught Balak." Compare "the counsel of
	Balaam," Numbers 31:16. "Balak"
	is dative in the Greek, whence BENGEL
	translates, "taught (the Moabites) for (that is, to please)
	Balak." But though in Numbers it is not expressly said he taught
	Balak, yet there is nothing said inconsistent with his having
	done so; and JOSEPHUS
	[Antiquities,4. 6. 6], says he did so. The dative case is a
	Hebraism for the accusative case.

	Israelites, namely, that they sacrificed to idols. The
	temptation to eat idol-meats was a peculiarly strong one to the
	Gentile converts. For not to do so involved almost a withdrawal from
	partaking of any social meal with the heathen around. For idol-meats,
	after a part had been offered in sacrifice, were nearly sure to be on
	the heathen entertainer's table; so much so, that the Greek
	"to kill" (thuein) meant originally "to
	sacrifice." Hence arose the decree of the council of Jerusalem
	forbidding to eat such meats; subsequently some at Corinth ate
	unscrupulously and knowingly of such meats, on the ground that
	the idol is nothing; others needlessly tortured themselves with
	scruples, lest unknowingly they should eat of them when they
	got meat from the market or in a heathen friend's house. Paul handles
	the question in 1 Corinthians 8:1-13;
