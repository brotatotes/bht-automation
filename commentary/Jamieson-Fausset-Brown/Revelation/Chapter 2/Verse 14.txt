<p><b>hold the doctrine of

	which he "taught Balak." Compare "the counsel of
	Balaam," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+31:16">Numbers 31:16</span>. "Balak"
	is dative in the <i>Greek,</i> whence BENGEL
	translates, "taught (the Moabites) for (that is, to please)
	Balak." But though in Numbers it is not expressly said he taught
	<i>Balak,</i> yet there is nothing said inconsistent with his having
	done so; and JOSEPHUS
	[<i>Antiquities,</i>4. 6. 6], says he did so. The dative case is a
	Hebraism for the accusative case.

<p><b>eat things sacrificed unto
	idols</b>—the act common to the Israelites of old, and the
	Nicolaitanes in John's day; he does not add what was peculiar to the
	Israelites, namely, that they <i>sacrificed</i> to idols. The
	temptation to eat idol-meats was a peculiarly strong one to the
	Gentile converts. For not to do so involved almost a withdrawal from
	partaking of any social meal with the heathen around. For idol-meats,
	after a part had been offered in sacrifice, were nearly sure to be on
	the heathen entertainer's table; so much so, that the <i>Greek</i>
	"to kill" (<i>thuein</i>) meant originally "to
	sacrifice." Hence arose the decree of the council of Jerusalem
	forbidding to eat such meats; subsequently some at Corinth ate
	unscrupulously and <i>knowingly</i> of such meats, on the ground that
	the idol is nothing; others needlessly tortured themselves with
	scruples, lest <i>unknowingly</i> they should eat of them when they
	got meat from the market or in a heathen friend's house. Paul handles
	the question in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+8:1-13">1 Corinthians 8:1-13</span>;
