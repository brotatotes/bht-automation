15. thou—emphatic: "So
	THOU also hast," As
	Balak and the Moabites of old had Balaam and his followers literally,
	so hast thou also them that hold the same Balaamite or
	Nicolaitane doctrine spiritually or symbolically. Literal
	eating of idol-meats and fornication in Pergamos were accompanied by
	spiritual idolatry and fornication. So TRENCH
	explains. But I prefer taking it, "THOU
	also," as well as Ephesus ("in like manner" as
	Ephesus; see below the oldest reading), hast . . . Nicolaitanes, with
	this important difference, Ephesus, as a Church, hates them
	and casts them out, but thou "hast them," namely, in
	the Church. 
	doctrine—teaching (see
	on Revelation 2:6): namely, to tempt
	God's people to idolatry. 
	which thing I hate—It
	is sin not to hate what God hates. The Ephesian Church (Revelation 2:6- :) had this point of superiority to Pergamos. But the three
	oldest manuscripts, and Vulgate and Syriac, read
	instead of "which I hate," "IN
	LIKE MANNER."
