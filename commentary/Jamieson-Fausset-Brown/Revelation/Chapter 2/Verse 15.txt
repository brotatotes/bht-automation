<p><b>15. thou</b>—emphatic: "So
	THOU also hast," As
	Balak and the Moabites of old had Balaam and his followers literally,
	<i>so hast thou also them that hold the</i> same Balaamite or
	<i>Nicolaitane doctrine</i> spiritually or symbolically. Literal
	eating of idol-meats and fornication in Pergamos were accompanied by
	spiritual idolatry and fornication. So TRENCH
	explains. But I prefer taking it, "THOU
	<i>also,</i>" as well as Ephesus ("in like manner" as
	Ephesus; see below the oldest reading), hast . . . Nicolaitanes, with
	this important difference, Ephesus, as a Church, <i>hates them</i>
	and casts them out, but thou "<i>hast them,</i>" namely, in
	the Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>doctrine</b>—teaching (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6">Revelation 2:6</span>): namely, to tempt
	God's people to idolatry. 
	</p>
<p><b>which thing I hate</b>—It
	is sin not to hate what God hates. The Ephesian Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:6- :">Revelation 2:6- :</span>) had this point of superiority to Pergamos. But the three
	oldest manuscripts, and <i>Vulgate</i> and <i>Syriac,</i> read
	instead of "which I hate," "IN
	LIKE MANNER."</p>
