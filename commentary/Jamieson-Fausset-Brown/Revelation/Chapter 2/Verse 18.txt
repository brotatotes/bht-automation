<p><b>18. Thyatira</b>—in Lydia, south
	of Pergamos. Lydia, the purple-seller of this city, having been
	converted at Philippi, a Macedonian city (with which Thyatira, as
	being a Macedonian colony, had naturally much intercourse), was
	probably the instrument of first carrying the Gospel to her native
	town. John follows the geographical order here, for Thyatira lay a
	little to the left of the road from Pergamos to Sardis [STRABO,
	13:4].

<p><b>Son of God . . . eyes like .
	. . fire . . . feet . . . like fine brass</b>—or "glowing
	brass" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:14">Revelation 1:14</span>,
	whence this description is resumed). Again His attributes accord with
	His address. The title "Son of God," is from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:7">Psalms 2:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+2:9">Psalms 2:9</span>, which is referred to in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27">Revelation 2:27</span>. The attribute, "eyes
	like a flame," &amp;c., answers to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27- :">Revelation 2:27- :</span>, "I am He which searcheth the reins and hearts."
	The attribute, "feet like . . . brass," answers to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:27- :">Revelation 2:27- :</span>, "as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to
	shivers," He <i>treading</i> them <i>to pieces</i> with His
	strong feet.</p>
