18. Thyatira—in Lydia, south
	of Pergamos. Lydia, the purple-seller of this city, having been
	converted at Philippi, a Macedonian city (with which Thyatira, as
	being a Macedonian colony, had naturally much intercourse), was
	probably the instrument of first carrying the Gospel to her native
	town. John follows the geographical order here, for Thyatira lay a
	little to the left of the road from Pergamos to Sardis [STRABO,
	13:4]. 
	Son of God . . . eyes like .
	. . fire . . . feet . . . like fine brass—or "glowing
	brass" (see on Revelation 1:14,
	whence this description is resumed). Again His attributes accord with
	His address. The title "Son of God," is from Psalms 2:7;
	Psalms 2:9, which is referred to in
	Revelation 2:27. The attribute, "eyes
	like a flame," &c., answers to Revelation 2:27- :, "I am He which searcheth the reins and hearts."
	The attribute, "feet like . . . brass," answers to Revelation 2:27- :, "as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to
	shivers," He treading them to pieces with His
	strong feet.
