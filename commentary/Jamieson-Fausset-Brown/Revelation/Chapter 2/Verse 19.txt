<p><b>19.</b> The oldest manuscripts
	transpose the <i>English Version</i> order, and read, "faith and
	service." The four are subordinate to "thy works";
	thus, "I know thy works, <i>even</i> the love and the faith
	(these two forming one pair, as 'faith works by love,' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and the service (<i>ministration</i> to the suffering
	members of the Church, and to all in spiritual or temporal need), and
	the endurance of (that is, shown by) thee (this pronoun belongs to
	all four)." As <i>love</i> is inward, so <i>service</i> is its
	outward manifestation. Similarly, <i>faith</i> and persevering
	<i>endurance,</i> or "<i>patient continuance</i> (the same <i>Greek</i>
	as here, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:7">Romans 2:7</span>) in well-doing,"
	are connected.

<p><b>and thy works; and the
	last</b>â€”Omit the second "and," with the three oldest
	manuscripts and the ancient versions; translate, "And (I know)
	thy works which are last (to be) more in number than the first";
	realizing <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:1">1 Thessalonians 4:1</span>; the converse
	of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+12:45">Matthew 12:45</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+2:20">2 Peter 2:20</span>.
	Instead of retrograding from "the first works" and "first
	love," as Ephesus, Thyatira's <i>last works</i> exceeded her
	<i>first</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:4">Revelation 2:4</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:5">Revelation 2:5</span>).</p>
