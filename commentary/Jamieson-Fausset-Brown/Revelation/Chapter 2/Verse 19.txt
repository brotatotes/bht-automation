19. The oldest manuscripts
	transpose the English Version order, and read, "faith and
	service." The four are subordinate to "thy works";
	thus, "I know thy works, even the love and the faith
	(these two forming one pair, as 'faith works by love,'  :-), and the service (ministration to the suffering
	members of the Church, and to all in spiritual or temporal need), and
	the endurance of (that is, shown by) thee (this pronoun belongs to
	all four)." As love is inward, so service is its
	outward manifestation. Similarly, faith and persevering
	endurance, or "patient continuance (the same Greek
	as here, Romans 2:7) in well-doing,"
	are connected. 
	and thy works; and the
	lastâ€”Omit the second "and," with the three oldest
	manuscripts and the ancient versions; translate, "And (I know)
	thy works which are last (to be) more in number than the first";
	realizing 1 Thessalonians 4:1; the converse
	of Matthew 12:45; 2 Peter 2:20.
	Instead of retrograding from "the first works" and "first
	love," as Ephesus, Thyatira's last works exceeded her
	first (Revelation 2:4; Revelation 2:5).
