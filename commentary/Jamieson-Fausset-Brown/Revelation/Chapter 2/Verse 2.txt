2. I know thy works—expressing
	His omniscience. Not merely "thy professions, desires, good
	resolutions" (Revelation 14:13,
	end). 
	thy labour—Two oldest
	manuscripts omit "thy"; one supports it. The Greek
	means "labor unto weariness." 
	patience—persevering
	endurance.
bear—evil men
	are a burden which the Ephesian Church regarded as
	intolerable. We are to "bear (the same Greek, Revelation 14:13- :) one another's burdens" in the case of weak
	brethren; but not to bear false brethren.
tried—by experiment;
	not the Greek for "test," as Revelation 14:13- :. The apostolical churches had the miraculous gift of
	discerning spirits. Compare Revelation 14:13- :, wherein Paul presciently warned the Ephesian
	elders of the coming false teachers, as also in writing to Timothy at
	Ephesus. TERTULLIAN [On
	Baptism, 17], and JEROME
	[On Illustrious Men, in Lucca 7], record of John, that when a
	writing, professing to be a canonical history of the acts of Paul,
	had been composed by a presbyter of Ephesus, John convicted the
	author and condemned the work. So on one occasion he would not remain

	say they are
	apostles—probably Judaizers. IGNATIUS
	[Epistle to the Ephesians, 6], says subsequently, "Onesimus
	praises exceedingly your good discipline that no heresy dwells among
	you"; and [Epistle to the Ephesians, 9], "Ye did not
	permit those having evil doctrine to sow their seed among you, but
	closed your ears."
