<p><b>2. I know thy works</b>—expressing
	His omniscience. Not merely "thy professions, desires, good
	resolutions" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13">Revelation 14:13</span>,
	end). 
	</p>
<p><b>thy labour</b>—Two oldest
	manuscripts omit "thy"; one supports it. The <i>Greek</i>
	means "labor <i>unto weariness.</i>" 
	</p>
<p><b>patience</b>—persevering
	<i>endurance.</i>
</p>
<p><b>bear</b>—<i>evil men</i>
	are a <i>burden</i> which the Ephesian Church regarded as
	intolerable. We are to "<i>bear</i> (the same <i>Greek,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13- :">Revelation 14:13- :</span>) one another's burdens" in the case of <i>weak</i>
	brethren; but not to bear <i>false brethren.</i>
</p>
<p><b>tried</b>—by experiment;
	not the <i>Greek</i> for "test," as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13- :">Revelation 14:13- :</span>. The apostolical churches had the miraculous gift of
	<i>discerning spirits.</i> Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13- :">Revelation 14:13- :</span>, wherein Paul presciently warned the <i>Ephesian</i>
	elders of the coming false teachers, as also in writing to Timothy at
	Ephesus. TERTULLIAN [<i>On
	Baptism,</i> 17], and JEROME
	[<i>On Illustrious Men,</i> in Lucca 7], record of John, that when a
	writing, professing to be a canonical history of the acts of Paul,
	had been composed by a presbyter of Ephesus, John convicted the
	author and condemned the work. So on one occasion he would not remain
	under the same roof with Cerinthus the heretic.

<p><b>say they are
	apostles</b>—probably Judaizers. IGNATIUS
	[<i>Epistle to the Ephesians</i>, 6], says subsequently, "Onesimus
	praises exceedingly your good discipline that no heresy dwells among
	you"; and [<i>Epistle to the Ephesians,</i> 9], "Ye did not
	permit those having evil doctrine to sow their seed among you, but
	closed your ears."</p>
