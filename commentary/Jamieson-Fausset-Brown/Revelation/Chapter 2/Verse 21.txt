<p><b>of her fornication . . . she

	<i>willeth</i> not <i>to repent of</i> (literally, 'out of,' that is,
	so as to come <i>out</i> of) <i>her fornication.</i>" Here there
	is a transition from <i>literal to spiritual</i> fornication, as
	appears from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:22">Revelation 2:22</span>. The idea
	arose from Jehovah's covenant relation to the Old Testament Church
	being regarded as a marriage, any transgression against which was,
	therefore, <i>harlotry, fornication,</i> or <i>adultery.</i></p>
