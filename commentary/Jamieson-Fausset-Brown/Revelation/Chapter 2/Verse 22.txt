<p><b>22. Behold</b>—calling attention
	to her awful doom to come. 
	</p>
<p><b>I will</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	present, "I cast her." 
	</p>
<p><b>a bed</b>—The place of her
	sin shall be the place of her punishment. The bed of her sin shall be
	her bed of sickness and anguish. Perhaps a pestilence was about to be
	sent. Or the bed of the grave, and of the hell beyond, where the worm
	dieth not. 
	</p>
<p><b>them that commit adultery
	with her</b>—spiritually; including both the eating of <i>idol-meats</i>
	and <i>fornication.</i> "With her," in the <i>Greek,</i>
	implies <i>participation with</i> her in her adulteries, namely, by
	<i>suffering her</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:20">Revelation 2:20</span>),
	or <i>letting</i> her <i>alone,</i> and so virtually encouraging her.
	Her punishment is distinct from theirs; she is to be cast into a <i>bed,</i>
	and her <i>children</i> to be <i>killed;</i> while those who make
	themselves partakers of her sin by tolerating her, are to be cast
	into <i>great tribulation.</i>
</p>
<p><b>except they repent</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	aorist, "repent" <i>at once;</i> shall have repented by the
	time limited in My purpose. 
	</p>
<p><b>their deeds</b>—Two of the
	oldest manuscripts and most ancient versions read "her."
	Thus, God's true servants, who by connivance, are incurring the guilt
	of <i>her deeds,</i> are distinguished from her. One oldest
	manuscript, ANDREAS, and
	CYPRIAN, support "their."</p>
