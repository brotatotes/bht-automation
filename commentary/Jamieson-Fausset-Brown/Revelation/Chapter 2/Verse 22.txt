22. Behold—calling attention
	to her awful doom to come. 
	I will—Greek
	present, "I cast her." 
	a bed—The place of her
	sin shall be the place of her punishment. The bed of her sin shall be
	her bed of sickness and anguish. Perhaps a pestilence was about to be
	sent. Or the bed of the grave, and of the hell beyond, where the worm
	dieth not. 
	them that commit adultery
	with her—spiritually; including both the eating of idol-meats
	and fornication. "With her," in the Greek,
	implies participation with her in her adulteries, namely, by
	suffering her (Revelation 2:20),
	or letting her alone, and so virtually encouraging her.
	Her punishment is distinct from theirs; she is to be cast into a bed,
	and her children to be killed; while those who make
	themselves partakers of her sin by tolerating her, are to be cast
	into great tribulation.
except they repent—Greek
	aorist, "repent" at once; shall have repented by the
	time limited in My purpose. 
	their deeds—Two of the
	oldest manuscripts and most ancient versions read "her."
	Thus, God's true servants, who by connivance, are incurring the guilt
	of her deeds, are distinguished from her. One oldest
	manuscript, ANDREAS, and
	CYPRIAN, support "their."
