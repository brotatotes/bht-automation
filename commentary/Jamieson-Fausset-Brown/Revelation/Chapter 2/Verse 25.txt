<p><b>25. that which ye have already</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:3">Judges 1:3</span>, end). 
	</p>
<p><b>hold fast</b>—do not let go
	from your grasp, however false teachers may wish to wrest it from
	you. 
	</p>
<p><b>till I come</b>—when your
	conflict with evil will be at an end. The <i>Greek</i> implies
	<i>uncertainty</i> as to when He shall come.</p>
