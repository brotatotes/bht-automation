<p><b>26. And</b>—implying the close
	connection of the promise to the conqueror that follows, with the
	preceding exhortation, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:25">Revelation 2:25</span>.

<p><b>and keepeth</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"and he that keepeth." Compare the same word in the passage
	already alluded to by the Lord, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:28">Acts 15:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29">Acts 15:29</span>, end.

<p><b>my works</b>—in contrast to
	"her (<i>English Version,</i> 'their') works" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29- :">Acts 15:29- :</span>). The works which I command and which are the fruit of My
	Spirit.

<p><b>unto the end</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29- :">Acts 15:29- :</span>). The image is perhaps from the race, wherein it is not
	enough to enter the lists, but the runner must persevere <i>to the
	end.</i>

<p><b>give power</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"authority." 
	</p>
<p><b>over the nations</b>—at
	Christ's coming the saints shall possess the kingdom "under the
	whole heaven"; therefore over this earth; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:29- :">Acts 15:29- :</span>, "have thou <i>authority</i> [the same <i>word</i> as
	here] over ten cities."</p>
