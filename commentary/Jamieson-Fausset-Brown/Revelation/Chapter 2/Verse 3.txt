<p><b>3. borne . . . patience</b>—The
	oldest manuscripts transpose these words. Then translate as <i>Greek,</i>
	"persevering endurance . . . borne." "Thou hast borne"
	My reproach, but "thou canst not bear the evil" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). A beautiful antithesis. 
	</p>
<p><b>and . . . hast laboured, and
	hast not fainted</b>—The two oldest manuscripts and oldest versions
	read, "and . . . hast not labored," omitting "and hast
	fainted." The difficulty which transcribers by <i>English
	Version</i> reading tried to obviate, was the seeming contradiction,
	"I know thy <i>labor</i> . . . and thou hast <i>not labored.</i>"
	But what is meant is, "Thou hast not been <i>wearied out</i>
	with labor."</p>
