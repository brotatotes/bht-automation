3. borne . . . patience—The
	oldest manuscripts transpose these words. Then translate as Greek,
	"persevering endurance . . . borne." "Thou hast borne"
	My reproach, but "thou canst not bear the evil" ( :-). A beautiful antithesis. 
	and . . . hast laboured, and
	hast not fainted—The two oldest manuscripts and oldest versions
	read, "and . . . hast not labored," omitting "and hast
	fainted." The difficulty which transcribers by English
	Version reading tried to obviate, was the seeming contradiction,
	"I know thy labor . . . and thou hast not labored."
	But what is meant is, "Thou hast not been wearied out
	with labor."
