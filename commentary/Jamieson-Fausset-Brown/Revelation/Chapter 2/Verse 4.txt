	"I have against thee (this) <i>that,</i>" c. It is not a
	mere somewhat" it is everything. How characteristic of our
	gracious Lord, that He puts foremost all He can find to approve, and
	only after this notes the shortcomings!

<p><b>left thy first love</b>—to
	Christ. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+5:12">1 Timothy 5:12</span>, "cast

<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:15">Ephesians 1:15</span>. This epistle was
	written under Domitian, when thirty years had elapsed since Paul had
	written his Epistle to them. Their warmth of love had given place to
	a lifeless orthodoxy. Compare Paul's view of faith so called without
	love, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:2">1 Corinthians 13:2</span>.</p>
