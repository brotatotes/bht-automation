<p><b>do the first works</b>—the

	"feel thy first feelings," but do works flowing from the
	same principle as formerly, "faith which worketh by love."

<p><b>remove thy candlestick out of
	his place</b>—I will take away the Church from Ephesus and remove
	it elsewhere. "It is removal of the candlestick, not extinction
	of the candle, which is threatened here; judgment for some, but that
	very judgment the occasion of mercy for others. So it has been. The
	seat of the Church has been changed, but the Church itself survives.
	What the East has lost, the West has gained. One who lately visited
	Ephesus found only three Christians there, and these so ignorant as
	scarcely to have heard the names of St. Paul or St. John"
