<p><b>7. He that hath an ear</b>—This
	clause precedes the promise in the first three addresses, succeeds it
	in the last four. Thus the promises are enclosed on both sides with
	the precept urging the deepest attention as to the most momentous
	truths. Every man "hath an ear" naturally, but he alone
	will be able to hear spiritually to whom God has given "the
	hearing ear"; whose "ear God hath wakened" and
	"opened." Compare "Faith, the ears of the soul"
	[CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA].
	</p>
<p><b>the Spirit saith</b>—What
	<i>Christ</i> saith, <i>the Spirit</i> saith; so one are the Second
	and Third Persons. 
	</p>
<p><b>unto the churches</b>—not
	merely to the particular, but to the universal Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>overcometh</b>—In John's
	Gospel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:33">John 16:33</span>) and First
	Epistle (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:13">1 John 2:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+2:14">1 John 2:14</span>;

	an object follows, namely, "the world," "the wicked
	one." Here, where the final issue is spoken of, <i>the conqueror</i>
	is named absolutely. Paul uses a similar image (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:24">1 Corinthians 9:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+9:25">1 Corinthians 9:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:5">2 Timothy 2:5</span>;
	but not the same as John's phrase, except <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+2:5- :">2 Timothy 2:5- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>will I give</b>—as the
	Judge. The tree of life in Paradise, lost by the fall, is restored by
	the Redeemer. Allusions to it occur in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:18">Proverbs 3:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+11:30">Proverbs 11:30</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+13:12">Proverbs 13:12</span>;

	addresses are linked to the body of Revelation. Thus, <i>the tree of
	life</i> here, with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>;
	deliverance from <i>the second death</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1- :">Revelation 22:1- :</span>), with <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:14">Revelation 20:14</span>;

<p><b>give . . . tree of life</b>—The

	They who refrain from Nicolaitane indulgences (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:10- :">Revelation 21:10- :</span>) and idol-meats (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:14">Revelation 2:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:15">Revelation 2:15</span>), shall eat of meat
	infinitely superior, namely, the fruit of the tree of life, and the
	hidden manna (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:17">Revelation 2:17</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>in the midst of the
	paradise</b>—The oldest manuscripts omit "the midst of."
	In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:9">Genesis 2:9</span> these words are
	appropriate, for there were <i>other</i> trees in the garden, but not
	<i>in the midst of it.</i> Here <i>the tree of life</i> is simply <i>in
	the paradise,</i> for no other tree is mentioned in it; in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:9- :">Genesis 2:9- :</span> the tree of life is "<i>in the midst</i> of the street
	of Jerusalem"; from this the clause was inserted here. <i>Paradise</i>
	(a Persian, or else Semitic word), originally used of any garden of
	delight; then specially of Eden; then the temporary abode of separate
	souls in bliss; then "the Paradise <i>of God,</i>" the
	third heaven, the immediate presence of God. 
	</p>
<p><b>of God</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+2:9- :">Genesis 2:9- :</span>). One oldest manuscript, with <i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> and
	<i>Coptic,</i> and CYPRIAN,
	read, "MY God,"
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>. So Christ calls
	God, "<i>My</i> God and your God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12- :">Revelation 3:12- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17">Ephesians 1:17</span>).
	God is <i>our</i> God, in virtue of being peculiarly <i>Christ's</i>
	God. The main bliss of Paradise is that it is the Paradise <i>of God;</i>
	God Himself dwelling there (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:17- :">Ephesians 1:17- :</span>).</p>
