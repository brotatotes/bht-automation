<p><b>8. Smyrna</b>—in Ionia, a little
	to the north of Ephesus. POLYCARP,
	martyred in A.D. 168,
	eighty-six years after his conversion, was bishop, and probably "the
	angel of the Church in Smyrna" meant here. The allusions to
	persecutions and faithfulness unto death accord with this view.
	IGNATIUS [<i>The Martyrdom
	of Ignatius</i> 3], on his way to martyrdom in Rome, wrote to
	POLYCARP, then (A.D.
	108) bishop of Smyrna; if his bishopric commenced ten or twelve years
	earlier, the dates will harmonize. TERTULLIAN
	[<i>The Prescription against Heretics,</i> 32], and IRENÆUS,
	who had talked with POLYCARP
	in youth, tell us POLYCARP
	was consecrated bishop of Smyrna by St. John.
