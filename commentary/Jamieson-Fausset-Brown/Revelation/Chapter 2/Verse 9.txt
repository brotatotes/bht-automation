<p><b>say they are Jews, and are

	true circumcision." The Jews blaspheme Christ as "the
	hanged one." As elsewhere, so at Smyrna they bitterly opposed
	Christianity; and at POLYCARP'S
	martyrdom they joined the heathens in clamoring for his being cast to
	the lions; and when there was an obstacle to this, for his being
	burnt alive; and with their own hands they carried logs for the pile.

<p><b>synagogue of Satan</b>—Only
	once is the term "synagogue" in the New Testament used of
	the Christian assembly, and that by the apostle who longest
	maintained the union of the Church and Jewish Synagogue. As the Jews
	more and more opposed Christianity, and it more and more rooted
	itself in the Gentile world, the term "synagogue" was left
	altogether to the former, and Christians appropriated exclusively the
	honorable term "Church"; contrast an earlier time when the
	Jewish theocracy is called "the Church in the wilderness."
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+16:3">Numbers 16:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:4">Numbers 20:4</span>,
	"congregation <i>of the Lord.</i>" Even in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:4- :">Numbers 20:4- :</span> it is "<i>your</i> (not <i>the Lord's</i>) assembly."
	The <i>Jews,</i> who might have been "the Church of God,"
	had now, by their opposition and unbelief, become the synagogue of
	Satan. So "the throne of Satan" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:4- :">Numbers 20:4- :</span>) represents the <i>heathens'</i> opposition to Christianity;
	"the depths of Satan" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="nu+20:4- :">Numbers 20:4- :</span>), the opposition of <i>heretics.</i></p>
