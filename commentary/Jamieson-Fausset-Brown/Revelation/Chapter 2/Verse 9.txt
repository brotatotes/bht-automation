9. thy works, and—omitted in
	two oldest manuscripts, Vulgate, and Coptic. Supported

	tribulation—owing to
	persecution. 
	poverty—owing to "the
	spoiling of their goods." 
	but thou art rich—in
	grace. Contrast Laodicea, rich in the world's eyes and her
	own, poor before God. "There are both poor rich-men, and
	rich poor-men in God's sight" [TRENCH].
	blasphemy of them—blasphemous
	calumny of thee on the part of (or arising from) them. 
	say they are Jews, and are
	not—Jews by national descent, but not spiritually of "the
	true circumcision." The Jews blaspheme Christ as "the
	hanged one." As elsewhere, so at Smyrna they bitterly opposed
	Christianity; and at POLYCARP'S
	martyrdom they joined the heathens in clamoring for his being cast to
	the lions; and when there was an obstacle to this, for his being
	burnt alive; and with their own hands they carried logs for the pile.
	synagogue of Satan—Only
	once is the term "synagogue" in the New Testament used of
	the Christian assembly, and that by the apostle who longest
	maintained the union of the Church and Jewish Synagogue. As the Jews
	more and more opposed Christianity, and it more and more rooted
	itself in the Gentile world, the term "synagogue" was left
	altogether to the former, and Christians appropriated exclusively the
	honorable term "Church"; contrast an earlier time when the
	Jewish theocracy is called "the Church in the wilderness."
	Compare Numbers 16:3; Numbers 20:4,
	"congregation of the Lord." Even in Numbers 20:4- : it is "your (not the Lord's) assembly."
	The Jews, who might have been "the Church of God,"
	had now, by their opposition and unbelief, become the synagogue of
	Satan. So "the throne of Satan" (Numbers 20:4- :) represents the heathens' opposition to Christianity;
	"the depths of Satan" (Numbers 20:4- :), the opposition of heretics.
