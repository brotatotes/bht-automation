<p><b>1.</b> The destruction of his
	representatives, the beast and the false prophet, to whom he had
	given his <i>power, throne,</i> and <i>authority,</i> is followed by
	the binding of Satan himself for a thousand years. 
	</p>
<p><b>the key of the bottomless
	pit</b>â€”now transferred from Satan's hands, who had heretofore been
	permitted by God to use it in letting loose plagues on the earth; he
	is now to be made to feel himself the torment which he had inflicted
	on men, but his full torment is not until he is cast into "the
	lake of fire" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:10">Revelation 20:10</span>).</p>
