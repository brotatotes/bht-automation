1. The destruction of his
	representatives, the beast and the false prophet, to whom he had
	given his power, throne, and authority, is followed by
	the binding of Satan himself for a thousand years. 
	the key of the bottomless
	pitâ€”now transferred from Satan's hands, who had heretofore been
	permitted by God to use it in letting loose plagues on the earth; he
	is now to be made to feel himself the torment which he had inflicted
	on men, but his full torment is not until he is cast into "the
	lake of fire" (Revelation 20:10).
