<p><b>day and night</b>—figurative
	for <i>without intermission</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:20- :">Revelation 19:20- :</span>), such as now is caused by night interposing between day and
	day. The same phrase is used of the <i>external</i> state of the
	blessed (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>). As the bliss
	of these is eternal, so the woe of Satan and the lost must be. As the
	beast and the false prophet led the former conspiracy against Christ
	and His people, so Satan in person heads the last conspiracy. Satan
	shall not be permitted to enter this Paradise regained, to show the
	perfect security of believers, unlike the first Adam whom Satan
	succeeded in robbing of Paradise; and shall, like Pharaoh at the Rod
	Sea, receive in this last attempt his final doom.
