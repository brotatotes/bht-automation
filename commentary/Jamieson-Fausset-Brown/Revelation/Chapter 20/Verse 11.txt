<p><b>him that sat on it</b>—the
	Father [ALFORD]. Rather,
	the Son, to whom "the Father hath committed all judgment."
	God in Christ, that is, the Father represented by the Son, is He
	before whose judgment-seat we must all stand. The Son's mediatorial
	reign is with a view to prepare the kingdom for the Father's
	acceptance. When He has done that, He shall give it up to the Father,
	"that God may be all in all," coming into direct communion
	with His creatures, without intervention of a Mediator, for the first
	time since the fall. Heretofore Christ's <i>Prophetical</i> mediation
	had been prominent in His earthly ministry, His Priestly mediation is
	prominent now in heaven between His first and second advents, and His
	Kingly shall be so during the millennium and at the general judgment.

	judgment. This is followed by the new heaven and earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:4- :">Revelation 20:4- :</span>).</p>
