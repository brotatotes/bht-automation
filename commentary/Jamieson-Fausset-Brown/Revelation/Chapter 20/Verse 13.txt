<p><b>13. death and hell</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>Hades.</i>" The essential identity of the dying and
	risen body is hereby shown; for the <i>sea</i> and <i>grave</i> give
	up <i>their dead.</i> The body that sinned or served God shall, in
	righteous retribution, be the body also that shall suffer or be
	rewarded. The "sea" may have a symbolical [CLUVER
	from AUGUSTINE], besides
	the literal meaning, as, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:8">Revelation 8:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:12">Revelation 12:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:17">Revelation 18:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+18:19">Revelation 18:19</span>;
	so "death" and "hell" are personifications
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:1">Revelation 21:1</span>). But the
	literal sense need hardly be departed from: all the different regions
	wherein the bodies and souls of men had been, gave them up.</p>
