13. death and hellâ€”Greek,
	"Hades." The essential identity of the dying and
	risen body is hereby shown; for the sea and grave give
	up their dead. The body that sinned or served God shall, in
	righteous retribution, be the body also that shall suffer or be
	rewarded. The "sea" may have a symbolical [CLUVER
	from AUGUSTINE], besides
	the literal meaning, as, in Revelation 8:8;
	Revelation 12:12; Revelation 13:1;
	Revelation 18:17; Revelation 18:19;
	so "death" and "hell" are personifications
	(compare Revelation 21:1). But the
	literal sense need hardly be departed from: all the different regions
	wherein the bodies and souls of men had been, gave them up.
