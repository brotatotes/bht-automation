14. Death and Hades, as
	personified representatives of the enemies of Christ' and His Church,
	are said to be cast into the lake of fire to express the truth that
	Christ and His people shall never more die, or be in the state of
	disembodied spirits. 
	This is the second deathâ€”"the
	lake of fire" is added in A, B, and ANDREAS.
	English Version, which omits the clause, rests on inferior
	manuscripts. In hell the ancient form of death, which was one of the
	enemies destroyed by Christ, shall not continue, but a death of a far
	different kind reigns there, "everlasting destruction
	from the presence of the Lord": an abiding testimony of the
	victory of Christ.
