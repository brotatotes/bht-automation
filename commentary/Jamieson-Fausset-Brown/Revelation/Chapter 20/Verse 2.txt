<p><b>thousand years</b>—As <i>seven</i>
	mystically implies universality, so a <i>thousand</i> implies
	<i>perfection,</i> whether in good or evil [AQUINAS
	on ch. 11]. <i>Thousand</i> symbolizes that the world is perfectly
	leavened and pervaded by the divine; since <i>thousand</i> is <i>ten,</i>
	the number of the world, raised to the <i>third</i> power, <i>three</i>
	being the number of God [AUBERLEN].
	It may denote <i>literally</i> also a <i>thousand years.</i></p>
