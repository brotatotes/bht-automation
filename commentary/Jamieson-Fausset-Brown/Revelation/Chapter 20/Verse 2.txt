2. that old—ancient serpent
	(Revelation 12:9). 
	thousand years—As seven
	mystically implies universality, so a thousand implies
	perfection, whether in good or evil [AQUINAS
	on ch. 11]. Thousand symbolizes that the world is perfectly
	leavened and pervaded by the divine; since thousand is ten,
	the number of the world, raised to the third power, three
	being the number of God [AUBERLEN].
	It may denote literally also a thousand years.
