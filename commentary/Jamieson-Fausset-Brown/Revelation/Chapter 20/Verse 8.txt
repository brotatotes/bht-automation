	whereby the two, namely, the prince and the people, are marked as
	having the closest connection. B reads the second article before
	Magog wrongly. HILLER
	[Onomasticon] explains both words as signifying "lofty,"
	"elevated." For "quarters" the Greek is
	"corners." 
	to battle—Greek,
	"to the war," in A and B. But ANDREAS
	omits "the."
