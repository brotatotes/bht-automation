<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. THE NEW
	HEAVEN AND EARTH:
	NEW JERUSALEM
	OUT OF HEAVEN.
	 
	</p>
<p>The remaining two chapters
	describe the eternal and consummated kingdom of God and the saints on
	the new earth. As the world of nations is to be pervaded by divine
	influence in the millennium, so the world of nature shall be, not
	annihilated, but transfigured universally in the eternal state which
	follows it. The earth was cursed for man's sake; but is redeemed by
	the second Adam. <i>Now</i> is the Church; in the millennium shall be
	the kingdom; and after that shall be the new world wherein God shall
	be all in all. The "day of the Lord" and the conflagration
	of the earth are in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:11">2 Peter 3:11</span> spoken of as if
	connected together, from which many argue against a millennial
	interval between His coming and the general conflagration of the old
	earth, preparatory to the new; but "day" is used often of a
	whole period comprising events intimately connected together, as are
	the Lord's second advent, the millennium, and the general
	conflagration and judgment. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:11- :">2 Peter 3:11- :</span> as to the wide use of "day." Man's <i>soul</i> is
	redeemed by regeneration through the Holy Spirit now; man's <i>body</i>
	shall be redeemed at the resurrection; man's <i>dwelling-place,</i>
	His inheritance, the earth, shall be redeemed perfectly at the
	creation of the new heaven and earth, which shall exceed in glory the
	first Paradise, as much as the second Adam exceeds in glory the first
	Adam before the fall, and as man regenerated in body and soul shall
	exceed man as he was at creation.</p>
