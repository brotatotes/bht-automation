<p><b>passed away</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	in A and B is "were departed" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>apeelthon,</i>"

<p><b>no more sea</b>—The sea is
	the type of perpetual unrest. Hence our Lord rebukes it as an unruly
	hostile troubler of His people. It symbolized the political tumults
	out of which "the beast" arose, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. As the physical corresponds to the spiritual and moral
	world, so the absence of <i>sea,</i> after the metamorphosis of the
	earth by <i>fire,</i> answers to the unruffled state of solid peace
	which shall then prevail. The <i>sea,</i> though severing lands from
	one another, is now, by God's eliciting of good from evil, made the
	medium of communication between countries through navigation. Then
	man shall possess inherent powers which shall make the sea no longer
	necessary, but an element which would detract from a perfect state. A
	"river" and "water" are spoken of in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:2">Revelation 22:2</span>, probably literal (that
	is, with such changes of the natural properties of water, as
	correspond analogically to man's own transfigured body), as well as
	symbolical. The sea was once the element of the world's destruction,
	and is still the source of death to thousands, whence after the
	millennium, at the general judgment, it is specially said, "The
	<i>sea</i> gave up the dead . . . in it." Then it shall cease to
	destroy, or disturb, being removed altogether on account of its past
	destructions.</p>
