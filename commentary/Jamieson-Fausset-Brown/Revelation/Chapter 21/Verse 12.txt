<p><b>12. And</b>—A and B omit. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, has a similar description, which implies that the
	millennial Jerusalem shall have its exact antitype in the heavenly
	Jerusalem which shall descend on the finally regenerated earth.

<p><b>wall great and high</b>—setting
	forth the security of the Church. Also, the exclusion of the ungodly.
	</p>
<p><b>twelve angels</b>—guards of
	the twelve gates: an additional emblem of perfect security, while the
	gates being never shut (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:25">Revelation 21:25</span>)
	imply perfect liberty and peace. Also, angels shall be the brethren
	of the heavenly citizens. 
	</p>
<p><b>names of . . . twelve
	tribes</b>—The inscription of the names on the gates implies that
	none but the spiritual Israel, God's elect, shall enter the heavenly
	city. As the millennium wherein <i>literal</i> Israel <i>in the flesh</i>
	shall be the mother Church, is the antitype to the Old Testament
	<i>earthly</i> theocracy in the Holy Land, so the <i>heavenly</i> new
	<i>Jerusalem</i> is the consummation antitypical to the <i>spiritual</i>
	Israel, the elect Church of Jews and Gentiles being now gathered out:
	as the spiritual Israel now is an advance upon the previous literal
	and carnal Israel, so the heavenly Jerusalem shall be much in advance
	of the millennial Jerusalem.</p>
