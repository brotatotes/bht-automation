<p><b>14. twelve foundations</b>—Joshua,
	the type of Jesus, chose twelve men out of the people, to carry
	twelve stones over the Jordan with them, as Jesus chose twelve
	apostles to be the twelve foundations of the heavenly city, of which
	He is Himself the Chief corner-stone. Peter is not the only apostolic
	rock on whose preaching Christ builds His Church. Christ Himself is
	the true foundation: the twelve are foundations only in regard to
	their apostolic testimony concerning Him. Though Paul was an apostle
	besides the twelve, yet the mystical number is retained, twelve
	representing the Church, namely thirty the divine number, multiplied
	by four, the world number. 
	</p>
<p><b>in them the names,</b> &amp;c.—As
	architects often have their names inscribed on their great works, so
	the names of the apostles shall be held in everlasting remembrance.
	<i>Vulgate</i> reads, "<i>in</i> them." But A, B, <i>Syriac,
	Coptic,</i> and ANDREAS
	read, "<i>upon</i> them." These authorities also insert
	"twelve" before "names."</p>
