<p><b>15. had a golden reed</b>â€”so
	<i>Coptic.</i> But A, B, <i>Vulgate,</i> and <i>Syriac</i> read, "had
	(as) <i>a measure,</i> a golden reed." In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> the non-measuring of the outer courts of the temple implied
	its being given up to secular and heathen desecration. So here, on
	the contrary, the city being measured implies the entire consecration
	of every part, all things being brought up to the most exact standard
	of God's holy requirements, and also God's accurate guardianship
	henceforth of even the most minute parts of His holy city from all
	evil.</p>
