<p><b>16. twelve thousand
	furlongs</b>â€”literally, "<i>to twelve thousand stadii</i>":
	one thousand furlongs being the space between the several twelve
	gates. BENGEL makes the
	length of <i>each side</i> of the city to be twelve thousand stadii.
	The stupendous height, length, and breadth being exactly alike, imply
	its faultless symmetry, transcending in glory all our most glowing
	conceptions.</p>
