<p><b>2. And I John</b>—"John"
	is omitted in A, B, <i>Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic,</i> and ANDREAS;
	also the "I" in the <i>Greek</i> of these authorities is
	not emphatic. The insertion of "I John" in the <i>Greek</i>
	would somewhat interfere with the close connection which subsists
	between "the new heaven and earth," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, and the "new Jerusalem" in this verse. 
	</p>
<p><b>Jerusalem . . . out of
	heaven</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:12">Revelation 3:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</span>,
	"Jerusalem which is above"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+11:10">Hebrews 11:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:14">Hebrews 13:14</span>).
	The <i>descent</i> of the new Jerusalem <i>out of heaven</i> is
	plainly distinct from the <i>earthly</i> Jerusalem in which Israel in
	the flesh shall dwell during the millennium, and follows on the
	creation of the new heaven and earth. John in his Gospel always
	writes [<i>Greek</i>] <i>Hierosoluma</i> of the old city; in the
	Apocalypse always <i>Hierousaleem</i> of the heavenly city (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:14- :">Hebrews 13:14- :</span>). <i>Hierousaleem</i> is a <i>Hebrew</i> name, the original
	and holy appellation. <i>Hierosoluma</i> is the common <i>Greek</i>
	term, used in a political sense. Paul observes the same distinction
	when refuting Judaism (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+4:26">Galatians 4:26</span>;
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:17">Galatians 1:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:18">Galatians 1:18</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:1">Galatians 2:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22">Hebrews 12:22</span>),
	though not so in the Epistles to Romans and Corinthians [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>bride</b>—made up of the
	blessed citizens of "the holy city." There is no longer
	merely a Paradise as in Eden (though there is that also, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:22- :">Hebrews 12:22- :</span>), no longer a mere garden, but now <i>the city of</i> God on
	earth, costlier, statelier, and more glorious, but at the same time
	the result of labor and pains such as had not to be expended by man
	in dressing the primitive garden of Eden. "The lively stones"
	were severally in time laboriously chiselled into shape, after the
	pattern of "the Chief corner-stone," to prepare them for
	the place which they shall everlastingly fill in the heavenly
	Jerusalem.</p>
