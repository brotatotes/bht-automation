<p><b>22. no temple . . . God . . . the
	temple</b>â€”As God now dwells in the spiritual Church, His "temple"
	(<i>Greek,</i> "<i>naos,</i>" "shrine"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:17">1 Corinthians 3:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+6:19">1 Corinthians 6:19</span>), so the Church when
	perfected shall dwell in Him as her "temple" (<i>naos:</i>
	the same <i>Greek</i>). As the Church was "His sanctuary,"
	so He is to be their sanctuary. Means of grace shall cease when the
	end of grace is come. Church ordinances shall give place to the God
	of ordinances. Uninterrupted, immediate, direct, communion with Him
	and the Lamb (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:23">John 4:23</span>),
	shall supersede intervening ordinances.</p>
