<p><b>26.</b> All that was truly glorious
	and excellent in the earth and its converted <i>nations</i> shall be
	gathered into it; and while all shall form <i>one</i> Bride, there
	shall be various orders among the redeemed, analogous to the
	divisions of <i>nations</i> on earth constituting the one great human
	family, and to the various orders of angels.</p>
