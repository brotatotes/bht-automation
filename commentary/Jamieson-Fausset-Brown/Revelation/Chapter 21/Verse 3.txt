<p><b>3. out of heaven</b>—so ANDREAS.
	But A and <i>Vulgate</i> read, "out of the throne." 
	</p>
<p><b>the tabernacle</b>—alluding
	to the tabernacle of God in the wilderness (wherein many signs of His
	presence were given): of which this is the antitype, having
	previously been in heaven: <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony
	in heaven"; also <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:6">Revelation 13:6</span>.
	Compare the contrast in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:23">Hebrews 9:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span>, between "the
	patterns" and "the heavenly things themselves,"
	between "the figures" and "the true." The earnest
	of the true and heavenly tabernacle was afforded in the Jerusalem
	temple described in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14- :">Hebrews 9:14- :</span>, as about to be, namely, during the millennium.

<p><b>dwell with them</b>—literally,
	"<i>tabernacle</i> with them"; the same <i>Greek</i> word
	as is used of the divine Son "<i>tabernacling</i> among us."
	Then He was in the weakness of the <i>flesh:</i> but at the new
	creation of heaven and earth He shall tabernacle among us in the
	glory of His manifested Godhead (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+9:14- :">Hebrews 9:14- :</span>).

<p><b>they</b>—in <i>Greek</i>
	emphatic, "<i>they</i>" (in particular). 
	</p>
<p><b>his people</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"His <i>peoples</i>": "the nations of the saved"
	being all peculiarly His, as Israel was designed to be. So A reads.
	But B, <i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> and <i>Coptic</i> read, "His
	<i>people</i>": singular.

<p><b>God himself . . . with
