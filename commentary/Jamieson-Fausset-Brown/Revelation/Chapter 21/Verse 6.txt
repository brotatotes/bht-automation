<p><b>6. It is done</b>—the same <i>Greek</i>
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17">Revelation 16:17</span>. "It is
	come to pass." So <i>Vulgate</i> reads with <i>English Version.</i>
	But A reads, "They ('<i>these words,</i>' <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17- :">Revelation 16:17- :</span>) are come to pass." All is as sure as if it actually
	had been fulfilled for it rests on the word of the unchanging God.
	When the consummation shall be, God shall rejoice over the work of
	His own hands, as at the completion of the first creation God <i>saw
	everything that He had made, and behold it was very good</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17- :">Revelation 16:17- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>Alpha . . . Omega</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	in A and B, "<i>the</i> Alpha . . . <i>the</i> Omega" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:17- :">Revelation 16:17- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>give unto . . . athirst . . .
	water of life</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+12:3">Isaiah 12:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+55:1">Isaiah 55:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:13">John 4:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+4:14">John 4:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:37">John 7:37</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:38">John 7:38</span>).
	This is added lest any should despair of attaining to this exceeding
	weight of glory. In our present state we may drink of the stream,
	then we shall drink at the <i>Fountain.</i>
</p>
<p><b>freely</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"gratuitously": the same Greek as is translated, "(They
	hated Me) without a cause," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+7:38- :">John 7:38- :</span>. As <i>gratuitous</i> as was man's hatred of God, so
	<i>gratuitous</i> is God's love to man: there was every cause in
	Christ why man should love Him, yet man hated Him; there was every
	cause in man why (humanly speaking) God should have hated man, yet
	God loved man: the very reverse of what might be expected took place
	in both cases. Even in heaven our drinking at the Fountain shall be
	God's <i>gratuitous</i> gift.</p>
