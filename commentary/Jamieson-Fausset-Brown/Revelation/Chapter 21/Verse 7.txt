<p><b>7. He that overcometh</b>—another
	aspect of the believer's life: a conflict with sin, Satan, and the
	world is needed. <i>Thirsting</i> for salvation is the first
	beginning of, and continues for ever (in the sense of an appetite and
	relish for divine joys) a characteristic of the believer. In a
	different sense, the believer "shall never thirst."

<p><b>inherit all things</b>—A,
	B, <i>Vulgate,</i> and CYPRIAN
	read, "<i>these</i> things," namely, the blessings
	described in this whole passage. With "all things," compare
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+3:21-23">1 Corinthians 3:21-23</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>I will be his God</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"I will be to him a God," that is, all that is implied of
	blessing in the name "God." 
	</p>
<p><b>he shall be my son</b>—"He"
	is emphatic: <i>He</i> in particular and in a peculiar sense, above
	others: <i>Greek,</i> "shall be <i>to me</i> a son," in
	fullest realization of the promise made in type to Solomon, son of
	David, and antitypically to the divine Son of David.</p>
