<p><b>water of life</b>—infinitely
	superior to the typical waters in the first Paradise (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); and even superior to those figurative ones in the
	millennial Jerusalem (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+47:1">Ezekiel 47:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+47:12">Ezekiel 47:12</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:8">Zechariah 14:8</span>),
	as the matured fruit is superior to the flower. The millennial waters
	represent full Gospel grace; these waters of new Jerusalem represent
	Gospel glory perfected. Their continuous flow from God, the Fountain
	of life, symbolizes the uninterrupted continuance of life derived by
	the saints, ever fresh, from Him: life in fulness of joy, as well as
	perpetual vitality. Like pure crystal, it is free from every taint:
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>, "before the
	throne a sea of glass, like crystal."
