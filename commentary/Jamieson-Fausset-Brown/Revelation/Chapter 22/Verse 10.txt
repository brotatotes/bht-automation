<p><b>10. Seal not</b>â€”But in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:4">Daniel 12:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:9">Daniel 12:9</span> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:9- :">Daniel 12:9- :</span>), the command is, "Seal the book," for the vision
	shall be "for many days." The fulfilment of Daniel's
	prophecy was distant, that of John's prophecy is near. The New
	Testament is the time of the end and fulfilment. The Gentile Church,
	for which John wrote his Revelation, needs more to be impressed with
	the shortness of the period, as it is inclined, owing to its Gentile
	origin, to conform to the world and forget the coming of the Lord.
	The Revelation points, on the one hand, to Christ's coming as
	distant, for it shows the succession of the seven seals, trumpets,
	and vials; on the other hand, it proclaims, "Behold, I come
	quickly." So Christ marked many events as about to intervene
	before His coming, and yet He also says "Behold, I come
	quickly," because our right attitude is that of continual
	prayerful watching for His coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+25:6">Matthew 25:6</span>;
