11. unjust—"unrighteous";
	in relation to one's fellow men; opposed to "righteous," or
	"just" (as the Greek may be translated) below. More
	literally, "he that doeth unjustly, let him do
	unjustly still." 
	filthy—in relation to
	one's own soul as unclean before God; opposed to holy,"
	consecrated to God as pure. A omits the clause, "He which is
	filthy let him be filthy still." But B supports it. In the
	letter of the Vienne and Lyons Martyrs (in EUSEBIUS)
	in the second century, the reading is, "He that is lawless
	(Greek, 'anomos') let him be lawless; and he that is
	righteous let him be righteous (literally, 'be justified') still."
	No manuscript is so old. A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic,
	ANDREAS, and CYPRIAN
	read, "let him do righteousness" (1 John 2:29;
	1 John 3:7). The punishment of sin
	is sin, the reward of holiness is holiness. Eternal punishment is not
	so much an arbitrary law, as a result necessarily following in the
	very nature of things, as the fruit results from the bud. No worse
	punishment can God lay on ungodly men than to give them up to
	themselves. The solemn lesson derivable from this verse is, Be
	converted now in the short time left (1 John 3:7- :, end) before "I come" (Revelation 22:7;
	Revelation 22:12), or else you must
	remain unconverted for ever; sin in the eternal world will be left to
	its own natural consequences; holiness in germ will there develop
	itself into perfect holiness, which is happiness.
