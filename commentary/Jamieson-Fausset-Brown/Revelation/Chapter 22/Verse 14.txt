<p><b>14. do his commandments</b>—so B,
	<i>Syriac, Coptic,</i> and CYPRIAN.
	But A, <i>Aleph,</i> and <i>Vulgate</i> read, "(Blessed are they
	that) <i>wash their robes,</i>" namely, <i>in the blood of the
	Lamb</i> (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:14">Revelation 7:14</span>).
	This reading takes away the pretext for the notion of salvation by
	works. But even <i>English Version</i> reading is quite compatible
	with salvation by grace; for God's first and grand Gospel
	"commandment" is to believe on Jesus. Thus our "right"
	to (<i>Greek,</i> "privilege" or "lawful authority
	over") the tree of life is due not to our doings, but to what He
	has done for us. The <i>right,</i> or <i>privilege,</i> is founded,
	not on our merits, but on God's grace.
