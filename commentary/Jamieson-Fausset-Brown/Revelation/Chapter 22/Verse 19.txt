<p><b>19. book</b>—None of our
	manuscripts read this. A, B, <i>Aleph,</i> <i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i>
	and <i>Coptic</i> read, "(take away his part, that is, portion)
	from the <i>tree</i> of life," that is, shall deprive him of
	participation in the tree of life. 
	</p>
<p><b>and from the things</b>—so
	<i>Vulgate.</i> But A, B, <i>Aleph,</i> <i>Syriac, Coptic,</i> and
	ANDREAS omit "and";
	then "which are written in this book" will refer to "the
	holy city and the tree of life." As in the beginning of this
	book (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:3">Revelation 1:3</span>) a blessing was
	promised to the devout, obedient student of it, so now at its close a
	curse is denounced against those who add to, or take from, it.</p>
