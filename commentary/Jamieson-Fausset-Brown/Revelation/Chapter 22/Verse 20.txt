<p><b>20. Amen. Even so, come</b>â€”The
	Song of Solomon (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+8:14">Song of Solomon 8:14</span>)
	closes with the same yearning prayer for Christ's coming. A, B, and
	<i>Aleph</i> omit "Even so," <i>Greek,</i> "<i>nai</i>":
	then translate for <i>Amen,</i> "<i>So be it,</i> come, Lord
	Jesus"; joining the "Amen," or "So be it,"
	not with Christ's saying (for He calls Himself the "Amen"
	at the beginning of sentences, rather than puts it as a confirmation
	at the end), but with John's reply. Christ's "I come," and
	John's "Come," are almost coincident in time; so truly does
	the believer reflect the mind of his Lord.</p>
