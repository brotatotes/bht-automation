<p><b>8.</b> Both here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:9">Revelation 19:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>, the apostle's falling
	at the feet of the angel is preceded by a glorious promise to the
	Church, accompanied with the assurance, that "These are the true
	sayings of God," and that those are "blessed" who keep
	them. Rapturous emotion, gratitude, and adoration, at the prospect of
	the Church's future glory transport him out of himself, so as all but
	to fall into an unjustifiable act; contrast his opposite feeling at
	the prospect of the Church's deep fall [AUBERLEN],
	see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1">Revelation 22:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1- :">Revelation 22:1- :</span>.

<p><b>saw . . . and heard</b>â€”A,
	B, <i>Vulgate,</i> and <i>Syriac</i> transpose these verbs. Translate
	literally, "I John (was he) who heard and saw these things."
	It is observable that in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>,
	the language is, "I fell before his feet to worship him";
	but here, "I fell down to worship (God?) <i>before the feet</i>
	of the angel." It seems unlikely that John, when once reproved,
	would fall into the very same error again. BENGEL'S
	view, therefore, is probable; John had first intended to worship <i>the
	angel</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>), but now
	only <i>at his feet</i> intends to worship (God). The angel does not
	even permit this.</p>
