<p><b>9.</b> Literally, "See not";
	the abruptness of the phrase marking the angel's abhorrence of the
	thought of <i>his</i> being worshipped however indirectly. Contrast
	the fallen angel's temptation to Jesus, "Fall down and worship
	me" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+4:9">Matthew 4:9</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>for</b>—A, B, <i>Vulgate,
	Syriac, Coptic,</i> ANDREAS,
	and CYPRIAN omit "for";
	which accords with the abrupt earnestness of the angel's prohibition
	of an act derogatory to God. 
	</p>
<p><b>and of</b>—"and (the
	fellow servant) of thy brethren."</p>
