9. Literally, "See not";
	the abruptness of the phrase marking the angel's abhorrence of the
	thought of his being worshipped however indirectly. Contrast
	the fallen angel's temptation to Jesus, "Fall down and worship
	me" (Matthew 4:9). 
	for—A, B, Vulgate,
	Syriac, Coptic, ANDREAS,
	and CYPRIAN omit "for";
	which accords with the abrupt earnestness of the angel's prohibition
	of an act derogatory to God. 
	and of—"and (the
	fellow servant) of thy brethren."
