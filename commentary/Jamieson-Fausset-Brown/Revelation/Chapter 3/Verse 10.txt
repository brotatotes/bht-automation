<p><b>10. patience</b>—"endurance."
	"The word of My endurance" is <i>My Gospel word,</i> which
	teaches <i>patient endurance</i> in expectation of my coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). <i>My endurance</i> is the endurance which I require, and
	which I practice. Christ Himself now <i>endures, patiently</i>
	waiting until the usurper be cast out, and all "His enemies be
	made His footstool." So, too, His Church, for the joy before her
	of sharing His coming kingdom, <i>endures patiently.</i> Hence, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, follows, "Behold, I come quickly." 
	</p>
<p><b>I also</b>—The reward is in
	kind: "because thou didst keep," c. "I also (on My
	side) will keep thee," &amp;c. 
	</p>
<p><b>from</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "(so
	as to deliver thee) <i>out of,</i>" not to exempt <i>from</i>
	temptation. 
	</p>
<p><b>the hour of temptation</b>—the
	appointed <i>season</i> of affliction and temptation (so in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> the plagues are called "the temptations of Egypt"),
	literally, "<i>the</i> temptation": the sore temptation
	which is coming on: the time of great tribulation before Christ's
	second coming.

<p><b>to try them that dwell upon
	the earth</b>—those who are of earth, earthy (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). "Dwell" implies that their home is earth, not
	heaven. <i>All mankind, except the elect</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:8">Revelation 13:8</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:14">Revelation 13:14</span>). The temptation brings
	out the fidelity of those <i>kept</i> by Christ and hardens the
	unbelieving reprobates (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:20">Revelation 9:20</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:21">Revelation 9:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:11">Revelation 16:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:21">Revelation 16:21</span>). The particular
	persecutions which befell Philadelphia shortly after, were the
	earnest of the great last tribulation before Christ's coming, to
	which the Church's attention in all ages is directed.</p>
