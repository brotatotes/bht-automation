11. Behold—omitted by the
	three oldest manuscripts and most ancient versions. 
	I come quickly—the
	great incentive to persevering faithfulness, and the consolation
	under present trials. 
	that . . . which thou
	hast—"The word of my patience," or "endurance"
	(Revelation 3:10), which He had just
	commended them for keeping, and which involved with it the attaining
	of the kingdom; this they would lose if they yielded to the
	temptation of exchanging consistency and suffering for compromise and
	ease. 
	that no man take thy
	crown—which otherwise thou wouldst receive: that no tempter
	cause thee to lose it: not that the tempter would thus secure it for
	himself (Colossians 2:18).
