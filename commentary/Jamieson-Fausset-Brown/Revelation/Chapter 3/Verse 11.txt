<p><b>11. Behold</b>—omitted by the
	three oldest manuscripts and most ancient versions. 
	</p>
<p><b>I come quickly</b>—the
	great incentive to persevering faithfulness, and the consolation
	under present trials. 
	</p>
<p><b>that . . . which thou
	hast</b>—"The word of my patience," or "endurance"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10">Revelation 3:10</span>), which He had just
	commended them for keeping, and which involved with it the attaining
	of the kingdom; this they would lose if they yielded to the
	temptation of exchanging consistency and suffering for compromise and
	ease. 
	</p>
<p><b>that no man take thy
	crown</b>—which otherwise thou wouldst receive: that no tempter
	cause thee to lose it: not that the tempter would thus secure it for
	himself (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:18">Colossians 2:18</span>).</p>
