<p><b>15. neither cold</b>â€”The
	antithesis to "hot," literally, "boiling"
	("fervent," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:25">Acts 18:25</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:11">Romans 12:11</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+8:6">Song of Solomon 8:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:32">Luke 24:32</span>), requires that "cold"
	should here mean more than negatively cold; it is rather, positively
	<i>icy cold:</i> having never yet been warmed. The Laodiceans were in
	spiritual things <i>cold</i> comparatively, but not <i>cold</i> as
	the world outside, and as those who had never belonged to the Church.
	The lukewarm state, if it be the transitional stage to a warmer, is a
	desirable state (for a little religion, if real, is better than
	none); but most fatal when, as here, an abiding condition, for it is
	mistaken for a safe state (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+24:32- :">Luke 24:32- :</span>). This accounts for Christ's desiring that they were <i>cold</i>
	rather than <i>lukewarm.</i> For then there would not be the same
	"danger of mixed motive and disregarded principle"
	[ALFORD]. Also, there is
	more hope of the "cold," that is, those who are of the
	world, and not yet warmed by the Gospel call; for, when called, they
	may become <i>hot</i> and fervent Christians: such did the once-<i>cold</i>
	publicans, Zaccheus and Matthew, become. But the <i>lukewarm</i> has
	been brought within reach of the holy fire, without being heated by
	it into <i>fervor:</i> having religion enough to lull the conscience
	in false security, but not religion enough to save the soul: as
	Demas, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:10">2 Timothy 4:10</span>. Such were the
	<i>halters between two opinions</i> in Israel (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ti+4:10- :">2 Timothy 4:10- :</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2ki+17:41">2 Kings 17:41</span>;
