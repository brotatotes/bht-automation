<p><b>17.</b> Self-sufficiency is the
	fatal danger of a lukewarm state (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>thou sayest</b>—virtually
	and mentally, if not in so many words. 
	</p>
<p><b>increased with goods</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"have become enriched," implying self-praise in
	self-acquired riches. The Lord alludes to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The riches on which they prided themselves were spiritual
	riches; though, doubtless, their spiritual self-sufficiency ("I
	have need of nothing") was much fostered by their worldly
	wealth; as, on the other hand, <i>poverty of spirit</i> is fostered
	by <i>poverty</i> in respect to worldly riches. 
	</p>
<p><b>knowest not that thou</b>—in
	particular above all others. The "THOU"
	in the <i>Greek</i> is emphatic. 
	</p>
<p><b>art wretched</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"art <i>the</i> wretched one." 
	</p>
<p><b>miserable</b>—So one oldest
	manuscripts reads. But two oldest manuscripts prefix "the."
	Translate, "<i>the</i> pitiable"; "the one especially
	to be pitied." How different Christ's estimate of men, from
	their own estimate of themselves, "I have need of nothing!"
	</p>
<p><b>blind</b>—whereas Laodicea
	boasted of a deeper than common <i>insight</i> into divine things.
	They were not absolutely <i>blind,</i> else <i>eye-salve</i> would
	have been of no avail to them; but <i>short-sighted.</i></p>
