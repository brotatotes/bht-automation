<p><b>19.</b> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="job+5:17">Job 5:17</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:11">Proverbs 3:11</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+3:12">Proverbs 3:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:5">Hebrews 12:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6">Hebrews 12:6</span>.)
	So in the case of Manasseh (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6- :">Hebrews 12:6- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>As many</b>—All. "He
	scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. And shalt thou be an
	exception? If excepted from suffering the scourge, thou art excepted
	from the number of the sons" [AUGUSTINE].
	This is an encouragement to Laodicea not to despair, but to regard
	the rebuke as a token for good, if she profit by it. 
	</p>
<p><b>I love</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>philo,</i>" the love of gratuitous <i>affection,</i>
	independent of any grounds for esteem in the object loved. But in the
	case of Philadelphia (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:9">Revelation 3:9</span>),
	"I have loved thee" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>egapesa</i>")
	with the love of <i>esteem,</i> founded on the judgment. Compare the
	note in my <i>English Gnomon</i> of BENGEL,
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15-17">John 21:15-17</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>I rebuke</b>—The "I"
	in the <i>Greek</i> stands first in the sentence emphatically. I in
	My dealings, so altogether unlike man's, in the case of <i>all whom I
	love, rebuke.</i> The <i>Greek,</i> "<i>elencho,</i>" is
	the same verb as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+16:8">John 16:8</span>,
	"(the Holy Ghost) will <i>convince</i> (rebuke unto conviction)
	the world of sin." 
	</p>
<p><b>chasten</b>—"chastise."
	The <i>Greek,</i> "<i>paideu,</i>" which in classical <i>Greek</i>
	means to <i>instruct,</i> in the New Testament means to <i>instruct
	by chastisement</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:5">Hebrews 12:5</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+12:6">Hebrews 12:6</span>). David was <i>rebuked
	unto conviction,</i> when he cried, "I have sinned against the
	Lord"; the <i>chastening</i> followed when his child was taken
	from him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+12:13">2 Samuel 12:13</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+12:14">2 Samuel 12:14</span>).
	In the divine <i>chastening,</i> the sinner at one and the same time
	winces under the rod and learns righteousness. 
	</p>
<p><b>be zealous</b>—habitually.
	Present tense in the <i>Greek,</i> of a <i>lifelong course of zeal.</i>
	The opposite of "lukewarm." The <i>Greek</i> by
	alliteration marks this: Laodicea had not been "hot"
	(<i>Greek,</i> "<i>zestos</i>"), she is therefore urged to
	"be zealous" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>zeleue</i>"):
	both are derived from the same verb, <i>Greek,</i> "<i>zeo,</i>"
	"to boil." 
	</p>
<p><b>repent</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	aorist: of an act to be <i>once for all done,</i> and <i>done at
	once.</i></p>
