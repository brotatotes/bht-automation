19. (Job 5:17;
	Proverbs 3:11; Proverbs 3:12;
	Hebrews 12:5; Hebrews 12:6.)
	So in the case of Manasseh (Hebrews 12:6- :). 
	As many—All. "He
	scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. And shalt thou be an
	exception? If excepted from suffering the scourge, thou art excepted
	from the number of the sons" [AUGUSTINE].
	This is an encouragement to Laodicea not to despair, but to regard
	the rebuke as a token for good, if she profit by it. 
	I love—Greek,
	"philo," the love of gratuitous affection,
	independent of any grounds for esteem in the object loved. But in the
	case of Philadelphia (Revelation 3:9),
	"I have loved thee" (Greek, "egapesa")
	with the love of esteem, founded on the judgment. Compare the
	note in my English Gnomon of BENGEL,
	John 21:15-17. 
	I rebuke—The "I"
	in the Greek stands first in the sentence emphatically. I in
	My dealings, so altogether unlike man's, in the case of all whom I
	love, rebuke. The Greek, "elencho," is
	the same verb as in John 16:8,
	"(the Holy Ghost) will convince (rebuke unto conviction)
	the world of sin." 
	chasten—"chastise."
	The Greek, "paideu," which in classical Greek
	means to instruct, in the New Testament means to instruct
	by chastisement (Hebrews 12:5;
	Hebrews 12:6). David was rebuked
	unto conviction, when he cried, "I have sinned against the
	Lord"; the chastening followed when his child was taken
	from him (2 Samuel 12:13; 2 Samuel 12:14).
	In the divine chastening, the sinner at one and the same time
	winces under the rod and learns righteousness. 
	be zealous—habitually.
	Present tense in the Greek, of a lifelong course of zeal.
	The opposite of "lukewarm." The Greek by
	alliteration marks this: Laodicea had not been "hot"
	(Greek, "zestos"), she is therefore urged to
	"be zealous" (Greek, "zeleue"):
	both are derived from the same verb, Greek, "zeo,"
	"to boil." 
	repent—Greek
	aorist: of an act to be once for all done, and done at
	once.
