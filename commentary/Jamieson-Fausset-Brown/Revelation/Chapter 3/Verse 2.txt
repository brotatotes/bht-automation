<p><b>before God</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"in the sight of God." The three oldest manuscripts,
	<i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> and <i>Coptic,</i> read, "before (in the
	sight of) MY God"; Christ's judgment is God the Father's
	judgment. In the sight of men, Sardis had "a name of living":
	"so many and so great are the obligations of pastors, that he
	who would in reality fulfil even a third of them, would be esteemed
	holy by men, whereas, if content with that alone, he would be sure
	not to escape hell" [JUAN
	D'AVILA]. Note: in Sardis
	and Laodicea alone of the seven we read of no conflict with foes
	within or without the Church. Not that either had renounced the
	<i>appearance</i> of opposition to the world; but neither had the
	faithfulness to witness for God by word and example, so as to
	"torment them that dwelt on the earth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
