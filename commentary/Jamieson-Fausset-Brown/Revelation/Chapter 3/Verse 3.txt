<p><b>3. how thou hast received</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+2:6">Colossians 2:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+4:1">1 Thessalonians 4:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+6:20">1 Timothy 6:20</span>). What Sardis is to
	"remember" is, not <i>how</i> joyfully she had received
	originally the Gospel message, but how the precious deposit was
	committed to her originally, so that she could not say, she had not
	"received and heard" it. The <i>Greek</i> is not aorist (as
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:4">Revelation 2:4</span>, as to Ephesus, "Thou
	<i>didst leave</i> thy first love"), but "thou hast
	received" (perfect), and still hast the permanent deposit of
	doctrine committed to thee. The word "keep" (so the <i>Greek</i>
	is for <i>English Version,</i> "hold fast") which follows,
	accords with this sense. "Keep" or observe the commandment
	which thou hast received and didst hear. 
	</p>
<p><b>heard</b>—<i>Greek</i>
	aorist, "didst hear," namely, when the Gospel doctrine was
	committed to thee. TRENCH
	explains "how," <i>with what demonstration of the Spirit
	and power</i> from Christ's ambassadors the truth came to you, and
	how heartily and zealously you at first received it. Similarly
	BENGEL, "Regard to
	her former <i>character</i> (<i>how</i> it once stood) ought to guard
	Sardis against the future <i>hour, whatsoever</i> it shall be,
	proving fatal to her." But it is not likely that the Spirit
	repeats the same exhortation virtually to Sardis as to Ephesus. 
	</p>
<p><b>If therefore</b>—seeing
	thou art so warned, if, nevertheless, c. 
	</p>
<p><b>come on thee as a thief</b>—in
	special judgment on thee as a Church, with the same stealthiness and
	as unexpectedly as shall be My visible second coming. As <i>the thief</i>
	gives no notice of his approach. Christ applies the language which in
	its fullest sense describes His second coming, to describe His coming
	in special judgments on churches and states (as Jerusalem, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+2:4- :">Revelation 2:4- :</span>) these special judgments being anticipatory earnests of
	that great last coming. "The last day is hidden from us, that
	every day may be observed by us" [AUGUSTINE].
	Twice Christ in the days of His flesh spake the same words (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:42">Matthew 24:42</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:43">Matthew 24:43</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:39">Luke 12:39</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="lu+12:40">Luke 12:40</span>); and so deeply had His
	words been engraven on the minds of the apostles that they are often
	repeated in their writings (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:15">Revelation 16:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:2">1 Thessalonians 5:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:4">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:6">1 Thessalonians 5:6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span>).
	The Greek proverb was that "the feet of the avenging deities are
	shod with wool," expressing the noiseless approach of the divine
	judgments, and their possible nearness at the moment when they were
	supposed the farthest off [TRENCH].</p>
