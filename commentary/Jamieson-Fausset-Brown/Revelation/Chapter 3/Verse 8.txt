<p><b>8. I have set</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"given": it is My gracious <i>gift</i> to thee. 
	</p>
<p><b>open door</b>—for
	evangelization; a door of spiritual usefulness. The <i>opening of a
	door</i> by Him to the Philadelphian Church accords with the previous
	assignation to Him of "the key of David." 
	</p>
<p><b>and</b>—The three oldest
	manuscripts, A, B, C, and ORIGEN
	read, "<i>which</i> no man can shut." 
	</p>
<p><b>for</b>—"because."
	</p>
<p><b>a little</b>—This gives the
	idea that Christ says, He sets before Philadelphia an open door
	because she has <i>some little</i> strength; whereas the sense rather
	is, He does so because she has "<i>but little</i> strength":
	being consciously weak herself, she is the fitter object for God's
	power to rest on [so AQUINAS],
	that so the Lord Christ may have all the glory. 
	</p>
<p><b>and hast kept</b>—<i>and</i>
	so, the <i>littleness of thy strength</i> becoming the source of
	Almighty power to thee, as leading thee to rest wholly on My great
	power, <i>thou hast kept My word.</i> GROTIUS
	makes "little strength" to mean that she had a Church <i>small
	in numbers and external resources:</i> "a little flock poor in
	worldly goods, and of small account in the eyes of men"
	[TRENCH]. So ALFORD.
	I prefer the view given above. The <i>Greek</i> verbs are in the
	aorist tense: "Thou didst keep . . . didst not deny My name":
	alluding to some particular occasion when her faithfulness was put to
	the test.</p>
