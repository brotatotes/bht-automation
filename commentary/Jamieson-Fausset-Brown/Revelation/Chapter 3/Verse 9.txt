<p><b>9. I will make</b>â€”<i>Greek</i>
	present, "I make," literally, "I give" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). The promise to Philadelphia is larger than that to Smyrna.
	To Smyrna the promise was that "the synagogue of Satan"
	should not prevail against the faithful in her: to Philadelphia, that
	she should even win over some of "the synagogue of Satan"
	to <i>fall on their faces and confess God is in her of a truth.</i>
	Translate, "(some) of the synagogue." For until Christ
	shall come, and <i>all</i> Israel then be saved, there is but "a
	remnant" being gathered out of the Jews "according to the
	election of grace." This is an instance of how Christ set before
	her an "open door," some of her greatest adversaries, the
	Jews, being brought to the obedience of the faith. Their <i>worshipping
	before her feet</i> expresses the convert's willingness to take the
	very lowest place in the Church, doing servile honor to those whom
	once they persecuted, rather than dwell with the ungodly. So the
	Philippian jailer before Paul.</p>
