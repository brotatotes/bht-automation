<p><span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. VISION OF
	GOD'S THRONE
	IN HEAVEN; THE FOUR
	AND TWENTY ELDERS;
	THE FOUR LIVING
	CREATURES. 
	</p>
<p>Here begins the Revelation proper;
	and first, the fourth and fifth chapters set before us the heavenly
	scenery of the succeeding visions, and God on His throne, as the
	<i>covenant God of His Church,</i> the Revealer of them to His
	apostle through Jesus Christ. The first great portion comprises the
	opening of the seals and the sounding of the trumpets (fourth to
	eleventh chapters). As the communication respecting the seven
	churches opened with a suitable vision of the Lord Jesus as Head of
	the Church, so the second part opens with a vision suitable to the
	matter to be revealed. The scene is changed from earth to <i>heaven.</i></p>
