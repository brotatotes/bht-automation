<p><b>1. After this</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"After these things," marking the opening of the next
	vision in the succession. Here is the transition from "the
	things which are" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:19">Revelation 1:19</span>),
	the existing state of the seven churches, as a type of the Church in
	general, in John's time, to "the things which shall be
	hereafter," namely, in relation to the time when John wrote. 
	</p>
<p><b>I looked</b>—rather as
	<i>Greek,</i> "I saw" in vision; not as <i>English Version</i>
	means, I directed my <i>look</i> that way. 
	</p>
<p><b>was</b>—Omit, as not being
	in the <i>Greek.</i>
</p>
<p><b>opened</b>—"standing
	open"; not as though John saw it in the act of being opened.
	Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+1:1">Ezekiel 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+3:16">Matthew 3:16</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+7:56">Acts 7:56</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+10:11">Acts 10:11</span>.
	But in those visions the heavens opened, disclosing the visions to
	those below on earth. Whereas here, heaven, the temple of God,
	remains closed to those on earth, but John is transported in vision
	through an open door up into heaven, whence he can see things passing
	on earth or in heaven, according as the scenes of the several visions
	require.

<p><i><b>was</b></i><b> as it

	"Behold" governs in sense both "a door," &amp;c.,
