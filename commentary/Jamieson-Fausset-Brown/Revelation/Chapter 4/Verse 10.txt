	"<i>shall</i> fall down": implying that this ascription of
	praise <i>shall be</i> repeated onward to eternity. So also, "<i>shall</i>
	worship . . . <i>shall</i> cast their crowns," namely, in
	acknowledgment that all the merit of their <i>crowns</i> (not kingly
	<i>diadems,</i> but the <i>crowns</i> of conquerors) is due to Him.</p>
