<p><b>11. O Lord</b>—The two oldest
	manuscripts, A, B, <i>Vulgate,</i> and <i>Syriac</i> add, "and
	our God." "Our" by virtue of creation, and especially
	redemption. One oldest manuscript, B, and <i>Syriac</i> insert "the
	Holy One." But another, A, <i>Vulgate,</i> and <i>Coptic</i>
	omit this, as <i>English Version</i> does. 
	</p>
<p><b>glory,</b> c.—"<i>the</i>
	glory . . . <i>the</i> honour . . . <i>the</i> power." 
	</p>
<p><b>thou</b>—emphatic in the
	<i>Greek:</i> "It is THOU
	who didst create." 
	</p>
<p><b>all things</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"the all things": the universe. 
	</p>
<p><b>for,</b> &amp;c.—<i>Greek,</i>
	"on account of" "for the sake of Thy pleasure,"
	or "will." <i>English Version</i> is good <i>Greek.</i>
	Though the context better suits, it was <i>because of Thy will,</i>
	that "they were" (so one oldest manuscript, A, <i>Vulgate,
	Syriac,</i> and <i>Coptic</i> read, instead of <i>English Version</i>
	"are": another oldest manuscript, B, reads, "They were
	<i>not,</i> and were created," were created out of nothing),
	that is, <i>were existing,</i> as contrasted with their previous
	non-existence. With God to <i>will</i> is to effect: to determine is
	to perform. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+1:3">Genesis 1:3</span>, "Let
	there be light, and there was light": in <i>Hebrew</i> an
	expressive tautology, the same word and tense and letters being used
	for "let there be," and "there was," marking the
	simultaneity and identity of the will and the effect. D. LONGINUS
	[<i>On the Sublime,</i> 9], a heathen, praises this description of
	God's power by "the lawgiver of the Jews, no ordinary man,"
	as one worthy of the theme.

<p><b>were created</b>—by Thy
	definite act of creation at a definite time.</p>
