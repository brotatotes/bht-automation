2. And—omitted in the two
	oldest manuscripts, Vulgate, Syriac.
I was, c.—Greek,
	"I became in the Spirit" (see on  :-): I was completely rapt in vision into the heavenly world. 
	was set—not was
	placed, but was situated, literally, "lay." 
	one sat on the throne—the
	Eternal Father: the Creator ( :-): also compare Revelation 4:8
Revelation 1:4, where also the Father is
	designated, "which is, and was, and is to come." When the
	Son, "the Lamb," is introduced, Revelation 1:4- :, a new song is sung which distinguishes the
	Sitter on the throne from the Lamb, "Thou hast
	redeemed us to God," and Revelation 1:4- :, "Unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
	Lamb." So also in Revelation 5:7,
	as in Daniel 7:13, the Son of
	man brought before the Ancient of days is distinguished
	from Him. The Father in essence is invisible, but in Scripture at
	times is represented as assuming a visible form.
