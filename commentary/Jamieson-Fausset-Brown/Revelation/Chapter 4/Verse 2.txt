<p><b>2. And</b>—omitted in the two
	oldest manuscripts, <i>Vulgate, Syriac.</i>
</p>
<p><b>I was,</b> c.—<i>Greek,</i>
	"I became in the Spirit" (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): I was completely rapt in vision into the heavenly world. 
	</p>
<p><b>was set</b>—not <i>was
	placed,</i> but <i>was situated,</i> literally, "lay." 
	</p>
<p><b>one sat on the throne</b>—the
	Eternal Father: the Creator (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): also compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:8">Revelation 4:8</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4">Revelation 1:4</span>, where also the Father is
	designated, "which is, and was, and is to come." When the
	Son, "the Lamb," is introduced, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4- :">Revelation 1:4- :</span>, a <i>new</i> song is sung which distinguishes <i>the
	Sitter on the throne</i> from <i>the Lamb,</i> "<i>Thou</i> hast
	redeemed us to <i>God,</i>" and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+1:4- :">Revelation 1:4- :</span>, "Unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
	Lamb." So also in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:7">Revelation 5:7</span>,
	as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:13">Daniel 7:13</span>, the <i>Son of
	man</i> brought before <i>the Ancient of days</i> is distinguished
	from Him. The Father in essence is invisible, but in Scripture at
	times is represented as assuming a visible form.</p>
