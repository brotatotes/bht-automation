<p><b>4. seats</b>—rather as the <i>Greek</i>
	is translated in this very verse, "thrones," of course
	lower and smaller than the grand central <i>throne.</i> So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "the seat (rather, <i>throne</i>) of the beasts,"
	in hellish parody of God's throne.

<p><b>four and twenty elders</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the</i> four and twenty (or as one oldest manuscript,
	'twenty-four') elders": the well-known elders [ALFORD].
	But TREGELLES translates,
	"Upon the twenty-four thrones (<i>I saw:</i> omitted in two
	oldest manuscripts) elders sitting": which is more probable, as
	<i>the twenty-four elders</i> were not mentioned before, whereas <i>the
	twenty-four thrones</i> were. They are not angels, for they have
	<i>white robes</i> and <i>crowns</i> of victory, implying a conflict
	and endurance, "Thou hast <i>redeemed us</i>": they
	represent the <i>Heads</i> of the Old and New Testament churches
	respectively, the Twelve Patriarchs (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, not in their personal, but in their representative
	character), and Twelve Apostles. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "the song of <i>Moses,</i> and of the <i>Lamb,</i>"
	the double constituents of the Church are implied, the Old Testament
	and the New Testament. "Elders" is the very term for <i>the
	ministry</i> both of the Old and New Testament, the Jewish and the
	catholic Gentile Church. The tabernacle was a "pattern" of
	the heavenly antitype; the holy place, a figure of HEAVEN
	ITSELF. Thus Jehovah's throne is represented by the mercy seat
	in the holiest, the Shekinah-cloud over it. "The seven lamps of
	fire before the throne" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) are antitypical to the seven-branched candlestick also in
	the holiest, emblem of the manifold Spirit of God: "the sea of
	glass" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>) corresponds
	to the molten sea before the sanctuary, wherein the priests washed
	themselves before entering on their holy service; so introduced here
	in connection with the redeemed "priests unto God" (compare
	<i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>).
	The "four living creatures" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:6">Revelation 4:6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:7">Revelation 4:7</span>) answer to the cherubim
	over the mercy seat. So the twenty-four throned and crowned elders
	are typified by the twenty-four chiefs of the twenty-four courses of
	priests, "<i>Governors</i> of the sanctuary, and governors of
	God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+24:5">1 Chronicles 24:5</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ch+25:1-31">1 Chronicles 25:1-31</span>).</p>
