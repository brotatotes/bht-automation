<p><b>6.</b> Two oldest manuscripts, A, B,
	<i>Vulgate, Coptic,</i> and <i>Syriac</i> read, "<i>As it were</i>
	a sea of glass." 
	</p>
<p><b>like . . . crystal</b>—not
	imperfectly transparent as the ancient common glass, but like rock
	crystal. Contrast the turbid "many waters" on which the
	harlot "sitteth" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:1">Revelation 17:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span>). Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15- :">Revelation 17:15- :</span>, "the sky . . . as a molten looking-glass." Thus,
	primarily, the pure ether which separates God's throne from John, and
	from all things before it, may be meant, symbolizing the "purity,
	calmness, and majesty of God's rule" [ALFORD].
	But see the analogue in the temple, the molten sea <i>before</i> the
	sanctuary (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4">Revelation 4:4</span>,
	above). There is in this sea depth and transparency, but not the
	fluidity and instability of the natural sea (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4- :">Revelation 4:4- :</span>). It stands solid, calm, and clear, God's <i>judgments</i>
	are called "a great deep" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:4- :">Revelation 4:4- :</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:2">Revelation 15:2</span> it is a
	"sea of glass mingled with <i>fire.</i>" Thus there is
	symbolized here the purificatory baptism of water and the Spirit of
	all who are made "kings and priests unto God." In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+15:2- :">Revelation 15:2- :</span> the baptism with the fire of trial is meant. Through both
	all the king-priests have to pass in coming to God: His <i>judgments,</i>
	which overwhelm the ungodly, they stand firmly upon, as on a solid
	sea of glass; able like Christ to walk on the sea, as though it were
	solid. 
	</p>
<p><b>round about the throne</b>—one
	in the midst of each side of the throne. 
	</p>
<p><b>four beasts</b>—The <i>Greek</i>
	for "beasts," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1">Revelation 13:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:11">Revelation 13:11</span>, is different, <i>therion,</i>
	the symbol for the carnal man by opposition to God losing his true
	glory, as lord, under Him, of the lower creatures, and degraded to
	the level of the <i>beast.</i> Here it is <i>zoon,</i> "living
	creatures"; not <i>beast.</i></p>
