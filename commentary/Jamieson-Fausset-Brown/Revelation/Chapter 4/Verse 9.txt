<p><b>9-11.</b> The ground of praise here
	is God's <i>eternity,</i> and God's <i>power</i> and <i>glory</i>
	manifested in the creation of all things for His pleasure. Creation
	is the foundation of all God's other acts of power, wisdom, and love,
	and therefore forms the first theme of His creatures' thanksgivings.
	The four living creatures take the lead of the twenty-four elders,
	both in this anthem, and in that <i>new song</i> which follows on the
	ground of their redemption (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>when</b>—that is,
	whensoever: as often as. A simultaneous giving of glory on the part
	of the beasts, and on the part of the elders. 
	</p>
<p><b>give</b>—"shall give"
	in one oldest manuscript. 
	</p>
<p><b>for ever and ever</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"unto the ages of the ages."</p>
