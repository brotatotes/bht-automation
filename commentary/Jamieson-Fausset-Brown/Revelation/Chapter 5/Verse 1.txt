<p><b>1. in,</b> c.—<i>Greek,</i>
	"(lying) <i>upon</i> the right hand." His right hand was
	open and on it lay the book. On God's part there was no withholding
	of His future purposes as contained in the book: the only obstacle to
	unsealing it is stated in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+5:3">Revelation 5:3</span>
	[ALFORD]. 
	</p>
<p><b>book</b>—rather, as accords
	with the ancient form of books, and with the <i>writing on the
	backside,</i> "a roll." The <i>writing on the back</i>
	implies fulness and completeness, so that nothing more needs to be
	added (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:18">Revelation 22:18</span>). The roll, or
	book, appears from the context to be "<i>the title-deed of man's
	inheritance</i>" [DE
	BURGH] redeemed by Christ,
	and contains the successive steps by which He shall recover it from
	its usurper and obtain actual possession of the kingdom already
	"purchased" for Himself and His elect saints. However, no
	portion of the roll is said to be <i>unfolded</i> and <i>read</i> but
	simply the <i>seals</i> are successively <i>opened,</i> giving final
	access to its contents being read as a perfect whole, which shall not
	be until the events symbolized by the seals shall have been past,
	when <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span> shall receive its
	<i>complete</i> accomplishment, and the Lamb shall reveal God's
	providential plans in redemption in all their manifold beauties. Thus
	the opening of the seals will mean the successive steps by which God
	in Christ clears the way for the final opening and reading of the
	book at the visible setting up of the kingdom of Christ. Compare, at
	the grand consummation, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12">Revelation 20:12</span>,
	"Another book was opened . . . the book of life"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12- :">Revelation 20:12- :</span>. None is worthy to do so save the Lamb, for He alone as
	such has redeemed man's forfeited inheritance, of which <i>the book
	is the title-deed.</i> The question (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:12- :">Revelation 20:12- :</span>) is not (as commonly supposed), Who should reveal the
	destinies of the Church (for this any inspired prophet would be
	competent to do)? but, Who has the WORTH
	<i>to give man a new title to his lost inheritance?</i> [DE
	BURGH].

<p><b>sealed . . . seven
	seals</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "sealed up," or "firmly
	sealed." The number <i>seven</i> (divided into four, the
	world-wide number, and three, the divine) abounds in Revelation and
	expresses <i>completeness.</i> Thus, the <i>seven seals,</i>
	representing all power given to the Lamb; the <i>seven trumpets,</i>
	by which the world kingdoms are shaken and overthrown, and the Lamb's
	kingdom ushered in; and the <i>seven vials,</i> by which the beast's
	kingdom is destroyed.</p>
