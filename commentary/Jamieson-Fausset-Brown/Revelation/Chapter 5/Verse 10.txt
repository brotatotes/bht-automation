<p><b>10. made us</b>—A, B, <i>Aleph,
	Vulgate, Syriac,</i> and <i>Coptic</i> read, "them." The
	<i>Hebrew</i> construction of the third person for the first, has a
	graphic relation to <i>the redeemed,</i> and also has a more modest
	sound than <i>us, priests</i> [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>unto our God</b>—So B and
	<i>Aleph</i> read. But A omits the clause. 
	</p>
<p><b>kings</b>—So B reads. But
	A, <i>Aleph, Vulgate, Coptic,</i> and CYPRIAN,
	read, "A kingdom." <i>Aleph</i> reads also "a
	priesthood" for <i>priests.</i> They who cast their crowns
	before the throne, do not call themselves <i>kings</i> in the sight
	of the great <i>King</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:10">Revelation 4:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:11">Revelation 4:11</span>); though their priestly
	access has such dignity that their reigning on earth cannot exceed
	it. So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6">Revelation 20:6</span> they are not
	called "kings" [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>we shall reign on the
	earth</b>—This is a new feature added to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6- :">Revelation 20:6- :</span>. <i>Aleph, Vulgate,</i> and <i>Coptic</i> read, "<i>They</i>
	shall reign." A and B read, "<i>They reign.</i>"
	ALFORD takes this reading
	and explains it of the Church EVEN
	NOW, in Christ her Head, reigning on the earth: "all
	things are being put under her feet, as under His; her kingly office
	and rank are asserted, even in the midst of persecution." But
	even if we read (I think the weightiest authority is against it),
	"They <i>reign,</i>" still it is the prophetical present
	for the future: the seer being transported into the future when the
	full number of the redeemed (represented by the <i>four living
	creatures</i>) shall be complete and the visible <i>kingdom begins.</i>
	The saints do spiritually reign now; but certainly not as they shall
	when the prince of this world shall be bound (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+20:6- :">Revelation 20:6- :</span>). So far from <i>reigning on the earth</i> now, they are
	"made as the filth of the world and the offscouring of all
	things." In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:18">Revelation 11:18</span>, the locality and time
	of the kingdom are marked. KELLY
	translates, "reign <i>over</i> the earth" (<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>epi tees gees</i>"), which is justified by the <i>Greek</i>
	(<i>Septuagint,</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+9:8">Judges 9:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+2:22">Matthew 2:22</span>). The elders, though
	ruling <i>over the earth,</i> shall not necessarily (according to
	this passage) remain <i>on</i> the earth. But <i>English Version</i>
	is justified by <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+3:10">Revelation 3:10</span>. "The
	elders were <i>meek,</i> but the flock of the meek independently is
	much larger" [BENGEL].</p>
