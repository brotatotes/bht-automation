11. I beheld—the angels: who
	form the outer circle, while the Church, the object of redemption,
	forms the inner circle nearest the throne. The heavenly hosts ranged
	around gaze with intense love and adoration at this crowning
	manifestation of God's love, wisdom, and power. 
	ten thousand times ten
	thousand—Greek, "myriads of myriads."
