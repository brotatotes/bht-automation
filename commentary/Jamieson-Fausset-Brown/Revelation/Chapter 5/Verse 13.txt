<p><b>13.</b> The universal chorus of
	creation, including the outermost circles as well as the inner (of
	saints and angels), winds up the doxology. The <i>full</i>
	accomplishment of this is to be when Christ takes His great power and
	reigns visibly. 
	</p>
<p><b>every creature</b>—"all
	His works in all places of His dominion" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>under the earth</b>—the
	departed spirits in Hades. 
	</p>
<p><b>such as are</b>—So B and
	<i>Vulgate.</i> But A omits this. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the sea</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>upon</i> the sea": the sea animals which are regarded
	as being on the surface [ALFORD].
	</p>
<p><b>all that are in them</b>—So
	<i>Vulgate</i> reads. A omits "all (things)" here (<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>panta</i>"), and reads, "I heard all (<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>pantas</i>") saying": implying the harmonious
	concert of all in the four quarters of the universe. 
	</p>
<p><b>Blessing,</b> &amp;c.—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the</i> blessing, <i>the</i> honor, and <i>the</i> glory,
	and <i>the might to the ages of the ages.</i>" The <i>fourfold</i>
	ascription indicates <i>world-wide</i> universality.</p>
