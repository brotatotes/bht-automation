<p><b>5. one of</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "one
	from among." The "elder" meant is, according to some
	(in LYRA), Matthew. With
	this accords the description here given of Christ, "the <i>Lion,</i>
	which is (so the <i>Greek</i>) of the tribe of Juda, the root of
	David"; the royal, David-descended, lion-aspect of Christ being
	that prominent in Matthew, whence the lion among the fourfold
	cherubim is commonly assigned to him. GERHARD
	in BENGEL thought Jacob to
	be meant, being, doubtless, one of those who rose with Christ and
	ascended to heaven (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:52">Matthew 27:52</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+27:53">Matthew 27:53</span>). The elders in heaven
	round God's throne know better than John, still in the flesh, the
	far-reaching power of Christ.

<p><b>Root of David</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:1">Isaiah 11:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10">Isaiah 11:10</span>). Not merely "a
	sucker come up from David's ancient root" (as ALFORD
	limits it), but also including the idea of His being Himself the root
	and origin of David: compare these two truths brought together, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10- :">Isaiah 11:10- :</span>. Hence He is called not merely <i>Son of David,</i> but
	also <i>David.</i> He is at once "the branch" of David, and
	"the root" of David, David's Son and David's Lord, the <i>Lamb</i>
	slain and therefore the <i>Lion</i> of Juda: about to reign over
	Israel, and thence over the whole earth.

<p><b>prevailed</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"conquered": absolutely, as elsewhere (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+11:10- :">Isaiah 11:10- :</span>): <i>gained the victory:</i> His past victory over all the
	powers of darkness entitles Him now to open the book.

<p><b>to open</b>—that is, <i>so
	as to open.</i> One oldest manuscript, B, reads, "He that
	openeth," that is, whose office it is to open, but the weight of
	oldest authorities is with <i>English Version</i> reading, namely, A,
	<i>Vulgate, Coptic,</i> and ORIGEN.</p>
