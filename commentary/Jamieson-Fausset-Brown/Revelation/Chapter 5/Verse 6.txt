<p><b>6. I beheld, and, lo</b>—One
	oldest manuscript, A, omits "and, lo." Another, B, CYPRIAN,
	c., support, "and, lo," but omit, "and I beheld."
	</p>
<p><b>in the midst of the
	throne</b>—that is, not on the throne (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), but in the midst of the company (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) which was "round about the throne." 
	</p>
<p><b>Lamb</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>arnion</i>" always found in Revelation exclusively,
	except in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15">John 21:15</span> alone: it
	expresses <i>endearment,</i> namely, the endearing relation in which
	Christ now stands to us, as the consequence of His previous relation
	as the <i>sacrificial Lamb.</i> So also our relation to Him: He the
	<i>precious Lamb,</i> we His <i>dear lambs,</i> one with Him. BENGEL
	thinks there is in <i>Greek,</i> "<i>arnion,</i>" the idea
	of <i>taking the lead of the flock.</i> Another object of the form
	<i>Greek,</i> "<i>arnion,</i>" the Lamb, is to put Him in
	the more marked contrast to <i>Greek,</i> "<i>therion,</i>"
	the Beast. Elsewhere <i>Greek,</i> "<i>amnos,</i>" is
	found, applying to Him as the <i>paschal, sacrificial Lamb</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+21:15- :">John 21:15- :</span>, <i>Septuagint;</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:29">John 1:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+1:36">John 1:36</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+8:32">Acts 8:32</span>;

<p><b>as it had been slain</b>—bearing
	marks of His past death wounds. He was standing, though bearing the
	marks of one slain. In the midst of heavenly glory Christ crucified
	is still the prominent object. 
	</p>
<p><b>seven horns</b>—that is,
	<i>perfect might,</i> "seven" symbolizing <i>perfection;</i>
	"horns," <i>might,</i> in contrast to the <i>horns</i> of
	the Antichristian world powers, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:3">Revelation 17:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:7">Daniel 7:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+7:20">Daniel 7:20</span>;

	</p>
<p><b>seven eyes . . . the seven
	Spirits . . . sent forth</b>—So one oldest manuscript, A. But B
	reads, "<i>being</i> sent forth." As the <i>seven lamps</i>
	before the throne represent the Spirit of God immanent in the
	Godhead, so the <i>seven eyes</i> of the Lamb represent the same
	sevenfold Spirit profluent from the incarnate Redeemer in His
	world-wide energy. The <i>Greek</i> for "sent forth,"
	<i>apostellomena,</i> or else <i>apestalmenoi,</i> is akin to the
	term "apostle," reminding us of the Spirit-impelled labors
	of Christ's apostles and minister throughout the world: if the
	present tense be read, as seems best, the idea will be that of those
	labors <i>continually going on</i> unto the end. "Eyes"
	symbolize His all-watchful and wise providence for His Church, and
	against her foes.</p>
