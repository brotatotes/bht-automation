	prayers of saints—as
	the angel offers their prayers ( :-) with incense (compare  :-). This gives not the least sanction to Rome's dogma of our
	praying to saints. Though they be employed by God in some way
	unknown to us to present our prayers (nothing is said of their
	interceding for us), yet we are told to pray only to

	Revelation 22:9). Their own
	employment is praise (whence they all have harps): ours is
	prayer.
