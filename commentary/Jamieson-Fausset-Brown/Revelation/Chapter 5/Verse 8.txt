<p><b>prayers of saints</b>—as
	the angel offers their prayers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) with incense (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). This gives not the least sanction to Rome's dogma of our
	praying to saints. Though <i>they</i> be employed by God in some way
	unknown to us to present our prayers (nothing is said of their
	<i>interceding</i> for us), yet <i>we</i> are told to pray only to
	Him (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:8">Revelation 22:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:9">Revelation 22:9</span>). <i>Their own</i>
	employment is praise (whence they all have <i>harps</i>): ours is
	prayer.</p>
