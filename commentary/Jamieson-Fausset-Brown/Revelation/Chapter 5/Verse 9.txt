9. sung—Greek, "sing":
	it is their blessed occupation continually. The theme of redemption
	is ever new, ever suggesting fresh thoughts of praise, embodied in
	the "new song." 
	us to God—So manuscript
	B, Coptic, Vulgate, and CYPRIAN.
	But A omits "us": and Aleph reads instead, "to
	our God." 
	out of—the present
	election-church gathered out of the world, as distinguished
	from the peoples gathered to Christ as the subjects, not of an
	election, but of a general and world-wide conversion of all nations. 
	kindred . . . tongue . . .
	people . . . nation—The number four marks world-wide
	extension: the four quarters of the world. For "kindred,"
	translate as Greek, "tribe." This term and "people"
	are usually restricted to Israel: "tongue and nation"
	to the Gentiles (Revelation 7:9;
	Revelation 11:9; Revelation 13:7,
	the oldest reading; Revelation 14:6).
	Thus there is here marked the election-Church gathered from Jews and
	Gentiles. In Revelation 10:11, for
	"tribes," we find among the four terms "kings";
	in Revelation 17:15, "multitudes."
