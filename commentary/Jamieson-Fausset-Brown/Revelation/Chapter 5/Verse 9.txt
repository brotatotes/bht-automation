<p><b>9. sung</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "sing":
	it is their blessed occupation continually. The theme of <i>redemption</i>
	is ever new, ever suggesting fresh thoughts of praise, embodied in
	the "new song." 
	</p>
<p><b>us to God</b>—So manuscript
	B, <i>Coptic, Vulgate,</i> and CYPRIAN.
	But A omits "us": and <i>Aleph</i> reads instead, "to
	<i>our</i> God." 
	</p>
<p><b>out of</b>—the present
	election-church gathered <i>out of</i> the world, as distinguished
	from the peoples gathered to Christ as the subjects, not of an
	election, but of a general and world-wide conversion of all nations. 
	</p>
<p><b>kindred . . . tongue . . .
	people . . . nation</b>—The number <i>four</i> marks world-wide
	extension: the four quarters of the world. For "kindred,"
	translate as <i>Greek,</i> "tribe." This term and "people"
	are usually restricted to <i>Israel:</i> "tongue and nation"
	to the <i>Gentiles</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:9">Revelation 11:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:7">Revelation 13:7</span>,
	the oldest reading; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>).
	Thus there is here marked the election-Church gathered from Jews and
	Gentiles. In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+10:11">Revelation 10:11</span>, for
	"tribes," we find among the four terms "kings";
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+17:15">Revelation 17:15</span>, "multitudes."</p>
