	OF THE FIRST SIX
	OF THE SEVEN SEALS.
	 
	</p>
<p>Compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. Many (MEDE,
	FLEMING, NEWTON,
	&amp;c.) hold that all these seals have been fulfilled, the sixth
	having been so by the overthrow of paganism and establishment of
	Christianity under Constantine's edict, A.D.
	312. There can, however, be no doubt that at least the sixth seal is
	future, and is to be at the coming again of Christ. The great
	objection to supposing the seals to be finally and exhaustively
	fulfilled (though, probably, particular events may be partial
	fulfilments typical of the final and fullest one), is that, if so,
	they ought to furnish (as the destruction of Jerusalem, according to
	Christ's prophecy, does) a strong external evidence of Revelation.
	But it is clear they cannot be used for this, as hardly any two
	interpreters of this school are agreed on what events constitute the
	fulfilment of each seal. Probably not isolated facts, but <i>classes</i>
	of events preparing the way for Christ's coming kingdom, are intended
	by the opening of the seals. The four living creatures severally cry
	at the opening of the first four seals, "Come," which fact
	marks the division of the <i>seven,</i> as often occurs in this
	sacred number, into <i>four</i> and <i>three.</i></p>
