<p><b>1. one of the seals</b>—The oldest
	manuscripts, A, B, C, <i>Vulgate,</i> and <i>Syriac</i> read, "one
	of the <i>seven</i> seals." 
	</p>
<p><b>noise</b>—The three oldest
	manuscripts read this in the nominative or dative, not the genitive,
	as <i>English Version,</i> "I heard one from among the four
	living creatures saying, as (it were) <i>the voice</i> (or, '<i>as
	with the voice</i>') of thunder." The first living creature was
	like a <i>lion</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:7">Revelation 4:7</span>): his
	voice is in consonance. Implying the lion-like boldness with which,
	in the successive great revivals, the faithful have <i>testified for
	Christ,</i> and especially a little before His coming shall testify.
	Or, rather, their earnestness in praying for <i>Christ's coming.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Come and see</b>—One oldest
	manuscript, B, has "And see." But A, C, and <i>Vulgate</i>
	reject it. ALFORD rightly
	objects to <i>English Version</i> reading: "Whither was John to
	come? Separated as he was by the glassy sea from the throne, was he
	to cross it?" Contrast the form of expression, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:7- :">Revelation 4:7- :</span>. It is much more likely to be the cry of the redeemed to the
	Redeemer, "Come" and deliver the groaning creature from the
	bondage of corruption. Thus, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:2">Revelation 6:2</span>
	is an answer to the cry, <i>went</i> (literally, "came")
	forth corresponding to "Come." "Come," says
	GROTIUS, is the living
	creature's address to John, <i>calling his earnest attention.</i> But
	it seems hard to see how "Come" by itself can mean this.
	Compare the only other places in Revelation where it is used, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:1">Revelation 4:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17">Revelation 22:17</span>. If the four living
	creatures represent the four Gospels, the "Come" will be
	their invitation to everyone (for it is not written that they
	addressed <i>John</i>) to <i>accept</i> Christ's salvation while
	there is time, as the opening of the seals marks a progressive step
	towards the end (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:17- :">Revelation 22:17- :</span>). Judgments are foretold as accompanying the <i>preaching
	of the Gospel as a witness to all nations</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6-11">Revelation 14:6-11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:6-14">Matthew 24:6-14</span>). Thus the
	invitation, "Come," here, is aptly parallel to <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:6-40.24.14- :">Matthew 24:6-40.24.14- :</span>. The opening of the first four seals is followed by
	judgments preparatory for His coming. At the opening of the fifth
	seal, the martyrs above express the same (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10">Revelation 6:10</span>; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10- :">Revelation 6:10- :</span>). At the opening of the sixth seal, the Lord's coming is
	ushered in with terrors to the ungodly. At the seventh, the
	consummation is fully attained (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10- :">Revelation 6:10- :</span>).</p>
