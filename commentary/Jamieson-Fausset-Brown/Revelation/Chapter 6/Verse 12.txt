	fall from heaven; . . . then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn,
	and they shall see the Son of man coming"; imagery describing
	<i>the portents</i> of the immediate coming of the day of the Lord;
	but <i>not the coming itself</i> until the elect are sealed, and the
	judgments invoked by the martyrs descend on the earth, the sea, and
	the trees (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:1-3">Revelation 7:1-3</span>).

<p><b>earthquake</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"shaking" of <i>the heavens,</i> the sea, and the dry land;
	the shaking of these mutable things being the necessary preliminary
	to the setting up of those <i>things which cannot be shaken.</i> This
	is one of the <i>catchwords</i> [WORDSWORTH]
	connecting the sixth seal with the sixth trumpet (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:1-66.7.3- :">Revelation 7:1-66.7.3- :</span>) and the seventh vial (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:1-66.7.3- :">Revelation 7:1-66.7.3- :</span>); also the seventh seal (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:1-66.7.3- :">Revelation 7:1-66.7.3- :</span>).
