13. stars . . . fell . . . as a fig
	tree casteth her . . . figs— (Isaiah 34:4;
	Nahum 3:12). The Church shall be
	then ripe for glorification, the Antichristian world for destruction,
	which shall be accompanied with mighty phenomena in nature. As to the
	stars falling to the earth, Scripture describes natural phenomena as
	they would appear to the spectator, not in the language of scientific
	accuracy; and yet, while thus adapting itself to ordinary men, it
	drops hints which show that it anticipates the discoveries of modern
	science.
