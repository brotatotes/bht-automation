<p><b>14. departed</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>was separated from</i>" its place; "was made to
	depart." Not as ALFORD,
	"parted <i>asunder</i>"; for, on the contrary, it was
	rolled <i>together</i> as a scroll which had been open is rolled up
	and laid aside. There is no "asunder one from another" here
	in the <i>Greek,</i> as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, which ALFORD
	copies.
