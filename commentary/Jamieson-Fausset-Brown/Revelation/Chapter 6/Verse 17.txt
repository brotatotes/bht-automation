<p><b>17.</b> Literally, "the day,
	the great (day)," which can only mean the last great day. After
	the Lord has exhausted all His ordinary judgments, the sword, famine,
	pestilence, and wild beasts, and still sinners are impenitent, the
	great day of the Lord itself' shall come. <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> plainly forms a perfect parallelism to the six seals, not
	only in the events, but also in the order of their occurrence: <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, the first seal; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:6">Matthew 24:6</span>,
	the second seal; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:7">Matthew 24:7</span>, the
	third seal; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:7">Matthew 24:7</span>, end, the
	fourth seal; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:9">Matthew 24:9</span>, the fifth
	seal, the persecutions and abounding iniquity under which, as well as
	consequent judgments accompanied with gospel preaching to all nations
	as a witness, are particularly detailed, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:9- :">Matthew 24:9- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span>, the
	sixth seal. 
	</p>
<p><b>to stand</b>â€”to stand
	justified, and not condemned before the Judge. Thus the sixth seal
	brings us to the verge of the Lord's coming. The ungodly "tribes
	of the earth" tremble at the signs of His immediate approach.
	But before He actually inflicts the blow in person, "the elect"
	must be "gathered "out.</p>
