<p><b>4. red</b>—the color of <i>blood.</i>
	The color of the horse in each case answers to the mission of the
	rider. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "Think not I am come to send <i>peace</i> on
	earth; I came not to send <i>peace,</i> but a <i>sword.</i>" The
	<i>white</i> horse of Christ's bloodless victories is soon followed,
	through man's perversion of the Gospel, by the <i>red</i> horse of
	bloodshed; but this is overruled to the clearing away of the
	obstacles to Christ's coming kingdom. The patient <i>ox</i> is the
	emblem of the second <i>living creature</i> who, at the opening of
	this seal, saith, "Come." The saints amidst judgments on
	the earth in patience "endure to the end."

<p><b>that they should kill</b>—The
	<i>Greek</i> is indicative future, "that they may, as they also
	shall, kill one another."</p>
