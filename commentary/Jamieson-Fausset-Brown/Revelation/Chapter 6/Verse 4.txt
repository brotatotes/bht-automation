4. red—the color of blood.
	The color of the horse in each case answers to the mission of the
	rider. Compare  :-, "Think not I am come to send peace on
	earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword." The
	white horse of Christ's bloodless victories is soon followed,
	through man's perversion of the Gospel, by the red horse of
	bloodshed; but this is overruled to the clearing away of the
	obstacles to Christ's coming kingdom. The patient ox is the
	emblem of the second living creature who, at the opening of
	this seal, saith, "Come." The saints amidst judgments on
	the earth in patience "endure to the end." 
	that they should kill—The
	Greek is indicative future, "that they may, as they also
	shall, kill one another."
