	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+14:21">Ezekiel 14:21</span> with the
	four judgments here, the <i>sword, famine, pestilence,</i> and <i>wild
	beasts;</i> the <i>famine</i> the consequence of the <i>sword;
	pestilence,</i> that of <i>famine;</i> and <i>beasts</i> multiplying
	by the consequent depopulation. 
	</p>
<p><b>with the beasts</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"by"; more direct agency. These four seals are marked off
	from the three last, by the four living creatures introducing them
	with "Come." The calamities indicated are not restricted to
	one time, but extend through the whole period of Church history to
	the coming of Christ, before which last great and terrible day of the
	Lord they shall reach highest aggravation. The first seal is the
	summary, Christ going forth <i>conquering</i> till all enemies are
	subdued under Him, with a view to which the judgments subsequently
	specified accompany the <i>preaching of the Gospel for a witness to
	all nations.</i></p>
