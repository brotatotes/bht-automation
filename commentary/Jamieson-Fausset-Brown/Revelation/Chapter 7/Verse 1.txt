<p><b>1. And</b>—so B and <i>Syriac.</i>
	But A, C, <i>Vulgate,</i> and <i>Coptic</i> omit "and." 
	</p>
<p><b>after these things</b>—A,
	B, C, and <i>Coptic</i> read, "after this." The two visions
	in this chapter come in as an episode <i>after</i> the sixth seal,
	and before the seventh seal. It is clear that, though "Israel"
	may elsewhere designate the spiritual Israel, "the elect
	(Church) on earth" [ALFORD],
	here, where the names of the tribes one by one are specified, these
	names cannot have any but the literal meaning. The second advent will
	be the time of <i>the restoration of the kingdom to Israel,</i> when
	<i>the times of the Gentiles shall have been fulfilled,</i> and the
	Jews shall at last say, "Blessed is He that cometh in the name
	of the Lord." The period of the Lord's absence has been a blank
	in the history of the Jews as a nation. As then Revelation is the
	Book of the Second Advent [DE
	BURGH], naturally mention
	of God's restored favor to Israel occurs among the events that usher
	in Christ's advent.

<p><b>earth . . . sea . . .
	tree</b>—The judgments to descend on these are in answer to the
	martyrs' prayer under the <i>fifth</i> seal. Compare the same
	judgments under the <i>fifth</i> trumpet, the sealed being exempt (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>on any tree</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>against</i> any tree" (<i>Greek,</i> "<i>epi ti
	dendron</i>": but "<i>on</i> the earth," <i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>epi tees gees</i>").</p>
