<p><b>10. cried</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "cry,"
	in the three oldest manuscripts, A, B, C, <i>Vulgate, Syriac,</i> and
	<i>Coptic.</i> It is their continuing, ceaseless employment. 
	</p>
<p><b>Salvation</b>—literally,
	"THE salvation";
	all the praise of our salvation be ascribed to our God. At the Lord's
	entry into Jerusalem, the type, similarly "salvation" is
	the cry of the palm-bearing multitudes. <i>Hosanna</i> means "save
	us now"; taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, in which Psalm (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:14">Psalms 118:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:15">Psalms 118:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:21">Psalms 118:21</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+118:26">Psalms 118:26</span>) the same connection
	occurs between <i>salvation,</i> the <i>tabernacles</i> of the
	righteous, and the Jews' cry to be repeated by the whole nation at
	Christ's coming, "Blessed be He that cometh in the name of the
	Lord."</p>
