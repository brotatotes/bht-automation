<p><b>14. Sir</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "Lord."
	B, C, <i>Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic</i> versions, and CYPRIAN

<p><b>thou knowest</b>—taken from
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+37:3">Ezekiel 37:3</span>. Comparatively
	ignorant ourselves of divine things, it is well for us to look upward

<p><b>came</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"come"; implying that they are <i>just come.</i>
</p>
<p><b>great tribulation</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"THE great
	tribulation"; "the tribulation, the great one,"
	namely, <i>the</i> tribulation to which the martyrs were exposed
	under the fifth seal, the same which Christ foretells as about to
	precede His coming (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:21">Matthew 24:21</span>,
	<i>great tribulation</i>), and followed by the same signs as the
	sixth seal (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:29">Matthew 24:29</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+24:30">Matthew 24:30</span>),
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1">Daniel 12:1</span>; including also
	retrospectively all <i>the tribulation</i> which the saints of all
	ages have had to pass through. Thus this seventh chapter is a
	recapitulation of the vision of the six seals, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1- :">Daniel 12:1- :</span>, to fill up the outline there given in that part of it
	which affects the faithful of that day. There, however, their number
	was waiting to be completed, but here it is completed, and they are
	seen taken out of the earth before the judgments on the Antichristian
	apostasy; with their Lord, they, and all His faithful witnesses and
	disciples of past ages, wait for His coming and their coming to be
	glorified and reign together with Him. Meanwhile, in contrast with
	their previous sufferings, they are exempt from the hunger, thirst,
	and scorching heats of their life on earth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="da+12:1- :">Daniel 12:1- :</span>), and are fed and refreshed by the Lamb of God Himself
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:17">Revelation 7:17</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:1-4">Revelation 14:1-4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:13">Revelation 14:13</span>); an earnest of their
	future perfect blessedness in both body and soul united (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:4-6">Revelation 21:4-6</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:1-5">Revelation 22:1-5</span>).
