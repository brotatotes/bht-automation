<p><b>day and night</b>—that is,
	perpetually; as those approved of as priests by the Sanhedrim were
	clothed in white, and kept by turns a perpetual watch in the temple
	at Jerusalem; compare as to the singers, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12- :">1 Corinthians 13:12- :</span>, "day and night"; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+13:12- :">1 Corinthians 13:12- :</span>. Strictly "there is no night" in the heavenly

	is the heavenly analogue to His temple on earth, for strictly there
	is "no temple therein" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5- :">Revelation 22:5- :</span>), "God and the Lamb are the temple" filling the
	whole, so that there is no distinction of sacred and secular places;
	the city is the temple, and the temple the city. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+22:5- :">Revelation 22:5- :</span>, "the four living creatures rest not <i>day and night,</i>
	saying, Holy," c. 
	</p>
<p><b>shall dwell among them</b>—rather
	(<i>Greek,</i> "<i>scenosei ep' autous</i>"), "shall
	be the tabernacle over them" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+21:3">Revelation 21:3</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+26:11">Leviticus 26:11</span>, especially <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+4:5">Isaiah 4:5</span>;

	His <i>dwelling among them</i> is to be understood as a secondary
	truth, besides what is expressed, namely, His being their covert.
	When once He <i>tabernacled among us as the Word made flesh,</i> He
	was in great lowliness; then He shall be in great glory.</p>
