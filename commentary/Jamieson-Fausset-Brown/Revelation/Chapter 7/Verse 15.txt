15. Therefore—because they are
	so washed white; for without it they could never have entered God's
	holy heaven; Revelation 22:14,
	"Blessed are those who wash their robes (the oldest
	manuscripts reading), that they may have right to the tree of life,
	and may enter in through the gates into the city"; Revelation 21:27;
	Ephesians 5:26; Ephesians 5:27.
	before—Greek,
	"in the presence of." Matthew 5:8;
	1 Corinthians 13:12, "face to face."
	throne . . . temple—These
	are connected because we can approach the heavenly King only through
	priestly mediation; therefore, Christ is at once King and Priest on
	His throne. 
	day and night—that is,
	perpetually; as those approved of as priests by the Sanhedrim were
	clothed in white, and kept by turns a perpetual watch in the temple
	at Jerusalem; compare as to the singers, 1 Corinthians 13:12- :, "day and night"; 1 Corinthians 13:12- :. Strictly "there is no night" in the heavenly
	sanctuary (Revelation 22:5). 
	in his temple—in what
	is the heavenly analogue to His temple on earth, for strictly there
	is "no temple therein" (Revelation 22:5- :), "God and the Lamb are the temple" filling the
	whole, so that there is no distinction of sacred and secular places;
	the city is the temple, and the temple the city. Compare Revelation 22:5- :, "the four living creatures rest not day and night,
	saying, Holy," c. 
	shall dwell among them—rather
	(Greek, "scenosei ep' autous"), "shall
	be the tabernacle over them" (compare Revelation 21:3
Leviticus 26:11, especially Isaiah 4:5;
	Isaiah 4:6; Isaiah 8:14;
	Isaiah 25:4; Ezekiel 37:27).
	His dwelling among them is to be understood as a secondary
	truth, besides what is expressed, namely, His being their covert.
	When once He tabernacled among us as the Word made flesh, He
	was in great lowliness; then He shall be in great glory.
