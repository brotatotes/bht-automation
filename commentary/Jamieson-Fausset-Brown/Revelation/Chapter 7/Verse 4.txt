<p><b>4.</b> <i>Twelve</i> is the number
	of the tribes, and appropriate to <i>the Church:</i> three by four:
	three, the <i>divine</i> number, multiplied by four, the number for
	<i>world-wide extension.</i> Twelve by twelve implies <i>fixity and
	completeness,</i> which is taken a thousandfold in 144,000. A
	<i>thousand</i> implies <i>the world perfectly pervaded by the
	divine;</i> for it is <i>ten,</i> the world number, raised to the
	power of <i>three,</i> the number of God. 
	</p>
<p><b>of all the tribes</b>—literally,
	"out of every tribe"; not 144,000 of each tribe, but the
	aggregate of the twelve thousand <i>from every tribe.</i>

	ALFORD thinks, to the
	literal Israel being meant; for, in consummated glory, still the
	Church will be that "built on the foundation of the (<i>Twelve</i>)
	apostles (Israelites), Jesus Christ (an Israelite) being the chief
	corner-stone." Gentile believers shall have <i>the name of
	Jerusalem written on them,</i> in that they shall share the
	citizenship antitypical to that of the literal Jerusalem.</p>
