<p><b>5-8.</b> Judah (meaning <i>praise</i>)
	stands first, as Jesus' tribe. Benjamin, the youngest, is last; and
	with him is associated second last, Joseph. Reuben, as originally
	first-born, comes next after Judah, to whom it gave place, having by
	sin lost its primogeniture right. Besides the reason given above (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:2">Revelation 7:2</span>), another akin for the
	omission of Dan, is, its having been the first to lapse into idolatry
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+18:1-31">Judges 18:1-31</span>); for which
	same reason the name Ephraim, also (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+17:1-3">Judges 17:1-3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+4:17">Hosea 4:17</span>), is omitted, and Joseph
	substituted. Also, it had been now for long almost extinct. Long
	before, the Hebrews say [GROTIUS],
	it was reduced to the one family of Hussim, which perished
	subsequently in the wars before Ezra's time. Hence it is omitted in
	the fourth through eighth chapters of First Chronicles. Dan's small
	numbers are joined here to Naphtali's, whose brother he was by the
	same mother [BENGEL]. The
	twelve times twelve thousand sealed ones of Israel are the nucleus of
	transfigured humanity [AUBERLEN],
	to which the elect Gentiles are joined, "a multitude which no
	man could number," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9">Revelation 7:9</span>
	(that is, the Church of Jews and Gentiles indiscriminately, in which
	the Gentiles are the predominant element, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+7:9- :">Revelation 7:9- :</span>. The word "tribes," <i>Greek,</i> implies that
	<i>believing Israelites</i> are in this <i>countless multitude</i>).
	Both are in heaven, yet ruling over the earth, as ministers of
	blessing to its inhabitants: while upon earth the world of nations is
	added to the kingdom of Israel. The twelve apostles stand at the head
	of the whole. The upper and the lower congregation, though distinct,
	are intimately associated.</p>
