9. no man—Greek, "no
	one." 
	of all nations—Greek,
	"OUT OF every
	nation." The human race is "one nation" by
	origin, but afterwards separated itself into tribes, peoples,
	and tongues; hence, the one singular stands first, followed by
	the three plurals. 
	kindreds—Greek,
	"tribes." 
	people—Greek,
	"peoples." The "first-fruits unto the Lamb," the
	144,000 (Revelation 14:1-4) of
	Israel, are followed by a copious harvest of all nations, an election
	out of the Gentiles, as the 144,000 are an election out of
	Israel (see on Revelation 7:3). 
	white robes—(See on Revelation 7:3- :; also Revelation 3:5; Revelation 3:18;
	Revelation 4:4). 
	palms in . . . hands—the
	antitype to Christ's entry into Jerusalem amidst the palm-bearing
	multitude. This shall be just when He is about to come visibly and
	take possession of His kingdom. The palm branch is the symbol
	of joy and triumph. It was used at the feast of tabernacles, on the
	fifteenth day of the seventh month, when they kept feast to God in
	thanksgiving for the ingathered fruits. The antitype shall be the
	completed gathering in of the harvest of the elect redeemed here
	described. Compare Zechariah 14:16,
	whence it appears that the earthly feast of tabernacles will
	be renewed, in commemoration of Israel's preservation in her long
	wilderness-like sojourn among the nations from which she shall now be
	delivered, just as the original typical feast was to commemorate her
	dwelling for forty years in booths or tabernacles in the literal
	wilderness.
