	<i>out of</i> the Gentiles, as the 144,000 are an election out of

<p><b>palms in . . . hands</b>—the
	antitype to Christ's entry into Jerusalem amidst the palm-bearing
	multitude. This shall be just when He is about to come visibly and
	take possession of His kingdom. The <i>palm branch</i> is the symbol
	of joy and triumph. It was used at the feast of tabernacles, on the
	fifteenth day of the seventh month, when they kept feast to God in
	thanksgiving for the ingathered fruits. The antitype shall be the
	completed gathering in of the harvest of the elect redeemed here
	described. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+14:16">Zechariah 14:16</span>,
	whence it appears that the <i>earthly</i> feast of tabernacles will
	be renewed, in commemoration of Israel's preservation in her long
	wilderness-like sojourn among the nations from which she shall now be
	delivered, just as the original typical feast was to commemorate her
	dwelling for forty years in booths or tabernacles in the literal
	wilderness.</p>
