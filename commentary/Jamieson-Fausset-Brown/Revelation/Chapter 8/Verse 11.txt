11. The symbolizers interpret
	the star fallen from heaven as a chief minister (ARIUS,
	according to BULLINGER,
	BENGEL, and others; or
	some future false teacher, if, as is more likely, the event be still
	future) falling from his high place in the Church, and instead of
	shining with heavenly light as a star, becoming a torch lit
	with earthly fire and smouldering with smoke. And "wormwood,"
	though medicinal in some cases, if used as ordinary water would not
	only be disagreeable to the taste, but also fatal to life: so
	"heretical wormwood changes the sweet Siloas of Scripture into
	deadly Marahs" [WORDSWORTH].
	Contrast the converse change of bitter Marah water into sweet,  :-. ALFORD gives as
	an illustration in a physical point of view, the conversion of water
	into firewater or ardent spirits, which may yet go on
	to destroy even as many as a third of the ungodly in the latter days.
