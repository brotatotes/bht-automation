<p><b>13. an angel</b>—A, B, <i>Vulgate,
	Syriac,</i> and <i>Coptic</i> read for "angel," which is
	supported by none of the oldest manuscripts, "an eagle":
	the symbol of judgment descending fatally from on high; the king of
	birds pouncing on the prey. Compare this fourth trumpet and the
	flying <i>eagle</i> with the fourth seal introduced by the fourth
	living creature, "like a flying eagle," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+4:7">Revelation 4:7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:7">Revelation 6:7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:8">Revelation 6:8</span>:
	the aspect of Jesus as presented by the fourth Evangelist. <i>John</i>
	is compared in the cherubim (according to the primitive
	interpretation) to a flying eagle: <i>Christ's divine majesty</i> in
	this similitude is set forth in the Gospel according to John, His
	<i>judicial visitations</i> in the Revelation of John. Contrast
	"another angel," or <i>messenger,</i> with "the
	everlasting Gospel," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6">Revelation 14:6</span>.
	</p>
<p><b>through the midst of
	heaven</b>—<i>Greek,</i> "in the mid-heaven," that is, in
	the part of the sky where the sun reaches the <i>meridian:</i> in
	such a position as that the eagle is an object conspicuous to all. 
	</p>
<p><b>the inhabiters of the
	earth</b>—the ungodly, the "men of the world," whose
	"portion is in this life," upon whom the martyrs had prayed
	that their blood might be avenged (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+14:6- :">Revelation 14:6- :</span>). Not that they sought personal revenge, but their zeal was
	for the honor of God against the foes of God and His Church. 
	</p>
<p><b>the other</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>the remaining</i> voices."</p>
