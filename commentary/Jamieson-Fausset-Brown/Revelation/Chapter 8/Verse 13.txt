13. an angel—A, B, Vulgate,
	Syriac, and Coptic read for "angel," which is
	supported by none of the oldest manuscripts, "an eagle":
	the symbol of judgment descending fatally from on high; the king of
	birds pouncing on the prey. Compare this fourth trumpet and the
	flying eagle with the fourth seal introduced by the fourth
	living creature, "like a flying eagle," Revelation 4:7;
	Revelation 6:7; Revelation 6:8:
	the aspect of Jesus as presented by the fourth Evangelist. John
	is compared in the cherubim (according to the primitive
	interpretation) to a flying eagle: Christ's divine majesty in
	this similitude is set forth in the Gospel according to John, His
	judicial visitations in the Revelation of John. Contrast
	"another angel," or messenger, with "the
	everlasting Gospel," Revelation 14:6.
	through the midst of
	heaven—Greek, "in the mid-heaven," that is, in
	the part of the sky where the sun reaches the meridian: in
	such a position as that the eagle is an object conspicuous to all. 
	the inhabiters of the
	earth—the ungodly, the "men of the world," whose
	"portion is in this life," upon whom the martyrs had prayed
	that their blood might be avenged (Revelation 14:6- :). Not that they sought personal revenge, but their zeal was
	for the honor of God against the foes of God and His Church. 
	the other—Greek,
	"the remaining voices."
