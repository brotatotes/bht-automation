2. the seven angels—Compare
	the apocryphal Tobit 12:15, "I am Raphael, one of the
	seven holy angels which present the prayers of the saints, and which
	go in and out before the glory of the Holy One." Compare  :-, "I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God."
	stood—Greek,
	"stand." 
	seven trumpets—These
	come in during the time while the martyrs rest until their fellow
	servants also, that should be killed as they were, should be
	fulfilled; for it is the inhabiters of the earth on whom
	the judgments fall, on whom also the martyrs prayed that they should
	fall (Revelation 6:10). All the
	ungodly, and not merely some one portion of them, are meant, all the
	opponents and obstacles in the way of the kingdom of Christ and His
	saints, as is proved by Revelation 11:15;
	Revelation 11:18, end, at the close of
	the seven trumpets. The Revelation becomes more special only as it
	advances farther (Revelation 13:1-18;
	Revelation 16:10; Revelation 17:18).
	By the seven trumpets the world kingdoms are overturned to make way
	for Christ's universal kingdom. The first four are connected
	together; and the last three, which alone have Woe, woe, woe
	(Revelation 8:7-13).
