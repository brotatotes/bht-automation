<p><b>2. the seven angels</b>—Compare
	the apocryphal <u>Tobit 12:15</u>, "I am Raphael, one of the
	seven holy angels which present the prayers of the saints, and which
	go in and out before the glory of the Holy One." Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God."

<p><b>seven trumpets</b>—These
	come in during the time while the martyrs <i>rest until their fellow
	servants also, that should be killed as they were, should be
	fulfilled;</i> for it is <i>the inhabiters of the earth</i> on whom
	the judgments fall, on whom also the martyrs prayed that they should
	fall (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10">Revelation 6:10</span>). <i>All</i> the
	ungodly, and not merely some one portion of them, are meant, all the
	opponents and obstacles in the way of the kingdom of Christ and His
	saints, as is proved by <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:15">Revelation 11:15</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+11:18">Revelation 11:18</span>, end, at the close of
	the seven trumpets. The Revelation becomes more special only as it
	advances farther (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+13:1-18">Revelation 13:1-18</span>;

	By the seven trumpets the world kingdoms are overturned to make way
	for Christ's universal kingdom. The first four are connected
	together; and the last three, which alone have <i>Woe, woe, woe</i>
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+8:7-13">Revelation 8:7-13</span>).</p>
