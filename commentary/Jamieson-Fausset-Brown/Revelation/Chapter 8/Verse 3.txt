	as many think; for He, in Revelation, is always designated by one of
	His proper titles; though, doubtless, He is the only true High
	Priest, the Angel of the Covenant, standing before the golden altar
	of incense, and there, as Mediator, offering up His people's prayers,
	rendered acceptable before God through the incense of His merit. Here
	the angel acts merely as a ministering spirit ( :-), just as the twenty-four elders have vials full of odors,
	or incense, which are the prayers of saints ( :-), and which they present before the Lamb. How precisely their

	saints who give the angel the incense; nor are their prayers
	identified with the incense; nor do they offer their prayers to him.

	the prayers," so rendering them efficacious as a sweet-smelling
	savor to God. Christ's merits alone can thus incense our
	prayers, though the angelic ministry be employed to attach this
	incense to the prayers. The saints' praying on earth, and the angel's
	incensing in heaven, are simultaneous.
