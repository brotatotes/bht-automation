<p><b>3. another angel</b>—not Christ,
	as many think; for He, in Revelation, is always designated by one of
	His proper titles; though, doubtless, He is the only true High
	Priest, the Angel of the Covenant, standing before the golden altar
	of incense, and there, as Mediator, offering up His people's prayers,
	rendered acceptable before God through the incense of His merit. Here
	the angel acts merely as a <i>ministering spirit</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), just as the twenty-four elders <i>have vials full of odors,</i>
	or incense, <i>which are the prayers of saints</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), and which they present before the Lamb. How precisely their
	ministry, in perfuming the prayers of the saints and offering them on
	the altar of incense, is exercised, we know not, but we do know they
	are not to be prayed TO.
	If we send an offering of tribute to the king, the king's messenger
	is not allowed to appropriate what is due to the king alone.

<p><b>there was given unto him</b>—The
	angel does not provide the incense; it is <i>given to him</i> by
	Christ, whose meritorious obedience and death are the incense,
	rendering the saints' prayers well pleasing to God. It is not the
	saints who give the angel the incense; nor are their prayers
	identified with the incense; nor do they offer their prayers to him.
	Christ alone is the Mediator through whom, and to whom, prayer is to
	be offered. 
	</p>
<p><b>offer it with the
	prayers</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i> "<i>give</i> it TO
	the prayers," so rendering them efficacious as a <i>sweet-smelling
	savor</i> to God. Christ's merits alone can thus <i>incense</i> our
	prayers, though the angelic ministry be employed to attach this
	incense to the prayers. The saints' praying on earth, and the angel's
	incensing in heaven, are simultaneous. 
	</p>
<p><b>all saints</b>—The prayers
	both of the saints in the heavenly rest, and of those militant on
	earth. The martyrs' cry is the foremost, and brings down the ensuing
	judgments. 
	</p>
<p><b>golden altar</b>—antitype
	to the earthly.</p>
