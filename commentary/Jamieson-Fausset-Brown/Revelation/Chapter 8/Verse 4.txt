<p><b>4. the smoke . . . </b><i><b>which
	came</b></i><b> with the prayers . . . ascended up</b>â€”rather, "the
	smoke of the incense FOR
	(or '<i>given</i> TO':
	'given' being understood from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) the prayers of the saints ascended up, out of the angel's
	hand, in the presence of Gods" The angel merely burns the
	incense given him by Christ the High Priest, so that its smoke blends
	with the ascending prayers of the saints. The saints themselves are
	priests; and the angels in this priestly ministration are but <i>their
	fellow servants</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+19:10">Revelation 19:10</span>).</p>
