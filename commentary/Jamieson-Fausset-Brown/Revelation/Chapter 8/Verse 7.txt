<p><b>7.</b> The common feature of the
	first four trumpets is, the judgments under them affect <i>natural
	objects,</i> the accessories of life, the earth, trees, grass, the
	sea, rivers, fountains, the light of the sun, moon, and stars. The
	last three, the <i>woe-trumpets</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), affect men's life with pain, death, and hell. The language
	is evidently drawn from the plagues of Egypt, five or six out of the
	ten exactly corresponding: the <i>hail,</i> the <i>fire</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), the WATER
	<i>turned to blood</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+7:19">Exodus 7:19</span>),
	the <i>darkness</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+10:21">Exodus 10:21</span>),
	the <i>locusts</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+10:12">Exodus 10:12</span>),
	and perhaps the <i>death</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ex+10:12- :">Exodus 10:12- :</span>). Judicial retribution in kind characterizes the inflictions
	of the first four, those elements which had been abused punishing
	their abusers.

<p><b>mingled with</b>—A, B, and
	<i>Vulgate</i> read, <i>Greek,</i> ". . . IN
	blood." So in the case of the second and third vials (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:3">Revelation 16:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+16:4">Revelation 16:4</span>).

<p><b>upon the earth</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"<i>unto</i> the earth." A, B, <i>Vulgate,</i> and <i>Syriac</i>
	add, "And the third of the earth was burnt up." So under
	the third trumpet, the <i>third</i> of the rivers is affected: also,
	under the sixth trumpet, the <i>third</i> part of men are killed. In
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:8">Zechariah 13:8</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="zec+13:9">Zechariah 13:9</span>
	this tripartite division appears, but the proportions reversed, two
	parts killed, only a third preserved. Here, vice versa, two-thirds
	escape, one-third is smitten. The fire was the predominant element.

<p><b>all green grass</b>—no
	longer a third, but <i>all</i> is <i>burnt up.</i></p>
