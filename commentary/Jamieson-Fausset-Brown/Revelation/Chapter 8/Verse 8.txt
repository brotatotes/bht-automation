<p><b>8. as it were</b>—not literally a

<p><b>third part of the sea became
	blood</b>—In the parallel second vial, the <i>whole</i> sea (not
	merely <i>a third</i>) becomes <i>blood.</i> The overthrow of
	Jericho, the type of the Antichristian Babylon, after which Israel,
	under Joshua (the same name as <i>Jesus</i>), victoriously took
	possession of Canaan, the type of Christ's and His people's kingdom,
	is perhaps alluded to in the SEVEN
	<i>trumpets,</i> which end in the overthrow of all Christ's foes, and
	the setting up of His kingdom. On the <i>seventh</i> day, at the
	<i>seventh</i> time, when the <i>seven</i> priests blew the <i>seven</i>
	ram's horn trumpets, the people shouted, and the walls fell flat: and
	then ensued the <i>blood-shedding</i> of the foe. A mountain-like
	fiery mass would not naturally change water into blood; nor would the
	third part of <i>ships</i> be thereby destroyed.</p>
