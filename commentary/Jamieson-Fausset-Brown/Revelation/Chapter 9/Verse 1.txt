<p><b>fall</b>—rather as <i>Greek,</i>
	"fallen." When John saw it, it was not in the act of
	<i>falling,</i> but had <i>fallen</i> already. This is a connecting

	is <i>come down,</i>" c. Compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+12:12- :">Revelation 12:12- :</span>, "How art thou <i>fallen from heaven,</i> Lucifer, son
	of the morning!"
