<p><b>hereafter</b>â€”<i>Greek,</i>
	"after these things." I agree with ALFORD
	and DE BURGH,
	that these <i>locusts from the abyss</i> refer to judgments about to
	fall on the ungodly immediately before Christ's second advent. None
	of the interpretations which regard them as past, are satisfactory.
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+1:2-7">Joel 1:2-7</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:1-11">Joel 2:1-11</span>,
	is strictly parallel and expressly refers (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:1-29.2.11- :">Joel 2:1-29.2.11- :</span>) to THE DAY OF THE
	LORD GREAT AND VERY TERRIBLE:
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:10">Joel 2:10</span> gives the portents
	accompanying the day of the Lord's coming, <i>the earth quaking, the
	heavens trembling, the sun, moon, and stars, withdrawing their
	shining:</i> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:18">Joel 2:18</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:31">Joel 2:31</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:32">Joel 2:32</span>, also point to the
	immediately succeeding deliverance of Jerusalem: compare also, the
	previous last conflict in the valley of Jehoshaphat, and the dwelling
	of God thenceforth in Zion, blessing Judah. DE
	BURGH confines the locust
	judgment to <i>the Israelite land,</i> even as the sealed in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joe+2:32- :">Joel 2:32- :</span> are Israelites: not that there are not others sealed as
	elect in <i>the earth;</i> but that, the judgment being confined to
	<i>Palestine,</i> the sealed of <i>Israel alone</i> needed to be
	expressly excepted from the visitation. Therefore, he translates
	throughout, "the land" (that is, of Israel and Judah),
	instead of "the earth." I incline to agree with him.</p>
