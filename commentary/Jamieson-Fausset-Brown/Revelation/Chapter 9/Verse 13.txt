<p><b>the four horns</b>—A,
	<i>Vulgate</i> (<i>Amiatinus</i> manuscript), <i>Coptic,</i> and
	<i>Syriac</i> omit "four." B and CYPRIAN
	support it. The <i>four</i> horns together gave forth their voice,
	not diverse, but <i>one.</i> God's revelation (for example, the
	Gospel), though in its aspects fourfold (<i>four</i> expressing
	<i>world-wide</i> extension: whence <i>four</i> is the number of the
	Evangelists), still has but one and the same voice. However, from the
	parallelism of this sixth trumpet to the fifth seal (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:9">Revelation 6:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+6:10">Revelation 6:10</span>), the martyrs' cry for
	the avenging of their blood from the altar reaching its consummation
	under the sixth seal and sixth trumpet, I prefer understanding this
	<i>cry from the four corners of the altar</i> to refer to the saints'
	prayerful cry from the four quarters of the world, <i>incensed</i> by
	the angel, and ascending to God from the golden altar of incense, and
	bringing down in consequence fiery judgments. <i>Aleph</i> omits the
	whole clause, "one from the four horns."</p>
