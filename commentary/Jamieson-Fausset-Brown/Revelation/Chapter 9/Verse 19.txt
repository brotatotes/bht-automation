<p><b>19. their</b>—A, B, C and <i>Aleph</i>

<p><b>in their mouth</b>—whence
	<i>issued</i> the <i>fire, smoke, and brimstone</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Many interpreters understand the <i>horsemen</i> to refer
	to the myriads of Turkish cavalry arrayed in scarlet, blue, and
	yellow (<i>fire, hyacinth,</i> and <i>brimstone</i>), the <i>lion-headed
	horses</i> denoting their invincible courage, and <i>the fire</i> and
	<i>brimstone</i> out of their mouths, the gunpowder and artillery
	introduced into Europe about this time, and employed by the Turks;
	the tails, like serpents, having a venomous sting, the false religion
	of Mohammed supplanting Christianity, or, as ELLIOTT
	thinks, the Turkish pachas' horse tails, worn as a symbol of
	authority. (!) All this is very doubtful. Considering the parallelism
	of this sixth trumpet to the sixth seal, the likelihood is that
	events are intended immediately preceding the Lord's coming. "The
	false prophet" (as <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:15">Isaiah 9:15</span>
	proves), or second beast, having the horns of a lamb, but speaking as
	<i>the dragon,</i> who supports by lying miracles the final
	Antichrist, seems to me to be intended. Mohammed, doubtless, is a
	forerunner of him, but not the exhaustive fulfiller of the prophecy
	here: Satan will, probably, towards the end, bring out all the powers
	of hell for the last conflict (see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+9:15- :">Isaiah 9:15- :</span>, on "devils"; compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:1">Revelation 9:1</span>;

	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:18">Revelation 9:18</span>).

<p><b>with them</b>—with the
	serpent heads and their venomous fangs.</p>
