	apostate Christians in the last days, <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, "sorcerers." The heathen who shall have rejected
	the proffered Gospel and clung to their fleshly lusts, and apostate
	Christians who shall have relapsed into the same shall share the same
	terrible judgments. The worship of images was established in the East
	in A.D. 842.
