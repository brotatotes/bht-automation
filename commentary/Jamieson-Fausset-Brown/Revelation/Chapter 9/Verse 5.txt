<p><b>5. they . . . they</b>—The subject
	changes: the first "they" is <i>the locusts;</i> the second
	is the <i>unsealed.</i>
</p>
<p><b>five months</b>—the
	ordinary time in the year during which locusts continue their
	ravages. 
	</p>
<p><b>their torment</b>—the
	torment of the sufferers. This fifth verse and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> cannot refer to an invading army. For an army would <i>kill,</i>
	and not merely <i>torment.</i></p>
