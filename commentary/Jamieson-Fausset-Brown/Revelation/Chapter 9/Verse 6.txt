6. shall desire—Greek,
	"eagerly desire"; set their mind on. 
	shall flee—So B,
	Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic read. But A and Aleph
	read, "fleeth," namely continually. In  :-, which is at a later stage of God's judgments, the ungodly
	seek annihilation, not from the torment of their suffering, but from
	fear of the face of the Lamb before whom they have to stand.
