<p><b>7. prepared unto battle</b>—<i>Greek,</i>
	"made ready unto war." Compare <i>Note,</i> see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, where the resemblance of locusts to horses is traced: the
	plates of a horse armed for battle are an image on a larger scale of
	the outer shell of the locust.

<p><b>crowns</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). ELLIOTT
	explains this of the <i>turbans</i> of Mohammedans. But how could
	turbans be "like gold?" ALFORD
	understands it of the head of the locusts actually ending in a
	crown-shaped fillet which resembled gold in its material. 
	</p>
<p><b>as the faces of men</b>—The
	"as" seems to imply the locusts here do not mean <i>men.</i>
	At the same time they are not natural locusts, for these do not sting
	<i>men</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="re+9:5">Revelation 9:5</span>). They must
	be supernatural.</p>
