<p><b>a servant of Jesus Christ</b>—The
	word here rendered "servant" means "bond-servant,"
	or one subject to the will and wholly at the disposal of another. In
	this sense it is applied to the disciples of Christ at large (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), as in the Old Testament to all the people of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). But as, in addition to this, the prophets and kings of
	Israel were <i>officially</i> "the servants of the Lord"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jos+1:1">Joshua 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+18:1">Psalms 18:1</span>,
	title), the apostles call themselves, in the same official sense,
	"the servants of Christ" (as here, and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:1">Philippians 1:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:1">James 1:1</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+1:1">2 Peter 1:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:1">Judges 1:1</span>), expressing such absolute
	subjection and devotion to the Lord Jesus as they would never have
	yielded to a mere creature. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:1- :">Judges 1:1- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:1- :">Judges 1:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>called to be an apostle</b>—when
	first he "saw the Lord"; the indispensable qualification
	for apostleship. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:1- :">Judges 1:1- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:1- :">Judges 1:1- :</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jdg+1:1- :">Judges 1:1- :</span>).

<p><b>separated unto the</b>—preaching
	of the

<p><b>gospel</b>—neither so late
	as when "the Holy Ghost said, <i>Separate</i> me Barnabas and
	Saul" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2">Acts 13:2</span>), nor so
	early as when "<i>separated</i> from his mother's womb"
	(see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2- :">Acts 13:2- :</span>). He was called at
	one and the same time to the faith and the apostleship of Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:2- :">Acts 13:2- :</span>).

<p><b>of God</b>—that is, the
	Gospel of which God is the glorious Author. (So <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+15:16">Romans 15:16</span>;
