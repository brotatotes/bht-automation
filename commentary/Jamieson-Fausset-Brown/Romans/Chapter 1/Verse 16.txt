<p><b>16. For I am not ashamed of the
	gospel</b>—(The words, "of Christ," which follow here,
	are not found in the oldest and best manuscripts). This language
	implies that it required some courage to bring to "the mistress
	of the world" what "to the Jews was a stumbling-block and
	to the Greeks foolishness" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). But its inherent glory, as God's life-giving message to a
	dying world, so filled his soul, that, like his blessed Master, he
	"despised the shame." 
	</p>
<p><b>for it is the power of God
	unto salvation to every one that believeth</b>—Here and in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> the apostle announces the great theme of his ensuing
	argument; SALVATION, the
	one overwhelming necessity of perishing men; this revealed IN
	THE GOSPEL MESSAGE; and that message so <i>owned and honored
	of God as to carry,</i> in the proclamation of it, GOD'S
	OWN POWER TO SAVE EVERY SOUL THAT EMBRACES IT, Greek and
	Barbarian, wise and unwise alike.</p>
