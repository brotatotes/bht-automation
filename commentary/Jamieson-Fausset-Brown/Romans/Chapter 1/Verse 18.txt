18. who hold—rather, "hold
	down," "hinder," or "keep back." 
	the truth in
	unrighteousness—The apostle, though he began this verse with a
	comprehensive proposition regarding men in general, takes up in the
	end of it only one of the two great divisions of mankind, to whom he
	meant to apply it; thus gently sliding into his argument. But before
	enumerating their actual iniquities, he goes back to the origin of
	them all, their stifling the light which still remained to them. As
	darkness overspreads the mind, so impotence takes possession of the
	heart, when the "still small voice" of conscience is first
	disregarded, next thwarted, and then systematically deadened. Thus
	"the truth" which God left with and in men, instead of
	having free scope and developing itself, as it otherwise would, was
	obstructed (compare Matthew 6:22;
	Matthew 6:23; Ephesians 4:17;
	Ephesians 4:18).
