<p><b>20. For the invisible things of him
	from</b>—or "since" 
	</p>
<p><b>the creation of the world are
	clearly seen</b>—the mind brightly beholding what the eye cannot
	discern. 
	</p>
<p><b>being understood by the
	things that are made</b>—Thus, the outward creation is not the
	<i>parent</i> but the <i>interpreter</i> of our faith in God. That
	faith has its primary sources within our own breast (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); but it becomes <i>an intelligible and articulate
	conviction</i> only through what we observe around us ("by the
	things which are made," <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). And thus are the inner and the outer revelation of God the
	complement of each other, making up between them one universal and
	immovable conviction <i>that God is.</i> (With this striking
	apostolic statement agree the latest conclusions of the most profound
	speculative students of Theism). 
	</p>
<p><i><b>even</b></i><b> his
	eternal power and Godhead</b>—both that there <i>is</i> an Eternal
	Power, and that this is not a mere blind force, or pantheistic
	"spirit of nature," but the power of a living <i>Godhead.</i>
</p>
<p><b>so that they are without
	excuse</b>—all their degeneracy being a voluntary departure from
	truth thus brightly revealed to the unsophisticated spirit.</p>
