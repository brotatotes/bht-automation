<p><b>24. Wherefore God also</b>—in
	righteous retribution. 
	</p>
<p><b>gave them up</b>—This
	divine abandonment of men is here strikingly traced in three
	successive stages, at each of which the same word is used (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:24">Romans 1:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:26">Romans 1:26</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+1:26- :">Romans 1:26- :</span>, where the word is rendered "gave over"). "As
	they deserted God, God in turn deserted them; not giving them divine
	(that is, supernatural) laws, and suffering them to corrupt those
	which were human; not sending them prophets, and allowing the
	philosophers to run into absurdities. He let them do what they
	pleased, even what was in the last degree vile, that those who had
	not honored God, might dishonor themselves" [GROTIUS].</p>
