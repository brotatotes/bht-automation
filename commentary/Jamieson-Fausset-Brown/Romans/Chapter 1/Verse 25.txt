<p><b>25. Who changed the truth of God
	into a lie</b>—that is, the truth concerning God into idol
	falsehood. 
	</p>
<p><b>and worshipped and served the
	creature more than the Creator</b>—Professing merely to worship the
	Creator <i>by means</i> of the creature, they soon came to lose sight
	of the Creator <i>in</i> the creature. How aggravated is the guilt of
	the Church of Rome, which, under the same flimsy pretext, does
	shamelessly what the heathen are here condemned for doing, and with
	light which the heathen never had! 
	</p>
<p><b>who is blessed for ever!
	Amen</b>—By this doxology the apostle instinctively relieves the
	horror which the penning of such things excited within his breast; an
	example to such as are called to expose like dishonor done to the
	blessed God.</p>
