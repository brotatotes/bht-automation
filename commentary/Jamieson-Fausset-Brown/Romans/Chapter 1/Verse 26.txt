	But observe how vice is here seen consuming and exhausting itself.
	When the passions, scourged by violent and continued indulgence in
	natural vices, became impotent to yield the craved enjoyment,
	resort was had to artificial stimulants by the practice of unnatural
	and monstrous vices. How early these were in full career, in the
	history of the world, the case of Sodom affectingly shows and because
	of such abominations, centuries after that, the land of Canaan "spued
	out" its old inhabitants. Long before this chapter was penned,
	the Lesbians and others throughout refined Greece had been
	luxuriating in such debasements; and as for the Romans, TACITUS,
	speaking of the emperor Tiberius, tells us that new words had then to
	be coined to express the newly invented stimulants to jaded passion.
	No wonder that, thus sick and dying as was this poor humanity of ours
	under the highest earthly culture, its many-voiced cry for the balm
	in Gilead, and the Physician there, "Come over and help us,"
	pierced the hearts of the missionaries of the Cross, and made them
	"not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ!"
