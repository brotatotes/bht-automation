3, 4. Concerning his Son Jesus
	Christ our Lord—the grand burden of this "Gospel of God."
	made of the seed of David—as,
	according to "the holy scriptures," He behooved to be. (See
	on  :-). 
	according to the flesh—that
	is, in His human nature (compare Romans 9:5;
	John 1:14); implying, of course,
	that He had another nature, of which the apostle immediately
	proceeds to speak.
