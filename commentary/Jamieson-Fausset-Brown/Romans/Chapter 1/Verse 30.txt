<p><b>30. haters of God</b>â€”The word
	usually signifies "God-hated," which some here prefer, in
	the sense of "abhorred of the Lord"; expressing the
	detestableness of their character in His sight (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+22:14">Proverbs 22:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+73:20">Psalms 73:20</span>). But the active sense
	of the word, adopted in our version and by the majority of
	expositors, though rarer, agrees perhaps better with the context.</p>
