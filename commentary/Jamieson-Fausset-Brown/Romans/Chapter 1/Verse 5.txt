<p><b>5. By whom</b>—as the ordained
	channel. 
	</p>
<p><b>we have received grace</b>—the
	whole "grace that bringeth salvation" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and apostleship</b>—for the
	publication of that "grace," and the organization of as
	many as receive it into churches of visible discipleship. (We prefer
	thus taking them as two distinct things, and not, with some good
	interpreters, as one—"the grace of apostleship"). 
	</p>
<p><b>for obedience to the
	faith</b>—rather, "for the obedience of faith"—that is,
	in order to men's yielding themselves to the belief of God's saving
	message, which is the highest of all obedience. 
	</p>
<p><b>for his name</b>—that He
	might be glorified.</p>
