<p><b>from God our Father, and the
	Lord Jesus Christ</b>—"Nothing speaks more decisively for the
	divinity of Christ than these juxtapositions of Christ with the
	eternal God, which run through the whole language of Scripture, and
	the derivation of purely divine influences from Him also. The name of
	no man can be placed by the side of the Almighty. He only, in whom
	the Word of the Father who is Himself God became flesh, may be named
	beside Him for men are commanded to honor Him even as they honor the
	Father (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+5:23">John 5:23</span>)"
