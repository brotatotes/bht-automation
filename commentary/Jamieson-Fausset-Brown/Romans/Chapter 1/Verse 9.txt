<p><b>9. For God . . . whom I serve</b>—the
	word denotes religious service. 
	</p>
<p><b>with my spirit</b>—from my
	inmost soul. 
	</p>
<p><b>in the gospel of his Son</b>—to
	which Paul's whole religious life and official activity were
	consecrated. 
	</p>
<p><b>is my witness, that without
	ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers</b>—so for the
	Ephesians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:15">Ephesians 1:15</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:16">Ephesians 1:16</span>);
	so for the Philippians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:3">Philippians 1:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+1:4">Philippians 1:4</span>); so for the Colossians
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:3">Colossians 1:3</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="col+1:4">Colossians 1:4</span>);
	so for the Thessalonians (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:2">1 Thessalonians 1:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+1:3">1 Thessalonians 1:3</span>). What catholic love,
	what all-absorbing spirituality, what impassioned devotion to the
	glory of Christ among men!</p>
