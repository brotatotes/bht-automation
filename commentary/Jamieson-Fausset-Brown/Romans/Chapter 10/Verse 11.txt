<p><b>11-13. For the scripture saith</b>—in
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16">Isaiah 28:16</span>, a glorious
	Messianic passage. 
	</p>
<p><b>Whosoever believeth on him
	shall not be ashamed</b>—Here, as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+28:16- :">Isaiah 28:16- :</span>, the quotation is from the <i>Septuagint,</i> which renders
	those words of the original, "shall not make haste" (that
	is, fly for escape, as from conscious danger), "shall not be put
	to shame," which comes to the same thing.</p>
