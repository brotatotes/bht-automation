<p><b>How beautiful are the feet of
	them that preach the gospel of peace,</b> &amp;c.—The whole chapter
	of Isaiah from which this is taken, and the three that follow, are so
	richly Messianic, that there can be no doubt "the glad tidings"
	there spoken of announce a more glorious release than of Judah from
	the Babylonish captivity, and the very feet of its preachers are
	called "beautiful" for the sake of their message.</p>
