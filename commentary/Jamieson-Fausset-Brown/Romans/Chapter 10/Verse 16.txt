<p><b>16, 17. But they have not all obeyed
	the gospel</b>—that is, the Scripture hath prepared us to expect
	this sad result.

<p><b>For Esaias saith, Lord, who
	hath believed our report?</b>—that is,"Where shall one find a
	believer?" The prophet speaks as if next to none would believe:
	The apostle softens this into "They have not all believed."</p>
