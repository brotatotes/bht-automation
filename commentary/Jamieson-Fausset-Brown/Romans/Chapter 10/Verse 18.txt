18. But I say, Have they not
	heard?—"Did they not hear?" Can Israel, through any
	region of his dispersion, plead ignorance of these glad tidings? 
	Yes, verily, their sound
	went—"their voice went out" 
	into all the earth, and their
	words unto the end of the world—These beautiful words are from
	Psalms 19:4. Whether the apostle
	quoted them as in their primary intention applicable to his subject
	(as OLSHAUSEN, ALFORD,
	c.), or only "used scriptural language to express his own ideas,
	as is done involuntarily almost by every preacher in every sermon"
	[HODGE], expositors are
	not agreed. But though the latter may seem the more natural since
	"the rising of the Sun of righteousness upon the world"
	(Malachi 4:2), "the Dayspring
	from on high visiting us, giving light to them that sat in darkness,
	and guiding our feet into the way of peace" (Luke 1:78
Luke 1:79), must have been
	familiar and delightful to the apostle's ear, we cannot doubt that
	the irradiation of the world with the beams of a better Sun by the
	universal diffusion of the Gospel of Christ, must have a mode of
	speaking quite natural, and to him scarcely figurative.
