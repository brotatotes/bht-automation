	know?—know, from their own Scriptures, of God's intention to
	bring in the Gentiles? 
	First—that is First in
	the prophetic line [DE
	WETTE]. 
	Moses saith, &c.—"I
	will provoke you to jealousy ('against') [them that are] not a
	nation, and against a nation without understanding will I anger you"
	(Deuteronomy 32:21). In this verse God
	warns His ancient people that because they had (that is, in
	aftertimes would) moved Him to jealousy with their "no-gods,"
	and provoked Him to anger with their vanities, He in requital would
	move them to jealousy by receiving into His favor a "no-people,"
	and provoke them to anger by adopting a nation void of understanding.
