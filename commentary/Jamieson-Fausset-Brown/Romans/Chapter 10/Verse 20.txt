<p><b>20. But Esaias is very bold, and
	saith</b>—that is, is still plainer, and goes even the length of
	saying. 
	</p>
<p><b>I was found of them that
	sought me not</b>—until I sought them. 
	</p>
<p><b>I was made</b>—"became"
	</p>
<p><b>manifest unto them that asked
	not after me</b>—until the invitation from Me came to them. That
	the calling of the Gentiles was meant by these words of the prophet
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+65:1">Isaiah 65:1</span>) is manifest from
	what immediately follows, "I said, Behold Me, behold Me, unto a
	nation that was not called by My name."</p>
