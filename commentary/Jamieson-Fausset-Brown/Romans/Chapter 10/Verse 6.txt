6. But the—justifying 
	righteousness which is of
	faith speaketh on this wise—"speaketh thus"—its
	language or import is to this effect (quoting in substance Deuteronomy 30:13;
	Deuteronomy 30:14). 
	Say not in thine heart, Who
	shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down, c.—that
	is, "Ye have not to sigh over the impossibility of attaining to
	justification as if one should say, oh! if I could but get someone to
	mount up to heaven and fetch me down Christ, there might be some
	hope, but since that cannot be, mine is a desperate case."
