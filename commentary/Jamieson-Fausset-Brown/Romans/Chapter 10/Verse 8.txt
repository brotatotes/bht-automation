<p><b>8. But what saith it? It
	saith</b>—continuing the quotation from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>The word is nigh thee</b>—easily
	accessible. 
	</p>
<p><b>in thy mouth</b>—when thou
	confessest Him. 
	</p>
<p><b>and in thine heart</b>—when
	thou believest on Him. Though it is of <i>the law</i> which Moses
	more immediately speaks in the passage quoted, yet it is of the law
	as Israel shall be brought to look upon it when the Lord their God
	shall circumcise their heart "to love the Lord their God with
	all their heart" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:6">Romans 10:6</span>);
	and thus, in applying it, the apostle (as OLSHAUSEN
	truly observes) is not merely appropriating the language of Moses,
	but keeping in the line of his deeper thought. 
	</p>
<p><b>that is, the word of faith,
	which we preach</b>—that is, the word which men have to believe for
	salvation (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+4:6">1 Timothy 4:6</span>).</p>
