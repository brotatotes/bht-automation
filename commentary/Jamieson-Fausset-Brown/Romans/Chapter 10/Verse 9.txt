<p><b>9. That if thou shalt,</b> c.—So
	understanding the words, the apostle is here giving the language of
	the true method of justification and this sense we prefer (with
	CALVIN, BEZA,
	FERME, LOCKE,
	JOWETT). But able
	interpreters render the words, "For," or "Because if
	thou shalt," c. [<i>Vulgate,</i> LUTHER,
	DE WETTE,
	STUART, PHILIPPI,
	ALFORD, <i>Revised
	Version</i>]. In this case, these are the apostle's own remarks,
	confirming the foregoing statements as to the simplicity of the
	gospel method of salvation. 
	</p>
<p><b>confess with thy mouth the
	Lord Jesus</b>—that is, probably, "If thou shalt confess Jesus
	[to be] the Lord," which is the proper manifestation or evidence
	of faith (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:32">Matthew 10:32</span> <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:15">1 John 4:15</span>).
	This is put first merely to correspond with the foregoing
	quotation—"in thy mouth and in thine heart." So in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+4:15- :">1 John 4:15- :</span> the "calling of believers" is put before their
	"election," as that which is first "made sure,"
	although in point of time it comes after it. 
	</p>
<p><b>and shalt believe in thine
	heart that God hath raised</b>—"that God raised" 
	</p>
<p><b>him from the dead,</b>
	&amp;c.—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:25">Romans 4:25</span>). In
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+10:10">Romans 10:10</span> the two things are
	placed in their natural order.</p>
