<p><b>1. I say then, Hath</b>—"Did"
	</p>
<p><b>God cast away his people? God
	forbid</b>—Our Lord did indeed announce that "the kingdom of
	God should be <i>taken from</i> Israel" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); and when asked by the Eleven, after His resurrection, if
	He would at that time "<i>restore</i> the kingdom to Israel,"
	His reply is a virtual admission that Israel was in some sense
	already out of covenant (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+1:9">Acts 1:9</span>).
	Yet here the apostle teaches that, in two respects, Israel was <i>not</i>
	"cast away"; First, Not <i>totally;</i> Second, Not
	<i>finally.</i> FIRST,
	Israel is not <i>wholly</i> cast away.

<p><b>for I also am an
	Israelite</b>—See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:5">Philippians 3:5</span>, and
	so a living witness to the contrary.

<p><b>of the tribe of Benjamin</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:5">Philippians 3:5</span>), that tribe which, on
	the revolt of the ten tribes, constituted, with Judah, the one
	faithful kingdom of God (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:5- :">Philippians 3:5- :</span>), and after the captivity was, along with Judah, the kernel
	of the Jewish nation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ezr+4:1">Ezra 4:1</span>;
