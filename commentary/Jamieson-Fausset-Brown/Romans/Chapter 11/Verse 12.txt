	if their trespass," or "false step" 
	be the riches of the—Gentile
	world—as being the

	small a remnant.

	on Romans 11:1); that is, "If
	an event so untoward as Israel's fall was the occasion of such
	unspeakable good to the Gentile world, of how much greater good may
	we expect an event so blessed as their full recovery to be
	productive?"
