<p><b>16. For</b>—"But" 
	</p>
<p><b>if the first-fruit be holy,
	the lump is also holy; and if the root . . . so the branches</b>—The
	Israelites were required to offer to God the first-fruits of the
	earth—both in their raw state, in a sheaf of newly reaped grain
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+23:10">Leviticus 23:10</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+23:11">Leviticus 23:11</span>),
	and in their prepared state, made into cakes of dough (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="le+23:11- :">Leviticus 23:11- :</span>) —by which the whole produce of that season was
	regarded as <i>hallowed.</i> It is probable that the latter of these
	offerings is here intended, as to it the word "lump" best
	applies; and the argument of the apostle is, that as the separation
	unto God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from the rest of mankind, as
	the parent stem of their race, was as real an offering of
	first-fruits as that which hallowed the produce of the earth, so, in
	the divine estimation, it was as real a separation of the mass or
	"lump" of that nation in all time to God. The figure of the
	"root" and its "branches" is of like import—the
	consecration of the one of them extending to the other.</p>
