18. Boast not against the—rejected
	branches. But if thou—"do"
	boast—remember that 
	thou bearest not—"it
	is not thou that bearest" 
	the root, but the root
	thee—"If the branches may not boast over the root that
	bears them, then may not the Gentile boast over the seed of Abraham;
	for what is thy standing, O Gentile, in relation to Israel, but that
	of a branch in relation to the root? From Israel hath come all that
	thou art and hast in the family of God; for "salvation is of the
	Jews" (John 4:22).
