2-4. God hath—"did" 
	not cast away his people—that
	is, wholly
which he foreknew—On
	the word "foreknew," see on  :-. 
	Wot—that is, "Know"
	ye not that the scripture
	saith of—literally, "in," that is, in the section
	which relates to 
	Elias? how he maketh
	intercession—"pleadeth" 
	against Israel—(The
	word "saying," which follows, as also the particle "and"
	before "digged down," should be omitted, as without
	manuscript authority).
