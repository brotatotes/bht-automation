<p><b>22, 23. Behold therefore the
	goodness and severity of God: on them that fell, severity</b>—in
	rejecting the chosen seed. 
	</p>
<p><b>but toward thee,
	goodness</b>—"God's goodness" is the true reading, that
	is, His sovereign goodness in admitting thee to a covenant standing
	who before wert a "stranger to the covenants of promise"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+2:12-20">Ephesians 2:12-20</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>if thou continue in his
	goodness</b>—in believing dependence on that pure goodness which
	made thee what thou art.</p>
