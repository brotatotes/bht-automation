23. And they also—"Yea,
	and they" 
	if they abide not still in
	unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in
	again—This appeal to the power of God to effect the
	recovery of His ancient people implies the vast difficulty of
	it—which all who have ever labored for the conversion of the Jews
	are made depressingly to feel. That intelligent expositors should
	think that this was meant of individual Jews, reintroduced
	from time to time into the family of God on their believing on the
	Lord Jesus, is surprising; and yet those who deny the national
	recovery of Israel must and do so interpret the apostle. But this is
	to confound the two things which the apostle carefully distinguishes.
	Individual Jews have been at all times admissible, and have been
	admitted, to the Church through the gate of faith in the Lord Jesus.
	This is the "remnant, even at this present time,
	according to the election of grace," of which the apostle, in
	the first part of the chapter, had cited himself as one. But here he
	manifestly speaks of something not then existing, but to be
	looked forward to as a great future event in the economy of God, the
	reingrafting of the nation as such, when they "abide not
	in unbelief." And though this is here spoken of merely as a
	supposition (if their unbelief shall cease)—in order to set it over
	against the other supposition, of what will happen to the Gentiles if
	they shall not abide in the faith—the supposition is turned into an
	explicit prediction in the verses following.
