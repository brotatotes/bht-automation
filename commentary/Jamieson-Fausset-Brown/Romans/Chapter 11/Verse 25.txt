<p><b>25. For I would not . . . that ye
	should be ignorant of this mystery</b>—The word "mystery,"
	so often used by our apostle, does not mean (as with us) something
	incomprehensible, but "something before kept secret, either
	wholly or for the most part, and now only fully disclosed"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:25">Romans 16:25</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+2:7-10">1 Corinthians 2:7-10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:9">Ephesians 1:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:10">Ephesians 1:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:3-6">Ephesians 3:3-6</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:9">Ephesians 3:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+3:10">Ephesians 3:10</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>lest ye should be wise in
	your own conceits</b>—as if ye alone were in all time coming to be
	the family of God. 
	</p>
<p><b>that blindness</b>—"hardness"
	</p>
<p><b>in part is happened to</b>—"hath
	come upon" 
	</p>
<p><b>Israel</b>—that is, hath
	come partially, or upon a portion of Israel. 
	</p>
<p><b>until the fulness of the
	Gentiles be</b>—"have" 
	</p>
<p><b>come in</b>—that is, not
	the general conversion of the world to Christ, as many take it; for
	this would seem to contradict the latter part of this chapter, and
	throw the national recovery of Israel too far into the future:
	besides, in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:15">Romans 11:15</span>, the
	apostle seems to speak of the receiving of Israel, not as following,
	but as contributing largely to bring about the general conversion of
	the world—but, "until the Gentiles have had their <i>full</i>
	time of the visible Church all to themselves while the Jews are out,
	which the Jews had till the Gentiles were brought in." (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+11:15- :">Romans 11:15- :</span>).</p>
