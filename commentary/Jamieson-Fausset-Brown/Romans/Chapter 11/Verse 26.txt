<p><b>26, 27. And so all Israel shall be
	saved</b>—To understand this great statement, as some still do,
	merely of such a gradual inbringing of <i>individual</i> Jews, that
	there shall at length remain none in unbelief, is to do manifest
	violence both to it and to the whole context. It can only mean the
	ultimate ingathering of Israel as a <i>nation,</i> in contrast with
	the present "remnant." (So THOLUCK,
	MEYER, DE
	WETTE, PHILIPPI,
	ALFORD, HODGE).
	Three confirmations of this now follow: two from the prophets, and a
	third from the Abrahamic covenant itself. <i>First,</i> as it is
	written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and 
	</p>
<p><b>shall</b>—or, according to
	what seems the true reading, without the "and"—"He
	shall" 
	</p>
<p><b>turn away ungodliness from
	Jacob</b>—The apostle, having drawn his illustrations of man's
	<i>sinfulness</i> chiefly from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+14:1-7">Psalms 14:1-7</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:1-21">Isaiah 59:1-21</span>, now seems to
	combine the language of the same two places regarding Israel's
	<i>salvation</i> from it [BENGEL].
	In the one place the Psalmist longs to see the "salvation of
	Israel coming <i>out of Zion</i>" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:1-23.59.21- :">Isaiah 59:1-23.59.21- :</span>); in the other, the prophet announces that "the
	Redeemer (or, 'Deliverer') shall come <i>to</i> (or '<i>for</i>')
	Zion" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+59:20">Isaiah 59:20</span>). But as
	all the glorious manifestations of Israel's God were regarded as
	issuing out of Zion, as the seat of His manifested glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+20:2">Psalms 20:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+110:2">Psalms 110:2</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="isa+31:9">Isaiah 31:9</span>),
	the turn which the apostle gives to the words merely adds to them
	that familiar idea. And whereas the prophet announces that He "shall
	come <i>to</i> (or, '<i>for</i>') them that turn from transgression
	in Jacob," while the apostle makes Him say that He shall come
	"to turn away ungodliness <i>from</i> Jacob," this is taken
	from the <i>Septuagint</i> version, and seems to indicate a different
	reading of the original text. The sense, however, is substantially
	the same in both. <i>Second,</i></p>
