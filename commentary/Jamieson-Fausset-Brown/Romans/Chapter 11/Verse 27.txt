<p><b>this is my covenant with

	believe that there are no predictions regarding the literal Israel in
	the Old Testament, that stretch beyond the end of the Jewish economy,
	are obliged to view these quotations by the apostle as mere
	adaptations of Old Testament language to express his own predictions
