	they are enemies for your sakes—that is, they are regarded and
	treated as enemies (in a state of exclusion through unbelief, from
	the family of God) for the benefit of you Gentiles; in the sense of
	Romans 11:11; Romans 11:15.
	but as touching, the
	election—of Abraham and his seed. 
	they are beloved—even
	in their state of exclusion for the fathers' sakes.
