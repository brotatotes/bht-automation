<p><b>32. For God hath concluded them all
	in unbelief</b>—"hath shut them all up to unbelief" 
	</p>
<p><b>that he might have mercy upon
	all</b>—that is, those "all" of whom he had been
	discoursing; the Gentiles first, and after them the Jews [FRITZSCHE,
	THOLUCK, OLSHAUSEN,
	DE WETTE,
	PHILIPPI, STUART,
	HODGE]. Certainly it is
	not "all mankind individually" [MEYER,
	ALFORD]; for the apostle
	is not here dealing with individuals, but with those great divisions
	of mankind, Jew and Gentile. And what he here says is that God's
	purpose was to shut each of these divisions of men to the experience
	first of an humbled, condemned state, without Christ, and then to the
	experience of His mercy in Christ.</p>
