33. Oh, the depth, c.—The
	apostle now yields himself up to the admiring contemplation of the
	grandeur of that divine plan which he had sketched out. 
	of the riches both of the
	wisdom and knowledge of God—Many able expositors render this,
	"of the riches and wisdom and knowledge," &c. [ERASMUS,
	GROTIUS, BENGEL,
	MEYER, DE
	WETTE, THOLUCK,
	OLSHAUSEN, FRITZSCHE,
	PHILIPPI, ALFORD,
	Revised Version]. The words will certainly bear this sense,
	"the depth of God's riches." But "the riches of God"
	is a much rarer expression with our apostle than the riches of this
	or that perfection of God and the words immediately following limit
	our attention to the unsearchableness of God's "judgments,"
	which probably means His decrees or plans ( :-), and of "His ways," or the method by
	which He carries these into effect. (So LUTHER,
	CALVIN, BEZA,
	HODGE, c.). Besides, all
	that follows to the end of the chapter seems to show that while the
	Grace of God to guilty men in Christ Jesus is presupposed to
	be the whole theme of this chapter, that which called forth the
	special admiration of the apostle, after sketching at some length the
	divine purposes and methods in the bestowment of this grace, was "the
	depth of the riches of God's wisdom and knowledge" in
	these purposes and methods. The "knowledge," then, points
	probably to the vast sweep of divine comprehension herein displayed
	the "wisdom" to that fitness to accomplish the ends
	intended, which is stamped on all this procedure.
