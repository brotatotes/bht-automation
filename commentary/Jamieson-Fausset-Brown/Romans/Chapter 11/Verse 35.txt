35. Or who hath first given to him,
	and it shall be recompensed to him—"and shall have
	recompense made to him" 
	again—see Job 35:7;
	Job 41:11. These questions, it
	will thus be seen, are just quotations from the Old Testament, as if
	to show how familiar to God's ancient people was the great truth
	which the apostle himself had just uttered, that God's plans and
	methods in the dispensation of His Grace have a reach of
	comprehension and wisdom stamped upon them which finite mortals
	cannot fathom, much less could ever have imagined, before they were
	disclosed.
