5. Even so at this present time—"in
	this present season"; this period of Israel's rejection. (See  :-, Greek). 
	there is—"there
	obtains," or "hath remained" 
	a remnant according to the
	election of grace—"As in Elijah's time the apostasy of
	Israel was not so universal as it seemed to be, and as he in his
	despondency concluded it to be, so now, the rejection of Christ by
	Israel is not so appalling in extent as one would be apt to think:
	There is now, as there was then, a faithful remnant; not however of
	persons naturally better than the unbelieving mass, but of persons
	graciously chosen to salvation." (See 1 Corinthians 4:7;
	2 Thessalonians 2:13). This establishes our
	view of the argument on Election in 2 Thessalonians 2:13- :, as not being an election of Gentiles in the place of
	Jews, and merely to religious advantages, but a sovereign choice of
	some of Israel itself, from among others, to believe and be saved.
