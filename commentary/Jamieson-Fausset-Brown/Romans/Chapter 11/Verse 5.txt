	Israel is not so appalling in extent as one would be apt to think:
	There is now, as there was then, a faithful remnant; not however of
	persons naturally better than the unbelieving mass, but of persons
	graciously chosen to salvation." (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+4:7">1 Corinthians 4:7</span>;

	Jews, and merely to religious advantages, but a sovereign choice of
	some of Israel itself, from among others, to believe and be saved.
