<p><b>6. And,</b> c.—better, "Now
	if it (the election) be by grace, it is no more of works for [then]

	authority of ancient manuscripts against this latter clause, as
	superfluous and not originally in the text, though strong, is not
	sufficient, we think, to justify its exclusion. Such seeming
	redundancies are not unusual with our apostle). The general position
	here laid down is of vital importance: That there are but two
	possible sources of salvation—men's works, and God's grace and that
	these are so essentially distinct and opposite, that salvation cannot
	be of any combination or mixture of both, but must be wholly either
	of the one or of the other. (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, <i>Note</i> 3.)</p>
