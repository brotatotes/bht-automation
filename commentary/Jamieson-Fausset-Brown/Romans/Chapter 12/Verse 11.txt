<p><b>11. not slothful in business</b>—The
	word rendered "business" means "zeal,"
	"diligence," "purpose"; denoting the energy of
	action. 
	</p>
<p><b>serving the Lord</b>—that
	is, the Lord Jesus (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>). Another reading—"serving the time," or "the
	occasion"—which differs in form but very slightly from the
	received reading, has been adopted by good critics [LUTHER,
	OLSHAUSEN, FRITZSCHE,
	MEYER]. But as manuscript
	authority is decidedly against it, so is internal evidence; and
	comparatively few favor it. Nor is the sense which it yields a very
	Christian one.</p>
