12. Rejoicing, c.â€”Here it is
	more lively to retain the order and the verbs of the original: "In
	hope, rejoicing in tribulation, enduring; in prayer, persevering."
	Each of these exercises helps the other. If our "hope" of
	glory is so assured that it is a rejoicing hope, we shall find the
	spirit of "endurance in tribulation" natural and easy; but
	since it is "prayer" which strengthens the faith that
	begets hope and lifts it up into an assured and joyful expectancy,
	and since our patience in tribulation is fed by this, it will be seen
	that all depends on our "perseverance in prayer."
