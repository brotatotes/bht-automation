<p><b>with them that weep</b>—What
	a beautiful spirit of sympathy with the joys and sorrows of others is
	here inculcated! But it is only one charming phase of the unselfish
	character which belongs to all living Christianity. What a world will
	ours be when this shall become its reigning spirit! Of the two,
	however, it is more easy to sympathize with another's sorrows than
	his joys, because in the one case he <i>needs</i> us; in the other
	not. But just for this reason the latter is the more disinterested,
	and so the nobler.</p>
