<p><b>16. Be</b>—"Being" 
	</p>
<p><b>of the same mind one toward
	another</b>—The feeling of the common bond which binds all
	Christians to each other, whatever diversity of station, cultivation,
	temperament, or gifts may obtain among them, is the thing here
	enjoined. This is next taken up in detail. 
	</p>
<p><b>Mind not</b>—"not
	minding" 
	</p>
<p><b>high things</b>—that is,
	Cherish not ambitious or aspiring purposes and desires. As this
	springs from selfish severance of our own interests and objects from
	those of our brethren, so it is quite incompatible with the spirit
	inculcated in the preceding clause. 
	</p>
<p><b>but
	condescend</b>—"condescending" 
	</p>
<p><b>to men of low estate</b>—or
	(as some render the words), "inclining unto the things that be
	lowly." But we prefer the former. 
	</p>
<p><b>Be not wise in your own
	conceits</b>—This is just the application of the caution against
	high-mindedness to the estimate we form of our own mental character.</p>
