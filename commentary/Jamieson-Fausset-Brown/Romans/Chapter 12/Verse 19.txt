<p><b>but rather give place unto
	wrath</b>—This is usually taken to mean, "but give room or
	space for wrath to spend itself." But as the context shows that
	the injunction is to leave vengeance to God, "wrath" here
	seems to mean, not the <i>offense,</i> which we are tempted to
	avenge, but the <i>avenging wrath</i> of God (see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+12:1- :">Romans 12:1- :</span>), which we are enjoined to await, or give room for. (So the
	best interpreters).</p>
