<p><b>2. And be ye not conformed to this

<p><b>but be ye transformed</b>—or,
	"transfigured" (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+1:4- :">Galatians 1:4- :</span>; and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>, <i>Greek</i>).
	</p>
<p><b>by the renewing of your
	mind</b>—not by a mere outward disconformity to the ungodly world,
	many of whose actions in themselves may be virtuous and praiseworthy;
	but by such an inward spiritual transformation as makes the whole
	life new—new in its motives and ends, even where the actions differ
	in nothing from those of the world—new, considered as a whole, and
	in such a sense as to be wholly unattainable save through the
	constraining power of the love of Christ. 
	</p>
<p><b>that ye may prove</b>—that
	is, experimentally. (On the word "experience" see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+3:18- :">2 Corinthians 3:18- :</span>, and compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:10">1 Thessalonians 5:10</span>,
	where the sentiment is the same). 
	</p>
<p><b>what is that</b>—"the"
	</p>
<p><b>good and
	acceptable</b>—"well-pleasing" 
	</p>
<p><b>and perfect, will of God</b>—We
	prefer this rendering (with CALVIN)
	to that which many able critics [THOLUCK,
	MEYER, DE
	WETTE, FRITZSCHE,
	PHILIPPI, ALFORD,
	HODGE] adopt—"that
	ye may prove," or "discern the will of God, [even] what is
	good, and acceptable, and perfect." God's will is "<i>good,</i>"
	as it demands only what is essentially and unchangeably good (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1th+5:10- :">1 Thessalonians 5:10- :</span>); it is "<i>well pleasing,</i>" in contrast with
	all that is arbitrary, as demanding only what God has eternal
	complacency in (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+6:8">Micah 6:8</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+9:24">Jeremiah 9:24</span>); and it is "<i>perfect,</i>"
	as it required nothing else than the perfection of God's reasonable
	creature, who, in proportion as he attains to it, reflects God's own
	perfection. Such then is the great general duty of the
	redeemed—SELF-CONSECRATION,
	in our whole spirit and soul and body to Him who hath called us into
	the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ. Next follow specific duties,
	chiefly social; beginning with Humility, the chiefest of all the
	graces—but here with special reference to spiritual gifts.</p>
