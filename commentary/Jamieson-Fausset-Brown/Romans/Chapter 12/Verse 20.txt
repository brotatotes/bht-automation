<p><b>20. if thine enemy hunger,</b>
	c.—This is taken from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+25:21">Proverbs 25:21</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+25:22">Proverbs 25:22</span>, which without doubt
	supplied the basis of those lofty precepts on that subject which form
	the culminating point of the Sermon on the Mount.

<p><b>in so doing thou shalt heap
	coals of fire on his head</b>—As the heaping of "coals of
	fire" is in the Old Testament the figurative expression of
	divine vengeance (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+140:10">Psalms 140:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+11:6">Psalms 11:6</span>, &amp;c.), the true
	sense of these words seems to be, "That will be the most
	effectual vengeance—a vengeance under which he will be fain to
	bend" (So ALFORD,
	HODGE, &amp;c.). <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+11:6- :">Psalms 11:6- :</span> confirms this.</p>
