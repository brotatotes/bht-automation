<p><b>3. For I say</b>—authoritatively 
	</p>
<p><b>through the grace given unto
	me</b>—as an apostle of Jesus Christ; thus exemplifying his own
	precept by modestly falling back on that office which both warranted
	and required such plainness towards all classes. 
	</p>
<p><b>to every man that is among
	you, not to think,</b> &amp;c.—It is impossible to convey in good
	English the emphatic play, so to speak, which each word here has upon
	another: "not to be high-minded above what he ought to be
	minded, but so to be minded as to be sober-minded" [CALVIN,
	ALFORD]. This is merely a
	strong way of characterizing all undue self-elevation. 
	</p>
<p><b>according as God hath dealt
	to every man the measure of faith</b>—Faith is here viewed as the
	inlet to all the other graces, and so, as the receptive faculty of
	the renewed soul—that is, "as God hath given to each his
	particular capacity to take in the gifts and graces which He designs
	for the general good."</p>
