	to every man that is among
	you, not to think, &c.—It is impossible to convey in good
	English the emphatic play, so to speak, which each word here has upon

	inlet to all the other graces, and so, as the receptive faculty of
	the renewed soul—that is, "as God hath given to each his
	particular capacity to take in the gifts and graces which He designs
	for the general good."
