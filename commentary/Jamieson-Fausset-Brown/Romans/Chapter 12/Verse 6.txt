6-8. Having then gifts differing
	according to the grace given to us—Here, let it be observed,
	all the gifts of believers alike are viewed as communications of mere
	grace.
whether—we have the
	gift of 
	prophecy—that is, of
	inspired teaching (as in  :-). Anyone speaking with divine authority—whether with
	reference to the past, the present, or the future—was termed a
	prophet (Exodus 7:1). 
	let us prophesy
	according to the proportion of faith—rather, "of our
	faith." Many Romish expositors and some Protestant (as CALVIN
	and BENGEL, and, though,
	hesitatingly, BEZA and
	HODGE), render this "the
	analogy of faith," understanding by it "the general tenor"
	or "rule of faith," divinely delivered to men for their
	guidance. But this is against the context, whose object is to show
	that, as all the gifts of believers are according to their respective
	capacity for them, they are not to be puffed up on account of them,
	but to use them purely for their proper ends.
