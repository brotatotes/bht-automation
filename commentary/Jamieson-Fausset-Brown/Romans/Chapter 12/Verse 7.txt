<p><b>7. Or ministry, let us wait on</b>—"be
	occupied with." 
	</p>
<p><b>our ministering</b>—The
	word here used imports any kind of service, from the dispensing of
	the word of life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4">Acts 6:4</span>) to the
	administering of the temporal affairs of the Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+6:4- :">Acts 6:4- :</span>). The latter seems intended here, being distinguished from
	"prophesying," "teaching," and "exhorting."
	</p>
<p><b>or he that teacheth</b>—Teachers
	are expressly distinguished from prophets, and put after them, as
	exercising a lower function (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:29">1 Corinthians 12:29</span>).
	Probably it consisted mainly in opening up the evangelical bearings
	of Old Testament Scripture; and it was in this department apparently
	that Apollos showed his power and eloquence (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1co+12:29- :">1 Corinthians 12:29- :</span>).</p>
