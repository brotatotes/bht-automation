<p><b>8. Or he that exhorteth</b>—Since
	all preaching, whether by apostles, prophets, or teachers, was
	followed up by exhortation (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+11:23">Acts 11:23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+14:22">Acts 14:22</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+15:32">Acts 15:32</span>,
	c.), many think that no specific class is here in view. But if
	liberty was given to others to exercise themselves occasionally in
	exhorting the brethren, generally, or small parties of the less
	instructed, the reference may be to them. 
	</p>
<p><b>he that giveth</b>—in the
	exercise of private benevolence probably, rather than in the
	discharge of diaconal duty. 
	</p>
<p><b>with simplicity</b>—so the
	word probably means. But as simplicity seems enjoined in the next
	clause but one of this same verse, perhaps the meaning here is, "with
	liberality," as the same word is rendered in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+8:2">2 Corinthians 8:2</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+9:11">2 Corinthians 9:11</span>. 
	</p>
<p><b>he that ruleth</b>—whether
	in the Church or his own household. See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:4">1 Timothy 3:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1ti+3:5">1 Timothy 3:5</span>, where the same word is
	applied to both. 
	</p>
<p><b>with diligence</b>—with
	earnest purpose. 
	</p>
<p><b>he that showeth mercy, with
	cheerfulness</b>—not only without grudging either trouble or
	pecuniary relief, but feeling it to be "more blessed to give
	than to receive," and to help than be helped.</p>
