<p><b>13. Let us walk
	honestly</b>—"becomingly," "seemingly" 
	</p>
<p><b>as in the day</b>—"Men
	choose the night for their revels, but our night is past, for we are
	all the children of the light and of the day (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>): let us therefore only do what is fit to be exposed to the
	light of such a day." 
	</p>
<p><b>not in rioting and
	drunkenness</b>—varied forms of intemperance; denoting revels in
	general, usually ending in intoxication. 
	</p>
<p><b>not in chambering and
	wantonness</b>—varied forms of impurity; the one pointing to
	definite acts, the other more general. 
	</p>
<p><b>not in strife and
	envying</b>—varied forms of that venomous feeling between man and
	man which reverses the law of love.</p>
