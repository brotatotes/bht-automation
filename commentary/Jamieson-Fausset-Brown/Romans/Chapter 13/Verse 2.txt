<p><b>2. Whosoever therefore resisteth the
	power</b>—"So that he that setteth himself against the
	authority." 
	</p>
<p><b>resisteth the ordinance of
	God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation</b>—or,
	"condemnation," according to the old sense of that word;
	that is, not from the magistrate, but from God, whose authority in
	the magistrate's is resisted.</p>
