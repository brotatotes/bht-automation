2. Whosoever therefore resisteth the
	power—"So that he that setteth himself against the
	authority." 
	resisteth the ordinance of
	God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation—or,
	"condemnation," according to the old sense of that word;
	that is, not from the magistrate, but from God, whose authority in
	the magistrate's is resisted.
