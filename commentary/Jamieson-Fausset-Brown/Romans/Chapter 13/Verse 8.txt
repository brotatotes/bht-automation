<p><b>8. Owe no man anything, but to love
	one another</b>—"Acquit yourselves of all obligations except
	love, which is a debt that must remain ever due" [HODGE].

<p><b>for he that loveth another
	hath fulfilled the law</b>—for the law itself is but love in
	manifold action, regarded as matter of duty.</p>
