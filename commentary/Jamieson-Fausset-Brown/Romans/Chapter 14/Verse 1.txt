<p><b>1. Him that is weak in the
	faith</b>—rather, "in faith"; that is, not "him that
	is weak in the truth believed" [CALVIN,
	BEZA, ALFORD,
	c.], but (as most interpreters agree), "him whose faith wants
	that firmness and breadth which would raise him above small
	scruples." (See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>receive ye</b>—to cordial
	Christian fellowship. 
	</p>
<p><b>but not to doubtful
	disputations</b>—rather, perhaps, "not to the deciding of
	doubts," or "scruples" that is, not for the purpose of
	arguing him out of them: which indeed usually does the reverse;
	whereas to receive him to full brotherly confidence and cordial
	interchange of Christian affection is the most effectual way of
	drawing them off. Two examples of such scruples are here specified,
	touching Jewish <i>meats</i> and <i>days.</i> "The strong,"
	it will be observed, are those who knew these to be abolished under
	the Gospel; "the weak" are those who had scruples on this
	point.</p>
