<p><b>15. But if thy brother be
	grieved</b>—has his weak conscience hurt 
	</p>
<p><b>with thy meat</b>—rather,
	"because of meat." The word "meat" is purposely
	selected as something contemptible in contrast with the tremendous
	risk run for its sake. Accordingly, in the next clause, that idea is
	brought out with great strength. 
	</p>
<p><b>Destroy not him with</b>—"by"
	</p>
<p><b>thy meat for whom Christ
	died</b>—"The worth of even the poorest and weakest brother
	cannot be more emphatically expressed than by the words, 'for whom
	Christ died'" [OLSHAUSEN].
	The same sentiment is expressed with equal sharpness in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. <i>Whatever tends to make anyone violate his conscience
	tends to the destruction of his soul; and he who helps, whether
	wittingly or no, to bring about the one is guilty of aiding to
	accomplish the other.</i></p>
