17. For the kingdom of God—or,
	as we should say, Religion; that is, the proper business and
	blessedness for which Christians are formed into a community of
	renewed men in thorough subjection to God (compare  :-). 
	is not meat and drink—"eating
	and drinking" 
	but righteousness, and peace,
	and joy in the Holy Ghost—a beautiful and comprehensive
	division of living Christianity. The first—"righteousness"—has
	respect to God, denoting here "rectitude," in its
	widest sense (as in Matthew 6:33);
	the second—"peace"—has respect to our neighbors,
	denoting "concord" among brethren (as is plain from Matthew 6:33- :; compare Ephesians 4:3;
	Colossians 3:14; Colossians 3:15);
	the third—"joy in the Holy Ghost"—has respect to
	ourselves. This phrase, "joy in the Holy Ghost,"
	represents Christians as so thinking and feeling under the workings
	of the Holy Ghost, that their joy may be viewed rather as that of the
	blessed Agent who inspires it than their own (compare Colossians 3:15- :).
