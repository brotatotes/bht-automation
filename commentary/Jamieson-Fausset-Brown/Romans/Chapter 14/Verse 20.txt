<p><b>20. For</b>—"For the sake of"
	</p>
<p><b>meat destroy not the work of
	God</b>—(See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1">Romans 14:1</span>).
	The apostle sees in whatever tends to violate a brother's conscience
	the <i>incipient</i> destruction of God's work (for every converted
	man is such)—on the same principle as "he that hateth his
	brother is a murderer" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:1- :">Romans 14:1- :</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>All things indeed are
	pure</b>—"clean"; the ritual distinctions being at an
	end. 
	</p>
<p><b>but it is evil to that
	man</b>—there is criminality in the man 
	</p>
<p><b>who eateth with offence</b>—that
	is, so as to stumble a weak brother.</p>
