20. For—"For the sake of"
	meat destroy not the work of
	God—(See on Romans 14:1).
	The apostle sees in whatever tends to violate a brother's conscience
	the incipient destruction of God's work (for every converted
	man is such)—on the same principle as "he that hateth his
	brother is a murderer" (Romans 14:1- :). 
	All things indeed are
	pure—"clean"; the ritual distinctions being at an
	end. 
	but it is evil to that
	man—there is criminality in the man 
	who eateth with offence—that
	is, so as to stumble a weak brother.
