<p><b>servant?</b>—that is,
	CHRIST'S, as the whole

<p><b>Yea,</b> c.—"But he
	shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand" that
	is, to make good his standing, not at the day of judgment, of which
	the apostle treats in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+14:10">Romans 14:10</span>,
	but in the true fellowship of the Church <i>here,</i> in spite of thy
	censures.</p>
