6. He that regardeth the day,
	regardeth it to the Lord—the Lord CHRIST,
	as before. 
	and he . . . not, to the Lord
	he doth not—each doing what he believes to be the Lord's will. 
	He that earth, eateth to the
	Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord
	he eateth not, and giveth God thanks—The one gave thanks to God
	for the flesh which the other scrupled to use; the other did the same
	for the herbs to which, for conscience' sake, he restricted himself.
	From this passage about the observance of days, ALFORD
	unhappily infers that such language could not have been used if the
	sabbath law had been in force under the Gospel in any form.
	Certainly it could not, if the sabbath were merely one of the Jewish
	festival days; but it will not do to take this for granted merely
	because it was observed under the Mosaic economy. And
	certainly, if the sabbath was more ancient than Judaism; if, even
	under Judaism, it was enshrined among the eternal sanctities of the
	Decalogue, uttered, as no other parts of Judaism were, amidst the
	terrors of Sinai; and if the Lawgiver Himself said of it when on
	earth, "The Son of man is LORD
	EVEN OF THE SABBATH DAY" (see  :-) —it will be hard to show that the apostle must have meant
	it to be ranked by his readers among those vanished Jewish festival
	days, which only "weakness" could imagine to be still in
	force—a weakness which those who had more light ought, out of love,
	merely to bear with.
