<p><b>18-22. For I will not dare to speak
	of any</b>—"to speak aught" 
	</p>
<p><b>of those things which Christ
	hath not wrought by me</b>—a modest, though somewhat obscure form
	of expression, meaning, "I will not dare to go beyond what
	Christ <i>hath</i> wrought by me"—in which form accordingly
	the rest of the passage is expressed. Observe here how Paul ascribes
	all the success of his labors to the activity of the living Redeemer,
	working in and by him. 
	</p>
<p><b>by word and deed</b>—by
	preaching and working; which latter he explains in the next clause.</p>
