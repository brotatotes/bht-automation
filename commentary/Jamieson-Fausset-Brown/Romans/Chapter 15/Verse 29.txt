<p><b>that . . . I shall come in
	the fulness of the blessing of Christ</b>—Such, beyond all doubts,
	is the true reading, the words "of the gospel" being in
	hardly any manuscripts of antiquity and authority. Nor was the
	apostle mistaken in this confidence, though his visit to Rome was in
	very different circumstances from what he expected. See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>.</p>
