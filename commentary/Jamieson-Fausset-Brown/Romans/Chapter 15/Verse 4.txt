	immediately to Christ, they are inapplicable to you for though
	Christ's sufferings, as a Saviour, were exclusively His own, the
	<i>motives</i> that prompted them, the <i>spirit</i> in which they
	were endured, and the <i>general principle</i> involved in His whole
	work—self-sacrifice for the good of others—furnish our most
	perfect and beautiful model; and so all Scripture relating to these
	is for our instruction; and since the duty of <i>forbearance,</i> the
	strong with the weak, requires 'patience,' and this again needs
	'comfort,' all those Scriptures which tell of <i>patience</i> and
	<i>consolation,</i> particularly of the patience of Christ, and of
	the consolation which sustained Him under it, are our appointed and
	appropriate nutriment, ministering to us '<i>hope</i>' of that
	blessed day when these shall no more be needed." See on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, <i>Note</i> 7. (For the same connection between "patience
