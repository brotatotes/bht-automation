4. For whatsoever things were
	written aforetime were written for our learning—"instruction"
	through, c.—"through
	the comfort and the patience of the Scriptures" 
	might have hope—that
	is, "Think not that because such portions of Scripture relate
	immediately to Christ, they are inapplicable to you for though
	Christ's sufferings, as a Saviour, were exclusively His own, the
	motives that prompted them, the spirit in which they
	were endured, and the general principle involved in His whole
	work—self-sacrifice for the good of others—furnish our most
	perfect and beautiful model; and so all Scripture relating to these
	is for our instruction; and since the duty of forbearance, the
	strong with the weak, requires 'patience,' and this again needs
	'comfort,' all those Scriptures which tell of patience and
	consolation, particularly of the patience of Christ, and of
	the consolation which sustained Him under it, are our appointed and
	appropriate nutriment, ministering to us 'hope' of that
	blessed day when these shall no more be needed." See on  :-, Note 7. (For the same connection between "patience
	and hope" see on Romans 15:1,
	and 1 Thessalonians 1:3).
