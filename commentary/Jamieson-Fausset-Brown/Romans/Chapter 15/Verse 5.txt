<p><b>5, 6. Now the God of patience and
	consolation</b>—Such beautiful names of God are taken from the
	graces which He inspires: as "the God of hope" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), "the God of peace" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).

<p><b>grant you to be
	likeminded</b>—"of the same mind" 
	</p>
<p><b>according to Christ Jesus</b>—It
	is not mere unanimity which the apostle seeks for them; for unanimity
	in evil is to be deprecated. But it is "<i>according to Christ
	Jesus</i>"—after the sublimest model of Him whose
	all-absorbing desire was to do, "not His own will, but the will
	of Him that sent Him" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
