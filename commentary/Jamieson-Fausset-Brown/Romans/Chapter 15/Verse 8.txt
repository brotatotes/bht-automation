8-12. Now—"For" is
	the true reading: the apostle is merely assigning an additional
	motive to Christian forbearance. 
	I say that Jesus Christ
	was—"hath become" 
	a minister of the
	circumcision—a remarkable expression, meaning "the
	Father's Servant for the salvation of the circumcision (or, of
	Israel)." 
	for the truth of God—to
	make good the veracity of God towards His ancient people. 
	to confirm the—Messianic
	promises made unto the
	fathers—To cheer the Jewish believers, whom he might seem to
	have been disparaging, and to keep down Gentile pride, the apostle
	holds up Israel's salvation as the primary end of Christ's mission.
	But next after this, Christ was sent.
