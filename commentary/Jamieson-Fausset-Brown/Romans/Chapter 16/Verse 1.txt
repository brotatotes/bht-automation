<p><b>1. I commend unto you Phoeligbebe
	our sister, which is a servant</b>—or "deaconess" 
	</p>
<p><b>of the church which is at
	Cenchrea</b>—The word is "Cenchreæ," the eastern part of
	Corinth (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+18:18">Acts 18:18</span>). That in
	the earliest churches there were deaconesses, to attend to the wants
	of the female members, there is no good reason to doubt. So early at
	least as the reign of Trajan, we learn from PLINY'S
	celebrated letter to that emperor—A.D.
	110, or 111—that they existed in the Eastern churches. Indeed, from
	the relation in which the sexes then stood to each other, something
	of this sort would seem to have been a necessity. Modern attempts,
	however, to revive this office have seldom found favor; either from
	the altered state of society, or the abuse of the office, or both.</p>
