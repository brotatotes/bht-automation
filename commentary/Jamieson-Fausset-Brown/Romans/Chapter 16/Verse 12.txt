<p><b>12. Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa,
	who labour in the Lord</b>—two active women.

	Lord</b>—referring probably, not to official services, such as
	would fall to the deaconesses, but to such higher Christian
	labors—yet within the sphere competent to woman—as Priscilla
	bestowed on Apollos and others (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>).</p>
