13. Salute Rufus, chosen—"the
	chosen" 
	in the Lord—meaning,
	not "who is one of the elect," as every believer is, but
	"the choice" or "precious one" in the Lord. (See
	1 Peter 2:4; 2 John 1:13).
	We read in Mark 15:21 that Simon
	of Cyrene, who was compelled to bear our Lord's cross, was "the
	father of Alexander and Rufus." From this we naturally conclude
	that when Mark wrote his Gospel, Alexander and Rufus must have been
	well known as Christians among those by whom he expected his Gospel
	to be first read; and, in all likelihood, this was that very "Rufus";
	in which case our interest is deepened by what immediately follows
	about his mother. 
	and—salute. 
	his mother and mine—The
	apostle calls her "his own mother," not so much as our Lord
	calls every elderly woman believer His mother (Matthew 12:49;
	Matthew 12:50), but in grateful
	acknowledgment of her motherly attentions to himself, bestowed no
	doubt for his Master's sake, and the love she bore to his honored
	servants. To us it seems altogether likely that the conversion of
	Simon the Cyrenian dated from that memorable day when "passing
	[casually] by, as he came from the country" (Matthew 12:50- :), "they compelled him to bear the" Saviour's
	cross. Sweet compulsion, if what he thus beheld issued in his
	voluntarily taking up his own cross! Through him it is natural
	to suppose that his wife would be brought in, and that this believing
	couple, now "heirs together of the grace of life" (Matthew 12:50- :), as they told their two sons, Alexander and Rufus, what
	honor had unwittingly been put upon their father at that hour of
	deepest and dearest moment to all Christians, might be blessed to the
	inbringing of both of them to Christ. In this case, supposing the
	elder of the two to have departed to be with Christ ere this letter
	was written, or to have been residing in some other place, and Rufus
	left alone with his mother, how instructive and beautiful is the
	testimony here borne to her!
