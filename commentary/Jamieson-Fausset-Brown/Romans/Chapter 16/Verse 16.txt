16. Salute one another with an holy
	kiss—So 1 Corinthians 16:20; 1 Thessalonians 5:26;
	1 Peter 5:14. The custom prevailed
	among the Jews, and doubtless came from the East, where it still
	obtains. Its adoption into the Christian churches, as the symbol of a
	higher fellowship than it had ever expressed before, was probably as
	immediate as it was natural. In this case the apostle's desire seems
	to be that on receipt of his epistle, with its salutations, they
	should in this manner expressly testify their Christian affection. It
	afterwards came to have a fixed place in the church service,
	immediately after the celebration of the Supper, and continued long
	in use. In such matters, however, the state of society and the
	peculiarities of different places require to be studied. 
	The churches of Christ salute
	you—The true reading is, "All the churches"; the word
	"all" gradually falling out, as seeming probably to express
	more than the apostle would venture to affirm. But no more seems
	meant than to assure the Romans in what affectionate esteem they were
	held by the churches generally; all that knew he was writing to Rome
	having expressly asked their own salutations to be sent to them. (See
	Romans 16:19).
