<p><b>18. For they that are such serve not
	our Lord Jesus Christ</b>—"our Lord Christ" appears to be
	the true reading. 
	</p>
<p><b>but their own belly</b>—not
	in the grosset sense, but as "living for low ends of their own"
	(compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="php+3:19">Philippians 3:19</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and by good words and fair
	speeches deceive the simple</b>—the unwary, the unsuspecting. (See
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+14:15">Proverbs 14:15</span>).</p>
