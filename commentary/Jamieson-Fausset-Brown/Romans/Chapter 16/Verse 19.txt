<p><b>is come abroad unto all. I am
	glad therefore on your behalf</b>—"I rejoice therefore over
	you," seems the true reading.

<p><b>but yet I would have you wise
	unto that which is good, and simple</b>—"harmless," as in

	reputation among the churches for subjection to the teaching ye have
	received is to me sufficient ground of confidence in you; but ye need
	the serpent's wisdom to discriminate between transparent truth and
	plausible error, with that guileless simplicity which instinctively
	cleaves to the one and rejects the other."</p>
