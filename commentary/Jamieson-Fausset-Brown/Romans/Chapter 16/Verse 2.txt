2. Receive her in the Lord—that
	is, as a genuine disciple of the Lord Jesus. 
	as—"so as" 
	becometh saints—so as
	saints should receive saints. 
	assist her in whatsoever
	business she hath—"may have" 
	need of you—some
	private business of her own. 
	for she hath been a succourer
	of many, and of myself also—(See Psalms 41:1-3;
	2 Timothy 1:16-18).
