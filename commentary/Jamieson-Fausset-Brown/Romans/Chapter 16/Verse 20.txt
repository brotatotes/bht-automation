<p><b>20. And the God of peace shall
	bruise Satan under your feet shortly</b>—The apostle encourages the
	Romans to persevere in resisting the wiles of the devil with the
	assurance that, as good soldiers of Jesus Christ, they are "shortly"
	to receive their discharge, and have the satisfaction of "putting
	their feet upon the neck" of that formidable enemy—symbol
	familiar, probably, in all languages to express not only the
	completeness of the defeat, but the abject humiliation of the
	conquered foe. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jos+10:24">Joshua 10:24</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+22:41">2 Samuel 22:41</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eze+21:29">Ezekiel 21:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+91:13">Psalms 91:13</span>). Though the apostle
	here styles Him who is thus to bruise Satan, the God of peace,"
	with special reference to the "divisions" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+91:13- :">Psalms 91:13- :</span>) by which the church at Rome was in danger of being
	disturbed, this sublime appellation of God has here a wider sense,
	pointing to the whole "purpose for which the Son of God was
	manifested, to destroy the works of the devil" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+91:13- :">Psalms 91:13- :</span>); and indeed this assurance is but a reproduction of the
	first great promise, that the Seed of the woman should bruise the
	Serpent's head (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15">Genesis 3:15</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>The grace of our Lord Jesus
	Christ be with you. Amen</b>—The "Amen" here has no
	manuscript authority. What comes after this, where one would have
	expected the epistle to close, has its parallel in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+3:15- :">Genesis 3:15- :</span>, &amp;c., and being in fact common in epistolary writings,
	is simply a mark of genuineness.</p>
