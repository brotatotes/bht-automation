<p><b>21. Timotheus, my work-fellow</b>—"my
	fellow labourer"; see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>. The apostle mentions him here rather than in the opening
	address to this church, as he had not been at Rome [BENGEL].
	</p>
<p><b>and Lucius</b>—not Luke,
	for the fuller form of "Lucas" is not "Lucius"
	but "Lucanus." The person meant seems to be "Lucius of
	Cyrene," who was among the "prophets and teachers" at
	Antioch with our apostle, before he was summoned into the missionary
	field (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1">Acts 13:1</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>and Jason</b>—See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+13:1- :">Acts 13:1- :</span>. He had probably accompanied or followed the apostle from
	Thessalonica to Corinth.
