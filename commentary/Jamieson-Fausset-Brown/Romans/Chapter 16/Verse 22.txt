<p><b>22. I, Tertius, who wrote this</b>—"the"
	</p>
<p><b>epistle</b>—as the
	apostle's amanuensis, or penman. 
	</p>
<p><b>salute you in the Lord</b>—So
	usually did the apostle dictate his epistles, that he calls the
	attention of the Galatians to the fact that to them he wrote with his
	own hand (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+6:11">Galatians 6:11</span>). But this
	Tertius would have the Romans to know that, far from being a mere
	scribe, his heart went out to them in Christian affection; and the
	apostle, by giving his salutation a place here, would show what sort
	of assistants he employed.</p>
