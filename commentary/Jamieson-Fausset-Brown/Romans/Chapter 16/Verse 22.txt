22. I, Tertius, who wrote this—"the"
	epistle—as the
	apostle's amanuensis, or penman. 
	salute you in the Lord—So
	usually did the apostle dictate his epistles, that he calls the
	attention of the Galatians to the fact that to them he wrote with his
	own hand (Galatians 6:11). But this
	Tertius would have the Romans to know that, far from being a mere
	scribe, his heart went out to them in Christian affection; and the
	apostle, by giving his salutation a place here, would show what sort
	of assistants he employed.
