23. Gaius mine host, and—the
	host 
	of the whole church—(See
	Acts 20:4). It would appear that
	he was one of only two persons whom Paul baptized with his own hand
	(compare 3 John 1:1). His Christian
	hospitality appears to have been something uncommon. 
	Erastus the
	chamberlain—"treasurer." 
	of the city—doubtless
	of Corinth. (See Acts 19:22;
	2 Timothy 4:20). 
	and Quartus a brother—rather,
	"the" or "our brother"; as Sosthenes and Timothy
	are called (1 Corinthians 1:1; 2 Corinthians 1:1,
	Greek). Nothing more is known of this Quartus.
