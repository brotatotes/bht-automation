<p><b>27. To God,</b> c.—"To the
	only wise God through Jesus Christ, be"—literally, "to
	whom be" that is, "to Him, I say, be the glory for ever.
	Amen." At its outset, this is an ascription of glory to the
	<i>power</i> that could do all this; at its close it ascribes glory
	to the <i>wisdom</i> that planned and that presides over the
	gathering of a redeemed people out of all nations. The apostle adds
	his devout "Amen," which the reader—if he has followed
	him with the astonishment and delight of him who pens these
	words—will fervently echo. 
	</p>
<p>On this concluding section of the
	Epistle, <i>Note,</i> (1) In the minute and delicate manifestations
	of Christian feeling, and lively interest in the smallest movements
	of Christian life, love, and zeal, which are here exemplified,
	combined with the grasp of thought and elevation of soul which this
	whole Epistle displays, as indeed all the writings of our apostle, we
	have the secret of much of that grandeur of character which has made
	the name of Paul stand on an elevation of its own in the estimation
	of enlightened Christendom in every age, and of that influence which
	under God, beyond all the other apostles, he has already exercised,
	and is yet destined to exert, over the religious thinking and feeling
	of men. Nor can any approach him in these peculiarities without
	exercising corresponding influence on all with whom they come in
	contact (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:1-16">Romans 16:1-16</span>).
	(2) "The wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the
	dove"—in enjoining which our apostle here only echoes the
	teaching of his Lord (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16">Matthew 10:16</span>)
	—is a combination of properties the rarity of which among
	Christians is only equalled by its vast importance. In every age of
	the Church there have been real Christians whose excessive study of
	the serpent's wisdom has so sadly trenched upon their guileless
	simplicity, as at times to excite the distressing apprehension that
	they were no better than wolves in sheep's clothing. Nor is it to be
	denied, on the other hand, that, either from inaptitude or
	indisposition to judge with manly discrimination of character and of
	measures, many eminently simple, spiritual, devoted Christians, have
	throughout life exercised little or no influence on any section of
	society around them. Let the apostle's counsel on this head (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+10:16- :">Matthew 10:16- :</span>) be taken as a study, especially by young Christians, whose
	character has yet to be formed, and whose permanent sphere in life is
	but partially fixed; and let them prayerfully set themselves to the
	combined exercise of both those qualities. So will their Christian
	character acquire solidity and elevation, and their influence for
	good be proportionably extended. (3) Christians should cheer their
	own and each other's hearts, amidst the toils and trials of their
	protracted warfare, with the assurance that it will have a speedy and
	glorious end; they should accustom themselves to regard all
	opposition to the progress and prosperity of Christ's cause—whether
	in their own souls, in the churches with which they are connected, or
	in the world at large—as just "Satan" in conflict, as
	ever, with Christ their Lord; and they should never allow themselves
	to doubt that "the God of peace" will "shortly"
	give them the neck of their Enemy, and make them to bruise the
	Serpent's head (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20">Romans 16:20</span>). (4)
	As Christians are held up and carried through solely by divine power,
	working through the glorious Gospel, so to that power, and to the
	wisdom that brought that Gospel nigh to them, they should ascribe all
	the glory of their stability now, as they certainly will of their
	victory at last (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:20- :">Romans 16:20- :</span>). (5) "Has the everlasting God . . . commanded"
	that the Gospel "mystery," so long kept hid but now fully
	disclosed, shall be "made known to all nations for the obedience
	of faith" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:26">Romans 16:26</span>)?
	Then, what "necessity is laid upon" all the churches and
	every Christian, to send the Gospel "to every creature!"
	And we may rest well assured that the prosperity or decline of
	churches, and of individual Christians, will have not a little to do
	with their faithfulness or indifference to this imperative duty.

<p>The ancient subscription at the
	end of this epistle—though of course of no authority—appears to
	be in this case quite correct.</p>
