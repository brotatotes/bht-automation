3-5. Salute Priscilla—The true
	reading here is "Prisca" (as in  :-), a contracted form of Priscilla, as "Silas" of
	"Silvanus." 
	and Aquila my helpers—The
	wife is here named before the husband (as in Acts 18:18;
	Romans 16:26, according to the true
	reading; also in 2 Timothy 4:19),
	probably as being the more prominent and helpful to the Church.
