4. who have for my life laid
	down—"who did for my life lay down" 
	their own necks—that
	is, risked their lives; either at Corinth (Acts 18:6;
	Acts 18:9; Acts 18:10),
	or more probably at Ephesus (Acts 19:30;
	Acts 19:31; and compare Acts 19:31- :). They must have returned from Ephesus (where we last find
	them in the history of the Acts) to Rome, whence the edict of
	Claudius had banished them (Acts 19:31- :); and doubtless, if not the principal members of that
	Christian community, they were at least the most endeared to our
	apostle. 
	unto whom not only I give
	thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles—whose special
	apostle this dear couple had rescued from imminent danger.
