<p><b>5. Likewise the church that is in
	their house</b>—The Christian assembly that statedly met there for
	worship. "From his occupation as tent-maker, he had probably
	better accommodations for the meetings of the church than most other
	Christians" [HODGE].
	Probably this devoted couple had written to the apostle such an
	account of the stated meetings at their house, as made him feel at
	home with them, and include them in this salutation, which doubtless
	would be read at their meetings with peculiar interest.

<p><b>Salute my well beloved
	Epænetus, who is the first-fruits</b>—that is, the first convert 
	</p>
<p><b>of Achaia unto Christ</b>—The
	true reading here, as appears by the manuscripts, is, "the
	first-fruits of Asia unto Christ"—that is, Proconsular Asia
	(see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6">Acts 16:6</span>). In <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ac+16:6- :">Acts 16:6- :</span> it is said that "the household of Stephanas was the
	first-fruit of Achaia"; and though if Epænetus was one of that
	family, the two statements might be reconciled according to the
	received text, there is no need to resort to this supposition, as
	that text is in this instance without authority. Epænetus, as the
	first believer in that region called Proconsular Asia, was dear to
	the apostle. (See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ho+9:10">Hosea 9:10</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mic+7:1">Micah 7:1</span>). None of the names
	mentioned from <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+16:5-15">Romans 16:5-15</span>
	are otherwise known. One wonders at the number of them, considering
	that the writer had never been at Rome. But as Rome was then the
	center of the civilized world, to and from which journeys were
	continually taken to the remotest parts, there is no great difficulty
	in supposing that so active a travelling missionary as Paul would, in
	course of time, make the acquaintance of a considerable number of the
	Christians then residing at Rome.</p>
