<p><b>12. For as many as have sinned</b>—not
	"as many as have sinned <i>at all,</i>" but, "as many
	as are <i>found in sin</i>" at the judgment of the great day (as
	the whole context shows). 
	</p>
<p><b>without law</b>—that is,
	without the advantage of a positive Revelation. 
	</p>
<p><b>shall also perish without
	law</b>—exempt from the charge of rejecting or disregarding it. 
	</p>
<p><b>and as many as have sinned in
	the law</b>—within the pale of a positive, written Revelation. 
	</p>
<p><b>shall be judged by the
	law</b>—tried and condemned by the higher standard of that written
	Revelation.</p>
