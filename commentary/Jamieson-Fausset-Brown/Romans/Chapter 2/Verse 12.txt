12. For as many as have sinned—not
	"as many as have sinned at all," but, "as many
	as are found in sin" at the judgment of the great day (as
	the whole context shows). 
	without law—that is,
	without the advantage of a positive Revelation. 
	shall also perish without
	law—exempt from the charge of rejecting or disregarding it. 
	and as many as have sinned in
	the law—within the pale of a positive, written Revelation. 
	shall be judged by the
	law—tried and condemned by the higher standard of that written
	Revelation.
