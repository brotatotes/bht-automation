<p><b>13-15. For not the hearers,</b>
	c.—As touching the Jews, in whose ears the written law is
	continually resounding, the condemnation of as many of them as are
	found sinners at the last involves no difficulty but even as respects
	the heathen, who are strangers to the law in its positive and written
	form—since they show how deeply it is engraven on their moral
	nature, which witnesses within them for righteousness and against
	iniquity, accusing or condemning them according as they violate or
	obey its stern dictates—their condemnation also for all the sin in
	which they live and die will carry its dreadful echo in their own
	breasts.</p>
