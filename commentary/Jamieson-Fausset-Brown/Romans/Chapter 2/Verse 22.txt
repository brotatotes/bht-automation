<p><b>22. thou that abhorrest idols</b>—as
	the Jews did ever after their captivity, though bent on them before. 
	</p>
<p><b>dost thou commit
	sacrilege?</b>—not, as some excellent interpreters, "dost thou
	rob idol temples?" but more generally, as we take it, "dost
	thou profane holy things?" (as in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:12">Matthew 21:12</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mt+21:13">Matthew 21:13</span>, and in other ways).</p>
