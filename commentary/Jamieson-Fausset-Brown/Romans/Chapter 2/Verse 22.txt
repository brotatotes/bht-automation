22. thou that abhorrest idols—as
	the Jews did ever after their captivity, though bent on them before. 
	dost thou commit
	sacrilege?—not, as some excellent interpreters, "dost thou
	rob idol temples?" but more generally, as we take it, "dost
	thou profane holy things?" (as in Matthew 21:12;
	Matthew 21:13, and in other ways).
