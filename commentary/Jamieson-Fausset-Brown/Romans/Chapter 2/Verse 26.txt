<p><b>26. Therefore if the uncircumcision
	keep the . . . law,</b> c.â€”Two mistaken interpretations, we think,
	are given of these words: <i>First,</i> that the case here supposed
	is an impossible one, and put merely for illustration [HALDANE,
	CHALMERS, HODGE]
	<i>second</i> that it is the case of the heathen who may and do
	please God when they act, as has been and is done, up to the light of
	nature [GROTIUS,
	OLSHAUSEN, c.]. The first
	interpretation is, in our judgment, unnatural the second, opposed to
	the apostle's own teaching. But the case here put is, we think, such
	as that of Cornelius (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>), who, though outside the <i>external</i> pale of God's
	covenant, yet having come to the knowledge of the truths contained in
	it, do manifest the grace of the covenant without the seal of it, and
	exemplify the character and walk of Abraham's children, though not
	called by the name of Abraham. Thus, this is but another way of
	announcing that God was about to show the insufficiency of the mere
	badge of the Abrahamic covenant, by calling from among the Gentiles a
	seed of Abraham that had never received the seal of circumcision (see
	on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); and this interpretation
	is confirmed by all that follows.</p>
