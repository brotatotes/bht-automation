<p><b>28. he is not a Jew which is one
	outwardly,</b> c.—In other words, the name of "Jew" and
	the rite of "circumcision" were designed but as outward
	symbols of a separation from the irreligious and ungodly world unto
	holy devotedness in heart and life to the God of salvation. Where
	this is realized, the signs are full of significance but where it is
	not, they are worse than useless. 
	</p>
<p><i>Note,</i> (1) It is a sad mark
	of depravity when all that is designed and fitted to melt only
	hardens the heart (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:4">Romans 2:4</span>, and
	compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2pe+3:9">2 Peter 3:9</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+8:11">Ecclesiastes 8:11</span>).
	(2) Amidst all the inequalities of religious opportunity measured out
	to men, and the mysterious bearing of this upon their character and
	destiny for eternity, the same great principles of judgment, in a
	form suited to their respective discipline, will be applied to all,
	and perfect equity will be seen to reign throughout every stage of
	the divine administration (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ec+8:11- :">Ecclesiastes 8:11- :</span>). (3) "The law written on the heart" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:14">Romans 2:14</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15">Romans 2:15</span>) —or the Ethics of
	Natural Theology—may be said to be the one deep foundation on which
	all revealed religion reposes; and see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15- :">Romans 2:15- :</span>, where we have what we may call its other foundation—the
	Physics and Metaphysics of Natural Theology. The testimony of these
	two passages is to the theologian invaluable, while in the breast of
	every teachable Christian it wakens such deep echoes as are
	inexpressibly solemn and precious. (4) High religious professions are
	a fearful aggravation of the inconsistencies of such as make them (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+2:15- :">Romans 2:15- :</span>). See <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2sa+12:14">2 Samuel 12:14</span>.
	(5) As no external privileges, or badge of discipleship, will shield
	the unholy from the wrath of God, so neither will the want of them
	shut out from the kingdom of heaven such as have experienced without
	them that change of heart which the seals of God's covenant were
	designed to mark. In the sight of the great Searcher of hearts, the
	Judge of quick and dead, the renovation of the character in heart and
	life is all in all. In view of this, have not all baptized,
	sacramented disciples of the Lord Jesus, who "profess that they
	know God, but in works deny Him," need to tremble—who, under
	the guise of friends, are "the enemies of the cross of Christ?"</p>
