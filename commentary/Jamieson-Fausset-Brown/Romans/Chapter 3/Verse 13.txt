<p><b>13-18. Their,</b> c.—From
	generals, the apostle here comes to particulars, culling from
	different parts of Scripture passages which speak of depravity as it
	affects <i>the different members of the body</i> as if to show more
	affectingly how "from the sole of the foot even to the head
	there is no soundness" in us. 
	</p>
<p><b>throat is an open sepulchre</b>—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+5:9">Psalms 5:9</span>); that is, "What
	proceeds out of their heart, and finds vent in speech and action
	through the throat, is like the pestilential breath of an open
	grave." 
	</p>
<p><b>with their tongues they have
	used deceit</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+5:9">Psalms 5:9</span>);
	that is, "That tongue which is man's glory (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+16:9">Psalms 16:9</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+57:8">Psalms 57:8</span>) is prostituted to the
	purposes of deception." 
	</p>
<p><b>the poison of asps is under
	their lips</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+140:3">Psalms 140:3</span>):
	that is, "Those lips which should 'drop as an honeycomb,' and
	'feed many,' and 'give thanks unto His name' (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="so+4:11">Song of Solomon 4:11</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="pr+10:21">Proverbs 10:21</span>; <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="heb+13:15">Hebrews 13:15</span>),
	are employed to secrete and to dart deadly poison."</p>
