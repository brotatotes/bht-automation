13-18. Their, c.—From
	generals, the apostle here comes to particulars, culling from
	different parts of Scripture passages which speak of depravity as it
	affects the different members of the body as if to show more
	affectingly how "from the sole of the foot even to the head
	there is no soundness" in us. 
	throat is an open sepulchre—
	(Psalms 5:9); that is, "What
	proceeds out of their heart, and finds vent in speech and action
	through the throat, is like the pestilential breath of an open
	grave." 
	with their tongues they have
	used deceit— (Psalms 5:9);
	that is, "That tongue which is man's glory (Psalms 16:9;
	Psalms 57:8) is prostituted to the
	purposes of deception." 
	the poison of asps is under
	their lips— (Psalms 140:3):
	that is, "Those lips which should 'drop as an honeycomb,' and
	'feed many,' and 'give thanks unto His name' (Song of Solomon 4:11;
	Proverbs 10:21; Hebrews 13:15),
	are employed to secrete and to dart deadly poison."
