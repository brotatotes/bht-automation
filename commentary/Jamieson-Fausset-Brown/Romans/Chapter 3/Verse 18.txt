<p><b>18. There is no fear of God before
	their eyes</b>â€” (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+36:1">Psalms 36:1</span>):
	that is, "Did the eyes but 'see Him who is invisible' (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+36:1- :">Psalms 36:1- :</span>), a reverential awe of Him with whom we have to do would
	chasten every joy and lift the soul out of its deepest depressions;
	but to all this the natural man is a stranger." How graphic is
	this picture of human depravity, finding its way through each several
	organ of the body into the life (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+36:1- :">Psalms 36:1- :</span>): but how small a part of the "desperate wickedness"
	that is <i>within</i> (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jer+17:9">Jeremiah 17:9</span>)
	"proceedeth <i>out</i> of the heart of man!" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="mr+7:21-23">Mark 7:21-23</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+19:12">Psalms 19:12</span>).</p>
