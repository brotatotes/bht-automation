18. There is no fear of God before
	their eyesâ€” (Psalms 36:1):
	that is, "Did the eyes but 'see Him who is invisible' (Psalms 36:1- :), a reverential awe of Him with whom we have to do would
	chasten every joy and lift the soul out of its deepest depressions;
	but to all this the natural man is a stranger." How graphic is
	this picture of human depravity, finding its way through each several
	organ of the body into the life (Psalms 36:1- :): but how small a part of the "desperate wickedness"
	that is within (Jeremiah 17:9)
	"proceedeth out of the heart of man!" (Mark 7:21-23;
	Psalms 19:12).
