20. Therefore by the deeds
	of—obedience to 
	the law there shall no flesh
	be justified—that is, be held and treated as righteous; as is
	plain from the whole scope and strain of the argument. 
	in his sight—at His bar
	(Psalms 143:2). 
	for by the law is the
	knowledge of sin—(See on Psalms 143:2- :;
	Psalms 143:2- :; and Psalms 143:2- :). 
	Note, How broad and deep
	does the apostle in this section lay the foundations of his great
	doctrine of Justification by free grace—in the disorder of man's
	whole nature, the consequent universality of human guilt, the
	condemnation, by reason of the breach of divine law, of the whole
	world, and the impossibility of justification before God by obedience
	to that violated law! Only when these humiliating conclusions are
	accepted and felt, are we in a condition to appreciate and embrace
	the grace of the Gospel, next to be opened up. 
	Psalms 143:2- :. GOD'S
	JUSTIFYING RIGHTEOUSNESS
	THROUGH FAITH IN
	JESUS CHRIST,
	ALIKE ADAPTED
	TO OUR NECESSITIES
	AND WORTHY OF
	HIMSELF.
