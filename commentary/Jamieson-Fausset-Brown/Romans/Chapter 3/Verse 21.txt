	without the law—that
	is, a righteousness to which our obedience to the law contributes
	nothing whatever (Romans 3:28;
	Galatians 2:16).

	witnessed—attested. 
	by the law and the
	prophets—the Old Testament Scriptures. Thus this justifying
	righteousness, though new, as only now fully disclosed, is an
	old righteousness, predicted and foreshadowed in the Old
	Testament.
