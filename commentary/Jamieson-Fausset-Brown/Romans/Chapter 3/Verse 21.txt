<p><b>without the law</b>—that

	nothing whatever (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:28">Romans 3:28</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ga+2:16">Galatians 2:16</span>). 
	</p>
<p><b>is manifested, being

	</p>
<p><b>by the law and the
	prophets</b>—the Old Testament Scriptures. Thus this justifying
	righteousness, though <i>new,</i> as only now fully disclosed, is an
	<i>old</i> righteousness, predicted and foreshadowed in the Old
