<p><b>23. for all have sinned</b>—Though
	men differ greatly in the <i>nature</i> and <i>extent</i> of their
	sinfulness, there is absolutely no difference between the best and
	the worst of men, in the <i>fact</i> that "all have sinned,"
	and so underlie the wrath of God.

<p><b>and come short of the
	glory</b>—or "praise" 
	</p>
<p><b>of God</b>—that is, "have
	failed to earn His approbation" (compare <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, <i>Greek</i>). So the best interpreters.</p>
