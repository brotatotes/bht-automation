<p><b>25, 26. Whom God hath set forth to
	be a propitiation</b>—or "propitiatory sacrifice." 
	</p>
<p><b>through faith in his
	blood</b>—Some of the best interpreters, observing that "faith
	<i>upon</i>" is the usual phrase in <i>Greek,</i> not "faith
	<i>in</i>" Christ, would place a "comma" after
	"faith," and understand the words as if written thus: "to
	be a propitiation, in His blood, through faith." But "faith
	<i>in</i> Christ" is used in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="eph+1:15">Ephesians 1:15</span>; and
	"faith in His blood" is the natural and appropriate meaning
	here. 
	</p>
<p><b>to declare his righteousness
	for the remission</b>—rather, "pretermission" or "passing
	by." 
	</p>
<p><b>of sins</b>—"the
	sins." 
	</p>
<p><b>that are past</b>—not the
	sins committed by the believer before he embraces Christ, but the
	sins committed under the old economy, before Christ came to "put
	away sin by the sacrifice of Himself." 
	</p>
<p><b>through the forbearance of
	God</b>—God not <i>remitting</i> but only <i>forbearing</i> to
	punish them, or passing them by, until an adequate atonement for them
	should be made. In thus not imputing them, God <i>was</i> righteous,
	but He was not <i>seen</i> to be so; there was no "manifestation
	of His righteousness" in doing so under the ancient economy. But
	now that God can "set forth" Christ as a "propitiation
	for sin through faith in His blood," the righteousness of His
	procedure in passing by the sins of believers before, and in now
	remitting them, is "manifested," declared, brought fully
	out to the view of the whole world. (Our translators have
	unfortunately missed this glorious truth, taking "the sins that
	are past" to mean the past sins of believers—committed before
	faith—and rendering, by the word "remission," what means
	only a "passing by"; thus making it appear that "remission
	of sins" is "through the forbearance of God," which it
	certainly is not).</p>
