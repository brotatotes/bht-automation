<p><b>4. God forbid</b>—literally, "<i>Let
	it not be,</i>" that is, "Away with such a thought"—a
	favorite expression of our apostle, when he would not only repudiate
	a supposed consequence of his doctrine, but express his abhorrence of
	it. "The Scriptures do not authorize such a use of God's name as
	must have been common among the English translators of the Bible"
	[HODGE]. 
	</p>
<p><b>yea, let God be</b>—held 
	</p>
<p><b>true, and every man a
	liar</b>—that is, even though it should follow from this that every
	man is a liar. 
	</p>
<p><b>when thou art judged</b>—so
	in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+51:4">Psalms 51:4</span>, according to the
	<i>Septuagint;</i> but in the <i>Hebrew</i> and in our version, "when
	thou judgest." The general sentiment, however, is the same in
	both—that we are to vindicate the righteousness of God, at whatever
	expense to ourselves.</p>
