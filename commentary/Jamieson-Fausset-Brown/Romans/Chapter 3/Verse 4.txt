4. God forbid—literally, "Let
	it not be," that is, "Away with such a thought"—a
	favorite expression of our apostle, when he would not only repudiate
	a supposed consequence of his doctrine, but express his abhorrence of
	it. "The Scriptures do not authorize such a use of God's name as
	must have been common among the English translators of the Bible"
	[HODGE]. 
	yea, let God be—held 
	true, and every man a
	liar—that is, even though it should follow from this that every
	man is a liar. 
	when thou art judged—so
	in Psalms 51:4, according to the
	Septuagint; but in the Hebrew and in our version, "when
	thou judgest." The general sentiment, however, is the same in
	both—that we are to vindicate the righteousness of God, at whatever
	expense to ourselves.
