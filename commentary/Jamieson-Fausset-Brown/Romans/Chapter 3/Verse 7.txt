<p><b>7, 8. For if the truth of God,</b>
	c.—A further illustration of the same sentiment: that is, "Such
	reasoning amounts to this—which indeed we who preach salvation by
	free grace are slanderously accused of teaching—that the more evil
	we do, the more glory will redound to God a damnable principle."
	(Thus the apostle, instead of refuting this principle, thinks it
	enough to hold it up to execration, as one that shocks the moral
	sense).

<p>On this brief section, <i>Note</i>
	(1) Mark the place here assigned to the Scriptures. In answer to the
	question, "What advantage hath the Jew?" or, "What
	profit is there of circumcision?" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>) those holding Romish views would undoubtedly have laid the
	stress upon the <i>priesthood,</i> as the glory of the Jewish
	economy. But in the apostle's esteem, "the oracles of God"
	were the jewel of the ancient Church (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:1">Romans 3:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2">Romans 3:2</span>). (2) God's eternal
	purposes and man's free agency, as also the doctrine of salvation by
	grace and the unchanging obligations of God's law, have ever been
	subjected to the charge of inconsistency by those who will bow to no
	truth which their own reason cannot fathom. But amidst all the clouds
	and darkness which in this present state envelop the divine
	administration and many of the truths of the Bible, such broad and
	deep principles as are here laid down, and which shine in their own
	luster, will be found the sheet-anchor of our faith. "Let God be
	true, and every man a liar" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:2- :">Romans 3:2- :</span>); and as many advocates of salvation by grace as say, "Let
	us do evil that good may come," "their damnation is just"
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+3:8">Romans 3:8</span>).

	IS SHUT
	UP UNDER LIKE
	CONDEMNATION WITH THE
	GENTILE IS
	PROVED BY HIS
	OWN SCRIPTURE.</p>
