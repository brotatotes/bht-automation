<p><b>17. As it is written,</b> &amp;c.—
	(<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+17:5">Genesis 17:5</span>). This is quoted to
	justify his calling Abraham the "father of us all," and is

<p><b>before</b>—that is, "in
	the reckoning of."

<p><b>him whom he believed</b>—that
	is, "Thus Abraham, in the reckoning of Him whom he believed, is
	the father of us all, in order that all may be assured, that doing as
	he did, they shall be treated as he was." 
	</p>
<p><b>even God, quickeneth the
	dead</b>—The nature and greatness of that faith of Abraham which we
	are to copy is here strikingly described. What he was required to
	believe being above nature, his faith had to fasten upon God's power
	to surmount physical incapacity, and call into being what did not
	then exist. But God having made the promise, Abraham believed Him in
	spite of those obstacles. This is still further illustrated in what
	follows.</p>
