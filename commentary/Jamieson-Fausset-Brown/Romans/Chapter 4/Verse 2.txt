2. For if Abraham were justified by
	works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before Godâ€”"If
	works were the ground of Abraham's justification, he would have
	matter for boasting; but as it is perfectly certain that he hath none
	in the sight of God, it follows that Abraham could not have been
	justified by works." And to this agree the words of Scripture.
