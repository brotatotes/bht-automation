<p><b>3. For what saith the, Scripture?
	Abraham believed God, and it</b>—his faith. 
	</p>
<p><b>was counted to him for
	righteousness</b>— (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:6">Genesis 15:6</span>).
	Romish expositors and Arminian Protestants make this to mean that God
	accepted Abraham's act of believing as a substitute for complete
	obedience. But this is at variance with the whole spirit and letter
	of the apostle's teaching. Throughout this whole argument, <i>faith</i>
	is set in direct opposition to <i>works,</i> in the matter of
	justification—and even in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:4">Romans 4:4</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+4:5">Romans 4:5</span>. The meaning, therefore,
	cannot possibly be that the mere act of believing—which is as much
	a work as any other piece of commanded duty (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="joh+6:29">John 6:29</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="1jo+3:23">1 John 3:23</span>) —was counted to
	Abraham for all obedience. The meaning plainly is that Abraham
	believed in the promises which embraced Christ (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+12:3">Genesis 12:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ge+15:5">Genesis 15:5</span>, c.), as we believe in
	Christ Himself and in both cases, faith is merely the instrument that
	puts us in possession of the blessing gratuitously bestowed.</p>
