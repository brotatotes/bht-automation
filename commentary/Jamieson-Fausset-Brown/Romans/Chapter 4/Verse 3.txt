3. For what saith the, Scripture?
	Abraham believed God, and it—his faith. 
	was counted to him for
	righteousness— (Genesis 15:6).
	Romish expositors and Arminian Protestants make this to mean that God
	accepted Abraham's act of believing as a substitute for complete
	obedience. But this is at variance with the whole spirit and letter
	of the apostle's teaching. Throughout this whole argument, faith
	is set in direct opposition to works, in the matter of
	justification—and even in Romans 4:4;
	Romans 4:5. The meaning, therefore,
	cannot possibly be that the mere act of believing—which is as much
	a work as any other piece of commanded duty (John 6:29;
	1 John 3:23) —was counted to
	Abraham for all obedience. The meaning plainly is that Abraham
	believed in the promises which embraced Christ (Genesis 12:3;
	Genesis 15:5, c.), as we believe in
	Christ Himself and in both cases, faith is merely the instrument that
	puts us in possession of the blessing gratuitously bestowed.
