<p><b>7, 8. </b><i><b>Saying,</b></i><b>
	Blessed,</b> c.â€” (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:1">Psalms 32:1</span>
<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ps+32:2">Psalms 32:2</span>). David here sings in
	express terms only of "transgression forgiven, sin covered,
	iniquity not imputed"; but as the negative blessing necessarily
	includes the positive, the passage is strictly in point.</p>
