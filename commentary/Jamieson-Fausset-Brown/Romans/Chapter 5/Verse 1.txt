<p><b>1. Therefore being</b>—"having
	been." 
	</p>
<p><b>justified by faith, we have
	peace with God,</b> c.—If we are to be guided by manuscript
	authority, the true reading here, beyond doubt, is, "Let us have
	peace" a reading, however, which most reject, because they think
	it unnatural to exhort men to <i>have</i> what it belongs to God to
	<i>give,</i> because the apostle is not here giving exhortations, but
	stating matters of fact. But as it seems hazardous to set aside the
	decisive testimony of manuscripts, as to what the apostle <i>did</i>
	write, in favor of what we merely think he <i>ought</i> to have
	written, let us pause and ask—If it be the privilege of the
	justified to "<i>have</i> peace with God," why might not
	the apostle begin his enumeration of the fruits of justification by
	calling on believers to "realize" this peace as belonged to
	them, or cherish the joyful consciousness of it as their own? And if
	this is what he has done, it would not be necessary to continue in
	the same style, and the other fruits of justification might be set
	down, simply as matters of fact. This "peace" is first a
	change in God's relation to us; and next, as the consequence of this,
	a change on our part towards Him. God, on the one hand, has
	"reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>); and we, on the other hand, setting our seal to this, "are
	reconciled to God" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="2co+5:20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span>).
	The "propitiation" is the meeting-place; there the
	controversy on both sides terminates in an honorable and eternal
	"peace."</p>
