	(In fact, the earlier meaning of the English word "atonement"
	was "the <i>reconciliation</i> of two estranged parties")
	[TRENCH]. The foregoing
	effects of justification were all benefits to ourselves, calling for
	gratitude; this last may be termed a purely disinterested one. Our
	first feeling towards God, after we have found peace with Him, is
	that of clinging gratitude for so costly a salvation; but no sooner
	have we learned to cry, Abba, Father, under the sweet sense of
	reconciliation, than "gloriation" in Him takes the place of
	dread of Him, and now He appears to us "altogether lovely!"

<p>On this section, <i>Note,</i> (1)
	How gloriously does the Gospel evince its divine origin by basing all
	acceptable obedience on "peace with God," laying the
	foundations of this peace in a righteous "justification" of
	the sinner "through our Lord Jesus Christ," and making this
	the entrance to a permanent standing in the divine favor, and a
	triumphant expectation of future glory! (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:1">Romans 5:1</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2">Romans 5:2</span>). Other peace, worthy of
	the name, there is none; and as those who are strangers to it rise
	not to the enjoyment of such high fellowship with God, so they have
	neither any taste for it nor desire after it. (2) As only believers
	possess the true secret of patience under trials, so, although "not
	joyous but grievous" in themselves (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:2- :">Romans 5:2- :</span>), when trials divinely sent afford them the opportunity of
	evidencing their faith by the grace of patience under them, they
	should "count it all joy" (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:3">Romans 5:3</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4">Romans 5:4</span>; and see <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:2">James 1:2</span>;
	<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:3">James 1:3</span>). (3) "Hope,"
	in the New Testament sense of the term, is not a lower degree of
	faith or assurance (as many now say, I <i>hope</i> for heaven, but am
	not <i>sure</i> of it); but invariably means "the confident
	expectation of future good." It presupposes faith; and what
	faith <i>assures</i> us will be ours, hope accordingly <i>expects.</i>
	In the nourishment of this hope, the soul's look <i>outward</i> to
	Christ for the ground of it, and <i>inward</i> upon ourselves for
	evidence of its reality, must act and react upon each other (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="jas+1:3- :">James 1:3- :</span> and <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4">Romans 5:4</span> compared).
	(4) It is the proper office of the Holy Ghost to beget in the soul
	the full conviction and joyful consciousness of the love of God in
	Christ Jesus to sinners of mankind, and to ourselves in particular;
	and where this exists, it carries with it such an assurance of final
	salvation as cannot deceive (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4- :">Romans 5:4- :</span>). (5) The <i>justification</i> of sinful men is not in virtue
	of their amendment, but of "the <i>blood</i> of God's Son";
	and while this is expressly affirmed in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4- :">Romans 5:4- :</span>, our <i>reconciliation</i> to God by the "<i>death</i>
	of His Son," affirmed in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:4- :">Romans 5:4- :</span>, is but a variety of the same statement. In both, the
	blessing meant is the <i>restoration of the sinner to a righteous
	standing</i> in the sight of God; and in both, the meritorious ground
	of this, which is intended to be conveyed, is the <i>expiatory
	sacrifice</i> of God's Son. (6) Gratitude to God for redeeming love,
	if it could exist without delight in God Himself, would be a selfish
	and worthless feeling; but when the one rises into the other—the
	transporting sense of eternal "reconciliation" passing into
	"gloriation in God" Himself—then the lower is sanctified
	and sustained by the higher, and each feeling is perfective of the
	other (<span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:11">Romans 5:11</span>).

	discussion, in which every point, and almost every clause, has been

	some slight indication of the grounds of our judgment).</p>
