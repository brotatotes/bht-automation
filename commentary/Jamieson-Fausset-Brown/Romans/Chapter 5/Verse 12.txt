<p><b>12. Wherefore</b>—that is, Things
	being so; referring back to the whole preceding argument. 
	</p>
<p><b>as by one man</b>—Adam. 
	</p>
<p><b>sin</b>—considered here in
	its guilt, criminality, penal desert. 
	</p>
<p><b>entered into the world, and
	death by sin</b>—as the penalty of sin. 
	</p>
<p><b>and so death passed upon all
	men, for that all have sinned</b>—rather, "all sinned,"
	that is, in that one man's first sin. Thus death reaches every
	individual of the human family, as the penalty due to <i>himself.</i>
	(So, in substance, BENGEL,
	HODGE, PHILIPPI).
	Here we should have expected the apostle to finish his sentence, in
	some such way as this: "Even so, by one man righteousness has
	entered into the world, and life by righteousness." But, instead
	of this, we have a digression, extending to five verses, to
	illustrate the important statement of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>; and it is only at <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:18">Romans 5:18</span>
	that the comparison is resumed and finished.</p>
