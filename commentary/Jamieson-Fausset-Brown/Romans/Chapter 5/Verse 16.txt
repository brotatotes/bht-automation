<p><b>16. And not as it was by one that

<p><b>for the judgment</b>—"sentence."

<p><b>was by one</b>—rather, "was

	the next clause, "one offense."

<p><b>to condemnation, but the free
	gift</b>—"gift of grace." 
	</p>
<p><b>is of many offences unto
	justification</b>—a glorious point of contrast. "The
	condemnation by Adam was for <i>one sin;</i> but the justification by
	Christ is an absolution not only from the guilt of that first
	offense, mysteriously attaching to every individual of the race, but
	from the <i>countless offenses</i> it, to which, as a germ lodged in
	the bosom of every child of Adam, it unfolds itself in his life."
	This is the meaning of "grace <i>abounding</i> towards us in the
	<i>abundance of the gift</i> of righteousness." It is a grace
	not only rich in its <i>character,</i> but rich in <i>detail;</i> it
	is a "righteousness" not only rich in a <i>complete
	justification</i> of the guilty, condemned sinner; but rich in the
	<i>amplitude of the ground</i> which it covers, leaving no one sin of
	any of the justified uncancelled, but making him, though loaded with
	the guilt of myriads of offenses, "the righteousness of God in
	Christ."</p>
