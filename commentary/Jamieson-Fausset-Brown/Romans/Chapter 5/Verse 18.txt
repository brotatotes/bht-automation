<p><b>18. Therefore</b>—now at length
	resuming the unfinished comparison of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="+:-"> :-</span>, in order to give <i>formally</i> the concluding member of
	it, which had been done once and again <i>substantially,</i> in the
	intermediate verses. 
	</p>
<p><b>as by the offence of one
	judgment came</b>—or, more simply, "it came." 
	</p>
<p><b>upon all men to condenmation;
	even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came</b>—rather,
	"it came." 
	</p>
<p><b>upon all men to justification
	of life</b>—(So CALVIN,
	BENGEL, OLSHAUSEN,
	THOLUCK, HODGE,
	PHILIPPI). But better, as
	we judge: "As through one offense it [came] upon all men to
	condemnation; even so through one righteousness [it came] upon all
	men to justification of life"—(So BEZA,
	GROTIUS, FERME,
	MEYER, DE
	WETTE, ALFORD,
	<i>Revised Version</i>). In this case, the apostle, resuming the
	statement of <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:12">Romans 5:12</span>, expresses
	it in a more concentrated and vivid form—suggested no doubt by the
	expression in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16">Romans 5:16</span>, "through
	one offense," representing Christ's whole work, considered as
	the ground of our justification, as "ONE
	RIGHTEOUSNESS." (Some would render the peculiar word here
	employed, "one righteous act" [ALFORD,
	c.] understanding by it Christ's <i>death</i> as the one redeeming
	act which reversed the one undoing act of Adam. But this is to limit
	the apostle's idea too much; for as the same word is properly
	rendered "righteousness" in <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16- :">Romans 5:16- :</span>, where it means "the righteousness of the law as
	fulfilled by us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit,"
	so here it denotes Christ's whole "obedience unto death,"
	considered as the one meritorious ground of the reversal of the
	condemnation which came by Adam. But on this, and on the expression,
	"all men," see on <span class="scriptRef" com="jfb" lang="eng" ref="ro+5:16- :">Romans 5:16- :</span>.
	The expression "justification of life," is a vivid
	combination of two ideas already expatiated upon, meaning
	"justification entitling to and issuing in the rightful
	possession and enjoyment of life").</p>
